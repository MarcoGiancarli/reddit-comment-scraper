MECoOp,3e6xtx,ScaretacticFhang,3,Wed Jul 22 12:48:02 2015 UTC,You were in a modded lobby. The host was rude to do that in a public game but you won't suffer any consequences. EA/Bioware hasn't banned anyone in a long time and they aren't checking these days. Spend the credits and don't worry about it.
MECoOp,3e6xtx,sol_in_vic_tus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:19:32 2015 UTC,"I'm new to MP so I have no idea how the credit system works, but something similar happened to me after topping a silver ranked mission.  You must have done something to earn that many credits."
MECoOp,3e4hia,Mazhiwe,2,Tue Jul 21 21:59:15 2015 UTC,"Volus Merc is one of my favorite characters, definitely my favorite volus. Plant your decoy somewhere high traffic, unload while it gets whacked at."
MECoOp,3e4hia,crazycoffin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:28:52 2015 UTC,"Not just my favorite Volus, but my favorite class altogether.  Decoy's just so useful.  Plus there's the melees and shield boost.  Combat drone's not terrible, either.  And as long as there aren't any rocket troopers around and you can place the decoy above bombers, the decoy's dang near indestructible.  So useful for making things get stuck behind a pyro, etc even if they aren't looking at the decoy."
MECoOp,3e4hia,Potataro,2,Wed Jul 22 00:26:00 2015 UTC,"As somewhat of a VMerc connoisseur myself, here's my little overview of this guy on different factions:   Geth:  literally everything will aggro onto the decoy.  Combat drones and turrets can be a bit stubborn at times, but cloak and your combat drone usually gets their attention pretty quickly. Cerberus:  Dragoons and Atlas are the only things that will ignore decoy.  Atlas are incredibly slow and stupid.  Usually they just get stuck behind the enemies that are aggroed on the decoy.  Dragoons are a bit more hassle but they're usually easy to dodge, especially with cloak.  Oh, and somehow the Volus heavy melee actually staggers them.  Go figure. Reapers:  Sure some enemies don't aggro on the decoy, but there are two surprising enemies that conveniently do.  Swarmers oddly target the decoy, which is helpful if your Volus doesn't have a cyclonic.  Also, when in warp-phase, Banshees actually target the decoy.  They will repeatedly throw warps at it, and if its close enough they will use their AoE scream.  It really lets you keep chipping away at them for longer. Collectors:  These guys are a pain with only Troopers and Captains aggroing on the decoy.  Oh, and it seems like Possessed Praetorians target the decoy sometimes with their missiles.  I've honestly never tested it, though, and Praetorians only have a 1/4 chance of appearing in Platinum, so it's not like I see it a ton.  Still, Collectors could be worse for this guy.  Decoy's long duration and the freedom to melee makes Swarms/Plagues less hurtful.    Abominations can't grab you.  Scion shield disrupting is also countered by heavy melee and shield boost.   Seeing as Geth will always show up in Platinum, it's only a matter of time before this guy dominates the enemies, anyways."
MECoOp,3e4hia,Potataro,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:46:13 2015 UTC,"Yah, it's a shame that platinum matches seem to be taking a turn for the worst right now, from what I've observed.  Rarely do I meet up with other platinum viable players anymore, just lots of guys either looking to get carried, missile glitching, or prolly stumbled in by accident and fail to understand the severity of the difficulty their joined."
MECoOp,3e4hia,Potataro,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"I dunno, matches kinda fluctuate.  Maybe it's at a low now but I'm sure there will be plenty of confident players in Public Platinum sooner or later.  Haven't had any problems with missile glitching, but have had a few people who certainly didn't understand the difficulty and plenty of people who needed carrying.  I don't mind carrying people, but only if I get 1 more person to carry with me.  I solo slowly, but can help support a duo pretty well."
MECoOp,3e4hia,volus_pizza_service,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:31:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm normally not against an occasional carry, but when I jump into a group and all 3 are clearly beginners without any gear, it gets pretty frustrating.  Normally as long as there is at least 1 other Platinum level player, the 3rd (preferably) should at least have a positive contribution, then the 4th can be tanking the floor and it should still be doable.  The only classes I can reliable solo with would be the Collector and Paladin.  My other platinum classes are geared towards contributing major deeps or some major Utility (sacrificing alot of dps) and generally don't survive long alone."
MECoOp,3e4hia,Potataro,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:10:47 2015 UTC,"I actually played a game with you when you were playing Volus mercenary.  It was Collectors/Hydra/Platinum, and the team consisted of three volus, and a human engineer who quit and later rejoined.   It was a fun game, although as Volus Engineer with Acolyte, at the times it was a little difficult to damage from a range."
MECoOp,3e4hia,volus_pizza_service,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, IIRC it was pretty rough and I had to solo a bit.  Maybe it was the match after that, though.  And as for having trouble damaging enemies at range, I'd recommend bringing more than an Acolyte.  I like to keep the Volus Engineer pretty offensive, and the Acolyte is more of a defensive weapon.  Maybe try using a heavier, medium range weapon."
MECoOp,3e4hia,Potataro,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:23:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I like spamming recon mine/proximity mine, it may be a cheap tactic, but acolyte is useful for stunning lesser characters (or at least I find), whereas the mines are useful for downing boss enemies."
MECoOp,3e4hia,volus_pizza_service,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:27:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, I would never question how useful the Acolyte is!  I was just thinking maybe bring a secondary weapon, but if you want to have that low cooldown and spam mines, that's fine by me.  While I'm not a huge fan of spamming recon mine (that smoke screen), why should other power classes get to do it but not the Volus Engineer?"
MECoOp,3e4hia,Potataro,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:36:08 2015 UTC,"What weapon would you recommend? To be honest I either don't like many of the weapons, or don't have them at a high enough level to be useful on platinum. I usually just stick to using either the Acolyte, Hurricane, Lancer, Reegar, or Black Widow."
MECoOp,3e4hia,vader540is,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:43:31 2015 UTC,"I use the Reegar.  It's not great for long range like you wanted, but it eats through enemies (and ammo).  I have a friend that uses the Lancer and really likes it.  Makes sense because he needs the low weight.  A Black Widow might be a bit heavy.  Mattock is strong and light, but not everyone likes how it works.  Adas fills a similar roll to the Acolyte.  Not sure what other high level ultra rares you have, but plenty are good."

MECoOp,3dvw0k,cymikelee,4,Mon Jul 20 00:11:11 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for putting up this post!  You inspired me to finally try soloing Gold and I managed it on my first try!  Used my Huntess and her trusty Valiant on Reapers/Vancouver, running in circles and, admittedly, letting Dark Channel do most of the work (it took me 61 minutes, lol).  I was worried about running out of consumables as I was down to 2 ops packs and 2 gels after Wave 7, but I remembered all the great advice here about kiting and dodging warp balls and I managed to survive the rest of the way.  I never planned on doing the challenge or even shooting for BoTB but thanks to y'all, it looks like it's in reach!  So... in short... I totally second your thank you.  I'm really grateful this community here, not just for all the advice, but for some great non-PUG games too!"

MECoOp,3dvw0k,RetGsfdg,2,Tue Jul 21 13:28:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I'm a few weapons/aliens away (been too racist to finish them so far) for my last two Alien challenges, N7 mastery (I don't promote enough), and of course the last few solos.  I'm still debating what to do my second Gold with, it's tempting to try a Vanguard (like the Murdertrain) but I couldn't imagine having to tank a devices objective without cloak, with my still-developing kiting skills at least.  I'm leaning towards either a Harrier TGI or -- and I'll probably try this kit out for the first time later tonight -- a Crusader AIU.  Since no Phantoms, Hurricane sidearm's probably the way to go for both?  My only worry, though, is having to choose between damage+grenades, and the indispensable Geth Scanner..."
MECoOp,3dvw0k,cymikelee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:36 2015 UTC,"I just started playing the AIU last night.  What a kit!    Your question though - I would lean toward the TGI, if for no other reason than vs. geth with the overload chain its super easy button."
MECoOp,3dvw0k,RetGsfdg,3,Tue Jul 21 19:17:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the guy was pretty cool, and he actually send me a friend req too. After you crashed we played one more game and I talked to him a little about the huge difference between our CPs and N7 ratings, and he had a really down to earth attitude about it. He's also from Netherlands so I applaud the guy for staying up two nights in a row. As a new reddit user, who made an account just for this sub, I too wanted to say thank you. The amount of builds, college posts, funny and interesting discussions is overwhelming.  Also, thanks for the mention! I've actually been thinking about u/cymikelee 's idea and have come up with one or two fun scenarios for matches. Full with stories, branching decisions, and different outcomes. I think that's what would make the themed matches really feel like the CoOp that Bioware, sort of ,promised."

Also was fortunate to play a couple matches with /u/Chypsylon ""Butt Laser"" AT... was a whole lot of fun watching him wipe the floor with his hipster CSR.  Couldn't really keep up with him but it was cool to watch!  On a more serious note, got into a session with a PUG-turned-friendlister who recently had a friend pass away.  It was quite a feeling to hear how much this game meant to somebody and humbling to be along for the ride.  It doesn't hurt that playing with this lobby made Platinum feel easy -- we cleaned house on Reapers/Rio, Collectors/Vancouver, and Geth/Ghost-Hazard, having great tech synergy, being flexible with camping/mobility, all while getting a clinic on how great it is to have a Volus on your team.  I don't want to name the guy for privacy reasons but I wouldn't be surprised if many of you have played with him -- always a hoot to hear him cracking jokes on the mic and never taking the game too seriously.

So it doesn't matter which of the 99K packs you buy, at least as far as UR's are concerned.    Anecdotally, I've bought AP's almost exclusively, and I seem to be doing all right. At about 450 hours, I'm only missing the Typhoon. I just checked and my average UR level is 3.7. Only my Harrier and Scorpion are still at level 1. My highest is the Saber at level 8."

I agree about the Harrier. Maybe if I hadn't unlocked it so late I'd like it better. I do use it on the Batarian Soldier, but on a class like the Ghost, where you need to be shooting almost constantly, it's just a hassle."

I basically played all my time when the game came out as an asari vanguard with a hurricane.  Got me through the early parts of the game where you are just grinding for characters and weapons.  The typhoon is great too, but not nearly as much damage as the harrier.  The thing I love to do with the typhoon on the TGI is spec for max weapon damage and capacity bonus.  Then you can go through 4 full cloak cycles in one clip (no reloading animation) if you pop an ammo pack when you are done with the first clip.  Nothing survives that many bullets, nothing :)."

MECoOp,3dntf5,Scarecrow1779,17,Fri Jul 17 19:57:32 2015 UTC,The Battlefield 3 Soldier can detonate Fire Explosions against all targets with Carnage + Frag Grenades. The Volus may survive longer but it has such pitiful damage output it might as well be weaponless.
MECoOp,3dntf5,RepublicanShredder,5,Fri Jul 17 20:34:46 2015 UTC,"The Volus can set off biotic combos with stasis and biotic orbs, and biotic orbs aren't terrible on damage."
MECoOp,3dntf5,blackmarketdolphins,13,Fri Jul 17 21:05:44 2015 UTC,But Stasis can't boss slay. BF3 is the victor
MECoOp,3dntf5,Salsadips,2,Fri Jul 17 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"i mean, i definitely agree the BF3 is better because of lots of splash damage, but the volus performed better than I expected (especially against Cerberus)."
MECoOp,3dntf5,RepublicanShredder,2,Fri Jul 17 22:19:20 2015 UTC,How long did it take to down an atlas?
MECoOp,3dntf5,Salsadips,3,Fri Jul 17 23:51:41 2015 UTC,"only a little longer than it took the shuriken turian. the biotic orbs deal decent damage to armor .I used this build, so 1050 damage to armor per orb, or an average of around 630 damage per second."
MECoOp,3dntf5,derangedTypist,7,Sat Jul 18 00:00:57 2015 UTC,"Stasis and Biotic Orbs have a very long cooldown rate, not to mention finicky targetting.   I swear I think I'm turning into a /u/Salsadips and you're me from 3 years ago."

I've never had much trouble targeting with Stasis or Biotic Orbs. Is the targeting different or more difficult on PC? For me, Stasis targets in the same way as Energy Drain and Reave. Also, the no-weapon build helps with the cooldown time and biotic orbs on its own gives better recharge speeds. I skipped Shield Boost when speccing for this challenge."

MECoOp,3dntf5,asdfth12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:14:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, a weapon just amplifies the power of a caster class. Just play conservatively."
MECoOp,3dntf5,smedes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:51:29 2015 UTC,"Well, reeaally conservatively.  Flamer without reagar is going to be an incredibly slow source of damage, Fury without Acolyte barely works tbh.  The entire dynamic of the class would changed because you can't kill enemies quickly enough to avoid damage."
MECoOp,3dntf5,transam617,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:56:03 2015 UTC,"Not as bad as you'd think. Flamer can be specced for shield damage and the only weakness the Fury would have is against shields, but even then it's a blessing in disguise because annihilation field's shield drain will give you survivability when before you would've just blasted the enemy's shield away with acolyte."

It's too bad that I'm on PC, but between this and hearing people's characters' fascinating backstories, it got me thinking -- would people be interested in developing/playing a multiplayer ""campaign,"" in the form of a series of themed matches with potentially self-enforced objectives?  It could take the form of a galaxy map with branching missions (mission B if you pass A, mission C if you fail), where people would form a crew and ""buy"" a limited set of kit and have to complete the whole thing with that set.  In-mission it could be simple stuff like completing a match or successfully camping a spot on a map, or perhaps quirky objectives like protecting a Volus, only allowing one teammate to have a gun, or killing a Banshee with reactor-frying only.  Then teams could come back to this sub and swap stories!"

MECoOp,3dgng9,EllairaJayd,3,Thu Jul 16 04:14:40 2015 UTC,"Infiltrators are best in my opinion. Cloak is very useful on objective waves and when you are stuck in a corner. Just remember that when you use it, they still might hit you, and if you move too close to them.  Personal favorite is the huntress. Cloak + Dark Channel kills Phantom from 100% and severely damage Banshees. Perfect vs anything BUT geth. Go with full biotics damage upgrade, with a good AR that don't weight too much(like the Lancer)."
MECoOp,3dgng9,UnknownLegion,2,Thu Jul 16 14:59:48 2015 UTC,I prefer Claymore Huntress since power recharge isn't an issue. Insane DPS on her with warp ammo.
MECoOp,3dgng9,TheMadMullah,2,Thu Jul 16 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"Personally don't like Claymore that much. Just ignoring its weight, the ammo is awful. Specially for solo gold. Lancer is perfect in that aspect, that you never need to run to get more ammo. Easier to be constantly on the move."
MECoOp,3dgng9,UnknownLegion,2,Thu Jul 16 15:14:22 2015 UTC,"Claymore X gets 18 reserve clips, I don't think I've ever had ammo issues since maxing it out.

With a Smart Choke attachment the Claymore is reasonably accurate. You kind of have to know how to reload cancel though to get a proper amount of DPS out of it.  And, personally, I find Reapers the easiest. Geth you can get into stunlocks pretty easily."

Pretty much this: http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Vanguard/Cabal/AMKNR/Hurricane10BB5AX5/Venom10AO5AL5/SMGRailAmp3/AdrenalineModule3/ShockTrooperUpgrade5/  But I take range for rank 5 nightshade blades since its default range is so unsafe for me. Harrier and Lancer are very good with mag and velocity barrel. Incendiary and shields. Shock trooper is really helpful. Just play like a Ghost/Havoc but you can go through walls."
MECoOp,3dgng9,caesar_primus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:40:12 2015 UTC,I play the Cabal a lot with PS.

MECoOp,3dgng9,cymikelee,3,Thu Jul 16 04:21:18 2015 UTC,"If you had a hard time surviving with the TGI and Vorcha - the GI is not going to be easy.  It has high damage, but using cloak stops your shield regen and it has low health and low shields with hunter mode.  If you are only doing it for the achievement I would consider Geth or Cerberus using the TGI or SI with a Falcon - something like this.  Falcon will allow huge crowd control and the Infiltrators will boost the damage significantly.  Pairing it with disruptor ammo with give tech boosts every cloak cycle.  Both have heals on almost on demand.  Geth is good because no sync kills and slow speed.  Cerberus has a couple high wave budget units (Phantom and Dragoons) the the falcon will easily handle.  If you want to do reapers again the asari justicar is a good choice.  Reave spam is very strong against the armor and barrier units they have.  Again the falcon, or acolyte is a good primary weapon choice.  If you play defensive on a map like giant justicar vs. reapers is and easy win provided the objectives are reasonable.  The other option for reapers is inferno grenade spam using either the krogan or batarian soldier - batarian soldier / ghost / reapers is what I used for my first gold solo."

MECoOp,3dgng9,cymikelee,2,Thu Jul 16 15:27:49 2015 UTC,The beauty of the falcon is the crowd control and ammo power application is does.  The option to stop dangerous units instantly in a solo is very powerful.  It also applies ammo powers reliably allowing for techbursts with almost every power cast.  I use the falcon on several classes - it's a wonderful gun.
MECoOp,3dgng9,smedes,2,Thu Jul 16 15:45:33 2015 UTC,"Any weapon works on the GI. The best are probably Talon, AT12-Raider, Hurricane, Harrier or Black Widow and Javelin for sniping. Just cloak, proxy mine, shoot them in the face and rinse and repeat."

Since you're alone, it seems enemies aren't fooled by cloak, so I wonder if it's worth the long cooldown you get from cloaking on those."
MECoOp,3dgng9,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:46:56 2015 UTC,I do. I feel like enemies still have a harder time hitting you if they are far away but I don't know if that's really the case.
MECoOp,3dgng9,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:21:55 2015 UTC,"Just to report back on this after doing a Huntress solo on Silver -- it's actually pretty funny because enemies will actually fire blindly when you're cloaked.  Seems they'll target your last known position and miss.  Of course, without duration cloak I don't last the whole activation/deactivation time, which was fine in Silver with Cyclonic IV but I'm not sure that'll fly in Gold."
MECoOp,3dgng9,Scarecrow1779,2,Mon Jul 20 23:24:44 2015 UTC,"I love that build and hardly ever play other GI builds because I love snipers - but as others have mentioned, the GI can run almost any weapon better than almost any other class. If you like shotgun infiltrators, GI (or AIU). Want to use the Hurricane? GI (or a Turian). Harrier? GI (or TGI or a Batarian). Have a subpar selection of weapons and want a class that can make the most with them? GI."

MECoOp,3dhkbn,transam617,2,Thu Jul 16 14:19:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting, the first one I get is sort of a dream class with some balancing factors, but the second one seems curious, meshing this idea of long range priming with Nova.  I guess it's not too far off from the Havoc's ""fake Nova"" with cryo blast + stim packs + the AoE heavy melee, but I never really figured that class out..."
MECoOp,3dhkbn,cymikelee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:00:00 2015 UTC,"The way I got the Havoc to work is by meleeing after the Havoc Strike, you have a move that deals damage, staggers, and also gives you some damage reduction, which buys time for your next Havoc Strike. This just takes that to the next level with Nova giving Damage and Invulnerability Frames and Nova Cancelling allowing you to stay near invulnerable until your shields recharge or you escape. Mainly I was looking to find other classes like the Batarian and Turian Sentinels that use biotics to detonate tech combos, and this is a very original way to do that which doesn't just rely on two ranged powers."
MECoOp,3dgw2z,jbo6527,2,Thu Jul 16 04:22:46 2015 UTC,"The only way I've seen that they're functionally different in-game is that when Geth Primes explode, they damage shields, but not barriers (or health).

I think a lot of it is just the button mashing nature of the beast (and its accompanying stress-relieving properties), and I guess I must just be used to anticipating my moves -- charging early, even if my shields are still close to full, a shot to stagger and nova right out of the charge, and randomly rolling to occasionally get a successful nova cancel.  Of course it's way better on host, but I think learning to play off host makes me a better player."
MECoOp,3ddygg,cymikelee,3,Wed Jul 15 15:14:16 2015 UTC,"For awhile when I first started, I wasn't even aware of the hosting issues with the Vanguard, so I was only playing it off-host.

Well, I can, but I'm significantly worse to the point where I'm dragging the whole team down and getting constantly pissed off at my own game. The enjoyment is pretty much gone. The curse of being in Australia I guess."
MECoOp,3ddygg,EllairaJayd,2,Thu Jul 16 01:22:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, you're definitely right about the enjoyment factor -- it's certainly 10x better on-host because it's just so smooth.  I guess my experience was just that I was surprised at the fact that it's playable off-host (unlike the Slayer, where the delay on PD becomes ridiculous).  Of course, I'm sure it's specific host dependent, but in most cases I think it just changes the point at which I have to play more cautiously (i.e., no more charging fresh spawns at Wave 5 or 8, etc).  I'm sure if we did a rematch of our Novaguards on Gold you'd wipe the floor with me!"
MECoOp,3ddygg,cymikelee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:36:46 2015 UTC,Haha its usually not the best idea to charge fresh spawns on 5 or 8 (or 7 9 or 10) anyway! Of course I still sometimes do it... /guilty look. It's just so much fun when they're all gathered together in a nice little group and I'm practically an explodey human ping pong ball...

I've since found it really satisfying to find the optimal range for each class.  Mostly I play classes that operate at mid range (human engy, asari huntress) or can handle all ranges equally well (destroyer).

The Salarian engineer is also quite fun for melee. Energy drain, the target is stunned, heavy melee and that's pretty much it.

MECoOp,3db4fx,funkymustafa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:45:57 2015 UTC,"Use the damage debuff spec on orbs, and single-target Stasis with the extra damage spec. Take a light weapon with good mid range damage - I like Eagle, Hurricane, or CSMG for him, and put warp ammo on. 3 points in shield boost as a keep-me-alive button. For all troopers = stasis + orb for instant BE, boosted with the Stasis damage spec, then finish them off with your weapon. If you struggle with groups, use bubble Stasis instead. For bosses = debuff with orbs, use weapon.  I don't like the stasis headshot builds on him just because the Asaris do it better, and imo voluses should never be relying on having to carefully line up accurate shots. Your margin for error with incoming damage is so low, if you are on cooldown, that I never want to plant my feet longer than needed. Obviously this setup is much more effective with other biotics on the team, but he can hold his own even without much team synergy. Even if you want to play pure support, you still have four avenues to contribute: weapon, stasis, orb debuff on bosses, and shield boost."

MECoOp,3db4fx,PrimoPandito,8,Wed Jul 15 16:13:55 2015 UTC,"Not really addressing your question as much as other responses. The Volus classes are AWESOME. I play them more than anyone else.  Let's get the basics out of the way. They are not meant to be high dps classes. They are great support classes, thanks mostly to shield boost, which not only heals a super amount of shields every ~2.8s, but provides 50% damage reduction. However, the light melee cloak is fantastic, especially for revives, and they all have their perks.  The Volus protector is my least favorite, mainly due to shield boost being in a different slot than the other 3 Volus classes. Charge is a blessing and a curse. You're too squishy alone to use it much, but it can help you get out of a bind.  The Volus adept, while not my favorite, deserves a lot more credit than it's being given. In addition to shield boost, its biotic combos make a great addition to pretty much any team (except maybe a team with too many biotics already, in which case you probably won't detonate many of your own combos but will be using stasis a lot). Main benefit: stasis is a phantom killer.  The Volus sentinel has combat drone. Don't need to say much here. Short cool down, good distraction, mini bomb.  The Volus engineer is my favorite, and the character I consider to be the best support class. In addition to shield boost and cloak, recon mine and proximity mine increase damage taken by enemies AND slow them down, given your teammates more time to pummel them.  I hesitate to call a character useless, as I've seen most characters used well. There are only the classes I know how to play well, and the classes I don't know how to play well... yet ;)"

His niche is just going auto-pilot and he doesn't even do it well!   Sentry turret doesn't do much offensively or defensively.  You decide where it goes; it stays there and it takes/deals damage for you. Homing grenades hit hard but can be hard to control, since you point it at an enemy and it travels for you (to an extra target you don't pick with Rank 6B). Sabotage makes synthetics fight for you.   Then you're expected to use those high Turian Armiger passives to just outclass all your powers!  Light weapons usually mean you're not getting the most out of your high weapon damage boost.  Heavy weapons mean you have a huge Sabotage cooldown.  I just never feel in control with that guy."

Max your fitness, spec incinerate for chill damage, cryo for radius and debuff. Use disruptor ammo and any powerful shotgun. I prefer the Wraith for the best balane of damage and weight but she can also rock the Raider, Claymore, Venom, Graal, etc.  The stun from disruptor ammo and stagger from cryo blast are your key techniques to interrupt enemy fire. Cryo should be your instant reaction whenever you see an enemy and you should be constantly alternating ice and fire as needed to reload cancel your Wraith shots.  She absolutely chews through troopers since you can snap freeze anyone unshielded, detonate CE's, and stagger on demand. With disruptor IV and cryo debuff, your Wraith will rip through shields very fast. Both powers cooldown quickly even with a heavy weapon. I think you still get a low-mid 3s cooldown on cryo even with a Claymore. Against bosses, debuff with cryo and alternate between Wraith shots and Incinerates.   She can handle all 4 factions but Reapers are her particular strength, and have been since the game came out. If you have trouble getting this playstyle down, try it against Reapers first before the other factions."

This is the build I came up with after figuring him out. Pull is too fun for me to let go! And who needs shields when you got charge!   http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#63!2307585!4806575!34O52364!GF855

MECoOp,3db4fx,Potataro,2,Wed Jul 15 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"Drellguard is a ton of fun, but he's one of the toughest characters to play (on harder difficulties).  I also love nearly every character, but this guy just doesn't make sense.   Charge and Pull have quite a bit of overlap. Charge and his fitness don't mesh well together.  Sure you can usually walk backwards before the enemy can retaliate, but when you get staggered you go down 90% of the time. Charge is lag dependent.  Obvious but relevant. Cluster grenades, though powerful, aren't entirely reliable.  The Drellguard really doesn't have enough wiggle room to be missing grenades. Even with your insane Drell Assassin bonuses, killing things faster than they can kill you is just impractical. I know you don't have to charge everything, but if you don't spec into charge you're literally just playing another Drell Adept.  So, when you do take Charge, even using it as conservatively as possible is risky.   At least he's only boring if you bleed out."
MECoOp,3db4fx,CaptainChudd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:42:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, he definitely isn't a boring character. I came to the same points you did, but I have to disagree when you say he doesn't make sense. I think the point of the Drellguard is to make up for the pitiful barriers and health with careful use of charge. You have to be aggressive, but cautious. Are those things juxtaposition or mutually exclusive? I don't think so.  That's why I kitted the Drellguard the way I did. I posted it previously in this thread. I take the Acolyte to drop shields and barriers and an SMG for armored guys. It's shoot, followed immediately by Pull then Charge. Pull makes it safe for him to Charge or escape. I save the grenades for big armored bosses. As soon as I get the shields down, it's SMG and grenade time. It's kind of hard to miss when your dealing with something as big as an Atlas or a Brute.  I only went 4 on Fitness because you have Charge. Given that, he can't just go Charging into the fray. You have to be calculated when using Charge with him. You single out an enemy to take him out or charge an enemy to fill your shields enough for an escape.  You might not be at the top of the leaderboard all the time with him, but you'll be surprised how often you are."
MECoOp,3db4fx,Potataro,2,Thu Jul 16 03:53:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, I think I see some of our differences.  I also use an SMG and pistol but I keep the pistol as the backup.  It makes phantoms a lot more reliant on either multi-charging or carefully dropping grenades at your feet.  If a wave has a lot of phantoms I just use the Scorpion pretty safely.  I typically save grenades for killing lots of quick-firing enemies like Marauders and Captains.  Brutes and Atlas are way too easy to shred with a Hurricane for me to waste my precious grenades.  Guess I just prefer the thrill of being the fastest thing on the map over being too cautious.  Don't get me wrong, normally I play very cautiously, but a lot of Vanguards have trouble getting into Charge-loops.  Even with his speed I can't back out fast enough to stop that."

MECoOp,3db4fx,ElMacedonian,5,Tue Jul 14 23:32:32 2015 UTC,"Cabal is a very fun charachter that has a few ways she can eek out a ton of damage. However it takes slot of work to really get her damage and when uses to thing like infiltrators and flamer, it can feel Low on the damage. But this is a class that is more about being the most mobile class in the game. You can abuse CQC maps like glacir by teleporting through everything in the map.  There are three ways to eek out high damage with her, all hinging on her mobility.    Use the mobility to get yourself up close and personal for the types of weapons that Benifit from great Turian passives (extra damage and stability). You can get in close with a hurricane ( or tempest) and spray then get the hell out of there. Also mobility can let you get around to ammo boxes quicker to take advantage of harrier ammo problems.  Grenades. Nightshade blades are badass, they absolutely destroy phantoms and mooks, and. Similarl to above, your mobility can allow you to get in to crowded places (such as spawns) safely, spray some nades and bullets, and GTFO. Same as above mobility also allows you to make rounds for grenades easier.    3.less conventional but viable gold and down, this class makes a fun melee build allowing you to pick off enimies safely and one by one. Your heavy melee with appropriate gear is crazy good. I recommend an acolyte hurricane combo for this.  Lastly, your the best medic in the game, bar none. No one can get in harrier positions, shoot out crowd control, get you up and stay alive like the cabal. Geth jug brings you all his friends when he comes to pick you up, and after the volus gets you he kindly looks at you with those big eyes and says, hey so since your up now, you were Gona kill all these enimies yourself right?"
MECoOp,3db4fx,smedes,2,Wed Jul 15 02:32:36 2015 UTC,"No one ever mentions poison strike when they're talking about the cabal.

MECoOp,3db4fx,ElMacedonian,0,Wed Jul 15 12:49:45 2015 UTC,"No poison strike is essential. I go 4/6/6/6/4 on this build, with a range poison strike. It's more of a long range teleport then anything, that happens to detonate explosions and have a dot. Effect as a bonus.   Unfortunate that you can't take geth scanner, but real talk, a lot of people use it as a crutch anyway, this class has enourmous amounts of survivability and the nades are a huge part of diving in, getting your big burst of damage then getting out. Nightshade blades paralyze phantoms, thats an incredible amount of crowd control and damage in in one package."

Fire exploding builds with it, never got me the quick kills or survivability that I got from a build that spams Nightshade and Biotic Focus. I sub the skill for melee. It has better tracking and more consistent damage and doesn't have a cooldown.   I tried to make it work many a times, but imo PS isn't worth it. It slows down my momentum, has wonky power tracking, and th damage isn't something to call home about. Again, Ive never been outperformed by a PS user or really seen one that could sell me on respec-ing back into it."
MECoOp,3db4fx,smedes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:31:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about wonky power tracking - it wasn't designed the way it probably should have been, but it's consistent and therefore predictable. If it's slowing down your momentum, we are definitely doing something very differently, because I tend to find my cabal build has way more momentum than any other kit I've played. The key is that you're using PS to advance to your next target even as you're detonating your current target. That's one reason why the geth scanner is so important - you need to make split-second decisions after every third target or so, and knowing exactly where the enemies are - and what they are - at all times is critical to making the right decision.  I'm not trying to convince you that you're wrong not to spec into PS. I honestly have mostly the same complaints about nightshade blades - they're unreliable and never seem to do as much damage as people keep telling me they should, and I hate humping ammo boxes all game. I just think we both have problems between the chair and the keyboard, and it's unfair to say PS is trash."

MECoOp,3db4fx,ElMacedonian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:07:34 2015 UTC,I would not advise this. Living on biotic focus can become a crutch and it's not as Tanky as you would think since it does not give you your shield gate back. On higher difficulties it's best used sparring since your trying to rely on mobility over tankiness for survivability
MECoOp,3db4fx,Chypsylon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:50:03 2015 UTC,"Of course it's a crutch, but the same goes for stim packs, shield boost, repair matrix or the juggernaut in general. You can have continuously 25% damage reduction and 40% shield restore every 2.5 seconds. Additionally you're invincible for 1/5 of the game. So yes, you're pretty tanky.  Of course you should still use soft cover and your mobility as well but there's no reason not to spam biotic focus since you don't need poison strike for mobility and the blades aren't affected by cooldown."

Don't fall into the trap of a conservative playstyle where you sit in cover, use AR, then peek out to fire as if you were an infiltrator. Charge those idiots, claymore to the face, insta reload with AR and fire again. Grenade to stun/kill the stragglers while you reload cancel and Claymore again. Repeat until there are only corpses in front of you. It takes some practice to have tight CQC accuracy with the claymore to maximize this playstyle's effectiveness, but that double shot claymore chaos is just too fun to pass up."

With heat sink and stability, you'll wonder why you ever used an AR on him. As for the human soldier, the CS build is dope with a Falcon and Cryo/Distruptor rounds. Or skipping CS, for a reload canceling shotty builds will shake this up a bit."

MECoOp,3db4fx,Moorebetter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:48:08 2015 UTC,"I have to say the Salarian Engineer. I've found ways to make all the other classes good in some form, but the SE is just bad. Incinerate is a decent power that a thousand classes have and make better use of. Energy Drain is a pretty awful power, only useful for tech explosions situationally (only primes or detonated when it gives you shields) and doing terribly weak shield damage. Its virtue is temporary damage resistance...but that only works when stealing shields, and I'd much rather be able to kill things efficiently than be able to die slightly less quickly, and there are other powers that do damage resistance better (cough cough volus mercenary shield boost). ED is only a good power on the infiltrator. Decoy is effective against geth and Cerberus, which means it's always useful on platinum, but the volus sentinel is so much more fun and laser-focused on being a pet and stagger monster -- and being a volus with cloak and shield boost, he's better designed for those powers -- so I would always rather use him if I'm looking for a decoy. Much more synergy there than a decoy and two mediocre powers.  You can always just slap a Wraith with incendiary IV ammo and detonate FEs with incinerate, but where's the fun or originality in that?"
MECoOp,3db4fx,cymikelee,0,Thu Jul 16 21:55:26 2015 UTC,"The ex-cerberus vanguard. The adept is good, but lash and smash just do not go with the charge. You end up with a low health character always in between cooldowns, aka dead."
MECoOp,3db4fx,sindeloke,5,Wed Jul 15 03:09:06 2015 UTC,"I actually like the Vanguard better than the Adept, preferably on host of course.  Smash is one of the most amazing burst damage powers in the game, and I feel like you just have to be up close and personal to use it (along with its weaker cousin, the lash melee).  I find the Adept too squishy to use Smash consistently (wallhack not always available), versus the shield refill granted by Charge, and while yeah, you can sit at a distance and get BEs with Singularity + Lash, there are so much better characters to do that with."
MECoOp,3db4fx,Moorebetter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:14:35 2015 UTC,"He's a really fun melee vanguard. His AoE works as a kind of discount Nova, staggering to keep you alive and kill mooks while Smashing through walls quickly eliminates bosses."

The ability to smash through walls especially if you use the geth scanner is amazing. You can do the same with the slayer, but his biotic slash windup will nudge him out of cover not to mention biotic slash cannot be aimed up or down unlike smash, not to mention he can't detonate his own explosions like the cerbguard. The novaguard and kroguard is more noob friendly and will breeze through lower difficulties when you're still learning the game, but on higher difficulties they will struggle against anything not geth/have sync kills."
MECoOp,3db4fx,Chypsylon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"The novaguard is just better. You get all the power of the ex cerberus, plus has nova canceling which gives him the ability to tank any attack, and not lose any health."
MECoOp,3db4fx,cymikelee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:38:07 2015 UTC,But the novaguard has pretty low damage against bosses. You kinda need teammates priming for you to detonate. Smash does good damage on its own.

Here's a video of the sentinel in action.  The basic human soldier is often forgotten for their more flashy counterparts like the destroyer or geth trooper.  Or for the straight up bad ass turian.  Concussive shot and cryo ammo also seem to be ignored by most of the players.  The batarian is also ignored by most players but I think his toughness makes up for the poorer powers he has.  Shockwave can nicely detonate everything and offers good crowd control along with submission net.  He pairs well with any fine shotgun."

In the lobby people will think you're just playing a typical flowchart harrier/hurricane spammer unless they look carefully at your loadout and gear. Then you get in game and they watch as you just jetpack around delivering the chokeslam of justice to every enemy mook on the battlefield. Particularly awesome against Cerberus as the cloak > overload > heavy melee combo fully kills every single health-based enemy, even phantoms. It's so fucking satisfying to do to phantoms.  And then of course when things get a little too hot to get in there and chokeslam stuff, oh hey look at that you're also playing a ghost with a harrier and hurricane, go figure.

No Dark Orb, Seeker Swarm spec'd to provide damage reduction and a 4th seeker giving 40% reduction while active, Dark Channel spec'd how ever you want, all Vengeful Ancient into weapon/headshot damage, and all Ancient Warrior into health/shields. Use a Collector weapon or the Particle Beam for the bonus damage from VA.  This was my first and still most consistent Platinum character. Since you'll only ever be actively using Dark Channel and since DC can only be active on one enemy at a time you can go as heavy on Collector weapons as you can, though I'd recommend the Particle Beam or Sniper either together or one with the SMG as backup. With LV 3 or 4 Flame/Warp rounds on the Particle Beam, plus Dark Channel you absolutely melt any Platinum boss out there. With shield gear plus the 40% DR from your swarms (which you should keep active 99% of the time except in dire situations) you become an absolute tank while still having the super mobile flying dodge move.  I'd highly recommend trying this setup out for those that have the Collector (plus Collector weapons for maximum effect) and have only ever run with Dark Orb builds."
MECoOp,3d9t6s,EsplodingBomb,2,Tue Jul 14 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"I second this particular build, it's one of my most reliable platinum builds, I make sure my dark channel has the rank 6 bonus to barriers and armor, with that you are sure to completely deplete a phantom's barriers while you have to make a retreat for any reason. This insures that by the time to settle into your next fallback location, the phantom is barrier-less and a portion of her health is cut too.  Same for Banshees, if you have to retreat, it insures a good portion of their barriers is gone (if not all) and prevents it from regenerating between engagements.  This should also be effective against a dragoon as well, at least softening them up."

You haven't LIVED until you've tried this beautiful uppercut machine.  Here's how my very first wave trying this build went:  3 Cannibals, 2 Marauders spawn.  Maybe some Husks too. Sprint, cloak, uppercut. BAM.  Cannibal #1 goes flying. Uppercut.  BAM.  Cannibal #2 sails away.  Martial Artist activated. Uppercut.  BAM!  Marauder #1 one-shotted. Uppercut.  BAM!  Marauder #2 enters the stratosphere. Uppercut.  BAM!  Poor Cannibal #3 achieves escape velocity.  All this within about 2 seconds.  I don't think I've ever wrecked single targets faster, even with the Fury.  And it's impossible to stop giggling with glee as everything just catches air with you dancing around delivering that wicked omnipunch of destruction.  In the later waves, say, on Gold?  Find a ramp and let your teammates watch as you play Juggerlord tanking everything and kickboxing away at Banshees and Geth Primes.  Take the melee evo on TC, keep Snap Freeze for debuff, then set up the rest as you see fit.  Repair Matrix makes up for the squishiness of other melee builds.  So far I've done this with a Wraith + Omniblade, though I could see good arguments for the Acolyte for shield strip (and OHK even without Martial Artist or on Pyros maybe?) and Venom for stagger.  And that's the scary part, I don't think I've even perfected this build.  Try it!  You'll never want to reset your AIU back to the overplayed Reegar cheese build.  I know I won't."

I tried actually shooting things with it, and it was pretty abysmal (specced for max fire rate/weapon damage). It took a burst or two to the head to kill an assault trooper, Phantoms were a pain to kill without getting staggered, and Centurions took a while to kill unless you got clean bursts to the head. I'm about 99% certain you'd get better results from using it with Incen/Cryo ammo and spamming Proxy/Conc Shot for weak FEs/raw CS damage."

I definitely prefer the Scimitar Destroyer because of the better DPS, which is kinda what I expected. The Shuriken performed slightly better than expected, but Marksman just didn't help as much as I had hoped. For Turian Solder, I went for max fire-rate and then accuracy, skiping Concussive shot. For Destoyer, I skipped the Hawk Missile Launcher and on Destoyer Mode went shields, RoF, Damage. Played against Cerberus and Geth."
MECoOp,3d6xfy,AJockeysBallsack,4,Tue Jul 14 01:51:05 2015 UTC,If you call not last good results.  I was basically giggling the whole game about how bad the Shuriken was.  My loadouts were pretty much the same and I came away with much the same opinion - the Scimitar wins.
MECoOp,3d6xfy,FinalFate,2,Tue Jul 14 02:18:12 2015 UTC,"Just played a silver match for Destroyer/Scimitar. I went a similar build path with 6/5/3/6/6. DM with ABB, Hawk Missile AA, damage passives and shield passives.  the results  I put smart choke and HVB on the Scimitar and went with shock trooper gear and explosive rounds 3. I actually liked the surprisingly high rate of fire on it. It made cleaning up husks and cannibals easy."
MECoOp,3d7jcn,Moorebetter,10,Tue Jul 14 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"Human sentinel, all day every day since day 1. Hell, since whenever I made my 3rd ME2 sentinel character was. With incendiary ammo he is the ultimate fusion of biotics and tech. Even before all that crazy shit came about in the later days of the game, throw has always been the coolest power. You're not killing people with a gun, you're killing them with Newton's Third Law of Motion. You're basically slinging mini-vanguards at enemies every 1.3 seconds and tossing them left and right, knocking them into walls or off ledges or sending them sailing them through the air if they're above you.  And you're doing it all while wearing motherfucking hologram computer armor to overclock your biotic amp beyond anyone else's plebian stock parameters.  Seriously though, few if any other classes can so effortlessly get a 25 tech kills and 25 biotic kills medal in a standard gold game. Acolyte > throw completely devastates entire squads of shielded enemies in single-digit timespans and is the single fastest way to set off fire explosions in the entire game, and then you've got 100% boosted BEs to wreck bosses and any mooks unfortunate enough to be near them's shit. Oh, and once you've taken out their shields in like 3 acolyte shots you switch to your hurricane and pile up that warp/incendiary damage on them while setting off your BEs.  When considering both actual gameplay potential combined with cool factor simultaneously, I don't think there's any other class who can be said to excel so hard in both categories. You can fuck the scoreboard's shit up and look like a total fucking badass instead of just doing typical gun-based gameplay or spamming reegar or grenades at everything."
MECoOp,3d7jcn,ginja_ninja,3,Tue Jul 14 06:45:15 2015 UTC,"just a note: the 50% on throw and warp are multiplicative, so a Warp/Throw combo deals a little over 2.5 times the damage of an unupgraded combo.  source: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ma7qipEj9Xyo0EuqDlS6Uubuk5ImKnApELTKaIn-x9s/edit#gid=0"

Once you get the hang of charging another acolyte shot as soon as you let go of the first it turns into complete robot genocide.  If you're wondering what the exact build is, looks like this.

MECoOp,3d7jcn,ginja_ninja,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:16:13 2015 UTC,Yeah the fury was basically a derivative of the human sentinel. The main difference is you can choose which range you want to engage at instead of feeling like you're not being optimal anywhere outside of annihilation field's radius. Also your biotic explosions are significantly stronger and warp meshes a lot better with biotic teammates than dark channel.

MECoOp,3d7jcn,briefcandle,4,Tue Jul 14 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"For me it's undoubtedly the N7 Destroyer. You're playing in a time period where biotics and technology rule the galaxy and in times of warfare, devastate the opposition.  But then comes along the N7 Destroyer, the perfect unification between man and machine. He doesn't need any fancy tech powers like incinerate or any finesse in biotics like warp. Nay, he comes with true and blue reliable weapons and an attitude to ruin someone's day.  Acolyte an enemy with shields? incinerate foes that have heavy armor? Please. With enough bullets, he can burn through those measly obstacles faster than NASCAR vehicles burn through rubber. And my, do those bullets pack quite the punch.  The best part? There's hardly any situation where he has disadvantages. Seeker swarms are no issue, staggers are meaningless, and can be surprisingly maneuverable if need be.  Any weapon in the game has the potential to be amazing in the right hands. He just happens to have the right hands for everything."

Most of the time I can out-stagger dragoons and sometimes phantoms with it too. I don't put any points in hawk missiles cause -50% shields is bad. The lack of move speed forces me to me more aware of enemies locations and to use cover / RHA more. The most annoying part is kiting banshees / praetorians but once they stop dashing I can gun them down pretty quick.   I like to run 2 heavy weapons; Widow/Valiant/Claymore/Piranha + Revenant, or sometimes replace with a different AR like the Harrier, Argus, Lancer, or Particle Rifle."

Add some incendiary ammo, and none of the smaller enemies (on Gold, anyway) will survive a Cryo Blast>Acolyte>Incinerate combo. Armored bosses go down surprisingly fast. She's deadly close up or at range. She slows, staggers, debuffs. And she's got a little turret friend to pad her DPS, run interference, attack around corners, etc."
MECoOp,3d7jcn,timoleon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, using the Acolyte on her (to cover her only weakness) is a lot like using it on the Throwslinger, only you're freezing/burning things simultaneously with that shield strip.

Gotta get close enough to do damage, but not too close. Explody biotics.  AIU - Nice Dodge, Goes down but doesn't die, Great at rezzing people, gets close enough to kiss the enemy.

Yes please. It's also worth noting that he's tied with the N7 Demolisher for the highest power damage passive in the game.  Geth Juggernaut is so much of a go-to for me that I haven't played it on anything lower than platinum for months. It's what I use when I think I'll have to carry or when I want to play a platinum and not have to try. The other day I played a Cerberus Plat game with 3 Jugs and a Harrier Geth Infiltrator. I outscored the GI, and not because he isn't good. the GI was somebody I regularly play plat and gold with.  Quarian Male Engineer is my Tech Combo BFF. I slap the Harrier on him so I have a good way to deal with most enemies when powers are on cooldown, I'm out of nades, or a Phantom pops its bubble. The large radius of Arc Grenades helps too.  Turian Sentinel: recently found the one weapon that makes him truly click for me. With the Arc Pistol, I can top score plat with this guy. You've all heard about what good utility he has. Both biotic and tech detonators and primers, shield stripping, armor reduction, enemy debuffing, plus DR and great weapon passives. Add a lightweight headshot machine and go to town.  Asari Huntress: Who doesn't love being able to kill a Gold Banshee with a simple Warp -> Cloak -> Dark Channel? Add some warp ammo and biotic combos on top of that and it's one of my go-to plat classes.  Vanguards: eh, I don't really have a vanguard that I play regularly on platinum, but the Slayer, KroGuard, and Phoenix SmashGuard are my top vanguards. Slayer has the best way of any vanguard to avoid sync kills and destroy armor. KroGuard gives no fucks what's shooting at it, so long as it can't be sync killed. SmashGuard is just fun for me to use with Charge -> Heavy Melee cycles and an occasional Smash through a wall."

Its stats tell me it should be amazing, DPS wise, but something about the way it fires, combined with how the zoom is, makes me unable to hit the broad side of a Brute.  Eagle mainly because it's an Ultra Rare. Even when it's maxed it's unremarkable. If it was a rare, then it'd be ok, but since it's got a million credit price tag, very few people have it maxed out. That means most people who have the Eagle at all just have a heavy pistol that deals mediocre damage. Pass. (EDIT: by 'heavy pistol' i mean 'pistol that is heavy' as opposed to 'a pistol in the Heavy Pistol class of weapons')  Scimitar. Its damage is just too low. I can't bear to use it on anything higher than bronze without a bunch of consumables on it. Feels like the Avenger of Shotguns. I'd much rather use the Katana.   Revenant. It's speed reduction just isn't worth the damage output. If the damage was a smidge higher or the recoil was a touch less, it would be ok, but I just don't have enough equipment slots to attach an Adrenaline Module, Stabilization Module, and Assault Rifle Rail Amp every time I want to use something like an LMG.

Go to Silver (or Bronze if you usually play silver), attach a Power Magnifier to your Acolyte, and alternate between Acolyte and Incinerate. Still works pretty well.

The 55% weapon stability bonus makes it so that even when shooting from one side of the Reactor to the other, you can get all three shots in an Assault Trooper's torso by aiming initially for the chest, instead of the crotch. It might also be because of where I instinctively aim, but I get a decent number of headshots this way. If you really want to go for headshots with it, just throw on a Stabilization Module. The other nice thing about the Incisor is the low weight.

Saber: That electronic sound that you get when you fire (and not when teammates fire) just makes me think of the crosshair bloom and makes me feel I'm not getting the punch I know this thing is supposed to be capable of dealing. Paladin: Way too quiet and understated for something with the stopping power of a Valiant. Raptor/Hornet: I actually don't mind these (the latter with a stability mod), but they just sound like I'm chirping at my enemies rather than firing a gun at them.   Also... I actually like the Talon and CSMG a lot but they would be so much more badass if they sounded the way they did when your squadmates are using them instead of you.

MECoOp,3d49oe,Moorebetter,2,Tue Jul 14 03:03:49 2015 UTC,but the Indra is a completely different mode of weapon than the Mantis. The Indra is more akin to an Assault Rifle with little kick that comes with a scope already on it.
MECoOp,3d49oe,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:11:53 2015 UTC,"But, it gets the sniper boost from cloak, reloads manually super quick, is fairly light, and beats out the widow in dps"

I learned a lot along the way. I transitioned to Silver, where both good and bad players frolic, and I was intent on not being a scrub. That meant I had to work hard on finding a flow between running, shooting, taking cover, using powers, running away some more. In short, putting out that DPS and not dying. Sometimes I sucked, and still do in some matches. But I tried to learn from my mistakes. The Asari, Turians and Salarians each had their own rhythm. Along the way, I achieved the AR, Pistol, Reaper and Collector banners. There were a few lessons. One was, that ending third or bottom on the score board is fine. Often, the top two guys either die a lot (scrappy, but reliant on lots of revives), or not at all (l33t). I had to learn ""situational awareness"", and to back up a bit - sooner, rather than later (Collectors ...) I got to do a few over-cover grabs (yay!). The Acolyte and Geth Scanner have been my boon companions  throughout. I have learned to appreciate a really good team (flawless extractions, with only a couple rockets spent on deserving targets), and to cope with bad teams (wiping on wave 6 objectives after running out of consumables) by blaming sheer coincidence, lag and bad decision making - myself included. Now I'm gonna take a break, and come back for the Monster banner. Look out for a scrub coming to a Gold match near you."

MECoOp,3d2fr8,Scarecrow1779,3,Tue Jul 14 02:43:01 2015 UTC,"I've been going ham on my PC account again, got a surprising amount of URs over the week, expecting a dry spell soon.  As for the rants, it's the usual suspects: high N7, high CP players who come in and proceed to be super super super shitty. A whole lot of dying in asinine places and not gelling, or baiting a whole bunch of pugs over to a location and not gelling until one of them has gotten synced trying to rescue. Also asstons of overload spamming, Harrier X TGIs, and Reegar AIUs (maybe 1 in the 12 or so I saw was actually any good).   Definitely two standouts though:   1) Reactor central hack on LZ console, N7 5k plus with event banner, Asari Huntress BW X. She had the gall to actually get on mic and berate us for not running to the other side of the reactor to pick her up after she sat there rocketing Atlases onto herself over and over again.   2) N7 15k, event banner. Level 15 Human Adept, insists on overwriting my Asari Justicar's primers with his little singularity over and over and over again, rather than risk detonating my stuff- even on my reaves, not just my bubbles. He seems to pointedly not pick up dead pugs, even when one bleeds out right next to him as he's setting up more low level explosions. Since it's just Reapers/White/Gold it's no biggie- with the help of the Drell Adept we're fine. Singularity guy's oddly specific attempt at score battling backfires and he's in third.   Since I feel like I'm stepping on toes by priming so much I decide to switch to the Asari Commando Adept to spam throws... And suddenly nobody wants to prime anything. Being London/Geth/Gold and everyone wants to camp one of the lower boxes for some reason, things get really ugly really fast. Mr 15k bails, things go downhill, wave 10 wipe device hack."

I didn't really need the galactic readiness, but I deployed all I could anyways. Just that small interaction makes the game that much more immersive for me.  I'd also like to make a overdone PSA stating how ridiculous the N7 Paladin Sentinel is. The N7 Paladin is ridiculous. The Mass Effect wiki has it right when it states the Paladin ""has an effective response to any enemy in the game"" in the player notes.

Next I need to learn to use powers to cancel with the Widow on a Stasis Sniper. I guess this is half boast, half thanks for the posts on here that let me know I could use powers to reload cancel while they're on cooldown.

I generally try to play with friends in the evenings because at that time of the day I tend to run into European or Russian hosts and that usually (though not always) results in very laggy games for me.  When I play late-morning to early-afternoon I get more American hosts and it's actually not too bad with them, for the most part.  It could also be that, as you mentioned, I am just accustomed to laggy matches because sometimes I think I do better with lag than without! :P  Feel free to add me if you want another Australian to play with. :)  I play mostly silver and gold."

MECoOp,3d0jnv,Mister__Sparkle,37,Sun Jul 12 14:15:57 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: is my own opinion and may not reflect opinion of community as a whole.  Best:    Diversity of play-styles and builds that are available because of all the classes and weapons that were built in to the multiplayer.  How teamwork is almost mandatory for success, especially when new to the MP. This combined with the multitude of ways different classes interact with each other is a big part of what's kept me playing. The Community.   Worst:   Off Host Lag crippling or severely handicapping many classes and playstyles. Sync-killing makes a lot of melee styles unplayable against factions other than Geth. Also acts as a severe handicap for classes without dodges (no way to dodge away from that Banshee that just teleported through a wall or Phantom that's trying to stagger-lock you). Hope you like the grind of spending 1000 hrs to get all your weapons maxed. Welcome to RNG Hell. There are a lot of bugs that aren't so bad on their own, but they kick you or freeze your system in game. When combined with the fact that you aren't awarded credits until the end of wave 11 and these bugs cause you to gain nothing from your effort, the game can get rather frustrating.    EDIT: oh yeah, also insert a rant about Phantoms here. Seriously. Fuck Phantoms."
MECoOp,3d0jnv,Scarecrow1779,7,Sun Jul 12 15:15:16 2015 UTC,Off Host Lag crippling or severely handicapping many classes and playstyles.   How many Vanguards have died mashing desperately their charge button without effect?  How many Banshees and Praetorians suddenly grabbed you from what seemed a safe distance?  How often have you spent an Ops Pack just to watch your corpse crumple to the floor surrounded by a blue glow?
MECoOp,3d0jnv,timoleon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:56:02 2015 UTC,"ya, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. there are many powers that are severely slowed down due to latency, such as Phase Disruptor, Siege Pulse, and Submission net so that they are much less effective. the non-hitscan guns also become more difficult to use with increasing lag. The Turian Soldier Striker build I like to use sometimes on Silver becomes useless if i'm not host or don't have the best connection to host ever."
MECoOp,3d0jnv,Scarecrow1779,27,Mon Jul 13 09:10:10 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that it's co-op rather than PvP is the best feature. It keeps the immersion with single player, which would be broken if you could play as the reapers.  Worst is obviously the stingy RNG store, that really goes without saying. Total play time of 746 hours (31 days) and I still haven't maxed my weapons manifest."
MECoOp,3d0jnv,WibblyWib,10,Sun Jul 12 15:25:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think Bioware put a lot of thought into the dilution effect of adding so many weapons / classes to the game.  The drop rates were more reasonable (albeit still low) in the context of the content originally released with the game.  But by diluting the market with new items with every DLC, it became much harder for newer players to get specific UR drops.  1000 hours to max a manifest is crazy.  As a basis for comparison, Destiny bumped up their exotic drop rates with the last DLC.  I hope Bioware follows a similar model for the next ME game."
MECoOp,3d0jnv,InterwebNinja,3,Sun Jul 12 22:12:51 2015 UTC,"You're right about that. It would have been so easy for them to just increase the drop rate as well, like they did on the N7 weekends."

Their DPS isn't insane enough to warrant UR status and having fewer URs and more Rares would make the hours-to-maxed way less.   or they could have just increased the UR drop rate from 7.5% to something more reasonable like 12.5 or 15%."
MECoOp,3d0jnv,Scarecrow1779,6,Mon Jul 13 19:30:25 2015 UTC,Completely agree about the fact that the game is co-op rather than pvp. Not so much about the immersion aspect (although now that I think about it I can see your point with that) but more about the fact that good co-op games are few and far between whereas pvp games are everywhere. It's so good to have a really good quality co-op game to play.
MECoOp,3d0jnv,EllairaJayd,5,Mon Jul 13 07:35:47 2015 UTC,"Re: immersion, I think there's a ton more they could've done with that, like having you actually jump off the shuttle (they did it in SP, it couldn't have been that hard in MP), and the fact that there's no physical manifestation of the lobby I feel hamstrings both the immersion and the social aspects of the game a bit.  It'd be so cool for teams to get their own shuttle bay before the match... and have a chance to interact, besides fighting together, in a way that's not heavy meleeing each other and dodge-spamming in between waves."
MECoOp,3d0jnv,cymikelee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:38:28 2015 UTC,"I think having everyone climb into a shuttle at extraction would have been a cool mechanic. You only get extracted if you complete the animation of mounting the shuttle platform. Then you turn around and provide covering fire for your teammates who still need to climb in. If you go down in the shuttle, you still extract, but lose the ability to provide cover fire. Have the shuttle show up at 2 mins into wave 11 and have it 'leave' at 2 min 20 seconds. In other words at 2'20'', the round ends and if you weren't in the shuttle then you didn't extract."
MECoOp,3d0jnv,Scarecrow1779,5,Mon Jul 13 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"agreed. if it was PvP, balancing would be a lot more of an issue and that would have cut WAY down on the variety in the game."
MECoOp,3d0jnv,Scarecrow1779,13,Sun Jul 12 15:40:02 2015 UTC,"Best: extreme quantity of/variety between classes and playstyles is what gives the game its staying power and keeps things from getting stale.  Worst:   Poor/nonexistent lag compensation makes powers classes basically unplayable on >150-200 ping hosts, no regional matchmaking system exacerbates this issue. Primer layering system means optimal combos can get blocked by people spamming weaker primers over them. Would like to see the next game have a more complex priority system driving primers, e.g. biotic detonators detonate a biotic primer first if the target is primed for both biotic and tech, primers with a combo damage bonus are not overridden by primers without one, etc. Phantoms are nigh-impervious to weapon damage while you're hosting a game.

MECoOp,3d0jnv,transmogrify,7,Sun Jul 12 19:24:49 2015 UTC,Best aspects:  Coop play.  Generally limited match length.  Loooooong challenge and unlock progression.  Cover in multiplayer.

MECoOp,3d0jnv,OrionTurtle,7,Sun Jul 12 22:26:18 2015 UTC,"Best    Variety: Love how there are so many different play styles, characters, powers and weapons.

Even If a team has no mic or communication, Teamwork seems to naturally, almost intuitively come about for most players which makes your wave 10 collector gold/platinum hack objective way more enjoyable.    Worst   When you're playing by yourself the un-dedicated servers can get to you. If you're not living in a main European/American time-zone/location you just have to learn to embrace the lag whilst playing random PUGs. Possessed Scions. The un-lock system for characters & guns is randomly generated.

MECoOp,3d0jnv,osamabinballer,5,Sun Jul 12 21:10:23 2015 UTC,"Mass Effect 3 Coop has to be the best horde style game outside of gears of War.     Classes are meaningful and the mechanics are deep so players really involved in the game can get a lot out of it. Maps have good balance of ranged and close quarter combat to cater to all play styles. Objective rounds break many strategies forcing players to adapt and be flexible Enemies get meaningfully harder, many games on harder difficulties introduce lots of cheese mechanics that make their game artificially hard.  ME3 does have the sync kills but besides that a good player can carry even on platinum by knowing the game mechanics and of course being skilled.    The bad:   Sync killing, it hinders certain gameplay styles and you feel nothing but cheated when you die too it.  Greedy player, the community is good for the most part but some players won't do objectives or be team players when its needed.  I myself am hyper competitive when I play always going for that top score but that means nothing if you fail to complete the run.  Support, the game did get a ton of new characters and maps for free but many bugs and glitches still exist. If you played within the first 8 months or so you were most likely had some of your packs eaten by the store glitch.  I myself lost 7 packs and it took customer service over a year to respond to my ticket."

It gets really annoying when my teammate needs to be revived next to a wall, and my character keeps taking cover against said wall, instead of reviving.   No typing. Sometimes I don't feel like using my mic, or I'm on Vent with a friend and playing the game on my own. Being able to type out simple messages or acknowledgements is really needed.   What's up with all the time needed when opening new crates?   Would love some new maps / missions sets.  The fucking grind fest.   Best:   It's co-op and not PVP.   So many different play styles and builds to chose from. It's a lot of fun pairing up with randoms / friends and finding new ways to synergize our characters.   The game itself is just A LOT of fun. Great to get on and just do a couple of missions back to back and kill some time. Or pair up with a few friends and work towards completing the harder missions."

MECoOp,3cxdvi,Scarecrow1779,4,Sat Jul 11 16:59:02 2015 UTC,"I wish there were Infiltrators that had Assassinate from ME1. Granted it's not TC (80% bonus damage on all weapons, 1.25x sniper rifle damage on most kits) but 225% sniper rifle damage on a Javelin would be quite nostalgic."
MECoOp,3cxdvi,RepublicanShredder,2,Sat Jul 11 18:37:17 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the Asari Engineer -- since as a race they have all these biotic capabilities, it'd make since their technology would evolve around synergizing with it.  I'd take some issue with how it's set up though -- the Warp Generator seems quite similar to the 6b evolution of the Justicar bubble, except that you get BE capability even at level 1.  My sense is that the Justicar is balanced by the fact it's difficult to set up those BEs (i.e., you have to get up close and personal, which in turn is balanced out by Reave's DR)... but here you have this godly drone that can detonate these things all by its lonesome.  If I were playing this character, I'd just set these two guys up as a pair and wander off with Warp + Warp Ammo to put out insane amounts of DPS.  I'm not sure how I'd balance this thing out... maybe if both the pylon and the drone used Warp (so that they can't self-detonate) but then the Engineer had something like Lash (or something less annoying) as the 3rd power to detonate?  At least to force the player to stay close by for maximum effectiveness?"
MECoOp,3cxdvi,cymikelee,2,Sun Jul 12 04:40:23 2015 UTC,"The shields on the drone means it wouldn't stay around for more than two or three detonations at most before it was destroyed. As for the comparison to Biotic Bubble, the difference is there are no bonuses to teammates. That's why I made it stronger on the offensive side than Biotic Bubble. I also intended to give it a wider radius than Annihilation Field since you can't move the Generator around as easily as a field focused around the caster. The other difference between Biotic Bubble and the Biotic Field Generator is that Biotic Bubble can detonate combos, where the Generator can't.   I agree though that this build is possibly overpowered, hence all the possible balance possibilities like decreasing the area of the Generator. I think the drone is less powerful than you think though. I see the Drone detonating a lot of nothing half the time because it doesn't know to preferentially attack primed targets.  I would also point out that because Warp is given to the player, the most powerful biotic explosions this class can make involve the player being present. Any combo that is made by the drone and generator will be less powerful (with, at most, a 15% damage and 50% area buff). Hopefully this encourages the player to stick around to try to make more powerful combos. This could still result in an overpowered-ly fast series of biotic explosions, but I think that would take a decent bit of skill and coordination on the part of the player and still wouldn't be more than the DPS of classes like the Slayer, KroLord, and Talon Mercenary.  Just to reiterate: you're worried about the exact same things with this class that I am."

MECoOp,3cxdvi,Moorebetter,2,Sat Jul 11 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, I read it wrong. Still, if a infiltrator doesn't have cloak (eventhough that's what you're going for) it's still a soldier."

MECoOp,3cxdvi,RepublicanShredder,3,Sat Jul 11 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"I think the point he was trying to make was TC isn't/shouldn't be as over-defining of a power for an Infiltrator like how Biotic Charge is for Vanguards. Even with that, the Cabal has Poison Strike, which is similar in role but not identical to Biotic Charge."
MECoOp,3cxdvi,Rubberblock,3,Sat Jul 11 20:11:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Also like how Tech Armor was for Sentinels until the DLCs made the Paladin and Volus Mercenary. The idea that a Sentinel has to have Tech Armor, an Infiltrator has to have Cloak, and Vanguards have to have Biotic Charge gets in the way of some really original and enjoyable combinations."
MECoOp,3cxdvi,Mazhiwe,2,Sat Jul 11 21:02:42 2015 UTC,"This is true, and it worked for the cabal, but a infiltrator in me3 has so many proporites of other classes, that the only thing that sets them aside is cloak."
MECoOp,3cxdvi,Mazhiwe,2,Sun Jul 12 01:56:47 2015 UTC,"Do you have a counterpoint for Tech Armor and Sentinels? It's a defining power yet almost half of them lack it (although it's kinda made up in other areas).   Likewise, how about the two grenade-heavy engineers the N7 Demolisher and the Talon Mercenary? Their reliance on grenades make them quite different from the rest."
MECoOp,3cw09u,gilgamesh_v9,9,Sat Jul 11 06:17:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's actually the opposite. Your weapons will absolutely suck for ages when you first start playing, trapping you on Bronze and Silver and limiting your understanding of boss combat and probably your general level of fun, but a level 20 human or turian sent is gold-viable out of the box. Plus powers track.  It's much easier to learn the maps and to pick up the basics of combos and how different enemies behave when that's all you have to focus on, as opposed to also trying to learn to headshot and when to reload and how to avoid getting hit by an enemy that isn't staggered by powers and keeps coming at you because you don't have the dps to actually kill it before it kills you."
MECoOp,3cw09u,sindeloke,7,Sat Jul 11 08:00:09 2015 UTC,"agreed. power use makes the game go around when you first start playing. I didn't realize this and was really stunted in my growth because I stayed in my comfort zone (soldier on bronze) for a long time because without powers and better weapons I got crushed any time I tried silver. When I got just good enough equipment to start venturing into Silver was when I started to have to push myself to think more strategically, and that meant not using a soldier. If I had gotten away from using a soldier faster or simply started with another class, I would have gotten an understanding of many game mechanics, such as combos, much faster.   However, I really like OP's way of looking at the game and how it applies to new players. Great post."

However, there is a difference between viability and what I'm discussing here. Vorcha classes are great teachers of how to choose your engagement so that you still have bloodlust stacks but don't get bursted down, and you'll be a better player if you learn how to do that. I'm also not in a hurry to take a vorcha in to any gold runs though."
MECoOp,3cw09u,Comb-the-desert,2,Sat Jul 11 13:26:51 2015 UTC,"Why not? With flamer and health regeneration I have found Vorcha one of the easiest classes to get used to Gold with. If you use right-hand rule with flamer you can torch pretty much anything in the game very very well, and whichever class has the cluster grenades just multiplies the damage even more. Given that they are really tough to kill I think you might want to reconsider how viable Vorcha are for gold"

MECoOp,3csztk,xeqtioner0,23,Fri Jul 10 15:16:54 2015 UTC,Early on the powers and class you pick are going to be much more important than your guns. Soldiers will be your weakest class until you unlock some rare guns.

MECoOp,3csztk,cymikelee,12,Fri Jul 10 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"Here's basically the way co-op works in terms of enjoyment.  Power-based classes (like the Krogan Warlord or Human Sentinel) don't really require anything apart for enough skill points to do stuff. You get this after playing three or four matches with them. They don't need guns to deal damage. They just need powers and combo detonations.  Gun-based classes require you to not only have decent weapons, but decent weapons upgraded to a relatively high level. You get this after hours of grinding and blood sacrifices to the RNG.   Now, if I recall correctly, most gun-based classes can be played as slightly less powerful (and often less entertaining) power based classes, but I've found that as a general rule guns tend to supplement powers rather than the other way around. This might be because I have atrocious aim, resulting in around 40-50% effective DPS, but that's just what I've observed personally.  So, yes. Until RNG sees fit to reward you with decent mods and a decent lineup of guns, power classes are the way to go. You don't even need to rely on RNG for good power classes; the default human Sentinel or Adept are very solid. But to give you an example of how big a factor RNG is... I've sunk like sixty or seventy hours into it. I still don't have a piercing mod for assault rifles.  To tie up this rambling post, the unlock system is freaking awful, perhaps the worst I've ever seen. But the rest of it, bugs and lag-related issues aside, is amazing. Have fun with your new Krolord. I know I do."

If you click the ""Mass Effect Coop College"" link on the sidebar there's a bunch of useful stuff on weapons, powers, and all sorts of mechanics that help a lot to know about."
MECoOp,3csztk,cymikelee,2,Fri Jul 10 16:28:48 2015 UTC,"My human engy is one of my two ""main"" characters, if you could call it that.  It's really great hanging out at mid range, spamming Incinerate -> Overload (for Fire Explosion), with an exploding Combat Drone for supplemental DPS while shooting whatever reasonably accurate pistol/SMG in between.  It's one of the kits I'm able to post good scores with, so it's definitely no slouch even when you're just starting out!"
MECoOp,3csztk,LasersAndRobots,4,Fri Jul 10 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"You start with a human version of all five classes. The human Soldier is a gun-based class, so forget it for the moment. Human Adepts and Sentinels are power-based classes that are excellent at crowd control (Sentinel less so) and making things explode via combo detonations (which is a mechanic you would very much benefit from looking into).  The human Vanguard deserves a special mention on its own. Off-host, it's unplayable (which really applies for every Vanguard class). On-host, it's unbelievable. Spec it right, and the combination of Biotic Charge and Nova just kills everything. You don't even need to bother putting points into Shockwave. 'Course, you need to worry about sync-kills, but play it safe and you'll be fine. Expect to begin topping scoreboards with it after it reaches Level 14 or so.  As for pros and cons of each weapon, I'm not sure. Every weapon has a ""Player Notes"" section on the Mass Effect wiki, which I think is as close as you're going to get. Mostly, there are just guns that flat-out suck and guns that are really good. The Avenger is a gun that sucks; meanwhile, this subreddit's favourite seems to be the Cerberus Harrier, an Ultra-Rare that you'll probably only see from time to time carried by other players."

I also processed this at 100 FPS which I realize isn't a standard rate, but it made the numbers work out.  I'd be interested in knowing if the frame rate issues stem from the game rounding delays up to a whole number of frames, leading to the delay between shots becoming longer.

If you're looking for a good class to spend some time with while you wade through the item boxes give it a try.  You definitely need to be hosting, but once you get the hang of it you can solo the first few waves (most of the game, really) of bronze and silver. You barely even need to shoot so don't worry about your weapon. Hack circles and drones are a bit boring but other than that you're fine.  It'll get a bit annoying if you're trying to play with another vanguard or another melee class though. Krogan are especially irritating because they get in your way and as a novaguard if you stop moving you die, pretty much. Makes it interesting though!"

The Warlord is simply a character that tramples over weaker enemies.  You get massive damage reduction, huge healing, and you 1-shot pretty much everything, especially on Bronze.  Once you start getting to harder difficulties, the enemies become harder to kill in just one light/charging melee.  There will also be more enemies that can insta-kill you, which severely punishes the Warlord's slower movements.  There are some classes that can be ""just overpowered,"" but it all depends on your difficulty, build, weapons, etc.  On Bronze, the Warlord just doesn't have quite as many weaknesses as other characters."

MECoOp,3csztk,caesar_primus,2,Fri Jul 10 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"First off, the Avenger (and I'm assuming you had it at rank I or something close) is utter trash. I'm a bit biased because I utterly HATE the gun, but even in bronze you're gonna have a bad time with it. (side note, earning the M-8 Avenger Use Challenge was utter pain) Luckily I got the Phaeston in one of my first packs, so that helped a lot. Leveled up some of the classes and got a feel for the game and started unlocking more and more classes, equipment and weapons.  And yes, you really do start out weak in multiplayer, especially this late after all the maps, mods, guns etc are all available.  Now, the Krogan Warlord was added in much later to ME3's multiplayer and right out of the gate it's a beast, esp on Bronze/Silver where you can just run up to mobs and pound them to death with the hammer-o-doom.  As for waterguns, yea the Avenger is one. But some of the other basic guns are quite good, like the Mattock (if you can get used to using a semi-automatic gun). And don't despair, the Mantis is still a perfectly viable sniper until you get better ones"
MECoOp,3csztk,cymikelee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:54:20 2015 UTC,"Once you max it, the Avenger X isn't half bad on a power class -- it's light, accurate, and user friendly.  I used it on my first Gold game and it turned out okay."

Since the TGI isn't terribly cooldown dependent, I have to imagine it'd be better in just about every way (but with similar mechanics).  Plus you get the added bonus of it being a Turian weapon so you stay ""in-character."""
MECoOp,3csztk,werewolf_nr,3,Sat Jul 11 01:53:08 2015 UTC,"TGI isn't terribly cooldown dependent,   Cloak cd isn't affected by weight, so it is completely independent of cooldown.    For me, the important part was top scoring a match with a common weapon.  Using a better weapon defeats the purpose."
MECoOp,3csztk,UpsetLobster,0,Sat Jul 11 03:25:50 2015 UTC,I think the Avenger and the Katana are the best of the common weapons.
MECoOp,3csztk,cymikelee,2,Fri Jul 10 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"It would be helpful if you excited your flair to have your platform and name so we could look up your unlocks to help give you advice.  That being said, there is a ton of RNG that can make out break your first few packs. It is also worth noting that the multiplayer difficulties are about 1.5 steps higher than the single player ones.  Even the lower tier weapons become better as they rank up. The Avenger X still sees occasional use on some of my classes (moded for range and carried by adepts)."
MECoOp,3csztk,Moorebetter,2,Sat Jul 11 00:17:32 2015 UTC,"The Krogan Warlord is not broken, its actually balanced for the higher difficulties as it came out late in the game's history.   You said you got a crusader, that will do you wonders with an infiltrator as a shotgun sniping machine.  But mostly, power classes are the key to bootstrapping yourself to the point your guns get OP."
MECoOp,3csztk,othellothewise,2,Sat Jul 11 00:41:17 2015 UTC,"My suggestion to the OP would be to feel free to try higher difficulties with the Warlord, while working out the kinks with other classes on Bronze.  The higher the difficulty you can handle, the more economical it gets credits-wise (about 16k per Bronze match, 33-34k per Silver, and 80k+ per Gold if you extract).  That way you can get your inventory upgraded faster to give you more options."
MECoOp,3csztk,letominor,2,Sat Jul 11 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"There is definitely a tier list of characters, but at the very beginning of the game, it's way more obvious."
MECoOp,3csztk,captainconway,2,Sat Jul 11 02:12:54 2015 UTC,"The avenger is surprisingly (for a common weapon) half decent if you play it with the right class (infiltrators or the turian soldier).  But in answer to your question, damage kind of depends on how well you combine classes and weapons together. Infiltrators, for example, have ridiculous damage boosts from cloak. When you shoot with an infiltrator always cloak before. Try giving a shotgun infiltrator a try. The turian soldier is another easy to unlock class that makes any automatic weapon good. With caster classes put a light weapon on them and do some biotic or tech combos.  As for weapons there are some good uncommon weapons. The Phaeston is decent, and the mattock rocks everything. When you start unlock rares things start getting interesting especially on the shotgun side. The claymore is an amazing shotgun (especially with an infiltrator class) and the Reegar carbine has the highest DPS in the game. Unfortunately for sniper rifles the best ones are ultra-rare. The Mantis is quite decent and the Widow (rare) is pretty amazing, but ultra-rare has the Black Widow, the Valiant, and the Javelin (the hardest hitting single shot in the game)."
MECoOp,3csw8m,BeforeTheRobots,8,Fri Jul 10 14:38:18 2015 UTC,If you get a large group of enemies you can use singularity then shockwave to set off multiple detonations at once. Pretty sweet.
MECoOp,3csw8m,BadBoyMcCoY,5,Fri Jul 10 16:18:05 2015 UTC,"Shockwave allows you to set up double biotic explosions: singularity -> warp -> BE -> shockwave -> BE. As shockwave goes through walls, you can also use it to set off BEs through cover without exposing yourself. If you run incendiary ammo, it will also set off fire explosions. It's also great if you round a corner into an enemy and need to stagger then.   Without it you're only getting about half the adepts damage output."
MECoOp,3csw8m,dpny,5,Fri Jul 10 16:06:22 2015 UTC,"I think there might be a step missing from your casting order- when BEs go off they consume their priming effects so the warp used to detonate won't reprime. The usual way to get sequential BEs is to do it like in /r/aaroneh 's post here with singularity > warp be > warp reprime >singularity detonation be . Other than that if large bosses get into a hallway traffic jam, singularity can multi prime and the first and second ( rarely the third) separate pulses can set off separate BEs."

MECoOp,3csw8m,cymikelee,2,Sat Jul 11 02:02:47 2015 UTC,"I know. But that big, bass KABOOM when you set one off is so satisfying."
MECoOp,3csw8m,dpny,5,Mon Jul 13 02:28:26 2015 UTC,"Singularity > warp isn't even that good, really. If you're not using shockwave you might as well just play a warp > throw class and get faster, significantly stronger BEs.  (Honestly I'm of the opinion that even if you are using shockwave you'd still be better off with a warp > throw class, but that's beside the point)  The strength of human adept is that warp > shockwave is the most powerful practical biotic explosion in the game (I don't count pull for these types of comparisons), and that shockwave can hit and stagger multiple targets in a line. The tradeoff is that it's also a lot slower and less precise than throw, with a much shorter effective range on top of that. Also it gets hit really hard by lag, if you're playing on a >100ms connection prepare to fairly regularly have your shockwave pass through an enemy with no effect and then get killed by said enemy during your cooldown.  Once again much like with throw, shockwave is extremely effective combined with the acolyte and incendiary ammo. Strip shields and prime all in one shot, then kill with shockwave and the resulting fire explosion.  Personally I think the krogan shaman is much better suited to getting the most out of it because of his higher shields and DR from barrier. You can get up close and personal and feel a lot more secure.  But yeah, human adept is pretty overrated IMO. Not necessarily bad, it's just that they're overshadowed by other classes who basically just do their job 100% better. Singularity is really mediocre as a primer, basically dark channel without even a significant DoT, and for incapacitation, which is what it should be used for anyway, stasis bubble is just flat-out better. IMO the only real reason to pick human adept is if you haven't unlocked asari adept yet."
MECoOp,3csw8m,ginja_ninja,4,Fri Jul 10 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"...I was getting ready to defend my ""main"" here but I got nothing. I guess with singularity and more time,  effort, cds, and some serendipitous enemy placement you can get gimmicky multi explosions (that do less than one warp shcokwave or warp throw...)  I keep forgetting stasis (esp. stasis bubble) has uses for things other than janky headshot builds."
MECoOp,3csw8m,Meowmageddon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:15:36 2015 UTC,"Even then, isn't the Human Sentinel just an Asari Adept with tech armor in place of stasis?"
MECoOp,3csw8m,cymikelee,2,Sat Jul 11 02:06:49 2015 UTC,"Stronger throw, different dodge, a little more durable, but they're pretty interchangeable overall. Against bosses they're identical. I like to use my human sentinel with incendiary acolyte for nonstop throwslinging and my asari with warped arc pistol to make better use of stasis. Ends up differentiating them a decent bit in practice, but asari works great with an acolyte too."
MECoOp,3csw8m,ginja_ninja,5,Sat Jul 11 03:20:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe you spec into radius for evolution 4b. Apparently it is bugged on PC.  I usually detonate combos (tech or biotic) with shockwave. It has a shorter cooldown so it is easier to use in that respect. There is a detonate evolution for that, also."
MECoOp,3csw8m,kikkai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:00:08 2015 UTC,Hmm I avoided the radius upgrade because I heard it was bugged on PC. I think one frustrating thing about Shockwave is that it can seem difficult to hit a moving target with it compared to Warp. Part of my frustration might be due to that.
MECoOp,3csw8m,AaronEh,3,Fri Jul 10 15:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it won't track like warp will.  It is good for stagger if you get ambushed coming around a corner for example or, if you want to role play as Jack from ME2.  Depending on your team composition using it can be useful if you have another player always area priming with Reave, Smash, Bubble etc.  Otherwise I would prefer Singularity > Warp > BE > Warp > Singularity Detonate > BE for bigger enemies working as the only adept."
MECoOp,3csw8m,Mgamerz,3,Fri Jul 10 15:22:23 2015 UTC,"On every impact the ""impact cone"" changes shape because they assign to the wrong variable. After X impacts the cone no longer has any volume and thus fails to hit. It appears a different impact calculation is done as well cause it triggers the cone change but not the damage one. It keeps changing anyways so after like X waves of trying to hit with it will once again be usable. Then the process repeats. They knew about this for months and never bothered to fix it.  Curiously this does not affect consoles which makes me think they attempted an easier calculation on consoles since they shouldn't have needed to modify the script between versions."
MECoOp,3csw8m,kikkai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it rarely will hit them and it is pretty frustrating. It is a little easier to hit most bosses (or cannibals) because they are slow and won't dodge."
MECoOp,3csw8m,funkymustafa,3,Fri Jul 10 15:07:55 2015 UTC,"Shockwave has a couple useful things going for it.  It has that huge +65% damage spec on BE's, so against bosses you'll do a lot more damage per detonation with Warp->Shockwave than with Singularity->Warp.   Since it goes through walls and has an area of effect, you can use it to stay behind soft cover; ie, prime with Singularity/Warp, then move behind cover and detonate through it with Shockwave. So for instance with a primed enemy, instead of having to get a lock on to aim a Warp, you can just toss a Shockwave in its direction while staying out of fire. I abuse this a lot, since a big problem for the human adept is priming an enemy with singularity, try to detonate it with warp, and the enemy dodges or your warp misses. Now you're eating incoming fire and have to decide whether you want to stay out in the open and try another Warp, or start all over. Shockwave gives you the option to detonate without exposing yourself (no pun intended)."
MECoOp,3csw8m,Meowmageddon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:43:45 2015 UTC,"It has that huge +65% damage spec on BE's, so against bosses you'll do a lot more damage per detonation with Warp->Shockwave than with Singularity->Warp.   That's interesting! I noticed that other Human Adepts would spam Shockwave against bosses but hardly ever use it any other time. Maybe that's why?"
MECoOp,3csw8m,Ye_Be_He,3,Fri Jul 10 17:18:39 2015 UTC,"One of the primary reasons to use it is because it does more explosion damage. Others have gone over this but as an example, warp shockwave will nearly kill a Gold Brute by itself and will do half a Banshee's armor when her barrier is down- one acolyte shot and one warp shockwave BE can stop her jumps. It you try with singularity it'll take 2-3 prime-detonate cycles to do any of these.  As for the spamming, you won't get much direct damage out of it so it isnt a very good tactic- unless you have people rapidly priming things. Since shockwave is so fast and detonates tech and biotics, it can serve as a ""bridge"" between classes to detonate tech primers and clear them before biotic primers time out- classes with throw and biotic charge work very well for this too.  One last use that's over looked here is that direct shockwave on unshielded mooks and some captains will straight up kill them. You can run straight into husks, cannibals.troopers etc. and just nail them at close range for a faster TTk than trying to BE. An acolyte shot to stun followed by a close range shockwave will kill most captains too."
MECoOp,3csw8m,xXAngryLlamaXx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:58:30 2015 UTC,"The way I play adept is to spec into the detonate evo in singularity. So when I am up against a brute or slow moving tank I throw singularity > Shockwave (BE) > Warp then the singularity will explode causing another BE with Warp. In the end if everything works out well you get 2 BEs with 3 powers.  Other than using singularity on mooks, I use Warp > Shockwave. I am not the best at Human adept so others may know more. Also Shockwave just looks and sounds cooler than any other power so I spam it a lot."

From that moment on I have concluded that I hate the gap closer that is Biotic Charge.   I was just goin off what you said way back when you wrote the Liquid Thunder Vanguard guide. I figured if you hated how PUGs charged in and died with Biotic Charge, you'd hate PUGs using this even more since Havoc Strike doesn't restore shields, the melee drains shields, and the class has no other way to restore shields. I guess assuming your outlook on a type of ability hasn't changed in the past 2 years is kind of a silly assumption though."
MECoOp,3cmphm,Ye_Be_He,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:46:18 2015 UTC,"Those outlooks still hold true but Geth melee is actually pretty darn good. Not to mention Geth have above average shields and combined with Fortifications DR, it's aight.  Also I could totally spec out of Havoc Strike and have one of the most shield heavy kits with that setup. Above average shields, DR power, and dodging? Is there any current kit mirrors that level of survivability asides from on-host Vanguards and Vorcha?"
MECoOp,3cmphm,Ye_Be_He,2,Fri Jul 10 20:12:47 2015 UTC,"Really interesting write-up, I've been thinking about this idea as well. You go into a lot of detail which I think is great. I've had some thoughts on this as well although I haven't gone into near as much detail.. I think it would be cool to have a Geth Adept or at least a Geth that tries to have adept abilities through tech. I also like the idea of setting traps or gimmicky abilities that you could exploit to be really effective. I think a good name would be the Geth Adept Penetrator (or maybe Pervader).  Anyways on to some new abilities. Since the Geth cannot summon Biotic Powers on their own they need to take advantage of their superior tech and with that they developed the Biotic grenade. On its own the grenade will deploy more like a Geth Turret in that you throw it and there is no explosion, but a clearly visible field that is opened up which deals AOE DPS, and in the later tiers it will prime for biotic explosions or lift enemies a la singularity. In my mind it will mimic the Asari Adept's Bubble.  The next power is intended to be used in conjunction with the Biotic Grenade. This will be a teleporting ability in which the Geth Penetrator will be able to switch places with an enemy. In doing so this ability will prime as well as detonate Biotic explosions. The idea is that when to teleport to or from the Biotic Grenades AOE you will cause a BE if that tier has been chosen on the grenade. In tier 6 you would be able to choose to either teleport armored units one at a time, or be able to teleport 5 unarmored units at once. That way you could teleport them to the Biotic Grenade and let the DOT to the killing.  The final ability would be a self destruct ability. Pretty much self explanatory. You would enter a sequence on your arm, like in Predator, and be given 3 seconds until self destruct. This would deal MASSIVE damage in a large AOE. But afterwards your team will have to revive you. Tier 6 would be something like either doubling the damage, but you are done for the round OR cutting the damage in half and extending the self destruct to 6 secs, but you are automatically revived after waiting a certain period of time. This ability would be awesome to sync up with teleport so that you could spawn nuke enemies. Also the cooldown doesn't start until after you are revived.  Sorry for any spelling and grammatical errors, I wrote this in a hurry."
MECoOp,3cmphm,Rubberblock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:37:31 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of a position-swap move. really interesting idea. You could use it to pull enemies away from teammates or away from device objectives. However, it doesn't really strike me as being a tech ability. The self destruct ability is also interesting. I've also thought a bit about how to do something with the idea of Geth having disposable bodies. Maybe have one free revive per round that is like a replacement body?  I also have a new adept that has an area DoT generator. It'll be in my next similar post."
MECoOp,3cmphm,Rubberblock,2,Sat Jul 11 01:56:25 2015 UTC,The teleport move could move enemies TO somewhere. For example you could move an enemy to a corner where the only way to get out is through a Cain Trip Mine that your teammate left.

Mass Effect 2 is the hardest in the trilogy to me because on insanity every enemy has some form of protection, and I LOVE that. Because with ME2 you had to have a squad that could deal with all the different types of protection. One for armor, one for barriers and one for shields. ME3 is so freaking easy I fall asleep half the time."
MECoOp,3cky6k,xeqtioner0,3,Thu Jul 9 20:06:22 2015 UTC,I've had the same issue as well. I've played co-op and ME1 so much now that I can bounce between them easily. It's ME2 that gives me trouble now...
MECoOp,3cky6k,El_Diablito,3,Wed Jul 8 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"Yup, currently struggling through ME2. Being an infiltrator helps, but it doesn't compare to the overpowered ridiculousness they are in ME3."

MECoOp,3cky6k,PlacidPlatypus,2,Wed Jul 8 19:49:11 2015 UTC,"I mean it's still fun, just takes a bit of getting used to."
MECoOp,3cky6k,ginja_ninja,2,Wed Jul 8 20:14:01 2015 UTC,I never really cared too much about what your AI team mates did but can you get some of the same synergy with say one of the biotics if you're playing a biotic as well?  Now you're making me curious - it would be fun to play around.
MECoOp,3cky6k,El_Diablito,3,Wed Jul 8 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"In 3 single player you can, but in the earlier games there are no combos except for Warp in 2."
MECoOp,3cky6k,ginja_ninja,3,Wed Jul 8 20:39:10 2015 UTC,"The combos actually have more variety to them in 2 rather than just ""they detonate a biotic explosion"" in 3. For example, pull massively amplifies force-based powers like throw so enemies go flying when you combine them."

MECoOp,3cky6k,WadeAnthony,3,Wed Jul 8 20:42:01 2015 UTC,"You have to play it like you're in an actual firefight most of the time rather than 3 where you get so used to just sprinting around slinging powers, action rolling like you're in fucking Dark Souls.  Vanguard was my favorite class in 1 because it was basically an adept/soldier hybrid. You had a bunch of useful biotic powers but also access to medium armor and good durability.  Sentinel in 2 is basically the new vanguard, and the entire reason I love the class so much in ME3. After doing my first playthrough as a soldier I was just like, ""that's the class with tech armor, I'm gonna try it out because it looks cool."" And it didn't just look cool. Sentinel is fucking boss in that game. This is the game where throw really came into its own after it became spammable. You don't even really need overload if you just bring Garrus along and use him to shield-strip instead, but you've still got it to use yourself as well. Then bring Jacob, Jack, or Samara to spam pull on enemies and send them sailing over the horizon Team-Rocket-style."

MECoOp,3cmbrz,paragpn21,8,Thu Jul 9 00:49:18 2015 UTC,"So I've seen 2 kinds of glitches that could be described as PS3s freezing mid-game. There's the one where you instantly lose all audio and your screen freezes on a single frame. There's no way around this and I don't really know of a cause with it. This happens with a lot of different games and is just a general PS3 issue.   The second form of freezing, however, does have ways you can see it coming and stop it, and is called a memory leak. This is when, while you're playing as host, you notice huge lag spikes at the beginning of waves. There will always be lag spikes when new players join or when going into wave 11, but if you're getting lag spikes at the beginning of waves as early as 5 and 6 and the spikes continue getting worse, you could be have a memory leak. The 'freeze' from a memory leak happens when you reach wave 11 and your frame rate drops to something like a frame every 5 or 10 seconds. In these scenarios, the objective circle for extraction sometimes doesn't appear, the timer may never appear, and enemies will have a very hard time damaging you and moving around. From the non-host perspective, once this freeze starts, you can move around freely, but enemies are stuck in place and won't really be shooting at you much. As the wave starts, you can kill some enemies, but as the wave continues, it becomes harder and harder to kill enemies. I've been stuck in memory leaks for upwards of 20 minutes before extracting or dying as host. Many memory leak games will simply never end, though, and therefore never yield any credits for anybody.  What's actually happening in a memory leak is that certain things in game are badly coded so that they produce junk data and functions that your PS3 has to process. As the match/matches go on, this junk data accumulates and takes up more and more of your PS3's processing power, creating more and more lag. I think the reason the full force of the leak doesn't hit until the beginning of wave 11 is because that's when the host PS3 has the most actions to perform at the same moment (spawning enemies, giving multiple medals to every player, and spawning an objective) The things that tend to cause the junk data more than anything else are 1) playing against Collectors and 2) playing certain maps (Goddess, Hazard Ghost, Hazard Giant, and to a lesser extent Hazard Glacier). Not every memory leak freezes your PS3, but if you start a new game, the memory leak will only continue to get worse. If you restart your PS3, it will get rid of any of the junk tasks your PS3 is having to deal with.  If you are hosting a game, notice that you might be headed for a memory leak, and are on one of those maps and/or are playing against Collectors, then you're the only one that can do anything to try to keep your teammates from suffering. There are basically 4 options:  1) If playing with a team that knows each other and communicates while in game, you can complete the wave 10 objective, then all suicide before completing the wave. This means everyone (including you) gets most of their credits and nobody sits through a freeze scenario. This is the best way if everyone trusts the host and the host has lots of experience with memory leaks.  2) As host, you can leave the game ealier than wave 10, which means a new host will be assigned who doesn't have as much junk from a memory leak in progress slowing down their PS3 yet. This means the remaining 3 will at least die and get their credits from the first 2 objectives. This is the least advantageous option for everyone, but is still something to be considered when hosting PUGs. Obviously, this option means the host loses all credits.  3) Once wave 11 has started and the freeze is happening to you, if you (the host) leave, then wave 11 will restart with a new host and the remaining players can extract. The downside of this option is that even if the remaining players manage to extract, there is an associated bug where they often get far fewer credits than they should (like only 30,000 for a whole Gold game). Also note that pulling up the start menu is very difficult once the freeze happens and you'll probably have to just manually hit the power button on the PS3.   4) Once the freeze happens, you can try to wait it out. On rare occasions, the memory leak will still result in an extraction after several extra minutes of glitched play. However, many PUG, non-host players leave well before this can happen. Mics still work like normal during memory leaks, so if playing with a team with mics, you can decide together whether the host should leave (option 3) or if everyone wants to try to stick it out. If the memory leak finishes without the host leaving and with somebody extracting, then everyone will most likely get all their credits. However, I consider this to be the worst of all options because of how many times I have sat in a memory leak for up to half an hour without even seeing a timer appear for extraction.     anyway, idk if the freeze you're describing matches either of these, but that's my 2 cents. http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-02/1/20/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-32005-1422840611-40.jpg"

I'm too old to actually chuck the controller across the room, but it has been a close thing. PS crashing 10 seconds before extraction... nghhh! Also thanks for the possible fixes. At least now, I've got alternatives. Funny thing about Goddess; it's been several times now that I lost connection at the very start of the match, and all I got was a still of the scenery around the base. And the waterfall on Rio, the serenity contrasting with the loss of the match."

Yesterday I had a team with lovely synergy, one teammate kept everything primed, I detonated biotic explosions left and right, while a volus kept our shields up and a krogan tanked everything that didn't die from the explosions.  I also had a game where I was the only surviving player in 3 of the 11 rounds. As soon as someone went down, the other two went in to revive him without looking what killed him and was still around.

MECoOp,3ccfxe,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"I think I mentioned something earlier about using an asari Adept as a sniper. Stasis anything tougher/faster like phantoms or collector captains, etc.  Warp spec'd for debuffing for anything armor/shielded or just for that extra dps if you feel like you need it.  While i prefer the Indra with this build, since i'm generally bad at making the critical headshots reliably while under pressure, a Black Widow is a good compromise imo.  A destroyer with an indra is pretty beast too from what i've just recently found, not as great as with a particle rifle or a typhoon, but still pretty reliable, but it is harder to apply impressive damage to multiple types of protection."
MECoOp,3ccfxe,Mazhiwe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:43:15 2015 UTC,"The Salarian and Quarian (female) Infiltrators have powers that stagger and setup your shot. It's, imo, better than Stasis sniping because if you can't take out their health immediately, they'll be dropped from Stasis.  I've played enough to have a maxed manifest, and if you're going to Stasis snipe, the Paladin and Arc Pistol with AP rounds is the way to go. AP doesn't harm shields, so getting caught in shield gate keeps them upright, while the second shot is straight overkill on most humanoid targets. I frequently double tap Phantoms on Gold with ease."
MECoOp,3ccfxe,blackmarketdolphins,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:09:31 2015 UTC,"I love using all Asari, and Stasis/Sniper builds are awesome fun.  I feel bad though if I'm teamed with another sniper. I'm using a regular Warpbomb build right now. I generally only stasis Phantoms or critical targets. But when I have a friendly sniper, I stasis everyone in an attempt to make easy targets.  But then I realise I'm just messing them up. Because every damn shot flies over their frozen head. I think my stasis is actually screwing my allies, who take the time to ""lead"" with their shots."
MECoOp,3ccfxe,TheBaconBard,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:37:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there are several infiltrators with hitscan powers that operate on a similar principle. Cloak, cast your power to stop the enemy and make it easy to shoot them in the head.  The salarian and quarian are the best bets with energy drain and sabotage, as they have the least random effect on the target they hit and make them stand nice and still and behave. Turian and asari are the other two, but overload is a little tricky because neural shock will knock unshielded enemies over and sometimes shielded enemies will recoil a bit, whereas dark channel pretty much always makes enemies recoil and take a few steps back or to the side so you still have to track them and readjust your aim. It's just easier to do so because they're now moving in a predictable path rather than randomly.  As for asari adept though, I find the best stasis-sniping build for her doesn't use a sniper at all, but rather the arc pistol. Looks like this. The really nice thing about the arc pistol is that when you fully charge it up, it ignores shield gate so you can kill enemies with a single headshot, even on gold. Yes, even phantoms. Provided you're using warp ammo anyway. And the really nice thing about it is that it's way lighter than snipers too so you're better at cranking out BEs vs. bosses or spamming throw against unshielded enemies."

Anything else won't do. 5: a lot of enemies have shield gate, and unless you have phasic rounds on a strong sniper, you won't be getting OHKs any time soon on silver+"
MECoOp,3cbxdd,Iziama94,15,Mon Jul 6 18:42:00 2015 UTC,"Since you are a Jugg I will assume you were in their face.  Praetorians hit like a freight train compared to Banshees, because unlike Banshees single melee swipe, they stab you repeatedly in combos and it usually ends up in a stun lock even for a Jugg. Scions are mini Primes with prevent shields from regening and just to be dicks they have cluster bombs.  Best bet to survival is to be mobile or follow my favorite philosophy: they can't fight back if they are dead."
MECoOp,3cbxdd,BlodhgarmDethahal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:00:50 2015 UTC,Honestly Scions are more like bulky Ravagers without goo or bugs. You can dodge both those enemies' shots simply by strafing.
MECoOp,3cbxdd,GotACoolName,5,Thu Jul 9 06:13:00 2015 UTC,"You're probably trying to brute force tank them a little too much.  Collectors break the mold of 'I can tank them just a little bit longer,' and really force you to think on your feet.  Compared to any of the other Super Elite enemies, Collector Super Elites do a massive amount of damage, so just standing there to absorb it will kill even a maxed out Juggernaut.  My advice is to be mobile, and try to avoid as much direct fire as possible.  If you're out of shields, try to get into some sort of cover before melee'ing something to regenerate your shields, and play a little more defensively.  Pretty much, staying stationary on any Collector match is a bad idea since you're just a target at that point."
MECoOp,3cbxdd,idiotsonfire,2,Mon Jul 6 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"I've definitely noticed this about Collectors in the short time I've tried playing the Jugg -- somehow I end up drawing all the aggro and have to use a missile (or get stagger-locked before I can pull it out and fire).  I wonder what a good way to build him is, then -- do I have to go full tank?  Since I've been playing Gold and not Plat, I took all of the weapon passives to make up for the 6b ""fitness"" evolution, and I was too lazy to reset away from the Hex Shield so I put 3 points in it.  That being said, it seems like Hex Shield is important on those open maps where you get Scions sniping you across Condor or Rio, though I find it's sometimes hard to get it deployed and back away from the splash radius while trying to deal with a Praetorian or two."
MECoOp,3cbxdd,cymikelee,2,Tue Jul 7 02:50:51 2015 UTC,"The way I play my juggernaut is 6/6/3/5/6 for the powers.  Whenever I see a group of Praetorians or Scions rounding the nearest corner, I pop a turret just a little ways away from me, but out of any grenade splash range or so forth, and due to that and the resist bonus from the siege pulse, the shield booster, and a Cyclonic IV, I can almost always last long enough to unload two or three Reegar clips into them.  If you've only got three points into Fitness on a Juggernaut, its no wonder you'd have trouble with it.  Losing out on several thousand shield and health hitpoints is a tremendous disadvantage--it'd be better to only have three points in Hex Shield than only three in Fitness on a Juggernaut.  As for the Hex Shield's importance against Scions, it only reduces the effectiveness of Scion barrages, it doesn't fully block them since they're meant to penetrate shields."
MECoOp,3cbxdd,idiotsonfire,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:23:28 2015 UTC,Sorry if I wasn't clear -- I do put 3 points in Hex Shield and 6 points in Fitness.  It's that 6b evolution in the latter that's the reason why I went full weapons bonuses on the passive.

MECoOp,3cbxdd,idiotsonfire,2,Tue Jul 7 04:25:58 2015 UTC,"Scion rounds do not go through shields  The splash damage goes around the shields edges therefore as a pro juggernaught would recommend Place the shield about 4m ahead of what where you are but still blocking LoF This protects the juggernaught not only from direct damage via ravagers, scions, and primes it will also prevent the splash damage they deal from hitting you, and greatly increases your life expectancy in the field."
MECoOp,3cbxdd,OneTrueChaika,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about penetrating shields completely to do chip damage to health, you're right, but the rounds are either shield cancelling or carry a piercing quality since the Hex Shield can't block them completely, even when fully upgraded to a Large shield.  It works pretty much the same way Ravager fire does when put up against the shield--it protects from the brunt of the shot, but not all of it."
MECoOp,3cbxdd,idiotsonfire,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:32 2015 UTC,"If you follow my advice it protects from all of it....  Like i've said whats hitting you isn't some magical hex shield piercing round its just an explosive shot that while the direct part of the damage gets blocked...someone needs to place the hex shield a bit further away, and they'll be fine  I can assure you i've played juggernaught many times on platinum, and the first thing to do is when those primes start laying down heavy fire I go up several paces place the shield then back up  VOILA! Suddenly I take 0.....Yes i said ""0"" damage what an amazing thing...  I hate being the guy that says git gud, but honestly a good juggernaught won't get dropped by anything that isn't 4 phantoms or 3 phantoms 1 banshee, and so on because if you're a tank then you're literally unkillable due to the shield regen you pull vs the damage output they have"

MECoOp,3cbxdd,OneTrueChaika,3,Wed Jul 8 23:21:48 2015 UTC,One way to mitigate a substantial portion of incoming damage would be to position yourself somewhere that blocks you from a wide range of incoming enemy fire. Receiving volleys from one or two Scions is not going to end well if you are busy face tanking a praetorian.   Making use of a Biotic Bubble or a Volus shield boost should give the juggernaut the additional push he needs to survive just about anything (beyond unnecessary damage by staying exposed to the entire army).
MECoOp,3cbxdd,Mazhiwe,2,Mon Jul 6 20:32:01 2015 UTC,Collectors are pretty bad for juggernauts.  The Praetorian can get around the map very quickly and its melee attack can burn your shields down faster than you can regen.  A couple in your face can end you quickly.  There is no shame in using a missile if you get caught in a tight spot.
MECoOp,3cbxdd,Jon9000,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:30:03 2015 UTC,"When playing the Jugg, I'm keen to take out as many mooks as possible, before trying to smack the big guys. Face tanking while being shot at from loads of troopers or mid-level foes, can bring you down real quick. Putting the big hex shield between Juggy and his target, is a big help (duh, you probably all know this) - one can still melee through it. If luck holds (plod plod plod across the map), or one is very savvy, one can do this in a choke point - letting the Scions and Praetorians line up behind, blocking each other's fire. Then melee them one by one, while the faster team members run around and start shooting them in the back. Adrenaline mod and the ""increased movement speed"" evolution of Fitness, really helps in staying a moving target. As for the bad-ass capabilities of the Collectors... at Bronze, they can be like a Silver match against any other faction, and so on."
MECoOp,3cbxdd,Kapitan517,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:34:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like in my admittedly short experience, Collectors Plat seems easier than Collectors Gold, if only because other factions take the place of some of the Collectors..."
MECoOp,3cbxdd,cymikelee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:14:39 2015 UTC,"This is why I pair my Juggy with a teammate that can do high damage to armor at range. Geth Infiltrator with a Javelin is what springs to mind. Juggies are weak to two things (besides ledges): High burst damage, and damage from range. The latter can be mitigated somewhat with Hex Shield, but the former requires teamwork. Also a PPR with Incendiary rounds and the AP Barrel helps a bit too."
MECoOp,3cbvfp,ArgonV,10,Mon Jul 6 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"Grenades are wonderful, how dare you suggest they are more limited than other powers.   So am I using some grenades wrong?   My ideal inferno grenade setup is: 1) put all the points into the power, then 2) throw a crapload of grenades at everything.   As in, don't even stop to use another power or fire your gun or ""take cover"" or anything silly like that. Just keep moving to the next ammo box. If you get cornered or are in trouble, use thermal clips and keep tossing grenades until everything is ashes.  For example, use the Krogan Soldier, max everything except Carnage, and put on the Predator with the power amp. Don't use your gun at all. Just run around the map throwing grenades. 1 for Marauder-level enemies, 2 for armor, a bunch for bosses. Other players will hate you (sorry /u/kaicel). This is the build I use when I eat while playing, as it requires minimal effort/thinking.   Or are there just some really sucky grenade powers in the game?   Homing grenade is the black sheep, and even it has its uses."

Also I generally save the grenade nuking for the last three waves, so that my ammo packs actually last until then.  And yeah, homing grenades are really annoying for their travel time and tendency to hit obstacles like the tops of doorways.  I relegate then to a Dragoon panic button or to supplement damage done to bosses."

Yeah, I would do that for efficiency, except that 1) I'm lazy and 2) usually teammates who arrive at that spawn will usually kick off some FEs anyway. I find it more mentally calming to just worry about getting to the next ammo box. Like I said, it's not the most efficient build, but it has a great efficiency:laziness ratio.  I usually don't throw more than 2-3 grenades at a spawn, and I ration packs during the grind waves. Depends on the map.   I relegate then to a Dragoon panic button   Yup."

Of course I usually use a real weapon--typically arc pistol, talon, paladin, etc. Of course I fire the gun, detonate with carnage, do all the ""right things.""  But my point was that the grenades are so powerful that you could still do tons of damage and contribute without firing a shot or using a detonator. I'm not presenting some devastating optimal perfect build, just pointing out to the OP that grenades are super-duper-awesome.  I sometimes think people here are wayyyyyyy to serious about this stuff.

MECoOp,3cbvfp,mcquotables,0,Fri Jul 10 15:59:30 2015 UTC,"Predator   No. Use your acolyte/reegar to decimate shields, then inferno to melt the armor. Take carnage and use it to detonate inferno grenades for fire explosions. Not firing your gun is always inefficient."
MECoOp,3cbvfp,GotACoolName,8,Thu Jul 9 06:40:29 2015 UTC,"Inferno grenades don't cause a forceful explosion or a big burst of damge, so they're not as flashy or immediately impactful as other grenades. What they do is apply a hefty DOT effect and prime multiple enemies for fire explosions. To get the most out of them, you need to be able to detonate those FE's."

A fully specced Inferno Grenade does around 7.2k Armor damage over 8 seconds. It's nothing to scoff at, since you can stack them over each other. And since it multi-primes, Chain Overloads can cause multiple Fire Explosions.  Also another grenade secret: thermal clip packs restore up to 10 grenades per use. Combine those with Grenade Capacity gear and you can throw 50 grenades in a row without hitting an ammo box. That's no exaggeration, 100% serious."

They deal ridiculous amounts of damage, and if you have gear that ups capacity, can be spammed with little issue. They have limited charges, but they are also off the cooldown, so they increase the versatility of a character tremendously.  If you ever find yourself short of grenades in a sticky situation, don't be afraid to use a thermal clip pack.  Inferno grenades will do more damage than incinerate. The key is the damage over time, so you either have to wait or detonate the fire explosion."

Against those bosses, I just toss 2-3 and use that to supplement my damage, and can get some insane DPS.   The Batarian Soldier you throw in your IG, rush in Ballistic Blade everything, and start shooting. Spec for explosive blades for the extra stagger, and you can clear a spawn without having a single shot fired at you.  The Krogan soldier I spec for max carnage, spec IG for max damage (and I take the power damage fortification rank). Level 6 fire explosions, and with a claymore nothing can stand in your way.  As far as the other grenades...Arc Grenades are amazing...Lift grenades are amazing...Cluster Grenades are amazing...Frag Grenades are amazing.

Just equip grenade capacity V on a krogan/batarian solider, incendiary ammo on your gun, and run around chucking them at spawns and finishing enemies off with your gun. Particularly retarded on the krogan because you can use them in tandem with carnage for fire explosions.  Seriously, it's probably the single easiest way to topscore in a gold pub in the game.  GC gear is really the big game changer that took almost all grenade classes from ""hm this is pretty good"" to ""wtf so now I get 7-9 of these things, holy shit."" Regular human frag grenades are probably the least spectacular of all of them, particularly because they can be tricky to aim without a direct hit, but even those are really useful for AoE shield-stripping once you get the hang of them."

But so many PUGers seem to think you can take any class to Plat with it, camp Giant, and be invincible.  The worst part is... they're not that far off.  Just played a match on Geth Plat that was pretty much easy mode, outscored by a Jugg and Drell Assassin ka-chunking away the whole game.  This in spite of some... questionable play on their part.  For starters, I did every objective in the match -- all 8 of the 1234s, and had to pretty much escort the drone by myself because they couldn't stay in the circle.  The Jugg would go down randomly because he'd constantly shoot off his Siege Pulses  instead of using them for DR.  And the worst part... everyone would gel immediately, even on Wave 1 with me standing over them mashing space bar!!!

MECoOp,3c657m,RepublicanShredder,10,Sun Jul 5 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"A technical note: The Crusader doesn't have a firing delay, precisely. It hits instantly, but wherever you were aiming approximately 0.2 seconds ago on PC or approximately 0.08 seconds ago on console. The difference is because it's framerate dependent, and ME3 on PC runs at 60fps and on consoles it runs at 30fps. As stated in the OP, this is an unintentional bug that they acknowledged, and justified leaving unpatched, but that there exists an unofficial patch for on PC. The patch works on or off host. Also, like all weapons with innate penetration, it doesn't lose any damage firing through cover when penetration mods are equipped."
MECoOp,3c657m,crashsuit,3,Sun Jul 5 06:43:41 2015 UTC,If it's framerate dependent why isn't the delay longer on consoles than on PC? If the delay was a set number of frames I would expect it to be twice as long on console. What's the actual mechanism?
MECoOp,3c657m,PlacidPlatypus,2,Sun Jul 5 16:56:54 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good question but unfortunately I can't say. I know that people who've dug into the files and game mechanics have found a number of framerate-dependent things in the game, but I don't know enough about that side of things to be able to say for myself. There are some ridiculous things that've been found to be tied to framerate though, and/or are affected by extreme changes in framerate, like shield regen delay, enemy AI behavior, and even some weapon damage or ammo use - Reegar and CSR are affected by framerate. It's supposedly some combination of the game engine they used, plus some sloppy coding."

Literally taking off 1/4 of the armor per shot off of Gold Atlases and Banshees.  I was like, is this for real?  I haven't rolled the AIU in a shotgun build since my early co-op days with low level Reegar/Pirahna, but this makes me want to dump my melee build just to try it out.  Thing is though, by the numbers it looks like a Pirahna should still out-DPS this thing, though I realize there's a rather massive range factor involved.  Is that accurate to say, though?"

You can no-scope from all the way across the map, and most of the big baddies are pretty slow moving.  The biggest problem I have with it is going against smaller, quicker foes that you need to lead a bit.  It has a high firing rate and a 3 shot clip, So you can really do some damage coming out of cloak if you chose the shotgun, weapon, and firing damage bonuses (who doesn't?)"

Yeah, you'd be giving up the possible +20% damage from assault rifles, but the Ghost is the only character that has both tactical cloak and overload.  TacCloak+Overload+Crusader headshot is going to just... wreck.     Ghost's Cloak+overload is sufficient to instantly strip shields from any non-boss enemy other than a platinum phantom.  Good-bye, shield gate. Overload stuns enemies briefly, letting you line up a headshot more easily. A cloaked Crusader headshot on a fully specced Ghost and does 4628 damage even against armor, one shotting every non-boss enemy other than platinum dragoons and possessed collector captains even without consumables. Shock trooper upgrade (+12% damage, +2 Grenades) synergizes well with Stimulant Pack, freeing up more skill points for the fitness tree. The fast power cool down from a brief TacCloak mitigates the extra weight of the Crusader."
MECoOp,3c657m,cymikelee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:29:02 2015 UTC,I love the Crusader on the Ghost. He also has one more nice benefit and that's the stability bonuses in his passive.

MECoOp,3c1cyb,Scarecrow1779,11,Fri Jul 3 21:34:34 2015 UTC,Possessed Scions are the worst on objective waves... I almost wonder if the best thing to do when they show up is to leave the hack circle and kill them first.  Phantoms seem really kit-dependent... I was just messing with the FQI melee build (that animation is so slow...) but staggerfesting them with the Venom and finishing them off with melee is hilarious.
MECoOp,3c1cyb,ElMacedonian,13,Fri Jul 3 21:41:51 2015 UTC,"Leave the hack, you can not over commit to a hack verses collectors unless you want to die to abominations, collector swarms, and possessed scions. Killing them takes to much time and they will just respawn usually fairly close. Best thing to do is to try and lure them away a little bit, then spring back to the hack. Your mobility has to be abused verses them. As well as trying to fource their grenade shots in places that are okay.  Remember you have a ton of time to do the hack don't suicide by refusing to leave the circle!"
MECoOp,3c1cyb,Scarecrow1779,10,Fri Jul 3 22:36:15 2015 UTC,"my issue with phantoms is that they have no real weaknesses other than stasis, biotic charge, and chain staggering. they are extremely dangerous at close range, are powerful at mid range with their palm cannon, have flips and cloak to avoid/reduce weapon damage, and a bubble to negate power damage. If you took away or nerfed any one of those features (even if you also strengthened one of the other features), i think it would produce a better enemy."
MECoOp,3c1cyb,crashsuit,13,Fri Jul 3 22:02:25 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the bonus damage resistance versus the host, and that they flip more often than the game files say they're supposed to be able to."

MECoOp,3c1cyb,quilman83,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:01:44 2015 UTC,"I prioritize phantoms whenever I see them because of all these issues. It helps to make a phantom's defensive tactics work for you. Firing a power at a phantom will bring up their barrier. This makes them stationary for a few seconds - exploit this by lining up your shot before hand. Eventually their power barrier expires. I don't know for sure that the duration is fixed, but it does seem like it. Get a feel for when it expires, because there's a brief window where it's on cooldown and you can land a projectile based power.  Also, at close range a phantom can't sync-kill you before swinging her sword once. Gives you a bit of a window to run away, as long as she misses. Don't think I've ever got away if she connects with the first swing."

Due to the charging mechanic on their shotgun, for some reason they can still shoot you when they're staggered, knocked down, frozen, flying through the air, et cetera.  That's why they get my nomination."
MECoOp,3c1cyb,Scarecrow1779,2,Fri Jul 3 23:36:34 2015 UTC,the only thing that truly disables hunters from firing at you is submission nets.
MECoOp,3c1cyb,felassans,6,Sat Jul 4 14:04:38 2015 UTC,"And death, that's always effective."
MECoOp,3c1cyb,ElMacedonian,4,Sat Jul 4 17:24:52 2015 UTC,"in Soviet Russia, Geth Hunter kills you.... wait, they do that everywhere else too."
MECoOp,3c1cyb,RepublicanShredder,2,Sat Jul 4 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"Geth Scanner is an excellent piece of equipment. It has saved my butt lots of times. Recently I was sole survivor on White against Reapers, and my Asari Adept was trapped in the lower level with Ravagers and Marauders everywhere. With GS, I was at least able to plan ahead a little, and finish the wave. I find the visual overlay very tiring for the eyes, but it does slowly become easier to ignore it."
MECoOp,3c1cyb,RepublicanShredder,3,Sat Jul 4 23:24:13 2015 UTC,"the main thing i hate about geth hunters is that they don't actually get staggered. they can shoot you while they are staggered, while they are getting up off the ground after being ragdolled, and even shoot you while in stasis."
MECoOp,3c1cyb,felassans,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:07:00 2015 UTC,I came to this thread to say that Marauders are the freaking worst. I've probably been downed more by Marauder packs than any other kind of Reaper enemy combined.
MECoOp,3c1cyb,Kapitan517,7,Fri Jul 3 22:00:38 2015 UTC,"I hate the design of the phantom. Inreah dislike that the majority of normal tactics with powers and weapons don't work quite well due to her immediate power blocking bubble and having enourmous damage reduction durring flips (and if your host of a game, and shoot her right after a flip, she will flip again). So she's supper difficult verses most conventional means but if you have a counter for her in your build she becomes trivial. She dies easily to just putting on an acolyte or scorpion sidearm, as well as powers like a Stasis and a few other projectile weapons. But I just hate that hard counter nature of this unit, either she's easy or an enormous pain based on your build, and that is limiting to possible load outs"
MECoOp,3c1cyb,xeqtioner0,6,Fri Jul 3 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"I actually don't mind the Phantom too much from a game design perspective.  Sure, on some character builds I struggle more with her than with Banshees, but I feel like there's enough tools that can ""soft counter"" her well enough that I don't feel my creativity limited too much.  For starters, the Acolyte is so useful on so many classes that I often have it at my disposal.  Combined with the predictability of her bubble, a few well-placed shots takes care of her just fine.  Beyond weapon counters and Statis, you can usually get a hitscan power off before she bubbles -- strip her barriers with Energy Drain or Overload and she goes into panic/cloak mode.  DoT from Reave and Dark Channel can also trivialize her, as do well-timed AoE powers.  The Krogan melee is also pretty great.  My latest favorite has to be the Piranha, preferably with the Devastator Mode rate of fire bonus.  Six blasts to the face is almost a sure kill even on Gold Phantoms."
MECoOp,3c1cyb,RepublicanShredder,2,Fri Jul 3 23:25:36 2015 UTC,"The Phantom also regenerates health pretty fast while cloaked, which rally is icing on the cake. It's literally good at everything, which makes it infinitely frustrating to fight against. Hence why many, including myself very very loudly, consider it bad game design.  Other close contenders include Dragoons and Marauders (the People's Elbow) but they aren't as ridiculous as the Phantom. The prior two are much better at telegraphing how they will hurt you, while the Phantom does everything almost all the time with the only real telegraph being the sync kill."
MECoOp,3c1cyb,bughumbar,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:43:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, I guess I'll give you that there isn't a lot of nuance to how it's designed (and I actually would say the hard counters are what make it bad design).  Probably the worst part is the fact that you'll get waves where four of them spawn at once and they'll travel in a pack and down your whole team unless you missile them."
MECoOp,3c1cyb,funkymustafa,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:33:30 2015 UTC,that you'll get waves where four of them spawn at once and they'll travel in a pack and down your whole team unless you missile them   You don't like the harem of Phantoms and their kinky palm and sword antics?  I could probably lecture on how the Phantom is literally the worst designed enemy I have ever faced in a computer game but what I've mentioned about being good at everything is good enough without sounding like an attention whore.
MECoOp,3c1cyb,bughumbar,7,Sun Jul 5 03:14:07 2015 UTC,"Geth: Bombers. Stagger city, and my aim sucks so the only solution I've come up with are hitscan powers, since they seem to 'dodge' everything else.  Reapers: Seconding Marauders, those guys are jerks.  Cerberus: Weirdly, I don't mind Cerberus as much. Maybe engineers/turrets, since those seems to be the number one biggest cause of PUG revive circles.  Collectors: everything Possessed Scions. I like playing the vorcha sentinel against collectors so I can hit them back with my own cluster grenades, but their aim is always better than mine, lol."

MECoOp,3c1cyb,RepublicanShredder,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:43:40 2015 UTC,"Could be worse, have you played Warframe? They have worse power nullifying setups there but they're a lot less prevalent.

I've also missed with powers in ME more times than I'd like to count.  Even with that handicap, my aim really is that bad!"
MECoOp,3c1cyb,RepublicanShredder,4,Sun Jul 5 02:35:02 2015 UTC,"There's not really a lot about Reapers or Cerberus that bothers me. Probably what I hate the most about Reapers, aside from Warpy McMagnetHands, is that Brutes can stagger you just by breathing on you.  As for Cerberus, except for how powerful the Phantom's hand-cannons are, I feel like they're probably the most balanced faction. Sucks running around a corner and getting mowed down by two turrets, but generally if I go down against Cerberus, I feel like I somehow deserved it.  Geth Rocket Troopers, though, I've been double and even triple-tapped more times than I care to count. But my favorite is finishing a wave, only to immediately get downed by a straggling Prime Turret.  Worst one, though? The Collector Captain. Particularly when he's possessed. They're so fast, and they make the Marauder's MegaPhaeston feel like a GPR I. And that claw swipe they do. And those seeker plagues. I hate everything about them."
MECoOp,3c1cyb,Kapitan517,6,Fri Jul 3 21:56:03 2015 UTC,"Best is when a Possessed Captain happens to be the last target on an assassination objective, and has that extra DR from it. So fucking aggravating putting headshot after headshot into him and he won't fucking die! I almost feel like Arnold in Terminator 2 blasting the T1000 in the face and watching the holes close up and he keeps on walking towards you.  Also, if you've never been the last person alive and medigelled yourself only to be surrounded up against a wall by a whole goddamn baseball team of Collector Captains all doing their best Wolverine snikt snikt impression and jammed against you so tightly you literally cant move an inch, you're missing out."

MECoOp,3c1cyb,emwhalen,3,Fri Jul 3 23:29:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah the last thing the Geth need is something else that can stagger you. They bother me a little less than the turrets just because Primes always drop their drones right in front of 'em, but they can cast those turrets right behind you and you don't even know they're there until you're bleeding out and see it in the killfeed."

Cluster grenades followed by suppressing fire is not very fun to be receiving as it gives very little reactionary play that doesn't involve getting shot.  The Phantom is a close second, considering it's a wholly unbalanced enemy. Tanky, fast, invisible, good ranged attack and melee attack, sync kills, AND a small hit box? Who thought that was a good idea for an enemy?"

MECoOp,3c1cyb,MrSnippets,2,Sat Jul 4 22:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's just so petty. The portrayal of Leng is really quite masterful; all the pieces come together to show that he's a guy who could have been great, but chose to be a dick.

The one exception is common characters (the base humans), which will always have a chance to show up in every pack except Arsenal and Jumbo Equipment.    I'm pretty sure PSP's are your best bet overall for rare cards. Personally, I got there almost entirely on Arsenal packs, because I was more concerned with weapons and because drawing repeat character cards got on my nerves.    I started playing last November, so I'm not familiar with the release timeline for the DLC and all the patches/fixes. That said, I've found the BBLoB to be a very handy resource, even if the posts are all a year or two old."

As far as credits/time invested I always thought gold was a better investment.  matches only take 20 mins and the credits are much better than silver.  When I PUG in platinum I struggle to remember a time where I had more than one extraction in a row...
MECoOp,3bny2t,transam617,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the thing is, that most people that play platinum, have really high end gear and know how to play, although sometimes you see people that are new to the game(Less than 500 in trophy points) joining games. Playing gold is sometimes more difficult because you see people who are not that good yet in the game and just makes things harder for everyone else"

MECoOp,3bny2t,Mazhiwe,3,Tue Jun 30 23:34:54 2015 UTC,"All things considered I would say the widow on your salarian infiltrator would be your best bet. Mode are either heavy barrel/ammo or damage/piercing. I'd recommend a sidearm with this setup being the eagle or hurricane whatever you prefer.  Reagar with Flamer class is another grossly powerful option you have available to you.   Your claymore is another weapons focused avenue you have to be very successful in platinum. Best bet is on the geth infiltrator.    If you want to be rocking ( most skill intensive of all options listed here to but least impacted by your weapon manifest) power based classes (caster types with quickest cooldowns) like adepts and engineers your probably going to want the eagle with piercing and one other choice mod. You can also try to use acolyte with many adepts to quickly strip shields and have a hurricane for bosses and armor.   Assari huntress full power damage spec with a crusader and warp ammo is incredibly strong and easy.   Turian ghost with your particle rifle, possibly typhoon as well depends on your comfort with these weapons   Geth plasma shotgun is your other weapon that stands out to me, this thing has slot of utility and can be strong on many classes. But strong, not crazy strong like a lot of the other options I lost here  For mods most is personal choice however you absolutely need some level of armor piercing every game either from your ammo type or more. Gear should almost always be survivability based, your geth scanner and survivor load out being your greatest assets here. (exception being the huntress you want adaptive war amp maybe but I still like survivability more)  Any setup well put together can win on plat and I have often done so with uncommon (silver) weapons, so anything you want to do is possible, but the classes I listed are absolute the strongest options you have, however if you are interested in particular classes, weapons, or other things I check reddit regularly and will be glad to help."

I prefer playing the Collector as a soldier with the particle rifle and warp ammo, hit a target with dark channel and just start melting them. With mostly headshots I can pretty much kill a banshee with one clip, but I find its too risky and usually keep it to a clip and a half.    Another fun one is Asari Adept as a sniper. Ignore Throw, unless you want to sacrifice Health/Shield bonuses, and just warp a target then melt it with warp ammo sniper fire, or hold it with stasis for the trickier targets.  It's pretty beast mode imho.  Obviously you want to take these new untested builds down to silver or gold to the feel for them and get any issues hashed out.    My GT is same as my reddit ID."

They are amazing at detonating biotic explosions (they can detonate three with a single grenade throw) and reave is no joke either for setting up and detonating explosions.

However, for this team build I was going for as little reliance on ammo/grenades as possible. Hence the Lancer/Collector SMG since they are bottomless. On a map like Giant you can easily get ammo as needed but you may not always get such a map. Drell could certainly work though with its Grenades on a propper map though, or if it replaces the Jugg and make the team more mobile."
MECoOp,3bp82g,Earlkay,3,Wed Jul 1 01:56:51 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to see if Juggs can survive the death march of Wave 8/9 Praetorians stabby stab and Scions' cluster f*cking grenade + cannons.

MECoOp,3bp82g,mcquotables,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:45:06 2015 UTC,"I will admit, Collectors will be the most painful to go against in this build. Very easy to be stunlocked and not be able to melee anything. A good map choice would be in your favor, especially to bring the Scions closer to you. My personal favorite is Glacier with Giant being a second. Ghost kind of works as well.  On the plus side, Praetorians don't use their shield to block powers when they are landed and stabbing you."

MECoOp,3bp82g,Scarecrow1779,2,Wed Jul 1 12:56:04 2015 UTC,This is a fantastic setup. I was wondering if you'd use the Valkyrie or the Fury as an alternative to either of the adepts? What strengths and weaknesses do you think would occur under these different circumstances?
MECoOp,3bp82g,gilgamesh_v9,2,Wed Jul 1 20:15:40 2015 UTC,"The issue with replacing either Adept is you loose priming from Biotic Sphere/Reave or the multiple detonations from Shockwave. Both of which are important. It is debatable to replace the Volus with a Fury (over the Valkyrie because you are behind the Jugg anyway, you don't need the extra tank) and use Dark Channel for heavy DoT and just spam Throw every second for more booms. You COULD use Annihilation Field for priming near the Jugg but you have an issue of getting killed by AoE attacks such as Banshee's explosion, Scion cannons, Atlas missiles, etc.  Now if you wanted to replace the Jugg like I said and be front lines as a Valkyrie (because tankier than Fury), you could increase the DPS of your team by a lot theoretically. This does raise an issue though, which is you have to be mobile to survive, which reduces the effectiveness of Biotic Sphere and Recon mine as they have to be set up again and again for each new spot."

MECoOp,3bk12x,ShiinaMashiron,11,Mon Jun 29 21:17:52 2015 UTC,"I would agree that she's tough to use past silver. You can get some great melee damage out of her, but she's so fragile you have to use it carefully. It's easy to get overrun, so you can't just run around ninja-swording everybody like you can on bronze and silver.    Shadow strike is sorta fun and can deal something like 5,000 damage, but the animation is so slow that your teammates usually kill any mooks before you finish. Total overkill there. Against bosses you just have to be really, really careful about sync kills. It can one-shot phantoms, though.    I feel like electric slash looks way better on paper than it actually is. I was in a gold match against reapers with a guy playing a shadow. I never saw him use shadow strike. He meleed mooks when he could separate them from the pack. Mostly he spammed electric slash, and it was not super effective. I think he scored 50K points to my 150K before I ran out of medigel and we wiped on wave 10."

MECoOp,3bk12x,briefcandle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she is hard to use against bosses.  She is viable on gold (though the last waves are tough), and she is probably somewhat viable on plat if the rest of your team is good -- being able to instakill phantoms/dragoons/pyros and the like is helpful, though your team needs to be strong enough to handle the bosses on their own.  She is definitely best on lower difficulties, though."

How about him? :)"
MECoOp,3bk12x,briefcandle,2,Mon Jun 29 23:32:59 2015 UTC,"I like the slayer, as long as you're hosting. Otherwise, forget it. With phase disruptor, biotic charge, and melee, he's amazing for cleaning up the mooks. You still have to be careful and play defensively against bosses, but PD does decent damage against armor, and if you watch the enemies' animations you can usually time your charges so you can teleport away right after and avoid getting synced. It's all about timing and managing your barrier and your cool down. If you get a good rhythm going, you can rack up the kills fast, but there's a lot of opportunities to screw yourself (and piss off your teammates)."
MECoOp,3bk12x,cymikelee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:25:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the slow animation is why I stopped playing her on Silver.  To handle U/U/G matches I had to go duration cloak as per /u/Scarecrow1779's suggestion."
MECoOp,3bk12x,funkymustafa,5,Tue Jun 30 00:02:14 2015 UTC,"For an full melee-centric gold build, use duration + bonus power on cloak. All damage on Shadow Strike. Full melee + armor damage on fitness. The rest of the points as you see fit. For a weapon, a shotgun with omniblade is mandatory. I like the Piranha with smart choke and incendiary ammo.   The main problems people often have with her is a) squishy, B) what do I do when it's not Cerberus. Regarding A, a cyclonic mod helps, no ways around it. 675 HP/shield may as well be tissue paper on Gold+, and for a melee build you should not be sacrificing Shadow Strike damage for the survivability evolutions like shield drain. The best way to play her is as a lone wolf. Going around with your team is inefficient because you will frequently SS enemies who are already half dead, or die before you finish the animation. You're also in the middle of a firefight when you decloak, which is not ideal. She's better off roaming the map, spotting enemies from afar and slicing them down one by one. The game is very generous with letting you lock SS on their hitboxes through cover or from long distance - abuse this shamelessly! Becoming familiar with map layouts, spawns, etc also helps a lot. It does take some experience with the game to maximize her capabilities.   Remember that your heavy melee is very powerful, and you're still an infil with a cloak damage bonus. Let's say you finish shadow striking some dumb assault trooper, but shit! Two centurions standing right next to him that you didn't see. Do you run away and hope they don't nail you before you find cover? If you do, this frequently ends with you dead. Being offensive is frequently the better option. Learning how to combine SS, heavy melee, regular melee, and weapon fire in a cohesive pattern really helps you survive. Again, this takes experience and practice. For instance, a close range Piranha blast frequently stuns mooks. This can buy you the time to instakill them with a heavy melee and end the threat, instead of trying to reach cover in a panic.   For non-Cerb factions: focus on cleaning up foot soldiers. It may seem like you should be helping against bosses, but she excels at methodically eliminating troopers. It's the Marauders, the Collector Captains (grr), the Rocket Troopers & Pyros, that kill many players. Emptying the map of these enemies will significantly help your team. Yes, that means you might just run right past a Praetorian or Geth Prime. Help out against these enemies when needed, but your focus shouldn't be on them.   For bosses: there are ways to employ melee, your best weapon, against almost all bosses. It just takes practice and good timing.   Atlas: Duration cloak can help to flank it, then spam cloaked heavy melees from behind. Retreat and take cover when it turns to face you. Remember that all this time the Atlas is performing its ""watch out I'm gonna sync you"" animation, paying attention to you, etc, is time spent not firing on your teammates and buying them free damage. Banshee - learn when SS works on her. If she is chasing someone else and teleporting (NOT walking), you can almost always SS her and do full damage. She will keep teleporting and you'll slash empty air, but the damage will register. Once she is out of sync mode or in power bubble mode, use those melees. Her Nova is a problem due to your squishiness. Remember that melee and dodge animations confer large amounts of damage reduction - abuse that if needed. Prime: Best handled with teammates. Going in for a quick SS + heavy melee combo while he is distracted with someone else is usually the best option. Always clean out the drones and turrets with gunfire before engaging - getting stunlocked while you are trying to evade post-SS spells dead. His melee comes out very fast, so I will always evade after each individual attack instead of trying to string multiple attacks together if it's just me. Scion: ahh there's an art to this. I've taken on 2 or 3 scions at a time with a Shadow. It's all about exploiting their AI and learning their sync kill animations, combined with using cloak, cover, and SS to hit and run them. Depending on how they react, and when they ""lose interest"" in you, modify your attack. Sometimes SS and immediately evade. Sometimes, SS and HM combo. Sometimes, SS, evade, SS again and heavy melee. Once a scion fires his cannon, he has to use his melee again before he can sync kill. If, for example, I have scions 1 and 2: SS #1 and evade. He immediately does his melee, though I'm cloaked and he doesn't actually see me. He is now primed to sync and dangerous to me. I SS #2, immediately evade and get cover. #1 by this time has resumed firing, maybe at me or maybe at someone else. I cloak again, break his line of sight, then SS him again, adding HM if I can get away with it. Rinse and repeat until all dead.  Praetorian - very tough. I usually am guns-only with them. In a very tight spot if you HAVE to melee, you can sometimes get away with SS when they are using the lasers. Start mashing dodge the instant your slash finishes."
MECoOp,3bk12x,ginja_ninja,2,Tue Jun 30 02:46:19 2015 UTC,"The N7 shadow, aka the N7 slayer trapped in a bubble of invisible molasses.  She's not actually bad and it's easy to do well with her on gold, it's just that like I said, a melee-focused slayer can basically do most things she does but with better animations and less recovery/cooldown. And if you want weapon damage from an infilltrator you're probably not going to be playing the shadow.  The advantage she has over the slayer is that you can be safer and a little more methodical in getting kills with less balls-to-the-wall risk because of cloak. The downside is, once again, you take longer to kill stuff because of that.  It is a lot less demanding than playing a slayer at the level where you aren't dying all the time though, and will generally make for a relaxing game. You can even play it for several games in a row, whereas usually after one game as a slayer my adrenal glands and wrist tendons are pretty much spent and I switch to something more easygoing.  If you like playing it, keep playing it. If anything the game's probably become less about meta and more about fun since you took a break. Nobody really cares anymore, and even before most people didn't care much either."

Cerberus is a piece of cake because Shadow Strike can one hit every thing but an Atlas.   I have her speced for damage and bonus power on tactical cloak, and with a Wraith (and an ominblade courtesy of the weight bug) I can sneak into 2 SS strikes with the damage bonus. I just pick off the middle level mooks (centurions, marauders, geth rocket troopers, phantoms, dragons, pyros, scions, brutes, geth hunters).  Bosses are strictly weapon only except when I can sneak in a SS. Just make sure you have good situational awareness, don't cloak while they're focused on you, and stay mobile and the class is great.  Don't think its plat worthy unless you spec out of a melee build."

I totally forgot about that part and I believe it depends on the weapon you are carrying (e.g. much stronger on the Crusader vs a Wraith as the Crusader deals more damage per pellet than the Wraith even though the Wraith shoots more pellets).   Tactical Cloak adds an additive base damage except for Rank 6 evolutions (which are multiplicative).

Also also: If your ammo primes, and the Sticky hits an enemy directly, it will apply the primer on contact and detonate it when it goes off."
MECoOp,3bh56s,dpny,2,Tue Jun 30 01:49:09 2015 UTC,Does the penalty apply when you throw the Sticky or when it detonates?
MECoOp,3bh56s,mightykingfish,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:02:14 2015 UTC,"When it hits, it applies the bonus damage (if any) your equipped ammo gives to one bullet or pellet from your gun, so I think you want to be scoped when it hits, though the unscoped penalty depends on which sniper you're using, if any. It doesn't have any effect on the damage of the Sticky itself though, just the ammo effect damage it applies on contact."

I usually avoid firing the pulses off to get the damage reduction, but I was playing with a Demolisher and Geth Infiltrator that wrecked everything so hard I had to fire my pulses to contribute at all -- despite my -200% cooldown.

A little scary going in U/U/P but took the plunge with a Salarian Infiltrator, Krogan Adept (switched chars a couple times), and Batarian Adept as teammates.  Got full extractions on all except one because of lag -- Glacier/Geth/Destroyer, Vancouver/Collectors/Human Engineer, Condor/Reapers/Huntress, White/Collectors/Valkyrie.  Placed 3rd on all except getting 2nd on the Vancouver match due to having to duo a wave with the Batarian Adept (two of us were the weakest players, but managed -- everyone contributed well in every match).  I've come to realize that Collectors Plat is actually not that scary, since you don't have as much Banshee/Phantom spam in the early waves and you get fewer Collectors late than you do in Gold.

Should be just about ready the next time I bump up the difficulty.  Rant:  I'm not very good at Vanguards or Krogans in general, but recently topped a Gold PUG with a rebuilt Murdertrain specced for Barrier popping.  Got Reapers/Giant, stuck in a lobby with a mediocre BatSol, TC-less AIU (another scared player who only used the Reegar on mooks, stuck with a Harrier for bosses), and level 1 Volus Engineer.  I think they wanted to camp the LZ but kept getting sync-killed, so I tried to bring the action over to the ramp.  That was fine in the early waves, but later in the game I drew ALL the aggro.  Seriously, I went down once because 4 Marauders, 2 Ravagers, 2 Banshees, and 2 Brutes were ALL going at me while the rest of the team was hiding, then hit my gel key a split second too late.  Went down a second time because a Brute knocked me just off the ramp so the Banshee could grab me.  HUGE kudos to whoever was playing the Volus for placing 2nd and carrying us through 3 waves.  Misc:  Also played a couple matches with /u/krnlcheese, who held his own on Gold despite having minimal kit and obviously low N7/CP.  Unfortunately the team went down in both due to a revive-chain Phantom spam on the 1234 objective on Rio, and Possessed Scion grenade spam on the center hack on Giant.  Better luck next time, I guess!"

It can be fucking annoying when the other 3 are barely outscoring you combined...and it's gold collectors on Condor...and two of them are playing a separate minigame of ""who can die the most times in the first 30 seconds of each wave"". But when you die, bleed out, force me to clutch, then immediately die again and bleed out again at the beginning of the next wave because you went AFK while I clutched, go fuck yourself.   I solo'd that wave anyway until there was 1 scion left (team was of course all dead at this point), shot it to its last bar of armor for shits and giggles, then walked up and let him kill me.

MECoOp,3bc8tm,cymikelee,8,Sat Jun 27 21:06:59 2015 UTC,"There are too many different variables in play with score to use it to judge your performance. There's so much crap going on that during a carry it's not uncommon to crest 300k, but that certainly wouldn't be as smooth a match as one with everyone around 150-200k contributing evenly.  Furthermore since a lot of people run UUP, some kits will have dramatic advantages over others on some maps and factions. For example I really shine on my Fury hunting high wave budget mooks against Cerberus and Collectors, especially on small maps. If I get something like Geth-Hydra or Geth-Condor I have to slow down and play much more carefully, or try to restrict where I engage.   *As for your Engineer- Incendiary Ammo isn't necessarily a bad choice- if you detonate the ammo with Incinerate (which gives enough of a flight time delay for the ammo to prime) and then follow up with Overload, you'll get your ammo explosion and then the Incinerates explosion in sequence. Keep in mind that only tech powers can layer like this (and they layer separately from biotic explosions). If you have chain overload or your drone dies in a pack, you can also aim to prime multiple mooks with your weapon to get multiple FEs. You'll actually get a fair amount of boss damage by spamming Incinerates onto Armor as well, though it might feel kind of slow.   *Biotic teams aren't always necessarily better, and quite notably certain priming types are weaker than others. Dark Channel is a commonly listed offender, as are Dark Sphere, and Singularity. Reave generally gets a pass because it applies quickly, in AoE, and is both a detonator and primer.  In addition, kits relying heavily on their powers in general have a little downtime against Banshees and Praetorians.  At the end of the day the general guidelines are really just:   1) Have boss damage with piercing or armor mitigation- either from weapon or powers. For example on my Human Sentinel and Adept my boss damage is really just coming from my explosions, I think I think I just get two or three or four bars from my Hurricane spam.  2) Be able to kill Phantoms (Often you'll see people with Acolytes/Scorpions or Projectile/Stagger weapons to cheat here)  3) Double emphasize 2), even on Cerberus Gold in Pugs, the smoothness or success of the run can end up depending on whether the team can kill Phantoms, because a lot of pugs can't for whatever reason.  After that, synergizing well with the team helps quite a bit. If you've got three other people running biotic setups for example, don't throw a Chain Overload into the mix or use Disruptor Ammo- you'll rapidly overwrite everything into techbursts. For such reasons I like to have classes that ""play well with others"" - typically Infiltrators that don't prime (or self detonate very quickly) or classes with Warp or Throw that can work with Biotic or Tech Effects."
MECoOp,3bc8tm,Meowmageddon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:48:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the thorough explanation and guide.  Interesting how tech combos chain while biotic/mixed combos are stacked/LIFO.  I guess I'll pay less attention to score and more to general effectiveness (I really have a lot of trouble with Geth -- what a staggerfest on open maps).  I think the armor note is pretty universal, I mean you definitely want that in Gold as well.  But good point on the weapon not contributing much on power classes, and on second thought I think there was an offender in my bad match who ran Disruptor ammo.  Given the lightness of the Acolyte I'll probably go ahead and grab one in the future, maybe with ULM (I'm at 184% CD w/my Hurricane III).  The Combat Drone, Overload for barriers, and forced bubble has worked alright so far, but I wonder if the Acolyte would be quicker or more reliable.  Plus I'm not sure if my habit of using Incinerate on shielded enemies for the FE is the most effective way to go."
MECoOp,3bc8tm,Meowmageddon,2,Sun Jun 28 04:22:16 2015 UTC,"Since this is straying a little bit out of just the load-out concerns, might as well point you to the college pages, as they have the rest of the mechanics described and already checked over by the more experienced posters here:   /u/Interwebninja's Gold Guide   /u/RepublicanShredder's Platinum Starter Guide  Those do a good job of explaining more of the mechanics that you'll be wanting to deal with, especially since a lot are pretty non-intuitive.   Also from the sidebar you might want to take a look at using the Character Builders along with the Enemy Shield/Health stats if you want to plan out particular setups- then you can make sure you're reaching target thresholds like one or two shotting Marauders, one shotting Phantom barriers, etc.   Also, since your particular note was on Phantoms... Notice that even /u/Ginja_Ninja 's response has a focus on Phantoms on Plat as well, they're really a major concern. One of the non-intuitive difficulties about them is that they gain extra damage resistance to the hosting player- so keep that in mind when you're building your setups. I think /u/Crashsuit corrected me before that the game mechanic is that they gain damage reductions during their flips and shortly after- but these don't go into effect for the joining players. Hence the suggestion for hosts to use abilities, knockback, stagger, projectile weapons, or other tricks to kill mobile Phantoms.  edit Now with proper underscore in Ginja_Ninja's name... I wonder how many times I linked to the wrong person in the past..."

MECoOp,3bc8tm,TheMadMullah,6,Mon Jun 29 02:21:42 2015 UTC,"The thing with platinum is barring certain maps/team configurations, you are always on the move. Learn the maps very well and as you go from spawn to spawn, just hit the ammo boxes as you go. I barely have any down time when I play this way.  In additon, don't obsess so much about the points. While it can be indicative of how much work you are putting in, it also can be very deceptive, as the game gives extra points for kills (people ""leeching"" points from you), and combos (thats why for example the N7 Paladin can be very score whorey)."
MECoOp,3bc8tm,ginja_ninja,5,Sat Jun 27 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"The reegar and harrier really become a lot less powerful on plat, mostly like you said because of ammo issues. If you brought both of them for a single loadout you just might be able to get by but yeah, it's a problem. Personally I think the reegar is super overrated on basically every class except vanguards and every map except Glacier and maybe White because of its range issues, but that's another matter.  Do you like sniping? Because the spare ammo mod on a lot of sniper rifles goes a long way on plat. On gold I just use an extra piercing mod on my BW, but I'll swap it out for spare ammo on plat and very rarely run into big resupply issues.  My number one favorite class for plat though is PPR destroyer. It's great on gold as well, but the high shields, stagger immunity, and infinite ammo make it absolutely godlike on plat. Very few map/enemy combos even give it trouble at all. Here's what I've determined the ideal build to be from years of playing. Chances are you likely don't have a huge stockpile of level IV gear yet. With that mod setup on the PPR it's very important you have AP ammo IV equipped to get that 90% piercing to melt bosses. If you don't have AP ammo IV to use, swap out the extended barrel for HV barrel and use warp or incendiary ammo instead. Feel free to hit me up with any questions you have about how it's specced."
MECoOp,3bc8tm,bughumbar,3,Sun Jun 28 01:00:35 2015 UTC,"I'll bite - why Hydra Missiles over Multi-Frags? I like the Hawk Missile Launcher on gold for staggering enemies or forcing them to dodge, but with the higher force thresholds and more bosses (i.e. fewer dodging enemies) on plat (which I rarely play), it seems like it would lose quite a bit of utility.  I also never realized the HML shield penalty only applies to base shields and not max..."
MECoOp,3bc8tm,ginja_ninja,2,Sun Jun 28 01:52:04 2015 UTC,"Because of their insane synergy with the particle rifle. They continue to autofire while you're shooting it, making lining up headshots far more efficient. Especially vs. phantoms. While in some waves there will be a smaller number of captain-class enemies compared to a gold, there's no shortage of phantoms throughout plat games and phantom control, as has been mentioned here already, is one of the most critical elements of a plat group's success or failure. Hawk missiles trivialize phantoms. As soon as they fire, the phantom stops and is forced to bubble, allowing you to quickly melt her face while she's standing nice and still for you. Hydra missiles means you can even stop multiple phantoms in their tracks at once. They're arguably just as effective as stasis.  Furthermore though, it also has to do with multifrags' complete lack of synergy with the particle rifle. In order to launch them, you're forced to stop shooting and lose out on the massive spoolup damage from the rest of your clip. The PPR is so beast it will likely tear through boss armor faster than a multifrag volley anyway. The only real applicable time for them to come into play would be while waiting for a recharge, but that's what the executioner is there for. If you get headshots with it that's over 10,000 damage per clip. Perfect for finishing bosses in style, and when you switch back your PPR is charged and ready to go. As for crowd control, your hawks are still firing off the whole time so that's a nonissue.  Finally, like I've said one of the big elements of being effective on plat is sustainability with limited resources. If you have better ways to get damage than depending on multifrags, you become completely ammo-box-independent. Few classes can boast this in general, but it's all the more relevant on plat. But it's not only to your benefit. If you've done a plat as a grenade class with multiple other grenade classes on your team, you know all about the struggle to maintain grenades and racing your teammates to the box to see who can steal one first as everybody tries to replenish their waning supplies. Grenade-independence means that if you're playing with grenade classes, you're allowing them less competition to replenish their stock, thus making them able to play more effectively at no compromise to your own godliness.  It really is satisfying to be able to just completely ignore having to rush back to the box every 30 seconds like you see your teammates doing or remember doing as other classes and just lay down the fucking law nonstop. With that build you seriously only need to visit an ammo box once every couple rounds between waves to top off your executioner. It's awesome."
MECoOp,3bc8tm,novemberpapa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:59:49 2015 UTC,"Really interesting build that I'm going to have to try!  I had been sticking with a Typhoon + Pirahna + Multifrag build on the Destroyer and recently specced some points into missiles for Gold, but this might be a good excuse for me to L2P the PPR and go full Hydra Missile while I'm at it.  My only questions would be why you don't go with the AR HVB mod (which gives 90% piercing I believe) and/or a sniper rifle as your secondary -- are you trying to give yourself flexibility with your modal powers by watching your weight or something?  Edit:  To answer your original questions... my gamertag tells you all you need to know about sniping (though I do get on a competent streak occasionally) and I do have about 15-20 of each IV ammo, so I can pepper in a Plat game here and there for sure."
MECoOp,3bc8tm,ginja_ninja,2,Sun Jun 28 04:26:04 2015 UTC,"2 reasons for not using the AR HVB mod:   1)Since PPR doesn't have innate piercing, if you attach one or both of the piercing mods you'll lose significant damage shooting through cover.  You won't have this problem if you just use AP/drill ammo.  2)Using HVB prevents you using the damage barrel which gives a hefty 25% additive damage increase (almost as good as AR Rail Amp III)     As long is you don't burn off all of PPR's ammo, it actually recharges in a decent time.  The main reasons for the Executioner is that its shoot-reload cycle matches the PPR recharge pretty well, it deals good burst damage for killing off the enemies that are almost dead, and the Destroyer is the only class where it can have 2 shots in a magazine which is a pretty good cool/fun factor."
MECoOp,3bc8tm,novemberpapa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:22:47 2015 UTC,"Oh duh -- for some stupid reason I thought the AR HVB worked like the shotgun/sniper ones instead of like the SMG one.  And yeah, I love that about the 2-shot Executioner, it's how I finished the challenge for Pistol Mastery.  I guess the other benefit is no hipfire penalty, to answer my own question."
MECoOp,3bc8tm,ginja_ninja,3,Sun Jun 28 05:30:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for some reason the AR HVB follows different rules, so generally you want to go extended barrel + AP ammo IV to get max damage.  As for the secondary weapon, you can totally use a sniper if you want to. I just use the executioner because I think it's badass and want to take advantage of that chance for a 2-shot clip. Finishing banshees with a headshot is always so satisfying and you look cool as hell doing it as a bonus.  I used to run him with the piranha as a backup which also fucked shit up pretty hard, but after a while I realized it's not as good to have a close-range secondary. The PPR can already take care of things nicely even at point blank if you just let go of right-click, but its one weakness is that it does have a maximum range (it's pretty long though, you basically have to be shooting all the way across the length of Giant, Hydra or Rio for it to apply), so ideally you want your secondary to be something that extends that range. Obviously snipers can do the trick, but so can the executioner, plus like you said it also has the benefit of no scope so it's also still useful for finishing off enemies at closer ranges if they're still alive after you have to let off your death beam."
MECoOp,3bc8tm,Salsadips,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:56:44 2015 UTC,"Cool... so I've been trying this out with a PPR I and actually am struggling like I was when I tried it out on the Collector Adept.  I don't know if I just can't aim right with it (the crosshairs and visual cues seem weird to me) or if it just doesn't pack the same punch at level I, but I don't seem to be getting the damage I want even when I burn as much of the clip as possible.  I had thought the Destroyer's clip capacity bonuses would help, but is there something I'm missing here?"
MECoOp,3bc8tm,Scioso,2,Sun Jun 28 07:57:56 2015 UTC,"I'll be blunt, the recharge weapons like the PPR at low levels are crap. Let's look at a destroyer specced for magazine size. Given that this spec of Devastator Mode provides a 10% ROF bonus, the PPR takes 2 seconds to power up, and it has a base RPM of 800:  when the PPR I reaches max DPS, it will have 215-800(1.1) (2/60)=215-29=186 ammo in the magazine  when the PPR X reaches max DPS, it will have 268-800(1.1)(2/60)=268-29=239 ammo in the magazine  Also since the PPR X's base damage per shot is 25% more than that of PPR I, PPR X outputs 239*(1.25)/186=1.61 times the damage of PPR I when you almost empty the mag.  *ignored the PPR's weak beam for simpler calculations."
MECoOp,3ba5b3,cymikelee,5,Sat Jun 27 06:21:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, supposedly you can reduce the latency of the ""help I've fallen off a ladder and can't get up"" animation delay with a dodge. I don't know if this is apocryphal but I do it anyway.  You can cancel the Batarian lash with his light melee, which is just a hair faster than the ""pull"" part of the lash. Sometimes this messes up the physics, but it's hard to tell because lash does whatever it wants anyway.  You can roll out of the Demolisher's setup sequence once the box makes that Transformers noise. A somewhat marginal gain but can get you out of a bind.  You can dodge cancel Dark Sphere on the ACA, although every time I do this I fly right into a hail of bullets. You can also cancel the swarm summoning animation--as soon as he raises his arm and you hear the woosh of bees, dodge out. This is useful because you can squeeze in the swarm sequence during the Dark Sphere travel time and still have time to detonate DS, if that makes sense.  Tac Scan can also be shortened, but the timing is tricky and sometimes you end up scanning thin air.   You can cancel out of biotic sphere, although it seems like you can also move around a bit while her arms are out. This is really helpful when you want to aggressively bubble a chokepoint or just shame-bubble someone. But if you get staggered or cancel before the bubble actually pops out, sometimes you'll hear the bubble sound but get nada.  I think you can cancel the stupid ""hold your arm out like an idiot"" part of homing grenades too. But you can't cancel the fact that you're using homing grenades.  My favorite is: you can cancel out of the AIU's snap freeze with a heavy melee--which has the 'surfing' property. It happens very fast, stuns the baddies, and reveals cloaked enemies for heavy melee lock-on. However if the mook is unshielded you'll miss and then people will laugh at you."
MECoOp,3ba5b3,mcquotables,5,Sun Jun 28 14:45:20 2015 UTC,"Phoenix whip smashes can be cancelled with rolls like snap freeze.  The weirder ones I remember are that light melee cancels Tech Armor activation, and some classes stand up faster when you heavy melee- I see people doing that on the Destroyer quite a bit.   Sidestepping or backpedaling off of ladders is often faster than climbing down- though you're not able to do this in all spots. The only one I know for sure is the ladder that leads to the supply room from the upper offices on Goddess, I'm not sure if there are others."
MECoOp,3ba5b3,Meowmageddon,3,Sat Jun 27 06:28:31 2015 UTC,"Depends on the height of the ladder. Shorter ones like in Reactor, Dagger, or White you can jump off of. Taller ones like in the middle of Vancouver or the middle of Ghost, you have to climb down."

MECoOp,3ba5b3,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:52:16 2015 UTC,Phoenix whip smashes can also be combo'd into a heavy melee if you time it right (Right when the smash makes contact with the ground and you hear the first sound effect from it I believe).

They can help you figure out what kind of player you are and how you like to deal damage. They're also pretty good all the way up to platinum if you set them up right.

MECoOp,3b7x30,InfiniteQuasar,3,Fri Jun 26 23:42:20 2015 UTC,"A very good player can do well with the appropriate loadout and/or team.

MECoOp,3b7x30,InfiniteQuasar,3,Sat Jun 27 01:40:06 2015 UTC,"That's a straw man. There are very obviously other roles to be played than pure damage output.   The novaguard obviously isn't good as a weapons platform.  It isn't good at biotic explosions, as it cannot set up its own and it can only set them off it they're kissing the enemies ass and making themselves vulnerable. Not to mention that Charge and Nova have no BE bonuses and there are far better characters to spam Shockwave (like basically all of them) and better powers to spam than Shockwave (biotic slash and smash).   It isn't good at straight weapons damage. Charge, Nova and Shockwave are all meh at doing straight damage especially to bosses where it is needed on gold and plat. Not to mention that the Slayer, Drell, and Asari all have better AoEs in nearly every regard when compared to Nova with Phase Disruptor, and grenades respectively. They all have better range, better radius, better effective damage and they hurt shields less. The only cons are that PD doesn't set off biotic explosions and grenades are a resource.   It's not very durable, especially in situations where it needs to be durable like hacks because the durability is tied into i-frames when charging and using nova, which often requires them to leave the hack.     It literally only functions well on gold and plat when paired with someone purposefully assisting with biotic set-ups and even then it's shaky and not really any better than any class with aoe biotics or in the hands of someone very talented. Being good in one realistic situation is not the hallmark of a good class."

I won't give you the long in detail answer you deserve for thoughtfull comment, because I'm tired and in my phone.  I agree that the nova-guard is not an easy character for plat, and can only really shine if paired with one or more biotic primers, but in that role he's one of my favourites, mainly for his versatility. He's highly mobile, has with shockwave one of the best detonation powers and can be very usefull in dealing with mooks in a fast fashion, when armed corectly. Also, in my opinion, he can actually be one of the more durable characters if you know when and what to charge at. Obvious drawbag though is that off-host playing is considerably harder. In the end I probably like him most because he's really fun I damit that."
MECoOp,3b7x30,InfiniteQuasar,6,Sat Jun 27 02:42:35 2015 UTC,"I'm with you up until the shockwave part. Under no circumstances should a novaguard ever spec into shockwave unless you're making a joke build to express your unbridled hatred of the biotic charge ability.  The reason the novaguard is so good on certain maps for plat is that he's the fastest detonator in the game with charge/nova cycles, as well as extremely durable with the invincibility he gets from it. Coupled with a few teammates spamming warp and reave and it's literally nonstop BEs for the entire 20 minute match. Enemies pretty much never stop being staggered. If you want shockwave on the team, it should be provided by the fourth player, though honestly I think smash is the better ability to have in that spot anyway."

MECoOp,3b7x30,cyzward,6,Sat Jun 27 03:20:34 2015 UTC,"Pick the class you are most familiar with from the single player campaign. That will ease you in on it. I recommend doing a few solo bronze runs to start off. It will be hard and you will die but it will give you an idea of what a real MP match is like. Once you are comfortable, just hop into a bronze game. With 4 people it will likely be easy but you will learn how to play the class. Eventually you will be hungering for more play styles and then you just choose what you like."
MECoOp,3b7x30,DoctorSexy_MD,9,Fri Jun 26 18:43:59 2015 UTC,"I like this, but see no reason to solo. I've never had a problem shepherding noobies, in bronze or silver. Just don't play gold till you know what's up."
MECoOp,3b7x30,comment_moderately,8,Fri Jun 26 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"the reason I recommend solo is because in bronze/silver you usually get some ""all-star"" players that just warp around the map at high speed bombing spawn points. That means slower players who are learning don't really get a chance to play or do objectives. If you go solo, you learn a lot about how the waves work, how the spawns work, how the objectives work, etc. That way you can at least somewhat participate when you get those fully upgraded people on your team that just start slaying everything."
MECoOp,3b7x30,DoctorSexy_MD,3,Fri Jun 26 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand those hotshot ""all-stars"" who play Bronze/Silver with fully-equipped, level 20 characters and 5-digit N7/CP levels.  I guess some people don't appreciate a good challenge or get a kick out of topping Bronze scoreboards.  That said, my approach is usually to leave lobbies that have these players and find another match with a more balanced team.  There should be enough low-level players to have a fun match even on Bronze and Silver."
MECoOp,3b7x30,cymikelee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:27:51 2015 UTC,"I have pretty good N7 and challenge scores but I'm still in bronze games relatively often to level classes back up after prestiging them, and I can see the appeal of stomping a bronze game, but I'm not sure why wouldn't just solo it if you wanted to do that."
MECoOp,3b7x30,UberMcwinsauce,3,Sat Jun 27 00:26:57 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, I usually do Bronze under level 10 and Silver until I feel comfortable enough with a class to do Gold.  Once I hit 20 it just seems like a waste of time to stomp a Bronze match -- carrying a Gold lobby with less-endowed character feels so much more rewarding if scoreboard topping is what you're into."
MECoOp,3b7x30,cymikelee,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:19:23 2015 UTC,"Very reasonable. Otoh, you get more XP--which allow Op to assign some skill points."
MECoOp,3b7x30,comment_moderately,2,Fri Jun 26 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"All players get the total XP earned by the entire team. Also, the way that XP is shared, particularly in regards to bonus points by using skills, means that more XP is generated by a team of players than by any single player.   Also, 4 players can kill things faster than 1, so you get a higher rate of xp generation in regards to time as well."
MECoOp,3b7x30,berychance,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:26:15 2015 UTC,Agreed. Plus it's a team game and combos work best with the team.
MECoOp,3b7x30,comment_moderately,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. It took me a lot of time and hard work to be able to solo bronze; I wouldn't have been able to do it when I first started. In fact, I actually tried soloing when I first got ME3 (too shy to play MP) and I failed in wave 1 or 2 every time, which was really discouraging.  If you're shy or you don't want to run into 'all-star' spawn-nuking players, find a buddy or two to play with. It's far easier to play with two players than one, if only because there's someone around to revive you so you don't run out of medigel, and try to finish out a wave if you get sync-killed.  As far as your original question goes, my favourite common and uncommon kit are the human sentinel (warp + throw = everything going boom always - and combos are an important mechanic to understand in MP), the drell adept (pull + reave, reave-priming for another biotic buddy, and if all else fails you have grenades), and the turian sentinel (a great all-round kit that can do a little bit of everything and is hella durable)."
MECoOp,3b7x30,felassans,3,Mon Jun 29 01:11:10 2015 UTC,"This is a very good idea. But make sure to play with people too, because you will fail a lot at the start playing solo and that is discouraging.   However, playing solo is the best way to learn your way to harder difficulties. I'd say if you can solo bronze, you can play gold in a team. Also, people tend to get stuck on bronze or silver for months, and the efficiency of playing those difficulties compared to playing gold/platinum is horrendous.   My recommendation is to learn a class very well, and push your skill till you are confident, then take it out for a spin in gold. If you fail, no biggie, keep at it. Gold is easily doable with power classes like adepts, sentinels and engeneers even with starting gear. You won't top boards, but you won't be useless either.  When the time comes that you feel at easy on gold, work on soloing gold. When you do that, you are pretty much ready for whatever the game can throw at you, and platinum will be good fun :)"
MECoOp,3b7x30,UpsetLobster,3,Sat Jun 27 00:38:22 2015 UTC,"Are you just starting out with the base humans and guns?  Or do you have some backlog of extra gear from playing in the past?    If you are just starting to farm bronze games with base humans I recommend power based classes and builds.  Adepts and Vanguards don't really care what kind of gear they have equipped so long as it is light they will kill things.    If you are looking to get carried through silver or even gold for the extra credits, focus on not dying, contributing in objective waves, and debuffing enemies with skills like Warp, overload and cryoblast.  Human and Turian Sentinals are great for this.  Tech armor helps you to not die while you warp anything bigger than you so your allies can kill it faster.  If you prefer a lighter touch, focusing on utilty with one of your human infiltrators can allow you to run around the map reviving allies in stealth, cryoblasting things to stay safe and helping with missions like the hack 4 objective.    Most people in this community are pretty easy going below gold difficulty.  So long as you are trying to help with objectives and the like they wont mind if you are not great at the game.  The game becomes a lot easier with gear like armor penetration mods, and becomes more fun as you unlock exotic guns and new classes.    Most people will recommend starting by just grinding the recruit packs until everything you can get from them is level X, then move onto veteran packs and do the same.  I personally found sprinkling in a pricier pack every now and again helped keep my interest and made farming more fun when I had stuff like Krogans and Reagers to play with."
MECoOp,3b7x30,One_more_page,3,Fri Jun 26 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"Turian sentinel is a really solid one. A variety of different builds, fairly high shields when you invest in fitness and tech armor, and good weapon handling. Easily able to hang on bronze through gold. Fits well on pretty much any team too.  Many builds will try to balance all his abilities and do something like what you see here. This works the best overall, particularly if you have a lot of high-level warp ammo to get damage bonuses on armored bosses. However if you're low on equipment, consider trying this build that I played for a long time in the early days of the game. It's very simple but also very effective.  Personally I'm of the opinion that the TS really isn't meant to be used on most biotic teams. There are so many other biotic classes with warp that chances are his addition is going to be redundant on the average team. So instead simplify the build to play to his strengths and use the extra points to increase his survivability with maxed fitness and tech armor. You've got chain overload to strip shield and stun enemies/knock them down, then your trusty Mattock to finish off normal enemies with headshots and take down armor. You won't be a DPS god on gold compared to top-tier damage classes, but you will learn good habits and fundamentals and it's an excellent class for people with less developed manifests to make the jump to gold on."

MECoOp,3b7x30,vader540is,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:01:48 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, I won't recommend you to start playing soldiers. Yes, it's easier when you just shooting and sticking to covers, but as a starting player, you'll have only the beginner's weapons. And they aren't the best weapons in the game. I have a friend, who started playing human soldier, picked the default assault rifle and found that the gun is extremely weak. Only after a couple of gold runs with my experienced crew he managed to buy a pair of Arsenal packs, and equip a rare submashine gun. It was entirely different game, he said.  So don't play a shooter character until you earn some good weapons.  The default sniper rifle (Mantis), by the way, is okay, if you are used to one-shot-before-reload shooting style."
MECoOp,3b5qze,TheBaconBard,8,Fri Jun 26 04:50:53 2015 UTC,"Well on the class selection screen, there's a little question mark you can click when you select a class that gives a brief description of it that I think might be close to what you're looking for. With some of them it's pretty hilarious how far off-base it is from what the class is actually best at in practice. Look at the human sentinel's for instance."
MECoOp,3b5qze,ginja_ninja,4,Fri Jun 26 05:35:39 2015 UTC,"Hence my confusion. I would love to see from a ""game design"" standpoint rather than a lore/meta view."
MECoOp,3b5qze,cymikelee,5,Fri Jun 26 05:58:52 2015 UTC,"I guess if you think about how they've distributed the races and general classes, the kits naturally seem to cover the spectrum of biotic (Asari) to tech (Salarian, Quarian, and Geth) as well as long-range (Infitrators, nominally) to short-range (Krogans, Vanguards, and snap freeze / annihilation field characters).  I think getting the right mix and match of skills to cover these bases provides the diversity needed (and power combos allow for a lot of richness in class synergy)."
MECoOp,3b5qze,cymikelee,5,Fri Jun 26 08:31:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's what the designers intended (or maybe so when they came up with the power) but I just scored 149k in a match using a KroSent with a Tech Armor build... and got topped by a TC-less Geth Infiltrator spamming his GPS faster than I thought was possible.  Weirdest match I've had in a while but super fun.  To answer your question though, I imagine the classes must've been designed to a large extent around the DLC they were contained in?  Of course there also seems to be some biotic vs. tech vs. weapons specialization, as well as some themes for certain races (Tac Scan for Quarians, for example).  I guess they generally got the kits to stay ""in character"" as well, in terms of who they put Flamer and Rage on (for CQC), for example."

MECoOp,3aymt9,cymikelee,3,Wed Jun 24 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add that early on, esp. before one gets piercing, the Combat Drone is one of the easiest ways to get Guardians to turn away so they expose their backs.   As for the Paladin a lot of survivability depends on taking advantage of the fact that Snap Freeze goes through walls- also you can cancel the last part of the animation into a side dodge so you're not holding still for quite so long.  The shield melee also has a good forward dash and reliable stun- so oftentimes going in aggressively with him is actually safer- especially if you get the hang of using heavy melee to straight up block while you're getting shields back or waiting for SF cd."
MECoOp,3aymt9,Meowmageddon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"That reminds me, the Quarian Male Engineer has insane power damage.  Make sure you're the only one using grenades, though.  The Talon Merc is also a good class with grenades, but you really need to make sure you pace your grenade use.  Melee builds can help with that.  Salarian Engineer is still pretty useful and comes with a distraction and a healing power.  If you're into it, the Juggernaut can just sit there and melee all day.  You know, if that's your thing...  N7 Fury and Valkyrie are also good if you like close combat but can't spare cyclonics for melee characters."
MECoOp,3aymt9,Potataro,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:43:54 2015 UTC,"The only problem with grenade classes is that it often takes a while to upgrade the grenade gear for it to become useful.  That said even the stock grenade count is alright if you go with another gear, especially in the Talon Merc (and I agree that a melee build is super viable on him -- the bow can put out some very healthy DPS and you can just stick an accurate semi automatic weapon or shotgun on him to fire in between shots from the bow)."

We open the fourth slot to the public since we're new to Gold and can't 3-man it.   First guy we get seems good. Geth infiltrator, he's on top of the scoreboard for the two waves. Third wave, it's 1234, he rushes the objective and gets downed immediately. He uses medigel. And gets downed again two seconds later. We're new to gold, so we're being cautious, slowly making our way over, but the guy must've taken it to mean we didn't care and ragequits. We make it to wave 8 with just the three of us before failing.  Second round, we get a volus who has no idea what he's doing. He was at least trying, but every time we turn around for two seconds he's down, and we res'ed him when we could, but sometimes he was too far away or too crowded. He never once used medigel, and he was basically deadweight. We got to wave 8 and failed.  Third match, a guy hopped in the lobby. N7 30something, level 18 and used no equipment. Not even gear. I thought about kicking him, but he had a decent amount of challenge points for his N7 level, so I thought he might be a smurf and decide to give him a chance. Turns out he was just using us to farm credits. Beginning of the match, he runs out to the middle of the map and dies. Doesn't use medigel. He does this for every wave, eventually just AFKing. On wave 8, like fucking clockwork, we fail, and he finishes with like 400 points total for 8 waves of fucking gold.

I've been doing a run of playing with every single character and gun, so I hadn't used my Ghost Infiltrator for a while. So I loaded up my Harrier and all my best equipment and started a lobby. And then I figured since I haven't really soloed before I should start on Silver to be safe.  Holy crap the damage I was doing. Basic troopers died in like four shots, and I could take down a Prime in about a clip and a half. Overall it was easier than playing Gold on a team with the classes I've been using lately.

MECoOp,3awxu9,TheOmnomnomagon,2,Wed Jun 24 13:52:40 2015 UTC,"I've got more rants to add. Most of them bug related. On Vancouver, last guy left alive on a Gold wave 9. Lost a medigel because I got stuck at the top of a ladder. Completely froze and I took 3 rockets up the ass. Also lost a medigel because my guy wouldn't hop over cover no matter how much I mashed spacebar. Lost another medigel getting shot from a Geth Bomber through the wall and couldn't figure out where it was coming from. until I died. Couldn't finish them off, so we failed.  On another wave, for a full minute I lost my casting animations. I actually died recasting combat drone over and over, seeing if it would appear and not paying attention to my surroundings.  Wave 10 gold, we were getting carried by some guy the whole game. We finish the object, and then that guy gets sync killed by a banshee. He proceeds to ragequit as the host, restarting the wave. Luckily we extracted, but I had to blow all my missiles, op packs, and medigel.  At the end wave 11, with 2 seconds left. I took some Ravager missiles to the face and had a sliver of health left. I mashed space bar to take cover, but (I suppose as intended) I end up hopping over the cover OUT of the extraction circle, losing the bonus. I guess that one's my fault.  As the Alliance Infiltration Unit, this has happened 3 times so far, where I'm dying, and I mash the repair matrix power. The UI literally appears on the screen as successfully casting it, but I still die without res'ing. I literally had the green repair matrix UI AND the DYING UI on at the same time. Nothing more infuriating.  I can't get the quarian engineer. I've played 140 hours on two systems, and I've been eyeing her since I started, but I can't get her. In the meantime, I have every volus known to man, even though I'm not a fan of playing voluses.

MECoOp,3awxu9,othellothewise,4,Wed Jun 24 12:25:14 2015 UTC,"Welp... if b-tching about bad games is the flavor of the week... I just got through a 58 MINUTE Gold PUG.  Yeah.  Dusted off the Asari Adept (haven't played her in months), couldn't find a match so decided to host.  A BatSol, Geth Engy, and low level KroSent.  I kind of knew some carrying might be needed going in, but turns out I wasn't the one ""carrying"" per se.  We get Ghost Hazard.  KroSent basically died within the first 5 seconds of every round and bled out.  I ended up doing most of the damage, but for some reason we kept getting separated; got sync killed by a Brute for the first time in a long while after everyone went down as I was trying to revive the others, then when nobody bothered to revive me I gelled into the sync kill.  That's when I realized why we kept getting separated.  The BatSol was playing like he was soloing, and he ended up soloing most of that wave.  He did a great job kiting, but spent about 99% of the time running and 1% missing with his Kishock (w/drill rounds) and mostly chucking Inferno Grenades when the ammo boxes regenerated them.  By far the most scared sh-tless player I've seen -- down to one Banshee, the Geth Engy got on the mic and goes ""just use a rocket dude""... and took him a full minute making sure he got close enough but not to sync kill range.  The Engy rage quit at some point so it was just me, Captain Slow, and Leroy Jenkins.  No cohesiveness and I was so squishy and had expended so much gel, Mr. BatSol had to solo another couple waves.  I actually left to take a shower during one of them and came back to him still with a couple spawns to kill.  Finally I got the hang of it and just followed him in the big circles, the one time he ever revived me was because I ran up to him after a Banshee warp ball followed me through a hallway.  That seemed to help as I could turn some of his panic nades into fire explosions.  Ended up as my highest scoring match ever at around 198k, Captain Slow managed a respectable 120k+ due to all the carrying he did and Mr. Useless got something like 5k the whole match.  I totally would've quit, but I didn't want to be a jerk and restart a wave after the guy had spent half an hour completing it..."

One of those few occasions where I actually felt I was good at the game.  Rant: Two games in a row I got disconnected on Wave 11, both on Gold. Forty minutes completely wasted. Screw you, netcode. Also, in the last week I've played, I bled out twice; every other time I died (which was depressingly often) was through sync-kills. Apparently enemies don't have to melee you first any more. They can just do it whenever they want.  In between: Jumped into a Gold lobby as a Krolord, and had a quick giggle when everyone else decided to switch to Krogan classes. When the game started, I realized they were all melee builds. It was great. Mooks might as well have not even spawned, and bosses just died. Then on wave 8, I guess we all got overconfident and separated, and managed to all get sync-killed within about 5 seconds of each other. But still, four melee Krogan working together is terrifying."

MECoOp,3at4bf,ShenBear,4,Tue Jun 23 08:15:41 2015 UTC,"Obligatory link to the college post on the store.  According to that, the best pack for uncommon mods is either the spectre pack or PSP, while the best pack for uncommon gear is still the VP. However, anecdotally, certain rare mods and maybe gears seem to just never drop in VPs at all. Traditional wisdom dictates that at this point you switch to Spectres, because they have the best balance of providing you with gear, mods, characters, weapons, and consumables for where you're at. But you could also jump straight to one of the 99k packs if you're playing Gold games and have a decent supply of consumables (perhaps buying a JEP every now and then to restock).  /u/gilgamesh_v9 indicated in a recent post that he believed arsenal packs were the best to buy for uncommon mods and gear. I'm not sure how he came to that conclusion - hoping he will weigh in here - but APs are unquestionably the best pack for rare weapons, and tied as best for URs, and those are probably the things that will make the biggest impact on your effectiveness at MECoOp right now.  Also, see this post from /u/ginja_ninja in the other store-related thread that just got posted."

AR damage barrel (Extended Barrel) is an uncommon, damage+piercing (High-Velocity Barrel) is a rare.  Honestly, I feel like what packs you buy depends on how fast you go through equipment vs how fast you make credits. There's something to be said for both strategies (maxing commons and uncommons first vs. starting with PSPs right away) but I found I had a lot of trouble when I first started out and was only buying Spectre packs and above, but I could only consistently play Bronze. I was always out of equipment and consumables unless I bought JEPs, and then I could only get a PSP or SP once in a while.

MECoOp,3as7u8,smedes,5,Tue Jun 23 04:34:03 2015 UTC,"Spectre packs, PSPs, and Reserves packs do this. You are also getting 250k xp each time, but if you're not promoting then unfortunately it's a total waste. Arsenal Packs will not drop common character cards if you have them maxed. But then you're going to have a much tougher time getting the juggernaut from APs.  To answer your question of how do you tell if you have everything maxed, go to your N7HQ page:  http://social.bioware.com/n7hq/home/inventory/?name=your gamertag/origin ID or whatever&platform=your platform  So for example mine is here:  http://social.bioware.com/n7hq/home/inventory/?name=djsmedes&platform=pc"
MECoOp,3as7u8,ginja_ninja,2,Tue Jun 23 06:09:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say regular spectres are your best bet. 300k gets you 5 spectres or 3 PSPs. For that amount, in a spectre you'll get 15 silver drops and 5 gold drops. In the PSPs you'll get 6 silver drops and 6 gold drops. You'll max your weapon mods much quicker that way. Once you don't have any silver items/characters/mods you care about getting left, then you can think about moving on to PSPs.  Even still though, once you max silver items you start to get level III consumable gear in their place whenever the game rolls you supposed to having gotten a drop for a silver card that's maxed. Spectres can be a really good way to build up a stockpile of level III gear to perform more effectively in golds/plats."
MECoOp,3as7u8,osamabinballer,4,Tue Jun 23 05:30:46 2015 UTC,From memory I pretty sure Premium spec packs have the highest general chance for ultra rares compared to other packs. Hit those up if you're looking for your harrier.  Plz correct if I'm wrong

MECoOp,3as7u8,Mgamerz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:59:47 2015 UTC,The 7.5% chance only applies of all things below it are maxxed. If you have say an uncommon not maxed it gets a dice roll before the UR even gets a chance to drop.
MECoOp,3as7u8,smedes,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:24:33 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound right. Are you sure? I'm pretty sure the ""rare slots"" are designated as such because they are guaranteed to produce a rare or better. And I know you don't have to have rares maxed to get URs..."
MECoOp,3as7u8,Mgamerz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:17:11 2015 UTC,Yes. If your rares are not maxed a slot that drops a UR will have to fail a chance at getting a rare.  E.g. You are missing 1 rare and 1 UR. I don't remember the rare drop rate (let's say 40%). UR is 7.5%. So when the game is choosing what to give you it first calculates the 40% chance. If you win that RNG check you get a rare and no chance at an UR. If it fails then you get a 7.5% at UR. If that check fails it goes to a backup pool since all RNG checks failed (typically a silver or gold card pool). So effectively you have less than 7.5% since you don't see the intermediate steps.  When rares are maxed you don't have that Pre RNG check so you get a full 7.5% chance.  Source: I'm the guy who posted the 7.5% drop rate and the game code showing it
MECoOp,3as7u8,smedes,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. But for a 99k pack the backup pool would be gold-only (for the last 2 slots) right?"
MECoOp,3as7u8,Mgamerz,2,Sun Jun 28 05:14:29 2015 UTC,Yeah. But the card color and card rarity are separate.
MECoOp,3as7u8,gilgamesh_v9,2,Sun Jun 28 15:50:44 2015 UTC,"My friend and I wondered the same thing a while back. I could dig up my journal of all the math if you like but here's the TL;DR. All numbers are based on data from the college and unconfirmed.  Uncommon Mods: Arsenal Pack  Uncommon Gear: Arsenal  Rare Weapons: Arsenal  Rare Characters: Reserve  Rare Mods: Premium Spectre  Rare Gear: Reserve  Ultra Rares: Equal chance in all 99k packs  EDIT: I checked my notebook and this is a bit misleading. The stuff I said up there was based off of the numbers of calculated chances of items dropping per pack not the most efficient method of purchasing packs. To answer your question, OP, you should be grinding a mix of Spectre Packs and Reserve Packs. UR's have an equal chance to drop from all 99k packs, so the Harrier will still drop from a Reserve Pack even though its a weapon. Geth Juggernaut is more likely in a Reserve pack and Spectre Packs appear to be best for Uncommon Mods."
MECoOp,3as7u8,smedes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:22:33 2015 UTC,How did you reach the conclusion of APs for the uncommon mods and gear? College seems to indicate that either spectres or PSPs are best for uncommon mods and VPs are best for uncommon gear.
MECoOp,3as7u8,gilgamesh_v9,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:09:03 2015 UTC,"I double checked my notebook and I had the data for chances of items to drop per pack. I'm trying to recreate the math but I drew the conclusion that Arsenal Packs have a higher chance to drop UC mods PER PACK. Of course you get 5 times as many packs buying Veterans than Arsenals, so its more EFFICIENT to buy those. My mistake."
MECoOp,3as7u8,smedes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:53:10 2015 UTC,"aaah, I can see how that might be the case due to slots being used for other things and stuff."
MECoOp,3as7u8,othellothewise,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:29:06 2015 UTC,If you don't have your uncommons maxed out already you will many times pay 99k for a PSP and just get uncommons. So I would max out your uncommons first it doesn't take too long. If you really want to go for fancier weapons or characters and can't wait you can buy an arsenal or reserves pack every once in a while.
MECoOp,3as7u8,smedes,3,Tue Jun 23 04:08:20 2015 UTC,Not true - you will always get 2 rares or URs in a 99k pack. What you lose by not maxing uncommons first is the additional equipment from the first three slots in the 99k packs that you miss when an uncommon weapon drops.

MECoOp,3apzcl,snaildarter,6,Mon Jun 22 15:48:06 2015 UTC,"jesus, I haven't even done a bronze solo. I always fail at objectives due to being overrun."
MECoOp,3apzcl,redx1105,3,Mon Jun 22 21:54:56 2015 UTC,"Move in big circles. They follow you to one side of the map, then you sprint unseen back to the objective, completing the circle. And they slowly work on completing the circle while you deal with whatever objective you're working on. Takes some practice. But a good key is to do big circles. And not kill until the objective is complete. If you murder everything, everything just respawns somewhere else to screw with your plans. So let them live, and let them slowly try to catch up, then run away. You win by surviving and extracting, not always by being a murder train."
MECoOp,3apzcl,smileymcface,2,Tue Jun 23 03:11:03 2015 UTC,"I just did my second Bronze solo to see how I've progressed skill-wise -- absolute overkill but I used an Asari Huntress with a Valiant IV, Geth Scanner, and Cyclonic IV to fight on Giant/Reapers.  Total easy mode, didn't even break a sweat but I realized that I'm really not that great at kiting.  Is there a good way to get the enemies to bunch up, especially when they spawn in multiple locations?  I seemed to have more luck the first time around when I did it with a Valkyrie, but maybe that's just because I was so close to the mobs that they'd bunch up anyway."
MECoOp,3apzcl,cymikelee,2,Tue Jun 23 07:05:54 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. The best way to run into a bunch of folks is to go spawn point to spawn point. You'll learn the more you play where enemies come from and can plan accordingly. On small maps (like firebase white) you can just about force the starting spawn by yourself. You do this by understanding the spawn mechanics which basically boil down to if you're nearby, they can't spawn there. So. On small maps. You can stand between spawns and it will force enemies to spawn elsewhere. Then run for the next spawn, kill all the things, head to the next spawn and so on.   High risk/high reward and be painful if you don't watch it though. If you're mopping up mobs on bronze. Try to solo silver. It will force you to learn to kite. The hardest part about kiting is memorizing layouts of the maps so you don't have to keep breaking away and turning around to see where you're going. Try to work on that. Kiting keeps you alive and thus is awesome."
MECoOp,3apzcl,smileymcface,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:32:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it sounds like practice is the best way huh?  I don't particularly enjoy soloing but I'll be sure to move up to Silver next time, using high level consumables felt like a waste on Bronze."
MECoOp,3apzcl,cymikelee,2,Wed Jun 24 02:35:30 2015 UTC,"Yup. Exactly. And don't kill yourself trying to make a solo happen, that can kill your enthusiasm in a hurry.   And on your next ""test the waters"" solo. Don't stock up on your good equipment and see how far you can get. Make through wave 7 and you're golden/ready to rock with the equipment. No point in wasting good stuff on a solo when you don't extract anyways.   One last thing. If you're already Doing bronze solos, try to make silvers a regular thing. Then, when you step down a level to solo, you're used to Stronger enemies and it'll seem easier."
MECoOp,3apzcl,smileymcface,4,Wed Jun 24 02:46:18 2015 UTC,I've platinum solo'd with the huntress before.  The key with her is to dark channel and run away and wait for it to do the killing especially on phantoms since killing phantoms is a great way to run out the wave budget.  Took me 92 minutes with her but my record is 43 minutes with the geth trooper.  Most people don't find platinum soloing fun but i find trying new characters to do it and making things tough for me is quite fun.  Patience is key especially since you've already pointed out the biggest part in surviving it is to stay on the move and not get overrun.
MECoOp,3apzcl,RightHandofGod,2,Mon Jun 22 22:14:14 2015 UTC,"That's the way I tried it.  Tried to just leave DC running and rarely ever getting exposed to enemies.  I just couldn't pull it off.  If I tried 10 more times with her, maybe I'd get lucky.  Some objectives just seemed impossible as squishy as she is.  But hats off to anyone who can do it."
MECoOp,3apzcl,RightHandofGod,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:23:34 2015 UTC,When i platinum solo i almost always choose giant since it's the easiest to kite enemies into laps and i also almost always take survivor loadout (20% shields and +3 ops packs) since it's all about survival rather than dps and time. What map were you doing it on?
MECoOp,3apzcl,Meowmageddon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:38:44 2015 UTC,"Giant.  Reapers usually.  Just couldn't get it done.  Extra ops packs is a good idea.  Very hard for me to give up Geth Scanner though, and while I'd be gaining survivability with those ops packs, I'd be losing the ability to see the Marauder hiding around a corner. Tough decision for me!"
MECoOp,3apzcl,cymikelee,3,Mon Jun 22 22:56:14 2015 UTC,"Solid tips, just wanted to add.  Kiting is pretty much the most important thing to learn- not just bailing when you know you're overrun, but also knowing where to go next, and how to get there while minimizing enemy line of sigbt on you from odd angles. Once you know your route it really just is a matter of time and how careful you are, even if you have crap guns.  Giant is popular not only because of it's loops, but the fact that walls and ramps keep you out of line of sight, and also force enemies to approach slowly. Furthermore, when they cross the center they tend to hug the short cover whether they need to or not- making the approach much more manageable. The super popular camp spot at LZ makes it very easy to separate out cover busters and fast mobs without having to worry about getting sniped. Compare that to Hydra or Jade where long stretches of traversal have to be made while being fully exposed to enemy fire.  As Ive practiced more Ive found that main waves arent so much a threat so much as running out of time with objectives... Getting pushed out of a stationary hack either times me out or forces me to kite the pack around and expose myself to unnecessary risk. FML if I get target waves multiple times and I dont have rockets left."
MECoOp,3apzcl,blackmarketdolphins,3,Tue Jun 23 00:58:33 2015 UTC,"Wait so, for #2, what did you end up using if not the Huntress?"

At this point, I think I could maybe get through a plat solo with her in maybe 10 more tries, but I'm never going to know."
MECoOp,3apzcl,Chypsylon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:23:14 2015 UTC,"Let's see as a Drell Assassin I could consistently get to Wave 8 on my Hydra/Reaper solos, but he just couldn't take more than on hit and as soon as I wait for my shields to return, the Banshee has her barriers partially back. Then I tried the Huntress and Vorcha Sent, got to Wave 9 with the Vorcha against Collectors. Then I tried the Ghost and got to Wave using only one medigel, and the objectives screwed me because I got Targets 3 times in a row. And against Collectors, I ran out of time and missiles. I did it again with the Ghost and would've had 10 Waves Survived, but a Phantom spawned behind me and I thought I could tank it, but I was wrong."
MECoOp,3apzcl,natlouwet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"There were a lot of little things I learned while doing this solo, things I never noticed so much while playing Plat PUG's, which made me a better player.  Eventually figured out just how far around a Phantom I needed to run to avoid a sword hit (and stagger).  Unlike team games, there were not random bullets flying everywhere, and you had more time to study the exact ways the enemies would attack.  But even now, Banshees will still teleport from a hidden position through a wall and grab me.  Or blindside me across the map with a heat-seeking ball o' death.  That was especially problematic with a Huntress, with no recourse except to bleed to death or use consumables.  I died a lot of times from Banshees.  On the successful plat solo, I ran every time I could even hear one of those things a medium distance from me.  And yet still there was an instance where I was sure she was going to grab me.  Just got lucky I guess.  Which actually brings me to another tip for some characters: When you are trapped in a corner, it's much more difficult to be synced by a Banshee by repeatedly dodging every direction until you have somehow pinballed out.  At least for a Ghost."

Any sooner and you will not have a full clip, any later you are wasting time. I find it pretty much impossible to cancel the Avenger/Harrier animations because they are so short.  This works for pretty much any game, not just ME3, but the methods will obviously differ."

MECoOp,3apcaq,Meowmageddon,4,Tue Jun 23 01:52:29 2015 UTC,"Just a tidbit for the reload cancelling on console, on dodgeless characters it tends to be best to do a back dash/jump command since if you aim in other directions you'll often end up sticking to cover.   On dodge characters, mis-inputting the command (resulting in walking back and pressing A on Xbox, like trying to trigger running while walking backwards) will also reload cancel but isn't really consistent enough to be worth it.   The most common way is to use Tac Cloak or any other power with a long cd, as that hitting the button while the ability is on cd just ends the reload animation. With shorter cd powers one can just straight up use the power to continue to another action more quickly as well, but this is less ideal and less controllable."

As a bigger gesture I kind of like it for muscle memory too...

MECoOp,3alguz,cyzward,4,Sun Jun 21 13:43:02 2015 UTC,"Your mileage will definitely vary here. It depends entirely on what you care most about unlocking. If all that matters to you is getting the Rares and Ultra Rares as soon as you can, you should go straight to PSPs (or one of the specialized variants) and never buy anything else. If you think the uncommons are plenty good enough and want to get some good ones quickly, Veteran packs are a good bet.  Overall, my recommendation would be to stick to Veteran packs until you have some basic guns of each type and most importantly can consistently fill all your Gear and Weapon Mod slots with something at least somewhat useful, since leaving those empty is a huge waste. Once you have that, go on to maxing Rares and Ultra Rares with PSPs."

First off, you'll want to start on Bronze just because its the easiest. Play around with the default human classes until you find your playstyle. The starting classes are actually all pretty good and are a great introduction to how the class works with the rarer characters. If you're looking for some direction on how to build classes, check the Big Bad List of Builds (BBLoB) linked on the sidebar. Experimenting with builds is definitely a good thing to do, but wait until you have a good feel for the class first. When it comes to pack buying, start with recruit packs and make sure you max out all your Common level gear. This is good to do as it prevents more expensive packs from rewarding you with worse gear, and some of the Common/Uncommon weapons are pretty good.

MECoOp,3acwqs,cymikelee,36,Fri Jun 19 02:17:50 2015 UTC,"Heh. Look at these pyjaks. A real warrior doesn't roll out of the way of a charging brute. Or use *tch* jetpacks.  Real talk, I'm more of a purist so my vote for utility is for the basic human combat roll. Quick and simple. Although special shoutout to the N7 Fury teleport move. Probably the only reason I managed to complete a gold solo with her.  Although if we're talking about purely how they look? Volus all the way."
MECoOp,3acwqs,bughumbar,20,Fri Jun 19 02:23:55 2015 UTC,The fact that Volus characters even have a combat roll is amazing. It just looks and feels satisfying through and through.

The Turian Cabal's dodge is awesome because, like a few other characters, it teleports through walls, but does so a lot faster than the others (you don't have to do that stupid flip animation)."
MECoOp,3acwqs,smedes,5,Fri Jun 19 04:59:10 2015 UTC,The fact that the Asari dodge consumes barriers has always made it a no no for me. It just seems counter productive.
MECoOp,3acwqs,jxcream,13,Fri Jun 19 08:32:45 2015 UTC,"It only consumes a small amount. Sacrificing a small bit of shield usually saves you a lot more headache in the long run, especially if you are dodging something that will stagger you. Of course, there are excellent dodges like the human roll that don't use up any shield; fair point. But as the asari dodge is so ungodly quick -- and rapidly chainable in a way that the human dodge roll is not -- I prefer it.  When I say chainable, I mean you can dodge in any pattern for as long as you want (e.g. left, left, back, left, left) without any noticeable delay time between the  dodges. Try doing that with a human."
MECoOp,3acwqs,smedes,4,Fri Jun 19 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"Like, when playing the Asari then using the dodge is perfectly plausible. When choosing a character, the dodge is a reason to not play the Asari.

The hop doesn't always get you out of trouble to the extent of the others, but it's nice for side-stepping projectiles and especially warp-balls. The jetpack is wonderful for its speed and distance, but you travel so far that it can be unwieldy at times.   The Asari slide is an odd one. It's fun, but I don't feel that successful dodging stuff with it. Plus, the shield thing. Same with the cartwheels, I feel like by the time the dodge starts, I've already been hit by whatever I was trying to dodge. This is just probably due to me sucking, however.  But my favorite dodges are the teleports. They're so bloody stylish, and the mobility they offer is absolutely stupid."

Put a Geth Scanner on her, pop in and out for sneak attacks with dodge, heavy melee, and Poison Strike.  Adrenaline Mod 3 to make it completely unfair, of course."
MECoOp,3acwqs,AJockeysBallsack,3,Fri Jun 19 13:22:48 2015 UTC,"The Vorcha dodge is just extremely useful all-around.  It has practically no wind-up or wind-down animation.  It doesn't use up shields like the Asari dodge (which wouldn't be a big deal for Vorcha, but it would be nice for the Asari not to lose shields).  It also feels like you have a bit of directional control during the short dodge animation.  Oh, and it looks pretty sweet.  The Asari dodge is definitely a close second.  It's extremely fast, has decent distance, and can stagger and kill enemies (counts as a melee kill).  The only issue is that shield loss reset your shield recharge.  It's a fair price to pay for such a quick dodge, though.  Third is probably the Fury/Slayer/Cabal because it has that cool mechanic.  The shield recharge is still bad, and the wind-up animation is a bit lengthy, but moving through walls opens up a lot of options."
MECoOp,3acwqs,Potataro,3,Fri Jun 19 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"Cabal doesn't have the wind-up that the Fury and Slayer have, and if you're hurting for shields, use Biotic Focus."

As for Biotic Focus, I think the question was just about dodge, not the powers, etc. associate with the character's dodge.  Otherwise, the jet-boots dodge would be considered better than normal thanks to Havoc Strike, dodge."

MECoOp,3acwqs,Potataro,7,Fri Jun 19 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"Armiger is definitely amazing, but the Vorcha and the biotic teleport are next imo.  Armiger dodge covers a lot of ground and is extremely reliable. The Vorcha was my favorite before the Turian and N7 classes. It made your hitbox smaller, and the pivot never really threw off my aim. The biotic teleport is tied with the Vorcha. It eats into your barriers and definitely messes with flow of action since you never know exactly where your going to teleport to or next to. The redeeming qualities outweigh the negatives, and with Geth Scanner you can set your attacks with your ability to go through walls."

MECoOp,3acwqs,Shiboleth17,3,Fri Jun 19 06:38:54 2015 UTC,"Asari is the best, hands down.  It's so good they had to make it deplete your barriers just to use it.  It MUST do deplete barriers and stop recharge, otherwise it would be OP.  It's super fast, easy to use, and you can chain them together to get where you need to be.  The Justicar would not be among the elite characters if she didn't have the asari dodge, since it's absolutely necessary for pulling off that Reave>Bubble>Reave double BE combo to prevent yourself from getting sync killed.  I'm not a big fan of the Collector/Turian flight.  I feel like you're not really dodging stuff since you're raising your profile, and it just generally feels kinda slow and clunky to me.  Not to mention that it goes way too far.  I don't need a dodge to take me halfway across the map, I just need to duck behind this cover right here.  When you fly-dodge, you go past the cover, and now you're back out in the open.  Maybe if it had an option to do a half dodge so you don't go so dang far...  Teleporting - great idea, works well when you can pull it off right, but either I haven't quite mastered it yet, or it just doesn't really seem to do what I want sometimes, especially when trying to go forward.  That, and while you think teleport would be fast, it's really not all that fast compared to asari or standard human dodges.  Shadow/Drell acrobatics - love it, probably my second favorite.  Human roll and quarian/salarian/geth hop are ok.  Nothing wrong with them at all, but nothing particularly interesting either."

MECoOp,3acwqs,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sun Jun 21 23:52:20 2015 UTC,"Asari's is the best in terms of sheer responsiveness and basically no recovery, able to be spammed like no tomorrow to get out of hairy situations or look cool in between rounds, but preventing shield regen is a significant detriment. The Ghost/Havoc's offers exceptional mobility once you know how and when to use it with the ability to zip around corners, but the massive distance is a double-edged sword making it unwieldy in tighter areas. Overall I'd say the human dodge is the best all-around. Good frame data with little recovery, allows for precision, chains nicely into cover, and to top it all off it looks cool (backflips off ladders all day). I like the feel and timing of it better than the hops though I'm not really sure how different the two actually are. It feels like the roll is a little easier to dodge stuff with, and the side one seems to conserve momentum a little better than the hop, which has a bit of lag where the character very briefly pauses in place before you can move freely again. Also I'm not sure if the low profile actually reduces your hitbox or if that really even matters, but it would certainly be cool if it did.  Also honorable mention to drell ninjaflips. They're like a nice middle ground between the hop and the jetpack. A little bit of ending lag on the sideways one, but much better distance coverage than the hop. The backwards dodge is really useful. If the teleports had the drell's frame data they'd be the best dodges in the game but they're extremely laggy and don't appear to give much if any invincibility, which is stupid because you can get hit while you're not even in physical space. Still quite useful on the slayer though immediately after a charge to get yourself out of sync-kill range."

MECoOp,3acni1,sol_in_vic_tus,2,Sat Jun 20 00:26:03 2015 UTC,"Just keep at it, it will become easier and easier to remember how you play each character."

I experimented around for a while with different characters, classes and weapons and fell in love with the krogan sentinel. It's just a tank that can take damage all day and dish out double when properly equipped.  I run with him on gold and silver matches pretty smoothly."
MECoOp,3acni1,poohbear85,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:54:34 2015 UTC,"Those long light melee animations get me killed a lot!  I like using the jab on most characters to stagger mooks in my face, but then I activate it on a Geth or Collector and get killed instead.  It's supposed to be light!  I also seem to enter into the combo on the Shadow and Slayer a lot too, it'd be nice to be able to cancel after 1 or 2 hits instead of being forced to go through all 3."
MECoOp,3acni1,cymikelee,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"I've generally had a small set of characters I feel comfortable playing (the AIU and Turians at first, of course), but yeah I've had trouble figuring out some classes too.  Some of it is just practice with soft cover/RHA on squishier characters, but often you just need to figure out the build and playstyle that fits you best.  I couldn't get the Asari Huntress to work until I played her from long range with a sniper rifle, and I've had better luck on weapons classes with a shotgun as my secondary instead of a sniper, and closing the distance accordingly.  You could try characters that have similar safety features to ease your way into other classes -- Vanguards with biotic charge for instance, or any of the classes with damage reductions (Reave, Tech Armor/Barrier, Krogan Rage, etc).  Infiltrators might be good too, with cloak, and you can always try other characters with the flying dodge like the Saboteur, TGI, or Collector Adept."
MECoOp,3acni1,cymikelee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:42:52 2015 UTC,I think that figuring out RHA is probably the hardest part. Trying to figure out which characters can tank a few hits if I don't get into RHA properly is what's getting me screwed.

Most of my points of improvement are around extraneous stuff rather than the actual gameplay, as I think it's near on perfect (of course I would I've been playing it since 2012).  Ping indicator in lobbies/games  Chat in lobbies  (at least) so people can discuss things if they don't have mics.  Ability to see around when down so you can see what's going on around you, which is much less boring than just smashing spacebar.  Country indicator, like little flags or [UK] [RU] etc.  more character customisation!"
MECoOp,3a1xid,funkymustafa,9,Tue Jun 16 18:32:52 2015 UTC,"Strike Team: Spend resources to recruit mercenaries and develop AI controlled strike teams to be deployed on randomly generated, time sensitive missions. Include settlement defence and remnant artefact recovery. Strike Teams return 20 - 30 minutes later with XP, currency, and equipment depending on mission outcome. Spend money/resources to train Strike Team, and buy better equipment, to increase success rate and send on dangerous missions.  Active Strike Team: See above, however you can choose to complete the Strike Team mission manually via play using your multiplayer roster of characters. Able to play co-op with friends, more friends increasing difficulty and rewards. Bonus rewards for joining another players strike team mission. XP, loot, and customisation rewards for Strike Team played characters are cohesive with multiplayer specific horde mode.  Horde Mode: Similar to Mass Effect 3: four players against waves of enemies with additional objectives such as disabling a bomb or assassinating a target. Similar XP/loot rewards to Mass Effect 3. APEX funds earned to be used in single player.   Allegedly this is a rough outline of what MP options will be like in Andromeda. ""Strike Team"" missions seem to be singleplayer sidequests like the N7 missions in ME3. Can either send your allied bots to do it offscreen, or manually fight yourself, by using MP kits. So basically blurring the lines between SP and MP, allowing your MP characters to take on missions that affect SP. It's a great concept if it plays out as it reads. Imagine you're on an insanity playthrough and there's that side mission of ""wipe out enemy base"" or some such where you just can't crack them. Maybe it's cranked up in difficulty because there's a very valuable loot reward involved. Get some co op friends and pull out some of your MP heavy hitter kits to do the mission and reap the rewards in SP. Perhaps the mission is too difficult for your SP character who happens to be an adept, but not too hard for your Hurricane GI.   They'll probably keep the horde mode more or less the same, since it was so popular in 3, plus there is inherently much more variability and randomization. Adding credits that can be used in SP will be nice though. The strike team missions are probably static sidequests since it'd be impossible to synch them up between multiple players if they were randomly generated content.   As far as gameplay, I'm sure there will still be the fair share of ""working as intended"" bioware trolls and glitches. As long as there is nothing gamebreaking and they crush any rocket cheaters asap, I'm willing to accept some bugs."
MECoOp,3a1xid,TheHoboFish,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:31:53 2015 UTC,Strike Teams sounds great! What do you mean by them being impossible to sync up between players if they had randomly generated content?
MECoOp,3a1xid,funkymustafa,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:37:43 2015 UTC,"I'm just assuming that if you had a mission, gave it a try in SP, then tried to do it in co op, the map/layout would have to be the same for all players. It wouldnt be something where the game creates the whole mission on demand. So striketeam mission x would be the same map for everyone. Although maybe they'd do diablo-style randomization of enemies/loot to add replay value."

On the other hand, if they realize the potential that ME4MP has given the success of ME3MP, maybe Bioware will spoil us."
MECoOp,3a1xid,othellothewise,3,Wed Jun 17 00:43:24 2015 UTC,I don't know. I think random maps might be kinda cool but some of the skill in me3 is learning the maps and learning what you can do on them.  I definitely think there should be more maps though.

MECoOp,3a1xid,sindeloke,2,Thu Jun 18 18:30:55 2015 UTC,"In my praise of pets and fortification options below, I just remembered an idea I had with the supply pylon -- I always thought the magic replenishing ammo boxes were weird, considering that's not how it works in single player at all.  In adding a more tactical element to the game it'd be awesome to have to rely on some sort of supply line -- maybe alternate objective waves with resupply waves where you have to defend an LZ for a shuttle which drops off a couple of supply pylons and a heavy weapon or two.  Carrying these then becomes like a pizza delivery, but you can put them wherever you want.  That could encourage a lot more defensive play since having to displace would involve abandoning your ammo supply."
MECoOp,3a1xid,Robertamus,7,Thu Jun 18 02:32:32 2015 UTC,"For the most part I'd like to see it stay the same with a couple modifications:   Do away with the RNG. I want to level up, not gamble. Possibly implement shorter match options. Perhaps a 3 wave + extraction, a 6 wave + extraction and the full match. Some times it's frustrating to have to devote around 20 minutes per match and I wouldn't mind having the option to play a shorter game. Allow me to assign powers to what buttons I want. (probably a console only issue) Something I saw someone else suggest that I'd like to see is maybe a round or  the end culminate with a single big boss. Think something like a Reaper Harvester, or Geth Colossus. One big baddy everyone has to focus on. Everything else would be just fixing bugs and whatnot. Stupid magnet hands, fickle cover system, ect.   EDIT: my formatting was atrocious. . ."
MECoOp,3a1xid,blackmarketdolphins,5,Tue Jun 16 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"They're very married to the real-money RNG thing, they've got it in all their multiplayer games now. There's some amelioration in DA:I and SWTOR, though; in SWTOR you can sell stuff you don't want to players who do want it, and use that money to buy stuff you do want (mostly), while in DA:I MP, you can break stuff you don't want down into its component parts and use it to make stuff you want.  DA:I MP struck me as utterly boring and a pale shadow of ME3 MP, which I couldn't stop playing from the demo on out, but that loot system at least is the one thing they could stand to carry forward, if they're not going to give up their damn Skinner boxes."
MECoOp,3a1xid,Robertamus,5,Wed Jun 17 00:28:09 2015 UTC,That's slightly disappointing. I feel like that system almost punishes long term players.

MECoOp,3a1xid,TheMadMullah,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:00:29 2015 UTC,"It rewards early adopters and those who stick with it. It makes it so that those who stick with it have time to build up their manifest before another pool of items come out, instead of being overwhelmed by all the items that's available after the fact.

MECoOp,3a1xid,cymikelee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:27:59 2015 UTC,"I guess.

MECoOp,3a1xid,blarghhrrkblah,6,Thu Jun 18 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"I think they should allow us to increase the chances of getting a certain weapon. That way we can't outright buy it, but we won't be stuck just grinding and grinding trying to get that Harrier X (or Harrier I in my case).  More racial passives and racial bonuses for using canon weapons (like Geth weapon damage bonuses for Geth).   Allow us to pick up enemy grenades and throw them back. A way to block sync kills (albeit make it difficult).  I wasn't around for the early mass effect coop days, but bring back weekly challenges.  Also extra xp and credits for playing certain styles. All Asari squad, all Geth squad, etc.   A multiplayer menu where we can see current matches in progress, and choose to join a specific match.  I think harder bosses would be nice too. Banshees, Atlases and Praetorian can all be relatively easy to deal with. I think a final boss on the wave 11 extraction, or maybe one that randomly spawns once in wave 10. A crap ton of armor, shields or barriers. Its presence near other enemies gives them health, damage, and RoF boosts. Killing it should not be necessary, but you get a big xp and credit boost for doing so.  PvP could be interesting, but....I don't want them to fuck it up also, so maybe its better off as a dream."

MECoOp,3a1xid,Potataro,4,Thu Jun 18 18:56:20 2015 UTC,Make the AI just a tad bit smarter - I love the mecoop as it is now but every AI enemy is very predictable so maybe the addition of a little strategy would be interesting.
MECoOp,3a1xid,Ennbeard,10,Tue Jun 16 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"One thing they had in the beginning of CoOp that I'm still kind of irritated they lost was that very same distinct strategic difference between factions. Geth just rushed the fuck out of you while firing incessant rockets down your throat and the best way to deal with them was to set up chokepoints and stay behind cover (hence White farming). Reapers flanked you with ranged mobs and then bullrushed you with heavies and the best way to deal with them was to keep moving around the perimeter and picking off the little guys. Cerberus laid traps with turrets and stealthers and pressured you with slow Altases and Guardians (can't remember the last time I saw one of those) and the best way to deal with them was to rush them before they could get set up.  Now every faction rushes you with speedy armored vanguards and cover-busters while flanking you with ranged and the best and only strategy for any faction is constant movement paired with ""zerg them with mad deeps before they kill you."" The AI was never smart but at least it used to have some variety."
MECoOp,3a1xid,macdoge1,5,Wed Jun 17 00:25:07 2015 UTC,"I'd overhaul the character kit system:  Pick a class and a race or special kit (e.g. N7) compatible with the chosen class. This determines your base stats, your two passive powers, and your options for other powers. Pick a sex for appearances (i.e. no effect on gameplay). Pick three powers and a weapon or two. Roll out with your new build.  Also, I've always felt carrying capacity should be part of the fitness passives, not the class passives. That's just a nitpick though."
MECoOp,3a1xid,cymikelee,4,Wed Jun 17 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"Things they need to keep and expand upon:   So many playable characters, the best part of MP.  This time, give them more subtle differences though.  Geth have an extra shield recharge bonus, Batarians get more ammo, Justicar has power duration boosts, Drell get more speed, and Turians get more weapon stability.  Other than a few weapon damage/weight capacity boosts, I think that's about it, though. Hazards.  Environmental hazards are exciting, but in ME3 their predictability isn't great. Team buffing abilities.  At first biotic/tech combos, warp, and proxy mine were about the only synergy options.  Later they added things like shield boost, supply pylon and the Juggernaut's (pathetic) AoE buffing power.  Why not give more characters minor team buffs?"
MECoOp,3a1xid,Crackseed,3,Wed Jun 17 06:16:24 2015 UTC,"I did like the hazards, but they need to not make some classes unplayable because you can't see shit.  I'm looking at you, Firebase White."

Gain credits per match, and then buy upgrades with them.  Also, tying some weapons/classes to a mastery system would be cool."
MECoOp,3a1xid,Cythammer,4,Tue Jun 23 15:52:21 2015 UTC,"I'd love more fluid environments and strategery -- echoing what people have said about defensive play and Armatures/Harvesters:  Interactive Environments:  Changeable terrain (like crates in SP, but more) and fortifications would be great.  Combat drones and turrets are nice, but what about the fixed guns and one-use heavy weapons in SP?  Or shield/barrier generators?  Temporary cover?  Combined Arms:  I'm not much of a gamer so I don't know what vehicle systems work in other games, but stronger mechanics around air support, ""tanks,"" and support characters/materials could really enliven the gameplay (there are games where support can be incredibly fun, but a Volus spamming shield boost just doesn't do it for me).  Even just more z-axis variation could help -- give me a map with more than two levels!  I've always wondered why other single-player mechanics weren't brought in -- I know you can hijack an Atlas with a patch, but that'd have been awesome if built into MP with the necessary counters (maybe a damage penalty from Geth rockets).  Thresher Maws.  Linear maps (sounds like strike team might do this?).  Doors!"
MECoOp,3a1xid,DumbassAshyLarry,3,Wed Jun 17 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"I think the core of the MP ME3 had was fantastic and I want to see that expanded upon.  What I didn't like is the absurd grind/RNG to get the weapons/kits you want. Some RNG is nice, but there should also be a system for specifically working towards unlocks of items based on your preferences."
MECoOp,3a1xid,snaildarter,2,Wed Jun 17 01:00:36 2015 UTC,I would like to see actual boss battles that are challenging and have several different boss mechanics. Mass Effect 3 had 'one' boss battle but he was pathetically easy and quick to kill.
MECoOp,3a1xid,cymikelee,2,Tue Jun 16 22:36:43 2015 UTC,They really need to get rid of the super stiff animations. You snap into place all the time. And the lower damage without scoping a sniper has to go.  From the sounds of it from the interview MP sounds nearly identical including objectives.
MECoOp,3a1xid,macdoge1,2,Wed Jun 17 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"I think I'd prefer greatly reduced no-scope accuracy instead of damage, which I guess was the intent since ME3 often couples accuracy with damage (at least in terms of translating fluff to crunch). Still, it creates a dumb feel when you can measurably tell it's just doing less damage."

MECoOp,39xddc,Scarecrow1779,2,Thu Jun 18 02:14:59 2015 UTC,"My tip for pizza delivery:  Practice with Turians, Batarians and Krogan first.  They have no roll mechanic so it makes it easier.  Your first few steps you actaully want to delay mashing until you get to full run animation then start mashing away.  Its not actually about being able to select the pizza each time or anything so dont worry about that.  Practice with straight aways first even if you have to walk it most of the way only to run it on the final stretch."
MECoOp,39xddc,felassans,2,Thu Jun 18 02:20:11 2015 UTC,Do you have any tips for scoring consistent headshots with the raptor? I find that the bouncing from constantly pulling the trigger makes it hard to stay on target.
MECoOp,39xddc,dfiner,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:49:41 2015 UTC,Cover mostly. That and aiming downwards when shooting.
MECoOp,39xddc,dfiner,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:06:23 2015 UTC,I went through single player as an Infiltrator using exclusively one-shot-one-kill type sniper rifles (Mantis/M-98 Widow/Black Widow) so guns like the Raptor have been exceptionally hard for me to get used to. Do you have a favourite kit to use it on? I'd love to branch out a little bit.
MECoOp,39xddc,dfiner,3,Mon Jun 15 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"I like to think of the Raptor as sort of a battle rifle, not a standard sniper rifle. I tried it on Infiltrators before and I've never found it to work there. Personally, I like it on the N7 Paladin, Geth Trooper, and other power heavy classes to supplement damage between bursts of powers."

MECoOp,39yuxw,BritBlitz532,4,Mon Jun 15 22:17:17 2015 UTC,"If you are familiar with the game what I would do is spam recruit packs until the commons are maxed.  You'll also get character cards, attachments and other useful items and generally be able to by three for each bronze game I think.  After that depending on the kit and weapon you get in the welcome packs you may be able to jump to gold and spam PSP's.  This may be ""best"" to get you up and running as several level 1 weapons (Acolyte, Hurrincane, Black Widow and the like) or kit unlocks can easily run Gold to fill in the rest of roster until moving to Platinum.

Tried joining a Gold PUG and got immediately bumped to Platinum (Geth/Dagger).  Very low level Jugg who did alright (but probably hadn't maxed his medigel slots), very squishy Drell infiltrator, and absolutely useless Havoc.  I went Harrier/Reegar TGI and level IV incendiary + cyclonic since it was only my 4th plat.  Went on to score 185k while carrying the team to wave 10 and about 90% done with the hack, got impaled by a Banshee trying to revive my teammates having used up my missiles and everyone bled out having used up their gel.  Silly Havoc managed only 11k the whole match!  Kind of frustrating getting so close but I never imagined I had the ability to carry a team that far."

It starts off with just a Demolished and me, and  I was carrying the team's as any Turian Soldier should, but it proved to be too much. The Demolisher keep bleeding out, a Human Soldier with a Phalanx who joined on Wave 4 was functionally useless (turns out he was a N7 28), and the Shadow who can in Wave 3 was trying her darnest but it wasn't good enough. It was a pathetic match and everyone pretty much gave up, but the Demolisher refused to stay down. And after dying 2 times, and wasting 2 missiles, she begrudgingly got us to Wave 7.   At this point, I lost all faith in my team and knew I wasn't going to waste the last gel for a match that I've given up on, but somehow the Shadow and myself did just enough to keep squeeze by each round. She really had my back. Next thing I know, it's Wave 10 and we're finishing up the objective. I ended up Lone Surviving, but I was amazed that we even got past Wave 6 with the way things were going.

I used to be big on min/maxing and the general consensus around here (and elsewhere) used to be that you shouldn't put points into the missle launcher because it's ""useless"". After a while I got bored with the game and decided to build the characters the way I wanted. Maxed out Devastator mode, Missle launcher, multi frags, and a Striker X as primary weapon. Let me tell you, up until then I hadn't had as much fun with the game. He's a bit slow, but that just means you have more time to unload from a distance. Everything will simply explode and because of that you don't really need that extra survivability from Fitness.   The only downside to this build is that it's very grenade and ammo intensive so if you want this class to shine you'll have to move from ammo crate to ammo crate (preferably the one that spawns 4 nades).

MECoOp,39sv5z,InfinitePotato,2,Thu Jun 25 01:11:42 2015 UTC,Geth Scanner and Hunter Mode seems a bit redundant and unnecessary. Does the Geth Scanner stack and increase the range of Hunter Mode?

Previously I did not have the grenade capacity gear equipment, and when I finally did get it, I figured I might as well give that character a run.  I slapped a Reegar on him just because a Quarian soldier needs a Quarian weapon...and its now one of my favorite classes.  Massive AoE damages with fire explosions, and Arc grenades. Debuff with tactical scan (you can get either evolution on the last one, extra damage or temporary baby geth scanner). You can go through spawns, and bosses like its nothing. In fact I think I'll do a write up on him if there isn't one in the BBLOB."

Relying on DC and sniping from afar helps me keep in soft cover and prevents me from dying as much as I used to -- and it's been great for carrying the ends of waves on Gold PUGs.

What's kind of funny is I don't do that build anymore, I do 4 ranks in DC now and 4 ranks in fitness so I can do more damage to bosses. It's much more effective but for some reason trying the no-DC build made the class click for me."

I had tried using her for stasis sniping, grenade lobbing, all sorts of assault rifles, pistols, and shotguns, none of them clicked.    Then I got the bright idea to go for the chance of no cooldown in charge and the universal cooldown in stasis (still don't know if this actually gives you a ~70% no cooldown or not.  If somebody knows how this works please explain)  Never the less I had a blast chain charging and backing off with the asari strafe dodge to pick a new target and headshotting people up close with my talon hand cannon of armor penetration doom.

Why even play gold, then?? I've spawned into half a dozen games lately where everyone was down on wave one, so I start to clean up, and when I'm down to one or two enemies left, the host leaves. Beyond frustrating. I don't stay in lobbies anymore when the host isn't wearing consumables.  Boast: still beating friends' scores using the Avenger in gold."
MECoOp,39ozbi,othellothewise,2,Sat Jun 13 16:09:49 2015 UTC,"I recently had a match where i hosted in gold where I solo'd at least 3 waves because everyone else would die and bleed out immediately. I gave up trying to revive ppl because they would die in the middle of like 4 phantoms and an atlas and I would die trying to revive them.  The match took 40 minutes and I scored over 250k (I didn't even know that was possible aside from solos). I managed to extract too! I think it was a Lone Survivor extraction.   That was super frustrating. If I wanted to solo I would play a solo, not play a team game. I don't know why people play Gold if they cannot contribute. For the free credits I guess."

MECoOp,39ozbi,crashsuit,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the credits, I guess. Carrying is frustrating to me for two reasons. One, I'm doing a lot of extra work just so someone else can get some free credits. Two, if they dropped down a level instead, their games would go faster, they'd extract more often, they'd have a better chance of learning to play the game, and they'd probably be making around the same per hour credit wise. I hope I don't seem like I'm griping too much though. I started out from the same place as everyone else. I really don't mind pulling some extra weight and carrying now and then, but if i have to do it too often I just get exhausted and burned out, I don't have the skill and energy to carry every game. /rant"
MECoOp,39ozbi,cymikelee,2,Sat Jun 13 19:50:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it'd be really nice if people would be better at picking the difficulty level that suits them best -- I've seen it go the other way too, where someone with tens of thousands of N7 points seems to get a kick out of outscoring my level 1 fresh promote in Bronze.  It's like, chill, no need to missile a spawn with nothing but Cannibals...  As someone who very rarely leads scoreboards, it's actually satisfying to me when I'm able to carry (a wave or two on Gold, or a whole game on Silver).  I recently accidentally joined a Silver lobby with a level 19 human engie and saw a couple of fresh players (N7 and CP both under 50) and thought I'd just take it on as a challenge -- given that we got London as the map it was very much a seat of the pants game, but the teammates weren't completely useless and we managed a full extraction in the end.  I can see how repeatedly doing this on Gold could be draining though."
MECoOp,39ozbi,felassans,2,Sat Jun 13 23:50:30 2015 UTC,"It's also frustrating for people who are trying to move up at more or less the 'right' pace. I've been playing nothing but bronze (and the occasional silver or gold match with friends who agreed to carry me) for months. I can solo bronze with a couple of the tankier kits, and I can duo bronze with just about any class. I've played a few duo silver matches and had a blast. In a silver match with four competent players, I can pull my weight and sometimes even top the scoreboard. I'm not trying to boast (although this is a boasting thread), I'm just saying that I feel like I'm ready to move up to silver.  PUGs on silver are an entirely different story. I don't have the skill or the equipment to carry a silver match. But I keep dropping into lobbies with 2 or 3 other players with N7 and CP under 50 or sometimes even under 30, who don't use gear or consumables, don't help with the objectives, and spend the entire match dead. I'm getting really tired of playing the kroguard or vorcha sentinel just so I can maybe get a partial extraction.  tl;dr: Dear PUGs, please play on a difficulty where people won't have to constantly carry you, because not everyone will be able to and then it's just frustrating for everyone."

Acolyte's a little finicky if you don't have the charge time down, with the Adas you can just hold the trigger.  Only downside is that it doesn't send the ragdoll flying off like the Acolyte does :("
MECoOp,39ozbi,ARainy_DayZ,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:43:24 2015 UTC,Yeah the adas is amazing.

Phaeston has a bigass magazine with surprisingly pretty good damage. I think I slapped on extended mag and HVB... Jeez, bullets for days. Scorpion. A grenade launcher. In the size of a pistol. With nearly the weight of an assault rifle. This weapon might have an identity crisis... Striker... I'm in love... I think I found my new favorite gun. It shoots explosive rounds. On full auto. Like. Why haven't I tried this gun before. Recoil? More like DEcoil!.... With the dampener mod of course. Severely underestimated the power of the Salarian Infiltrator. Maybe that's why Cerberus always has a hard time dealing with them; always underestimating those devious Salarians.. Alliance Infiltration Unit. Who needs long range sniping when you can do close range sniping? It's pretty much the same concept, right?"

Sabotage was the shiznit in the single-player campaign; played an Infiltrator and had a blast against Cerberus and the Geth. But in MP, my converted minions almost always get blasted to smithereens before they can do any damage. Please could everyone stop shooting them.  Rave: Against Cerberus on Hydra, I Sabotaged a Turret while very close to it. And for the first time ever, though I've hacked dozens of them before, I clearly heard it say ""TARGET ACQUIRED"" in a chirpy voice, and then gunning down its hapless Engineer. Oh the lols, I was hardly able to finish the wave."

MECoOp,39ozbi,cymikelee,2,Sat Jun 13 21:07:30 2015 UTC,Turrets are literally the only thing that can take me down as a jug. Was doing a solo gold with cyclonic 4 and it was down to a pair of atlases and some asshole engineers. Atlases made it where I couldn't hit the turrets the engineers set up just far enough away to still be in range and then the engineers kept repairing the atlases.

The key was equipping weapons I could operate from range with enough burst damage to avoid exposing myself to extended fire.  On the Collector that meant switching from PPR I to CSR X, and on the Huntress that meant sniping with a Valiant (w/Locust sidearm) instead of going midrange with the Hurricane or Talon.  Finally got 120k scores in Gold with both!  Rant:  Frustrating to use up consumables on a laggy match -- was inspired by the other day's thread to take the human engie for a spin and finally leveled her to go Gold, only to be dropped into a Geth Jade match where my fire explosions would detonate a full 3 seconds after Overload hit (by which time the game would register 3 shots from a hunter and I'd be dead).  I think the only person who didn't die repeatedly in that match was the host using PPR and getting everything in the kill log."

MECoOp,39ox35,_Roark,8,Sat Jun 13 09:56:11 2015 UTC,"The way Tactical Cloak works, you can cloak, fire Snap Freeze, then immediately fire and still get the damage bonus. It's why TC and Infiltrators are considered so powerful.  Bonus would only be good if for some reason you wanted to Snap Freeze then run away still cloaked. Not sure why this would ever be a thing.  TL,DR: Damage. Always."
MECoOp,39ox35,ParagonPts,8,Sat Jun 13 10:04:31 2015 UTC,The AIU doesn't get the 6B shotgun damage boost if you're playing off-host. Either only play her on host or take bonus power for more Snap Freeze. Or skip rank 6 and throw more into fitness.
MECoOp,39ox35,bughumbar,3,Sat Jun 13 11:16:10 2015 UTC,"Partially true. It's bugged, but things aren't as bad as you make out. If Snap Freeze breaks cloak, the next shot fired may or may not get the bonus shotgun damage applied to all its pellets, and subsequent shots should get the bonus. Here's the testing thread from BSN.  http://forum.bioware.com/topic/453850-aiu-tc-shotgun-bonus-6b-is-multiplicative-but-it-can-be-buggy-offhost/"
MECoOp,39ox35,crashsuit,3,Mon Jun 15 02:47:43 2015 UTC,Another important point to add to this. If you cancel cloak right away the cooldown is always just 3 seconds. This way it doesn't matter if you carry heavy weapons.
MECoOp,39ox35,Chypsylon,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:48:09 2015 UTC,"But the thing I noticed is, if I first fire snap freeze then fire, I do a lot less damage than if I just start firing immediately and ignore snap freeze. Granted, that may be just an illusion, but I'm 90% sure."
MECoOp,39ox35,Salsadips,4,Sat Jun 13 10:46:15 2015 UTC,Tac cloak works on a duration. So when you shoot (or use a power) then you will get the cloak bonus for 2.5 seconds afterwards meaning you can use both the power and the shot to be affected by the cloak damage bonus.  This is particularly good for the GI since you can shoot proxy mine and get the debuff AND the cloak bonus if youre fast enough.
MECoOp,39ox35,Jaysers,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:58:06 2015 UTC,"Question. So I've noticed that the bonus 2.5 seconds of TC works for most infiltrators, but for some reason when I play the N7 Shadow I don't get that bonus. Is this just me or is that supposed to happen?"
MECoOp,39ox35,Salsadips,3,Sat Jun 13 12:41:32 2015 UTC,You do get that bonus. It works exactly the same way.
MECoOp,39ox35,Jaysers,2,Sat Jun 13 13:23:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. Guess I need to test out Shadow more. TC breaks as soon as I fire my first shot, so maybe I'm doing something wrong on my end."
MECoOp,39ox35,Salsadips,5,Sat Jun 13 13:28:44 2015 UTC,Its supposed too. The duration is for 2.5 seconds after that.
MECoOp,39ox35,Scioso,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:52:28 2015 UTC,That's the point I was making. It seems to me like 2.5s minus snap freeze long enough to empty a reeger clip? It seems to me it's not.
MECoOp,39ox35,BlackwoodJohnson,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:52:31 2015 UTC,It should be. Also make sure your snap freeze has the extra 10% all damage point.

Put a Raider, a Crusader, or a Reegar on it, and with the shotgun damage, you will obliterate your targets.  Hell, if you're fine with the single shot, go nuts with the Claymore.  The damage is so vastly overpowered, that even if you just fire snap freeze off later, or before you cloak, you'll annihilate whatever you want to."

Asari Adept  Human Soldier  Turian Sentinel  I've played the TSol quite a bit and have come to prefer this build.  Normally I'd use a Typhoon but for OG weapons the Saber, Talon, Paladin, Scorpion, Hurricane all shine on him."
MECoOp,39eai3,AaronEh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:52:05 2015 UTC,Yep I actually saw that Claymore Tset build. My compliments. I have a pretty noobish sexbot build that uses her with TC bonuses/reload cancels and it absolutely wrecks. I shall try that that Saber build though. Looks promising.
MECoOp,39eai3,Egyptian_Rhino,4,Thu Jun 11 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the Turian Soldier. He takes weapons that can be hard to control even with a stability mod and (thanks to passives and marksman) completely reigns them in. I like using him with the hurricane, since he makes it usable at distances over 20 feet. Proxy mine is great for bosses or if you've got a weapon that isn't so unwieldy.   Another one of my favorite vanilla classes is the Salarian Infiltrator with a widow, or even a mantis. He's one of the best users of the ""cloak-immediately use a power-immediately shoot cycle"" that infiltrators do.   For powers classes I like the Human Sentinel using one of the builds on the BBLOB (would link but on mobile) - I think it's the throwslinger, but it's my favorite vanilla powers class along with the drellguard (I usually take the bonus power charge evo with the latter, since 50% of his shields is not much and with the movement speed consumable he becomes so incredibly mobile).   Honorable mentions to the novaguard and human sentinel/adept (especially with the acolyte) for BOOM."

I really like these human vanguard and human soldier builds and yet I don't see many with the same builds. They're a bit squishier than the other races and are somewhat difficult to use, however they are extremely satisfying and can deal some decent boss and mook damage with a bit of finesse.  It's interesting to also use these characters to show the strengths and weaknesses of power builds and weapon builds. Collectors and those bee swarms can screw over your vanguard if you aren't careful, but it doesn't matter nearly as much on the soldier because of frags and passive weapon damage bonuses."

He ran an Asari Valkyrie, one guy picked a Geth Engineer, and the other picked an N7 Destroyer.  Reactions were had when we got to the prefab structure in the center of the map, and then suddenly Banshees.  I have to admit, that match taught me how to use Flamer properly instead of just doing full burns like a lemming, so I ended up getting second place.

MECoOp,397w5m,Chypsylon,6,Tue Jun 9 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"A few things:   The armor damage reduction doesn't need to be overcome before any damage gets through - every bullet will do a minimum of 5. Of course that's effectively 0 on gold. The HVB isn't necessarily superior to the uncommon level piercing mod. It depends on what other mods/ammo you need to equip. You will usually do more damage with something like warp or incendiary ammo, an extended barrel, and the stock piercing. But sometimes you would rather take ammo mods, or power magnifiers, or whatever."
MECoOp,397w5m,smedes,3,Wed Jun 10 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"Great post... re: SMGs, does that mean to always choose HVB over extended barrel?"
MECoOp,397w5m,cymikelee,7,Tue Jun 9 22:59:34 2015 UTC,"If you don't have HVB you can use drill or armor piercing rounds to get around the armor damage reduction as well.   On higher difficulties you'll always need a way to deal with armor- so it depends on your setup- if you're running a power class you don't necessarily need your weapon to do boss damage.   Even with casters though, you'll usually want HVB or Armor Piercing to deal with Guardians if you don't have pull- even still your SMG fire will often be your filler between casts.   On biotics I usually run HVB + Warp  other casters/tech HVB +Incendiary to detonate FEs    Since I'm often running out of Incendiary and don't want to subject my team to Tech Burst overwriting, I otherwise use Ext. Barrel + ArP/Drill.   On classes on which I'm not really relying on powers, I tend to go for Ext. Barrel + Armor Piercing/Drill... However, that's really only the Turian Soldier for me since I'm keeping him in Marksman as much as possible- hence my conc. shot and prox. mine tend to be locked so I'm not really detonating with him. Sometimes also go extended magazine + heat sink + arp/drill for giant ammo reserve."

It just takes team work and synergy with your squad mates.  Good example: a friend of mine recently bought the Trilogy and of course we started playing multiplayer a bit once he hit ME3. He got lucky and unlocked the Talon Merc early. So what I did was respec my Demolisher for grenade drops and let him take them all for Trip Mines. We just camped out in the corner and wasted things, and the other two squad mates generally came and hung out with us as well since we were holding out so well. He wasn't outscoring me, but he was consistently hitting 2nd or 3rd."

They aren't the reliant on cooldown, and as long as you plan accordingly, you'll set off consistent combo explosions.   As for straight up power classes, the Human and Batarian Adept are pretty straightforward. The Fury, Flamer builds, Human Engineer, Paladin, Assassin, and Huntress can all put out some hard hitting damage. I prefer DoT heavy primer skills on Platinum like Flamer, Dark Channel, and Snap Freeze since they don't proc Banshees and such to put up their shield, which forced you to depend on your weapons  Experience, skill, and build are going to be the determining factors of what will work for you. Tinker on Gold with your classes, and focus on boss slaying. This will prepare you for Platinum."
MECoOp,395yz3,blackmarketdolphins,3,Tue Jun 9 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"You could consider the N7 Paladin. Spam the heck out of snap freeze and have your teammates detonate for many, many cryo explosions. Better yet, spam the heck out of snap freeze using geth scanner."

Fairly easy power based character to use.  Want to do something similar? Try Vorcha Sentinel. Still has Flamer, but he has Cluster Grenades for Fire Explosions. They also detonate Biotics if you have someone on your team that has them.  Have a shot with the Asari Huntress. Dark Channel with a power amped pistol/SMG and Power Amp gear/equipment bonuses can almost kill Banshees in one cast (think they survive with 2 armor bars left if I remember correctly). You can further detonate with Warp as well.  Want to try to be really squishy? Take a look at the Drell Adept and Infiltrator. Reave (4b evolution) + Cluster Grenades for Biotic Explosions for days. Tac Cloak and Homing Grenades on the Infiltrator to wreck armor and prime fire. Recon mine is nice too for extra damage (6b) and extra AOE damage. I don't recommend these if you are just starting out though, its just an option if you don't have much else  Have a biotic heavy team? Bring a Collector. Dark Sphere can prime a lot of enemies and Dark Channel is pretty good DPS on the bosses (not Asari Huntress level but still good). Detonate Dark Sphere to quickly clean up Mooks. Seeker Swarm for damage reduction if you want to be a bit more tanky. Use them to detonate explosions if you don't care.  Go N7 Paladin if your team is Tech heavy. Snap Freeze for massive debuffs and Cryo Explosions all match. Just need to remind yourself you also have other powers at times too!"

Geth Trooper - If you see Shield/Barrier, use Acolyte.  If not, use Flamer.  If you don't have the ""god-tier"" Acolyte, substitute any light, rapid-firing gun (like SMGs).  Asari Justicar - Reave everything ASAP... even something that is already Reaved (it stacks)...  If close, use the Bubble on top of enemies for a BE (they were Reaved already right??), follow up with ANOTHER Reave for ANOTHER BE.  Asari Adept - Warp -> Throw... repeat.

MECoOp,395yz3,Scioso,2,Fri Jun 12 14:22:26 2015 UTC,"How does he reset your key bindings?  I don't play on PC, but that sounds like a bug.  Just get a controller... the keyboard was designed for typing; controllers are designed for gaming.  And finicky?  They one hit kill anything that's not a boss, even on Platinum.  And even then, it only takes about 3-4 to kill bosses.  He automatically gets a new grenade every 15 seconds, so you don't even need to rely on ammo dumps that much, plus he can carry about 15 grenades.  Waves last at least 2 minutes on Platinum, plus you have at least 15 seconds of down time between waves, so you are getting about 9 new mines each wave, not counting what you get from ammo dumps, which should be another 3 or 4 per wave at least depending on if other players are using them.  And you don't even need enemies to trip the mines once you learn how to manually detonate them.  If you think they're finicky, you are probably not using them right.  I had never even tried the character for a long time after unlocking it until I saw someone own a platinum match I was in.  After that I went and specced my mines for max damage, joined a Plat match in the middle of wave 4, and I finished with double the score of second place.  Every time I bring this character into Platinum I don't score less than 200k.  I have even seen players do well with this character without even using the trip mines."
MECoOp,395yz3,Shiboleth17,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:09:07 2015 UTC,"I asked about this in a topic last week -- apparently there's a bug that causes the key binding problem with the Talon Merc if you spec into both types of arrows.  I never use concussive arrows so that solves the problem for me, but there is a software patch/tweak that solves it too if you're on PC."
MECoOp,395yz3,cymikelee,2,Sat Jun 13 05:56:43 2015 UTC,"So a lot of people are recommending power classes. These are well and good but are actually considered lower tiered then most weapon characters. The top tier characters (from highest to lowest) are the Turian Ghost Infiltrator, Geth Infiltrator, and Alliance Infiltration Unit.   The TGI is by far the best character in the game. Along with the other top two characters it has tactical cloak. This is an all around amazing ability: granting survivability, ability to hit objectives, and an amazing steroid. Stim packs can either be an ""oh shit"" saver with several frames of invincibility or a boss dps booster. His dodge is amazing (once learned it can be used for the best movement in the game). He is an assault rifle class, the Cerberus harrier is a favorite but personally I prefer the lancer (harrier is so bad with ammo). Warfighter equipment is used.  The Geth Infiltrator does damage like no other. It is the sniper class, and can be equipped with either the javelin or more popularly the Black Widow. Proximity mine is specced to extra damage taken, and fitness is the other class that is skimped on. However, this class probably takes the most skill: it is a glass cannon. It can also be set up for the piranha shotgun.  The AIU is one of the best solo classes in the game. It is a reegar class, snap freeze into mag dump. The repair matrix is one of the most useful abilities in the game. Might not be the fastest clearer in the game, but nearly impossible to kill."
MECoOp,395yz3,Scioso,4,Fri Jun 12 14:36:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately all of the easiest classes in my opinion are weapons classes, although you don't neccessarily need a high ranked weapon to do well with one.   The GT and Destroyer work well with a lot of weapons, have pretty decent shields, and a little utility to keep them safe (GT can dodge, Destroyer has stagger). They can work with snipers, shotguns, or assault rifles of almost any variety.   Power-wise some of the tankier classes would be the Krogan Adept, Valkyrie, Paladin, and Batarian Adept.   The Krogan has one of the most powerful combos in the game, DR to backup his high shields, and better than average encumbrance to handle heavier weapons.   Valkyrie is tankier than she seems- Annihilation Field drains shields from surrounding enemies while they are in the field. Less damage but more survivability compared to the Fury.  Paladin is in a similar boat as the Valkyrie. He has his heavy melee shield that helps absorb damage and Energy Drain to replenish shields/remove dots. Energy Drain was the skill I use most during my insanity playthrough.  Batarian Adept can sort of work as a weapons class as well. His shields are a little lower, but he has the Batarian passive for extra ammo, and able to easily detonate biotic combos."
MECoOp,395yz3,Detenator,2,Tue Jun 9 19:02:16 2015 UTC,"-Human Adept is nuts. Slap on an acolyte/smg combo and you're golden.  -Human Engineer. Fire explosions and tech bursts all the time.  -Asari Justicar can tank a bit more with reave damage reduction.  -Female Quarian Engineer has an excellent debuffer with cryo blast.  -Volus Adept is very powerful with a lot of utility and survivability.  If you've only been playing as the puggernaut though, you might want to ease your way into power kits via infiltrators. And become more adept with your situational awareness while utilizing soft cover.  Of course, take this with a grain of salt as I usually die on wave 1."

MECoOp,395yz3,blackmarketdolphins,2,Tue Jun 9 15:54:53 2015 UTC,"biotic orbs: excellent detonator and ridiculous debuffing power up to 45%.  shield boost: excellent survivability.  light melee cloak: more added survivability.  stasis: biotic primer and mook control  With Incendiary Ammo and a good primer weapon like the CSMG, you're making fire and biotic explosions on top of debuffing enemies.

MECoOp,395yz3,Kaicel,5,Tue Jun 9 16:22:57 2015 UTC,"Of course he can work on platinum like everything else if you're good enough. But OP asked specifically for easy beginner builds, the volus adept really isn't good for that."
MECoOp,395yz3,Chypsylon,0,Tue Jun 9 18:04:28 2015 UTC,Survivability means very little when enemies are regenerating their shields faster than you can take them down. Those little Fire Explosions are meaningless when you cant consistently reprime bosses or they throw up their shields. It's not a good Platinum class.
MECoOp,395yz3,blackmarketdolphins,2,Tue Jun 9 16:31:27 2015 UTC,"If enemy shields are regenerating faster than you can take them down, you probably shouldn't be playing platinum to begin with."
MECoOp,395yz3,Kaicel,-3,Tue Jun 9 16:41:43 2015 UTC,"Says the guy who says he dies on wave 1. I've soloed Platinum, and run and gunning will definitely give enemies time to regen shields. The Volus Adept is the worst character in the game. They will get their shields back faster than you can kill them because all of your damage is coming from weak ass weapon buffs and slightly buffed level 1 fire explosions. And those almost useless fire explosions that won't proc because, on top of their massive health values, they can shield themselves from the detonater. Stasis is all but useless since the BE definitely won't one shot anyone outside of maybe an Assault Trooper. You're just asking to get overrun with the VA on Platinum."
MECoOp,395yz3,blackmarketdolphins,-3,Tue Jun 9 16:55:55 2015 UTC,I would say l2p but you obviously are a master since you solo'd platinum.
MECoOp,395yz3,Kaicel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"Don't be like that. We were having a proper debate, and yes I was irritated by this jab   If enemy shields are regenerating faster than you can take them down, you probably shouldn't be playing platinum to begin with.   So I made it known that I'm no pushover. I know a little something about this game, and may have accidentally came off more smug than anything else.  I tried several builds as the VA, he's not a powerful character. He's only really good at staying alive. Stasis will not work on most enemies on Platinum, and those that it doed work on you can't really outright kill them due to the lack of BE and weapon buffs. FE are unreliable and weak. So in a setting that promotes offensive capabilities, he is far from ideal."
MECoOp,395yz3,blackmarketdolphins,7,Tue Jun 9 17:17:48 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: It's easier to respond here to one of you guys, but not focusing on you entirely.   1) Kind of in agreement with your points about the VA being subpar, but it's not nearly as weak as you're letting on here. Basically anything that can hold a level X UR and detonate things can do Platinum just fine, esp. with something like the CSMG with proper mods.   From experience playing with Kaicel I think he's undervaluing his own ability versus what the character is actually contributing...   2) Could we cool it with the personal shots here? Between putting out Plat solo as cred, then him snarking on it too, super not necessary. I think the regular posters here who /haven't/ soloed Plat are probably in the minority.   Also, if we're going to do the old fart ""I know a few things about the game"" thing, could we at least verify N7 accounts first? You guys have nearly the same amount of hours played between your two accounts and his XBL, and he has an asston more challenge points.   smellycatjazz  kaicel"
MECoOp,395yz3,Meowmageddon,2,Tue Jun 9 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"It's not fair to say slap a UR X. The OP is looking for a suggestion for a power based build to do Platinum, and I advised against the Volus because his powers are far from great when it comes to boss slaying. I'm not saying he's impossible to play, he's just not as powerful as Kaicel is making him out to be especially for a player easing into Platinum   2)    I know and that's why I apologized and tried to bring things back on track.   I think the regular posters here who /haven't/ soloed Plat are probably in the minority.    I agree, and the point of the OP was to receive suggestions on Platinum power builds. I put out my history as a way to give weight to my claims. Challenge points are irrelevant, since I prefer to experiment and optimize my builds over rehashing previously completed challenges."
MECoOp,395yz3,blackmarketdolphins,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:46:02 2015 UTC,"You keep saying voldept has poor weapon buffs, but his weapon passives are only 5% less than that of default humans at 22.5% as opposed to 27.5%. He has the same amount of weapon passives as the Asari Adept. Also, his powers further increases weapon and power buffs. 6b vulnerability on stasis increases all damage to the target by 50%, including detonations IIRC. I usually run bubble, but for this guy it's vulnerability. And as I mentioned before, biotic orbs can add up to 45% debuff to the target from all sources. In my opinion, he not only survives well, but is also able to deal out decent damage. I'm not here to convince you, since different strokes for different folks. I'm just saying, he's not terrible as most people make him out to be.  He's not bad at all."
MECoOp,395yz3,Kaicel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:03:31 2015 UTC,"He's missing a crucial Rank 4 headshot bonus which does affect his killing potential, especially when you factor in all the penalties from armor and shield gate. You keep hyping up Stasis, but it simply doesn't work on most enemies on Platinum. That's a fact, not a preference. Outside of the occasional mook and Phantoms, who are known not to stay  locked. We gotta keep in mind that OP is struggling to do Platinum, so he might not be able to execute certain builds on that level.  BO is alright, but that 45% debuff only applies if you're throwing all 3, which limits you're FE capabilities since enemies can't be immediately reprimed with the ammo power. You either go ball deep in one target for the full debuff, or hope that level 1 FE can buy you some time. Either way, it's not very viable for a new player without weapons to fall back on.    Edit: I watched the video, and it looks like that's in Gold, and Incendiary Ammo is doing most of the work, which it's definitely boosted by the CSMG. It looks like a solid build, but I would suggest it as an easy build for OP. You could do the same thing, but stronger with several other classes."

Next would be to give him something similar to devestator mode, but volus-sized to help him shoot weapons like the N7 Typhoon more steadily, which would turn off his propulsion pack if activated. Let's also add a flamer because it's well known volus love to be in close quarter combat. Then top it all off with the normal volus shield booster because he's a team player."

MECoOp,3967pp,RepublicanShredder,6,Tue Jun 9 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"That DR setup only works in cover. I think you need 133% DR to be immune to damage out of cover.   I'd choose some hideously OP like a Vorcha with Bloodlust, Overload, and Inferno Grenades. Nuking spawns, constantly regenerating health, and has good combo potential? It'd be like the Vorcha Sentinel, only slightly better. It'll make me laugh like a hyena if I could play that made-up kit."

MECoOp,3967pp,RepublicanShredder,2,Sat Jun 13 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"Because that would require 2 powers on using the same cooldown cycle, while with Inferno Grenades you only have to worry about Overload's cooldown. Plus Inferno Grenades prime everything instantly and without a hard range limit, just a soft range limit on how you can throw that fiery Tic Tac. And to top that all off, you can stack Inferno Grenades much like Flamer but with less mental firepower required.   And I love grenades. A lot. There's a few more nuances with grenades that I think make them superior to powers, minus the part where you have a limited quantity of them."
MECoOp,3967pp,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:42:34 2015 UTC,"Well unless you were to just partially-fire the Flamer you'd have to wait the full cooldown time. If you just cancel the full duration of it early you can get your cooldown timer faster. I personally don't mind grenades, but on higher difficulties it becomes tiresome having to run back to ammo boxes just to get one grenade, and it's even worse when someone else in the same game contests you for grenade refills."
MECoOp,3967pp,RepublicanShredder,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"True, but even the small bursting consumes some recycle time. I prefer fire and forget powers myself if given the option. Also Flamer has a kinda poor AoE unless targets are linearly clumped."

It is light enough that you can spam overload even with the heavy barrel slapped on it.    Chain overload is really outstanding if you see someone playing as a Paladin, GI, or AIU in the lobby- tech bursts all day!  I spec my armor to increase power damage.

MECoOp,3942cu,Comb-the-desert,2,Wed Jun 10 14:24:47 2015 UTC,"It's a good class, but one I believe to be overrated (I believe it won the poll as the favourite sentinel a while back). The only thing he has over the human sentinel is more hp and shields, which is not a good trade off for not having dodge. Weapon damage is one of the weakest buffs/strengths in this game. Compared with overload, throw also detonate techs like fire and cyro explosions; the former can do it more with chain overload but the latter can be casted faster, both skills are good cc, but throw means the human can make his own explosion.  Give me a human sentinel with a reegar over any TSen build any day.  PS not trying to shit on this class, just how I believe it's overrated."
MECoOp,3942cu,cymikelee,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:26:10 2015 UTC,"The only thing he has over the human sentinel is more hp and shields   Well that and higher encumbrance along with a recoil reducing passive. Though I do agree not having dodge is a pretty hideous payoff despite this game's attempt at a netcode. I wonder if Turians ever tried break dancing.   Weapon damage is one of the weakest buffs/strengths in this game.   I assume you mean the weapon damage in the passive tree. On first glance I interpreted it as 'Warp 5b debuff stinks' and was scared for a second.   The overrated part might be true. In the hands of someone who is a specialist, the Human Sentinel is better against armored enemies no doubt (I'm partial to a Throwslinger myself vs a Reegar). I guess why the Turian is rated so highly is how hard it is to screw up with him, even/especially if you know minimal game mechanics. The only 'idiot-proof' classes I can think off the top of my head are the Human Engineer, Turian Sentinel, and Geth Juggernaut. The former two have powers for everything while the Juggernaut is nigh indestructible."

MECoOp,3942cu,cymikelee,2,Wed Jun 10 04:38:27 2015 UTC,"While tech armor will give you a lot of effective shields especially if you have a cyclonic modulator, stasis is a really good offensive and defensive spell. Though the argument can be made that it only works on mooks (and non-armored ones at that) and some find the Asari shield draining and recharge interrupting dodge annoying. It's up to preference."
MECoOp,3942cu,Salsadips,2,Wed Jun 10 05:14:23 2015 UTC,"Best sentinel, and one of the few true sentinels. People forget that sentinels are supposed to be more utilitarian than DPS mongers. You have one of the best Debuffs, and one of the best CC moves in the game. Tech armor also gives extra legs to Cyclonics, and you have something for every defense type in the game if you use warp ammo."

MECoOp,3942cu,Salsadips,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"Love how you bring this up the same day that other topic comes up -- I've struggled to truly appreciate the Turian Sentinel, I guess because he can't self-detonate without special ammo.  That said, I might just try him again since I haven't touched him in a while and I could try the Argus for the first time (if the weight isn't prohibitive?) to complete your Silver challenge."
MECoOp,3942cu,cymikelee,2,Tue Jun 9 05:36:30 2015 UTC,No self-detonate? So Overload->Warp (Tech explosion) doesn't count?  I like this Sentinel. If only he could dodge...
MECoOp,3942cu,funkymustafa,2,Tue Jun 9 05:59:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, my bad!  That's embarrassing, shows how long it's been since I played him (read: when I just started out and was using a low level Avenger / Mattock I on him).  Edit: Finished OP's Silver challenge -- I put ULM on the Argus (I know, I know) and used a Barrage gear (again... I know) to make sure the Argus would shoot straight and for max cooldown because I wasn't sure if I could detonate my tech bursts in time with tech armor on.  Turns out I could and got quite a few kills that way -- maybe I never noticed them before?  Also for my boast of the day, I got 3 tech armor kills too, so that was fun... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTCFir4IFlM"
MECoOp,3942cu,Dancamvet,0,Tue Jun 9 06:09:31 2015 UTC,"Overload isnt a primer, its a tech detonator only. Tsent cannot self detonate unless using ammo primers."

MECoOp,3942cu,cymikelee,4,Tue Jun 9 08:33:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm, you're right. I dont recall ever detonating with it, so that makes me question the priming windows length, i was sure it was detonator only. Ive always used it as a chain detonator anyway."

I remember reading somewhere that the priming window is short though, so you might have to go with lighter weapons to make it happen."
MECoOp,3942cu,cymikelee,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:00:03 2015 UTC,"Tsent is my personal go to for any UUG because of his versatility and ability to handle any faction.  His ability to synergize with any kind of team is his best quality imo. You can prime/detonate for biotics, detonate tech, debuff a single target, stun multiple targets, put out high weapon damage, and soak it in return. He can be effectively played as a sniper, midrange marksman, shotgun/Hurricane CQC'er, or pistol caster.  I prefer a midrange marksman approach and usually use the Saber on him. With his durability, overload, and damage/stability passives he can chew through an entire spawn of mooks with nonstop stunlock and offense. That durability, versatility and ability to kill everything from range make him a great class for carrying shakier pugs as well."
MECoOp,3942cu,Unionhack,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"I too am a big fan of the Turian Sentinel due to his versatility and durability. He's a good choice for any team really due to being able to handle any foe or situation. He is one of my go to guys for higher difficulty runs (along with the Turian Soldier and the N7 Paladin [techsplosians everywhere]).  I tend to play him either as a mid-range gunner with powers using a solid assault rifle and priming/detonating or occasionally as a close range fighter with a shotgun/Talon. He can take some punishment which lends it self a little to closing with other team members backing up from range.  A very solid character with a good powers and destructive potential with guns, what's not to like?"

It just came so easily and naturally that I couldn't believe I didn't do it sooner. I stopped playing BF3 soldier and played regular human soldier with concussive shot/N7 Destroyer."

MECoOp,393qve,Gray_Squirrel,5,Tue Jun 9 09:15:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this sub has been such a great resource, I've been able to build most characters well enough to be serviceable the first time around.  There's a couple I haven't figured out -- the Turian Sentinel, as I posted in the other thread, and the Huntress (who I can play, just not get the ridiculous DPS output that others seem to get out of her).  For me it's often been the other way around -- the Destroyer making the Typhoon sing (topped a PUG gold in progress just now with it, and I never top games!), and melee classes (AIU melee build, N7 Shadow) helping me figure out how to aim a Wraith and use shotguns in general.  Trying the Acolyte also helped me learn how to use other charged weapons, and I've come to really appreciate the Graal and GPS -- on Krogans and Geth respectively, of course.  I didn't have to make much of an adjustment to play the Paladin (seriously, he's great no matter what), but I never got used to the omni-shield until I realized how useful it was against Cerberus.  It's so great for parrying Dragoons and bashing Phantoms aside.  And as another protip, I just discovered with the shield deployed, you can change weapons instantly -- who knew?"
MECoOp,393qve,TheBaconBard,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:47:04 2015 UTC,"This is my build for the Turian Sentinel, and I wreck with it.   For mooks: Overload to strip shields, Harrier.  For bosses: Strip shields, cast Warp, unload with Harrier. Warp ammo on the Harrier will deal extra damage to targets primed with Warp, and the HVB on the Harrier + Expose/Pierce on Warp will negate the armor reduction. Basically, bosses will melt away.   Also, I never detonate Tech Armor, as the extra DR is excellent. Lastly, the Cyclonic Modulator and DR from Tech Armor take care of the need to max out fitness."

Then I realized that Stasis was not the way to go. Acolyte and Geth SMG with Incendiary Rounds, and detonate with Biotic Orbs. Not a bad little DPS build, also still fits for supporting teammates as well.  Speaking of Asari Adept, I always tried to do the Stasis + Sniper build. I found it too heavy to actually work with my play style, then I realized I had a lighter sniper that hit almost as hard as a Widow: the Crusader. Heads exploded."

The Ex-Cerb Vanguard really clicked when I started focusing less on Smash and more on Charge -> Heavy Melee -> repeat. The additional area stagger from the heavy melee is SUPER helpful in staying alive until you can charge again.  There was a time when I was disappointed by both these characters, but now they're both in my top 20 classes to play when I want to have fun."
MECoOp,394ves,blarghhrrkblah,2,Tue Jun 9 07:24:52 2015 UTC,"It was a super popular, and what I mean by that was is it obscenely overused before they nerfed the Piranha. It still works, but when they lowered the clip size people stopped abusing it as much.   I could've sworn it was in the build list though, with a 4/6/6/6/4 build since recharge is pretty a waste on an Infiltrator."

Wouldn't being able to jump back into stealth faster be beneficial? Or does it not matter since you break stealth instantly so the cd is short anyway?
MECoOp,394ves,HeaVenwiLLbUrN,2,Tue Jun 9 08:52:59 2015 UTC,"The cd doesn't matter if you break cloak right away. It's always like a 3 or 4 second cd unless you stay in cloak for the full duration, then you get the normal cd time. For the GI, proxy mine doesn't break cloak (neither do any grenades as far as I know), so when you fight with the GI the process is cloak, proxy mine, shoot and you will have a low cd no matter the gun you use. For the build you have listed I would take out the recharge speed for cloak and put that into fitness and for the last box in proxy mine I would go damage (since recharge speed doesn't matter if you always fire from cloak) or put another point in fitness. I usually run a 4/5/6/6/5 build for the GI because I like the faster shield recharge over some extra damage in proxy."

Slap Stabilization Module, AP/Incendiary ammo and Shotgun Rail, and topscore pugs all day. After you master close combat cloaking you basically stop dying. Going 4/6/6/4/6 for Fitness Shield Recharge helps a lot."

MECoOp,391pm4,Warfy,8,Mon Jun 8 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"Cloak is an extra bonus in the equation, Amps apply to base power damage.

Personally I aim for 1000+ shields for gold on most kits either through Cylonics or Fitness, but that's just me.  This spreadsheet shows you how much damage each enemy can do per difficulty, if you feel yourself dying to a certain enemy too much you can adapt your spec."

MECoOp,390ek3,cymikelee,3,Tue Jun 9 06:04:37 2015 UTC,"I don't care about the specific values, but fitness spec all varies.

MECoOp,390ek3,PangurBaan,2,Mon Jun 8 12:01:15 2015 UTC,"I've gone from carrying less in Fitness to more as I've upped difficulty. Generally now I go with a minimum of 5 in Fitness. I'm sure if I was better at the game I could go with less but I find survivability more useful than melee for most characters (with a few notable exceptions). Being alive through the wave is preferable to hitting harder in melee and being dead, at least to me. As someone has mentioned you can also use mods like the Cyclonic Shield mod and some of the permanent equipment boosts (Juggernaut Shield, Responder, Survivor [I think]) to improve your survivability if you need extra.  As for a specific number, umm, not so sure. I do like the Turian characters with their shield in the 1000-1200 range  Some characters have other ways of improving survivability too, like Reave characters with damage reduction, the Omni-Shield on the Paladin (something I've found useful for the rushing mooks like Dragoons)."
MECoOp,390ek3,Dancamvet,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:35:18 2015 UTC,"I honestly never think about the actual amount, but I go for as much Fitness as possible after I've made a reasonable effort to max out my damage output.  On classes where I can sacrifice a skill entirely (Sabotage, Concussive Arrows, etc.) I go 6 points; I go 5 if I'm putting 3 points in a token skill like Pull or Lash; and 4 is my standby.  I occasionally do 3 on something like the N7 Paladin, because techsplosions!  That said, /u/Dancamvet makes a great point about damage reduction -- unless I'm sacrificing substantial damage (like on Shadow Strike) I almost always take it.  Reave and Barrier / Tech Armor obviously, the ""armor"" evolution of Energy Drain is great, and on Krogans I always knock Rage down to 2 melee kills so that it activates as often as possible.  Edit: Partly because I'm trying to grind out my last UR, I should point out my goal is to rely as little on cyclonics as possible (though I use them from time to time, especially on squishy or CQC characters)."
MECoOp,390ek3,cymikelee,2,Tue Jun 9 05:56:37 2015 UTC,"I tend to abuse my shield gate and use power cells along with rha as my main defense, so I don't go past 3 levels of fitness unless one of the trees is just really not worth anything."
MECoOp,390ek3,EatsDirtWithPassion,2,Mon Jun 8 15:35:35 2015 UTC,"Depends on playstyle and character.  Some characters, no matter how many points you put in fitness and equipment, are going to be at all 'tanky' on even silver.  Other charaters (jugg) are so tanky that building any points into extra sheilds may be sacrificing DPS that you neeed to contribute on Gold+.  I prefer to put points into each character that lets me play them as intended offensively, then worry about augmenting health/sheilds."
MECoOp,390ek3,transam617,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"Classes with 500 or less shield can survive with four ranks of fitness as long as they are supplemented with high ranks of equipment. For 250 base shield classes you are pretty much forced to take Shield Power Cells or Adrenaline over a Cyclonic. Of course it also depends where you spend those ten extra points if it is really worth it or not.  For example a Volus vanguard with all skills could go 6/6/6/4/4 because it gets a lot of regen/CDR from his skills. Or on the Fury you would run 6/6/6/4/4 because she regens shields constantly when in groups of enemies making her deceptively tanky and relies on her detonations, which scale with power rank. The Talon Merc on the other hand would want all six ranks of fitness because he has no escape if he gets caught and Concussive Arrows are fairly lackluster."
MECoOp,390ek3,Detenator,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"For me it depends a little on the characters playstyle. Caster classes and those who use slow single shot weapons generally get level three or nothing in shields, while those who have to sustain fire for longer, move slow, or get very close with the enemy get between four and six ranks."
MECoOp,390ek3,InfiniteQuasar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"It depends on the class. It's not so much having a specific arbitrary amount of health and shields but rather or not your build is the most optimal. For example, my slayer and asari vanguard only have 3 ranks because it's more worth it to go 6/6/6/5/3 on them, and if I don't even put a cyclonic on them but instead power amps since with good play and a good connection (especially when you are hosting) biotic charge should keep you alive. On my cerbguard, he has 825 because he's only got 3 ranks in lash because it's a very weak skill for that class and playstyle. On Kroguard he has full fitness despite starting with 1k shields because he has no dodge and has a longer CD on charge. I think the TGI is my only class that I play which has zero fitness and no cyclonics because stimpacks should keep you alive."

That said, when I was in your position and looking for a new goal to keep things interesting what I did was start a campaign of playing every class starting from a fresh promote until I finished all the related challenges, while simultaneously limiting myself to only weapons for which I hadn't finished the related challenge with yet.  I really liked getting to figure out each different kit, both the popular ones I just hadn't gotten around to yet or had turned me off at first (e.g. Geth Infiltrator) and the more idiosyncratic ones that take the right approach and some practice to not die horribly (oh Drell Vanguard...). And it's also nice to be ""forced"" to play with more guns than just the Harrier and the Reegar and the Black Widow every game. Right now I've finished the guns so I'm loosening up that restriction a little (though still making an effort to rotate) and I'm starting my slog through the Volus."

I only have a couple challenges left, mostly due to me being racist and saving Krogans (down to Kroguard and Warlord), Batarians, and Vorcha for last.  I'd add the Talon and Hurricane to your weapons list, those seem ideal on most kits, though the Black Widow is enough of an adventure for someone like me that it's been fun playing QMI with it.  I also tried the Geth Scanner finally, and BW + drill rounds with it is like a multi-shot Javelin.  I guess the other possibility is to stop caring about guns and find fun melee builds.  I've really enjoyed melee AIU since I'm still able to kill really quickly, which is part of the point here."

It was a high burst damage high risk high reward play. All I used was the automatic pistol with melee/power damage modules and the geth scanner and that's all I needed to totally dominate golds. My expenses were nearly 0 except for occasional medi-gels and rockets. That way almost everything went towards arsenal packs with the occasional jumbo packs for gels. It worked even better once I started platniums and I started drowning in consumables and upgrades. People generally would get salty when I joined lobbies with no consumables and insisted I was fine. That normally died down once I run a match or two with them.   Sadly, playing a single class for so long leads you to need a change. Now in order to stay platnium viable I need to start using consumables with other classes. So now my ""profits"" are much less."

Acolyte strips shields and then run up and prime with AF, detonate with Throw. Use DC to do heavy DoT to boss enemies as well as an extra primer. Hurricane for extra heavier DPS on boss enemies after the Acolyte strips their shields. That is the basic gist of it.  Although me, personally, I prefer my Asari Valkyrie over the Fury."
MECoOp,38v6zd,BlodhgarmDethahal,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:24:48 2015 UTC,"The problem is, in theory I know how to use the Fury, but in practice it always falls apart.  As in, I teleport in to prime with Annihilation field, but instantly get staggered by the enemy I'm wanting to detonate. Maybe I should just make a game on Reapers/Glacier or something, but the constant staggering makes it a whole lot less fun for me."
MECoOp,38v6zd,dickcake,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:03:27 2015 UTC,"You really need to stagger on the way in.  Lead with an acolyte shot, then run in while they're staggered, prime, detonate.    Also, this class is extremely lag sensitive.  Best to play as host."
MECoOp,38v6zd,regack,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:06:07 2015 UTC,"Geth Scanner helps a lot for situational awareness when you're getting used to how she works.  I wouldn't teleport in towards the enemy so much.  Like /u/dickcake says, lead with an acolyte shot to stagger, then fly through with AF/Throw.  Acolyte is also really good at applying ammo effects, so you could use up some of those Cryo IV and freeze the mooks in place while you run up.  I assume you're using Radius/Speed/Drain in AF?  If you use Adrenaline for faster steps, you'll figure out the distance AF triggers at and you can just step back and forth near bosses for almost constant BEs.  Atlases are particularly susceptible.   That said, to start you might want cyclonics for survivability.    She's endless fun for me, so I hope you figure it out and get to join in!"
MECoOp,38v6zd,dumael,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"Don't teleport with the fury, it costs shields which breaks your recharge time on shields. Instead, sprint to engage. This means not being the light brigade against the russians, i.e. charges across open ground.  Take drain on annihilation field instead of damage. Annihilation field's damage is insignificant compared to its utility of setting up biotic explosions.  Geth scanner is invaluable for situational awareness."
MECoOp,38v6zd,bigblackcouch,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:03:49 2015 UTC,"Everyone's got good tips but I'll reiterate what /u/dickcake (lol) says. Fury is probably more reliant on being host than Vanguards are. If you're host with Fury you can do so many things, like tiptoeing in and out of the annihilation field range to re-prime over and over again. It primes pretty much the instant you 'touch' something with it, meaning if you're quick you can actually throw out a blob before your field makes contact to an enemy, and then touch it with the field during the blob's travel time, which will prime an explosion.  Other things are that the teleporting through walls can do weird shit when you're not the host, I've had the camera move left/right through a wall, only to return to my character, who is still on the original side of the wall."
MECoOp,38v6zd,Fyrjefe,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:46:18 2015 UTC,"20 minutes? Are you kidding me? Amazing. I watched every second of it. How arousing. :P Seriously, this is my favourite class ever. I like the  tempo the acolyte gives with the charge-fire-throw. I didn't like the gun very much before, but I may take a second look at it. I'll need a couple more ranks on it, first. One more thing, the player didn't even edit the FOV. That made a world of difference for me, though I play just golds for now while I build my manifest."
MECoOp,38v6zd,PlacidPlatypus,5,Tue Jun 9 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"I like her even off host. Annihilation Field is best in areas with a lot of corners to duck around; in more open areas use Dark Channel, or if your teammates are doing much priming just pop them with Throw."
MECoOp,38v6zd,BlackwoodJohnson,3,Sun Jun 7 03:24:13 2015 UTC,"You haven't described how you play her and spec, so it's hard to give specific advice. You really shouldn't be staggered even off-host as long as you spec into field radius, take advantage of the acolyte stun, spam throw (that's another mook stunner), and are not running into too many mooks.   But now you've got me typing, here's some more advice that might help. Use acolyte and field+throw explosion for mooks, warp ammo and hurricane and dark channel+throw explosion for bosses or anything that can sync kill, especially since you are off-host. Adrenaline (run speed) module can be a lot of fun and improve your survivability as an alternative to cyclonics, especially if you have specced into damage taken instead of movement speed for rank 5 annihilation field (the 15% damage bonus applies to your explosions), and don't use heavy melee unless it is to jump through walls as an escape."
MECoOp,38v6zd,El_Diablito,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good trick with heavy melee, thanks.  I never thought about it but yeah if your melee moves you forward a few meters via teleportation then it can certainly move you through a wall."
MECoOp,38v6zd,ProtoKun7,2,Mon Jun 8 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"I wasn't keen on trying her initially until I discovered that I'm great with her.

MECoOp,38ru5a,blahgarfogar,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"I find that this build excels against cerberus and geth, but you could make it work against  collectors and reapers if you're play smart.  I've outscored a AIU w/ reeger and GIs with claymores on gold so this build does work.  It rewards aggressive play, especially hit and run tactics. Go into a spawn, charge up your venom on the go, explode everything, any survivors get a multi frag up their urethra.  Bosses may take longer, so you're probably going to want to have a secondary like a Hurricane.  Phantoms and other fast moving enemies become trivial, though I advise to only engage two phantoms at a time. The venom staggers and applies ammo effectively for fire combos. The HAWK missile launcher is not really suited for damage but rather for forcing dodges and staggering."
MECoOp,38ru5a,crashsuit,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"I do this too, with the Omni Blade on the Venom and a strength mod in the weapon consumable slot. For groups of mooks, you can just run in firing Venom shots, then stomp once or twice and/or fire a multi-frag. Since the Destroyer doesn't worry about cooldowns, pack whatever secondary you want. I usually take a sniper rifle or assault rifle for when I'm stuck in circle hacks or there's too much open space to run around stomping. I think I usually take Disruptor ammo to help stun enemies as I run into groups of them. If you really want to bug people, take the Striker as your secondary. I call that build ""The Noisemaker"". SNIPERS HATE HIM!"
MECoOp,38ru5a,blackmarketdolphins,4,Mon Jun 8 02:40:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not often adventurous, but one ""unconventional"" (I guess) build I really enjoy is the human soldier without adrenaline, relying on cryo ammo to make concussive shot's shatter evolution shine.

The build may not be too crazy, just your typical Asari Huntress mega pierce/expose build. But for weapon I have my lv1 Valiant Sniper Rifle (N7 promo weekend one for those who can't remember).  What happens is: after the stacking effects of my Dark Channel and Warp, and the combined bonuses of Warp Ammo and Tac Cloak, it just so happens the fatal damage is from a quick tripple shot from the sniper rifle. I feel like a skinny sexy Geth Prime. The weapon itself is rather weak, but after all those armor reductions its an easy way to farm sniper medals."

MECoOp,38ru5a,atlas_incarnate,2,Sat Jun 6 18:17:50 2015 UTC,"My personal favorite build to play with is the N7 Slayer Vanguard, with fully upgraded biotic charge (with the shield recharge) and fully upgraded biotic slash (with recharge speed). I also leave the phasic-disruptor completely empty at 0 so every other power can be fully upgraded (I never like sacrificing my defenses and that uses up half the barrier for each shot). I also only carry the Executioner Pistol for enemies with portable defenses (like the Cerberus Guardian and those goddamn turrets). My only issue is when I meet an enemy with a biotic barrier - it neutralizes the charge and makes the slash ineffective, but that's what teammates and the pistol is for. I find him to be a very effective close-quarters combatant, especially with the heavy melee sword attack that insta-kills un-shielded enemies. The regular sword melee also has a staggering-effect which is useful on those dragoons."

I can't say its super viable in higher tiers but it gets me through silvers and some golds just fine.    My Batarian brawler I have both his spells have a chance to not go into cooldown, his blade armor has full penalty and his loadouts are heavy as shit (usually Reager + Reverent/Widow/Harrier) He has a CHANCE to go on a power killing spree and a chance to go into super long cooldowns.

If an enemy is far away I use the Marksman ability and shoot them in the head. If they're close I don't use Marksman, and then shoot them in the head. The Raider is essentially the double-barreled shotgun you'd find in other games. I think I prefer it over the Claymore."
MECoOp,38ogpk,Das_Sikorsky,4,Fri Jun 5 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"With lagg, you can get off 3, sometimes even 4 shots with the raider. So yeah, the Raider is definitely up there in terms of my favorite shot guns, even with just the 2 shots."
MECoOp,38ogpk,funkymustafa,2,Fri Jun 5 16:53:02 2015 UTC,"Raider has great synergy in particular with any kit that has a stagger power, can handle a moderate weight loadout, has a way to buff damage, and does well with spikes of high offense. An aggressive playstyle helps as well. It's really not made for a point A to point B, cover-to-cover movement style. Use cover for brief pauses to hide a reload or cooldown, otherwise always be pressing forward and in their face. Try it on the Drelldept with warp ammo and adrenaline mod, and QFE with disruptor ammo.   A stagger power makes your life much easier for two reasons, it buys you time to close the distance to optimal kill range (this is why it synergizes beautifully with an adrenaline mod so your drell runs like Usain Bolt in space), and it interrupts them from firing on you up close. Drelldept's speed, agility, ability to prime for warp ammo, crowd control with clusters, high damage passives and high weight capacity make him a great Raider platform. Similarly, QFE is pretty tanky for an engineer and can debuff, detonate, and stagger -  and a disruptor ammo Raider perfectly fills her need for heavy anti shield damage.  Also, while it's never going to do much at distance, with a smart choke you might be surprised how much you can get away with. Sometimes I think people fall into the trap of thinking if they can't get within 10 feet they might as well not bother shooting it."
MECoOp,38ogpk,jxcream,2,Fri Jun 5 18:40:23 2015 UTC,Unless you are right in their face I'd say the Wraith is superior to the Raider in more or less every way. I often run shotgun only builds and i could just never get used to the lacking range of the Raider.
MECoOp,38ogpk,Chypsylon,3,Fri Jun 5 20:52:07 2015 UTC,"Smart choke makes it efficient even on medium Range. It's dps is way higher than the wraiths, especially if you use reload canceling."

Sure the Raider has acceptable range with a choke but the Wraith still has better range without it, i run that thing with the HV barrel and you can one hit stuff from pretty far even without the choke.

Even then, only at mid- to short range. It may be posited that my aim isn't very good then, and this may well be true. But even so."
MECoOp,38ogpk,ElMacedonian,4,Sun Jun 7 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"Incisor is actually a fantastic setup on a geth engineer with incendiary rounds.   Phaeston with marksman fits the turian like a glove.  argus on the batarian sentinel is pretty solid  Viper is a very fun sniper rifle but i dont reccomend it for plat because taking multiple headshots for a sniper to kill is not practical .  Hornet SMG with stability is a solid primer and dps tool that has alot more finesse then the other SMGS   ARC pistol is the best kept secret of the top players in the game, if you learn how to take advantage of it. get a rhythm going with its charge, you can bust out more damage with this sucker than a paladin, and you have a much larger ammo clip.   for general weapon play it can be supprising how much marksman can make an old sub par weapon seem like a shiny new toy. Ever see someone use a scimitar shotgun on a turian soldier, you can pop pop pop the heads off left and right. trust me its fun. however for this i recommend not to build your marksman as the accuracy in rank four over damage, it literally goes into a slug with max accuracy and i like a little spread myself.   it can also be fun to try and make a hyper accurate Reavenaunt, put a scope and use with marksman.  I hope at least some of these can get a little bit of enjoyment for you!"
MECoOp,38ogpk,ElMacedonian,2,Fri Jun 5 16:48:51 2015 UTC,I've seen so many people rave about the Arc Pistol but I never got the hang of it. I'll give it another try though. I'll check out the Incisor as well though I have my doubts!
MECoOp,38ogpk,crashsuit,2,Fri Jun 5 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"head shots and rhythm are needed for the arc pistol. charge it up almost all the way, pop them in the head, then charge it up again. you want to keep shooting right where you get to either the third or second bullet. its kinda herd to explain. but a full charge shot uses three bullets. you can shoot all three bullets just before it is fully charged, and you can shoot the second shot rather early in the charge cycle as well. this gun is also very headshot dependent because of its 3x headshot multiplier.   what i forgot to mention about the incisor is that a stability mod in the gear slot helps tremendously with getting all three shots of the burst in the head and chest of the bad guy. and if you hit a full burst or two with this weapon the enemy is almost always primed for a tech/fire explosion."
MECoOp,38ogpk,jaymanly,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:36:52 2015 UTC,"What is the difference in damage between a full charged shot, and one nearly charged? It must not be much.  I had assumed you needed the max charge to reach appreciable levels of damage, but if not I will have to try it like that."
MECoOp,38ogpk,idiotsonfire,3,Fri Jun 5 17:45:39 2015 UTC,"The fully charged Arc Pistol shot fires three shots at once, each of which do triple the uncharged damage, and only one of the three shots is affected by shield gate. So, you always want to charge the Arc Pistol, because you're getting an effective 9x damage modifier. In addition to the great damage and bypassing shield gate, you can charge and fire it while running, it's got good spare ammo levels, it's super light, the charged shots are good at applying ammo effects, it's got a great selection of weapon mods available, and it gives you something to do with pistol amps."

The Locust has a nice little 3x headshot multiplier, a little higher than the 2.5x of other SMGs. It's also got manageable recoil even before mods (looking at you, Hurricane).  I don't feel like I see the Disciple that often either.

Instead, just get a gun that does 500 damage but can fire 3 or 4 shots in the same time the Javelin fires 1.  Now you can get 3 or 4 kills... instead of just 1.

Melts enemies in Silver, still trying to get it to with well on Gold.  The Indra has similarly nice properties, but I can't find enough excuses to use it over, say a Black Widow.  Lots of SMGs seem underused to me -- the BPP is my current favorite, it seems to dish out damage just a little bit less than the Hurricane but that armor bonus is pretty sweet.  The Tempest is also a great option for players just starting out."

Last night I played the N7 Paladin and someone else had the Geth Trooper and the other two guys were engineers with chain overloads.  Needless to say there was plenty of Fire and Cryo explosions."
MECoOp,38ceed,El_Diablito,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:36:28 2015 UTC,I was playing last night as a Geth Trooper and had a Paladin on my team! I have a flamer-centered build so that sounds like it could've been me.
MECoOp,38ceed,jbo6527,2,Thu Jun 4 18:55:56 2015 UTC,That was the night before for me and I'm on Xbox but I'm sure you had a lot of good synergy.  I have to keep more of those complementary builds in mind when I see certain guys in the lobby.  For your Geth Trooper I would love to come in as one of the engineers and pretty much back you up and chain overload everything you're flaming.
MECoOp,38ceed,El_Diablito,2,Thu Jun 4 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"Haha I wish you could do that, but I used to play on Xbox, now on PC. On Xbox the Paladin was my favorite, but now I'm overly attached to my Talon Merc. Too bad he's too mushy for gold so I have to use the Geth trooper"
MECoOp,38ceed,jbo6527,2,Thu Jun 4 22:31:23 2015 UTC,"You know I want to like the Merc and he's cool and unique with his arrows but damnit those things don't have enough stopping power.  I feel like he's shooting spit balls, maybe I have him spec'ed all wrong.  The Geth Trooper goes great with the Juggernaut too... pretty much stand behind him when he's in heavy melee and drawing aggro and just burn everything.  I do the same with the Justicar, just drop my damage boost bubble on the Juggernaut and everybody goes to town."
MECoOp,38ceed,El_Diablito,2,Fri Jun 5 15:28:27 2015 UTC,"I put all his powers into melee, and then equip him with juggernaut shield to up his shield and buff his melee. Then you can also equip a shotgun/assault rifle with an omni blade. The melee bonus of the omni blade applies to the omni bow. When spec'd like that he's pretty decent, he's my go-to for playing silver. I've seen people use him on gold but only by spamming his mines"
MECoOp,38ceed,jbo6527,2,Tue Jun 9 18:52:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for breaking it down but honestly if all that is needed to make him workable for just silver then I'll have to pass.
MECoOp,38ceed,El_Diablito,2,Tue Jun 9 19:16:13 2015 UTC,Haha yeah that's understandable. But with that build the omni bow is good enough that you don't really need another weapon

Council races, Asari, and Krogan teams usually work well because they can combo and cover what the others lack.

If I get to enter the lobby, I will pick a kit that meshes well with the rest. Recently, just by chance, I played the Asari Huntress and got dropped into an active session with another Huntress and two Vanguards. All I did was prime targets, and the Vanguards then zipped in to detonate. All I could hear was biotic explosions going off, and mooks flying around everywhere. Beautiful!"
MECoOp,38ci3x,Scarecrow1779,5,Wed Jun 3 09:33:57 2015 UTC,"Recon Mine doesn't break TC, so putting 4 ranks in TC should suffice. Additionally you could skip one rank in the passives in favor of maxing out Homing Grenades.  This is the build I ran on gold and the grenades are amazing, decreasing time spent on armored targets immensely (i.e. 2 nades + 1 mine kill a brute and bring a scion to ~500 health)."
MECoOp,38ci3x,DerBeefman,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:45:38 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. just went and tested, and you're right. also, the recharge only takes off like .25 seconds, so that isn't worth removing the shield recharge rank. I like it."

MECoOp,38ci3x,Jovian09,2,Wed Jun 3 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"Love it. The Drellfiltrator's so versatile. I used to run a similar setup, balancing weapon damage with TC and recon mines at the expense of homing grenades.   I've also run a shotgun/homing grenade-focused setup, using just a few points in recon mine for debuffs and the split incendiary grenade to do the bulk of the damage."
MECoOp,38ci3x,AJockeysBallsack,2,Fri Jun 5 19:41:23 2015 UTC,"I call my build ""Surprise, Motherfucker!""   It consists of me placing mines in spawns, shooting people in the face, then detonating the mine while the residual cloak bonus applies, and running away.  You can sub in a Claymore, which will allow you to use the heavy AP barrel (because default weapons don't actually receive the extra weight penalty) and go with a different ammo, or you can stick AP/Drill ammo and blast through walls. I prefer the Raider because I can take out/damage more than one target.   Platinum tested and approved.    Change up a slot or two for a classic Black Widow+Scorpion build. You're much more reliant on saving your Cloak for immediate use to minimize cooldown,but you can and will wreck faces."
MECoOp,38ci3x,felassans,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:45:03 2015 UTC,I've been really enjoying the Invasive Scan recon mines on bronze and silver - would you say it's definitely worth taking Armor Damage instead when I finally move to gold?

MECoOp,389zfc,fluxweeds,4,Tue Jun 2 22:57:12 2015 UTC,"Although to be fair, it's less about your N7 score and more about the Challenge score. There's plenty of people out there on 120 N7 because that's what it takes to get all the characters to LVL 20 without a single promotion, but have ridiculously high challenge scores. Challenge scores are more of an indication of how long they've played/good they are at the game. Unless you want to promote for single player, aside from one challenge and the n7 ranking going up, there's nothing else going for it."

MECoOp,388nqd,FoxtrotTangoSera,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"I'm tempted to pick up the trilogy for PC and play some multi on the PC instead of Xbox. How's the transition into getting your manifest up to speed? My Xbox one isn't even close to max, hell I don't even have most Rares, but I have some valuable weapons such as a Harrier, a Hurricane, a leveled up Claymore, etc."
MECoOp,384e3q,macdoge1,13,Mon Jun 1 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"When it comes to leveling weapons, the biggest pay off in my opinion is weight. A level X Talon will give you +200% cooldown while a level I will give ~150% if I remember correctly. Spare ammo is a nice plus, especially for guzzlers like the Harrier and Hurricane. Of course you get slight DPS upgrades too but in my opinion its not that noticeable compared to weight and spare ammo."
MECoOp,384e3q,BlodhgarmDethahal,9,Mon Jun 1 20:13:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely right.  There are a lot of guns that are simply unusable on power based classes at level I because of their weight, such as the Executioner.  At level ten, you get 190% cooldown and the reload animation isn't even what I would consider long anymore.    The best part is, you can ditch using a 6 point level up just to reduce weight and put the points in increased damage or something else."
MECoOp,384e3q,Jon9000,6,Mon Jun 1 23:30:58 2015 UTC,So on weapons classes that have damage buffs (especially infiltrators) the damage difference can really stack.  Here's a GI with a Javelin 1: http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#55!5014555!!24B55373!EBGA3S (5807 with a shot with all buffs/debuffs active)  Here's a GI with a Javelin X: http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#55!5004555!!24B55373!EBGA3S (7262 with a shot with all buffs/debuffs active)  That's pretty significant. But yeah I think the difference can seem kind of irrelevant in some builds.
MECoOp,384e3q,othellothewise,3,Mon Jun 1 20:49:40 2015 UTC,"That's about a ~25% difference in damage going from I-X, which is generally consistent on all guns."
MECoOp,384e3q,RepublicanShredder,4,Wed Jun 3 05:44:53 2015 UTC,"For weapons, you can compare their stats at I and X here -  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgoNSTctMEekdHIwa081S0FBVS1ZZzdWeXRnbGRDYnc&output=html  To more directly answer your question - yes, leveling them makes a fairly decent difference, particularly when it comes to spare ammo (huge difference for non-thermal clip weapons in particular) and weight. Even so, there's plenty of guns that work well even at lower levels or that still outshine higher level ones. It highly depends on the gun in question as well as personal preference.  As for character levels, I'm a bit confused on what you're asking about since the skill point system is fairly basic. You level, you gain skill points, and you spend them to improve your active and passive abilities.   For skill points per level it goes like this -   Level 1 : 2 points  Level 2 - 6 : 3 points each  Level 7 - 12 : 4 points each  Level 13 - 16 : 5 points each  Level 17 - 20 : 6 points each  If I didn't quite answer your questions please feel free to elaborate and I'll try to get back to you."
MECoOp,384e3q,Kheben,2,Mon Jun 1 20:10:40 2015 UTC,"I just noticed it on the N7 HQ.  I have 1 bar/level for some characters, 2 for others."
MECoOp,384e3q,Kheben,4,Mon Jun 1 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"On the inventory screen?  What you're seeing is how many ""cards"" you've unlocked, which gives you the extra Appearance options (Secondary Color, Pattern, Lights, Skin Tone and such). I had a feeling that's what you may have meant but wasn't sure!  Quick edit/addition - It's also worth noting that even when you finish getting the cards for the common classes (the human ones), you'll still have a chance of getting them in any packs you open (except the Arsenal pack, I believe). They don't unlock anything further; my guess is Bioware just put them in so that you could still get a little boost of experience every so often. The other class cards stop showing up once you've finished unlocking all of their options."
MECoOp,384e3q,joshinburbank,3,Mon Jun 1 20:32:35 2015 UTC,Check out the Useful Links on the sidebar.  This one specifically: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgoNSTctMEekdHIwa081S0FBVS1ZZzdWeXRnbGRDYnc#gid=8
MECoOp,384e3q,joshinburbank,2,Mon Jun 1 20:12:21 2015 UTC,"BTW, always keep in mind that enemies have more armor the higher the you go in the game's levels.  This means that on Bronze every weapon actually does the damage it says it does, but on Silver every single bullet you fire does less damage because it has to penetrate some armor, and on Gold and Platinum each bullet has to overcome so much armor that some guns are rendered useless without some kind of enhancement.  So gun level makes a HUGE difference for Gold in terms of damage output, so pay special attention to the guns that do the most damage PER BULLET!  Rate of fire is meaningless when every one of those shots does not overcome at least 50 points of armor."
MECoOp,384e3q,smedes,9,Mon Jun 1 20:20:08 2015 UTC,"This is not an accurate description of the way armor works. All armor has a certain amount of damage reduction that applies to every shot. The game refers to this as ""the defenses on armored targets"" in things like piercing mods.  On Bronze, every bullet does 15 less damage.  On Silver, 30 less.  On Gold and Platinum, 50 less.  However, the minimum damage a gun will do is 5. This means that even a Geth Plasma SMG, which has a base damage of 20 at rank X, will do 5 damage vs armor.  There are enhancements, as you mentioned, which can counter ""the defenses on armored targets"" in various ways.  First, there are some weapons that get multipliers vs armor. The Collector SMG, for example, does 150% damage to armor. This seems to be applied after the armor damage reduction (Kalence thinks it is anyway). That means that although a base level X CSMG does 52 damage to health, it does 8 damage to armor: max(5, 52-50)*1.5 = 8 (rounded), instead of max(5, 52*1.5-50) = 28.  Next, there are mods like the piercing mods and high velocity barrels, as well as AP and drill ammo, that say ""ignore x% of an armored target's defenses."" This means that of the 15, 30, or 50 point damage reduction, x% of it does not actually take place. So a base cerberus harrier X does 130 damage to health and 80 damage to armor on gold. With AP ammo I, ""ignore 50% of an armored target's defenses,"" it does 105 damage to armor on gold, because 50%, or 25 points, of that armor damage reduction was ignored. This sort of effect stacks with itself in an additive manner, but there is no benefit to exceeding 100%.  Next, there are some powers and ammos that apply an effect called ""armor weakening,"" like warp or cryo ammo. This is similar to the previous effect, but instead of applying the effect to the particular bullet, it applies the effect to the enemy. So a base cerberus harrier X with cryo ammo III will do 130 damage to health and 105 damage to armor on gold. Except in this case, now all shots fired at the enemy in question will only suffer a 25 point reduction, so your teammates benefit as well. I think this effect wears off after a certain amount of time, but I am not sure. If this effect is applied by multiple sources, Kalence indicates that it does not stack - only the larger effect is applied. Kalence also indicates that it stacks multiplicatively with the previous effect, so a Harrier X with cryo III and a High Velocity Barrel I, on gold, will do 130 damage to health and 117 damage to armor. In other words, the 50 point reduction is cut by 50% from the cryo ammo to 25, then that is cut by 50% by the HVB to 12.5, which is rounded up to 13. I'm actually not sure what order the effects are applied in, but mathematically it does not matter.  Finally, there are some weapons that ignore the armor damage reduction altogether, namely any weapon that fires a projectile of any kind. This means any gun whose shots have a travel time before they reach their target, e.g. the geth plasma shotgun, the kishock harpoon gun, or the scorpion. Putting any kind of piercing mod or ammo on a projectile weapon is useless."

MECoOp,384e3q,PlacidPlatypus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:51:27 2015 UTC,"That's only for enemies with armor, right? As far as I know against shields, barriers, and health it doesn't make a difference."
MECoOp,384e3q,Kheben,2,Mon Jun 1 22:02:06 2015 UTC,"Correct. Enemies do have increased health, shields, and barriers in higher difficulties, but in terms of actual damage reduction that's only for armor."
MECoOp,384e3q,cymikelee,2,Mon Jun 1 22:04:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so my stupid follow-up question is, why are fast-firing weapons better against shields?  If there's no modifier, is it purely a shieldgate issue or does it have something to do with regen too?"
MECoOp,384e3q,PlacidPlatypus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"Shield gating is definitely part of it, although I don't think regen should be an issue unless you're taking a very long time between hits. The other thing though is just the way some of the weapons are balanced. Looking at the Viper and the Raptor on the spreadsheet, for example, if you look at the multi-clip DPS at level one, the Raptor does about 50% more damage to unarmored targets.  On the other hand, against Gold armor with no penetration, the Raptor loses more than half its damage while the Viper only loses less than a sixth, making the Viper a better choice."
MECoOp,384e3q,TheMadMullah,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:40:27 2015 UTC,"Certain weapons do have damage multipliers against shields and barriers though. For example for the Talon (1.5x against shields), the Acolyte (something ridiculous like 8x damage against shields/barriers)."

MECoOp,383602,Jaysers,2,Mon Jun 1 18:47:10 2015 UTC,"What packs are you buying? Are you referring to gear, or consumables?"
MECoOp,383602,crashsuit,2,Tue Jun 2 00:13:14 2015 UTC,"Jumbo Equipment Packs. And I mean the ammo, armor and weapon equipment. I have plenty of consumables and the right gears. Just every time I open a JEP I get things like Targeting VI 3 or explosive rounds 3."
MECoOp,383602,Jaysers,2,Tue Jun 2 07:03:28 2015 UTC,"Do you have your uncommon weapons/gear maxed? If so, try buying Spectre packs. You get less equipment, but they're all level 3."
MECoOp,383602,Kheben,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:56:44 2015 UTC,"Remember, you can avoid being sync killed by standing on a ramp and being on a different elevation to the enemy.  Side question: Why is it even called sync killing?"
MECoOp,383602,Kheben,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I've been trying to do. Although the heavy melee does have a tendency to take you off the ramp at times. But I only really use the melee to finish off an enemy so it hasn't been much of an issue. He's a lot of fun to play though   And I don't know why it's called that. I always thought of it like the enemies have to be in sync with you to trigger the animation, hence why the can't sync kill you when there's an elevation difference."
MECoOp,383602,Potataro,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:24:12 2015 UTC,He's very fun to play with; I take him into Gold Geth missions and wreck the place. Electrical Hammer for groups and shields; Biotic Hammer for the primes and single enemies.  I didn't realise that instant kills were what people meant by it immediately; insta-kill is a fairly self-explanatory term.
MECoOp,383602,Kheben,5,Thu Jun 4 23:09:53 2015 UTC,"Boast/Rant:   Playing a silver match that ended up pretty equal across the board (we were all between 60k and 70k) and we all did our part on objectives and no one really went down a lot. Seemed like a pretty good team. We're in the lobby for the next round and the leader bumps it up to gold. I always take that as a compliment, and I change out my equipment to be level III and ready up.   Match starts and we go a couple rounds smoothly. I'm not great at gold so I was really proud of myself that I wasn't royally fucking things up; I didn't want to let the team down.  This is where it gets weird. I go down near the end of the I think it was round five, and I get revived and immediately after that the wave ends. I then disappear and end up in 'spectating mode' as if I got sync killed. The new wave starts and I still haven't come back. I wait an entire wave. Next wave starts, still nothing. The group does a hack objective with just the three of them while I'm forced to simply watch. Kudos to them for kicking ass at it though.   When round 7 came around and I still never revived I finally quit. In hopes of being placed in the empty spot I created, I quickly attempted to join a gold match but alas that did not happen.  I'm not even upset I wasted the consumables or equipment, or got screwed out of XP and credits. I'm more upset that this group thought I was good enough to bump up to gold and I got glitched out and had to leave. I felt like I let them down, haha.  If you dudes are out there, I'm sorry."

I accidentally dropped into a Gold match (hit the wrong options on quick match) - Cerberus on Condor. Not only did I not spend the entire match dead, I managed to at least help out a little and we all extracted in the end.  If anyone playing Cerberus on Gold ran into a terrified-looking level 16 drell assassin with an Executioner Pistol I and an N7 score of 201 yesterday: thank you, and also - I sincerely apologize."

Now I just have Combat (200 grabs + about 300k melee damage) and Solo (ugh, not confident at all on this) to go and I'm all done.  Finally finished my character cards and I'm just about done on Rare weapons/mods as well. Not looking forward to the UR grind...   Rant:  I don't know why, maybe because I've become more aware of how spawns work, but I've found myself getting more and more frustrated at people nuking spawns on objective and extraction waves. If they're in the way, sure go ahead, but it seems like most people don't quite understand that they're just forcing them to instantly respawn elsewhere (sometimes right on top of other players >_>) or maybe they're just point-whoring (which is kind of lame/not much better).  Then there's the people who seemingly refuse to use a missile even when there's a 1234 going on with two praetorians right on top of the person working the objective.   Or the people who missile a boss that has 3 bars of armor left.  ... I think I just have issues with missile usage in general."

You know how spawns work, have all your character cards, level X gold weapons,etc.  You're ready for this!  If I were you I'd get a bronze solo in first, just so you get what you're doing.  Then the only bad thing about Solo Mastery is grinding Bronze and Silver solos (Keep in mind higher difficulty solos also give awards for lower difficulty solos).

MECoOp,37ssyj,zenspeed,10,Sat May 30 02:38:34 2015 UTC,"While I don't know much about the Huntress and Saboteur, I should be able to give you some tips on the Ghost.  The most important skill in his set is Tactical Cloak. Now there are three interesting things about TC and skill cooldowns:    TC's cooldown is proportional to the time it is activated. This means the longer you stay cloaked, the longer the cooldown is going to be. However it will also mean that if you break it fast enough, you will have a very short cooldown. 3 Seconds to be exact. If you break cloak by using a skill, instead of using that skills cooldown it will use TC's instead. The Ghost has a unique version of TC: Instad of getting +Sniper Damage at rank 6 he gets +20% Assault Rifle Damage for 10 seconds.   Another notable thing about the Ghost is the Stimulant Pack: It gives damage resistance, recharges your shields and buffs your own damage a bit. It will also grant you a brief period of invulnerability upon activation. As a grenade/ammo skill it doesn't have a cooldown and can be used any time.  All of this together means that you don't really have to care about weapon weight. Just take a good heavy assault rifle like the Harrier and a pistol or smg for backup.   The last skill in the Ghost's set is Overload, another insanely strong and versatile ability. It's amazing against Shields and non-organics, but once you get to rank 5 and take the Neural shock enhancement it actually becomes a valuable crowd control tool against organic enemies as well. It is also able to prime and trigger tech combos.   Playing the Ghost you will want to use Tactical Cloak and then immediatly break it by using Overload on your enemy. As mentioned above, TC will overwrite Overloads cooldown, so instead of having to wait 10+ seconds you will only have 3+ seconds of cooldown. The short cooldown also means you will be able to keep the uptime of your 20% assault rifle damage buff close to 100%.   I mostly use Stimulant Pack as a defensive ""get out of jail free"" card. Whenever you lose shields or are close to dying just push the button to recharge them and get a significant damage boost. This should help you get out of most sticky situations. As long as you have grenades, dying as the Ghost is actually hard. Did I mention it also doesn't break TC?  Other than that there isn't really much to say. Your Dodge is pretty awesome, but stay away from the heavy melee, even if it looks cool. If you are using the Harrier, you won't really have to worry about ammo that much, as you will be refilling you grenades often and vice versa.  TL;DR: The Turian Ghost has 3 of the best skills in the game which combined with his ability to more or less ignore cooldowns and high 20%+ assault rifle damage buff uptime enable him to mow down just about anything as long as you point him at the right direction. His no cooldown shield recharge/immunity/resistance/damage buff also makes him pretty much unkillable.  PS: PM me with errors and i'll edit them out, english isn't my first language."
MECoOp,37ssyj,0100010001000110,2,Sat May 30 03:28:22 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good overview. Also, if you don't have the Harrier unlocked yet, I would recommend the Collector Assault Rifle (a lot like the Harrier but less damage, more spare ammo, and less weight), the Mattock (basically a semi-automatic Harrier: pull the trigger fast enough and they're effectively the same thing) or maybe the Revenant (High damage, and the Turian passive helps with the stability issues)."
MECoOp,37ssyj,PlacidPlatypus,1 point,Sat May 30 04:47:25 2015 UTC,"Though also a UR, my go to is the lancer. Never need to reload, and then you only need to go to ammo boxes to replenish your stim packs, which is more like once every wave or two. As opposed to harrier ammo needs which ends up being like 5 times per wave."
MECoOp,37ssyj,smedes,8,Sat May 30 15:45:00 2015 UTC,I've always gotten whatever gives me the lowest CD   Know that cooldown reduction isn't linear. The difference between -200% CD and -150% is smaller than -50% and 0%. There are very few classes (some might argue no classes) that are going to benefit more from a 200% cooldown than they will from extra damage from a slightly heavier weapon.
MECoOp,37ssyj,bughumbar,5,Sat May 30 09:30:12 2015 UTC,"DPS support like priming and debuffs are still valuable on Gold+. Things like Recon Mine and Snap Freeze are extremely potent powers that I almost never see anyone skip. Think of yourself as a murder who can also support, just don't talk about turning the enemy's insides outside aloud.   Also note that equipment makes a big difference as they can amplify your skills greatly (double base shields is huge on tanker kits) or allow you to mod more effectively (like AP ammo negating the need for piercing mods)."

Slap your best assault rifle on him and then cloak, overload, shoot until cloak is off cooldown. Stimulant pack if your shields drop. This character is so simple he doesn't need a guide. He's sort of mindless, really.   Saboteur is not a character you should use if you want to deal damage. There's just better options. He doesn't really have anything going for him.   As for general DPS tips, my biggest one is to learn spawns. If you know where the enemy is likely to spawn, you can get there before they spread out and abuse any AoE abilities you have. Hitting 3-4 enemies with an inferno grenade is 3-4 times the damage of hitting one enemy with an inferno grenade. Nuking spawns with a missile is also great later on to speed up the later waves."

I'm not a close-and-personal sort of player, but are shotguns worth a look on Huntresses?"
MECoOp,37ssyj,cymikelee,1 point,Sun May 31 18:55:48 2015 UTC,"I'm actually interested in hearing what others say, especially with regards to tactics, because sometimes I feel I'm not nimble and ""brave"" enough to keep pumping lead into enemies.  Others can probably give you more specific builds for the Huntress, but I like to max out my cloak -> Dark Channel damage so that you can kill enemies without needing clear sightlines.  The nice thing is unlike other DoT powers you don't waste damage by shooting the same targets (or detonating biotic explosions with Warp) since the DC will jump to enemies up to 6 (?) meters away.  You can rely on ~3 second cloak cooldowns if you want to carry heavy weapons but I like to roll with relatively light pistols/SMGs targeted at mid-range.  For the Saboteur, I like to skip Sabotage so that you don't have to worry about cooldowns.  At that point you can go for high DPS assault rifles and SMGs (to take advantage of the Turian stability bonus), maybe the Hurricane looking at your manifest, and it'd be up to you if you wanted a longer-range single shot weapon to complement it.  Other than that just make sure to position your turret so it can help you put out damage fast and rain grenades on armor-heavy opponents like Dragoons and bosses (make sure to spec for armor/burning damage)."
MECoOp,37ssyj,UpsetLobster,1 point,Sat May 30 04:26:28 2015 UTC,"Asari Huntress eh? Great choice. She is a total beast.   You say you have trouble dpsing. I think I understand why. When you play support, it is not so much a question of doing something as doing something at the appropriate time. DPS is different. You are going into a 20 min match, and ideally you need to be shooting/using a power constantly for those 20 mins, with as little downtime due to movement or need to recover your shields or whatever.   To do that, you need enemies in front of you, all the time, that you can shoot at safely. That means you gotta know where enemies are (geth scanner is a good tool for that) and where enemies spawn, and position yourself in a way that you can shoot at them with right hand advantage.  Next up, the asari huntress. Unlike most infiltrators, her cloak does not boost weapon damage to insane levels. It does help with that, but most importantly it boosts her power damage.  I've found that cloak+DC, shoot shoot, cloak + warp, shoot shoot is the best way to take down bosses and armored enemies (she is a beast agaisnt those, so you should hunt them down)  Against other enemies like marauders just use cloak+ warp, shoot shoot. When hitting smaller targets, always make sure your DC is ticking away on an armored enemy, or if there are none about, do a cloak+dc, shoot shoot cycle on a mob, and when he dies, target with your next cloak + warp, shoot shoot the mob that dark channel skipped to.  For weapons, if you have the crusader delay fix sorted, crusader is best, then I also like the prothean sniper rifle, the talon, and the wraith.  If you play her well, she is an insane dps machine that can take down anything at all in short order.   use power boosters and warp ammo for consumables."
MECoOp,37ssyj,BlackwoodJohnson,1 point,Sat May 30 13:00:08 2015 UTC,"Doing more damage, especially on higher difficulties, is all about weapon amps and ammo powers (unless we are talking about heavy biotic or tech classes such as the slayer, cerbguard, and flamer classes, which benefit from power amplifier modules). The huntress only becomes really good if you put warp ammo on her along with a high powered (but still relatively light weight) gun like a harrier or a lancer. High fire rate weapons such as the reegar or particle rifle becomes exponentially more powerful with incendiary ammo. As with amps, even a TGI with a harrier won't cut it on higher difficulties without a level 3 rifle amp in addition to your ammo bonus."
MECoOp,37ssyj,Chypsylon,2,Sun May 31 00:19:17 2015 UTC,"You don't need a lightweight weapon on the huntress, you got cloak to mask the cooldowns. Also the damage bonus from the weapon amps is additively and thus pretty negotiable."
MECoOp,37ssyj,Spektr6,1 point,Sun May 31 07:08:44 2015 UTC,"Another weapon to consider for Asari Infiltrator (and biotics in general): the Acolyte. It's amazing in shield/barrier stripping powers, so that your dark channel can really get to work on the crunchy bits of enemies, i.e. health. Not weapon-based dps, strictly speaking, but it speeds up the killing of enemies, which is the key to gold+ success."

MECoOp,37p2m9,BlackwoodJohnson,3,Fri May 29 10:04:08 2015 UTC,"Geth Trooper for sure.  The Acolyte can be tricky, though.  I would not want to play with somebody on gold who is learning how to use it.  So, unless you are proficient with the Acolyte (I am not) I would recommend your Reegar Carbine with Flame Ammo 3 and Shotgun Amp.  I think I saw that you have the high velocity barrel in your equipment.  Use that and whatever else you want, but I would avoid making it any heavier.  Shielded enemies get the Reeger and armored enemies get the flamer.   If you equip a Cyclonic Modulator level 3, you should be pretty durable since it multiplies shields, and Geth have high shields already.  I did n't look at your gear bonus, but I would again buff your shields.  The people playing gold these days are usually really good, at least on PS3, so you should be fine.  And you'll open packets a lot more quickly!"
MECoOp,37p2m9,Jon9000,9,Fri May 29 18:21:23 2015 UTC,"Jumbo Equipment Pack is what you'll want for consumables. You don't want to go into a gold, especially not used to the difficulty level, without at least medigel and cobras. Your equipment looks fine, you don't need anything super special to be useful/helpful in gold matches."
MECoOp,37p2m9,Xtrordinari,5,Fri May 29 07:55:00 2015 UTC,"It looks like you've been ready for gold for quite some time. You have the Mattock at max level, so you could even make weapon-focused classes work. As /u/Xtrordinari mentioned, you should definitely buy a few Jumbo Equipment Packs to get some extra medigel and missiles. You have all your capacities maxed (able to take 6 medigel and missiles into a game), you have a good number of your gear bonuses at a decent level, and you have a good variety of guns unlocked. The Arc Pistol, Reegar, Raider, and Acolyte are already at a decent level, and you have several guns  like the Talon that are already beastly at lvl 1. Hell, your Typhoon is a higher level than mine, and I've played almost 4 times as many hours as you.   even if you didn't have the gear, if you know how to play, you can make power and combo focused classes work just fine. The base human engineer, adept, and sentinel all can be used with lvl 1 pistols, no attachments, and no gear, and still net you good scores on gold if you use them for combos.  Another suggestion would be to go ahead and spec your Krogan Vanguard. It looks like you haven't used vanguards very much, and he's a good way to learn how to abuse biotic charge (it helps that he's a tanky badass). you can spec him like this for now since he's at lvl 18 and when he's at lvl 20, have him specced like this. All you do is charge an enemy, melee, then melee some more (or maybe a shotgun shot or two). Rinse and repeat. Regaining barriers will keep you alive and all you have to do is figure out which groups are too big for you to charge into and which groups you know you can annihilate. Play against Geth to avoid sync kills and always host (you'll die off host because biotic charge won't activate when you need it to), and it'll be probably the easiest way you can possibly play a Gold."

Even common weapons at level 10 can be gold-viable, so just having stuff like the Adas, Carnifex, Reegar, Acolyte, etc. unlocked is good. You'll stumble over the difficulty curve, but that would happen if you waited until all your rares were level X too, so you might as well get it out of the way. Just help out on objectives and learn when to run away from trouble and you'll be fine.   Good on you looking to use consumables, too. You'll notice not everybody will. Don't be those people. One Jumbo Equipment Pack can buy back almost every consumable you could possibly use in a match."
MECoOp,37p2m9,UpsetLobster,2,Fri May 29 09:39:15 2015 UTC,"weapons wise, you have kischok, acolyte, mattock, reegar, arc pistol and adas that would work perfectly well on a number of builds.  Basically, any power based class with acolyte or arc pistol is gold viable.   You have so many badass characters unlocked, you could do plat with the gear you have.   what you need is to find a character that fits your playstyle so you are playing instinctively, and go for it.  go with krogran vangard and flame ammo reegar, or shaman with flame ammo reegar, or acolyte plus trooper...you have so many options already !"
MECoOp,37p2m9,TheBaconBard,2,Fri May 29 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"Just jump into it. At Lv 20, most biotic and tech classes actually do fine regardless of gear. I personally started to play and succeed at N7 level of 100 (and even that doesn't matter too much). Power classes have their strength regardless of what weapons/gear they are packing.

MECoOp,37p2m9,mcquotables,2,Fri May 29 14:11:11 2015 UTC,"Do it. As long as you use consumable equipment, it's all good.

Try to find lobbies that look like they know what they're doing and you'll make easy $$$. Most ""good"" players I know don't care what PUGs do on Gold as long as they put on even token equipment to show that you care about the outcome."
MECoOp,37p2m9,Shiboleth17,2,Fri May 29 15:52:43 2015 UTC,"Play with a power based class such as an Adept and it won't even matter much what gun you bring, as long as it's light.  Your skill at the game matters a lot more than gear.  It will probably take you several matches, but you should eventually adjust to the difficulty.  If you are that scared of it, play Firebase Giant and camp by the extraction point like everyone does when they wanna easy mode Platinum.  Back when this game first came out, we used to beat Gold without the gear equipment, the one that levels up and isn't consumed by using it... because that exist yet.  So that extra 30% Shields or 15% Sniper Rifle damage or extra 5 grenades you get now?  We didn't have that.  We also had to manage it using only the first 3 characters of each class.  Basic humans, basic turians, basic krogans, female quarians, salarians, and a couple drell and asari.  Keeping in mind, this was before Concussive Shot was buffed, so the Human Soldier was worthless on Gold back then.  This was also before Singularity got buffed, so the Human Adept wasn't all that good either.  Drell were OK, but extremely frail, so not many people could play them well, since you have to be pretty good at avoiding damage.  Vanguards don't last very long charging off on their own on Gold.  But seriously, we had no geth classes to play as, no N7 classes, no Justicar, no batarians, none of that.  So we were extremely limited in classes that were even viable on gold.  We also had a lot less weapons and weapon mods to choose from.  Ultralight materials?  Only use to exist for the SMG.  Penetration mod?  There use to only be the one kind, we didn't have the one that gave you penetration AND increased damage.  Power damage weapon mods? Those didn't exist at all, which made adepts and engineers a lot weaker.  As for guns, basically every gun you see people using on Platinum today didn't exist, other than the Black Widow.  We had no Acolyte, no Valiant, no Hurricane, no Particle Rifle, no Reegar, none of that.  In fact, a vast majority of the gold card guns didn't exist.  About the only way a lot of people could even beat it was the White Geth strategy.  You would camp in the room on the lower level of Firebase White, and play against Geth, because they had no sync-kills, and wouldn't flank you if you did it right.  Keep in mind, Firebase White was also different back then, as was the geth.  That back staircase leading between the lower back room and the one above it?  That used to be a solid wall.  The stairs were put there for the sole purpose of keeping people from playing this strategy.  And there were no Geth Bombers, so there was no running from grenades either.  One person had to be the Salarian Engineer, to put the decoy up in front of the door.  The decoy would attract all the Pyros and Hunters, and then 2 players would huddle behind that counter and use grabs to kill them as they got close to the Decoy.  The other players had the job of picking off the Rocket Troopers and wearing down the Primes before they got into the room, cuz if a full health Prime made it in there, it was pretty much use missile or fail mission.  And you had to have an infiltrator on your team, because they were the only ones who could get to objectives.  Any other methods, people would struggle to beat it.  It changed a lot after the first DLC, when we got characters like the Geth Infiltrator and Asari Justicar, as well as new weapons.  But man, did it use to be hard.  My point of all that, is that you don't necessarily need great gear or classes to beat Gold, because back in the day, we didn't have it either, because it didn't exist yet.  Having any of that puts you leaps and bounds ahead of the first times I played gold."

Just make sure you are maxed out on your consumables before going into battle and you'll be good enough.  You are ready.

MECoOp,37l7iu,zhouster,1 point,Thu May 28 13:24:59 2015 UTC,"How do you spec? Is it different from how you usually spec your asari adept for gold? Do you prefer Cyclonic Modulators, or do other consumables keep you alive better?"
MECoOp,37l7iu,Fyrjefe,3,Thu May 28 13:29:29 2015 UTC,"Here's how I usually spec it :)   On gold I sometimes go without fitness, although I'm not a big fan of that route in all honesty (I always find rank 6 of the passive kind of a ""meh can live without it"" on a number of classes). And yes, I always use cyclonics. They're just way too good, though I like adrenaline on gold sometimes. I also find her extremely fun with the Paladin."
MECoOp,37l7iu,smedes,3,Thu May 28 13:45:08 2015 UTC,"gotta love that arc pistol :)  I haven't played the Asari Adept on Gold+ in a long time because I enjoyed playing other biotic combo classes more (like the huntress, valkyrie, and fury). I never tried combining the biotic combos with the delicious headshots from Arc Pistols. I should definitley try this.  /u/SpiralofChaos might find this interesting. I know he's a big fan of the Asari Adept."
MECoOp,37l7iu,johnrocket-son,4,Thu May 28 13:54:35 2015 UTC,"Whew, I struggled on platinum with the Asari Adept last night. I need to revisit gold and get my mechanics down before I make a call on whether I need to change my build up.   The funny thing is that right before I completely stunk up the place in plats with her I said something along the lines of ""I would never use cyclonic modulators on the asari adept; they aren't worth it with her low base fitness stats."" In hindsight, I think I should reconsider."

MECoOp,37l7iu,Xiphwork,1 point,Thu May 28 16:00:19 2015 UTC,why do you take 4b over 4a for passive? Do you just rely solely on the BEs for damage output and think the extra power damage for warp/throw to be worthless?
MECoOp,37l7iu,Xiphwork,1 point,Thu May 28 14:12:07 2015 UTC,"You meant 4a over 4b right? Well I never really found warp's damage to be all that impressive and my power recharge is still really high to the point where the extra weight isn't going to make a significant difference, so I'd rather have more pistol damage, which in combination with stasis is what I use to take down health mooks. For the big guys like atlases and banshees I do a pattern of warp, shoot, throw, shoot, repeat to take them down quickly.   4a and 4b is mostly a preference thing on a number of non-turian kits for me at least. It's very loadout dependent, I feel. If I were using, say, the executioner pistol, I would definitely take 4b in that instance."
MECoOp,37l7iu,Spektr6,1 point,Thu May 28 15:56:09 2015 UTC,"oops, I meant 5b over 5a, but I guess the same reasoning applies. I find that the Justicar is pretty good at killing mooks near instantly, but Headshot bonuses don't apply to the bosses so I'd rather have the extra DoT from warp."

MECoOp,37l7iu,Knocking,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:15:35 2015 UTC,You start shooting and then cloak after it ups to the extra powerful beam. Since Ghosts can get AR damage increase from tac cloak it makes the already extra powerful shots almost facmeltingly strong. Combine this with the awesome fact that the four times powerful beam on the PPR will apply the ammo power 4x as powerful and you've got one of the highest DPS combos for a good 8-10 seconds in the game.  You can kill bosses on plat in one firing cycle. However beyond this I mostly agree with you.
MECoOp,37l7iu,Knocking,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"You know, I was under the impression that activating cloak---or any power really--- momentarily stopped you from firing, thus restarting the cycle.

Really, I make some attempt to coordinate classes with teammates, but unless they have a class that's easy to work with (Paladin/Overload/flamer spammer), I find it generally more trouble than it's worth to sync up biotics or something. I'd much prefer to be host (especially because I like playing plat at unlimited FPS), but I can deal with being off host without too much griping.   To seriously answer your question, I consider Infiltrators and Soldiers in general as classes I can carry with, and power based classes as classes I'm comfortable with and could possibly carry with. There are a lot of variations between different characters, but I'd feel comfortable bringing in say, the vanilla HA, AA, DA, SmashDept, Fury, GE, MQE, HSent, TSent, Paladin, VSent, Valkyrie, HV, AV, DV, KV, Slayer, and Cabal."

For the AV, I like to bring a good weapon (Wraith/Hurricane/Piranha) with Incendiary ammo. A quick lift grenade + weapon fire + charge for a FE generally goes through light armor (Pyros/Dragoons) and mooks quickly, and for the most part I leave boss units to teammates. It's normally a class I play when teammates are semi competent enough to stay alive and focus fire on big boss units, while I go around wiping out groups of mooks that are a real threat on Plat."

MECoOp,37l7iu,adamdesautel,3,Thu May 28 13:25:13 2015 UTC,The method I use is pull banshees and the like to a set of stairs. They cannot actually grab you on an inclined surface for whatever reason.

MECoOp,37l7iu,Jon9000,2,Thu May 28 13:44:34 2015 UTC,"I almost always adapt myself to synergize with my team.  If we have a Jugg I tend to bring a Demolisher with 4b and 6b evolutions for his shields. If we have a Jugg with biotic heavy support I'll bring my Justicar with a warp enhanced bubble. If the rest of the team is rather meh but we have a Jugg I'll just bring a Geth Tropper and burn everything. If the team already has suitable DPS I sometimes bring a Volus Engineer with Recon and Proxy Mine speced for vulnerability, so the entire team does +45% damage.  For biotic heavy teams (no Jugg) I tend to bring classes with AOE Reave / Cluster Grenades (hello Drell Adept), or a Collector for priming large groups and detonating. Sometimes I'll bring a Shockwave class for detonating in chains (Human Adept / Shaman / Batarian Sentinel are my favorites for that). I'll bring my Asari Valkyrie sometimes too, but I tend to leave that in my back pocket as it is one of my few AAA+ characters I'm good with.  Tech teams tend to be harder to choose which character to select. If we have a good AOE primer (Flamer / Snap Freeze), I'll usually bring a class with Chain Overload and just follow them around. Not many points, but I don't mind. Sometimes I'll just bring a simple female Quarian Engineer if we already have a strong Tech chain going for the ~2500 damage Incinerate does vs armor. Sometimes I just get lazy and just bring Arc Grenades and start chucking them everywhere.  My last resort is my AIU. That is my go to carry character if the team is that bad. Fortunately most teams don't get that far.  In short, I can use a lot of characters, the ones I use though depend on what everyone else is bringing."
MECoOp,37l7iu,Netfoolsmedia,2,Thu May 28 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"ya, i pick my characters in a similar fashion, trying to match with the team.  Recently, I've been trying to get better with the Smash Adept because smash is unique in that you can use it for both tech and biotic combo teams without a respec. If you use the tech priming evolution, you have a universal primer and detonator. The tech bursts that come from that evolution obviously deal slightly less damage than biotics would, but if you have somebody spamming a warp in btwn each of your casts of smash, you still get a biotic and tech detonation every cycle. The high DoT of the tech evolution also helps make up for the lower damage from tech bursts. If I can get used to using him on Platinum, I think he'll become on of my go-to builds since he could synergize well with a mixed biotic/tech team."
MECoOp,37l7iu,Ocean_Madness,2,Thu May 28 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"Hm, interesting build, I may have to try that some time. I've been using it as a Human Adept in a way myself. Prime with Singularity, detonate with Smash, then Singularity detonates and I get a second explosion. Kinda slow though to set it up properly.   I will definitely have to try out a tech evolution smash though, never done that before."

Geth Trooper - Flamer does way too much damage.  Asari Justicar - My favorite character: pretty tanky with Reave and Sphere resistances, Reave>Sphere>Reave for 2 BE's by only using 3 powers, the perfect anchor to any biotic squad, thanks to the Sphere set up, and the fact that both Reave and Sphere can prime and detonate BE's.  She even works well with tech since enemies will be taking more damage in the Sphere, and the Sphere can detonate TE's.  And if you thought the Jugg was tanky, wait til you see him camp inside a Justicar Sphere.  Asari Adept - The biotic I generally switch to when I see another Justicar in the lobby.  Warp and Throw are great things to have around when a Justicar Sphere is up, and half the enemies are Reaved.  N7 Paladin - Probably most people's go to character for a tech team.  Altho to be fair, he doesn't need a tech team, since he can generate every type of tech explosions by himself, and that doesn't even consider ammo powers.  I'll also switch to this guy when I got a ton of Incendiary Ammo or Cryo Ammo IV's in the bank that I need to use.  N7 Destroyer - I love pairing this guy with the Particle Rifle, since he can fire it significantly longer.  Super tanky, grenades that stagger, and doesn't give a crap about how heavy his guns are, so you can carry whatever you want."
MECoOp,37l7iu,ashes1032,1 point,Fri May 29 00:13:32 2015 UTC,"I just had a run the other day where I 2-maned a plat collector on Giant.  Realized very quickly the Juggernaut was gun dps specc'd and not necessarily full tank spec'd.  Guy would drop like a rock.  But once he realized he tended to not die while standing in my bubble, he was tanking Praetorians like a boss, so long as i remembered to keep refreshing the Sphere.  Defensive spec'd Sphere is such a lifesave for groups with a Juggernaut who's either just bad or trying to fill tank role while being dps spec'd."
MECoOp,37l7iu,RCK0,2,Fri May 29 21:35:14 2015 UTC,"My carry builds on plat center mostly around my Paladin or Collector.  I have a paladin that's built around power damage and explosions with some buffage towards melee damage (but not focused).  I run around and spew snap freeze like its going out of style and hope that my teammates capitalize on this with detonations, if not, I proc detonations myself. I play super aggressively which is very dangerous with my lack of hp bonuses but I make up for it with lots of soft cover, quick shield use or melee staggering between powers. This tends to net me top on the charts unless I'm playing with someone just that much better than myself or nets alot of points via flamer.  I generally have an easy time solo'ing many rounds if there is lots of cover and if I am either host or have a good connection to host.  My Collector is built like a soldier, all weapon damage upgrades, and HP upgrades. No biotic sphere and damage bonuses towards armor/barriers on Dark Channel and damage reduction buffs on Seeker Swarms.  Arm him with Particle Rifle and Warp ammo 4 and he melts Everything and Anything super fast, with the exception of Atlases since Shields are his weakpoint, but once the shield is down, the Atlas drops like a rock.  A banshee normally drops just under 2 clips and the dark channel keeps her going down between retreating and recharging of the gun.  The Dark channel is strong enough to either strip a phantom of her barriers and leave her half dead or finish her off if her barriers are already down.  With his tankiness, and high bonuses to assault rifle damage, very nice dodge movement type and Dark Channel, the collector makes for a good hit and run type when you are the only one left and need to wear down your enemies.   The Asari Huntress (Infiltrator) is another class I can use if i expect to have to solo many of my rounds, due to dead teammates.  With focus towards biotic damage and a cloak with the time length upgrade (makes some objectives much easier).  If I find a group that likes to bunker down I can go with the Justicar, with a Biotic Bubble upgraded for damage reduction I can make even the most fail juggernauts feel immortal.  I then spend the rest of my time between biotic bubbles just reaving enemies into oblivion if I have no fellow biotics, or setting off Biotic Explosions if i can coordinate it.  Personally, one of my favorite setups is if I can get a group of all/mostly Biotics and just keep those BEs going nonstop, or a Group with the engineer chain lightning effect to set off my Paladin's snap freeze Cryo Explosions."
MECoOp,37l7iu,RepublicanShredder,2,Fri May 29 06:07:11 2015 UTC,"Sounds like our tastes in classes are pretty similar. I'm a huge fan of Dark Sphere on the Collector, since I only have a Particle Rifle IV. If you have trouble with shields, have you considered putting 3 ranks into Dark Sphere at the expense of a little of your tankiness? If you skip the rank that gives you the 4th seeker swarm, you effectively lose ~190 shields if you're using a Cyclonic IV. The reason you should consider Dark Sphere is because it does the same damage to shields that it does to barriers and armor. If you're using a build like this with only 3 ranks in Dark Sphere, you could cast Dark Sphere, cast Dark Channel while Dark Sphere is floating towards your enemies, then immediately detonate the sphere, which activates its 11 second cooldown. This way you basically get a free cast of Dark Channel. The total damage to shields done by a Dark Sphere detonation with that spec would be 1925, which is the equivalent of several seconds of charged Particle Rifle fire combined with Dark Channel."
MECoOp,37l7iu,ifdef,1 point,Fri May 29 08:47:20 2015 UTC,"If I'm going to be in a heavy biotic group i might consider the sphere, but this build is designed around mobility and hit and run tactics while being self sufficient in that it doesn't need other biotics to accell. More biotics is just frosting on the cake.  The only enemy that has enough shields to matter is the atlas which is pretty slow. Drop a dark channel and 1 1/2 clips and his shield is down, then about 1 clip and he's dead.  I suppose Primes count too but can be dealt with similarly but with just a little more care since they are faster.  So yeah, it's a build that's very independent, tanky, mobile, and does serious single target damage that melts pretty much anything."

Like a good mix of soldiers/infiltrators, or tech explosions groups (fire/cryo/etc) or nice biotic groups can be great.  GT is same as my reddit name."

Bioware's guy/team/whatever that was handling bans is gone, which is why you ran into someone openly using that cheat in the first place. Kind of a dick move for them to use it in a public lobby, but ah well. You're all good."
MECoOp,37ij13,Kheben,2,Wed May 27 22:08:05 2015 UTC,Ahh good to know. I didn't shoot myself in the foot by ticketing support did I?
MECoOp,37ij13,Kheben,2,Wed May 27 22:16:08 2015 UTC,I very highly doubt it. Enjoy having gotten the extra packs!
MECoOp,37ij13,Friend-Beast,2,Wed May 27 22:22:06 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thanks!  After having not played the multiplayer for years and coming back to literally dozens of new characters I'll need all the help I can get haha."
MECoOp,37ij13,Draxonn,2,Wed May 27 22:23:55 2015 UTC,Yeah. I just switched to pc a couple of months ago so I started over. It's cool that every pack has a massive pool of weapons and characters to draw from.
MECoOp,37ij13,iGyman,2,Wed May 27 22:42:31 2015 UTC,I've been running into that more in the past few days.  It's annoying in public lobbies.  Usually with the extra cash comes other stupid buffs as well.
MECoOp,37c749,Scarecrow1779,11,Tue May 26 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"We all know that the Harrier/Hurricane/Reegar are awesome guns, but how about some builds or specs for other guns for those of us trying to complete the weapon mastery. To help with this, I think it would be cool if the BBLoB was searchable so we can see if there are any specific builds with the M-11 Suppressor for example."
MECoOp,37c749,Ye_Be_He,4,Tue May 26 20:13:20 2015 UTC,"that would actually be really cool, and relatively easy to add. simply add another column to the current table that shows links to builds. This column would say something like ""Suggested Weapon"" and for many would say something like 'high fire rate sniper' or 'any shotgun' or simply say a specific weapon. the information would come staight from the build writeup.  I too am a lover of interesting weapons. my recent build writeups suggested weapons like the Geth SMG, Striker, and Incisor."
MECoOp,37c749,cymikelee,5,Tue May 26 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe expand this to threads offering tips on completing all of the challenges?  Other than weapons, it'd be nice to find ways to farm melees (w/fun melee builds), over-cover grabs (maps/spots, etc.), or Husk/Nemesis/Geth Bomber kills."
MECoOp,37c749,Chypsylon,1 point,Tue May 26 23:38:28 2015 UTC,For Grabs do a bronze solo vs Cerberus and camp behind the barriers on the lower area of Dagger. Quit on wave 6 or whenever phantoms appear and repeat. You can get between 40-60 grabs per match this way.
MECoOp,37c749,SixtySecondstoEarth,1 point,Wed May 27 06:45:56 2015 UTC,"ya, there are several great places to do solo matches and farm grabs. I've completed the grab challenge 3 times and only used this technique for the first time.  doing White/Reaper/Gold solo and sitting in the top left corner next to the number 6 on this map results in most of the cannibals and marauders sitting back inside the building while a constant stream of husks runs across in front of you to be grabbed. using a class with annihilation field makes it even easier as it will stagger the husks and help make sure you don't get overran. You'll get at least 20 grabs in the first 2 rounds. then you either complete round 3 or just die, depending on your preference and skill. rinse and repeat. (yes, i know the map is of the pre-patch version of FBW, but the part I refer to is unchanged)"
MECoOp,37c749,Detenator,1 point,Wed May 27 14:01:47 2015 UTC,"For Grabs, Bronze Solo on Vancouver v Cerberus.  On the bottom floor, next to the two air conditioning ducts that run parallel to each other, get behind cover in the middle of the duct on the opposite side of the room from the ladder.  Bounce back and forth between the two ducts to get enemies who jump over them to get you, or enemies who are hiding behind the far duct.  You do have to be fast, but you can pretty much grab everybody who can be grabbed (bring a character with pull or lash for bonus guardian grabs).  Acolytes for the phantoms and missiles for the Atlases, and you can get 250 grabs in about two hours."

MECoOp,37c749,UberMcwinsauce,6,Tue May 26 19:11:06 2015 UTC,I'd like challenges/events that involve gameplay!
MECoOp,37c749,RepublicanShredder,2,Tue May 26 20:36:27 2015 UTC,We've done this before but nobody entered. Same for x of the week. It just ended up with like 1 or 2 people posting responses. Maybe when me4 comes out.
MECoOp,37c749,Detenator,5,Wed May 27 08:30:34 2015 UTC,Any or all of the above. I think X of the week gives reminders or incentive to try out things you never have or to give another look to something you thought wasn't very good.
MECoOp,37c749,cymikelee,7,Tue May 26 20:38:38 2015 UTC,I agree with that. the recent 'why you should love concussive shot' post gave me reason to respec my female human soldier to a cryo rounds build to try out.
MECoOp,37c749,RepublicanShredder,6,Tue May 26 21:32:55 2015 UTC,I appreciate hearing that. Now I'm fairly convinced to re-try the 'X of the week' posts because of it.
MECoOp,37c749,Detenator,3,Tue May 26 23:24:19 2015 UTC,"Back in the day there was a series called ""X of the Week."" The mods would sticky a weekly post with the title ""Adept of the Week,"" ""Krogran of the Week,"" etc, and you would discuss why you thought a specific character was the best. Whether it is in terms of raw power (always GI), best overall effectiveness (Shaman, who can be an effective power, weapons, OR melee class), etc. As far as I can tell there was only one week devoted to powers, probably because they are pretty linear as opposed to character sets as a whole. The ""winner"" of the week would be announced after seven days had been up in a new thread, I don't recall ever seeing this, but search results show a fair amount of winner threads. Here is an example of a thread from Valentines week 2014.  I like your second idea though. Given the numerous number of builds and people with nearly maxed manifests, it could work at this point of a game's life."
MECoOp,37c749,Detenator,2,Tue May 26 20:43:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like powers could be given more depth by categorizing them -- biotic, tech, grenade at a broad level, or go more granular with categories like damage protection (tech armor, barrier, rage, reave, seeker swarm, etc) or force-oriented (concussive shot, lash, throw)"
MECoOp,37c749,Detenator,5,Tue May 26 22:46:20 2015 UTC,"The grenade of the week would be every grenade because grenades are awesome, especially those that are grenades."
MECoOp,37c749,RepublicanShredder,2,Tue May 26 22:54:19 2015 UTC,Homing grenades and Arc grenades (human) are far inferior to the others in my opinion.
MECoOp,37c749,cymikelee,1 point,Tue May 26 23:15:40 2015 UTC,"...have you ever thrown multiple grenades within 10 seconds? I can down a Geth Prime with an N7 Destroyer almost as fast as I can with a Krogan Warlord (and that's really fast), while the splash damage from the arc grenades kills off everything else nearby as well. Arc Grenades are amazing for their AoE and Homing Grenades (like sticky grenades) are great for single-target, anti-armor damage."
MECoOp,37c749,cymikelee,3,Tue May 26 23:44:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't say they (or grenades in general) were bad, I said those two specifically were inferior to other grenades. The Demolisher's (which is who I assume you are referencing, not the Destroyer) Arc grenade does not have the 2x shield/barrier multiplier that Quarian arc grenades do, and only 2/3 of the radius. If she had access to the top tier grenades she would be way too overtuned."
MECoOp,37c749,Potataro,2,Tue May 26 23:57:49 2015 UTC,"I knew about the difference in radius, but I didn't know about the difference in damage. Kalence doesn't show this difference. could you point me in the direction of a post or page talking about the difference in damage?"
MECoOp,37c749,SpiralofChaos,2,Wed May 27 00:23:52 2015 UTC,"http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/194k9r/me3_coop_college_604_grenades/  Specifically:   On Quarian Males, Arc Grenades have a base 2x modifier vs Barriers/Shields. Note that the base radius on the Quarian Males are 8m, while the N7 Demolisher has 6m.   Also, it isn't 2/3 the radius, it is 3/4. Because I'm dumb.  The Narida builder shows them working as explained in that post."
MECoOp,37c749,Detenator,1 point,Wed May 27 01:40:12 2015 UTC,"Homing Grenades home in, which is a nice feature. Very useful if you aren't a grenade aficionado or only have a split second to land a full damage grenade.   Human Arc Grenades are balanced to be somewhat weaker in response to the fact that the N7 Demolisher can restore her grenades at frightening frequency. They're still really good regardless."

MECoOp,37c749,Robertamus,9,Tue May 26 23:24:07 2015 UTC,"What about maps?  No one's mentioned them yet, but it'd be interesting to hear people's advice on spots that overlook spawn points, choke points, wallhacks, little nooks with good sightlines (on Reactor and Condor, for example), or places where you can knock mooks off the map.  Location glitches (never tried these, but heard about the dam/waterfall on Hydra?) would be interesting, but I'd love to know if it's possible to get to places that only pets and enemies can get to right now (like the upper containers on Ghost or platforms on Reactor and Giant)."
MECoOp,37c749,AJockeysBallsack,2,Tue May 26 23:27:56 2015 UTC,"You can stand on certain platforms you normally shouldn't by basically rubbing against the corner of certain boxes.  The easiest and most noticeable one I've done is the somewhat-large air conditioning box just below the large ramp on FB Vancouver.  There's also a small box on Rio near the Box-of-Shame (the one with the ammo) that does the same thing, but it's just so far out of the way that it's not flashy or strategic.  Maybe I'll make a video of it, but yeah, I'd like to see bugs like that."
MECoOp,37c749,zhouster,7,Wed May 27 16:20:13 2015 UTC,"I am a fan of new builds and discussing/reworking old builds of characters. I feel like we sort of left the BBLOB as it stood forever ago, but there are better builds out there yet!"
MECoOp,37c749,cymikelee,3,Tue May 26 15:59:33 2015 UTC,"The issue with maintaining the current iteration of the BBLoB is that builds must be reviewed in theory and practice. Thus there is a team of players who must analyze a guide, play a specific build, and then rate it. The longer the game exists the less people that will actively play it or participate in the community, so this council is difficult to keep around.  The BBLoB for ME4 will likely be cut down a bit as Kojak has expressed he feels it is much too complicated."
MECoOp,37c749,Potataro,2,Tue May 26 17:26:24 2015 UTC,"ya, i understand it takes a ton of work to add a new entry to the BBLoB. I'm happy putting out the builds that aren't already on the sub. the search bar for this sub is often a better resource for builds anyway. the only thing the BBLoB has that a simple post doesn't is additional peer review. some of that can be provided in comments."
MECoOp,37c749,Yetanotherfurry,3,Tue May 26 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"I second this. I'm late to the party, but I've definitely searched through this subreddit on ideas for builds when I want to try something new or just have no ideas.   I've found those types of threads quite useful."

MECoOp,37c749,Potataro,5,Tue May 26 19:54:44 2015 UTC,I think the boasting/ranting threads are sort of a catch-all right now to keep meaningful conversations going -- definitely love OP's suggestion to get some more specific threads up.
MECoOp,37c749,RepublicanShredder,4,Tue May 26 23:31:36 2015 UTC,I'd love to see some self-imposed challenges added.  Things like the Thunderdome challenge that change the way you play.

MECoOp,37adjl,redx1105,7,Tue May 26 07:26:00 2015 UTC,I finally unlocked the N7 Fury. I slapped the Acolyte on her and just tore shit up. It was kinda hard to play with the accompanying erection.
MECoOp,37adjl,Robertamus,3,Tue May 26 06:43:49 2015 UTC,I must be retarded because I've never been able to use the Acolyte effectively.
MECoOp,37adjl,redx1105,5,Tue May 26 07:25:13 2015 UTC,"Charge while moving/using powers and shoot.  It's AOE, so you don't even have to aim."

MECoOp,37adjl,N7Panda,2,Tue May 26 08:40:10 2015 UTC,I've tried and failed before. I tend to use the Talon on a Fury but may try the Acolyte again.
MECoOp,37adjl,ProtoKun7,1 point,Tue May 26 13:00:19 2015 UTC,It takes some practice. At first I really didn't like it but it grows on you.
MECoOp,37adjl,PlacidPlatypus,3,Tue May 26 14:16:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I failed hard at it the first time I tried, but what worked for me was not thinking of it as a gun.  It's almost like a mini grenade launcher that shoots a shield-stripping pellet that bounces until it hits something.  The surprisingly large splash radius made it easier for me to learn than other chargeup weapons like the arc pistol and Graal.  The physics on the explosion make it a fun gun to use against husks as well."
MECoOp,37adjl,Fyrjefe,1 point,Tue May 26 22:54:53 2015 UTC,I found Acolyte to be too wieldy for me. Give me a scimitar X any day of the week.

MECoOp,37adjl,Fyrjefe,2,Wed May 27 14:13:49 2015 UTC,"It's a little slower, and I tend to use weapons that dole out the damage over longer periods. You have to use good cover and unleash your stuff between shots. It's not one of those that you unload right away. It's suplimentary damage. I find the tempo to be 4 shots, combo, 4 shots."

MECoOp,37adjl,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Wed May 27 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"When I first tried to use the Acolyte with biotic classes, it felt too awkward and messed with my rhythm of priming and detonating and i hated it. What got me used to using the acolyte was just using it on a class like the Krogan Soldier that has excellent anti-armor capabilities. Take any class that has Incinerate or Carnage, go host a silver or bronze lobby, and play a few matches against Geth. Acolyte to get rid of shields, then followed by the anti-armor power, then another acolyte shot while you're waiting on your cooldown to stagger them or kill them if they're on health. This is what got me used to the acolyte and helped me understand how powerful it is... Also, the acolyte eats phantoms for breakfast when they aren't cloaked.  also, any gun that isn't hitscan (in other words the projectile takes time to get to the target) is more difficult to use off host. this includes the kishock, acolyte, graal, geth plasma shotgun, and several others."
MECoOp,37adjl,Robertamus,1 point,Tue May 26 15:20:56 2015 UTC,It definitely takes some getting used to. I used it to strip shields then let annihilation field and throw clean up the rest. Good times.

MECoOp,37adjl,Knocking,4,Tue May 26 10:08:56 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't remember the funniest thing I heard through the mic, most of the time I run into people with mics, they're not very talkative or keep it to conversations about the game.   Boasting: I scored over 250K in two U/U/G games today, one of which was at 144+ FPS. Admittedly I was hosting both games, using the GI/Fury, and nuked a W11 spawn, but it felt pretty good to go full score whore and see how many kills I could get. That was pretty fun, and using on host Fury at 144fps is super responsive and lag free, a far cry from my normal off host 60fps games.   Ranting: 144fps enemies are bloody terrifying, and playing off host sucks. I'm sure my host is shitty for the rest of the lobby, but ops packs and projectile powers are just so annoying to use off host."
MECoOp,37adjl,crashsuit,5,Tue May 26 04:39:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the game looks great, but at that high FPS you're going to start breaking game mechanics like shield regen.

MECoOp,37adjl,Knocking,2,Tue May 26 17:19:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like it should be fixed, but at the same time the side effects are pretty fun. If I wasn't a stellar player or aware of the bugs with unlimited FPS, the game would be utterly brutal and buggy, a bad combination. It might just be my host, but from the three games I played the average gold pugger absolutely cannot hang on unlimited FPS."

The RNG God's also smiled on me yesterday, after trying for the last week or two to unlock one of the default Krogans, I finally got the Krogan sentinel. And I also got the Demolisher and the Scorpion in the same pack. So I finally have a useful pistol and can start working through my collection of pistol rail amps."

On the upside, I don't recall seeing a Rocket Trooper fire multiple rockets at once a single time during the game."

I'm not sure if I want to buy it, since my origin account already got hacked once and I've only even had it for a few months.  I'm also not sure if I want to go through the grind again.  On the other hand, I really have missed playing this game and maybe the PC community will be a little more active.  Mods also look like a fun new take on the game."

Anyway, AFAIK the only way to hack for bonus credits is to host your own match.  So I was trying to suggest that you tweak your coalesced, host a private match - solo it - then reap in all of the credits.  Then go back to normal settings and play with others again."
MECoOp,37adjl,Chypsylon,2,Tue May 26 19:46:11 2015 UTC,Given that a fair share of this sub already has done it without getting nasty comments I wouldn't worry about it.

I had one where two players chatted in Russian for the entire match. I think they started yelling at me at one point, I definitely heard ""Captain"" repeated a couple of times, but I had no idea what they were trying to tell me. Since ME chat dims the sound of the game during chat, I died a number of times because I couldn't hear enemies over the Russian. I also ended up topping the match by a fair margin.  Missiles were buggy for me one match. I'd fire and it wouldn't do any damage or it would fire multiple missiles at once. That was exciting.  I also had a fun moment on Reapers/Goddess/Gold where I got picked up by a Banshee and revived invincible. My shields would go down, but my health wouldn't and I wouldn't be sync-killed. I also basked in the joy of Frag Grenade spam during that match, at one point unloading 9 of them into one spawn and giggling to myself as I watched Ravagers pop and deflate."

First game I joined all of the icons for consumables and powers were just like I guess ""default"" icons, not the actual icons for each of them. And tactical cloak and stim pack had switched the button they are meant to be mapped to, so tactical cloak was on left bumper instead of Y and vice versa. The second game, I couldn't see the other two players in the game. They weren't on the scoreboard and their kills weren't showing up, but it did show when the got 25 kills etc. We got a hack on wave 6 and it was displaying 2 players uploading instead of 4, but when it got to about half way it finished and said hack complete.

But wait, their are some people that do have the dlc, and those people I have found are only on in the afternoon US time. Every other time it's no go for the dlc  so instead of uninstalling and reinstalling the DLC every 12 hours, what I did today is move the DLC onto an external hard drive so it won't take me so long to get it back next time that I would like to play the extremely fun maps."

MECoOp,370n3n,dyldozer88,16,Sat May 23 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"Obligatory link to the college entry on the store.  Conventional wisdom is to buy recruit packs until commons are maxed (sounds like you've already got that covered), then veteran packs until uncommons are maxed. For rares, you have a few options:   Spectre packs if you want to get a decent amount of equipment in addition to unlocking weapons and characters Arsenal packs if you don't care about character unlocks and want to max your weapon unlocks per credit spent ratio, and aren't too worried about rare weapon mods. Note that you will still unlock rare character cards, albeit with very low probability. But once your rare weapons are maxed and you are just grinding for ultra rares, you will get 2 rare characters with almost every AP until you max characters too. Premium spectre packs if you want about 3x more rare weapon mods per credit spent as compared to arsenal packs, or a middle-of-the-road chance of character cards. You will get common character cards every so often even if you have the common characters maxed, giving 250k xp per card. Reserves packs if you want more characters. You will get about one common character card for every 2 ResPs you buy, so if you're not interested in the xp, you are wasting money on these once your characters are maxed.   For ultra-rares, note that APs, PSPs, and ResPs have the same drop rates - about 15 UR weapons per hundred packs you buy. ""UR"" characters actually drop at exactly the same rate as rare characters, so you will max them long before you are even a quarter of the way through your URs, I'd guess. Anyway, what this means is that once you max out everything except UR weapons, you should buy APs unless you are promoting and interested in regular doses of 250k xp.  In conclusion, my personal recommendation is this:   Veteran Packs until uncommon weapons are maxed Premium Spectre Packs until rare weapon mods are maxed Arsenal Packs until you die.   And a final note: BioWare no longer even checks for cheating, and there are... ways... to greatly speed up the process of maxing URs. Not gonna say more about it here, but you should know it's possible."
MECoOp,370n3n,smedes,4,Sat May 23 20:22:44 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that depending on what your goals are the conventional wisdom is wrong. If all you care about is rares you should go straight to PSPs (or arsenal packs if you don't want characters). The rarity is constant for each pack regardless of what you have maxed.  That said your advice is pretty good, I'd amend it slightly to:   Veteran Packs until you have some basic uncommon weapons, mods, and gear. Premium Spectre Packs until rare weapon mods and character are maxed. Arsenal Packs until you die."
MECoOp,370n3n,PlacidPlatypus,6,Sat May 23 23:14:07 2015 UTC,"You're right - if all you want is rares and URs as fast as possible, you should just buy 99k packs all the time. I think the reasoning behind the conventional wisdom has to do with uncommon gear/mods and actually having enough equipment and consumables to use as you are continuing to earn money for the next pack. Like if you are playing at bronze or silver and you only buy one pack per 5 games or whatever, and that pack only has 1 consumable and 2 equipment slots, you're going to run out of them. It's probably reasonable to buy 99k packs and JEPs when necessary but I don't know if anyone has crunched the numbers on that.  Your amendments are the right call - as long as you don't run out of medi-gel.  So I guess I'd amend further a ""JEP when necessary"" clause haha."
MECoOp,370n3n,smedes,3,Sun May 24 02:24:30 2015 UTC,Arsenal Packs will max out rare weapons the fastest.
MECoOp,36yqz6,TheBaconBard,3,Sat May 23 06:35:19 2015 UTC,"I'm on PC and my housemate is on 360.  He claims that it's not that bad when he hosts, better than PC. There's the occasional person who teleports around but that seems to be rare.  On PC I host when I'm playing vanguards and most people that join don't seem to have an issue.   Don't let lag stop you from hosting a game, some characters need decent connection to play (cabel for example) Most people I've played with accept it.  Just a tip when you're not hosting, I've found that when I start to rubber-band/teleport around, moving into cover forces you to a set point and stops the issue. Just move into cover whenever that happens and you should be good."
MECoOp,36utcu,RepublicanShredder,5,Fri May 22 08:24:33 2015 UTC,"Cryo-spec CS is custom made for a Talon user. It already fires semiauto so you don't lose much damage from casting, as you would from interrupting a full-auto weapon. Low weight, high ammo proc, tears through shields. This combo eats the three organic factions for breakfast. You're still reasonably effective against Geth since they come at you in straight lines, CS staggers well, the chil damage still applies, and the Talon naturally kills shields.   I also occasionally pair it with the Saber or Falcon depending on range and team composition. Any semi auto weapon where you can cast naturally in between shots works well."
MECoOp,36utcu,funkymustafa,2,Fri May 22 13:55:22 2015 UTC,Well that gives me something to try tonight. I never thought about semi-auto weapons pairing well with CS since Adrenaline Rush works so well with full auto guns.

MECoOp,36utcu,carnage_panda,3,Fri May 22 15:33:21 2015 UTC,"The damage on concussive shot is terrible, but it's a fantastic power.  I've never put more than 3 points into it though. Even at that rank, it's fabulous."
MECoOp,36utcu,BlodhgarmDethahal,2,Sat May 23 01:35:17 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on doing 4b and 6a evolutions (one or both of them) for the increased radius?  I've also seen people compare this power to Carnage a lot. Not saying I agree with them since they fill different roles (crowd control for CS and direct damage dealing for Carnage), but they both detonate Tech/Fire and have reasonable cooldowns. Of the two, which would you say is more useful in a standard PUG Silver+ game?"
MECoOp,36utcu,bughumbar,3,Fri May 22 09:00:37 2015 UTC,"Like what bughumbar said, it basically is worthless. Also the radius is pitiful (for reference, a human is about 2m tall).   Carnage vs CS? I assume you mean choosing between the regular and BF3 Soldiers. As a whole I say CS but I will expand on that in a few hours from now.  Edit- Turns out a few hours was longer than I expected.   Carnage does have a few advantages, namely the ability to prime for Fire Explosions. However, it has a much slower recharge time (double that of CS at 10 seconds), does not innately ragdoll enemies (it can with Rank 5a), and has a slower projectile speed (easier for enemies to dodge). I'd only choose Carnage over CS when I need an armor-destroying skill. Since a decent amount of guns, with the appropriate ammo/mods, can punch heavy enemies with ease I choose CS as my standard."
MECoOp,36utcu,Name213whatever,2,Fri May 22 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"According to the college, CS can only affect one target, making the radius evos (in my opinion) borderline useless.  Carnage at least can hit two targets, though I can't say I've ever used it much. I think it can prime as well, which CS can't."
MECoOp,36utcu,BlodhgarmDethahal,5,Fri May 22 11:33:27 2015 UTC,"Carnage can prime and detonate, yeah. Pair a krogan soldier with some grenade gear and carnage and you are like a one ton firestorm."

MECoOp,36utcu,Jon9000,2,Fri May 22 17:29:33 2015 UTC,"I like CS as a pairing with Proximity Mine on the Turian Soldier. When combined with the Falcon and Cryo ammo, he has the capacity to stagger and hold up pretty much entire spawns of troops, with the added slow and armor weakening. Think it works nicely on Cerberus with the rusher classes they have, stops em from swarming you as quickly.  I've used that approach on Gold as I'm still pretty gear poor atm, it meant combos and easy pickings for my team as they could just line up and drop em."
MECoOp,36utcu,ElMacedonian,1 point,Sat May 23 11:19:40 2015 UTC,"I never put points in CS.  I might respec and give it at try.   The soldier classes are more or less built around boosted weapon damage and shielding from Adrenaline Rush and Marksman.  If you carry heavy weapons, these powers make up for the extended cool down that comes from carrying them.  Concussive Shot is not worth the cool down in that situation.  I suppose if you have a really great weapon leveled high enough for it to be relatively light, like the Harrier, or you want to use the Hurricane, I could see carrying CS.  With the Human, you are giving up Adrenaline Rush or Grenades.  Again, grenades have no cool down, so they gel nicely with Adrenaline Rush with a long cool down due to carrying big guns in a away that Concussive shot cannot.  As for the Turian, you are going to give up either marksman or Sticky Grenade.  If you give up marksman, you have concussive shot and sticky grenade, which are too similar to really need both.  Better to choose one.  I always take the grenades, because they are outstanding for those ""oh, crap"" moments when somebody is closing in on you.  Most importantly, they cannot be dodged, they stagger most enemies, and I think they even have AOE.  I guess that overall, I find the powers they compete with to be more useful on the particular classes that carry it.  The only real advantage I can see is the ability to detonate on classes that otherwise don't have the ability.  That is a pretty strong bonus."
MECoOp,36utcu,BlackwoodJohnson,5,Fri May 22 15:26:44 2015 UTC,"The thing is that concussive shot is a power that supports the shit out of weapons.   You stagger them so they can't shoot you back, while even if they dodge it you have forced them  dodge and that makes for easier headshots. This fourced Situation allows for greater percision from you which not only results from more headshots, but much better ammo conservation and on good and plat with guns like harrier, mattock, hurricane, ammo capacity can often be a limiting factor on damage output.   Having a  heavy weapon benifits very much so from detonator rounds and honestlly fire explosions on this soldier have a rediculous effect on his damage output that it almost trivializes other ammo ap and warp also great, but my experience the potential AOE and burst damage is more effective. atypical cycle I do with the typhoon is to start shooting, concussive shot as soon as I've primed them, then after I get the cooldown backup I use adrenal lie rush to get another clip of an already ramped up typhoon.   You mention that you have to loose somthing to get the concussive shot into the build though, with this I disagree. I think that if I have an ability that let's me reliably set up headshots and self detonate that is a much bigger boost to overall damage output if I want to take points out of the passive. And the added survivability and utility it gives you makes up for having just a little bit less health on a class that already has a shield recharging power. You loose so little by putting 4 points instead of six into the passive or fitness and you just gain so damn much."

MECoOp,36w2i1,RepublicanShredder,2,Fri May 22 18:47:53 2015 UTC,"That's part of the 10% inaccuracy.

Like ME3, powers also have non-intuitive mechanics that make them occasionally super interesting.   The gameplay is engaging for me because you can't take cover, showing off how much of a badass you are. The gameplay is significantly less tactical, which is not a bad thing."

You're a walking medic. What's not to like as long as you have 3 other damage dealers?   As for the Volus, you should never go full support. Damage dealing should be a goal for everyone. No matter your character, you should be able to carry your own weight. I understand that not all characters are created equally (ie the Sexbot), but you should try to compete with even the top tier characters. Damage deal promotes staggering which interrupts attacks, which helps protect teammates. It also runs up the spawn calculator, which ends rounds faster.

MECoOp,36q1qn,smedes,3,Thu May 21 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"If you thought it was good before, let me introduce you to incendiary ammo. Using this build, you can kill any humanoid enemy on gold in a one-two punch of acolyte -> poison strike.  The build makes a few changes that improve on yours.   We carry a hurricane with high velocity barrel and heat sink in addition to the acolyte. This helps with guardians, bosses, and turrets you have to destroy from behind cover. We swap out the pistol rail amp for an SMG rail amp because the acolyte doesn't need any more juice to hit the thresholds it needs to. We take rank 4A of Turian Veteran instead of 4B. Even with the second weapon and the loss of the extra capacity, cooldown is stilll sitting at 180%, which is indistinguishable from 200% during gameplay. This also gives our hurricane more power, and more importantly, more stability.   I made a google doc calculator for this build a while back. You can make a copy and mess with it yourself. It's here:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zUGz-B9IOz6PqHYPK9gFpWjsZkMMx1rF-VDcMg6sXRc/edit#gid=1739960322  You can see that even after making those changes, only 3 enemies survive the initial acolyte-poison strike: Dragoons, Possessed Collectors, and Possessed Captains (and they survive it on your build too, assuming you were using incendiary ammo). The Damage Over Time from Poison Strike will finish them off, so you can move on to the next target.  A few things to watch out for:   Phantoms who are flipping around getting their damage reduction, or who have their bubbles on. When you strip their shields with your acolyte, they won't do either of these things, but if your teammates are shooting at them, they might. Dragoons, Possessed Collectors, and Possessed Captains shooting you in the ass before the DOT finishes them off. Combat Engineers. Sometimes when you kill them, the turret on their back/in their hands will explode, which pulls you out of your poison strike and staggers you. It won't do any damage, but you might end up getting merced by something else lurking around them. Actually, getting staggered in general. Large groups of strong humanoids. 2 phantoms and 2 dragoons will probably still kill you. Abominations are usually not an issue because there is a delay before they detonate and your Poison Strike probably carried you far enough away, but don't take it for granted with Possessed ones. Guardians. As I said, just switch to your Hurricane. Geth Hunters. Even when staggered, they can still shoot you. Seeker swarms/scourges sneaking up on you. If you ever get hit with one, use your awesome dodge to GTFO until you can use powers again. Don't try to tough it out, you're not that beefy.   TL;DR: use incendiary ammo and bring a Hurricane."

I finished 70k above the second place finisher in one match as well as completed 75% of all the objectives on my own. Another time, I ended up getting sync-killed and had to watch a Volus take fifteen minutes to kill a Phantom, a Cerberus Engineer, and a half-dead Centurion. The best part was when, at the fifteenth minute, he stasis bubbled the phantom, ran up to it, and began heavy meleeing. I turned my mic on just to ask if he was fucking serious.  Other than that, it was the usual PUG fun--people letting themselves bleed out, refusing to revive in Gold objective waves, missiling spawns on objective waves, Biotic Slashing right next to my Javelin Sniper even though the enemies were too far away to be Biotic Slashed, camping the extraction zone on maps other than Giant, Warlords who would start each wave by meleeing Banshees or Phantoms and getting sync-killed immediately, etc.  I also had a bad string of zigging instead of zagging on one match and ending up on the wrong end of Banshee kisses. I haven't been sync-killed that many times in a single match for months."

Had a few very well timed missiles which helped the team get through the later rounds and get the full extractions. Also started doing gold pugs which are fun even though i dont have many ammo consumables which makes things a little harder. If i played a little smarter it would make things easier.

MECoOp,36j6bc,crazycoffin,2,Thu May 21 22:02:25 2015 UTC,"I know I've already complained about it once, but GOOD GOD the PUGs have been bad. I decided to promote my soldier class to play around with some builds and took a level 1 human soldier into Silver... where I proceeded to double the score of the second place finisher, complete most of the objectives, and get my revive medals. And I skipped the first wave.  Seriously. If you're 2 level 20 Juggernauts in Silver, how do you each die 4 times in every wave? YOU CAN LITERALLY SUCK THE LIFE FROM YOUR ENEMIES. The other was a Widow-wielding Vorcha Sentinel, which was nearly as baffling as the Juggernauts.  I ended up not being able to find a new match and stayed for another. I have to admit, part of me was also curious what I could score with a level 6 soldier with such a terrible team. We ended up pulling Cerberus/Glacier Hazard and I got killed a few times by the Hazard (both games were super laggy, plus I kind of hate Glacier) and my teammates refused to revive me, despite the fact that I was constantly reviving them. Around Wave 5, I said ""fuck it"" and proceeded to stop reviving them and just concentrated on killing things. I also blew a few missiles when I got stuck in difficult place instead of hoping that they'd help me. The final score wasn't quite the blowout of my previous match, but it was still something like 90k to 60k.  I know it's only Silver, but damn.

Kind of nice to be able to jump right into Gold with it.  Seems like there's been an influx of new/returning players this week and/or just been getting some iffy groups in general.  On one hand it's nice to top the board and feel like I'm carrying a bit, but it's pretty annoying when you get people not helping on objectives or missling something that's either alone (and not on top of the objective) or mostly dead."

Just finished a couple gold matches using my newly unlocked TGI with a team that felt a little off.  The second one (Condor/Collectors, ugh) I actually scored last, but I swear I must've had like 30 revives.  The team (Fury, Destroyer, Human Soldier) was just running all over the place and dying constantly, but still managing to kill everything faster than me.  Was I doing something wrong there?  I was only Level 16 and botched a few (level 2) stim pack activations (i.e., turn on right after I die), burning all my medigel by Wave 9 because Collectors get to bodies so much faster than players on Condor.  And since everyone on the map was rolling Harriers I switched to my Hurricane/ULM sidearm a lot to avoid using up my ammo packs too fast.  In happier news... after a couple days of playing before what's likely a long layoff, the RNG gods smiled and granted me a PPR and BW in addition to the TGI.  PSPs/APs definitely seem to be paying off a lot more even though I haven't maxed rares, since I'm often getting 2 weapons/gears out of them instead of 1.  Can't wait to get back to playing!  [Edit] Oh, and thanks for the kind words everyone... definitely owe a lot to this community for teaching me how to play."

I bring equipment, which feels like it does nothing to help. I bring my best guns and characters and I still struggle to maintain even third place. I'm getting downed all the time even though I've learned to play a more careful, cover based game. And yet I still feel like I'm doing nothing to contribute to teams.  My most recent game was with a Volus adept who had a Particle Rifle X and maxed equipment to support it. I'm just getting back into the game after years of silence. But even my Black Widow I and Arc Pistol V feel like they do absolutely nothing to all of these maxed guns and gear.  Am I really doomed to be dead weight until I grind for gear of that caliber?"
MECoOp,36j6bc,crashsuit,1 point,Wed May 20 22:41:11 2015 UTC,"As a ""casual"" who can count on one hand the number of multiplayer computer/video games I've played, I can definitely sympathize -- especially when you're playing with people with maxed kits and tons of experience, it's tough to keep up.  Based on what others have said though, getting 80k points in a Gold and going down just a few times per match is both respectable and achievable, even if you come in last place.  Out of curiosity what types of builds/loadouts are you using?  I definitely struggled like you did until I finally realized that I'll never be a great sniper and learned to play CQC or power-based classes.  Finding setups that cater to your strengths is definitely a big help, even if you have level I URs or low-to-mid level rares.  I know it sometimes feels like the ""pros"" are able to go out there guns blazing without getting downed, but one thing I'm still trying to learn is how to play smart enough to keep my DPS up while using good movement and soft cover to stay alive.  Not sure what your ""cover-based game"" is but if you're taking hard cover a lot I'd actually recommend against it except in quick transition/recovery scenarios.  I'm still not good enough to average more than 3rd place in Gold, but sometimes you get a mediocre-but-serviceable team that lets you kill more stuff without jeopardizing the match, and if a bad player like me can top a scoreboard occasionally, I'm sure you can too!"
MECoOp,36j6bc,Earlkay,1 point,Wed May 20 23:29:29 2015 UTC,"My favorite classes are probably Sniper Quarian Infiltrator, (Black Widow) and a Sniper Quarian Marksman Soldier (Inthra) But I also have CQC preferences like an N7 Hurricane Asari Valkyrie and a casting-based Phoenix Vanguard. My N7 Demolisher's got a decent power build as well. It's really hard to think of what classes I really adore above the others though. Because I like most of them. And most of them don't seem to perform well with the way I use them either.  Though I try to play everything, I keep finding myself in shitty situations due to what may be lack of awareness or lack of knowledge as to what's been changed since I used to play before the Earth pack came out. It seems like you can no longer grab Geth Pyros over ledges. And it seems like the AI no longer camps ledges the way it used to. Because I used to be a grabbing monster way back when and am finding it absurdly difficult to do that now.  Also, not knowing what weapons are good and what weapons are so bad they shouldn't be touched sucks. Not to mention never knowing if my power builds are good or garbage. I'd love a list of good builds for each race or something like that, but I wouldn't know where to begin looking.  I can solo bronze pretty damn easily. I was in no way a casual back when I used to play this years back. But it feels like so much has changed. (Collector's suck) I can't seem to find my footing."

Grabbing is still easy on certain maps, like London or the LZ room in Glacier, but my problem is that people so often kill or stagger the enemies I'm trying to grab that I have a lot of trouble doing it.  Pyros are most definitely not grabbable anymore.  I think most weapons are still serviceable, there seems to be just a few like the Shuriken that shouldn't be touched.  Of course you probably know that already.  I guess you could try the Big Bad List of Builds in the sidebar or the BBLoB threads that people are reviving now?"

I felt like I wasn't doing much but managed to extract both times and apart from the odd idiot moment didn't go down all the time. Managed 90-100k in both matches but was way under the lead guys.  Since I felt that I wasn't doing much damage with my Turian Soldier with my gear not being massively good, in the second game I switched out to my Stagger/Crowd Control style. Went with the Falcon with Cryo Ammo and spammed Proximity Mine. It seemed to help a bit holding up the tides of Cerberus coming at us."

MECoOp,36j6bc,TylerZip,1 point,Thu May 21 10:11:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  I too got lucky with the Harrier and got it relatively early and also embarrassed myself with it the first couple times.  It's still more than serviceable though, especially if you have the stability passives and/or the proper consumable.  It definitely forces you to learn where all the ammo boxes are, and unless you're already using up lots of ammo packs for some reason, gets you pacing yourself through a match with them.  Incredibly rewarding once you've got that down."
MECoOp,36j6bc,Fyrjefe,1 point,Thu May 21 11:35:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the sheer DPS on bigger targets is amazing, and that at I. And it's not even that heavy... Running Stability and Damage on it right now, magazine and scope seem kind of pointless :)"
MECoOp,36j6bc,UberMcwinsauce,1 point,Thu May 21 11:51:24 2015 UTC,"First you complain about the lack of ammo and then you call the magazine mod useless?  The turian soldier already has lots of accuracy and stability boni especially with marksman active, I don't think the stability mod is necessary on the harrier at all. The Harrier has worse stability/accuracy when used from Hard cover so that's another reason to use softcover primarily instead.  The way armor piercing works (flat amount of damage is blocked per bullet) makes it kinda mandatory to use it on fast firing weapons, so use either some ammo with anti-armor capabilities like armor piercing, drill or warp and/or a weapon mod."
MECoOp,36hujx,El_Diablito,15,Tue May 19 14:28:40 2015 UTC,"I try not to judge as well because I used to do that before someone corrected me.  Bottom line is fight smarter, not harder.  Unless you want a challenge (which these guys clearly werent up to)."
MECoOp,36hujx,transam617,6,Tue May 19 15:02:41 2015 UTC,It was a shame.  These guys were solid for the whole match and held their own but even if you're juggernauts and krogans it's a hard fight if you're standing in extraction for 2 minutes.

MECoOp,36hujx,Pac-man94,2,Tue May 19 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"On Giant my friends and I tend to hang out in the building with the control room, across from the extraction point, then run across the lower area, head up the ladder, and sprint for the extract.

MECoOp,36hujx,Netfoolsmedia,1 point,Tue May 19 16:46:34 2015 UTC,That map is a dream for any mobile characters.  I noticed that most Platinum and Gold solos on Youtube are on this map.

MECoOp,36hujx,Shiboleth17,9,Tue May 19 15:17:20 2015 UTC,"Giant is one of the maps where you can camp extraction, because of how defensive the extraction zone is. But yeah pretty much any other map I would definitely not do that."

I can camp there on Plat all day with a decent group and never need a single thing.  That's why I do it, to stock up on junk.  Cuz if I plat anything else, especially PUGs, I'm generally using more consumables than I get from buying nothing but Arsenal Packs."
MECoOp,36hujx,Bloody_Lemon,2,Tue May 19 16:18:34 2015 UTC,"Most players don't play on Platinum, it is gold or lower now. I tried to do a platinum and the queue was ridiculous on what should be peak hours in the evening. Premade group required in your scenario. Not everyone plays characters that are effective at ranged damage. I play AIU with Claymore ( I don't have the N7 Crusader), so long range is no-go even with barrel. Many players still playing aren't maxed out with weapons/equipment. Almost every match I'm in has players still gearing up.   I don't doubt you can camp with a premade and save up your consumables, but that situation is an exception to the majority of matches."
MECoOp,36hujx,zhouster,3,Tue May 19 16:28:23 2015 UTC,"True Not really.  My IRL friends quit playing this game years ago, practically all of my games are PUG.  But with Platinum, you generally see the same characters being played in a lot of matches.  Hardly anyone brings characters like starting humans, quarians, salarians, or turians.  You mostly see N7s, Geth, and Asari, so a lot of PUG groups end up with plenty of good combinations anyway. Plus I will generally change my character to try to fit the group better if I can.  My favorite character to play is the Justicar, but if I see a a group with a lot of tech, I'll switch to a Paladin or Demolisher or something.  Or if I see a second Justicar, I'll swap to the other Asari Adept, making combos much easier.  Really you just need 1 or maybe 2 people in a group willing to switch like this and you can get some great synergy.  And since you're just camping on Giant, you're all killing the same enemies so powers are gonna mix and explode whether you're trying to do it or not. You don't need range to camp on Giant. True, but most of those players stay away from Platinum."
MECoOp,36hujx,Bloody_Lemon,9,Tue May 19 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"While I too mostly ignore people rushing to the extraction zone, consider the following:   Firebase Giant is well suited for holding up in the extraction zone. Mr Juggernaut is incredibly well suited for holding up in the extraction zone. Mr Juggernaut is incredibly slow and may have problems getting to the extraction. Warlords are melee fighters, they perform the best with team support (especially Hex Shield) and close quarters (both extraction zone approaches). Asari Justicar performs the best against bunch of enemies in close quarters and provides a great defensive buff for a team in a right location (and extraction zone is ideal).   I don't know about your teammates and whether they have considered this, but in this specific situation I would have joined the fight. You could have at least drawn the aggro from them (your resilience vs mobility ratio certainly allows this)."
MECoOp,36hujx,crashsuit,2,Tue May 19 16:10:03 2015 UTC,"IMO I don't think Giant is great for holding the extraction point. Unless you have someone inside the neighboring building to mess with the spawn, you can and most likely will be overwhelmed by endless respawns of boss-level enemies. I agree with the close-quarters positions, but a different point should've been the ""hold the line"" spot"
MECoOp,36hujx,Bloody_Lemon,3,Tue May 19 20:24:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say that Giant is basically the only good map to hold extraction. If there's a Jug holding the main entrance with Hex and 2 KroLords dishing out hammering, there is no difference how many bosses are out there. Drop one guy to occasionally nuke the left spawns and you are set.  There's a reason why Giant Platinum games are played near the extraction for all 10 waves (for ideal Jug/Paladin/flamer team or smth close)."
MECoOp,36hujx,zhouster,5,Tue May 19 23:16:35 2015 UTC,"Giant's EZ is okay, but (just in my personal opinion - I usually hate holding extraction) the only really well-fortified extraction zone is on Rio. If you can get everyone spread along the extraction end of the map before the enemies all spawn over there on wave 11, it's really defensible. There's decent cover, two close-by ammo boxes, and loooong sight lines on any approaching enemies. Then, at 10 seconds or so left, just waltz over to the glowing circle. Of course I'm not talking about crouching down just in the extraction zone, but along that whole end of the map - otherwise enemies will keep spawning pretty close by."
MECoOp,36hujx,cymikelee,2,Wed May 20 08:36:44 2015 UTC,"Define the difference ""well-fortified extraction zone"" and ""spread along the extraction end of the map"".  If you close up 2 door frames on Glacier and you'll get a good defense. White and London allow a wide-open killing zone for approaching enemies. Place 2 teams in the extraction and control room on the sandstorm map (sorry, brain failing, name is evading me) and you are set. Pretty much every map where you don't have enemies shooting at you from above (Vancouver and Ghost, looking at you) is well-fortified if you are cautious about team placement and mob directions.  On Giant you just plug two holes with tanky characters and press buttons."
MECoOp,36hujx,Potataro,2,Wed May 20 13:17:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should've clarified: I think Giant is a nightmare to hold extraction in PUGs because lack of coordination. With comms, it's easy for Juggs to tank sync-kill aggro while Warlords run train, but I'd rather hold a different position, especially against the Collectors."
MECoOp,36hujx,regack,1 point,Tue May 19 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah it definitely seems team-specific, if there were two Warlords it probably makes more sense to hold the control room due to the ramps for sync-kill immunity.  Otherwise with enough DPS the extraction zone should be defensible -- not sure how it would've gone if OP had stayed with the team, but I wouldn't question the decision to stay away if that's what made sense at the time."
MECoOp,36hujx,4cheese,2,Thu May 21 01:34:27 2015 UTC,"I think the best place to hold extraction (if you're with a Jug) is in that room you're talking about.  A Warlord can watch the ladder, and you can make small circles around the rubble to keep enemies moving.  Moving around is actually a big part of playing a Jug, from what I've seen.  I think a big problem was the team dynamic, though.  If you have a Jug and two Warlords, it can be tough to know who the bosses are after.  That means more wasting missiles when a Warlord gets picked up by a Banshee/Praetorian/etc. when they try to melee it.  It was their fault, not yours.  Your Justicar can't handle all the enemies surrounding her, even with the bubble.  The Jug should have moved around in circles, keeping bosses away from everyone, and the Warlords should have been beating up the little things.  Instead, they basically put all the pressure on a stationary Jug and were surprised when it couldn't handle that.  Some people aren't the most understanding.  Nobody really owes you a revive unless they pop an abomination on you so it's not like you owe them.  They should have respected that your character has limits, and holding LZ isn't part of that.  The Jug should also understand that extraction can be tough on a Jug."
MECoOp,36hujx,smileymcface,1 point,Wed May 20 00:49:52 2015 UTC,"Your points are completely valid but I kind of knew it was gonna be a shit storm when the 10th wave started and they all beelined straight to extraction.  Believe me I did what I could flanking the enemy, causing bio-explosions, launching missiles and also stripping Praetorian shields with my Acolyte but I knew it would be suicide to join in.  It was a PUG match and I wish my headset was nearby because I would have put the mic on and told them to get the hell out of there."
MECoOp,36hujx,Shiboleth17,2,Tue May 19 16:29:53 2015 UTC,"If they're going to burn through all the rest of their consumables on wave 11, they might as well have gone down after the objective on wave 10 and just collected the credits.  You'll spend more credits refilling 6 rockets/ops/gels than you'll get out of extraction.    Now, it's a judgement call if you think the team can hold the extraction point, and Giant really isn't that bad for it.  I suppose you could have tried to hold the line, and if it started to get dicey, you could have bolted, just like a hack.  But you didn't and that's fine.   Personally, I like making sure I survive to extraction, if they don't care enough to stay away from the zone, well... maybe they'll learn.  Anyway, don't feel too bad about it, tell yourself that you were the Wave 11 VIP that they needed to escort to the escape shuttle, and you got away safely... that's how I assuage my guilt :D"
MECoOp,36hujx,PlacidPlatypus,1 point,Tue May 19 20:24:43 2015 UTC,"Hehe, that's a good way to look at it but the only reason I felt bad is because we were having a good match and everyone was supportive to each other.

Yeah, this is basically easy mode if you want to farm Platinum for credits.  A Jugg in a Justicar Bubble should never die.  And on Gold on Giant especially, you should have no problem holding that position on the extraction wave, you definitely could have stayed.  On Plat run away maybe, but not on Gold.  Especially considering the Jugg cannot run so he really can't get too far away from the extraction to begin with.  However, nothing necessarily wrong with running away, and in the end, Idk what they were even complaining about... you got extracted, so everyone got the credit bonus.  Who cares if it's solo or full extraction, I'm pretty sure credit bonus is the same.  XP bonus is bigger for full, but A) who needs XP anyway?  and B) it's such a small amount that who cares."
MECoOp,36hujx,Shiboleth17,2,Tue May 19 16:22:23 2015 UTC,"you got extracted, so everyone got the credit bonus.   Pretty sure you only get the credit bonus if you personally extract. IIRC it's the only way for rewards to be unequal."

I was in a PUG match, no mics so not as easy to coordinate and plan.  I'm not really sweating it but hey, it was just a weird match that I wanted to rant about."
MECoOp,36hujx,AJockeysBallsack,2,Tue May 19 16:34:04 2015 UTC,"Put the Bubble wherever the Jugg needs to tank. Usually about in line with the edge of that first wall on the right, so the Jugg can stand behind the wall to block long range fire, and then only have to deal with enemies at close range.  Then I actually prefer the Jugg not use the Hex Shield.  That side wall on the right acts as your shield from long range rockets and stuff.  Juggs are near immortal at melee range so if you stop the long range, he shouldn't go down.  Why not use the Hex Shield?  Because it doesn't just block enemy bullets from hitting you.  It works both ways, blocking you and your teams bullets and powers from hitting the enemy.  This isn't good for a Justicar who needs to detonate something that just entered her Bubble, but cant hit it because the Jugg is standing in front of it (like he is supposed to) but put a Hex shield between you and the enemy (like he is NOT supposed to).  If the Jugg can effectively place Hex Shields so that they only protect himself and don't block key lines of sight to the enemy for the rest of his team, then go for it, but I've never seen any that can effectively do that.  Save using the shield for objective waves and emergencies.  Beyond that, it doesn't really matter what the other 2 characters are, as long as they can dish out some serious damage.  Preferably you want biotics, since they can work with the Justicar the best.  But the Justicar's Bubble puts a debuff on everything in it, so they take more damage from everything, tech, biotics, bullets, whatever, so it's in everyone's best interest that the Jugg draw a big crowd of enemies into the Bubble, where they can be annihilated pretty quickly.  Probably my favorites to combo with the Justicar are the regular Asari Adept (Stasis Bubbles inside the Justicar Bubble are super deadly, Warp is great to combo with Reave, since it can happen in any order, and Throw is a great quick spammable detonator), Human Adept (Warp again, Wide Singularities inside the Bubble are also super deadly, and Shockwaves can detonate multiple biotic explosions at once, cause BE's to do more damage, deal decent AOE damage by themselves, AND it is quick and spammable, just don't do this when people are sniping, they will get pissed, of course, no one should even attempt sniping in a game with at least 2 biotics anyway so I feel like it's their fault, lol), and the Krogan Shaman (Warp again, Shockwave again, combined with a lot of health and survivability.)  Tech can also mix well with this tho.  Flamers are deadly enough on their own.  Flamers hitting things in the Bubble are devastating."
MECoOp,36hujx,darzinth,1 point,Tue May 19 18:04:13 2015 UTC,I dream of having those matches where you have that great synergy but mostly I play with PUGs.  I added a few people from here but I've really only played with one or two of them.  There are some kits that when I see I will change my kit to accommodate but it's risky because you assume they will play their class as it was intended.  If I see at least two biotics I definitely change to a bio class myself and it's usually a boom fest.  If I see a Juggernaut I wouldn't really think Justicar but sometimes a Warlord or a Geth Trooper works really well with him.
MECoOp,36hujx,quietowlet,1 point,Tue May 19 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"After reading your post and being reminded about the Justicar and her damage reduction I re-spec'd her to the one in the college: [Asari Justicar 4.7 build](www.reddit.com/135rvh/)  Holy shit, you are right she is a monster.  I kept the reave field around me like it was tech armor and kept strategically moving the bubble for tons of bio-explosions.  I was playing a PUG again and there happened to be a Jugg and anywhere he drew aggro I put the bubble there upping his melee and support him with booms.  I'm lucky to have a pretty decent level Acolyte so the combination of that to strip shields, stun, pull and reave is too kick ass."
MECoOp,36hujx,vader540is,1 point,Thu May 21 15:01:34 2015 UTC,"I use something similar, but I don't max out Pull.  When you play on Gold/Plat, the only thing Pull is good for are Guardians, Husks, and Abominations.  Unarmored/unshielded troops are so rare, you don't use it very often.  However, Pull is still useful, so I leave Pull at rank 3, so I can max out Fitness, and be a even tankier, as well as get extra power damage from Justicar.  Although I guess if that +15% power damage is still bugged then go with Pull 4, I hadn't heard that until reading that link.  Regardless, with Pull at level 3, a Pull->Reave BE isn't quite strong enough to kill a Husk on Plat, but it doesn't matter, because Reave will still be damaging it after the BE, it will die before it can stand back up.  With Guardians, if you go for the Pull->Pull->Reave BE, you might have to shoot him after the BE, or stack another Reave on him to finish him off, but not a huge deal.  For that matter, you don't even have to get rid of their shield, since Reave hits through it.  Stack 3 Reaves on them and they should die eventually.  One of the better parts of playing the Justicar is when you are continuously Area Reaving an Atlas, and you get 4 or 5 kills on the random troops trapped behind the Atlas from all of them getting Reaved as well.  Altho I guess if you have no problems staying alive with Fitness only at 4, then don't fix what ain't broke."
MECoOp,36hujx,vader540is,1 point,Thu May 21 15:47:46 2015 UTC,"I played last night using the pull to target the few unarmored to set off booms.  Free damage to everything around them but yeah it does have limited uses with so much armor.  I had to switch from my Acolyte to my Hornet when Pyros were around.  Damn, I forgot the Reave stacks too... man, I've been playing this girl all wrong, haha.  As for the bio-explosion, isn't it affected by the level of the primer and detonator?  I thought I read that someone so thought that a level 6 pull and level 6 reave would have a more powerful explosion.  I agree that pull does have limited uses so just want to make sure before I consider spec'ing it over to fitness."
MECoOp,36hujx,sihtydaernacuoytihsy,2,Thu May 21 17:30:58 2015 UTC,"Like I said, if you are having no problems staying alive, then there's no need to get more Fitness.  There is nothing wrong with that spec.  It simply sacrifices a little bit a survivability to give yourself a little bit more dps.  I simply chose to go with a little more survivability, but the difference is pretty negligible either way I think.  Yes, the level of the two powers is what determines the damage of the BE, so your explosions with Pull would be weaker at level 3.  But it's not like you're using those explosions on Banshees and Atlas, you're only getting them off on enemies that are weak, where the weaker explosion is plenty strong enough to either kill, or kill close enough that Reave will finish it off in a second or 2 without you having to do anything else.  And on Gold/Plat, like 95% or more of your BEs are gonna come from Bubble->Reave or assists from other players.  And don't forget that you can throw the Bubble onto enemies to detonate a Reave, those 2 powers can be used in any order to get a BE...  The real beauty in playing the Justicar comes from the Reave->Bubble->Reave double combo...  Use Reave, which actually staggers a lot of enemies which is very nice, giving you time to run up close to it.  Eventually he will come to, but you also got your damage reduction from Reave, so you are probably not gonna die from doing this... Then use the Bubble, which will detonate the Reave, staggering the enemy again (another brief moment when he can't shoot you), while at the same time, priming the enemy for a second BE.  So while you are waiting for your CD, and while the enemy is staggering from the impact of the BE, you can use that time to run away, dodge, hide, and get off some shots with whatever weapon you're carrying... then simply Reave it again to get a second BE... so that's 2 BE's and you only had to use 3 powers to do it.  This is extremely deadly."
MECoOp,36hujx,sihtydaernacuoytihsy,1 point,Thu May 21 19:12:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is an awesome insight into her.  Great points on the pull only being useful in some situations since even a stronger BE from that is only effective in limited situations.  I might spec her for extra fitness.  You know I had the reave then bubble explosion a few times and I thought it was because the Fury had casted something but now that I know it's from my reave that's awesome... I have another tool to use with this extremely versatile character.  She's quickly becoming one of my favorite characters."
MECoOp,36g8gg,Potataro,2,Tue May 19 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"This Volus doesn't need protection. Your friends might want it, but it doesn't help your team if you’re dying. Once that 3 seconds are over and you don’t have shields regenerating, you generally won't have enough shields and health to survive Platinum damage even with the DR.   50% DR is equivalent to the bonus duration at 1120 or higher shields. If you have full shields after the initial three seconds of shield regen, and a cyclonic 2, the DR will outweigh the benefits of the duration bonus for you (and usually your teammates unless you are running with an unusually squishy team) while under fire.   In a scenario where you do not take full shield damage (assuming 1125 shields), rank 6a would leave you with a higher amount of shields, but your effective shields would still be lower and thus the point is kind of null."
MECoOp,36g8gg,Detenator,2,Tue May 19 05:14:12 2015 UTC,"It's not about max shields.  Don't get me wrong, max shields are very important in most situations, but the way I see it, Shield Boost is there for shield gate and health gate.  First, you have the invincibility period to regain both.  Then you have 4.5 more seconds to have something bring you to shield gate.  The great thing about Decoy is that fast-firing enemies (to take both shield and health gate) are attracted to Decoy, with the exception of Dragoons.  If you're hit by a Banshee warp after the Boost invincibility (so you have max shields), a Nemesis or Scion (Surprisingly you survive an Atlas shot with max fitness, cyc IV, and 50% DR by a mere 52 shields, though the Banshee warp will do 21 DPS after DR) can then 1-shot you to shield gate.  I should also mention those double-firing Rocket Troopers which are already enough of a pain for your Decoy.  Ravagers will also 2-shot you to shield-gate, but they fire quite a bit slower, and are more predictable.  Anyways, now the warp is eating through your health, the 3 second duration is over, and you're on cool down.  Unless you can heavy melee, you'll lose a bar of health every 2 seconds (21 dps, 248 max health: 49 health per bar).  Similar thing applies to Ravager goo and Atlas rocket DOT.  The former is obvious, but the later also staggers, so you physically can't Boost, melee, or ops pack.  Just rely on that Boost duration.  Using heavy melee while regaining shields also gives enough time to reset your various gates.  The Protection evolution is 10x better on the Adept, since its cool down is so great, but I prefer abusing the shield-gate and health-gate mechanics.  EDIT:  I derped on the Banshee math.  Sorry, I'm writing this tired."
MECoOp,36g8gg,Detenator,2,Tue May 19 06:13:45 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly you survive an Atlas shot with max fitness, cyc IV, and 50% DR by a mere 52 shields   Actually you won't because total DR is divided by 140, leaving you with only 35.7% DR in this case (you can either multiply your total DR by 71.4% or divide it by 140 to get your effective DR).  You will still survive a Banshee warp though, especially considering your DR will apply while the first three seconds of regen are ticking.  I see what you are going for against bosses, because they have a (relatively) slow rate of fire. However, mooks don't care about your shield gate. Cannibals, Centurions, etc will tear through that like paper. I think your opinion of the protection upgrade is a bit strong, either are viable in platinum in my opinion. Most platinum waves can have at least one type of mook with unlimited active at once, and in later waves enemies like Phantoms, Dragoons, and Pyros run rampant."
MECoOp,36g8gg,GundalfTheCamo,2,Tue May 19 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"total DR is divided by 140, leaving you with only 35.7% DR in this case   Huh, I honestly had no idea.  For the most part, this doesn't seem to change what enemies will 1-shot or 2-shot you to shield-gate, with the exception of the Atlas.   You will still survive a Banshee warp though   Of course. Perhaps I phrased it poorly.  I'm not worried about the initial hit (usually you can just shield boost before it hits and the initial impact will do 0 damage), I'm worried about the DOT.  If your shields go down and aren't recharging, the DR isn't enough to stop the DOT from killing you after shield-gate.  That's what I'm worried about.   mooks don't care about shield gate.   I mentioned this in my previous comment:   The great thing about Decoy is that fast-firing enemies (to take both shield and health gate) are attracted to Decoy, with the exception of Dragoons.   Geth turrets also have a tendency to ignore Decoy for some reason, but they are extremely predictable.  Geth Scanner is used so you can check flanking mooks.   I think your opinion of the protection upgrade is a bit strong, either are viable in platinum in my opinion.   Both are viable.  Heck, both are great.  Not sure why you think I don't like Protection.  There's no question I think it's better on the Adept and Engineer (my Vanguard only uses 3 ranks, but dang would that be amazing on it).  This Volus generally deals with slow-firing enemies and ignores the faster enemies like you said.  Remember, this build is meant to play slowly.  Enemies aren't going to be respawning 24/7.  Mostly the team is going to kill respawning bosses back and forth, and the mooks won't bother ya."
MECoOp,36g8gg,GundalfTheCamo,1 point,Tue May 19 20:52:31 2015 UTC,"I've used almost similar build on Gold, except I do keep both Drone and Decoy (66644).   Drone staggers small enemies of any variety and takes primes attention until destroyed. You can drop it behind enemies. I'd say it's more useful than decoy, but there's no great difference.   Particle Rifle X is really good, and Lancer is also nice if you keep both pets and need more cooldown."
MECoOp,36g8gg,ProtoKun7,1 point,Tue May 19 05:06:24 2015 UTC,"Small enemies and primes already focus on the Decoy after you cloak and move behind something.  Unless you take both durability bonuses, Drone cannot survive 1 shot from a Prime, Phantom, Hunter, or Rocket Trooper.  Most of the time I use it, the Drone dies before my cool down finishes.  Decoy survives 2 rockets, is immune to Phantoms, Primes, and Hunters.  Plus, because it cannot move, it's much more reliable imo.  Staggering those enemies is, as I said, not useful when they're already standing still staring at Decoy.  Dragoons and husks might stagger, which is nice, but only briefly.  I keep trying Combat Drone, but I find it keeps struggling to pull its weight compared to Decoy."

The big reason I still solo a lot these days is because I just really enjoy learning how far I can take a character in case I have to solo later waves due to inexperienced teammates.   Also I'm a big fan of difficult games, and soloing just fills that nice need for a good challenge every now and then."
MECoOp,36er8a,Reddit_isterrible,6,Mon May 18 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"Got the banner a month or two ago but haven't soloed since. My gold ones were AIU on Vancouver and N7 Fury on Giant, both against the Reapers, so pretty much easy mode. Still managed to bungle each of them up a couple times and get snatched up by a Banshee. Overall I actually found my Fury run to be much easier. But then I had the Raider on my AIU so killing Banshees was a lot more stressful than it should've been cause I had to get so damn close.  It's an interesting challenge, and I might try another run sometime. Probably won't make an attempt at Platinum though. Takes a lot of patience, particularly for your first ones. My Fury one I think was 45 minutes and the AIU took me over an hour, although part of that is because Vancouver is such a huge map. It's also good practice for when all your teammates go down and you're left alone on an objective wave. I used to be garbage in those situations but now I'm a lot more confident about it, even with my less-confident characters.  edit: Woo! Just soloed Gold/Geth/White with my Volus Mercenary Sentinel! Took me exactly one hour to do it. Only had to use two medi-gels. Decoy and Combat Drone are ridiculous against the Geth."

MECoOp,36er8a,King_Pumpernickel,5,Tue May 19 01:22:22 2015 UTC,"Want a hint? Keep moving in a steady pattern. Spawn points are based on where you're at on the map. Kill folks where you are, and they spawn in the 2 pre-defined spawn points nearest you. So if you try to stay put and kill everything you see, everything just keeps respawning close to you until you get dead. Just run away/move away from there and you'll stay alive longer."
MECoOp,36er8a,smileymcface,2,Tue May 19 14:48:29 2015 UTC,"I've done a grand total of one solo, with an Asari Valkyrie on Bronze/Giant/Reapers.  Had to do two 4x deactivates and an escort but I kind of cheated though, I missiled the one Banshee I had to kill, even though I could probably have done it fine on one of the ramps (I've soloed Banshees on Gold before with the Valk, just need to learn to keep my nerves steady when I'm soloing).  As /u/smileymcface said, steady movement definitely does the trick, especially on Bronze which is pretty forgiving.  People seem to say that circular maps like Giant and Vancouver are easiest, Reactor is okay too but easier to get stuck on things.  Then you can basically just circle around and let enemies clump together so you can kill at your own pace using RHA where possible."

MECoOp,36er8a,BlodhgarmDethahal,3,Tue May 19 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"I like to play solo. It is the wholly different kind of game than the regular matches. You are more focused on the battlefield, you are on your own. No one will revive you, no one will help you. After a solo I feel relaxed in a regular game.  And, besides achievements and challenge itself, soloing teaches a player how to finish a wave when all his teammates are down. One time I was playing on Gold with a friend of mine, who haven't played any solo games. In a 8th wave he was the only one who was not killed, and to complete the wave he had to use more than half of his expandables (Cobras, medi-gels, ops...). The next wave the situation was opposite: all died, I remained. And, with all the experience in solo, I had completed the 9th wave without using any expandables, despite the fact I was playing that character for the first time.  After that, I think that any player must have an experience in solo playing - for a capability to prevail in that kind of situations. It is like using expandables for tough matches and not playing golds at 1st level if one don't capable of playing good."

The warp armor reduction is applied multiplicatively to whatever armor isn't ignored by your piercing mods and ammo (50 points armor DR -> piercing mod ignores 50% of armor -> 25 points of DR -> warp reduces armor DR by 50% -> 12.5 points of armor damage reduction).  Weapons (like the Collector SMG and Krysae) that receive bonus damage to armor are a completely different can of worms because this is a percentage of the weapon's base damage that is added for the total damage dealt to armor before the armor's damage reduction comes in.

MECoOp,369t53,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Mon May 18 14:46:43 2015 UTC,"Right - nothing to do with armor reduction. Just doing the PSA because in the kalence link you posted, it has 5A in warp, which is widely considered an inferior choice to 5B."
MECoOp,369t53,smedes,1 point,Mon May 18 18:04:36 2015 UTC,"ya, that was just to make the effects of armor reduction easier to see without the 15% damage increase getting in the way."
MECoOp,369t53,Scarecrow1779,2,Mon May 18 18:08:44 2015 UTC,"(Correct me if I'm wrong, my mechanical knowledge has gotten a little hazy after time)   Armor reduces the weapon damage you deal by a set amount, and armor piercing decreases this value. 0% AP would mean that you lose 50 damage per pellet (IIRC), 50% would mean that you lose 25 damage, and so on. Once you hit 100%, it's like the armor isn't there, and you'll be doing full damage. Any extra piercing is mostly useful for shooting through solid materials, with enough piercing and Geth Scanner/Hunter Vision, you can shoot through a lot of physical objects."
MECoOp,369t53,Knocking,4,Sun May 17 16:50:20 2015 UTC,I find it funny just how much you can go through with the right Javelin setup.
MECoOp,369t53,ProtoKun7,3,Mon May 18 07:17:38 2015 UTC,Drill rounds + Geth scanner + Javelin with both piercing mods = wallhacks for days
MECoOp,369t53,Salsadips,4,Mon May 18 22:07:39 2015 UTC,"Piercing is ignoring/damaging armor. Warp rounds, biotics, mods.   Penetration is shooting through shit.  You're talking about penetration at the end.   A Javelin with stock AP mod and DLC heavy barrel loaded with Drill 3 ammo is gonna pierce well, and penetrate a retarded amount of cover.  Not even cover, really.  Just...everything."
MECoOp,369b96,Alcoholic_Aardvark,4,Sun May 17 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"Burning damage doesn't extend the detonation window, but the DoT is more valuable to me than recharge speed. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the detonation window for fire explosions is 3 seconds. You can always take weight capacity in alliance training, but I find that that you can comfortably detonate FEs with a cooldown of up to around 2.81 seconds on Incinerate (around 160% power recharge). Also keep in mind your Incinerate cooldown starts once you activate it, and it's a projectile power, so technically you would have a bit more leeway given the travel time to hitting the enemy. Overload is hitscan so it'll hit as soon as you trigger the power. If you're having issues detonating or are carrying a heavy weapon pushing past the FE detonation window, you could always just use Incendiary Ammo to prime and detonate with Overload. Granted that will only give you a 1+6 explosion as opposed to a fully spec'd Incinerate/Overload 6+6 exposion, but it's still good to have. Although if that's the case, you might be better off using the Geth Engineer."
MECoOp,369b96,protomahn,1 point,Sun May 17 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"I can comfortably and consistently det FEs if that's all I have to focus on, but when I Gold, I roll around all over the place so I don't die, which means I have to time the prime and the det perfectly, and that's if I don't have to slap/shoot anything while I'm doing it.  I am familiar with the mechanics of the powers and the logistics of buying more time to det by priming targets further away. All I needed to know was if Burning Damage would help me feed my FE addiction."
MECoOp,369b96,Scarecrow1779,3,Sun May 17 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"no, the 8 seconds of burn damage is not detonatable. you still only have the standard 4 or so second window to detonate."

With decoy you can hold the hard-hitting heavy weapons and not worry about being hit/using shield boost.

MECoOp,366ftc,CptSxePants,10,Sat May 16 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"I use my Destroyer with a Particle Rifle so I don't spec multinades at all. Great for ramp up weapons and mid range combat. Limited crowd control if you pick the stronger, single-target evo of the two. You can probably take 3 or 4 small enemies at a time with the multi target evo.  I like it. It's a turn on and forget power like Devastator Mode and it'll stagger smaller enemies if you pick the Hydra evo (multiple, smaller missiles). Pretty handy for clutch revives since it'll fire when you lock on someone for a revive. Not sure if that's an intentional game mechanic, but it's prevented many stomps in gold/plat.  So for ramp up weapons, grenade-needy teammates, or lazy fighting, it's great. If specced for multiple enemies, it's not so much about killing enemies outright as it is about staggering, chipping, and being Iron Man."

MECoOp,366ftc,ginja_ninja,6,Sat May 16 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"I've been playing particlehawk destroyer for years and feel I've got it pretty much 100% optimal by now. With a maxed manifest it's easily one of the best classes in the game. Here's what my build looks like.  Armor-piercing is essential. AP ammo IV gives you 90% piercing in addition to bonus damage, but the most important part is that it allows you to equip extended barrel, which adds an additional 25% damage. If you don't have a ton of AP ammo IV to use every game, you'll have to swap out extended barrel for HV barrel to get your piercing (or just regular piercing mod if you don't have HV barrel either), and you'll lose out on some damage.  But the real beautiful thing about hawk missiles is that they continue to shoot while your particle rifle is firing. It's very important to fire the PPR in one continuous stream for as long as you can (without burning it down all the way and triggering the overheat), and hawk missiles are awesome for this because they'll constantly be tracking the enemies you're aiming at, either staggering them or forcing them to roll in a predictable direction. This makes lining up headshots way easier, meaning it takes less time to kill each enemy, meaning you can kill more enemies before you need to stop and let it recharge. I can pretty easily clear a spawn of 4-5 troopers or more in a single clip.  Also hawk missiles are fucking kryptonite to phantoms. If they're at range, as soon as your missile fires she'll immediately stop whatever she was doing and do her bubble move. This means that she's no longer moving around and she's not pumping out her massive palm cannon damage, she's just sitting nice and still for you to melt her face. It seriously trivializes arguably the most dangerous enemy in the game. Just be wary that if you're hosting, phantoms like to flip nonstop when the host is shooting at them, getting damage reduction and making them very difficult for any weapon-damage-based class to kill.  I like the executioner as a sidearm because you can get 2 shots per clip with it. There are other popular secondary guns that work well, most notably the piranha, but none have quite as much style as the executioner. It becomes vastly better with 2 shots as shield gate stops being an issue. With targeting VI gear its headshots do insane damage vs. bosses (check the stats, motherfucking 6000+ damage vs. armor). Nothing better than finishing off a banshee with it, it's really the perfect gun to quickly bust out after your PPR burns down, pop off 2 shots with, then switch back to your death laser (it will recharge in the background as long as you didn't burn it all the way to 0). Also the final great thing about it is that you can snipe with it from ultra-long range, as the PPR does have a max range limit (about the distance from the LZ area of Giant to the top of the ramp at the other side across the upper area), so you can pick off very distant enemies with it in certain situations."
MECoOp,366ftc,ProtoKun7,2,Sun May 17 08:24:38 2015 UTC,"I use the same build with the exception of Max Shields at rank 6; I should probably try the damage bonus and see how it handles.  I also use the heavy barrel on the PPR and vary my secondary; sometimes Crusader, Black Widow or Javelin."
MECoOp,366ftc,ginja_ninja,2,Sun May 17 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah when you're loaded up with cyclonic IV you've pretty much got all the shields you need so it's nice to get more damage instead. Another nice thing about not using accuracy-based weapons is that you can use devmode to buff shield recharge delay, so between that and fitness they regenerate significantly quicker than the average class and you end up as probably the best combo of tankiness, range, mobility, and damage output in the entire game.  Just remember that unlike sniper rifles or shotguns, the assault rifle HV barrel doesn't boost your actual damage, so if you have AP ammo in abundance the loadout in my build is preferable. You can kill pretty much every boss in a single clip or at least put them in range to finish with the executioner. If you're low on AP ammo though warp ammo with the HV barrel is a viable alternative, that's mostly what I used for a while until I'd maxed my manifest and started getting level IV consumables en masse."
MECoOp,366ftc,ProtoKun7,1 point,Sun May 17 21:02:54 2015 UTC,I tended to use the heavy barrel for piercing; I do use the extended barrel sometimes though. I'm not hurting for AP ammo.

You aren't leeching grenades off teammates that need them for their own build to be effective and you definitely want 6 in the battlesuit passive for the extra weapon damage."
MECoOp,366ftc,Krags,5,Sat May 16 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"Same here, except I like the Typhoon with that set-up. You need a solid close range weapon to offset the lack of a panic button, and I find the Claymore to be the perfect candidate."

Get ""Refire Time"" and ""Hydra Missles"" and once you pop Devastator Mode and your Stryker starts ramping up, things explode. After a melee Krogan build it's probably the best build to let off some steam and wreak havoc on the map.  It's a lot of fun but there are a few drawbacks. You'll likely be hogging the ammo crates and it's adviseable to stay at mid/long range. You won't be very durable if you're dancing the waltz with a Brute."

Can't be staggered or disrupted, so I just march towards something with a preposterous amount of ammo being pissed out of the Lancer while I fire Hydra rockets at targets for a near-guaranteed stagger on elites and lower.

Go for the penalty mitigation at rank 4 and Hydra at rank 6 and it'll stagger, giving your Particle Rifle time to finish it off.  It's great for Phantoms because the missiles will trigger their shields, meaning they'll stay still and be an easy target, and if it doesn't trigger the shield, they'll take damage from the shots anyway.

While for sure some characters are at face-value more powerful than others, it really boils down to how you play as a player.  Some characters are more popular, some ""clutch"" (very forgiving and give second chances), and some are only great in the hands of experts who make them ""look easy"".

Just to reassure what everyone else is saying, though, the Harrier is fantastic, especially with Marksman.  Also, because you get so much bonus headshot damage, you might get a relatively high number of headshot kills just because those do so much damage.  No hacks, just lots and lots of ammo.  Also, in terms of bugs/glitches, is there any chance your Medi-Gel decided to kick in a minute or so too late?  Very rarely that can happen to make you go from dead to alive after a long time, and may look like hacking.

Any time there is a shield buff that adds durability at the cost of cooldown penalty and there is only one power subject to cooldown, it makes sense to ditch either the buff or the cooldown power.    The only time this can be a problem is when playing Gold and above with squadmates who also use grenades, because you can easily get one-dimensional.  The flip side is that soloing gold is great because you're are super-durable and nobody else is raiding the ammo boxes.  Going with the Crusader is an interesting choice.  Since you have no cooldown to worry about, I prefer the Reeger and powerful sniper rifle with this build, along with shotgun amp, cyclonic, fire ammo, and shield buffs.

MECoOp,35tsf6,cervesista,2,Wed May 13 23:19:59 2015 UTC,"I used to rock this build back in my I'm-not-confident-enough-to-play-Gold days. I remember having difficulty with Gold when I did bring this kit in the days I was more comfortable with Gold.  I have yet to find a comfy build for Gold with this kit, but I think I might end up with something along the lines of this one, but I'm not sure - I mean, I FEEL like I should incorporate Incinerate when using the Krentinel but it feels underwhelming sometimes unless I go for a power-based build, like a 5/6/6/5/4 or something."
MECoOp,35tsf6,cervesista,2,Thu May 14 05:58:02 2015 UTC,"I use 5/6/6/5/4 on my Krogan Soldier and slap a harrier on him and he is amazing. you get fire explosions from incendiary grenades and carnage, plus both do high armor damage. the harrier also synergizes well with grenade classes since you'll be running to get grenades anyway, so ammo isn't an issue. the mattock works extremely well on him too. The problem with the KroSent is the lack of synergy between the two powers. It's very difficult to set of combos with the Lift Grenade, because yin order for the grenade to detonate a combo, the target has to already be down to nothing but health (doesn't work on armor either), and then get hit with the lift grenade. Needless to say, most things that are down to health die from a lift grenade.  I've always wanted Tech Armor to detonate fire explosions when you set it off. That would make for an amazing power/melee build for the KroSent because you would carry a pistol (maybe the Executioner?) with a melee stunner and a power magnifier, and spec to completely skip lift grenades (or just put 3 points in them and skip rank 6 of the passive). You would play by Incenerating a target, running in, meleeing them, then setting off your tech armor, which would set off a fire explosion. That's the power class I've always wanted for the KroSent."
MECoOp,35tsf6,cervesista,2,Thu May 14 08:49:55 2015 UTC,"There are a number of ways you/I/anyone can roll the Kroldier as long as it's X/6/6/X/X. The 'nades and Carnage really work well together.  Which is why the Krentinel is a mystery to me. Unless you go build it the way it's suggested in the thread, which I've done, and it's okay, but yeah, I wish there were more.  Judging from your discussion, it seems like there isn't much since Incinerate doesn't synergize with Lift 'nades. I guess if I were to be stubborn about Incinerate (which I have NOT used in a Krentinel build, to be clear), it would be best used as a detonator for Incendiary ammo? That's about as useful as I can see it being, apart from being useful on armor, but a nice heavy weapon (like a Claymore) can perform the same function w/o the cooldown concern."
MECoOp,35tsf6,cervesista,2,Thu May 14 09:14:16 2015 UTC,"ya, that's pretty much my thoughts too. in straight up damage, powers have a hard time keeping up with guns unless there's the added damage of combos. The obvious exceptions to this are things like Cloak -> Dark Channel or powers that deal lots of area damage like Flamer or grenades."
MECoOp,35tsf6,cervesista,2,Thu May 14 09:23:56 2015 UTC,"True. I think I'm being stubborn about it because of the Turian Sentinel build that's 5/5/6/6/4 (with class passives for weapon damage). Overload to de-shield, Warp to debuff bosses, shoot, repeat. I'm trying to approach the Krentinel in a similar manner but I'm stumped. :p"
MECoOp,35tsf6,natlouwet,2,Thu May 14 10:06:47 2015 UTC,"well, you could go for tech armor for anti shields, lift grenades for anti-barriers, incinerate for anti armor and a weapon for taking out health. you'd end up with something like this. It would be a CQC class and would be silver viable, but you'd be hard pressed to make it work on gold."
MECoOp,35tsf6,natlouwet,1 point,Thu May 14 10:21:46 2015 UTC,"This might be the first 5/6/5/5/5 build I've ever seen. Haha! Yeah, the mystery of the Gold Krentinel. Sigh. I shall crack it one day!"
MECoOp,35tsf6,natlouwet,1 point,Thu May 14 10:30:37 2015 UTC,"I am convinced that the KroSent is just one of those classes that only reaches max efficiency when you max your UR weapons. as for the build, you said you wanted an all around build"
MECoOp,35tsf6,natlouwet,2,Thu May 14 10:46:43 2015 UTC,"And you made one and it's great (within the context of what you said, CQC for Silver); I just never saw a build with those numbers, is what I'm saying. :)"
MECoOp,35tsf6,natlouwet,2,Thu May 14 10:52:24 2015 UTC,"ya, usually people avoid that because the last rank for powers is awesome. you could definitely make the case for changing lift grenades to 6 and dropping the rank in fitness so it'd be a 5/6/6/5/4 build, but if we were going for a moderately CQC build, i thought the shield recharge would be beneficial. you don't really need the extra protection from tech armor since you'll be detonating it and have some ranged abilities, and you don't need the last rank in the passive for weapon damage because weapons have been relegates to supplemental damage and dealing with enemies that just have health left.  n i knew you were laughing at the unconventional point distribution, and i was just pointing out that if you take the idea of an all around build too literally, you end up with that. i thought it was funny too."

MECoOp,35sudf,JamFlash,4,Wed May 13 05:36:00 2015 UTC,"It's an additive 12% damage bonus from the sniper rifle component. TC does not get a damage bonus from power strength modules, ever. Also note that it's additive.   I believe I'm correct on this but the 25% sniper bonus on Rank 6 TC is multiplicative of all the bonuses prior. So there's that, at least."
MECoOp,35sudf,RepublicanShredder,4,Wed May 13 05:45:58 2015 UTC,You are correct. All gear and consumable weapon bonuses are addative
MECoOp,35sudf,Salsadips,4,Wed May 13 07:54:10 2015 UTC,"Testing with Kalence using this build:   Without cloak active, with no gear, Mantis deals 739 damage. With cloak active, with no gear, Mantis deals 1034 damage. Without cloak active, with Guerrilla Upgrade, Mantis deals 827 damage. With cloak active, with Guerrilla Upgrade, Mantis deals 1123 damage. Without cloak active, with Operative Package, Mantis deals 827 damage. With cloak active, with Operative Package, Mantis deals 1123 damage.   According to the kalence class builder, the tech portion of Operative Package has no effect on cloaked weapon damage, and cloak does not multiply the damage bonus you get from your gear by 40 or 80%.  Repeating with Nardia to confirm using the same build:   No cloak, no gear: 738.7 Cloak, no gear: 1034.18 No cloak, Guerrilla Upgrade: 827.34 Cloak, Guerrilla Upgrade: 1122.82 No cloak, Operative Package: 827.34 Cloak, Operative Package: 1122.82   Nardia gives the same results as Kalence. Operative Package does not effect the damage boost from cloak, and cloak does not multiply the bonus you get from gear."
MECoOp,35pvtw,CptSxePants,33,Tue May 12 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes.  A great deal in fact.  You may not see the difference from level to level, but a 3 or 4 level leap makes a big difference, particularly in weight.    Powerful guns that you would never use with caster class because of heavy weight at level I, for example, can give you a 190% cooldown at level X.   Another big advantage to the weight reduction is that you can spec for damage instead of the weight bonus many characters get at passive lvl 6.    I have seen guys play with Hurricanes and Harriers at level X, and the damage output is unreal."

So instead of warming up on silver, I jumped straight into a public gold match cuz I'm just so good.  Things that went wrong from here: First thing was that the enemy type was Collector. Collector on gold is my nightmare fuel, especially with an adept...  Second thing was not warming up, which inevitably led to me going down twice on wave 1 within the first two minutes of the match. By wave 8 I was out of medigel and ops packs. Third thing was that this was the London map, which meant big open areas, aka more opportunities for the enemy to shoot at me, which led me to going down. A lot.  I felt bad for my team having to carry my sorry ass through that match, but at least I got 2nd place with points. That's all that matters right? ... Guys?"

MECoOp,35m3is,SpiralofChaos,8,Mon May 18 06:21:03 2015 UTC,"Was on Reapers/Giant/Gold with a host (pug#1) who seemed decent, and two others who were just above dead weight (they didn't die constantly at least) but did next to nothing (mid-20k score at the start of wave 7). Midway through, #1 gets on the mic and starts complaining that he doesn't understand how he isn't outscoring me when (by his estimate) he has more kills. IIRC he was a Destroyer and I was a Paladin. I didn't respond and I don't have a mic anyway. In retrospect this was a clear warning sign of what was about to occur.  In games like these, when I have one other seemingly-dependable pug and two others who aren't dying but also aren't doing any work offensively, I like to rocket an initial spawn on waves 7-9 since it makes the game go by faster, I don't feel as if I'll need the rockets (Reapers/Giant not being an especially difficult combo), and quite frankly matches are not that fun when they drag out like this and you have to do all the work.   I do this at the start of wave 7, managing to get a killstreak. Great, that's a minute or two saved hopefully. Pug #1 immediately gets on the mic and starts bitching ""SERIOUSLY?!? YOU'RE ALREADY IN FIRST PLACE"". Ok guy, I don't give a fuck about the score, I just want this damn match to be over faster. I considered the possibility he just didn't know about nuking spawns IRT shortening the game, reducing the wave budget etc. This guy had a mid-6000s N7 or some such, so who the hell knows. A few seconds later, he starts  shooting off missiles of his own, as if to spite me.  I missile another spawn at the start of 8. Before the enemies have even completed their death animation, he ragequits.  Disappointingly though I did not receive any XBL hatemail."

Granted, my mic is set on PTT, but I can never be too sure if I accidentally push my talk button while I'm monologuing about how bad my teammates are, the instant they go down.

MECoOp,35m3is,cervesista,2,Thu May 14 04:17:18 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, on target waves on gold and lower, if you kill the target and another lower point value unit at the same time, usually with a cobra missile (because that's the easiest, most reliable way), it's possible that the subsequent targets on the same wave will switch to the (easier to kill) lower point value unit. They usually have to be specific units, but it can make target waves significantly easier and quicker. On platinum it's impossible, with two specific exceptions. http://forum.bioware.com/topic/479555-assassination-objective-how-to-change-your-2nd-target-to-something-weak/ I thought this was more general knowledge but maybe not.

Tried a Wraith and missed so badly the first couple waves, it was the last game I rage-quitted.  Recently went back and tried it and figured things out -- going for body shots (or headshots on Graal/Crusader) when zoomed, or taking that extra second or so to line up the crosshair when firing from the hip.  Shotguns are amazing, I've heard them as ""broken"" in this game for how powerful they can be, and they synergize really well with caster classes for getting shots off between skill uses.  I basically trained myself on the more forgiving Disciple and Piranha (w/smart choke) before moving on to other shotties, so you could try that."
MECoOp,35m3is,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Tue May 12 20:13:42 2015 UTC,"I've heard them as ""broken"" in this game for how powerful they can be   Well that's probably because the only defense that can actually penalize low pellet damage weapons (referring to armor damage reduction) can be nuetered with several types of mods and ammo along with a handful of skills. Not to mention most shotguns are pretty lightweight save for the Claymore and Crusader.  The inverse (shield-gating for high damage weapons like the Javelin) doesn't really hold so well imo because of the breakpoints with anti-shield ammo along with the fact most powerful sniper rifles are pretty heavy and those that aren't heavy either don't hit hard enough without anti-shield powers (Valiant, sorta) or have some terrible ergonomics (Kishock projectile speed, Krysae slow RoF). That and the shieldgate penalty is much more severe than armor damage reduction imo."
MECoOp,35m3is,RepublicanShredder,1 point,Tue May 12 21:52:03 2015 UTC,"This is all pretty true. I was doing extremely well with Adepts and the Scimitar, since it's light and packs a relatively decent punch without punishing cooldown. With the Fury I'd blink in, fire off some rounds between some trigger set ups and clean up with throw. I recently switched to SMGs like the hornet, but still have a place in my heart for a nice uncommon shotgun to accompany my loadout. Still working on getting the gold ones V +."
MECoOp,35m3is,Scarecrow1779,2,Sat May 16 03:50:43 2015 UTC,"just came out of the dumbest silver ever. played this build just for giggles. It's not a build I expect to do well with. It's a build I developed for playing with some friends that I usually outscore by quite a bit, so that they can get more of the action. It's not supposed to be good. That being said, I can usually pull my weight just fine so long as I keep it in silver and below and even make top score probably 1 out of 4 silver matches.  I should have known something was wrong when the only person other than me to equip any gear scored ZERO points during the first round (Geth Juggernaut carrying a Black Widow I). One guy (Turian Sentinel) had an N7 level of almost 70 and had no attachments on either gun. By the end of wave 4, the Turian had left the game, the Jug had continued to be utterly useless (even ignoring all objectives), and the last member of our team (Krogan Soldier) had used all of his medigel and rockets. We wiped during wave 8 after I used half my medigel and ops packs trying to revive my teammates. The Jug never once used any consumables and was  unable to tank even a single brute. Throughout the whole game I was consistently doubling the scores of everyone else in the lobby.... with a class that is supposed to be horrible. sigh......"

I picked the Mantis precisely because I don't like it and think it's terrible.  I was considering reworking the build after that horrible round to have the only limitation being that it's a charge-less human vanguard. It'd be something like this. I'd probably end up playing it about the same way as my current build, but it would have more weapon damage, faster reload (I think), Much more damage from nova (sorely needed), shorter cooldown on shockwave, and roughly the same damage from shockwave, but with the radius evolution."

It might not be a particularly effective combo, but it is fun overloading mooks to the ground and then blowing them to pieces.

MECoOp,35m3is,TylerZip,1 point,Mon May 11 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"IMO, though I don't slap the Harrier to everything, it's pretty hard to beat the Harrier. There are only a handful of Weapons that can match/outdo it. Characters, on the other hand, there's more you can do with those, especially if you haven't unlocked many. The downside though is if you ""level"" the characters you already have, as the benefit is only aesthetic (as compared to improving weapons). I generally left it up to the PSP to give me whatever until I unlocked all characters, then I switched to APs.  In retrospect, APs may not be a bad approach (because the progress of unlocking higher level Rares is SO MUCH MORE REWARDING than higher ""level"" characters), but I really wanted to unlock all characters before doing those, so, that's what I did."

MECoOp,35m3is,HeaVenwiLLbUrN,1 point,Tue May 12 22:06:11 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the imbalance kinda came from playing with it in a non-standard war. Charged weapons can be double tapped to its max firing rate by holding a charge, then releasing the charge, and THEN tapping again to get 2 shots in a blink of an eye. The old Krysae had a decent firing rate and charge time (zooming scope feature) that allowed for three shots to be fired within about a 2 second time frame. Combine that with a GI (improved RoF, Proxy Mine debuff, TC damage buff, TC pre-nerf damage buff) and it was pretty trivial to get killstreaks off the dang thing. I doubt testers would have minmaxed the gun that way.   Plus power creep can be a real problem in games that update all the time. See Payday 2, Warframe (severely), probably DACoOp, WoW, MOBAs, etc. I'd bet it was mostly a power creep thing as to why it wasn't nerfed before release. Kind of a crappy problem that I've only see Payday 2 quasi-solve with niche scenarios for certain guns.   That entire DLC was a whole host of power creep into the next galaxy with Quarian Males, Vorcha, Grenade Capacity gear, Krysae, Reegar, and Harrier."

Other than that, just pick the class you're most comfortable with. The biggest thing that helps power classes is AoE armor damage, because of all the bosses. Also, never go into a Plat game without at least 2 of your 3 consumable slots filled (unless your team has a plan and you know you can get away with it)."
MECoOp,35mman,Scarecrow1779,3,Mon May 11 19:28:27 2015 UTC,"A good Jugg who actually knows how to tank and control enemy movement is rare on Platinum, and is a great asset to any team.  Demolisher with Homing Grenades is nice for armor damage and weakening armor. You are going to be moving around and repositioning a lot on Platinum unless you have a Jugg in front of you at all times, as a result your Supply Pylon is of minimal use unless you can always get back to it for Grenades. Now if you do have a Jugg, I just use it for +50% shields and place it at the Jugg's fit and sit in the back and blast away with a Particle Rifle (Glacier is a good map to do that with, but you generally need a team to do it, otherwise people just run all over the map and do their own thing).  So if you want to use the Demolisher on PUG Platinum, I recomend going with Turian Sabatour or Drell Assassin Infiltrator if you want to keep Homing Grenades, as that way you pick up (in my opinion) more useful powers."

MECoOp,35hh8w,KnorrSoup,5,Sun May 10 12:20:21 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I noticed that the default FoV is very narrow, and I downloaded a program to fix that. However, my UI and main menu is now very small, is there a way to fix this?   I'm guessing you did something like described in this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/17rre6/pc_tweak_guide_how_to_dismantle_your_omnikey/  I actually just downloaded and used one of the bin files there (specifically the Three Key + FOV Fix file). It's pretty handy as it splits your omnikey into separate sprint, dodge, and action/interaction buttons. I don't remember if I changed keybinds after pasting this file in, but I have sprint on Shift, dodge on Spacebar, and use item on E. Makes the game feel smoother and more like other shooters, and also makes running the pizza objective really easy.  I don't think using this bin file made my UI and menu smaller, but it's been such a long time since I changed it I honestly don't remember.   Secondly, I notice when I am in lobbies that some players have artistic banners. How do they get these?   http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_3_Multiplayer/Challenges  You can check your progress on your N7HQ profile: http://social.bioware.com/n7hq/   I also notice that in about half the games I play, I get ""Communicating"" in the top left corner before getting disconnected. My internet is fine and I can hop into another game straight after, but it's very annoying to have it happen so frequently, and be left with no reward for my efforts. I have had problems with EA servers in general before (particularly BF3), though I have not been able to find any fix for it.  Lastly, for the games that I do manage to play, I notice that sometimes my character will lag and kind of keep jumping forward and backward. This can usually be solved by me taking cover, but is this also a common problem?   Seems like you're getting paired with bad or very distant hosts (I see you're an Australia player). Basically one player in each lobby ends up being the host. I'd suggest maybe hosting lobbies yourself. You usually do this by creating a new public lobby and waiting for people to join, but it can also happen if the current host leaves the lobby and the game assigns host to you.  The game experience is noticeably better when you're host, especially for classes with high mobility that are susceptible to rubber banding like Vanguards, or also if you're using projectile weapons instead of hitscan ones (e.g. Kishock, Graal, Acolyte). One of my biggest gripes with the game. The net coding is just awful.  I don't always play ME3, but when I do, I play as host. Just makes your experience so much smoother and enjoyable.  Glad to hear you're having a blast. There's a bunch of stuff that simply makes the PC experience easier to deal with."

MECoOp,35gjs6,JushtFinisht,4,Sun May 10 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"The most important thing should be if your character gels with the lobby. Sometimes you can get away with rolling a biotic class on an otherwise tech team, if you self-detonate, but it's usually a better idea to find something that'll compliment the other builds... unless they're not trying to do that either, in which case do what you want, I guess. For example, occasionally if I see a class with Flamer, I'll roll a class with Overload so I can set off fire explosions for them. Detonating other people's primers is usually as simple as sticking close to them (just never count on PUGs detonating your primers), and Flamer I think happens to be the easiest. Plus they're usually drawing a lot of aggro and are probably going to end up getting downed, so you're helping the team by sticking by them.   I don't think any of the Volus would be a bad choice, really, depending on how familiar you are with them. I usually try to concentrate on dealing damage with them, though. The only times I routinely use Shield Boost is during objectives or after reviving. You shouldn't have to Shield Boost yourself much because taking advantage of their dual cloaks should mean you're avoiding a lot of damage. Volus Engineer can get great debuffs from Proximity Mine, and I'm always grateful for a teammate with Recon Mine. Volus Adept, or really any class with Stasis, will be much appreciated when playing Cerberus. But if you're better/more comfortable with other classes, they might be the way to go.  Other suggestions that haven't been mentioned off the top of my head: Quarian Males to Tac-Scan bosses; pretty much any Infiltrator for objectives/revives; N7 Demolisher Engineer might be worth a roll if your team is grenade-happy."
MECoOp,35gjs6,bughumbar,3,Sun May 10 07:35:11 2015 UTC,Carry classes have 2 main things in common: damage output and survivability.  All Infiltrators can carry easily based just on TC.  Most Krogans and Batarian can also carry easily since they have high health/shields and usually have very powerful grenades.  Also look for classes with stagger powers/shield regain.
MECoOp,35gjs6,novemberpapa,9,Sun May 10 16:39:03 2015 UTC,"Umm, don't do Volus.  It's not so much that they have a low skill floor, but they also have an incredibly low skill ceiling as well.  It you are rusty, I would run tried and true classes like Ghost, Kroguard, or Alliance Infiltration Unit.  These three are bulky, have easy solutions to any problem, and deal great damage.  They also mesh well with pretty much any group because they are weapons based.  Turian Soldier, Destroyer, Geth Infiltrator, or pretty much any bulky weapons platform would also work."
MECoOp,35gjs6,caesar_primus,2,Sun May 10 06:45:08 2015 UTC,"I like to run geth engineer when I'm trying to be a support class; you can quickly restore shields with geth turret, and you can detonate ammo and tech powers easily with overload."

MECoOp,35fso7,Caspus,6,Sat May 9 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, here are my suggestions:  http://narida.chypsylon.eu/#Infiltrator/TurianGhost/LRIHF//Mattock10AD5AE5/AssaultRifleRailAmp3/ShieldPowerCells4/OperativePackage2/   Guns: As others have said, drop the Valiant and just take the Mattock. You're on PC so it's easier to aim and is fairly accurate. The Mattock has pretty low recoil so I'd take a Magazine Upgrade instead of the Recoil Dampener if you have one. Magazine Upgrade is a high value mod on most Assault Rifles, as it effectively increases your DPS since you spend less time reloading and more time shooting. Piercing mod is also great if you're not using an ammo power that has ammo piercing (AP, Incendiary, Warp, Drill). Tac Cloak 5: Take Melee Damage over Recharge Speed. Recharge Speed of Tac Cloak has a constant floor/minimum regardless of weight if you break Cloak instantly, which is fairly common on TGI since you're mainly using it for the huge damage boost, particularly with ARs. The TGI has a pretty good melee and it can save you in a sticky spot. This is a rather minimal change though and you can keep recharge speed if you want. Though it should be lower anyway since I'm suggesting dropping the Valiant. Stim Pack 4: Take Max Shields over Damage. Stim Pack gives additive damage, like most weapon damage bonuses in the game. The 20% on your Cloak 6 for ARs is multiplicative, but it's one of the few. 5% additive damage bonus on Stims comes out to something like 2% or lower in terms of actual damage increase. In any case it's very minimal, and getting an extra 480 shields when you pop Stim can save your ass in a tight spot (which is generally when you use Stim anyway). Speaking of which, use Stim only to stay alive. The damage bonus is minimal at best, especially with the comparatively huge bonuses you're getting from Tac Cloak anyway. Gear: I assume you go for capacity in Stims 5 because you have no grenade-increasing gear. If you have any, even the shotgun one (name escapes me at the moment, Warfighter maybe it's Shock Trooper), take it. Extra Stims are huge on this character. If you do have more grenades from gear or are comfortable with only 2 Stims, you should put those points towards rank 6 Turian passives. +10% stability and +10% damage is big and these perks are the reason Turian weapon passives are widely held to be the best in the game. Great on an Assault Rifle class like this, too. Fitness 5: I usually don't bother with Shield Recharge on a character with Stims, which are basically on-demand shields. Those are points that can be spent on those rank 6 Turian Passives or the Shield Damage evo of Overload, which vastly increases the damage it does against Shields and Barriers (I think by almost double after all the bonuses). Neural Shock also has some weird multiplier interaction with that evo I think for organic enemies such that you deal a TON of Shield/Barrier damage. I don't remember the exact interaction but it's definitely the optimal way to spec Overload, and it makes it a real beast of a power (especially on the TGI, who gets the Cloak damage bonus on it if you break Cloak with it - which is what you should be doing, if you didn't know: breaking Cloak with a power absorbs that power's cooldown into Cloak cooldown, so you can Cloak then instantly Overload for a 3sec Cloak cooldown no matter how heavy your weapons are).   Hope those help. Make sure to use Stims whenever you're in peril and hit the ammo boxes to refill your grenades when you can. It teaches you bad habits about what fights you can take, but if you're just getting started they're helpful safety nets and can help you amp up your aggression."
MECoOp,35fso7,reivision,2,Sun May 10 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion. I'll take a look at a build like this tonight and see how I like it. As I said, I'm hesitant to give up the Valiant, but I'll see how it goes with extra ammo on the AR."
MECoOp,35fso7,reivision,2,Sun May 10 03:22:04 2015 UTC,Really it's up to you.  I'd say the one change you should definitely do though is switch Stims 4 from damage to shields.
MECoOp,35fso7,Xen0nex,1 point,Sun May 10 03:25:19 2015 UTC,Noted.
MECoOp,35fso7,BlackwoodJohnson,1 point,Sun May 10 03:52:42 2015 UTC,"Nice suggestion!  I also just started using a build very similar to this and can vouch for it's effectiveness.  Just wanted to throw out, by moving two of those skills choices, and reserving either one weapon mod slot or your Weapon Amp equipment slot, it can allow Tac Cloak > Overload > Heavy Melee to kill every unarmored, non-possessed enemy in the game on Gold, which I find a pretty good trade-off."
MECoOp,35fso7,blahgarfogar,6,Mon May 18 02:25:35 2015 UTC,I usually just go 6/6/6/6/0 with this guy. With stim packs spec for max shields you don't need fitness.
MECoOp,35fso7,PlacidPlatypus,3,Sun May 10 05:03:07 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts on it:  -Stability mod is not really needed for the mattock, since it's semi-auto and you already get stability from the passives. You could replace it with extended mag or piercing mods.  -Personally, I opt out of rank 5 of the passives to get the final rank on overload (shield damage). Cloak provides a beefy damage bonus so you're not missing out on much. This will allow phantoms to be easier to deal with.  -It seems to me, looking at your build, that you're focusing on a sniper build (You have the operative package on). If you find that you're using the valiant more often, then you should consider opting out of ranks 5 and 6 of tac cloak, leaving some points to be put elsewhere.  -If you don't play hyper aggressively, you could go out of rank 5 of fitness and put those points elsewhere too."
MECoOp,35fso7,PlacidPlatypus,1 point,Sun May 10 00:03:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Like I said, Operative Package is pretty much the only good gear I have at the moment, so I'm working on getting some more to test other possible builds. I'm also not huge on the sniper so much as I like the range and ability to re-center if I miss my target. Overload + 3-shot will take down most anything I need to deal with, and the reload is just godly for pounding on far-away targets. For anything close quarters or with more health, I tend to pump TC+Stim with AR, chaining Overloads where I can.  I'll definitely look into changing up the Mattock mods and cycling some points out of one of the passives. I've got enough spare points that I could afford to keep one or the other. I'm thinking I can afford to drop the shield recharge in place of upgrading Overload."
MECoOp,35fso7,RepublicanShredder,2,Sun May 10 00:31:38 2015 UTC,"I would ditch the Valiant. The Mattock is good since if you click fast enough it's basically a Harrier, but the TGI is really all about the assault rifle DPS and the Mattock already gives you enough range to work with."
MECoOp,35fso7,hamcake,1 point,Sun May 10 00:33:47 2015 UTC,Part of why I like it is the consistent ability to engage at range without opening myself up too much to get shot at. Any advice on gear that could help make up the difference if I'm poking my head out more?
MECoOp,35fso7,GundalfTheCamo,2,Sun May 10 00:37:52 2015 UTC,As long as you keep your ammo stocked up you should be okay on survivability with stim packs. Warfighter package might help a bit. And just use soft cover and your mobility.
MECoOp,35fso7,Xen0nex,2,Sun May 10 02:34:29 2015 UTC,"Alternate thought line here: since TC and Shield Damage overload can easily 1-shot shields, perhaps you could bring a heavier sniper like a Black Widow or use ammo that is effective vs armor. I personally go for damage TC and chain-nueral-shield damage Overload to make follow up shots easy."
MECoOp,35fso7,othellothewise,2,Sun May 10 03:08:44 2015 UTC,"Here's something like what I used to use:  http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#Infiltrator/TurianGhost/APNNR/Revenant10AA1AA1//AssaultRifleRailAmp3/StabilizationModule4//  Strategy was high survivability and heavy assault rifle damage. This class has good perks for stability, so it works well to shore up the Revenant's weakness in that area. Makes it a really great gun, especially since the stim pack lets you get in nice and close."
MECoOp,35fso7,boobaboobler,2,Sun May 10 06:03:24 2015 UTC,"Doesn't make sense to drop overload. It should be a standard operating procedure to cloak, overload and shoot - rinse and repeat.   Overload is good damage on shields, and it stops all smaller dudes from shooting you for a while allowing you to pick them off easily.   I'd max everything else except stimpacks and fitness. Add Harrier and you'll top the scoreboard."
MECoOp,35fso7,cymikelee,2,Sun May 10 21:12:45 2015 UTC,"Hello!  I know you've probably already settled into your new build, but as it happens I just started toying around with a TGI sniping build from the BBloB that /u/ginja_nija made a while ago today, with a small adjustment, and had at least one insight I wanted to share, and saw you had asked this question recently, so here I go!  As far as skills go, the build I'm using now pretty much the same setup as /u/reivision did in his comment, with essentially two changes, which I will explain below the links to the builds:     Taking some points out of Stim Packs (Max shields & Capacity) in order to get Fitness up to the Melee Synergy at rank 6. Adding one kind of Melee-boosting gear/equipment such as an Omni-Blade I (or higher) mod for an Assault Rifle or the Strength Enhancer II (or higher) Weapon Amp.   Taking into account your gear/equipment, here are two slightly different skill builds / equipment loadouts based on /u/ginja_ninja's build:  a more flexible one for use with Assault Rifles or Sniper Rifles, depending on your mood to use with your Mattock as people recommend (or with your Valiant), and a specialized one for use with Sniper Rifles exclusively like your Valiant, but only if you're set on using a sniper all of the time instead of Assault Rifles.  In either case, I'd recommend just taking one weapon along at a time, just in case you ever happen to need to cloak for more than an instant (which shouldn't be often) and don't want a huge cooldown.  EXPLANATION:  The key difference between this and /u/reivision's recommendation, is that it sacrifices Stim Packs' +40% Max Shield (of debatable usefulness) and +1 Capacity (useful, but you can live without it and just restock Stims more often, or wear some Gear which boosts Grenade Count).  The reason for this, is to add in the Melee Synergy rank of Fitness.  One benefit of this is that you'll have a decent (but not spectacular) boost to weapon damage for 20sec after killing with Heavy Melee.  That's just a bonus though, the real reason you take this, is that the passive boost to your Melee damage, coupled with the Melee boost from Tactical Cloak, and after using an Overload from Cloak, is enough to kill many weaker enemies in one strike of Heavy Melee.    /u/ginja_ninja's initial build was sufficient to use this technique to kill most non-boss, non-possessed, unarmored enemies, excluding for Centurions, Marauders, Collector Captains, or Geth Hunters.  However, what I found out after crunching some numbers and running some tests myself, is that by adding any kind of Melee-boosting weapon mod of any level, or the Weapon Amp Strength Enhancer II (or greater), this puts your Heavy Melee from Cloak (immediately after a Cloaked Overload) into the threshold to add those to the list as well.  This means by using Tactical Cloak > Overload > Heavy Melee, you can kill all non-armored, non-possessed enemies immediately on Gold.  Sometimes killing several at a time, due to the Heavy Melee's small AOE.  And using Tac Cloak + Overload just before the Heavy Melee add almost no time at all, since you can cloak as you step, and Overload just before hitting the Heavy Melee button.  Not only does this help safeguard against getting ambushed, but if you're set on sniping, it means you can carry just your sniper rifle to focus on shooting at long range, and most things that get close to you can quickly be taken out without awkwardly aiming your sniper rifle in close quarters.  tl;dr:  Consider trading one of your Stim Pack ammo count, and one weapon mod or weapon amp slot in order to be able to quickly kill every unarmored, non-possessed enemy in the game on Gold in a single Tac Cloak > Overload > Heavy Melee combo, allowing you to concentrate your weapon game just on bosses / distance targets."
MECoOp,35fso7,Potataro,1 point,Mon May 18 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"Fitness isn't necessary on the Ghost, you get insta shields with the stim packs. I would go with duration over capacity of the stims because you get a damage boost for longer. Equip the warfighter package to get bonus grenades.   For overload do chain overload, neural shock, shield damage and you will be able to take down atlas shields quickly.  For Armiger Legion get the extra damage bonus.  Also idk if you have ti but if you have the Cerberus Harrier this guy is unstoppable. You do ridiculously high dps, have survivability from cloak + stim packs, and can stun multiple enemies at once with the chain overload + neural shock."
MECoOp,35f43t,SirTejTheCowardl,3,Sat May 9 19:10:00 2015 UTC,"This is what I ran when I used to play her.   High mobility, invincibility frames, plenty of shield restore, and grenades. Having a high range, low cooldown dash means you can dash through most walls or even from one platform to another. Scanner makes sure you don't dash into a phantom."
MECoOp,35f43t,Detenator,2,Sat May 9 19:45:18 2015 UTC,I feel like people under estimate the Poison Strike. Being able to get across Glacier or White in two Strikes amazing. Either getting to objectives or picking up a downed team member and disappearing through a wall is amazing.
MECoOp,35f43t,FlashGordon07,1 point,Sat May 9 22:29:33 2015 UTC,"What makes PS so good in my opinion is that you are simultaneously attacking and advancing to the next target, so you come out of nowhere, kill something before it realizes you're there, and then are gone before anything can even start to converge on your position.  Check out my post below. If you use PS as a detonator for ammo-primed fire explosions you can kill any humanoid (including phantoms, dragoons, and possessed captains) in one acolyte/PS combo."
MECoOp,35f43t,smedes,2,Sun May 10 01:22:33 2015 UTC,You can basically run her as a melee class or as a run and gun class. A Poison Strike-based build is also viable but rare.  This is how I run mine (melee).  A run and gun build is basically Hurricane or any other high-powered weapon and using Nightshade Blades for staggers and Biotic Focus to keep your shields topped off. High mobility with Poison Strike and/or teleport dodges through walls mean it's easy to hit up ammo boxes for more nades and ammo.
MECoOp,35f43t,reivision,1 point,Sat May 9 21:48:57 2015 UTC,"Do you still play? You should give my poison strike build a shot, I think you would like it since it's all mathematically worked out to get ""one-hit"" kills :D"
MECoOp,35f43t,smedes,2,Sun May 10 01:24:03 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the unlock!  How I like to run mine:  Poison strike: The strike itself isn't all that powerful, as is the DOT (if you even want dot instead of burst damage). But the real advantage is your forward-facing teleport. Sure, you could achive the same thing by tilting to the side and then dodge, but then you won't cause damage and won't look as cool!   Put 1 point in here, more if you have spare.  Nightshade blades: Simmilar to Balistic blades, these are essentially a built-in shotgun. Enemy too close? Blast 'em in the face with poisonous shards. Nasty boss? Spam NSB. Stacks nicely against big targets.  Biotic focus: Hooo, boy, this is awesome. Instant-barriers? Yes please. This is the primary reason why you should keep your Recharge low. Even just negating a lost shieldgate by popping bfocus helps you stay alive immensely. Must take.  Passives: Nice enough. You can match them to your playstyle (CC or close-mid combat). Long-range combat is tricky with this lady since most of her skills reward close-quarters play, and sniper/assault rifles are generally too heavy.  weapons: Light shotguns, pistols, Smgs and maybe light assault rifles are her forte. heavy stuff slows her down too much and prevents you from spamming biotic focus.  She's lots of fun and super mobile. Walls? What are those?"
MECoOp,35f43t,MrSnippets,2,Sat May 9 22:05:30 2015 UTC,Would the Hurricane be a viable weapon for her?
MECoOp,35f43t,FellGlint,3,Sun May 10 01:19:46 2015 UTC,It's one of the best IMO
MECoOp,35f43t,smedes,2,Sun May 10 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"yes, combined with the high-velocity barrel, the hurricane eats away nicely against armor (against which the cabal has a bit of a problem if she's out of nightshade blades)"
MECoOp,35f43t,MrSnippets,2,Sun May 10 08:06:30 2015 UTC,"Copying a recent post I made in another thread:  ""There are several different ways to play the cabal. I like running her as a mook-killing ammo-primed fire explosion detonator:  This one should be able to kill any humanoid enemy except a dragoon, possessed collector, and possessed collector captain in one acolyte/PS combo;  This one I call ""hard mode"" because you are sacrificing defensive power for offensive. You can kill any humanoid enemy in one acolyte/PS.   This one is the one I actually run because despite everyone telling me how great they are, I just could never gel with nightshade blades. I get to keep 6 ranks in fitness and also kill any humanoid in one acolyte/PS combo.  I made a calculator for the cabal to verify all of this. Check it out:   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FzxM1JvHeivLxhvDw3IApugaAmy1nR4IGCfqnl7YS7U/edit#gid=1739960322  Some of the things only die after PS's DoT finishes them off, so the best way to play this class is the following:   Always keep your acolyte charged. See enemy. Is boss? If no, 4a. If yes, 4b. a. Shoot them with the acolyte, use the time while they are staggered to get within PS range, and then use PS to advance to your next location. Be cool and don't look back at the explosion. Go to 5. b. Pull out your hurricane, shoot. Every time your powers recharge, use either PS to detonate a FE on the boss or Biotic Focus to get your shields back. Repeat until boss dies. Switch back to acolyte. Charge up your acolyte and find another victim.   It's really quite incredible when you get into the groove, because it takes about half a second to kill anything humanoid, and during that time you're also advancing to the next target. You never get cornered, because you can just PS through anything -- and besides, you're never in one place long enough to get cornered. The enemies never know where you are, so you almost always get first strike. Oh, and you have a power that instantly brings a good chunk of shields back up.""  Important note: Poison strike only detonates things that are within 1.5 (or maybe 2.5?) meters of you when you start the strike, so you do have to get in pretty close. One benefit is that you can detonate things in any direction (as long as it's within the radius) so you can always make your next move in any direction."

Either way, takes less than 2 seconds at any range to kill a Phantom without having to deal with their flipping about, shield bubble, or cloaking. The Krysae is also a pretty decent way to set up fire explosions. You could just use warp ammo if your teammates are combo focused and you don't want to interfere with them more then chain overload already will."
MECoOp,35due1,Scarecrow1779,2,Sat May 9 12:36:16 2015 UTC,"Melee Turian Cabal: The class I play when I come back and boot up this game for a few rounds. So much mobility and survivability, plus it's melee (a plus for fun in my book). There's no other class that can traverse maps as quickly or easily either. There's a lot of similar builds, but this is my personal iteration. Sniper/Melee N7 Shadow: You can melee and snipe equally effectively, and feel super stylish while doing it! It took me a long time to develop this build and crunch the numbers for it, and as far as I know, no one else plays it. Very rewarding as it requires pretty exact play to pull off well. I don't play it these days for that reason (I'm rusty...). Explosions Everywhere! BF3 Soldier: Another somewhat ""hipster"" class and weapon - when was the last time you saw a BF3 Soldier, let alone one with a Striker or Venom? One of the few classes in the game that can chain explosions in a row (Tech Burst into Fire Explosion) and wipe spawns with frightening speed. Again, a class and build that took time to develop/optimize and is almost hardly ever run. Which is a damn shame. Asari Justicar Adept: A unique and really fun class. Acolyte + Pull + Reave is one of the most satisfying combos in the game, especially to kill of Phantoms. Bubble placement is very tactical and you can pull off chained Biotic Explosions if you do it right (Reave Bubble Reave on a target). Novaguard and N7 Slayer: Why play a space-magic shooter if you're going to skip the space magic? Non-stop action and face-smashing with these classes. They both have very standard builds you can find in the BBLoB.   Those are probably my favorites.

MECoOp,35due1,Jon9000,1 point,Thu May 14 13:48:30 2015 UTC,"My paladin is only at level IV and puts my cool down at 160.  The executioner X is really cool because dark channel is instant and staggers most enemies, which really helps you land that single shot, which is just devastating coming out of cloak.  Once I get my paladin light enough to match the Executiooner, I may switch."
MECoOp,35due1,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Fri May 15 01:12:50 2015 UTC,"I love the executioner because of the built in penetration. it leaves me open to using warp ammo, but still gives a super easy way to kill guardians, without having to waste an attachment slot on a piercing mod. A lot of the classes I don't use it on, though, are that way because I feel like the executioner messes with the rhythm of power use, while a multi-shot pistol can fit itself into that rhythm a little easier."

I spec it for Radius/Recharge Speed/Detonate. On bosses, I use Singularity->Shockwave for a Biotic Explosion, Warp, then the detonating Singularity triggers the second Biotic Explosion.  Plus, with other Adepts on your team, a Singularity in a group of enemies, shielded or not, is just biotic explosion heaven.  I love Singularity so much.  Also, Reave. I love Reave so much, too.

MECoOp,357wf9,regack,5,Thu May 7 23:41:11 2015 UTC,"Well, to put it in perspective, these were like the first drops I got after the Retaliation DLC came out, and I wanted to try out the Huntress, Valkyrie, TGI, and the Shaman as well... but instead of unlocking multiples, I somehow got all 4 Shaman drops in a row.  That was the real disappointment.  It got better after this, it was just the initial ""wait, what?"" followed by ""you have to be kidding me!""."
MECoOp,357wf9,chem_dog,6,Thu May 7 23:58:55 2015 UTC,"I see you got a Phaeston upgrade in that pack. You should be buying the 20000 credit packs until you have all the silver weapons maxed. Then you can start on Spectre packs and up. Otherwise as you see, you'll be getting uncommons where you should be getting rares and ultra-rares."
MECoOp,357wf9,PlacidPlatypus,3,Fri May 8 12:55:54 2015 UTC,I never even thought of that. Will start on Veteran Packs soon. Thank you!
MECoOp,357wf9,chem_dog,5,Fri May 8 13:47:50 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty sure that's inaccurate, depending on what exactly you're going for. Early on Veteran Packs are a good buy so you can get enough gear and weapon mods unlocked, but if your goal is to get the rares and ultra rares as soon as possible I think you're better off with PSPs."
MECoOp,357wf9,PlacidPlatypus,3,Fri May 8 16:58:32 2015 UTC,In the long run though. If you start out buying PSPs or Arsenal Packs then you will be getting uncommon weapons where you could be getting rares/URs. If you remove the uncommons from the pool then you're more likely to get rares and ultra-rares.
MECoOp,357wf9,KawaiiCub,2,Fri May 8 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's true. If I understand the algorithm correctly, it decides the rarity of each item in the pack before it takes into account what you've maxed. It will give you the same number of uncommons, rares, etc regardless; if you max your uncommons first it won't give you rares instead, it will give you uncommon equipment."

MECoOp,3549jb,TotalSmore,7,Wed May 6 23:50:44 2015 UTC,There's a neat little bug with the Paladin that isn't present with any other class. Cryo Explosions (E.g. when enemies explode in ice) that are triggered by Snap Freeze do twice the damage that they should be doing.
MECoOp,3549jb,ScareTheRiven,2,Thu May 7 00:11:33 2015 UTC,"By triggered, do you mean detonated with snap freeze or primed with snap freeze?"
MECoOp,3549jb,ScareTheRiven,3,Thu May 7 00:19:24 2015 UTC,"Primed, it's how you define an explosion as either Cryo, Fire or Shock."
MECoOp,3549jb,dfiner,3,Thu May 7 00:28:12 2015 UTC,"Shameless plug.    On the sidebar you'll find a link to the Big Bad List of Builds (BBLOB).  You can find builds for the sentinels here, including one I created a while ago which is still valid and effective (plus I've updated it a few times).  The N7 Paladin is probably my favorite class to play in ME Coop (it would be the human vanguard if it wasn't for all the bugs and issues due to lack of dedicated hosting, but I digress).  Feel free to ask any questions you may have!"
MECoOp,3549jb,InfinitePotato,4,Thu May 7 12:45:12 2015 UTC,The Paladin is best when paired with someone like a geth engy. Snap Freeze built for cryo splosions combined with chain overload equals a a glorious wave of icy death.
MECoOp,3549jb,cymikelee,3,Thu May 7 03:00:25 2015 UTC,This... I got through a PUG in something like 12-13 minutes with this combo where the entire game was tech/cryo explosions nonstop.
MECoOp,3549jb,zoso33,2,Thu May 7 03:14:10 2015 UTC,"""Multi-Cryo Explosions"" is literally the best sound in the game. Recently, I played a turian Sentinel with an N7 Paladin and we both scored 3 times as much as the other two players."
MECoOp,3549jb,GundalfTheCamo,1 point,Thu May 7 06:07:22 2015 UTC,Shockwave is also great for this purpose. It goes through walls like Snap Freeze.
MECoOp,3549jb,redx1105,4,Thu May 7 06:56:50 2015 UTC,"As far as planting the omni shield, I haven't found any real uses other than bunkering down when you seen an Atlas missile, Banshee warp, or Praetorian lasers coming your way. It only helps when you're out in the open, which I try to avoid anyway.  Other than that, I really like the cryo effect for snap freezing enemies, especially phantoms. It's so satisfying to have one sneak up on you and then whacking it aside, then gunning it down as it lies frozen helplessly on the floor."
MECoOp,3549jb,cymikelee,3,Wed May 6 23:59:57 2015 UTC,"The omni shield light melee is so great against Cerberus.  Not only can you send Phantoms flying, but you can also go toe-to-toe against Dragoons at close range, great when your team is stuck in a hack circle and getting swarmed.  For extra fun you can melee twice in quick succession by planting the shield, unplanting it (which does one swipe) then light meleeing (for a second swipe)."
MECoOp,3549jb,TheBaconBard,1 point,Thu May 7 00:42:51 2015 UTC,"Further to this, it provides a small amount of grace against a Brute charge. But do not make a habit of this. You'll still be staggered.  I plant the omni-shield out of reflex when I see the silhouette of a Geth Hunter within melee range. That is the most important use of the shield for me. Personal opinion anyway."
MECoOp,3549jb,Kingbarbarossa,3,Sun May 17 03:09:33 2015 UTC,"The shield is very situational, but useful and fun.  Things to keep in mind.   You can stop a charging brute. He'll run into the shield and be flung backwards. When your shield is deployed, it is exactly at shoulder height for human players. This means that someone can easily shoot over your shoulder, using you as quasi cover. This is great for creating choke points and racking up kills. You can deploy the shield fairly quickly. If you're caught out in the open with a clear view to your attacker, just hunker down until they need to reload. A paly who knows what they're doing makes the 4 hack node mission super easy. Just pair up with someone and stand in front of them while they grab the node.   Have fun!"
MECoOp,3549jb,Kingbarbarossa,3,Thu May 7 01:02:57 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered stopping a brute.. I normally try to get out of the way unless I'm a Jugg.  That's a great idea actually, can they sync kill if the shield is up?"
MECoOp,3549jb,Jaysers,2,Thu May 7 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. It's been ages since I played, but I don't remember getting sync killed with my shield out. It might be a directional thing though, be careful.  Oh shit yeah, I'd goad the brutes into it just for the fun of watching them smash their faces into the shield. They'll smash the shield, usually, so be ready for that, but you'll recover quicker than they will. Snapfreeze to the face, shotgun, shield again, then incinerate, rinse and repeat. Tons of fun."
MECoOp,3549jb,Knocking,1 point,Thu May 7 01:51:55 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely have to give the matador maneuver a try, thanks!"
MECoOp,3549jb,cymikelee,1 point,Thu May 7 02:31:56 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea actually, can they sync kill if the shield is up?   I believe they can. The shield does not guarantee protection from sync killing, only from direct damage.   Another thing about the shield is that, as /u/Kingbarbarossa mentioned, it will break in one hit from an attack with considerable force. Examples are the Brute charge, the Dragoon smash, the Banshee melee swipe and biotic pulse, the Scion melee swipe, and Geth Prime melee swing. While you do take reduced damage, it's better to avoid some of these attacks if you can rather than trying to facetank.  Regarding the Paladin himself, a fun gear to use is the geth scanner. His snap freeze can go through walls and if you spec it to go further, then you can hit enemies in a substantial distance while safe behind a wall."
MECoOp,3549jb,cymikelee,3,Thu May 7 10:09:15 2015 UTC,"I love the melee shield myself. The fire evolution primes enemies for fire explosions and does a decent amount of damage on it's own, a quick shield bash + ED/Incinerate fire explosion works wonders and is really fun to play."
MECoOp,3549jb,GundalfTheCamo,3,Thu May 7 00:24:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think I only put the shield at 5, so no fire/ice evolution. I might have to try that though. My current other favorite class is Krogan Warlord Sentinel, and most of the time I forget I even have a gun because the hammers are so fun.. which seems to fit more with the shield bash style you are talking about."
MECoOp,3549jb,cervesista,3,Thu May 7 00:46:50 2015 UTC,"Re: playstyles, I think you're on the right track on going primarily power-based because everything is so strong.  Light pistol or SMG w/amp for 200% cooldown and tech damage (Eagle, Talon, Hurricane are all good choices... Carnifex or Tempest if you haven't unlocked the others), snap freeze everything, energy drain for cryo explosion on shielded enemies and incinerate everything else.  I like taking the 6b evolution on energy drain for the extra ""armor"" because the temptation is so great to maximize power damage that my builds tend to be a little squishy.  I can never decide which skills to sacrifice for some of the shield mastery points... maybe the last passive and go 6/6/6/5/3?"
MECoOp,3549jb,cervesista,2,Thu May 7 00:47:45 2015 UTC,"Currently my skills are 3/6/6/6/5.. probably not the best, but I figured the extra weapon damage from the class kill and health and shield bonuses from the Omni shield were worth it over energy drain.  I currently run a Locust with a power damage amp and the +damage barrel. I sometimes forget I have a gun though xD"
MECoOp,3549jb,othellothewise,2,Thu May 7 01:22:00 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah it's a great class no matter how you spec it!  And the Locust is a great gun, I just find that due to Snap Freeze I'm usually at close-to-medium range so I go for something with a little more punch.  Even at 200% cooldown you still have a couple seconds during which you'll be shooting.  I think one of the biggest benefits of a strong energy drain is being able to strip a Phantom's barrier as quickly as possible.  That lets you ragdoll her with a shield bash.  It's also great against Collectors since everything can potentially have a barrier."
MECoOp,3549jb,BlodhgarmDethahal,1 point,Thu May 7 01:33:27 2015 UTC,"I went with 6/6/6/3/5. Power bonuses don't affect tech combo damage, and that's where the damage comes from with the Pally.   Energy drain is better detonator in some situations, and also increases the durability of the dude. I could see going 4/4 for passives / fitness as well."
MECoOp,3549jb,ProtoKun7,3,Thu May 7 06:59:37 2015 UTC,There's this Techsplosion in my pants build that I really loved when I ran it. You don't really miss the class passives much when everything explodes every other cast.
MECoOp,3549jb,RepublicanShredder,1 point,Thu May 7 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"That's a very aggressive build.. I assume spamming energy drain kept you alive without the extra health/shield boosts from fitness?  I tend to spec classes to survive first, and deal damage second, because I hate being ""that guy"" who falls over every wave or two."
MECoOp,3549jb,El_Diablito,3,Thu May 7 02:34:39 2015 UTC,"Well, you can sort of change the build up and get some extra tankiness by choosing the health and shields evolution at rank 4 from Shield Mastery instead of Melee damage, but that only adds 15%. And it's about as tanky as you'll get on the Paladin.  I think I actually used that evolution, as this isn't a melee build anyway.  Edit: If you don't care much for melee, you can actually build this 6/6/6/4/4 for some extra oomph on your Power Damage. If you care about Shield Recharge more than Extra Power Damage and Weight, then go 6/6/6/3/5.  Really it's about keeping the castables at level 6."
MECoOp,3549jb,ifdef,2,Thu May 7 02:43:13 2015 UTC,"Don't forget snap freeze goes through walls. So with the range upgrade you can pretty much prime everything in a room without getting shot.  Pair this with a good detonator such as an engineer with chain overload, an adept with shockwave, or a half-blast novaguard and everything dies."
MECoOp,3549jb,El_Diablito,1 point,Thu May 7 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"I tend to use it almost exclusively against Geth, so I use Energy Drain to detonate instead of Incinerate. I almost never go down as a result. Otherwise I tend to play it with friends who have specialized detonating powers (hello chain Overload).  Shield is ok, I never go the rank 6 though for the elemental damage, I tend to not get that close if possible."
MECoOp,3549jb,boobaboobler,1 point,Thu May 7 04:48:23 2015 UTC,"The omnishield is pretty useful; use the Fire shield as a primer, and the bash does good damage anyway. It's also useful for blocking turrets and some other things."
MECoOp,3549jb,RolloKitty,1 point,Thu May 7 09:33:20 2015 UTC,Stupid omnishield fact: its strength is affected by Cyclonic Modulaors and the like. This means it can fully deflect attacks like Phantom sword swipes with the right gear.
MECoOp,354di6,tinkerfel,2,Thu May 7 00:27:58 2015 UTC,"Veteran Packs are best for unlocking Uncommon weapons, though there are some reports that for unlocking Uncommon mods, the higher-tier packs are a better value. According to the College, some Uncommon Mods may only be available in higher-tier packs."
MECoOp,354di6,RTukka,1 point,Thu May 7 04:28:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, you want Veteran Packs after your common weapons are maxed. You should be getting upgrades for your uncommon weapons fairly commonly in those packs. And as you say, you can get them pretty frequently with Silver match income.  The Locust is definitely one of the better uncommon weapons IMO. High headshot multiplier (3x or 4x IIRC compared to 2.5x normal), accurate, light, easy to handle. I also highly recommend the Mattock. The Raptor and Eviscerator are also good weapons for their tier.  Most of the uncommon weapons are straight upgrades of the common weapons with better weight, handling (reload speed, accuracy), clip size, and damage.  If you're getting bored of Vet Packs, save up and sprinkle in an Arsenal or Premium Spectre Pack or two (some of the 99k packs). You should get a few nice rare or ultra rare unlocks, and some of those weapons are very powerful even at rank I."
MECoOp,354di6,reivision,1 point,Thu May 7 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"And if you have commons maxed, the Avenger X is also pretty great, especially once you've worn out your clicky finger with the Mattock/Raptor and don't want to bother installing the autoclick macro or whatever."

I actually really like the way this gun handles. Pretty accurate, almost 0 recoil. Very easy to headshot with even from mid distance. The only issue with it (like the Avenger) is the low damage per bullet."

Whenever I was saving I spent on Premium as I wasn't too focused at the time over specifically characters or weapons once I had 'mains' for Vaguard and Engineer. The latter being Vorcha and I only ever wield the single Locust (Incinerate for Blood lust and then start firing for headshots)"
MECoOp,351d7i,cervesista,9,Wed May 6 08:10:08 2015 UTC,"Everyone has already said most of what it is important to have in mind. But there is something missing. Take your time! You are absolutely not in a hurry. Run around the map until mobs are bunched up and you can easily use right hand advantage, identity spawns , and take time to breathe while you chip at them.   Only time you should be in somewhat of a hurry is for objective waves, and then you have your consumables as backup if you fail. Still, even then, slow and steady works wonders. When you solo it's all about control and pace, and that is absolutely something taking your time helps with."
MECoOp,351d7i,UpsetLobster,6,Wed May 6 16:00:38 2015 UTC,"I highly suggest doing your solos against Geth, since Geth have no sync kill.  I did mine with a Krogan Vanguard simply because I wanted to finish them, but any class with very quick recovery is fantastic (so things with energy drain, the AIU, or Turians with stim packs.)  Experiment a bit, but the maps I'd recommend are Giant (or Hazard Giant,) Vancouver, or Reactor Hazard.  The openness of the levels really helps you out, and the fact that its hard to get stuck somewhere with the whole map shooting at you is a major plus."
MECoOp,351d7i,idiotsonfire,2,Wed May 6 11:38:57 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, doing it on a small map makes it easy to chew through waves quickly. You can get screwed on some objectives though as enemies spawn and are on top of you very quickly (i.e. devices). Other than that though it's a breeze.  I did my Gold solos with KroGuard + Reegar v. Geth on Glacier. Super straightforward and fast, which was fine because I just wanted to finish them for BotB and running solo matches isn't really a big draw of the game for me.  I think Giant is the canonical Gold solo map otherwise if KroGuard v. Geth is too cheesy for you."
MECoOp,351d7i,reivision,1 point,Wed May 6 23:19:13 2015 UTC,I'll keep the geth in mind esp since I'll likely be using a Geth Scanner for awareness so Hunters shouldn't surprise.
MECoOp,351d7i,idiotsonfire,1 point,Wed May 6 14:52:04 2015 UTC,"If you do it on a map you can easily control with lots of light like Giant, a hunter shouldn't surprise you as much as they would on London.  Just gotta work up to getting used to spotting the way their cloaks move and controlling how you choose to react.  That's also a reason why its good to have a character that's hard to stagger."
MECoOp,351d7i,bughumbar,4,Wed May 6 14:55:07 2015 UTC,"Vancouver and Giant are both pretty great maps for your first gold solos as they both block off the middle, making kiting easy, which is great for objectives. Vancouver's quite a bit bigger, so while it gives you more freedom for running away, it'll also take longer to finish. White isn't bad either, I just personally prefer the more rectangular layouts of the other two.   I'd suggest Geth Scanner for gear, no matter what class you're running (unless, well, you pick a Geth). Situational awareness is everything. Maybe a Responder Loadout for the extra medigels, but I imagine the Geth Scanner would probably spare you more deaths.   Other than that, just hope you don't get a Hack objective and watch out for magnet-hands. My first gold solos were with the AIU (Repair Matrices are a nice insurance policy) and the N7 Fury (dodging through walls is just unfair)."
MECoOp,351d7i,bughumbar,2,Wed May 6 08:27:51 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Quite familiar with both those kits though I tend to survive more with the AIU. I just might roll her again on these maps you suggested. The scanner suggestion is something I might not have done myself. Thanks!
MECoOp,351d7i,Thorg23,2,Wed May 6 08:31:15 2015 UTC,"My main gripe about the AIU (or at least my AIU) is that, since I use the AT-12 Raider on her, its low accuracy makes it pretty hard to get close enough to kill Banshees with her without risking a sync-kill. Looking back I probably would've either changed my shotgun or added another more accurate weapon for dealing with them.  Oh, and obviously knowing where you are in relation to the ammo boxes is also crucial, especially for classes like the AIU or Armiger Turians where you heal yourself with grenades.   Another useful thing is knowing what you'll be facing each round. You might panic for a moment getting a Targets Eliminated objective in wave 6, until you remember that Banshees (or Atlases) don't spawn in wave 6 on gold."
MECoOp,351d7i,cymikelee,2,Wed May 6 08:42:49 2015 UTC,"That spreadsheet isn't completely accurate. I'm not sure how out of date it is, but I know for a fact that the Geth and Cerberus stats are no longer correct, as it has primes on geth wave 8 when there are none, and shows 0 dragoons on cerberus wave 11 when they do spawn in that wave."
MECoOp,351d7i,ManCalMan,1 point,Wed May 6 12:18:48 2015 UTC,"What a useful link! Thanks!  I used to roll my AIU with a Piranha with an accuracy mod and damage mod + AP Ammo. Will probably roll it the same way, though I haven't tried its effectiveness solo."
MECoOp,351d7i,regack,1 point,Wed May 6 08:50:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not as good as you guys and have only soloed Bronze, but from my experience having to solo PUG waves the Piranha w/smart choke seemed to work okay on Banshees.  I made sure to shoot at a wall before rolling the kit to get a sense of the necessary hitbox at certain ranges when unscoped (DIY shooting range in MP, lol).  Edit: IIRC I think I also had a Talon sidearm that I used on her barriers as she was teleporting around... though if that's all you're using it for the Acolyte has got to be a better option."
MECoOp,351d7i,BlackwoodJohnson,1 point,Wed May 6 08:53:39 2015 UTC,"Never thought of testing weapon range that way (then again, I've tested most of the weapons in battle anyhow, and have paid the price many times - Looking at you AT-12 Raider at range).  In any case, I think the biggest thing in terms of ""being better"" is really being confident with what you have. Of course your weapons and consumables make things a lot easier. But a Claymore X's not gonna have great DPS unless you're confident you can reload cancel effectively. Having the mindset that it's up to me to perform well has done wonders for opening up the Multiplayer game for me and it's been fun. :)"
MECoOp,351d7i,olaf_the_bold,4,Wed May 6 10:10:57 2015 UTC,"My tip:  Kill ALL the small things first! If you kill bosses they will respawn.  If you kill all the small things first, THEN kill the bosses last, you will only have to kill one set of bosses. Saves time.  Also, fight banshees on ramps or stairs. Can't grab you if you are not on the same level / altitude."
MECoOp,351d7i,BlackwoodJohnson,1 point,Wed May 6 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"To add to this, you want to eat up the wave budget quickly with the easiest to kill units.  I can't link to any of the documents that show this information, because I'm at work :s.   Aside from objective waves, anyway."
MECoOp,351d7i,Jon9000,2,Wed May 6 17:56:39 2015 UTC,"I think more than half of soloing is how lucky you are in what objectives you get for wave 3, 6, and 10. The biggest problem is when you need to disarm the 4 objectives. With hack and escort you can just keep running away from that area then run back to it to reduce the amount of enemies there, and hack and escort a little bit a time like that, but with disarming, it's always a choice between disarming and dying midway or be stuck fighting at the objective forever, and no matter how much I try to use the same strat to kite enemies away there would always be a boss or two hanging around the objective. You can use rockets, but if your objective waves are a bunch of assassinations and disarms that empties my rockets then my extraction chances plummet."
MECoOp,3516lr,cymikelee,9,Wed May 6 06:31:36 2015 UTC,"I've found using Geth Scanner boosts my survivability far more than anything else. Especially for close quarters characters, knowing what's around those corners often means the difference between life and death.   Shield Drain is amazing on the Shadow, and I can't imagine not taking Duration in TC4 on her (but then I also take Bonus Power at rank 6). I usually only put 3 ranks (if anything) in Electric Slash in favor of more points in Sword Mastery. I like having the option for a longer range power/detonator in case of a hack/escort objective."
MECoOp,3516lr,bughumbar,2,Wed May 6 07:03:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, of course the ONE gear I haven't unlocked yet is Geth Scanner.  But that makes a ton of sense, especially if I keep any points in ES at all.  Echoing some of the other helpful posts... I realized I was doing more of a hybrid build but I haven't gotten to level 20 yet, so I can still fix it without a reset (unless I want duration on TC, good for survivability with bonus power but not sure that'll still let me OHK Phantoms)."
MECoOp,3516lr,bughumbar,1 point,Wed May 6 07:29:57 2015 UTC,"Here's how I usually run her, for what it's worth. My philosophy is: ""When in doubt, Claymore"" (it's also why I don't take rank 6 in N7 Shadow - I figure the Claymore does enough burst damage that I can have 3 ranks of Electric Slash for emergency crowd control). Since the Claymore is a base-game weapon, the omni-blade and heavy barrel won't actually increase your cooldown. You can go power efficiency (or shield power cells/cyclonic mod) instead of adrenaline, but I'm a sucker for movement speed buffs. Obviously learning to reload-cancel is a must for this build.   When it comes to Phantoms, I like to try and make sure I've killed someone else to activate Martial Artist before taking them head on. Recharge Speed in Shadow Strike doesn't matter at all since I never use it outside of TC, and TC's cooldown overrides it. Cloak, Shadow Strike a trooper, heavy melee whoever else is near (ideally a captain unit), then get yourself out of dodge. But primarily I run her as a mook killer. I'll take on Assault Troopers, Centurions, Combat Engineers, and even Dragoons (thanks to the Armor Damage evo) all day, but I tend to stay away from Phantoms at full health/barriers.  Depending on the map, it can be easier staying alive with the N7 Fury, since she can dodge clean through walls. She's the first class I soloed gold with, and it's all because of her wallhax ability."

MECoOp,3516lr,Gray_Squirrel,8,Wed May 6 13:26:45 2015 UTC,"There's a bug in the game where add-ons that add weight to your weapon only add the weight if: 1) It is a DLC weapon (eg: Reegar, Harrier, etc.) or 2) You also have UL Materials equipped. It'll still show it adding weight in the weapons screen, but it doesn't actually add the weight.  So in the case above, since the Claymore is an original game weapon, the HV barrel and Omni-blade won't add the weight it says it does. If you put a HV barrell and UL materials on, it would add the weight though. If he had a Reegar equipped instead, those items would actually add the weight.  Make sense?"
MECoOp,3516lr,phantuba,1 point,Wed May 6 14:13:11 2015 UTC,Yeah! I can't believe I've never heard of this before...
MECoOp,3516lr,Scarecrow1779,4,Wed May 6 15:51:04 2015 UTC,"for glass canon classes that use melee and cloak together, i've found that staying cloaked is the best thing you can do. I use this build for the shadow. The duration cloak, combined with the bonus power evolution of cloak, allows me to use a shadow strike, and stay hidden afterwards long enough to find another target to kill. You sacrifice some of your damage against Boss enemies, but can take on groups much easier. However, you should take that with a grain of salt since i play my shadow as pretty much a melee/shadow strike only style. (I mostly play this style on Silver/Gold against Geth)  Another tip would be to take the lightweight off of both of your weapons. If you don't have lightweight on your weapons, then the omniblade won't actually ad its weight to your cooldowns. You'll have a faster cooldown and can use other mods to make your weapons even better. Also, i just noticed you took the combo evolution for rank 5 in Electric Slash. This combo is bugged and does not work at all. Source. With those 2 changes, this would be the build I would suggest that changes your build very little. This would leave you with less than a 3 second cooldown on electrical slash."
MECoOp,3516lr,cervesista,2,Wed May 6 07:24:35 2015 UTC,"I've barely used the Shadow since I unlocked it late. I didn't do well with my first build, but I was successful with it basically with this guy's comments right here.  The key really is the Duration and Bonus Power evolutions of Cloak (this is the only kit where I build TC this way).  I might suggest the N7 Crusader so you can kinda snipe, but that's gonna be bad for your cool downs. So maybe roll it with a Pistol (maybe the Paladin) or an AR (Saber, maybe). You won't do as much damage as with a Shottie's Omni-Blade, but you pretty much have all ranges covered with one gun.  Again, not much experience with the kit, but this is pretty much the path I see for rolling it on Gold.  Edit: There's a build on the BBLoB around the Kishock, IIRC. Something about being able to charge pre-cloak and keep your charged shot and cloak this way. No melee damage mods on Sniper Rifles though, so I haven't tried that suggestion."
MECoOp,3516lr,Scarecrow1779,2,Wed May 6 07:40:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a pretty big fan of duration cloak with bonus powers. I use it on my melee Geth Infiltrator and melee FQI. There's also a Drell Infiltrator build that I use on gold that specs cloak with duration and bonus power. It focuses on spamming and detonating recon mines while remaining cloaked. The power magnifier V and Engineering Kit V are important because they get the detonation damage from Recon Mine high enough to one shot all un-shielded mooks (2025 health on a Gold Cannibal). With the effective 200% cooldown (weight of heavy barrel is glitched on all pistols except acolyte), you can easily detonate 2 recon mines before uncloaking. By spending the majority of the match cloaked, you become great for reviving teammates and doing the 4 device objectives. The duration cloak also works well with the Arc Pistol since you can detonate a cloaked recon mine, then have time to find a new target and line up a headshot while still cloaked. You can use armor piercing rounds on this build to give your pistol of choice more punch and ditch the SMG with piercing, but I prefer using disruptor or phasic rounds because bosses shields are often the hardest thing for this class to get through. You could use the Acolyte on this class very effectively, but you kind of need a highish damage weapon to deal with coming around the corner with cloak on cooldown and running into a marauder.  As far as invasive scan goes, most enemies will die before you can take advantage of the debuff, so the only real advantage to invasive scan is that it raises the detonation's damage to health/shields/barriers by about 500, while dropping about 1000 armor damage. This is good for silver, though, where the 2581 damage to health/shields/barriers is enough to one-shot all shielded mooks except possessed collectors. On Gold, I stick to using the Armor Damage to kill Brutes/Ravagers/Scions much faster."

MECoOp,3516lr,reivision,2,Thu May 7 00:26:21 2015 UTC,"Edit: There's a build on the BBLoB around the Kishock, IIRC. Something about being able to charge pre-cloak and keep your charged shot and cloak this way. No melee damage mods on Sniper Rifles though, so I haven't tried that suggestion.   Hey, that's my build!  You can get the general idea from this part:   PLAYSTYLE  You have two options at your disposal which both can take out mooks in one shot: your Kishock and your SS.   Charge Kishock. You should always have a shot primed and ready to fire when you're not doing anything else. Locate mooks. The higher priority targets, the better: Phantoms, Dragoons, Engineers, Hunters, Pyros, Collector Captains, Marauders, etc. Cloak, preferably out of LoS of enemies, then select your target and release charged shot. No need to aim for the head: this build can kill every mook with one bodyshot. If your aim was true, you have just taken out one mook. Either way, your cloak should still be active. Reload your Kishock. Even if you use SS, you want to have your Kishock loaded and ready to go. If the situation looks safe enough, use SS on another mook to get another kill and keep your Martial Artist active. If not, either reload and shoot Kishock again (either uncharged or charged for a very short amount of time to maintain cloak bonus) or run away to safety.   Ideally you want to be killing with SS or your melee every other cloak cycle or so (every 20 seconds) so you can keep your Martial Artist melee bonus active. Without the Martial Artist bonus, your SS won't do enough damage to kill some mooks with one hit. You can easily follow up SS with a heavy melee to secure a kill and activate Martial Artist again since SS staggers enemies.  Against bosses just keep using your Kishock. You supposedly get highest DPS with the Kishock when firing continuous, uncharged shots. But a charged, cloaked Kishock harpoon deals tons of damage if you can land a headshot, so that's up to you. I'll generally charge and go for a headshot on the larger bosses if I have cloak up, otherwise I'll just keep pumping them full of meter-long spikes.  You don't really have any on-demand crowd control or panic powers other than cloak, so you have to play smart and pick your targets wisely (especially if using SS).  In general, I find myself using SS more in earlier waves then relying more on the Kishock against boss-heavy later waves.   Yeah, this build is pretty funky and uses a bunch of weird mechanics (Kishock, Cloak, Shadow Strike, etc, all have some weird/unintended effects and interactions).  It's a pretty specialized build though with a high execution threshold.  Something like Salsa's N7 Shadow build is the more canonical melee Shadow build and is a lot easier to ease into. Cloak, Shadow Strike, wait for cooldown, Shadow Strike again. Works best with light weapons like Eviscerator, Wraith, Talon, Arc Pistol, etc. You can even abuse the charge weapon + Cloak mechanics with weapons like the Graal and Arc Pistol to kill 3 mooks in one Cloak duration.  You don't need to take all melee evolutions in your powers and passives to one-hit things with Shadow Strike, even on Gold. Shadow Strike gets double bonus from Cloak bonus damage because it counts both as a power and as melee. I forget the exact thresholds but just throwing it out there. This is what allows you to kill things with Shadow Strike even with a sniper rifle with no melee mods."
MECoOp,3516lr,Gray_Squirrel,1 point,Wed May 6 23:32:16 2015 UTC,"Mind blown.  Wow, I'll have to try this sometime, seems like the Shadow has ridiculous replayability from all these creative builds.  I'm working on getting used to charged weapons now (Graal on KroSol, lol), I'm still not completely comfortable with them outside of the Acolyte (since you don't really need to aim it in the traditional sense).  Edit:  Is Kishock viable at II?  I've been RNG'd to have GPS and Hornet at X but my Kishock is at II..."
MECoOp,3516lr,Scarecrow1779,2,Thu May 7 00:55:21 2015 UTC,"Cool, I might respec after all to dump the extra ES levels (but keeping it for fresh spawns / hitting through walls).  I noticed I was getting less damage not taking the passives anyway.  I couldn't find a way to get enough damage on SS to OHK Phantoms with the duration cloak, so I came up with this build.  If it still feels too squishy I think I'll try the bonus power evo and take bughumbar's advice about activating Martial Artist to get enough juice behind SS."

MECoOp,3516lr,GundalfTheCamo,2,Thu May 7 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"Best advice I can offer for CQC builds is that they can't shoot back if they are dead. Max DPS and volley damage is your friend.  http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#57!3507585!!24Q56324!C38D9G   My Shadow build.. 6095 damage vs Armor, which is actually more damage than my Shadow Strike. 2-3 hits the armor off of boss enemies. A good shotgun with high stagger ability helps a lot too (Geth Plasma or Disciple come to mind, even the Venom although that takes a lot of practice to use) to keep infantry off you and give breathing room.  For other characters, explosions work well to keep crowd control and prevent from getting surrounded. For vanguards, Incendiary ammo + Biotic Charge to detonate. A good SMG like the Hurricane works well for that. Higher risk for sync kills though, you need to pay more attention to the mode of an enemy before you charge, especially Banshees and Praetorians. Phantoms don't have the same risk thankfully as since they are infantry sized they tend to get staggered by the charge.  But as other people say, situational awareness is your best friend when it comes to surviving, but you can say that about any character or class."

I'd remove it completely and concentrate on shooting and shadow strikes.  Max everything else. I'd put something in melee damage in Fitness to max out your Shadow Strike. If you can't kill a Phantom in one strike on Gold, you're doing something wrong.   Bonus power for TC evo 6 can allow you to Shadow Strike twice from single cloak, but I don't know how important that is.   The main thing for successful shadow play is to use your gun as a first resort, and use Shadow Strike when there is a good opportunity that doesn't get you instantly killed in the middle of a group of enemies.   BTW heavy blade is bugged and does not increase cooldown on non-DLC weapons ... unless you also add lightweight materials. So your weapon mods are wrong. Just put both heavy barrel and heavy blade on the wraith and you're good to go. Forget the Phalanx.   Pistol with a melee stunner and power mod might work better though."

As for survivability, I usually use the fast dodges to keep ahead of incoming fire; a Fury jumping through a wall can easily save your ass, or an Asari's biotic push forward.  I tend to run a Geth scanner with some of them, then power amps or efficiency mods for the armor upgrade.  Mostly depends on play style, really."

MECoOp,34v4l7,fluxweeds,4,Mon May 4 23:22:45 2015 UTC,Reegar with incendiary ammo + warp. Sit back and watch the face melting goodness :)
MECoOp,34v4l7,Sebastianthorson,2,Tue May 5 15:14:56 2015 UTC,"I just tried a Wraith build last night, nice damage output, but I find it gives me tunnel vision and makes me focus too much on one target. I still get biotic explosions for AoE, but it happens much less often due to the extra weight. I still wreck things, but not at my usual killing rate.  Perhaps I just need more practice with a shotgun build, but I'm not that big of a fan of it honestly. Which is odd since I basically use a shotgun anyway with the Talon."
MECoOp,34v4l7,cymikelee,1 point,Tue May 5 21:27:14 2015 UTC,"Raider deals much more damage in close combat. And it is the only weapon that gets better with lag, sometimes firing 3-4 shots before server registers your empty clip. And leave BEs to Fury.  http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#49!3406535!5905565!24N53384!E.GAGK"
MECoOp,34v4l7,___Firefly___,5,Sat May 23 19:16:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not super experienced but it's my favorite class.  Tankier than the Fury with a faster dodge and Warp is arguably better for team support.  I run the same build except I go an extra level in Fitness instead of Tech Armor -- I'm taking a break from her to unlock banners, but I'm leaving sentinels at Level 20 to keep the Valk on standby.  Funny you mention the Geth Engineer, I've been playing it a lot lately, love chucking that turret around to burn things and overload for fire explosions.  I guess I tend to play classes other people don't because a) I can't snipe and b) I don't play classes with potentially annoying powers like Flamer."
MECoOp,34v4l7,SilverNightingale,4,Mon May 4 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"It's just personal preference. The Asari Valkyrie is very good, but the Fury does higher damage with more mobility. Going through walls is fun. You're making me want to pick up co-op again just to play the Valk."
MECoOp,34v4l7,BlackwoodJohnson,5,Mon May 4 21:28:59 2015 UTC,"The Valkyrie Sentinel is more about tanking/aggro with equal balance in powers and guns.  The N7 Fury is more of a glass cannon, slipping in to land attacks at close range using Biotic priming/detonating, then using manueverability to take potshots."
MECoOp,34v4l7,BlackwoodJohnson,5,Mon May 4 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"There was a spreadsheet that was posted here before that calculates how much tech armor and barrier converts to hp (lost the link), but I believe you'll get more survivability by taking 4, 5, and 6 out of tech armor and putting them into fitness. You might also want to spec into headshot damage instead of power and force since it only affects warp and won't increase your dps as much.  With the Valkyrie, the best combo is a reegar with warp or incendiary ammo, whichever one you have, though I prefer reegar incen as it does so much damage even without warp/incen cheese."
MECoOp,34v4l7,BlackwoodJohnson,2,Tue May 5 00:51:43 2015 UTC,"50% damage resistance basically means that it takes twice as much damage to kill you. So, 1475 Barrier * 2 = 2950 effective shielding.  Putting extra points into fitness gets you 1675 Barrier with 35% damage resistance. This equates to 50/35 = 2/x.. x = 1.4. So the multiple is 1.4 damage needed to be done than normal. 1675 Barrier * 1.4 = 2345 effective shielding. So its more effective to go for Tech Armor rather than Fitness (assuming the figures on this character builder are correct).  I've considered using headshot damage instead of power, but I honestly don't aim for the head at that range, I just kind of blind fire since I'm using a pistol-wanna-be-shotgun.  The Reegar is a nice gun, but I'd like to be in the thick of fighting constantly rather than running from ammo box to ammo box. I'm considering a Wraith instead if I decide to play around with a shotgun build, after I'm done grinding promotions."
MECoOp,34v4l7,Shotgun_Sentinel,5,Tue May 5 02:03:47 2015 UTC,"Nevermind, found the spreadsheet (thanks to Detenator for creating it). With 50% tech armor and 1475 barrier, you have 2212.5 effective shields in cover and 1998.625 in no cover. With 35% tech armor and 1675 barrier, you have 2261.25 effective shield in cover and 2091.23 in no cover. So even with your setup, 3/6 tech armor/fitness is a better choice.  Edit: without cyclonics, 6/3 tech armor/fitness with get you 937.5 barrier in cover and 846.8 out of cover, while 3/6 will get you 1113.75 barrier in cover and 1030 barrier out of cover."
MECoOp,34v4l7,cervesista,2,Tue May 5 02:50:37 2015 UTC,"It's been talked about (read it here first but no doubt talked about else where) that damage reduction on tech armor and barrier is not as advertised if you are not in hard cover, that is 50% damage reduction is less than 50% damage reduction. It also depends on how heavily you use cyclonics and how many of them you have to make the build optimal, as it makes sense that the more barrier/shields you have, the better damage reduction becomes. I remember that without cyclonics, you'll get more with 3/6 tech armor fitness than 6/3. Let me see if I can find the spreadsheet that calculates it."
MECoOp,34v4l7,AJockeysBallsack,2,Tue May 5 02:35:52 2015 UTC,Also using Cyclonics helps TA do more for you then it would to just have fitness.
MECoOp,34v4l7,cymikelee,2,Tue May 5 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"I think people can't quite figure it out as easily as the other classes you mentioned, because she's best used with a synergy of powers and weapon damage (and survivability with tankiness and a good dodge set).  I kinda was meh about her to start. It was only after reading things from the BBLoB that I was convinced she could kick ass (and she does!)."
MECoOp,34v4l7,AJockeysBallsack,2,Tue May 5 03:40:38 2015 UTC,"I love the Valkyrie, but I only play it as host or in a low latency game. I rely heavily on dodging in/away for BE's, Warp/Incendiary ammo combo, and general aggro draw.    Like you, I use a Talon, but mine is at X.  I don't use a Reegar because although cheesing can be fun, I'd rather not. The Wraith does indeed work well, and at X, it's very light. I just prefer the shield bonus and extra shots of the Talon.   I recommend Incendiary ammo over Warp ammo.  While the Talon won't stack as well as a rapid-fire weapon, it still eats armor and health well enough for fire-and-forget kills. And again, the Talon has a bonus vs shields, so no worries there."
MECoOp,34v4l7,cymikelee,1 point,Tue May 5 13:36:59 2015 UTC,"If I roll incendiary on the Valk, I actually go with a Hurricane with a scoped Talon as sidearm.  ULM is required to maintain 200% cooldown but you're putting out enough damage anyway...."
MECoOp,34v4l7,El_Diablito,1 point,Tue May 5 18:02:02 2015 UTC,"A Talon X has a negligible weight difference, (anything at or above 150% really doesn't matter) and since it's a vanilla weapon (non-dlc like the Harrier), the heavy barrel can be added with no weight penalty.  Nifty little bug. It will show the penalty on the screen, but it won't actually apply ingame. AP mod, heavy barrel, and Incendiary IV.  The weapon screen will say something like 130%, when it's actually around 180. So even with the Tech Armor penalty, you're still pretty well set.   There's plenty of nuances and little things you can learn here and there from reading the sidebar resources, watching YouTube, and experimenting on your own."
MECoOp,34v4l7,El_Diablito,1 point,Wed May 6 01:31:35 2015 UTC,"Huh, the more you know.  Thanks!  Seems I'll be using the heavy barrel... a lot.  I'm at ~70% for a bunch of Pistol Mastery pistols, this will make it go faster!"
MECoOp,34v4l7,Dairgo,2,Wed May 6 06:08:03 2015 UTC,So is the gist of your play style to run up close and prime enemies with your AF and then trigger a BE with your Talon?  Do you prime targets with Warp before they're in your AF?
MECoOp,34v4l7,Chypsylon,2,Tue May 5 15:06:03 2015 UTC,"Prime with AF and detonate with warp. Talon is just there for finishing off weaker enemies that the explosion doesn't finish off (Marauders and Centurions its a one two punch of BE and Talon shot) and for damage in between cooldowns. Warp ammo is just nice for extra damage on the Talon, doesn't detonate anything."
MECoOp,34v4l7,Shotgun_Sentinel,1 point,Tue May 5 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool.  So you're just a tankier, perhaps slightly more versatile Fury in some sense.  I'm gonna give her another try.  I had her set up from the Co-op college with the reegar but didn't really enjoy her that much in that setup."
MECoOp,34v4l7,vader540is,2,Tue May 5 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"I love the Valkyrie.  That character is my Jam.  Big lanky maps, little  enclosed maps, hell, even against geth.  Load her down with either a piranha or a disciple with the shredder and the smart choke, and you've got destruction on the plate with a side of stagger (for the disciple any how).  I have run her with pistols / smgs before for use of the power amp mods, but always go back to the shotgun.  I Run the geth scanner so I can see everything near me.  I can top scoreboards with this build, and have on a few occasions tipped over 200k points.  My Build: http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#49!3503545!!34N53384!DFG.GS  I will be the first to admit though, that this is a big risk big reward character, you are almost always within sync kill range of the big bosses, but Warp Ammo + AF + Warp can get you big rewards, and kill fast.  And you don't have the quick exit ability like the fury that can flash step through walls.  But I love her because she is a bit more sturdy than a fury, and every bit as deadly."

MECoOp,34tcm2,Scarecrow1779,3,Thu May 7 18:41:16 2015 UTC,"So this just happened. /u/OneTrueChaika and I were setting up a U/U/G game with one other friend and picked up a random 4th. The 4th was relatively new to the game, so we all got out our carrying classes (Paladin, Krolord, Kroguard, and our 4th was a Destroyer) and put on extra equipment. We got Giant/Cerberus, and it went fairly smoothly until wave 5. At that point, we started realizing that half the team couldn't see Phantoms. Throughout the match, /r/OneTrueChaika and our other friend could not see any phantoms, even with an 'eliminate the target' diamond over them. We basically ended up scooting back into corners and our 4th and I would call out where phantoms were coming from so those who couldn't see phantoms could direct their fire (and occasionally missiles). In the end, we had a full extraction, and there was only one wave where we went down to one teammate left.  Our 4th was a PS3 player named GoGoBabyRangers, and while he has a relatively low N7 and Challenge rating, he uses a mike, sticks with teammates, and helps with objectives. If you see him, don't be too quick to boot him.   tl;dr: FUCKING INVISIBLE PHANTOMS ALL GAME LONG"

This guy tries missiling everything in sight (must've had a gear that gave extra missiles), ending up in the corner of Giant with sightlines to 2 Scions, burning all his ops packs and gel before sending his last missile through the legs of the last Scion.

MECoOp,34tcm2,timoleon,2,Thu May 7 02:31:18 2015 UTC,"Well, in general no.  I can only remember a couple of incidents.  Mostly just getting kicked after a match.  One time someone got on the mic in wave 9 and complained I wasn't ""with the team"".  He didn't start talking until ""the team"" had bled out and I was soloing the rest of the wave.  This was after I had already managed 10+ revives.  Wave 10 was a hack, and I finished that off with only 1 other person until the other person got sync'd.  The mic guy was complaining again, because I ran away from the hack circle.  The hack was overrun with Praetorians, and I was low on rockets.  Long story short, completed the hack, soloed the wave again, got everyone to extraction wave.  Got my credits, and left that lobby like it was on fire.  More recently I was kicked BEFORE a match (u/u/g) that had 3 newish looking players.  I guess they didn't want me in there, maybe they were inviting a friend, but I suspect they didn't want me spoiling the fun?  More often than not when I join a PUG I top out the scoreboard, not because I'm spamming missiles or trying to ""score"", I'm just trying to kill everything as fast as I can.  Then I get dropped in a match with someone like Crashsuit, or in the past, RedJohn, Annomander, etc. and I get schooled.  :D  These matches are usually even more fun because they're so fast, but sometimes there's nothing left to kill, and I'm just riding the wave for easy credits.    For reference, I've put in about 650 hours, and I've been playing a bit at a time since March 2012.  I never really played hours and hours on end, usually 1-3 matches, 4-6 times a week.

MECoOp,34tcm2,cervesista,2,Tue May 5 23:32:04 2015 UTC,"Well then. Just played a Gold game and got a message in wave 3 or so saying ""stealers suck"". I instantly think: ksing? Who gives a fuck in this game? If anything, I appreciate when others help me kill shit. It's honestly baffling to me that anyone cares about anything other than just getting the job done. And don't you earn points based on how much damage you deal to an enemy anyway? The weird thing is, I was primarily killing away from him in those first few rounds. 2 minutes later, I get a message saying ""remind me to kick u"". Checked the points, turns out he, the supposed super pro with thousands and thousands of N7, was way at the bottom, and I at the top. Me, with my N7 rating of not even a hundred. He was totally peeved. Fastforward to wave 5 or so, and everyone but me wipes out (I still tried to be the better person and revive him despite his obvious avoidance of reviving me when I needed it). I end up managing to save his ass and get the wave done, and within the next two minutes he leaves.   It was beautiful."

It was not one of those games where I was just taking all of the kills, I was doing a huge chunk of the work and pretty much put the team in my backpack. At least I was playing Falcon/Raider GI with an easy map/enemy, but it's just a drag to pretty much solo the game while trying to keep teammates up.

Anyway, after taking my Geth Trooper into Gold, I learned why the Flamer was overpowered. Used the reactor room as a choke point, pointed my cursor in there, pushed Y and watched everything die. It helped that I had a Salarian (presumably Engineer) shadowing me and spamming whatever power it has that detonates fire explosions. Between the two of us, it was easy mode. The other two players may as well not have even been there.  Then I decided to take a Krolord into the next match. Collectors. Whatever, I though. I did fine against them on Silver. Turns out that Biotic Hammer pretty much just tickles Scions on Gold. And that it doesn't leave you time to get away from sync kills. And that Possessed Scions even have a sync kill. I spent more time dead than alive, and we ended up wiping on Wave 7.  Also: jumped into a game with a host who had perhaps the worst connection I'd ever seen. I'm talking enemies teleporting all over the place, most of my shots not registering, a nearly five-second delay to use powers... it was bad. Really bad.

But since maxing my Rares, I feel like the drop rate of URs is so low, I'd rare do a buying session in one go in the hopes of coming away with the feeling of having gained a UR per buying session.

MECoOp,34sj4a,OneTrueChaika,1 point,Mon May 4 07:23:01 2015 UTC,"I maxed my manifest by mostly buying SPs instead of PSPs.  I played mostly gold, so buying just PSPs would exhaust my equipment, but 80k per match and PS at 60k I'd have more than I used. That's because you get 5 slots with either pack.   I usually played for an evening and then spent the creds."
MECoOp,34sj4a,Fyrjefe,3,Mon May 4 07:33:59 2015 UTC,"But PSPs give you 2 slots with a chance for URs, so, they're kinda more worth it (in collecting URs) credits-wise. At least that's what I'm thinking.  But I play gold too so I can only buy 3 PSPs every 4 matches, assuming I don't buy anything else.  I get the logic of buying SPs on a per match basis. Problem is I don't score guaranteed wins with Gold. Sometimes I'm using a character I'm not too familiar with, or my level isn't ideal (going for N7 Master), or I roll Collectors in unknown with a poor setup, or I'm just in a team that doesn't gel (medi-gel AND you know, doesn't mix), etc.  So yeah, I save up for PSPs despite playing Gold mostly. But hey, you have a maxed manifest so I'm glad that worked for you. :)"
MECoOp,34sj4a,Jon9000,2,Mon May 4 07:48:28 2015 UTC,First you have to admit that you'll never get all URs.   After that defeat you can start to play for fun instead of credits. With good equipment the lower rank URs work as well.   That's why I chose to do it like that. I always had good equipment to burn.   After a lot of time I did get the URs complete. But it was more about the incredibly fricking long journey.   I did have the benefit of a great friends list and we failed Gold missions very rarely.

I decided it would be prudent to eliminate any further risk to the team and gelled — and got sync-killed by a second Phantom that must have snuck up while I was face-first in the dirt.  I start spectating on the only surviving player (the fourth had overestimated his abilities and bled out earlier in the wave), only to see he was making his way to where me and my compadre had met our ends.

Which means it costs 2.5k per medigel, given a gold game will grant you ~80k that is 32 medigel when you can use a max of 6 per game (unless using gear).

Amusing as hell to go 1980's Arnold on a spawn with the trigger held down and listening to pugs murmuring ""yo what the hell is that guy using holy shit"". Phantoms/lolgoons want to spoil your party, pull out the Scorpion and suddenly you're moving twice as fast and emptying the clip with the hunter mode ROF boost.  Unfortunately you almost never see a non-Juggernaut pug using the Spitfire. I'd love seeing/hearing 4 Spitfire users all focusing fire on a single boss."

MECoOp,341pd9,Innumera,2,Mon Apr 27 19:58:55 2015 UTC,"I have the trooper spec'd for full fitness, full weapon dmg in passives, Hunter Mode for ROF and movement speed (without that, the movement slowdown is unbearable without an adrenaline mod), Fortification for shield recharge. For equipment I prefer Stronghold, Adrenaline III, and Incendiary ammo. I go with barrel and piercing on the spitfire.  The scorpion is your backup against Phantoms, lolgoons, and being group mobbed in close. With the dakka cannon, there are several factors to make maximal use of: RHA, the ""panic"" animation from incendiary ammo, your boosted ROF, and the trooper's fast shield recharge. I like to get into midrange, open fire on the body then quickly walk it up to the head. Surprisingly it's also lethal at close range. You can quickly stunlock and kill multiple enemies in succession especially with wallhack, dodge and RHA. I actually prefer doing this since enemies just melt in close quarters against it. Vs bosses, get RHA and hold down the trigger. Check your emails, come back to the screen in 15 seconds.  Is it better than the Typhoon? Not really tbh. But it's a fun change of pace and looks/sounds fun especially on a geth.   The thing with the Spitfire that makes many people struggle is that they try to put it on an infiltrator to boost the damage, or on a Juggernaut so they can just stand there firing. Infils don't work well with it because the Spitfire needs sustained fire, not hit and run bursts. The movement speed penalty also doesn't synergize well with what infils need to do to survive. The Juggernaut has so many drawbacks (slow, low damage passives, cumbersome w/cover, etc) that it also hinders the spitfire effectiveness as well.   The trooper I think is the best fit for its  combination of offensive capability (Geth weapon damage, Hunter Mode) and defensive boosts (tanky, fast shield recharge, can dodge, can partially counteract the movement penalty)."
MECoOp,341pd9,ProtoKun7,4,Mon Apr 27 22:12:14 2015 UTC,"Put it on the Geth Infiltrator or Turian Soldier and you can make it decent, but it'll never be as good as the Typhoon. If you have the Typhoon there's really no reason to use the Spitfire other than as a joke"
MECoOp,341pd9,cervesista,2,Mon Apr 27 21:31:24 2015 UTC,"Spitfire causes more damage than Typhoon per second and has more ammo in magazine and carried. The downsides are the slow movement speed and spool up period (which typhoon also does have).   It absolutely wrecks, but you need some type of armor penetration at least on Gold. Because like Typhoon, the per bullet damage is low. Works best with Destroyer or Turian Soldier."

MECoOp,341pd9,cervesista,3,Mon Apr 27 22:00:17 2015 UTC,"Well the only thing I can think is that it's because of its insanely large clip and I believe it has something like a 175% damage bonus to shields and barriers, which makes it a decent boss killer, but certainly not the best.

While i don't have the hard data to back it up, I have anecdotal evidence against vet packs. myself and several friends all used the strategy of buying lots of vet packs to max uncommons and commons before buying SPs and PSPs to focus on rares and URs. We all found that uncommon gear appeared far more often in SPs than in vet packs (even when taking into account the price difference). we certainly did not experience the high drop rates for uncommon gear that the table suggests.

So instead of paying for 2000 veteran packs and 10,000 spectre packs, you'd just be paying for the 10,000 spectre packs (these numbers are made up, but illustrate the basic point, which holds as long as Ultra Rares are indeed much rarer than Uncommons).  That said, if you aren't concerned about maxing out your entire manifest on as few credits as possible, and your shorter-term focus is indeed on Uncommon gear, then Veteran packs would seem to be the way to go... except that there are Uncommon mods that apparently don't drop in Veteran packs, so for those you'd want to go for a higher-tier pack again."
MECoOp,340177,JRandall0308,0,Mon Apr 27 15:09:05 2015 UTC,if you aren't concerned about maxing out your entire manifest on as few credits as possible   I can't conceive of why you'd want to grind out the credits necessary to max your manifest and then NOT spend those credits as efficiently as possible. But whatever. It's a game.
MECoOp,340177,RTukka,2,Tue Apr 28 13:21:46 2015 UTC,"Skipping Veteran Packs is the strategy that allows you to spend your credits as efficiently as possible if you are trying to max your manifest.  You can max out your entire Uncommon manifest by purchasing nothing but Spectre Packs (or a combination of other higher-tier packs). You are arguing that this would be an inefficient use of credits because Veteran Packs yield more Uncommon gear/characters per credit.  What you are not taking into account is the fact that maxing out your entire Rare and Ultra Rare manifest will require purchasing many Spectre Packs because Ultra Rares are so infrequently dropped even in the high-tier packs. This means that you will incidentally max out your Uncommon manifest in the process of buying higher-tier packs to max out your Ultra Rare manifest.  Think of it like this: You are not overpaying for Uncommon cards, you are paying a good price for the Rare/Ultra Rare cards that you need and are getting the Uncommon cards for free.  Buying Veteran Packs makes sense if you are starting with a bare manifest and few credits and want to get a range of good/serviceable  weapons, mods and characters quickly. Or if you really desperately want to max out one particular Uncommon weapon as quickly as possible, VPs would make sense in that situation as well.  But if you are trying to efficiently unlock your manifest and you already have a decent spread of Uncommon/Rare stuff, Veteran Packs make for a less optimal purchase."

It was really nice because it filled my supplies of medigel, which quickly depleted after I started into SPs and PSPs. Let's just say, the drop in medigel has been part of my learning experience :). I try not to tunnel vision about my UR manifest. My brother recently got the game and is already trying to save up for PSPs. I keep insisting after I carry him through a gold game that he buy VPs, because a level I --insert UR weapon here-- is worse than a level V --insert uncommon here--. I still get top billing with the scimitar X and/or mattock X. Those are staples that have made my grind easier."

MECoOp,33vs3h,Warfy,7,Sun Apr 26 02:42:49 2015 UTC,"Even with Shield Boost, you would be hard-pressed to call the Volus ""durable"".  You would probably enjoy most Soldier kits. In particular, the Vorcha has Bloodlust for health regen, and the Turian Havoc Soldier has Stimulant Packs for a quick shield boost."
MECoOp,33vs3h,Scarecrow1779,5,Sun Apr 26 04:28:37 2015 UTC,"are you kidding? Volus are some of the most survivable classes out their if you use them correctly. Hey /u/RolloKitty ! When you play your volus, be sure to use their light melee. It causes them to cloak for 4 seconds, then has a 2 second cooldown after that. It runs on a separate cooldown from your other powers, using powers and weapons don't break cloak, and your shields can regenerate while you're cloaked. If you use cloak every time you can, it makes you able to use your offensive abilities more and just shield boost occasionally when you really need to.   Also, there's actually 2 cloaks from light melee that have separate cooldowns. one triggers while sprinting, the other triggers while standing or walking. You can trigger one, then trigger the other right when the first runs out. Using this mechanic, you can stay cloaked an entire game if you're focused on it. Meanwhile, you can shoot, use powers, and regenerate your shields all you want.  I really like using the volus cloak to stay in the enemies' faces. My favorite volus for that playstyle is the volus sentinel. You see a bunch of enemies, drop a combat drone on top of them from far away, then cloak while running to them. Once you're pretty close to them, you drop a decoy in the middle of them, shoot them with whatever pistol or smg you like best, and recloak when necessary. The decoy and combat drone both do a good bit of damage when they die (and i spec them with minimal health so that they die quickly), so be sure to throw out another drone or decoy whenever the first one dies. Playing like this makes phantoms pretty entertaining because they spend all their time shooting your decoy and often kill themselves whey they try to melee it to death. The key is to stay cloaked and make sure to have drones out to distract the enemies. This means you can stay up close and personal without taking any damage most times."
MECoOp,33vs3h,Warfy,2,Sun Apr 26 12:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good point. I was thinking in terms of how much damage the volus can take, even with the help of Shield Boost. If the enemy never shoots at you, though, it's (mostly) irrelevant. Survivability and durability are different concepts, and I made assumptions based on his class choices. Thanks for the extra point of view, man."
MECoOp,33vs3h,Scarecrow1779,3,Sun Apr 26 13:13:14 2015 UTC,"the other thing that makes the volus super survivable is the .5 seconds of invulnerability after activating shield boost. this means that even if you can't get away from a Geth Bomber's payload, you just activate shield boost right before the grenades go off and you take no damage."
MECoOp,33vs3h,timoleon,2,Sun Apr 26 13:49:08 2015 UTC,"Wow i never knew they could do that, i will try them out again maybe spec them differently then before thanks! :D"
MECoOp,33vs3h,bughumbar,3,Sun Apr 26 23:44:56 2015 UTC,"To survive and make himself useful, a Volus must not just rely on Shield Boost, but also on his two cloaks.  One will activate when you press the light melee button while running, the other when standing still.     The Volus Engineer may be the easiest to survive with, because his proximity mine can stagger most enemies, and trigger combos.    He may need more medi gels than other classes, but if played right, he can be great fun, and an asset to any group."
MECoOp,33vs3h,TylerZip,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:36:23 2015 UTC,"I like the Volus Sentinel for survivability.

MECoOp,33vs3h,othellothewise,3,Sun Apr 26 07:23:42 2015 UTC,"Turian Ghost Infiltrator. Spec him to do as much weapon damage as possible and slap a Harrier on him, and you will kill everything. You also get stimulant packs which are basically free ops packs, except they don't restore you're health. They restore you're shields and give them a boost, and increase you're damage for up to 9 seconds depending on how you spec them. You really can survive with only putting 3 ranks into fitness, but if you want that extra survivability you can't put a fourth and get the extra health and shields.   The basic tactic with the Turian Ghost is to find an enemy or group of enemies and go into cloak, which gives you a boost to your weapon damage. If the enemy has some kind of protection like shields or barriers, or there's a large group use overload while in cloak and then start shooting. If it's just one or two, just gun them down. If you're shields get dropped, eat a stim pack and you'll be stronger for it. The Turian Ghost was basically built to make the higher difficulties more accessible to players."

MECoOp,33f3je,Fyrjefe,6,Wed Apr 22 01:49:12 2015 UTC,"Except for that vulnerable spot, London's my favorite area. The upstair corridor is excellent for sniping.  But anyway, here's the thing: Kill the ranged enemies first (ravagers and marauders are deadly, not to mention scions) unless you're going with Cerberus; in that case, focus first on the phantoms and let other people cover you.  Cover each other during the special assignments; always reload under cover; and run. Run. Like. Hell.   Speaking of running, what I've seen is that if I run straight, even in zig zag, the heavy shots always get me. You must run in curbes so the enemy's shooting speed can't catch up with your change in trayectory. And naturally, always choose passageways to cover your sides.  Of course, the best trick is choosing a good team. I never play with people under 1000 trophies on gold."

And because they're so tough, they waste all their medigel on the first rounds to feel like they're another Shepard in the making. HAH! Corporal Jenkins did better than them!  Of course, in the later rounds, they ran out of medigel already. Just when we have to rescue that stupid drone.  ""They got meee!!"" ""I'm down!!!"" ""Losing pressure!""  So I have to go save them because they can't take care of themselves. I wasted 9 medigel rescuing them. All. My. Fucking. Medigel. Every. Single. Fucking. Time.  Did I mention I wasted 5 missiles because everybody went their own way instead of forming a barrier around the one who's supposed to disable that reaper contraption?

If I had to decide who'd survive on that mission, I'd feed them to the thresher maws myself. But no, my stupid sense of loyalty tells me I have to take care of the fucking babies.  But no more. If I waste at least 5 medigel before round 4, that's it. Good luck becoming cannibal bait. This Krogan's out."
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,2,Tue Apr 21 05:16:20 2015 UTC,"Did you waste the 4 medigel trying to save their dumb asses that ran out in the open or something? after 2 medigel that early, i would have let them die and solo what I could."
MECoOp,3393jb,otakuman,5,Tue Apr 21 09:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah on my AIU I've learned that after 1 rez in a Circle of Death, stealth and ruuuuuuun away. Even if the other three get executed, I can run and gun and save the round."

Not so much because of their lack of equipment, but because they're super stupid. They don't help you get up because ""that's what medigel is for"" , they get lost where you can't revive them, they die like flies."

MECoOp,3393jb,Scarecrow1779,6,Mon Apr 20 22:30:34 2015 UTC,Same here.   Been sitting on a Scorpion 1 and Harrier 1 for two years!
MECoOp,3393jb,crashsuit,3,Tue Apr 21 02:37:53 2015 UTC,I can't get level 4 rounds out of PSPs always another ultra rare pistol upgrade
MECoOp,3393jb,mightykingfish,3,Mon Apr 20 22:48:25 2015 UTC,I'd take any weapon upgrade at this point.
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,2,Mon Apr 20 23:16:17 2015 UTC,this is the part where everybody hates you because they wan't the ultra rares.
MECoOp,3393jb,Scarecrow1779,2,Tue Apr 21 09:38:20 2015 UTC,This is what I don't get. Shouldn't ultra rare weapons be available in the arsenal pack? I'd gladly pay 300K credits for an N7 weapon upgrade.
MECoOp,3393jb,cervesista,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:50:30 2015 UTC,agreed. i regularly go like 10 spectre packs and two or three PSPs without seeing a single UR.
MECoOp,3393jb,cervesista,2,Wed Apr 22 01:24:10 2015 UTC,"Each rare slot of each pack has a 7.5% chance to roll an ultra rare, and whether it rolls a rare or ultra rare for that rare slot, will give you a level 4 consumable instead of the rolled item, if the rolled item is already at level 10. It may seem like long stretches between ultra rares, but in the long run it does average out to the same rate. Hope that helps."

MECoOp,3393jb,cymikelee,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:34:12 2015 UTC,"Those are all pretty good (granted, my Particle Rifle's only at Level 1, so it kinda sucks sometimes, depending on the build using it). Favorite of the 4 you mentioned would be Talon Pistol. Godsend for Vanguards and other CQC builds (it's a mini-shotgun with 3 shots!), especially when you add Commando Equipment, as well as power and weapon damage/piercing mods."
MECoOp,3393jb,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Tue Apr 21 06:31:41 2015 UTC,"What's the sentiment here on the scoped Talon as a pocket sniper rifle?  I sometimes pair it with a light SMG/AR for power classes, but wonder if I'm doing it wrong."
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,1 point,Tue Apr 21 07:26:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried a scoped Talon yet, but I imagine it's like adding the accuracy mod on a Shottie so I imagine you're doing it okay: scoped Talon for long-range and close-range mooks, and light SMG/AR for bosses? That sounds like it makes sense!"
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,1 point,Tue Apr 21 10:15:52 2015 UTC,"I like it. The recoil is sort of a pain when you're zoomed in, but the accuracy boost is nice. Scoped Carnifex and Executioner are also good pocket snipers. It makes me very sad that you can't use the scope and the power magnifier at the same time, though."
MECoOp,3393jb,othellothewise,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I wonder if I'm doing it wrong.  I'm rocking Tempest/Hurricane at close range since my SMG power magnifier is at V, with the Talon being used at range or when I don't feel like switching.  I guess I could go Talon-only but I'm already at 180-190% cooldown with this setup."

MECoOp,3393jb,PlacidPlatypus,3,Tue Apr 21 23:22:13 2015 UTC,"Got to play a few matches today and I totally forgot how bloody this game was. With a Batarian I thought I was the most barbaric out there with exploding knives and punch people's heads straight off. To be fair though, getting stunlocked by Dragoons and Phantoms is not my ideal definition of fun.   Then this Krogan Warlord surprises me and saves my bacon by turning a Dragoon into chunky salsa. Not to be confused with chunky Salsadips, which only happens when there's too many crumpets lying around the LZ."
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,2,Wed Apr 22 03:15:52 2015 UTC,"I unlocked the AIU recently. Wow she's great. Before I did good to just contribute in Gold, now I'm contributing, I'm reviving people, I'm scoring 1st or 2nd (particularly against cerberus), it's awesome. I could conceivably shine in Platinum with her once I get my gear up. I'm built for stealth and shotguns, using the Reegar. I melt Atlases on Gold.   I'm also using the Batarian soldier to work on Dog of War. Running around Glacier Hazard on solo, vs Cerberus, to grind Grabs. He solos better than the AIU and the Geth Juggernaut (which I unlocked in a gift pack, lucky me). And that was at level 11. I'm going to try to solo silver and maybe gold with him once I get him up to level 20. Definitely going to play him in gold. Boosted inferno grenades plus Harrier with incendiary is good times."
MECoOp,3393jb,Scarecrow1779,3,Mon Apr 20 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"Love the AIU, it's been my crutch.  After posting as a newbie a couple weeks ago I've graduated from using a Reegar to trying out the Piranha, which has been really satisfying too, to the point I got to solo a good chunk of a Wave 10 on Gold without using missiles after the rest of my team got Banshee kabobbed (including the N7 Fury who was, to be honest, carrying the team).  Have to say my current obsession is the Asari Valkyrie... so much asplosion but with some tankiness.  Love dancing around bosses with that sweet Asari dodge.  It's funny, I've gone from canon soldier Shepard in SP to this power-loving, CQB fighter in MP.  Would love to take a page from your book and start trying out solos, sounds like it'd do wonders for my crappy situational awareness.  Just been sinking way too much time into this game lately!"
MECoOp,3393jb,BadBoyMcCoY,3,Tue Apr 21 04:42:48 2015 UTC,mmmm... Valkyrie. Brutes are like pieces of candy to her.
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,3,Tue Apr 21 09:44:55 2015 UTC,"She's extremely user friendly, and yes reegar is like the greatest thing on her + your thermal clip packs are now ""free"" medi gel sorta since her repairs use grenades, and they fill grenades."
MECoOp,3393jb,BadBoyMcCoY,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:39:05 2015 UTC,"The problem I have is that the repair kits can't be used as actual medi-gel, since they only bring me back if I take damage during the activation period. And not even every time. So basically I either have to be able to activate the packs when I get in a bad spot and I know I'm about to die, or try to constantly have them up, or only activate them before going face to face with a boss, or else they don't do me any good."
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,2,Mon Apr 20 18:52:21 2015 UTC,"Repair matrices work as long as you aren't sync killed and die while the screen still has the visible effects activation makes.  It's 100% effective if you use them when you lose all your shields, and death is about to hit"
MECoOp,3393jb,BadBoyMcCoY,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:55:47 2015 UTC,"Unless you're getting staggered and can't activate it in time.   I did have a couple times last night where I had repair matrix active and I died not from a sync kill and I didn't resurrect, but I think it was due to lag. The server thought the effect was over, but it didn't look like it was over for me.   My big complaint is that I can't use them in the same manner as a medi-gel. It's still very nice, but I use it mostly for the damage and DR boost, instead of relying on the rez ability."
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,3,Mon Apr 20 18:58:04 2015 UTC,That's a problem with every grenade power off-host. Sometimes your character will do the grenade tossing animation or you will get the repair matrix but nothing actually happens. You can make sure it happened by checking your grenade count (it won't decrease if the power failed due to lag) or by playing as host.
MECoOp,3393jb,BadBoyMcCoY,2,Mon Apr 20 23:53:49 2015 UTC,"Don't think of them as free medigel, think of them as free Survival Packs."
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,2,Mon Apr 20 22:40:47 2015 UTC,"They don't really function the same as survival packs though.   They provide a little shield regen, but the kicker was that if you died while it was active you got back up. It's kinda hard not to view it as a refillable form of medigel, much to the chagrin of other classes using grenades."
MECoOp,3393jb,Scarecrow1779,3,Mon Apr 20 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"The key difference between medigel and survival packs is when you can use them. They both make you not be dead when you would otherwise be dead, but medigel you can use after you're downed whereas survival packs you have to use before. The repair matrix you have to use before you go down, making it more like a survival pack than like medigel."
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:02:41 2015 UTC,I'd agree more with this interpretation
MECoOp,3393jb,jabbaciv,2,Tue Apr 21 12:59:40 2015 UTC,"I think he's saying that the point of them is to use them when you're under heavy fire, as opposed to when you're already dead. as stated in the other comments tho, offhost lag is an issue."
MECoOp,3393jb,Scarecrow1779,2,Tue Apr 21 09:49:45 2015 UTC,Batarian soldier is bad ass. He's who I used to get my solo banner. The double stagger you can get with his exploding spikes helps a lot in a jam. Also the melee is so satisfying
MECoOp,3393jb,Earlkay,2,Mon Apr 20 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"That melee also gives you a whopping DR bonus while you perform it.  BatSoldier is definitely a good class, but I prefer going surfing with the BatSlasher"
MECoOp,3393jb,Salsadips,2,Mon Apr 20 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not even using the spikes at present because I'm focusing on Dog of War, which is melee, grab, and grenades. Also headshots but I'm not worried about those. So he's built for melee, blade armor, and grenades. He's fantastic at it. I'll probably respec for the spikes after I get the achievements. Grab is the hard one, but a grab in Bronze counts exactly the same as a grab in Platinum."
MECoOp,3393jb,Earlkay,2,Mon Apr 20 23:07:50 2015 UTC,"Ah cool, yea he's a lot of fun to play with and pretty tanky. He's my go to character after a few beers!"
MECoOp,3393jb,Salsadips,2,Tue Apr 21 10:39:56 2015 UTC,"I took him into Gold at level 17 and it was against Collectors (my hardest enemy with him) and he was a thoroughly solid performer. Those fricking praetorians though. I'd been using a Claymore on him, after seeing advice from others I think I'm switching to a Reegar."
MECoOp,3393jb,bigbossodin,2,Tue Apr 21 13:01:37 2015 UTC,"Nice I should give that a try., I like using the Cerberus harrier as he can carry a bit extra ammo and also I tend to hit ammo crates pretty often anyway to refill those inferno grenades.  One thing I love doing with him is running up to group of enemy's, staggering them with blades, then inferno grenade to stagger again, shoot the ones with highest health (leaving them still alive) then watch as the entire group explodes from the explosive blades. Awesome when you can pull it off."
MECoOp,3393jb,bigbossodin,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"I use Harrier with a shotgun because the way I run him he doesn't need recharge time. I'm running at 180-190% cooldown, doesn't hurt me since I never turn off blade armor."
MECoOp,3393jb,RepublicanShredder,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"Cool, I see."
MECoOp,3393jb,Scarecrow1779,2,Tue Apr 21 15:03:14 2015 UTC,"Got my bat soldier to 20 last night, I was farming gold on him. The PITA is it was all Reapers all the time. I'd been hoping for Cerberus. Still did great though. I did switch to the Reegar for close range, sticking with the Harrier for long range."
MECoOp,3393jb,RepublicanShredder,2,Wed Apr 22 14:13:03 2015 UTC,"just a note to be aware of: incindiary grenades will override the damage from incendiary rounds (meaning the ammo DoT will end when the grenade hits).  also, a Reegar works really well on the BatSol if you have him specced for power damage, with ballistic blades and incendiary grenades maxed. This lets you be an up-close power house, staggering everything with exploding ballistic blades, melting shields with the reegar, and eatting up armor with incendiary grenades."
MECoOp,3393jb,RepublicanShredder,2,Tue Apr 21 09:43:55 2015 UTC,"Last night I alternated between using AP and Phasic, AP seemed to work better for me."
MECoOp,3393jb,ANiceOakTree,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:13:34 2015 UTC,Good info. Drill or AP rounds then?
MECoOp,3393jb,crashsuit,2,Tue Apr 21 12:18:39 2015 UTC,"or disruptor/phasic to strip Atlas and Prime shields faster. either way.  i've actually found AP or Drill rounds effective on my Krolord with the Reegar. Sometimes, when trying to shoot a geth prime, you'll kill a drone in front of the prime, but the drone will leave behind an invisible block that you can't shoot through. a little bit of piercing makes this a non-issue."

MECoOp,3393jb,Warfy,2,Tue Apr 21 03:06:20 2015 UTC,"Idk if this is a rant... But I just played a really weird game on Gold. I came in wave 2 and there was just a geth Jug and eventually another guy joined. Anyway, I though it was just the three of us, when I checked the score there was only three, same with kills and stuff. But sometimes... a couple of Atlases would get blown up by a missile far away from anyone else. And a mysterious name came up for a killstreak, but there was no other person I could see. Anyway, the most confusing part of it all was when we had a package objective because nobody seemed to be taking it and yet someone was at the same time. I felt very out of the loop and died a bit trying to pick something up that wasn't there anymore.   Anyway, as I suspected some guy was hosting a modded match (his name was 3golas and he had like 19900 N7 points) and it was quite the interesting experience."
MECoOp,3393jb,iamtheaisle,3,Tue Apr 21 02:14:41 2015 UTC,"Sometimes people don't have good connections to each other within a lobby, and people won't be able to see each other. It's similar to how sometimes certain and/or all enemies will be invisible during a match, or sometimes certain sounds cut out. It wasn't a modded game, just one with a bad connection."
MECoOp,3393jb,ajanledagag,1 point,Tue Apr 21 09:27:27 2015 UTC,It's actually a relatively common bug when I play with my friends where one of us is completely invisible (also on the scoreboard) to another. It kinds of sucks when you go down and ask for a revive and your friend can't revive you because you are invisible to them.
MECoOp,3393jb,KawaiiCub,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:10:42 2015 UTC,"I've seen this bug rarely on PS3. Also a couple times I was the invisible guy. It was weird and sort of spooky. I joined mid-wave. I was all alone, but enemies would die seemingly at random. I wasn't sure there were other players until I started seeing trophy messages (""Player SoAndSo - 5 headshots +500"", etc). I didn't see kill messages, and I don't think I was interacting with 100% of the enemies. I only saw myself on the scoreboard, but then we were all in the lobby together afterward."

MECoOp,331b3g,ObeyLogic,19,Sat Apr 18 17:19:16 2015 UTC,Especially because all of the DLC's for it were free and had weekly updates for the first year and a half.
MECoOp,331b3g,Bridgeru,11,Sat Apr 18 19:48:53 2015 UTC,"For me the story developing the Reaper War through MP operations was almost like a living record of the Reaper War. Sure, I'd completed the campaign before it was half over but it was still kinda nice feeling like ""ok so timelinewise we're here"". In a sense it was like the Cerberus Network News tied closer to the story."
MECoOp,331b3g,Salsadips,3,Sat Apr 18 21:42:45 2015 UTC,"ME3 had weekly updates for 1 year, up until the last DLC dropped, then they moved onto different projects (Dragon Age Inquisition)"
MECoOp,331b3g,Detenator,5,Sun Apr 19 13:07:36 2015 UTC,Also integrated directly into the campaign and with objectives as well though. Maybe they will finally develop a true horde mode? Traditional FPS gamemodes could be interesting (against AI of course).

"" This sounds great!  It will connect your muliplayer characters directly into your single-player game.  Of course it's cool you can do Strikes with real players too, but this means your carefully crafted builds can be used to help play your single player story!"
MECoOp,331b3g,bughumbar,4,Sun Apr 19 04:32:33 2015 UTC,Super excited for that. I always thought it was a bit of a shame all I could get in the main campaign for 3 was a better EMS rating.
MECoOp,331b3g,Kingbarbarossa,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:29:52 2015 UTC,I love this idea. And I hope they take the more character focused route with the classes that they did in DAI. I think that would work really well in Mass Effect as well.

MECoOp,331b3g,Detenator,10,Sat Apr 18 22:45:48 2015 UTC,"""hey why not pay us some real money to reduce the need for grinding""   Just like ME3MP was. As long as the grind is fun and can be quantified in some way (i.e. having some way to gain guaranteed progression) I would have no problem with that philosophy. After all, there are players who enjoy playing the game that can only spend an hour here or there actually playing that would absolutely throw some hard cash in to get a little further.   The problem comes when companies begin making the grind longer only to push players towards the ""p2w"" system. Developers should be focusing more on making the grind fun and rewarding with the option of skipping some of the grind for more rewards, rather than slow and monotonous."
MECoOp,331b3g,sneauxoui,2,Sun Apr 19 01:15:48 2015 UTC,"Completely agree and that is EXACTLY what I'm worried about. Reading the description, there's so much to grind for as opposed to ME 3, which is just credits.  Imagine, say, a galactic readiness booster, or run speed power up a, etc."

It was wave 10, and we get 4 devices, which is normally perfectly manageable with a decent squad. We get one device down, and on my way up a ramp, I see a Phantom at the top. I get it to pop it's bubble and distract it, but I've been shield gated and my teammate went down behind me. Thinking I'll quickly dash back and get the revive while my shield regenerates, I dash backwards, immediately into a sync kill by another Phantom waiting below. I had completely missed the [Killed by Phantom] death message, and we wipe pretty much soon afterwards.    Not the worst failure ever, but it stuck out in my memory because of how perfect the timing was. I literally dashed backwards and immediately got synced before I even saw the Phantom."

It has a cooldown, I don't remember exactly what it was, but around two seconds.   Health does the same thing. It is very hard to notice either if you are taking multiple small hits, but very obvious when you play a drell and get hit by a rocket."

MECoOp,32qp2u,XeRoPHAZON,3,Thu Apr 16 14:39:00 2015 UTC,"I tried using a keyboard/mouse adapter for my 360 and it was very strange trying to move around using 4 keys and then hitting other keys to fire, scope, etc... I did like though that the mouse is much more comfortable in tracking targets and it feels much more natural.  I got 5x the headshots and tripled my accuracy using the mouse but the movement was still awkward.  (Using this setup for Battlefield 3)"
MECoOp,32qp2u,El_Diablito,2,Thu Apr 16 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"That has hands down been my number one hurdle for the transition. I remember when I was a senior in high school, my friends convinced me to get a WoW account and join them, and the thing that jolted me the most was moving with 4 keys. My fingers were simply not used to it; no fluid connection or movement from my character, but I could aim my camera and track targets like it was nothing.   On console, my left hand only has 3 responsibilities: ADS, move, D-Pad, and of those my thumb is the only thing controlling movement AND D-Pad. Now I've got to get my four left fingers to coordinate to produce movement and power usage and my thumb has to govern the lower portion of my keyboard. God it's so familiar and so foreign at the same time."
MECoOp,32qp2u,ProtoKun7,4,Thu Apr 16 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"I wish there was a happy medium because I think movement favors something like a joystick, thumbstick but aiming requires something with more finesse like a mouse.

As a Geth Juggernaut. Okay, maybe that's not in the slightest bit impressive. Does that fact that I spent the first six waves dealing damage with basically nothing but the Hex Shield mitigate that somewhat? I feel like it should, at least a bit.  But on the complaining aspect... I love it when Banshees sync-kill you immediately after teleporting right beside you at the beginning of a round.

I agree that the banshee teleport -> instant sync kill is a super pain in the ass. What frustrates me is that it could be fixed so easily by adding a little timer when the banshee teleports so that the banshee can't sync kill until 3 seconds after a teleport (or make it like other units so that you get melee'd before they can sync kill).

The Turian Ghost Infiltrator with a Kishock likewise annoyed me. Seriously.

Snap Freeze and the AIU's cloak is bugged. If you're not the host and you break cloak with  snap freeze, then you don't get the rank 6 shotgun bonus. It also prevents from fitting the second claymore shot in if you reload cancel.   The consequence is that it is sometimes beneficial to not use Snap Freeze every single time.   Also, if your feeling adventurous, then the best cycle involves reload and animation cancelling. If you use Snap Freeze immediately after firing the Claymore, it will cancel the reload animation, but the gun will still reload. If you then get the timing perfect there is a small window to get a second shot off in the cloak damage window. It's in no way necessary, but worth mentioning."
MECoOp,329y6w,berychance,2,Sun Apr 12 09:13:17 2015 UTC,"IIRC, a variable number of the 8 pellets have a chance to lose the cloak bonus if Snap Freeze breaks the cloak.

BioWare admitted at one point that it was an unintended bug, but justified leaving it in by saying it gave the weapon more personality. On of the BSN forumites made a patch for the Crusader's pcc file that fixes it. It's not even an actual delay, what happens is whenever you fire the Crusader, it immediately hits wherever you were aiming 0.2 seconds ago on PC, or 0.06 to 0.08 seconds ago on console - like a lot of stuff in ME3MP, it's FPS-dependent.

With this I use a light shotgun like the M-22 Eviscerator.   Some other people prefer her with the Claymore, because the tactical cloak/Claymore combo packs a big punch, but I personally don't like the Claymore on agile characters because it's so heavy and has only one shot before reloading."
MECoOp,329y6w,ANiceOakTree,13,Sat Apr 11 23:51:59 2015 UTC,"Weight doesn't matter too much on infiltrators. If you Cloak and Snap Freeze immediately, the cooldown will be fixed at it's lowest, and the one shot with the Claymore will still benefit from the damage boost.    I mean, it's fair to dislike the Claymore, but in this case actual cooldown weight doesn't really play a large part here."
MECoOp,329y6w,Knocking,2,Sun Apr 12 02:02:03 2015 UTC,"The main way I see AIUs used effectively is as a cloak -> shotgun class. If you have the Piranha, Reegar, Raider, Claymore, Crusader, Graal, Geth Plasma Shotgun, or Wraith, then all of these will work extremely well with this setup that skips snap freeze. Just remember that you get the damage boost from cloak for a full 2.5 seconds after breaking cloak, so that should be enough time to get off multiple shotgun shots from anything other than the claymore."
MECoOp,329y6w,Scarecrow1779,6,Sun Apr 12 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"Skipping snap freeze is a mistake. It's a solid debuff even just for you, but it's a huge asset if you're working as a team. It makes everyone else do more damage, and sets up sweet cryo explosions for anyone that can detonate. If I'm running a shotgun build with her, I either skip fitness, or skip the last rank in her shield matrix and drop it into three ranks of fitness; I'm mostly into it for  free revives, so the amount t of shields restored isn't less important.  I'll admit though that your build is probably more friendly to newbs because it is a bit beefier, and skipping snap freeze is one less thing to worry about."
MECoOp,329y6w,Zelcron,2,Sun Apr 12 12:03:50 2015 UTC,"The simplicity and higher beefiness was what I was going for. This way they can get used to using cloak with a shotgun (if they haven't already), and get used to how amazing repair matrix is. Plus, this setup can certainly deal enough damage to top Gold PUG leader boards, even without touching Snap Freeze."
MECoOp,329y6w,Scarecrow1779,2,Sun Apr 12 14:09:03 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I'm not disagreeing with you as the build pertains to OP. It's a god learner build, but it is not necessarily optimal."

MECoOp,329y6w,Scarecrow1779,2,Sun Apr 12 14:20:16 2015 UTC,"I would like to point out that since Snap Freeze is bugged, there is some reason to skip it. With most shotguns off host, you will be doing far more damage without using Snap Freeze than if you did.  The amount of damage that your teammates have to do is something ridiculous to the point that the buff hardly matters, since you'd be melting an Atlas in seconds anyways."
MECoOp,329y6w,berychance,2,Sun Apr 12 19:17:23 2015 UTC,That's fair.  I always forget about that since I skip rank six Tac cloak to run her as a melee character for lulz.

MECoOp,329y6w,carnage_panda,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:08:43 2015 UTC,Wouldn't you snap freeze first to debuff armor? Or is the damage boost to the claymore that much greater that debuff isn't worth it?  Edit: I replied to the wrong comment.

I found one a while ago that set me up for solo runs, and there are others that do well with combos, and so on. Here's what I'd say: repair matrix is really important. Max resistance upgrades, compliment with grenade capacity kit when you get it.  tactical cloak+snap freeze are your bread and butter. Build damage and recharge on cloak, and build the freeze however you see fit. Go all the way to 6 with freeze.  As for stat builders, there's a lot of speculation here. some go 0/6, others do whatever. if you shaved off the last rank of tactical, you can rank some unshackled AI. Fitness for HP is more important, though. Weapon reduction isn't needed with her (I run harrier and black widow with the heavy addons and don't experience any long cooldowns at all).   Strat: if you're in trouble, mash 3. If you get knocked out, it automatically revives you. Take advantage of your mobility, tank a bit for your team mates, and set up your freezes for allies (or you!) to smash through. GLHF.  i remain,  Fyrjefe"

I use a Wraith because I love it's range but Claymore and Reegar can be crazy effective on her too. I love Snap Freeze for it's stagger, debuff, hitting multiple targets and cuz it goes trough walls. I use Geth Scanner for it's situational awareness and to debuff enemies through walls. But you can also just go around blasting random walls wih Snap Freeze and see yourself getting assists all over the place. It's like a lottery of debuff goodness. Grenade gear or shock trooper here is good for having extra repair matrixes but I find having 2 and just hitting ammo boxes often to be enough (she's fast enough to hit them up often) plus you always have Ops Packs in a pinch if you need another repair matrix quickly. Seriously, there is a reason the EDI bot build is the highest rated one of her five or six entries in the Big Bad List of Builds. I'm not a great player but I'm pretty good with her."

If they're struggling to stay alive and need me to missile to bail them out, odds are they aren't doing much damage anyways. Sure, I'll still revive them and try to keep them in the game, but if it's that bad I have more faith in my ability to solo than I do in their ability to contribute effectively.

Your job (as I see it, ymmv) is to run at full speed around the map, killing as many mooks in as short a time as possible.  With rage on the krogans and regen you should be able to do this without taking any cover.  You will also draw tons of aggro from said pretorians/bosses but thats not your job.  If they follow you around, great - just means your teammates can hose them down with bullets without worrying about {butt laser}.  Edit - this post sounds a little preach.  Let me tone it down by saying that melee characters can be made into wonderful boss killers,  you just run the risk of getting constantly sync killed.

MECoOp,3253rw,Utub,5,Fri Apr 10 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"Banshees can sync kill you while their little aura is active.   Brutes when their eyes are glowing red (usually after a charge or melee).   Phantoms don't have a specific visual cue AFAIK, but they are able to once they've done any sort of melee attack from my experience.   With Scions, it's after they've done their heavy melee attack, no visual appearance change either.   Pretorians can sync kill you once they've landed."

If they're in this state and you're in range, you're probably doomed.   The easiest example I can think of is the Atlas. He goes into this mode after doing his big, obvious melee pound. If you back away after he does it, and wait until he starts walking or firing again, you avoid getting sync-killed.   Banshees are something of an exception, though; just about any time they're not mid-attack, they're willing to spear you through the heart."

Banshees won't sync kill you if they are in caster mode, i.e. warpballing you or doing their nova. Once they scream (not the nova scream) they change to teleport mode and will sync kill you.  Any other boss has to do a light melee first (it doesn't have to hit anyone and in the case of the phantom you may not even see the animation if they get staggered but it still counts). As soon as they do another action like shoot you they are safe again. Avoid Preatorians with any melee build unless you are striking the finishing blow because their light melee will stagger you and then you will get sync killed."

He's a short/midrange character that can't roll so I wanted a full health/shield evolution out of Fitness, and BA's defensive bonuses just don't seem worth the longer cooldown on blades, which is an INCREDIBLE crowd control/mook killer with the explosion evolution (double staggers!).   Plus he can Ballistic Blade and heavy melee during the stagger to go full Kenshiro. Just be sure to bring a solid long range weapon for bosses; Incendiary Grenades with the anti-armor evolution go a long way to making him effective on large targets."
MECoOp,3253rw,carnage_panda,2,Tue Apr 14 23:04:36 2015 UTC,"This is how I spec mine but rank 6 on Ballistic Blades and rank 5 on Inferno Grenades is entirely up to personal preference. The Carnifex, Acolyte, Reegar, Paladin, and Hurricane are also all great on him. You use the Ballistic Blades like a shotgun. Ballistic Blades will reliably stagger most enemies, and if you take explosive blades, it will stagger most enemies a second time. this makes it a lot easier to quickly move around the map without taking lots of damage."
MECoOp,3253rw,How_do_I_potato,2,Fri Apr 10 18:15:08 2015 UTC,Your build intrigues me. How often do you find yourself using Blade Armor?
MECoOp,3253rw,Scarecrow1779,2,Fri Apr 10 18:56:01 2015 UTC,"i have it on all the time, but you could easily put those 6 points into fitness and only have a tad less effective health and shields. I just feel like I can use ballistic blades plenty often, even with tech armor active. I could skip tech armor and use a much heavier weapon, but I really enjoy having the power magnifier on the pistol to make my ballistic blades and grenades even more powerful.  btw, /u/Warfy max damage inferno grenades absolutely wreck armor. the way I have mine specced above means that if the grenade is allowed to deal damage its whole 8 second duration, it will deal just under 7000 damage to armor. Multiple grenades will also stack their DoT, so on gold, if you just lob 2 grenades at a full health Brute (13500 armor), it will die without you having to fire a shot."
MECoOp,3253rw,GundalfTheCamo,2,Fri Apr 10 19:14:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes. Love those grenades. I max everything except Armor, and just skip that altogether. My only issue is that I forget to restock on them."
MECoOp,3253rw,How_do_I_potato,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"One handy way to think about it is that an Inferno Grenade against armor is about like having someone shoot a full magazine from a Harrier with Heavy Barrel/Extendo mags/AP IV. Two grenades against anything else is equivalent. (The timing of the damage is also roughly the same, so you're basically giving yourself an extra teammate for a few seconds.)   That's only if you put everything into grenade damage though. I think it's better to go for maximum range. You retain all of your trash-clearing power, but you get a lot of extra leeway on how long you have to get to a spawn and still catch all the enemies with your two grenades. You're doing literally half as much damage to armor, and 30% less damage to everything else, but I think you make up for that by hitting more enemies with each grenade, increasing your overall damage output."
MECoOp,3253rw,CPC324,2,Fri Apr 10 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"I figured I'd give a second opinion on the Batarian Soldier, not because Scarecrow's build isn't good (it is), but because I love the kit. This build is based around Gold, because it tries to minmax around damage thresholds, so you should probably tweak it for Silver.  This is the build I prefer. It is entirely up to you if you want to swap rank 4 of IG and rank 4 of the passive for more weapon damage but less range on the grenades, but I like having 9 meters of awesome.   Why are Inferno Grenades so awesome, you might ask? Because they two-shot Phantoms and every other non-boss enemy except Ravagers. Ravagers will either take a third grenade if you need to run quickly, or a few bullets if you can spare the time. Or, if you need a stagger to get away safely, you can pop them with Ballistic Blades and probably get the kill.   The playstyle is pretty simple: run up to spawn, throw two grenades, launch Ballistic Blades, run to next spawn. If you see a Phantom, hit her with a couple of grenades and Ballistic Blades to the face if you need to run past her.   Your grenades are really not that great for bosskilling, so toss one to start the fight if it's like a Brute or something, but I prefer to use them to clear trash. You can spec for full damage/armor damage on them, but I have found it to be kind of underwhelming, because of the way grenades are designed in this game. Weapons will almost always be your best bet for single-target dps, the only advantage grenades give you is hitting multiple targets. Don't waste it.  Edit to add: INFERNO GRENADES DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT WALLS, EITHER. COVER CAN'T SAVE YOU FROM FIERY DEATH, PUNY TROOPERS!"
MECoOp,3253rw,euxneks,3,Fri Apr 10 20:38:34 2015 UTC,Dunno what you're talking about. Inferno grenades eat bosses.
MECoOp,3253rw,SilverNightingale,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:52:16 2015 UTC,"I guess I could have worded that part better. They're good for killing bosses, but they're absolutely amazing at killing mooks. They aren't underwhelming compared to other things at killing bosses, but killing bosses with them is underwhelming compared to killing minions with them. Using two or three to help you kill a boss helps a lot, but those grenades could have wiped out an entire spawn of minions. It isn't a big deal on maps that give double grenades, but on a map like Glacier, especially if you have like a TGI on the team, it can be an issue."
MECoOp,3253rw,Scarecrow1779,2,Sat Apr 11 20:54:40 2015 UTC,i like the build. more weapon damage makes him more flexible and the large area inferno grenades provide a lot more crowd control (and with ballistic blades would still kill any shielded mook). The main reason I don't use a build like this on my BatSol is because I already have an Inferno Grenade and Harrier toting class in my Krogan Soldier.
MECoOp,3253rw,DependencyTree,2,Sat Apr 11 12:00:44 2015 UTC,Last two ranks of passives and last rank in health are not better than than 5 ranks of blade armor.   So my build is 56645. It's got ridiculous shield recharge speed and run'n'gun playstyle keeps you alive really well.
MECoOp,3253rw,Name213whatever,1 point,Sat Apr 11 12:49:26 2015 UTC,"Blade Armor is great, but you need rank 5 of the passive to hit a damage threshold on your grenades to 2-shot Phantoms. I could see sacrificing rank 5 of fitness, but I like spamming Ballistic Blades a little bit too much."
MECoOp,3253rw,darzinth,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:49:54 2015 UTC,You gotta pick your fights and be able to read when your enemies are getting ready to wreck you.

I think if you learn good positioning and teamwork, and have high levels of any rarity. A level 20 Female Human Adept with a level X silver weapon is really potent. I have read threads from the past with people asking ""what do I need to get to gold?"" and people answering having a certain score, or high level loadouts.

Troll Mode Activated  Specifically made to look very similar to the regular Dragoon. BioWare wisely made it so a 1:1 replica is impossible; the helmets can never be made to match (Cerberus' are black with gold, turncoats are full gold) and the armour colour/pattern can't be perfectly replicated.

MECoOp,31zhbg,Harrysmb,8,Thu Apr 9 10:59:44 2015 UTC,"I'll just throw a few builds out there for you:  Asari Justicar Adept mainly using reave to deal massive damage to armor and barriers and the Executioner with Phasic or Warp ammo will deal massive damage to mooks. For the largest threats, reave -> bubble to detonate -> reave for another detonation. This build makes many threats like Praetorians and Phantoms simple, even on Gold, since reave goes right through guardian shields and power blocking bubble shields. A reave user like this is a huge boon to a biotic-combo team since reave both primes and detonates.  Krogan Soldier focuses on using carnage, inferno grenades, and fire explosions to deal massive damage to armor, as well as AoE damage to clean out mooks. Disruptor or Phasic rounds really help this class to clean out shields and barriers so that the high armor damage can kick in. The low ammo capacity of the Harrier also goes great with this class since you'll already be hitting up the ammo boxes regularly to get grenades.  N7 Destroyer Soldier has insanely good weapon damage, high power multifrag grenades, and gives no shits about cool down speeds. Use with any heavy hitting weapon you want. Also is entertaining to have an Executioner Pistol with a 2 round magazine.  Male Quarian Engineer is played pretty much the same as the Krogan Soldier. Incinerate -> Arc Grenade for fire explosions and lots of armor damage. For solitary mooks, just Incinerate to stagger, then mow them down with the Harrier. This build is one of the best area detonators available for a tech-combo team.  N7 Paladin is all about the Cryo Explosions. Make sure to take the 6A evolution on snap freeze because the Paladin's snap freeze is bugged so that you already get the +100% combo damage. This guy is the ultimate tech primer and is complemented very well by anybody that can detonate multiple targets, like with chain overload. You lead the team, freezing everything in your path. Just remember that you are a bit squishy, so use cover and drain shields with Energy Drain whenever possible to get that sweet, sweet damage reduction. The Executioner gives you a power amplifier, good all-purpose damage at range, and an easy way to deal with guardians.  Turian Ghost Infiltrator just spews out assault riffle damage like there's no tomorrow. Just activate cloak every time you're off cool down and keep hitting up ammo boxes. Use a stim pack if you lose shields. The arc pistol is a lightweight pistol you can keep for a backup, and a charged headshot with cloak still deals massive damage.  Alliance Infiltration Unit. Step 1: Cloak. Step 2: Claymore. Step 3: …? Step 4: Profit.  N7 Slayer Vanguard is a brokenly powerful AoE damage dealer if you can just stay alive. Charge to get your shields back and get the power damage buff, then shoot phase disruptor at the ground near enemies. It has a 5.2 meter impact radius and deals 2000 damage to armor. When you get low on shields, charge and repeat. Have fun getting more kills than the rest of your team combined. The main threat to this class is bosses that can stagger you at range, such as Geth Primes and Atlases. Do not engage a group of enemies when you are in range of these bosses, because the boss will stagger you, then the group of mooks will down you. Get the group of enemies away from the boss, then kill one or the other. Phantoms are also a piece of cake with this class since your charge staggers them out of their defensive bubble and a phase disruptor's large area of effect makes it easy to hit them, even when they try to cloak and run away. Kill guardians with ease by simply shooting Phase Disruptor at the ground behind them.  Hope some of those help. Enjoy."

MECoOp,31zhbg,berychance,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:01:20 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend the Paladin. It's a 2/3 Shot pistol. Very powerful, a little more forgiving than the executioner."
MECoOp,31zhbg,SilverNightingale,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:00:23 2015 UTC,One thing I would highly recommend is to only play the Slayer if you're the host. It's one of those classes that kind of lives on a razor's edge and a bit of lag can make your day unpleasant.
MECoOp,31zhbg,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:31:11 2015 UTC,"Reave only does massive damage to armor/barriers if you cast the bubble.  I don't use her in Gold PUGs anymore because That GuyTM with Warp/Shockwave/Dark Channel won't take a hint and prime/detonate with me, and I end up spending more time reinitiating the bubble to prime/detonate myself rather than actually synergizing with That GuyTM."
MECoOp,31zhbg,El_Diablito,3,Thu Apr 9 13:44:12 2015 UTC,"I play this class on gold without depending on detonations all the time. Without even using consumable gear, a single reave cast is dealing 412 damage per second to armor (549/sec to barriers). I can cast it ever 2.22 seconds, which means I can easily stack it the max of 3 times on a scion or praetorian before my first cast ends (7.8 second duration). This means that reave alone is dealing 1236 damage per second to armor and 1647 damage per second to barriers. Throw in a shot from the Executioner in between each cast of reave (another 1500 damage) and even the largest bosses die pretty quickly without  biotic detonations.    For reference, a gold banshee has around 10,000 barriers and 17,000 armor. Without even firing my pistol or using the bubble, i can still take down a gold banshee in 23 seconds. I'd call that massive damage.  This really is a good way to play this class in PUG lobbies, because if you don't have to depend on biotic detonations, it means you'll never get pissed because That Other Guy™ shot your target with disruptor ammo right before you tried to detonate."
MECoOp,31zhbg,Scarecrow1779,2,Thu Apr 9 14:16:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't know her reave stacks.  I'll have to give her another shot.  I was trying to rely on the bubble but from your example I can see there is another way to play her.. Cool, thanks."
MECoOp,31zhbg,El_Diablito,2,Thu Apr 9 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"ya, i didn't realize until about 2 months ago how good reave is. You can get more single target DPS if you spec the 4th evolution differently, but I always take the area effect so that when a bunch of enemies get clumped together in a choke point, you're hitting all of them."
MECoOp,31zhbg,Scarecrow1779,2,Thu Apr 9 15:14:16 2015 UTC,So since you're not trying to wait on bosses and whatnot to get into your bubble would it make sense to spec it for damage reduction and leave it around you if you've taken a good position instead?
MECoOp,31zhbg,El_Diablito,2,Thu Apr 9 15:18:47 2015 UTC,"you could, but i always feel like as soon as i set up a defensive bubble, there's some reason to get out of it like a possessed abomination or grenade in your face. That's why I use offensive bubbles, and only on slow enemies like ravagers, scions, primes, and the occasional praetorian that is using it's eye lasers."
MECoOp,31zhbg,ginja_ninja,2,Thu Apr 9 15:22:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, good point.  I find in Gold I'm repositioning a lot to not get flanked so the defense bubble wouldn't help.  I think I'm going to give her a shot tonight and try to use the offensive bubble in strategic spots and keep in mind her reave stacks.  Cool, thanks for the head up again.    I find I'm either playing the Turian Ghost or the Geth Infiltrator for gold but they're kind of similar in playstyles so I'd like to have some variety for Gold."
MECoOp,31zhbg,SilverNightingale,2,Thu Apr 9 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"If you equip an acolyte she can easily handle herself with pull/reave against most enemies. You only need 3 or 4 points in pull (it can be nice to have radius on it). That said, I feel drell adept is a little better for this style because he's got clusters to add burst damage vs. armor.  Probably the best way to play justicar is as a biotic soldier. Use something like a harrier with warp ammo IV and other people detonating your reaves will just be a bonus to the infiltrator-level weapon damage you're dealing rather than a necessity."
MECoOp,31zhbg,ginja_ninja,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:10:33 2015 UTC,"You can only charge/fire the Acolyte (to strip shields/barriers) so fast, though. Reave/Pull doesn't do anything against those."
MECoOp,31zhbg,carnage_panda,2,Thu Apr 9 23:56:24 2015 UTC,"The trick is to run around with it charged, then you just have to release to get the first shot. Properly specced it oneshots all shields and barriers on every difficulty. Immediately start holding down the fire button again after releasing. Believe me, ""so fast"" is a better way of describing it than you might think.  It basically means you never have to worry about trading fire with enemies like geth hunters or phantoms like you would relying on weapon damage because you can incapacitate them into zero-g almost instantaneously. It's devastating."
MECoOp,31zhbg,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:01:43 2015 UTC,I only use the bubble on bosses for the damage bonus. Reave for priming for the warp ammo bonus.  I also have an acolyte strapped to her for that extreme case of the phantom so I don't have her backflipping all over the fucking place. I swear gymnasts are my sworn enemies now. One acolyte shot and a pull then detonate with reave and she's done.  Also with reave's damage reduction and a cyclonic 4 she's one of the beefiest classes out there.

MECoOp,31zhbg,Zelcron,2,Sun Apr 12 14:00:20 2015 UTC,"Asari Huntress is good and pretty easy to use. This is my preferred setup. Just make sure dark channel is always active somewhere, and spam warp. Of course, never cast a biotic power with cloaking immediately beforehand. I like the Adas because it's easy to keep up a steady stream of damage during cooldowns. It compensates for your relative weakness against shields; it staggers and deals area damage; and it lets you play mid to long range pretty much all the time. I mix up the second weapon slot for kicks, since recharge speed is irrelevant, but usually it's a shotgun or some kind of close range panic option.    A personal favorite which I don't see in gold much is the Female Quarian Engineer. Her damage output is surprisingly high, for a class without big weapon boosts or the ability to self-detonate explosions. One sequence Cryo Blast > Acoltye > Incinerate will kill most mooks, shielded or not, alone or in groups, in less than 2 seconds. She slows and debuffs for the whole team. Some people poo-poo the turret, but I wouldn't leave home without it. She's squishy, but quick, so keep moving and pay attention."
MECoOp,31zhbg,briefcandle,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"While I still spec into cryo blast to debuff bosses, I just slap cryo ammo on the Acolyte. Because it is a projectile weapon it almost always procs, and most people have tons of it. That way you skip a step."

Good way to turn a health-only enemy into a useful explosion that damages other, tougher enemies nearby, rather than just killing the health-only enemy with weapons fire."
MECoOp,31zhbg,Scarecrow1779,2,Thu Apr 9 16:40:59 2015 UTC,"That's true. Shattering mooks is a blast and great for clearing them out and dealing a little splash damage.

MECoOp,31zhbg,Rakham_le_rouge,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:16:53 2015 UTC,"you can still use the turret's flamethrower, followed by incinerate, to set off a fire explosion, but it's extremely tricky to time right."

MECoOp,31zhbg,PsychedelicPill,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"Any infiltrator or biotic combo  focused class is at least reasonably viable.  For infiltrators (aside from the shadow and huntress), you generally want at least 4 ranks in cloak.  Make sure you take the damage evolution at rank 4.  If you are using the right weapon, the rank 6 damage evolution is also worthwhile.  Beyond that, focus on weapon damage passives and anything else you want -- you can't really go wrong here.  Powers with decent cc or damage taken evolutions are best, but almost anything is viable.  Slap on a good weapon and you are all set -- the black widow, javelin, piranha, claymore, raider, and harrier are all very solid options.  Most biotic combo classes (some of my favorites are the base asari adept, human adept, and fury) want to go 6/6/6/5/3 or 6/6/6/4/4, since biotic combo damage is based on the ranks of the skills used.  You generally want biotic combo damage and damage taken evolutions (though the fury gets good mileage out of the movespeed evolution on annihilation field).  Passives are generally focused on power damage and weight.  Add on an acolyte and an smg (preferably a hurricane) with warp ammo, and you are all set.  In a pinch, a talon would also work here.  You really want near 200% power recharge, so weapon weight mods are useful."

She's good at reviving others thanks to those same qualities. She also deals decent shotgun damage. I prefer the Wraith over Claymore for quicker cool down and less reload canceling, plus it has pretty darn good range for a shotgun.   I've always used this build from the BBLoB in the sidebar and have never looked back. She's in my top three favorite characters to play: http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/199m95/imnotaswfanboys_edi_bot_build/  I also like Geth Scanner gear since Snap Freeze goes through walls and you barely need to aim it.

Fire a sub net, immediately begin charging the Graal. Either A - you snag them, or B - they dodge it. If A, easy headshot. Graal has a large headshot multiplier and ignores shieldgate, equals dead mook. It's laser accurate, doesn't kill your cooldowns, and can be rapid-fired against bosses. If they dodge, simply follow their predictable movement and release your Graal shot when they recover. Finish them off with Shockwave and uncharged shots.   I usually use Incendiary so I can self-detonate fire explosions and tech bursts, along with BE's from teammates."

And of course a little bit of Blade Armor for looking cool.  As far as I know the choice of BatSent itself is pretty uncommon.

In a typical Gold PUG, i can reliably get one of the top 2 scores with at least half the classes in the game. Plat I'd never go into with out top level gear though.   I like the BatSent, but I play it in a weird way. I skip submission net and use it only when I'm off host (because SubNet is so awful at hitting targets when not hosting). I use the Harrier and mainly deal weapon damage with Shockwave for staggering. If I have a teammate like somebody with Chain Overload, Flamer, Snap Freeze, Annihilation Field, Warp, Reave, or even just Incinerate, I'll follow them around detonating for them.

I only ever play off host and have no problems being the top score, though that might be more of a comment on the other players than myself... And the ""awful at hitting"" thing is exactly what I use about it. It triggers their dodge and you just one-shot them with the Claymore. They're locked into it and you practically can't miss. Actually netting them and stunning a pack of enemies is a bonus, imo.  It's easy to top score in gold with randoms, it just takes too long when they're all dead constantly. Often it feels like a disproportionate amount of work. If I wanted to solo, I wouldn't be looking for a lobby with three other people to make it take longer."

This does get me thinking about a melee Krogan Soldier built around purging Fortification to get that +100% melee damage boost, though. Something like this maybe? That would deal more than enough damage to 1 shot a Silver Pyro, and would be good enough to kill a Gold Pyro with 1 shot from the Wraith and a Heavy Melee. After you deactivate Fortification, you get the melee buff for 20 seconds, but with a low power cool down, you can turn Fortification right back on, so you get the huge melee boost, while still getting 35% damage reduction combined with the reduced shield recharge time. Everything you need to keep your rage up.  Can you imagine a Melee Geth Infiltrator if it had Fortification instead of Proxy Mine? The damage would be fucking insane."

Use the Cabal's huge mobility and free shields to just jump right into the fray and headshot everything at close range. Two-shot Executioner N7 Destroyer. The Harry Callahan. Lots of fun with Phasic Ammo for one-shot kills. The Executioner isn't capable of one-shot kills in Gold due to shieldgate (use the Arc Pistol instead), but this is a ton of fun on Silver. Melee base Human Adept. Gets surprisingly good heavy melee damage, and the animation is awesome. As Xcal shows, you can do it on Gold, but it's tricky to pull off.

MECoOp,31s9zc,phantuba,2,Sat Apr 11 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"It does not for most shielded enemies.  Ammo powers do not benefit from any damage increases (or headshot multipliers) and only work on a weapon's base damage. Phasic III and Executioner X gives 1472 shield/barrier damage. On Gold, the only unit with low enough shields to one-shot is the Geth Rocket Trooper. Everything else has 1500+ shields (unfortunately), so you'll hit the shield-gate and have to use a second Executioner shot to actually kill.  Trust me, I've tried one-shot Executioner builds on Gold several times."
MECoOp,31s9zc,Photovoltaic,3,Sat Apr 11 01:50:16 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that /u/carnage_panda is taking the bottom evolution of stasis (increase all damage to target by 50%), which does increase the damage phasic ammo deals (up to like 2200).

MECoOp,31s7go,Adsealedxi,11,Tue Apr 7 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"The Juggernaut was the first class I used to venture into gold, and my main pieces of advice would be to stick close to your team, plan your movements ahead of time because you're slow, and to not get caught out in the open.  The reason you stick close to your team is because you are a support class. You're the one that walks out, melees the phantom to death, puts up a hex shield, and revives your downed teammate. Your other important role when with the team is to make enemies get stuck in choke points so they are easy targets for any AoE powers or weapons with penetration. Part of your goal as a support class is to make your teammates more effective that they would be without you.   Damage goes up a lot from silver to gold, and the number of bosses goes up. This means you can get stuck out in the open and get downed really easily if you start blindly walking towards an objective. It could happen something like this: You start getting hit by a pair of Ravagers, so you melee the nearest cannibal or brute to get more shields. Next you end up stuck in a cycle of staying stuck out in the open and having to stay out in the open to grab an enemy and recharge your shields. This cycle ends with you going down where your teammates can't get to you. The way you avoid this is by being cautious about where you walk and when, and by planning ahead (for example, at the end of wave 5, move towards the center of the map so you won't have to walk across as much of the map to get to the next objective). This tip also means don't just walk straight towards that Geth Prime that's sitting 20 meters in front of you. You might be able to survive its fire, but not the 2 hunters and a pyro that are just around the corner waiting for you next to the prime. Move between soft cover, if it's available, while picking your way towards your target. Always have a retreat path in mind.  Both of these tips come back to one essential point, as well: you aren't killing things as fast as you were in Silver. In Silver and Bronze, you can stand in the middle of a field and melee things all day and that'll be enough of a distraction and enough damage output that you'll be a credit to team. In Gold, your melee simply doesn't deal enough damage. You will get surrounded by bosses that will kill you if you're away from your teammates because you simply can't kill them fast enough. You have to be doing something other than just dealing damage with melee. This could take the form of playing team medic with a Geth Heal Turret or making sure to find and melee every phantom that ever got anywhere near your team. It can also take the form of holding enemies in choke points where your teammates can easily damage the enemies, but the enemies can't get to your teammates. It can also take the form of playing a weapon based Juggernaut (Please only do this with VERY HIGH DAMAGE WEAPONS. Otherwise, you are even more useless than a melee-only jug because you can't stay alive as well).    The Krogan Vanguard was the first class I soloed gold with, and my main advice there is to know the limits of what you can and can't tank, don't charge recklessly into clumps of enemies unless you are very sure about how many there are and if you can tank them, and to always use shield boosters because they make the class infinitely more tanky.  Whether you go for a Charge/Melee or Charge/Shotgun build is up to you. Both are very viable and operate in largely the same fashion. I even have a friend who uses the detonation damage from barrier as his main source of damage and he does surprisingly well on gold, often outscoring myself and friends who are used to leading gold and platinum PUG leader boards.     The other general advice for any class that you will probably see a ton on this thread is to use equipment every match, especially when you're getting used to gold. It shows your teammates you are invested in winning and will also keep you alive while you're getting used to the higher difficulty when you'd certainly die without the equipment.  Good luck and happy hunting.  PS: please don't be a bad jug that goes down in the middle of a field of enemies and does nothing for his teammates. then i'll have to respond to yet another post or comment on this sub about how the Jug is a terrible class."
MECoOp,31s7go,Scarecrow1779,3,Tue Apr 7 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"I've always tried to support my team (healing or not) when I play bronze and silver, I figured it was just common cortousy, especially since I hate collectors and don't want to be stuck on my own against them.   I'm trying to earn more weapons so I'm saving for Arsenal packs, any shotguns you'd recommend specifically to use, cause my phaeston is mainly there for if I run out of ammo on the arc and don't realize it until my team is trying to kill a praetorian as quickly as possible.  Is it a viable strategy to be fighting a boss, and go and full-melee it to death from behind if it doesn't seem to have noticed you whatsoever. (Which on a side-note, bothers me a bit, cause you figured they'd target the big guy at least attempting to draw some aggro, I mean this is a video game, so I'm obviously overthinking it).

MECoOp,31s7go,Arcalane,2,Tue Apr 7 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"I've had a lot of success with the Claymore myself, but the one-shot-reload leaves something to be desired. The Reegar is a beast of a gun (with a range of about arm's-length) if you can get your hands on it.  Aside from those, the humble Katana isn't too shabby (although I doubt it performs so well on Gold) and the Eviscerator/Raider strike a middle ground between that and the Claymore in terms of firepower and ammo capacity - though I've personally found them somewhat underwhelming even with the high-caliber barrel mods.  If you're taking a Phaeston, always always always use either drill/AP ammo, or a piercing mod/HV barrel. As fun as it is in SP, the poor thing suffers greatly against armoured targets (especially on Gold) so you need to be able to counter as much of their defense as possible and preferably aim for the head."

MECoOp,31s7go,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:13:43 2015 UTC,"i use the Piranha with smart choke and high caliber barrel on my Krogan Vanguard with Weapon Synergy on Charge. I use that gun because it deals great damage but is still super light so you can charge as often as possible. I've tried it with the Raider, Claymore, Reegar, and Graal but liked the Piranha the best. The Raider and Reegar are probably next in line for my favorite because I deal more weapon damage, but I go down more often too because I can't charge as often.  On the Juggernaut, you can take 3 approaches to your weapons setup. You can go for a weapon damage build, putting on a heavy hitting weapon like the typhoon or spitfire (avoid low ammo weapons because your speed makes it difficult to reliably make it to ammo boxes). You can also go for a Melee focused build and have a shotgun with an Omniblade for the best melee damage. The last major option is to use a power-focused build using a pistol like the Acolyte with a Power Magnifier and melee stunner. This last option gives you very little weapon damage, but gives a moderate increase in melee damage and a big increase in the damage your siege pulse can deal out. I mostly use the Geth Plasma Shotgun with High Caliber Barrel and Omniblade V, but get my ranged damage from Siege Pulse. I've also used the Pistol/Power build effectively on Platinum as well.  As far as agro and fighting bosses goes, most of the time, if you melee something, it will then focus on you. What I meant by not fighting bosses and just sitting there meleeing was mainly referring to being aware of your positioning. If you're attacking a boss while you're away from your team, then it's going to take you a long time to get back to them and you aren't helping them be more effective. If you're with your team and a boss is threatening them, melee away. Maybe you'll even kill it on your own. The important part is that you're fulfilling some role other than simply melee damage. You're playing a positional role by keeping enemies off of teammates and keeping bosses where they can be easily picked off by teammates without the teammates being in danger.  Happy to help. Hopefully these tips can keep you from having to go through as much trial and error as I did learning to be effective with the Jug. If you like playing a weapon focused jug, other people can give better advice on gameplay tips, but I'm pretty experienced with the Melee/Power-focused jug. This is the exact setup I use on Platinum PUGs. Also, one last note on the Omniblade: the extra weight from the shotgun Omniblade is only applied successfully to the Piranha and Reegar. Once you're in the map, all other shotguns will still give you the melee damage boost without giving you the extra 50 points of weight.  EDIT: Sry, i keep thinking of more little tips. If your jug uses siege pulse as a big source of damage, then you should be sure to play as host. when on host, you can fire off your siege pulses in half the time it takes to fire them off when not host. This dramatically increases your ranged damage output."
MECoOp,31s7go,Arcalane,2,Wed Apr 8 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"Please only do this with VERY HIGH DAMAGE WEAPONS. Otherwise, you are even more useless than a melee-only jug because you can't stay alive as well.   As someone who regularly plays as Juggernaut, what would you consider to be 'ideal' weapons for a gun platform & support role, then? I've been using the Typhoon for Silver and it seems to do reasonably well on Gold too. Not very ammo-efficient but I can casually eat up bosses with sustained fire."
MECoOp,31s7go,GundalfTheCamo,3,Tue Apr 7 21:41:22 2015 UTC,"Particle Rifle, Lancer, Typhoon and Geth Spitfire are probably the best. The first two don't need ammo boxes and last two carry a lot of ammo.   With Lancer and Particle Rifle you have constant damage output since you can shoot your Siege Pulse when they're recharging.   BTW the gun platform is the more useful way of playing Juggy, don't get into that constant shield drain BS. It's ineffective. Drain if you absolutely need, but otherwise use cover peek and blast away. Corners and turret will keep you easily alive."
MECoOp,31s7go,Arcalane,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:53:30 2015 UTC,"I play gun platform/support pretty much exclusively, using max shield/pulse (for DR, and sometimes CC), and the +10% team damage aura effect (not that anyone seems to stay close enough for it to work). Just a case of finding good guns to go with it since my roster is still pretty bare."
MECoOp,31s7go,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"I'd have to disagree with that statement about weapon vs melee focused jugs. In all the Platinum i've played, I have never seen a weapon focused jug work well unless a melee focused jug was blocking for it. I've outscored many weapon focused jugs with my melee/power jug in Platinum and Gold PUGs.  Often, if it doesn't have another beefy unit blocking for it, I see weapon focused jugs get trapped into the melee cycle, but because they're weapon focused, they can't deal enough damage with their melee to buy time to get away and start shooting again."
MECoOp,31s7go,GundalfTheCamo,2,Wed Apr 8 00:13:41 2015 UTC,"Well I've never seen a melee juggy do well on points.   I don't know the math, but I'd be surprised if the melee can even theoretically come close to, say, the Particle Rifle. Then you have to account for opportunity loss because melee is close range while a weapon can cause damage at range."
MECoOp,31s7go,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:12:24 2015 UTC,"This is the setup that I use on platinum. It's the setup I use when I have shit teammates that would be plenty challenged on gold. It's the class I use when I know I'll be reviving a teammate ever 15 seconds, all game long. I take them to Firebase Ghost and hang out where the 1 is in this picture of the map. I clog the door leading to the out the front and occasionally walk inside to kill a flanking phantom or hunter, or a brute coming from the other side. Even when I have teammates that are worth a shit, I still score very well with this kit, making the top half of the score board almost every Plat PUG I use it in.  The strength enhancer is something you usually don't see bad jugs use, and it's something I never go without. The Omniblade V also really helps. When I'm not meleeing, I'm dealing decent damage at range with Siege Pulse. If I'm meleeing a boss and don't have too much damage hitting me, I'll quickly unload all my siege pulses on it for extra damage, reload my siege pulse charges, then continue meleeing. I also make sure to always have a hex shield up for the extra 10% damage (you really need it to make up for the damage lost in the fitness tree). Most of the time, I put my hex shield in the middle of a wall so it's not in the way of my teammates. At the end of waves 2, 5, and 9, I walk up into the center of the map so I'm closer to any objective that needs doing. I have been the sole survivor on Plat more times that I can count because I stay away from the landing zone and when the time is right, do a lap around the map, with enemies following me and walk into the landing zone without a scratch on me at 10 seconds to go."
MECoOp,31s7go,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Wed Apr 8 09:42:32 2015 UTC,"I assume you're talking about a weapon focused jug. If so, then the typhoon is a perfect choice. The Spitfire is also a great choice because of the racial bonus giving you +5% damage on beth weapons. I've also seen Particle Rifles be pretty effective on Jugs. I would recommend avoiding the Harrier though. Because of the jug's low speed, you will spend a lot of time out of ammo, walking towards a box.  If you're talking about for any play style of jug, I prefer to use a shotgun with an omniblade for max melee damage or a pistol with a melee stunner and power magnifier. one of my other comments on this thread has more details on those setups if you're interested."
MECoOp,31s7go,BadBoyMcCoY,3,Wed Apr 8 00:06:18 2015 UTC,I can't remember what it stands for exactly but a pug game is a public game with random strangers.  As for tips the main one is just keep practicing. Most other players have sunk 100s of hours into the game so they know it well.  Use a character you are good with and make sure you use your consumables and equipment. If you are low on medigel you can always get a jumbo equipment pack which is guaranteed to have at least 5 medigel as well as 5 each of the other consumables. Like you say teamwork is important try to stick with at least one other player. Some characters work well together.  Also learn how to prime and detonate the different explosion types.

Beware, other tanky characters (most notably, the Krogans) are NOT so fortunate, so don't build bad habits.  Meleeing is viable, but you should be more careful.   Generally in PUGs, especially during objective rounds, you shouldn't be ""that one guy"" who lone wolfs and then gets killed far away from the rest of the team. If you want to play as a flanker or with a bit of distance, have medigel ready and more importantly, don't roam so far that your teammates can't help you and vice-versa.

MECoOp,31s7go,Arcalane,3,Tue Apr 7 23:14:45 2015 UTC,"One thing I see a lot of people forget in Silver (and sometimes even in Gold) is that you have a goddamn rocket launcher strapped to your back 24/7. It's right there but people seem to forget it exists!  Here's the thing; that sucker has no self damage or friendly fire damage, and it has a deceptively large area of effect. If you're about to get surrounded by more dudes than you can tank with Heavy Melee, do not hesitate to whip that thing out and fire it at your feet; you'll flatten everything around you in a glorious fireball. You might even get a Killstreak medal!  Also fun fact; if you go down whilst heavy melee is engaged, hold down the melee button- it'll keep working. Whilst it won't revive you (although it would be amazing if it did), you can sometimes get a kill whilst incapacitated, and it means there's one less enemy near your body that might go for an Execution/stop an ally from reviving you."
MECoOp,31s7go,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:01:58 2015 UTC,"I try to avoid using it in some ways cause I feel like it's a cheap cop-out. It shouldn't be either, I always use it if I'm being overwhelmed by multiple bosses and a small army of grunts. I just feel so compelled to not use it because there are so many bronze players who use it at the first sight of a brute. Though I will definitely try to keep it handy more often in gold if need be.   Also I will heavily keep that in mind, might take some getting used to, but if it can help keep me from being curbstomped, it's my new best friend."
MECoOp,31s7go,carnage_panda,3,Wed Apr 8 07:31:32 2015 UTC,I feel like heavy weapons could get more use or be less forgettable if they'd taken the ME2 approach and let us select our heavy weapon. That way you could start out with the Cobra but unlock the flamer or the old arc projector or whatever.

I know for-sure that it can make Banshees and Cerberus' Atlas units stagger at certain points (although it's not guaranteed). I didn't believe the latter until I tried it myself, and it works on the former through personal experience. No idea how well it works on other heavies.  Aside from that, remember that the LM isn't throttled by the HM cooldown, so you can give someone an electric high-five whilst your heavy melee is recharging to chip off a little health and maybe stun them for a moment, then re-initiate the geth hug."

If you're stuck in a shit escort path or have bosses running at your hack circle, it's handy to use a few. Generally I wait a sec to see if anyone else is about to missile, and if they don't, I go for it.  Clearing the area to revive a downed teammate. If you've got a shitton of praetorians and swarms and scions and collector captains in the area and it's just me and this guy left because the other two got stomped or synced, you can bet I will blast the field and pick him up so it's not just me. Of course if it's the guy who has already gone down 8 times this wave alone and won't take the hint to stick with you, you might just cut your losses.  Ending waves. I stay away from the LZ to drag shit around the map, but sometimes there will be stuff in your way and you can't account for teammates hanging around too close to the LZ. But fuck getting synced bu a phantom in the LZ. I don't care if it's just one (is it ever just one?) I'll pop a missile just in case.

You learn the importance of knowing spawn points in a hurry, or you die. You learn how to time when you're about to get flanked, or you die. It's a great way to learn. Especially with really tanky/ forgiving characters like the two you mentioned. You screw up and get hurt, but they're too tanky to die. So you learn, and still have fun with the game. It's a great middle ground."
MECoOp,31s7go,Scarecrow1779,2,Wed Apr 8 05:32:20 2015 UTC,"Use armor piercing ammo on any and all weapons.  Armor reduction is much higher than in lower difficulties.

MECoOp,31s7go,carnage_panda,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:49:01 2015 UTC,"A bunch of weapons naturally bypass armour, and a lot of kits or mods can take care of it too.

MECoOp,31loou,Pac-man94,9,Fri Apr 10 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"Everyone says GI because GI, but really if you're new to sniping an Infiltrator class with a staggering power may be easier to start with (FQI, SI, TGI). Female Quarian Infiltrator is IMO a great ""training wheels"" class for a new sniper, as Sabotage is a very reliable stagger and she doesn't have any bullshit ""get-out-of-jail-free"" cards like TGI Stims to teach you bad habits. Salarian Infiltrator is also very good and more forgiving with Energy Drain, and Proximity Mine is much more useful overall than Stickies. I'd run him like this. You're plenty fine running him with just a Mantis too. It's the only common weapon that is actually serviceable on higher difficulties. I've topped Gold lobbies easily with this exact setup (and some consumables: I highly recommend Phasic Ammo for one-hit kills if you are playing on Silver or Gold).  For a support class I'd say go with the Geth Engineer. Great overall class that can provide healing with his turret. I'm a fan of /u/AaronEh's Certified Awesome build (setup). The Geth Engineer works well with any Tech team and can output a good amount of healing by spamming out turrets (it's faster than waiting for the built-in timer since every time a new turret spawns, it heals, as seen in an explanatory video here). Any decent weapon will do, though likely you want something that is rather high powered for bosses since you'll have Overload to strip shields and cc mooks.  You can run any of the Volus classes as support with their Shield Boost power, but I wouldn't really recommend it as they are quite fragile and are somewhat tricky to handle. If you do decide to try a Volus, I'd suggest this build, though I'm a bit biased since I wrote it. It's quite effective though, again up through Gold."
MECoOp,31loou,reivision,3,Mon Apr 6 12:48:49 2015 UTC,"Well the GI has proxy mines for the free stagger and it's a damage steroid as well. It basically does what the other snipers do, but better.

MECoOp,31loou,RCK0,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:49:31 2015 UTC,I was tempted to mention your exact volus build in my own comment. I was also thinking of this volus engi build for a similar build. The difference would be that the engi build would require more focus and skill to get headshots without stasis (but you could use the stager from proxy mine). The advantage of the engi over the adept in this case would be that the engi is better at taking on armored targets. The one huge advantage your headhunter adept build has is that it can deal with phantoms far better than the engi can.
MECoOp,31loou,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:23:33 2015 UTC,"The one little problem with sabotage is that it doesn't stop phantoms and make them bubble, which can make lining up a shot on them much more difficult and get you killed.

Even if you don't drain any shields, it's still a hitscan stun that allows you to line up a headshot easily. As for a medic, the Volus classes are all solid choices, but which one is up for debate. Adept gets the fastest shield boosts but sacrifices almost all offensive power. What sort of medic were you thinking of?"

For support, the volus classes are the de facto support classes due to their shield boost, but you could also use something like a juggernaut or geth engineer for their turret (plus the juggernaut's hex shield and passive boosts to nearby friendlies) or the demolisher for the supply pylon (shields, grenades, and ammo)."
MECoOp,31loou,Scarecrow1779,2,Mon Apr 6 08:13:41 2015 UTC,"For support, the Volus, Juggernaut and AIU have already been mentioned, but I would point out that in most situations, any class with a cloak can be a good class for picking people up. If you're going to use a Volus though, learn to use your cloak. Your cloak runs on a separate cool down from your powers and will keep you alive in most cases without using your shield boost, which means you can use other powers like decoy, combat drone, stasis, proxy mine, or biotic charge. The time to use shield boost is when you hear a teammate yell out a phrase like 'Shields down!' or 'PAIN!' or when you first revive a teammate, because they start with no shields. I love shield boost and put points into it on every volus I've ever used, but the more you use your offensive powers and cloak, the more help you'll be to your team (with obvious exceptions like when you're running around with a Slayer or Novaguard).  As far as sniper classes go, most infiltrators will make good snipers, although the Huntress, Ghost, AIU, and Shadow are subpar snipers because of either missing the sniper damage boost in cloak or low weapon damage passives. Other good snipers include the Asari Vanguard, Destroyer, and Default Soldier.  The Asari Vanguard can be played as a Stasis sniper, focusing on freezing and headshotting mooks (and phantoms) and using grenades or biotic charge for crowd control when enemies get too close for comfort. Her weakness is that she deals less damage to armored targets because she can't use stasis on them. This makes her really good on lower difficulties, but not nearly as good on higher ones unless there are good anti-armor teammates that allow the asari to focus on phantoms, hunters, and troopers.  The Destroyer can be specced for weapon damage and clip capacity, which will make any 3 shot sniper rifle (Black Widow/Valiant/Krysae) have a 4 shot clip. The clip capacity boost also greatly benefits the Collector Sniper Rifle. His weakness is lack of mobility with Devastator Mode active, combined with having no way to restore shields, disable enemies, or drop enemy agro. The only emergency measure the Destroyer has is to fire off a few rounds of grenades.  The default Soldier focuses on using Adrenaline Rush to increase weapon damage by 70% (almost equivalent to cloak). What makes this a viable sniper class is the fact that when you activate Adrenaline Rush, it instantly reloads your gun. This means you can skip every 2nd or 3rd reload on guns such as the Claymore, Widow, and Javelin. Adrenaline Rush can also be specced to restore some shields, which helps make up for not being able to use cloak to drop enemy agro. The default Soldier also has Frag Grenades for crowd control."

The cloak a Volus activates while sprinting is a different cloak (on a different cooldown) from the one activated at other times.  If you have to cross a lot of open ground, cloak before you start your sprint and you'll be able to re-cloak instantly after the first one breaks, without even breaking stride."

MECoOp,31loou,Warfy,2,Tue Apr 7 01:26:06 2015 UTC,"A diminished role, perhaps, but I wouldn't say ""no such thing"". Some classes are better at reviving than others because they have powers that let them get to downed teammates (Cloak) or tank damage when reviving under fire (defense matrix, various armors). Depending on spec, some are good for front-line support when it comes to restoring shields (geth turret, shield boost) or stat boosts (squad command, biotic sphere)."

MECoOp,31loou,wngmv,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"no Volus. if you do decide decided to play one though, learn to shield boost at the right time. Know that every time you shield boost at the same time your teammates are reloading, you'd be effectively locking them out of doing anything (using any power, shooting) until they do a heavy melee to fix it. this is annoying as for people who use single shot weapons like Claymore or Javelin. also, it's not needed. healer in ME3 isn't that necessary, since your shield regen almost all the time.  as for Sniper, GI is the only kit that could fire all three shots of BW within the cloak bonus. but if you are just starting out, QFI and SI are good. Human Infiltrator also have quite good damage against armor, and cryo blast is quite consistent at making phantoms putting up bubbles for easy headshots too."

At least I don't need rad guns to kick ass with him.  That said if you want a better shot at UR guns, then you probably want to focus on Arsenal Packs if I understand the system correctly.

MECoOp,31lutl,JRandall0308,2,Mon Apr 6 09:48:46 2015 UTC,"Nope, every rare slot has a 7.5% chance of a UR regardless of what pack it's in."
MECoOp,31lutl,crashsuit,1 point,Tue Apr 7 08:02:56 2015 UTC,"Right, but the PSP/AR/ResP have 2 item slots whereas every other pack has only 1 item slot (except the JEP, which has none). Each has a 7.5% chance. Whilst this doesn't exactly equal a 15% chance if I remember how the math works, it's still better odds than buying standard SPs. 200kcr gets you 3 SPs or 2 specialized packs, for either 3 or 4 slots respectively.  /u/JRandall0308 linked to a college article that explains the specifics in more detail."
MECoOp,31lutl,smedes,3,Tue Apr 7 10:35:01 2015 UTC,"All of the 99K packs have exactly the same effective UR drop rates.

Once you start the UR grind in earnest (everything else maxed, don't care about consumables) just buy 99K packs. It doesn't matter which kind.  Edit: here we go, the exact post where the game file data with the 7.5% number is revealed.

MECoOp,31lutl,Arcalane,3,Tue Apr 7 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"Arsenal Packs might be a slightly better pick than the other 99k packs, but only because Arsenals don't drop common character cards in place of consumables like the others do."
MECoOp,31lutl,smedes,2,Tue Apr 7 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"Any of the 'focused' 99kcr packs like that have a ~13% chance for an UR over the 9% on the Prime Spectre pack or whatever it is, I think?   I was simply correcting  this point you made by pointing out that  every rare slot has a 7.5% chance of a UR regardless of what pack it's in. The exact rates are as follows:  Spectre Pack: 7.5% chance of a UR  PSP: 13.875% chance of ONE UR, 0.5625% chance of TWO URs   AP: 13.875% chance of ONE UR, 0.5625% chance of TWO URs  ResP: 13.875% chance of ONE UR, 0.5625% chance of TWO URs  The expected value is a more useful number than the probability of receiving a UR, as the latter is somewhat ambiguous and would most likely be interpreted as the probability of receiving one or more URs, which does not adequately represent the fact that some of those outcomes would be twice as valuable. The expected value of all three 99k packs is exactly 0.15 URs/pack just as you might expect, and the expected value of a Spectre Pack is 0.075 URs.  So buying the 99k packs will result in higher yields of URs per credit spent than buying Spectre Packs. However, you were incorrect that buying Arsenal Packs would result in more URs per credit spent in the long run than buying PSPs. The true reason many people choose to buy Arsenal Packs is to avoid receiving common character cards, as /u/crashsuit mentioned."

MECoOp,31hfy6,berychance,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"I am at work and I don't have access to the wiki. If you want to compare. Sure. I would agree that Hurricane even at I is the best out of the SMGs. However, would you take it to plat? How many shots until you have to reload, and how many until you have to go to the ammo box?  For pistol? Arc Pistol at X is by far the best pistol in the game, on par with a Talon X. It is not a mystery why so many soloers choose Arc Pistol as their go-to weapon. A charged Arc Pistol X does 868.5x3 damage, effectively ignores shield gate, and has more ammunition than the Paladin and Talon. (I am sure it has more ammo than Paladin X as well)  For AR, CAR can't even be considered a plat tier weapon. PPR and Lancer has very very limited ammo at this point, making dps a very unreliable indicator, since you can't sustain fire for a long time even with extended magazine. It is especially true for PPR, since the damage mostly comes from when it's charged and it's mostly used on weapon classes. And if you use a class that has increased fire rate, it's gonna be even worse. Harrier I is even worse than Hurricane I. Valkyrie at I isn't worth of it at all, even on TGI. Saber might be worth it, but it is not a popular weapon and hard to handle to start with.  GPS, again, does 1428*3 damage when charged, doesn't require AP ammo or penetration mods, and obliterates Phantoms. And when you put Claymore and Raider into the race, one almost has 0 reason to use Wraith at all unless you absolutely must have the 0.5 second faster cooldown.  Javelin I has less ammo than Window X, and does less damage. It cannot even one shot a platinum nemesis WITH phasic ammo. And if you know how to use it, a CSR X would massive out damage both BW1 and Javelin I. And Viper? No pls no.  So I maintain, apart from BW1, you have much better options in rare weapons. Just because that they are ""oh shiny"" UR, doesn't automatically make them better. Of course, a good player could make Predator work in platinum.  TLDR: ""they don't LOOK that useless to me."" DPS chart isn't everything."
MECoOp,31hfy6,wngmv,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"I would take a hurricane to Plat. It might not be my primary way to put out damage, but if I'm running something that needs a way to put down big Boss enemies more easily then it's a good sidearm or complimentary weapon to a power based class.   Yes, the arc pistol is great, but both the paladin and talon (and scorpion which I didn't list) provide some advantages and could be used.   Those arguments against ARs are kind of weak. If you want to run an assault rifle, then it will probably be an UR.   Wraith doesn't require a charge and has better range than both raider and claymore. Maybe not better, but not useless.   Javelin has better piercing and a thermal scope in addition to geth multipliers. Again, not useless."
MECoOp,31hfy6,berychance,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"If most of your URs are stuck at one, rarely a few can output Hurrudrr I at DPS. I think it probably has the highest DPS in game, if you can control the recoil and manage the ammo.  I think we forgot Typhoon. I had it stuck on 1 for a while before the nerf but then I never used it. And I do agree that if you want an AR it's gonna be an UR, which means I don't want to use level 1 URs on plat at all.  What is the advantage of a Talon I and a Paladin I have over Arc Pistol? Especially with Paladin, since it requires more than 1 shots to kill an enemy. And if you are that good at headshot to be effective with a Paladin, all you need is one shot to kill most enemies with an Arc Pistol. Paladin is just totally outclassed by Arc Pistol. Talon suffers from range, the same argument you used on Claymore and Raider. Scorpion's advantage of crowd control isn't really valid IMHO since dead mooks don't require crowd control, and Scorpion can't pierce.   When you say Wraith has longer range than Claymore, do you have numbers to back it up? I don't recall that being the case. Even with less range and charge mechanism, I'd say a Raider X, Claymore X and GPS X are better choices than Wraith I and I am  a big Wraith fan.  Your arguments about Javelin is true, but then, Geth weapon multiplier and thermal scope mean nothing when you are out of ammo.   As I said, if you are a good player you can make all the weapons work regardless of their rank. But level 1 URs are badly outranked by other rares."
MECoOp,31hfy6,wngmv,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"And I do agree that if you want an AR it's gonna be an UR, which means I don't want to use level 1 URs on plat at all.   Considering, that one of the best classes in the game makes ARs stupid broken, then I definitely wouldn't blink twice about a Harrier I on plat.    What is the advantage of a Talon I and a Paladin I have over Arc Pistol?   Better burst without needing a charge and better sustained damage in most cases. Charging is a useful mechanic, but weapons that are close to the same damage without needing to charge have their place.    Talon suffers from range, the same argument you used on Claymore and Raider.   That's not contradictory.    Scorpion's advantage of crowd control isn't really valid IMHO since dead mooks don't require crowd control, and Scorpion can't pierce.   Scorpion also CC's phantoms, which is incredibly useful for many characters and players in addition to heavy area damage.    When you say Wraith has longer range than Claymore, do you have numbers to back it up?   Claymore Stat Screen. Given value is 10.  Wraith Stat Screen. Given value is 15.  Claymore reticule.  Wraith reticule   I'd say a Raider X, Claymore X and GPS X are better choices    Them being better choices in most cases does not mean the Wraith is useless.    Your arguments about Javelin is true, but then, Geth weapon multiplier and thermal scope mean nothing when you are out of ammo.   And you are not constantly out of ammo, so it isn't useless.    As I said, if you are a good player you can make all the weapons work regardless of their rank. But level 1 URs are badly outranked by other rares.   As I said, them being outranked does not make them useless and they aren't even that badly outranked. Also, it's pretty unlikely that you don't have a decently upgraded UR by the time you max out your rares."

That said, 70-100k is a perfectly fine place to be. Give it a few tries, if you can't handle it, then that just means that the other players will have to pick up the slack a little for a few matches, then you can go back to where you're more comfortable. For plenty of people, playing 3-man is no sweat, and if it's clear that you can't hold your own, most won't put themselves in danger to get you back up."
MECoOp,31gcym,KedovDoKest,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, scores are good although I'm in it for the credits. For the moment, anyway. Even though it's nice to get on the top of the scoreboard (or at least the upper half), as long as all objectives are done and we make it out then that's the main thing."
MECoOp,31gcym,ProtoKun7,5,Sun Apr 5 00:49:39 2015 UTC,"Since all of my elitest douchebag friends stopped playing the game, I mostly ended up on top of the scoreboard for some reason. I think myself as knowing the game quite a bit, and usually, the thing I look for mostly as ""etiquette"" in this game is whether you do the objectives or not. Leaving 3 people in a circle hacking, escorting, when you go somewhere else points whoring means you are not my teammate. So if you die in wave 4 and are mashing your spacebar/X/A I won't be reviving you even if I am standing right next to you.   Score doesn't matter, end of story. How much points you get rely heavily on your kits, your weapon, your mods, and your equipments. The fact that you worry about whether you are ready for gold means you have put quite a few thought into this, and mostly likely you are ready. Just need to get ready for the change of pace."
MECoOp,31gcym,wngmv,4,Tue Apr 7 16:56:31 2015 UTC,"Your scores make it sound like you are ready for Gold.  Just make sure to run decent equipment, synergize a little bit with your team (no disruptor ammo with adepts for example), and to use a level 20 character at first."
MECoOp,31gcym,caesar_primus,5,Sat Apr 4 22:27:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I learned the most playing Gold. Some things to note: always help with objectives - it makes things faster, and dying outside the circle means people going outside to help you, and might lead to the whole team getting downed. Also, something that new players tend to forget: it's always okay to retreat. There will be times where you'll be completely overwhelmed, and you need to GTFO before you get grabbed/downed. My advice is to add some good players who'll take you to Gold and show the ropes. Honestly, I tend to play lots of PUGs with maybe one or two friends, and we don't really care if we have to carry since we want to get on with the game. Alternatively, learn how to use weapons like the Claymore, and grab an infiltrator (Or, biotic tag-team with players using debuff powers as abonus.) I managed to top matches off-host with other great players using my SI with a Claymore II (and at that point in time I was a really awful player). Score doesn't mean much, but it does at least tell you that you can still dish out enough killing power without maxed-out weapons :) I usually run a few Gold matches a day, so you can add me if you'd like!"
MECoOp,31gcym,ajanledagag,3,Sun Apr 5 11:32:13 2015 UTC,"As long as you aren't constantly dying in stupid positions and are playing the objective, you are fine on gold.  You don't need to have the best damage output.  In all honestly, no sane person actually expects a lot from gold PUGs.  If you can contribute without dying a ton, you are probably better than average."
MECoOp,31gcym,retief1,3,Sun Apr 5 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't played in a while due to school, so I don't know if things have changed, but I think as long as you can be a good team player, you can probably play Gold. Try a few matches and see."

The only bothering thing I've noticed that when playing with my pal (both 1000+ hours into the game) that quite often the players with low score don't even do the objectives. So they're not killing the enemy, and they're not activating the objectives.   So .. welcome to Gold. But do that one thing regardless of your score. Play the objective.   Additionally I find it strange that so many people come into Gold without a single medigel. That kinda tells me that they were anticipating not contributing. It doesn't matter that much, but I just find it a bit defeatist."

MECoOp,31gcym,Krags,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:15:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the helpful responses guys... just trying to figure out if people feel dragging my butt around is a fun challenge or more of a nuisance.  I should add that most of my success (in about 20 Gold extractions) has come running the AIU + Reegar combo since it doesn't require aiming and I can spam RM.  The only other character I feel comfortable bringing into Gold has been Salarian Engineer with a Mattock on 6/0/6/6/6 build.  Right now I've trying to learn not to suck at sniping with a Turian soldier with Harrier/Valiant I -- that's what I'm mostly trying to decide whether to bring into Gold or not, because I'm still pretty mediocre with it."
MECoOp,31gcym,natestone,2,Sat Apr 4 23:18:32 2015 UTC,"Mattock is a great weapon when your manifest is still growing, I used it a lot.  Acolyte: learn to love it.  Strips shields, can stagger, is an anti-phantom gun, doesn't weigh much, and there's not much difference between the X and I levels.  I pretty much give it to every character.  Any infiltrator will allow you to contribute:  spec cloak for duration and now you're the team device-disabler and medic.  I'd recommend the Salarian for Energy Drain (increased survivabilty) and Proxy mine (staggers and increased damage).  Snap Freezers:  AIU and N7 Paladin are great even if you do nothing other than spam SF.  Overloaders:  Snap Freezers prime and weaken, Overloaders detonate.  Spam the hell out of it.  Turian Sentinel is great for starting out on gold:  Tech armor + Turian = fairly tanky and he can detonate all the things with Overload and Warp."
MECoOp,31gcym,El_Diablito,2,Sun Apr 5 00:48:36 2015 UTC,"Just got my Mattock to X -- just need to give my clicky finger a rest and I'll be going back to it for sure.  Still getting used to the charge-up/arc of the Acolyte but it's noticeably effective, thanks for the tip!  Last time I ran SI I think I completely forgot about proxy mine (esp. since on TSol my cooldown only really allows for Marksman).  Will have to try it.  I'm already loving the N7 Paladin, which I also just unlocked, will have to give Turian Sentinel a shot now that I have decent kit.  I'll say one thing about this game -- the variety is freaking awesome, and love how active the community still is with you guys."
MECoOp,31gcym,Knocking,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:23:02 2015 UTC,Since you're on PC can't you put on a rapid click macro?  If so then your Mattock is effectively a lighter Harrier with more ammo to boot.
MECoOp,31gcym,mightykingfish,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:41:59 2015 UTC,"In general, if you put forth effort (use equipment, consumables, do the OBJ), you're fine playing Gold (in my opinion).    As for the TSol class, with both of them at I, it'll kill your cooldown for Marksman. I suggest only using one of the two, whichever you're more comfortable with. Something like a Pirahna or Raider will work really well too, but I don't know how much you have unlocked."
MECoOp,31gcym,Chypsylon,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:36:52 2015 UTC,"This first point.  I did a gold run last night with a guy with low N7/challenge points scores, which is okay.  What wasn't okay is he came in with an Avenger I and no gear.  During the game he mostly stayed out of harm's way,  but when he died he wouldn't use a single medigel."
MECoOp,31gcym,Dairgo,1 point,Sun Apr 5 12:08:57 2015 UTC,If he only had a Avenger 1 he probably had only 1 to 2 available and wanted to save them for more serious situations.
MECoOp,31gcym,wngmv,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:49:19 2015 UTC,"Can't agree more about equipment.  If I'm hosting a lobby and open it to fill the last spot, and see that the new comer readies up without putting gear on, we'll hold the launch and ask politely to put some gear on.  If you're going to snipe, I would suggest bringing a sniper rifle on an infiltrator, or say the mattock or the saber with a scope on anything else.  you want to keep your recharges times low.  But then I've gone off left field myself on the Tsol, build it without Marksman, and go on fire explosion sprees; spamming concussion shot, proxy mine with incindeary ammo in a pheaston.  As other have said, play teamwork, stick close to the group so you can assist others and so you hopefully die less, and feel better about helping the team."
MECoOp,31gcym,smileymcface,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:22:30 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest ditching AIU/Reegar. If you want to be more proficient at the game, use something that actually require a little thought on how to play it. As pointed out in the other thread, use FQI/SI for sniping. With a Widow if you dont have BW/Javelin unlocked. Use Phasic rounds on a Widow allows you to one shot most enemies, even on a low level. BW and Javelin are great for gold even at level 1. As a sniper, the thing you are looking for is to be able to one shot most enemies. IIRC you can't do that with a Valiant until it's leveled up.  Harrier isn't the best choice on Tsol, because of the limited amount of ammo you have, especially consider you must have a low level Harrier. Valiant, at I, just sucks. Again, Widow is a great weapon that nobody uses anymore.   Second on Tsent. All Turians are awesome, with some insane passive trees."

There are few don't s in me coop, like say, using a geth spitfire on a caster class or standing in the line of fire.

MECoOp,31gcym,Arcalane,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:07:21 2015 UTC,"I've never had a problem with somewhat newer players coming into my public gold matches.  Just don't run an Asari Adept with a Claymore and a Geth Spitfire with the High Velocity Barrel mods on both and I know you aren't a complete idiot, and I won't care really.  Also, for reference, sometimes players care about top score, sometimes they don't.  If I'm caring about top score, I'll be running a Paladin with Geth Scanner, a power efficiency mod and cryo ammo on my Eagle, at which point you'd never catch up, or a Fury with some equivalent.  If I don't care about the top score (which the great majority of the players don't) then I'll be running something to have fun with.  Generally, if you're running into gold public matches, just roll something you're confident you can help with and can have fun with.  If you're running plat matches that are public, that's usually when you run into a little friction with the more skilled players that like things set up perfectly."

We all know how the game mechanics work.    Line of sight obstructions like flamer can be frustrating. I think it's up to everybody to be courteous and try to be aware of teammates' positions and play styles. Ultimately, to play to each others' strengths. But that can be hard in the heat of battle, when it's all you can do to pay attention to the enemies. But flamer is a badass power, worth playing around, and it's usually not too hard to predict how another player is going to be using it and reposition myself accordingly. I'll tell you what cheeses me off, though, is when I'm clearly playing a sniper infiltrator and these damn Krogans keep standing right in front of me. Rude.    Anyway that's my opinion.

You try to keep it out of the way most of the time to be courteous and let your teammates deal their maximum damage while you are too, but sometimes you HAVE TO USE IT right in front of your teammates for everyone's well being.   As other people have said though, some players are complaining about petty point stealing and are upset because you set their target on fire and killed it before they were able to.

MECoOp,31du26,Chiokos,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"On the topic of volus, just use a class that can actually make better use of those weapons.   There is really no reason to use Volus except for giggles. The only thing they can do that no other class can is Shield Boost, which sucks because of the glitch. A broken skill doesn't make up for the fact that they're squishy, immobile, and have really poor passives."

MECoOp,3179ja,thisonetimeonreddit,5,Thu Apr 2 18:02:00 2015 UTC,"The seeding of the bracket was determined from redditors voting.  This way you avoid having two of the top characters going head to head early on in the tourney.  And the results of most matchups pretty much reflected that initial round of round of voting, with very few upsets.  And other than the N7 Shadow knocking off the Geth Engineer early, the rest of the upsets weren't huge, usually only a difference of 3 or 4 in seeding.  Actually, beyond that upset, there were only 3 others, 2 of which were by the Turian Ghost in the last 2 rounds making his run for the finals."

MECoOp,316d9y,Arcalane,3,Thu Apr 2 10:10:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't realise the Typhoon gave DR, I've honestly never heard that before."
MECoOp,316d9y,ScareTheRiven,6,Thu Apr 2 12:00:45 2015 UTC,It doesn't.  It's supposed to confer the in-cover damage reduction while leaning out of cover but the in game testing does not support this.
MECoOp,316d9y,AaronEh,2,Thu Apr 2 12:23:13 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I wasn't noticing any significant increase in durability whilst I had it equipped.  If I remember how to calculate effective HP properly, then... well, I have 3,100 base shields. With four pulses, I should have 5,166 effective shields. Assuming it did grant 40% DR, then depending on how it stacked I ought to have anywhere between 8,611 and 15,500 effective shields.  That's without boosters from gear/etc. too."
MECoOp,316d9y,crashsuit,2,Thu Apr 2 14:16:05 2015 UTC,"Since you take 40% extra damage (or 140% total) when out of cover, multiply all DR by an effective ~0.73. Your 40% DR from Siege Pulse is actually around 29% effective."
MECoOp,316d9y,ScareTheRiven,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:15:52 2015 UTC,"Ta, I had a feeling it was something like that."
MECoOp,316d9y,wngmv,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:37:58 2015 UTC,"Supposedly, but I'm not sure what their source for that actual value is. There's a video linked - an official stream where someone asks about the Spitfire and whether or not it has any defense bonus compared to the Typhoon."
MECoOp,316d9y,wngmv,1 point,Thu Apr 2 12:15:47 2015 UTC,"Dr doesn't work way you think it would -- I forgot the formula but it might look something like this DR/(1+DR)...  I like Typhoon better on the Trooper but you can make a solid kits out of the Juggs with the weapon, just not at rank 1."
MECoOp,316d9y,crashsuit,2,Fri Apr 3 13:25:04 2015 UTC,"If you mean because of the bonus damage enemies deal because the Gethnaut is always considered out of cover, yeah, /u/crashsuit  covered that already. It's still better than nothing.  I don't have the gear/etc. to really run Gold anyway, so the rank is not too much of an issue yet. Even the Rank 1 Typhoon is annihilating most enemies on Bronze/Silver."
MECoOp,316d9y,wngmv,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"yeah, something like that. DR is quite pointless in this game...  And Typhoon 1 is enough for gold, since it has innate penetration (iirc). Jugg is good for it since you can't get staggered. Slap on a drill or ap rounds and you should be good. IMO the lack of ammo on Typhoon I is a bigger hurdle than the unupgraded damage.   but, play whatever difficulty you enjoy."
MECoOp,316d9y,crashsuit,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:09:40 2015 UTC,"Damage reduction, in my opinion, gets better the more of it you can stack. 10 or 20 percent isn't going to do much, but 80 or 90 is going to be quite noticeable. One of the reasons the warlord can take so much damage is because his damage reduction can stack to something like 130 percent as long as he keeps meleeing.  Edit: I will usually always pick increased damage output over damage reduction, but I wouldn't call damage reduction pointless"
MECoOp,316d9y,wngmv,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I played Krolord maybe 5 times since he was released. I agree with you, and the fact that increased damage is always worth picking over DR, kinda proves that it is ""pointless"". Not that it's useless, but there are always better options than it."
MECoOp,316d9y,crashsuit,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not pointless, but the more of it you have, the better it gets. With the correct spec, Warlord with Tech Armor, active Rage, and performing heavy melee can get 130% damage reduction. This works out to something like 23,000 effective health. I don't think there's anything pointless about that. With 40% damage reduction on the Jug and full health in fitness, the 2300 health and 4600 shields turn into something like 3200 and 6400. Something like 5% or 10% total on a kit, I'm not going to worry as much about, but once you start getting something like 30% or 40%, or more, you're going to really start noticing it. I don't know that there are always better options, I mean more damage faster equals dead enemies, but I guess I just think it's subjective, and I'd take a look at it on a case by case basis."
MECoOp,316d9y,wngmv,2,Sat Apr 4 07:19:26 2015 UTC,"makes sense. Though I stand my point, if you look at how much damage a gold/plat Maraduer/Trooper/Geth Turet/Collector Captain/Phantom/Dragoon does, I prioritize killing them fast than that having some extra health. To each his own, if one values DR over dps it's perfectly fine."
MECoOp,316d9y,wngmv,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:22:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally hear you. Take the Drell Adept, for instance. I love playing him because even though he's pretty squishy, he can put out so much damage so quickly that you don't have to worry as much about getting shot, because dead enemies can't shoot you."
MECoOp,318j4s,Manlychester_United,3,Thu Apr 2 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the part about ""stop pissing off other biotics"" but I don't think that's a good idea from a game balance perspective. I've used console commands to add both powers to the same kit and it's way too OP. Every time you charge, the field would prime the target before you hit, and charge would detonate. You could get level 12 biotic explosions every couple seconds or so, maybe sooner if you took bonus power on rank 6 of charge. Add in the shields given back from the field and it's just ridiculous.  Fun, though. The particular kits I tried this on were the GI and the Juggernaut. Nothing like a Jug going into cloak > charge > biotic explosion > Jug heavy melee. Also, melee GI with annihilation field is pure nuts."
MECoOp,318j4s,crashsuit,3,Thu Apr 2 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"The 'piss off the biotics' was in reference as to how the dark channel would override other biotics BE priming, resulting in stolen points/kills. If you look at a couple of the Fury class builder threads you can see a few examples of that"

MECoOp,318j4s,ginja_ninja,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:10:09 2015 UTC,"Oh I see - I think. Since the target would still be biotically primed, we're talking about just a points thing, then? Kill stealing and whatnot? I think most damage-over-time powers can be guilty of that - Warp, Dark Channel, Reave, Dark Sphere, Incinerate, Inferno Grenades, etc etc."
MECoOp,318j4s,carnage_panda,2,Thu Apr 2 22:59:35 2015 UTC,"If DC had a 50% priming bonus, then it would just be a pedantic pointstealing thing. As is, it actually weakens the resulting explosion by a factor of thousands and keeps bosses alive and putting out damage of their own longer than they would be otherwise. Any time a dark channel overrides a warp it acts as a detriment to team progress."
MECoOp,318j4s,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:11:51 2015 UTC,"I only ever use Dark Channel on bosses like Primes and Banshees, and this is a break from getting up in their face where they can sync kill you, or stagger fuck you. It's the only time I use my gun with a fury.  Most of her time should be spent murdering the mooks with AF+throw detonations."
MECoOp,318j4s,wngmv,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:58:44 2015 UTC,i disagree with this because a properly specced DC is doing a good deal of damage and will make up for the missed damage from a biotic explosion in a matter of seconds.
MECoOp,318j4s,crashsuit,2,Sat Apr 4 14:31:40 2015 UTC,I believe it's the fact that it overrides everything and gets passed around so easily (whenever the target does) that frustrates people
MECoOp,318j4s,wngmv,2,Thu Apr 2 23:07:39 2015 UTC,which power of GI would you take out to give him AF? passive? Cuz it would be pure nuts to take out any other power just to give me a power that does 15% debuff.
MECoOp,318j4s,Dairgo,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:27:51 2015 UTC,No sorry that's not what I meant - you can straight up add extra powers mid match using the console. It doesn't take powers away. It's such a pain that it's not really useful for much other than to try it a couple times as a novelty.
MECoOp,318j4s,carnage_panda,2,Fri Apr 3 21:38:06 2015 UTC,wowowow GI with all his cheese adding AF? sign me in pls.

MECoOp,312x4t,Scarecrow1779,10,Wed Apr 1 17:20:18 2015 UTC,"I guess it's not that crazy, but I think an Adept counterpart of the Paladin would be a lot of fun. The Asari make shields, so I don't see why a human biotic couldn't make a melee shield. The Snap Freeze could be maybe a modified version of Annihilation Field or Statis in order to prime. The others could be Throw and Dark Channel?"
MECoOp,312x4t,1peaches,2,Wed Apr 1 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"It'd need to be at least a little smaller priming area than Snap Freeze in order to be balanced. The best explanation i've heard on this sub of biotic vs. tech combos is that tech is all about quantity and biotic is all about quality (lots of damage from single detonation). If the biotic snap freeze could detonate multiple biotic combinations it might be too good, also. Ultimately, Reave is already a more versatile version of what you're talking about. It hits a smaller area, but can be from range. It can prime multiple targets and detonate as well.  You're right, a biotic with a shield that can shield bash to prime combos would be bad ass. Make it a sentinel too, so it has Tech Armor, Throw, and Reave? You'd Reave a target, then throw to detonate and stagger, then run in, shield bash to prime, and throw to detonate again.   What if you had a class that had a biotic shield bash or melee that was a detonator and then it had shield boost, tech armor, and dark channel? You prime a group of enemies with dark channel, run in and bash to detonate each enemy the dark channel transfers to. Shield boost as necessary to stay alive while you proceed to detonate without worrying about your cool down. You could carry an acolyte with a stunner and power magnifier to give your shield bash and dark channel more punch."
MECoOp,312x4t,carnage_panda,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:29:42 2015 UTC,It'd need to be at least a little smaller priming area than Snap Freeze in order to be balanced.   If it sends them into orbit like a cluster grenade then it's already balanced.

For the hanar, would you allow firing multiple weapons at once? maybe allow up to 2 to fire at once but make the recoil and accuracy worse when firing multiple. You could have one anti armor, one anti shield, and one AoE stagger weapon that deals little damage. Being able to reload all 3 weapons at once would be pretty ridiculous, but you could balance it by making the reload times really long (but you can shoot other weapons while reloading one) or you could make the reload animations so that you can only reload one weapon at a time (with a normal reload and no ability to fire while reloading). I think every single player would name their hanar Blasto.   A more offensively minded juggernaut class would be pretty cool, though, and it does seem like something humans might try. Sounds like a slow tech-focused version of the Destroyer too. It would be almost non-viable on platinum unless you have a really good team since you have no defensive measures. You'd get caught out in the open and killed a lot, especially if you tried to offensively use flamer. I guess you could just focus on Siege Pulse/Arc Grenade tech bursts for ranged damage and have Flamer/Arc Grenades as your super high damage defense for when the enemy busts into where your team has been set up for a hack objective or something. I think it using Mr Freeze's voice is the best idea ever.  The MLG Gamer would ride a very thin line btwn super broken and totally useless. Tons of damage, but you'd get downed constantly."

MECoOp,312x4t,luckynosevin,3,Wed Apr 1 18:44:58 2015 UTC,"no, nova just has a set amount of base damage. The half blast evolution simply has a built in down-side that lessens the damage. Of course, you could modify the damage if you're doing the modding to put it on the Jug."

MECoOp,30yc5t,novemberpapa,11,Tue Mar 31 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"You know, some people like the sound of men grunting. And it's not just women who think that.   Moving on to more serious matters, vets of this sub know that I have a hard on for hating Novaguards. That mostly stems from them charging and then dying right in front of a boss. This means that I can't rez them and I somehow get blamed for that. It also means being down a guy due to their own recklessness. All anyone can ask is to not die in a bad spot by using your brain like every other class. From my early game experience, in between the glitches and bad players, I kinda have to assume that most Vanguards are functionally brain dead. It makes tolerating their mistakes that much easier.  For gear I'd aim for power recharge to get that charge up again but if you have to ask me for Vanguard advice, you should probably triple check your sobriety."
MECoOp,30yc5t,RepublicanShredder,2,Tue Mar 31 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"I agree that any team mate who drops regularly is not an asset but I played mine with 200% weight bonus which meant that I could continuously charge,nova,nova... repeat.  I got staggered twice but made sure to use my OPS pack or else to use nova-cancelling for the invulnerability and re-position to charge again.  I normally play a Ghost for Gold means I can lay out some pretty decent damage and am pretty survivable but I like playing very varied characters so it's like playing a different game each time."

MECoOp,30yc5t,Sebastianthorson,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:49:57 2015 UTC,I was impatient and gave it a go in Gold using the Novaguard.  I used shields and Cyclonics on the first run and did well.  Topped the boards and went down twice total after staggers.  The second run I tried running shields and power amp for more damage and went down four times after staggers.  Both games were with PUGS and afterwards my hosted lobby emptied so I think it's not a fun character for randoms to play with and I think I'm gonna avoid using the Novaguard past Silver.
MECoOp,30yc5t,1peaches,7,Tue Mar 31 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"PUGs empty the lobby because they are PUGs, not because you`re novaguard or anything."

MECoOp,30yc5t,One_more_page,2,Tue Mar 31 21:25:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's kind of unfair to your team to be going after bosses that can sync you. The exception to that is of course if you know you can stagger them and then finish them off.

MECoOp,30yc5t,ginja_ninja,2,Tue Mar 31 20:25:21 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about learning this game and what characters teach you what things. Novaguards are perhaps the best characters to teach you target prioritization. With the exception of Geth, you have to pick your targets very carefully, not only to avoid being sync-killed, but also from being generally out of position. If you're a good Novaguard, picking your targets well will come in handy no matter what class you decide to play."
MECoOp,30yc5t,Chypsylon,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"You do have a point about being smarter with the Novaguard especially at Gold and up.  I realized that just charging and nova'ing into every group of enemies is tempting but not the smartest approach to it.  Every other class that I play (at Gold level) I make sure I'm in soft cover, use RHA and check to make sure I'm not being flanked.  I shake my head when I see other players stand out in the open like it's still Bronze or Silver.  I might try the Nova again but a little more strategically, be selective, prime with a weapon and combo using my charge."

Tech armor gives a damage bonus to all powers.  In regards to your last question, every single class is viable. At the end of the day, it all depends on the person behind the screen.  Hope this helps"
MECoOp,30xpl9,blahgarfogar,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:26:58 2015 UTC,Thanks. I read that FEs do double damage to armored targets. Is this simply not true--or just not true of lift grenades as a detonator?
MECoOp,30xpl9,Scarecrow1779,5,Tue Mar 31 16:30:10 2015 UTC,"The way combos work is a base damage is calculated using the difficulty and the properties of the powers that are priming and detonating (namely, do they have all 6 ranks in that power). That base power is then multiplied by a different factor depending on what kind of defenses the combo is hitting. For fire explosions, the multiplier for armor is 2, and 1 for shields/barriers/health."

MECoOp,30xpl9,JubalTheLion,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:35:13 2015 UTC,"Scarecrow1779 is talking about combos. I suspect you were talking about the damage of the power itself.  You can see from here that lift grenades do 50% more damage to barriers, and have no multiplier against armor."
MECoOp,30xpl9,GundalfTheCamo,4,Wed Apr 1 10:12:24 2015 UTC,"According to the college post on grenades, Lift Grenades on health-only enemies, but not anything that still has barriers, shields, or armor.   I really did not know that. That's a pity and rather arbitrary.   You can still prime and detonate with team support, or you can self-detonate ammo-primed explosions, but they're going to be much weaker explosions in the latter case."
MECoOp,30xpl9,ginja_ninja,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:33:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a shame. But the thing with Krogan Sentinel or Turian Sentinel is that you don't have to worry that much about self sufficiency in exploding stuff.  Both are strong assets for both tech and biotic teams (well and Turian can Tech Burst solo and KroSent can FE kinda)."
MECoOp,30xpl9,GundalfTheCamo,3,Wed Apr 1 07:15:10 2015 UTC,"If you have krogan soldier, you should probably just play that instead as carnage+inferno grenades will be better overall. They also work in either order."
MECoOp,30xpl9,Scarecrow1779,2,Tue Mar 31 19:31:11 2015 UTC,Inferno nades don't detonate.  But yeah .. Krogan Soldier is a beast.
MECoOp,30xpl9,Scarecrow1779,2,Wed Apr 1 07:17:48 2015 UTC,"The low fitness combined with the krogan's lack of dodging will make the class less flexible on gold, but it could still work. Lift Grenades won't give you an abundance of fire explosions, but they are good as crowd control and high damage to armored targets. If you use something like the Acolyte, then Lift Grenades + Incinerate would still tear through armored targets. You could also use Incendiary ammo on the Acolyte to prime Fire Explosions and detonate them with Incinerate.  So, is this setup pretty much how you were planning on speccing? If I were using the above setup on Gold, i'd just have to make sure that me constantly priming with ammo wouldn't get in the way. I'd use a different class if there was a Biotic-combo focused person on my team."
MECoOp,30xpl9,RepublicanShredder,2,Tue Mar 31 16:39:49 2015 UTC,"That setup--only difference is I was planning on taking radius on incinerate depending on some of the answers here. The idea being to prime everything close and blow it up with grenade detonated FEs.  It appears that lift grenades actually out-do themselves as far as detonators, in that they do too much damage to be setting off as many FEs as I had in mind. Nonetheless, the ammo priming is a good idea, providing that it fits the team, as you say."
MECoOp,30xpl9,JRandall0308,2,Tue Mar 31 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"Usually, I take the radius evolution as well, but since Incinerate would be your detonator when using ammo priming, the area isn't quite as important. The extra damage would be nice for when you run up against a brute, atlas, or scion. Acolyte -> Incinerate -> Fire Explosion -> Lift Grenade. Repeat. The incinerate evolution 4 makes about 200 damage difference. Not much, but it's something.  EDIT: maybe i should clarify. even if you used incendiary ammo to prime 2 troopers that were standing right next to each other and cast an incinerate that hit both of them with its area effect, only one fire explosion would detonate."
MECoOp,30xpl9,GundalfTheCamo,2,Tue Mar 31 19:00:07 2015 UTC,That does clear things up: I was operating under a false assumption until your edit. Thanks! I think this is what I'll be running with.
MECoOp,30vkyf,gilgamesh_v9,7,Tue Mar 31 01:33:23 2015 UTC,"Incinerate primes a FE for 3 seconds, so the cooldown for Incinerate can be a little over 3 seconds since Incinerate does have travel time.  I prefer 5a as 5b only gives 25% recharge speed (which is additive and slightly more than 4b of powers passives), whereas 5a damage increase is multiplicative.  As long as your power recharge is around 150%, you'll be fine in regards to FEs."
MECoOp,30vkyf,novemberpapa,3,Tue Mar 31 01:52:23 2015 UTC,Thank you very much!
MECoOp,30vkyf,carnage_panda,3,Tue Mar 31 03:06:41 2015 UTC,I've always taken burning damage.  Recharge speed is practically useless on all but a few things.  And the window for fire explosions is long enough.
MECoOp,30vkyf,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"The burning DoT on Incinerate's Rank 5 is not detonatable, and you still have the same time window to detonate as if you took the recharge evolution. This is also true for the DoT evolution on Arc Grenades."
MECoOp,30vkyf,Scarecrow1779,2,Tue Mar 31 04:31:28 2015 UTC,"So in theory its slightly better for FEs to take 5b because you'll be able to detonate earlier? I understand the advantage is minimal, but that's good to know I guess."

MECoOp,30mszg,novemberpapa,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:16:16 2015 UTC,I don't know how the Fury is more popular than the Valkyrie.  The Valkyrie is MUCH better than the Fury in terms of biotic damage and synergy with weapons.  Has anyone even tried the Valkyrie with a Reegar loaded with warp ammo?
MECoOp,30mszg,That_Canadian_Eh,3,Sun Mar 29 05:39:01 2015 UTC,Has anyone even tried the Valkyrie with a Reegar loaded with warp ammo?   Something something incendiary ammo glitch.

MECoOp,30mszg,That_Canadian_Eh,2,Tue Mar 31 14:45:29 2015 UTC,"The cooldown for Throw is half of that of Warp, ignoring the penalties of Tech Armor that the Valkyrie has.  The rate of biotic explosions that the Fury can output is around twice that the Valkyrie can output.  The Valkyrie has better weapon damage output with Warp, but she really needs a good weapon to shine.  I used the Reegar with warp ammo, I found her to still be a little squishy even with Cyclonic IV.  I like to use the Krogan Shaman Adept specced for shield recharge as he has ridiculous shields and shield recharge speed."
MECoOp,30mszg,novemberpapa,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:07:35 2015 UTC,"idk if this is true on PC, but on PS3, if you try to detonate every time you can use throw, only every other time will detonate. I think it has to do with there having to be a certain amount of time between detonating combos on the same target or Annihilation Field taking a few seconds to re-prime after a detonation. Either way, I get close to the same number of detonations with the Valkyrie as I can with the Fury when kiting the large armored units that abound in Gold and Plat. The only place where the Valkyrie is not quite as good is running in and detonating multiple mooks when they're far enough apart that each combo doesn't hit multiple enemies. Having a pistol and the extra durability from tech armor makes up for that deficiency in most cases, though.  I'm glad to see somebody else having some love for the Krogan Shaman though. I enjoy that class so much."
MECoOp,30mszg,Scarecrow1779,5,Sun Mar 29 16:54:06 2015 UTC,"idk if this is true on PC, but on PS3, if you try to detonate every time you can use throw, only every other time will detonate. I think it has to do with there having to be a certain amount of time between detonating combos on the same target or Annihilation Field taking a few seconds to re-prime after a detonation.   The optimal way to do this is to kite in and out to manually reset Annihilation Field on your target:   Run in > apply Annihilation Field Throw > Biotic Explosion Run back > remove Annihilation Field Repeat   This is much faster and more reliable than sitting around and waiting for your Annihilation Field to re-prime. If you get comfortable with the radius of your Annihilation Field, every Throw should be a BE and you should be able to throw them out as frequently as your Throw comes off cooldown. The Fury definitely throws out more BEs than the Valkyrie."
MECoOp,30mszg,reivision,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:28:17 2015 UTC,I didn't know it would reprime faster if you ducked in and out. That would definitely make a huge difference. Thanks for the tip!
MECoOp,30mszg,Scarecrow1779,2,Mon Mar 30 14:35:09 2015 UTC,"I think the reason for that is lag or that the graphics of Annihilation Field do not match the radius.  Valkyrie is better against armored targets due to Warp and her tankier nature.  Yeah, he's pretty fun."
MECoOp,30mszg,novemberpapa,3,Sun Mar 29 21:49:07 2015 UTC,She isn't anymore. Ghost has moved ahead.
MECoOp,30mszg,Davare,-3,Sun Mar 29 00:59:45 2015 UTC,Because the Fury is better.
MECoOp,30mszg,caesar_primus,2,Sun Mar 29 02:34:15 2015 UTC,"The Ghost does more damage from a better range, is stupidly more durable, has just as good crowd control with overload, and better general utility because of cloak."
MECoOp,30mszg,berychance,0,Sun Mar 29 19:34:57 2015 UTC,does more damage   Not true.  Warp ammo hurricane on top of AF or DC does crazy damage and the Fury has quick biotic explosions to immediately kill groups of mooks and captain units.
MECoOp,30mszg,caesar_primus,5,Sun Mar 29 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"Turian Ghost with Harrier X  N7 Fury with Hurricane X against biotically primed target  The Fury is only putting out more damage in the most generous of cases. It's also not immediate because you have to run into the giant group of enemies, when you could have already killed them from a distance."
MECoOp,30mszg,berychance,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:34:22 2015 UTC,The Fury also has combo damage and the ability to destroy groups of enemies quickly.  Showing pure weapon damage doesn't perfectly portray the capabilities of a power based class.
MECoOp,30mszg,caesar_primus,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:22:05 2015 UTC,Which doesn't do nearly as much damage in all but the most convenient of situations.
MECoOp,30mszg,berychance,2,Mon Mar 30 18:26:32 2015 UTC,"If by convenient, you mean when one of the most mobile classes in the game gets near an opponent, then sure."
MECoOp,30mszg,caesar_primus,3,Mon Mar 30 18:29:49 2015 UTC,"By convenient I mean in a situation where it hits 4 or 5 enemies at once.   The Fury's explosion can do up to 1266 damage on gold and 1645 damage on platinum. Throw has a 1.5 second cool down timer. So you need to be hitting at least 4 to 5 enemies with every biotic explosion to keep up with the Ghost.   That is entirely unrealistic. If you ignore having to run up to a group of solider level enemies, then the fury might be able to kill them faster, but in most cases it can't and the Ghost destroys the Fury against every other enemy type.     If you are failing to grasp what this means. Ask yourself how many kill streak bonuses you get as the Fury? I've gotten a couple. you would need to do this with nearly every throw.   The ghost does more damage if you have the weapon to support it. This is a pretty well supported fact. I have provided that support."
MECoOp,30mszg,berychance,6,Mon Mar 30 20:57:21 2015 UTC,I've only happened upon this tourney now and find out that Human Vanguard was out in the first round. Thus I declare the whole thing to be null and void.
MECoOp,30mszg,Kallously,9,Sun Mar 29 04:08:03 2015 UTC,Well this isn't a tourney of who can get sync killed the fastest...
MECoOp,30mszg,berychance,4,Sun Mar 29 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"Right, because the Krogan Warlord would win that"
MECoOp,30mszg,Kallously,2,Sun Mar 29 19:51:14 2015 UTC,Krogan Warlord moves too slow. The human vanguard gets to charge right into the waiting arms of a Phantom or Banshee.
MECoOp,30mszg,berychance,5,Sun Mar 29 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"HV is actually one of the best anti-phantom classes in the game. Also understanding when the Banshee is unable to sync kill is critical. Otherwise, you can dodge roll or charge away to maintain a safe distance.  If any sync killers get close to you as a warlord, you simply can't run away fast enough."
MECoOp,30mszg,Kallously,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:21:21 2015 UTC,"It really, really is not. There are at least a dozen classes that are capable of getting the phantom to throw up it's skill barrier and then can easily kill it. Anything with stasis owns phantoms. If we want to keep the comparison to the Krolord, then it can OHKO phantoms as can most infiltrators. The Juggernaut for all it's flaws can't be sync'd and CCs phantoms easily.   The HV isn't there because it's objectively a mediocre class on higher difficulties. Not to mention it's pretty much completely outclassed by the Slayer.   Same Charge Phase Disrupter is a long range, aimed nova with a better radius evolution, more damage, and less shield consumed for the traded cost of invincibility frames.  Biotic Slash is a more powerful shockwave with better range. Better Race tree. Better Fitness tree."
MECoOp,30mszg,berychance,3,Sun Mar 29 23:19:20 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with your assessments; nova is incomparable to PD in actual practical use and few people seriously consider BS or shockwave, but I suppose you're entitled to your opinion. All I can say is that I have plenty of experience playing this game, mostly on HV in gold matches, and I'm pretty sure most other experienced players would agree that a good novaguard does really well. I'm sorry that you haven't played with many skilled novaguards yourself or else you'd say otherwise."
MECoOp,30mszg,Kallously,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:45:44 2015 UTC,"You're taking what I'm saying the wrong way. I'm not saying it's a bad class. I'm saying it's average compared to all the other classes in the game. Most classes in this game are very good and super capable of doing well. Player skill has way more to do than how good the class is. Most of us can role into a public match and top the scoreboard with a Volus. Doing well isn't a good barometer for how good the class is, since all of them can do it."
MECoOp,30mszg,berychance,2,Mon Mar 30 01:50:14 2015 UTC,"I still argue that there are unique things that a novaguard can uniquely accomplish better than a lot of classes, but I essentially understand what you're getting at."
MECoOp,30mszg,Kallously,6,Mon Mar 30 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"Uggh, neither the Demollisher nor the Slayer are quarterfinal material."
MECoOp,30mszg,caesar_primus,2,Sun Mar 29 02:33:33 2015 UTC,"I want the Paladin and Destroyer to win, but that doesn't mean that the others aren't good enough. The Demolisher is the grenade queen and the Slayer is intense if you have a decent internet connection."
MECoOp,30mszg,ScareTheRiven,3,Sun Mar 29 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"It's a PvE game, so pretty much all characters are viable, but we are talking the best characters. Slayer and Demollisher just aren't great compared to some of the other powerhouses."
MECoOp,30mszg,caesar_primus,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:24:27 2015 UTC,"Although personally I disagree with you, they are fine to solo Plat with. I can see why some people think that."
MECoOp,30mszg,ScareTheRiven,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:26:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. A hosting Slayer running with a Tech-focused team is one of the most powerful teams you can have, in my opinion. Biotic Charge and Phase Disruptor are both amazing detonators that deal great damage on their own. The Slayer is one of the best power damage output classes in the game that doesn't rely on combos."
MECoOp,30mszg,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:47:11 2015 UTC,"That's the biggest issue with the Slayer for me, his lack of Tech Combo's compared to some other classes."
MECoOp,30mszg,ScareTheRiven,2,Sun Mar 29 22:39:43 2015 UTC,"The Slayer already has high damage without combos, but is also one of the best tech detonators in the game. If the Slayer had a combo primer, i think it would only distract from the already absurd damage Phase Disruptor can deal.  For solo damage output, you are better off just abusing Phase Disruptor. With the build i use and no consumables, PD already deals 1900 damage to armor every time it fires. That's already more damage than a Snap Freeze cryo explosion with it's +100% buff, but you can throw out five of them and instantly get your shields back with biotic charge."
MECoOp,30mszg,Scarecrow1779,2,Sun Mar 29 23:29:43 2015 UTC,"I know, I was just waxing lyrical."
MECoOp,30mszg,ScareTheRiven,3,Sun Mar 29 23:38:06 2015 UTC,"There are much better grenade classes. Asari Vanguards grenade build is ridiculous, and in general someone with primer or detonating power with nades is better. And much more interesting to play.   Maybe people just don't want to run to ammo boxes."
MECoOp,30mszg,GundalfTheCamo,1 point,Sun Mar 29 10:19:43 2015 UTC,I think that's being a little unfair. The Demolisher is a fascinating class when used right.
MECoOp,30mszg,ScareTheRiven,1 point,Sun Mar 29 11:09:50 2015 UTC,"Could expand on that thought a little?   How is it used right? I've been throwing nades, shooting and throwing even more nades, and re-planting the nade vending machine when possible to get more nades. Also running from ammo box to ammo box to get even more nades.  Basically like a crackhead looking for the next nade-fix. Is that the right way?"
MECoOp,30mszg,GundalfTheCamo,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:14:33 2015 UTC,"Heads up, I haven't played in months.   I haven't had a lot of Plat experience with the Demolisher, but from the Solo's that I've seen it seems like that she uses her Supply Pylon and Melee as back-ups when she gets overwhelmed.   Maybe ""fascinating"" was a bit over-zealous, but she certainly isn't boring."

MECoOp,30mszg,EatsDirtWithPassion,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"It's just raw shooting damage and some crowd control with the recond mine (it's important to spec that extra damage from all source though).   Talon with extended magazine takes out a Gold Atlas in one magazine split into two cloak (+recon mine) cycles. On Gold cerberus every mook is a one shot, Dragoon is two shot and Phantoms vary - they seem to have some weird damage reduction when in a pose or flipping out.   I did have the best equipment (pistol gear + pistol III equipment + AP IV ammo). But you're living on situational awareness and shieldgate.   It's ridiculous. Hurricane is similarly crazymode."
MECoOp,30mszg,GundalfTheCamo,1 point,Tue Mar 31 07:51:25 2015 UTC,"The GI with a Javalin is the most powerful sniper in the game. In addition to this, the Geth Infiltrator is an excellent platform for pretty much all other weapon types as well (Claymore, Piranha, Harrier, Hurricane, etc.) , can be used to abuse cloaked proximity mine as a power-focused class, and also has a pretty kick-ass melee build as well that can walk up to a cluster of any human sized enemy (even phantoms) and kill them all within 1.5 seconds."
MECoOp,30na9f,LasersAndRobots,6,Sat Mar 28 23:14:31 2015 UTC,"For your first question, yes the two evolutions do stack. Here's a table that has a bunch of the damages for combos in it. This table also demonstrates another point that you might not have known if you didn't know the combo buffs stacked. Warp --> Shockwave is the most powerful combo detonation in the game because of Shockwave's 65% buff to combo detonations.  The second question i'm less sure about, but i'm pretty sure the combo damage isn't attributed to either ability. Some abilities such as Cryo Blast or Proxy mine make a target take more damage, and i think i've observed that when you make somebody else's attack deal more damage to a target, you get those points towards that ability (whether it's proxy mine, recon mine, or cryo blast). This is easiest to see on a recon mine with invasive scan or on cryo blast specced to make enemies take more damage.  Third Question: the order of events in a combo detonation is that the detonating power deals it's damage first, then the detonation occurs, including primary target damage and splash damage. Most of the time, this leads to things like a cannibal dying to incinerate or overload, but a combo still detonating on their corpse before they hit the ground. What might be the case is that you suffered from a little lag and you simply didn't see the animation for the detonation on your screen."

You fine people have given me a much better understanding of how this game works and I've gotten so much better because of it.   I'm still kinda baffled how some of you figured this shit out
MECoOp,30na9f,Robertamus,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:34:30 2015 UTC,"Warp/throw does over 4000 damage to armor on gold and more on plat. In order to kill a typical shielded enemy, you'd need to do warp>throw>throw, as the BE is weaker vs. shields and will leave health left over. It's better and much faster to just use a weapon to take care of shields, then finish with a quick throw and move on to the next enemy. Only prime with warp on stuff that has armor. The acolyte is the obvious choice and can also prime with ammo, but if you don't have one/aren't good with it there are other shotguns or pistols that will work similarly as shield-strippers at their optimal ranges.  Throw does a little damage on its own and then more damage when the enemy collides with a surface or ragdolls on the ground depending on its velocity. Highly weakened enemies it will kill on impact before the biotic or ammo explosion damage needs to be factored in, and sometimes the ammo explosion won't be quite enough to kill but the collision/ragdoll will.  I never really payed attention to the class/power challenges, but I'm pretty sure any time a power of yours is involved in a biotic explosion you get the points for it. Singularity would be almost impossible to get otherwise, but since it steals priming credit it will actually level up really fast if you're playing with other biotics."
MECoOp,30na9f,ginja_ninja,1 point,Sun Mar 29 05:40:34 2015 UTC,I made an explosion damage calculator a while ago.
MECoOp,30na9f,smedes,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"Both Warp and Throw have a ""detonate"" evolution, which increases combo detonation force, radius and damage by 50% or something. Now, when a target is primed with Warp and detonated with throw, do those stack on each other?   In fact, they iirc multiply together. 1.5 times 1.5 to give 2.25. link: forum.bioware.com/topic/396725-combo-explosion-damage-formula-damage-table-tested-in-game/   Second, I only got the multiplayer expansions recently, and got wondering about this while working on the Biotic God challenges (which, for those who don't remember) require you to earn a certain amount of points with each power. When a target is, say, primed by Singularity and detonated by Shockwave, do the points count toward Singularity, Shockwave or both?   iirc on the scoreboard at the end of the game, the combo damage is attributed to the primer, not the detonator. This is why dark channel is the most annoying possible primer.  I think - think - it works the same way for challenges.   Finally (although I'm pretty sure I've figured this out myself and want to confirm it), do detonating powers deal damage before detonating proper? Because I've had a couple occasions where an enemy with a sliver of health left has been primed with Warp, hit by Throw, and then doesn't explode. The killfeed also reads that it's been killed by Throw. It would make sense according to the game's logic, and would also explain why the Warp/Throw detonation seems to deal less damage until Throw gets the ""inflict 200 points on impact"" evolution.

This has to do with the charging mechanic of their Geth shotgun and was never fixed.  Geth Bomber are bugged in that quite often Overload doesn't affect them and doesn't jump (minor gripe, but shit's annoying).  Rocket Troopers are bugged and sometimes double or triple rocket you. This can lead to instant death if your healthgate cooldown hasn't run down.    However I wouldn't fault them on difficulty. All the units are quite weak in terms of armor/health.

MECoOp,30h4sx,Scarecrow1779,11,Fri Mar 27 19:08:41 2015 UTC,Geth put out a higher and more accurate volume of long range fire than any other faction. A Prime and a couple rocket troopers catching you out of cover and you're as good as dead if you get staggered. That or eat an ops pack. But wait there's more! How about 3 hunters partying around your body so you can be stunlocked to death when you get up and not even be able to reload your damn weapon?  On maps with long sight lines (London the worst example) Geth are incredibly annoying.
MECoOp,30h4sx,funkymustafa,3,Fri Mar 27 14:26:39 2015 UTC,"Cerberus easily trumps geth in terms of long-range damage output between centurions, turrets, atlases, and phantoms. And on top of that none of it's dodgeable, unlike rocket troopers and prime pulses."

MECoOp,30h4sx,carnage_panda,10,Sat Apr 4 12:53:36 2015 UTC,"so everyone else has mentioned most of the major gripes like bugs and lots of stagger, but you also mentioned your lack of experience on Gold and Plat, so i'll throw in my 2 cents on Geth's difficulty specifically at those difficulties.  Geth Primes become infinitely more annoying when you have more than one together, and on Platinum, there's even a wave with 3 primes. With the drones they throw out, this means that that wave has 14 different sources of enemy fire on the map at once. In addition to having some of the highest ranged damage output in the game, the Prime also staggers you, it's rocket drone staggers you, and it has more armor than Scions or Ravagers. Atlases are easier at range because they take a long time to shoot rockets that are easy to dodge.  In addition to this, when using cloak, the Prime's turrets seem to fire on you when any other unit would have lost track of you. I've had multiple times when a Combat Drone or Geth Turret has downed me after I initiated duration cloak on the far side of the map and then ran into the area they were in.  Despite all this and the double rocket bullshit, i still feel like Geth are the easiest faction because they have no sync kills, no bubble shields, and Pyros, Hunters, and Troopers tend to bunch together, making easy targets for anything with AoE damage."
MECoOp,30h4sx,Scarecrow1779,3,Fri Mar 27 14:58:10 2015 UTC,This is pretty much it. Geth on Gold/Plat are an entirely different experience from lower levels because the enemies that seem 'not that bad' when you've got one are a nightmare when they're clustered. Heaven help you if you end up with geth without a character who can take down shields quickly.
MECoOp,30h4sx,aerrin,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"Drones are specifically designed to see through stealth, and allow the Prime and its turrets to do so as well. Snipe those balloons from a distance if you want to stealth in."

MECoOp,30h4sx,Nightelfpala,3,Sat Mar 28 17:36:33 2015 UTC,There are few things in this game more annoying than watching your guy do a drunken dance under the sustained fire of two to three primes plus their drones.
MECoOp,30h4sx,anrad,2,Fri Mar 27 19:41:57 2015 UTC,"Bombers are a pain in the ass (why are they so tough for something so small? why are they considered armoured?) and rocket troopers are way too common, but aside from that I feel like they're generally less of a headache than Collectors (double Possessed Scion/Praetorian, anyone?) overall.  If you know you're going up against Geth, I would recommend taking a class with Sabotage. Geth are all synthetics. Sabotage makes affected synthetics fight for you. Whack a Prime with it and it'll clean house for you.   Likewise it makes Cerberus' Atlas (despite it having a human pilot) and turrets go berzerk. Great power for those two factions, but not so hot against Reapers/Collectors."

MECoOp,30h4sx,IngwazK,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:12:00 2015 UTC,Especially since so many of their units like to get up close (Pyro and Hunter). The main annoyance is that the Prime is one of the worst units to go up against when you mess up your positioning and get caught in the open.
MECoOp,30h4sx,Scarecrow1779,2,Mon Mar 30 09:27:10 2015 UTC,"When the game first shipped, the Geth were very exploitable. And by exploitable, I mean they were the credit piñata faction. Given the patching limitations imposed by the consoles, the devs were very limited into the variables they could manipulate for hot fixes. So, in response to people farming the shit out of the Geth, Bioware turned the health, damage, and stunlock knobs to eleven. Once they were able to tweak the game mechanics via DLC and patch, things evened out a bit.   After all of the balancing and patches, the Geth ended up as one of the most polarizing classes. Certain loadouts trivialize the Geth, while others are ragdolled by them. The thing that pisses people off the most is the stunlock. It's really not that fun to play around and against, but I suppose they needed something in place of sync kills."
MECoOp,30h4sx,JubalTheLion,2,Tue Mar 31 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"I think it mostly just comes from people whose favorite classes don't handle them well. A destroyer with devastator mode trivializes geth. Anyone with an acolyte and some kind of health-killing power like pull, throw, or lash will obliterate hunters and rocket troopers. The firing-from-stagger problem goes away if they're ragdolled. The quarian female infiltrator has a field day with them as long as she's using a reasonably decent gun (crusader with phasic or disruptor ammo is my preferred choice).  Really the only thing you have to be careful about is pyros spawning behind you and making sure you don't get caught in the open around a prime.  And fucking combat drones. And turrets appearing through walls. Honestly those two are really the only things I think are actual bullshit about geth. Of course n7 destroyer still laughs in the face of them along with everything else.  Oh also the fact that overload sometimes doesn't do anything to bombers. That's complete bs and makes a power that used to be one of the best in the game to bring to a geth fight less appealing compared to just packing an acolyte."

Once it winds up and starts charging, sidestep back to your original position. You'd be surprised how easily this works even in tight spaces. Even if it does barely catch you, the Brute will continue on past you instead of you being knocked back with the thing still right in your face. Very useful when you have the one Brute who decides he's gonna be a Big Goddamn Hero and block your way to the LZ with 10 seconds left.  Ravager - Singularity nukes swarmers instantly. Cast one on the ravager, pop the sacks, watch all the swarmers die on the spot.  Banshee - For snipers, the hitbox for her head actually extends slightly into the force-field aura effect above her skull. I found this out on Giant when she was attacking some teammates in the indoor area near the LZ. I could only see the very top of the force-field graphic, not her actual head, so I thought fuck it, might as well shoot given how Praetorians/Phantoms also take forcefield damage. Credited me with a headshot. I'm sure piercing may also play a part as this was with a cloaked Javelin X w/HVB. Fairly sure she was in hand-of-denial mode so it may only  work when that is active.  Phantoms - Singularity again makes them a joke. Throw it, they put up the bubble, strip their barrier (Talon or Acolyte excel at this), they instantly get pulled in.  Praetorian - Because of how massive they are, wide spread shotguns (Raider, Piranha) are disproportionately effective since all the pellets hit them from a longer range. Very nasty combo with warp ammo and a biotic primer - extra nasty on someone like a Drell adept who can easily outmaneuver them and instantly prime. Generally you can also run by them while they are firing the lasers and they will not stop to melee you. Not advisable to press your luck there but if cornered, it's an option."

So if you've got a good combo team going you'll just see them die ""in the mix"".   Also when in protective bubble, force of over 1000 Newtowns (Gold limit) will break the stance. Which means that a correctly specced biotic charge will allow you to break the bubble and melee a phantom to death.  Geth Prime are confused by the Human Engineers (or Volus Sentinels) Drone, and will concentrate attacks on that until the Drone is gone.   Additionally I'd like to point out that enough damage will cancel any instakill animation. Phantoms instakill animation is so fast I've only seen them broken a couple of times."

MECoOp,30cufq,Jandolino,3,Fri Mar 27 08:02:08 2015 UTC,A noobish question:  What does the bubble (Praetorians for example) exactly do? - should one wait until it is down again or is it better to keep shooting?
MECoOp,30cufq,Scarecrow1779,6,Thu Mar 26 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"Whether the Praetorian keeps flying or lands, the bubble has a set duration, and once it times out, there's a cool down before the Praetorian can activate the bubble again. This means that if there's a Praetorian really far away from you, go ahead and trigger its bubble. By the time it gets closer to you, the bubble will have timed out and you will have a window of a few seconds to cast powers on it, even when it's still flying. this window is usually enough to get off 1 or 2 biotic combos. This window also exists after banshees do their nova thing that creates a shockwave.  One big tip for bubble shields though is to not trigger it all the time. That's a wasted power that you could have directed at another nearby enemy, and also you might be blocking a lot of damage from your teammates by triggering it. Some powers like Flamer, which only deals damage over time, won't trigger the bubble shield, but if a teammate triggers the bubble, then flamer cannot deal any more damage til th bubble shield is gone."
MECoOp,30cufq,Scarecrow1779,3,Thu Mar 26 14:28:34 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention this since this is usually rarely useful, it's always better to prioritize non-boss units during normal rounds; I really only use this during hack circles.  Also, flamer will trigger the bubble."

MECoOp,30cufq,briefcandle,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:32:10 2015 UTC,"A trick to dealing with Geth Primes:  Like stated in the OP, if you destroy their drones, their priority will be to cast more drones, not attack. While the Geth Turret gets thrown somewhere far away from the Prime, the Combat Drone always gets dropped right in front of the Prime. This can be abused by using piercing ammo or mods. Every time a Combat Drone spawns, make sure to line up your shots so you're hitting both it and the Prime. The piercing ammo or mod means you're not wasting any significant damage on the drones, but the Prime will not shoot at you nearly as much because it is constantly having to recast its combat drone. This can also be abused if your attack mode has splash damage like flamer, combo detonations, grenades, etc.  For Pyros:  If they are facing you, and you have any piercing on your weapon, aim for the upper torso, neck, and head. Your bullets will pierce through the pyros body and hit the canister on its back, dealing double damage. This can be used to one-shot a pyro with powerful sniper rifles, even when not using phasic ammo.  Anything that can Sync Kill:   This tip is for melee characters and Biotic Charge users. Know when an enemy can and can't sync kill you. Phantoms, Atlases, Brutes, Scions, and Praetorians have to melee before they can initiate a sync kill. this doesn't mean that they have to melee the person they're going to sync kill. A phantom could melee your teammate and as you run up to save them, the phantom could turn around and kill you. Phantoms using their bubble shield or cloak also can't melee, and Scions or Atlases shooting at you ends their ability to sync kill until they melee again.   Banshees and Praetorians have distinct modes and can only melee in one of those modes. The banshee has 2 modes: One where it teleports, walks, melees and sync kills, and one where it is stationary, throws warp balls, nova, and can put up its power blocking energy barrier (which is larger than the aura it has when teleporting). Praetorians have 3 modes: Flying mode, melee/walking/leaping mode, and laser/missile mode. Any time a Praetorian is in the air or firing lasers/missiles or a Banshee is throwing warp balls and putting up it's bubble shield, you can melee without worrying about sync kills. Just be ready to GTFO if the banshee screams (it's changing modes) or if the Praetorian changes stances. Banshees are much easier to safely melee because they take longer to swap between modes, where as Praetorians swap between modes pretty quickly."
MECoOp,30cufq,mcquotables,2,Thu Mar 26 14:36:03 2015 UTC,"A side note for Phantoms: if you break their sword, they can still synch kill you if they performed a melee attack before their sword was broken. Here's a YouTube of it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXNH2ahXRa8"

I find they're unique in that they can be either laughably easy or freaking Kryptonite, depending on my kit and loadout.  So, here are a few things I use to make short work of them.     Stasis. The silver bullet. Stops their shennanigans and lets you headshot or explode them at your leisure. N7 Paladin. The invincibubble makes it tough to reliably detonate explosions, since a lot of combos rely on projectile powers. Snap freeze then Energy Drain works every time and just wipes them out. Ammo primers and Overload. Another way to consistently trigger explosions. Any hitscan detonator, like Energy Drain or Reave, will work. Though ED only detonates if they have some barrier left. AOE/Projectile weapons. The Venom and Acolyte are useful tools, since they make it pretty easy to hit those squirrely buggers. Also good for applying ammo effects, and the Acolyte of course destroys barriers."

With the Vanguard I feel biotic combo is better since it allows you to easily detonate with charge. This is less important on the adept since singularity is a much better primer and electrical Smash still detonates biotic primes.   I switched to electrical just for the hell of it tbh since I've been playing this game for so long. Have not really noticed much difference in time-to-kill against bosses. I play exactly the same way. Smash already does so much damage that the difference between +30% upfront or +50% DOT over the time you would be attacking is probably like 1 weapon shot or 1 bar of armor in the end. I haven't spec'd the adept with biotic combo in a while, but I've never felt hindered in any way with this current electrical smash build.   I have not ever tried the radius evo but hitting 1 added target is a minuscule advantage compared to the massively increased damage output from the armor damage evo. Unless you're playing below Gold and just fighting large numbers of mobs, then radius would be more effective."
MECoOp,30ewg0,funkymustafa,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:17:31 2015 UTC,I tried the electrical whip with radius a while ago just to try something different.  It sucks.  Always take the armor damage evo on smash.

MECoOp,30ewg0,sol_in_vic_tus,2,Fri Mar 27 02:34:08 2015 UTC,i'm actually ok with that since the splash damage from tech bursts hits other enemies farther away from the target than fire or cryo explosions.
MECoOp,30ewg0,wngmv,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:43:47 2015 UTC,"Electric Smash loses out damage big times on the Adept. You should be using warp ammo on your adept, which gives you extra damage with primed enemies. So now when you shoot at Smashed enemies, you don't get that 120% damage. That's a lot if you are using a hard hit weapon like Wraith or Talon.  Also, by choosing the right evolution you can get a bonus BE when singularity expires, if the enemy is primed. And Smash's cooldown allows you to use it twice.  My vanguard uses Electric Smash. Combined with a power amplifier you can get a lot mileage out of it. Use a weapon that primes well, you can get nonstop TB/FE out of your charge and Smash, with a crazy amount of damage from Smash alone. Another good thing is that Electric Smash staggers, which suits the vanguard.   TLDR, unless you are playing against Geth (even in that case I'd argue that Biotic Smash is not that bad), you lose DPS with electric smash, especially on the adept."

Two recon mines scanning the same enemy do not, two proximity mines on the same enemy do (if they came from different players). Warp will, bubble won't, cryo will, tac scan won't. The same power from the same player will not stack unless that power rhymes with ""diotic forbs,"" etc., etc.  The #1 ""gotcha"" I see, other than weird mods like smart choke on GPS, relates to power-blocking. For example, I see many players hitting floating Praetorians with overload or trying to use flamer on a Banshee that is putting up the hand of denial. Sometimes forcing the bubble is sensible, sometimes it's not. But no one ever tells you how these spacemagic bubbles work.   I think the worst part is that these unintuitive mechanics are amplified at higher difficulties, where there's abundant armor, power-blocking enemies, or limited ammo/grenades, which vary from map to map (on an imaginary scale from Condor to Rio).

If you look at these weapons in a class builder, they all ignore the damage reduction from enemy armor. they also have special, non-hitscan projectiles means that they can not penetrate cover (or guardian shields), no matter what mods or ammo they have. so, even with armor piercing ammo and piercing/shredder mods, they can't pierce, and already ignore amor, so they don't benefit from these."

IIRC the Mattock was a super powerful weapon in ME2 and is also pretty strong I think in ME3 SP.  In ME3 MP, the Mattock is a really great workhorse weapon. It's basically a lighter, semi-auto Harrier with higher ammo capacity. If you don't mind clicking a lot (or have some kind of clicking script to save your trigger finger) it's great. And it's an Uncommon, which makes it easily obtainable and easily ugpradeable. Definitely one of - if not the - best budget weapons in the game.  I'm a really big fan of the Kishock though. Absolutely huge damage, ignores shieldgate, pierces Guardian shields, breaks physics with hilarious ragdolling, has a comfortable scope zoom unlike most other sniper rifles, and is even chargeable so you can abuse Cloak with it for double dipping the Cloak damage.

My throw will detonate your fire explosion first, but warp is still active for its duration, so if I cast throw again in time it will detonate my original warp. It seems sort of glithcy, though (what isn't) like sometimes I won't get any explosions at all despite spamming my detonator.

If your not the dude doing the objective, there's two things you should considering:   Don't stand too close or in wrong position relative to the person doing the objective. Atlas rocket or brute charge may also cancel the activation. Also if Praetorian are around, don't stay on the exact line of fire between Praetorian and the objective. Do stand in an exposed position to draw enemy fire instead of the activator if the activation is in an open position and you didn't have time to kite the enemies elsewhere. Your health is not as important as the activation in most cases."
MECoOp,30a0pi,GundalfTheCamo,6,Fri Mar 27 08:29:50 2015 UTC,"One piece of advice I haven't seen here:  There is no reason to sit in hard cover.  Using soft cover and right hand advantage you deal more damage without having to worry about the enemy returning fire.    You should still use hard cover to dodge projectiles, but there is rarely a reason to shoot from it."
MECoOp,30a0pi,caesar_primus,4,Thu Mar 26 01:30:27 2015 UTC,"You also get a damage reduction while in hard cover, so if you take a banshee warp and get on a wall, you'll take less damage overall than if you were to run around."

For tech powers, if I am using something like throw to detonate, I actually like setting off tech/fire/cryo explosions, followed closely by the biotic explosion."
MECoOp,30a0pi,JubalTheLion,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:18:41 2015 UTC,"Screen shake can be caused by anything that has a lot of force behind it, mostly explosions, combos, grenades, etc.  However, I don't worry about it all that much.  If someone wants to snipe and they see a bunch of biotics in their party, they should either change class, or just accept the fact that they will have to deal with screen shake.  Even when I wanna snipe, I generally just deal with it.  Of course I usually run with faster, semi-auto sniper rifles like the Valiant.  So if a screen shake causes a miss, it's no big deal, I just pull the trigger again.  With something like a Javelin it's probably a much bigger problem, but the way I see it, that's the price you pay for carrying that heavy ass gun.  And in my experience, there is never even a reason to use heavy single-shot rifles like the Javelin.  It's overkill on Bronze and Silver, where the Viper can get you one-shot kills.  And on Gold it's simply outclassed by the Valiant and Black Widow.  Altho those guns do much less damage, they fire much faster, and you end up with a higher dps.  And on Platinum, I don't think I've even seen a sniper top the leaderboard.  You need to kill lots of things really fast, and snipers generally focus on single targets.  In the time someone can fire a shot with the Javelin, reload, and read to fire again, 2 biotics working together could have combined for about 5 biotic explosions, which should just about equal the damage of 1 cloaked Javelin X shot, except the biotic explosions are hitting 6 or 8 different bad guys, staggering some, knocking others to the ground, and killing 2 or 3.  And that doesn't even include the added effects from the actual biotic power which could be DOTs, CCs, or just some extra raw damage."

Whoa whoa whoa, let's ease up on the Javelin blasphemy. A good sniper with the Javelin has obscene DPS with near infinite range. If you haven't seen a Javelin sniper top a plat leaderboard, then those snipers are doing something wrong (or everyone else is a herrrrrricane GI or something).   In the time someone can fire a shot with the Javelin, reload, and read to fire again, 2 biotics working together could have combined for about 5 biotic explosions, which should just about equal the damage of 1 cloaked Javelin X shot, except the biotic explosions are hitting 6 or 8 different bad guys, staggering some, knocking others to the ground, and killing 2 or 3.    5 biotic explosions? You can reload cancel fire a Javelin in 2-3 seconds or faster. There is no way to generate 5 biotic explosions on a single target in that time even with 2 biotics. An infiltrator with the Javelin X is doing several times the single target damage than BEs, all without having to wait for silly things like ""teammates."" A good Javelin sniper can wax a single mooks faster than almost anyone and is certainly competitive at killing heavier targets. You can go through whole spawns very quickly, although obviously the fastest is still going to be CQC or grenade spammers. But those require moving.  It all comes down to preference. I wouldn't poo-poo the Javelin before you see the light of our lord and savior, the Javelin. Also, if nothing else, you can kill three dragoons with one shot, which makes the whole endeavor worthwhile."

MECoOp,30a0pi,mcquotables,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong here, haven't been playing in a while, but if I remember correctly the BW can oneshot all mooks with phasic ammo even on platinum.

MECoOp,30a0pi,Chypsylon,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:51:39 2015 UTC,"w/ cloak, yes. Jav should one-shot even out of the cloak cycle.   The delay is why I can't use BW properly anymore. But on the plus side I can play musical interludes with the Javelin between rounds."
MECoOp,30a0pi,mcquotables,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:31:03 2015 UTC,"I admitted the 5 explosions was a bit of an exaggeration, but the funny part is that its not even that big of an exaggeration.  I've logged something like 400-500 hours of mecoop, and as I said, I'm pretty sure every leader in a plat game I've been in relies on a power that isn't tactical cloak. Altho to be fair, I don't even see many people play as infiltrators in platinum very often, and there is a reason why. Big damage on one thing just doesn't cut it. Yeah, maybe your gun could kill 3 in one shot, but when are they ever lined up perfectly like that? At least 90% of your shots are on a single target. When I use biotic powers like reave, its the complete opposite, with probably 90% of the times I click it will hit 2-3 enemies. Then when it gets detonated, its hitting those same 2-3 guys again. And this isn't just true for biotics. The same can be done with tech like flamer, snap freeze, and chain overload.  Nothing beats a sniper for single target damage, I definitely agree there. But there's never just one target is there? Add more enemies, and a snipers DPs doesn't change. With biotics and tech, DPs goes up drastically the more enemies there are, because that just means there are more things that can explode. And each thing exploding is damaging everything around it. To a team of biotics, there is almost no difference in fighting one banshee or 3. By the time I'm done blowing up the first one, the other 2 will be dead already from the collateral damage, as will be the 4-5 smaller enemies nearby. Snipers would have to take on each one individually. Also you gotta account for the fact that none of the mooks will be attacking the group when the biotics are exploding everything, because thy will getting staggered and knocked around."

Altho to be fair, I don't even see many people play as infiltrators in platinum very often, and there is a reason why   I mean, I don't play infiltrator on platinum often because I don't like scorewhoring everything in sight.

MECoOp,30a0pi,mcquotables,0,Thu Mar 26 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"I play on 360, usually in evenings US East coast time... So if you play around then, you need to play more often.  Yes, a 4-biotic squad is ideal to me.  Sadly I don't see it as often as I like.  But you really don't have to be all that coordinated in game.  The coordination is mostly in the lobby.  As long as you all don't have the same powers, and have a decent mix of primers and detonators (bonus for things like Warp, Smash, and Reave which both prime and detonate) and you're good to go.  Then in game it's as simple as looking at a target for a split second to determine if it looks primed or not, then pick a power.  And if you have a power that can do both, spam it.  I see GIs destroy things on Gold, never even see people try to use them on Plat, to be fair they are pretty frail, and take some serious skill to avoid damage.  I see Ghosts in Plat, probably the most common infiltrator I see there other than maybe the AIU.  But practically all of the Ghosts I see usually run an assault rifle like the Lancer, and they may have led a board once in twice, but no Javelin.  And I'm pretty sure I've never seen an AIU snipe.  I typically see them run with things like the Hurricane or Reegar, and they usually chill near the bottom of the board.  To be fair tho, they are more about being tanky and surviving rather than dps.   I mean, I don't play infiltrator on platinum often because I don't like scorewhoring everything in sight.   Well maybe you should start, then I could see how ""godly"" it supposedly is, because I never see it happen.  So either you are a far better sniper than literally every single person I have ever played with in over 1100 games and nearly 400 hours, or all the snipers hate being called a ""scorewhore.""  I've seen the basic human soldier lead a plat match, and I mean it was no contest, 2x the score of everyone else in there (don't remember what the rest of squad was), and literally all he did was not die and spam Concussive Shot.

Actually, if someone dies far from the group, that's the best thing that can happen IMO.  For one, maybe they'll learn something.  And for two, when you stray into other areas of the map, it changes the enemy spawn points, as in they could now start coming from any direction... as in they could start spawning right behind the rest of the group... as in the rest of the group is now f***ed.

MECoOp,30a0pi,mcquotables,3,Thu Mar 26 16:30:45 2015 UTC,"Not everyone has a Black Widow. I have a Javelin VI, and that's my highest ultra-rare weapon. I've been trying to get a BW for a while now, but with no luck (been playing on and off since release, I have everything except for the BW, Spitfire, Lancer, and Blood Pack Punisher). That said, I wouldn't run any other sniper rifle on my GI. Javelin Scope + Piercing mod + High Velocity Barrel + drill rounds allows you to get headshots through any kind of cover, and Hunter Mode is amazing for picking out hidden targets.   Don't get me wrong, I love me some biotic combos and I really want a BW for my other infiltrators; but every so often I just want to kill things through 5 meters of solid concrete, and nothing is better than a GI with a Javelin for that.   I also prefer hard-hitting sniper rifles in both single and multiplayer. The BW is the weakest sniper (per shot, not dps) I can bring myself to use in the campaign, and I freakin' love it there. Now, is running single-shot rifles on gold/platinum ideal for dps? Well, no, but I'm much more comfortable with the Javelin and Widow than I am with the Indra or Valiant. So I guess all I'm trying to say is, to each his own?"
MECoOp,30a0pi,SendoaM,2,Thu Mar 26 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"just nit-picking here: Pretty sure the Mantis, Raptor, Viper, Incisor, Valiant, and Indra all deal less damage per shot than the BW.  I haven't played with stacking nearly as much penetration as you have, so I have a question: is there any such thing as an un-piercable surface? Are there any walls that can't be shot through, even if you have enough penetration distance to do so? also, what about shooting through the group, like when you're at the top of a ramp and the enemy drops out of normal sight for a second?"
MECoOp,30a0pi,Scarecrow1779,2,Thu Mar 26 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"I never meant to imply the other semi auto snipers did more per shot than the BW, but I think the Mantis and BW are actually tied for damage per shot.   And to answer your question: every surface can be pierced if you have the proper mods. The deciding factor is how thick the cover is. If the target drops out of sight when you're on the ramp, so long as the amount of ramp that needs to be pierced is less or equal to what your weapon and mods allow, you'll be able to hit said target.   A Javelin with the proper mods and ammo can penetrate multiple walls so long as the total amount of cover is less than 5.95 meters. If the target is purple in the scope view, it can be hit, hence why I love it so much."
MECoOp,30a0pi,SendoaM,2,Fri Mar 27 04:33:20 2015 UTC,"In the time someone can fire a shot with the Javelin, reload, and read to fire again, 2 biotics working together could have combined for about 5 biotic explosions   Reloading the Javelin takes 1.38 seconds (with reload canceling of course), even with perfect coordination there's no way to cause 5 explosions, just because of the travel time of the skills alone."
MECoOp,30a0pi,Chypsylon,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, it was a bit of an exaggeration... but I promise you, 2 biotics can out dps 2 snipers in Platinum any day.  Travel time of powers is irrelevant, you're only limited by the CD of your powers.  For one, it's not like the CD waits until the power hits a target before starting the timer, it starts as soon as you click the button.  And for 2, things like the Reave, Annihilation Field, and Dark Channel are instantaneous, having no travel time at all.  Not to mention things like the aforementioned AF and DC, as well as the Justicar's Sphere stay activated for like 45sec-1min.  Once they're up, you don't have to worry about them for a while.  Plus you have things like the Biotic Orbs and Seeker Swarms that can be used to detonate things 3-4 times before you get a CD.  While 5 explosions in that time for only 2 biotics may be a tall order, it would be very feasible for 3, provided you had the right 3, and they were set up before the wave started.  Mind you they wouldn't be able to keep that rate up for long, but that burst damage can be enough to finish off a group, and while the enemies are spawning on the other side of the map, you can set up again.  No different than a sniper getting ammo really."
MECoOp,30a0pi,Shiboleth17,3,Wed Mar 25 22:19:22 2015 UTC,2 biotics can out dps 2 snipers in Platinum any day   Even 2 GIs?
MECoOp,30a0pi,Sebastianthorson,2,Thu Mar 26 09:13:06 2015 UTC,"Challenge accepted :P  But I would say this depends on the map (Glacier would be great for explosions, Rio way better for sniping) and you need a partner with good coordination to chain the explosions while you don't need to rely on anyone else while sniping. And one can killsteal easier with a sniper, thus netting more points."
MECoOp,30a0pi,Chypsylon,2,Wed Mar 25 22:24:41 2015 UTC,The javelin can actually end up with fairly comparable damage output vs. bosses as well as one-shot-kills against normal enemies when equipped with the right ammo. The issue is that it's less versatile because you're always forced to focus all your damage into one target whereas with a black widow you can spread it around if the situation calls for it. You can kill a brute in 3 shots or 3 cannibals in 3 shots. Not to even get into how much higher the usability is with the absence of firing delay.
MECoOp,30a0pi,ginja_ninja,1 point,Sat Mar 28 19:58:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly...  And the thing is, you don't WANT to focus on bosses, especially in gold/plat, because of how spawn works.

MECoOp,30970w,caesar_primus,0,Thu Mar 26 05:11:37 2015 UTC,I was exaggerating
MECoOp,30970w,Salsadips,2,Thu Mar 26 07:08:20 2015 UTC,"Look for the Round of 16 voting later today.  Only 2 upsets in Round 2, based on the seeding.  The N7 Shadow, the only N7 character that was an underdog in this round, managed to beat the 9-seeded Geth Engineer, so all 6 N7 classes are still in.  The Krogan Warlord also won a very close upset against the Nova-guard.  Beyond that, all matches went as expected based on the seeding.  Cannot believe the Justicar left so early.  Definitely my favorite class, and an extremely useful class no matter how you play.  Oh well."
MECoOp,30970w,Davare,2,Wed Mar 25 14:40:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for doing this. It's been fun to follow and has sparked some heated debates between my daughter and I.
MECoOp,30970w,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"darn. 3 of my favorite biotic classes are out. oh well, plenty of favorites still in the running."

MECoOp,30970w,Scarecrow1779,2,Wed Mar 25 18:27:06 2015 UTC,"it's a series of surveys where everyone votes for their favorite classes. it started with everyone voting for their favorite 5 from each class (adept/sentinel/etc). from there, the top 5 were taken from each class, with 2 wild cards thrown in, and all were put into a bracket. from there, a new survey has been posted for each round. OP is the awesome individual that put it all together."
MECoOp,30970w,sihtydaernacuoytihsy,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've long dreamed about Me3 pvp, and I half hoped someone modded that together. Your explanation makes sense.  I am disappointed about the Geth Engineer. That, and I f*ing hate playing Krogan. The rest of the bracket seems right on."
MECoOp,30970w,Scarecrow1779,3,Wed Mar 25 18:49:58 2015 UTC,"it's not PvP. it's just picking which classes you prefer over the others. which is your favorite? some people voted based on what they have fun using, but it seems most people are basing it on straight up damage output, valuing that a bit over team synergy. all considerations are still within a co-op against AI enemies framework though."
MECoOp,30970w,sihtydaernacuoytihsy,2,Wed Mar 25 18:55:25 2015 UTC,"So I gathered. I like the little Geth characters, the chicks with AF, and biotic explosions. Also, titanfall. Shhhh..."
MECoOp,30970w,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:58:57 2015 UTC,your secret's safe with me.   i'm a krogan and juggernaut fanboy. my favorite biotic's already out of the running though (asari huntress).
MECoOp,30970w,ScareTheRiven,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:14:29 2015 UTC,no vorcha sentinel...
MECoOp,30970w,ScareTheRiven,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:43:51 2015 UTC,"There are a few not included, those weren't voted in."
MECoOp,30970w,caesar_primus,1 point,Thu Mar 26 10:21:10 2015 UTC,"Damn I'm good, I managed to pick every single one."
MECoOp,3099a7,Shiboleth17,8,Wed Mar 25 14:48:31 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who doesn't much like the N7 Shadow or Slayer classes?  RIP Asari Huntress <3
MECoOp,3099a7,zhouster,3,Wed Mar 25 18:40:33 2015 UTC,"I like the shadow well enough, but the huntress is one of my favorites. Shame to see it knocked out this early."
MECoOp,3099a7,Robertamus,2,Wed Mar 25 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"To me, the Shadow is a novelty class for when i feel like teleporting around and meleeing everything. it's definitely gold viable, but it still leaves me feeling like i've played a class that doesn't have a lot of substance to it. the slayer, on the other hand, is a total damage output badass. the first time i picked it up, i solo'd through a geth silver like it was nothing. Phase Disruptor deals massive damage in a very wide radius and takes only 1/5th of your shields. It's also an amazing tech detonator (try it with the Paladin)."
MECoOp,3099a7,Scarecrow1779,2,Wed Mar 25 22:59:45 2015 UTC,I'm the opposite. I like every single one of the N7 classes with a particular love for the Shadow. I've spent the majority of my gameplay with the flaming sword and I don't regret it.
MECoOp,3099a7,ScareTheRiven,2,Thu Mar 26 10:27:29 2015 UTC,You have a thing for chicks with swords according to your name.
MECoOp,3099a7,RKPB,2,Fri Mar 27 04:22:25 2015 UTC,"Goodam it, this is the 400th time now.   It's not related to LoL at all. It's a reference to a book that I read years ago."
MECoOp,3099a7,ScareTheRiven,1 point,Fri Mar 27 04:24:28 2015 UTC,"They are both very fun and viable classes on higher difficulties, but they aren't nearly as good as the voting is suggesting."
MECoOp,3099a7,caesar_primus,2,Thu Mar 26 17:59:41 2015 UTC,"I fear my queen: the N7 Demolisher, will be demolished this round 😪  Also why was the Drell Infiltrator never in this? I love recon mines..."
MECoOp,3099a7,ANiceOakTree,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:41:42 2015 UTC,"i hope so. i love me some jugs.  ya, i would have taken the drell infiltrator over the FQE in a heartbeat"
MECoOp,3099a7,Scarecrow1779,3,Wed Mar 25 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"Geez, round one was a heartbreaker. So many tough matches, so many favorites knocked out. And now I don't think my beloved Asari Adept stands a chance against the Paladin.    I'm predicting GI vs Fury final two, and a GI win (surprising nobody)."
MECoOp,3099a7,briefcandle,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:31:38 2015 UTC,When does this round end?
MECoOp,3099a7,RKPB,1 point,Fri Mar 27 04:23:20 2015 UTC,"it's over, I'm bout to have round of  8 posted in a sec"
