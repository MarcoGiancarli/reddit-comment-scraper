dvdasa,3e361y,nuketown247,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:11 2015 UTC,Looks like the same footage from the Dirty Hands documentary.

dvdasa,3e361y,Halfalien-halfretard,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"I was thinking thinking the same, for those sceptical kevin smith did confirm being involved in an interview. It might just be old footage with new interviews.  SYNOPSIS David Choe wagered his $60K painting fee for Facebook stock now worth over $250MM. Facebook/Napster founder Sean Parker, directors Eli Roth and Kevin Smith, street artists Shepard Fairey and Mr. Brainwash plus adult film star Sasha Grey, share their insights."
dvdasa,3e361y,theuniverse1985,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"This looks like Dirty Hands just with new interviews with Kevin Smith and Sean Parker.. is that it? I guess for people who don't know who David Choe it will be a great way to get new exposure but not too sure if there will be a lot more new material. I look forward to any documentary about the DVDASA Crew. I really think there should be an Asa Akira documentary, I'm sure it will be widely popular especially after her first book."

Your inner monologue can take on a very ominous tone as it is.  I've considered any kind radio/podcast environment as being a kind of morphogenic field for the karma of other people. Especially the same studio/people/personalities. Like a great stew of karmic mire and bad vibe. Especially DVDASA. Personally, your experience sounds like quite the hellride, but you gave into the FEAR.   Like Burroughs postulated, ""Language is a virus"".  Like Jerry Garcia said, ""At times I believe language is alive and it is using us to do it's dirty work. Like, all this war is the result of languages seeking dominance over potential hosts"".

Slantyeyedgook, no matter where you are, I'm willing to travel to get lunch, dinner or whatever. I'm flexible with time and location.

But i didnt die. I did shrooms. Now i cant get depressed really. I just feel like a delusional insane person whos ok. My suggestion is do something big. Crazy. New. Fun. Dangerous even.

Art will never die. We still talk about cave paintings in the BC eras. I see it this way, I'm making my own path in life. There will be no one like me, I will not be able to be duplicated. I decided to dedicate my life as much as possible to document the cast members of DVDASA. DVDASA will never die. Even if the website and the servers are turned off. There will be people that cherish and hold the memories of DVDASA. More spawn podcasts will be created due to DVDASA. You won't need 2000 years for modern civilization to end. We are on the brink of global destruction everyday of our lives. As long as I am alive, I will keep trying to find new shit. I will keep posting it up. Fuck, if I have to create my own podcast called DVDASA, I will do that.   You realize this is Art. DVDASA will live on forever. There's going to be some kid in the year 2500 AD that will be jerking off to Asa's pussy cam. I am thankful to live in a time of future shit. I'm happy to witness the beautiful masterpiece of what DVDASA is.   Yes, I might be obsessed but how am I different from a Christian that is obsessed with the bible? How am I different from the radical muslims that trying to take over this world? The fact is, I'm trying to be positive towards one another. I don't want to ruin the lives of the people in DVDASA. I do whatever I can to support. I bought Asa's Book twice. Members of my family have been mentioned on the podcast before. I'm just being a true supporter and fan of DVDASA.   I have a lot of free time on my hands and I decided what is the best way to spend my time. There are a lot of people that listen to DVDASA. I try my best to find things that could motivate them. There might be the next major artist that listens to DVDASA to make it, guess what? It's going to be my hard work and dedication that found an article that allowed them to push it. I might be a middle man but fuck, I'm going to do my best while I still can. The next asa akira might be on this subreddit looking at different interviews of Asa that I posted up. I understand that it might not influence anyone. Most people on this subreddit probably want me to stop posting shit. I'm sure there are people that are sick of me constantly posting, well, to them, if my research has helped a single person be motivated to do something positive in this world, then I did my job. So for you, /u/jungleasian. What have you been doing today? What did you do to contribute to society?    Edit: /u/jungleasian, I was going to invite you to lunch but instead thanks for motivating me today to post this up. Thanks for contributing something in my life."
