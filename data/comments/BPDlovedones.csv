BPDlovedones,3e2tgw,toodleoo57,3,Tue Jul 21 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"My BPDSO's dad falls right into this.  I can't say for sure that his dad has BPD (my SO's mom sure does), but his dad is a strong, strong narcissist, and since it's still in the spectrum of personality disorders, there's a lot of overlap.  Without going into too many details, my FIL was a very important man in their hometown, and in his industry, which drew a much wider audience.  There have been documentaries on major cable networks in recent years, if that gives you any sort of indication about his perceived importance.  Everything in that family was (and still is) about putting up a flawless public persona.  I could tell you stories about how they treated my SO that would stun you.  That, in any other family, would have had the child removed and put into foster care.    When I met my SO, he idolized his dad.  I'm pretty sure he still does.  I heard story after story about how great his dad was and how everyone worshipped him.  The first time I met this guy, I instantly didn't like him.  All he ever talked about was himself and the great things he did and accomplished.  And I would see how he would subtlety put his son (my SO) down.  In my FIL's eyes, he saw his son as competition, so he did everything he could to sabotage him.   Slowly, with my prodding, my SO started realizing how abusive his parents were.  He started standing up to his parents when they would put him down.  This made things a lot worse.  There were long periods of estrangement.  My SO would buy them extravagant gifts trying to buy their affection.  Instead he would get an email that it wasn't enough, or worse, ignored altogether.  Yet my SO continued to idolize him (my SO never much cared for his mother).  A month before our wedding, his dad sent an email and BCC'd me on it saying what an awful person my SO was.  He put my SO down in front of my parents on our wedding day.  There were huge fights all the time about how he wasn't living up to their expectations (even though my SO is successful in his own line of work). Our communication became more and more distant, which I felt was healthier for my SO.  Then I became pregnant.  We begrundingly told his parents only because we knew they would have an utter meltdown if they found out on Facebook.  They didn't really care.  Then we found out we were having a boy.  He was going to be the first male to carry on the family name in a generation.  By the way he carried on, you would have thought my FIL impregnated me himself.  Suddenly we were back on the good list.  It was short lived though.  There was a perceived slight on my in-laws part and my husband was back on this shit list.  They still act like they're the doting grandparents to the rest of the family even though they have no contact with us and steal Facebook pictures to use as ""proof"" of a relationship.  I desperately want to block them.  His parents still email me from time to time and talk to me as if nothing has ever happened.  And like their son doesn't even exist.  I haven't responded to a single one of their emails.   Ironically, his dad had quite a fall from grace over the past several years, so that whole public persona thing was all for nothing."
BPDlovedones,3e2tgw,always_awake9,2,Tue Jul 21 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"This doesn't even really go into the effect their absence has on you - they're so busy making nice with the outside world it's as though home life doesn't matter.  My particular BPD will go weeks without calling me at certain times of the year (which is great in some ways actually) but will then call me up and give me a hard time for 'not being in touch.'  Her public life is really all that matters to her, to the point where I even wonder why she had me - I think she wouldn't have, had she been born even ten years later."
BPDlovedones,3dzoxf,saythereshope,5,Mon Jul 20 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"Here's my experience with my BPDSO's rages: the first year of our relationship, I experienced one very brief episode early on. This was during the honeymoon phase of the relationship when we were completely smitten with each other. He flew off the handle one night because he had come across an old facebook picture of me and my ex that I was still tagged in. It was so old and inconsequential and yet he thought I was hiding something from him. He was very mistrustful and threatening to leave the state I lived in to go back to where he resided. It was midnight.   Another night, a similar thing happened. This time while we were at a friend's house. He just up and left the social engagement while visiting. I ran out after him. He said he was leaving, would stay at a hotel more than likely. I insisted he not, and that he come back home with me. I plead with him not to go. He said he felt me and my very good friend were making jokes at his expense. It was blown way out of proportion. We argued in the street, I tried to hug him and show him I loved him but he pulled away. Finally, I convinced him to go home with me.  Then he started breaking things. He often talks about having this black out rage switch that gets flipped on and once that happens, there's no turning back. He's broken my camera, too many dishes to count, furniture, items that were gifted to me as a child, clocks, and he's threaten to break so much more (including my face).   Well around the two year marker (a year after we moved in together), after an explosive argument in which he--you guessed it--he broke shit, I sat him down and said ""I can't live like this. You need to get back into therapy to work on your anger or I can't be in this relationship"".   He did. I don't know what he and his therapist talked about or worked on. It seemed to help for a while. And yet after 5 years, I can cite at least 5 or 6 more note-worthy instances of him completely losing it (when dysregulated). Once, he went ape shit on our living room and it literally looked like a tornado hit when all was said and done. I took a picture prior to cleaning up in case something worse ever happened. It was horrible.   I'm sure on the surface, it seems like I was the innocent one caught in his wrath. But in reality, I look back and see the error of MY ways. His actions should have had consequences. I should have set boundaries. Instead, I tried to fix him and I tried to put out his firey rages. My focus was on him. By tolerating this behavior, I enabled him to continue having these outbursts. I always said my boundaries were 1) cheating, 2) physical abuse. I should have cut ties with him after the first outburst. It saddens me that my self esteem was not high enough to live independent of him.   You mentioned she knows how to cut deep with her words, so does my SO. He is so callous, he could make a grown man cry. This is verbal abuse and should have consequences just as should cheating and physical abuse. I've struggled with an eating disorder most of my life so it's taken me a long time to build myself up, in some sense, I think he's made me a much strong human being. Usually his words strike a nerve with me but now and then he slips up and says something that just makes no sense and I realize he's just grasping at straws. I'm white and he once called me the N word....   To sum it up, I wish I'd learned to exhibit consequences for his actions early on instead of now, 5 years in. Now that he seems to be truly trying for the first time in years, I question whether I still want to be in a relationship with him. The fiercely loyal part of me wants to give him a chance now, knowing what I know. The wuss in me hopes he'll fuck it up so I can say goodbye with finality.   My advice is not to count on her changing but rather, to change yourself. Read about codependency, read about boundaries, read about BPD, and then make your own decisions on how to proceed in your relationship. Don't waste another moment putting up with her outbursts. Learn ways to remove yourself when that switch is flipped. Learn to place the outcome of such outbursts back on the culprit. Codependency is like being an innocent bystander and taking the blame for a bank robber. Learn how to stop enabling her and at that point, fate will determine whether she's capable of change or betterment."

BPDlovedones,3dzoxf,toodleoo57,4,Tue Jul 21 21:15:48 2015 UTC,"My BBDSO is not in treatment,  but I have made great strides in how I react and allow his behavior to effect me. So,  that's better.  He goes for longer periods and his rage explosions have come down a few notches. However,  while I am able to be consistent with my behavior of setting boundaries, removing myself from his presence when he starts getting emotionally abusive and giving consequences,  there are still the occasional full tilt rage episodes that I get blindsided by. Our home and life's are completely disrupted and I usually stay away for a couple of nights, putting a strain on family members.  Out of the 3 or 4 BPD's I know,  None of them have got proper treatment and at best stay stable enough to hold a job and tenuous,  strained relationships. Except for one actually,  my cousin.  She died in the spring from long term health issues related to substance abuse."
BPDlovedones,3dzoxf,mrsmanicotti,4,Tue Jul 21 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"just need someone to tell me that there's a chance she'll get better and that the rages will stop and that we can all find some peace. Is that actually possible? Can she get better? Or is this abuse the new normal?   You can't hang on only hope she will get better. That is a sign of a codependent relationship and in the end it prevents them from getting better.  All you can do is have strong boundaries, be firm about what you will tolerate, and take concrete actions to make her face consequences. You have to figure out how to stop the abuse. You can't count on her doing it on your own. It is very hard to do, and often means distancing yourself more. She will hate it. She might get angrier at you. But this is all because facing this stuff is what she really really needs.  Have you read the book from the sidebar?"
BPDlovedones,3dzoxf,cookieredittor,2,Tue Jul 21 08:25:50 2015 UTC,"I have. I've read all of the books. She lives in another state, so our relationship is phone-only which is helpful in terms of boundary setting.  I already don't respond or pay attention to her rages, which are usually done via text or e-mail. I don't offer positive reinforcement when she's raging.   I do speak to her again when she's cogent, which is usually next day. But the rages themselves are still difficult to bear.  A lot of the comments here say that the only thing that will make her better is distancing myself from the abuse, but I very much believe that if I distance myself entirely, she will kill herself. That's not something she threatens or anything, I just believe that she would simply do it at this stage if she was totally alone.  I'm not sure I could live with myself if that happened."
BPDlovedones,3dzoxf,Mephodine,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:03 2015 UTC,"I have a BPDsister as well and it's very difficult to deal with the abuse. My sister would fly off the handle without provocation; she would break my things, steal things, threaten to assault me, conduct smear campaigns online to anyone who would listen... All within the span of hours and without me even being in any contact with her. The quickest this chain of chaos has happened is the span of 6 hours.  BPD is a very tragic issue and I understand you don't want to leave your sister. Mine would make threats at the drop of a hat - she's hungry, a bill is due, there's a test coming up. You name it, she's threatened suicide over it and has been in the hospital 4+ times in the span of 6 months.  All that being said, only she has control over what she does. You will not make her do anything. If you could, you'd likely make her seek help/treatment. You, me, everyone else here with a BPD person in their lives is not responsible for the BPD's actions - they are. Boundaries are for protecting yourself. Please take care, okay? You are valuable - your feelings are valid.   Just don't try to take responsibility for someone else's actions, BPD relative or no. This isn't your fault."

That's not something she threatens or anything, I just believe that she would simply do it at this stage if she was totally alone.   We all understand this feeling here. This is part of the emotional blackmail they do to us. Your sister is 100% responsible for hurting herself. You have no control over this. Yet, she has made you believe emotionally that if you don't enable her disorder, then you are responsible for her choices.  If she is going to get better, you need to take measures to uncouple this. This is hard stuff, not as easy as everyone says. I understand your fears of NC very well.   Here is what helped me to stop enabling: I went to therapy for myself. There i become stronger to stop most of the abuse, and use a technique known as ""medium chill"". And that helped a lot diminish a lot of the bad dynamics. This is hard stuff. But the best part is that therapy for me helped me become stronger and not feel manipulated to enable her. I've learned a lot of ways to act to minimize the impact of her rages, and also, to not let them get to me as much. It isn't perfect, it is hard stuff, but therapy is what helped me."

BPDlovedones,3duq6w,internetl0ser,4,Sun Jul 19 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is your fault for allowing him to treat you like you're less than human. It's because you believe that you don't deserve to be treated like a human being with needs, wants, and loves. That's what being codependent means. You think you deserve less than the people around you, including being told that it's not your fault, even though there's nothing you could have done to prevent it. Chances are, if right now you were in the same situation, you would have chosen the same thing all over again. That's because you have to change the way your brain thinks. You have to stay in therapy, and yes, even the therapists that ""baby"" you because you think they should be telling you that you're an awful weak person for letting this happen to you. That's not babying. That's reality. A reality you choose not to accept for yourself because your brain is telling you that you don't deserve it.  You deserve to be selfish. You deserve to not give a shit about anyone else. You deserve to tell this pos wannabe boyfriend that he's the one that's less of a human being and to go fuck himself and never contact you again. You deserve to take your ass to the courthouse and file a restraining order against him.   I know you recognize this as truth. I know you've thought about it, but you will always dismiss it because deep down, you're still taking the blame for everything that's gone wrong to the people around you.   This is why people with BPD and codependents are so drawn to each other. BPDs blame everyone around them and codependents are more than willing to take the blame. It's a match made in hell.   Do yourself a favor and block this guy's phone number, email, and every social media account. Don't even give him the chance to contact you again because chances are, you won't be able to resist getting back together with him."

You cannot control him or whether he will improve over time. He is outside of your control. The only thing you CAN control is you. Start taking steps toward a healthy future by making decisions for yourself and not for the future of the relationship.   I challenge you to spend the next 2 weeks reading at least one self help book to refocus your energy. What is irking you the most right now? Perhaps pick a book on codependency or maybe you're having trouble coping with panic or anxiety. He'll surely come to mind as you work through some of your issues but the focus must be on you.   Put the relationship in a box and place it aside. Learn strategies to help you stop obsessing over it. When you revisit that box two weeks from now, you may feel entirely different about wanting any kind of future with him.

You grow up. Maybe your current therapist is working on getting you to see that you are still the wounded child who was innocent and who had no control.

BPDlovedones,3djg2l,always_awake9,2,Thu Jul 16 19:32:09 2015 UTC,"I don't really have great boundary suggestions to quelch this.  I do want to offer my own support, relation, and understanding.  First off, I truly believe as the mother who is the primary caretaker, you have an inordinate amount of influence to keep your son from 'inheriting' BPD.  Everything I've read says it is typically 'from' the mother that the children gain the attachment disorder of BPD.  I don't think it is even just about who is the caretaker.  I believe babies-toddlers (especially then, but honestly their whole life) naturally have a different kind of bond to their mother.    My wife is the one with 'strong BPD traits' according to her therapist (he diagnosed her C-PTSD with 'strong BPD traits', but she knows I suspected BPD- that bothers her and the therapist knows that bothers her..).  Anyway, I believe I 'see' a large part of what 'creates' BPD in a mother's child.  My wife honestly will sometimes 'make' my son 'earn' her love.  If she isn't in the emotional mood to be loving and caretaking, she ignores him for long periods of time.  She won't give him attention or affection.  Sometimes he'll then cry, but instead of soothing him I hear her yelling at him in Spanish.  I work from home and she doesn't work, so I'm around to do everything I can to give my son unconditional love and attention.  I run into issues because even though we caretake him about 70%-30% or thereabouts... she's his mom.  Babies, and toddlers (he's one now) have a very different relationship with their mother, especially when still breastfeeding as he is.  Sometimes when I go in to get him when she isn't in the emotional frame to do so, he won't be consoled by me because he really wants his mother.  I almost feel like this is accentuated because he seems to desire acquiring and even work extra hard to 'get' her love from her 'earned' behavior.  I truly believe this unpredictable level of support he gets, along with being forced to 'earn' her love/attention or else be neglected, is the genesis or at least at the heart of how young children 'get' BPD as it is an attachment disorder in part.    What can I do to protect him?  Only my best.  I can only give him my support, love, and attention.  I DO take actions and point out the very unacceptable behavior of hers when it is flagrantly occurring, then I will simply take him from her care at that time.  He and I have a good relationship, but I'm not his mother.  This does scare me, but I truly think you are in a better position.  About your husband repeating what occurred to him.  I relate to that.  My wife is always thinking laundry lists of things are 'wrong' with my son.  Not psychological, but medical/physical.  She is certain he has a bad underbite, messed up ankles/feet.. She honestly looks at most of my chronic medical issues and believes he has them (as he has gotten older, it seems he may actually have some of it).  I can, however, relate to your SO believing things are always 'wrong' with your child.    What can I do about this?  Well, I treat him as a healthy boy.  I am careful to get him good medical care when needed, I research and try to stay educated on all her fears and I talk about them with her.  As he gets older I will still be here to assure him that he is healthy and just fine, or to help and support him getting help for things when needed.  Either way, he will know I accept him, that he is okay, and that I am here for him to help him through any challenge that arises.  With my wife, when he is older I will be very clear about what things we talk to him about or let him overhear.  This is an issue not just in our criticism or fears for his health or things 'wrong', but about a lot of things (like when she is dysregulating or splitting me).  I'll have to control certain engagements as I do now.  I'll have to end certain conversations and pick them up when he isn't around.  Validate her concerns, but share the truth from an educated perspective about her fears.  In totality though, the most useful thing will be me accepting, supporting, and reassuring my son about any fears that are transposed onto him.  I truly think talking to your therapist is your most beneficial move.  From there, there may be ways you can imagine to create healthier boundaries / actions you can take to protect your son.  I DO really believe that your husband having misplaced fears will NOT 'make' your son BPD, I believe as the mother he is better off and the most positive action you can take is to continue not neglecting him, continue accepting, loving, and supporting him.  The fact that he clings to you in what is this healthy and normal way inspires faith in me that he IS much stronger leveraged to being healthy by YOUR input rather than your husbands.  If it was your husband he 'clinged' to, then I would have more worry his misplaced fears could lead your son astray.  I wish you and your family the absolute best and I do NOT believe it is out of your reach or on a different path than you are already on!"
BPDlovedones,3djg2l,Shanguerrilla,2,Thu Jul 16 20:52:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this.  You're absolutely right, the fact that I already have such a strong bond with my son can hopefully negate any possible effects from my SO's BPD.  I guess I was just caught off guard that he would exhibit this particular behavior since it was one of the most traumatic experiences of his life.

It is about to get harder, but also, I have reason to think I will get a good resolution that is good for son. I've done everything by the book, documented her stuff, and the important government agencies that have witnessed my reasonableness and her unreasonableness. She is doing chaotic stupid stuff that is eroding her position. Now legal stuff will happen, and I'm in a very strong position for this. BPDs sabotage themselves in these situations, due to their emotional logic. All I've done has been to do all reasonable options the government agencies told me to try, and she keeps blocking them, in the process, making herself look bad in their eyes. So I have the key government agencies as witnesses on my side.  I'm tired, very tired. But I feel strong. I know I tried everything, everything, and the last stuff is legal, tough, but it is the only way forward at this point. I know I just have to keep going for son."
BPDlovedones,3dhipp,Shanguerrilla,5,Thu Jul 16 11:46:06 2015 UTC,You're a real trooper! I know all of us here are rooting for you. Your son is lucky to have a dad like you. Keeping my fingers crossed for you and hoping for the best!
BPDlovedones,3dhipp,cookieredittor,4,Thu Jul 16 12:04:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all your support. It has helped me lot, especially during the times i felt more insecure and confused. Sometimes just reading that i need to keep going, that i'm doing the right thing, helps me shake off the insecurities. Also, the book titled ""Splitting"" is freaking amazing, predicted a lot of stuff she has done, and helped me prepared legally for it all. Because of this, instead of letting her chaos debilitate my position, i've been able to reflect it back so she is suffering the consequences of her stupid actions.  I know I've done everything. Everything. For her and for son. She isn't cooperating, and is ruining her own options in a very stupid way. I know too much about BPD now, so I know that she will blame me for al this. There is no point of me worrying about what she thinks of me. So now I'm focusing solely on son.  This process will last many months, at least. There is so much uncertainty it is hard to plan stuff. That is the most frustrating part."

BPDlovedones,3dhipp,Shanguerrilla,2,Thu Jul 16 21:03:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks friend.   The most confusing part is how she keeps being very unreasonable about some things, then is super reasonable about other things, and back and forth. Right now she is being nice and communicating well about some stuff, but ignored all the other important stuff. I wish she would just cooperate with the important stuff. But i can't act hoping for that only. So in a bit, i go see the lawyers."
BPDlovedones,3dhipp,way2manycooks,2,Fri Jul 17 08:26:53 2015 UTC,Congratulations! You're learning to trust yourself and respect yourself. It's an awesome transformation.  I can relate to the loneliness...when I divorced my BPD ex-wife that was one of the hardest things. Even when it was abusive and chaotic she was at least another person there. Be patient and give it time and I know you'll form some new friendships that are healthy.
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,not_faint_of_heart,2,Thu Jul 16 14:01:47 2015 UTC,"Here's the flip side.  My ex BPD kicked me out, I had no job, the car was in both our names, I had no money, no means to support myself. I moved into an extended stay for a couple months till a family member helped me get an apartment. I'm employed now, the car is in my name, and I have not looked back.  NOTE: she had started a relationship with someone 6 months prior to this event so it was really no shock that this happened.  I was trying to figure out how to get out of it anyway, she just did it for me. So in some way I owe her that...her personality disorder was in control and insured her that she would never be alone.  You feel sorry for him which is why you won't do anything about it because you wouldn't want it done to you. Unless he's absolutely unable to get better, move on, and take care of himself you need to do something and move forward. Take care of yourself first and foremost."
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,ijustneedahug,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:07:22 2015 UTC,"Right. But you know, feeling sorry for a guy is not really what I want out of a relationship. I'm starting to understand that for myself.  I have hope for him--it's why we've gotten this far. But the basics of our relationship aren't strong enough for me to stick it out with him. I don't want to ruin his life by kicking him out, but I'm trying to save my own, you know? Not giving up on him, but on our relationship. (I mean, I can't help him anymore, either, but it's not that I think he's a bad or worthless person...I just can't do this anymore.)  He has no family to help him, and his friends are all out of state, which makes me feel guilty, but them's the breaks, I guess.  Thanks for your input!"
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,ijustneedahug,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:25:45 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.  I know everyone's situation is different but yet similar. If things were turned around and it was up to me to kick my ex out I'd have a hard time too. I wouldn't want to put someone out on the street. But what I know now is if I stayed I/we would just be enabling the whole situation and behaviors.  You're doing the right thing, taking your time, and keeping a level head and being thoughtful about this whole process. It's definitely a step in the right direction to being a better you and respecting yourself."
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,Churn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know what your financial situation is, but I'll throw this out there...  Is it possible for you to leave, get a small inexpensive place for 6 months.  Move all of your stuff that won't fit, into storage.  Then offer to pay a portion of the rent on the old place while he lives there till the lease is up.  During that time, he is responsible for fixing his situation, not you."
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,Churn,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"I could do this if I had to. It started out as my apartment, and I love it and don't want to leave, but if it is what it takes to get out,  I'll do it.  I was thinking about extended stay for him, and was looking at craig's list for roommate situations for him, but then that all feels very enable-y.  Still, thanks for the thought! I will definitely consider it as an option."
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,Churn,5,Thu Jul 16 14:45:48 2015 UTC,"Right... unfortunately ending it with a BPD is never a simple negotiation that comes to a reasonable agreement as it would with most anyone else.  Because of this, you can't have anything in your plan that depends on him to DO anything.  Each step that involves him is an opportunity for him to play victim, give excuses, and most definately start a dialogue where he blames you for the situation.  So a plan as I suggested above, is the best course, you are LEAVING him.  So leave.  You are still obligated on the existing lease to the management, so meet those obligations without taking on any obligations to your ex.  Every step of your plan needs to only rely on you, never him (even if it will cost you more, it will be worth it)."
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,Churn,3,Thu Jul 16 14:51:16 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I catch glimpses of him being reasonable, but I have to remember it's almost always a mirage.  Thanks again for your insight!"
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,RudolphRed,4,Thu Jul 16 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"I have to remember it's almost always a mirage.   This is so true.  Something that has been pointed out in these forums before is that it is far easier to attribute their rage to the disorder, but the flip-side is the disorder too.  When they are ""love bombing"" you, seeing you in the most positive light where you can do no wrong...this too is the disorder, it's not any more real, even though it is much nicer to receive than the rages."
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,Churn,2,Thu Jul 16 15:22:17 2015 UTC,"So, his BPD diagnosis is pretty new, and I'm trying to read a lot to familiarize myself...I had not yet read about love bombing. Oh my god. That is exactly what is currently happening.  A family member who knows a lot of details asks often how things are going/what my plan is, and the past couple weeks I've said ""well, I still want to leave, but the past couple weeks have been pretty good, actually. If he were always like this, things would be fun! But I have to remember that this has happened before.""  --It's totally lovebombing. I know the world is big and no one is unique, but it's just a strange feeling that papers and books have been written on exactly what I'm dealing with.  This is the upswing. I know what comes next."
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,RudolphRed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:30:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, so many of us went through the learning stage of, ""Oh my god...what I'm reading about someone else sounds so much like my SO, I'd almost believe it is them they are talking about!""  It's as if persons with BPD are clones of one another, IMO.  But more to the point, ""love bombing"" is mostly used to lure a new victim into a relationship with a BPD.  What you are experiencing right now, is going to be more accurately described as ""hoovering""  https://outofthefog.net/CommonBehaviors/Hoovering.html  After you read that, you should become familiar with F.O.G. as these are how a BPD keeps you under their control, they heavily rely on using Fear (your fear of what they might do), Obligation (your honorable sense of obligation and doing right by people.  Note: this certainly does not apply to them though.) and Guilt (your sense of feeling guilty for having hurt them and the strong desire to make good on it afterwards).  I think you having a clear understanding of Hoovering and FOG right now is very important since you are trying to leave him."

BPDlovedones,3di7kn,Churn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:44 2015 UTC,"Looks like you're in for a rough road ahead. I'm sorry that you're going through this tough time, but also wanted to congratulate you on making this hard but important decision.  What it's going to come down to is, he's going to have to figure his own stuff out. He'll likely make you feel like you're the biggest jerk in the world, but you're not. When you separate, he'll need to leave and find his own place to live. He's an adult and it is his own responsibility to take care of himself. You're not his parent or caretaker. Be prepared to get a lot of push-back on this; he'll probably try to make you feel really guilty. I'd say it's ok to give him a little bit of time to figure out where to go, but you're not going to want to be in that situation for an extended period of time at all.   An ideal situation might be: Make a plan to be out of town or staying somewhere else for a while. Then you have the conversation and give him that period of time before he needs to be out. That way, once the relationship is ended, you're not living together at any point again. Take it from me...after I decided to split, I lived in the same place as my BPD ex-wife for a few weeks, and it was even more hellish than when we were together."
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,Churn,2,Thu Jul 16 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"It's funny--I'm actually going out of town this weekend/next week and I thought I should wait until I got back, in case he does anything awful to the apartment/dog. I don't think he would, but I don't know. He shouldn't be blindsided by this, but then...there's a lot of things he ""shouldn't"" be...  We've had some talks about ending things, mostly him threatening to leave, but I do think he knows on some level that this is the best thing for me--and truly a chance for him to grow, if he takes it. HOWEVER I have never held my ground. I fully anticipate being made to feel like a jerk. At this point, I have been able to not take a lot of what he says at face value. It was ok for a while, but the more I read, the more I realize how I need to do a lot of work, myself, and I don't think I can when I've got him sucking up all my attention.  When you lived with her at the end, Did you still sleep in the same bed still? Like I said to u/churn, I could move out if I had to, but I really don't want to. I could also stay with friends for a while, but I fear some retaliation if I'm not around. (I'm not sure if I have a good reason to, or that I just don't know what makes sense anymore, really.)  Thanks for the comment!"
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,always_awake9,2,Thu Jul 16 15:44:42 2015 UTC,"We were married for 15 years (we have a son).  So yes, I was still sleeping in the same bed.  In my opinion, after years of trying different things, in the end there is only one way to stay with a BPD, and that's on their terms.  This is why a healthy relationship with them is not possible.  It's literally their way or the highway.  As for his threats to leave you in the past.  Although I don't know your specific situation or what's true, I have a guess on that one.  BPD's above all else have a massive fear of abandonment.  Abandonment is likely a common thread in his discussions of how badly he was treated by previous women (who left him) (he's the good guy/victim, etc).  When a BPD threatens to leave or challenges you to leave, it's merely a test, to see if you are going to abandon them, when you don't...they actually feel a short-term sense of safety.  It won't last though and they will have to create a new dramatic situation in order to test you again and again so they can feel safe.  They actually TRY to drive you away, so they can feel safe when you don't leave.  It's like they are thinking to themselves, ""Wow, she didn't leave me after all of that...so she must really love me unconditionally...so I'm safe with her."""
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,dinosaurs_r_awesome,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"replied to the wrong person!  It definitely seems like he is trying to make things as miserable as possible to either, 1) as you said, feel safe when I don't leave or 2) get me to leave and prove himself right ""SEE! I TOLD YOU EVERYONE LEAVES ME""Either option is exhausting. I understand why he's doing the things he's doing (as much as I can, in that he is not thinking in a logical manner) but it definitely doesn't help me want to stick it out anymore. We're in therapy alone and together, but it's been almost a year, and I feel like we're not very far form where we started, unfortunately  The FOG/hoovering thing you posted was very much on target!"
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,werewolf35,2,Thu Jul 16 16:10:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the destruction/retaliation was a big fear of mine as well, and was why I was hesitant at first to move out. In the end I was lucky and she never did anything really destructive or vengeful. I was also unclear of some of the legal stuff and and didn't want to make any big moves until I had that figured out. I stayed in the guest room though! Not in the same bed, yikes. Most of that time I went to work early and didn't come home until late, or just locked myself in the guest room. Looking back it was a mistake, but you live and learn. It was an incredibly awkward time and she would try to do all kinds of manipulative and abusive stuff the whole time (big surprise, eh?)   Staying with friends might be another good option if he refuses to move out quickly. Just document everything and keep track of anything if he starts being destructive. That'll come back all on him during legal proceedings. I'll add that it'd be really smart to meet with a lawyer or someone who can explain how it's all going to work, as that knowledge will be invaluable as you start this process."
BPDlovedones,3di7kn,1978_anon_guy,2,Thu Jul 16 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"I was really, really hoping to be able to get a dissolution vs a divorce, but that is probably me being way too optimistic. We don't own any joint property or have kids, so that is a blessing. I am a little worried because I make significantly more than he does, but I am hoping he will be reasonable.  I am talking to a friend who is a lawyer soon, but he doesn't specialize in divorce--perhaps he can recommend someone, though.  Staying with a friend makes the most sense, though I wish I didn't have to!"

It's definitely a great idea to read up on codependency.   If I'm not mistaken, Dr. Manning talks about suicidality in the latter half of the video. She also provides some really excellent strategies and examples of how best to communicate with someone with BPD when they're disregulated in her book. The lecture basically sums up a lot of the book.   I'm so sorry you're having a difficult time right now. Knowledge is power, equip yourself with understanding in order to be a better sibling and a better person.

Long term though they're doomed unless the BPD goes into treatment. In your situation, the intensity at the beginning, it's not worth the long term consequences and shit she'll put you through in the name of love OK? I'm telling you this as someone who married a BPD woman, stayed for 7 years and had two kids with her. BPDs need you to double down after every major outburst. Don't, just don't, she'll train you into co-dependency and you'll be messed up for life OK? Just let her go man... For your sake..."
BPDlovedones,3d8qf3,cookieredittor,7,Tue Jul 14 11:27:10 2015 UTC,"Great article, cookie.   How not to end a codependent relationship... Cutting the other person out of your life without warning, ultimatum, or giving them a chance to work with you first   Yesterday I gave my BPDSO an ultimatum (re: living together and marriage). It wasn't entirely planned but I realized he needed to see how committed I was to the consequences of his (in)actions. I was kind of worried at first that ultimatums are bad (mmkay) but when you consider an ultimatum as a boundary you are reinforcing, sometimes that's just the way it has to be. The results were pronounced.   We basically reached the brink of breaking up and I was surprised by how well I was able to tolerate the idea of the relationship ending. 4 years ago, at the height of my codependence, I would have been VERY uncomfortable with the idea of losing him (cue uncontrollable crying; feeling depressed or sad for no reason). Yesterday, I felt strangely empowered.  I'm giving him a chance to work with me first but I truly feel I can handle either outcome at this point. It feels amazing.    Instead, you see the other person as someone who is not very healthy in how they behave or how they treat you. Now you have to be very careful here. Because you can easily see them as the enemy. The reason that you got so messed up. The trigger for your pain. Guilty, while you’re innocent.   This is something I feel I need to be mindful of as I continue to gain knowledge and understanding of BPD and codependency. As Shari Manning often reminds us, it's important to validate someone with BPD when possible. If you are incapable of maintaining compassion for your SO, the relationship will surely crumble.    So don’t get rid of the other person just to avoid being reminded of how much they have hurt you, how vulnerable you are, and how horribly you can be hurt — for the rest of your entire life. Just work on yourself instead. Keep your relationship with you strong, and your other relationships will naturally fall into place.   I'm hoping I have ended my codependent relationship; not in the sense that we're planning to officially end the relationship right now. But in the sense that I will no longer be in a relationship in which I identify with any of the above bullet points. I will put those days behind me. I'm hopeful this is the rebirth of our relationship but damn it feels good to be  a gangsta walking towards interdependence. We'll see how things play out.   The last few weeks I've done a lot of hard work on myself, does it show? I think it does."
BPDlovedones,3d8qf3,way2manycooks,7,Tue Jul 14 13:50:25 2015 UTC,"Ultimatums are not bad if they are part of a series of boundary defenses. It is sensible to have boundary defenses that are stronger the more violations occur. And it is reasonable to get to the point of recognizing the relationship won't work with more violations.  You did the right and mature things.   it feels good to be a gangsta   Ha ha ha ha ha!  Keep going. Becoming stronger is the best for you. And if the other person decides to have a healthy relationship, they will also realize that your strength is good for all. But even if they don't recognize it, you must be strong because it is really the only way forward."

I know this feeling. I've been pleasantly surprised by the effect putting my foot down has had on the relationship. I'm starting to get things that have faded over time (affection, communication, respect). And his anger has diminished significantly. This is by far the largest hurdle. Perhaps we can salvage the relationship if he can continue to manage this. Once you get to feeling removed, it somehow feels like there's less at stake if things don't work out. So in a self-protective way, perhaps this is the kind of leverage we need in order to express ourselves honestly and cope with the outcome of breaking up (should it come to that).   I think I can attribute some of these positive changes to the distance between us right now. But I know my self-esteem wouldn't be so high  if it weren't for the fact that I've been doing so much reading as of late. I just feel so much more at ease and that I have a grasp on reality again. I realize now that right before he moved out, things had become pretty abysmal. I was living and restructuring the world around us to appease him. As things started to become more chaotic (due to the stress of moving), I found myself doing anything I could to tamper his outbursts. This was making me miserable and depressed.   I read a book on codependency by Melody Beattie and I'm reading When I Say No, I Feel Guilty, and I can't believe how differently I view the world now. I just hope this grasp on reality is here to stay. I think it will involve continued focus and a commitment (on my end) to stand by boundaries. Have you read anything by Melody Beattie?"

Were it not for our kids, I would walk out on you this moment.   you and your mother invent false histories to explain away your outburst, your tantrums.  This needs to stop.   you have a spending problem.  This needs to stop.   I will not liquidate my 401K to bail you out of your spending debt. This is not debatable.   you are never happy, no matter what I do, no matter how high you set the bar for me, even when I come through for you, you pout and give me another challenge harder than the last.  This needs to stop.   if you end up committed again and your parents take our kids and lock themselves up in their house, I will come with the police, take my kids and go to court for full custody.   if you physically attack me again, I will call the police (which I did late 2014 BTW)     I think I was already less co-dependent in 2014.  I realized that I was the one giving her one chance and one chance only back then and gave her these points for consideration.    The way she reacted was classic BPD.    Instead of acknowledging she'd wronged me and making amends, her mother and her set about casting me as a vengeful, scheming husband out to frame his mentally ill wife (her). She managed to cast herself as the victim despite of a long history of documented abuse of me and our kids.    At this point in the divorce, I have no love hate for her, only hate.    My feeling for her is no longer conflicted (hate tainted by love or love tainted by hate)  It's unanimous.  Hate.  Don't care much to explain why she does what she does.  Will use her predictable BPD behavior patterns in court against her every change I get.    I don't feel bad about it.  I feel she needs to be reigned in and her craziness limited.  If this means using her predictable behavior against her then so be it."
BPDlovedones,3d8qf3,eastcoastzen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:31:19 2015 UTC,You are just making her face consequences for her bad behavior. This is assertive. There is no reason to feel bad. Be proud of your strength.
BPDlovedones,3d8qf3,PullingTulip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:20:21 2015 UTC,"Me now:   You feel like you cannot live without the other person. As in, you’re certain you wouldn’t have any reason to go on. You’re convinced you need the other person to be happy. There’s no one person that you absolutely need in order to breathe. You feel trapped by the relationship, and that if you do something for yourself (like change or grow), you’ll be horrible for abandoning them. You feel guilty about moving on from the person, because they’d crumble up and wither away with you. You want to save the other person in some way. You’re certain that you’re the best person for the job of savior because you love and truly understand them. But the person doesn’t want saving, is resistant to your help, or acts like they care but then continually sabotages all your efforts. You tolerate mistreatment or abuse from the other person because(maybe I can cross that bit out.. this one is iffy) you love them too damn much, and you’re stronger than this, better than this. It’s a royal rationalization. You repeatedly tell yourself that if you hang on long enough, they’ll change, take your advice, see the light, and finally love you the way you deserve. And boy when that happens, it will have been worth it, because they will be gold. In the meantime though, it’s back to living hell. You feel like you can never get out of the relationship. Meaning, if you tell the other person to leave you alone, they will pester you and try to leech themself back into your life until they’ve succeeded or made life so miserable for you that it ends in a volcanic emotional eruption. You have mixed feelings about the person on a regular basis. You simultaneously love and hate them. Or you feel empowered yet disempowered by the relationship.    Shit.. still more codependent than I realize sometimes.  Great list Cookie."
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,ShadowedSpoon,6,Tue Jul 14 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"For me, once I realized that she is messed up and far beyond any ""help"" that I could have given her, and no matter what I did, the cycle of insanity would continue, it was much easier to maintain NC than in previous attempts.  15 months going strong for me.  I agree it's the saddest thing ever...they fear abandonment so much yet they pretty much make it impossible to be with them.  Unfortunately, I learned that I need to shrug my shoulders and focus on taking care of myself first...some people are just beyond reach."
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,trent_33,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"Did you ever get ""closure"", if you found you needed it?  Did she continue to try to get in touch with you?"
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,1978_anon_guy,5,Tue Jul 14 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"I never really got closure. I raged, I cried, I talked until I was out of breath. I was in therapy and figured my BPD SO out. Last weekend I took my normal new GF hiking on the same trail where my BDP ex had thrown a tantrum about 1/2 of the way through (about 1 year ago, before the separation and divorce happened).    My BPD ex refused to go forward, I had to cut the hike short and go back to the car on her account.  Ruined weekend, was sooo looking forward to sharing the beautiful scenery on the 2nd half of the trail with her for such a long time. Had it all planned weeks in advance. With a BPD SO nothing is as you plan. She not only had the tantrum there on the trail. The tantrum continued in the car ride home, that evening in the house, her NPD mom heard about it the next day and I had to hear about it from both of them for days later. Oh God, the damage those two did to my psyche. They were sooo full of energy, never let up on me. That's how everything was when I was married to the BPD. Everything I did with the best of intentions was fucking twisted around and made out to be me being negligent or inconsiderate. I don't really have closure. I've got hate at this point.  Lots of it.  May my BPD ex and her mother die in a fire!    Back to last weekend me and my non-BPD normal gf. We went the whole way, me and my gf.  Not a comment from her. She and I hiked the full trail! We got to see glorious ocean views! We kissed there on top.  It was just as I had planned! It was amazing! It's fucking night and day... being with someone normal. Oh God, even if my gf were to break up with me tomorrow, I made an important leap forward last weekend. Life, it doesn't have to be misery for me!"
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,RakeRocter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, that hike cut short by a rage meltdown reminds me of many outings I had with my SO that were ruined for no reason. Painful times. I hope the damage isn't permanent."
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,1978_anon_guy,2,Wed Jul 15 14:47:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not one to sit around and mope about shit my BPD ex did. I don't dwell on it. I do have ""moments"" like the hike this past weekend when I'm reminded just how twisted it was being with my BPD ex. Truth is I should have had 0 tolerance when I met her. Problem is that she had none of the symptoms she developed after 7 years in the relationship, 2 kids and 100 lbs weight gain and multiple manic episodes during that time (she's bipolar and under-medicated for that).    Her BPD got the best of the relationship and me. Really not a survivable situation for me. The damage, I don't know about since the scars are all deep down in my psyche and normally I'm a cheerful person on the outside. I think the hate I've got for her is good for me. 0 tolerance and all. It shows that she hasn't managed to make me dead inside. Strong feeling is better than numbness or no feeling at all. It's the beginning part of the grieving process. I think I'm past denial and I've moved into hate. That will eventually give way to guilt, sadness and finally acceptance.    It was, after all, a 7 year marriage so it'll take some time to get to a point where I can say she's marginal to my thoughts."
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,cookieredittor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:08:49 2015 UTC,You have been through hell. Real honest hell. And you survived hell and came out. You are a very strong person. I'm glad you are finding happiness after hell.
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,mrsmanicotti,6,Thu Jul 16 12:45:00 2015 UTC,"While it is sad, it is also hopeful.  Staying with a BPD and allowing them to treat you badly is just keeping them sick. By setting your NC boundaries you are teaching them instead of condemning them to a life of infantile emotions that will continue bring them pain, you are actually acting on the belief that they can grow and learn if they are motivated. So it's sad that the motivation had to come in this form, but it's good that you have given them the opportunity to evolve beyond what doesn't work. The next steps are up to your ex, and hopefully your ex will be forced to seek help in understanding herself and learn to use the tools available. Regarding closure,  it is not a stone that drops on you. It's a fluid thing that comes and goes and over time you'll just feel acceptance."
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,furball42,2,Wed Jul 15 03:35:19 2015 UTC,"Omg, every month of my NC I realize how crazy I was for even staying with my BPD.   The 'closer' I received was wondering how I could have shared a house with someone who threatened to kill themselves when I asked them to do dishes, told me I didn't deserve anything when I got a raise and would tell friends I beat them after she would hit me (and I didn't hit back!)  Your closer will be sanity and serenity slowly oozing back into your life like a warm fuzzy feeling :)"
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,RudolphRed,2,Tue Jul 14 20:08:56 2015 UTC,Totally agree with this. And take it from someone who spent a good while still communicating with my BPD ex...there was no closure even then. She'd jump back and forth between telling me she wanted to get back together and trying to start fights. Every time I talked to her it basically felt emotionally like I was back at square one. You'll do better to stay NC and focus on how much your life is improving.
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,bdpgirlfriend,3,Wed Jul 15 03:29:00 2015 UTC,You'll feel better in time. I know nobody wants to hear that and it sounds cold but it's true.
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,ijustneedahug,2,Wed Jul 15 03:52:06 2015 UTC,"I wondered and asked the same thing. Last thing you want, or need, to do is break no contact just to get closure. If you do it will never be over and you'll just be prolonging the agony of wanting closure.  I got closure from a long time ago ex after a chance meeting but that was several years after we broke up. Even after that she tried to see me again. Apparently I got my closure, she didn't.  As for my recent BPD ex, I don't have true closure but at least I know I'm not with them and I'm safe.  Like the other person said just focus and work on yourself. That's the best thing you can do for yourself."
BPDlovedones,3d9rkj,RakeRocter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:24:21 2015 UTC,That first paragraph nails it.
BPDlovedones,3d1xu8,swamp_barber,7,Sun Jul 12 21:31:03 2015 UTC,"First, take a look at what you're hoping to get out of this. Closure? I had a similar situation growing up, and I kept hoping I could find the right thing to say to my mom, to get through to her. But that's the thing, that's the illness, she can't see. If she was capable of understanding you and was capable of self-awareness, we wouldn't be at this point. She doesn't have an observing ego. It's not going to happen.   I wrote a letter, but I did it for me and me alone. I didn't do it hoping she would hear me. I did it because I needed to get the thoughts out, just once, I needed to know that I expressed what I needed and what she didn't give me, and why we couldn't have a relationship anymore, fully expecting she wouldn't even be able to hear me or process it, let alone respond with clarity and regret.   Then I spent a while grieving, because I finally gave up on hoping she would change.   Things that were in my letter, paraphrased, just for ideas:  ""Your behavior is never my fault.""   ""I was a child. Children are not responsible for their parent's feelings or mistakes. You were the parent.""   ""I am not going to tolerate verbal or emotional abuse from you, starting this minute. If you act in a way that is abusive, I will end the contact and will not be in contact with you. That's not a negotiation and I'm not asking for your permission.""   ""You provided a lot of things for me as a mother. There were positives and good things occurred. That can be true simultaneously alongside the fact that you were verbally and emotionally abusive. I know you had a rough upbringing and you didn't have a model for a healthy home. I am sorry that those things happened to you, but they are not an excuse for the way you treated your children.""  ""I am not telling you this to hurt you, I am telling you this because i want to be up-front with my reasons for not contacting you. I am willing to see and speak to you, when you treat me politely. I am committed to treating you politely."""
BPDlovedones,3d1xu8,3RBN6349,2,Mon Jul 13 00:38:18 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your response! You are right that I am writing this letter for me and your suggestions for wording are great. I will definitely keep them in mind as I draft mine.   It sucks that you have also been in this situation. I am sorry for you and what you've been through and very grateful that you found something in your journey that can help me with mine.
BPDlovedones,3d1xu8,mrsmanicotti,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:44:48 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry that you were dealt this hand in life. Always remember you came into this as an innocent child and had no control in the matter.  It's highly unlikely anything you or any family member says will alter your Mother.  So what is important for you is to express how your Mothers behavior and actions have impacted your life and the feelings that you have. Let her know you feel cheated out of a healthy childhood,  that her unpredictability and rages were frightening and painful.  Tell her that it hurts that she can not see who you are and tries to make you into who she wants you to be. Next tell her that you will no longer respond to or tolerate abusive behavior.  This will not go well. She will blame everybody but herself and play a victim.  At this time, she can't help it. Family therapy isn't going to help her. But if this leads to her going into personal therapy,  things could improve in time. If possible,  get some personal therapy for yourself. Realize coming out of what you have been through has increased the chance you will get Involved in dysfunctional relationships.  You might find looking around this website helpful. https://outofthefog.net/Relationships/Unchosen.html I urge you to be kind to yourself and treat yourself well. That sounds obvious,  but after what you've been through,  you may need to put more effort into that than you may at times be aware of."
BPDlovedones,3d1xu8,mrsmanicotti,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:58:24 2015 UTC,I really appreciate your comment. You are correct that family therapy is getting nowhere. My mother is in personal therapy but she goes once a month and only talks about us kids (who knows what she talks about since she couldn't name one thing we like to do).   I am in therapy on my own and it was my therapist's idea to write this letter since I have trouble remembering what to say when I am under pressure. Everything about this letter should be for me and to help myself get closure for the nurturing mother-daughter relationship that will never happen.  Thank you again for your advice! I will look into the website as I am realizing that my last and only serious relationship was with someone who shows signs of being borderline as well.

BPDlovedones,3d0obi,3216549872648,9,Sun Jul 12 15:04:59 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as a positive relationship with a person with BPD, unless they're in treatment and they have been in treatment long enough for them to be aware of their behaviors.  Even then, someone like you would probably be the only one qualified enough to know how to handle them at their worst and not be traumatized by their actions.   My reasoning is due to the fact that a person with BPD has a dysfunctional and distorted view on what constitutes a relationship. You can't have a healthy, happy, and fulfilling relationship with someone like that. What's the point in investing love, time, and energy into someone who will most likely never return it?"
BPDlovedones,3d0obi,Cranberry_Lips,9,Sun Jul 12 20:31:59 2015 UTC,Well said!  There's no middle ground with a BPD SO.  It's the splitting.  Either you're everything to her or you're her #1 enemy.  There is no middle ground.  That's how it is.  Sorry.  She'll call you though when she'll feel extreme abandonment and decide to reconcile.  Don't.  Don't.  For your sake.  Be strong when you get that call.
BPDlovedones,3d0obi,1978_anon_guy,5,Sun Jul 12 23:41:32 2015 UTC,"This is all pretty textbook splitting, but it's unfolding in the weirdest way with her pushing me out of her life with the expectation that we'd wind up getting back to it after some time, not because of something I did.   Sadly, I think that splitting not because of something you did doesn't sounds weird at all to me.  Unrealistic expectations are pretty familiar too, as well as rapidly changing ones.   I'd be alright with moving on. I'd be better picking back up with the relationship. But right now she's giving me neither option by refusing to talk to me so we can get to either of those points;   It sounds like she indeed isn't giving you the option to pick back up with the relationship, but rather forcing (rather than prohibiting) option 1 of moving on.  My wife's desires, intimacy, priorities.. these things rapidly shift.  In fact, oftentimes and the loooongest splitting of me occurred at times she missed her family in another country.  I hadn't done anything noticeable, but she began hating me fervently, searching for reasons to leave me..  She viewed 'me' as the reason she wasn't with her family (not her own choice to be with me).  Also applicable- she broke up with me when we were beginning to get more serious / take the next step.  These women have attachment issues, it makes sense to me that some run, split, go no contact once things are getting more serious or more permanent feeling.  To me this can occur even or especially when things are otherwise very positive, that scared my wife before (luckily we don't have the problem of things being 'too' positive anymore... lol).  My wife is very spontaneous and hates plans, they feel like prison to her.  A relationship at all has seemed to draw out her pushing me away sometimes.    I'm not saying this is how things will go, I'm not saying you guys are done, but I believe that outcome is independent of your control.  I understand you want to   make things work because I don't think this has run its course yet   but to be honest things we think or desire that require participation and choice from these SO's don't always get fulfilled."
BPDlovedones,3d0obi,Shanguerrilla,5,Sun Jul 12 17:48:16 2015 UTC,"You didnt expect much so why not let it fizzle out? Move on, sure be there if she reaches out...if, dont waste your youth."
BPDlovedones,3d0obi,PullingTulip,4,Mon Jul 13 06:37:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry you're going through this confusing time, friend. You're hitting on one of the more frustrating aspects of dealing with someone with BPD...their behavior often makes no sense to us. They fear abandonment so they attack the ones they love in an attempt to preemptively take control of the situation. They base reality off of they way they feel. It's hard and often impossible to understand.  My advice would be let her go. If she doesn't want to be in contact then you need to respect that. I'd consider the relationship ended. If you feel the need, maybe send her a letter or something saying that it's over, no hard feelings, but you wanted to clarify that with her, etc."

BPDlovedones,3d0obi,cookieredittor,4,Mon Jul 13 21:43:12 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I've been doing and how I've been acting. Never really have been needy at all. I've never had it be unresolved like this and it's killer to not let it spill out.
BPDlovedones,3d0obi,FileUserError,3,Tue Jul 14 04:05:20 2015 UTC,"it's killer to not let it spill out.   That is common with BPDs. It ends either in chaos, or confusion, never in an adult way."

But that IS splitting. My wife splits on me not because of stuff i really do. Sometimes she did because of stuff she thought I thought of her because of what she was going through. She had the flu and I made her soup? It must be that i secretly despise her for being weak. Of course, she wouldn't say it like that. Other times she would do it because of stuff not even related to us at all.   This is why it is so confusing. This is why it is a PD. Logic and reason don't explain it.   I feel like it would only take an hour or two to sort out   This would be so if she didn't have a PD. But she has a PD. Think about this, you know psychology. Can you make a paranoid schizophrenic stop being afraid of alien nazis trying to conquer the bathroom by talking to them for a couple of hours? Of course not. If you could, they wouldn't have a PD. They would just be misguided. Similarly, you can not make someone with BPD stop splitting by just talking to them. If you could, they wouldn't have a PD, they would just be confused. Sometimes when you get to have this talk you crave, they twist it and twist it as evidence of their irrational fears."
BPDlovedones,3d0obi,FileUserError,2,Tue Jul 14 15:08:49 2015 UTC,"I guess what I mean is just that, in the past, I've never had it drag out for this long. It's always been explosions and fireworks and then over with. Even with the psychology background, this isn't something I was prepared for. PDs are woefully understudied.   The ""hour or two"" comment - I guess that's rooted in how I knew her before this. Before this happened, I'd known her for long enough without any major or obvious disturbances that I was actually beginning to doubt her diagnosis. I'm well aware that I can't do anything to fix the splitting issue, but I'm still kind of wrapping my mind around this very new 'her.' It'll be interesting when I do get to have a talk with her."

If you want her back is this relationship going to still be good knowing you can be tossed aside so easily and for no good reason? Stay strong and let her drift away as a memory."
BPDlovedones,3d0obi,mrsmanicotti,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:58:01 2015 UTC,"This sounds like it could happen in any relationship and while you would like to attribute it to BPD, it's the same story I've heard many times. You can rack your brain's as if there is some solution you can implement to control her. But it's seems quite likely she just isn't as into you as you think. It's not unique to BPD. You are on the verge of stalking.  Accept the reality and drop the magical thinking."
BPDlovedones,3cvq08,dabsaretoomuch,3,Sat Jul 11 04:19:36 2015 UTC,"Don't be an audience member for their rages. Ignore them. Leave the room. Act emotionless like Mr. Spock. Present yourself as an emotional zero. Try to break down why they're upset into the simplest terms so they process it rather than just reacting to the raw emotion of it. ""So you're mad I didn't have a chance to do the dishes yet? I'll do them right now.""  Speaking of Mr. Spock, BPDs are like the creature from Star Trek that fed on negative emotion. Just don't give them any anger or they just grow stronger and stronger."
BPDlovedones,3cvq08,bdpgirlfriend,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:41:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I have no problems dealing with it personally. My mother is staying with another member of my family, and the issue is the rage she directs at the children. Currently their parents leave the house with them if that is occurring. But they aren't always there to protect them. So we have to take some sort of action to make that stop while she is is staying there."
BPDlovedones,3cvq08,avro_lanc,5,Sat Jul 11 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"I think that they only way to realistically deal with it is to not acknowledge it- let her know that you will absolutely not tolerate her flying into rages, and walk out of the room/remove any children from the house if she does. The only reason that anybody chooses any behaviour is because it works for them in some way, until it doesn't. A consistent non-response to her rages may eventually teach her that this won't work for her anymore.  Does your mother rage when she is by herself, even after a long day? There are a few stories on this subreddit that are similar to yours, and a lot of non-BPDs have noticed that when the BPD either is or thinks they're by themselves, they don't behave this way at all, and instead find healthier/productive ways to destress without flying into rages."
BPDlovedones,3cvq08,1978_anon_guy,2,Sat Jul 11 04:54:41 2015 UTC,"It has to be acknowledged because the younger members of the family do not have the ability to walk away. She will stay on them and pound on the doors to their rooms and things like that. So it has to be directly stopped, one way or another.   I don't know if she rages by herself as I am not there. Once she is alone after building up rage it burns out after a while. Usually there is a loud display of banging and crashing as she makes her anger known through putting away dishes and such. If a friend of hers calls on the phone her mood flips like a switch and she is bright and happy, and will stay that way after the phone call ends. If I had to guess I would say she doesn't rage alone. She needs targets to sustain her anger.  Thank you for your reply"
BPDlovedones,3cvq08,aliceinborderland,2,Sat Jul 11 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"I'd go on a long walk when my BPD ex raged. I'd calmly open the door and go to the park or walk around my suburb. Just took myself out of that situation and walked away. It's never a good idea to engage a raging BPD. It's never a good idea to restrain a raging BPD. It's never a good idea to react to a raging BPD. Just move away if you can. If she's your legal guardian / parent seek legal emancipation. If she and your father are divorced (as is the case with 90% of BPD women), talk to your father about this, ask to stay with him. Look she's obviously unloading on you. You can also record her rages by leaving your smartphone camera on in a hidden location when the rages happen. You can take that recording the CPS.  Not sure if that's a good idea though since you may end up a ward of the state if none of your immediate family will take you. These rages, I know all about them. They're the product of a BPD externalizing her inner hell. Probably the best course of action is to record her rages and send the recording to other family members who can come in and take you to live with them."
BPDlovedones,3cvq08,cookieredittor,6,Mon Jul 13 07:55:24 2015 UTC,"""We need to put a stop to it..."", No. Only she can control/change her behavior.  If this behavior is psychologically hurting a child, then it is abusive.  You need to protect the child, not try to change her.  Seek professional advise, I would not recommend confrontation."
BPDlovedones,3cv5s8,BananasMom,7,Sat Jul 11 01:08:08 2015 UTC,"Someone once told me that the only appropriate time to feel guilt is when you have done something to intentionally hurt another.  She wants you to feel guilty because emotional manipulation is a BPD's way of targeting the good person inside of you that doesn't want her to suffer- she is using your good conscience to her advantage.  A mantra that has helped me infinitely in situations in which I was guilt tripped was, ""I am okay with making other people uncomfortable.""   I have had to say this several times to myself over and over to just not call my mom back.  You are okay with making your aunt uncomfortable, because it is not your responsibility to baby her emotions, to find her a job, to maintain a relationship with this type of inappropriate role reversal where you are the parent and she is the child.   You are only helping her because you care for her, not because you are bound by some unbreakable contract.  You have to take care of yourself first, you cannot let yourself collapse under the weight of taking care of her emotional state.  I know that it seems like it is all your fault, but whether she is broken or not, it is her responsibility to care for herself.  If she is threatening to kill herself, call the police.  And go through with it.  And please, please, don't let this person let you consider hurting yourself, all of us here on the sub are here for you!  hugs"
BPDlovedones,3cv5s8,leolexie,3,Sat Jul 11 05:51:55 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh, I told you that! I was just about to repost that same mantra :o)  I am so happy that you are continuing to heal and find peace with your situation. I hope this is exactly what /u/BananasMom needs to hear."
BPDlovedones,3cv5s8,avro_lanc,3,Sat Jul 11 07:08:17 2015 UTC,"Firstly, you have not missed your opportunity to go back to school. In fact, the person you are today is probably way better prepared for college than you would have been at age 18. I can tell from reading your post you're a smart person and you will find a way to achieve this goal. A lot of people place too much emphasis on getting that college degree right out of high school and it just doesn't have to be that way.   Reading you post, I can tell you are very, severely codependent. The best way to free yourself from the hell you're living in right now is to gain knowledge. I really believe that being informed empowers you. For that reason, I really encourage you to read Stop Walking on Eggshells as soon as possible.   You seem focused on the idea of NC, which is frequently discussed in /r/raisedbynarcissists. However, maybe you aren't ready to take that step just yet. And there's nothing wrong with easing into the decision making process. Compartmentalize your problems and work on them one at a time as you gain knowledge from reading about BPD and codependency.   Another really great book that you should check out as soon as possible is Codependent No More by Melody Beattie. It occurred to me today as I was walking down the street that in learning how to deal with codependence, I've learned, for the first time in my life, exactly how to go about loving myself. I'm not afraid to say I needed written instructions to help bring about this change. And like Rupaul always says, if you can't love yourself, how the hell are you gonna love someone else? This is where I think you need to start. Maybe along the way you'll discover that going NC it the right decision. But take a breath and take things one day at a time.   Lastly (for now) you talk about feeling guilty. Guilt is often used to control and manipulate us. It never tends to benefit the one who feels guilty. Our parents and society uses guilt to mold the behavior they want to see in us. It's often used manipulatively, whether or not that's always the overt intention.   When you learn to stop quieting your true feelings or thoughts and start listening to your gut, it may feel uncomfortable at first. However, over time, you'll feel much more at ease and in control of your life--and much less guilty. Being selfish is sometimes an important protective measure we must take. You likely view NC as uncomfortable feeling because you're not at peace with yourself right now. Focus on you. Whether or not you realize it, that's the only thing you have any control over.   Best wishes and please PM me if you need a friend."

BPDlovedones,3cv5s8,Cranberry_Lips,2,Sat Jul 11 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"Here's something you can do, it will be very difficult but could help your situation with as little guilt as possible.  Save up your money, as much as possible. Like, eat Ramen noodles, walk instead of drive, cut your cable service, don't go out, whatever. Save enough for first month, last month, and deposit for a super cheap 1 room place for HER, the cheapest you can find. Move her in, pay the landlord, and leave. Tell her you will be in touch to visit but she is on her own now. Worst case scenerio is she pays the landlord nothing else and they start eviction but she has three month's paid so that is a great start for her. She HAS to try on her own. This CANNOT be on you anymore. Three month's rent is very generous and you would have nothing to feel guilty about."

BPDlovedones,3crlnz,looking4helpBPD,8,Fri Jul 10 05:22:17 2015 UTC,"As this has happend to me with my ex, i will help you to make it very simple:   Ask her for proof. A paper from a doctor who confirms the pregnancy, with HER NAME ON IT. If she starts to make you feel guilty and can't provide this, FORGET HER AND IGNORE HER.  You say she is three month pregnant. That's 12 weeks. At this stage the pregnancy is visible (small belly, bigger breasts, etc.), does she show physical signs like that?   My ex did it. Lied, then refused to go to a doctor with me, and when i finally pushed her and she couldn't say no anymore... Doc confirmed she's not pregnant... She begann to say it was a misscariage and how she had cramps and was bleeding for a month.  She also claimed she visited a doctor in the beginning who confirmed the pregnancy. When i asked to see a paper confirming this, she made me look like a monster for not trusting her.  She used this lie after begging me to take her back without success. She said she is pregnant and will deal with it alone, a last resort to make me feel guilty and oblige.  Again, it's VERY simple:   Ask her for proof from a doctor. If she doesn't want to go with you, ask for a signed official paper from the doctor which confirms the pregnancy and has her full name and details on it. If she starts to get defensive and make you feel guilty for asking for this... Go no contact and ignore any further contact attempts.   This is a situation where trust and blindly believing her is not enough. Let her provide proof. If it's true she will quickly provide that and don't be defensive about it. If it's a lie she will not be able to, she will get defensive and also try the trick with ""abortion without you being there"" or the classic misscariage.  Don't let her fool you!!!"
BPDlovedones,3crlnz,Tanglible_Dream,2,Fri Jul 10 09:56:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you, very insightful. I was hoping someone on here had been through something similar. As I said in another comment, She has since told me not to take care and that she'll deal with it on her own since ''I've never been there for her before"" and ''why should I start caring now?"" type things.  I havent noticed any physical changes on here, but I haven't seen her in over a week. She texted me after she first said she was pregnant and said ""my boobs are huge"" or something similar. She begged to see me on saturday and now out of nowhere doesn't want to see me and says she's going to go by herself monday to the doctor."
BPDlovedones,3crlnz,Tanglible_Dream,3,Fri Jul 10 10:35:29 2015 UTC,"My ex started by saying she will have an abortion and she will go there by herself and that once it's over we should never talk about it again. When i objected to that and wanted her to come with me to a doctor, she made a huge drama how she would go with a friend instead because she would be ashamed. Then when i didn't oblige and she finally went with me, it changed to the miscarriage story.  Until the end she kept up the lie. I felt extremely guilty, because i constantly doubted my own gut feeling that told me she lied.  She is a nurse, she does charity work, she's a saint on the surface. It was hard to believe she lied about it.  I only found out in the end because i created an email account under her name, then sent an email to the doctor she told me confirmed the pregnancy. I told the doctor in the email i would be her (full name and birthdate), and if they could please send me a copy of the invoice of my visit there, i'd need it for a tax report. The doctor replied if it would be possible that i've visited another doctor, as they would have no record under the name, nor birthdate.  Ask her for proof, if it's not a lie, she will happily provide it. Sorry, but to me it's pretty clear she's lying to you the way she responds to you.  I hope you keep your head straight and come out of this well... I know for me it was very difficult and basically put me in deep depression for over a year (until i had the idea with the email and got the ugly truth... Until then it was self doubt and basically hell)."
BPDlovedones,3crlnz,cookieredittor,7,Fri Jul 10 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"""you're only staying with me to make sure that i have the abortion, then you're just going to leave me again"".    This is emotional black mail.   This makes me think she is worried because she know's she is lying. I dont know what to really make of all of it.   If I were you, instead of making a fuss about if it is real or not, just make an appointment to the doctor with her to check. Not to the clinic, to an OB-GYN doctor.  Just say that since she is worried about being pregnant (don't say she keeps changing her story), you want to do the responsible thing to make sure she gets checked, for her own health.  Don't call her on her lie. Just with a lot of support, make her face her own lie, and see what happens. That way even if she refuses to go, and she makes a story of getting an abortion by herself and talks badly about you, you can say with truth that you wanted her to go to an Ob-Gyn just to get checked and confirm the pregnancy, and she refused.   Is this a common thing with BPD?   When BPDs fear abandonment, they will do anything possible to prevent it. Lying is part of this.   You might have to consider if you want to be in a relationship with someone you can't trust to plan your life with."
BPDlovedones,3crlnz,cookieredittor,2,Fri Jul 10 08:50:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I definitely do not want to stay in this relationship. I ended it today, which is when this whole thing first came up. So I am leaving, just obviously need to know whats going on with this situation first.  She has since texted me saying that I dont need to take her, that she is going to go and take care of it on her own. I told her 3 times after that, that I want to go with her and I'll take her and she keeps dodging it by saying ""You've never done anything for me before, why should you start now?"" and things to that nature. But still insisting I pay, which I will absolutely not do if she gives me no evidence that its true."
BPDlovedones,3crlnz,cookieredittor,5,Fri Jul 10 10:30:03 2015 UTC,"Say you will pay if when she brings evidence of being pregnant from a doctor.   Keep the text message exchange for evidence.

BPDlovedones,3crlnz,dinosaurs_r_awesome,2,Fri Jul 10 10:40:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I have still given her no indication that I dont believe her. I just explained calmly and maturely that we are not prepared for something like that, etc.  She kept trying take change the subject when I would say those things. I would tell her this is very serious and needs to be taken seriously and as a higher priority than whatever happens between her and I.   She would immediately raise her voice and say ""I'm going to take care of it! We need to talk about US!"" , Id say "" No we need to figure this out first and foremost then we can worry about what happens with us"" and that cycle lasted about 10 minutes. Then for the rest of the hour long conversation she never brought up the pregnancy again. We got off the phone.  She texted me a few hours later saying basically that she feels so sick about this whole thing, she's going to go take care of the pregnancy and doctor visit on her own, I 'dont want to help her anyway', and that I need to start telling her things to make her feel better (LOL)."

She keeps trying to play emotional black mail on one side with Guilt, and then on the other ask for your support. Because of the lie she chose, by playing supportive about the pregnancy, you don't give her the superficial support she wants, and reveal her lie together.  Stay strong, this is hard stuff."
BPDlovedones,3crlnz,WeaponizeAnything,4,Fri Jul 10 11:00:10 2015 UTC,"Mine tried to play the ""I might be pregnant card"" not too long ago. With the ""my period is still late"" stuff.  I kept her negative pregnancy test result pee-stick on hand for awhile. She called me creepy for keeping it. Yeah, it's a little weird, but I kept it as bullshit-proofing. If one isn't pregnant 1.5 months in, one can't magically get pregnant by 2.5 or 3 months in (unless some other guy did it, in which case, poor fucker). Anyway, I know how impregnation works, and what's required. It was pure emotional blackmail. She's dropped it now (and I got rid of the damned pee stick)."

I don't know where you live, but in most, if not all the states in the U.S., the cut off for having an abortion is 12 weeks unless there is an underlying medical condition risking the life of the mother or child.    If she truly is as far along as she says she is (which I REALLY doubt), she may be past the point of being able to terminate."

Some perspective, OP: I'm having trouble healing because I HAVE to interact with my ex (we have kids). I wish she'd leave me alone and just focus on her life and interests, and doing right by the children! Coparenting could be possible, if her only interest wasn't obsessing about me. It sucks.  Today, for example, I'm ""a fag"" because I have a blue sports coat. Heterosexuals don't wear blue, apparently. Also she's going to sue me for ""libel"". Also she doesn't approve of my mom watching the kids while I'm at work (although yesterday apparently it was ok). Also, she's racked up $1,200 of ""reasonable medical expenses"" within a week that I'd better pay up on. Also, if I don't take our oldest to tee-ball tomorrow on my parenting time, her daddy is going to make sure that I'm sufficiently punished, because it's ""child abuse."" Also, she suspects I broke into our old house and stole her iPhone bluetooth speakers. Also, if I ""hack"" into her iPhone remotely and mess with her icons, she'll make sure that the FBI is alerted. And so on. This is within 24 hours.  And is action being taken? Not really, because the system is slow as shit: the psychologists work slow, the lawyers work slow, the courts work slow. And my attorney wants to get paid more soon, or I go pro se. In the mean time, I get a daily dose of abuse, demands, accusations, and hate every single day. Awesome.

Honestly, it gives me a lot of hope as I look to my future, currently I'm about 6 months past divorcing my BPD ex.   I've had very similar tendencies as you, to want to lurk via social media, and I've been thinking about why I want to do that as well. i think a little bit of it is just a curiosity...someone that you were very close to for a long time, and now you know nothing about their everyday life. To me that's a normal feeling...I know lots of people from all kinds of relationships who would admit to a little lurking of their exes online. I think your other ideas could be correct too...a remnant of a survival mechanism, etc. I'll add that my ex does post personal life updates all the time, and even knowing what she's up to nearly every day doesn't make me feel better. I admit as well that it'd be nice to see them crash and burn, these people that hurt us so much. It seems like they have that coming to them. But deep down I don't think that would be satisfying either...I think I'd just feel sad for her. I think a lot of it could be tied up into the codependent tendency that SOs of BPDs often have. I don't know. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, this is something I'm wrestling with too and it's good to think about it."

It's important you read more about it (in the sidebar of this sub), I'm sure you'll find a lot of things sound too familiar.   Cheating in my opinion is never an option, if you're unhappy in the relationship you should find a way to end it.  When I first discovered bpd, it was truly helpful and eye-opening to read other stories and to learn that other people have experienced the same. It will help you fight this doubt you're having.

For me, when he is ranting and raging like a lunatic,  I leave and go for a car ride. I go get a donut and coffee and sit in the park and enjoy what I am doing at the moment.  Sounds trivial but helps me. Also I make a conscious decision to not let him dump his problems in my lap. I have learned not to make any offers or suggestions when he complains about this or that. I just try to give a sympathetic look and nod as if I am listening.  Then I say something like ""Wow, that's a tough one or wow, that's really something"" Answer with out answering."

I really suggest getting therapy for yourself (I go as well).  I had those feelings too and I was lost in codependency.  I feel like these relationships try to require it of us, but being so is our own doing.  That is GOOD that means NOT feeling like that is also within our power.  Here is an excerpt you might relate to from bpdfamily.com   The Opposite of Codependency is a Well Differentiated Self According to Bowen's Family Theory, families and other social groups tremendously affect how people think, feel, and act, and individuals vary in their susceptibility to, and dependence on how others think. These differences are based on the differences in people's levels of ""differentiation of self"". The less developed a person's ""self,"" the more impact others have on his functioning and the more he tries to control, actively or passively, the functioning of others. Every human society has its well-differentiated people, poorly-differentiated people, and people at many gradations between these extremes.  The basic building blocks of a ""self"" are inborn, but an individual's family relationships during childhood and adolescence primarily determine how much ""self"" he develops. Once established, the level of ""self"" rarely changes unless a person makes a structured and long-term effort to change it.  A person with a well-differentiated ""self"" recognizes his realistic dependence on others, but he can stay calm and clear-headed enough in the face of conflict, criticism, and rejection to distinguish thinking rooted in a careful assessment of the facts from thinking clouded by emotionality. Thoughtfully acquired principles help guide decision-making about important family and social issues, making him less at the mercy of the feelings of the moment. What he decides and what he says matches what he does. He can act selflessly, but his acting in the best interests of the group is a thoughtful choice, not a response to relationship pressures. Confident in his thinking, he can either support another's view without being a disciple or reject another view without polarizing the differences. He defines himself without being pushy and deals with pressure to yield without being wishy-washy.  People with a poorly-differentiated ""self"" depend so heavily on the acceptance and approval of others that they quickly adjust what they think, say, and do to please others.  It’s normal to want to please someone you care about, but when someone has a poorly-differentiated ""self"", they usually don’t think they have a choice. Saying “No” causes anxiety and they sacrifice their own needs to accommodate other people.  This is generally where codependents get into trouble.  They have blurry boundaries. They feel responsible for other people’s feelings and problems or blame their own problems on others.   http://bpdfamily.com/content/codependency-codependent-relationships  They have tons of great resources, but I implore you to take care of yourself, fill your own needs, and get into therapy for yourself.  It helps!  When you feel healthier and happier, the right moves in this relationship will be more clear."
BPDlovedones,3cfxfw,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yes. This, and so much of it.  My own grandmother whole family, what am I talking about? does this utterly sick thing of making me Golden Child and then undermining me, apparently because I might get too big of a head if it goes on for too long. Which would be only marginally weird, if the two did not happen side-by-side. Or if I were being worshipped, that might be a legit concern, although that would still be the wrong way of doing it.   At this point, I'm also questioning myself, but luckily (bad choice of word?) it's because I have depersonalizations (dissociative rounds where I feel disconnected) and not because of anything they do. But still, questioning yourself is not fun. :( And in my teen years, which are starting to come back to me (nooo, stay in the past where you belong! DX), it was ALWAYS jail.  And one other thing: BPDs sometimes feel like they don't have an identity, and they also feel angry and full of conflict and question everything. I don't know you and I'm only suggesting it, but are you sure these feelings are coming from you? It is possible that SO's feelings aren't getting transferred to you? My grandmother tries to do that to me. It's also possible to pick up behaviors from other people- RBN calls it ""fleas"" for a reason.   Hang in there, man. And maybe reminding yourself of what your personality is like and what your goals and hopes and all are will help you feel more grounded. Wish I could help more. :(  Edited for formatting fail"

BPDlovedones,3ceni2,Soundboard_Fez,2,Tue Jul 7 10:32:04 2015 UTC,"YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID!!!!!""   My wife said something similar the day after, that she was ""angry at how i treated her"". She didn't say she was backing out, but she did say she wasn't going to be so cooperative with the language issues next time (she would refuse to talk to me in English, making communication harder). Until last night, that she said she wasn't going to mediation.  The thing was that during mediation i was very very very reasonable and looking up options, she was stubborn and closed, but with patience, and mediation, we reached an agreement. I was very nice the whole time, she just hated that she had to settle for what the law says is reasonable.   Does she have more cash on hand than you to pay lawyers?    No. We are about the same.  Also, her lawyer sounds reasonable and believes in mediation. He suggests an agreement out of court because it is cheaper and friendlier. I took that idea and ran with it by finding this free mediation from the goverment.   Her current behavior seems to go against the advice of her lawyer, unless something changed that i'm not aware of. Instead of trying to guess what kind of scheme she might be playing, i should probably just write if off as emotional logic, and stick to my plan.  It sucks anyway."

This seems to me her trying to have what most people with BPD lash out to get.... That feeling that they are in charge and in control... not you... Since they seem to struggle with not being controlled by their own emotions..   ""angry at how I treated her""  You did not allow things to go her way, you did not give in to her demand for control or view her as the person in charge. She is angry at you for not giving in to her threats and breaking like she feels she would have if the roles were reversed. She is possibly projecting her fear of being found out by being overly aggressive.   Just keep doing what you are doing, and remember it's all about your child here loving and protecting them. The steps you are taking now will eventually lead to a calm environment for the both of you to grow and make positive memories in without the instability of having to constantly deal with crazy making.

Even after I was out of her house, living by myself at a hotel, she still tried to negotiate with me to get the rest of my stuff from her house. The first time she reneged I just flat told her never mind and hung up on her. She then tried repeatedly to renegotiate but I never responded back and eventually had to block her.

The judge was not fooled by my spouse. (My spouse had fooled everyone else.)   I had taken the time to write out a VERY detailed and fair parenting plan. The judge made it our plan. The judge made my spouse read the entire plan out loud and initial each section.  Take time to write out a very detailed plan - address visitation schedule before kindergarten, after kindergarten, holidays and spring break, phone calls from parents, where to drop off/pick up, how to mediate a change to the parenting plan, etc.   I have faith your judge will not be fooled by your spouse either."
BPDlovedones,3ceni2,mrsmanicotti,2,Wed Jul 8 13:32:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I will develop further such a plan with my lawyers and the person from Child Services (they also help with this). My main goal is to do all this in connection with Child Service as much as possible because if we go to court, here, the court always asks Child Services for their opinion first. All this due diligence and reasonableness of mine in part is for CS to document this ordeal, so if that times come, they know I'm reasonable and fair.  How did you find this subreddit?  Can you comment a bit on the things you ex spouse did? How did the spouse try to fool the court? Etc etc?   Is my story familiar to you? I read some nightmare scenarios here, with self-harm, death threats, etc, and my wife is much more functional than that, and it makes me wonder if she can fool a judge."

I'll also add as another perspective that I wouldn't give up hope that she'll play nice. In my divorce (no kids involved though) she said to me dozens of times that she was going to 'make this hell for me', 'fight everything', 'refuse to sign stuff'. The day before the court hearing when everything was almost finalized she was texting me and calling/screaming all day how she was going to show up in court and ""call it off."" She ended up never doing any of this though. I had to deal with the fear and annoyance of listening to her say all this shit but when it came down to it I really lucked out and she did what I needed every time for the legal stuff to go smoothly. Mine was very different than your situation, but it could just be empty threats. Obviously, either way I'd continue preparing for every possibility as you have been.

Not that it isn't stressful regardless! Just that if you stick to your guns and stay consistent, she may come around and pretend that she never said any of those things to begin with anyway.  My advice (and I do not follow it myself) is only worry about what is in front of you today. Tomorrow cannot be predicted anyway. Prepare, but don't fret.

You can set them up through your internet router and monitor them live, at any time, through a smart phone or computer. There are also usually recording capabilities.   Do you feel some of your panic or concern is unprecedented? I've been doing some reading on calming anxiety and one thing the author discusses is IF versus IS (facts, not feelings). How much of you truly believes your BPD parent may violently come after you by breaking into your home? Compare that with what you believe will REALLY happen. Are you still concerned that this is a likely outcome?   If you still feel your concern is justified, go with your gut and err on the side of caution. In fact, acting cautiously if you're not sure is probably not a decision you'll regret."

Deep down, your parent probably loves you. Deep down your parent is probably trying to avoid hurting you. But your parent is in a body that has a serious neurological defect. Your parent really isn't in control of his / her emotions and actions. Your parent really is incapable of understanding the consequences of what he / she says and does.

I seem to have lost that woman along the way and when I looked for her I was just pointing out to her that her mask was already falling off.   She's been texting me sad stuff and how she is crying. She still has my slippers there which she says makes her feel I'm still close as she's wearing them around her place.   I know I'm going to move on. I don't need to expose myself to herpes and if I did, the woman would have to clearly be someone wonderful I'd easily see spending my life with.

I sent her a brief text saying I'm out with friends at the movies (she couldn't sit through a film at the cinema because of her anxieties).

What helps me to take the right actions is to frame it in 'the greater good'.  Now CLEARLY you need to get out of this relationship for you, for the reasons you've said.  BUT I have to say, in my experience, you feeling like a silent asshole (FEELING that way, not being one), 'letting' her be so clingy and draw out enabling type reinforcement for her at her request (the things she wanted from you, but if you didn't do them I suspect things would have become very chaotic).. Well, the 'greater good' I can see here is that this woman clearly needs to face her consequences, hit her bottom, and hopefully grow accountable for her own life and recovery.  She needs something to desire change and use that to seek therapy for herself.  In 'the greater good' the best move you can take for her and not just yourself, might be to be blunt with her, cut ties, and let her face the consequences of enveloping you instead of seeking treatment (though not worded like that obviously.. just you can't and if she must know, the behavior that means you can't).  Maybe you can think of other ways in the bigger picture you are being more truly empathetic or sensitive.. but honestly, it doesn't matter.  This is your life, you only get one of these.  Every reason you've mentioned has been valid to leave and not even selfish (sometimes it just feels that way to us)."

BPDlovedones,3c662c,Shanguerrilla,3,Sun Jul 5 05:06:48 2015 UTC,"Well damn, this question is a kick in the pants.    If I'm being honest, I'm getting absolutely nothing out of my marriage, and I can't remember the last time I did.    Financially, he provides the absolute bare minimum to cover his half of the bills; I will actually get more money in child support than what he provides while we're still married and living together.  Emotionally, he's been gone for years.  I've lost count of how many times he's told me that he's not strong enough to support me if I have so much as a bad day and want a hug.  In the past, if I was not 100% happy, 100% of the time, he would get angry with me, which led to him having an outburst, which led to him having extreme depression, which led to me having to console him.  This doesn't happen anymore because I just bury all of my feelings around him and get them out with my therapist.  In reverse, I need to be completely available to support him at any given moment, in the exact manner he requires (which always changes, and I'm always wrong because he never communicates what he needs), and hell.will.be.raised if I am even a fraction off of that. Since I'm not psychic and always wrong in my manner of support, it causes him to rage. I can't even count how many days of work I've missed in the last four years watching over him to keep him from killing himself, or how many doctors appointments I've made for him (at his request) that he hasn't gone to.  Since he's gone on anti-depressants, these kind of lows have pretty much disappeared, but have been replaced by this ""I am God"" narcissism and new rages triggered by ridiculous perceived slights that have been even worse for me and my son.   Physically, it's a joke. We've had sex twice in the last three years because he has no sex drive. It's a miracle (and complete fluke) my son was conceived. His maximum level of affection towards me was a peck on the lips and a quick hug. I routinely get screamed at for treating him like ""roommate"", yet when I remind him it's because HE'S the one without a sex drive, I get screamed at for being a ""slut"" and a ""whore"" and that I should just ""spread my legs and let every man in town stick their **** in me"".  I've never pressured him to have sex, I've never cheated on him, but I can simply never win.  At this point, it's been months since we've been within five feet of each other, so there's nothing now.   It didn't use to be like this.  The first two years of our relationship were perfect... just enough time to get me to deeply love him and be willing to endure the last four years.  But he's systematically chipped that away until there's nothing left.  Especially in the last two years, I've been threatened, I've been emotionally, verbally and physically abused (by physically, I mean he has spit and thrown things at me, he has not touched me, or his ass would be in jail) and I've been left to take care of our entire house, pets and son on my own, only to be raged at when I have nothing left to give him.    We talk of splitting up all the time.  In the past month, we've twice made concrete plans of separating, but he won't follow through on his end, which is finding an apartment.  I feel like he thinks he's calling my bluff, but he doesn't realize I am absolutely done with this relationship.  Instead, he went out and adopted a puppy this week, probably thinking it would solve all of our problems.  All it's done is mean more work for me.    And this is just the tip of the iceberg on what I could say about all the things broken in this relationship.  The only joy I have in my life is my son, but I can see the potential for so much happiness if I could just get out of this relationship.  My husband is just making it so hard to do it in a manner that's not going to bankrupt both of us or cause even more damage to our son.  And that's the only reason this sham continues."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,always_awake9,3,Sun Jul 5 14:11:54 2015 UTC,Best of luck. That sounds really rough. :(
BPDlovedones,3c662c,ket-ho,2,Sun Jul 5 20:04:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  It was, but now that I don't care to tiptoe around him anymore it's actually become a little bit better.  When I get out, though, that's when it'll truly be happy."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,always_awake9,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:21:06 2015 UTC,"Clearly, I can really relate with a lot of this!  Thank you for sharing.    I'm sorry you are going through such a difficult time and relationship, you seem like a very strong and patient person.    I think my wife's only previously been ceasing her push for divorce for our son and for fear of the thin possibility she might lose him to me.  I updated my OP, today we've gotten more serious about divorce than ever before.  I'm unsure where things stand now because I'm done being scared of the end of this marriage.  I'm fearful for my son, but if things will implode it's honestly best before she gets her immigration issues resolved (though it doesn't directly affect custody).  I just wish I had a wife I could love that didn't split me about the way I invite her to a table and if I point out the slight was unintended or due to her perception- she'd try to divorce me.  Like, why can't divorce threats be for actual problems, not imaginary ones?  She said she's hiring a lawyer.  I'm thinking about cancelling her credit card (she doesn't work and the card is in my name instead of hers).  I just don't know what I'm going to do in the near future, how things will turn out, or what I 'should' do.  I guess I never knew those three answers, but with my wife talking about taking my son from me they are more ominous now.  Thanks again for sharing."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,always_awake9,2,Sun Jul 5 21:44:58 2015 UTC,"Reading your update... It sounds very familiar to me.  I had that moment several months ago, and looking back, that was the moment where I had unconsciously decided the marriage was over.  I wonder if you're starting that process?  I just got to a point where I realized this was going to be the best our relationship was ever going to be, and it was depressing to think I'd spend the next 50 years like this.   And I agree with other comments... see a lawyer.  Even to just get some basic information, especially on whether or not to cancel that credit card."

You do well to carefully and accurately unearth the positives and find the sweet among the sour.  I feel like my taste buds are losing that ability at the moment.    I can really relate to the vulnerability aspect you describe.  I feel like I'm getting closer to that not being enough- which is fine I guess since after I made this post she's now more serious about divorce than ever...  You are very wise to recall with such clarity and observe how he has changed since separation along with the understanding that behavior likely wouldn't continue if you two rekindled.  That seems like a very difficult thing to do, but very useful.  You sure are a pleasure to read when you let people inside your thoughts and feelings.

BPDlovedones,3c662c,1978_anon_guy,3,Sun Jul 5 11:54:00 2015 UTC,"This. Read all of it. I went through this with my ex before. We're divorcing now. 2 daughters, 4 and 6. Best thing I could have done for them was to divorce the crazy in-denial, refusing to get help, no self-insight whatsoever, BPD ... bitch of an ex. I gave and gave while she took and took. Fuck her! I hope she finds her match in another man who will be an even bigger scammer than she is. She does not deserve you. You're beyond good.  You're a wonderful man, husband and father. She does not deserve to be a mother. Leave this shit situation man. I'm sorry..."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,way2manycooks,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your support anon.    Man, I almost dislike how quickly this ended up blowing over.  The next morning she was tearfully apologetic (it felt more real and honestly is the first time she's done so uninstigated).  She acted perfectly normal and close after that..  I took her to a therapy session (the week before she told me she wasn't doing it anymore), I've instilled she will be going much more often and needs to actually work on herself, she is submitting to that for now.. but I'm not 'making' her go, it is something she has previously agreed to and hopefully doing it 'for her', though I wonder.    I feel like an idiot or everyone but me views me as codependent for staying in this marriage.  Not that such perception would bother me, but I lament the nagging doubt it might be true.  Basically, like /u/RudolphRed mentions I might have to be the one to end this marriage someday.  Her divorce threats remind me of this wanna-be gangster who used to try to fight me.  He'd talk and talk and talk fighting words to my nose, but never swing to my face.  Only try to jump me from behind or with friends (luckily, still unsuccessfully but it doesn't matter).  She talks of divorce and is 'threatening' but it doesn't get the same reaction from me anymore.  These days I'm like sure, lets do it, BUT explain to me why.  I still make it clear I 'can' forgive her and we could be close and she is loved, but I won't hurt to divorce her and the minute she leaves she's never coming back in my life.  That instead she can choose to stay and I'll keep supporting her, but she needs to be diligently getting professional help, I won't be abused, I won't be responsible for her emotions and she will be responsible for her actions.  She keeps choosing that.  One day I expect I won't have such a redeeming clause to respond to her divorce threat, or one day I may be the one initiating it..  but that day isn't today.    I feel like a dupe, but there ARE hard lines I won't accept and things she could do that would immediately make me leave her, it's just that she hasn't crossed those lines yet.  She's never gotten violent, hurt our son, or cheated.. she usually submits to the consequences make her face and regrets her bad actions.  I just feel like a dupe for letting the things that aren't my 'hard lines' keep getting crossed.  I really appreciate you experience sharing and your support.  I don't know where I'd be without you and the others in this sub, but wherever I'd be I'd be broken and unempowered.    I at least feel like, for now I am staying for my own decision rather than obligation, guilt, or fear.  I still don't know if staying is the right choice though, I hope I'm not making a mistake."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,way2manycooks,2,Mon Jul 6 07:42:31 2015 UTC,"My parents told me the same thing. Every time I stayed or chose to reconcile, they said it was my decision and they'd stand behind it. The last time my ex attacked me, I called the cops and I was evicted by my scamming in-laws though... My parents told me that they're getting old and will soon not be able to bail me out anytime my ex had an explosion. I don't ever want to be dependent on anyone else for shelter. I'm paying rent now but I know I'll have a place to sleep tonight, 100%. Also, I won't have any more ultimatums to liquidate my retirement. My ex still has a restraining order on her extended into January of 2016."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,elev84u,3,Tue Jul 7 21:12:38 2015 UTC,"He asked me, ""What am I getting out of my marriage? It seems like I give and give and don't get anything back."" Honestly, I think it seems that way, because it is. The hard part is it doesn't have to be.   I was just home for the holiday weekend and can totally identify. Usually, the people that love us the most can offer some truly valuable insight (and validation!) This is something I've come to realize now that my SO is in another state and I feel more at ease to talk about my life with friends. I still try not to talk about the state of my relationship with family because I don't think they would ever forgive him or fully accept him if we manage to repair things. Except for my dad, he is the most patient and supportive human being in the entire world. It's important to give thought to what family and outsiders have to say so we don't completely lose track of reality.    Sometimes she won't even give me the satisfaction of 'seeing' me let alone hearing me and well beneath actually responding. I would have felt 'given' more tonight if she'd just given me a look.    Another ""I identify"" moment. I often tell him it feels like we're just roommates. Hardly friends with benefits, I'd imagine there's at least arousal involved when you're sexually charged enough to want to be physical with someone.   Your question seems to stem back to what's fair, and this is something I struggle with. We give and give in our relationships and then....   but sometimes these little things are just little things.. I'm confident I could have started a tantrum or pointless argument and any step along the things I'm whining about tonight. When she crosses certain lines, I do.. but some of this little stuff feels better to just be unmoved about.   Finally we just shut down. It's like, why try? Why even have wants and needs and desires. It seems like these are all things you're expected to give up when you're with someone who has BPD.   I suppose that's not true. But the literature does seem to point toward ""you do you, boo"" which does not always result in a more enjoyable or fulfilling relationship with another person. I guess that's why relationships end.   I think your question resonates with most of us in this sub because you have struck a nerve.   I mentioned I've been talking more with friends about what's going on; they've all pointed out how unfair/unbalanced the relationship is. I think it eventually boils down to: are the pros outweighing the cons? That can be very hard to gauge. How much is a person expected to put up with? As you mentioned, the hard part is that it doesn't have to be hard. But ending things is kind of like putting to sleep a friend you don't want to kill.   If you asked me what anyone should get out of a relationship, before I started dating my BPDSO, I would have told you the answer is mutual love, support, and appreciation. I guess that voice has been quieted and is just now reemerging as my head becomes more clear now that he's not in my immediate vicinity. Still, we find ourselves pining for that honeymoon period, hoping against hope that things can be that way again. Boy does truth hurt."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,Tastygroove,2,Tue Jul 7 23:41:11 2015 UTC,You're so great to talk to.  It's always so striking to me how much you and I identify with.  We'd pass each other on the streets as strangers and at glance never in a million years guess.  Lotta good insight throughout and your last paragraph is particularly hard hitting.
BPDlovedones,3c662c,mrsmanicotti,3,Mon Jul 6 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"I so agree.   I hope things can be fun and exciting again one day, I don't think it's impossible when two people are committed to making it work."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,cookieredittor,3,Mon Jul 6 22:44:00 2015 UTC,"This place is a godsend! I was married to a BPD woman for a year and and had some of the most sincere, life changing moments of my life with her (10% of the relationship. The other 90% was I am the most amazing selfless guy/ I am a complete asshole.) Over and over and over.   When I would speak directly about certain issues she said it was like a ""physical slap to the face"". Like I was ""physically hitting her with words."". We remained friends after the divorce but because of the divorce I was forced to move 3.5 hours away. Now I see my 2 daughters 8 and 6 years old only twice a month. Before it was several times a week.  This has messed me up bad friends. About a month ago after her ignoring me half the day, even though the night before we were having what I thought was a great talk, she gets cold with me and says how annoying I'm being. I finally had enough and said ""why prolong the innevitable. Just tell me goodbye and lets end it."" her response: ""Fine then, goodbye"". I block her on everything and then 7 days later realized she blocked me on facebook and bam, 7 days later she has a picture with a guy on her profile and her status showed she was in a relationship witth him. We had only been divorced for 3 months and she has a dating profile that says she is flat out looking for marriage.  So yeah. It is crazy how easy BPD's can let go. I wonder if those very good times were real? Were they real? It seemed so much.  We had moments where we cried together and they were honestly some of the best moments of my ENTIRE life. It has been so damn hard LETTING HER GO.   I feel like I do not understand who I really was with. How messed up she is.   The guy she is with seems to have lesser morals than her. She and I are Mormon. She wants someone that can take her to a Mormon temple and this guy seems pretty rebellious.  She has only had 3 major relationships in her life and she is like 37 now. She had a boyfriend as a teenager. She got married at 19 for 6 years and then was single and then married me about 1.5 years ago.  Do BPD's ever contact their exes? Ever say they are sorry? Ever offer any closure?  I have decided I will not contact her again unless perhaps it is years from now. It has now been about a month and a half since we spoke. So she has been with this guy for about that long as well. I am sure he was already in her life.  It kills me. I wonder if she has broken her morals with him sexually even though she kept them with me until marriage. I wonder if she will marry him. She very much wanted a 2nd child. Who knows what she will do but at this point, not too much will surprise me.  Any thoughts on all this would help me IMMENSELY. I have been in hell since this divorce and especially after no more talking.  I wonder if she will ever get help. She does have friends and a loving family around her. Though I wouldn't call her friends the best kind of friends. Her friends are either pretty damn weird, or narcissistic or both it seems."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,cookieredittor,2,Tue Jul 7 00:44:13 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal. You cannot give emotionally flat replies to your bpd so. You have to act. You have to add the proper connotation or she will add it for you based on her mood. ""Yes, I did"" with a flat tone sounds like ""I fucking did now leave me the fuck alone."" But ""yes sweetpea"" with a coddling tone and a wink or a smile forces the connotation ""I did it because you asked and I love you.""   All of those times she said ""you yelled at me."" When in fact you were very calm and rational? Yep... This is what's happening.   You have to do this when she's mad at something to. ""Huh, that sucks"" with a flat tone = you are not listening, you don't understand her feelings, or worse you agree with the person she's hating on. Of she's talking about a bitch at work(even if you believe she may have instigated the situation herself) you damn better well agree she's a cunt.. Even take it up another notch. This mirroring will allow her in many cases to see she may be overreacting. Once you are past this you can talk about logical cause and event that may have lead both of them to an uncomfortable situation through nobody's fault. But first and foremost react with emotion so that she feels you understand how she feels."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,cookieredittor,3,Fri Jul 10 00:40:06 2015 UTC,You are absolutely right.  My problem now is that I am getting extremely obstinate...  I don't want to caretake her even the auxiliary way of walking on eggshells with my tone and being super-duper lovey dovey while being disrespected or withheld affection in return.  I can't do that any more.  You are so correct though and it really helped me better frame recent events.    Your advice is very sound though.  The therapist I started seeing truly said the same thing you suggest in your post- to respond and speak with emotion so she understands how I feel.  She's much more emotional than I am and more sensitive.  I use too many words and get too logical still.  Great post and I thank you for it.
BPDlovedones,3c662c,RudolphRed,2,Sun Jul 5 18:20:29 2015 UTC,"The positive things about my SO are that he absolutely adores me. Every little thing I do is magnified about 100x. This is conversely a huge pain in the ass, having someone dependent on me for their emotional well being. The good aspect about this is that when he is not splitting he will help me in anyway I ask, he is respectful,  thankful and grateful.  He also possesses many admirable qualities such as sticking up for injustice, and coming to the aid of people in need. He is attractive, funny and can at times have surprising insight into people.  When he splits it can be the opposite,  he can petty, childish,  and vindictive. So when he is stable we make a good team, keeping a well run home and enjoy each others company.  When isn't stable I feel lonely because he is so emotional immature and I feel I don't have an equal adult as a partner. Regarding your recent episode with your wife, I can relate to your frustration. It's times like that when I wonder what it would be like to just be with someone who doesn't have ""emotional sunburn"". No drama, someone content inside that can not ""sweat the small stuff"" . I wish I had some advice about how to help her from being so emotional over sensitive.  I would have to say, as has been said many times before DBT would probably be helpful.  I did a workbook with my SO under the guise of "" helping both of us"" and it actually did. Getting the BPD to just do some of the calming meditation practices when they are all worked up helps. Such as sitting in silence and breathing and focusing on what sounds you can hear around you, can help them get out of that reactionary Amygdala and move into the higher part of the brain."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,RudolphRed,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:36:19 2015 UTC,"Although I agree that maybe leaning emotionally on someone with BPD might be demanding too much of them, there are other positive things you can get from the relationship.  However, if all you want in the relationship is leaning on them, you might be codependent. And if you are in a relationship where you don't get anything good from, you need change it.   With all that said, with my stbx wife, we had a lot of fun, great sex, and a good working partnership for many things. I'm going to miss all that, but her crazy is too dangerous and too much now to compensate. I'm still too stress and worried to miss her, but i know when it hits me, i'm going to cry a lot."
BPDlovedones,3c662c,RudolphRed,2,Mon Jul 6 04:28:22 2015 UTC,"You word this perfectly to illustrate great points friend.  I mentioned about the illusive 'perfect' SO for a BPD and the lack of emotional support I believe that might levy less to mean that is 'all' I needed or desired.  I'm still operating on the hope that if I ever arrive there, that will be 'enough'.  I also don't really believe the answer to 'what am I getting out of this relationship' is simply the positive things I can mention.  We do have good sex and we've been more healthy and close about it.  She takes pretty good care of our home and son, when I hold strong boundaries (as I work from home) I can provide well under our relationship framework and she doesn't need to work.  I can enjoy spending time with her pretty regularly.  My problem is more about the missing friendship in the marriage I believe.  I find it hard to relax, be open, or as /u/sheltering_sky recounts to never be vulnerable because my wife will be more vulnerable or attacking.    Now, I can't really believe that I will ever reach a point I am never vulnerable, so in response I have to not share a lot of my feelings or hide part of myself.  I guess, I just feel like emotionally my wife doesn't 'give' me much.  You might be right, but I don't quite believe personally that desiring emotional closeness automatically infers codependence, I hope friendship and trust and a lack of criticality can exist in inter-dependence and I hope that we can get there.  Basically, due to all the criticality and passive aggression even when things are 'good', I feel more like I have an antagonist than a partner.  I don't need a partner, but sometimes I wonder what I 'get' from living with my greatest antagonist and strapping on armor to her everyday.  I guess it is more about balance than anything else and sometimes I feel like she gives more criticism and attack than affection.  I believe intrinsically she and I have very different needs or show and need 'love' in different ways.  I don't need a doting and supportive partner, but I'd love to have a wife I felt close to and not consistently attacked from.  I also agree if we aren't 'getting anything' from our SO, we need to change it or leave.    I believe I do 'get' some things from this marriage, it just honestly is a hard question to answer.  Specifically when I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed with the balance and perpetual toll, like last night.  There is a lot of good that counterweights my decision to stay.  I do love her and I know she loves me.  I try not to stay in hope 'she'll change' but in hope that I will, I hope that we can get to a place we are closer and I don't feel I live with an antagonist.  Now I'm not saying that SHE won't BE an antagonist, but that I won't 'feel' that way...    I don't know man, I'm lying to myself if I say there is no caretaking or codependent thought left.  I just have trouble sometimes to squint and see the substance left in this marriage, but it is more about the 'balance' as there is a lot of good here and I stay for the good rather than fear of or an attempt to fix the bad.   I'm going to miss all that, but her crazy is too dangerous and too much now to compensate. I'm still to stress and worried to miss her, but i know when it hits me, i'm going to cry a lot.   I would too buddy.  I'm sorry that you are going through such trials and tribulations.  You've been and are an amazing husband to your wife.  You absolutely honored and gifted her the best partner I can imagine for her.  When you can, in pieces, you really need to take time to grieve.  I sometimes am a little to ignorant of how hurt and hard your time is right now because I know that you will survive and thrive, but I truly support and understand your decision, your efforts to save the marriage prior, and empathize with what you are going though."
BPDlovedones,3bylz1,mrsmanicotti,15,Fri Jul 3 05:41:00 2015 UTC,"This is one of those posts that I always find a bit difficult to comment on. Reading your post, many of my warning alarms go off; your partner with BPD makes a promise to work on his issues - but not with a therapist. Based on your previous post, this is not enough. Based on just this single post and knowledge of BPD, this will not work - or not even happen - in the first place.  It's good that you know to focus on your own well-being now, but you need to take a more honest look at the entire situation. You need to stop trusting promises, and trust actions. You need to figure out your own boundaries and cement them in place.  I advise you to stay at your mother's for a few more days, and to start journaling pretty heavily; it might help your process to write things down - it's a good way to process things, and often we realize/spot/accept things first when we write them down."
BPDlovedones,3bylz1,adesme,2,Fri Jul 3 12:58:55 2015 UTC,"Up vote this comment. Oh God, I went back 2 times to my BPD soon to be ex wife (she promised each time to address her issues, never did)  The third time, she assaulted me, I called the cops, she was whisked away by her crazy mother who arrived at the scene before the police. Now she wants to reconcile and is asking me to come back into the fold. Fuck her and her mother! I want a normal life for myself and my kids, not this hellish existence that she's imposing on everyone. My decision to leave has turned her into a vicious attack dog in court. She has a license to practice law and is representing herself in the divorce process. She's started a hellish distortion campaign that has taken me a lot of time and money to prove false (two child custody investigations, monitored visitations imposed on me, lots of $300/hr lawyer bills for me to defend myself and disprove the ex's lies) One of the recurring patterns with my ex was the fact that she always promised to change, to never behave in the way that led to the blow-ups we had and once I returned, she always, always reneged on all the promises she made to me in order to get me to reconcile. She just wanted me to be back on her turf. She made no efforts to change. She just continued being herself. No therapy for herself. She would continue where the relationship left off, continue blaming me, continue projecting, continue with the emotional and psychological abuse and putdowns. After 7 years of this I had enough. I was also severely emotionally damaged from her abuse (she'd keep me up late with her complaining, I did not feel safe in my home, I was having nightmares, PTSD) My therapist advised NC and a clean break. I've recovered now and I'm living on my own (have a crummy cheap apartment and great job) I've got 50% custody of my 2 daughters. My daughters come back shell-shocked after living with their mom. I can definitely see huge anxiety and irritation in them the first 2 days they're with me. Also they don't want to go back to their mom. They're 4 and 6. Look divorcing a BPD is a nightmare. But the alternative is worse. Living with an untreated BPD who is unwilling to change will leave your kid with lifelong emotional scarring. If you divorce, at least your kid will have a normal household to go to half the time (to counteract the emotional damage inflicted by the BPD) In my case, divorce is the better option for my kids. I can definitely see my kids sustaining a huge amount of emotional damage if we were to reconcile and form a whole family unit again. My kids want us to reconcile, but that's their natural instinct talking. I have to be rational about this and use my head not my heart in my situation. My therapist after the separation explained this to me and ""held my hand"" through the process. She had a brother who had the same situation with his BPD ex so for my therapist my case was more of a personal matter rather than a professional one. 6 months after the separation, I can tell you that leaving my BPD soon to be ex was the best decision of my life. My therapist told me that on average, the non-BPD spouse will reconcile 7 times before leaving for good. Also, in many cases, the BPD will end up leaving after 11 years in the relationship because the boundaries set by the non-BPD get to them. What number reconciliation is this for you mrsmanicotti?"
BPDlovedones,3bylz1,1978_anon_guy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:49:31 2015 UTC,"One of several.  I have grown so much and gained so much insight through things I have learned on this sub. My spirit is good and I have taken responsibility for my well being.  This latest episode may not have worked out, but I will continue to work towards my goals.  My son is college age and my BPDSO didn't come into his life until after my son's Father died. So my son wasn't exposed to the BPD behavior until he was a teen. Once my son graduates it will give me more flexibility.  There are many possibilities for my situation to change before that and I know things will work out. I don't take this failure as a defeat, just an experience to hone my future."

I've stayed far longer than anyone thinks I should have just in order to do this the right way.  You have a plan, and that's what's most important. It sounds like you already know you can't count on your SO changing; you just have to hope this episode sets him straight long enough to buy you some time to get your plan in motion. Best of luck to you and keep your eye on your goal -- living in a healthy environment for you and your son."
BPDlovedones,3bylz1,altyalty_alt,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"I hope things are more calm and stable for you. I think it's a good plan if you can pull it off. If he stays stable, there's a better chance to reach those goals.   Sending you warm thoughts."

BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,cookieredittor,9,Thu Jul 2 13:17:54 2015 UTC,That felt so good to read. Very very happy for you Cookie! You should be proud of yourself and how you handle all of this!
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,Tanglible_Dream,3,Thu Jul 2 13:27:34 2015 UTC,"There is much to come. I admit I was so scared when wife started with her threat to lie to court. But even with fear, i moved, and got informed, and slowly, started to understand better the situation, and how I wasn't as weak legally as she said i was. In fact, legally, i'm in a good position, all i have to do is not let her chaos move me, and do it all by the book, and i can gain a lot of terrain in case things turned nasty and we went to court. Unlike other cases in this sub, my wife is functional enough and scared enough of being evaluated by a psychiatrist, she knows she must keep calm and hide her issues.  Something I forgot to mention was that one of the issues she kept pushing was that she had found a lawyer for me that speaks English, and she wanted me to take this lawyer. She said it as if she was being very nice by helping me with this. I thanked her nicely many times, but told her not to worry about this. (I have a lawyer already, one that speaks english and understands BPD, but I didn't mention this.) Wife got furious because I wouldn't take the lawyer she recommended. Doesn't that sound crazy to you? We are getting divorce, and she demands I use her lawyer of choice, and when i politely decline, she gets furious. If that is an unreasonable demand, i don't know what it is."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,Shanguerrilla,6,Thu Jul 2 14:09:21 2015 UTC,"Man, I am SO PROUD OF YOU.  I think you are doing AMAZING!   It felt like a huge victory for me, and a defeat to her. But in reality, it was just doing what the law says we do.   It felt like a victory because IT WAS!  It wasn't 'just doing what the law said' it was proving (yet again) that you aren't a pushover, that your wife's emotions don't rule logic, showing the mediator your wife's unhealthy and uncalled for rage, and even healthily manipulating your wife (manipulation in itself isn't bad- everyone manipulates... I manipulate a car to not get in wrecks).    I call this a flawless victory!  Hang in there buddy.  Keep being strong, keep posting, remember we are all standing behind you, we all understand.  You are VALIDATED, friend.  This can be such a fearful journey and all the elements at play are crazymaking, but you keep keeping your eye on your son.  I always get a little emotional myself when you mention your vision for the apartment and room for your son with the lego theme.  I think it is great you are already thinking of how to decorate it.  Keep going to that place in your head when you need it.  Keep moving forward and soon you will be able to see that room and your son safe and happy there in more than just your mind!"
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,Churn,2,Thu Jul 2 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks. These days have been more calmed. She is still doing crazy shit to push my buttons, but I think the medium chill is sinking in, so she gives up quicker now."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,dinosaurs_r_awesome,7,Mon Jul 6 08:39:49 2015 UTC,"I'm very happy for you cookieredittor.  Through my divorce, no matter how prepared my lawyer and I were, and even though my exbpdso at one point showed up without an attorney and tried to speak for herself  to sway the judge, I physically shook, my eye twitched, panic set in as she tried to make accusations about me.  After giving in to her view of things for so many years it was hard to realize that others were not buying her stories.  My lawyer quietly objected to irrelevant things she was saying, the judge upheld the objection, my exbpdso kept switching quickly from story to story trying to find something that would get the judge on her side.  When she finished, I was so nervous, but ready to speak on my behalf and try to explain that everything she said was lies.  But I felt so much panic because I was afraid it would just be my word against hers.  You can imagine how surprised when all the judge did was look at me and say, I'm granting your motions, good luck to you sir.  I didn't even have to speak other than to squeak out, ""thank you, your honor.""  As we left the courtroom, my lawyer commented that it was one of the easiest cases she's tried, because my exbpdso did all the work of discrediting herself for her.  Upon reflection, I actually think she became emboldened during her testimony because she saw how her words were causing me distress, so she kept going, deeper and deeper with her testimony because it was hurting me, but it hurt her worse in the eyes of the court.  So I'm just saying that I know how hard it is for us to be objective about how our bpdso can sway people after living in the FOG for so long.  But the professionals can see right through the deception better than we realize, much to our benefit and our children's benefit too.  Stay strong, quiet, and persistent, you are handling things perfectly, I think."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,Churn,4,Thu Jul 2 14:57:55 2015 UTC,After giving in to her view of things for so many years it was hard to realize that others were not buying her stories.   That resonated with me for some reason. I'm hoping it works out that way in my case as well.
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,dinosaurs_r_awesome,2,Thu Jul 2 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"I think I might have written this story somewhere else, but it feels it belongs here.  My wife is telling everyone shit about me. She has a coworker whom i play sports with. Through the vine, I hear she told that coworker all sorts of horrible things about me, completely uncalled for. Her timing was so odd that the coworker didn't know what to make of it, and started asking around if these accusations were true. This is how i heard about it, people warning me about the bad rumors around me. I just told them this was frustrating, but not surprising, given the high conflict divorce. However, i all i could do was be myself, and hope people saw through that. Getting defensive only makes me look desperate, and makes her false accusations have more weight. Also, although i could retaliate by talking badly about her, i don't want to affect her work, so i don't see the good on telling her coworker (my friend) my version of events.  I thought that was the end of it.   Later, through the vine i heard that her coworker, was saying how he doesn't like her at all, that nobody at works like her because she is so difficult to work with,  and that he is taking my side in all this. I didn't ask anyone to take my side on this. I don't see the point of being so confrontational, and I hope everyone is cordial to her. However, i suspect her coworkers had a lot of grievances with her, and read through her campaign to discredit me, and he chose to have it backfire at her.  I was surprised how much this guy saw through her, as I don't talk to him that much, except focused sports stuff. I guess her behavior speaks loudly."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,JustMeRC,2,Mon Jul 6 09:20:01 2015 UTC,"Your situation is right out of the book ""Splitting"" on this issue. I would say that if the timing was different, and I hadn't been to therapy, and worked so hard on myself, I would have already fallen apart in panic, and given in to her insane demands. I consider myself lucky that I had time to take steps to work on myself before this hard thing happened.  However, also, BPD works in a spectrum. My wife is very functional, and she gets triggered mostly at night, when with me only. Also, I suspect she was planning to do some really crazy shit, but her lawyer, who sounds reasonable, so far convinced her to be more reasonable for now."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,JustMeRC,5,Fri Jul 3 09:17:09 2015 UTC,"Yes! my lawyer and I both read the book ""Splitting"".  It not only helped with the case, but provided an improved dialogue between my lawyer and me.  My lawyer had already handled two prior divorce and custody cases where the opposing side had BPD.  After successfully winning those cases, my lawyer now has constant hate mail and death threats from those bpd women for ""taking their babies away"".    Anyhow, the book ""Splitting"" had just come out, so neither of us had read it.  My lawyer was very anxious to get it when I told her about it, and at that moment I knew I had the right lawyer.  It's very important that you have a lawyer with experience in dealing with ""High Conflict Personalities"" because a normal lawyer will negotiate to settle, while the opposing BPD will negotiate only to lengthen and delay the proceedings.  A borderline does not want the drama and chaos to end, so they will keep changing their demands, just to keep it going.  Like your wife, mine was very functional too, she fooled me early on.  She also mostly triggered when it was just us, or her kids from previous marriages present.  Because she normally controlled herself in front of outsiders, I feared she would keep it together in court.  But she didn't.  Another thing to consider in your strategy, I don't recall how young your child is, but mine was 15 when the divorce started.  So our strategy was to only focus on the divorce and nothing about custody other than normal ""joint"" or equal custody until the divorce was final.  Giving my ex, more things to flip flop on would just prolong the divorce and drive costs up anyways.  So the plan was to finalize the divorce, while gathering evidence to use to take her parental rights away completely.  After the divorce, with enough evidence we'd file a new motion regarding custody.  I also knew from watching her with her grown daughters from previous marriages that she would drive our son away on her own now that he was old enough to know she was mistreating and manipulating him.  As it turned out though, the divorce was final on a Friday, by Monday, I had emergency custody of our son, as she attempted suicide multiple times with pills, threatened him for wanting to see his dad, and destroyed his computer in his bedroom and broke his window and threw his clothes out to the street telling him to get out and never come back if he wanted to see his dad.  Her situation deteriorated to even worse things that week, so we filed new motions regarding custody using only what she did during that week as evidence and won.  Now my son, barely has contact with her, text messages once in a while and he's doing great!  He has lots of friends, a job, was voted home coming prince his Junior year, and is making plans for college after her graduates next May.  My ex on the other hand, spiraled out of control further, her daughters no longer contact her, her sister and family have also given up on her.  All because she still refuses to admit she has a disorder and needs help with it.  So to this day, she periodically lashes out at people (social media, etc) blaming everyone but herself for her abandonment.  This is one of the saddest things about BPD in my opinion, they have such a strong fear of ""Abandonment"" but it's they themselves that cause it.  In summary, I just want to share that it got really bad (worse than I'm willing to share here) during the divorce but mostly immediately after the divorce was final when she realized I was going to have my son that next week.  During the divorce she kept him from me, so I had to sneak to meet him at the mall, etc.. Again, we didn't bring her refusal to let me see him, into the divorce proceedings. Doing so, would slow things down, giving her more things to fight about, but we documented every refusal for visitation, saving it for later.  So it was bad, got really bad, then got worse, but in the end, it all worked out for the best, so keep looking to the future, focusing on that, is all that got me through the worst of it.  Knowing that one day it would finally end and without her, the future would be so much better for my son and me, is what kept me alive at the darkest moments.  Stay strong, you can get through it, and you are doing so much better than I did!"
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,JustMeRC,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:52:49 2015 UTC,This sounds like such a scary and dangerous nightmare. I can't begin to imagine how hard this must have been. I'm glad you guys are in a better place now.
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,JustMeRC,6,Fri Jul 3 14:23:48 2015 UTC,👍🍻 I'm happy for you! You've shown a lot of grace and emotional control.
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,JustMeRC,3,Thu Jul 2 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I do worry at any minute her lawyer (who sounds reasonable) will lose control over the situation, and wife will pull off stuff like your's did, and we end up deep in an expensive court battle. It is such a hard balance to keep."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,mrsmanicotti,4,Fri Jul 3 09:28:08 2015 UTC,"I read more of your posts and comments than I respond to, but I wanted to express my sincere happiness and support after reading this one! I'm so glad things went as well as they did, and give you a big high five for remaining so calm and not caving in! I know you still have a way to go before that dream of your own place becomes a reality, but this looks like a major step in a positive direction! Congratulations, and great job!!!"
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,1978_anon_guy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:17:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks. This has been hell for me, and the only way i've been able to stay strong is to focus on being strong for my son."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,1978_anon_guy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:40:30 2015 UTC,"I come to this sub because my MIL and SIL have uBPD. My husband was in your son's position growing up. The one thing that made a difference for him in a positive way, was having a sane father who showed him what normal looked like. I truly believe it's the reason he can have a healthy relationship with me, and is such a good guy. Your son is very lucky to have you handle this all as skillfully as you are!"
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,MrThrowawayMonster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:13:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the pat in the back, and for telling me a story with some hope in it. I'm in the process of doing all i can for that.  To be honest, today, right now, i feel pretty bad.  I might have to do some big career changes to be there for son, and my work productive is zero right now. I can't concentrate on anything except some hobbies. I also have to do some preparations for the new life separate (find a new apartment, deal with car stuff, etc), and i can't focus enough to get anything done, which makes me feel useless. I think that after all the stress and tension for so long, and kind of crashing."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,penny_for_thoughts,2,Mon Jul 6 14:03:40 2015 UTC,"Transitions can be so difficult. I'm sorry you're feeling stuck right now. I think it's very normal to feel the way you are feeling, after what you've been going through. You've been working so hard to achieve a certain goal, that once you get over a big hump, you kind of need to regroup for the next phase. That's ok. Don't get down on yourself about it. Think of it as a natural part of the process. You won't be stuck forever.  I don't know if you remember, but I posted some meditation links a while back, which you seemed interested in. So I'm going to speak a bit from that perspective.  Sometimes I like to think of it in terms of breathing. People usually think that breathing has two steps: an in-breath, and an out-breath. Yet, if you pay close attention, there is another part to it- a slight pause while the tide is turning. You can see it in an ocean wave also. You are just at that turning point. Take a moment to appreciate the pause and feel secure in the place you are right now in this very moment.  You may feel the pull of anticipation from the list of things ahead of you. The trick is not to be in the anticipation of future, but to settle for a moment with peace in the uncertainty of right now. Being in the moment is the antidote for your lack of focus on what comes next. When you catch your mind thinking of all the things you need to do, but can't put action to right now, bring the focus back to your breathing. It is your constant companion and lifelong friend. Tell yourself that all you have to do in this moment is breathe.  People think that planning is protective. That looking at a problem from every which way will save them from anything that might go wrong. You have most likely been cultivating this mindset as a reaction to your wife's unpredictability. It has served you, and has brought you to the successful milestone where you are right now. It is a good old friend, and you may need him again.  Still it's ok to walk away from him for now. The truth is, you've learned the tools you need to handle anything that comes your way. You will start to gain momentum again, taking one task at a time until you get to the top of the next mountain.   For now, just breathe and allow yourself to feel the full greatness of the view from the top. You may not have thought you'd ever reach this peak after so many years trudging up hill. Even though you've imagined the ultimate summit which you have yet to get to, you may not have anticipated the transitional feeling of this smaller victory. Things will get rolling again very soon. In the mean time, just breathe. It's ok to pause between the tension of the past, and the preparations of the future. You do not have to feel useless for taking a moment in between.   I like to do Metta (Loving Kindness) meditation for myself when I feel similarly to what you've described. You start by focusing on your breathing, then you watch your thoughts as they enter your mind. To quiet them down, you counteract them with a new way of thinking by repeating some phrases slowly in your mind and letting them wash over you. Here are some examples, but you can adjust them a bit if you need to.  May I feel safe and protected.  May I be truly happy and deeply peaceful.  May I appreciate my life, just the way it is in this very moment.  May I feel free.  Edit: Here's a link to my favorite guided Loving Kindness meditation recording."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,penny_for_thoughts,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:50:56 2015 UTC,"I do remember the links you posted. They led me to a lot of great stuff. Thanks thanks thanks for this and for what you just wrote. I really needed this right now, you have no idea, and this way of explaining things is one that has helped me a lot through these challenges.  My wife just came in angry, saying she isn't going to go to the mediation again. So the 50% deal we had is off now. The book ""Splitting"" predicted this might happen."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,RudolphRed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:38:55 2015 UTC,"I'm glad if this perspective is helpful to you. You've written many things that have given me direction for dealing/coping with my husband's mother and sister, so I'm glad to be able to return the favor in a small way.  Well, so much for getting a moment to take a breath! Not with someone with BPD- always keeping us on our toes. I guess the trick is to be able to breathe even in the midst of the chaos, which can be challenging but is not impossible. Someone told me that practicing Metta works best if we do it regularly when conditions are more ideal. Like a tennis player who perfects their swing in practice, so they are ready when the ball comes flying at them from their opponent during a match. What does one do when one's opponent keeps lobbing balls straight at our heads almost every day, hehe?  I hope that your wife's declaration isn't enough to derail things. Can you still proceed even if she's unwilling?"
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,EvensongSunsoar,2,Tue Jul 7 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"I'm taking each of these challenges as opportunities to practice these things, and become stronger. This is hell, I accept this, and I'll come out of it stronger. I chose to do this for my son.   I hope that your wife's declaration isn't enough to derail things.    It complicates things a lot, as it closes up amicable options. It is the hardest for our son and for me in the short term. It makes things bad for her in the long term. I'm getting informed to see how I can proceed. The path she is taking might end up as a nasty court battle of her trying to prevent me from seeing son. Details here.  But yes, i really mean it when i say your post really helped me. The timing of it was amazing. Thanks. This a good community."
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,way2manycooks,2,Tue Jul 7 14:42:10 2015 UTC,This a good community.   I agree wholeheartedly!
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,ijustneedahug,4,Tue Jul 7 15:57:02 2015 UTC,I am so excited and happy for you! You were a tough cookie that didn't crumble!  I know it must of been difficult and the preparation and forethought you put in is amazing.  Wishing you more good to come!
BPDlovedones,3bvbkj,ijustneedahug,2,Fri Jul 3 05:22:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Recall I used to have panic attacks over this stuff, and would give in to her insane demands. She knew which buttons to push, and tried them all, but they don't work anymore. That in itself was a victory of personal growth. Without this strength I gained from therapy, I couldn't have been strong for my son."
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,MrThrowawayMonster,5,Thu Jul 2 03:50:29 2015 UTC,This is heartbreaking for you and your children. Keep doing whats right for your children and may the courts be with you.
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,mrsmanicotti,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:05:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the encouragement!
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,cookieredittor,4,Thu Jul 2 15:20:58 2015 UTC,she's going to get crazier than ever before.   Document this. You are fighting for your children. Document everything. Get a secret recording device. Have the police on speed dial. Don't wait. Be ready.
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,cookieredittor,3,Thu Jul 2 12:13:11 2015 UTC,"I have been saving literally everything. I just recently got an Android watch, and I live in a one-party consent state, so I have recordings in addition to the emails, texts, and reddit posts. My lawyer is amazing in that even though I have legal rights that I could have exercised, he advised me to continue to be patient and allow her to dig herself a deeper hole, which she has consistently done. We are filing now because he is very confident that we have more than enough evidence to show a judge that she should not have residential custody without having to go into a ""psychological instability"" war, which is a legal nightmare.   The thing that I am more concerned about is if she DOES want to talk. Last time I saw her, my codependency was WAY stronger than the Xanax I took. I'm thinking that if she wants to talk, I'll just tell her that we can talk through our lawyers or something like that.   Either way, I'm moving onward and upward, and I have you guys to thank for it."
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,Shanguerrilla,2,Thu Jul 2 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"Stay strong, this is for the long haul. Make time for your needs, so you can stay strong.  I went to get a massage yesterday, just because it feels good to do nice stuff for myself."
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,cookieredittor,4,Fri Jul 3 09:25:50 2015 UTC,"Please do as Cookie suggests (though knowing you, I know you will).  I can relate to the desire to show everyone how she has acted and what she has said and done.  Right now that serves no purpose and I realize you won't.  But I wish to reaffirm that its purpose, that others understand her and what you are going through- you have that here.  Man we can relate, we see how insightful, patient, how long suffering, how much you tried to make this work, and we can empathize with what you are and have gone through.  I'm so so sorry that you are dealing with this and fighting such a difficult battle.  NOTHING is more important than our children and those we love, and our own well being is also incredibly important (this struggle hurts you deeply as well).  I pray that the courts will see where the children will be best.  If she doesn't come home and diligently work to improve (which honestly isn't that likely I'd guess) then I hope you can document everything and that she shows the courts herself how her mental stability and priorities are right now.    Keep active here.  Keep investing in yourself and strengthening yourself.  Rest when you need it.  Please stay strong.   You really are an amazing guy, you can do this.  You children are blessed to have you in their lives!"
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,Shanguerrilla,2,Thu Jul 2 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"If she doesn't come home and diligently work to improve (which honestly isn't that likely I'd guess)   Funny you say this because when my mother dropped off the kids a few days ago, she gave her ""The High-Conflict Couple"". When my mom asked if she read it, my wife scoffed and said something to the effect of ""Yeah he's made it very clear what HE thinks this is"". It's sad that she could even take a book to offense; even the mere suggestion that SHE should take ANY responsibility for CHEATING on me is laughable to her.   Sure, she'll cry about it in front of the judge and her lawyer to show that she isn't a ""monster"", but in reality, she has absolutely no remorse for what she did to start this or what she's doing in taking my children away. That's what makes BPD so tough: it's a PD that is comprised of 75% women in a society where a woman's behavior is always the fault of some other person or social construct. She truly believes that I ""made"" her do what she did; she's been saying that as an excuse for her behavior since even before we were married.   that others understand her and what you are going through- you have that here   I really love this place. I have been trying to contribute more where I can, but I'm only 3 months in, so there are very few that I can help yet. I hope to be able to strengthen others as much as I have gotten (especially from you and u/cookieredittor!)"
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,ThisBorderlineLife,2,Thu Jul 2 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"Before I learned about BPD, I read a book about abusive relationships. After one of many talks with wife, she said she was going to work on her stuff, and wanted to read the book as well. It was about how to communicate better, not fight dirty, etc.  Big mistake. The book had an appendix discussing PDs. I hadn't read it, because it was an appendix. All she took from the book was that I wanted to diagnose her with BPD. Because of her reaction, i started to look more closely at BPD, and yup."
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:25:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, hadn't heard the details of how that happened.  That's pretty wild.  My wife found one of my books ""Loving Someone With Bpd"" and sat on it a few days, then verbally attacked me about it.  I just held frame- Yes, that's my book.  Her: I don't have this!  The therapist says I am just C-PTSD!  Me: That's okay, I'm not your therapist.  There are some parallels even between C-PTSD behavior and the focus of this book- I read the book for me, I'm trying to help myself be better and better able to respond to you and love you.  Then she kicked up her efforts of trying to emotionally guilt me, bash me about reading it, complain about going to the therapist if I don't believe he's right, threatening to explain to the therapist how I'm trying to diagnose her and convince her she's BPD...  I didn't try to convince her of anything, she just found a book I was reading and took that as an affront of her identity."
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,Shanguerrilla,2,Fri Jul 3 17:41:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to butt in here, but maybe it would ultimately be a good thing if she brought BPD up to her therapist? Obviously they are either overlooking it out of inexperience or trying to not tell her about it due to the severity of the diagnosis. I've experienced the first and heard of the second happening to others.  I had a therapist who misdiagnosed me, and when I finally brought up BPD she agreed with me that I had it and dismissed me. While yes, her refusing to treat me and suggesting I go somewhere else was damaging at the time, but I cannot tell you how helpful it has been to know exactly what I'm dealing with so that I can actually make steps to get better.  So maybe in the long run... It's a blessing in disguise? I can only hope for you, for her and for your family."
BPDlovedones,3bu21f,1978_anon_guy,2,Sat Jul 4 15:42:51 2015 UTC,"I post in this sub more due to her her behavior than official diagnosis.  From the most damaging aspects of her behavior I feel more parallel here than support focused on C-PTSD, especially the unpredictable criticality, slights felt out of seemingly (to me) nowhere, the idealization / devaluation, but even her upbringing really indicates possible BPD..  She's only been to the therapist ~4 times.  I actually went to her recent appointment instead of her (since that Saturday before she came to me looking for a fight and declared she wouldn't go anymore) and in that visit he asked me a little about her relationship with her mom, she was dangerously neglected even basic care as a baby on up.  That seemed to be the first he heard of any of that.  I've never tried to convince him she has BPD as it's not my place, but my wife already knew I suspected BPD and just don't bring it up.. The therapist knows I suspected this as well (because our first couple's visit she brought up in a very hurt way that I suspected she was), so I feel like whether he thinks she is or not- it would be a very bad move at this point to tell her she does (and even worse to tell me).    I started going to him to work on me closer to the beginning of the year.  I'd given all I could the previous couple years to caretake her emotions and I never could regulate what she cannot.  Things were bad in abuse and codependency.  So I work on me and what I can from that equation.  I didn't 'make' her go to therapy as that wouldn't have ever worked, but I tried to make her feel loved and instill I wanted us to be closer.  After I was going a while she started bugging me to go too!  She wanted to set the record straight with the therapist...  Kept wondering what 'awful' things I was telling him.  My wife doesn't really know or research anything about BPD or her C-PTSD diagnosis (I DO think she has that too and never would have suspected without the therapist, either alone or comorbid).  Though her diagnosis really doesn't matter a whole lot, (I DO agree and understand how it could help the individual) what matters to me at this point for her is working to decrease abusive behavior, find better balance, for her to like herself more, and hopefully be happy.  For me, I work to be more assertive in general, but also my needs and to hold up strong boundaries and protect myself without being defensive to her attacks.    Things are honestly going pretty well.  We are lucky to have a therapist that if he did or does think she is BPD, I do know he wouldn't turn her away.  I actually picked him to help me because he supposedly is very familiar with cluster B's and PTSD cases.  I'm very sorry you had to experience such trouble with your therapists, that sounds very difficult."
BPDlovedones,3btolh,dinosaurs_r_awesome,8,Thu Jul 2 01:42:58 2015 UTC,"It sounds like things are extremely difficult and honestly pretty frightening right now.  I'm sorry you are going through this.  My only advice would be to try not to borrow trouble from tomorrow: the results you don't know, the damage that hasn't yet occurred..  There is more than enough problems for now, today, but you can handle them (as difficult as they are).  It is much harder to deal strongly with today's challenges while worrying about years down the road for your loved ones and the things you can't control but will soon find out.  Sorry buddy, sending positive thoughts your way."

I have spoken to the police about this and am proceeding as suggested and saving what i need.  When the first nasty text comes in, draw a firm boundary.  ""I do not wish to engage you.  Please discontinue any texts, calls or emails.""  Let the ensuing evil stream in.  Do NOT repeat your initial instruction or engage her in any way (continued communication may give rise to a defense).  It's hard not to get sucked in but be strong.  Either she will get the message that you're done with the text games, and give up, or you can file charges.  Harassment is a win-win for these people.   Either they bully you into getting their way, or they get the conflict that is like oxygen to them.  Change the game.  And as far as the evaluation goes, that sucks.  The less time that she had to prepare, the better chance even a faulty test (MMPI) will show deceptiveness.  Advance notice of it allows even the worst of sociopaths to fuck the system.  http://doctorkristy.hubpages.com/hub/The-test-that-can-cost-careers-and-ruin-lives-MMPI-2"

Maybe it will help somewhat.  Yes, BPDs are very hard to diagnose, so have realistic expectations. However, you have a very well documented history of her crazy and nasty games, this will for sure count towards a lot. Keep all those texts, and show them. They will count for a lot.   over-applied crazy bright red crooked lipstick   My wife does this!  However, keep in mind, just getting a BPD diagnosis might not be enough to win a custody case right now. This is stuff not only for now, but for the future. You are playing a very long game here, so stay strong. Even if now things don't go your way, her crazy will come out again and again, and you can keep documenting, and when you recover financially, take extra steps for your children.   Once again, this is just one battle, and it is over. But there are more battles to come.    How will our kids come away undamaged?   This is my fear as well. I've talked to a lot of experts. What they insist is the following: be a strong presence in their life, as much as legally possible. Even if legally your home isn't their main home, if your home is a place of peace and calm, in their hearts it will be their home. With time, as the kids age, they will understand this better, and will ask to spend more time with you. With time, and your accumulated evidence, you can ask the court to reevaluate, and the preferences of the kids will be considered.   I do wish you the best outcome on this battle. I hope this battle ends wins you the whole war. But also remember this battle is also improving chances for future battles no matter what.  By the way, for other readers, this case is situation of of the book ""Splitting"" by Eddy and Kreger. OP is handling it very very well, but still, it is freaking hell because the chaos of someone with BPD is very draining.  Bro hug, friend. Write me if you want to talk more."

BPDlovedones,3bq691,Shanguerrilla,4,Wed Jul 1 06:46:16 2015 UTC,"It was very difficult for me to accept that I couldn't count on her when feeling bad, because she would invalidate me, or rage how she has it worse. Like, yes, her argument is that I can't feel bad because she feels worse than me. I tried to explain that we both felt bad, and this wasn't a contest, but it never worked. Her position doesn't even make sense, but once I accepted that indeed, I couldn't rely on her support, everything became easier.   This was the point where I started reaching out for family and friends, working on extending my social circle, etc. It took time, because I had isolated myself in my fear of her. She fought back, she didn't want me to be social. But i'm glad I did. I'm going through hard times, and without borrowing strenght from my friends, I couldn't have made it. It is a constant reminder how it is not normal to be invalidated all the time.  Finally, your health issues sound very difficult and scary. Independent of her judgement on all those, you keep taking measures that you think are good for your well being. Clearly, she can't process your needs, so listening to her about what you can and cannot do is useless. I do hope the doctors find out what the problem is, and propose a way to improve your quality of life. Remember, this is your life. Don't ruin it out because she wants you to.  Before focusing on validating her feelings, focusing on validating yours. Focus on self compassion, on giving yourself time and energy to feel. Never fall in the BPD trap of validating their feelings first and fore most, it just reinforces their entitlement. You go first, because if you don't, you can't be well, and without being well, you can't be strong for your family. Yes, she is sick with a PD. But your job now is to fix yourself, your quality of life, your well being."

I'm starting to be more assertive, more filling of my own needs, less caretaking... but I think I DO still put her first in a way often unnoticed- I still take care her needs and validate her emotions before my own in ways I didn't realize.  Even aside from health issues:   Remember, this is your life. Don't ruin it out because she wants you to.   That has been a lingering fear for almost two years now.  I'm in a better place now, I mostly feel like I'm not and like at least for now I can care for my wellbeing.. but in both these medical issues and emotional ones that is indeed something I very much try to remain cognizant of.

Only then he/she won't doubt when accused by the BPD and only the He/she can validate.  If we try to validate from a weak inner self, we end up validating what we shouldnt, Assuming blame for the wrong stuff, and feeling guilty for their emotions. This is codependence.   This is why our emotional needs must come first."

If the bpd's needs (and here validation) are catered to first, one is prone to getting sidetracked and gaslighted.. Even if it happens for reasons of convenience (although I do think validating, too, does take some emotional effort) it coming first should not be within your boudaries.

In the course of the dinner such a headache began. When it got quite bad, i excused myself and went to a guestroom to lay down on a bed.  My ex came after me to give me company. We didn't speak a word, i was concentrating on relaxing and hoping the headache would go away... After a few minutes my ex said the following words: ""Come on, don't be a cry-baby..."".

I've had a morbid curiosity in the worst of this marriage that my wife 'tries' to make me hurt and weak to make me vulnerable.  Like it is some part of an overarching battle strategy and power-play.  If we are so weak, so hurt, so vulnerable that they feel confident we won't leave them or firmly stand up in the belief we don't 'deserve' their abuse.  I honestly don't believe this, I don't believe my wife is 'evil' though she's been hurtful, self centered, and ill.. Her behavior is rarely meditated steps of useful behavior to any long-term goal (nefarious or not).    In my opinion, some people with personality disorders may never be capable of understanding, healthily empathizing, or not being intimidated by the feelings of those closest to them.

In my experience with the BPDs I've known, it's like they can't validate you because in their black-and-white worldview, if they admit that they know you're hurting then it's like they don't have permission to hurt too, and they can't handle giving away that card. Instead, it's like they punish you for making them feel like they need to compete for attention.   I like that despite what you're going through, you're still making an effort to turn this into a positive lesson for your relationship. Like I said, I really hope it's enough.

I appreciate your optimism, but as much as I love my country I've found that when I've been involved with the justice/legal system, the immigration system, and the medical system- each are incredibly broken.  This trip through healthcare has been incredibly disheartening, if I DO end up having the thing I literally asked my orthopedic Dr. about and he scoffed and said 'no'.. the same things he could have diagnosed or sent me to a rheumatologist to get checked literally 11 years ago when I first saw him for bad joints (he just called it carpel tunnel back then).. I will be pretty pissed.  Right now, I don't really know what the underlying issue is, I will know more after tests.  The things the rheumy thinks it likely is would be bad though, they really have no cure in any country.  I am happy to just be digging deeper as for years I've asked my orthopedic Dr. and neurologist if these symptoms could be signs or caused by something underlying- even suggesting the things the rheumy now suspects.  I'm not looking forward to continuing to have an 'invisible' illness (though I am glad it is).  That in itself brings some invalidation, even in the medical field.  I've even been referred to a pain clinic and with a few things already diagnosed that cause near constant pain didn't get any help with it.  That was around the time I gave up on doctors for a year.  Honestly, I am pretty hopeful about my prospective future..  I just worry if I shouldn't be.

In the beginning of my walk out of codependency, that was something I wondered strongly about as well.  I still wonder if it will be enough.  In my opinion the 'reason' why I'm not allowed to hurt as 'bad' as she hurts is less about her not having permission to hurt if I do, but instead that it necessitates I MUST 'have' feelings at all.  I feel like the one that she's tried hard to require permission to have feelings or to hurt and it has always been the instigator of her worst tantrums.  In fact, a very simple statement about 'just understand I have feelings and it hurt mine' was the thing that pushed her to try to ruin my family relationships and career.    I could really be wrong though, your statement of ""it's like they punish you for making them feel like they need to compete for attention' might very well be a succinct motivator for her not being able to handle my feelings.  I've only ever investigated it skin deep and noted it as the play for control and manipulation.  That might well be what she tries to subjugate me for.

BPDlovedones,3bq691,way2manycooks,2,Wed Jul 1 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"Firstly, so sorry to hear about your health setbacks. I really hope the best possible prognosis comes back. This must be an incredibly difficult and uncertain time for you.    I can't lie- support from my wife would be nice, but I'm not looking for a 'mommy', just wish I had a partner.   There's nothing unreasonable about wanting to feel supported by your partner. This is not a matter of wanting someone to take care of superficial needs, this is your health. When you're diagnosed with a serious illness, you do not need to be surrounded by people who worsen your condition. I hope you always keep this in mind down the line if this continues to be a problem in your relationship. No one is worth staying with if they literally make you sicker than you already are. You expected that you would support one another through sickness and in health. No personality disorder trumps this commitment.   I'm really glad you have a supportive family. And I know you're doing SO much to work on yourself. But here's a little nudge in (hopefully) the right direction: do what feels right to you. Stop making decisions about your health based on what your wife thinks (or even your family). There is still a really negative stigma surrounding marijuana and some recognize the benefits, some don't. Fuck those who don't. You don't owe anyone an explanation. Don't stop doing the one thing that makes you feel better because of an antiquated, arbitrary belief system created by who-the-hell-knows-or-cares. You do you boo! (as my 22 year old brother likes to remind me ;)   I mentioned this another post I wrote elsewhere in this sub:   In When I Say No, I Feel Guilty, the first ""assertive right"" that the author discusses is ""You have the right to judge your own behavior, thoughts, and emotions, and to take the responsibility for their initiation and consequences upon yourself"". When you take this responsibility upon yourself, you take it away from other people who may use judgement to control or manipulate you.    I really think you would benefit from reading this book. It's like 12 cents on amazon. You are the only one that need judge your decision to medicate with MMJ or not. If you decide to (I think you should!), for preemptive reasons, perhaps keep it to yourself.   That's my two cents on the matter. Good luck at the doctor's office and keep us posted!!"
BPDlovedones,3bq691,way2manycooks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:14:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the support /u/way2manycooks , I really appreciate it.  You know, I feel like I could handle this, not even having her support if she'd just get out of my way, stop trying to force me into the FOG for trying to take care my own needs.  Just last night, after what ended up being 4 MRI's and 2 MRA's, I felt awful (for some reason).  I had my brain fog, couldn't think right was dizzy and my neck and head were hurting a little more than usual.  I was very unsure footed.  I told her this.  She wanted me to walk to dogs, I said I really didn't know if I was up to it that I felt pretty awful (before when I've felt like this it got worse, my pupils changed size, one big one small, and lights starting bouncing up and down, then I acted sickly drunk- couldn't walk right, slurred speech, and puked a couple hours with my head spinning- while she videotaped me laughing!  Fuck that pissed me off).  I decided last night to walk the dogs anyway, felt unsteady, but it went fine.  I really did it for my dogs more than her or me.  Then about 13 of her friends dropped by like a lot of nights to use our pool.  Then her pastor came too (he comes many nights a week).  She always guilts me about not spending all my free time with them when they pop up routinely.  She called me over to eat some food with them.  I did, but then kept kept kept bugging me to swim with our son.  I really felt shitty and didn't want to.  I walked him around in the stroller for a while (he was tired, almost sleeping) but felt nauseous.  Eventually I told her, look I tried to communicate I was too sick to walk the dogs, but did anyway.  I'm going home (when requesting again to watch our son so she can have more fun, and to swim).    Ended up going to bed at 830.    She never understands or hears what I try to communicate about how I feel.  Even today I feel a bit of the brain fog and a little worse than usual.  She argued this morning about when I went to bed, asserting it was after she got back after 10pm..  No, it wasn't.  She still kind of argued about how I felt or what I was up to last night..  It's ridiculous.  I feel like I don't even need her support.  Like I can handle this shit, but I need her to get out of my way and just let me take care myself at least.    I still need to work on being more assertive.  I do and am, but sometimes I question myself on just what I can do or am up to doing.  I mean, I don't want to lay down all the time or not walk my dogs or play with my son... I like doing those things.  Sometimes I just feel really shitty though.  Thank you again friend.  I also appreciate your sentiments on taking care of myself and prioritizing what I need and what I feel will help me most in the long run.  Depending on how the next six months to year go, what the doctors can do to help or offer.. I might find myself taking my needs into my own hands again.  It honestly seemed to help immensely.  It really helped with the 'brain fog' and neck mobility (I could honestly feel helping in my back wrist and ankle even).  I'd prefer to do everything 100% as best I can, by the book, professional, give them every opportunity to help me as best they can.  I didn't want to take oxy's, prednisone, and immune system shut-down meds for the rest of my life, I'll still try, but I am fearful for the distant future.  In the past I was extremely disheartened when the specialists led to nowhere and nothing that helped..  then that I had to suggest what the real issues were and make him send me where it turns out I needed to go.  I started this journey FOUR years ago with them and am only now starting to get doctors to look at the real issues or take me serious.  Meh, I'm hopeful.  I've got you great folks supporting me, understanding, and validating my emotional and relational struggles.  I'm firm in my belief that I am my greatest health advocate, that I am the one responsible for that- not my doctors.  I need to keep pushing them to help and keep my long-term health in mind.  If need be I'll switch to a specialist in another county (we only had one of these).  If nothing helps, maybe I'll move to where I can legally use what helps (I'm just reticent because I really like being near my family and like it here).

I told him when he got home from work that I wasn't OK with the things he said during his episode last night.  I told him that he seems to me to be unhappy,  angry and dissatisfied.  That it's not fair to me to hold me responsible for making him feel good about himself.  That I don't know what he needs to do, but that he has to get right with himself and I can't do it for him. He was surprisingly calm and told me that he knows what his problem is and he needs more affection and attention than I give him. He said I was inconsistent and that he needs someone that will give him constant affection and attention.  I told him it seems inconsistent because of his roller coaster moods and he told me he had the roller coaster moods because of my lack of consistency.  I told him I can't help him and that I was leaving.  I told him that if I were him I would go to therapy. He told me that he just wants to do what ever makes me happy and if leaving him made me happy than he was OK with it. I left.  The phone calls started within an hour. Berating me and rehashing. I told him that I had a headache and that I would meet in person tomorrow to discuss.  My suspicion is that he is itching to start seeing other people because what he wants is to be in the infatuation stage of a relationship.  I know that the manipulation and drama is still to come.  For now I am sleeping on a cot in the tiny living room of my Mother's house. I will just take steps forward one day at a time to get a job and a place.  Oh, I forgot to add that he is a substance abuser and  it's possible he will go on a bender. Thanks again for you kind support."

Sometimes it takes years before they start making progress, even if they want to. Sometimes they just use it as a bargaining chip. Remember, BPDs reality changes according to their emotions, and so does their approach to therapy.  This is why you must focus your plans on concrete actions, that even if they don't end up doing what they say they will, you know what to do, and have consequences."
BPDlovedones,3bpph0,katieroseclown,3,Wed Jul 1 07:43:48 2015 UTC,Good advice. It's so true that BPD's reality changes according to their emotions. And that also means trying to reassure them with facts is kinda like fighting fire with oranges. It just doesn't matter sometimes.

BPDlovedones,3bpph0,always_awake9,2,Wed Jul 1 19:06:01 2015 UTC,"Giant hugs to you.  I've read a lot from you and I feel we share a lot of the same stories about our SOs.  I'm so sorry this is going to be rough on you financially, but please don't let that stop you from making a plan and making a break.  That was what stopped me for a long time. It might be rough at first, but ultimately you will be so much better off.  You deserve so much better.  You deserve someone that will love and support you, not treat you like a whipping boy at his whim. Please lean on us for support whenever you need it.  We're here for you!!!"

My ex used that one to keep us going for another few months.   During a fight it slipped out of her mouth: ""I just said i would go to therapy so you would shut up about it!"".   ;))))"
BPDlovedones,3bpph0,cookieredittor,3,Wed Jul 1 12:40:12 2015 UTC,"My wife promised for 3 years she would go to therapy. Sometimes she would say she forgot, sometimes she came up with excuses about the logistics of it, sometimes she said she forgot, or even denied she agreed to get therapy. Finally, she did go to therapy for a year. She improved in some areas.  times she would come home angry about how she would rage quit therapy because the therapist asked her difficult questions. She couldn't explain what was wrong about the questions.   In the end, therapy ended, and she relapsed, and even got worse. We are separating now, and she says that she hates me because I made her go to therapy as if she had a clinical problem, when the problem in this relationship is clearly me because i made her feel all those bad feelings."
BPDlovedones,3bpph0,Tanglible_Dream,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"Mine finally went to therapy after we broke up for good. On one hand i suspect it was to re-assure her new boyfriend that in fact her ex (me) was the crazy one, and on the other hand, to make it look like there's nothing wrong with her (to convince herself). In the end she had the nerve to call me and tell me she's going to therapy to fix the damage i left her with, and also how the therapist laughed and said to her: ""Your ex is clearly crazy, of course you don't have to show him proof of the pregnancy!"" (as it turned out later the pregnancy was really a lie).   I think she would have done anything for self validation. That includes going to therapy simply to have a ""professional"" approve of her made up reality and therefor ""make it real"". How could she go on living with herself otherwise?   It's all really fucked up to be honest."
BPDlovedones,3bpph0,cookieredittor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:29:15 2015 UTC,"First of all, it doesn't matter what her therapist says about you. Her therapist is for her issues. The therapist has to validate her. Besides, she can claim the therapist said whatever she wants, it is irrelevant. What matter is that by bringing up this crazy stuff (like the fake pregnancy) her therapist is noticing the real issues in her.  Remember, if she has BPD, and her therapist knows it, the therapist was to take it very very very easy as to not make the BPD feel invalidated, because otherwise the BPD will just rage quit therapy. So don't worry about what she claims her therapist says about you, it is irrelevant, and just fits her emotional reality, and has nothing to do with you. She is telling you all those things as personal attacks."

BPDlovedones,3bpph0,cecirdr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:29:23 2015 UTC,"Sending you as many good vibes as I can.   I hope he goes in for treatment, but leaving (at least for the moment) is probably for the best. I was only in my relationship for 10 months and while my psyche felt better almost immediately because I was no longer being harassed, it took me months to really feel like I was no longer damaged."
BPDlovedones,3bpph0,way2manycooks,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:15:25 2015 UTC,"You are in my thoughts! I am in a very similar predicament right now, as you know. Take it slow, take it one day at a time, remember to breath, and take time to take care of yourself.   If you haven't already spoken with him, try to remember to validate him when you can, stand by your boundaries, and remove yourself if things get ugly and the conversation stops being productive. I know you'll do just fine because you're a strong willed person who does not tolerate bullshit.   Best of luck and many virtual hugs and positive thoughts!!"
BPDlovedones,3bp025,VeryCrimson,7,Tue Jun 30 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"IMO, kids are the only good reason for a non- to stay in a relationship with someone with BPD.   Why would you love someone with all your heart and literally give them your life, when they would most likely never love you the way you love them?   It takes a very strong person to be in a relationship like that, especially when treatment can take years. If you can be strong, set boundaries, take care of yourself, and basically be independent enough to do things that make you happy without allowing your self esteem to be decimated by your SO during their treatment, then hat's off to you. I am not that kind of person nor will I ever want to be because I will never date another man with BPD."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,Cranberry_Lips,2,Wed Jul 1 01:48:15 2015 UTC,"IMO, kids are the only good reason for a non- to stay in a relationship with someone with BPD.   Honestly, I feel the opposite.  My wife may think I stay for our son, but in truth he was one of the strongest motivators to no longer accept abuse and move from codependency (to focus on your last paragraph), well knowing it could easily mean the end of our marriage.  Still, I watch him like the canary in the mineshaft.  Even if things aren't so bad I 'have' to leave for me, I don't want him to grow up in an emotionally unhealthy home; to believe abuse, neglect, or 'earning' attention and affection are healthy.  My wife may think I stay for my son, but if I ever leave he will likely be the strongest reason why."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,Shanguerrilla,3,Wed Jul 1 14:39:52 2015 UTC,"As a kid from a home where mom had uBPD and dad stayed, it's a vastly complicated issue. I will say that I feel strongly if you model acceptance of abuse (I'm not assuming that you do), your child will accept abuse, from that parent and in their future relationships."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,3RBN6349,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for commenting!    I really agree and I need to keep being reminded of this, that is my goal and motivation.  My wife thinks I stay for him, in truth I look toward him to see if I need to leave.  I very much don't wish to show him codependency is healthy or that unacceptable behavior is acceptable.  I'm changing dynamics in my home for 'me', but I'd be lying if I didn't say most my strength comes from/for my son."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,Shanguerrilla,3,Fri Jul 3 20:22:06 2015 UTC,"Of course, do it for yourself as well. :)  Another observation, I would often not tell dad about mom's actions or behaviors because ""what's the use? They'll fight, I'll feel bad that she yelled at him because I 'told on her,' and it'll be more chaotic all night. I just put up with all afternoon of this, I don't want to listen to them fight all night too.""   I went to him when it was so bad that I couldn't handle it on my own. I wish now that I could have taken absolutely everything to him, and he would have disallowed it, or we would have fought it together. I wish I had been taught how to put up boundaries for myself. I wish I had been told more often and emphatically ""you come to me, no matter what, with everything. Mom isn't allowed to call you names or yell at you. Ever. You come to me."" (I did get this sometimes, it's what got me through with my sanity, I think.)"
BPDlovedones,3bp025,3RBN6349,3,Fri Jul 3 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"Man, this is golden.  I hope I can nurture that kind of relationship with my son.  He's still an infant, but inside or outside this house I want him to understand that so long as he is honest with me- I'll have his back through any hell.  This post kind of made my eyes well when I read it.  My dad wasn't quuuuite like that, but close.  He usually would tell my mother anything, but aside from that he always had my back and a couple times he did side with me or keep a secret from her.    None of that really explains what I mean, but what you described is exactly what I want to have with my son.  I want him to never be afraid of what I can handle, to never question coming to me.  I want to exemplify and teach him healthy boundaries and to respect himself.   These issues are muddled.  I DO believe that marriage is the highest earthly covenant, BUT that doesn't extend to what is not right or unhealthy.  As much as I am for equality between genders in most senses, I do believe that a good man should be and is the head of the house.  Everyone in my home is my responsibility.  My son is the least capable of taking care of himself and the one that most assuredly needs to be able to come to me.  I don't know, I'm rambling and can't really make the point you reminded me of, but I absolutely appreciate your post, that is the very thing I desire growing in the way you lament and wish it could have been, I'm very sorry you didn't have that and I will do my best not to fail my son in that way.  I feel the guidelines are blurry on how to get there, but I hope my best is good enough.  If I can't make it happen and he or I am being abused and not able to create healthy boundaries, then he likely won't have parents that are still married and he will have at least one safe home."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,Shanguerrilla,3,Sat Jul 4 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"My parents weren't able to maintain a healthy ""we are the parents"" front, since my mom acted like a child. The thing is, ideally, you'd want to support your wife, and you'd discuss parenting things together. But, ideally, your wife wouldn't curse and scream at your son. So if that happens, you may have to choose not to support that behavior.   He did try to convince us that it's not about us, her bad behavior is about her, but to be honest, as a kid, I still thought it was my fault. There just wasn't enough positive reinforcement to outweigh the bad.   I'm doing great now, thanks. :) And your son will be ok. Just you knowing about her illness and being ready and educated is miles ahead of where we were. This is a good thing you're doing."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,3RBN6349,3,Sat Jul 4 06:54:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  It wasn't until I had my son that I realized that I needed to make a serious plan to get out of my marriage to my BPDSO.  My husband has no issues with committing verbal, emotional and physical (not hitting me, but throwing and breaking things) abuse in front of my son.  Whereas I have the intellectual capacity to realize his actions are ridiculous, my son has no idea why daddy is behaving like this. I can't risk my son learning that this kind of behavior is acceptable to commit or receive."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,always_awake9,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, it really impressed on me how much I let things go too far.  I was ignoring and not being 'hurt' by somethings I shouldn't have ignored or not been hurt by.  I can't let her be so critical and aggressive/disrespectful in front of our godson and son.  I mean, I can't at all anymore, but I let it go on for way too long.  I kept playing that lose/lose game before I would remove myself from her tests altogether.    Hopefully, through strong boundaries, continuing the direction we are moving.. I won't have to leave.  But I can handle or 'put up' with a lot more than I'm willing to let my son have to.  My wife is a pretty good mom, that doesn't mean I can let my son grow up in an unhealthy home though.    That was my strongest motivation for attacking self-change as hard as I can this year.  I feel like before he is two we really need to be in an even better place (....then before he's three ad infinitum).  He's one now and things have changed and improved a ton since he was a newborn.  I realize that much of the mother/child relationship indicators occur when the child is very young, but I HOPE we haven't harmed our son and that I would leave before we do.  I believe we can make it work without separation, but that really is outside my control.  For now, things are okay and we're moving in the right direction."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,Shanguerrilla,12,Sat Jul 4 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"BPDs aren't always pure monsters. There are a lot of factors that compound why someone develops this PD.   There are plenty of cons when it comes to being in a relationship with someone with BPD, but there are also many pros. My SO is extremely intelligent. He's hilarious. He's attractive. He loves animals. He's taught me a lot about life, appreciating how delicate it is and quickly it can be lost. He's a traumatized little boy who was conditioned by his family and his genetics to posses some of the less than desirable qualities anyone would ever ask for in a loved one. I don't hold that against him.   That's not to say there aren't some pretty evil individuals out there that fit the criteria for BPD. It's just to say that not everyone that is afflicted with this disorder is 100% bad. I've learned a lot about myself that I probably wouldn't have discovered if I was with anyone else. For that, I'm grateful. Even if this relationship ended tomorrow."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,way2manycooks,5,Wed Jul 1 02:40:58 2015 UTC,"I went through three stages answering this question and I've never let it stray far from my mind.    At first, I felt like I stayed for me- because I was glutton for punishment, sins of my past and all of that.    Then, after beginning to open my eyes wider to the abuse, I believed I was staying for her- she needs me, delusions that she will change, she loves me like I do her beneath the behavior and words, but she is just sick..    Now, again I stay for me- I stay because I love her.  I don't deserve to be abused and I won't allow it, but battle scars and all, I still love her.    We won't ever have the perfect marriage, but that's okay because no one does.  I could have an easier life, but I'm not one to quit because something hurts or is hard.  It is worth it to me, for me.  If I am incapable of taking care of my own needs or remaining emotionally healthy- then we will need to divorce.  If she ever desires leaving me or blackmailing me about leaving again- then we will get divorce.  For now, I focus on me and I try to be a better man.  Contrary to her antagonism and obstructionism, she has even been helping me to accomplish that.    In total honesty, I often do wonder how long I can perpetually stay, but I get weaker before recharging and recouping.  Some times are harder than others, but we can get a stronger baseline.    There are always new obstacles, but there are also always new heights we can reach.  In total honesty, we are closer than really ever in our marriage now.  She respects and understands me better.  I like myself more.    You have to remember that even a beautiful rose can grow from and be well nurtured in a pile of shit."

BPDlovedones,3bp025,PullingTulip,2,Wed Jul 1 08:17:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for posting this. You give me a lot of hope for my current relationship.
BPDlovedones,3bp025,ThisBorderlineLife,3,Sat Jul 4 02:58:00 2015 UTC,"That's nice, thanks!    As odd as it would seem to some, since we all rather gather bits and pieces we choose..  This sub and even /r/BPD have tremendously helped me, my life, and given me that same hope for my marriage.  What you need to remember is that the hope you feel, now or ever, isn't misplaced.  You don't have to hope for something impossible, something ideal, or something intangible.  On either side of these relationships we only have to do the same thing, be accountable for ourselves, not make ourselves responsible for the others' emotions, focus on our input rather than the outcomes we can't control (I liken this to outcome independence), and work towards being a little better each day.   Regardless of where you are in life or the relationship, which side or what obstacles- you CAN have a good and fulfilling life with people you love.  You WILL smile again no matter how depressing things seem today.  I promise!"
BPDlovedones,3bp025,Shanguerrilla,2,Sat Jul 4 04:54:23 2015 UTC,"You are so awesome. Thank you for your response, I truly appreciate it.  Also, thank you for understanding that BPD doesn't automatically make someone an awful person. Your wife is extremely lucky to have found someone like you."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,ThisBorderlineLife,3,Sat Jul 4 12:29:53 2015 UTC,"The only reason to stay is if you can be strong enough to enforce healthy dynamics. This has limits, as some stuff is out of your control. But if you stay and you can't enforce this, then, you are probably enabling, walking on eggshells, and making things worse for everyone.  Staying hoping the other person changes is giving them all the power in the dynamics.   Staying hoping for a miracle is giving up your responsibility in the relationship.  Leaving because you understand you can't enforce good dynamics IS a very strong and brave thing to do. Staying enforcing good dynamics is also a very strong and brave thing to do. However, always remind yourself, you only have control over yourself, never over the other person, so have realistic expectations about what you can change in the relationship."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,cookieredittor,3,Wed Jul 1 07:47:02 2015 UTC,"She's the love of my life. ""In sickness"" is one of the things I swore to. I don't take that lightly. Fiddle through my link history if you want to get an idea of our story. Would you break contact with your SO if they had cancer? I love my wife, and I have a duty to care for her.   I understand NC in more severe cases. There are times when you have to protect yourself. I feel like so many here just throw in the towel, because they don't want to deal."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,imgoingalittlenuts2,2,Sat Jul 4 09:13:46 2015 UTC,"My sister is BPD. I used to love hanging around her, despite the drama, we used to really connect. I really liked her.  Now we don't have a relationship, her decision. The BPD just seemed to take her away. I miss her."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,katieroseclown,0,Wed Jul 1 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"Really? I feel like people separate the condition and the person too much. A BPD individual consists of hot and cold, both the best and worst parts of themselves.   You can't stigmatize the BPD alone as the 'bad' part because there is no bad part, the whole thing is a system that works because it intensely contrasts the unrealistic highs with the hellish lows. The BPD doesn't do anything beyond your sistee's agency, the BPD IS your sister."
BPDlovedones,3bp025,katieroseclown,2,Wed Jul 1 17:16:59 2015 UTC,"The BPD is controlling my sister at this point. She is not controlling herself.  I am a recovering BPD. I get it. I used to feel those raw emotions daily, act completely irrational, push/pull, black/white, all that. It was hell on me, it was hell on those around me. It was so tough. I have lived with this for years and years, I am in my late 40's.  For years I worked hard to get better. I still struggle. But I am much happier. I can have a conversation with someone where they make a slight comment that offends me slightly, or I disagree with. I don't blow up, it's fine, we move on, we function. I have a long-term relationship, a family, a job, I'm active in my community. I am in control of my feelings and actions and reactions, IT'S WONDERFUL!  My sister on the other hand is worse, way worse. You cannot say or do anything right in her eyes. I know underneath she is a loving, caring, smart person. But all she can do at this point is complain, spout insecurities, alienate people, point fingers. That is NOT my sister, believe me, I have known her for years. Underneath she has a heart of gold."

BPDlovedones,3bon8h,SRPayne,4,Tue Jun 30 22:07:23 2015 UTC,"This advice won't work for everybody, but sometimes getting angry is what makes NC a lot easier. It's hard not to cave in to somebody that you care about, especially when your mind drifts back to when you were happy together. Reminding yourself of why you left can keep you strong until your get yourself back on your feet.. and you will!"
BPDlovedones,3bon8h,avro_lanc,3,Wed Jul 1 00:18:20 2015 UTC,Thank you!   :) I noticed when I got angry it's easier for me to stick to the NC rule. I hope she's doing OK. But then again my mental health and sanity is more important to me.
BPDlovedones,3bon8h,fitz999,2,Wed Jul 1 01:20:45 2015 UTC,"I stopped speaking to my BPD sister a few weeks ago.  I felt bad about it because I know she can't help it and her fragility seems so extreme, but at the same time, she's eternally miserable and extremely combative, rude, and abusive.  She is very much of the mind that she is fine and it's the rest of the world that is cruel so I doubt she'll ever get help.  Since she figured out I don't want to talk to her she now hates me for abandoning her, so she stopped contacting me.  It's wonderful.  The peace is amazing.  Since she's been out of it I've realized she was the worst part of my life.  I barely have anything to talk about in therapy now!"
BPDlovedones,3bon8h,way2manycooks,2,Wed Jul 1 18:16:45 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, the peace really is fucking amazing. I don't have to watch what I say around anyone anymore. I'm not depressed.  It's all together great. I have my moments where I feel bad about leaving, but that's OK, because my mental health is a lot more important."
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,SoTiredToday,8,Tue Jun 30 15:10:34 2015 UTC,Why does this bother me so much?   Because you aren't totally convinced it was just a kiss?
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,bdpgirlfriend,3,Tue Jun 30 15:26:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe, honestly I really think it was. In the end it is a pretty dumb thing to think about.  Maybe it's just because the relationship as a whole isn't easy so I am just fixating on it"
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,bdpgirlfriend,6,Tue Jun 30 15:40:36 2015 UTC,"Does she know it bothers you? Sounds like you might be keeping in your feelings about it. Was she grilling you about if you were always faithful or not? And she admits she kissed an old flame once and you are expected to not ""overreact"" because she would go nuclear otherwise?   It's okay to be bothered by the kiss. Your wife kissed an old boyfriend at a time when you two were having trouble. I think a rational person would think that is okay to be a little angry over."
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,1978_anon_guy,2,Tue Jun 30 15:48:47 2015 UTC,She is supportive about it.  So maybe I just need a bit of time.
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,way2manycooks,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:51:22 2015 UTC,That! There. Hit the nail on the head.
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,Churn,7,Wed Jul 1 20:44:19 2015 UTC,You are justifiably feeling bothered. She's kept this secret from you all these years. She stripped you of the opportunity to decide if you wanted to remain in a relationship with someone that was unfaithful. I hope you recognize there's nothing wrong with you for feeling bothered. The trust that you built over the last 7 years has just been called into question.  I'm sorry I don't have advice to offer but I sure feel for you. Sending vibes of positivity your way.
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,Churn,5,Tue Jun 30 19:04:46 2015 UTC,"Holy shit you are friggin right.  This just made me realize why I am upset.  If in the very beginning of this relationship 15 years ago I had found out she had kissed someone else I would have left.  I would never have continued this relationship, I would have avoided all of the emotional baggage I have now.  Yes I would have missed all of the good times, also I of course love my kids, and I do love her.  I think I just wonder how much different my life would have been.  Thank you for helping me realize this.  Obviously I cannot ever tell her this, it would destroy someone especially someone I have no intention to leave.  But still thank you"
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,Churn,4,Tue Jun 30 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"Why does this bother me so much?  She said nothing happened and I believe her.   You trusted her and it turns out she lied.  Now she's telling you it was just a kiss.  To believe her, you have to trust her again this time knowing that she broke that trust before.  Trust is much harder to gain once it's been violated."
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,Thingsiponder,4,Tue Jun 30 16:46:14 2015 UTC,"I think my issue is this, being in a relationship with someone with BPD is no cake walk, and even a minor violation of trust by her no matter how long ago is bothersome, especially when I have been faithful through all of the crazy ups and down for 15 years"
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,Churn,3,Tue Jun 30 19:10:03 2015 UTC,"being in a relationship with someone with BPD is no cake walk   So true.  To make matters worse, because of their ""splitting"" they see everyone as either ALL bad or ALL good, so they cannot admit to even the tiniest fault or they have to ""switch"" themselves to the ALL bad category.  For a BPD to admit wrong-doing is like death to them.  I'm pretty sure that even though she came clean about the ""kiss"", she has managed to justify it in her own mind so that there was nothing wrong with what she did.  Further, if she did do more with her ex, then I'm sure she either tells herself it was at a time when your relationship was somehow on ""hold"" or that it was your fault that she had to go outside her marriage.  BPD logic only works for them, nobody else is allowed to use it."
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,Thingsiponder,3,Tue Jun 30 19:15:14 2015 UTC,"Totally, her logic to justify it is that it was before we were married.  The reason why I always had some questions about it in my mind over the years was because she would say stuff like, ""I have always kept our marriage sacred"".  It was like the word ""marriage"" was a qualifier.  Which in her mind let her say things without her being a liar.  But I almost giggle that she thought that I am that dumb to never have noticed that qualifier.  I chose to just ignore it.  In some ways it was a comfort since it made me think.  ""If it is that important of a qualifier to her, at least I can believe she is telling the truth."" Which sometimes in other areas it can be difficult."
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,Churn,4,Tue Jun 30 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"One thing I know for certain, a borderline can not be trusted, period.  They live from one moment to the next in a world of emotions and feelings, they don't process events or facts the way we do.  Truth, reality, history, whether someone is good or bad, these are all fluid things for a borderline with nothing set in concrete.  Everything she knows at one moment can change in the next based on her emotions or how she feels about something.  For example, last valentines day, you bought her those roses, a card, and surprised her with them at her favorite restaurant.  In our world these are facts.   But to her, they are simply actions that are used as support for how she feels about you at the moment.  If she 'splits' you into the 'good' category where you can do no wrong, then she sees what you did as support for her view that you are a wonderful husband.  The very next day however, she may 'split' you into the 'bad' category where you are incapable of doing anything right or good.  She may tell you that you've never done a thoughtful thing for her in your life that you only think of yourself.  So you reply by reminding her of Valentines day and that dinner.  She'll remember it but now sees it as ""you half-assed valentines day with a petty dinner and flowers.  It's so obvious you were trying to make up for what a shitty husband you know you are. It's so obvious, everyone sees how fake you are.""  So what's the truth?  To you or me, the truth is what happened.  To her, the truth changes depending on how she feels at the moment."
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,Thingsiponder,3,Tue Jun 30 19:52:56 2015 UTC,"Wow.  As a borderline I immediately wanted to refute everything you just wrote, and I typed several paragraphs over and over, defending us from this obvious exaggeration.  And then reread what you wrote a few times, and you know what?  You are totally correct.  Holy shit, we are just like that.  Damn."
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,cookieredittor,3,Tue Jun 30 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be in this sub if you suffer from BPD.  There will be too many triggers for you and it won't be healthy or productive for anyone.   This sub was created after too many people with BPD started arguing with what we said in the /r/BPDSOFFA sub which was originally for those of us who've had close inter-personal relationships with someone with BPD.  We came here to speak freely, without worrying about triggering a BPD response from someone."
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,Tastygroove,0,Wed Jul 1 12:48:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks but I'm fine.  I'm not the kind of person to ""trigger."" I'm very high functioning, and I am interested in seeing the ways people react/to live/with those of us who have Bpd.  It helps me see my wife's perspective when I see the ways other people deal with this also."
BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,DreadlordCherryCake,3,Wed Jul 1 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but I'm admittedly very jaded after trying EVERYTHING for 15 years only to have my exbpdso very literally try to destroy me in every way possible during the divorce then after failing, attempt suicide by slashing her wrists and sending pictures of it to our then 15 year old son, telling him that he made her do it because he chose to live with only with me when it was her crazy rule that he had to choose one of us and not ever see the other (no back and forth on weekends etc).  The lawyers were not making this stipulation, nor the judge, just her in her rages at our son.  As was typical, she would setup a ""no win"" scenario, then play the victim.  She caused every issue, every problem, and never accepted responsibility for anything she did.  After she threatened to kill her sister, me, and then herself with a 45 caliber gun which she later fired at her grown daughter's family (daughter, son-in-law, two grandkids under 8 yrs old) because they would not get off her property fast enough when she decided her feelings were hurt, well what can you say after all of that?  So no Thingsiponder, I hope you get the help you need for your disorder, I really do, but I have no space in my head, heart, or life for anyone with BPD, keep that shit away from me.  And again, I say, you should not be in this thread, you won't like what you hear in here.  Not from me for sure.   It helps me see my wife's perspective when I see the ways other people deal with this also.   As for your seemingly benign reasons for being here.  That won't help you or your wife one bit, you may come here with good intentions (which I doubt) but anything you learn, you won't be able to stop yourself from using to further manipulate your wife.  You don't need to be here, you need to focus on therapy and treatments that will really help you and thereby help your marriage.  So go do that, don't waste time perusing through the stories of us BPD victims as if there's anything at all in our stories that will improve your life, there's not.  Here there is just pain and suffering, and people looking for answers that don't really come, but at least there are others here who have been through nearly the same sort of hell that only another victim of a BPD can understand.  Did I say, get out?  GET OUT."

BPDlovedones,3bn0oj,RudolphRed,3,Wed Jul 1 02:54:13 2015 UTC,"It'd be one thing if she did this 15 years ago and it was with a guy she never spoke to again. But this was someone that was clearly a form of emotional support long after that point. I would be curious as well as to what her relationship is with this man NOW. I don't doubt that she was faithful physically but there's some kind of wonky emotional tie there that she has either let go of or hasn't... and if she hasn't? Time to air it all out. You don't have to be confrontational, but you CAN be honest about what you are feeling and your concerns. I would want to know where she stood on the subject of him now. Like, WHY bring it up? Regardless of inebriation or not, this is old news. Why discuss it now? Was she trying to clear her conscience? Or was she trying to gauge your reaction because she felt like you were being unfaithful? This is crazy. I say get honest, and risk her overreacting but you don't have to. Just be calm and honest and see where she's really at."
BPDlovedones,3biy2x,djn24,8,Mon Jun 29 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, you can't really help her. People with bpd really really don't take well to being told others suspect they have it. If she ever gets help in her life it needs to be her idea. I would just keep no contact."

I'm single because I was turning into someone I wasn't, because of her, and I was not OK with that. I'm single again because I couldn't take the constant roller coaster ride day in and day out, I was going crazy myself. I'm single again because at the end she had started another relationship 6 months before she kicked me out of her house.  I'm grateful this all had happened tho, it really woke me up.

It is possible between very mature people with clear boundaries and respect for those  This might be expecting more than someone with BPD can do. If they can't understand the new relationship and how to respect your boundaries, they will test over and over. It will fall solely on you to act to defend those boundaries. The key is consistency. This might also mean that as you redefine the relationship, you err on the side of more distance. It often means very little contact."
BPDlovedones,3biy2x,dinosaurs_r_awesome,4,Tue Jun 30 11:03:17 2015 UTC,"It's unusual for the BPD to be the one initiating No Contact (deleting you from social media).  I suspect there is more to that than what it sounds.  Have you been trying to contact her?  She may be doing that just because she knows how you will respond.  A person with BPD is an expert manipulator if nothing else, and the longer they are in a relationship with someone, the better they get at manipulating in the most arcane ways.  Usually what we see are attempts to suck you back into their chaotic world (Hoovering).  In my opinion, the more you learn about BPD, the more you will come to realize how lucky you are to be out of that relationship.  Check the ""other resources"" links on the right of this sub.  Feel free to ask any specific questions you have or share specific interactions that stand out most about your relationship and I'm sure people here will give you their insight and experience."

She took this pretty harshly and told me that she felt abandoned and that I was unrelaible. My therapist said my decision to take time off from an abusive situation is perfectly fine, and that I shouldn't have to feel bad for this decision. She would never reach out to me in these times, which at first surprised/disappointed me. Finally, I stuck around during a particularly abusive situation, and she pushed me to the point where I said things I wish I never said (mostly that I didn't know how I felt about her and the relationship anymore). When I apologized a couple of days later, she told me that I was roping her back in, and she disliked that I push and pull her. From my perspective, I retreated when she hurt me, and always had to be the one to initiate a return. Maybe she intentionally held off to make me apologize for taking a break, instead of her apologizing for what she said?  I think she removed me from social media either by advice of a friend/relative, or, as one of my friends suggested, to lure me in to contacting her about it?"

BPDlovedones,3bj9tt,fitz999,7,Mon Jun 29 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"She really wants a relationship with me but she actually wants one with her idealized vision of a brother, not with who I am   BPs are 100% ideological when it comes to interpersonal relationships. Because of their emotional dysregulation, YOU have to be the person that fits into THEIR mood at that specific time. I can't tell you how many times my uBPD STBX said something along the lines of ""I think another man would know me better"" when I would say that her behavior was confusing and inconsistent.   The problem is that THEY don't know themselves, and on any given day, their emotional map could be totally different than the previous day. Their lives are governed by what I'll call ""forgetful solipsism"", in which the only thing that matters is their current emotional state, and returning to a state of emotional regulation cannot be based on any previous thoughts, actions, feelings, or facts.    Ultimately, I don't know if I should do anything. It's been wonderful not having her in my life, not having to constantly worry when she's going to turn and have an episode.   For now, don't. Love takes many forms, and understanding the lack of control that we non-BPs have over the situation will help you to feel better about your choice to remain distanced. Don't allow your familial bond to trick you into thinking that there is something that you could say/do to change anything. There IS a very successful therapy (DBT) that BPs can go through to help themselves, but it is intensive and requires tremendous willingness to accept that they have it.   Continue your own therapy, and learn more about BPD before you speak with her again. Read the sidebar, the WHOLE sidebar. Read about DBT and why it works for them. For everything else, post here. I've only been here for a few months, but this group has really changed the way I am approaching the end of my relationship with my SO, and helped me gain a great deal of acceptance."

You will go through a phase where you beat yourself up for ""not having recognized this sooner"", but that will end. The more you know about BPD, the more that you will realize that there is no way you could have known. I was shocked to find out that BPD is TWICE as common as Bipolar, yet everyone knows what Bipolar is, and nobody has ever heard of BPD.   Everyone has had that thought ""if I could only go back with the knowledge I have now"". We can't do that, but we can do the second best thing, which is to go forward with the knowledge we have now. In just 15 minutes, you are already more well equipped and have a better understanding of why certain things have happened to you, so imagine when you are done reading all the books and articles! Even your therapy sessions are going to become more meaningful now that you know a little more.  Keep us updated on your journey.

If they are suicidal, and you decide not to call and do something else, your gambling with their lives by thinking you have the tools to heal them. But you don't. It isn't your job to do this, it is the job of professionals. Even if the person with BPD say they don't want professionals, if their threaten their lives or those of others, it is your responsibility to call professionals before something bad happens.

Any tips?   Here are my two cents. What is happening when he talks about suicide, is that one part of him does want to die, while the other - does not. If he only wanted to die, and not to get help and live on - he would not be talking. So, validation here is a two-way thing. Tell that you appreciate how hard and painful life must be for him to want to die. Tell that you also appreciate the desire in him to stay alive, which is reflected in him telling you about the problem. State that you are willing to support him - the part that wants to live, that is.   He's expressed opinions that if anyone calls 911 on him that it's ""putting problems on someone else"" and that he should just commit suicide right then or when he gets out. He sees it as futile and expensive and burdening other people when his loved ones should be able to help.   Honestly, WTF?  This is beyond manipulation! This is clear dictatorship. I don't now, it seems that you ought to be indignant about such demands. Loved ones are slaves to be treated like dirt, while people from emergency services, oh, their time and feelings are to be spared at all cost.   He is already putting problems on you, by making you play a no-win game. As I said above, he has contradictory desires, to die and to live, and he pushes this contradiction on you. Whichever part you choose, in his eyes you will be a traitor to the other part. So, the only way is to confront him with this contradiction. And try to support and cooperate with the willing-to-live part. Further then that, I do not know how to help.   Only ""protecting"" him from 911 and absorbing the blows is not good for anybody, neither for you, nor for him. Wish you the best of luck!"

That roller coaster was always headed to the place he landed that day. There's no telling how many times in those years you inadvertently stayed this inevitability. You probably saved his life the day he met you.   It's ok to love him. It's ok to forgive yourself for Hating him. The guilt of feeling... The weight of his burdon release you in his passing. It's ok to feel free.  His intensity... Bright white and darkest darks... Such contrast leaves a lasting impression burned in and hard to forget but it can  fade slowly over time.

BPDlovedones,3bh4d5,way2manycooks,6,Tue Jun 30 03:38:54 2015 UTC,"In my three years with him I went from a stable, reasonable, independent person to a shell of a human being, questioning my sanity and self-worth, with nothing left to give.   Yes, that's how it was for me too, living with my exBPDSO for 15 years.  One of the things that helps me understand her and what I went through is the realization that she is/was not in control of her behavior.  When she switches to Black, she can't control how she sees me or others or the world.  It's just how/who she is because of the disorder.  But also realize that when she switches to White, she's no more in control even though she was amazing when she saw you as the White Knight.  So what I'm trying to say is, if you throw out the really bad extreme ""Black behavior"" of a BPD you also have to throw out the really good equally extreme ""White behavior"" for what it is as well.   Is it insane that despite everything, I know that none of that is really him? That his illness twisted a truly sweet and loving person?    The truth is, that ""truly sweet and loving person"" was not who he really was either.  That person was who he thought you wanted to see.  This is who a BPD becomes during their ""love bombing"" on a new victim.  If that person were real, he'd have a much better chance at defeating his disorder, but the extreme loving character is just the flipside of the extreme hateful character.   The real person is lost somewhere in between, and it happened so long ago when he was so young that the real person never developed into an adult human."

That he suffered so much and didn't know how to control his thoughts, which led to his awful behavior?   Not At All.  Honestly, that IS the truth, but for most people that is nearly impossible to perceive.  For you to, to me it means you knew him, imperfections and all and you loved him anyway.  You weren't perfect, but we can't be and we can't feel guilty not to be.  You didn't have the time needed to amend all the codependence, you surely became that way with 100% dedication to try to do your best FOR him... that doesn't sound so bad.  You would have and could have (and likely since have) changed from that codependency.. even when we do though- that doesn't mean we can save them from themselves.  Breaking codependency means we let our loved ones be responsible for themselves and make their own choices (as do we).  It sounds like you loved someone with everything you had.     I want to still love him, even if I acknowledge the truth of how he was.   It really sounds to me like you achieve that now.  I honestly believe then and now, that means the world to him.

This sounds incredibly difficult, but it sounds like you made the right boundaries at the right time in the right way.    What now? Hold course.  Heal.  Keeping going to therapy, this sounds like an upbringing that many wouldn't find a healthy life through, so keep fighting for that and perhaps over time the ridiculously hurtful and codependent world they tried to force you in will fade and their poison lose some of its sting.  Please don't feel guilty or get hoovered back in.  Lastly, smile- you just made it to the other side of hell.    I wish you the best and appreciate your sharing.  As an SO with a son you do well to remind me of the stakes."
BPDlovedones,3bdkvh,CoDerpendent,4,Sun Jun 28 05:18:50 2015 UTC,"My son is about 5 months older than yours, and I can tell you from experience with my BPD husband, in the next couple of months your little boy will become aware and start absorbing and understanding all of the dysfunction that your wife is creating in the household.    Like you, I have stuck out this marriage through unimaginable situations.  And in some respects, my husband has gotten a little better -- his rages aren't violent anymore.  However, there are still rages, and now that my son is becoming more of a toddler and less of a baby, he has grown increasingly scared of them, and of his father.  Not to mention, as my son has grown older and has started testing boundaries (which is perfectly normal in a toddler's development), it has started becoming a huge trigger for my husband and I already see him splitting my son.  That's when I realized no matter how ""strong"" I am for putting up with this, my son is not and he comes first.  I am not willing to sacrifice my son's future mental health and relationships.    That's when the switched flipped in my head and I went from trying anything to keep my family together to looking out only for the best interest of my son.  I wonder every day if my son has inherited the predisposition for BPD from his father, and it strengthens my resolve to raise him in a normal environment to minimize the chances of it manifesting.    I, too, felt my future looked bleak when I pictured myself as a single mom, raising my son in a broken household.  But the potential of saving my son from a life of having to live in a turbulent environment outweighs that (just read some of the posts from adult children of BPD parents).   If you haven't already, find yourself a new therapist that can help support you, as well as give you the resources you need to file as many complaints as possible against your current therapist.  And love on that little boy of yours as much as you can.  No matter what decisions your wife makes, he has to come first.  I wish you all the strength to get through this shitty situation and get to the other side."
BPDlovedones,3bdkvh,always_awake9,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:51:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I already have a new therapist, who has been appalled at the situation and what this Witch Doctor has done to my family when we could have been in a very different place with the right help for us both.  Notwithstanding the BPD behaviors, my wife is actually a kind, gentle, and thoughtful person most of the time.  Even though she has a hollowness inside, and even though she can be a heartless cast-iron bitch while in the midst of an episode- which were infrequent prior to the last two years- she really is, and wants to be, a good person. Kind of unique around these parts, as I understand it.  We've also both been very careful about what we expose him to in terms of conflict.  She is also an enormously hard worker, and I know that if we can get her to the right help, she will do the work.  If not, then both my son and I are in trouble despite her best intentions."
BPDlovedones,3bdkvh,Tastygroove,2,Sun Jun 28 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"I would say one out of five therapists aren't actually disordered narcissists... 4 put of 5 are nuttier than the patients.   My wife and I are practicing something along the lines of schema therapy because it's all we have... Her last suicide threat that ended up in hospital was also triggered by a ""mental health expert"" (read, certificate holding community college graduate) now we can't even go to that place (the only one in 50 miles.)"
BPDlovedones,3bdkvh,nottoolost,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:24:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry, man. We live in an ""underserved"" area ourselves, and it makes it even tougher to find the right help where there's always a pretty substantial chance that she has some professional connection to the  potential therapist. The fact that she is as high-functioning as she is also makes it hard for people who haven't lived with this as I have to believe what I'm telling them.  Anyway, I think the therapist will be toast after this board complaint, so at least that's something."

He does not have BPD, but the lying and the choices he makes regarding money has had us in therapy for three years.   It is much better, but if your SO has BPD with financial issues from other underlying causes, I would leave too.  It has been excpetionally hard with the trust issues in our marriage.  I not only handle all of the finances with input from him, but I am constantly thinking he is lying about everything.  It is no way to live."

BPDlovedones,3bdskn,MarthaPennywacker,0,Sun Jun 28 14:52:04 2015 UTC,Thanks. The codependents and the downvotes on this sub are really disheartening. Your kind validation really helps. Good vibes vibing back at you!
BPDlovedones,3bdskn,way2manycooks,2,Sun Jun 28 15:11:12 2015 UTC,"Really? You get down votes for talking about leaving? I have to fight the urge to post ""LEAVE! Get out NOW!!"" every time I see someone complaining about a bpd SO. As someone whose mother is ubpd and disabled, so I'm kind of stuck with her, I have a hard time imaging people willingly subjecting themselves to such a partner once they realize the reality of it. I assumed others were the same."

BPDlovedones,3bdskn,cookieredittor,2,Tue Jun 30 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"We are all in different situations with different struggles. We come here as a safe place to run away from the invalidation of BPDs in our lives. Why are you invalidating his feelings?  I respect anyone that wants to leave. This is a hard choice, but often, it is the right choice. However, saying that someone that isn't there yet is insane, or people discussing the love for their SOs is a bad thing is very very invalidating. Why add more black and white thinking? Why add more invalidation? We can all share, and accept we have different struggles, and are at different stages in it, and still, validate each other and respect each other, and share our experiences, even if they are different."
BPDlovedones,3bdskn,cookieredittor,2,Mon Jun 29 08:30:24 2015 UTC,"He is being deceptive and manipulative. Repeatedly. Clearly he then distracts from the problem by derailing it into arguing.

BPDlovedones,3bdskn,cookieredittor,-2,Mon Jun 29 10:54:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this comment.  The other three in the other post repeating themselves was a little much though. It's pretty clear the codependent weirdo that comments on every post is being judgmental, his snide passive aggressive remarks are a symptom of his dysfunctional relationship.   Maybe this sub could use some flair tags. Personally I'm not interested in hearing from codependents. And I'm all about people sharing, he can make his own posts, it's free. If you reply directly to me, I'm going to call out your behavior for what it is. Sounds like the lot of you also have a problem in respecting boundaries."
BPDlovedones,3bdskn,way2manycooks,5,Mon Jun 29 12:48:12 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm not interested in hearing from codependents.   Just ignore the posts that you don't find helpful, but getting angry at others for their own struggles is acting like people with BPD do! We should not do that here. This is a safe space for people that are in difficult relationships. If you disagree with keeping it safe with that in mind, why comment here?"
BPDlovedones,3bdskn,cookieredittor,-3,Mon Jun 29 13:00:07 2015 UTC,I'm not angry. I am angry with my SO which is normal given our circumstances.   So he can post unhelpful and toxic advice all he wants but I'm the one with the problem invalidating him? RIIIIGHT. Nah I think I'll be my usual self and call bullshit like it is.  So is this the part where I tell you your meddling and need-to-fix is unhelpful? Because it is.
BPDlovedones,3bdskn,Kamushika,4,Mon Jun 29 13:03:35 2015 UTC,"This is a support subreddit. You are singling out users to attack them about their struggles because we are supportive.  Why come here to do that? This sub is unmodded, why go take advantage of that?  We see that here regularly, mostly from people with BPD. But you don't have BPD. Why come to a support group to attack its users?"

I am in an intolerant mood. I came here to express myself. Not to be told by anyone that getting angry doesn't solve anything. My anger isn't solving anything but it is driving me get the fuck out. If you or others are interested in being codependent, good luck, but stop trying to drag others into your pits.  This place does need moderation. From toxic people like yourself. I chose this sub over the other 2 specifically ti stay away from people WANTING to struggle and help their partners.  I am not here to help my partner. I don't give a fuck about anyone's wife's sunglasses and how you're happy to be abused just avoid unpleasant feelings.  FUCK. THAT. GET. ANGRY."
BPDlovedones,3bbt5d,Oneofakindthrowawayb,4,Sat Jun 27 18:45:58 2015 UTC,"Well... Lets look at this in parts.    To be 'normal' means that when people share a perspective or 'sense', one can listen to that.  We can hear a perspective that differs from our own and challenge our own perspective.  We can hear logic or sense that is counterintuitive to the emotions we feel or felt- then we can exercise judgement and assess our own accuracy, parse the truth and throw out the one of lesser value.  We can hear logic or points that counter our emotions, and discredit rather than default to our emotional-rule.    Do you realize that this pattern is not (in my experience) followed with a BPD or at least uBPD sufferer?  Well, I can tell you that if you are one to constantly judge yourself, to hear others' perspectives and question your own, while this is healthy- in dealing with a BPD loved one you will be left CONSTANTLY questioning your perspective, memory, and reality.  I am perhaps a little bit obstinate in nature... I'm hard to sway, but I DO constantly question myself at least, well I REALLY understand why 'gaslighting' is an interpersonal relationship trait of BPD relationships.  I freaking feel it man and so did you.  We can't question ourselves to barrages of attacks from here to infinity against an antagonistic partner who is INCAPABLE of this same feat- and never question if we are the ones disordered.  Sometimes, honestly I think I am crazy.  If not by nature than by choice.  So you were in a relationship with a woman that heard freaking voices, yet you are left wondering which of you is disordered because of how well she questioned your motives and perspectives?  That truly resonates with me personally, but laid out objectively in this way it sounds rather ludacris.    Firstly, I don't know the details, but you didn't screw up and gravely sin against her by being friends with an old friend of yours who happened to not have a penis.  That is allowed.  You CAN have friends.  That doesn't justify her getting high and spending the night with competing men, but our judgement there is worthless.  What does have worth is your actions.  You could have made a hard boundary about such behavior.  Your response to that contained all the power.  It wasn't about who was right or wrong, if it was unacceptable to you- then it was.  If that was a deal-breaker, then you could/should have broken your deal with her.  Secondly, yes- the hate then love can be an aspect of BPD, but that is related to splitting.  Idealization then devaluation.. EVEN from seemingly insignificant or imaginary slights.  If a (relatively) normal person had fallen into codependency, they might forgive their SO for things they shouldn't (without creating boundaries).. Well if they are being abused it stands to reason, that when not creating boundaries they will be hurt.  That can and does lead one to feeling negative emotions, even hate.  In codependency they will forgive them when maybe they shouldn't.. back to love.  Being in love with someone who sometimes you hate doesn't mean by default that you are BPD, it might just mean you were in an abusive relationship that you let harm you.  On the abandonment fears- that TOO is another aspect of BPD as you note.  Well, again: codependency.  In codependency, a person is co-dependent.  Quite literally, if a person had no codependency I cannot imagine they would stay through some of the abuse many of us (and seemingly you) did.  We DO have an aspect of aversion to abandonment.  We pretend it is for selfless reasons.  We think to ourselves of how much they need us, how good we are for them, that we could never abandon them...  We think to ourselves, they are just sick, but they can get better!  This isn't ""the real"" them..  You are very insightful because the abandonment, the people pleasing, manipulation, being emotionally driven even.. We share MANY qualities with our BPD SO's when we are unhealthy.  They aren't a different species, it makes sense.  We are just as emotionally disregulated because we cannot regulate THEIR emotions.. We are just as emotionally driven, because we are driven, walking on eggshells around THEIR emotions.  When we are codependent, we are just as much the problem as they are.  In fact, we are MORE of the problem for ourselves than they are.  These things you pointed out were great.  It is incredibly valuable to look toward ourselves and all of our roles.  That IS what we should focus on.  The fact that you felt gaslit though, does not mean you were the one with BPD.  When we are at our worse in codependency we are sharing the disorder by choice.  At that point in time, many of the qualities they have, we share the mirror of.  There is no other way to coexist in relative peace, other than breaking our own codependency (which often leads to separation).  We either get better, grow stronger, learn tools and gain shields of self validation... or we leave or are left.  These are the only three ways I know of that we no longer 'share' their BPD.  Lastly, it is best to lose thoughts of right and wrong / good and bad.  Just look for useful or unuseful.  Healthy or unhealthy.  Productive or unproductive.  I have to get myself past the point of needing to be right and good.  I can NEVER be those things to my wife- not all the time.  I don't need to either.  Honestly, I'm not her martyr.  I can't do everything perfect, I can't be so good that I am unquestionable and I can't cure her.  I CAN be healthy, I can make useful improvements and productive changes to ME.  I can't seem to do a damn thing for her though, but that's okay.  We need to take control over our own lives.  In or out of these relationships.  We don't need to be angry all the time because we don't need to defend ourselves.  We don't need to argue.  We don't need to justify.  We can live our lives.  The lesson to me from your story is the same as mine.  We need to not be people pleasers.  It is useful and productive to question our perspectives, but never to defend them.  I don't need to convert my wife to reality.  That only displayed my weakness and left me on the shaky ground you are contemplating.  I need to be a self judged 'better' man.  More healthy, more independent and interdependent.  Less codependent.  I need to not let her or anyone abuse me again by making productive boundaries.  I need to lead my own life and my own house.  I can't change her, but I can sure as hell change me.  My only chance in this marriage (or out of it) is to lead my own life and be a man I am proud of.  She or anyone else can think what they wish of me.  If I can be that man, then I believe that she just might follow me into a healthier marriage, but I'd still have no control over her choosing to.  That's it though, I can't fix her BPD and to try to only left us both trapped in her hell."
BPDlovedones,3bbt5d,Shanguerrilla,2,Sun Jun 28 04:14:00 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to find out is to examine your past life before this girl and your prior relationships and see if your actions match any BPD signs and behaviors, or take a list to your family and close friends and ask them. If they do, get a professional mental evaluation to get a diagnosis.  Dating someone with BPD can make even the most same person question their sanity.   My personal experience is that it's very very hard, if not impossible to convince someone with BPD that they have a problem, so since you're here willing to be open minded about it, I'm thinking that you're most likely not the one with BPD."
BPDlovedones,3bbt5d,Cranberry_Lips,2,Sun Jun 28 03:54:40 2015 UTC,"It is very common that BPDs make you feel like you are the crazy one. This is very turbulent and confusing. If you feel unsure, go to therapy.   I felt the same way, and therapy helped me understand what was going on, what was my contribution to the problems (codependence), and what was her (the insanity of the fights). I can look back now and really see what was my responsibility, and improve on that, what wasn't, and don't feel guilt for that."
BPDlovedones,3bbt5d,cookieredittor,2,Mon Jun 29 07:34:13 2015 UTC,"I keep reminding myself that the one crazy, intense, roller coaster ride only ever happens in the vicinity of my bestie (no other relationships in my life are ever like this). I started asking the same questions so I wrote it all down, starting when we met to now. On paper it's damn clear she is creating this.   I feel codependant but im trying to stay sane, which only comes with distance. Very very unhealthy, I struggle to convince myself that she cares for me and not just the comfort and stability I bring. Im an emotional punching bag for her, but she sits back safely knowing Im unlikely to go any where. It sucks how she just seems to stop caring once i dont play her games, like any one else with spare time will fill her void..... Ok now im just venting, sorry."
BPDlovedones,3bbt5d,Kamushika,2,Tue Jun 30 17:11:03 2015 UTC,"This is a great question. I'm potentially about a week into a breakup with a person with bpd, and learning about this disorder is making me question my own behavior as well. But I do know this from reflection: I don't think I ever pushed my stress from other situations on to her, and I don't think she  felt that she had to pick and choose her words carefully around me. The opposite is my belief when I change the parties in those scenarios.  And missing a person / wanting to be with somebody you cared about shouldn't concern you too much (I think). Even if a relationship started to get bumpy right away, there was something you liked about them or the relationship at one point. I know I just walked away from my best friend, so of course I feel a little empty and miss her. I think that's a very reasonable feeling.  I think Kamushika's comparison to other relationships is very refreshing; it certainly made me feel a little more confident about this question."
BPDlovedones,3bbt5d,djn24,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you are here!  I firmly believe that these relationships can be used as a net positive.  We aren't 'crazy' as they try hard to make us believe, but we also aren't perfect (as no one is).  To me, as extreme as my marriage on certain scales, it really exaggerated certain dynamics.  It pushed me to either break or to acknowledge and assess myself and my thoughts, behaviors, and actions.  It highlighted where I NEED to improve myself.  I am grateful for that.  You are right to acknowledge your ex's gaslighting and see you weren't at fault.  It is also very healthy to look to yourself as you are and see focus on your own roles.    I believe I was always a bit on the 'caretaker' spectrum, but in healthier relationships before it was never made into an unhealthy codependence.  With my wife she's enabled me to work on that codependent nature.  It was destroying me.  I think when we really focus on ourselves, being more balanced, filling our own needs, all the benefits and improvements that allows us to make in ourselves- that our relationships in the future will be infinitely more rewarding.   Hang in there, I am sure a week into break-up that things are hard and pangs of regret or guilt, or missing them come.. but you CAN make it and your life is now in YOUR hands- so you are in not just good, but the best hands."
BPDlovedones,3bbt5d,Shanguerrilla,2,Tue Jun 30 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about the net positive. I really couldn't figure out why, but I felt insanely connected to this girl; what I'm reading now makes me think that she just has very intense relationships--which when it worked, was pretty awesome.   The fragility of her emotions was also a positive when we worked. I learned how to be very aware of the sensitivities of the person I'm speaking with, which I think makes me a better person.   The sensitivities also made me feel pretty good (like you, I think I'm a bit of a caretaket), feeling like I had beautiful but fragile person to protect and care for.  I think a relationship with somebody who displays these qualities, but also responsibly evaluates their emotions could be very rewarding.   Thank you for welcoming me :)"
BPDlovedones,3bbt5d,djn24,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:23:35 2015 UTC,When she broke up with me over trust issues I kept on trying break no contact bc I was telling her her worries weren't true and she thought I was doing more harm than good. Aren't BPD individuals the ones clamoring to get their relationship back on track?   Not necessarily  If you've been painted black (splitting) they will do all in their power to ignore and demonize you
BPDlovedones,3bbctr,bachelorettebetty,2,Sat Jun 27 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"Children to parents with BPD are more likely to develop that disorder themselves or end up being codependent. Her husband might be codependent himself.   The best thing for all of them is to get therapy. BPD takes years to improve and her husband needs to learn how to set and enforce boundaries.   You should approach your sister about it first. If she rejects you and refuses to get therapy, then talk to her husband. She might accuse you of going behind her back, but honestly, trying is better than nothing, and it's not fair for kids to grow up in an unstable environment like that."
BPDlovedones,3bbctr,Cranberry_Lips,2,Sat Jun 27 17:49:53 2015 UTC,"Don't forget your own role in relating to kids. Being a role model, having your own strong and clear boundaries and respecting their - once they are old enough to develop boundaries - will be important and helpful. Time and time again, people say that we cannot make others change. We can do what we can do, though, and sometimes it is a lot."
BPDlovedones,3batar,dead_precidents,3,Sat Jun 27 12:51:18 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad you got out when you did. I was in a similar situation and have the same tendencies as you. Thankfully for subs like this, I was able to recognize the signs and was able to trust my gut feelings and act on them.   It's been 2 weeks of n/c and while I admit on how difficult it is, I also realize how necessary it is to maintain it. I believe this because as you stated one will not find closure with someone with bpd, you have to find it in yourself. I am finding this to be very true in my situation... I didn't bother to tell her how hurt I was, I knew she would just twist my words and me leaving should be crystal clear. As for friendship, I'm not sure if it's possible for me.. I saw how she keeps all of her exes as friends and I personally don't want to join their ranks. I have been reading the /r/BPD forum and seeing that cheating is an urge. THey don't do it to hurt us and they actually feel lots of remorse for hurting their SOs.. or hurting anyone really.  Man the amount of hurt, I'm 30 and I'm still shocked! A huge flag that came up was she would use personal secrets she goaded out of me as part of her criticisms. Those hurt bad. I don't think I could trust anyone who would do that, BPD or not.  I've blocked her on everything and she even resorted to writing to my parents. They will try everything to contact you once you're painted white again.. Or they just want that control. Stay strong!"
BPDlovedones,3batar,Tastygroove,2,Sat Jun 27 14:29:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the words of support, you too.  For me, talking about it with friends and getting their input helps with perspective.  In turn, I obsess less myself and that helps me concentrate on other things which seems to help me move on."
BPDlovedones,3bayz0,silent-shade,2,Sat Jun 27 14:07:14 2015 UTC,"Man I was getting flashbacks reading your story! You felt like you were attacked because you were attacked. Now that I'm 2 weeks out, I can see how real the projection is. Do you want to stay?"
BPDlovedones,3bayz0,ijustneedahug,2,Sat Jun 27 14:37:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't read it but I'm sure I know how it went. Leave, cool off, go back, get another dose, leave, cool off, go back, get another dose......  Is there a pattern there?  This will be your life, sad but true."
BPDlovedones,3bayz0,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"I'd like to play a little bit of devil's advocate.   She said she was missing me already.    That honestly is something cute that couples say to each other.  One says, I'm going to miss you, the other replies ""I miss you already!""  Meaning, I'll miss you so much I already hate just that you are about to leave.  So maybe she meant it that way.  Maybe not.  The truth is that you ARE allowed your feelings.  It ISN'T 'wrong' to be hurt from past hurts!  They make me feel distant too.     I only spoke about her attacking me, two major incidents, but there were also some less dramatic arguments.    Honestly, when I bring up a topic out of the blue and only talk about her role in things, I'm going to have a bad day.    The best advice I can give you that I've experienced relates to this:   I felt like I was attacked and wanted to defend myself. Now I think she was probably not.    Whether I felt attacked or was attacked- it is never time to defend myself (unless her attack is physical).  I've never once seen a benefit from arguing, justifying, explaining, or defending my feelings.  Never, it always backfired.  At best the most I proved to her was that I was so weak or vulnerable to her words, that they had enough truth- that they hurt me and I had to defend myself.  Agree and amplify to outlandish accusation, ignore, demand respect... do something other than get down in the mud begging for understanding (not that you expressed you had done this).  So back to the distance right now.  You are hurt and that makes you want distance.  That is completely normal and warranted.  What I see and wish to champion is to PROCESS your feelings.  Allow yourself to feel.  I was forbade from HAVING feelings for so long I got really lousy at it.  Eventually I realized I was always able and allowed to have feelings, I let her diminish them.  I allowed her to control me and inhibit me from expressing them or feeling or processing them.  We need to grieve our losses, we need to hurt and heal from pain.  We need to feel these things so we can move from where we were when we got our wounds.  Not processing feelings is how people get resentments.  Resentments are poisonous to us.  They don't hurt the abuser, they hurt our own lives and relationships.  Give yourself time to feel and allow yourself to feel.     Anyway, I wanted, I do not know, some clearing of the air. I am not sure. I hoped if I brought my concerns up, they can be solved. May be I just wanted sympathy. I don't know. But instead I felt trapped, nothing was cleared and nothing was solved. I could not stand it anymore.    I find it is sometimes unproductive to go through my feelings with my wife, it seems I seek her understanding or approval for my feelings.  Like tell her why I hurt, why I'm distant.. I don't need her permission and I don't need her to understand (Spoiler alert: she will decline both those opportunities 9/10 times for me).  So instead I try to just feel that hurt.  I let myself.  I accept that.  I process it as best I can and I move on while making better boundaries.  I feel more light and free.  I am less burdened and I'm not having anxiety attacks anymore.  I couldn't live for her approval and understanding anymore.    The fear of if she will leave, the distance you feel now, the hurts you've been dealt and allowed...  I commiserate.  What I wish to propose to you isn't that it is wrong to feel that way.  You are not crazy.  Whether she leaves you or not.  Whether you can process these hurts and hangups immediately or over time (it usually takes time)...  You need to decide what YOU want.  Do you want a relationship with her?  You need to let yourself feel and take control of your own life.  We can't live our lives feeling diminished, not allowed feelings, or getting abused.  We need to amend those things, not being diminished and feeling/processing feelings are both within our own power, if our boundaries cannot stop the abuse then we can through our choices.    I realize I am speaking fundamental 'duh' statements, I just get the impression you feel as I have before.  Like a buoy on a stormy sea.  I want you to understand that much of what you expressed here, to my fallible mind, reads from codependency.  We have ALL the power in our lives in 'fixing' that, because that is our problem.  Yes, BPD SO's can seemingly demand it, but we still choose to give it to them.  You aren't her victim and you don't have to be hurt, but you need some time to heal.  Your feelings are real.  You are allowed to have moods or feel a little distant.  You don't have to be perfect, but this is your only life and you need to make yours satisfying."
BPDlovedones,3bayz0,Shanguerrilla,2,Sun Jun 28 05:19:20 2015 UTC,Thank you for the wise and kind words!
BPDlovedones,3bayz0,Shanguerrilla,2,Sun Jun 28 05:46:21 2015 UTC,"You know, I reread my post.  I don't know about the sharing feelings part I rambled on.  I wish I did.  I can say there have been times in my marriage I've felt exactly as I imagine you do.  Times I'm distant and on autopilot.  She's done the most hurtful things she could and I didn't make good boundaries.  They'd keep repeating, I'd keep feeling distant and resentful in between, so I'd calmly bring up some examples in as detached and compassionate way I could (like I pictured you doing).  Sometimes we need to share our feelings, but something I have trouble explaining bugs me about it.  /u/way2manycooks hit on it in a submission I asked for insight on.  It's useful to bring up behavior we can't accept and make clear a boundary (what we'll do) sometimes... But sometimes when I 'need to share my feelings' I'm projecting my insecurities, 'needing' her to understand, or in a way asking her to make me feel better.  When I've been looking for those things, that's when I mean those heart to heart talks have always left me unsatisfied.  I'm not trying to say you shouldn't share your feelings or talk about them, I wanted to clarify that I can really relate to your post.    Having and sharing feelings is often a very strong topic in this sub.  That specifically was the thing that triggered my wife's worst rage, the struggle to diminish them often has a strong role in our feeling pushed to codependency, and the lack of empathy to them our resentment..  it's no small topic, the things you posted on."
BPDlovedones,3bayz0,way2manycooks,2,Sun Jun 28 07:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think you hit the nerve here - I think I was asking her to do things for me, not just share feelings and concerns. I am most grateful for the sympathy and insight."
BPDlovedones,3bayz0,Shanguerrilla,3,Sun Jun 28 08:21:30 2015 UTC,"I'm grateful to you and the rest of this sub.  I was so hollowed out and alone and lost in this stuff..  I still get very overwhelmed sometimes, yours and other's support and sharing your story helps us not go crazy and start to get our lives back.  These relationships feel easy to drown in.    Keep looking for your own role and ways you can improve and get stronger (as you are).  Their problems are neither our fault, nor our responsibility, we are responsible to grow and protect ourselves without being defensive.  We can survive and be happy.  Remember you aren't alone.  We don't have to feel emotionally crushed, even though sometimes it's very hard not to.  Sorry for rambling, I'm having a bit of a hard day myself and just wanted to say I appreciate you and this sub as well."
BPDlovedones,3bayz0,way2manycooks,2,Sun Jun 28 16:34:10 2015 UTC,"You are hurt and that makes you want distance. That is completely normal and warranted....Allow yourself to feel. I was forbade from HAVING feelings for so long I got really lousy at it. Eventually I realized I was always able and allowed to have feelings, I let her diminish them. I allowed her to control me and inhibit me from expressing them or feeling or processing them.    I love this point.   I'm working on how to express my feelings honestly, without the expectation that those feelings will be fixed or alleviated by my SO. He is really good at being needy (when HE needs something) and really bad at being sympathetic (when I need something). Bottom line is, you have to find the strength to love and rely on yourself but it's also important to speak your mind.  What I'm trying NOT to do is bottle up my feelings and place them on the back burner, indefinitely. This just leads to resentment (which is what I think /u/silent-shade is dealing with right now and an emotion I've been contending with too). And sometimes it leads us to act in ways that aren't productive or healthy for the relationship.   Here's what's been working for me as of late:   -Being assertive (honestly stating how you feel when you feel a certain way)  -Recognizing the right time to be assertive (ie., not in the middle of chaos; a tantrum for example or when you feel so upset or angry that you're in tears--I know my SO does NOT take well to crying)  -Not being moved by manipulative attempts to be controlled through fear, obligation, and guilt  -Learning how to stop obsessing, worrying, and panicking about unlikely scenarios by engaging in things that put me in a good mood (spending times with friends, working out, etc), deep breathing and relaxation exercises, and evaluating thoughts that trigger a fearful or anxious response and kick the nervous system into over drive.  BPD is crazy making, I think most of us in the sub have questioned our own sanity at one time or another. If you choose to do something productive with those thoughts, you may find yourself in a place like this taking steps to become a better person."

BPDlovedones,3b9cig,recognitionfailed,4,Sat Jun 27 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"lol-  I like your exposition the best, surprisingly accurate."
BPDlovedones,3b9cig,Shanguerrilla,2,Sat Jun 27 04:01:06 2015 UTC,"That's great buddy!  I hope you have a great time.  On BPD sufferers (and we have to remember as similar as our experiences, the symptoms between sufferers vary greatly) I agree that the good times are pretty great.  There can paradoxically be a closeness not available everywhere in unhealthy relationships that counterbalances the unhealthy distance, anxiety, and pain other times.  My wife's never worn her heart on her sleeve or seemed adept at empathy or 'reading people' like some claim, but she feels one thing at a time very strongly.  She has extreme emotions.  When things are bad they are horrible, when she is loving and not dysregulated things can be pretty amazing.  If that wasn't the case I doubt any of us would have very long stories about relationships, can't have many pushes without some pulls."
BPDlovedones,3b9cig,Shanguerrilla,12,Sat Jun 27 04:41:13 2015 UTC,"With my wife..  It's like being deeply in love with someone while knowing who she is and what is tormenting her better than she does.  Her perspective is still warped and too close-- watching her emotions take her on a ride from that person..  Seeing that emotional roller coaster shift directions rapidly and out of her control from love to hate and seeing her storm, tantrum, or rage in response.  I understand that she is both people, that it is the same person...   I hate seeing her try to hurt me, now not because it hurts me as I can usually better protect myself without defensiveness, but because I can see how much greater that she hurts to do so to begin with and even greater in response to trying to hurt me.  In a way it is like seeing a beautiful person who is blind with low self esteem.  She can't see herself or how beautiful she is.  That idea though, is frightening to me because my attraction to her, seeing this- is unhealthy.  I can't be 'a fixer' or a savior.  In this way she is teaching me a lot about myself and pushing me to improve myself.   In her case, instead of physically handicapped she is emotionally handicapped.  From all the years with her it has taught me that she lives in a world of emotion.  That is what matters.  This moment's emotion rewrites history and justifies any action.  Even still and adding to this handicap, she can only experience emotions in the binary.  0 or 1.  She has to set down one emotion to pick another up.  She can't love me and see me as who I am when she has picked up hate, disgust, or displeasure.  Then I am only that thing she picked up.  The worst of all is guilt, shame, and unacceptance of herself.  I wish she'd stop picking those up because I feel like they are always the start of our home's chaos.  The storm clouds focus on me, but it seems like they always precipitate from one of those three.  So that is my warped and rambling perception... but it doesn't matter what I think about her.  I choose to stay and I choose to love her.  I choose to remain the man of my home, so long as she doesn't decide on (or try to blackmail me about) leaving me, or so long as I can maintain a healthy emotional life and hold up boundaries when necessary.  My staying isn't dependent on her or her actions in the future I can't control.  It is dependent on me.  I can't be so perfect I make things work and I'm not banking on that.  I try to walk a tightrope past perfectionism and simply judge myself fairly but critically.  If I can't be a man healthy in myself and healthy for her and our son- then we will divorce.  She's taught me a lot about myself in a twisted way.  She's shown me that she can pick up those binary emotions one by one and paint me any color she wants, but it really doesn't matter to reality.  She can see me as a monster, a horrible husband, and a bad father, but I can still act as a good man, loving husband, and caring father.    I can forgive without forgetting (as much as that torments her).  Her perception and emotions, her judgment and criticality is worthless anytime I decide it to be.  Her actions though, I have to do my best to hold her accountable to and I am working on myself in this way.  In general she is teaching me how to stay a selfless person in healthy ways, but also be more selfish in healthy ways.  How to self validate, self accept, and be a man I'm proud of regardless of outside perception.  She's teaching me about outcome independence, taking action and being accountable for myself rather than the things I cannot control.  I have to be satisfied with that.  For now I am and I choose to love her.    edit- by the way /u/recognitionfailed I hope you don't get triggered by our posts and I DO think this was a very good question in general.  I ALSO think asking this, your OP and your comments in this post have been very mindful and self accountable.  That is very healthy and impressive."

I see a lot of myself in these answers especially about binary and ""This moment's emotion rewrites history and justifies any action"".  Thank yo for taking the time to comment on this.  Could I ask you a question?  I want to know how i can curb my behaviour so"
BPDlovedones,3b9cig,ThisBorderlineLife,3,Sat Jun 27 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"I dont damage my partner as much, I go through phases where life is awful, I used greet him with ""Im sad today"" so he knows what to expect then it will change and il ask ""im happy"" I can see his face light up and we have a great time together, is this a good idea or when i say ""im sad"" im just aggravating the situation and making it seem as though my mood is concrete and unchangeable as if to say today/tonight/this evening your horrible?"
BPDlovedones,3b9cig,Sugar-waffle,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"It isn't bad to communicate how you feel.  Everyone's moods shift and change as well.  My problem was I felt like I had to revolve all my behavior and words around how my wife felt at that moment.  That is codependency and both partners need to do what we can to end that, yet we are separately only responsible for our side of the equation.  Instead it is often supported by the BPD and enabled by the SO.  That is very unhealthy and what to avoid."
BPDlovedones,3b9cig,Cranberry_Lips,2,Sat Jun 27 14:41:33 2015 UTC,"So as if shes overpowering how you feel? That's a good point, thank you for all your reply's.  What I think my main issue is - is that one relationship I was in can be perfectly described as hell, he was very controlling and because of my bpd i thought i deserved this behavior and almost took comfort out of the misery, we have broken up now, and although I would rather never see him again, I can now also see I was no angel and that I take blame on myself too, I hope hes happy.  This relationship does mean though, whenever I feel threatened - someone not doing exactly what I say or not asking my permission to do something I flip out, its not intentional at the time I ""This moment's emotion rewrites history and justifies any action"" therefore you are evil, irregardless of the truth.  One example of this is a guy a briefly dated showed up at my house uninvited with chocolates (it was easter) to surprise me, I freaked out.  The reason behind this is the controlling guy I dated would show up at my house all the time without my permission high and acting aggressively."
BPDlovedones,3b9cig,Cranberry_Lips,2,Sat Jun 27 14:45:48 2015 UTC,"Continue working on you.  Continue to ask painful questions!  You are here looking at yourself with accountability, you're looking for YOUR role- that is amazing and significant.    A lot of PDs can have similar behavior patterns, but all of them are benefited by these hard actions.  If you do get diagnosed BPD, then get into DBT therapy and study or do workbooks.   Learning and improving mindfulness helps us all (PD or not) to see our own role more clearly and to be more accountable, less living in shifting emotional reality.  Lastly, I VERY much think people with PDs need a strong and empathetic partner.  You cannot manipulate or abuse ANYONE who doesn't let you... Now we cannot let such acknowledgment affect our focus on our own role, but even that can be focused on in our own role: meaning be strong enough to leave someone not good for you, pick a good partner, or lead them away from (and notice) any codependency.  You are asking important questions that are painful and exceptionally significant."
BPDlovedones,3b9cig,Soundboard_Fez,2,Sat Jun 27 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"As someone with BPD, this comment is incredibly eye-opening and sheds a whole new light on how my boyfriend must feel. I hear him when he tries to explain, but he's not always the best at communicating how he feels so sometimes I don't quite understand what he's trying to say and end up convoluting his message with all my irrational thoughts that I have an extremely hard time navigating these days.

Just for that reason, I think it is a good idea to do what is necessary to stop that user from continuing to write such triggering things.  On the other hand, the post by /u/witsend12 has been deleted. If it was deleted by /u/witsend12, I thank her for understanding how a BPD posting in this sub to complain about boundaries is very triggering, and I thank her for respecting our. If this was deleted by the mod, I thank the mod for taking action.    In case HE, the bf of the user, reads this:   This thing /u/witsend12 is doing here is classic BPD behavior. It has two components. Hoovering and Emotional Blackmail.   She is hoovering by trying to call your parents, stalk you in social networks, even here. She is using emotional blackmail by saying things like ""if you loved me, you wouldn't have boundaries"". These are ways to hurt you and disrespect you, and clear signs she is not accepting responsibility for her actions. Stay strong, and don't fall for it! The more she does it, remind yourself that the more she is signaling she isn't taking the difficult steps to get better, so YOU must be stronger and firmer and do what you need to do for yourself.

I haven't been here that long but didn't basically this sub come about because BPs railroaded into r/BPDSOFFA and started getting all upset about BPD loved ones complaining about people with BPD?  After I made the (terrible) mistake of telling my uBPD then-girlfriend I thought she had BPD and I posted on a support group for BPD SOs, she searched every forum she could find looking for my posts and got herself all worked up thinking some posts were mine and just in general what people said about BPD SOs. She never found this place, thank god. She basically demanded to read what I said about our relationship and I refused. I said what I wrote here (and this is my advice to any BPDs reading here) is, in my opinion, said in confidence, like what you would tell a therapist. If a wife goes to a Al-Anon family meeting for dealing with her alcoholic husband, the husband doesn't have any right to know what she says in the meetings or what others say about their relationship to her. My two cents."
BPDlovedones,3b5mu9,Soundboard_Fez,6,Sat Jun 27 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"wow...something really fishy going on. I agree, we need an active mod. I'm going to keep messaging u/licked_cupcake. If anyone else has any ideas please speak up."
BPDlovedones,3b5mu9,cookieredittor,8,Fri Jun 26 08:55:20 2015 UTC,That poster is continuing to make an absolute fool of herself on other subs.  These people have such a frightening lack of humanity.    This sub really needs to be modded.  The graciousness with which other posters communicated with her really drives that point home.
BPDlovedones,3b6bn0,bdpgirlfriend,9,Fri Jun 26 09:24:18 2015 UTC,"It was a bad idea to break NC. The problem is that when you do, it encourages them to bring chaos back into your life. However, nothing bad happened, so don't feel guilt. Focus instead your energy on being very consistent with NC onwards.  This might mean you saying that this is difficult for you emotionally, and you want to go back to NC. The more you string her along, the more you welcome her chaos.  Remember, BPDs come in phases, good times, bad times, etc. It is great she is doing well. But PDs are pervasive, so don't even for a second dream that now she is better for real, and things will be different. Assume instead this is a long process, and she goes through ups and downs, and you know those very well, and don't fall for them again."
BPDlovedones,3b6bn0,cookieredittor,2,Fri Jun 26 12:43:24 2015 UTC,"Keeping NC was definitely the right choice, but cat's out of the bag at this point. She seems keen on staying just friends so hoping it doesn't go bad like last time we tried being just friends."
BPDlovedones,3b6bn0,cookieredittor,4,Fri Jun 26 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"I don't see why ""cat is out of the bag"", because you can just go NC again. Nothing stops you form doing it. Just be honest about your feelings.  If you want it to be different, YOU change your actions. If you hope things will be different this time because of miracles, well, know you are enabling things to be exactly the same again. Remember this warning."
BPDlovedones,3b6bn0,way2manycooks,2,Fri Jun 26 20:34:39 2015 UTC,"The cat's only out of the bag if you say so, OP. It's YOUR choice to either go back to NC (as cookie suggested) or get pulled back into the chaos. You had a slip up (no one's judging you here) but do you really think she's capable of just being friends? I think the fact that she's still calling you from unknown numbers at all hours speaks to the fact that the answer is probably no."
BPDlovedones,3b6bn0,Kamushika,0,Sat Jun 27 13:31:12 2015 UTC,Since we had our first talk she has actually... just like 2-3 texts from her about her dog and other little stuff. Not pushing any boundaries or trying to control me. Going to keep monitoring it. Maybe therapy is helping.
BPDlovedones,3b6bn0,Sugar-waffle,0,Sat Jun 27 16:49:00 2015 UTC,Just don't want to go NC again after I promised to be friends. Last time we tried Just Friends she went too far and I went NC. This time she admitted we shouldn't be romantically involved and has been good so far so just taking it one day at a time.

BPDlovedones,3b6bn0,silent-shade,4,Tue Jun 30 17:44:09 2015 UTC,"I can see this from both sides. I have BPD. I honestly think you shouldn't have broken no contact - she thinks there is hope now. She's got control and is making you ""chase"" her....And now she knows it's working. I bet there will be some fake major drama in her life in the next few days, when she will need to meet up or talk to you loads again, you'll offer support, and you'll end up back in the same position.   I have been through this cycle again and again - need a clean break. For both of you. It's hard enough to be friends with an ex if you don't have a PD....but it's impossible to do without some hidden agenda for every single other borderline I know. And I know a lot. :/"
BPDlovedones,3b3uc9,dinosaurs_r_awesome,11,Thu Jun 25 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"Bro hug. I really mean it. This is a horrible situation. Nobody deserves it. Yes, her actions are horrible and inexcusable.   I have a suggestion. Stop forcing yourself to feel any way. Stop reading a book that is triggering. Right now, you don't have to force compassion and understanding about her. Focus on having compassion and understanding for yourself. You need that first of all, and the hell you are going through, you need tons of self compassion. Reading that book to change how you feel about her is still a form of putting her first, and this empowers her to hurt you more.  Do stuff good for your well being, even if small. Read a light fun book that distracts you, or buy yourself a small gift. Do this regularly. You need to put yourself and your feelings first. This is the way to give her less power over your life."
BPDlovedones,3b3uc9,cookieredittor,6,Thu Jun 25 19:22:40 2015 UTC,"First off, sorry for what you are going through and how you feel right now, I've been right there too, it feels like everything is crushing you on the inside while you try to maintain an outward appearance of calm.  And you feel like even that will come crashing down at any moment.  The court system is very slow.  Me and my family, and my job/co-workers were all bombarded though every possible type of media from my ex during our divorce.  We also had mutual restraining orders, but it took months to finally get to the point of doing the ""motion to enforce"" where the judge dropped the hammer on my ex.  She was found guilty of 17 separate violations of the existing orders and sentenced to a month in jail for each.   The jail time was suspended depending on her behavior over the next year.  I was absolutely convinced that she'd end up in jail because she ""couldn't control herself"".  Well guess what?  Even my own evil psychopathic bitch managed to keep her shit together and there was not a single violation for that whole year, even when our 16 year old son decided he didn't want to visit her anymore.    I agree with you that they are bad people.  But mostly, I want to encourage you to hang in there, you will be more than OK when its all over.  Just keep looking to the future when you are done with her."
BPDlovedones,3b3uc9,Churn,3,Thu Jun 25 20:28:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like ""Walking on Eggshells"" is a much better source material for learning about BPD. It's very clinically oriented and neutral  Get Me Out of Here is also horribly written. ugh,"
BPDlovedones,3b3uc9,yakhauler,2,Thu Jun 25 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"Dang man, you are really going through hell. So sorry that you're being put through all that.   I agree in that BPDs should not be excused for their behavior. I went through a phase of feeling like you do, just total anger and disgust at the evil behaviors that were directed at me. It made it easier to deal with the divorce too as I was not sympathetic in the least. I think it's totally ok to feel the way you do...it's good to recognize the magnitude of how awful her behavior is towards you and that it is not acceptable by any means. But for me that wasn't a healthy place to stay...I don't want to be consumed with anger indefinitely. Maybe you will find a way to forgive or at least move past that anger like I did. I would not spend much time trying to understand her or her disorder, because for most non-BPDs we simply cannot understand. All the knowledge in the world will not make sense of what you are going through. It's not logical or rational. As I'm learning to let go of that anger in myself it's becoming easier and easier to move on and find myself in a much better headspace.   Anyway, good luck. Keep the end goal in mind and do your best not to absorb the horrible things she says and does. Be prepared and know it's coming. Stay strong brother."
BPDlovedones,3b3uc9,RudolphRed,2,Thu Jun 25 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"A tip ... do NOT let them know the psych testing they will be going through in advance.  And avoid MMPI.  There is peer reviewed research showing that it's about 25% effective in diagnosing borderlines in INPATIENT situations, i.e., the worst of the worst.  It is also very very easy to locate online and prepare appropriately.    Been there, done that with the pedophile bullshit and had to spend a few grand to prove I'm not."
BPDlovedones,3b3uc9,Soundboard_Fez,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:23:03 2015 UTC,"Too late, she already knows. I don't know if it's MMPI; it's a forensic psychologist, is all I know. I'm allowed to present my materials first, which is good - the evaluator won't be working in a vacuum.  In any case, the die is cast."
BPDlovedones,3b3uc9,Soundboard_Fez,2,Fri Jun 26 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"Them knowing they'll be testing is fine.   WHICH testing is the key.  The MMPI is the usual standard and it's very easy online to find strategies for passing without appearing deceptive.  Mine passed MMPI fine, but took a separate test about parenting that she had no advance knowledge of,  and the test was invalidated for a high level of deception.   http://www.researchgate.net/publication/258126196_Assessment_of_Borderline_Personality_Disorder_Using_the_MMPI-2_and_the_Personality_Assessment_Inventory  I was wrong about the MMPI effectiveness too.  It's 9%.  Linked the research above,  which includes a better test.   Suggest the better test,  or both.   I found this too late."

BPDlovedones,3ayhhb,way2manycooks,6,Wed Jun 24 14:53:32 2015 UTC,I often wonder(now doing so out loud...) How many males are diagnosed with bpd when they lean more heavily towards NPD.
BPDlovedones,3ayhhb,Tastygroove,2,Wed Jun 24 16:22:43 2015 UTC,Interesting observation. He definitely has some narcissistic tendencies.

BPDlovedones,3ayhhb,penny_for_thoughts,3,Wed Jun 24 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"In my experience, saying that he doesn't want to live with you is typically bpd - hurting you, controlling you through that. Have you checked out that out of the FOG -webpage? I can highly recommend that - Especially the typical traits and communication examples have been an eye opener for me...  And moving is always a trigger! Him moving and you following is just red flags all over the place.. For some reason I don't like that at all and not only because of my personal history. It is something he wants - he has unrealistic hopes that things will be better once you're there.. Does he usually think things can be improved by changing external factors?   As you say and as others have pointed out - focus on yourself, make sure you stay sane (however, the definitions of happy/sane/healthy you can give yourself in such a relationship are often unreliable). Work on your boundaries, also consider the small things you want to/don't want to tolerate anymore."

BPDlovedones,3ayhhb,cookieredittor,2,Wed Jun 24 21:11:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks, /u/penny_for_thoughts. I've spent a lot of time reading the info on outofthefog (a great resource!), excellent suggestion.   I read Stop Walking On Eggshells. Right now I'm reading When I Say No I Feel Guilty and I'm about to start Loving Someone with Borderline Personality Disorder by Sherri Manning (she's amazing). I'm also wrapping up a book on codependency (by Melody Beattie). And for the first time in a long time, I'm telling my friends about what's going on. They're extremely supportive, which has been really amazing. I was very scared to tell anyone about my relationship but I finally feel like I can talk about things now.    Does he usually think things can be improved by changing external factors?   Oh-ho. Yes. Today we talked and I said what was on my mind (hey, he asked). I said ""here we are again, I'm telling you, you need to get back with your therapist or we have problems"". I know it's not necessarily going to fix our problems but I needed to make him aware that I'm at a point where I feel he needs outside help again. I told him he has to stop taking out his frustrations on me. Not only is it unfair, it's hurting me and ruining the relationship.   He apologized, he took responsibility for his wrong doing (last night he was very rude on the phone with me because he couldn't hear me, I told him how bad that felt), and he assured me that he'll be in touch with his old therapist again very soon. He was under the impression that I was upset because I felt ignored. I told him no, I understood he was busy today (as was I). He said I'm sorry, I love you, I miss you, the cats miss you, let's plan a visit as soon as possible.   I'm on guard and not afraid to throw in the glove at this point. My plan is to stick by my boundaries and continue to be honest with him about my feelings instead of bottle them up to appease him. I'm not moving anywhere just yet. We definitely have a ways to go. But this is where we're at right now.   Thanks again for writing. It's extremely important to know that this advice exists if (when) things go downhill again."
BPDlovedones,3ayhhb,cookieredittor,4,Wed Jun 24 19:27:42 2015 UTC,"Remember, instability and chaos is the rule with BPDs. You can't plan anything nor have expectations based on assuming he won't choose instability and chaos.   This is very hard to accept, but it has nothing to do with you, and all to do with how their emotions change how they perceive reality."
BPDlovedones,3ayhhb,RudolphRed,4,Thu Jun 25 08:26:41 2015 UTC,"I also want to clarify that your boundaries aren't really boundaries. They are demands. Boundaries are ACTIONS you do that he doesn't have control over. Boundaries are for you.  For example ""I will not live in separate homes."" is not a boundary, it is something you want. What is a boundary is if you say ""If you chose to live in separate homes, I will end this relationship because it is best for me this way"".   My favorite example of a boundaries is what to do when they insult you. Not a boundary: saying ""Don't insult me!"". that isn't  boundary, it actually empower the other because it says you need them to do something for you, and if they are angry, they won't do it. A boundary would be to say ""I'm not going to listen to the insults"" and then LEAVE the house. You take ACTION to enforce it independent of what the other person does.  If you want something, but you don't act on it, it isn't a boundary, it is a request. Boundaries empower YOU. Requests empower the other person."

What is a boundary is if you say ""If you chose to live in separate homes, I will end this relationship because it is best for me this way"".   Thanks cookie, this is an excellent reminder. Just for the record, I have informed him that I will end this relationship if he's unwilling to live together. I absolutely will not budge on this.   The hard part is ACTING. I will try to remember your comment when it comes time to take action.   I'm at a point right now where I've stopped taking steps towards searching for a job near him. We'll plan a visit in the near future but I'm not going to break my back to get out there when things are as uncertain as they are. I feel he needs to convince me that 1) he's working on himself (especially his temper) and 2) he actually wants me there (under the same roof) before I feel comfortable looking for work.   For now, I'm taking it one day at a time. I think the best thing I could do for myself and probably the relationship is go home to Chicago to be with my family for a period of time while we determine if the relationship can survive given my boundaries. I haven't made any final decisions just yet. I'm just trying to determine the next best step.   Do you think I'm breaking my boundary (or being reasonably flexible) if I give him the year to finish out this lease and we decide to move back in together? I don't see it as putting my life on hold; it would allow me to work on the next step of my career, be around family, and work on myself. Do you see any red flags here? Does this seem like I'm bending the boundary in a way that would enable him?"
BPDlovedones,3ayhhb,imgoingalittlenuts2,3,Thu Jun 25 16:00:43 2015 UTC,"Without knowing a ton about your past and this situation...it sounds like he's checked out of the relationship already but just hasn't gotten around to telling you yet. Every action you described seemed like he's breaking it off and avoiding any semblance of commitment. It's frightening and unimaginably difficult to end a long-term relationship like yours, but I and plenty of others can tell you that the pain and fear will fade and you will find yourself in a better place after leaving a relationship that was not good for you."

I'm willing to give him the opportunity to work on what he needs to work on (primarily, his anger) but there may come a point where it's time to say enoughs enough. The back and forth is really creating a lot of chaos. I feel like I'm on an emotional roller coaster.  /u/Tastygroove alluded to NPD which definitely struck me; I may eat my words one day (and I realize the evidence suggests he wants out but is too much of a wuss to leave), however, I suspect this boils down more so to selfishness. I don't get the feeling he wants the relationship to end, per se, he just wants it continue in a way that only benefits him. Which is sabotaging the relationship.    I and plenty of others can tell you that the pain and fear will fade and you will find yourself in a better place after leaving a relationship that was not good for you.   I will remember this as things unfold. Thank you for chiming in, this is exactly the type of support I needed right now."

Works both way, I guess.  It wasn't the right thing to do.  I was a complete asshole about everything, but she needed me so much that she bought it.  I regret that I treated her that way.  She acted out frequently, but she didn't deserve they way I treated her.  Suppose it goes both ways at times.  Perhaps the situation isn't quite the way you judge it.  I've beat the odds and have a successful relationship.  I don't see too many success stories here so your results may vary.  All the best."
BPDlovedones,3aynvz,RudolphRed,7,Wed Jun 24 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"It's hard to leave a long-term relationship like that no matter what. It sounds like you realized it was an unhealthy situation for you. What were your reasons for leaving? Go over those again. Remember the specific situations that led you to that decision. You are responsible for you and you only...your parents surely want grandkids, and I'm sure you'd like to start a family too. But you don't owe your parents grandkids now or ever. Your #1 priority is to take care of yourself. Do you really want to have children with the woman who was using you as a punching bag anyway?  There are folks who have made a relationship with a BPD work, but it takes a long time and effort and she would almost definitley need be in therapy, as well as you probably. I'd recommend therapy for you regardless, as it will be really helpful in unpacking everything you've been through and getting back to a healthy place for yourself.  Keep in mind that hoovering is a common BPD behavior... that fear of abandonment and wanting to suck you back in. Attempting to manipulate you by going through your parents is another one."

I forget that I'm constantly censoring myself, putting my own needs last, and making myself miserable to keep her happy.

For years any special holiday that was about me was given some care, but for the most part was looked at as ""Adults don't celebrate"" which is a fucking buzzkill. PLENTY of adults celebrate. Plenty of them see these things as special but apparently in the mind of a PD that's not allowed because it isn't about them. lol. Truth is, your life is yours to live however you choose to live it. Happy birthday, man. I sincerely SINCERELY hope you start to start setting boundaries and make yourself and your kids the first priority. :) I say take this year as a sign that you gotta make sure you plan for you.

At the same time, you probably know by now that BPDs don't tolerate others being the center of attention.  I can relate to your situation.  One of the most despicable examples of my SO doing this was when my Son made his confirmation. My son's Father was recently deceased and my BPDSO (Stepfather) screamed at my son to shut up and stop complaining (son wasnt complaining but, teasing me) because HE (BPDS Stepfather) would give anything to be with his daughter (living with Mother at different location) at her confirmation.   BPD Stepfather had been at his daughters confirmation  2 years before and they were both alive. My son and I just looked at him like he was out of his mind.

We're working through a lot of things in our relationship but the hardest part has been his (my BPDSO's) inability to see past himself. I feel I've contributed to this by suppressing my feelings and enabling his behaviors by keeping quiet.  I'm not trying to bash myself too much because quite honestly, I've been damn good to him. Perhaps too good to him. I've recognized that part of why we're at the point we're at is because I haven't been upfront and honest about my emotions and how his actions make me feel. I tend to not want to cause friction because it makes me feel uncomfortable but in doing so, I've created a monster.  Have you tried talking with her in a non-judgmental, calm, assertive tone? Tell her how you felt. Don't argue or throw fuel on the fire. Don't stoop to her level and name call. But make your feelings known. Failure to do so means you'll bottle up these feelings of frustration and bitterness and eventually it will explode, perhaps at a not so ideal time down the line.   I can wholeheartedly identify with how you're feeling. We just had our 5 year anniversary. I gave him a really nice watch that I figured he'd keep for the rest of his life. He gave me a bar of scented soap and a ring and bracelet that literally looked like something out of a gumball machine. I'm not saying materialistic things are what make a relationship. But I'd be lying if I said the carelessness didn't hurt. I returned the jewelry so for my 5 year anniversary, I got a bar of soap.    Well happy birthday, I hope the time spent with your daughter and god-daughters made it a good day overall."
BPDlovedones,3av6tk,Ellisewyn,4,Tue Jun 23 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"I would think that it'll be ok. As you said, the relationship is already Internet-based and that won't change. If she reacts, just point that out. You may even pro-actively bring it up:  Hey! I'm do excited for this new opportunity where I'll be traveling to [places]. I can't wait to share my experiences with you -- watch for pics on FB soon!  Then you are bringing her along instead of leaving her behind."

You're right, something I used to do before was to downplay it, pretend like I was forced to do something and didn't really want to, to make it less hard on her, but I realize now it was pretty unhealthy. I think I'll follow your advice instead!  I think I'll suggest we use skype, so it'll actually improve the relationship. Thanks!"

BPDlovedones,3atpf3,Dikhoofd,2,Tue Jun 23 12:51:43 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already, get the book ""Splitting - protecting yourself in divorce with Borderline Personality Disorder"".  Also, try to document everything she says, especially things like  her comment about not following court orders she doesn't agree with.  One thing about divorcing a BPD is that they will hang themselves, just give them rope.  If you text her, ALWAYS be sure to be on your best behavior because she will have a copy too.   But if possible, get her to threaten you with more lies.    Say something like, ""Did I hurt you so badly that you'd be so ruthless as make up stories about me?""  If she takes the bait, she may very well respond that ""Yes you are rotten and she'll tell as many lies as it takes to get even with you for what you've done.""  Something along those lines.  Save it all if she outs herself as the manipulator she is.  When I went through my divorce my lawyer commented on how easy it was for her because my exbpdso did everything for her, painting herself in such a bad light.  good luck to you."
BPDlovedones,3atpf3,Churn,3,Tue Jun 23 17:25:22 2015 UTC,"I like the tactic of baiting her to admit lying, but that's better done in person, surreptitiously recording provided OP is in a one party consent state.  Much more likely to catch her off guard."
BPDlovedones,3atpf3,Soundboard_Fez,2,Wed Jun 24 12:55:10 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, it depends on how deep OP is in the F.O.G. of his BPDSO.  After 15 years with mine, I couldn't maintain composure in a face to face argument with her.  She was way too good at pushing my buttons and reading my face by this time.  So for me, interacting slowly over text messaging was much better."
BPDlovedones,3atpf3,Churn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"I can definitely stand the sight of her. She tries (such as picking up the kid at a point, pulling him out of my hands) but I make sure she's never alone.  She wants no contact at all anymore, tries to do everything via others. So I refuse. She's definitely trying to manipulate and I'm just talking to people, being open, showing emails and giving my point. She's lost support of my family, all of our mutual friends and I had a meeting with her dad last week. I'm thinking that if she has no one to validate herself she'll have to give in. If she doesn't, CPS will take care of the rest.   She's too smart to fall for outright traps like that, and I wouldn't want to, since I feel obligated to play fair for my son. I'm also quite sure she really doesn't want to hurt me, I think she just wants her own little life with our son without me in the picture.   She'll dig her own hole, I think. She did in court and I don't see why she would stop. It's hard as shit to keep composure though."

I asked her to go with me to fill out divorce papers to speed up the process, but she refused because ""I still love you"". I told her I wanted it done ASAP because I don't want to be held responsible if she gets in another drunken accident and my name is still on the title and loan of the vehicle. Within 2 hours the insurance company called and said they had totaled out the vehicle and were paying off the loan. That's 2 things I no longer have to worry about! She finally went to a doctor after several people told her to get go checked out after her accident. Broken shoulder, broken thumb, cracked rib. I feel bad for her because she's moving to another apartment in 4 days, and currently texting me about how difficult it is to pack with 1 arm. I asked her if she had anyone that could help, but they're all too busy. I mentioned a couple people thinking that she was too proud to ask anyone else for help...  Now I'm being called an asshole for reminding her she has no one? She really does make it easy to remember that her problems are HER problems."
BPDlovedones,3aqkv0,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"Congratulations first of all!   ...that may sound weird to hear, but man it sounds to me like you are doing every damn thing right!  You're doing great, self validating, not accepting abuse and breaking from the codependency these relationships seem to require.  I'm sorry that you feel guilty or worried about her, I mean you seem to at a healthy level it just sucks that you are watching her screw her life up.     Am I crazy to think that just by the tone in her voice, she was trying to make me feel bad for her situation and get me to do whatever she needed?   ^ This!  I really relate to this.  I always try to accrue it to my wife's cultural and first language difference, but after a decade I am certain there is more to it.  Tone is a big part of verbal communication.  Tone to me, is where the 'emotion' comes through, right?  Well these borderliners are an emotional bunch.  Dysregulating, overwhelmingly so.  I hear it come through sometimes.  It is accusatory or armageddon plea tone.  Sometimes it is understated..  To me the way her tone 'communicates' to me is to be dealt with like my own neurosis (because it is only as 'real' or unreal as I make it).  Meaning, it doesn't matter what she insinuates.  It doesn't matter that she says something in a mean or pleading way.  All that matters is I actively perceived it that way and what I do with it.    As much as we can't let our wife's accusations get through our armor- my wife has often accused me of being sensitive.  I'm really not, but I DO need to and try to be less sensitive to the negativity and with that even her tone.  When our relationship was MORE unhealthy and codependent, I hung on her every emotion.  I was hypervigilant.  I believe to some extent this 'issue' is me having trained myself to focus on and give weight to even her tone.  As a weak example.  She dumps our son on me very often.  Basically whenever I'm not working, which I could and sometimes do use boundaries with, but I really like spending time with him when not working- so it isn't an issue.  Anyway, she was out yesterday like everyday.. multiple times.  One time it was going to be her turn with him when he got up from a nap with me.  As she requested, I let her know when he was up.  She knew she needed formula.  Said she was getting it, didn't and went elsewhere (clothes shopping or something).  Well she left the formula out.  I tell her he is up (as she asked me to at that point) she says okay she was going to get formula, instead comes home.  Later she sees the formula out (where she put it) and opens it, sees it empty and in a very aggressive and accusatory tone says something about me getting it out, checking it, and knowing we were out (so I should have told her to get it even though he was up and I told her he was up as requested).  Her 'tone' was what pissed me off.  I told her I didn't get that out or check it.  Said what events took place as I did here.  I shouldn't have 'defended' myself and I didn't much, but her tone kind of pissed me off.    Ironically, these women while blind to their own 'tone' are EXTREMELY receptive to OUR tone.  Just the disappointment in my voice toward being accused of some nefarious plan in her head made her start escalating in circles on her BPD carousel.  ""Why am I so sensitive?"" ""I'm making a big deal of nothing"" On and on.. really I just stated I didn't get it out, didn't tell her to come home without formula, and it isn't a big deal to me, just didn't appreciate her assumption.  I let her watch our son and I went to go do my activity.  It didn't bother me any further, but the rest of the night she was a little bit upset.    Basically, I try to and need to be less affected by her tone.  Emotion pours out of these women and their tone is as dysregulated as their emotions.  Just as much of their manipulation isn't 'conscious' in the deepest sense (it is more them being manipulated by their BPD) I see similarly their tone isn't a conscious attempt to 'make us' feel or do something.  It just leaks out.  It is important however, as the 'bigger men' we think we are ;)  that as overcompensating they can be in tone in communication, we understand they are just as oversensitive to our tone.    I don't say that as if we need to caretake their perception with our tone, nor that we need to accept verbal abuse.  I'm just saying it is something I notice too, you aren't crazy, and the better we see through their behavior like this and control / balance our own... the better off we are in or out of these relationships."
BPDlovedones,3aqkv0,Shanguerrilla,2,Mon Jun 22 22:11:43 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense, I never thought of how she can't control the manipulative tone, but it's just a part of her BPD. The conversations Saturday night just had this sad puppy dog feel to them, and I just sat on the other end of the phone not fighting, or judging,  but just waiting for the conversation to be over with. Her voice just kinda of trailed off and got more sad puppy-ish, like she was waiting for me to say I'd come over.

BPDlovedones,3aqdr5,PuffTheAssholeDragon,5,Tue Jun 23 06:23:22 2015 UTC,"Being codependent doesn't say the abuse is fine. In fact, it says that the codependence actually gets in the way of the victim recognizing the abuse for what it really is, to the point that it paralyzes the person.   I was in a classic codependent-bpd relationship. My wife has abused me in multiple ways, and I didn't let her face consequences for that due to my codependence. Standing up for myself means me accepting this is unacceptable abuse, that i don't serve it, and taking ACTION to stop this. Ending the codependence doesn't pardon her abuse. It just gives me more strength and options to end the abuse than before."
BPDlovedones,3aqdr5,cookieredittor,4,Tue Jun 23 13:15:41 2015 UTC,"It can be both.    I enabled a lot of bad behavior out of ignorance.  I carry a lot of guilt and shame because of this.  At the same time, I wasn't trying to do harm.  I was extending undeserved trust, and I didn't understand the danger of that.    I've talked with therapists, and they often repeat that I shouldn't blame myself for what I didn't understand at the time.  Those words ring hollow.  I'm smart, I can do a lot of amazing things, but I wasn't smart enough when I needed to be.    The relationship I had with my ex wife was co-dependent.  I needed to provide support to feel good about myself.  If I don't fix that, I'll just fall in with another manipulative person.    My ex's mom also had a codependent relationship with my ex.  I don't think my ex-law will ever understand that, though.  She's very easily offended by slights real and imagined.  Her histrionic behavior folded right in with my ex's BPD.  They magnified each other's issues in ways that were terrifying."
BPDlovedones,3aqdr5,Halafax,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:08:44 2015 UTC,"It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be about realizing ones own culpability in their own relationships and cycle of abuse. Yes, if you have someone with a personality disorder you may end up abused but that doesn't mean that you aren't trying to steer the situation to benefit you when what you should be doing is focusing on yourself. If anything it takes it out of being abuser/victim and makes it so that the non PD personality is able to focus on themselves and decide whether or not to stay and not based on manipulation or guilt by either party."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,FrancisOfOlivia,9,Mon Jun 22 14:54:09 2015 UTC,"I've said this many times to others in your situation.  You need to process this...  There is NO WAY to be in a healthy relationship with someone who has BPD and goes untreated.  The ONLY way you can live with her is to give up your view of reality and accept hers.  In doing this, you lose your own sense of self over time and become less and less of who you once were.  Meanwhile, you are an ""enabler"" who validates her world view so that she can continue to believe there is nothing wrong with herself, it's everyone else that is screwed up, including you.  So there is no reason for her to seek help or even admit she has an issue requiring treatment.  From a mental health standpoint, she doesn't change while you get worse and worse over time.  This never ends well.  The sooner you get out, the better for both of you.  You will start getting healthier with the removal of the BPD F.O.G manipulations, and she will lose another enabler from her life.  This might spur her to finally get help, but most likely she will quickly move onto another victim that she will idealize in the begining, victimize and vilify in the end."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Churn,5,Mon Jun 22 16:25:40 2015 UTC,"She goes to a therapist. She has tried all of the BPD medication that there is available, but all give unacceptible side effects or actually make her worse. Abilify came close, making the episodes less frequent, but it made the roller coaster of her emotions even steeper with much more extreme episodes and it paired with insomnia and an insatiable hunger.  I dont consider myself unhealthy. I have learned enough about this disorder to see that anything she says or does during an episode is not her. It is just the disorder taking control of her mind. I believe I can handle anything she throws at me because of this and have for the last 4 years.  When she recovers, she is remorseful. She knows she has a problem and wants to fix it, she just does not know how. I think i might be making things worse for her by being codependant, but I just don't know how to stop without putting her in danger."

You see your ability to handle anything she throws at you as a virtue, it's very much the opposite, by accepting her rage, you validate her behavior and her view that she is ok.  You my friend, are an enabler.  Source: I was married to my untreated exBPDSO for 15 years.  When I finally divorced her it was pure hell as she really went over the deep end.   Within a week of the divorce being final, she attempted suicide multiple times with pills, then finally with razor blades.  After being released from the hospital, she refused to get help, her few family members who tried to help her have now abandoned her after she lashed out at them trying to get them fired from their jobs, and at one point shooting a gun at her own daughter with her grandchildren present because they wouldn't get off her property.  While the specifics of my situation are unique, the process and behaviors are not when it comes to untreated BPD's.  They will go to extremes to not get help, using many different excuses for not taking meds, and manipulating you into going along to get along.  I wish you nothing but the best of luck."

BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Shanguerrilla,3,Mon Jun 22 17:37:14 2015 UTC,"There aren't really any medicines for BPD.. but there are meds that can help with some of the comorbid mental issues (like depression, anxiety, psychosis).    I really relate a lot to your statements in the rest of this comment.  I agree too that the codependency makes things worse.  I disagree with /u/Churn (though the line is blurred with 'untreated' BPD's, not that your SO is) I think it is possible to be self validating, emotionally strong, and NOT an enabler with a BPD SO.. I simply think it is very difficult and taxing.  In my experience the only way to not walk on the eggshells of codependency is to walk a tightrope between 'greater-good empathy' and narcissistic firmness.  To be selflessly selfish.  We have to take care of our own needs, be completely unmoved in their storms, face down the threats, accept the things we cannot control, not chase them when they are banging things, screaming, or begging for chaos (and not put up with it)... to constantly make them accountable and face their own consequences...  This is VERY difficult, but in my opinion as 'empathetic' to her as I thought I was before, in truth that codependency was inverted empathy or inverted narcissism.. caretaking what I never could to be her savior (while handicapping her or leaving her handicapped).  To me, this more difficult path is the only way to truly be empathetic to her needs.  Like a child screaming about what they 'want', she often confuses and misses what she truly needs.    I really agree with you.  The problem is that   I just don't know how to stop without putting her in danger.   Well, you aren't the one putting her in that danger.  Not caretaking her emotions is not putting her in danger- she is.  She needs to face that if she has a chance of moving forward.  The flipside to that ambiguous description I gave of 'walking that tightrope' is that we can NEVER be needy.  We have to be self fueled and understand we will never have the kind of support most healthy partners are able to receive."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Tastygroove,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"Ironically, me asking her for help actually seems to improve her mood as it maked her feel useful. I have to be grateful for it, though. If i start getting complacent, thinking that since she does not have a job, she should at least keep the house clean as her job, it does not go well. Ask her for help, say thank you, notice when she does something (laundry, vacuum, whatever) and thank her for that as well. I dont think that would be considered codependant.  I agree that the times that I cave to her unreasonale demands during her episodes is not good for her. I am still working on the ""validate emotions, but dont agree with her"" thing. It is especially tough when i know some wrongdoing happened (for example USPS lost her package), but she way overreacts and goes into an uncontrollable rage about it that always somehow gets redirected at me. I agree that she was wronged, but disagree on how she is handling the situation.  I am on that tightrope you mentioned trying to find the proper balance. I know I need to improve myself to be the order in the chaos of her mind during these episodes. It is difficult, but I have to learn the best way to deal with her in order best help her."

BPDlovedones,3apsqf,DreadlordCherryCake,6,Tue Jun 23 03:00:00 2015 UTC,"Man, I'm so sorry you're going through this. Sounds like you are being abused and manipulated and sucked into a horrible chaos. I feel for you because I've been there. Honestly, I could have written every word of this post...this sounds exactly like my ex-wife, right down to the vacuuming thing and keeping you up all night.   I relate to the feeling of helplessness too. She has you feeling like you're check-mated. If you don't do what she wants she goes off on you. You can't set a boundary and stick up for yourself because she explodes and either hurts you or threatens suicide. It's easier to just give in. You don't want to call the police or have her committed when she threatens suicide because of the expense and police/legal trouble. So you feel like you're stuck letting her treat you like shit whenever she has an episode and being miserable.   Here's a few things I want to say to you. From some of your responses elsewhere I think you might be adverse to some of what I'm going to say, but I'm asking you to seriously consider these thoughts.   You don't deserve any of this. Let that sink in. All the things she says to you, the ways she tears you down, none of it is true. You are not the cause of any stress in her life. BPD is not an excuse for any of the ways you are treated, she is responsible for her actions. You deserve to be healthy and have peace in your life. You deserve a relationship where you are respected and loved and not abused.  By staying and accepting the way that you are treated, you are telling her that you are ok with it. You are reinforcing her horrible mistreatment of you by continuing to just take it and not make her face any consequences for her actions.  Personally, I put up with 5+ years of this, until she cheated on me the 3rd time. After getting out of the situation and seeing things clearly, I wish I would have left so much earlier. The infidelity was the reason I ultimately was pushed over the edge, but I should have never put up with verbal and physical abuse for so long. I don't want to tell anyone to stay or leave. I just want to share that I, like you, was 100% against leaving and did not even consider it until nearly the end. I could have saved myself years of abuse and chaos and unhappiness if I had trusted myself and gotten out sooner and in retrospect I wish I had. That's just my story though. I think you owe it to yourself to at least consider this with an open mind. If you want to stay - As far as stopping being codependent, I think this first step is going to be really hard. I would strongly recommend moving out for a period of time. It sounds like she is in therapy and trying to work on this...this step may be helpful to coordinate with the therapist. Especially if her go-to thing is to threaten suicide. I think if you describe it as a move for both of you to do together get healthy and work on yourselves she may be more open to it. Do this in the light of day when she seems stable and have a plan for if she blows up, etc. If moving out for a time is not an option, set a boundary (no screaming, hitting, keeping you awake at night) and stick to it. Be prepared for the suicide threats, etc. You need a plan. I know you don't want to call the police but if she is threatening suicide then that is the only thing you can do. You need to value yourself and your boundaries above the nightmare that will be dealing with police and courts. It will suck to go through but you are worth it. Honestly, this situation is a ticking time bomb and you are putting yourself in danger of getting into legal trouble if the cops are called and she says you hurt her (this is a very common BPD behavior). You need to call the police and she has to face the consequences...BPD is no excuse for anything. Without the consequence she is only going to keep doing this, forever. Other users here may have some good advice on dealing with this and have gone through a lot of this stuff. (u/cookieredittor, u/Shanguerrilla)   One more thing which you probably know, but...this was not about the vacuuming. It was about seeing what you would put up with, creating chaos in your life, causing you to mistrust yourself, and a tool for her to keep control over you and every aspect of your life.  Good luck man, you're in for a long hard road still no matter what. Use this sub as a resource and support, it's been helpful to me and many others."

I know i don't deserve any of it just as someone in the path of a tornado deserves to have their house destoryed. It is just the risk that they take building in tornado alley just as it is the risk I take living with someone suffering from BPD.  I am trying to set boundaries. It is a work in progress and I am fairly new at trying to learn how to hone her episodes and teach her self management. She is back to normal as of last night, so I will try to sit down and talk with her after work so I can clearly state what I will do when she goes over the edge again.  I am lucky enough that infedelity is not one of my wife's issues. That is definately something that I would not tolerate and have made it clear from the beginning that even a single act of cheating would result in our perminant seperation. She has threatened to cheat occasionally during her episodes, but never takes action on it because she knows this deep down.   I made an ""escape bag"" last night for the next extreme episode. I plan on turning off my phone and getting a hotel for a couple days if she gets that bad again. My only question is how will i know when it is safe for me to return?  I have read what u/cookieredittor wrote concerning his 3 lessons. I will read what the other user wrote today when I have time."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Cranberry_Lips,7,Tue Jun 23 12:25:00 2015 UTC,"A few things I recommend: 1.) Seek therapy for yourself. You are aware of your own codependent nature, and it's going to be a problem until you address it. If not this, then either find a CoDA meeting and start reading. Start to let yourself have your own life. 2.) Next time she does this? Call the police anyway. I know your experience is telling you that this is expensive/etc, but you're the one who's putting yourself out for this. Why? Even if she doesn't have insurance, in the US, most hospitals have to take her anyway and have to come up with treatment. Yes obviously without health insurance this becomes expensive, but even then, you can pay it over a long time if necessary. The problem here is that you're assuming the role of caretaker and protector but it's eating your life away. It's not a perfect system but it's there because you by yourself aren't able to give her treatment, all you can do is watch and let your life become that of a martyrs. That's awful. Please don't do that."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Cranberry_Lips,3,Mon Jun 22 17:21:40 2015 UTC,"God almighty.  You are in an unsafe and dangerous relationship. She is a danger to herself and to you. For your own physical safety you have to get away ASAP. She needs a mental health evaluation. Better yet, she should be admitted to a psychiatric unit in a hospital.  If you want to stop being codependent then you have to start valuing your life. Leave the house, find a therapist, and if you're not going to have her admitted to a hospital, then get a restraining order and get away before you get maimed or killed intentionally or accidentally.  If you have any friends or family around (that she hasn't managed to completely push away), go to them and tell them everything. They will help you if you can't bring yourself to do it. I know it's the hardest thing you will ever have to do. I've been through it. Your life is important and you're worth it."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Cranberry_Lips,2,Mon Jun 22 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"I have had her committed 3 times before, but it is extremely expensive to do and it only temporarily stabilizes her. Nothing long term.  I never felt that my life was in danger from this, only hers. She turned the knife on herself, not me."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,cookieredittor,6,Mon Jun 22 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"BPD takes years of therapy. How long are you willing to allow her to physically, emotionally, and psychologically abuse you like this? You have not done anything to deserve this. You deserve to have a life. You deserve to be happy and do things that make you happy.   Codependecy is incredibly harmful because it makes you think you have no value unless you're making her happy. The worst combination in the world is a BPD/codependent relationship. She has been taking advantage of you because you're the easiest person to be taken advantage of.  If she had Ebola, would you go kiss her because you think you deserve to get it, as well? So you can die together because life isn't worth living without her? Or would you make sure she got the help she needed and stayed the fuck away until she got better?   You want to stop being codependent? Start doing something for yourself for a change. You've been reading the forums, now show us some action."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Churn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"Well, that I kind of why I am here. I showed action and was met with suicide. I dont want to invilve police. What else can I do?"
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Cranberry_Lips,2,Mon Jun 22 16:42:52 2015 UTC,You get away and stay away. You can't help her. You're making her worse by allowing her to continue to have her way with you.   You're unable to set boundaries and you've proven it to her. Next time you say no she will do something worse. She'll keep doing worse and worse things until you give in. Maybe next time she will cut herself and blame you for it.   My ex told me one time he wanted to kill himself just so I can find him dead and realize I was the one that did it to him.  You are unable to think straight because of her. Get away as soon as possible. No excuses. No waiting for a better day. Do it now and spend the money you would have spent on her hospital and hire a lawyer and a therapist for yourself.
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Churn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:00:26 2015 UTC,"That is an option and it is something that is on the table, but I feel it's kind of a last resort. I honestly feel like she's bluffing when she threatens suicide, but I don't want to call her on it just in case. If she ever does inflict self harm , then I will probably leave her for her own good ."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Churn,2,Mon Jun 22 17:05:16 2015 UTC,"No you won't. You have let her abuse and take advantage of you so far. A suicide attempt will make you stay even more.   She's more likely to leave you when she gets bored and stops having her way, and then, you'll be heart broken as well as alone. I know you love her and you'll do anything for her, but the best thing you can do to help her and to help yourself is to leave her."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Shanguerrilla,2,Mon Jun 22 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"You want to stop being codependent? Then, take action. Do involve police. She is using weapons, threatening herself and you. She actually hurt you with a knife. When you realize how you can't handle this as it is, and police, professionals, etc are essential on your side, you will stop enabling her, and will start changing things.   Overtime you say ""What can i do, but i don't want to do X"", X is the right thing to do, and refusing to do X is just you being codependent. Go to a therapists, they will help you make sense of the BPD chaos, and plan for it in new ways you can't do right now. Stop enabling. Stop the pattern. Clearly what you are doing isn't making things better. Go to a therapist. You don't have a PD, so you can change quickly and improve things that way."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Shanguerrilla,4,Tue Jun 23 08:14:28 2015 UTC,"I never felt that my life was in danger from this, only hers. She turned the knife on herself, not me.   In the psychiatric ward they have a saying, ""If a person is suicidal, they are homicidal.""  If she doesn't care about hurting herself, she won't give two flips about hurting someone else."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Shanguerrilla,2,Mon Jun 22 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"While she has hit me, scratched me, and bit me in the past, she has never attempted to attack me with a weapon or in any way that could perminantly hurt me. This is only the second time that she has actively attempted to hurt herself (the first is when I called the police), but both times occured when I was attempting to set boundries.   Normally, as long as I work though it with her, conceade on her demands when I can, and try to actively calm her down for hours (usually looong into the night), she doesnt get this bad. It seems anytime I try to set a boundry or suggest that she help herself get better rather than relying on me is when she starts getting worse.   If I leave the house, my phone gets flooded with texts saying that she is going to kill herself. Should I just leave her be and call her bluff?"
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,ijustneedahug,3,Mon Jun 22 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"This is how you deal with suicidal people. When she tells you she's going to kill herself, you ask her how she's going to do it. When she tells you, you call 911 and tell them she's threatening suicide and that she has a plan. Ambulance comes and takes her to the hospital.   Do this every single time she tells you she's going to kill herself."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,ijustneedahug,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"Done that before. It is extremely expensive to pay to have her commited and if she has a weapon or is aggressive, the laws in my state force a police responce which forces charges to be filed which means a court hearing.  I do not want that to happen again. I will not call the police."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,ButterflyToenail,3,Mon Jun 22 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"Should I just leave her be and call her bluff?   Yes.  Because you need to leave her and go completely No Contact.  There is a reason you see so many discussion here referring to ""no contact"" and that's because she will do anything to regain control of you after you leave.  Her abandonment issues will flair up to uncontrollable levels and she'll escalate her behavior until she gets what she wants (which is you back under her control).  If she threatens you, call the police.  Do not respond to her.  If she threatens herself, call the police/medics.  Do not respond to her."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,DreadlordCherryCake,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:09:36 2015 UTC,"I'll try this next time minus the police. It's something that I've had issues with because I need my phone for work, but turning it off for a day or so probably would not be a big deal in that case."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,DreadlordCherryCake,3,Mon Jun 22 17:11:18 2015 UTC,"It's very hard to go No Contact.  I know, I've been there and broken it myself many times only to regret it each time.  She's been learning to manipulate you for 4 years, she's an expert as this is like breathe to her.  She knows better than anyone exactly what to say to get a response from you.  Whether it's to say you said or promised something you didn't just to get you to respond in an effort to clarify what you actually said.  Or she accuses you of something you didn't do, again to get you to respond to clear your name.  Or she threatens to tell someone else you care about (parents, boss, friends) that you did or said something that you didn't so that you'll respond to her to stop her from doing it.  If you go ""no contact"" she will ensure that there are consequences, but in the end, it's the only way out.  Getting out, is the only/best way you can help her.  If she finally realizes she drove you off and decides to get  help, great!  If she doesn't get help, even after losing you...then she never would have gotten better while you were there either."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,cookieredittor,3,Mon Jun 22 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"but both times occured when I was attempting to set boundries.   That is not a coincidence... That then is EXACTLY what you NEED to do AND succeed at!  With my wife it was similar, the most explosive tantrums have been times that I share my feelings.  That wasn't 'allowed' when I was codependent.  I don't see the benefit in sharing my feelings often with her still, but I do when I must and I certainly am learning or improving at HAVING feelings again.  I was so brainwashed before from the abuse that would come if I'd dare have feelings.  The thing that incited this rage- that is the thing you must be able to do.  You must be able to have feelings and enact boundaries.  If you do not have healthy boundaries than you do not have a relationship at all.   If I leave the house, my phone gets flooded with texts saying that she is going to kill herself. Should I just leave her be and call her bluff?   Yes!  Exactly that.  Her actions, her consequence."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,cookieredittor,2,Mon Jun 22 21:05:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. I have made an ""escape bag"" and plan to just leave next time it gets this bad."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Shanguerrilla,5,Tue Jun 23 12:45:01 2015 UTC,"First off, WOW.. I'm so sorry that you are dealing with such pain, hurt, and abuse and I'm very sorry for the guilt and pain you feel seeing your loved one hurt so greatly.    In that situation I think it was entirely the wrong time to negotiate.  My wife never self harmed and has only made advances to try to physically abuse me.. I believe she understands the moment she touches me with ill-intent that I will leave her.  I think she might be worried I would hurt her, at most I'd defend myself, but it would end our marriage.  We all have lines that we won't allow crossed, we need to decide for ourselves where those lines are.  So in my VERY fallible mind, looking only at what 'we' can do (and not our SO's out of control behavior 'we' can't control)..  In that moment of disregulation you need to remind yourself that it isn't the time for logic, exposition, or negotiation.  You are at that point dealing with an adult (all the strength, danger, abilities) who has reverted to toddler-teenager level of emotional chaos and an actual childlike tantrum.  You can't negotiate with your terrorist.    I second /u/RudolphRed 's great advice and I really recommend reading some of /u/cookieredittor 's posts.  Especially look to his ""Hacking the disorder"" submissions, they were unspeakably helpful to me.  During that tantrum and rage you dealt with, I really recommend much of this link and the links therein.  One link included there is about SET .  I cannot guarantee that you can 'calm' your SO when she is so disregulated, but I can say that I have experienced times my wife was splitting and on the verge of the tantrums of old, when using Support Empathize Truth, holding FIRM on the truth, while supporting her, validating her emotions, empathizing with what I can.. has honestly been like a rock in her storm.  I've seen her calm and regulate and stop splitting.  I can't control that though, so having a plan, using techniques, and employing conscious consideration for my communication (verbal and nonverbal) really helps: ME, either way.  The moment she hits you, I'd recommend NOT allowing it, never, not at all!  You remove yourself.  You can't control her, clearly you could 'stop' her or hurt her, but you don't desire to.  Using my likely wrong amateur Freudian skills, I wonder if she WANTS you to hurt her.  She wants to self harm, she feels guilty and horrible and she desires being 'punished'.  I'd suggest immediately removing yourself during such an attack.  If you don't have kids, go stay with a friend or at a hotel.  You can't 'let' her abuse you like that.  It won't get it out of her system, it helps her up the track of an emotional roller coaster (they typically go for a ride after reaching the top).    Couch coaching, not in the situation, what I think I would do if my wife was behaving like that then going for knives to cut herself.  I'd let her.  I'm not God, I can't protect her from herself all the time.  I'd rather she do it while I'm home, then I'd call an ambulance and have her committed after being stabalized.  I have very VERY little faith in the police for male victims of domestic abuse.  I trust the mental health system to keep her a lot better in that scenario (because it IS a mental health issue).  You need to protect yourself.  You were cut trying to save her, but what if you were cut worse- or what if in the tussle she caught a fatal blow?  I suspect you might be a homicide suspect at that point.  In any event, you chasing her and struggling with knives with her is only adding fuel to a dangerous fire.  Basically, as ridiculously difficult as this sounds- whatever actions you take to protect YOURSELF (we can't save them) and to MAKE her face her own consequences.. those are typically the best in the life of a BPDSO.  Anything else is a crutch that makes sure she never learns to walk on her own.    Lastly, you shouldn't have vacuumed the damn house after this!  Truly, I can commiserate.  I haven't gone through exactly the same ordeal, but I've seen my share of disregulation and irrational expectations.  The whole ordeal reminds me of MANY times my wife escalated / escalated / escalated in an effort to practice and exercise her 'control' over me.  MANY TIMES I would think, I sure don't care about doing X for her (like vacuuming) as dealing with this insanity shitstorm.  Here's the thing though, no matter how far we go, no matter how perfectly we practice codependency, we only make the overarching problems worse.  We cannot regulate their emotions.  It is quite literally, impossible- even 'they' cannot, we have NO chance!    To answer your question    What can I do (other than just leaving her which I dont want to do) to stop being codependant?   Be WILLING to end this relationship.  You don't have to leave her, you have to be willing to lose or leave her.  The only way to 'save' her is to stop trying to save her and make her responsible for that.  I understand how much it would hurt if she succeeds in hurting herself, but do you know what?  That wouldn't be your choice or your fault.  You aren't omnipotent.  In truth, my sister is also BPD (diagnosed and all... I didn't realize it was BPD specifically until after getting to the end of the rope with my wife and talking to her about it).  Well, I can still remember vividly the bloodcurdling scream as a teen waking me up.  I run out to the kitchen and see my sister digging (the correct way, vertically) around in each wrist.  A pool of blood over the white tile our mom kept so clean.  I stopped her, parents helped hold the bleeding, we get her to a hospital and soon had her committed.  She had many attempts and the memory doesn't leave, but she HAD TO get to a point of learning safer coping methods.  She had to deal with her own consequences.  She had to begin being responsible for her own disorder and she had to fight it.  We sure couldn't save her from herself.  She is alive and well today and really flourishing.  She's a great and compassionate mother and a nurse who FIGHTS ten times harder and loves the old people in her nursing home MORE than any 'non' in that place.  These aren't 'bad' people, borderliners are overwhelmed and need to pick up their own fight for their life.. we can't carry it for them (or they never will).  To me that is fundamentally where to begin moving out of codependency and the best thing we can do as loved ones.  We have to let them face their own consequences, we have to not LET them abuse us, we have to let them hurt themselves to learn, improve, and grow.  They are emotional children (especially sometimes, like in tantrums) and they need that tough love from us.  They need us to self validate and stare down their threats.  If and when they cross a line that we cannot accept, then they need us to leave them for it.  I love my wife and I believe we 'can' make it..  but my happiness and future isn't held hostage by the outcomes I cannot control.  I can't do everything so perfectly that she doesn't cross that line for me.  I love her too much to let her abuse me or ruin her own life.  She wouldn't hit her bottom if I kept catching her and I won't live on the bottom with her.  She and many borderliners, against how it seems to us sometimes, are overburdened with grief and guilt.  I only add to that when I focus my life on her, or let her abuse me.  She could tell when I was emotionally responsible for her, I HUNG on her every emotion and made myself responsible- it was damaging to her since even she cannot regulate them.  She doesn't need me to add to her grief, guilt, and emotions like that, she has enough as it is."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Shanguerrilla,2,Mon Jun 22 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice   Be WILLING to end this relationship.  You don't have to leave her, you have to be willing to lose or leave her.   This worked for me. She was still having an episode and threatened divorce as she commonly does, so I just simply agreed with her and told her that I would go get the papers Friday. She suddenly got quiet, so I left her alone for a bit. A few minutes later, she is back at me trying to work things out.  Maybe I have found a new strategy. I hope it continues to work as effectively. Thank you!"
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,vonbear,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:07:36 2015 UTC,"She will test any boundaries you set, she will also test you.  I'm glad that helped, but my wife had to really really KNOW I was done with divorce threats, I don't even accept the insinuation any longer...  I was sick of it.  I'd rather be single than blackmailed any longer.    Be prepared for challenges on this and any boundaries or anything important to you.  You will always fail in lose/lose scenarios they create, we cannot participate."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,vonbear,2,Tue Jun 23 13:22:26 2015 UTC,"My wife has gone so far as to prepare the divorce papers once. All it needed was my signature to be final. I am actually curious to see if I really sign it what she would do. I don't want to divorce her, but I have decided (with a bit of perspective from you guys) that I will not try to stop her if she wants to go through with it and just sign the papers. I am hopng that she wont actually file the papers before she starts feeling better."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,MrThrowawayMonster,3,Tue Jun 23 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"If someone, BPD or not, threatens you verbally, call the police and start working towards getting out of that situation. She's threatened you physically, with a weapon, I'd say that's more than enough to warrant calling the police and do what is necessary to protect your own life.  My ex threatened me verbally, repeatedly, but I was deep in it and couldn't think straight. The last few times she did this to me I feared for my life....thankfully I'm no longer in that situation."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,MrThrowawayMonster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"She threatened harm on herself with the knife, not me.  I have called the police once before when I thought that she was getting out of hand. It did not have a good result at all. I avoid calling them now."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,Tastygroove,2,Mon Jun 22 15:33:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear about your situation but I think the idea here is your health and your safety at risk. You're in denial of you think that just because she has threatened herself doesn't mean she won't threaten you. It may have not happened...yet...but eventually it will. More importantly, your personal health in this situation is important over hers. If you succumb and turn into her your relationship is destined to implode."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,cookieredittor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:19:21 2015 UTC,Did it have a bad result because of how she reacted to the situation or because of how the emergency responders handled it?
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,cookieredittor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:35:10 2015 UTC,How the emergency responders handled it. The laws in my state are not forgiving to people with mental disorders.
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,cookieredittor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:43:33 2015 UTC,"I am curious as to what this means? The laws are meant to protect people from themselves and yes, they can get a bit heavy handed if the person is actively threatening themselves? I personally went through a few times of this so I am curious about your situation and what you mean when you say they didn't handle it well?"
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,cookieredittor,2,Mon Jun 22 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"When the police and ambulance came, they were met with the side of my wife actively biting me on the arm.  They told her to let go , and when she didn't, they tackled her, held her on the floor, and took her away in a squad car.  I told him I did not want to press any charges, but they said they are required to by state law. they also found bruise marks where I held her arms and attempted to charge me as well. They were going to lock her up for a month, but I was able to get her therapist to talk them into just admitting her to the mental hospital.  I had to pay for her hospital stay out of my own pocket which was a few thousand dollars as well as the court fees to persuade the judge with the help of the therapist that both I and her should not be charged. I also had to hire a lawyer for that.  She is not an American citizen , so her green card was at risk. I had to hire another lawyer for that and was lucky I was able to get that cleared up. it's possible the next offense could cause her to be deported."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,cookieredittor,2,Mon Jun 22 17:29:03 2015 UTC,"You have assumed quite a bit of risk here. I am going to hazard a guess and say that there are some boundaries you have not set with your wife. The cold truth is that if her green card is an issue, then there's something about this that hasn't been dealt with. Why hasn't she gotten her US citizenship? Is it pending? There's quite a bit of this that seems not dealt with, so before everything it's time to get the situation sorted. Also, if for some reason she does this again and she ends up deported keep in mind that it isn't your job to save her. It isn't. You can try, but everyone has to do it for themselves. The problem in all of this is that you not holding firm or seeking treatment or finding a sticking place of boundaries is problematic. If there aren't consequences to her behavior then you're just enabling this crazy, and if there are that many problems standing in the way of her getting treatment? Then maybe it's time to address those problems. I get that BPD is insidious but you're either going to fall on this sword or you're going to get thrown on it if something doesn't change. It's time to start deciding what you want for your life, and if it's not this crazy then you need to find a way to be your own advocate."
BPDlovedones,3apsqf,dinosaurs_r_awesome,2,Mon Jun 22 17:35:21 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me they handled it very well, you are just trying to enable her disfunction, and they forced consequences on her. The only way for her to get better is to face consequences so she decides to work more on her issue. While you are trying to protect her from consequences, you are Enabling, and making things worse for her and you.  It seems like many times here you ask ""How can I stop being codependent, except, i'm not going to stop enabling her"". Well, enabling her IS being codependent."
BPDlovedones,3aqco1,MrThrowawayMonster,6,Mon Jun 22 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"I'm going through this.  Listen to me, for the sake of your children: Read the book ""Splitting: Protecting Yourself While Divorcing Someone with Borderline"" NOW. These false accusations can and will come haunt you if you don't lawyer up and fight them effectively, so stay synchronized with the lawyer as you read the book. In that process, if you miss a step, she can get more power over the kids. These kids need you as the sane anchor in their lives.  Don't delay. Act now. This is an emergency. Do it for your kids."
BPDlovedones,3aqco1,cookieredittor,4,Mon Jun 22 19:20:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the book reference. Rest assured that I have an amazing lawyer who has been giving me great advice and protecting me in the long term.
BPDlovedones,3aqco1,cookieredittor,2,Mon Jun 22 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"The book is also in Audiobook, if that fits better your lifestyle.  I can tell you that I'm going throw a high-conflict separation right now. The book has warned me about some things, even predicting some others with incredible accuracy. Because of this, reading the book was very stressful for me: it felt too close to my life, at times, it was too scary. However, I'm really glad I did, as it has strengthen my position significantly. Without it, and a good lawyer that has experience with BPD people, I'm sure that by now I would have made terrible mistakes, giving her stuff I shouldn't have, creating terrible precedents that she wanted to use to separate me from son.   She has tried threats, blackmail based on complete lies, intimidation, then acting as if she was reasonable, all the time changing. She is trying to ruin my reputation as well. This stuff is very hard, but all I can do is be strong, stay strong, and keep going, for my son. At first, all that chaos she started in so many levels was very scary, to the point i felt weak and helpless. But by getting informed, talking to the lawyers, government offices, etc, slowly, i've realized how strong my position really is. Now i'm nervous, but i don't feel helpless, i feel strong even within my fear.  At the beginning when i felt helpless, and was talking to the experts and reading the book, i feel like i wasn't doing anything, and this frustrated me even more. However, looking back, that was the best thing to do, and it helped me immensely. To manage their chaos the best is to have a strong solid position, NOT to be scared and moved by their chaos, but to respond in a strong, assertive and reasonable way. The way to beat their chaotic storm is to be a rock unmoved by it.  One thing that sounds counterintuitive is that through all this, you will feel very overwhelmed and exhausted by the chaos. You need to take time, do little things for your well being. Just like a boxer rests well before Fight day, you must budget time for this. This is hard, but it is essential. It was hard for me to figure out what to do for myself in these circumstances, as it all sounded wasteful and shallow, but I'm glad I figured stuff out. Just recovering emotional energy has been crucial to stay focused on what is important. If you want to brain storm things you can do, let me know.  The fight is still ongoing, some of the hardest battles are coming very soon for me.   Stay strong, for your kids. Know that here we understand what you are going through."
BPDlovedones,3aqco1,cookieredittor,2,Tue Jun 23 06:48:20 2015 UTC,"Even though we had a meeting, and I told her there was ""absolutely no way"" that the kids would move with her, and even after my lawyer subsequently told hers on two occasions that it is ""off the table"", she still sent a settlement agreement asking for permission to move with the kids.  The agreement was worded in a way that made it sound like she ""wanted to take time to decide on a divorce"", but I called her father, and he told me that she said her plan was to take the kids away, let some time pass so that their residence is legally established, and then file for a divorce. It's heartbreaking that the mother of my children is willing to lie, take me to court, make up false accusations, take my children away, and treat me like I'm nothing all just to avoid TALKING to me.   I hate this stupid disorder, I hate that I now have to treat her as an enemy to me and a threat to my children. But I love the growth I've experience, and I really love this group. Knowing that there are others that have been through this and much worse gives me strength to push forward. In comparison to many of you guys here, I haven't really had it that bad, and having just stumbled upon an amazing lawyer since the beginning has really prevented me from making many of the mistakes.  Thanks for the support. I'll keep updating as I get it."
BPDlovedones,3aauyw,lifetapped,10,Thu Jun 18 16:37:02 2015 UTC,"Without knowing much about this situation, it seems like she's not quite ready to be in a relationship, based on her behavior. If she's dealing with that much sadness and missing her ex, I'd venture that she's not going to be committed to a level that you deserve. I think most people would be pretty bothered by this behavior and would have reason to worry why their SO is constantly wanting to contact an ex. If her ex did decide to talk to her, what would her limits be on that relationship? Would you be ok with a girlfriend who has a male best friend that she used to be in a relationship with? If her ex decided he wanted her back, would she dump you for him? And if so, are you ok with being someone's second-best option? I'm jumping to a lot of conclusions here, but these are just questions it might be good to ask yourself. My advice is to have a serious talk with her about whether she will be able to let go of that past relationship and focus on you. Moving on takes a while for anyone, and could be especially hard for someone with abandonment issues like a BPD. But if she wants to be in a relationship with you then she needs to make that the priority."
BPDlovedones,3aauyw,RudolphRed,9,Thu Jun 18 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"I know you don't want to hear this...but you need to get out of this relationship, it is unhealthy for you both, but mostly for you.    If you stay with someone with BPD who remains untreated you become an enabler who gives up his own sense of reality in exchange for theirs.  This reinforces their warped world view that it is everyone else with a problem and that they are fine.  Because of your reinforcement she won't seek help because she won't accept that she has a problem.  You on the other hand, will slip into deeper and deeper brainwashing at her hands, you won't come out the same when it all comes crumbling down.   Ask any of us who have been where you are.  source:  Divorced my BPDSO after 15 years.  It's been 2+ years and I have still not fully recovered."
BPDlovedones,3aauyw,Churn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:20:30 2015 UTC,Totally agree.  Thanks for your testimony.  Heed this real life example.
BPDlovedones,3aauyw,wewewawa,5,Fri Jun 19 07:11:56 2015 UTC,"Realize there's a reason that he has blocked her on multiple accounts.  Stay in this relationship much longer, and that will probably be the best case scenario for your own future.  You might want to consider the possibility that you have your own codependency issues as well.  Not trying to be a dick, I've just been there and done that.  You can't fix them, and they will destroy you."

BPDlovedones,3aauyw,way2manycooks,2,Thu Jun 18 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"Accept that she might love you, but also, she is steel deeply attached to him. Accept that she might always go to sleep crying over him and thinking about him. You can't change that. Since this won't change, think if this is what you want in your relationship."
BPDlovedones,3aauyw,cookieredittor,2,Thu Jun 18 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"This behavior is not ok. You need to think about why you are compromising your dignity and allowing yourself to be used as 2nd rate. In addition, why are you not disturbed by the huge red flags of her ex blocking her and her obsession. Not normal, not ok. Trust me, you are just a friend,  a temporary teddy bear. Protect yourself before you get more entrenched."
BPDlovedones,3aauyw,mrsmanicotti,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:39:51 2015 UTC,"Only thing i know to say is you're just going to have to learn to deal, bottom line. If you want to be with her you have to accept this behavior. You could get some therapy tho to learn how to manage her behavior for your own personal health. Add for her, she'll never get better, or get over her ex, till she wants to get better.  I dealt with something similar except in the other direction. My ex hated and wanted her exes dead and she would constantly remind me of them often. She would put me on a pedestal compared to them. But that didn't last long tho till she started to do the same to me.  She'll never get over her ex, it exes, they come with her, it's a package deal. Sorry!"
BPDlovedones,3aauyw,ijustneedahug,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:29:33 2015 UTC,"I'd be pissed off if I were you. I know she's clearly still attached but she needs to stop contacting this dude and concentrate on your relationship. It seems like you're being too nice about her disrespecting you. Just because she has a mental illness, it doesn't mean you should accept her actions. She needs help, but she also needs to grow up and be adult about your relationship. Speaking as someone with emotional issues, if I was madly in love with someone, my ex would be the last thing on my mind. How long ago did they break up?"

BPDlovedones,3aauyw,vonbear,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:49:35 2015 UTC,Riiiight. She needed time to get over him before a relationship so that makes sense. She needs help though. It's devaluing your relationship.
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,imgoingalittlenuts2,5,Wed Jun 17 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear that the therapy is helping in some areas at least.   Since she has psychological issues, you will have to take leadership and be strong on managing the finances. This will of course, make her rage, so plan for it, and stay strong. Finances are your responsibility now, since she can't handle them.  I know this is hell, and the timing has to be thought carefully. You might have to staggers things. But instead of accepting financial ruin, which is defeatist, accept your responsibility for the finances, and start to plan changes, counting on her not liking them, and deploy them according to your timeline. You need to lead on this. Right now, because of how draining her issues are, and how scary those strong emotions can be, you are letting her lead, and that clearly isn't working out.  This shit is hard. This will be a very hard boundary to defend. But you have the tools to do it. Be strong, do it. Bro hugs."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,cookieredittor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:28:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man.  I just don't feel like I have what it takes to control every aspect of our lives.

BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,cookieredittor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:31:30 2015 UTC,"You make the call. If she can handle the responsibility, then, it is fine. But if she can't, just know it is YOUR responsibility ultimately."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,ijustneedahug,3,Fri Jun 19 08:28:52 2015 UTC,"Have you tried separate accounts? One for you, one for her, and one for bills? That way she had her own and if she spends it all its gone and at least your bills are covered."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,cookieredittor,3,Wed Jun 17 21:45:07 2015 UTC,"That'll be the day.  She requires access to all funds.  When we got married, I had a fantastic credit score and no debt.  It took her less than a year, once I gave her access to my bank account and credit cards, to kill my credit cards and spend all of my reserve cash.  $12000 in the black to more than $12000 in debt with a crappy credit score.  I had to cash out a retirement plan to make ends meet.  In less than a year she's spent most of $30000.  If I try to cut her off, it's a horror show.  She recently cleaned out our pantry.  She found stuff that expired five years ago.  It's the same crap that ends up on our weekly grocery list, and she let it sit so we have to throw it away, because she didn't know what we had.  Cutting her off financially just leads to disaster.  I work more hours to make ends meet.  She gets pissed at me for being away from home longer.  It's a lose lose situation."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,Shanguerrilla,6,Wed Jun 17 22:32:54 2015 UTC,"That'll be the day.    I can totally picture the rage that will happen when you take responsibility for the finances. However, clearly, not doing this, is only making everything worse. So you either take responsibility, and face her rage, or she will drive you into bankruptcy, and then rage at you for it.    She requires access to all funds.   I'm going to rephrase that. She wants access to all the funds. I can understand that. But she doesn't require them, because she has no power over this. You have the power.   I had to cash out a retirement plan to make ends meet. In less than a year she's spent most of $30000. If I try to cut her off, it's a horror show.   But you must. It will be a horror show. Your choice is: do you have the horror show now and keep things afloat, or do you let her sink the financial boat, and then have the horror show. I know it is scary, i know it will be hell and hard, but this is something that is your responsibility because you are the only responsible one here.   Find a mediator to bring this up, and have the mediator propose a plan. Or, have some way to shift some funds for her personal account, some for your personal account, and the rest be used for unnegotiable expenses. Cut the credit cards. This will be hell. But the longer you postpone it, the deeper the hole she will dig.   She found stuff that expired five years ago. It's the same crap that ends up on our weekly grocery list, and she let it sit so we have to throw it away, because she didn't know what we had.   Same happens with my wife. She keep forgetting we have a vegetable drawer in the fridge. So she keeps buying fresh tomatoes and stacks them on top of the rotten ones. I had to put my foot down, and made a scene of pulling out all the tomatoes, good and bad ones, and counting them for her to see. She was furious, but she did stop buying food she wasn't eating at least.   I also had to take charge of all the groceries, cleaning the fridge, and all the kitchen management. In the end, she gave in, and is more relieved, and things work.  It is frustrating to know she can't take this basic responsibilities. But accepting she can't be responsible, and me taking care of it is more functional. I know changing her will take time and a lot of work, so i need to prioritize things.   It's a lose lose situation.   Then YOU change the situation. YOU have the power to do it. You make the money. It will be hell. It will be hard. But you can change this. If you don't, you are deciding to let financial ruin come to you. And you know no matter what, she will rage. So let her rage, but at least, protect your finances.  Without protecting your finances you can't bet well, she can't be well. It is part of your job to do this, even if she will scream that she doesn't want you too, in the long term, it is better for all."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,cookieredittor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:38:01 2015 UTC,"This is great advice.  The way I frame it in my head is this: I can't caretake her, her emotions, or her disorder- but I am responsible to caretake my own life.  That includes areas our lives intertwine like finances and legal issues.  (As a small legal issue compared to others: I've been recently putting my foot down about her wearing her damn seat belt while I drive as some cops have been tailgating me while driving and seeing her without one- it's illegal here and I'D get a ticket).  If something she is doing, if her behavior will impact or mess up my life and that of my family's, then I need to do what I can to take caretake that aspect of our lives.  I can't control her or fix her, but I have to be responsible to not let her screw up our lives or finances in every way I can- while accepting those I can't (and making whatever decisions I must therein)."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,ijustneedahug,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"She pays all the bills and does so on time.  It's just one more thing I don't have the skull space to deal with and make it out of the house every day.  If I cut her off, then I have to deal with all of that shit.  I'm a big dude, but my metaphorical shoulders aren't broad enough handle everything.  I need a partner.  I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.  I can't work all the hours I do, worry about paying all the bills on time, do all the shopping...there just aren't enough hours in the days and there isn't enough of me to go around."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,cookieredittor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"I understand this might be too much for you to handle. That is fair and reasonable. However, know that if she can't handle the responsibility, well, in the end, you are responsible.   There are alternatives that require less worry about bills and such. Some can be automatically paid electronically. If she is paying stuff with credit cards, it might be easier to pay a professional to handle the bills, than to pay the credit card for interest. You can give her her own account, and budget money for the shopping. Etc etc. There are many options.   if the finances bother you, and if you are scared of how she might react if you change them, discuss with your therapist possible plans to do. Just know that if she is running your credit, and you are letting her do it, in the end, you are paying a big price for all of it. Not now, but in the future. It is a lot of responsibility, and there might not be enough time in the day for you to do it all. However, also, part of your responsibility is to accept that you need help, and her help might be hurting more in the long run. In which case, you might want to reevaluate this help. I mean, think of how much it has cost you in terms of money and credit rating this help of hers."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,ijustneedahug,5,Fri Jun 19 08:33:40 2015 UTC,"It really is in a way and I'm sorry to hear about that aspect of your relationship. I can relate in some way....my ex tried to get me to sign over my 401k to her and we weren't even married. I never gave in, that was, and still is all I have left after the relationship. If I didn't have that I'd have been on the streets."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,cookieredittor,3,Thu Jun 18 00:00:01 2015 UTC,"I moved to my wife's country, where we got married. I don't speak the local language very well, so she was my translator. We had agreed to join our finances, giving each other ""emergency"" access to each others personal accounts. I was fine with this. We go to the bank, and she was acting VERY strange, like a lunatic. As we sign the paper, i can't follow everything in the language, i'm trusting her translation, but i can tell things aren't quite right, because we each are signing different papers.   i can tell things aren't equal just from that. i ask about it, nicely, just because i think this is a mistake. She became FURIOUS, and started yelling at me at the bank, saying i need to trust her, she doesn't have time to explain all the details. She berated me outside the bank some more for not trusting her.  A year later i started to suspect she had a PD, and recalled that event. I check the bank accounts, and she had full access to my account (not emergency access), and i had no access to hers (not even emergency access). This was not what we agreed to. I told her we needed to go to the bank together to clear things up. I didn't tell her what needed to be cleared up. I asked there about this stuff, and it is ""revealed"" how things are.   I don't get upset, i just ask to take away her power over my account. Wife was furious, and started berating the bank employee until he said that maybe maybe paperwork got lost. But he kept looking at me like ""dude, that never happens"". I kept calm, and said i was happy things were clear now. Outside the bank, wife started yelling at me saying i can never bring this up again, i can't blame her for this, i can never tell our couples therapist about this. I just kept my cool saying i wasn't accusing her of anything, i was just happy it was all clear up. She raged for hours after, and i could see in her face for the first time how she was just out of touch with reality, so threatened by it, she was trying to rage at me to see if that would change reality.  During that time she had control over my finances, she never took money out. I'm guessing she was monitoring me, but i never spent money mysteriously or anything, i'm pretty transparent. It must have been a control thing."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,ijustneedahug,5,Thu Jun 18 09:28:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, that's an amazing and scary story and you handled it extremely well. Damn good thing you questioned it and went back to resolve things. You've got some juevos! Definitely a firm of control.  My ex never got access to any of my finances and to this day I'm not sure how I survived that. She did however give me access to all of her accounts should something happen to her. She said it was so I could take care of her kids if she died. One of the caveats was that as long as I lived in her house with her kids I couldn't have a girl friend or wife. If I wanted one I would have to sell the house and split the money between her daughters. If she was dead, why should she care? Control, that's what. I knew that stipulation was just craaazy but I was committed to her and the relationship and dismissed it. Plus all I could think is the odds of her dying on me in a car accident were slim.  The day she kicked me out I immediately called all her banks, etc, and had them take my name off all her accounts I had access to. I didn't want to risk her somehow accusing me of stealing any of her money. I digress.  Man we have some crazy stories."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,cookieredittor,3,Thu Jun 18 12:23:26 2015 UTC,"Man we have some crazy stories.   The worse is how I sometimes forget how crazy these stories are. How much I normalized the crazy stuff. I tell my friends, and they don't say anything, and i start to doubt myself ""maybe I'm in the wrong here?"" and then they clarify that i'm not, it is just so scary and crazy they don't know what to tell me."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,ijustneedahug,4,Thu Jun 18 12:32:33 2015 UTC,"I'm totally with you, I did the whole normalizing thing to. If it wasn't for talking to family and friends...I can only imagine where I'd be. They certainly helped me see clearly."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,cookieredittor,3,Thu Jun 18 12:43:47 2015 UTC,"I'm still unnormalizing things, trying to internalize how that was not normal. As i mentally prepare for separation and a more quiet happier life, i start to reexamine stuff. Uff."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,Shanguerrilla,3,Thu Jun 18 12:59:03 2015 UTC,I'm sorry to hear about that but I'm glad you're going to be getting back to a quieter happy life. I thought if anyone was going to crack the whole BPD thing it was going to be you and your SO.
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,Shanguerrilla,4,Thu Jun 18 13:16:24 2015 UTC,"My wife is resistant to diagnosis and treatment. I tried everything I could, but if she doesn't want to get better, there is nothing I can do. She can always have an insane fantasy, attack me, etc, and there is nothing I can do about that.   I came to her country to be with her, and we were planning to leave for my career. But now, I'll have to make many changes in life, including sacrificing my career, to stay here, close to Son. I could be angry and accuse of her ruining my life, but I don't feel resentment. These were my own choices, probably from my own codependence. Stuff sucks, but i have to deal with what it is now, instead of what it could have been.  The separation stuff has been nasty, she is really going nuts and determined to hurt me. I don't even feel anger towards her, I do hope the best for her, and I wish she got help for her sake and for our son's sake. But she decided she hates me, that I'm a horrible person, and she is taking measures to isolate my son from me. I haven't had time to feel sad for all this, as I'm still in survival mode (preparing legally for her threatened false accusations, and trying to keep contact with son).   I can be strong, but I can't cure her."

I can very much empathize how painful her trust issues must have been for you.  I'm glad you handled that so well, I can imagine any other course of action and controlled behavior would have led to a much worse outcome, but I hope you still brought it up in couples therapy.  If that was with my wife, I wouldn't have the first time I took her (I was caretaking her emotions at the time), but I sure as hell would now."

BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,Shanguerrilla,3,Fri Jun 19 08:43:49 2015 UTC,"dang man. That's an intense amount of spending and debt that she's put you into. Excessive spending is definitely considered a form of abuse. And let me tell you, from my experience, it wouldn't be any better even if you made a ton of money. She'd escalate the spending to the limit of whatever you made. My ex did a similar thing, not to the extent of your situation though. And would always belittle me saying if I only made more money we could afford this or that or she wouldn't have to work, etc.  Do you have any strategy or plan to work on this form of financial abuse? Otherwise you're just reinforcing to her that she can keep up her current habits and you'll let it happen."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,Shanguerrilla,3,Thu Jun 18 02:37:21 2015 UTC,"This is very true.  I feel it in myself- as I made more I spent more.  I'm not even 'impulsive' and it happened.  I had to reign in my own increase in standard of living (that rose with my wages) and took control of finances to help my wife (she typically has no idea until the credit bill comes in).    Still isn't perfect, but as similar as all our stories and troubles, as much as I look at and for similarities, I am lucky that my wife has always been very humble and docile about finances, never attacked me about what I made or my controlling it.  I also recognize how nice it is that she doesn't have any substance abuse problems (not related to this thread).  Those two things added to what we do have going on would be too much for me.  We NEED to have strategies and plans about it (as you suggest).  Hell, even living alone I needed and had to have a plan.  Together it just makes it more necessary.  BPD or not."
BPDlovedones,3a7kxl,Shanguerrilla,3,Thu Jun 18 05:26:01 2015 UTC,"I can really relate, especially/even to the details there.. but I find my wife honestly needs more instruction in this.  She needs me to help her organize, not be impulsive, and budget.    She recently cleaned out our pantry. She found stuff that expired five years ago. It's the same crap that ends up on our weekly grocery list, and she let it sit so we have to throw it away, because she didn't know what we had.   This, I could have written this...  What's worse is my wife is shrewd in throwing out ANYTHING (medicine, food, etc.. that I WOULD STILL USE) that is near or past the manufacturer's sell by date.  Last month, just HER credit card (she doesn't work either) had over 3,000 on it.  This month, after paying that off last month (I pay it off every month) it now has a NEW 4,800 on it.  (She had a bit of medical bills and our son's birthday on there the last two months).  The conundrum: I 'only' make 3,400 a month after taxes.    Well, I control all the finances.  I pay all the bills.  So we had to talk about the money we waste.  Yes, we've done this before... but these women are IMPULSIVE.  My wife is so unorganized that when I ask her in the afternoon her plans for the day, even she doesn't know she is going out in 30 minutes.  I've said before, I will again.  As much as 'cutting her off' leads to disaster, I really suggest compassionately taking control of the family finances.  If this credit card bill would be too much for me (we will still skirt by another month), we would talk about cutting it up and doing a cash allowance system.  She is truly very concerned by my nice talk with her about money.  She's brought up a few times ways to save money and not been eating out or shopping.    I guess my point is that while I am not for caretaking disregulation or emotions... I AM for caretaking our own lives, our finances, and ways that our lives intertwine with our wives.  We have to.  We are the ones busting our ass in hot warehouses (or in my case next to hot computers these days ;)  We live here, we pay the bills, this is our life too- its an area we need to to caretake.  I know that I DO like living indoors and eating food... so I intend to keep doing so.  I also like my wife and son to, so I will do whatever I need to do that enables them to as well.  My wife also gets mad about work hours.. here I slip.  I set my own hours (though I HAVE to still do my 40+, just when I decide), hard to argue 'about the boss'.  In other ways, clearly you see I struggle with her rage/tantrum/anger..  But when it is because I am working so we can live indoors and eat- that shit rolls right off me.  I don't even get mad anymore.  I'm married to an emotional and irrational woman, I get that she wishes I didn't have these constraints, I have no ability to relinquish those constraints unless I win the lottery, hence- I have no need to react or feel bad/guilty about it.  That kind of reasoning doesn't help me in areas where I can see my own guilt, but it does about my working hours and the 'greater good' fills my sails in controlling the money and her impulses.  The 'games' she plays are definitely lose/lose when I play- but my life isn't."

It seems counterintuitive, but going no contact is that consequence.""   This isn't cruel at all.  It isn't about cruel or nice (to her).  Something is only offensive if the receiver finds it offensive.  I could say (and have said such things as) ""You look nice today"" or told the therapist ""We had a good week and I totally credit it to her (my wife), she really did well and was keeping herself accountable and working hard on the things you asked us to"" only to find her cry then yell and be offended.  We can't caretake others' perception.  If you mean to be cruel, it is cruel.  If you have no intention of ill-will, it isn't cruel.  If they want to be offended, 'they' can be by ANYTHING!  So the question becomes, is that what you want or what you need?  I think the answer is Yes, or else you wouldn't be where you are.  That isn't wrong of you, it is healthy to do what you need.  Take good and bad out of your peripheral and look at 'useful' and 'unuseful'.  Is this a useful decision?  Good, you made the right one then!  I can really relate to second guessing yourself... I did this even last night and today over a recent issue.  It doesn't make you weak or indecisive, it makes you compassionate and human.  We second guess and we test ourselves, we integrate reality into our memory and decisions while we judge ourselves.  Those are healthy things that 'not everyone' does.  You still were decisive and you quickly remedied what you needed to.    Whether or not going NC will be the consequence she uses to get help or change... that is indeterminable and uncontrollable by you.  The fact remains what we must do with others in our lives is also how we raise good children- human beings need to and learn by facing consequences to their actions."
BPDlovedones,3a6a96,Shanguerrilla,3,Wed Jun 17 16:29:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that second paragraph is really helping today. Because ultimately, yes, that is not useful nor what I want in the future (to continue feeling like this). Hearing about your experience.. I don't think i have that kind of strength to be as patient and forgiving as you, and I hope to be one day  I definitely agree about my NC being the motivation she needs to change. It is beyond my grasp. Thank you for the reminder and courage that it's okay to live life for me."
BPDlovedones,3a6a96,Tanglible_Dream,3,Wed Jun 17 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you and I'm glad you've been posting!  I don't think I have that kind of strength to be as patient and forgiving as I think I do either, and I hope to be one day too!  I think no matter how brave a person is- they get scared (the bravery is taking action anyway).    I think no matter how strong a person is- they feel weak, hurt, or feel their world shake sometimes (the strength is moving forward and not letting it stop them).  I realize stating that is cliche and simple- but it is good to remind ourselves sometimes.  I believe you are both brave and strong.  I also believe that when I mentioned yesterday that 'certain types' of people end up in and hurt in these relationships.. it is either narcissistic or empathetic people (I don't think many posting here about being abused are the former, I think you are the latter).  You do well to still 'care about' your ex, even in abuse.  I felt the same.  I don't believe everyone is this way.  It is okay to have this wash of emotions you do, they make sense in a compassionate person.  Understand you can be compassionate/empathetic and not be 'too sensitive'.  A big part of my denial between fights, my wondering if 'it really wasn't a big deal' was from this.  Am I just being too sensitive (as she accuses), was it really as bad as I remember?  Yes.  Yes it was.  You can even be strong and be hurt or need to step away from toxic relationships.  That isn't running away, it is decisively walking yourself into a healthier life, that is responsible as we are responsible for ourselves, our actions, our inaction, and our own happiness.  We can't save others from themselves and we only infuriate ourselves and hollow ourselves out serving and 'saving' people who don't desire change or themselves being responsible over their own lives.  I think you have handled things exceptionally well and you gained insight into her and your relationship and your own needs VERY quickly and accurately.  I'm also glad you took action.  I have to be honest, the couple years before I found this sub at the end of last year- they were really bad.  I was empty and a shell of my former self.  I didn't take your healthy action and it practically killed me in stress, depression, and anxiety while I focused on her and desired change in a person who didn't.  In total honesty, I'm glad I stayed, am learning and growing... but I wouldn't do it again.  If I had a mulligan knowing everything I know about how my life would go over the next years- we would have separated before we had our son.  I'm grateful I didn't, but I hope at a point in recovery in the future will come a time that I wouldn't choose to do it all differently if I had another chance (with her at least now going to therapy I feel better about my decision-- but this takes years to improve).  I love my wife, I know you love your ex... but that doesn't fix personality disorders and coping with someone else's illness when they won't is a recipe for heartache."
BPDlovedones,3a6a96,RudolphRed,2,Wed Jun 17 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"I remember one fight in particular. She just had her own flat by that time (because we agreed living together isn't a good idea when she packs her suitcase every two weeks and leaves, strange how she understood that). One thing that was still missing in her new flat was a bed.   In the week of moving into the flat, she had an episode and once more, told me to go to the devil and that it's over (of course saying it's all my fault). I remember how she once more emotionally destroyed me with messages and emails. She also tried guilt tripping by telling me she will have to sleep on the floor because there's no bed yet.   I was angry, hurt, frustrated, tired... but even in moments like that, i felt responsible... it's one of my biggest issues i think, that i have a ""helpers complex"".   What does a normal person do after their SO just walked out on them and gave them an emotional lecture about how you are the worst person in the world and they wouldn't care if you are dead?  Well, here's what i did:  I left work that afternoon and spent the afternoon moving an old bed from the attic to her new flat (she was working, i had a key). I didn't just bring it there... i moved it including pillows and blanket, set it up, put new covers and everything.   That evening she wrote me she's sorry, and how cute it was that i put the bed there... she was the nice girl with puppy eyes again... i took her back of course.   A few days later she stumbled over the next ""mistake"" that made me a horrible person again and the cycle repeated once more.   I have narcistic tendencies, but much more i struggle with having to much empathy and with this ""helper syndrome"".   I since try to direct the empathy towards myself, that seems to work a little better."
BPDlovedones,3a6a96,Tanglible_Dream,3,Fri Jun 19 08:13:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for sharing, and I'm so glad you're doing well so far and trusting yourself.   I can definitely relate to the message she left you...I couldn't go N/C with my ex-wife because we had to work on things during the divorce such as refinancing the house, etc. And especially after I moved out, she would sometimes be very calm and try to act like everything was fine...I don't know if it was some weird kind of reality warp in her brain that she did to help convince herself that she hadn't really done anything wrong, or if she was trying to reel me back in. Who knows. I think n/c is the right decision for you.   One of the hardest things for me has been juggling feelings of 1. sadness for losing a person that I did care about, alongside 2. relief and happiness that I'm out of an abusive situation. I'm learning that it's ok to have both of these feelings at once and this may be something you'll find as well. Keep focusing on getting yourself back to where you know you need to be!"

Excerpt From http://www.sharischreiber.com/waif.html   ""It's not unusual for the son of a Waif to connect with his father in nourishing ways after the death of his mother, as he begins to perceive qualities in his dad he wasn't privy to, while Mother was alive. His whole life may have been spent vilifying his father, based on what he assumed was the source of his mom's anguish, and what she led him to believe about his parents' discord.  You may have had an angry, alcoholic father, but who lit his fuse and made him need to self-medicate his pain? Have you given any thought to why he might not have been around much of the time? Did he return home to a nagging, discontent/depressed wife after slaying dragons and putting out fires at work every day? Could you have grown up with a skewed sense of who was actually the more problematic parent?"""

I don't know exactly what his wife's diagnosis would be, but she used their child in every way possible as a tool against my brother.  It breaks my heart.

BPDlovedones,3a65sf,Shanguerrilla,2,Wed Jun 17 20:08:30 2015 UTC,Hits close to home.. a bit frightening about the future for my son.
BPDlovedones,3a65sf,cookieredittor,2,Wed Jun 17 20:18:41 2015 UTC,"The difference is that my BPD wife will blame me for the inconsequential shit, even when it is her fault, or it doesn't make sense.  I still remember that one time we went on vacation. She said she was in charge packing all the bathroom stuff. Before leaving the house, I asked ""Is there anything i should grab from the bathroom?"" and she got furious because I didn't trust her.   Then, we reach our lovely destination, and she discovers there is no toothpaste. She forgot to pack it. And she goes in a RAGE, blaming me for it. I pointed out I asked her about bathroom stuff and she told me it was taken care of, but this somehow ALSO made it my fault. I kept saying ""it is just toothpaste, i'll go get it tomorrow morning. we can survive one night without toothpaste"" and she was going on how she doesn't want to waste money buying stuff we could have brought from home. Keep in mind, the cost of the toothpaste here was almost the same as home. So I said ""well, if it is too much money for you to pay, don't worry, i pay for it"". She was still angry at my stupidness for forgetting the toothpaste (she is the one that forgot, remember!) and for being so wasteful with my money.   Next morning i wake up, walked to the store, brought toothpaste, and put it there. Problem solved, right? Nope. Every time she brushed her teeth, she would get angry.   Remember, this was HER mistake. A tiny mistake, one i frankly didn't care about at all. Certainly for me it isn't worth the trouble to get angry about something so stupid, so easy to solve, and so cheap. I suspect that in some way she realized it was her bad, but she was so defensive about it that somehow in her mind she had to blame me for it. It didn't make any sense.  So yeah, not only being pissed off at inconsequential stuff, but try to blame others for it just to have a target to rage at."
BPDlovedones,3a65sf,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:55:53 2015 UTC,"from one step removed it makes me laugh, but I can relate to this:   Problem solved, right? Nope. Every time she brushed her teeth, she would get angry.   I honestly don't know how you dealt so well with the financial control and trust issues.  That would drive me NUTS.  I know even as similar as our wives and many stories around here we all have differences.  There are some things mine does that don't bother me as much as they would others and visa versa.. But that would drive me nuts.  How did you guys decide what bills or responsibilities were whose at the end of the month when balancing all the 'you pay, I pay'?"
BPDlovedones,3a65sf,cookieredittor,2,Thu Jun 18 19:18:33 2015 UTC,"The financial isn't so bad for her. She is quite responsible, although very very entrust worthy, to the point she would accuse me of stuff that would make me laugh. I'm a very very very reasonable guide, and i'm fine with whatever method works, as long as we all feel it is fair. The method that we worked out is very tedious, but it was the only thing that would pacify her paranoid fears. We split the big regular bills roughly equally. Other stuff, like groceries, etc, we pay each, and keep receipts. Even if we don't have receipts, we just write down the number in a piece of paper. At the end of the month, i add it all up, and see who owes whom what. She always ended up owing me money.   This method is terribly complicated and tedious. It stems only from her paranoia, and me just wanting to make sure there was transparency so she couldn't accuse me of stuff.   The trust issues do get to me, it is so irritating, because it is very obvious her mistrust has nothing to do with me, and all with her crazy dad, to the point she sometimes admits that she is angry at me because she assumed i would do stuff her dad would do, even when i'm not doing it, she still feels entitled to not trust me.  I can go on and on on trust issues if you want me to. My favorite one was when she demanded i stop writing on my diary (she doesn't know where it is, it is on my computer, password protected) because she can't trust me i'm not writing bad stuff about her. She has said this many times, usually when she sorts of realizes she is disregulated, and is afraid of me making her accountable."
BPDlovedones,3a65sf,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:44:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, day to day my wife seems to be really good about trust issues (and hides what she isn't trusting about VERY well).    For me the biggest thing has been the slights and rewriting (absent of trust).  How ignorant people can plant one seed that she will immediately let rewrite everything she should know about me from experience.  We broke up three times before marriage in such a way and it was absolutely mind boggling to me.  Those were my biggest red flags that I drove on past to the ravine.  Other than that, like the diary, my wife's BIG thing is that I cannot talk to anyone in my life about anything to do with her.  She never trusts me that I'm not telling 'all her secrets' or painting her in a bad light.  Accuses about and interrogates me about talking to my mother especially (and she talks to that damn woman more than I do!).  Like your journal, I see a parallel and it DOES often lead to disregulation.  It was something I feared about starting therapy for myself, but was able to use it to an advantage.  My therapist wanted her to come, asked me if I could get her to.  I said: Sure, I just have to tell her I don't want her to come so I can keep talking about our marriage to you.  (or something like that)  I was always clear with her I was there working on me, she would ask some questions fishing for the 'bad things' I'd told him, I think she started going partially so that she could plead her case and move him to her side.  So I guess trust issues aren't all bad?"
BPDlovedones,3a65sf,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:00:52 2015 UTC,"It's funny, I didn't set out to copy your guys method and ours isn't related to trust.. but we just had a long and good talk about finances.  She doesn't rage about that and is very rational and docile in this arena.  The follow through is hard for her though (and me, honestly).  Anyway, she suggested going to a cash allowance set by me (she spent over 5k this month already on a credit card) and she wants to be more accountable and do better.  I told her that was a great and responsible idea, but we I think more than the payment method our problem is in lack of organization and this leads us to spend more money in areas than we should.  Anyway, I just got an app with a great budgeting system that we can sync between our phones, ipad, and computer- and set her up with the app for her credit card.  She is reticent and not very technologically inclined, but willing.  I want her (and I) to go over our credit card or other purchases and at least once a day or after every few purchases just make a log on the ledger for the amount and category..  then it keeps it in line with the budgets I set (though she and I will work together to find how to best balance/allocate that budget.. mostly me, she's hands off by choice on finances).  Anyway, after getting this new big plan all going I remembered you guys and how similar in a lot of ways that is to you two.  I feel like finally, at 31, maybe I will start being more damn 'adult' in fiscal responsibility.    I used to save most of my income before marriage, but I find it isn't quite possible even when I'm the one paying bills she spends nearly as much as we make each month.    Siiigh.  I'm not perfect either, this will be good for both of us.  I really think you guys had a good plan and action in this, I clearly sympathize with the trust motivator not being pleasant and can't relate to the 'yours / mine' aspect, but being 'a team' and active and accountable with a budget is a great thing.  It certainly is at least one less thing for you to worry about now since you aren't in debt and shifting around credit card bills.  Luckily we haven't gotten to that point yet and always payed them off each month, but I'm tired of just getting by each month.  IDK why I'm rambling about this to you, just been working on finances all night and feeling a little hopeful and empowered.. also very happy about my wife's participation, willingness, and attitude."
BPDlovedones,3a65sf,cookieredittor,2,Fri Jun 19 06:19:50 2015 UTC,"This is a good concrete solution. I hope if works. Even if ti doesn't, don't give in, try another concrete solution. It is fine to try new methods until one works, it is part of being responsible."
BPDlovedones,3a66ad,ReggaeLegend,11,Wed Jun 17 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"I think she is not being honest with her therapist and psycholigist and is downplaying symptoms and lying about events and details.   This is common in BPD by the way. Essentially, they are so afraid of being abandoned, that they hide they have a problem, even if it means never getting help. In the end, if she doesn't want help, therapists can't help her.   Even if you talked to her therapist, the therapist might have to pretend it didn't affect his judgement. In the end, what you say is irrelevant to them, because they can only help people if they want help.  What i suggest is you accept she doesn't want help, she doesn't really want to face the issues. You can't force her to, trying so will only make her more chaotic. Then, from accepting the reality that she doesn't want help, think of what you can do in the relationship to make things healthy for YOURSELF assuming that she will behave as she does and won't cooperate. Sometimes there is a lot you can do, like having strong boundaries, enforcing consequences, etc. Sometimes it might mean that you redefine the relationship.  There is a joke that is relevant: how many therapists do you need to change a light bulb? Only one, but it has to want to change."
BPDlovedones,3a66ad,cookieredittor,17,Wed Jun 17 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"I suggest you leave and let someone else go down with that ship. She'll make you feel bad, tell you that you never really loved her or cared for her. She'll think it's for someone else, and just tell her it is. It's to be with yourself, because being alone is better than being stuck with someone you hate."
BPDlovedones,3a66ad,redditor99456,5,Wed Jun 17 16:17:51 2015 UTC,"I FORGOT TO MENTION:  She came home last night and went off on me in a deeply mean way. She accused me of cheating and lying being secretive no communicating ect..... Which is all lies.  Afterwards I rewinded back to something she mentioned when she got out of work; shes a warehouse worker and she works in the shipping department, packing/shipping expensive clothes (anywhere from $100-$10,000 a piece). She said ""I can't take my purse to work anymore. I have to get a clear container or bag and put my stuff in that because they said there are 150 missing pieces"" This was always a rule they had there and I said ""I thought that was already a rule"" and she just said yeah and didn't say anything about it after that.  I read on this subreddit that a lot of BPD people steal for fun. Could she be stealing from the company?"
BPDlovedones,3a66ad,Shanguerrilla,5,Wed Jun 17 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"yeah... and I just realized she did do it because I found a bunch of bags from the warehouse.

SMH, guess from now on when she has a rage fit I know she's most likely done something wrong, like steal.   And her therapists are completely blind to this!"
BPDlovedones,3a66ad,Tastygroove,4,Wed Jun 17 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"Pro-tip: Listen.   Listen to the things she accuses you of.  While this isn't 100% (BPD women and people in general have insecurities that they don't participate in) there are still many things that are projections out of the mouths of others.  My wife has acted very sensitive, emotional, immature, angry, argumentative, and 'crazy'.  These are all things that when she is going off on me accuses me of.    When I was younger there was a guy that was robbing our other friends.  He was always very self conscious and accusatory about people stealing from him... VERY protective of his things.  Turned out he was the thief in the group.  Another guy was best friends with my friend.  This guy was cheating with his best bud's wife.  They now have my friend's kids and are married.  They are also now VERY cautious that their partner is cheating on them... they cheated together before.  Liars think you are lying.  Thieves chastise and fear thieves. etc etc.  This isn't a given.  People say other things, but some of what people fear is that everyone thinks and acts like them.  Sometimes the things you hear out of others' mouths are projections.  Now here is a 180 from this point- you can't be neurotic about it.  You can't be always looking to connect the dots or figure everything out.  I'm just saying sit back and listen if you want to learn.  Building on this and to a more general point.  You cannot be your SO's therapist.  You can't fix her or guide her therapist.  You are where I am, our therapist says my wife is C-PTSD, I agree with him, but I also think she is BPD.  It honestly doesn't matter what my wife believes she is, it doesn't even matter what I or her therapist thinks she is for now.  What matters is they are looking at her thinking and behavior and she is working to get better.  I'm not her savior and I am not responsible for her disorders.    I don't recommend playing that recording on the voice mail or trying to convince her therapist she is BPD, he will only be convinced you are neurotic and leveraging your SO's mental health at home.    On the cheating in front of you and getting mad you'd interrupt...  I'd leave my wife in a second and that guy with a broken nose if I ever walked in on that- I'm not saying you have to or it's right.  I'm saying that you are not in a healthy relationship and you are the one responsible for yourself and your actions.  You might need to take action to get out of an unhealthy relationship.  My wife also doesn't stay drunk (or really drink).  There are many things in your relationship that many people wouldn't stay in it because of.  Understand, there are things in my own relationship many would leave my wife for.  The point is that we need to decide what we need.  We need to figure out where our lines are that when crossed we will end these relationships over.  You need to figure out where yours are because I am hearing that they aren't her being an alcoholic, a thief, and an adulterer, so what exactly would you leave her for?  Before I decided where those lines were for myself, I could not break from codependency and caretaking."

I wouldn't be diagnosing right now, but if you break up, she may well get the diagnosis. Sometimes people have traits but don't meet the criteria for BPD. Some people are narcissists and don't get diagnosed. It all depends on how you are. If she holds down a job, she is less likely to be diagnosed. It's seen as serious when you can't function and look after yourself."
BPDlovedones,3a66ad,ididnotdoitever,3,Wed Jun 17 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"At some point the mental health pros will figure out what's up.

BPDlovedones,3a66ad,imgoingalittlenuts2,5,Wed Jun 17 20:56:12 2015 UTC,"It sounds a lot like the BPD behavior that some of us here are familiar with. But as others have said, I don't really think the diagnosis or lack thereof matters, as she's likely deceiving the psychologist and not really attempting to work on anything. Especially if it's been two years and she's still behaving like that.   So my question for you is...you have a girlfriend who is verbally abusing you and generally just treating you like crap. Every time she does something like this and you stay in a relationship with her, you're telling her that you're totally cool with being treated like that. Are you? What would you say to your little sister or best friend if they told you their significant other was cheating on them and being abusive?  No one can tell you to stay or leave. But if she's not willing to be honest about her problems and get help, it's never going to get any better. You can't be enjoying this. How long are you going to put up with it?"

BPDlovedones,3a66ad,cookieredittor,3,Wed Jun 17 18:43:00 2015 UTC,"It's also possible that she is bipolar. The two diseases are often misdiagnosed.   As for the rule here that you should just run? It's BS. There are cases that warrant that, but she's seeking treatment. Somewhere in her brain, she wants to get better. I don't guess you owe her anything besides basic human respect, but if you love her, and and you aren't physically in danger, running isn't always the answer. I've been through this process for 15 years. It can work.   Go to her pdoc and therapy appointments with her. My wife's diagnosis was changed when her pdoc interviewed me. She'd been diagnosed as being bipolar as well as having BPD. After talking to the pdoc about her behavior, there was no evidence of a manic episode. He diagnoses the best her with MDD, changed her treatment, and we're in a much better place.   I go to therapy appointments with her so I can call BS when she isn't honest with her therapist. It isn't easy. There is backlash, but the issues that need to come up actually see the light of day."

BPDlovedones,3a66ad,neon2012,2,Wed Jun 17 16:42:55 2015 UTC,"Also, keep in mind, BPDs are known for rage quitting therapy. So the therapist has to thread very very carefully to treat them. If the therapist thinks that officially diagnosing them will make them rage quit, it is better that they don't tell the patient of the diagnosis, as some help is better than no help.  Don't get stuck in the diagnosis. Focus on how she doesn't want help, accept that, and decide what to do from that."
BPDlovedones,3a4mv8,bistdudeppert,3,Wed Jun 17 04:51:36 2015 UTC,"If you can, get full custody as soon as possible. Don't wait until your daughter gets older. Document everything your ex does. Install a phone call recorder I your phone and record every conversation. Save all your messages.   Your ex is not going to get any better without treatment and her illness will affect your daughter. It's affecting her right now, but it's hard to tell when she's so young. Bpd is caused by childhood trauma and/abandonment. Kids with BPD parents are more likely to be diagnosed with it themselves, so if you can get full custody, you can spare both yourself and your daughter from a whole lot of pain."

In other words, yes, it will get worse before it gets better, but that is the way forward.  For example, you tried to get the money. She refuses using bad excuse. Well, instead of arguing more (she wants the attention, she is saying it), then, go to the lawyer and have her face consequences. That is the only way she will stop playing games to get attention.  You can't have a cordial relationship if she refuses to. However, you can have good boundaries, and have her learn them, and through that, you can have a working relationship. Right now, if your attempt to be cordial, she is using it to get attention AND you don't have a working relationship either. So give up on that, and focus on having a working relationship. She does illegal stuff (withholding money), then, have her face consequences.  The info you give your daughter depends a lot on her age. If this is a concern, i suggest you get professional help. This shit is hard, and you need professional backing to guide you through this. Do it, it is the best way to help your daughter.   I asked her for specifics: what does she really want, what does she mean that I ignore her, should I fake, etc. She again said just vague things, said she is at her limit, same old threats and stuff she wrote months ago in the previous hate stage.   This is classic, it is exactly what my wife does. What this means is that she doesn't really want anything except the emotional chaos. She isn't emotionally in a place to negotiate. So stop trying that, and take other measures instead."
BPDlovedones,3a3ra0,BPDmomtoss,3,Wed Jun 17 00:15:59 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way for a long time. I remember my first thought when my husband proposed was ""I don't want to have kids right now.""  After a while, I saw some of my friends have kids and I saw the joy they experienced raising them. I then started to feel like maybe it would actually be a positive thing to have a child.   Before we started trying, I went into therapy and started processing my fears about having a kid. I was worried that I was going to be just like my mom. The therapy really helped and now I have a little boy.  The thing that surprised me the most was the fact that I'm not really even tempted to behave the way my mom did with me. It was really comforting to know that parenting can be instinctual in a really positive way.  Take your time and spend it on yourself now. You may feel differently later on."
BPDlovedones,3a3ra0,ecdomain,2,Wed Jun 17 03:52:14 2015 UTC,"I can't begin to thank you for this comment.  I think my feelings about pregnancy/having a kid are complex--it's not really fair to say that I'm negative/fearful/etc of it just because of my mother.  I do agree that I am afraid of becoming more like my mom--a fear that is compounded by the fact that my dad always said my mom changed and started showing BPD symptoms after I was born.  Supposedly beforehand she was super fun and relaxed, etc.    I should probably go to therapy to talk about this--it's not fair to me (or my husband) to make some sort of decision without sorting all of this out.  We literally have 0 friends/family members who are reproducing (or who have young kids) and therefore modeling what a normal/somewhat happy family might look like--plus there's no kids around for me to look at and say, ""I want one!""  :)  There's also the issue that my mom (and dad, though he has 0 decision-making power and is her enabler) have said that, if I get pregnant, they're moving out where we are immediately and not missing a moment of having a grandkid.  So I know if we do decide to have a child I'll have to deal with all the drama that will result from that--telling her we don't want her to live nearby, not letting her be alone with the kid, etc.  Stress, stress, stress that I really don't want to deal with.  All the same, I can't let that keep me (and my husband) from having a kid if we decide it's what we really want.  I'm going to take your advice and have me time now--but also know that getting therapy when I'm ready will be helpful.  Thanks again!"
BPDlovedones,3a3ra0,ecdomain,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:21:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment!  It is a complicated thing--would be easier if it was more simple :)  Thanks also for affirming that not having children to avoid her drama is still letting her ""win.""    You're also right about counseling--I have to work through all of these worries about what might happen if I had a kid before I can even get to the point where I know how I feel about having kids (or not).    Ugh--finding a good counselor is the worst.  I know it will be worth it in the end, but that doesn't mean the process isn't crappy.  Thanks again!"

I was my mom's friend and psychiatrist at a young age and that left me feeling like I was responsible for making her happy.   My parents also did the same thing and moved closer when my son was born which was pretty stressful. I'm just working on setting boundaries.   Enjoy your second childhood! That's what I felt college was like for me because I was finally free."

I've never married, no kids, never wanted to get married out of fear my relationship would end up like my parents. The relationships I have had were all doomed to fail but I never knew that till now. My last relationship was the worst that I had, she ended up being uBPD, but the silver lining is I finally learned about the disorder/s. I'm finally at peace with past, my life, and myself and feel that at some point have a normal relationship. My only regret maybe is that half my life is gone and I wished I'd learned all this much, mich sooner."

I know there are things that can happen that aren't in our control, but I really hope we can get through those things.  I don't have enough trust/faith/whatever to think we can be as happy as we are now if we voluntarily introduce big stressors (like a baby).  When I say it like that it sounds sad.  That's not a reflection on my husband, but is really about my own baggage."

BPDlovedones,3a3ra0,bpdthrowaway15,3,Wed Jun 17 04:56:38 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly the same. My mom is ubpd, and I have a brother, 11-yrs younger than me, and while my mom held it together pretty well while I was growing up, she lost it when I was 17. I ended up feeling like the only functional parent figure for my brother, and my mom has continued to decline since, instilling in me a deep, deep sense of responsibility for her life and happiness. And she is pretty much a child who will never grow up or thrive based on my efforts. I'm 33 now, and I have a husband and a career. I work and party and garden, and I am absolutely terrified of being made responsible for another person."
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,Shanguerrilla,5,Wed Jun 17 04:06:24 2015 UTC,"Given that you have a child involved, this is way beyond my experience, but I wanted to lend you my support.  I remember having thoughts in the past that it didn't seem to matter how dispassionate I tried to be when my ex was raging.  No amount of validation helped, and as you know, explaining myself made it worse.  Thing is, I realized that even if I perfected strategies to keep from fueling her fire, eventually she'd find something to imagine and rage about where it would be vital for me to be understood.  A child is exactly that scenario.  The consequences of not being trusted and being willfully misunderstood are enormous.  Once she found that, I knew the wedge and walls thrown up in the relationship would keep getting bigger and bigger because she would never listen to me on that issue, would persist in thinking the most heinous things about my motivations and her elevated, imagined sense of horror and alarm would keep increasing over time.  There was nothing I could do about it.  The only think I can think of to do is if you have someone with legal understandings, get advice as to how to protect yourself and reputation should she attempt to use your child as a wedge to discredit you.  Sending you warm thoughts...good luck."
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,cecirdr,2,Wed Jun 17 14:06:02 2015 UTC,"No amount of validation helped, and as you know, explaining myself made it worse.    I really identify with this statement. Especially the part about explaining yourself and making it worse. Often, explaining ourselves makes us look guilty, like we're trying to cover our asses or something. I think the key (though hard to achieve) is learning when  to say anything at all. Explaining is one thing; setting a boundary, expressing your limits, and standing by them is another."
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,way2manycooks,2,Wed Jun 17 22:02:25 2015 UTC,You are exactly right and there is no way to not JADE when I start by explaining myself.
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,cookieredittor,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the support!  This had me more off balance than usual as it involved my son and I was crushed I hurt him.  I suspect I should have been calmer still.. I was always in control, but when she threats or tries to intimidate now I rather jar her by breaking my calm in a dominant way showing emotions just then and remind her who she's talking to.  I would end the conversation, but she usually responds well to this..  before she would question my testosterone or call me a bitch, so I feel she desires the calm and controlled..    I don't know, I'm rambling.  Last night I lost my strategy and insight, was low to have hurt my son.  Your post made me feel better as I didn't intend on pretending I had no emotions and getting steam rolled, or avoiding her rage, or inciting it, or (i hope even) changing or mind... I really felt like I needed to explain that I love my son for me because I felt like shit and whether she believed or not I wanted to say so.    Thanks for your comment! I felt pretty lost in this one due to the circumstance."
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,RudolphRed,3,Wed Jun 17 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"First of all, i don't see how you screwed up, except for the very small mistake of accidentally pushing your son. My son is older than yours, and let me tell you, i did that, many times. Other times we played and he was grabbing me or something, and i wasn't expecting it, and i made him fall. Once he crawled behind me while i was in the kitchen, i didn't see him, so i took a step back, and ended up stepping on his little hand.  Every time i felt horrible and console him. This is all normal, part of your son learning about personal space, controlling his movement, etc. It sucks, but this is part of it. They get over it, and don't feel bad about it. I wish i had eyes everywhere, believe, but i don't, so i accept that this happens. This is normal.   What isn't normal is her way of responding to that. She is doing it because of her issues, and it has nothing to do with your reasonable mistake.   'that I accused her of being angry'   my wife does this when angry too. She is yelling, flashing her teeth, threatening me, throwing things, hitting stuff, while saying she isn't angry. This is the definition of emotional disregulation: their emotions are so overloaded and confused, they don't even know what they are, and act in illogical ways. They saying they are angry that you say they are angry is just a textbook cascade of emotions. You can't stop that, all you can do is validate until you get tired. And if you get tired, walk away.  The stuff about her expecting you to say it is ok to be mad, in reality, is her way of somehow knowing she is acting up and wants to feel entitled to. I try to separate emotions from actions, but NOT to convince my wife about it, but to be clear about my boundary: I can understand she is angry, but i won't put up with her bad actions. It doesn't calm her down many times, but it does keep me sane, assertive, and with good boundaries.  You aren't crazy. She was disregulated and took it on you. I know this feeling so well, my wife made me think i was the crazy one over and over. Heck, now, even though i logically know i'm not crazy, sometimes emotionally i still worry, it gets to me. I can shake it off more quickly now, but it still gets to me.  The thing is, shit happens. It was a small mistake, and you took care of it. That is all. It doesn't make you crazy or a bad parent.   Just know that my wife does accuse me of gas lighting her. Sometimes she says really awful things and i just repeat it back ""I hear you say i'm an asshole"" and she is STUNNED by this, and accuses me of making it up, although i just repeated what she says. I started to record the conversations just to feel sane. This helped me a lot. But keep in mind the point is that their reality changes according to their emotions. If what you say happened doesn't fit their emotions, their mind concludes that you are manipulating reality somehow, or lying. Know that the stuff you wrote is stuff my wife said many times, so feel confident it is the PD, not you.  In the end, the take home message is that when she is disregulated, clearly, TALKING LOGIC doesn't work. You need to enforce boundaries, and this might mean actions. Plan for those, they send a stronger and better message than words.  She is responsible for her dysregulation 100%. And you are responsible 100% for not putting up with her bad behavior. Your responsibility might mean you have to do stuff she doesn't like. It is because she won't like it that your boundaries might in the long term make her want to change her behavior."
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,RudolphRed,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:24:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for commenting Cookie!  Man I lost my gameplan and playbook on this one, but I don't think I handled it as bad as I felt last night.  I set no victory condition and question why I went in and engaged.. I still question that.  I 'feel' like it wasn't bad to communicate I care about him just as she does (I didn't do this right though), but mostly because I don't think I needed to logically convince her- I really needed to speak up for me because I felt like utter shit after hurting my son and her chastising made me feel worse.  Rather than be silent and enable that behavior, I guess it wasn't 'too' wrong to note she is and can be (justifiably) angry (though this incited her).. but that I care like she does and felt awful.  I suspect I talked too much logic.  I also did it wrong as I certainly walked her into disregulation... but part of not being responsible for her emotions sometimes is going to have to be saying how I feel even when it does so (I used to AVOID this, don't feel I always can anymore).  I definitely screwed up here:   I try to separate emotions from actions, but NOT to convince my wife about it   I don't think I tried to convince her of it, as I kept leaving the issue and just saying it was okay for her to feel that way or be mad, she was free to her opinion I gaslit her, but I just wanted her to know I care.. but I think in ways it played out like I was trying to logically debate or convince her.  I didn't really enforce any boundaries.. I guess it is kind of a boundary that when she'd threaten or try to intimidate I would do what we talked about before (it seems to help her) and break my calm, be very masculine, sound controlled but strong and use strong language, to suddenly jar her to the fact that I am the man here, she is my wife, and she isn't going to intimidate or talk to me like that.  It actually (so far) works with her.  She suddenly submits slightly and changes course.  Before when I would be calm in that moment instead and 'let her' she would keep escalating it and walk over me.  I guess that is kind of a boundary?  I did let the conversation end a few times without trying to convince her and she'd bring it back up with a new theory, then I'd repeat the 'truth' I started out to communicate, say her emotions were justified and okay, tell her she can believe the parts she explains different and let the conversation end again.    This is a golden comment of yours:   If what you say happened doesn't fit their emotions, their mind concludes that you are manipulating reality somehow, or lying.   Man you are succinct and insightful.  That is verbatim what occurs and always perplexes me at the time (since the emotions rapidly shift, as does her understanding of what occurred and was said).  I guess I didn't do as bad as I thought last night.  I really was confused on things as I felt exceptionally low to have accidentally hurt my son for the first time and very truly understood how/why she would be angry.  I wish I hadn't felt the need to tell her I cared about him like her, I just didn't want to let her behavior insinuate I don't and be non-confrontational about what I 'felt' I needed to say.  I guess my goal was this:   It doesn't calm her down many times, but it does keep me sane, assertive, and with good boundaries.   Crap man.. I always think I have this stuff figured out, then another dysregulation comes along and I feel lost in the woods again.  Some I handle better, this one I couldn't see through."
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,RudolphRed,2,Wed Jun 17 15:55:35 2015 UTC,"so here are a couple of things I identify with here...firstly, accidents or mistakes were a huge thing that would make my ex-wife fly off into rage. It's one of those uncontrollable and unexpected things that I think are just a million times harder for people with this kind of mental issue to handle. For me it was things like missing a turn while driving...dropping/breaking stuff, etc. All accidental just like you with your child. And for most people this might lead to a few seconds of being upset or frustrated and then they get over it...for the BPD person it's total justification to rage for hours (as if they ever need a real reason anyway). It's especially frustrating for you when it's something that you feel bad about already, and then you have another person heaping on the hate and blame instead of being supportive and understanding like you'd expect from most folks.   Secondly, I would not spend another second worrying about how you handled the situation or what you could have done ""better""...from all I can tell you're putting up with and handling things way better than any human could be expected to. Let's put this in perspective...one person was screaming, hysterical, totally detached from reality, and the other is calmly taking it and trying to defuse the situation. You may have been able to slightly adjust the level or focus of her rage by saying or not saying a few different things, but in my experience there's very very little that you can do in that situation to stop or defuse the rage.   Don't take that blame on yourself. You're not crazy and you didn't do a single thing wrong as far as I can tell. You shouldn't be demonized for making an honest mistake, and you shouldn't be screamed and raged at for stating your feelings. You also shouldn't have to be so on edge at all times and tiptoeing around things that you think could make her disregulate.   Sorry you were put through a miserable evening my friend. I remember those well and how defeated I would feel for hours/days afterward."
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,imgoingalittlenuts2,2,Wed Jun 17 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks buddy.  I was more upset with myself in this than most accidents or things to set her off.  I typically don't try to avoid (or cause) her disregulation, but in this event I was kind of vulnerable and questioned my actions.  Normally doesn't get to me so much, but man I was on weak footing internally last night.  I came there to say- look, I feel like you're angry and I understand why, but I want you to know I care about my son as much as you..  With all the circular conversation and rewriting, I started wondering what the hell I did say or why I said it.  I do still struggle in sharing my feelings with her.  I see that as an area I need to improve.  Before I found this sub that was clearly the largest area where I avoided and would see her tantrum.  Last night, for likely insecure reasons, I felt like I needed to tell her, or her to know how I felt- you are right that I shouldn't be afraid of or feel guilty for that.  Thank you for the support, friend.  This one had me more hurting than most.  I find encouragement in that I did stay on the truth I started with, disengaged from most of her accusations, didn't let her walk on me, and stayed calm except when intimidated (I can't allow that crap any more), then went right back to calm, normal and somewhat validating.    Today things are good again, I feel better, but as I typically act without grudge or judgement to her disregulating (after the fact, when I feel I can), I find she is quicker to level her scales and return too.    It is hard to remember that in the end I have no control over her or her not having symptoms or disregulation.  Sometimes I forget that like when I was in denial, I'm now sometimes in denial that things haven't ""gotten more better yet.""  Damnit, I worry about my son as he gets older.  I can't imagine being a child and seeing a parent getting like she was last night- I'm a grown man and I struggle with it."
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,imgoingalittlenuts2,2,Wed Jun 17 19:51:46 2015 UTC,"I hear you man. My ex was great at that too- getting me to doubt myself and take blame for her abusive actions. It's so hard to learn to trust your gut under that BPD disregulation onslaught.   I'm with you on the child thing as well...I put off having children with her our whole marriage because I would imagine her treating me the way she did and drinking, etc. around my child and it just made me sick. Not to mention treating the kid the way she treated me as well. Have you been in therapy or counseling yourself or thought about it? I think that could be really helpful for you, especially in navigating how to best protect your son as he grows up in a sometimes chaotic environment.   I also wanted to ask about what your plan is for boundaries/consequences for your wife when she behaves in these ways. I think you're doing amazing at regulating your own behavior, emotions, and reaction to her, but everything I've read talks about setting boundaries and having clear consequences for when the person with BPD crosses them. It's a hard thing to do, and i'd imagine even harder with your son involved. But otherwise you're just telling her that it's ok for her to treat you like that so she will continue doing so."
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,way2manycooks,2,Wed Jun 17 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"Yup, I started going to therapy when /u/Cookieredditor twisted my arm to ~4 months ago ;)    After a few months, without my coaxing, she started going as well.    I do try to institute boundaries, but I'm not very amazing at it.  Most of my boundaries are things I do and say in consequence to certain behavior or end engagements when I feel I am being abused or manipulated.  Last night was weird, I never 'felt' like I had to institute a hard boundary (I felt very 'wrong' in the circumstance, but 'right' to not allow her to say certain things or to not admit to some of the claims she pushed toward).    Basically, when she tries to intimidate me or threaten me I break my zen-like calm I otherwise hold.  I don't open the bottle cap off my temper, I just crack the seal a little and remind her that she isn't in control here and does not intimidate or control me.  I have no idea how useful this is.. but it seems to work for her.  She always previously would emasculate me as I would calmly 'talk things out' and she seems to respect it.  If we can't negotiate or have adult conversation, I typically end the talk in a validating / nice way (as nice as possible anyway).  I'm not going to go in circles of accusations forever.  I usually speak my mind about things about how she treats my son that I need to.  She neglects him sometimes, I am clear I'm here to help- let me know when you need it.. if I hear him being neglected I go spend time with him.  When she gets passive aggressive, I now call that behavior out.  She won't logically accept it, so not in argument.  I just express I 'feel' X (like distance, obstacle, whatever) and want us to be close.  Sometimes that works.  Sometimes when she is PA on overdrive and silent treatmenting, slamming things, negging me.. I'll express she is doing that behavior, she'll deny it and I'll do it right back to her: Like leaving all day without telling me anything while ignoring me like I don't exist when trying to talk to her beforehand..  So I mentioned it, then did it right back and went to see friends.  She caught the message..  I don't know though.  Most of what I do doesn't 'feel' like boundaries.  It is mostly just regulating my own behavior, emotions, and reaction to her... as in- that is the consequence.  One boundary I can think of is her threats of divorce.  They are drastically removed by being clear I won't be constantly blackmailed about losing my marriage.  She understands that threatening and intimidating through 'leaving me' will result in me ending this marriage.  Never had to fully execute that consequence, but the two times she's broached it in the last 7 months (it used to be a weekly thing) she clearly understood I was done with her or would let her stay in my life if she immediately changed tack.  Unfortunately, I think a boundary will need to be when my son is older, that when she disregulates I IMMEDIATELY shut down our interaction and either she (if capable) or me (good-Lord, this one would be inciting) need to take the kid away from that rage.  I can't have him witnessing that behavior and so far I don't believe she will target him with it.  I don't think I generally communicate with her that I approve of her mistreating me anymore, but I walk a tightrope where I try to have thick skin to what I can (being a little critical, sharp comments, when she feels funky and needs space).  I try to act the same regardless and just ignore a lot of little things because I don't want to be nitpicky and she already thinks I am neurotic and sensitive..  I deal with the little things that can't really hurt me or are only borderline unacceptable as shit tests.  Agree and amplify where I can, ignore when it doesn't matter, act unphased and flippantly handle it so she sees it doesn't affect me..  When it is something I need to not accept I typically bring it up and try to be validating but firm.  When she is aggressive and trying to intimidate- I drop the pseudo psychological plans and games and become very masculine, unphased, and hold myself in a way that is clear I respect myself too much for her to say or do X behavior.  I haven't got everything figured out yet, that's for sure.  Anytime I think I'm starting to she reminds me how wrong I am, like last night."
BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,way2manycooks,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"Good to hear!  Yeah I think that will be a whole new battle and lots to figure out once your son is older. I don't envy you at all dealing with that, but I think if you're clear beforehand about that boundary and the consequence it'll be possible to handle it."

BPDlovedones,3a4i1v,way2manycooks,2,Thu Jun 18 02:46:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone drops their kid.  When mine was way too young to be old enough to roll over, I left her on the couch while I went to the bathroom.  I'm in mid squat and I hear thump scream.  She'd rolled off the couch.  It happens.  Kids that young are very resilient to incidental accidents like rolling off couches or getting under foot.  As far as your wife goes, I don't know how you could have handled it any better short of being Jesus.  Before treatment, my wife would pull the same crap.  That was before she accepted her diagnosis.  When I got home from work, I never knew what I was coming home to.  Might be happy, euphoric wife with dinner ready.  Might be an evil shrew cutting me down about the most microscopic inadequacy.    I don't want to be a downer, but you can't fix it.  She has to decide she wants help.  I went through years of hell and nearly lost her (both in life and relationship).  There was a breaking point where she basically saw herself in a metaphorical mirror and realized she needed treatment.  Check out my post history if you want details.  She went to treatment and our relationship and quality of life drastically improved.  There are still issues, and there probably always will be.  However we can live with each other, and our kid isn't caught in the middle.  Also, Cookie is the bomb.  Take that as gospel and read it as such."

BPDlovedones,3a41qj,mrsmanicotti,8,Wed Jun 17 03:53:26 2015 UTC,"I did and she started calling me from a Los Angeles phone number (I live in Chicago). First voicemail was that she's smart and I can't run and hide from her. Getting kind of a ""Fatal Attraction"" vibe now."
BPDlovedones,3a41qj,mrsmanicotti,3,Wed Jun 17 04:02:53 2015 UTC,Yikes! I had an ex once who turned our to be mentally disturbed.  Not BPD but after a month of dating I realized there was something seriously wrong. I went NC. He continued trying and I even had an incident where I caught him peeking at me through a crack in the door at a public event. I eventually told him I was going to contact the police and he stopped.  I hope you are documenting this and saving messages.  You may need them at a later date.
BPDlovedones,3a41qj,vonbear,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have them. I blocked the number she was calling from and she stopped for now. I don't think she'll try to hurt me but I am worried she may try something to herself at my apartment building or something."
BPDlovedones,3a4iwb,torontoghoul,2,Wed Jun 17 04:13:17 2015 UTC,"Whether he has bpd or not this is a 1 1/2 month ""relationship"" - it's not suppose to be like this or this dramatic.  Move on, it's not your responsibility to save this guy - he doesn't want saving, and you can't do it anyway.  I saw the other thread in r/bpd you posted, so I need to comment on the poster giving out hopeful recovery rates. You DO NOT stick around with someone with the hopes that with 10 years of therapy they will recover. Not for a one and a half month long relationship - that is insanity and you will be wasting a decade of your life."
BPDlovedones,3a4iwb,crystanow,2,Wed Jun 17 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"The whirlwind will not stop. Even if he did get help, and worked very hard, it might be a very long time before things change. So, whatever you decide to do, do it by being realistic about the expectations: the chaos will continue, so the burden is on you to have strong boundaries to stop it. If not, you enable the PD, and it only makes things worse for him and for you."

BPDlovedones,3a2mfd,wewewawa,6,Tue Jun 16 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"“I read an article saying ‘people with BPD have no empathy’ which really got to me. If anything I have too much empathy, along with a lot of other sufferers.  “Our emotional instability allows us to put ourselves in other people’s shoes more easily so we can be understanding; the illness does sometimes have its benefits!   I see this on the main BPD sub quite often...  For asinine reasons I've even engaged in discussion about it once when I saw it.  Yet I can't help but feel sometimes people mistake sympathy and empathy.    They oftentimes bring it back to two things: the 'face study' and that the reason we don't see their empathy for our 'tiny hurts' is because they have such 'greater hurt' all the time and can't be bothered with ours... which isn't empathy.  While the face study from what I read- as well as being quicker to distinguish negativity in a sad or negative face, BPD sufferers also are prone to very quickly distinguishing negativity on a neutral face. I DO believe there is something to a BPD sufferer being more capable than non-sufferers at distinguishing or recognizing certain things about others- but the difference between recognizing, acknowledging, and even understanding others' emotions, compared to actually 'sharing' their feelings... is at best the difference between sympathy and empathy.  I don't think borderliners are without empathy or incapable.  In my uneducated mind, I just think there are times they invent 'how' someone feels, recognize it, and when in a tantrum or lashing out or in- are in that moment incapable of displaying or 'feeling' healthy empathy.  That said, I also believe that is very similar to a lot of non-BPD.. not everyone is an empathetic person anyway.  Sorry to ramble, I've read different takes on them being 'empaths' from themselves many times.  Just as it bothers them to hear others believe they don't have empathy, it simply is a conundrum I cannot fathom to believe they 'always' have 'more' empathy- when a woman I sacrificed for would try to abuse and hurt me without empathy as best as she could."
BPDlovedones,3a2mfd,Shanguerrilla,4,Tue Jun 16 20:28:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah...I think BPD sufferers can surely display empathy. My ex could be very empathetic and for the most part was extremely supportive when my grandmother died, among other examples. I think the appearance that they don't have empathy might come from how easily they detach from reality at times like you're saying. At their best, they can be very empathetic. At their worst/(most BPD) moments they act as if they don't care about how anyone feels but themselves and cannot correctly identify at all with how others are feeling or the motivations behind their actions."
BPDlovedones,3a2mfd,RudolphRed,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:06:29 2015 UTC,I think you are exactly right.  Well put.   and cannot correctly identify at all with how others are feeling or the motivations behind their actions.   That even applies to themselves in emotional disregulation.
BPDlovedones,3a2mfd,Shanguerrilla,3,Wed Jun 17 20:15:44 2015 UTC,Exactly.
BPDlovedones,3a2mfd,dinosaurs_r_awesome,2,Wed Jun 17 01:33:49 2015 UTC,"Very insightful. You should make it a post of its own for visibility.   BPD sufferers also are prone to very quickly distinguishing negativity on a neutral face.   With regard to the face study, I can add my own recent example. We are doing the bills for the month, and I'm checking receipts on some expenses she made. We do this every month (this is HER choice of handling the bills, it comes from her mistrust). I always struggle reading her handwriting, and sometimes she writes notes on the receipts, or adds by hand additional expenses she paid with cash and doesn't have receipts for. This is never an issue. This time she wrote something on a receipt using a bad pen. S  So, I'm bored by doing the bills (it is tedious), and then struggle for a bit to understand what she wrote. Probably I squinted or something, I don't know. Her voice startles me: ""Why are you looking at it like that?"" ""Uh? Like what?"" ""Like that, you know, like you don't trust me, I didn't make that up, i did pay for it, you never trust me, blah blah blah"" and off she goes ranting and fighting by herself. I just wait until she is done and say ""I'm just struggling with your handwriting because the pen was running out. Can you help me?"" She feels stupid, reads it, clarifies it, but then doubles down on the anger, accusing me of making a strange face just to piss her off. After that, i thought of the face experiment, this was a perfect example of that.  Remember, this is from someone that every month is surprised that she owes me money for the bills (i do all the grocery shopping and pay for all the dinners out and big items), and gets angry, and accuses me of all sorts of things. And every month I explain again the usual stuff, the numbers don't vary that much from month to month.   when in a tantrum or lashing out or in- are in that moment incapable of displaying or 'feeling' healthy empathy. That said, I also believe that is very similar to a lot of non-BPD.. not everyone is an empathetic person anyway.   I fully agree with this. The difference here is one of degree, and that with BPDs, they often have a cascade of emotions that is very strong. so this happens way more often and more intensely for people with BPD.   However, also, I would add that often, they are so easily overloaded by emotions, that just me expressing my emotions, or even she thinking i might, is enough to trigger her, get her angry, and go on a rant about how she has it way worse than me. In the end, i just accepted i couldn't tell her my feelings and expect a listening ear, it was too much of a burden on her."
BPDlovedones,3a2mfd,cookieredittor,2,Thu Jun 18 11:19:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, great example of the face study.  I can't imagine going through all the receipts like that for distrust (or having a yours/mine deal with the money and bills).  I completely agree about untreated BPD's having those overwhelmed moments more than nons, as well as the cascade and extreme emotions (also relate to it being thinking my opinion doesn't align with hers and especially me sharing my feelings).    I keep forgetting that about me sharing my feelings.  I keep thinking that as we get better I can, but I can only really think of two times I 'had to' and both led to big tantrums that ignorantly shocked me.  Unless it is a feeling positive to her, then Yes, big-time tantrum incoming.  I hope one day I can get her to that level because I feel like it is a form of caretaking her disregulation to hide or swallow my feelings- but on the other hand /u/way2manycooks made a great post on what was eating at me.  On some level there are times it is very much okay to not share my feelings (typically when I feel the need to) when it is based on fear or my own insecurity."
BPDlovedones,3a2mfd,Shanguerrilla,2,Thu Jun 18 14:36:19 2015 UTC,"I stopped sharing all negative feelings altogether. It helped a lot. But even then, she would still ""read"" in my face feelings that had nothing to do with anything I was feeling, and she would rage about that. Sigh.   That post by /u/way2manycooks is very insightful. It resonates a lot with a great book about assertiveness called ""When I say no, I feel guilty"". I think it is particularly good for us codependents having clear things to say in these situations."

You don't deserve to be treated like that and used. Also heartwarming to hear how you can count on your Mom for support.  Be prepared for your ex to play some more games and stay no contact.  There is good in the world, why let that hurtfulness in your life."
BPDlovedones,39y8uv,mrsmanicotti,6,Tue Jun 16 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"Any time you're tempted to go back, remember that bus incident.  Obviously there were bigger problems, but sometimes it's the little ones that really reinforce the toxicity of a person.    I unfortunately can't go total NC because of kids, but a few weeks ago I had to take a pair of pants over for one of the kids when they were at her house.  Just like you picked the wrong bus, I took the wrong pants. Yep I screwed up but it needn't have set off stream of insane texts about what a failure I am as a human being.  Much more serious incidents happened over the years but if there's one thing that cements the fact that I will never be able to have any kind of friendly relationship, it was that one.  She's always saying, ""I think we can be great friends and co-parents once this divorce is over"" and the first thing that pops into my head is those damn pants lol.  And using sex to reinforce power is a very familiar theme as well.  Yuck."

BPDlovedones,39ug6h,way2manycooks,3,Sun Jun 14 21:45:13 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea.   This is unrelated, but coincidental..  Just a day ago I was going over my wife's credit card bill (she spent over 4800 this month!).  One thing that caught my eye was an Audible bill every month since February.  I know I never see/hear her listening so I asked her about it, like: I don't mind you having this if you use it, just didn't know if you knew it was charging us every month.  She had no idea.  Hadn't used the thing in months, etc etc.  So I used her credits to buy her some books she might like and cancelled it.  Was actually kind of hard to find how to cancel the subscription, then they offer you three months at half off.    Makes nothing to do with the post, I just thought it was funny that a day ago was my first interaction with Audible.    So people, remember you get 1-3 free books for trying audible (she got two or three at first, maybe a promotion), just don't forget to cancel the thing when you are done with it (you keep the books you bought or got free)!  And if your SO is doing some (hopefully honest) bookkeeping they might still find the thing."
BPDlovedones,39ug6h,Shanguerrilla,5,Sun Jun 14 22:53:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing!   I may wind up keeping the subscription as I tend to read through half a book and then set it down and never pick it up again. I'm a podcast fanatic (hence how I discovered audible) so I'm interested to try other books too. /u/cookieredittor suggested When I Say No, I Feel Guilty, which unfortunately, wasn't available on audible so I ordered the paperback copy. Neither was Loving Someone with BPD (I actually placed that one on hold at my library).   Regardless, still a low cost option for reading Walking on Eggshells (if you remember to cancel the membership!)"
BPDlovedones,39ug6h,cookieredittor,4,Sun Jun 14 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"To be clear for others that might read this, the book ""When I Say No, I Feel Guilty"" is not about BPD. It is about assertiveness, especially when confronting difficult people in general. I think that it is very helpful for many of us codependents here that fall victim to Fear, Obligation and Guilt (FOG) often.  The book ""Loving Someone with BPD"" is a great follow up to Stop Walking on Eggshells. I think it is essential reading for anyone in a relationship with someone with BPD. It has these scenarios and scripts that really helped me understand the different kinds of disregulation and how to respond to them. This book should be in the sidebar."

BPDlovedones,39n2da,Collectcallfromanan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:25:34 2015 UTC,Sorry to rant all over your thread but I totally know where you are at headwise. Stick the therapy out and I would recommend seeing a couples counselor early in your next relationship you think might last. Seriously. It will help to get a perspective early to know what to expect and be on the same page. I'm pretty sure my ex wife is looking at my reddit. Maybe. So I leave one word comments on every piece of porn and the grossest photos I can find.
BPDlovedones,39n2da,Collectcallfromanan,2,Sat Jun 13 01:48:16 2015 UTC,"Rant all you want! : )  Yeah I think I will definitely try and find a therapist when I consider dating again, just to make sure my head's in the right place.  Did you get a different reddit account? This is my third one and now I don't post anything specific about either of us. But really, if she is on here stalking me then she deserves whatever she reads. Plus she denies she even has BPD and just thinks she's a special special delicate snowflake and the world is a big bad horrible place out to get her.  That's one reason I don't like to dwell on bad things; I spent so much time with a person who crafted her own little career as a Professional Victim and i now believe we can make our lives awesome if we want to. So that's what I am trying to do. Stay positive and happy."
BPDlovedones,39n2da,Collectcallfromanan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:50:48 2015 UTC,"I had one since the beginning of reddit that I don't know the password to and one or two brief throwaways. Back around Christmas, my company got hacked and a few of us were warned to minimize our identity on the internet. I left details out a lot. I want to post for season two of a podcast so I made this one. Within a few posts, I think my ex wife found me. I don't know how. All the stories look pretty similar and detail free to me. A couple of users have PMed me saying she's asking questions but I'm not sure that it isn't just someone else's troll at this point. I've also moved to the I don't give a f with her. We were married. We are long divorced. Creep someone else please?"

BPDlovedones,39n2da,Collectcallfromanan,2,Fri Jun 12 22:44:58 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. She would just use it as more ""evidence"" of what a horrible person I am. I might just write it for myself though and see if that helps."
BPDlovedones,39n2da,Collectcallfromanan,2,Sat Jun 13 00:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I tried blogging. Then just journaling. My nex wife was kind enough to remember the admin password to my blog last year and published all of my drafts and journals and then sent kind of nasty emails to everyone I knew. No one called. Well, one friend called in March and said it went to an old email. It was a journal entry where I had been writing the week before his wedding (I was his best man) and I made a pros and cons list of all the things that could go wrong if I gave him the honest assessment of his wife. My nex and I have been divorced since 2009. Don't speak. I have no idea what possessed her to do it. She even dummied the headers. That takes a very specific psychopathy. She also emailed my lawyers saying they were fired and I had a roommate that had been busted for kiddy porn. I didn't know the guy and his roommate did have my same name but different DOB. Thank god. She said it was because she was mad about a book I had published like five years ago that painted her family in a bad light and her boyfriend had found one of the ten copies that sold and read it. I don't recommend doing anything digital your ex can find. They flip shit over weird stuff."
BPDlovedones,39n2da,Collectcallfromanan,3,Sat Jun 13 00:46:02 2015 UTC,"Wow that is insane! Wow. I did go through everything when she moved out and changed all my passwords just in case she knew any of them.   It's just frustrating not to be able to tell her I think she's full of shit. Actually, she found another reddit account I had previously and read some of what I think of her, but she's so delusional. I feel like she needs to know how much being with her messed up my life for a time and how I am able to overcome it.   I guess I'll just have to be happy that I am now happy."
BPDlovedones,39n2da,sairtwopointoh,2,Sat Jun 13 00:53:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My ex would only come on reddit to hunt me down. I've gotten less vigilant about protecting myself from her nonsense the last few years and I stopped talking about it because I sounded like a crazy person. Also, when I tried to deal with her shit last year or two I started acting exactly like her. It was easier to be distrustful and paranoid and dissociated than it was to do the work and trust someone and not be a toxic abusive asshat. In all honesty, if you dwell on this idea that you can show her a better life or that you don't need her or whatever you are wasting your time and you will make yourself crazy. I did this for many years. This would be my advice to my younger self about the whole thing: live your life, fuck who knows, be happy, write down fleeting summaries of these thoughts and use them as bonfire kindling and don't give the ass monkeys any more space to rent in your head."
BPDlovedones,39n2da,Soundboard_Fez,3,Sat Jun 13 01:00:34 2015 UTC,"omg you are so right. I have come so far in that I don't obsess about what she's doing or think about how she would hate the t.v. show I'm watching and pretend to be ""triggered"" so we'd have to turn it off. All of that really does fade with time. I'm not ready to date people yet because I'm still working on myself and my ability to trust people. I also need to make sure I know what I want and don't get sucked into a relationship that's uneven. I need to get something out of it too.   So I'm holding off and instead of dating, I'm fostering new friendships and enjoying being single SO MUCH. I really do enjoy it! I can do whatever I want.

I feel like these ""illnesses"" people with BPD conjure when something happens they don't like is their way of manipulating care and compassion from the person that is trying to distance themselves.  Or at least that's the case with my SO."

BPDlovedones,39lykd,Soundboard_Fez,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:14:04 2015 UTC,"My wife and I are separating. It was her 'preemptive' choice, because she knew i recorded her craziness, and felt threatened by having to finally face her problems. So she requests separation. I say fine. I was going to write a whole novel explaining how she keeps flip-flopping about demands she makes, only because the point is not to get that, is to get me angry and start a fight. I'm playing Medium Chill like a champ, and this infuriates her.  Every week, multiple times, she makes a demand, and then the next day, gets angry she got it, so she makes the counter demand. Each time angry at me that i'm reasonable and flexible.   Why? Because although she started the separation, she still wants the chaos of the relationship with me, and i'm not giving it to her. I'm more distant every day, and this makes her nuts. It is totally contradictory, but that is why it is a PD.  This hasn't ended. The worst hasn't happened yet. I have to keep going, stay strong and calm, for my son."
BPDlovedones,39lykd,cookieredittor,2,Thu Jun 18 10:53:58 2015 UTC,"Yes... my husband is the one that initiated the conversation about separating (I definitely wanted one, but was waiting for a time my son wasn't around to bring it up in case he raged). When I agreed with him, he got so indignant, like how could I want to leave him? Now I can't hold him to any of the things he said in that conversation, he's digging his heels in.  It's like he thinks he's calling my bluff by threatening divorce and I'll panic and cling to him.  Except I'm not.  And that upsets him even more.  So I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't."
BPDlovedones,39hhly,kathrynthenotsogreat,7,Thu Jun 11 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"You are me two years ago.  I hate to say it, but it doesn't get any better.  For me, it got a whole lot worse.  My son's first year of life was the most violent, most turbulent, most isolating time of my life.  A baby strains even the best relationships to some extent; putting strain on a relationship where one parent has mental health issues (and weed issues, my BPD SO's medication of choice as well) exponentially increases that.  I regret not kicking my husband out during my pregnancy.  I suspect that the stress he put me through from his monthly rages during the course of my pregnancy led to the complications that caused my emergency c-section.   My son is now 18 months old and I'm separating from my husband.  My son is getting old enough to realize what's going on and has been terrified by daddy's rages.  I'm afraid he'll learn that this is how you treat women or how a normal relationship works.  Meanwhile, my husband still feels as though he is somehow the victim in all of this, which means there is zero hope that he'll ever change.    Hugs to you and best of luck."
BPDlovedones,39hhly,always_awake9,5,Thu Jun 11 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"""How would you feel if people kept running from you? ""  I would feel like there was something about me that people didn't want to be around.  Which in turn would lead me to self reflection and probably go to a therapist.  If your SO does have BPD it will take a lot for him to arrive at any introspection. ""I don't think it would help an emotional problem at all.""  This statement isn't accurate.  In fact having other's not tolerate dysfunctional behavior is often a catalyst for change.   ""People with BPD shouldn't be just a lost cause lonely group of people, left on their own to fall apart. They shouldn't just be written off.""  No, they shouldn't but unless you have a license to practice therapy,  you are not qualified to treat him. If you do have a license,  you shouldn't be in an intimate relationship with someone you're treating.  You are about to become a Mother.  Your choices will profoundly impact an innocent little beings life. You have every duty and obligation to put your baby's well being above your desire and above your boyfriends needs. He already has a Mother.  Your baby will only have one....you. It's time to do some growing up."
BPDlovedones,39hhly,mrsmanicotti,4,Fri Jun 12 04:22:10 2015 UTC,"You don't have to GTFO, you don't have to run.  You don't have to enable him to 'help' him (in fact the opposite), you can stay with him as long as you desire and take care yourself.  These things are possible, though hard.   I'm an enabler. I know I am. I have to stop the enabling and take care of myself. But I want to help him.   I think to stop enabling is to take care yourself AND the only way to help him in fact.  I really like your SO's friend/roommate.  He's right and that was a good offer of him (if in good intentions as I presume).  It is VERY HELPFUL to remember that you CAN ALWAYS leave.  That is the only way to end your codependency- you have to realize you don't depend on this relationship.  You HAVE an out.  You can always leave.  You don't have to GTFO, but you have to know you can, live like you could if you choose and be able to GTFO.  I would say that it is very understandable his issues flared up around now.  You are pregnant!  Big life change, not only for you.  They even say that men have some hormonal changed (if memory serves) during pregnancy.    You trip sounds awful to me.  I'm sorry you had such a painful and shitty time, it could have been a great vacation for you.  I can't say that 'he' took that from you, because we need to look mostly at our own roles.  I don't really know how these relationships work with the guy as you describe yours.  I'm a little 'sexist'.. but only in the sense that I recognize men and women are different.  Aside from those differences, I am always more fearful for women, because when my wife was in my face and threatening me there was never a moment I worry that 'she could take me'.  So first off- you need to be more careful than me.  You need to always keep escape an option, not just for the codependency/enabling, but for yours and your child's safety.  I don't think people with BPD are 'bad', not at all.  I don't think they are evil, and I don't think they are 'all' violent.  I think people are and I think these people can behave improperly and impulsively beneath strong emotions in dysregulation.  It isn't 'that' common, but it is possible.  So you need to be strong.  Clearly you need to be strong (and are).  The problem is you need to be strong in every way at all times.  This isn't possible to do perfectly.  You are also going through a new and big time of change, but I suspect you will take it and use it to make yourself even stronger.    My simplest advice besides internalizing and understanding you 'can' leave (to help stop the enabling/codependency).. you need to treat him the age he is acting.  You need to not treat him as your emotional equal, because he isn't when he is acting like that.  In your story on the trip there were many times you perhaps would have benefitted from a more parental role.  You didn't have to wait outside all those coffee shops, you could inform him you won't and you'd like him to keep with you.  Be generous, maybe a few, but not the whole time..  If he isn't happy with that, then he gets left and figures his own consequences out.  He was a teenager at that point.  With the plane tickets at the start.. I would have suggested buying your own to and from, if he wanted to go, he buy his own.  It would be different (and worse) flights if he waited, so the whole matter could have been forced as a yes or no, action/inaction from the start.  On the way back when he threw a tantrum about the flights back, you need to realize he is a child tantrumming at that moment, treat him like it (not condescendingly).  What I mean is, he wants to whine and complain, well I wouldn't internalize or get hurt by any of that.  It was the illogical cries of a five-year-old.  I would inform him he is going to deal with it, I did the best I could, if he would like to come home 'here's your ticket' be glad I arranged your travel back for you or don't.    I don't know any way to handle the tantrums other than validating what I can and not internalizing any of the irrationalities.  I have to treat my wife her age.  If I didn't I would be destroyed all the time and unable to be an unmovable rock when we need me to be.  She finds strength in that and security.  It calms here quicker when I validate what I can, empathise with her emotions, state the truth or what I am doing and stand by it.  We can't negotiate or make ourselves responsible for their emotional regulation-- or else they will NEVER learn how to on their own...  We can't even 'soothe' them all the time- they need to learn to SELFsoothe.. Our ONE-YEAR-OLD is learning that now, it is time for his mother to.  I find solace in the fact that we never could regulate those emotions or really soothe them anyway.  We'll never enable so well that they are able to not have 'disasters' and chaotic tantrums.  At that moment, my wife needs the man of the house- a tough-love, but empathising, unmovable quasi-parent, more than a negotiating partner.  I really recommend you read /u/cookieredditor posts like this one on how to deal with tantrums.  He has two previous submissions I found VERY helpful in his 'hacking the disorder' series."
BPDlovedones,39hhly,Shanguerrilla,3,Thu Jun 11 19:53:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much. I'm just now starting to realize the issues and work on handling them properly, and I'm happy to hear from someone with experience. For a while I've been kind of fumbling around on my own.  You're right about having the option to leave. I had been feeling trapped for a while before I realized there are other options, and it did make me feel better. I've let him put me down a lot lately and he loves to tell me that I need him. It's easy to fall into that storyline.  The ""sexism"" thing is funny, I do know I have to watch out for myself a little more because he is physically strong, but we've weirdly got our roles flipped. He's unable to cope with having a job, so he stays home. I'm a little worried about him being a stay at home dad, but that'll be his role pretty soon. I work full time and generally set the house rules. I drive and he doesn't, and I can build and fix things and he can't. He's emotional and sensitive and more feminine than I am sometimes. But that doesn't mean I'm safe if he gets physically violent. I'm really strong (I used to work manual labor in a warehouse, I've kept up the beefy muscles from it) but he is taller and not weak by any means. He can definitely overtake me if it came down to it.   The perspective of treating them the age they act is really helpful. It's hard because I'd love to be equal partners all the time, but he really does need rules and boundaries set.   His mom coddled him his whole life before I was in the picture, last night she was blaming herself for how selfish and childish he can be. He loves her so much though, and he's (overly) attached to her and praises how she raised him for the most part. I'm worried a bit about how he'll take care of our daughter. I am really nervous that he'll impart his problems on her. What if he coddles her too much? What if he turns her into a mini him? Or worse, what if he blames her for things the way he blames me? I won't be there all day with them to protect her. I'm trying to put aside money to get him into therapy, I can't afford to have her in daycare.   So many problems, but I really do love him, and sometimes things are so wonderful, and I know he really cares. He just has issues.   Thanks for the link too, that's super helpful!"
BPDlovedones,39hhly,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"I'm just now starting to realize the issues and work on handling them properly, and I'm happy to hear from someone with experience.   Kind of wish I didn't have that experience!  I perpetually feel like I am 'just now starting' to realize the issues (in myself and our relationship).  I don't have to figure her out any more.  That was a big step for me.  I spent years trying so hard to appease her, solve her problems, figure her out...  It took years of abuse before I was unable to filter out everything and no longer keep my emotions in control, but we could never negotiate or discuss these problems away.  Sure, I'd get her verbal commitment, occasionally even a hair of her owning her problems, but it never mattered.. because we are talking about real mental health / personality disorder.    The best advice I have is to shift your focus from him.  When you stop focusing on his problems, his behavior, his emotions- you begin to be able to focus on your own.  We are all we can change.  We can change a LOT in our lives and world, even these relationships, but none of that is guaranteed.  We can't depend or be working for their change.  We have to live independent of those outcomes we can't directly control AND be at peace with that.  That was the only recipe I have found for peace or any degree of sanity and happiness in these relationships.  Along that path, comes our OWN version of what 'they' need- painful, insightful, hard to swallow self assessment and self accountability.  With that focus on ourselves, we can do these things.  Spending so long enabling my wife and repressing my emotions, it took TIME before I could even decipher what my needs were.  They were long forgotten.  Let yourself take time in these things.  When I made progress, I found anger, more than before.  Anger isn't bad though, but we need to control it.  When we can control it, it helps us hold boundaries in healthy ways and take care our own needs.  To take care our own needs is NOT selfish, we need to do this to be able to take care of (in healthy ways) our family.  Through that focus on us, self assessment, self accountability/responsibility, and self improvement- we can find self acceptance and even self-love.  We HAVE TO accept ourselves and love ourselves to be able to offer either to anyone else.  Once we start flirting with this stage, things become much easier.  Our healthier lives become more self-fueling.  Give yourself time though, our SO's won't change quickly (and they NEED professional help).  Mine is now getting it, but it still is like watching a tree grow.  In the meantime, I'm okay.  I can't be looking for a destination, because there isn't one.  I can't be reaching to be so 'perfect' that I handle everything in such a way my relationship is a dream-- because I don't have that power and perfection doesn't exist.  Set achievable goals, look for progress over perfection.  This helps us control our emotions further, better accept ourselves, and be our best.  Our SO's need a better significant other- as unruly as their side of the relationship is.. this is true, they need that.  We can be that, but we must do it for us.  We don't have to GTFO, but we have to be able and be less needy than them.  In my experience there is no equal-partnership in any relationship that lasts.  I also recommend you too go to a therapist- they help.  I go now as well."
BPDlovedones,39hhly,mountainman84,3,Thu Jun 11 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"Unless he wants help or wants to change there is fuck all you can do to rectify the situation. Why would he want to change? He already gets what he wants by behaving the way he does. People such as ourselves ""go along to get along"". It is self preservation. I don't know your background but if you learned how to be an enabler by already surviving abusive relationships (familial especially) it is going to be hard to set boundaries and stay resolute... Especially when it comes to managing the resultant rages, fits, and tantrums.  I went through this shit for 2 years with my wife and much like you I genuinely felt bad for her and wanted to stick with the relationship. She didn't want to change and honestly thought I was bluffing when we separated.  We tried everything up to including marriage counseling which she was openly hostile to.  Thankfully we did not have children. It made the break easier. I know you want to make it work for your child but I implore you to think about your own safety and the safety of your unborn child.  You SO is basically at the functioning level of a 2 year old. My mother went through hell trying to make a relationship with my father work. The first years of my life were spent in a toxic, violent, and turbulent environment. My father even threw my mother down a flight of stairs because she wouldn't give him the little money they had for diapers for him to go buy weed. He was a grade a piece of shit and after getting to know him during the last decade of his life I realize it was probably my first experience familiarizing myself with BPD.    Save yourself and get out. He needs to change of his own accord. I've seen it first hand. I was raised by narcissistic and likely BPD people. Children are not an incentive for these people. You are not an incentive. Ultimatums do not work. Please don't put your unborn child through that hell. I consider myself a well adjusted person at this point but it took years of therapy. My therapist said that the first years of my life were the main reason I'd developed my people issues and defense mechanisms. People don't realize that toxic environments harm babies to the level that they do. Babies need a harmonious and happy environment to flourish in. Your SO is miserable and will continue to drag everyone down into his misery just so he has company."

I accept that, for now, I do not have a partner I have a dependent. In 20 years she's gone from a 3rd grade reading level to now being a CNA in second year of college and that's not bad.

BPDlovedones,39g9sf,computerbone,5,Thu Jun 11 14:59:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, I can relate.  Even about the wrist complaint!  That specificity amuses me because scanning found I have carpal tunnel, while her barrage of tests found... nothing. I don't complain about mine (and try not to about anything) because hers ""always hurts more"".  Anyway.  Yes, I can relate to problems in the bedroom.  I do wish mine would go the route of insecurity 'you don't think I'm sexy'.  Mine, following your example playing out, would become vile with vitriol.  She would try to emasculate me.  She used to do this even after sex.  I always have her 'finish' first, then she mentally checks out and starts getting impatient.  Then when up a switch flips in her head and she still lays on me with vitriol.  Foreplay wasn't long enough, I didn't do X right, then emasculating comments and criticism.  I am glad that I am a secure man, and I am grateful to have had plenty of partners before her, because otherwise I might believe her irrationalities.  Even not accepting any of her (baseless) criticism (I do listen to her complaints if within reason), even while not getting defensive (I have no need).. This STILL makes me not desire intimacy with her- why the hell would I?!  That always overshadowed the sex itself.  She is beautiful, but not so much that with that finale the sex is still worth it.  My advice to you and what helped me:  DON'T ACCEPT INADEQUATE SEX!  You take control of YOU.  You are the man.  You control yourself, then you control that bedroom- when you do, she will even let you control her in the bedroom.  You aren't the cuckhold if you are the one turning her down.  If she is giving you crappy sex, then stop and leave her there.  No need.  You can say no, think of all the times you've been ready and denied- that didn't kill you.  You be the one that says no whenever the sex isn't worth it or adequate.  My wife doesn't want a needy man.  She doesn't want to be 'chased'.  She wants a man that is unmovable by her bullshit, and she is then even drawn to me.  Have I perfected this?  No.  The theory is correct though in my practice.  We are honestly still working on things.  My wife WANTS me to initiate, so I do so when I desire.  If she is giving me excuses or mentally checking out and focused elsewhere then I turn it down and will initiate another day.  We had a DEAD bedroom and while not perfect now, we are on the path to better.  Check my post history for an atrociously embarrassing post.  I only left it because I knew others somewhere will relate.  I should have spoke more on this comment's topic in my edit there earlier.. but this was A BIG part of what led us to 'good' sex multiple times a week (from NO sex for months at a time).  If you want 'good' sex, you need to not accept 'bad' sex.  If you do not, then you are giving her all the power in the bedroom.  It seems like an extension from general relationship dynamics- the one who needs the other less is always in control.  Since mine is a 'lash outward' kind of gal and yours seems the opposite, I won't ramble about what helps me curb that behavior of criticism following sex, but along with some action plans that help, being the one initiating or turning it down along with having more sex really helped her self esteem and security in herself and me (IE: that alone has helped with the frequency of her attacks after sex).  EDIT: One more thing.  So we just had a great evening, but it reminded me of something else VERY important.  These are exceptionally sensitive and needy women, right?  I am not for being responsible for their emotions and doing everything they think they want to appease them or positively rewarding neediness... BUT it is extremely helpful for me and her to still treat her like we are dating.  Aside from being more of a leader around the house, it really helps to be in the dating mindset.  She responds well to it.  Some physical touch at surprising times and intimate ways, being charming, just having fun.  It was more entertaining than simply coexisting and it really helps get her in the mood.  She doesn't get horny from just taking her to the bedroom or scheduling sex time, it starts hours before and with my wife is best to naturally evolve (since she hates schedules and planning).  I realize this is Man: 101 stuff, but tonight just reminded me how helpful it is when it is conscious.  If you want her to long for you and see you like the man she can't keep her hands off from, rather than hope she becomes that way, be a man she can't keep her hands off from.  We do have that ability.  I DO realize this isn't some magical fix for dead bedrooms, but I also believe that we have a lot more control and influence in our lives and relationships than we at first realize."
BPDlovedones,39g9sf,Shanguerrilla,2,Thu Jun 11 18:27:17 2015 UTC,Reading your other post reminds me of something I have noticed. Everything is a self fulfilling prophesy. They can't sleep because they are worried they won't be able to sleep. They can't cum because they throw a tantrum because they are worried they won't cum. They can't please a partner because they feel like they have to please a partner or they'll leave and it makes them feel trapped. What a head trip it is. Thanks for being honest about your experience the shame can be brutal.
BPDlovedones,39g9sf,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"That is very much something I too have noticed.  It makes sense with the understanding of 'what' she suffers from.    To be clear, I feel pretty confident she is an uBPD (undiagnosed)... but through my own change and path- she has decided to go to therapy.  My therapist (I began going when I realized I became codependent and was being abused) before he saw her felt confident she was BPD, after ~3 visits he hasn't diagnosed her as that yet, but has said he knows for sure she has C-PTSD (complex PTSD, which is very overlapping with BPD beside the splitting and attachment issues- which is why I think she is also BPD).  Anyway, yea I've noticed that as well.  The most clear way to 'help' (though it must be done in outcome independence) is to be the leader and the rock, to wear armor and be unmoved.  My wife responds WELL to this.  Her emotions are extreme and disregulated, her attachment fears make her want to run and leave me before I leave her (though I am clear that I CAN, I am clearer that I won't without good reason or without her trying to run).  They NEED to lean on us.  Not to regulate their emotions, but to trust that we are secure.  She tests for this very often when I am NOT projecting that strength.  When I have been successful at taking over my own life and leading in my home, even my indomitable wife has been able to submit.  I can't 'dominate' her though, she has to feel I am strong and choose it.  To 'try' to dominate reeks of weakness.  This sounds rambling and cliche, but it is true in my experience.  Our bedroom life has improved dramatically as I've gone this road.  She needs to see she cannot hurt me, that I protect myself and am above her and her attacks or BS- then she can feel secure following my lead and trust I can protect her.  When she tantrums or has anxiety she needs to feel I am a rock, then she can be calm and quicker self-soothe.  When I am in control in my home and bedroom, she is able to not get lost in a hamster wheel of thought and anxiety.  When I'm not focused on her and instead on me, she feels less pressure.    The last time that she lashed out or inward after/around sex was the time I wrote about in that Deadbedrooms post months ago.  While we cannot 'fix' them, nor are responsible to- there is truly a lot that we can do to influence and improve these relationships-- but they have to choose us and choose to follow our lead.  This being the case, when I work on and improve myself, make myself stronger and more attractive, my life and world become more attractive.  She is more attracted to me and attracted to be in my life.  If I make myself a better leader in my life and relationship, she is quicker and more likely to follow my lead.  Do I control that outcome?  Absolutely not.  I don't work for the outcome though, I work for me.  In my experience, these things work and help.  Even if the relationship ended, I would be happy with my choice as I am more content, at peace, and working to always progress into a better version of myself."
BPDlovedones,39g9sf,Shanguerrilla,2,Fri Jun 12 15:54:19 2015 UTC,I have tried to explain to her how much happier you can be when you hold yourself accountable for your own happiness. I suppose it was hypocritical. Thanks again and good luck.

I suspect that some of his recent texts were just projection, which gives you some pretty great insight into his mind- specifically the ones about how breaking up isn't what you really want.   I've noticed that many break up stories on this subreddit include accusations of being immature and cowardly; I've been called those things myself as well!

When I would say how he HAD hurt me in the past, he would demand to know examples, so I would list them - and then he would berate me for dwelling on the past, not forgiving him ever even though HE forgave ME, etc.)   This is incredibly familiar to me...  until my wife's tantrums led to rages that could have ended my career and with most men would have ended in divorce (though I was ready to leave/have her leave).  Still she sees the abusive BS as 'my' misinterpretation and justified by a look in my eyes or her perception of a neutral face to be negative (with all the mind-reading that enables her).  She wants better examples than that moment- but if I offer them I am a demon for dwelling and never forgiving her (though I almost always treat her the same, and DO forgive her..  just not forget).  Very familiar..  This part isn't meant to be as it could be taken, I don't mean this hurtful or comparative, but I don't think your Ex is entirely wrong here (though the 'different version of you' would be completely inversed from his desire):    he essentially says he needed a better ""version"" of me who did this and that differently to make him happy.   It wasn't your responsibility to fix him and you could not have.  I do believe these relationships need a 'better version of us'.  We can't enable them and give into their neediness trying to reach a level that satisfies them, because no external force can.  They need us to build strong boundaries, empower them by not holding them up and static in their emotional maturity.  You did everything right for a normal adult relationship in most circumstances, but if he was uBPD not desiring personal accountability (or whatever he is, by the sounds of it)- he was not a 'normal' adult.  I try to frame this as treating my wife 'whatever age she is then acting'.  She cannot handle more responsibility or expectation than the age she is acting at that moment.  I can't coddle her when she is clawing for me to be responsible for her emotions.  I can't satisfy her logically in exposition when she argues and 'appears' to desire hearing how or what is wrong in her behavior.  As your Ex desired you to show ""in ACTION"" that you care, the best action I know of to teach/show the unacceptable behavior- is to not accept it.  The best action I can find to teach/show I care is to do so and not let her pleading, manipulation, neediness, or passive aggression (or attempted overt aggression) make me falter.  In all I have been able to discern over the last years with my wife, this seems the only way.  I WOULD NOT take this route with a girlfriend.. My wife (mostly) saved this side of her for after marriage, but I suspect it would have emerged had we lived together or been spending nights together before.  It isn't our responsibility to hold up boundaries and carry the world on our shoulders for our SO's, I simply choose to for myself for now at a different stage in life and relationship.   You are wise in your end synapsis.  You left when it was prudent and even best to leave FOR him.  He needs to grow up, grow more responsible and more generally grow.     My advice to people in situations with people like this is to write down everything they have done that hurt you, and read it over, and ask yourself if the good times are worth the bad.   This is great.  It is oftentimes very difficult to isolate ways these relationships are worth keeping.  We can't keep dumping into them our most valuable resource in this life just because we have already invested so much- that stock may never rise.  I'd be lying if I said I am still married to my wife for her, I'm only here today for myself.  I'd say I stay for my son, but I feel the opposite.. I watch him and see there may be a time I must leave her for him.  Today I just work on me and try to live in this moment.  There is much we can do to protect ourselves and make our lives enjoyable when we end the codependence these relationships claw for.  Yet I would be lying if I said I didn't understand how easily that can still be judged as not enough."
BPDlovedones,39cqmm,Shanguerrilla,2,Thu Jun 11 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much!  Damn, ending your career, that's really tough.. I'm sorry that the same thing happens with you guys. Exactly, I agree with the forgive but not forget thing.  That's a great way to put it, ""better version of us""! I definitely agree. It would take a lot of work from both of us for sure, but on different things. If I was at a different point in my life I can see myself having tried to make it work.  It sounds like you have a good plan of what to do, and I think you're awesome for looking out for yourself, considering your son and her, and putting all the effort into doing what you feel is right!! I can't even imagine having these behaviors show up after you got married - that's got to be tough on both of you. Although I completely understand how people can appear one way and change very very quickly. One of my friends was really confused about the behaviors I told them about because they had not seen that side of my ex, just the friendly great side.  Thank you so much for replying, and good luck in life's next adventures!  p.s. I love the stocks analogy!"
BPDlovedones,39cqmm,mrsmanicotti,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:01:37 2015 UTC,"Luckily she didn't mess my career up really.  It was funny as what she did, if I had done so, my boss would have taken serious, but seeing it come from my wife he was more like 'damn, your wife telling me that is f-ed up... you guys have some problems', and offered me a bit of support or leniency.    Certainly can relate to the incredulity of close friends / family to that side of them.  Hell, it took me years to get past believing her lies or my own.  The 'I'm just being sensitives' and 'that bad stuff happened, but it was last week and things are good right now- it's in the past'.  lol.  There were red flags in the relationship pre-marriage.  I didn't give them due gravity.  It wasn't until the very night we were married and without any external influence she was bouncing and twisting in bed, cussing and flailing her extremities, riddled with anxiety she 'wouldn't' be able to sleep (no shit huh?  not like that)- leading to a tantrum all her own and begging me to take her to an old guy's house (not a lover, a 70+ year old surrogate father type), that I realized how grave my future.  I didn't take her then, that night and the next ~3.5 years I somehow stayed unemotional during her tantrums... but always tried to talk things out and fix things *mistakenly.  It hollows a person out though and it gets to the point you either have no emotions left (enabling) or you blow up.  I was about to blow up.  This is still my current adventure, things are getting better and she is getting help.  I do believe we can make it, but whether we do or not, hard choices or not, I know my son and I will be good- she can be too if she comes with us."
BPDlovedones,39dkjk,rugalwayspulledout,8,Thu Jun 11 01:18:15 2015 UTC,"BPDs have the unfortunate habit of assigning intentions to other people, and once they've decided that you're going to hurt them, they will act out until the prophecy self-fulfills or until they can cognitive dissonance their way into believing that you did what they're accusing you of (even if you didn't).  Why do you want to date a BPD guy who refuses to get treatment? There is almost a guarantee that his behaviour will become worse and worse and that he'll continue to break you down for not constantly intuiting his emotional whims and catering to them.  I think you should go on that trip! You deserve to make yourself happy."
BPDlovedones,39dkjk,avro_lanc,2,Thu Jun 11 02:17:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input! I guess I keep hoping he will get treatment...I know I can't make him go or change him for that matter.  I'm definitely going on my trip.
BPDlovedones,39dkjk,silent-shade,4,Thu Jun 11 03:28:25 2015 UTC,"I know most of you will tell me good riddance but I've invested a lot of love, time and energy into making this relationship work so I'm willing to try a new angle.   First, I think you have a right to believe or not to believe in the future of the relationship, and decision is always up to you. That said, the one thing you should NOT assign importance to in your reasoning, is the amount of time and energy already invested. I know it sounds counterintuitive. Still, experience proves it to be sound advice.  About your trip and explanations. First, I believe you should go no matter what. Do not explain things when he is angry, wait it out and talk when he is calm. Say you would have also been uncomfortable and a little jealous if the roles were reversed. Then say that your trip is not about him, but about you. That you will go (make it a ""will"", not an ""if"") not to punish him or make him feel bad, but to reward yourself and make you feel good. Expect huge storm immediately. Do not engage in any discussions. Let him suffer through it. Let him understand he is not the center of the universe. It WILL be painful, but you have to not budge. Ignore the anger if you can. Leave for a while if you must. It is a painful lesson you are teaching him, but it is for the best. Truly it is.  I wish you the best of luck."

BPDlovedones,39dkjk,mrsmanicotti,4,Sun Jun 14 01:40:42 2015 UTC,"I know he is feeling abandoned and is irrationally jealous because he won't be there. I think I would be a bit uneasy if shoe were on the other foot but I wouldn't demand he cancel the trip.    You've already got the right idea; validate how he's feeling, recognize that you may feel uneasy if the roles were reversed, assure him that you love him and there's no reason to doubt you. You pretty much hit the nail on the head already, perhaps unknowingly.   Cancelling the trip will undoubtedly reinforce his negative ideas about you and your intentions. It's likely that doing so would actually have worse connotations than going on the trip. By all means, enjoy your vacation and perhaps if you have some down time, do some reading on BPD and learn about what you have control over."
BPDlovedones,39cpft,uBPD_SO,7,Wed Jun 10 21:49:01 2015 UTC,"Uh, my BPDSO is probably the most agile, dexterous, athletic,  physically coordinated person I have ever met. He does lie for no apparent reason at times though."
BPDlovedones,39cpft,mrsmanicotti,4,Thu Jun 11 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"I don't really follow how he lied about the 7.82..  You say he had it and that he makes a lot of accidents/mistakes.  Wouldn't it stand to reason that he accidentally paid 180?  I'm not defending him, I'm sorry you are dealing with a hard time, I just think it is important to not get angry about things that were entirely accidental.  Could it have been on purpose?  Sure, I don't know.  A lot of times 'accidents' might be.. there is too much shit in life to get upset or pick up arms about every injustice.  I find when I did, that it was too much for my VERY emotionally sensitive wife to handle and it conflates or obscures the bigger issues.  For instance: two days ago.  My wife lost her 10+ number of sunglasses in the couple years.  I told her she can borrow my nice ones, but DON'T LOSE THEM.  She comes home, not wearing glasses.  I ask her, she laughs and flippantly is like 'yea I guess I lost them, I looked and couldn't find them'.  Okay...  WTF?  So I ask a few questions to try to figure out if they are in the car or gone at a destination.  She has no idea.  I never got angry with her, there was no point, it was an accident.  Yes, she could be 'more mindful', but I gotta be honest here- I need her to gain mindfulness like crazy in this relationship and this is about the bottom rung of that ladder along that.  I was a bit upset that she never apologized or seemed remorseful, just laughed about losing my nice glasses... I still didn't press the issue though I playfully chastised her.  I can't be so defensive or sensitive about her accidents or 'accidental' sliiiiightly improper behavior.  I have to save my corrections for her passive aggression / abusive behavior and the come-to-Jesus talks for the important issues; we still have plenty of those to tackle."

I'm not defending him, I'm sorry you are dealing with a hard time, I just think it is important to not get angry about things that were entirely accidental.   You're not wrong. But he had to skip the ""pay balance"" in order to ""pay other amount."" At which point any rational person would realize ""This isn't what I want, because I don't know the final balance exactly."" But instead of paying the full amount, he decided fuck it, I think it's about $180.00. Those were his words. So in one way it was a ""mistake"" in another it was dishonest and lazy. He admits to all of that. I get angry about lying, I'm not going to conform that reaction, it's a perfectly reasonable thing to get angry about. I didn't yell or scream, or anything. I just asked calmly if we could go over the bills again."
BPDlovedones,39cpft,Shanguerrilla,3,Thu Jun 18 04:53:01 2015 UTC,"I feel you.  I can see how that makes sense to you, but there are things that make sense to my wife and not me (or visa versa).  Just playing devil's advocate.  When I can remember I try to do that in the back of my mind for my wife.  I still often fail to see her 'nobler' motivations.. but sometimes they are there, even when mistakes.  I guess..  A big part of my own personal problem is perfectionism.  I don't get that way with other people, my wife included, but as she sometimes gets stuck believing I think or act or am motivated by the delusions or things that do her- I too do that.  Sometimes I expect her to be as mindful as I am, as eccentric, as obsessive- she isn't though.  She is impulsive, impatient, unplanning, and unorganized.  When I recognize that, there are many real ways that together (when both more balanced) we can BEST balance each other.  She is very much my opposite and I am NOT perfect.. so in a lot of ways I try to look for ways to appreciate our differences.  When at our best, we can bring out the best in each other.  That said, I feel like part of your best over your partner might be organization and mindfulness.  Maybe you need to be the one who handles the finances?"

BPDlovedones,39cpft,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:01:52 2015 UTC,"but you're presumption that I need to be more compassionate is pretty rude.   I can be an asshole, I didn't understand you until I read the grandparent comment to the one you replied to, where I rambled a little more on what occurred that day.  I don't really see where I implied you just need to be more compassionate, but if I did I can't say now that being so hurts relationships.    What I was trying to convey in the one you replied here was instead that sometimes we have to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of others.  I related it to my relationship in that, it is easy for me to judge my wife's actions or thoughts based on my own.  I'd never do X, why would she think I meant Y when if I experienced what she did I'd think Z..  She does the same to me, that is pretty basic human nature.  What it means to me though, relates to what I was presuming and suggesting.  I can relate to this, but this is what I mean:    At which point any rational person would realize ""This isn't what I want, because I don't know the final balance exactly."" But instead of paying the full amount, he decided fuck it, I think it's about $180.00.   When I start thinking ""any rational person would do whatever (like me),"" I am exploring another person's behavior with my thoughts, perspective, and experiences, but everyone isn't like me (luckily).    You described someone who was driving you crazy because of   how ""clumsy"" he is. He isn't uncoordinated, he doesn't pay attention.   You even say that is how you found this sub and diagnosed him a uBPD at first.    I don't know all the backstory, but rather than trying to use my relationship to get yours like mine (believe me, you don't want that), I was simply suggesting you understand he is inattentive, clumsy, often overwhelmed, or unthoughtful..  Once we understand a person's strengths and weaknesses we can not enable them while still not relying on them to be something they aren't.  It's a fine line though.  That said, I wasn't trying to be rude here or there and hope things get better."

He's clumsy because he doesn't pay attention, he doesn't fix it he laughs about the spills he doesn't clean up.  He screams, punches walls, throws my things on the lawn when I catch him in a lie.  Plain and simple, I don't give a flying fuck about seeing his point of view anymore.   I have HOURS of recorded screaming. I have dozens of pictures of broken things, always mine, food splatter on walls, and oohh the bruises, the cuts.

For me after my relationship I was initially worried, but now I am not.  I don't think crazy can be hidden at all.  It always has to be directed at someone.  All you really have to ask is ""Does this person hate the people currently closest to them?  Do they hate the people who raised them?""  I think the only real worry is whether I can have proper boundaries.  For me at least my current boundaries are, not living with someone, not falling in love with someone."

Your story sounds a lot like my own, even the years married and together..  We are hanging on and she has finally started therapy.  It moves so slow that sometimes I still feel very wore out or lack the desire to keep trying, but my wife hasn't cheated yet or physically abused me- either would be her opting out of a relationship to me (as it was you).   I can recommend a book you may find helpful as to the main focus on your post (the ""you"" side).  It is very healthy that you are turning inward with honest self assessment.  I think continuing that process, going to therapy (I do now as well), and perhaps reading books focused on the topic while making conscious improvements in your own life-- is the only way to not end up in these relationships again.

If she keeps telling you her family is crazy, nosy, or she can't keep friends for longer than a few months, etc., those are flags. Childhood trauma increases the risk of BPD, so abuse, molestation, divorce, can also be signs to watch out for.   I'm not saying don't date anyone who has that, but usually if someone has BPD, their family knows something is wrong with them. Hindsight is 20/20, but if I had only listened to his grandmothers, I might have avoided the rollercoaster of pain and psychological trauma."

Based on my own experience and from what I've seen here, there is only one way to co-exist in a relationship with someone with uBPD (untreated BPD); that is to be an enabler who re-inforces their warped view of reality, giving up your freedom of action and thought in the process.  Sadly, it sounds like you are already far along in this regard by allowing her to limit your access to the world because of her warped world view.   She will not get better on her own, especially not while she is married to an enabler (I know, I was one).  If she does not get real serious treatment for her disorder, she will never be capable of having a healthy relationship with anyone.  Note: your current relationship is not healthy for either of you.  The worst of this, is that someone with BPD will be extremely resistant to admitting they have any flaws whatsoever, so getting them to the point of therapy and treatment is damn near impossible.  If you don't have kids, get out now."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,Churn,2,Mon Jun 8 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"She has a therapist and acknowledges that she had BPD when she is stable. Only when she is raging is when she forgets all of that.  I admit that I am probably more of an enabler than I should be, but that is mostly because when i set a boundry and try not to budge, she threatens suicide or spending an exorbitant amount of money online.   What can I do to combat that? Last time I ignored her about the money issue, I found $2000 of charges on the credit card. Last time i tried to hold the boundry against her suicide threats, she had a handfull of pills to her mouth. Those were both extreme situations early on, but i do my best to not let it get to that point again."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,Churn,5,Mon Jun 8 20:42:00 2015 UTC,"I lost so much money during my marriage.  I'd find that she had 3 or 4 department store cards, all maxed out, and behind on payments, with fees piling up on them.  I'd chew her out, we'd fight, I'd pay them off.  About a year later rinse/repeat.  Keep in mind that she didn't work, I paid all the bills, gave her an allowance of 3,000/month and then she'd still run out of money and tell me things like, ""if you want our son to have milk for his cereal, you need to give me money to buy groceries.""  Of course she thrived on the conflict and the arguments which I am just not wired for.  She manipulated and took advantage of me in so many ways over the entire marriage, it was pure hell.  The times she did go to a therapist, it was only as long as it was ""couples therapy to fix me"".   As soon as they would ask her to talk about her childhood, what was it like growing up for her, she would flip out, yell scream, bolt out of the office and vow to never go back.   As if the therapist had accused her or her parents of something.  Just plain crazy.  Immediately after our divorce, she slit her wrists, took pictures of the wounds, texted a picture to our 15 year old son(told him he made her do it).   And then later, she fired a gun at family members, and has threatened to kill me and others multiple times for ""ruining her life.""  I have so much sympathy for you and what you are going through, but for a uBPD, sorry I'm clean out of tissues and have unsubscribed from the drama that surrounds them.  I recommend that you do the same before things get worse.  Trust me, they always do."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,Churn,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:55:06 2015 UTC,That sounds terrible.  I really hope we dont get to that point. It is why I have been looking into her disorder as much as I can to find a way to at least keep it in check.   I can handle occasional arguments and the insults now just slide right off of my back. I have heard of others who have been successful at maintaining a relationship with a BPD sufferer and am hoping to be one of those success stories. I am just looking for advice from another who has been able to consistently keep their loved one's BPD rage in check long enough for them to calm down.
BPDlovedones,3928d8,mrsmanicotti,3,Mon Jun 8 21:04:45 2015 UTC,"I hear you.  When I first started visiting this subreddit and the one that preceded it, I thought I had encountered a couple of redditors who had found that elusive balance of establishing boundaries and getting their BPDSO treatment.  However, over time the few that I knew of finally resigned even after being vocal to people like me who say ""get out"".  They would point out that it's possible to stay and have a happy relationship and cite their methods etc...  Eventually, they all called it quits...and came here to share/get support as it got really ugly.  I don't blame the persons with BPD, I don't they they are in control anymore than a tiger who attacks a zebra.  It's just their nature, but I won't live with a tiger or someone with BPD."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,Churn,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"The thing is, she was perfectly fine the 2 years I dated her before marriage. It wasn't until after we moved away from her hometown and her parents that she started showing BPD symptoms and isolating herself form the world.   Is it common for it to manifest later on like that?"
BPDlovedones,3928d8,Shanguerrilla,9,Mon Jun 8 21:16:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, very common.  In my case we dated and lived together for 5 years. Six months into our marriage, boom, it started. I was utterly bewildered.  I was the ""angel"", ""center of his world"" and suddenly I was the cause of something being wrong with his life.  He accused me in a variety of ways of not paying enough attention to him. It didn't make sense, I was the same person,  he just saw me different.  I spent almost a year trying to meet his expectations until I realized he just kept raising them. I finally started keeping a diary/calendar noting our interactions.  After a while it was clear in black and white.  He would say ""You never.... or you always. .."" But I had everything documented and came to understand,  he had a different version of reality based on his distorted feelings. The notebook really helped me see I wasn't loosing my mind and I was ability to be firm and not let him manipulate me into participating in his ever shifting demands. I feel more at ease and confident with my self and had made a decision to not let his moods control me. I am allowed to be happy and enjoy life at the same time that he complains and is bitter and negative. I have read on this sub time and again how in the beginning the BPD places their SO on a pedestal and then suddenly ""splits"" and blames their SO for all  their problems.  You can't internalized their grievance,  they are not rational."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,Shanguerrilla,4,Tue Jun 9 04:41:03 2015 UTC,"On this I don't know.  My ex used what's called ""love bombing"" to entice me into marrying her within months of meeting.  As much as each person with BPD is similar there will be differences, perhaps your wife was able to keep up her love bombing charade for 2 years?  Maybe someone else will have some input on this."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,1978_anon_guy,2,Tue Jun 9 13:06:00 2015 UTC,"I had to look up what that meant, but it does not sound like what my wife was doing while we were dating. We moved in together after only 6 months of dating and, while sometimes she would get a little moody, she never fully raged. She and I just got along well together, hung out together, etc. It did not seem over the top at the time by any means.  Granted, while she did indicate to me that she was ready for marriage fairly early on, I wanted to date her longer and live with her before making the decision. It is what prompted her moving in with me. That and some minor depression that she occasionally suffered from was the only indication that she may have mental problems."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,Churn,2,Tue Jun 9 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"No, mine didn't love bomb me either or if it was her version of love bombing... it was pretty much a normal relationship and I'd like her to start love bombing again!  I will say this:  BPD very much is a disorder that affects interpersonal relationships.  It is common that the only people who 'see' the tantrums or most extreme behaviors, oftentimes the only or at least 'main' targets, are those closest to them.  My wife doesn't invest enough to typically get 'weird' about her friends.  She keeps them at a distance.  She does a lot with people, but doesn't have any super super close friends except maybe those (still at a distance) who she sacrifices and does a lot for and they treat her like a saint.  Now where she does unleash the beast is me and my family.  She is always imagining slights with my family and seeing things not there.  This too only started after marriage.  She goes through idealization and devaluation the strongest with my mother and seems to have a weird perspective of her and I relationship (we aren't very close).  That was one thing that occurred before marriage.  As much as I never talk to my mother and avoid her, my wife always acted like I was closer to my mother than her... it is weird if you knew our relationship.  With something that is incited by interpersonal relationships, it is no wonder that much of it isn't apparent until we are very close.  Aside from affecting relationships, the disorder has an unhealthy attachment aspect.  That ties into this as well.  It is no wonder that many people only begin to experience certain things after marriage.  In fact, with my wife her divorce plays always seemed to me to be attachment related..  Fear I would leave her for her crazy behavior.  Then when the storm has passed, she would want me to leave her or not understand why I would want to be with her (towards the end of last year... me too)."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,Churn,3,Tue Jun 9 16:04:49 2015 UTC,"The night we got married for me..  never saw the angry/scared illogically child side of her before that night... Wondered what the he'll I got myself into.  Now I know.  Churn has some great wisdom he's sharing and I thoroughly am thankful for his sharing it.  I also see and commiserate with your perseverance and desire for a healthy relationship with your wife.  I will say that not every sufferer is the same (though the experiences relate) the extremity can vary along with the potential future.  I get a lot of hope reading the straight BPD sub.  Clearly I get most out of this one, but there you'll see many sufferers desperate for better and many improved living good lives.  It isn't 100% bleak, there isn't a world of change we can cause on our own, but there is a lot of ways we can shoot ourselves in the foot.  My personal belief ties into my wife also taking everything back to divorce threats... There was no way to not have a controlled and abusive relationship, no way to hold any boundaries... Until I could call that hand she always drew.  I had to be willing to lose her before I had a chance at keeping her (in any healthy relationship).  How you'll do that, I don't know.  Jury is still out what my own future holds, but things are worlds better and she's now in therapy.  Churn may have called my marriage as well, but I am satisfied today and can accept what I can't control if it comes."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,LLeoj,2,Tue Jun 9 08:22:24 2015 UTC,Good luck to you and your SO. I hope you can both find what is best for you.
BPDlovedones,3928d8,Churn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:30:44 2015 UTC,"I hope you have full custody / guardianship of your 15 year old son at this point Churn I hope you did the right thing and notified the court about her pics to your son. She should not really have anything other than monitored contact with him at this point. I can see my soon to be ex-wife doing the same thing 10 years from now. In my case, things are only going to get worse for my soon to be ex, her parents will eventually die, she won't have any caretakers (she'll probably turn our kids into care-takers) and (with her parents gone) she won't have any enablers to trigger her and also anyone to pay her bills. Not that I care at this point, since she's caused me (and my kids) so much pain that really I just want to gain full custody of the kids (I'm pretty sure she'll slip up, she always does) and job transfer out of state."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,1978_anon_guy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you and yes I have sole custody of my son (he is 17 now).  He's doing great and is planning for college.  FYI - in my case, I did not fight her for custody as my son was 15 at the time.  I worked hard at getting the divorce done as quickly as possible with joint-custody knowing that my son would choose not live with her on his own (nobody can live happily with her).  I figured it would take 6 months or so before they were fighting so badly that he'd be staying with me for longer and longer periods of time as he got older.  Instead, the divorce was final on a Friday, she attempted suicide by pills twice that weekend and by Monday, I had my son with me and filed a motion to change custody in the divorce.  By Thursday, she was hospitalized with the self inflicted wounds to her wrists and by the time we appeared before the judge she had sent enough text messages to me and our son to make his decision an easy one.  I hope things work out as well for you and your kids."
BPDlovedones,3928d8,cookieredittor,9,Tue Jun 9 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"i do my best to not let it get to that point again.   Also want to add, that comment there is why she is in control.  She will push past your limits to get what she wants.  And don't ever kid yourself into thinking her desires can be reasonable ones.  She can't handle a calm and content life if it were given on a silver platter.  Plan and take a vacation with her if you doubt this.  Anything that should be a great happy time in anyone's life, will be when she is the most uncomfortable and will create drama/conflict in order to feel 'normal'.  Her 'normal' is not the world you or anyone else wants to live in."

Looking back on my relationship with a uBPD this always seemed so weird to me but I couldn't put my finger on it."
BPDlovedones,3922a9,CynicTheLion,5,Mon Jun 8 18:09:38 2015 UTC,"How much independent confirmation do you have of this background?    Mine was a serial exaggerator for sympathy.  Not that her life was any kind of cakewalk, and she grew up in a messed up house, but a lot of the tales she spun are figments of her imagination specifically tailored to the woe-is-me complex."
BPDlovedones,3922a9,Soundboard_Fez,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:15:51 2015 UTC,I can confirm that she was indeed married by her friends and a widow. I have seen her disabled child. Her husband is confirmed deceased. I don't think I need to say anymore. It's not a fantasy or imagination. Everything I have said is true. I know some BPD individuals have these fantasies but she really did experience all this.
BPDlovedones,3922a9,silent-shade,3,Mon Jun 8 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"What I read here is a scary, incredibly traumatic history. She does great by just staying alive. I would imagine that your presence is very important.  As to what to do - I wish I could help more, but I only have one idea. One way or another, you will need to forgive yourself. By doing this, you will feel better, more balanced, more able to help her and make amends.  As for hurting inside, I believe she is, I believe she has been for a very very long time now. Make amends to her by reassuring her of your presence, of your unconditional love, forgive yourself and make amends to yourself, to your own integrity.  Send you a hug and my best wishes."
BPDlovedones,3922a9,silent-shade,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"It's true. She has been hurting for many years and still continues to hurt. It's sad.     Today, I plan on making amends today but scared that it might turn out by because I have apologized her many times and I feel like I will just be repeating the same words in a different way.      To her, I am afraid it might be redundancy to her like ""Yeah. He is just going to say sorry again and make the same mistake and blow up on me again. I am tired of hearing it."""
BPDlovedones,3922a9,silent-shade,2,Mon Jun 8 20:01:25 2015 UTC,"Than do not say sorry. Say something else, something you have not tried before. Say how much you value her, for instance."
BPDlovedones,3922a9,way2manycooks,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:10:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do plan to tell her how much she means to me and hopefully that reassures her that I want to be with her because she has said many times that she wants to leave me because she is unhappy with me, but many times I think she says that out of her ""moments"" when she is very stressed. But does she genuinely does not want to be with me? I am unsure. Maybe. Maybe not. I will see  what happens today."
BPDlovedones,3922a9,Shanguerrilla,2,Mon Jun 8 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"I wish you the best. Either way, it is not possible to keep a partner against her will. Together or individually, happiness is possible for both of you. I have found it a great help to keep this thought in my head and in my heart. Future and happiness are possible for us together and also possible for me without her and for her without me. Life and relationships are much less scary this way.  Hang tight!"
BPDlovedones,3922a9,Shanguerrilla,2,Mon Jun 8 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"I said a lot of mean things to her that probably made her feel worthless and rejected. It probably caused permanent damage. She was willing to leave me.   It sounds like you've already apologized but now I think you need to step back an evaluate the way you communicate with her. It will be important for you to find a happy balance between listening, validating, and standing by your boundaries.   I'm trying to work on staying grounded during arguments to assure that I don't begin mimicking his poor coping mechanisms. It's one thing to say but another thing to do. It's sort of a knee-jerk reaction to respond angrily to anger. But it's not an effective way to communicate with someone who has BPD (and PTSD). My BPDSO has also had a very traumatic upbringing which needs to be recognized through validation but not used as an excuse for his bad behavior. Again, it's all a strange balancing act I still falter to manage after 5 years.  As you realize, it takes an emotional rock to really ""be there"" for a loved one with BPD and the sooner you realize you only have control over your behaviors, the better. Mastering the art of interrupting your negative responses will increase the chances that you can both be happier in your relationship if that's what you're committed to doing.   Many warm wishes being sent your way."
BPDlovedones,3922a9,way2manycooks,2,Tue Jun 9 12:58:58 2015 UTC,"Yesterday, I spoke to my girlfriend and things went well and all is good. I told her how I honestly felt and she interpreted what I said well."

BPDlovedones,3922a9,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:23:27 2015 UTC,Good advice!
BPDlovedones,390kcl,silent-shade,6,Mon Jun 8 10:57:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're not going to ""solve"" that issue while she's in attack mode. There needs to be consequences for her actions and you need to be consistent with them.  Also...just gonna throw this out there...is she aware of and trying to get help with her BPD? Because if not, it's only going to get worse. How long are you going to let yourself be treated like that?"
BPDlovedones,390kcl,RudolphRed,4,Mon Jun 8 15:33:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the comment!  Sure, there was no point and no way to discuss the subject matter. There might have been a way to discuss herself, her reactions. Perhaps. I don't know, may be reassure and calm her down. I feel like I could have gone to the kitchen for half an hour instead of out of the apartment for two days. Perhaps. Or may be not.  You are right, there must be consequences. And I will have to behave consistently in the future. May be not that harshly, but in the same line. And never slip.  I have only recently found out about personal boundaries at all. Incredible, in the past I was letting my exes walk all over me. Took whatever came as if I've deserved it. No wonder I feel clumsy now, setting limits consciously may be for the first time.  As for your question, she knows she has BD. In fact, she was very open about it, told me herself very early. That is why I am not bewildered, or in despair. I am reading a lot, also I've discovered this sub - an inspiration, a wonderful place. Alas, she does not believe in treatment. But this topic I am leaving for the future."
BPDlovedones,390kcl,cookieredittor,3,Mon Jun 8 17:55:28 2015 UTC,"Some of your ideas are on the right tract. Have you read the books ""Stop Walking on Eggshells"" and ""Loving someone with BPD""? They have the answers you seek, and will teach you what you did wrong, and how to do differently in the future.   This will be a hard path, setting up boundaries will make her go NUTS, but it is the only way forward. Everything else is making things worse, so you must become strong and have strong boundaries.  The stuff about resisting treatment and all that is very familiar to me, my wife is the same. This is a really bad sign. Read my post history if you want to see how I changed a lot of things in our relationship, but without her getting treatment, stuff was still bad, to the point that out of nowhere it was dangerous for me and my son.  Just know you can't fix her nor you can change her. Putting energy in that is just going to frustrate you. Focus on yourself, on having strong boundaries, and on your happiness. Only then you can be fully present in the relationship, and only then she might feel compelled to change. But even if she doesn't want to change, then, you will be in a better position to reevaluate the relationship.  Finally, since your relationship is so short, and you are already so deep in chaos, know that stuff will get worse before it gets better. You won't see changes in her behavior in years if ever. So make sure you have strong boundaries, you don't want to let her control the relationship more than she is, as she will create chaos that will hurt you more."
BPDlovedones,390kcl,LLeoj,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:44:50 2015 UTC,"If she doesn't believe in treatment, there's not much you can do. You've only been with her for three months, I'd recommend cutting bait rather than getting more attached to someone who is clearly ill but doing nothing to treat it."
BPDlovedones,390kcl,cookieredittor,5,Tue Jun 9 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"The problem was that you tried to use rational logic to address her emotional chaos. Big mistake. Instead, validate emotions, ignore the rest. Only when calm can you bring up the concrete issue.  This is very very difficult to do. I can't do it all the time. But it is the only way."
BPDlovedones,390kcl,dinosaurs_r_awesome,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:23:35 2015 UTC,"The one good thing about being in a divorce process, is that I don't have to validate her emotions anymore. It was exhausting.  Before: ""I understand you're feeling angry. I'd feel angry, too, if I though you were trying to <do x>. But that's not what's happening. I'm actually <doing y>, <citing evidence here>.""  Now: ""No.""  Much better."
BPDlovedones,390kcl,cookieredittor,4,Tue Jun 9 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"I still have to do the validation stuff, but i do it MUCH less because I don't care so much anymore. Once we reach an agreement about time with son, i'll change my behavior as well. I can't remember how was life without someone so unreasonable in it."
BPDlovedones,390kcl,1978_anon_guy,2,Tue Jun 9 13:31:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I used to leave the residence I shared with my now-ex while we were married all the time. She'd have one of her tantrums and start accusing me and I'd leave. I don't miss those days at all. You're doing good. This is part of setting boundaries. Don't give her any power over you. Do not cave in to her demands. Do not engage her when she accuses you. Do not react to something outrageous that she does to try and push your buttons. Don't hurt the bird. Leave. Don't be around to deal with her manipulations. You've got more important things to do than play into her games. It's all BS."
BPDlovedones,38xx0s,ButterflyToenail,2,Sun Jun 7 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"Don't follow any of your mother in law's advice. Your husband has been like this all his life, and he most likely has BPD either because of his mother or father, but it's usually the mom.  I would start looking for another place to stay. Do you have money of your own or any way to save some? This is not going to get any better, until your husband starts receiving therapy for his BPD , and even then it can take months to years. His BPD behaviors can also put your kids at risk for getting them, too, as well as physical and emotional harm. It wouldn't hurt for them to start seeing a therapist.   Do not allow him to lose it in front of you anymore. Tell him that when he's calm. Say that you understand that he's upset, but that when he gets like that you are leaving the room/house etc. and taking the kids until he calms down. Follow through on it if it happens.   Seek a therapist that specializes in BPD and have him/her help you figure out things to say. You will not be able to change him, but you can learn how to stop him from taking advantage of you and manipulating you."
BPDlovedones,38xx0s,Cranberry_Lips,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:31:13 2015 UTC,"My MIL is pretty much in denial. It doesn't seem to phase her that he almost hit me. I won't be talking to her about him anymore.  I handle all of the money so no issues there. I've talked to my oldest about his dad's behavior and how I would like him to get some therapy, too. My youngest is five and I'm not sure if he would get as much benefit at his age but I will talk to his doctor to learn more.  I have a really hard time with the gaslighting. I'm questioning everything that happened today and whether I'm even sane. Maybe I should write more stuff down so I don't allow myself to be confused."
BPDlovedones,38xx0s,Cranberry_Lips,5,Mon Jun 8 02:05:53 2015 UTC,"Speaking from personal experience, people with BPD have this amazing superpower of getting others to believe that they're the problem, when in fact, it's them. No matter how logical of a person you think you are, he will convince you sooner or later.   You are sane. You are not to blame for his rages. You are not to blame for him not getting a job. He will mirror his behaviors unto you. If he says you're hurting him, is because he's hurting you. He will never admit it and he will never recognize the incredible hurt and pain he's causing his family."

It's hard to accept this right now but I'm trying. When I told him that I don't feel like I can get emotional support from him because he turns it around and makes it about him, he tells me he can't handle listening to me because he loves me so much he gets too upset. When I told him that I felt this was a pretty big rejection I was told that he used to do this with his mom, too, and that I could talk to her about how she used to handle it. Seriously, WTF?????

I went from being a happy and cheerful person to thinking of the best ways I can kill myself every night.

BPDlovedones,38v78y,totally_jawsome,3,Sun Jun 7 02:45:06 2015 UTC,"I wish there was something you could do to help.  If you read through some old posts in this sub, you'll see there are many of us with BPD's in our lives who try and try to help. The truth is there is nothing that can be done except manage how YOU feel. It's ok to feel sad about what your friend is doing. But it's not ok to become involved in the drama.  Ultimately, you will just be used and abused.  There is help for your friend,  but it will come from professionals, and only when your friend wants it. You did the right thing by stating your boundaries.  Just be consistent.  This is truly the best way to help your friend.  Your friend must learn from suffering the consequences of her actions.  It may sound cruel to you right now, but assisting someone who is in her position just keeps her from getting well."

She's being put between a rock and a hard place. And if you ever wind up divorcing, she's probably going to take his side (correct me if I'm wrong). She's likely not the best person to vent to.   You might be having a difficult time convincing those around you that you're not making shit up but god knows you're not alone here. I can imagine it must feel lonely to have your sanity questioned. I'm sorry you're going through this right now. Perhaps he feels the same way but I think the evidence points one direction. Unless your baby is lurking around the house at night when you're not looking... Give me a break.   It sounds to me like you're not done discussing this in CT. And if the therapist refuses to believe you, he should provide you with some instruction on how to move beyond this matter."
BPDlovedones,38tzje,ButterflyToenail,0,Sat Jun 6 22:25:40 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for your reply, and your empathy.     Probably best not to involve his mother    Yeah you're right. What I left out in my main post is why I bought it up. I, through suggestion from my therapist, believe my husband also has somatisation disorder where his stress is manifested physically. He has had a number of episodes in the last month of serious bouts of vomiting. He had tried to blame it on notriptyline withdrawals (despite not reducing his dose). The vomiting coincides with incidents of stress. His mother has been worried about him and I approached it from the perspective that I'm concerned for his stress levels and that's why I think it's happening. She just kept repeating ""he needs to get off the meds"". She's clearly not the person to be speaking with, but I was hoping to get her understanding that her son is very stressed and I think we are getting close to breaking point again.   The therapists instruction was to brainstorm ways we can sort things like have a filing system. My husband's lack of identity results in not being able to possess an opinion either, so whatever I suggest he will support, and then because it wasn't his idea when it doesn't work it'll be my fault. It's hard having a husband without an opinion on matters."
BPDlovedones,38tzje,cookieredittor,2,Sun Jun 7 00:36:13 2015 UTC,My therapist suggested I do the same thing. My MIL has now decided that the therapist is the devil. She thinks that getting everyone together tonight to have spaghetti is going to solve everything.  I wish I had advice but I can at least assure you that you're not alone. I'm sending virtual hugs your way!
BPDlovedones,38tzje,mrsmanicotti,0,Sun Jun 7 21:23:57 2015 UTC,Haha the logic in that. Send some magical spaghetti my way! And thanks :)
BPDlovedones,38tzje,mrsmanicotti,5,Mon Jun 8 06:13:04 2015 UTC,"I found that so many fights with my wife are about reality. Reality for people with BPD changes depending on their emotions. Trying to get ANY resolution about that is a waste of time and pointless. All i've been able to do is just have strong consequences and protect myself assuming she will do crazy stuff and then deny it. Trying to get them to admit to reality is just a waste of energy. Couples Therapy is TERRIBLE for this, as the therapist can't choose the reality of one over the other (as it is taking sides), so all they can do is do nothing, which is incredibly frustrating.  I""m getting separated BECAUSE when wife went totally nuts I started to record her. This was first to protect myself from her false allegations, but second, to get some evidence of the crazy stuff she does. This changed EVERYTHING in our relationship. She hates my guts now. She sometimes admits it is because i recorded her, and said she would hurt me in the divorce for that, but now pretends she never said those things and that isn't an issue.  We live in a country where 50/50 custody is default, and on technically, 50/50 time with the kid is in principle reasonable. However, in practice, the court sides with the mother almost always, and ends up giving the father one weekend out of two, and that is all. My wife is using this for leverage during separation.   What i can recommend is you talk to a lawyer right now. Preferable one with experience with BPD, high conflict divorce, or mental health patients. Also, read the book ""Splitting"" by Eddy and Kreger. It is a tough read, but it will help you a lot in the long run to protect your child."
BPDlovedones,38tzje,mrsmanicotti,3,Mon Jun 8 07:31:43 2015 UTC,"Did you mention somewhere your Husband is also taking Seroquel in addition to Notripytline? That sounds like a zombie like combination. I find it disturbing that Seroquel (an anti psychotic) has become widely prescribed for depression. Here is an article: http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/health/a-call-for-caution-in-the-use-of-antipsychotic-drugs.html?referrer=&_r=0 I understand you feel certain that your Husband's behavior has more to do with BPD and Somatization,  however I wouldn't completely discount the side effects of the meds. There is some research that I read about this month that you may want to follow: http://www.m.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20150605/gut-bacteria-depression-anxiety"
BPDlovedones,38tzje,cookieredittor,0,Sun Jun 7 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"Hi mrsmanicotti! They were interesting articles, thanks. The NY Times article about the anti psychotics was new to me. To my understanding, my husband is using it as a mood stabilizer rather than antidepressant, he says it's helped him feel the most stable in years. He is wanting to get off the nortrip, and his psychiatrist is researching another drug that will help him do that.  Drugs definitely have side effects, but I'm not sure how much the weekly vomiting and nausea has to do with it. As with most things in life, it's not very straightforward.   The article about the gut brain axis is interesting. I read one the other day about gut bacteria and obesity too. My husband has IBD as well, and I've tried introducing fermented foods, low fodmap diets etc etc to see if it had any positive effect. In the end nothing sticks, he doesn't like being ""helped"" to choose what to eat even if I explain the great health benefits. Linseed / flax oil (being a high source of omega 3s) was another one I read good things about for mental health, he was adding it to a protein shake in the mornings but stopped adding it. I do think it's all connected, it'll be interesting to see what happens in healthcare in the next few decades."
BPDlovedones,38tzje,silent-shade,2,Sun Jun 7 02:47:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds frustrating!  I understand what it's like to listen to somebody complain, yet not try to change.  My SO sabotages himself by not sticking to a plan and then complains about his circumstances when the outcome was predicted.  I stopped assisting him and I feel much better,  he's the same whether I try to help him or not. You have it much tougher because you have a young child in the family and you need to manage consequences for your child's sake."

But she's friends with some of the same people on Facebook that I am, and before she forgets about me the slur campaign is likely to be devastating.    I think she is probably a talented manipulator, and she'll spin a tale that will put them firmly in her camp.  Recently she has greatly enjoyed cutting and pasting screen caps of other people's texts to her where someone might have mentioned me in a negative light - an obvious manipulation tactic.  Sometimes there's no context to the cap; I find myself wondering if she didn't lead the person talking about me into saying these negative things for the sole purpose of using it to isolate me.  Or if some of them are not just outright fabrications."
BPDlovedones,38r8co,LLeoj,2,Sun Jun 7 02:27:51 2015 UTC,"Are these people better friends with you, or with her? I'd rather just explain the situation and cut contact with her rather than continuing something this toxic for fear of blackmail. BPDs in general are great manipulators so be ready for it, but I think if you get out in front of it you could be ok."
BPDlovedones,38r8co,altyalty_alt,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:30:42 2015 UTC,"You may be right.  I find it somewhat ironic that, during the period where she seemed more stable, I was the one who tried to engage with her about the emotional issues she was having, while her other friends were too wrapped up in their own lives.    I don't know if I can evaluate whether these other mutual friends are necessarily ""better"" friends with me or her, but many of them are also women.    I can attempt to explain the situation and get ahead of it, but...I don't wish to be sexist, but sometimes when a woman tells a story where she is the victim of an ""asshole"" who she feels hurt her emotionally, to other women who may also have been burned in the past, it can be extremely difficult to get the parties involved to see the other side of the story even if the particulars of her side are partly or entirely fabricated.  However, perhaps if the other parties are this way, they're not worth having as ""friends"" either.  I guess with this disorder, no good deed goes unpunished."

BPDlovedones,38hrch,Shanguerrilla,9,Thu Jun 4 20:13:56 2015 UTC,"I forgot to say one of the tactics I've been using to keep it cool is to use Medium Chill. Essentially, is a way to interact with high-conflict people by being unemotional and assertive. The key is to detach emotionally completely, and the others can't manipulate you. They push hard at the beginning, but when they accept they can't control you, they eventually get bored and give up.  Reviewing it, I decided to highlight some of the things I'm doing:   do not share your thought process on how you arrived at your decision. (I just state what i want, and say i'm open to negotiation, but don't justify why i want it). When others try to draw you into their drama and chaos you are a bored and dull listener. You are there, just not present or terribly involved. Never show anger or compassionate involvement; paying attention but not too much attention. Don't offer any advice or opinions of your own. Don't try to solve their problems. You are simply not involved.  When others lash out, show no anger. When others are nice, don't reciprocate. Be distant and flat in both cases.  Maintain a flat, calm and unemotional tone. Choose to emotionally and mentally disengage. Become uninteresting and boring.   She has been trying to start fights, i keep medium chill, and we talk in circles, me cool, she angry and she leaves saying I don't care about her feelings and leaves me alone for a while.  Some of my favorite canned phrases that I'm using a lot:   We'll see. Let me think about that. It's already taken care of. I understand what you are saying. (without agreeing to what she is saying!) I hear you. (without agreeing or disagreeing) I'm not understanding you. Let's think about it and maybe we should discuss later in a more concrete way. (and usually she never brings it up again) (When she accuses me of not caring) We agree that this way of communicating isn't helping us connect. Let's try again later from a different angle."
BPDlovedones,38hrch,red_reader,4,Thu Jun 4 12:20:02 2015 UTC,"This is such a great tactic. I'm extremely glad you tried to make things work, and I'm also glad you've prepared yourself for the craziness that is about to happen. This truly feels like the inevitable in BPDSO marriages. I wish for you future peace and calm. Seeing your son 50% of a week is still excellent and that time spent with him without her will be best for him growing up with a BPD mom. When he's older remind him he can share his frustrations about his mom with you, but don't try to sway him in any direction. He'll need to arrive at conclusions on his own. His mom will be trying to poison him against you as he gets older. If you can be the amazing role model to your son as you appear to be, I'm confident he will be stable emotionally despite his drawback of a BPD mom.   Hugs, my friend!"
BPDlovedones,38hrch,red_reader,2,Thu Jun 4 16:00:45 2015 UTC,"Let's hope i get enough time with him. The law here says that in principle, it is 50%. In practice, there are gender biases in court. Right now, wife is being very ""generous"" by ""offering"" me ~14% of the time, or if i'm really nice, maybe even 28% of the time, but only if it matches the days of her yoga classes, and if i agree to her terms of leaving the apartment soon."

She can stay in the apartment, we can split the goods, whatever. i don't care. All i care is son spends half his time with me, or more.   Wife knows this, and she is using this against me. Her offer is that she assumes she has full control of son, and she will let me see him a bit as a ""gracious"" act on her part. When she told me she will make me suffer, this is what she meant.  I have an amazing relationship with son. Lately, he is scared of her, because of so much yelling and insanity she does. She blames me for it.

I really relate to this.  I wish my wife would actually play with our son, read to him, brush his teeth... do SOMETHING other than look at her phone or do other things and just yell at him or coddle him when he finally loses it screaming.  MAN it freaking pisses me off.  He's only 1 now.  He love me and I do spend more floor time, like time only spent on and with him, but she's the stay at home mom.  He's still so young that when she's around he often screams for her and doesn't want me to feed or play with him.  It reminds me of how she is with me.  I see her 'making' him earn her attention and affection, but only when it fits a time she is willing to accommodate it.  On the point of the thread though, I DO think you are being MORE THAN reasonable."
BPDlovedones,38hrch,dinosaurs_r_awesome,2,Fri Jun 5 03:30:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Wife first raged about me playing too much with son. I didn't move nor change anything. So at least now she is buying him tons of toys, which is better for everyone."
BPDlovedones,38hrch,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:56:50 2015 UTC,"I of course understand your perspective of wanting 50% of your son's time and certainly given his Mother's disorder that seems reasonable.  But viewing the situation from what the reality would entail of switching residencies 50% of the time could present a lot of stress and greater instability to a child. Are you imagining your son spending 3 or 4 days at one residence,  than the other, then back and so on? Having put my own child through a divorce,  I believe stability, security, routine, of surroundings is crucial during the frightening emotional upheaval the child is going through. What me and my ex did was live in very close proximity.  Our child lived with me, but met his Dad for homework and dinner after school a couple of days during the week and slept over every other weekend. We also were on very good terms as parents. I hope that will be the case for you in the future.  I have every reason to believe you would make the better custodial parent, but if that doesn't come to be, you might need to re access how much back and forth is healthy for your child. I do wish the very best for you and your child."
BPDlovedones,38hrch,Shanguerrilla,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:10:41 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying.

I get it. This is not fair, but i accept such biases are out of my control.  Legally, i'm doing much as  i can. I also live in a country where 50% stuff is not rare (not common either), but both parents must agree to it. Also, her current proposal for me to see him is rather weird, essentially, me seeing him very infrequently on the nights it is convenient for her. It is a LOT of back and forth between places, but still, not enough time of him and i together.  I'll do all i can to spend as much time with him as possible, in all possible ways, including those you recommend. All i want is as much time with my son as possible.  Btw, the idea of requesting 50% was suggested to me independently by our Couples Therapist, my lawyers, and even the office of domestic abuse that has been coaching me through all this."

I have this unwavering belief that while people like your wife may never understand just how hurtful they are, people like you will always be rewarded and at peace in the end.

She went around in circles saying that i have a great relationship with him, but that she grew up in a house where it was like that, and she didn't like it, so she doesn't want to be moving him back and forth all the time. The thing is that the times she has offered i spend with him don't make sense. They are very little time, and sort of scattered all over the place to match her personal activities. It really isn't about moving back and forth, as her plan has plenty of it.    I have this unwavering belief that while people like your wife may never understand just how hurtful they are,    I know and accept that she lives in such a crazy imaginary emotional world that she is so distressed she doesn't have the mental space to understand this. I'm not upset by it anymore, this is her limitation because she is crazy.    people like you will always be rewarded and at peace in the end.    I hope so. I don't believe the world is fair, to be honest. But I do believe that given reality, i'll do all i can to be there for my son.  Thanks for the pat in the back!"
BPDlovedones,38c6nk,miss100pic,6,Wed Jun 3 07:25:39 2015 UTC,"It's funny how similar all our relationships..  I can relate to nearly all that in my own ways.  BPD is exceptionally hard to diagnose.  So far my wife has begun treatment and my therapist (who thought she was BPD) now says she has C-PTSD..  I honestly still feel pretty sure it is BPD, but who knows.  Your boyfriend's therapist truly may not have seen the reality of the symptoms, I know my wife is going to be difficult to 'cure', but the name doesn't matter- what matters are actions and more specifically for us, what WE can change / do.  I remember waiting for my wife to leave.  I remember wanting her to cross my hard lines.  Now that desire is gone, if I want to leave her I would.  Instead I hold this relationship with open hands.  MINDFULNESS is important for us and them.  Now is all we have.  This was fundamental to stopping my anxiety attacks.  So what can you do now?  Boundaries.  You need to take control of your own life.  Boundaries aren't rules our SO's have to follow.  They are simply the things we control.  We control our lives and our actions and our emotions, but we didn't even realize we laid that all down.  We don't just have the ability to control those things, we have the responsibility to.  We do NOT have the responsibility to control ANY of those things for our SO's.  What a burden that is lifted when we get there!  The ""hurt, the guilt, and the emotional agony"" can be gone, in or out of these relationships.  That is true in outcome independence.  At this moment though, what you need to decide is NOT whether or not you love him (because I think you do).  What you need to decide is whether or not you love yourself.  If you love yourself and accept yourself, you need to start taking care of yourself and be a whole person.  I was hollowed out and running on empty.  Next step: what do YOU want?  Do you want to be in a relationship with him?  This isn't asking do you want him to be perfectly healthy, non-BPD.. FIXED and with a picket fence.  I mean right now, how he is, do you want to be in a relationship?  If you don't and if I was you, I would tell my wife that I love her incredibly, but I just cannot do this any more and I'm sorry about that.  Then I would leave.  If I DID want a relationship with my wife, then I would tell my wife I love her, but I just cannot do this anymore and I'm sorry, then I would leave the house for a moment and go get therapy for myself.  That is what I chose, personally.    Here's the thing and I KNOW you hit on it and see it.  You and I are not healthy either.  Our lovers didn't 'make' us this way.  They do not hold such an ability or power.  We let them, we changed ourselves.  Now we need to get healthy.  This is true in or out of these relationships.  It is much harder and ironically quicker and clearer to do so in them though.  It is much easier and less painful and less tested to break that codependence outside these relationships.   I also began having physical anxiety attacks.  I never had before except during an extreme time (for me, not nearly as bad as most victims) of child abuse when younger.  As I worked on my own codependence, as I began to love myself again, accept myself, SELF VALIDATE, filter what I let affect me, replace hurt with anger (controlled) to inform me where I needed to enact and strengthen boundaries... etc etc..  I haven't had a single anxiety attack again in months.  I think around the beginning of the year.  As I've done these things, as I've gained control of my own life and emotions, as I've been faithful to my boundaries and not accepted abuse (this is ALL a PROCESS- not a destination, I'm still working on these things), I can honestly tell you that my wife has improved- but that wasn't my goal.  That is tertiary.  We CANNOT fix our significant others.  We can't even change ourselves for them.  It has to be for you, but you CAN have a better life.  So the question is, what do you want?"
BPDlovedones,38c6nk,Shanguerrilla,4,Thu Jun 4 06:30:59 2015 UTC,"BPD is exceptionally hard to diagnose. So far my wife has begun treatment and my therapist (who thought she was BPD) now says she has C-PTSD..   I think is a great point; my SO also meets the criteria for PTSD and I believe his traumatic upbringing definitely contributes to his emotional instability. Regardless of the label you want to give it, this cluster of symptoms is what it is. The key, as you've stated, is to focus on what YOU can do to make your situation better.   This checklist pretty much encapsulates what WE need to consider at all times:    Nothing Changes without Change Staff Writer  And the first change starts with us. When we say we need to change ourselves, we mean...  We need to make ourselves healthy again.  We need to learn to communicate effectively.  We need to learn to set limits and define our own boundaries..and we learn to enforce them.  We need to learn to walk away from emotional dysregulation  We need to learn to allow the person with BPD their own feelings and lives and we allow the same for us  We need to stop trying to micromanage them, we stop trying to manipulate our lives to avoid unpleasent episodes, we allow them the space and time to regulate their emotions and we do the same for ourselves.  All of these things get us back on the track for emotional well being and also can greatly improve our relationships.  People can only change themselves..."

BPDlovedones,38c6nk,Shanguerrilla,4,Fri Jun 5 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"What about the hurt, guilt and emotional agony that you are currently in, and have been in for years? It is not your responsibility to babysit his emotions- he has a therapist for that. One of the unfortunate traits of BPDs is that they can't self-soothe, so they place the responsibility of self-regulation on everybody else around them. If you leave, somebody else will be to blame for his emotions- maybe even the next day.  I don't know what tips to give you on how to change your view of this relationship, because it will never be balanced; any 'balance' will be an illusion created by your constant self-sacrifice. The idea that you're waiting for an 'excuse' like physical abuse to convince you to leave is really terrible to hear. You can impose boundaries on your boyfriend, like refusing to engage with him if he raises his voice or starts calling you names, and if he disrespects these boundaries then maybe that rule-breaking will be enough of an 'excuse' for you to feel like you deserve to leave."
BPDlovedones,38c6nk,avro_lanc,4,Wed Jun 3 07:50:31 2015 UTC,"Good advice from avro_lanc.  OP,  it seems you have really good insight into this relationship,  but are trying to overcome your own issue with setting boundaries and being assertive.  That is exactly what you should be doing.  Work on overcoming the dysfunctional behavior that you are struggling with and things will follow falling into place. I recommend reading a DBT Work book. While it's often recommended for BPD's,  I found it very helpful in developing my sense of self. With BPD's the important things to keep in mind are: they have the emotions of a 2 year old, they can not integrate or moderate conflicting emotions,  they need consistent boundaries with consequences and they will get worse initially when you enforce them, but then they will improve somewhat.  Also they are utterly exhausting."
BPDlovedones,38c6nk,mrsmanicotti,6,Thu Jun 4 04:57:58 2015 UTC,"You're just waiting for something to happen to justify leaving which, in my understanding, is how BPDs think. If you're thinking it then that should be you're answer.  If you're not fully committed to them, dealing with their issues, setting boundaries, or the relationship, then you shouldn't be there."
BPDlovedones,38c6nk,ijustneedahug,3,Wed Jun 3 14:35:38 2015 UTC,"Wow. What you just described sounds so incredibly similar to my relationship, it's scary to read. I feel like I'm looking in a mirror. I identify with so much of what you've written only I'm 5 years in. It's been a demanding 5 years that have forced me to grow in more ways than I ever would have had I been with any other man.   Here's an abbreviated version of my story (you can read more by scrolling through my post history): at first, we were elated. He moved from the East coast to the Midwest so we could start a life together. The first year we spent long distance and it was magic. When we moved in together, I learned about his long list of mental illnesses and that's when I first experienced the dark side of BPD.   He's been diagnosed with everything under the sun and has been in and out of treatment for a long time. He's been diagnosed w/ BPD by more than one therapist. There are a lot of sad factors contributing to why he is the way he is but just like your SO, I'd say 75% he's a really fantastic human being that complements me well.   His temper has gotten better over the years (thanks in part to therapy) but right now we're moving back to the East coast and the stress has triggered some pretty disruptive mood swings. It's trying. Expect that even after learning all the tools in the world, BPD is kind of like PTSD and recurrences of poor coping mechanisms will occur indefinitely. Which leads us both to question: why stay?   I'm struggling with this question right now. They say being with someone with BPD takes strength, patience, and empathy. All characteristics we both possess. I'm still working on how to be strong. And I'm not perfect, god knows. I'm trying to work on myself but I've learned that's all I can control. We can communicate honestly with each other and that helps. But I've also learned to prepare for the bottom to fall out.   If you really want to break things off, you certainly should listen to your heart. You probably recognize that your relationship will never be perfect. If you're committed to staying, cookieredditor recently posted about ""medium chill"". I've found this method of communication to work well (of course it's easier said than done). I also found this link to be helpful. Generally speaking, http://outofthefog.net/ is an extremely informative website, chock full of definitions and resources for loved ones.   I wish you the very best, please feel free to PM if you ever need someone to talk to."
BPDlovedones,38c6nk,way2manycooks,3,Fri Jun 5 14:12:18 2015 UTC,"I believe it was very good that you have told father about all these things. It was also a good thing that you've posted your story. We do not need to be bleeding or in court to justify needing help and deserve supportive people around.    Also, any outside perspective is a reality check. From where I stand, you appear to be pretty deeply involved in a bubble of dysfunctional views. There is a world outside, where you do not wait for BF to hit you in order to leave. True, I am involved with BP myself and not fully qualified to take this teaching stance. But I remember the times I had with someone quite healthy and believe me, it was different.    There is also this thing about having open-handed approach to relationships that Shanguerrilla wrote about. I believe it is very important. On one hand, it is about not expecting to hold on to another person against his or her will. On the other hand - it is a firm conviction that you will be happy regardless of the relationship. You will be happy in a relationship if it stays alive - you have the ability to achieve it. You will be happy if relationship ends. You will be happy if there were to be no relationships ever again. You will be happy in another relationship that may come along, or that you may create and build yourself. You will be happy no matter what. You have your live in your hands. So you do not need to hold on to the relationship that exists as if there was no other happiness in this world.    I am not sure if it is helping, but I wish you good luck. You are the one living your life. Take care of yourself. Be well."
BPDlovedones,38c6nk,silent-shade,2,Mon Jun 8 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"I don't usually comment with the ""GTFO"" posts, but I'm trying to look at this objectively.   When we fall in love, the quirks or irritations of another person cannot snap us out of it. This is rooted deeply in pathways of the brain for reward and addiction. I'd recommend Helen Fisher's Ted Talk ""The brain in love"" for an excellent short overview of this. Unfortunately, being in love with someone does not mean they are ""right"" for you. Communication styles, commitment styles, living habits, leisurely activities, all of these things are important in relationships. More importantly, if emotional stability and a calm, caring person feels right for you, then do not settle with someone who cannot provide this. If he makes you feel bad about yourself or question the relationship, then he is not right for you. With BPD or any person with the same description you've posted here, they do not just ""change"" and get better. You cannot help him do this. He will most likely be like this forever.   The best advice I have, regarding romantic/committed relationships (which works really well for girlfriends who keep picking bad-for-them guys) is: It's either fuck yes or its a no. If you aren't saying fuck yes, then despite his own character flaws (or possible BPD-like symptoms), you should not be with him."
BPDlovedones,38c6nk,stochasticverse,2,Thu Jun 4 16:17:51 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone, OP here.  Thanks to everyone for replying - each response has been helpful and enlightening. I would have written something sooner, but as you all probably know, it's hard to get much private 'me' time when your in a relationship with a BPD person.  It felt good to get some stuff off my chest, and to hear back from others to let me know that I wasn't going crazy. I've come to understand a few things - boundaries are limits we set for ourselves, based largely on our sense of self and self-respect, and we enforce them with our actions. I have also realised the main thing keeping me in this relationship is guilt. And that I am nervous and stressed all the time, and that I can barely focus on anything because this dysfunctional relationship is always on my mind.  I wish I had something for insightful to post. The days have dragged on - a good day here, another good day there, and episode here, and episode there. If the thing keeping me in this relationship is guilt, and I can recognise that - why can't I act on it? Why can't I get angry at this person: for emotionally manipulating me (I know it's not 'on purpose', and that it's motivated largely by fear, but still), for being mean and nasty to me, for sending me mixed messages, for accusing me of things I haven't done... Why is my reflection of this relationship only a reflection on the last 24 hours or so? If we've had a bad night, I feel ready to leave. If we have a good day, I feel ready to stay.   Aaargh! It's just doing my head in. The only way I can see leaving is taking off on a workday, a note left behind, some clothes packed in a bag - back to my parents house. But I could never be that cruel to someone. I can wait until we have a really big fight, until my blood is boiling, and then just scream it out. That doesn't seem like a great idea either.  You know the funny thing? I never thought I'd be one of those people who clearly need to just get the hell out of their sh!tty, possibly abusive relationship. I used to hear about such people and blow off their stories with a ""Pfft. If they treat you like that, just leave! End of story."" And here I am, in that position, rambling on the internet about how hard it all is... and then everyone is reading this is probably slapping their foreheads and saying: ""Just leave already!"" (even if you are too nice and polite to actually say it!)  Sorry, I am ranting again and making not much sense. Let's face it, most people who have endured a relationship with a BPD person would tell me just to get out while I can, right? The sooner the better. Yeah, I know I sound like I'm trying to talk myself into something. And I probably am.   Reading the various BPD boards, I can't see much hope. I know I love this person, but I know this love is poisoning me, and I know I need to leave. But the thought of it just hurts too much. Especially since the last couple of days has been pretty good, despite his stress at work. I have started keeping a list of reasons why I should leave hidden on my computer, to try to rile me up and keep me motivated to see the relationship in it's true colors. No it's not all bad. But it's bad enough of the time. Can I really convince myself that I deserve a normal, low-stress, happy life? Is this crazy?"
