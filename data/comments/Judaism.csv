I've never been punished for standing up for what I believe in.  It might be more accurate to say ""Reddit has become the same corporate model where racists are punished for standing up for what they believe in.""  Except this isn't really true either, because there are plenty of racists standing up for what they believe in ways that don't break the rules (see: /r/Holocaust), and it's hard to argue people on subs like ""gas the kikes"" were standing up for what they believed in (many of them were just trolls, and for the others, while posting hyperbolic one liners and threats about Jews in an echo chamber is consistent with their beliefs, it's really hard to argue that rises to the level of standing up for them).  So probably the most accurate statement is ""Reddit has become the same corporate model where racists and trolls are punished for holding a permanent public competition to maximize the shock value of statements inciting violence against groups of people.""

Judaism,3e2gco,rgeberer,18,Tue Jul 21 13:12:21 2015 UTC,"I grew up Reform and can tell you that it was (20 years ago) more about the culture and the belief that truth had been found by blending modern notions (physical tikkun olam, egalitarianism, inclusivity) with what remained from the traditional (bar/bat mitzvah, brit milah, holidays.)  Your father was correct though for his time. What I wasn't taught growing up was that Reform did emulate Christianity and wanted to achieve a level of assimilation that moved beyond the shtetl in the early days. Starting in Germany, the idea was that Judaism would never merit to get back a Third Temple and that ""Berlin was the new Jerusalem.""  That's why, to this day, most Reform places of worship are called Temples.   The Reform movement was shocked when Israel was formed because it challenged one for the fundamental pillars of the movement. A massive debate broke out and many Reform Temples refused to recognize Israel. Eventually, the Reform philosophy adapted and all Temples acknowledged and even supported Israel but one of the anchors of their belief became unmoored.   Eventually, the Reform made further breaks including patrilineal descent and fairly wide support for inter-marriage.   The changes that were made initially were a shock to the system but the breaks that have been made over the past twenty years cause some to question: is Reform Judaism the same religion as Conservative/Orthodox Judaism? Where is the line? What are the fundamental tenets such that one should be called a Jew by all and one should not?  To a Reform Jew, which I was, it was shocking to hear Orthodox Jews put down Reform Judaism. As a Reform Jew, I was still subject to anti-Semitism. I was still bar mitzvahed. I still celebrated Passover and the High Holidays. How could Jews turn on other Jews?  To an Orthodox Jew, which I am now, it is shocking to hear Reform Jews disdain for Orthodoxy. You believe in patrilineal descent so now everyone should? You bring in these modern ideas (abandonment of tradition, worship of Mother Earth, etc.) and expect us to go along?   The net result is an unhealthy situation where guys like your father say negative things about other Jews.   It isn't easy but, especially in these nine days, go out of your way to not say a bad word about any Jew no matter how they connect to God."
Judaism,3e2gco,Jasonberg,4,Tue Jul 21 14:14:27 2015 UTC,"Anyone want to comment?   Oh! oh!  First, OP, I would like to read more about your family's observance and your current practice, I suspect you have a much longer story to tell.   the few times a year we went to shul as a family, we went to an Orthodox one.   Genuinely curious as to why. Was there no conservative synagogue near you? Did he prefer the rabbi?  Was it the only shul in walking distance?   My father often made fun of Reform for what he saw its imitation of Christian customs--the choirs, the organ, nobody wearing yarmulkas, etc.    Well, I'm curious as to where your father gets his knowledge of ""Christian customs"" (and that is a very broad span). But, yeah.   Today, I believe, Reform services are much more ""Jewish"".    Here's my experience, for what it's worth.  Around 1990, we self-identified as Conservative but sent our daughter to a day school run by a reform temple. (Long and irrelevant story.) On occasion the students would lead a Friday night service. I would be the only one in a yarmulke.  More recently (2008), in a year of spiritual seeking, I went to various Reform temples. One was in the 1990s stage: an Israeli ""cantor"" with guitar singing ""Yerushalyim shel Zahav"" and services 90% in English.   Another temple was indistinguishable from a conservative/egalitarian service, with kippot and yarmulkes. I learned for a while with their rabbi who was very knowledgeable but the class was more interested in talking about their children and grandchildren than learning Chumash with Rashi, so I moved on.  That rabbi has since retired and comes to my (Orthodox) shul's weekly Talmud class.  I have no idea what to conclude from all of this except the standard disclaimer: Past results do not indicate future returns, your results may vary."
Judaism,3e2gco,artmetz,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:37 2015 UTC,Oh! oh!   Fond memories of my childhood right there!
Judaism,3e2gco,smokesteam,3,Tue Jul 21 14:44:33 2015 UTC,"I want to note something to support this; 150 years ago reform was definitely trying its best to be christian-like and ""fit in"".   Contrast this with today, for example on this sub: one of the few things 99% of jews on the sub can agree on is christianity.  Politically, christianity has become very ""politically incorrect"" in leftist circles. If christianity is viewed as taking a political stance one way, it is critiqued and contrasted, and IMO more likely to push leftist jews to take the opposite stance. Even if I am wrong, it is surely more likely to make leftist jews be far more vocal in their opposition.   I find all of the above curious in light of the origins. It has completely flipped from being the ""cool thing"" to being ""ugghhhh""."
Judaism,3e2gco,realz-slaw,5,Tue Jul 21 14:06:02 2015 UTC,"Early Reform was emulating Christianity in the sense that its roots were focused on taking on the what were the best aspects of the then modern society, including practice and style of religion. It wasn't structuring its worship to be directly Christian so much as trying to make Jewish worship more enlightened, which of course was something determined by the protestant brand of Christianity in a time when all the major enlightened thinkers were similarly and extremely biased in favor of determining the protestant Christian perceptions and styles of worship to be the most logical and enlightened.  Even today, one of the stronger focuses in Reform Judaism today has been an ideological push not to be Christian, even though many of their styles are inevitably influenced by Liberal Christian denominations and their style of religious practice and associated trends. So while being Evangelically Christian isn't cool (the modern incarnation of the way Catholicism was despised in Protestant lands), progressive Christian sects that embody modern culture continue to be, and the things they were doing ten years ago now heavily influence the way modern reform is observed."

That said, the Holocaust is still an area that I don't venture into with humor. And there's still a line between a joke and being anti-Semitic. But I wouldn't find it surprising if a very small number of people make Holocaust jokes (or laugh at them) as a way of coping - including non-Jews. I don't think it's far enough removed for widespread acceptance of the jokes, though, nor would I want to hear the joke.   ETA: I thought your comment on it was completely appropriate and the OP's response was unnecessarily rude (although it's Reddit so I guess OP wasn't the worst I've ever seen)."
Judaism,3e2rf7,CageGalaxy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"I really feel like there's a difference between coping and obnoxious humor, but really, a lot of it does depend on who is telling it.

Judaism,3e2rf7,Smgth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"My uncle is Jewish, most of his family was murdered. Whenever someone would ask a family-related question, like: 'so what happened with so-and-so; hey didn't you have an uncle Yossel, does he have kids?' - the answer would be: 'the usual illness'. Kind of a sick answer, but 'it worked'. Within family. Not a joke, of course; but still, the whole cynical approach - it's, like you said, a coping mechanism. And not appropriate for people who didn't go through those experiences.   (I have MS and various other illnesses/problems. Same goes with that: I can joke about it. But don't you - outsider - even dare making the tiniest of puns. Or, even worse, say something along the lines of 'hey, come on, you got to be able to laugh about yourself!'. Oh, I am. Believe me. Self-mockery all the way. But when I think it's called for; not on command.)"

I've also got serious health issues, only I enjoy when people make jokes about me (even strangers), as long as they are clearly jokes and not just mean for the sake of being mean. Before my health issues, my friends and I always tore into each other with jokes and they stopped when the health issues started. That made me feel worse. I needed the jokes to show that life was normal. At the same time, I know that I am representative of only me and if anyone told me to find something funny or otherwise tried to tell me how to feel, they'd get a lot of anger shooting back at them. I'd like to research more about how different people use humor and how lines are drawn. Much like not finding Holocaust humor funny but finding my own mortality and the mortality of loved ones to be funny. How did my brain decide to draw that line?"

As I said elsewhere, I'm not a priori opposed to women Rabbis, but his argument in favour is no less than a deliberate voiding of thought. He's grappling with absolutely nothing.  It should go without saying, but just in case it isn't, I'm coming at this with the assumption that he's an Orthodox Rabbi explaining his decision to give Orthodox smicha to Orthodox women within an Orthodox framework.

They're clearly being abused).  And just in case we still thought it was reasonable to worry about their hypothetical future marriage benefits, we're told they they're (mostly) not making the move for any ideological or religious reasons, they are strictly looking out for themselves, leaving a place where, under other circumstances, they have all the privilege and no desire to help Israel out, it's just their safety net.

Judaism,3e1uad,NovakDani,7,Tue Jul 21 08:41:55 2015 UTC,"To quote myself when this was last posted:    In the ruling, Rabbi Raziel cites a question posed to Rabbi Nachum Rabinowitz, head of Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Ma'aleh Adumim. In that ruling, Rabbi Rabinowitz stated that not embarrassing the reader takes priority over the correctness of the reading, because while the former is Torah law, the latter is Rabbinic Law.   Regarding the ruling of the historic legal authority Rambam reasoning that a mistake nullifies the entire public's obligation to hear the reading, the rabbi replied that it is better that the public not fulfill its obligation than to be guilty of embarrassing another person.    I am continually amazed at how people constantly find things that all of the rishonim and achronim just overlooked.  Like, what was the Rambam thinking?  Didn't he realize correcting somebody is forbidden because it embarrasses him?  And how could the Shulchan Aruch pasken that we should correct people?  Why didn't the Rema argue?  And the Taz and M""A should have said something!  We are fortunate to live in a time with such great talmidei chachomim who can see where everybody else went wrong and the issues overlooked by centuries upon centuries of great scholars!"

But I'd also counter that maybe instead of changing the psak, we should learn from it and have people prepare better, both for the reading and for the emotional impact of learning that you made a mistake.  There's also a middle ground of preventing people from correcting gratuitously where the mistake is inconsequential or in a hurtful way. I've also heard of places (especially for bar mitzvahs) where only one or two people (eg the bar mitzvah teacher) is allowed to make corrections. This would seem to solve all problems.  There are definitely ways to both protect people's feelings and have correct leining or davening.  Edit: I commented before reading the article. Looks like he does suggest having one person do the correcting. Maybe the news is sensationalising his psak.  It also says that he was prompted specifically by secular bar mitzvah boys, which is clearly a special case. Maybe the psak only applies to that, and maybe it only forbids a barrage of communal corrections.  If not, I think it's a strong question why not. The problems are limited and can be solved without big chiddushim, so what is the purpose of a blanket psak?"

Edit: I should add that my sarcasm is for his not approaching it this way.  Even when one believes himself to be correct, a claim that all of the preceding authorities overlooked somethings is simply an extraordinary claim, and, as such, needs to be backed by extraordinary evidence.  Further, this is assuming that one accepts that such a thing is even a permissible stance to take within the realm of psak halacha, something that I am not willing to concede as a general principle.  Indeed, the Pe'as HaShulchan quotes R' Chaim Volozhiner as quoting the Gaon as saying that he wouldn't explain a gemarra in a novel way not found in preceding authorities unless he had at least fifteen clear proofs for his approach.  There is only on word I can think of to describe somebody not on the Gaon's level taking it on himself to do this: chutzpa.  Similarly, to approach it as ""things have changed, and what they said no longer applies"" also requires extraordinary evidence both in that the circumstances really are so markedly different, and that these particular differences justify this particular deviation."

Judaism,3dznma,uppointer,4,Tue Jul 21 12:13:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a Baal Teshuva, so I understand where you're coming from.  My reading hebrew was painfully slow 6 months ago, but it's gotten much better.  Even so, it takes me over two hours to do preliminary morning prayers and Shachris. There are some mornings when I just do my preliminary brachas, The Akedah, Korbanot, Ketoret, Mishnah, Beraita.  Then, if I am running out of time I skip to Ashrei, Yishtabach, The blessings of the Shema, and The Amidah.  My goal is to say it all, but I'm just not there yet."
Judaism,3dznma,ReishLakish,4,Mon Jul 20 23:36:44 2015 UTC,"At the moment, it is a letter-by-letter thing. Best case scenario, I go ""sh-a-bb-a - Oh I know this one!! It's 'shabbat'!"". I'm looking very, very forward to getting more fluent. As in: at the moment, it's basically a pain :-("

Judaism,3dznma,yoelish,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:29 2015 UTC,"I think that would make me very lazy :-) Our siddur has some of the texts transliterated. Kaddish, iirc, and for some reason Adon Olam. I try not to use that, really. I think I'll just have to practice, practice, practice. I've considered starting to learn Modern Hebrew, try and read some children's books. Just to become more acquainted with the letters, the visual part of the language (don't know if there's a word for this in English; what I mean is the way the language and the words present themselves; visually, pictorially) Thanks for the tip though, any advice and idea is very much appreciated!"
Judaism,3dznma,Zel606,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I said I wasn't sure. It can definitely hold back learning.   I think a children's book is a good idea. There might also be religious children's books you can get your hands on, which can do double duty vis a vis learning.

I was determined to put on tefillin and tallit every morning and say The Shema.  Then, I was determined to learn The Amidah.  Just keep going and once you get fairly fluent in one prayer, try to add another.  Don't try to get through it all every day. This site is a great place to ask the question ""what prayer should I add next.""  You may get a few different answers,  it you'll know that adding any one of them is cool."

Judaism,3dznma,ReishLakish,2,Mon Jul 20 23:52:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Question: most of the commenters make a distinction between 'by themselves' and 'in shul'. Is this, like /u/AlmightyMexijew said, because others maybe slow? Or because some things are omitted without a minyan? If the latter, and given the fact that I'll be always davening alone (except for Shabbat): what are the differences between davening alone and davening with a minyan? Could you maybe link me to a website that has the different versions printed out separately?"
Judaism,3dznma,yoelish,2,Tue Jul 21 00:12:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a place where it's printed out separately; the artscroll siddurim with English have instructions but it's stuff like the repetition of the Amidah and Kaddish and the Torah reading on Monday/Thursday etc. they add up I've the course of davening ex: 6 kaddishes at a minute each is 6 minutes - at two minutes each it's 12 minutes.  That adds a good bit of time depending on how fast they're said or if they're said.  Many people here have mentioned they skip other things when davening alone, or they will be able to go faster than the group in Shul for certain parts where you generally stay together.  For example usually everyone says Shema together and then starts the Amida together - at home you can move faster if you want, not waiting on the group."
Judaism,3dznma,ReishLakish,2,Tue Jul 21 00:33:38 2015 UTC,"Davening with a minyan has half a dozen kaddishes or so, repetition of Shmoneh Esreh, krias hatorah... I didn't make a distinction because I take much longer than my minyan. I should've said also that when I daven for the amud it's more like Shachris 60 min mincha 10 min maariv 15 min Your best bet is to get a good siddur - art scroll is a great place to start - where it says ""don say this if you don't have a minyan"" or whatever."

In fact, you asked where to start and I think that beside for Davening in you native tongue, you should set aside time every day to translate as much as you can of the davening in hebrew with a dictionary every day. Praying in hebrew when you understand the words is the best type of davening. Also, it won't take as long as you think to learn it either."

In reality, Jews are a diverse group of people and more research should be done to represent them that way.  Can we stop with the JAPs and the overbearing Jewish mothers? Nothing says ""I hate my heritage"" like trashing the women responsible for your Jewishness in the first place.  Judaism is not Christless Christianity. Despite the insistence of the American far Right, ""Judeo-Christian values"" are not a monolith of Western Enlightenment ethics.  Not all Jews are rich, but unfortunately it seems like all the ones seen in popular media are all at least upper-middle class.

Judaism,3dygwg,benadreti,3,Mon Jul 20 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  It's saying that the mainstream view is to be concerned for Tosafos as well.  According to the Rambam, they're fine because they aren't inventing a new holiday for themselves or making for themselves a Shabbos: they're practicing for conversion, and, according to Rashi, it's also unlikely to be an issue for several reasons including that, for him, the prohibition probably counts a day as being from sunrise to sunrise (not our Shabbos's sunset to sunset), the prohibition is already not absolute in that (he holds) there are cases (ger toshav) in which a gentile should, in fact, keeps Shaboos, and there's a good argument to made that preparing for giyur is anyway not in the prohibition in that it's not ""menucha b'alma"" (e.g., taking a vacation).

You can do all that on sabbath without keeping sabbath. Just be careful to do a melakha. So if you cook or something it's okay.

For some reason I think I remember reading that once the Messiah does come that those who did evil will be judged (and possibly punished?), is that true?   Judaism believes in reward and punishment, however they are fair reward and punishment in proportion to what was done, not some kind of eternal ""oh well you missed your chance"" hell. In addition, unlike Christianity, Judaism doesn't believe you need to be Jewish to avoid punishment. You can be a fantastic non jew.    I've been wanting to read/study more about Judaism and have the book ""Living Judaism: The Complete Guide to Jewish Belief, Tradition, and Practice"" in my Amazon shopping cart. But, after reading that thread about Gentiles and the Sabbath, I'm wondering as a non-Jew if it is even necessary for me to learn about the faith...   I think it's okay to want to learn truth. There's definitely stuff which in your situation could be a bit of a waste of time to learn, but the things that make you feel inspired to be a better human being are probably worthwhile.    ...I have a hunger to learn about who Gd is, and I do feel that if I jump the atheist ship I will have nowhere to go if I don't find some religion to belong to (edit: do want to add that Judaism is the only religion that has made any sense to me, and thus the only religion I find worth delving deeply into). Only following the 10 commandments just doesn't feel like it would be fullfilling enough, that being said I don't have any interest in converting to Judaism. So any advice on what I should do? I want to learn about the faith, if only to help me become a better person, so should I still read and study books about Judaism to help me accomplish that?   What I generally recommend is taking up meditation (for a spiritual recharging) and volunteering (to give you a community, devoted to a worthy cause). Your complaint about a lack of community isn't new. (one day I really hope some motivated noahide will take it up in himself to really build up and strengthen the noahide community. It's a challenge for a lot of people and it would be such a good deed to help with it.)

So is Judaism a religion? For this I'll give you a very Jewish answer: ""yes and no"". Yes because there's no other way in English to describe a formal system of relating to God. No in that its not something one does only at certain times or in certain places. Its something that defines one's entire life in that it exists on the foundation of understanding that we humans are His creation and more specifically that a certain group of humans (Jews) are contractually obligated to live by a certain set of rules He defined. As far as I know, no other religion exists on the idea of a contract with the Divine.  So that said, you seem interested enough in Judaism to read up on it. Whether you decide to become a Jew1 or not, acquiring knowledge of Judaism as a system is a net positive. Actually becoming a Jew is another question. Its not easy and the process involves changes to one's life and self. As others have pointed out here, one does not have to become a Jew to live a good life or respect God. Our system respects the non Jews who do so and understands that God does not expect everyone to live by the full contract of the Torah.  I suggest you learn as much as possible and ask any questions you may have here or feel free to PM me on the topic.   I avoid the word ""convert"" here on purpose. Becoming a Jew isn't as simple as taking on a new religion, its about becoming a member of the Jewish people whose religion happens to be Judaism. See here for some more on this idea."
Judaism,3dygwg,smokesteam,3,Mon Jul 20 23:02:07 2015 UTC,"I avoid the word ""convert"" here on purpose   Off topic, but: In Dutch Judaism, using the word 'converting' with regards to becoming Jewish is borderline illegal. Or, well, very much frowned upon. The Dutch term for giyur is 'coming out'. Because essentially you're not converting to anything, you're just becoming your real self, following your soul's destination, so to speak."

I want to believe in Gd but my strong disbelief in free will makes me question the very idea of Gd and humanity's place/mission in the universe in relation to a supposed Gd.  That being said, I feel a very strong underlying pull towards Judaism, and I've felt it for years and years. So thus I'm very interested in the faith, and want to learn about it. And through my studies I hope to come to some positive conclusion about Gd, as well as find a path that helps me live as and become a better person.   I'm very conflicted about it all, and am not sure where I'll end up with all of this. I will definitely take your advice and learn as much as possible about the Jewish faith, and I will definitely PM you any questions I might have. Thanks for your response!"

Here's the thing about free will: Its the most frightening part of life. Accepting that one has free will (whether you understand it as God given or not) means one has to take responsibility for ones self and ones choices. Thats some scary stuff right there. Isn't it so much easier to say ""the devil made me do it"" or any other external causality?  I think this is also related to why we Jews don't have any instant formula for forgiveness of transactions. Repentance for us really means owning up to what one has done.

Judaism,3dygwg,ReishLakish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"Noahide Jew I don't know if you can be Noahide and an atheist. Pretty sure the first rule is Do Not Deny G-d  This morning I read the thread titled ""Do you think Gentiles have to keep the Sabbath?"" and I got really bummed out that as a non-Jew I'm forbidden to keep the Sabbath. Reading much of Heschel's book on the Sabbath I was always profoundly interested in having such a time/space dedicated to worshiping Gd (as an atheist I know that probably sounds ridiculous, but in the case I do start believing in Gd again I always felt that the Sabbath would be an anchor for my faith, a way for me to get closer to Gd).   You don't believe a G-d made the heavens and earth and all that's in it in 6 days and rested on the 7th and sanctified it. It's an agreement between the Jewish people and G-d. You have issues with belief in G-d. Putting the cart before the horse is counter-intuitive.   If I can't keep the Sabbath, can I still have a day of rest where I read the Tanakh, pray, and worship Gd in my own way?   Start by believing in G-d. Set aside 10 mins a day to pray in your own way and language.    egarding Judaism and hell: I've never been 100% clear on whether Jews believe in hell. For some reason I think I remember reading that once the Messiah does come that those who did evil will be judged (and possibly punished?), is that true?   11 months of purgatory, no eternal hellfire. It has always seemed to me that this purgatory was just the feeling of shame for having detached yourself from your creator through sins while living and then you die and you realize that G-d was all that ever was and will be.   I'm wondering as a non-Jew if it is even necessary for me to learn about the faith...   Keep the 7 mitzvos of Noah bro. Judaism isn't for everyone (in fact it's only for people who have Jewish mothers*) nor does G-d necessarily want you to be one of us. Nor is it prerequisite for acknowledging the Creator, May he Be Blessed, who's Unity is Unique in all the world.   I have a hunger to learn about who Gd is, and I do feel that if I jump the atheist ship I will have nowhere to go if I don't find some religion to belong to (edit: do want to add that Judaism is the only religion that has made any sense to me, and thus the only religion I find worth delving deeply into). Only following the 10 commandments just doesn't feel like it would be fullfilling enough, that being said I don't have any interest in converting to Judaism. So any advice on what I should do? I want to learn about the faith, if only to help me become a better person, so should I still read and study books about Judaism to help me accomplish that?   You don't need all the rituals to develop a relationship with G-d. You aren't obligated to them. You only need the 7 mitzvos to develop a true relationship with G-d. If that's not enough for you, and given your belief's about G-d, maybe religion isn't really what you're seeking."

(This is also true for Torah study.)  Interestingly, ""shaking"" during prayer is not actually unique to Jews, but can be found in other groups, such as the Christian Shakers and Quakers (thus their names). (I have never observed the phenomenon in other groups, so I can't say how similar it is to Jewish shuckling.)  All this being said, there are also sources that are apparently opposed to the practice, and stress the importance of standing still in prayer. (Specifically the amida. I don't believe they would apply this to other parts of the service.) However, it is possible that they are only referring to excessive movement, and would not have a problem with some minimal swaying. (I'm not sure, as I haven't seen the source inside recently.)"

Judaism,3dy3va,y0nm4n,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's a somewhat natural movement for prayer when one's feet are kept together. I don't recall who said it, but someone fairly early on in Chassidut said that someone who moves so much during prayer is like someone who is drowning.   This teaching seems to have been forgotten now."
Judaism,3dy3va,LazerA,4,Mon Jul 20 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"I don't recall who said it, but someone fairly early on in Chassidut said that someone who moves so much during prayer is like someone who is drowning.    I don't recall the exact source at the moment, but you are correct. However, if I understand correctly, that was said in defense of certain chassidic groups that were known for making wild gestures and other unusual and strange motions in prayer. The idea being that these individuals are so desperate to connect to God in prayer that they experience the separation from God as a form of drowning, from which they are desperately striving to escape. (Which is a very intriguing idea, on several levels, though I am not entirely comfortable with the application.)  In any case, I am fairly certain that this statement was not referring to conventional shuckling, which was a near universal mainstream practice."

Judaism,3dy3va,ShamanSTK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:08 2015 UTC,"The earliest two explanations were found in the kuzari. The first was given as popular, but rejected in the same text. That it arises the body's vital heat, something we no longer believe exists in the same way they did. The second reason proposed by the author is that, historically, there was a shortage of books, so a group would gather around large print books and would take turns bending over to look. The children would observe this and imitate it, eventually growing up making the bending movements despite having their own books. Many reasons have been given since, but they are post hoc. The real reason is lost to antiquity, however it only recently became a widespread practice. The halakha at least used to be that one was to remain still during the amidah."

Judaism,3dxhts,TheOneFreeEngineer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:18:56 2015 UTC,"Sociologist are kinda clear on this point.   As much as it would like to be, Sociology isn't really a science and too often operates on models where correlation is dressed up as causation . One problem with lots of studies on this is that they focus only on the correlation they find in developed economies and assumes that proves causation globally.  At least when economists look at questions like that they find ways to control for factors such as you complain of and limit their conclusions only to the groups actually studied. Also they have the decency to call their practice ""the dismal science"".  OTOH, if you disagree with my comment on Islam, please show me where I'm wrong.

Judaism,3dyozl,Elijahquestions,7,Mon Jul 20 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"Satan is basically the same in Judaism, it's just not concretised in a physical being, it's an abstract concept. And it's a bit bigger than that.  Satan is any force which takes a person further from God, which is the same as taking the person further away from his/her best self, and further from life itself. Satan is also the force which recalls our sins to God (in judgement). (These are all different aspects of the same phenomenon. The Talmud states that Satan, Man's inclination to evil, and the angel of death are one and the same).  We don't believe in Satan as a being, and we certainly don't believe in Satan as something with power outside of God's Will. But other than that, it sounds like the same basic concept (though I don't know much about Satan in Islam, so maybe I'm way off)."

Judaism,3dyozl,carrboneous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:41 2015 UTC,The statement I quoted seems to be saying that Yetzer Hara ⊆ Satan  ⊆ Malach Hamavet  ⊆ Yetzer Hara.
Judaism,3dyozl,littlestsquid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably worth an inquiry, since we use the same words close to interchangeably.  For one, the satan is often manifest in material objects/environment- and when we discuss it, we would say, ""The Satan does X and Y.""   But then again, I once heard a speaker point out that our insistence on compartmentalizing the Y'H to an external being is a deliberate misunderstanding. The Y'H is not an external force, it's the part of ourselves that has desire or material fixation. Which would seem to indicate that Y'H is our internal desire (and by extension, the actions and justifications we aim towards those desires) whilst the Satan is an external force that presents temptations or obstacles to allow us opportunity to succumb to our Y'H."
Judaism,3dyozl,Zel606,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:38 2015 UTC,From what I've learned it seems the yetzer hara is your own inclination - and it's the satan's job to put obstacles in your path to tempt your yetzer hara.

Judaism,3dyozl,BrStFr,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"I think the big distinction is between the Jewish idea of the satan, who essentially ""works"" for G0d and who is essential for the existence of free will; on the other hand, the Christian idea is of a Being/Force that is an enemy/opponent/challenger/rebel that works against the Divine plan, motivated by pride, powerlust, etc.   It sounds like the muslim concept is closer to the Jewish one."

Judaism,3dy10n,randomredditor12345,4,Mon Jul 20 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"If you're going to an Orthodox shul, I'm not sure this going to contribute to your understanding of religions outside your own. The entire thing will be in Hebrew, and many sections of it will be basically silent (people saying things quietly to themselves). It's a terrible time to ask people to explain, since they're trying to concentrate (hence having conversations is very rude), so it's very likely you'll be on your own, not really following what is happening.   If you're lucky, maybe the synagogue will have prayer books with translations, so you'd be able to read those. But you wouldn't know where everyone else is up to.   I would go in expecting to be very bored and fidgety after a while.   But a description anyway:  People saying things quietly to themselves. Sometimes they stand up. Sometime they sit down. Then sometimes the cantor will say something out loud and everyone will respond out loud together. A few things might get sung.   At some point they take the Torah scroll out of the Ark and place it down on the center table. Someone reads from it out loud, every so often interrupted by people standing up and more things being said out loud. Then they put the Torah scroll back.   Then some more standing up and sitting down while people say things quietly to themselves interspersed with people saying things out loud. Usually there's a song at the end. Then it's over.   This is all assuming you're going in the morning.     Etiquette tip : during the parts where everyone is standing up and being silent, it's really rude to brush past them. So if you need to leave, either do so beforehand or wait till after. Or maybe just stay close to the door at all times.   Etiquette tip: dunno if this is relevant for you, but it is pretty rude to wear a cross into a synagogue. So if you do regularly wear a cross, you should take it off beforehand.     My understanding is other denominations might have more interesting/participatory services, but I've never been to one so I'm not certain.     Also, are you a guy or a girl?"

I think you'd be welcomed to sit in on a Reform or Conservative service. Reform especially will be in English, and the feel of it will be somewhat familiar to you if you've been to church. A conservative synagogue will have more traditional practices, but still enough English to follow along. I wouldn't recommend going to an orthodox synagogue, since it will be almost completely in Hebrew and it will be very hard to understand what is going on.    If you're very religious and worried about negating Jesus, there may be parts of the service you'd want to not follow along with, since we believe no one has met the requirements for becoming the messiah yet, and the service occasionally reflects that. A conservative synagogue should have enough translations in it to be able to understand what you are saying.     Sending your kids to Hebrew school might be a stretch if you aren't on an active path to actually becoming Jewish yourselves. Hebrew school is about teaching kids Judaism. I'm guessing you wouldn't want them coming home and telling you all the fine points of why you should be keeping kosher. You could almost certainly meet with the rabbi and ask how to give your kids more knowledge about Judaism from a Christian perspective though."

That's silly, and in most cases, there's no concern with kneeling on tile. The Jewish custom was to put down a prayer rug anyway. The real reason western Jews stopped kneeling is because their synagogues had chairs. As someone who does kneel and bow, I can tell you, it is extremely difficult to maneuver yourself correctly with the typical chair/pew layout. The rambam reports that the Jewish custom was ""to sit on your knees"" during prayer, except in the west were the custom was to sit on chairs. In places where it was not the custom to sit in chairs, Jews still kneel in prayer, and bow on the floor. Yemenites and karaites still do so to this day, and no, it's not in imitation of Muslim practice. The bows are different."

Judaism,3dwu4q,ShamanSTK,3,Mon Jul 20 13:57:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but there are several flaws with the line of reasoning. 1) an established Jewish practice cannot be overturned because idolaters do it. Idolators pray sitting down and say hallelujah too, but we still do it. At the time of the temple, idolaters made animal sacrifices. 2) the concerns over doing it improperly were no more prevalent in the west than they are in the east. 3) you don't see any writings contemporary with the abolishment of the practice saying we need to stop because of these concerns, but rather, you see an after the fact justification. 4) it's still done on the high holidays, so if the concern is idolatry, wouldn't you be more stringent then? 5) the rambam gave the reason as something far more mundane and plausible at a time when chairs were only just starting to become a widespread thing."

Judaism,3dwu4q,refavi,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:17 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things Jews don't do because of their association with idolatry.   Is Judaism is malleable, i.e. can consensus amongst the Rabbis overrule the old practices of the forefathers and prophets (where such practices were clear and not in dispute by anyone)?   If by practices you mean customs, in theory, yes, if they're determined to run counter to the demands of the law.  The law itself is not so malleable. Laws given by God can never be overruled, and laws enacted by rabbinical decree can only be overruled by a court that is both wiser and larger in size than the one that enacted it (and from what I've read, in many cases not even then). The actual odds of a rabbinic law that has been accepted by the entire Jewish people ever being overruled is close to zero. Laws that were enacted only within certain sects or local communities are presumably more malleable."

Judaism,3dwu4q,realz-slaw,2,Mon Jul 20 08:09:07 2015 UTC,"during prayer, prophets and their followers would kneel and bow when praying   And they would use god's name, and swear and vow seemingly much more often as well. Many voluntary things that are very serious (such as using god's name, swearing, vowing, and others) have been steadily stayed away from, lest one misuse it. So the analogy the kneeling would be: it is prohibited to kneel in many situations, and it is a very serious sin, and kneeling by prayer (I assume, I don't know) and other times was more voluntary, so avoid it.  Now wrt. prayer, I have heard that (all?) jews did used to bow fully, but it was inexplicably stopped. I've heard of the odd person here or there trying to get people to bow again (mostly modern ""rationalist""/""rambamists""), and I've also heard that some yemenite shuls do it. Perhaps someone else can enlighten us more.   This brings up another question: Is Judaism is malleable, i.e. can consensus amongst the Rabbis overrule the old practices of the forefathers and prophets (where such practices were clear and not in dispute by anyone)?   Well as others mentioned, if it is required by the torah, it is not as malleable. If it is voluntary (i.e a nice thing to do), then it is more malleable (in the sense that it can be prohibited, or discouraged). And then it becomes more malleable as it goes from rabbinical => custom => local custom.  So for example, swearing to the truth of something is prescribed by the torah as something one can do. But normally, taking an oath is voluntary, and therefore the rabbis could (much later) come along and prohibit it, or discourage it."
Judaism,3dwu4q,carrboneous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:27:50 2015 UTC,"and therefore the rabbis could (much later) come along and prohibit it, or discourage it.   The Talmud discusses whether Tanach (in Koheles, IIRC) promotes or discourages the taking of oaths. The way we understand it, it discourages it."
Judaism,3dwu4q,realz-slaw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, it isn't a great example perhaps because the torah itself seems to warn about it."
Judaism,3dwu4q,xiipaoc,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"So, you can think of the Torah as the Constitution, the Talmud as a kind of legislature, and the rabbinate in general as the judiciary.  The analogy isn't perfect, obviously, but it's fairly close.  The role of the rabbis, basically, is to adjudicate cases and interpret the law as given in the Torah and the Talmud, and this interpretation can be narrow or broad.  It is generally locked by precedent, though.  So, for example, there's a law in the Torah that prescribes the death penalty for unruly children.  Well, what does unruly mean?  The rabbis decided on a set of criteria for this law that is so extreme that there will basically never be a child unruly enough to merit execution.  But rabbis can and do change rabbinic law sometimes, and often this results in schisms when some people believe that changing this law is heresy and other people think it's entirely justified.  Judaism is malleable, just not very much so, and if you hammer it too much it will break.  For example, the Conservative movement has reviewed Jewish law and come to the conclusion that women can be rabbis, lead services, read the Torah, perform gay marriages, etc., and that preventing them from doing so violates some of the principles in the Torah.  The Orthodox movements -- nearly all of them -- think that this is completely ridiculous.  The branches of Judaism can basically be summarized by how much they're OK with changing Jewish law.  On the one side you have the Karaites, who reject even the Talmud.  On the other side you have the Humanists, who completely reject the Torah itself.  (While individual Humanists can certainly be Jews if they're born Jewish, many don't consider Humanist Judaism to be Judaism at all.)  There are lots of positions in between, and of course, adherence to original Jewish law isn't the only thing that differentiates movements.  Within the Orthodox movements, though, especially the more right-wing ones, change is glacial and generally unlikely, because there's a lot of precedent out there."
Judaism,3dwu4q,Yemenite,2,Mon Jul 20 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"I still bow and kneel and prostrate when I pray.

Judaism,3dwu4q,farquier,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:04:56 2015 UTC,"On the first point, a lot of laws are based on "" not doing what idol-worshippers do"". But it may be a later development; a small group called the Karaites do kneel although they may have adopted this from Islamic ritual. As for your second point: not really although individual rulings may sometimes be overturned (rarely) and/or revised although not to the point of violating actual biblical ordinances. The Takkanot Rabbenu Gershom are probably the most famous of these; they ban polygamy(permitted biblically) on the grounds that it brings Jews into disrepute  and modified divorce law somewhat.

Judaism,3dvzk0,spring13,3,Mon Jul 20 03:01:11 2015 UTC,"S'chok and laytzanus is not laughter in general, it's making fun of everything and not taking things seriously.  I don't believe the Mesillas Yesharim is saying that one should never laugh, rather that one should be aware that always treating things as a joke and not taking things seriously will lead one down a path of frivolity (as /u/spring13 said).  Similarly, kalos rosh, which is what he quotes from mishna avos, means not taking things seriously.  Here is what Tosafos Yom Tov says on this mishna:   שחוק וקלות ראש כו'. כלומר אבל כובד ראש והיראה הוא סייג לעריות. שכל זאת המשנה מדברת בסייגים. הר""ר יונה. ולא תני הסייג, משום דלא הוה משתמע דמרגילין אלא דמביאין לידי ערוה   Loosely translated:   However a serious mien and fear of heaven are a barrier to illicit relations.  This is related to the rest of the mishna that refers to barriers.  Rabbeinu Yona says it does not explicitly mention a barrier here because had it said that one would have thought that frivolity and jesting caused one to engage in illicit relations instead of just accustoming one.   From this we see that the danger in frivolity is that it breaks down the barriers we have internally.  That little voice that tells us what is proper and what is improper is weakened by making fun of things that are serious."

This type of behavior can be very hard to draw a line around but think of an otherwise of comedian who goes too far.  Or most comedians in general - they are generally not the most savory set of the population - it's like a guilty pleasure.  Like at a roast...  This type of activity, while fun, does not help one come closer to the creator or improve his character and often comes at the expense of the pursuit of loftier activities.

It seems to be saying more than just listening to comedy/levity, engaging with it on a regular basis affects a person's attitude towards the world at large.  The philosophy (if you can call it that) behind comedy is to not take things too seriously, everything has a lighter/less serious side to it. This can harm a person's outlook, allowing them to ignore things. Whether ignoring faults, not taking them seriously enough to fix them, or not taking positive actions, jest reduces the gravity of the situation."

Judaism,3dwfw5,tamaravel,6,Mon Jul 20 02:35:56 2015 UTC,"For those having trouble with the paywall: Some unsuspecting cow could soon become for Judaism more or less what Mary was for Christianity: A messianic mom. Or so Temple Mount devotees fervently hope.  In about a month and a half, the faithful, whose ultimate aim is to build a third Jewish Temple on the Jerusalem’s Temple Mount – where the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque now stand, and which Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary – will be implanting red-cow embryos in the wombs of cows in the south. These surrogate mother cows will be meticulously monitored and cared for until they give birth nine months later. If one of the newborn bovines is a heifer, and is totally red, as those running the project expect, and as long as no more than two black hairs are found on its body, it will be declared the first authentic red heifer since the days of the Second Temple.  After that, the heifer will be slaughtered and burned after reaching the age of two years. Its ashes will be mixed with water and finally, after 2,000 years, believing Jews will be able to purified from the ritual impurities associated with coming into contact with the dead, and will then be free to ascend to all parts of the Temple Mount. At least, that’s what the people at Jerusalem’s Temple Institute believe, and that’s why they’re supporting the project.  This is not the first time that Temple Mount activists have tried to find and raise a truly kosher red heifer. Their reason for doing so is that the lack of red heifer ashes is one of the most serious halakhic obstacles to building the third Temple on the Temple Mount. According to Jewish law, every Jew is currently ritually impure from having been near a dead body or gravesite. This kind of impurity can only be vanquished by water mixed with the ashes of a truly red heifer.  Getting serious  This time around, however, the efforts to raise a red heifer seem more serious, complete with a crowdsourcing campaign that raised over $15,000 in four days, meant to fund an extensive in-vitro fertilization process aimed at producing the long sought bovine.  If the project succeeds, it will allow for thousands of Temple activists to expand their tours on the Temple Mount itself, to go up to the highest platform on the Mount, and come near the Dome of the Rock itself. The process is expected to take some time, as the heifer must be two years old before it can be slaughtered, according to Jewish law. Temple Institute activists devote substantial resources to recreating the ritual activity that took place in the ancient Temples. Their efforts include fabricating ritual objects to exact specifications, preparing clothing for cohanim (priests), and teaching them how to fulfill their duties in the Temple.  A few years ago, Temple Institute researchers found on a farm in Texas a breed of red cows called the Red Angus, which is said to have particularly high-quality meat. A delegation from the Temple Institute flew to Texas and purchased a few frozen Red Angus embryos that met the criteria set by Jewish law. They also found a farm in the south that specializes in raising cows to host the surrogacy process.  The surrogate mothers and their offspring will be given extra special treatment at the farm, and be watched by closed-circuit surveillance to ensure that all halakhic criteria are met, and that no harm comes to them.  If the project is successful, the Temple Institute will possess the first such red heifer in 2,000 years. At the same time, religion scholar Tomer Persico says Jewish law presents a seeming Catch-22: The red heifer must be ritually slaughtered by a cohen who is ritually pure himself – and due to the lack of red heifer ashes, such a cohen does not exist.  But Temple Institute activists say this problem can be circumvented to create the necessary ashes. In a video clip included on the project’s indiegogo page, Rabbi Chaim Richman, head of the institute’s international division, says, “Make no mistake, this project is nothing less than the first stage of the reintroduction of biblical purity into the world, the prerequisite of the building of the holy temple. For 2,000 years we’ve been mourning for the destruction of the holy temple, but the future is in our hands.”"

Judaism,3du4er,y0nm4n,2,Mon Jul 20 04:22:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't say anything about the Rambam. And I assume you mean ""are not"". If you mean ""are"", then disregard the rest of the comment.  But even if I had, the Rambam's formulation of Jewish dogma has been universally accepted and applied for the past seven or eight centuries. Whether it's the be all and end all is academic, because it's the practical halacha according to all opinions.  And even if you do believe for some reason that we should go back 800 years and have that discussion, the Rambam's codification very nearly approximates the universal opinion. There are a handful of relatively minor voices disagreeing on a handful of minor points. Even if you glob them all together and consider only the Shemona Perakim formulation and not the Hilchos Deos codification and the Talmudic context on which it's based, and you grant the opponents equal authority to Rambam and everyone who agrees, you still only have a few minor tweaks, not a substantial refutation.  And even if you believe that's it's warranted to take the most strident (pre-19th century) position on the most general critiques of the concept of a Jewish dogma, I can grant you it, accept (as all, including Rambam himself, already do) that every line and word of Torah, every halacha takana of Chazal, is itself an ikkar, and we can't limit the ikkarim to a list of dogmas, and I will still say that Rabbi Farber's words, in that infamous article, and even more so in hus publications since then, constitutes a denial or violation of several ikkarim. And even if we take the opposite tack, aggregate Rambam's list and sharpen the dogmatic demands as much as possible, to something like ""God gave us the Torah and we are obligated to obey it"", I'll still say that Rabbi Farber violates that.  If he had claimed that there were a handful of narrative psukim that had been interpolated after Moshe, or if he had said that Chazal used some interpretive license, or that some of the Torah is not intended as literal history, or employs exaggeration, or that God can manifest in physical form, then there might be something to discuss, some room to equivocate as to whether it was heresy or just perceived as such.  But what he actually says (on a regular basis now) is unambiguously a contradiction of ikkarim, not only in terms of practical contemporary halacha, not only according to the Rambam, but according to any sensible conception of ikkarim."

Given the developments of modern study, I find it impossible to accept the traditional narrative. I won't accept that it takes inauthenticity to not be a heretic."

This makes the issue very clear. I won't be taking his graduates seriously, not because there are women among them, and not because they evince little concern for Torah or tradition themselves, but because they were taught by this man, who — by his own description — is himself more committed to being cool and feeling good about himself than obeying the Torah.  I'm not a Torah scholar, and I'm not completely closed to the possibility to women Rabbis, but with defenses like this, who needs critiques, honestly? These guys are doing more to keep the practice to the fringes than their opponents.

He sidesteps the issue and says, paraphrasing, ""Well, it doesn't really apply because it's an appeal to authority.""  And here's an actual sentence:   Taken to the extreme, this approach invalidates healthy religious and moral instincts in favor of what is perceived to be the “pure” Halakha.   But don't you think that R' Yoshe Ber knew this?  I've read several of his writings and know several of his disciples.  I think he meant this statement as it reads on it's face.  To impugn that following the exact opposite of what he wrote is frankly crazy.   By employing the gematria equivalent between adam and YHVH, the Shelah has blurred the distinction between the human and the Divine and undermines the basic assumption which Rabbi Soloveitchik articulated above.   Yeah, no.  The Shelah is saying that imitatio Dei, aka because He is merciful and forgiving, so too I will be merciful and forgiving is how man connects to God and fully becomes human."

Judaism,3du4er,whaturpriceforflight,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:50:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm...I'd also like to think female rabbi & intermarried rabbi are really, really, qualitatively different. Jews do have to struggle with some ideas that don't jibe with the liberal order even as they good citizens wish liberalism to continue to flourish. The concept of being the Chosen People is not liberal. Wishing to remain apart, especially on an ethnic basis is not liberal.   A movement can say they don't believe Jews are divinely charged with a mission. But for a rabbi to be intermarried, symbolically endorses intermarriage and assimilation. So in my gut I feel they are different. But I'm not sure it actually is that way.  To some Reconstructionists the concept of an intermarried rabbi is not in the ""laughed out of town"" territory. To most Orthodox people the idea of a female rabbi is in or close to ""laughed out of town"" territory. The idea of a Judaism without binding halakha and a divinely inspired Torah is also supposed to be beyond the pale. From a religious perspective the creation of the Reform movement is a monumental change. Though because of how Jewish peoplehood works, varying levels of observance, great cultural ties and the halakhic idea that Jewishness is hereditary (even apostates are still Jews), this didn't feel like a catastrophic rupture."

All of this is, of course, quite incidental to becoming a rabbi. While it is true that a rabbi must be intimately familiar with texts which women are not permitted to learn, the real issue is that the basis of rabanus is dayanus, and a prerequisite for dayanus is edus, and women cannot be edim - u/MareiMakomos or whoever can correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the nature of kosher edus is actually doraisa."

Technically this doesn't make them very kosher.  However, I'm perplexed as to why rennet from an animal that's been kosherly shechted suddenly makes the cheese kosher, which is how kosher hard cheeses used to be produced before they started using vegetarian and bacteria-produced rennets.   As someone who does not keep kosher myself, I find that many people consider cheese without a hechsher to be OK as long as it isn't served on their own tableware, and as long as they aren't seen eating it by their more frum peers."

(This is not often labelled and but sometimes you can find lists online)  You might have some luck in supermarkets, where kosher cheese might be distributed.

Especially because its unlikely a waiter is going to be able to go and look at ingredient label and for that label to also have its sources listed, assuming you've conquered language barriers.   However, Ricotta cheese is not made with rennet, animal or microbial.   EDIT: forgot to add, that you could research brands that make common pasta/pizza cheeses. Ex.

It might be worthwhile to talk with close friends or something about it, as it could be confusing, but if a person wants to follow halacha, they know what choices they have to make.

Judaism,3do4gb,DontTickleMyPickle,5,Fri Jul 17 21:23:07 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend starting with the books of the Tanach. If you search that, you should probably be able to find English translations online. I want to stress the importance of making sure a translation done by a Jewish site/source though, because some Christians sources try to translate things differently or even add in phrases to make it seem like Jesus was ""foreshadowed"" in earlier text.   As for the oral Torah/ The Talmud I honestly wouldn't recommend reading the entire thing, as the very point of it is that its a collection of legalistic arguments over religious traditions. So most of it is fairly dry, sometimes interesting and sometimes boring if only because of the sheer bulk of it.   But at the same time, a few of those arguments, and stories shared in the text to make points, are very poignant and illustrate a lot about what Judaism was and what those rabbis were trying to make it become. And it makes you appreciate the scope of what was trying to be collected, as the Talmud records minority and majority opinions and tries to ensure that most people's voices are heard.  Chabad.org has a particularly good overview of the talmud and a collection of some of the best stories found in it, as well as ""pirkei avot"" which is a sort of collection of sayings of certain famous rabbis at the time. (If you read anything, then read pirkei avot)  If you would like to read parts of the actual Talmud or the entire thing, this website has English translations of it which are free to read.  I don't quite remember the placement of the sections I enjoyed the most, but I can tell you that portions on 'death and mourning' and 'returning lost objects' are particularly good.   It's also important to remember that Judaism has expands as a religion since the time of the Talmud, so a variety of rabbis, such as Maimonides, Rashi, etc, have written down a variety of other interpretations and stories as well, expanding and changing certain viewpoints. So if you're looking into this farther, those might be your next point of inquiry."

Like I said I would look into books that give an overview of Judaism - I've never read ""Jewish Literacy"" but I've heard it recommended for this type of situation. Reading all of Tanakh will take you a few months and might not give you much to take away - since you would need someone more knowledgeable to make sense of it.  You aren't anywhere close to being ready to even touch the Talmud - that would weigh you down and confuse you.    What is the little background you do have?

I know the basic history of Judaism. The 12 tribes, the tribulations, the holidays and their meanings, the rules of kosher (including preparation and so on), Basic stories from the Torah and the Talmud. My mother had me circumcised after I was born and my grandmother had me granted a Jewish name by their Rabbi ( I was a toddler and wasn't present at the time).   I'm just basically in a weird limbo zone. I met with a rabbi through a Jewish organization at my college and explained my situation. He told me the Synagog is always open. I met with him once outside of the Synagog and he gave me a basic overview of some ideas in Judaism and gave me a book on faith to read ( The Garden of Emuna)  I just know I'm way behind in a lot of things and am looking for foundational readings to catch me up."

At the same time this is not strictly true:   Reminding a Jew about their life prior to being observant or converting is a violation of Jewish law, so asking every African-American Jew “how they came to Judaism” is totally inappropriate.   To the best of my knowledge it's only assur if you're doing it to embarrass someone.  Doing it for other reasons may be rude and tactless but it's not a violation."
Judaism,3dkxz5,rebthor,3,Fri Jul 17 13:39:58 2015 UTC,"I don't attend the orthodox shule very much in my city because of a falling out, but I have known some incidents/acknowledged some things.  The main thing I remember in the Orthodox was that sometimes the black congregants were sometimes strangers. I remember a visiting Litvak Rabbi teaching some of the children about the many different Jews in the world after they were curious seeing a black man in the synagogue for the first time. But yes, definitely in synagogues of different congregations there are racism elements, I remember reading about some ultra orthodox schools that were dismissive towards sephardi culture and hebrew. The main issue is really just people wondering if someone of colour is actually Jewish - which tends to get cleared up quickly and people get over it.  The only actual incident that I can think of was at a reform congregation that my grandparents went to (after the falling out) in a city close to ours, I was friends with a black South African family, and this synagogue was incredibly multi-racial with members of all stripes with families from Africa, Latin America, Israel and China. The incident which happened was because of a very... eccentric congregant with an especially unique view of the world, and an incredibly literal view of Torah, essentially he went into a particularly racist lecture about race using the types of examples that would be seen in an 1890s discussion of eugenics. Luckily the Rabbi was around to be the spiritual leader necessary to stop this. But I don't like that guy, especially since he said that I was okay with the anti-Jewish purges of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia because I supported an increase to the minimum wage.  The point that I'm trying to make is, yes, racism does happen sometimes, but generally we're aware of it. Sometimes we need to make improvements but I'm certain it will get better. Some communities which had strong ties to the African American community, like in New York, invoking the closeness that Jews had with the civil rights movement, have dwindled to the point where those ties mixed with some racial/economic tensions have led to problems - but even with some outreach, even those tensions can be removed."

Judaism,3dkxz5,Jasonberg,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:10:41 2015 UTC,We have a few black Orthodox Jews in our community and I've never seen or heard anyone make a single disparaging comment.   Not even an acknowledgement that they are black.
Judaism,3dkxz5,yodatsracist,28,Fri Jul 17 03:49:25 2015 UTC,"I think there's a pretty big difference between ""they have no problems"" and ""I haven't seen or heard of any problems"".  Through a Chabad I went to, I knew a convert who was, by all measures, ""more Jewish"" than I am.  She studied, she was tzniusdik, she spent a lot of her free time listening to shiurim.  I never witnessed anyone in the congregation or community say anything disparaging to her.  She was very close with the rabbi and rebbetzin.  But, two things I'll point out.  As I got to know her, we talked more about it.  It's annoying everytime you go to a new shul, every time a new person comes to your shul, they wonder, ""Is this person a member of the community, or are they a guest or what?""  There's not that presumption with anyone else.  It's tons of little things like that.  You can call them micro aggressions (she never did), or you could call it just annoying or exhausting, but like almost every time she met a new person in a Jewish context, she'd almost like have to explain and justify herself to a stranger.  You know?  It was a lot of little annoying things like that.  But it was also big things.  She was trying to get married through Chabad shadchanim and it just wasn't working.  She was only getting the worst matches (47 year old divorcees in different countries, stuff like that).  And when she'd be like ""Uhh, I'm not sure this particular shidduch is right for me,"" they'd say things like, ""Look, you're holding out for an Obama, you're not going to find a Mr. Obama, this is a good match for you.""  And I tried to help her out with my Modern Orthodox friends, but getting her set up on dates was just hard.  Last I heard, she was off the derech and in the last conversation we had about it, a big part of it was not being able to find a spouse.  It just made her feel like she didn't belong in the community.  So, while I don't expect there to be really ""disparaging comments"", or people to comment that they are black, I don't think that's a good measure of how well we're doing.  We're not insulting them, great.  You know?  A better stand would be how we treat them, do we treat them with full ahavas yisroel?  Do we take care of them from the first moment as we would anyone else in klal yisroel?  And I know I don't always.  I'll be the first to say it.  When I see a Jew who I can't immediately put into a box, I try to think about ""what their deal is.""  In my head I immediately notice and emphasize the difference, rather than recognize their pintele yid.  And I shouldn't.  If they're part of the community, I should just treat them.  I'm not saying how you or anyone in your community treats them, I'm just saying how I've seen people get treat and how I know I have (unfortunately) treated others.  We don't immediately ask converts their conversion stories, we don't immediately treat others different, but I think many Jews (myself included) unfortunately still do treat Jews of color differently even when we don't mean to."
Judaism,3dkxz5,Jasonberg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:02:56 2015 UTC,I guess that being a black woman makes dating hard even if you're not Jewish. If you're restricted to dating Jews it's going to be even harder.

My wife went to MO day schools her whole life, while at home her family started out conservadox but slid down in observance to the point of no Shabbos, etc for her more formative years.  As a result there's a lot of education that she didn't retain or pieces that didn't click.    So in a situation where you have a dedicatedly observant orthodox family, where practice is intense at home and in school, vs. a not very observant non-orthodox family that might send their kid to a once or twice a week Hebrew school, there's a big divergence both at home and in school, and of course plenty people with mixed situations.  In the end the most important factor is how the parents choose to raise the child.  Being that less committed families tend to float towards non-orthodox movements it's not surprising that literacy ends up being low."
Judaism,3dmzac,benadreti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm...But did the day schooling help her connect to your more Orthodox world, where her home life hadn't prepared her?"
Judaism,3dmzac,benadreti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well she wanted to be more orthodox if that's what you're asking.  She actually went to college in a place without many Jews and no orthodox.  On Rosh Hashannah she went to the local Conservative shul and was deeply upset by how different and non-traditional it was compared to what she grew up with.  Also in the Hillel she was heavily involved but always felt different due to her more traditional perspective and desires.  So long story short, after college she knew which direction to move in."
Judaism,3dmzac,ReishLakish,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:34 2015 UTC,"My reasoning: It should be safe to say that pre-war Jewish masses and/or late 19th century Jews didn't get a lot of formal religious education.   It was cost prohibitive for a lot of poorer families.   A girl in 1870s Poland, might not be knowledgable about how the Talmud came to be compiled or even what books are in the Tanakh, but experientially she'd possess a literacy about traditions/customs.   Most older women I know who could fit into this category have/had the entire tehilim by heart. Literacy was near universal.   So if you grow up Reform, you get less osmotic learning than your Polish grandma and maybe no better religious education. Meanwhile, your Orthodox cousin, also gets less of that osmotic learning, but gets a far superior education.   Yes.  yiddisher heim is the basis of all Jewish Education."
Judaism,3dmzac,Zel606,2,Fri Jul 17 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"The Jewish literacy gap has widened, in large part because Orthodox children receive much better education then most Jews ever did in the past.   I don't think that's the case.  Orthodox jews have always had education and placed an extraordinarily high value on it.  There are thousands of stories of pre-war yeshivot in eastern europe and the extreme sacrifices people made to attend and the very high standards/requirements for entry (having multiple tractates of gemara entierly memorized by rote for example).  I like to think of the Torah as the ""song of my people"" - for it to be passed down from generation to generation requires a significant investment into education.  Reform does not and did not place the same importance on the song or it's transmission and thus both loses members to assimilation more rapidly and has a less experienced and fluent user base."

There was definitely a long period of time in America where Orthodox education was very weak. The old ""cheder"" model was no longer working and the community was slow to adapt to the change. This changed when Europeans arrived following WWII and focused much of their efforts on building schools."
Judaism,3dmzac,Zel606,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:58:27 2015 UTC,You are correct and wrong.  The cheder model is still somewhat used today; it was weak because there weren't enough of the schools by a long shot and nobody had any money to pay teachers.  Therefore many kids went to public schools and disliked their foreign parents and their customs (this wasn't a uniquely jewish problem).  This bolstered the reform movement greatly; at least according to some historians.  They were offering an Americanized version of their religion so they didn't have to convert but could still be around their friends.  Many others also just chose to leave Judaism completely - as for the first time for many of them the choice to leave was easier than ever.
Judaism,3dmzac,random_number_string,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:40:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say. Back in the day not only were many people uneducated, they were ignorant. The Hasidic movement and Bais Yaakov education were both ways of getting people back to their religion.  People stayed in the fold regardless of how religious they truly were because assimilation was virtually impossible. But now that assimilation is possible, there's nothing keeping Jews from leaving. Jewish education definitely helps with retention."
Judaism,3dmzac,johnsonbabylotion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:05:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought. I think that the level of Jewish education Orthodox children etc. receive today is much greater than that of their ancestors. Since there are generally no exclusively Jewish villages, religious literacy becomes more important for Jews connect to each other and to a synagogue etc. Because of this formal religious education has taken such a greater importance in the American context. I don't think the non-Orthodox movements have done a good job keeping up.   I think people might look at the differences today and conclude that back in the ""old country"", people were knowledgeable in a way that is ahistorical. When in fact, very few people had quality education.   EDIT: had to rewrite this comment."

I want to say a better example might be public transportation on a fixed rail, especially if the rail was enclosed, but I think it might have to be built from the ground up for this purpose if it was going to work (so maybe only in Israel would there be the will to spend money on making this possible).

The long term goal is to have cars which not only don't need a human to handle unforseen errors, but handles unforeseen situations better, on average, than humans do (ie it would have fewer accidents than the average human driver).  And, last I heard, the human drivers of Google's implementation had never been needed, even on the open road. So we're close."
Judaism,3dm3ku,refavi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:31:13 2015 UTC,"And, last I heard, the human drivers of Google's implementation had never been needed, even on the open road.   They've actually been needed a lot. The vast majority of their driving tests have ended up having* human intervention. Although, impressively, they claim to have had cars travel over 1,000 miles before having intervention.  *I would write needing, but in many of these cases it's likely the intervention actually WASN'T necessary.  Anyway yeah, the goal is to have them be basically safer than human drivers, because this is the only way to get them legalized (and the only way a company would take on the risk of lawsuits for when their autonomous car injures someone, which, if it was only as safe as a human driver, would happen very often). But I think there are other questions to be answered before politicians will let them go around without drivers entirely. e.g., in a truly driverless car, what happens if the sensors are damaged or obstructed? Does it just stop in the middle of the road? If someone jumps out in front of it and it's not able to stop in time, does it just passively call 911 without being able to describe injuries or provide aid to the person it hit? If it blows out a tire on a tight one-lane road is it smart enough to do not-quite-proper things like partially pull up on the sidewalk to let the mass of cars piling up behind it get around? Is it smart enough to move if it's temporarily parked somewhere - waiting for passengers, or anything - but blocking another vehicle or someone moving furniture? When construction crews have one direction on a two-way street blocked off, is it smart enough to follow their signs and drive though the opposite-direction lane at the right time?  Note that in many of these cases the autonomous car is better than a human driver in some respects (it will likely handle stopping after blowing out a tire much more gracefully, calling 911 immediately after a collision with no possibility of a hit-and-run is an amazing benefit, and if it does know it has to move to let someone around it in a confined space it will likely be better at maneuvering than human drivers). But I still think it's the weird, rare events that are easy for a human driver that are going to be driving policy, because in these situations it's safest if there's both an autonomous component and a human component. Of course, we'll see in the next couple of decades!"

But I think there are other questions to be answered before politicians will let them go around without drivers entirely.   I think it will take a long time for politicians to come around regardless of whether it's rational.  A lot of the examples you give are things that can easily happen to a human driver as well, so I think technically it's a question of probabilities (eg as long as sensors don't suddenly fail more often than a human falls asleep, loses a contact lense, get's distracted... it's still beating humans). But I don't think the issue will be handled technically for a while.  Also, I'm assuming that even a car without a human driver will have human passengers, and in a case like that, stopping and making a phone call (that the passenger would have to deal with) would be a much better response than the average human driver/passenger combo."

My assumption is that even if it was clearly the better option to have fully automated cars (suppose 50% fewer people will die in car accidents each year, gas efficiency went up 20%, transit times dropped 30%) they STILL won't do it because they'll be afraid whenever an autonomous car does mess up and kill someone they'll take all the blame. No entirely without reason, of course."

Judaism,3dn6de,LazerA,8,Fri Jul 17 21:19:53 2015 UTC,"It's not really an issue.  The Rema (O""C 27) brings from the Rashba that a chatzitza is only a problem under the bottim, not the retzuos.  The nossei keilim there say that one should avoid a chatzitza under the retzuos where they're needed for tying the tefillin in place, but the rest is fine.  Even then though, the retzuah, it seems to me, is a classic case of min b'mino aino chotzetz.  Indeed, the M""B there brings a machlokes achronim as whether the retzuos are a chatzitza if they pass under the bottim or whether, being part of the tefillin, we'd call that min b'mino and say it's fine."

Judaism,3dn0w7,ajmarks,2,Sun Jul 19 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"She is, in effect, chaining her husband to a marriage due to her anti-Torah ideology.  She should be treated with as much contempt as the men who do this for their selfish reasons. Let her sit in jail."
Judaism,3dn0w7,akivachaim,3,Sat Jul 18 18:44:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that if all that's necessary is for her to be present to receive the get, she should do so as a matter of basic courtesy. But even assuming jail time is justified for refusing to do so (something that I am not at all convinced of, in either direction), the marriage was through the Conservative/Masorti movement, not through the rabbinate, and if she's willing to divorce via them (something the article is not clear about) it's hard to argue she should be forced to divorce through the rabbinate.  Do you believe that an Orthodox Jew should be forced under threat of jail time to participate in another branch or religion's divorce ceremony, under the authority of their religious leaders, if that's what their spouse needs?"
Judaism,3dn0w7,refavi,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:12:00 2015 UTC,She's the woman of the wall picture in the other article.  She's just out to spread her agenda.
Judaism,3dn0w7,Zel606,4,Fri Jul 17 19:42:53 2015 UTC,"She's just out to spread her agenda.   So her plan was to get an unreported, unregistered non-Orthodox marriage, then decide to get divorced over 10 years later and trick her husband into taking their case to an Orthodox court so she could face an arrest warrant for refusing to acknowledge the authority of rabbis her rabbis don't recognize as authoritative, all as some kind of roundabout way of showing there's some issues with the way Israel handles marriage and divorce?  Because if so, I have to admit, that's a pretty good plan."

Judaism,3dn0w7,Zel606,4,Sun Jul 19 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, okay. I'd believe that, since she's a member of an activist group. That being said, I think there's a real concern here in terms of religious freedom (much moreso than whatever happens at the Kotel, or attempts to push changes in Orthodox observance). It's difficult for me to understand how the rabbinate can claim jurisdiction over marriages that not only weren't performed under their authority, but weren't even performed by Orthodox rabbis in the first place.  So while there's a possibility the situation is being exploited, I think in this case there's a legitimate concern either way."

Judaism,3dltx3,ajmarks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:15:47 2015 UTC,"In the ruling, Rabbi Raziel cites a question posed to Rabbi Nachum Rabinowitz, head of Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Ma'aleh Adumim. In that ruling, Rabbi Rabinowitz stated that not embarrassing the reader takes priority over the correctness of the reading, because while the former is Torah law, the latter is Rabbinic Law.   Regarding the ruling of the historic legal authority Rambam reasoning that a mistake nullifies the entire public's obligation to hear the reading, the rabbi replied that it is better that the public not fulfill its obligation than to be guilty of embarrassing another person.    I am continually amazed at how people constantly find things that all of the rishonim and achronim just overlooked.  Like, what was the Rambam thinking?  Didn't he realize correcting somebody is forbidden because it embarrasses him?  And how could the Shulchan Pasken that we should correct people?  Why didn't the Rema argue?  And the Taz and M""A should have said something!  We are fortunate to live in a time with such great talmidei chachomim who can see where everybody else went wrong and the issues overlooked by centuries upon centuries of great scholars!"
