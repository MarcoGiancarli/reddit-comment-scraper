MoviePosterPorn,3d215p,scartol,3,Mon Jul 13 11:36:16 2015 UTC,Have you even seen Robocop 3?
MoviePosterPorn,3d215p,Hnuggets,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:31:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but 2 is worse. Why?  1. The Mass-Murderer Cyborg. I'm serious. Some woman at OCP decides that for the Robocop 2 prototype, they should put the brain of a mass-murderer into it. Brilliant! This, of course, is after one other prototype shoots itself in the head and another rips off his faceplate to reveal -- for some reason -- a screaming human skull.   2. The Drug-Dealing Twelve-Year-Old. Again, not kidding. The drug lord Cain knows that Robocop can't shoot a kid, so he has a kid working for him, cursing up a storm and shooting police officers and selling Nuke.   3. Nuke. Nuke is the drug sold by Cain and his cult. (Yes, it makes perfect sense that a drug dealer would also be the leader of a cult.) When you shoot up, it makes a sound like a tire-air-pressure gauge makes when you check the air in your tires. Did I mention that Robocop 2 is addicted to Nuke?   4. Day-Glo Graffiti Under Blacklights on City Streets. The first scenes of the movie (after the lame attempt to replicate the excellent pseudo-ads from the first) show horrible scenes of violence, wherein everyone attacks everyone in a frenzied attempt to get money for Nuke. This goes on in front of brick walls painted with great care with graffiti done in fluorescent paint, lit by black lights for some reason. I guess that's how graffiti will look in the future.   5. The New Directives. In an attempt -- I guess -- to mock parents who object to violence in the media, the filmmakers at one point have OCP overload Robocop 1 with over 200 new directives. These include things like ""Avoid interpersonal confrontations"" and ""If you can't say anything nice, remain silent."" (These also appear on the diagnostics monitors as multicolored directives for some reason, whereas his original 4 were always plain white.) As a result, Robocop 1 becomes paralyzed by conflicting orders and ends up doing absurd things like shooting at someone who is smoking; reading a dead man his Miranda rights; and allowing a violent criminal little league team which has ransacked an electronics store to escape as he lectures them on nutrition.   6. The Violent Criminal Little League Team. As the kids swipe electronics and smash the store owner's kneecaps with a baseball bat (while others yell ""harder!""), the coach of the team loads up the minivan with stolen goods and shoots at cops. I'm speechless as to how to comment here.   7. The Use of High-Voltage Electricity To Erase Superfluous Directives. To rid himself of the paralyzing extra orders from OCP, Robocop 1 marches out of the police station and grabs the conduits of an electricity junction box. For some reason, this wipes all of his directives clear, but leaves his operating system intact. Yes, it makes perfect sense.   8. Excessively Gratuitous Violence. It's hard for me to claim that this movie is more gratuitously violent than something directed by Paul Verhoven, Mr. Toxic-Sludge-Melting-Guy-Splattered-Against-Truck himself. But the stuff in Robocop 2 isn't even funny or chilling. It's just gratuitous. Eye gouging, vivisection, and too many bullet wounds to bother counting.  Besides, 2 was closer to the original, which is one of the five most important SF movies ever made."

MoviePosterPorn,3d215p,traceitalian,2,Wed Jul 15 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"I usually get a knee-jerk response to get upset when someone talks badly about Robocop 1 OR 2, being that part 1 has always been my favorite film (i was born in '86. I remember having already seen the first one before part 2 came out. I was 4 when 2 was released and excited to see it, vividly) but anyways, i wanna thank you for the long, long response. I appreciate your insight. I personally find it to be close to the first one in quality, but not exactly on par. if robocop 1 is a 10/10 then part 2 is an 8/10 to me. This is the kind of discussion i wish i could find more of on here. Thank you, seriously.    Also: have you seen Chappie? I found it to be so full of Robocop homages that I loved loved loved it. Jackman created an ED-209 basically, Dev Patel is sort of Bob Morton. The non-chappie Scout robots talk almost exactly like Robocop and the original short film Tetra Vaal is an homage to robocop, as well. The first time you see Die Antwoord in the film is very evocative of the ""you burned the fuckin' money!"" scene on the highway where you meet clarence and his crew in Robocop, as well. It's great for a Robocop fan, i feel."

Johnny Vaughan of The Sun already called it the ""most arresting Brit-com of 2007"". Phillip French of The Observer, who did not care for Shaun of the Dead, warmed to the comedy team in this film. The film also received positive reviews stateside. Derek Elley of Variety praised Broadbent and Dalton as ""especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect"". As an homage to the genre, the film was well received by screenwriter Shane Black. On Spill.com, it got their 2nd-highest rating of 'Full Price!!'.

When she is taken back to Earth, she learns that a human colony was founded on the same planet where the aliens were first found. After contact with the colony is lost, she finds herself sent back to the planet along with a team of warriors bent on destroying the alien menace forever, and saving any survivors -- if any remain. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Test and pre-screenings were unable to take place for Aliens due to the film not being completed until its week of release. Once it was released in cinemas, critical reaction was generally positive to very positive. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and called it ""painfully and unremittingly intense"" and a ""superb example of filmmaking craft."" He also stated ""when I walked out of the theater, there were knots in my stomach from the film's roller-coaster ride of violence."" Walter Goodman of The New York Times said it was a ""flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics."" Time magazine featured the film on the cover of its July 28, 1986, issue, calling it the ""summer's scariest movie"". Time reviewer Richard Schickel declared the film ""a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore."" The selection of Aliens for a Time cover was attributed to the successful reception of the film, as well as its novel example of a science fiction action heroine. Echoing Time's assessment, Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader called the film ""one sequel that surpasses the original."" Gene Siskel gave the film a negative review, describing Aliens as ""one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses"" and that ""toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn't want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours.""

For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, ""Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen. ... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't even see the shark."" Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as ""an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order"" and complimented its acting and ""extraordinary technical achievements"".

Rotten Tomatoes sampled 296 reviewers and judged 92% of the reviews to be positive, while the film scored of 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 43 reviews. A number of critics, including Kate Muir, reviewing for The Times, Philip French, writing in The Observer, IGN's Daniel Krupa and the reviewers for the Irish Independent and the Daily Record, all asked whether Skyfall was the best Bond film produced. The Daily Telegraph‍ '​s film reviewer, Robbie Collin, considered Skyfall to be ""often dazzling, always audacious"", with excellent action sequences in a film that contained humour and emotion. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter thought that Skyfall was ""dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor"", going on to say that it was a film that had ""some weight and complexity to it"". Variety‍‍ '​‍s Peter DeBruge suggested that the film's greatest strength lay in its willingness to put as much focus on characterisation as it did action set-pieces, allowing the two to co-exist rather than compete for the audience's attention, while Manohla Dargis, reviewing for The New York Times, considered Skyfall to be ""a superior follow-up to Casino Royale"" which is ""opulent rather than outlandish and insistently, progressively low-key"". Kim Newman, reviewing the film for Empire, concluded, ""Skyfall is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately"". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, describing it as ""a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon"". Reviewing for the New Statesman, Ryan Gilbey saw that ""nostalgia permeates the movie"", going on to say that ""sometimes the old ways are the best"".

Replicants were declared illegal after a bloody mutiny on an Off-World Colony, and are to be terminated upon detection. Man's obsession with creating a being equal to himself has back-fired. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   In the United States, a general criticism was its slow pacing that detracts from other strengths; Sheila Benson from the Los Angeles Times called it ""Blade Crawler"", while Pat Berman in The State and Columbia Record described it as ""science fiction pornography"". Pauline Kael noted that with its ""extraordinary"" congested-megalopolis sets, Blade Runner ""has its own look, and a visionary sci-fi movie that has its own look can't be ignored – it has its place in film history"" but ""hasn't been thought out in human terms"". Roger Ebert praised the visuals of both the original Blade Runner and the Director's Cut versions and recommended it for that reason; however, he found the human story clichéd and a little thin. In 2007, upon release of The Final Cut, Ebert somewhat revised his original opinion of the film and added it to his list of Great Movies, while noting, ""I have been assured that my problems in the past with Blade Runner represent a failure of my own taste and imagination, but if the film was perfect, why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it?"" Blade Runner holds a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 8.4 out of 10 from 96 reviews. The site's main consensus reads ""Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time. A visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece.""

Wife finds out about his second life and sees how damaged he is and tries to help him and be gentle. He falls in love with her again (as the new self) and casts out the old cheating/afraid self. But then he realizes he's trapped to her (just like he realized in the past which caused his mental breakdown) and he flips out.

At the end of the film, the final shot (that I've replicated here) implies Barry has his cape, and can now fly forever, (with all those air miles) like Superman (there's also plenty of other references, but it's just fan theory. PTA wont tell us anything but ""it's 90 minutes long"" if we ask about PDL. http://society6.com/product/punch-drunk-love-tdr_print#1=45"

MoviePosterPorn,3boem8,goldenrod,6,Wed Jul 1 01:27:35 2015 UTC,I've heard that the move has similar narrative but it won't be exactly like Miller's civil war; it's far too convoluted.
MoviePosterPorn,3boem8,Spiralyst,5,Wed Jul 1 03:28:57 2015 UTC,"Without doubt. It's a seven issue series not included the 30+ issues under different titles more or less directly relating to the story arc. That would make for a compelling tv series, but a 2 hour movie won't even be the cliff notes. They'll probably take the 3 biggest events or plot devices and reign in the amount of supers mightily."

Kevin Jackson of Sight & Sound said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances, the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of ""both sap and hero"". Writing in Film Quarterly, Gary Hentzi praised the actors, but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col. Fitts were stereotypes. Hentzi accused Mendes and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky, saying the latter was their ""fantasy figure""—a teenaged boy who's an absurdly wealthy artist able to ""finance [his] own projects"". Hentzi said Angela was the most believable teenager, in particular with her ""painfully familiar"" attempts to ""live up to an unworthy image of herself"". Maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal, but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the actors coped ""faultlessly"" with what were difficult roles; he called Spacey's performance ""the energy that drives the film"", saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester's not always being sympathetic. ""Against considerable odds, we do like [these characters],"" Turan concluded.

Replicants were declared illegal after a bloody mutiny on an Off-World Colony, and are to be terminated upon detection. Man's obsession with creating a being equal to himself has back-fired. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   In the United States, a general criticism was its slow pacing that detracts from other strengths; Sheila Benson from the Los Angeles Times called it ""Blade Crawler"", while Pat Berman in The State and Columbia Record described it as ""science fiction pornography"". Pauline Kael noted that with its ""extraordinary"" congested-megalopolis sets, Blade Runner ""has its own look, and a visionary sci-fi movie that has its own look can't be ignored – it has its place in film history"" but ""hasn't been thought out in human terms"". Roger Ebert praised the visuals of both the original Blade Runner and the Director's Cut versions and recommended it for that reason; however, he found the human story clichéd and a little thin. In 2007, upon release of The Final Cut, Ebert somewhat revised his original opinion of the film and added it to his list of Great Movies, while noting, ""I have been assured that my problems in the past with Blade Runner represent a failure of my own taste and imagination, but if the film was perfect, why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it?"" Blade Runner holds a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 8.4 out of 10 from 96 reviews. The site's main consensus reads ""Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time. A visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece.""

Upon its release, Close Encounters became a box office success, grossing $116.39 million in North America and $171.7 million in foreign countries, totaling $288 million. It became Columbia Pictures' most successful film at that time. Jonathan Rosenbaum refers to the film as ""the best expression of Spielberg's benign, dreamy-eyed vision."" A.D.

Murphy found most of the film slow-paced, but praised the film's climax. Pauline Kael called it ""a kid's film in the best sense.""

Dance is more Autobiographical, it depicts his family life and features his aggressive father as the main character. So its a little more realistic than his other films.... HOWEVER. This is Jodorowsky we are talking about.... so yes there are wonderfully insane visuals, philosophy and imagery, including his mother who only communicates through opera singing, amputee miners fighting, etc. its not as insane but if you want to get into his mind its worth a watch (I just checked Rotten Tomatoes and it has 94% rating)"

Bandits slaughtered a village on his path, so El Topo avenges the massacred, then forcibly takes their leader's woman Mara as his.

Arnold wrote of the film: ""There's not enough art to justify the sickening reality of Jodorowsky's artistic method.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)  Western [USA:Not Rated, 2 h 59 min] Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Aldo Giuffrè Director: Sergio Leone  IMDb rating: ★★★★★★★★★☆ 8.9/10 (432,604 votes)   The Good is Blondie, a wandering gunman with a strong personal sense of honor. The Bad is Angel Eyes, a sadistic hitman who always hits his mark. The Ugly is Tuco, a Mexican bandit who's always only looking out for himself. Against the backdrop of the Civil War, they search for a fortune in gold buried in a graveyard. Each knows only a portion of the gold's exact location, so for the moment they're dependent on each other. However, none are particularly inclined to share... (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Critical opinion of the film on initial release was mixed as many reviewers at that time looked down on Spaghetti Westerns. In a negative review in The New York Times, critic Renata Adler said that the film ""must be the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre."" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the ""temptation is hereby proved irresistible to call The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, now playing citywide, The Bad, The Dull, and the Interminable, only because it is."" Roger Ebert, who later included the film in his list of Great Movies, retrospectively noted that in his original review he had ""described a four-star movie but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a 'Spaghetti Western' and so could not be art"". Ebert also points out Leone's unique perspective that enables the audience to be closer to the character as we see what he sees.

To support his extravagant lifestyle, he is also an art thief, which he does in cahoots with his friend, the gun toting Ove Kjikerud. They replace the originals with forgeries, which go undetected at least until the trail back to the thieves goes cold. His outward bravado, based primarily on building upon reputation, masks his insecurities, especially in his short physical stature. He feels he needs that confident demeanor and wealth to get what he wants, including his trophy wife, art gallery owner Diana Brown. However, he almost seems to like the thought of what Diana represents more than Diana herself. As such, he has a mistress on the side named Lotte. The issue of having a baby - Diana wants to get pregnant while Roger doesn't want her to - is another bone of contention in their marriage. The two sides of Roger's professional life intersect when Diana introduces him to Clas Greve, who would be perfect for the CEO position at Pathfinder, the job for which Roger is currently recruiting. Clas is also in possession of a priceless Rubens, which if Roger and Ove can steal it, would be by far their most lucrative theft to date. After he and Ove are able to steal the painting, things start going wrong for Roger. He learns that Diana is having an affair with Clas. And someone is trying to kill him. He learns that it is Clas, who seems to know his every move. Is Clas trying to kill him for Diana? Or because he knows about the theft? Or a combination of the two? Or is there a bigger picture which Roger will have to discover? (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Headhunters received very positive reviews.

(IMDb)   Critical reception:   Schindler's List is widely acclaimed as a remarkable achievement by film critics and audiences. Notable Americans such as talk show host Oprah Winfrey and President Bill Clinton urged their countrymen to see it. World leaders in many countries saw the film, and some met personally with Spielberg. Stephen Schiff of The New Yorker called it the best historical drama about the Holocaust, a movie that ""will take its place in cultural history and remain there."" Roger Ebert described it as Spielberg's best, ""brilliantly acted, written, directed, and seen."" Terrence Rafferty, also with The New Yorker, admired the film's ""narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness."" He noted the performances of Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley, and Davidtz as warranting special praise, and calls the scene in the shower at Auschwitz ""the most terrifying sequence ever filmed."" In his 2013 movie guide, Leonard Maltin awards the film a rare four-star rating and gives a lengthy review. He calls the film a ""staggering adaptation of Thomas Keneally's best-seller,"" saying ""this looks and feels like nothing Hollywood has ever made before."" [It is] ""Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date,"" he concludes. James Verniere of the Boston Herald noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a ""major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust."" In his review for the New York Review of Books, British critic John Gross said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized ""were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement."" Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the ""visual brilliance"" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. He describes the sequence as ""realistic"" and ""stunning"". He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe. The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.
