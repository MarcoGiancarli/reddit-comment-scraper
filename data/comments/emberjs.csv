emberjs,3e3u22,abuiles,2,Tue Jul 21 21:17:37 2015 UTC,"I know I've thanked you in the past, but really, your book gave me the confidence in Ember that I needed to push back against (and ultimately convert) the pro-Angular devs in our company.  Moreover, I've been given permission to allow our devs to buy it and expense it. Yea, I'm a fan :)"
emberjs,3e3u22,2468ben,5,Wed Jul 22 00:06:13 2015 UTC,"Whatever you do, I'd suggest that the devs don't dive into the RFCs or discussion forums (discuss.ember.js, Slack rooms) too hard for a few weeks, because so much is being proposed and thrown around that they can get even more frustrated.  It's frothy: like a keg in college where you ask for beer, they pour you a cup of foam, and you have to wait for a while to actually get the substance back, or you'll just get pissed at yourself for drinking empty bubbles.  I suggest the 2.0 books, the 1.13 guides (new as of yesterday) and the blog post explaining the difference: http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/06/12/ember-1-13-0-released.html  Once you've all gotten a handle on Ember then the ""real-time"" discussions are very interesting and you can relate to people's concerns, but until then I'd only use them for asking your own specific questions. Maybe one of us pedantic Ember veterans might tell you it's already been answered somewhere, but with everything moving so fast you're better off ignoring any solution you see and just re-asking.  if you PM me I'd happily chat about Ember (and ""stir down that froth""). Unless we find out we're competitors in which case ActiveX is definitely the way to go."

I don't really know what the best way to start learning is. I like the Codeschool courses, so I'll take their Ember one, but it's for a super old version so there'll presumably be a lot out of date."
emberjs,3c8wbd,TeamHelloWorld,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:05:42 2015 UTC,"If it's out of date, don't buy it. Ember has changed a lot in the last 6 months.  Start with Ember-CLI as it comes with an app boilerplate. Play around with the router as it's pretty much the most important thing in Ember now and going forward (Routable components, etc.)  Get on EmberCommunity Slack as it is normally quite vibrant and welcoming.  Other than that, use 1.13 version of ember and 1.12 guides. The information in them is still valid and if it has been deprecated, the warning will point you in the right direction.   Feel free to PM me as well if you have any questions."
emberjs,3c8wbd,mattaugamer,3,Tue Jul 7 12:19:52 2015 UTC,Read the change logs and etc.  But I don't think there is a problem with either.  1.13 should be easily upgradable to 2.0.
emberjs,3c8wbd,mattaugamer,2,Mon Jul 6 01:35:48 2015 UTC,"I would honestly say go with 1.13. Everything will ""just work"" nicely together, and you won't have to worry about any manual setup to ensure versions play ball, or any weird edge cases.   When you're just learning this kind of issue can be crippling, because you never know whether you done broke it or it done broke itself.  BTW, I'd be very interested to see your feedback on going to Ember from Angular, as I'm looking at doing the opposite myself."
emberjs,3c8wbd,wkrause13,3,Mon Jul 6 02:23:20 2015 UTC,"So far I've found ember a little harder to pick up than Angular, which is weird considering I had heard the opposite.  With Ember I feel like everything has much more structure, which is good but harder to fully understand. I've mostly found myself confused by the ES6 syntax as well as the fact that the app is broken into so many distinct parts. The abstraction, which I'm sure is good, is pretty confusing as a beginner. The resources for learning also seem a little sparse. I'm also not a huge fan of how many folders there are in the directory, but that's more personal. I realize I have nothing good to say yet, but that's mostly because I'm still struggling with the framework. I'm sure there'll be more positives as I get better at it.   Angular was much easier to get up and running very quickly, but then you soon realize that with all the flexibility that you're given it's very easy to do things the complete wrong way. The $scope object, which every tutorial shoves down your throat as the main way of interacting with apps, is not what you should be using most of the time. It's very useful, but it is a tool that should be used sparingly and oftentimes only because you need to use methods only defined on the $scope object. The power of angular lies in it's directives and the reusability and abstraction that they can wrap up into an html element/attribute. I could write so many paragraphs on this, but I don't think this is the place. The only other thing that'll I'll say is that the best practices with angular aren't very apparent. It took me a few years to decouple from scope and really push angular to its limits in ways that you won't find on any blog.  So Angular was easier to instantly pick up, but it's free form nature is its biggest upside and downside.   Ember feels like it's harder to learn, but if that structure leads to me writing better apps from the get go than I'm all for it.   I can't really say which is better at this point."
emberjs,3c8wbd,anlumo,3,Mon Jul 6 02:44:23 2015 UTC,"That's a great reply. Honestly, I don't know who is telling people that Ember is easier than Angular. Ember has a difficulty cliff and it can be really hard to get into. Not only that, but it's smooth sailing until you try to do something that's not ""the ember way"" and then it will beat the living shit out of you. Sometimes it's hard to know what the right way is, you just know you're not on it because everything is sooooo hard.  That said, when you start to ""get it"", Ember has a hell of a lot to offer in terms of productivity. The thoughts behind it are sensible and positive, and it's a disciplined and logical framework.   The resources for learning also seem a little sparse.   This is totally valid. There are a few tutorials here and there, and some ebooks that are relevant, but much of the ember stuff you find online is horribly out of date.    I'm also not a huge fan of how many folders there are in the directory, but that's more personal.   I'd strongly recommend ignoring that completely. One of the really big benefits of Ember now is that it lets you break everything up into tiny, tiny pieces, and work on them separately. Your routes, your templates, all of that, are broken down quite finely. When you have a small MVP app of the type most tutorials show you won't really see the point of this. In fact, it gets in the way if anything. A lot of the architecture is like this in Ember. It's a framework for ""ambitious web applications"". And it's once you start trying to do more with it that you realise how very powerful it can be. The directory structure is an example of this. Having an entire directory for the routes, or a separate directory for the Posts, or whatever... this seems kind of pointless at first. But as the application grows, it stays perfectly clear.   I'm sure there'll be more positives as I get better at it.   I assume you're using Ember CLI, right? A big key to loving Ember is to learn to really use Ember CLI. For example, being able to generate resources or routes is great. I had an application die for three days before someone told me I'd spelled ""adapter"" wrong and that was the only problem. Generators save you from yourself. CLI trivialises the build process, as well. No fussing around with Grunt or Gulp, everything just works out of the box, no settings. Add-ons also become trivial. Aside from the great ones built in, the ability to just install something like font awesome with a simple command and then just use {{fa-icon ""paperclip""}} immediately is wonderful. No bower, just magic. You start to run into these as you look for bits of functionality and find they've already been done. Liquid Fire is a really good example.   So Angular was easier to instantly pick up, but it's free form nature is its biggest upside and downside.   It's funny you say that, I think that's remarkably true about the entire JS framework ecosystem at the moment. What people will sell and promote as positives I often see as negatives. And vice versa. You know, ""React is just the V in MVC, so you can use whatever you want to handle the rest!"" Wait... why do I want a third of a framework?! ""Angular is less opinionated, so it's better!"" Don't you want opinionated in a framework? Isn't that what a framework is? ""React lets you just put your HTML straight into the output and it just works!"" Oh sweet mother of god what a maintenance nightmare in six months! I saw someone in /r/webdev ask what the best framework was, and be told that the best framework is the one that is the least opinionated and lets you write normal JS, so Angular is the best. It was weird that our views were completely opposites.  Anyway, I've ranted long enough. Good luck with it. If you have any questions, hit us up!"

emberjs,3c4raw,learc83,3,Sat Jul 4 19:47:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend using the canary branch. Not for a soon-to-be production ready project.  Obviously converting {{component}} to <component> is trivial. But to avoid rewriting a lot of code, you should use the new get/set properties. In that way you can more easily control the flow of the application. :-)  It's described in the Ember 1.12 release in the third code block: http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/05/13/ember-1-12-released.html"

emberjs,3bj5c9,mycentstoo,5,Mon Jun 29 17:31:30 2015 UTC,no book recommendation. (I'm struggling myself to get the pieces together on a brand new ember 2.0 project) but the ember.js slack community is quite active and helpful.

emberjs,3bj5c9,wkrause13,2,Sat Jul 4 05:11:39 2015 UTC,"Another suggestions would be to find ember projects on github and follow the commit history from the beginning. I find that to be one of the best ways to approach a new framework, especially if the supporting material is out of date. If the commit history is decent, it'll often teach you more than a tutorial anyway.  If the project is on an older version of Ember, then see if you are able to update it to 1.13. It'll teach you a lot about how Ember works in the process.  Here's a good list of projects: http://iheanyi.com/blog/a-list-of-open-source-emberjs-projects/  The HN Reader is fairly approachable.   Also one not on the list is: https://github.com/cibernox/mobile-patterns  Mobile-patterns is closer to what you'll see in 2.0, while still not being 100% there. By that I mean it is component centric (though it has not removed controllers entirely) and it tries to follow the data down actions up principle throughout the project, which is arguably one of the more significant changes to the way people will design their apps in 2.0. I'm working through the commit history myself, trying to learn what I can, and making sure it's compatible with 1.13 as I move forward in the commit history. If I don't understand a change the author made in a commit, I consult the ember api documentation. It's a slow, but rewarding process."
emberjs,3bj5c9,craniumslows,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:20:55 2015 UTC,Fantastic suggestion.  Thank you.  I actually hadn't considered this but it makes a ton of sense. I think this is the best route suggested so far.

emberjs,3ba46t,Gaurav0,3,Sat Jun 27 06:07:07 2015 UTC,"Yay! This is great news. Ember Data has been a mixed experience for me. When I first started using it a long time ago it was very unstable. There were constant bugs, the api standards were not very clear, and there were some savage incompatibilities in versions. Basically it was very beta.  Increasingly, though, Ember Data has become a mature and sophisticated feature of the Ember ecosystem. Its by-default inclusion in Ember CLI trivialises versioning, and by itself it is IMO one of the real killer features of Ember. No other framework has anything like it, as far as I know."

emberjs,3b8uwd,w0d3n,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:42:43 2015 UTC,"Hey I bought this book as well and am just now working my way through it. I found the link-to section to be rather confusing. I'm hoping you can elaborate on it in a newer revision of your book.   Specifically the first time link-to is ever mentioned it is written as:  {{#each friend in model}}   <li>     {{#link-to 'friends.show' friend}}       {{friend.firstName}} {{friend.lastName}}     {{/link-to}}   </li> {{/each}}   Yet, a few lines later you say:  “If our friend model had a property called fullName, we could have written the helper like:""  {{link-to friend.fullName 'friends.show' friend}}   What happened to writing link-tos like {{#link-to ... }}? Is the missing # a typo? Is it a different valid way of writing link-tos? It's never explained. Also it would be great if you could explain exactly what we are passing into the link-tos. In the first example I am assuming we are passing the route and then the model, but in the second example we are apparently passing a computed property, then the route, then the model. What else can we pass into a link-to? Does the order matter? None of this is explained which is frustrating for me since I have never worked with a JS framework before.   Anyway, thanks for writing this book. It is definitely easier to understand than Ember's own docs.   Cheers!  EDIT:  Just wanted to add that stopping/starting the server does not seem to kick off a broccoli build as indicated in the book. I've modified my Brocfile.js but nothing is output into the vendor directory. Is there a command I can enter to build it manually since it doesn't seem to happen automatically?"

I used you code and I can now render it, but it seems to only render sometimes, and only when I reload the page(does not render when I enter the route through link-to). I think this has to do with the way ember caches components? Also, I am not sure how I would call the grecaptcha.reset() on the component. If you have any idea on how to do either one you would be a god-send, and I'll buy you a beer.   Again, thank you for taking the time out of your day to help me out.  Edit: Okay I figured out how to get it to render all the time, even on ""link-to"" transitions, by using $.getScript in the didInsertElement hook.

emberjs,3arvk5,Gaurav0,2,Tue Jun 23 00:31:16 2015 UTC,"I'm upgrading our app from 1.0rc6 based on bunch with ember to 1.13 EmberCLI. So far, the rough edges are mostly where we didn't do things the ember way. Other than that, it's rather straightforward. I will admit that we started using RequireJS almost a year ago so the module structure is mostly there and the majority of the upgrade work is to clean up our current app and remove the global references that are still hanging around.  Oh, the resolver being completely different is a pain too. My strategy for that is to target EmberCLI and then __container__.require() whatever I need to to keep the current app happy."
emberjs,3arvk5,spinlock,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:11:21 2015 UTC,"Going from 1.11 to 1.13 was a huge endeavor, since they deprecated behavior my app was heavily relying on (updating a value twice in a single render cycle and changing some values in didInsertElement).  It feels like I'm fixing deprecations every other week, and that's really annoying. I'm coding for a moving target there. Even Ember Data causes deprecation warnings right now.  Them removing the basic concepts of ember (controllers, views and two-way bindings) in the near future doesn't really help either. This is not a post-1.0 release, it is treated like an alpha."
emberjs,3arvk5,anlumo,4,Tue Jun 23 17:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'm working on a relatively young app (we've only been at it a couple months). I do find the constant changes a bit frustrating -- and I can only imagine how bad it must be for people who already have gigantic codebases.  That said, it's pretty clear that there's a lot of stuff about Ember in its current state that's not quite right. Nearly every single time I've read about an upcoming change, my reaction has been, ""oh, yeah, that's way better."" And I'd rather be working with a technology that has the development momentum to fix big underlying problems than one that doesn't.  Of course, it'd be even better to be working with a framework that already has its architecture down well-enough to not need constant changes, but I'm not sure we have an option like that in the frontend space yet. I have a lot of hope that the stuff coming down the pipe in 2.0 will lead Ember in that direction. So, if Ember's still changing this fast in a year, I'll raise an eyebrow. For now, I'm going to hold on for dear life, and be thankful that we're moving."
emberjs,3aotsm,probablypat,3,Mon Jun 22 07:46:56 2015 UTC,"Ember is still very much progressing and feels stable and mature to me. The biggest issue to date is probably the legacy (old SO answers not relevant anymore, difficulty of finding up-to-date examples etc)  I am very happy with the approach led by the community, pushing for a robust and responsible deprecation cycles and emphasis on not breaking things. This makes updating old code to new framework versions a relative breeze.   Assuming you're fine with preferring conventions over configurations I would say Ember is a very good candidate for long-term application development."

Glimmer's more strict on html syntax so we've found a few templates that had bugs. We're also upgrading to EmberCLI and that's the big change. The hardest part so far is dealing with a different resolver. The plan is to rename our files to match the EmberCLI convention and hard code the lookup strings in the old Ember container."

Returning a promise (like with async/await) from a computed property means I can't just render the value in a template by using the computed because it ends up rendering the toString value, which is [object Promise].  Anyone know whether this is possible with computeds or have any suggestions?  I know one way is to return an object literal with the real value as a property of the object when the promise resolves, but that's not entirely ideal."

emberjs,39oxs7,M5J2X2,2,Mon Jun 15 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"AMAZING!!! Now, how do I use 2.0 via ember-cli?"
emberjs,39oxs7,NotJustClarkKent,3,Sat Jun 13 23:51:53 2015 UTC,"My hunch is that it's actually slightly more complicated than this, but theoretically it should be as simple as:  bower install --save-dev ember#2.0.0-beta.1   EDIT: The reason why I assume it's actually a little more complicated is that most upgrades to Ember with Ember CLI usually include a number of peripheral packages (e.g. ember-cli-htmlbars). Your best bet is to look at what's happening in the master branch to support Ember 1.13 and copy those changes into your project."
emberjs,39oxs7,biocs_nerd,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:07:48 2015 UTC,"You could just go to bower.json and change the ember dependency to ""beta"", like this:  ""ember"": ""beta"", ""ember-data"": ""1.0.0-beta.19.2""   Then bower install, restart the server, and you're done."

emberjs,39i41u,nshoes,4,Thu Jun 11 22:36:13 2015 UTC,"Wow <3 <3  thanks everyone for recommending the book! I owe you a big update, which hopefully will be out soon :).  On the meantime, In honor to Wicked Good EmberConf which is happening next week I created a coupon code with $10-off https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101/c/wge, enjoy!"
emberjs,39i41u,abuiles,2,Fri Jun 12 05:12:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the coupon code - I've just bought your book and it looks great! I hope you will be updating it, especially since Ember v1.13.0 (and v2.0 beta) has just been released. I would love to see some decent guides on all the new features like routable components, closure actions etc."
emberjs,39i41u,Zielarnik,2,Sat Jun 13 12:38:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've been updating with every release. Soon I'll be sending a new version :)"

emberjs,39i41u,NSGSanj,2,Sun Jun 21 06:53:52 2015 UTC,I seconded that book and also recommend http://ryanlabouve.com/ember-problems-connecting-rails-api/?utm_source=Ember+Weekly&utm_campaign=cbb7e66bbf-Ember_Weekly_Issue_94&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e96229d21d-cbb7e66bbf-106354357
emberjs,39i41u,brianllamar,2,Thu Jun 11 22:41:24 2015 UTC,Another vote for ember-cli-101.   Emberscreencasts is very good but not for beginners.  This course is meant to be good but it isn't cheap - http://www.tilde.io/events/introduction-to-ember-online/
emberjs,39i41u,richpwf,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:13:27 2015 UTC,+1 for this recommendation
emberjs,39i41u,caseyucf,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:55:13 2015 UTC,ember cli 101 is a great resource for beginning.
emberjs,39i41u,utkukaynar,3,Sat Jun 13 14:27:55 2015 UTC,"Been using EmberJS for about 6 months now, and these resources helped me out:  http://emberweekly.com/issues.html  https://www.emberscreencasts.com/  http://ember.land/"
emberjs,39i41u,albertpak,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:51:31 2015 UTC,Ember-cli-101 (https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101) is what really helped solidify concepts for me.   One of the more frustrating things about ember is that material gets outdated quickly due to the 6-week release cycle. The fact that the author keeps this book up-to-date was a huge help!
emberjs,39gi9y,arinh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"You might want to take a look at https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources which is designed to integrate rails with ember-data using the JSON-API spec. The old rails controllers weren't really designed for consumption by a single page app like ember, jsonapi-resources is designed with this use case in mind."
emberjs,39b76v,stewsters,2,Wed Jun 10 16:00:55 2015 UTC,Another good plugin out there for authetication it's torii  https://github.com/Vestorly/torii  I've wrote a quick example a few weeks ago on how to use it with google authentication:  https://github.com/Rastikko/ember-cli-google-people-torii-example

emberjs,39bdqg,XWingz87,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:45:25 2015 UTC,The App namespace was used by Ember.js prior to Ember-CLI. You now have to import Message from wherever you defined it.

emberjs,38wqn2,Gaurav0,3,Sun Jun 7 14:12:34 2015 UTC,"Good article. It's nice to see how the Ember landscape will be changing to address some of the common issues. What would really be great is if these sorts of tips and rules could be found on the Ember.js guides themselves, since that is where a lot of new developers are learning the framework."

emberjs,38ezij,opsb,2,Wed Jun 3 21:20:54 2015 UTC,Def will look more into fastboot. Thanks.
emberjs,38ezij,dead-fish,4,Wed Jun 3 23:30:40 2015 UTC,Reading through this discussion it appears they render content for the initial page load in noscript tags.   Edit: Also this blog post.

emberjs,387mkg,ibx137,4,Tue Jun 2 12:52:36 2015 UTC,"It's good to be an Ember developer. Because of the upcoming ES6 module system, services like JSBin, JSFiddle won't be usable. Ember Twiddle attempts to become an in-browser JSBin for Ember apps. Services like JSBin are important because it's such an easy tool to use to share your code to ask questions or to do small demos. I think this is seriously another great leg-up for Ember devs."

Thanks to Ember-cli using ES6 module systems, there are no more globals in our Ember code. That's nice and all, but there was an unexpected side-effect in the javascript world. Services like jsfiddle became unusable since they do not support the module system. Services like jsfiddle is important because it lets the open source community quickly demo their frontend code. He worked together with Alex Peller http://alexspeller.com/ to create Ember Twiddle! It uses github gists along with heroku to create a working ember-cli in the browser."
