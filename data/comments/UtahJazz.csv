UtahJazz,3e5tpe,Incoherentrant,5,Wed Jul 22 04:34:54 2015 UTC,It's crazy to think that a pick so far in the future (6 years) would end up landing a player like Gordon. Gordon must have been a pre teen at that point.  Makes you wonder what could happen with the Jazz future pick from Oklahoma.

UtahJazz,3e5tpe,kcirtap_89,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:37:58 2015 UTC,I remember being astounded that someone would trade Tom Gugliotta (a decent power forward/probably bench player in his prime) and a first rounder for Handlogten and Keon Clark (a decent rim defender and backup center).
UtahJazz,3e35bv,crystal_beachhouse,8,Tue Jul 21 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"I like Cotton a lot. I think he's incredibly fun to watch play.  That being said, I just don't see a way that he fits on this team, especially now that Neto has signed.    I wish there was a way for him to stay with the Jazz, but I really hope that whatever happens he finds success somewhere.  He seems like a really hungry guy who could be a capable backup somewhere."
UtahJazz,3e35bv,IllusoryCorrelation,4,Tue Jul 21 16:43:11 2015 UTC,"I think his ceiling is a solid energy back-up PG, similar to Nate Robinson circa 2010. I hope he finds that role this year with a better fitting team."
UtahJazz,3e35bv,anonatitagain,3,Tue Jul 21 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"Deserves to be on an NBA roster, just not sure he fits with ours."
UtahJazz,3e35bv,cristianbernal,3,Tue Jul 21 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"he did well against summer league players, of which less than half might see a rotation?"
UtahJazz,3e35bv,DokerinZion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:56 2015 UTC,"That's my thinking. He did really well, but honestly, his play shouldn't be taken all that seriously. I don't know how good Raul Neto is, but I think one of them should get cut. Four PGs is overkill."
UtahJazz,3e35bv,poastertoaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:36 2015 UTC,"Especially when none of them should be considered a starting pg. don't get me wrong Dante is where we should develop, but I don't think he is at starter level yet, but he will be after this season I think."
UtahJazz,3e35bv,edbenz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:50:53 2015 UTC,"At times during the summer league he got bullied on the defensive end due to this size and I really don't care much for his passing ability. With that said nearly every player you have at the end of the bench will have their issues, maybe Cotton's good attitude and work ethic will keep him around."

UtahJazz,3dyvuh,ThisIsAMormon,2,Mon Jul 20 17:32:09 2015 UTC,"Jazz (Impact rating: 7)  The Jazz had arguably the most stacked team of all in any of the Summer Leagues. They played in Utah and shifted to Las Vegas, but they didn’t play their best two guys in Las Vegas. Dante Exum’s ankle was taped up for a week and Rodney Hood had a shoulder injury, but there was no need for those guys to play more than a few games anyway.  Dante Exum, Jazz G - He only lasted one game before the Jazz held him out, but it was a doozy. Exum scored 20 points with five rebounds, five assists, one turnover and one 3-pointer in a 100-82 victory. He went to the line 10 times and was a completely different player.  Exum looked great off the dribble in this July 6 game, which was his big weakness last season. He had a whopping 64.3 percent of his shots come without a dribble last year, and he only made 23.9 percent from the field on shots with three-plus dribbles. He was also one of the worst players shooting on pick-and-roll, making just 25.9 percent on those plays. Exum said last summer that his favorite play is pick-and-roll, but he may have needed a year to learn how to run it against the pros. Patience.  The Aussie is still not even close to his ceiling and that probably won’t be happening this season either. We still can’t just say “this was Summer League” about a guy who we all thought could be the next big thing. For re-draft fantasy, I still don’t plan on targeting him.  Rodney Hood, Jazz G/F - A lot like Exum, Hood didn’t have much success off the dribble during the season. Here’s a look at his off-the-dribble numbers from last season:   https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJR-Jg0UwAAorZX.jpg  Not great. Although, he was actually really starting to turn the corner at the end of the season. This month, Hood went end-to-end a few times and was the ball-handler for PNR quite a bit. In his two Utah Summer League games, Hood averaged 20.5 points, 7.5 boards, 2.5 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.5 blocks and 0.5 treys on 54.8 percent from the field.  The biggest concern with Hood right now is his health. He has a shoulder injury right now, but it’s not expected to be a problem for long. Hood’s plantar fasciitis was a big issue on multiple occasions, but he also had ankle, hip and concussion ailments.  He’s going to have to compete with Alec Burks for the starting job. Burks was a solid ball-handler and doesn’t space the floor as well, so it makes sense to throw Burks in the second unit. Hood is worth a late look and could break out.  Trey Lyles, Jazz F - The Jazz were able to steal Lyles with the 12th pick in the draft. He’s extremely talented with the ball and even played some point guard in high school. Lyles is a legit 6’10” power forward, but he played some small forward for the Wildcats because of his athleticism.  The Jazz used him in a similar fashion. First and foremost, he was the quintessential stretch four and even made four 3-pointers in his final game against the Lakers. Lyles finished with averages of 11.3 points, 5.7 boards, 1.0 assists, 1.3 steals, 0.5 blocks and 1.0 treys. He missed a lot of easy shots around the basket, but that should come.  Interestingly, Lyles made 74.4 percent of his shots at the rim last season, but he was assisted on 60.9 percent of those. Lyles’ struggling on the easier shots in Vegas seems a bit fluky, so he’d probably be able to score 15 points per game if he had another crack at summer league today.  As alluded to, Lyles is a great fit on the Jazz. Both Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors don’t really space the floor all that well, so Lyles will be able to complement both of them. Favors can definitely play the five and his mid-range game is still not quite where it should be.  As promising as Lyles could be, he is likely going to be behind Trevor Booker for minutes. He has an interesting upside in a few years, though.  Olivier Hanlan, Jazz G - He scored 19.5 points per game at Boston College last year as one of the more well-rounded combo guards in the nation. The 6’6”, 22-year-old 42nd pick made 62.0 percent at the rim at BC last year, but that wasn’t the case in Las Vegas and in Utah.  In his eight games, Hanlan made just 26.7 percent from the field for averages of 4.1 points, 2.6 boards, 1.2 assists, 0.4 steals and 0.6 treys. Trey Burke is another Jazz guard to shoot below 30 percent in his first Summer League, so Hanlan isn’t in great company. Expect him to get a season in the D-League.  Jack Cooley, Jazz F - He is one of the best offensive rebounders in Summer League and even had seven offensive boards in 16 minutes during his first game in Utah Summer League. Besides that, Cooley was more of a glue guy in the paint, averaging 7.9 points, 6.9 boards, 0.8 blocks and 0.8 steals. The Jazz only gave the 24-year-old Cooley 87 minutes last season and he made just 40.9 percent from the field. They gave him a season-high 17 minutes in the last game of the season, but he wasn’t anything special in an eight-point, six-board game. He doesn’t have a high enough ceiling to care.  Chris Johnson, Jazz F - He is what he is. Johnson loves to hang in the corners and he’ll have the same role heading into the season. In Summer League, Johnson was moving around more and ran the offense at times. He averaged just 8.3 points, 3.3 boards, 1.9 assists, 1.3 steals, 1.0 blocks and 1.6 treys. Johnson’s ceiling is just a second-unit guy.  Bryce Cotton, Jazz G - The Jazz have quite the surplus at point guard. They already had Dante Exum and a struggling Trey Burke, but now they have Raul Neto and Cotton. Neto could wind up in the D-League because he didn’t have a successful run in Summer League a couple years ago.  General manager Dennis Lindsey also said the Jazz could wind up carrying four point guards on the roster. Cotton was one of the most entertaining players to watch this week with his killer crossovers, quickness around the rim and creativity on passes. Still, his numbers weren’t great with averages of 15.4 points, 3.9 boards, 3.8 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.1 treys on 35.4 percent from the field. He’ll obviously need a lot to happen to get on the map in fantasy."

Brock (likely) signs the deal and goes to training camp. The Jazz cut Motum and he signs a deal with the Stampede where he is an affiliate player.  He won't actually make this team."

UtahJazz,3dv0iy,habs114,8,Sun Jul 19 19:11:07 2015 UTC,"Jazz management basically said that he has improved, but not a whole lot. There is still a lot to do, so don't get your hopes up.   I'm not looking for a giant leap in stats. I'm looking more towards the way he plays. Bring more aggressive, shooting when open, making the right plays and passes.   I also expect him to play more minutes.   Basically, I'm not expecting him to be on people's list for most improved. In fact, I still expect the same, ""Is Exum a bust?"" shit.   But one thing is for sure, if he can play anywhere near what he did in that one summer league game, this team will benefit greatly."
UtahJazz,3dv0iy,jwbt123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"I think a season in which he shoots around 45% and averages something like 10ppg, 6asp, and 1 steal would be a HUGE improvement for the team."
UtahJazz,3dv0iy,bland12,5,Mon Jul 20 15:59:12 2015 UTC,"As long as he can defend his position, attack the basket at times and hit open 3s. I'll be happy."
UtahJazz,3dv0iy,TragicBronson5,4,Sun Jul 19 21:06:35 2015 UTC,"I expect him to improve quite a bit. It looks like he's put on some muscle, strength is something he needed to work on. Also his shot looks like he's been improving on it. I'm pretty excited to see this team next season!"
UtahJazz,3dv0iy,Mad_Murkin,3,Sun Jul 19 19:38:48 2015 UTC,"If one summer league game is any indication, expect Exum to attack the rim more. He was advertised as a slashing guard before the draft. We didn't see much of it last year."
UtahJazz,3dv0iy,RobertLobLaw2,3,Sun Jul 19 20:18:30 2015 UTC,I think he's going to get a lot more offensive looks. I also think his shooting % is going to drop because Jazz management will tell him to be aggressive.
UtahJazz,3dv0iy,trippyimagez,3,Sun Jul 19 21:18:43 2015 UTC,his shooting % was only 35 last season..... i think it should rise if he starts taking it to the hole

UtahJazz,3dv0iy,bumbleb333,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:51 2015 UTC,I'd like him to get around the 8-10 points per game mark in his first full season as a starter.

Well I can see why you aren't used to looking up so high."" We all laughed.  Good guy."
UtahJazz,3dlai8,tatatatyler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:09:00 2015 UTC,I met thurl bailey so many times at Jazz games. This one time I went with my jr jazz team and we got there early and we were dicking off in the lower bowl and bugging the camera guys to let us play with the cameras (which they did).  And I remember Thurl just sitting alone about half way down all by himself just taking in the view. I knew who he was and I went down to chat with him and got a quick autograph with my buddies.

UtahJazz,3dlai8,j_ray,2,Sun Jul 19 04:46:46 2015 UTC,"In 1999 my family traveled from Missouri to Denver to see my first Utah Jazz basketball game. When I was in the mall next to the hotel the Jazz were staying at, I ran into Scott Padgett. I didn't have anything for him to sign, but he promised me he'd find me at the game and sign a basketball card I brought.   Before heading into the locker room after warmups, he searched me out in the group of kids waiting for players to sign stuff, and didn't sign anyone else's stuff before signing my card. As a 10 year old, Scott easily became one of my favorite players on that roster."
UtahJazz,3dlai8,6_ft_4,5,Fri Jul 17 14:46:01 2015 UTC,"We sat 1st row right underneath the basket for Jazz vs. Rockets game(in Houston). I believe it was the same year John hit the 3 to send the Jazz to the finals.  During warmups, Greg Foster came over and talked to us, I'm guessing because we were sporting our Jazz gear. He ended up taking some candy from one of the photographers. He was laughing and seemed like a good dude.  During that same game, my Dad got on Barkleys nerves enough that he stopped mid play and stared down my Dad. Good times. (I also went to school with Chris Morris' son down in the Houston area.)"

He was there with his kids picking out a dog or something. I didn’t want to bother him but I couldn’t stop sneaking peaks at him. He must have picked up on that and when he was walked past me he came up and talked to me for a second. I was wearing a Texas Rangers hat and he asked me ""what do you know about the Texas Rangers?” I was dumb founded so just said, ""I dunno"", then he shook my hand and said ""well my names Karl, nice to meet you"" and walked away."

To cope with the loss, I blasted MJ music everywhere I drove for the whole week. This was in high school and I was driving this magnificent bastard. As I was leaving, I had my windows down with music at full blast and I pull up to a guy in either a Ferrari or Lamborghini. Well it was Deron, and he just looked over at me and gave me a dirty look, shook his head and drove off.   Also have seen Deron around at Greek City Grill a few times (get the D-Will special there it is fucking dope)."

UtahJazz,3dfgoq,Benfranklinballs,12,Thu Jul 16 00:05:46 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe that the edge Rudy has brought to the Jazz has been a game changer. His work ethic and his defense are going to make him an all star, but his edge is going to make our team a winning team. The culture has been developing and we've had the right character guys in place, but there was no edge to turn us into winners. Rudy has brought that."
UtahJazz,3dfgoq,jwinskowski,8,Thu Jul 16 02:30:44 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure what edge is in this context but this comment got me hyped as hell regardless
UtahJazz,3dfgoq,crystal_beachhouse,3,Thu Jul 16 03:40:50 2015 UTC,"By ""edge"" I mean the combination of swagger, attitude, aggression, etc. Literally no one on our team has had that from the time Earl Watson left. Alec has a certain ""swag,"" Gordon has game but no one has had an edge.  For example, a couple of years ago Gordon was at the free throw line getting ready to shoot and JJ Barea went out of his way to cross right in front of Gordon, pausing as he went. No one did anything about it and Gordon went on to miss the first free throw. Or when Wiggins dunked on Rudy and then flexed, any of our other guys would've blocked Wiggins later in the game and then just gotten out on the fast break. Not Rudy. Rudy stepped right over Wiggins and flexed back. He doesn't just want to ""play the game the right way."" He wants to win. That's the edge our team needs."

UtahJazz,3dcifu,RSNLachy,7,Wed Jul 15 04:59:13 2015 UTC,"Considering he went directly from playing in Australia to playing in the NBA, I think he did fine."
UtahJazz,3dcifu,Galaxyrain,3,Wed Jul 15 13:56:19 2015 UTC,"He showed flashes of his ability, but was overall very raw, which is to be expected from a 19 year old coming from playing high school ball in Australia. He had a lot of improvement after the All-Star Break, mostly on the defensive end of the court, where he was very good at disrupting the game of opposing guards. He's got the physical tools and the ability, and if he learns to be more aggressive on offense this season, he's got a very high ceiling indeed."
UtahJazz,3dcifu,josefmilo95,3,Wed Jul 15 07:16:03 2015 UTC,"objectively, he was pretty awful. But I think most of us are taking into account his age, experience, size, flashes of brilliance, etc. into account and believe he will be something. I'm not sure where he'll end up, but I still think he has high potential."
UtahJazz,3dcifu,benwalker14,2,Wed Jul 15 15:33:06 2015 UTC,I Think he will be a solid starter. has the potential to be an all star if he improves his offensive game. was way too passive last season. has a quick first step but was too scared to drive to the rim. he played like ray allen most of the time

UtahJazz,3d71o2,jwbt123,6,Tue Jul 14 00:52:25 2015 UTC,O'Brien and Cunningham have serious potential if given time to develop.   And Hanlan deserves more playing time. He can score. Efficient passer. Runs the court well. Would love to see him out there without Cotton.  Edit: Brock Motum out there BALLIN
UtahJazz,3d71o2,cristianbernal,6,Tue Jul 14 04:18:44 2015 UTC,Id never thought I'd see a Motum heat check.
UtahJazz,3d71o2,cristianbernal,6,Tue Jul 14 04:31:55 2015 UTC,Literally laughed out loud when he did that. But honestly this doesn't even seem fair for Hanlan vs Johnson/Cotton. He's not being given ANY time to compete.
UtahJazz,3d71o2,zfox,6,Tue Jul 14 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, I feel like Hanlan is clearly a step behind Johnson/Cotton, one of whom will likely end up making the team. I think Hanlan is a good prospect, though, and really hope we can hang on to his rights."
UtahJazz,3d71o2,cristianbernal,3,Tue Jul 14 04:48:28 2015 UTC,"Obviously he's a step behind from them, but what are they going to see from Cotton that they haven't so far?  But this is the summer league... let the man have his fair share of minutes. He played the least of all jazzmen besides jajuan johnson who got injured."
UtahJazz,3d71o2,zfox,3,Tue Jul 14 04:53:21 2015 UTC,"He got 17 mins/game in Utah and had 14.5 mins/game in two games in Las Vegas so far, more than Cunningham and about the same as O'Brien. I mean, he probably should be getting more like 20 mins/game, but that's not too far from what he's getting."
UtahJazz,3d71o2,StocktonToMalone,2,Tue Jul 14 05:02:12 2015 UTC,And so far he hasn't done much with the time he's been given. But he's at least looked a little better in Vegas as compared to the games in Utah
UtahJazz,3d71o2,jwinskowski,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:12:37 2015 UTC,"I actually think he looked MUCH better last night than the previous nights. Scoring when he had a good look, driving and kicking. He looked great."

And Exum IS NOT a SG. He is a PG through and through. Trading for Lawson just takes his minutes away from him.   The Jazz have said pretty much from the beginning of free agency that they are going with what they got. I see no reason to get rid one of our best players (Burks) for a guy who might not even stay, or will just get overtaken in a year or two.   We're not the Nets. We're not going to go out and wheel and deal just to get into the playoffs.  This trade would hurt us in the long run.   Plus he just got arrested again on a suspected DUI. The Millers won't want someone with that kind of record."

UtahJazz,3dan4g,DokerinZion,5,Tue Jul 14 22:52:31 2015 UTC,He's cancerous. No thank you. I wouldn't give up anyone on our roster for him. Giving up only Trey Burke let alone Alec Burks too would be overpaying at this point.

UtahJazz,3d3pac,RGiss,13,Mon Jul 13 07:20:47 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it.  When OKC starts the season giving up 120 every game and loses, /r/nba will go full blown Fuck Kanter again.  You guys were playing so much better without him.  Dude is prime example of empty stats."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,Magnificent614,5,Mon Jul 13 08:11:22 2015 UTC,"the emptiest stats. also OKC was ahead of NOP last year, injuries notwithstanding, when they traded for kanter.  2 months later, they were outside looking in just like us. so for everyone who thinks the 18/10 he averaged for 30 games is going to be a great positive for the thunder, lets remember that he did not help them win last year. with durant back his offensive touches will go down so he wont be scoring 18ppg, and he still wont be helping them win.  all for a tidy 17.5m a year.   if enes kanter does well, great, good for him. but these people who never heard of kanter and now think hes a good young big man need to respect the fact that we've (jazz fans) watched him play a large sample size of NBA basketball, and he got traded because he sucks too much for his pricetag NOT because he talked shit. he talked shit because the writing was on the wall.  that writing was: ""hey man, we're going to pay rudy all that money, so if you dont want to come back for a 12m/year deal, then you wont be coming back at all."""
UtahJazz,3d3pac,chrimewave,-3,Mon Jul 13 19:55:35 2015 UTC,OKC has a better record last year since Kanter trade than before Kanter trade. This is without KD and much of Ibaka.
UtahJazz,3d3pac,Clawedd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:44:51 2015 UTC,"the statement was that OKC was in the 8th seed before kanter (they were), with him they dropped out of the playoffs (they did, on the last game of the season). of course it was without durant, with durant they will make the playoffs regardless, becuase kevin is really good"
UtahJazz,3d3pac,chrimewave,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:54:05 2015 UTC,So Kanter is getting blame for injuries and Pelicans playing good? Why mention OKC went down a seed?
UtahJazz,3d3pac,Clawedd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"what is so confusing? the thunder, without KD for much of the season, were in the playoffs when they acquired kanter.  at the end of the season, still without KD, were not in the playoffs."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,chrimewave,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:02:16 2015 UTC,"Nothing is confusing for me. You are the one confused. You stated Kanter put up empty stats that didn't help get wins. They won, just not enough to overcome KD's injury and Pelicans winning."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,Clawedd,4,Tue Jul 14 17:34:50 2015 UTC,"KD was injured before and after kanter, so his presence is irrelevant to this comparison.  this is the only comparison that is being made, ill make it very simple since its still causing you trouble.  timeline:   OKC in Playoff seed ---> OKC acquires Kanter ---> OKC out of playoff seed"
UtahJazz,3d3pac,chrimewave,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"Don't worry it isn't causing any trouble for me. You on the other hand seemingly cannot understand something very simple. YOU said Kanter put up empty stats that didn't translate to wins. I will make it so simple even such as yourself can understand don't worry.  OKC winning rate ---> OKC acquires Kanter ---> OKC has a higher win rate (even without Durant and much Ibaka)  Your claim that OKC lost a playoff seed after acquiring Kanter is true. However, you said as Kanter put up empty stats that didn't lead to wins. This is false."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,Clawedd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:44:53 2015 UTC,yes
UtahJazz,3d3pac,chrimewave,6,Tue Jul 14 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"Yup. We had the opportunity to watch Kanter for 3 and a half years and I can tell you it was few and far between that I thought ""Damn, Kanter really held this game together with those points""."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,sithlordmoore,2,Mon Jul 13 16:56:12 2015 UTC,614? Is Columbus in the house??
UtahJazz,3d3pac,Trinityliger,9,Mon Jul 13 18:32:06 2015 UTC,"I've never seen a player described as ""only 23"" more than Kanter has. This will be his fifth year in the league, but OKC fans seem to think he's coming off his rookie year. Sure, I'd love to see Jimmer suddenly be good at defense too, but we know what he is at this point.   OKC will be a solid playoff team with (healthy) Durant, Westbrook, and Ibaka no matter what, but giving Kanter $17 million & 35 mpg will keep them from contending."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,ThisIsAMormon,5,Mon Jul 13 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"The one that kills me is everyone calling him a 20-10 guy. He's never averaged that in his career. He came close to those stats in OKC but he'll be in a different situation next year with Durant and Ibaka returning. Kanter won't be getting as many touches, his ppg will drop and he will have to battle Ibaka for the rebounds which will drop his average closer to what it was when he played with Favors."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,RobertLobLaw2,0,Mon Jul 13 18:21:52 2015 UTC,18.6-11 isn't that far off from 20-10 especially considering he doesn't play 36 minutes.
UtahJazz,3d3pac,Clawedd,7,Tue Jul 14 07:43:30 2015 UTC,"2 things: I know this is probably crapposting, but I really wanted to show how people really changed their opinions of him simple because of the team change. And I put a lot into finding all of this. And the second is that I accidentally put the album backwards in order, but you can read it from bottom to top."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,Skiptoomylou,8,Mon Jul 13 07:23:42 2015 UTC,"I logged in to comment on this. Kanter is the ideal stat guy and is one of the major reasons why stats which can be useful can also be very misleading. Have you ever played pick up ball and there is always that one guy that shoots a lot. He won't play much d and doesn't pass at all? But on your way to 21 he scored like 8 points. On paper he seems like a strong player, like he was the key to victory. But then you take a second to review the game and you realize the real key to victory was that one guy who rebounded the ball 5 times. That same guy stopped his player from scoring 7 times. And scored 3 times.  Here is my point what is money worth in the NBA? Winning. That is it. Enes Kanter is not a winner. He is that guy during a game of pick up that just wants to jack shots, get the credit and move on."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,jwinskowski,7,Mon Jul 13 16:11:42 2015 UTC,"I actually think this is really interesting, so thank you! I couldn't imagine anything sweeter than Enes making OKC miss the playoffs after people attack him relentlessly in the pick and roll. It's possible that Durant and Westbrook are just so good that it won't matter how bad Enes is, but we'll see. And I hope Utah just kills it this year and gets everyone talking about how great it was for us to let Enes go."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,EggoSlayer,4,Mon Jul 13 14:16:29 2015 UTC,I just can't believe he got paid that much.  Boy am I glad we aren't saddled with that ridiculous contract.
UtahJazz,3d3pac,MalbecApologist,8,Mon Jul 13 21:43:20 2015 UTC,"What's lost in all of this is Portland absolutely fucking with another team in division with regards to salary.  They did it to the Jazz twice, now it's OKC's turn.  The Blazers' FO seems to live for this kind of shit."
UtahJazz,3d3pac,frozengash,3,Mon Jul 13 16:14:29 2015 UTC,Not everyone has actually watched him play.  They must see 20/10
UtahJazz,3d3pac,chrimewave,3,Tue Jul 14 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"lol i just went to OKC's subreddit, those guys are excited about kanter. i was going to comment, but theyve already heard all of kanter's negatives before, they are going to have to see it for themselves I'm afraid.  the types of comments that make my scoff the most is ""well with Ibaka beside him"" or ""if he had a good coach he'd be better""  favors and gobert are both > ibaka for rim protection, and id be surprised if billy donovan is as good of a coach as quin.   the thing is, even if the thunder DO have a middle defense with kanter, some people will point to kanter as not dragging them down--when I'd say they would be a top defense without him. we saw it last year on the jazz.  this season is going to be sooooo awesome i cant wait"
UtahJazz,3d3pac,DaBear405,0,Mon Jul 13 23:57:10 2015 UTC,You think gobert is a better rim protector than Ibaka? Lol

UtahJazz,3d1the,DunkteExum,3,Mon Jul 13 09:01:37 2015 UTC,I think he'll just keep improving as he fills out and gets more confident. His jump shot looks a ton better from last year and he's much more aggressive getting to the rim  (at least in the one summer league game he played). I expect big things from him in the next couple years! He's so gifted athletically and has a really good basketball iq so I really can see him doing some good shit. He's already a top notch defender and he can only get better from here
UtahJazz,3d1the,zna0,3,Sun Jul 12 22:34:32 2015 UTC,"He played 82 games and had a winning record as a starter for half the year, as a teenager. He obviously needs to continue developing, but he proved himself defensively, and proved he can play in the nba. Ill take that for year 1."
UtahJazz,3d1the,chrimewave,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:44:59 2015 UTC,"Happy Birthday Dante! Its like you said, he has proven that he can play defense, and with that skill you will stick in the NBA. I want to see how he develops as a passer more than anything! That will prove whether or not he can play PG."
UtahJazz,3d1qts,bso,2,Sun Jul 12 20:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this was mentioned on draft night.    I'm preeetty sure Hanlan won't see the NBA court this year, at least with the Jazz, considering Utah has 5 point guards on the roster, and he's the oddest man out."

UtahJazz,3czoi0,jwinskowski,17,Sun Jul 12 06:14:05 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing I've noticed is the attitude that started at the top and has run through the entire organization. This is summer league, we have a team of guys that won't be playing with each other in two weeks. These are guys who need to stand out to make an NBA roster. They're playing as a team, they're making that extra pass to get a better shot. The most exciting thing that I'm seeing is that these guys are out there to win at all costs. Losing is no longer acceptable. These guys make no excuses. Hood and Exum are out and the whole team feels like they should still win. This is summer league, wins don't really matter. Winning is now the culture of the team and it has trickled all the way down to the guys that only have a brief association with the Jazz."
UtahJazz,3czoi0,RobertLobLaw2,15,Sun Jul 12 16:11:05 2015 UTC,"What I have seen: Cotton is a really solid player, and to be perfectly honest, I'd rather take a chance with him than Hanlan. Cooley can be a very solid 13th-15th man for this team because the dude absolutely works. Trey Lyles has a great basis of fundamentals, and if he can execute, he'll be a good player. And of course, the internal development of Exum and Hood is the best off season acquisition we could ask for.   What I'm hoping to learn: Who makes the final roster, because there is some serious competition for the 10th-15th spots on the roster. Is there more to Lyle's game then we've seen? And overall, what Ex and Rodney could do in a few more games against this level of competition."
UtahJazz,3czoi0,josefmilo95,3,Sun Jul 12 06:52:36 2015 UTC,"It honestly pains me to see Cotton doing so well. Such fierce competition at the point guard spot. I can guarantee you won't see Cotton, Exum, and Burke on the roster at the beginning of the season, some other team is going to land a solid point guard in cotton and I hate to watch another Jazz developed player take his talents elsewhere. :("
UtahJazz,3czoi0,chasefrog,3,Sun Jul 12 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"It's definitely going to be Exum, Burke, and Neto on opening day, but I believe we'll send either Cotton or Hanlan to the D-League, and waive the one we don't send. I know Hanlan is a rookie, but I'd much rather keep a hold of Cotton and let Hanlan go."
UtahJazz,3czoi0,josefmilo95,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:04:13 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. Wouldn't be too butt hurt over losing Hanlan. Bryce Cotton has definitely proven he's got alot going for him and I'd hate to see him on another team.
UtahJazz,3czoi0,chasefrog,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:55:22 2015 UTC,"Just like everyone I'm impressed by Hood, Exum, Cotton and Cooley, but also JaJuan Johnson.

I know he used to play for the Stampede and as there is obviously no place on him in Utah Im kind of hoping he gets signed to our D-League team, again now that we own them."

UtahJazz,3cyb18,bumbleb333,5,Sat Jul 11 22:00:00 2015 UTC,"People look at goberts stats and highlights but dont truly understand how much of an impact he actually makes. I feel safe when rudy is out there, even if we arent shooting well its ok because they wont be able to score either. Then with rudy resting everything feels a but more vulnerable.   Also people that think hes a lump offensively..um nope, hes a great lob target, good hands, lightning quick to the rim, good enough ft shooter, strong instincts as a passer and a very willing passer. He doesnt create much offense on his own or space the floor, yet, but for some reason people are under this impression that gobert is a good defender and terrible offensive player, which i strongly disagree with."

UtahJazz,3ctesf,chargon,2,Fri Jul 10 19:09:30 2015 UTC,He is very coordinated for a big man. I was worried about his ability to see anything that didn't result in a shot for himself but at crunch time he gave it up for the Cooley dunk. I think Lyles will be a damn good team player.
UtahJazz,3ctesf,RobertLobLaw2,3,Sat Jul 11 00:21:22 2015 UTC,Glad to see this as I couldn't watch the game. I'm excited about Trey and think that he fits the Jazz's identity very well.
UtahJazz,3ctesf,Sex-Haver,3,Fri Jul 10 19:22:03 2015 UTC,He missed a few of the same shots he was taking. They were all on line and a couple were just in and out. His stroke looks like it's really nice from midrange already.

UtahJazz,3cr8fj,Mrgreenfield,12,Fri Jul 10 03:14:51 2015 UTC,"Really liked what I saw from Lyles. Didn't hit most shots, but didn't hesitate (apart from one shot). Can tell he is awfully skilled already, and the fact he is mobile and versatile might cause problem for big men. I would have liked to see a little more from him defensively. But he has had two practices, so I'll give him a pass.   Cotton is now one of my favorite players. With Neto signing a guaranteed contract, it looks like he is on his way out. I hope he lands on a team.   I love our fans. They are so awesome. It did not feel like a summer league game near the end there. It was to the point where I was feeling nervous about the result. During a summer league game.   I can't wait for Vegas in two days."
UtahJazz,3cr8fj,jwbt123,6,Fri Jul 10 03:26:38 2015 UTC,"I feel ashamed that I was so upset at picking Lyles over Booker. He looked so damn versatile tonight, and can only imagine it will get better while working with Quin."
UtahJazz,3cr8fj,StocktonToMalone,3,Fri Jul 10 05:43:53 2015 UTC,"I also got really nervous near the end there.   The way Cotton played really won me over. This is the only one of the summer games I got to be at and he just seemed really confident out there. I'll be bummed if he goes.   Also really enjoyed Lyle's play. Those two were definitely standouts for me. Like you said, wasn't shooting the best, but you can see that there's a ton of potential."
UtahJazz,3cr8fj,president_truman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:30:57 2015 UTC,"It's too bad about Cotton - the guy has tremendous heart, he's crazy fast, no fear of the big moment.  He's got some serious skills too.  I think he could be a great backup PG somewhere."
UtahJazz,3cr8fj,senorpuerco,8,Fri Jul 10 16:49:10 2015 UTC,"Thoughts on the players  Okafor is gonna be fun to watch for whatever team hes on. That dude does whatever he wants in the post. He holds the ball like its a damn tennis ball.  Hanlan strikes me as flat out bad... Really dont like his game... Lots of mistakes, doesnt know when to keep and when to pass... Not sure how he will fit into the jazz this year. Correct me if im wrong though because i havent seen the other games.  Lyles is pretty sweet man. I liked those jumpers a lot. Makes me hopeful. Those foul draws... I like em. Theyre ugly and smart. Smart game is good game. Also had some nice passes to the lane, love it  Cotton is still fun to watch. That dunk on the fast break was too good. Hes also better defensively than i thought, maybe slower competition though. Fuckin made two in a row in the clutch in OT.  Jack cooley to me is the perfect third string guy. Can defend the post for days , dude is tough. Cant set a pick for his fckin life though lol, didnt box shit out either. But he rebounded well regardless."
UtahJazz,3cr8fj,wince84,9,Fri Jul 10 03:16:34 2015 UTC,For Lyles to have that pump fake to draw contact move at 6 ft 10 and 19 years old is pretty remarkable. Looking forward to seeing more in Vegas.

UtahJazz,3cr8fj,senorpuerco,3,Fri Jul 10 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"I'll say this about Okafor, from what I saw in the first half, he looked like he was mailing in his rebound attempts and didn't want to mess with any defensive presence that had any ""bulk"" to it. It's possible that those are both products of a fairly meaningless summer league match, but something to think about."
UtahJazz,3cr8fj,RGiss,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:30:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he seemed fairly uninterested in the game except for a couple times when he really put his head down and tried to do something."
UtahJazz,3cr8fj,Jpro124,2,Fri Jul 10 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"My thoughts: Okafor was really good, but was extremely bad on the clutch. Fumbled it away it seemed like every possession.  Hanlan won't really play for us, at least this season. He's a guaranteed Idaho player In my opinion. Lyles, Cotton, and Cooley really impressed me. Hopefully some how some way we can get Cotton next year."

I am kinda sad that we're not going to be able to keep both Cotton and Burke. With Neto signing like it was said earlier there's no way to keep 4 pg. Maybe we can have some trade bait come preseason."
UtahJazz,3cr8fj,president_truman,5,Fri Jul 10 05:22:28 2015 UTC,"If he hits that jumper consistently, Lyles could be deadly. Big men will have to respect that jumper, but also watch for that drive. It might be a huge blessing for him to have played the 3 in Kentucky last year."
UtahJazz,3cr8fj,jstrokos,2,Fri Jul 10 04:21:54 2015 UTC,Seriously if his shooting had been a little more consistent he would have dominated this game. It felt like he created a lot of looks for himself and he moves around the court really well.

UtahJazz,3cquzm,rodeobot,7,Fri Jul 10 04:11:30 2015 UTC,Burke as a backup PG isn't a doomsday scenario.  I honestly think it could be pretty good long term.

UtahJazz,3cprxw,DaBear405,8,Thu Jul 9 21:56:51 2015 UTC,This is such a win-win for us. Portland signing him wouldn't help them win games they would basically be a poor man's Nash era Suns. OKC matches they're gonna be handcuffed pretty bad with all their upcoming FA.
UtahJazz,3cprxw,dareman86,12,Thu Jul 9 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"huge win either way. both teams are in our division, whoever doesn't blink will be saddled with a really really troublesome contract for a guy who doesnt want to play defense.  im hoping OKC signs him, they will be way over the cap and wont be able to sign ANY new free agents at all, leading to durant and westbrook walking"
UtahJazz,3cprxw,DaBear405,4,Thu Jul 9 20:49:57 2015 UTC,"wont be able to sign ANY new free agents at all,   That is just not true lol"

UtahJazz,3cprxw,wallitron,2,Thu Jul 9 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"it is, you cant sign free agents if you are over the salary cap. you can only re-sign players. or let contracts expire to free space.  you cant go over the cap to sign a player that you do not own the bird rights of"
UtahJazz,3cprxw,DaBear405,3,Thu Jul 9 23:36:09 2015 UTC,"A team can use the MLE and mini MLE to sign players and they can also work out sign & trades. Also OKC is not ridiculously over the cap. Especially after they dump Novaks and PJ3 salary. And teams can always use minimum contracts no matter what your salary cap situation is. So again, your statement is false."
UtahJazz,3cprxw,jwinskowski,3,Thu Jul 9 23:41:44 2015 UTC,"the E in MLE stands for ""exception""  yes there are exceptions to the rule."
UtahJazz,3cprxw,RobertLobLaw2,-3,Thu Jul 9 23:43:19 2015 UTC,Lol really? You just get proven wrong so you start arguing semantics? Okay buddy lol.  And PS even with out the exception teams can still sign players to the minimum much like the Spurs and Heat are doing. So still wrong.
UtahJazz,3cprxw,frozengash,3,Thu Jul 9 23:45:19 2015 UTC,"I'm with the OKC guy on this one, the entire MO of the Heat during their championship run was three max players and signing free agents while over the cap. This is a tried and tested way to build a championship team. The Cavs are so far over the cap it is rediculous. Teams making a run just don't care.  The Spurs aren't in this boat yet, they are still bringing in players under the cap. It won't be until they ink Leonard and Green to their new contracts that they go over. The Spurs MO has never been to bring in vet mins, it's always to buy low and sell high."

Just develop internally and when it gets to the point where a title is almost in reach, then maybe go after a big name free agent.   I love this team right now though"
UtahJazz,3cpkpm,BabyS1othWithA1,2,Thu Jul 9 19:27:58 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. We made the most of a limited roster last year, developing Rodney and Dante, discovering Joe's jack-of-all trades ability and Rudy's potential for dominance. This year we get Alec back, add Lyles, and actually sign our foreign players? I'm SO excited for the season!"
UtahJazz,3cpkpm,jwinskowski,7,Fri Jul 10 04:19:47 2015 UTC,"Overall, I'm extremely happy with this group.  I didn't want the Jazz spending big money, and shaking things up just because they could.   Most of the roster will be around 24 years old next year, so another season of development should be just what we need.    As for the roster-- it's up to 18 guys already.  I'm guessing all un-guaranteed contracts are cut, except maybe Millsap.  Wouldn't mind Burke and Jerrett being traded away."
UtahJazz,3cpkpm,YerWelcomeAmerica,8,Thu Jul 9 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's way, way too early to get rid of Burke. He had an inefficient sophomore season, lets give him a chance and see how he develops over the next couple seasons.  I don't get how trigger-happy a lot of Jazz fans are. Everyone was complaining about how awful Hayward was in the previous season and whined about his contract, but look at the leap he took this season.  I'm not saying Burke is going to be a superstar, but he was just inconsistent last season. He had some wretched shooting games but he also had games where he was the only player on the roster that could put up some points when we needed them."
UtahJazz,3cpkpm,YerWelcomeAmerica,5,Thu Jul 9 19:41:03 2015 UTC,"I'm really not as low on Burke as most Jazz fans are, I just think he's the most expendable of our core players.  I mentioned trading in the OP, so I listed the only two players I wouldn't mind seeing traded away.  I wouldn't mind if Burke stuck around at all."
UtahJazz,3cpkpm,Packattack622,3,Thu Jul 9 19:47:07 2015 UTC,"Xsy, I gotta apologize. I have this annoying habit where I read a comment that kind of goes along with a general theme and I reply with my thoughts about that in a generalized way, but of course since a reply is to a specific post it makes it look like I'm referring to the OP directly.

The wailing and gnashing of teeth when Hayward got a max contract...  Anyway, completely anecdotal obviously, but I saw plenty of people that were upset we signed Hayward for a max instead of letting him walk, since he ""clearly wasn't worth it"". I didn't understand it then (especially given the Jazz cap situation at the time) and I don't understand it now with Burke and all the people (not referring to Xsy) wanting to cut him loose."

UtahJazz,3cpkpm,LlamaCombo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:10:26 2015 UTC,"It only looks that way because they went to the Eastern conference.  If Millsap or Korver stayed out west, they would probably never have all star appearances.  And Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer got worse."

UtahJazz,3cpkpm,Sex-Haver,5,Sat Jul 11 06:29:36 2015 UTC,With Pleiss we now have the Stifle Tower and the Berlin Wall.  We might be the tallest team in the league.  Neto is elite levels of sexy.  I'm talking like top 5-10 in the league.  Pink jersey sales are going through the roof this year.  Booker and Ingles will actually get minutes.  I'm glad they're back.  The Jazz FO have only made solid moves this offseason.  A+

UtahJazz,3cp3js,jwinskowski,5,Thu Jul 9 17:12:51 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this report is correct, because I fell in love with Neto during summer league 2 years ago. Tremendous passer, and hopefully Quin can teach him to have a sort-of threatening jumper. I think he'll be a solid 3rd string or backup."
UtahJazz,3cp3js,RGiss,3,Thu Jul 9 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"I see Quin teaching him how/when to put up a nice floater or lay the ball in once he's broken down the defense. Has a very Nash-type ability to get into the paint and keep his dribble alive, completely breaking down the defense. If we can somehow surround him with shooters, he could get them the ball."
UtahJazz,3cp3js,TweetPoster,3,Thu Jul 9 17:37:28 2015 UTC,Looks like the dominos are starting to fall...
UtahJazz,3cp6sv,RGiss,3,Thu Jul 9 17:35:35 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty good to me.  I have the Spurs and Timberwolves higher, and the Mavs lower (I think they will end up tanking).  I'd love to get into the playoffs this year - let the guys get some playoff experience under their belts!"
UtahJazz,3cp6sv,senorpuerco,3,Thu Jul 9 19:05:40 2015 UTC,"I think we have a chance to even jump the Pelicans. We were a better team than they were after the Kanter trade. Anthony Davis will get better, but our ENTIRE team will be getting better. I think we can ump them if we start the season off well"
UtahJazz,3cp6sv,Redhot128,3,Thu Jul 9 19:05:42 2015 UTC,"Pelicans will also have Jrue Holiday back for the whole season and a few more, plus Gentry will install an offense that makes better use of The Brow.  I like where the Jazz are headed, but I don't see us jumping the Pelicans."
UtahJazz,3cp6sv,A_Gruff_Goat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:31:44 2015 UTC,"I'd be careful saying Jrue Holiday will be back for a full season. He's missed significant time like every year since he's left Philly. And I liked the Gentry signing, but that doesn't really address their problems. They already had a solid offense. It's their defense that is awful (22nd in the league). Until they can figure out why a frontcourt of Omer Asik and Anthony Davis is allowing so many points at the rim, there is a real chance that the Jazz can leapfrog them. Of course, this is all just my opinion, and I've been wrong before. I just think it is more likely than some people realize"

UtahJazz,3cp6sv,Xsy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:33:44 2015 UTC,With lack of shooting and Burks just coming back I think we are still a year out of the playoffs. Not to mention seeing how much Dante progresses and if Pliess can give us scoring off the bench. Lot of factors that give us a lock
UtahJazz,3cp6sv,JazzFan418,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:12:23 2015 UTC,"And I can definitely see where you are coming from, but we won 38 games last year. And we ended 19-10 without burks. Of course, that could've just been a fluke, but I seriously don't think it is."

UtahJazz,3cnhi5,jwinskowski,6,Thu Jul 9 07:25:41 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of us (myself included) have forgotten just how good Trey Burke can be, especially as a backup point guard! Between the excitement around Dante, Trey's shooting woes (not all his fault, since he got the ball dumped off to him at the end of a shot clock WAY too much,) the fact that he was basically a Ty Corbin pick, and whatever other factors, a lot of us have just started looking at Trey as a trade chip/throwaway guy.  After taking a few minutes to check out his highlights from last season, I was impressed at a lot of the plays he made! Plenty of room to improve on the defensive end, of course, but could really be a great part of our second unit!"
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,j_ray,2,Thu Jul 9 07:29:19 2015 UTC,"Hands down, Trey was the best player in his draft class. We got pretty lucky trading for him."
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,sirmitchel,4,Thu Jul 9 16:48:56 2015 UTC,Gobert is the best of the class IMO.
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,fvertk,2,Thu Jul 9 20:54:45 2015 UTC,"Idk if I would say that, but considering we started the night with our highest pick being #14 I don't think it turned out too badly. (Greek freak went at #15, but there were a lot of question marks surrounding him and we needed a PG pretty badly, so ¯_(シ)_/¯.)"
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,seasonal_nudist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"Mmm, no way man. Victor Oladipo. Rudy Gobert. Nerlens Noel. Antetokounmpo. I mean, you could maybe make an argument for this early in his rookie season, but now all the potential guys in that draft are rising and Burke...isnt."
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,Xsy,7,Fri Jul 10 01:27:51 2015 UTC,That buzzer beater vs. the Knicks gives me chills in all the right places.
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,chrimewave,7,Thu Jul 9 07:40:10 2015 UTC,"Obviously he's not the guy we were hoping he'd be, but he's still a pro.  If he learns how to shoot again, he's a good backup."
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,Xsy,5,Thu Jul 9 08:05:37 2015 UTC,"If he learns to shoot again, hes a starter. Just probs not for the jazz"
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,Strongworks,2,Thu Jul 9 08:13:15 2015 UTC,"I think the same think. If he can excel in a backup role, suddenly he could become a player other teams (without an elite point guard) target as a starter."
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,somedudeinlosangeles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, though, who doesn't have an elite point guard at this point?  That position is deep.  Even if Burke learns to shoot, there's still not many teams who could use him as a starter."
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,trippyimagez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:41:13 2015 UTC,"I agree that there aren't a ton of teams badly lacking a PG, but the Knicks, Nets, and Heat could all foreseeably be interested. I'm hoping we can keep him, though. If he shoots even just ok, he'll be a solid backup for us."
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,trippyimagez,3,Thu Jul 9 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"Remember a few seasons ago when Hayward was forced to take late shot clock jumpers? Then he got some help and turned into Haygod. Does Trey get better if the second unit gets better? Apples to Oranges, maybe?"
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,fvertk,3,Thu Jul 9 14:37:43 2015 UTC,I am not and I still support the kid but he regressed last year and if he wants my support he needs to play up to his potential this year.  I'll continue to support him until I don't.
UtahJazz,3cnhi5,devlspawn,2,Thu Jul 9 15:13:51 2015 UTC,Can a broken finger really fuck up your shot for that long? I mean I know its an excuse but literally he blew it up in SL and then broke his finger and now this.
UtahJazz,3cks53,chrimewave,21,Wed Jul 8 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"Do you guys remember two summers ago when we were unable to sign Gordon to his extension, and all of the drama about whether or not we were going to keep him? Some of you guys probably remember that there were quite a few Jazz fans, and I might be included in this, that thought we should trade Gordon because we had Alec. A lot of Jazz fans at the time thought that Alec had more potential than anyone on the team not named Favors. All year, he balled out coming off the bench. He was one of the best 6th men in the league, and was capable of lighting anybody up on a given night. Yeah, last year he may have been a little... underwhelming, but he was obviously hurt, and now that he's healthy, he should really show us all of the brilliance we expect from him. This guy is one of the craftiest players around the rim in the league. Can shoot it, defend when he is engaged, and can create for himself better than almost anybody in the league. Now that he has had a full year to actually heal, and learn about everything that is expected of him from Quin and the coaching staff, I really think he is going to be even better than we remember.   Last year at the trade deadline when we dumped Penis Cancer, a lot of people were saying that the best thing we got out of that trade was a hungry Rudy Gobert. Maybe this offseason has been relatively quiet in Swat Lake City, but people are forgetting that we are already adding a great player to our team. Last year after the Kanter trade, we were indisputably one of the best teams in the league. We were just missing reliable scorers. Now we are adding a player that we already know can score with the best of them when he gets rolling, and he can do it at any time. The guy's nickname is Houdini for a reason, and I can't wait to see what tricks he has up his sleeves that he's been saving for us when he blows the doors off of ESA.  This is the most I've been excited about this team since we went to the Western Conference Finals. And, call me crazy, but the team we have now has an even higher ceiling than that team did. As long as we keep developing our players, and focus on improving every year... Man. We are brewing something special here in Salt Lake City."
UtahJazz,3cks53,Redhot128,15,Wed Jul 8 18:51:48 2015 UTC,"i cant believe I was wavering about gordon haywards max deal, I wanted to keep him but I felt like it was an overpay, and considering we had burks I wasnt sure how I felt about maxing gordon.  now seeing these role players make more than gordon hayward, and a guy like chandler parsons is going to opt-out next year to doubledown on the cap increase and be making like 18-19mil a year...the jazz are so set up...so incredibly set up.  our arguably best player is on a fucking 27th pick ROOKIE deal. favs, hayward, burks are all locked into reasonable long term situations.  i cant believe how amazingly DL and QS have turned this shit around."
UtahJazz,3cks53,Redhot128,10,Wed Jul 8 19:19:49 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Our front office doesn't get nearly enough credit for how great they actually are. Maybe the moves they make aren't flashy, but they are always well thought out, and seem to be worth it in the long run. That's one of the reasons I had no problem with drafting Lyles. Our front office has shown that they clearly know what they are doing, and I have complete faith in them"
UtahJazz,3cks53,MalbecApologist,10,Wed Jul 8 19:45:15 2015 UTC,"And, call me crazy   Okay, Crazy.     We are brewing something special here in Salt Lake City.   Concur."
UtahJazz,3cks53,trippyimagez,5,Wed Jul 8 19:01:17 2015 UTC,This makes me wanna go argue with people over in r/nba... Lol I'm in love with our roster and if Lyles pans out I think that we will be contenders sooner than most people would think. Tbh I see us sliding easily into the 7-8 seed this year if we continue to play post All-Star break. The only depth we're really lacking is at SF... That is if we sign Pleiss.
UtahJazz,3cks53,jwinskowski,4,Wed Jul 8 22:04:19 2015 UTC,Rodney and Joe both have the ability to back up the 3...
UtahJazz,3cks53,trippyimagez,3,Wed Jul 8 22:48:41 2015 UTC,Yeah but is Joe really the guy you want being your second 3? Hood is going to be playing the 2 mostly behind Burks.
UtahJazz,3cks53,jwinskowski,5,Wed Jul 8 23:04:44 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily mind him being my 4th wing. 96 wing minutes per night, if Gordon plays 30 and Alec/Rodney play a combined 50, that's only 16 wing minutes to distribute between Joe/Elijah/whoever else."
UtahJazz,3cks53,abdishaquor,3,Thu Jul 9 00:01:13 2015 UTC,"He's not your second 3 he's your third.  Alec, Hood, and Hayward can split 96 minutes 3 ways.  32 minutes a night.  Joe only needs to get minutes when the matchups are right or when there are injuries.  So he's third string."
UtahJazz,3cks53,RobertLobLaw2,13,Thu Jul 9 00:43:33 2015 UTC,Alec Burks might be the most underrated player in the league. He's going to break out this year. His government name will be known by fans of other teams.
UtahJazz,3cks53,Sex-Haver,6,Wed Jul 8 18:23:05 2015 UTC,Just hope we don't have to hear HOUDINI 10 times a game.

UtahJazz,3cks53,MalbecApologist,11,Thu Jul 9 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"That man understands what ""attack the rim"" means better than anyone else on the team.  If he's developing a pull-up shot to go with it, the rest of the NBA is gonna have a bad time."

UtahJazz,3cks53,krutoypotsan,3,Wed Jul 8 23:51:26 2015 UTC,"Omg I have to admit I had forgotten just how special of a skill he has for getting to the rim. Seriously, if he can become a 3pt threat to the point where defenses have to close out on him hard, he can be so dangerous getting to the basket...like 25 puts a  night dangerous."
UtahJazz,3cks53,RobertLobLaw2,6,Thu Jul 9 04:12:45 2015 UTC,"I've read a lot of people saying that we're ""one piece away"", I really believe Burks is that piece."
UtahJazz,3cks53,jwbt123,6,Thu Jul 9 00:21:21 2015 UTC,"It cracked me up last year after the all-star break when people at r/nba kept saying ""Jazz just need a scoring guard"" like we don't already have one."
UtahJazz,3cks53,MalbecApologist,6,Thu Jul 9 02:14:04 2015 UTC,"We really have two, with hood."
UtahJazz,3clfi4,hugetiggaf13,9,Wed Jul 8 20:42:01 2015 UTC,Uh yeah I think he gets sent to D-league or never comes off the bench. If we sign Pleiss I don't see him coming into the rotation very much with Lyles there.
UtahJazz,3clfi4,trippyimagez,2,Wed Jul 8 22:07:03 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Pleiss comes over, but this is not accounting for it. It definitely would create a whole new scenario. From what I've seen of Cooley, he seems to be someone who will give you more effort and hustle than anyone else on the floor. He defends well, rebounds well, and there's a lot to like about his game."
UtahJazz,3clfi4,Popped_Tarts,2,Thu Jul 9 00:26:07 2015 UTC,Personally I see him taking on the Jeremy Evans role if we keep him around. It obviously depends on if Pleiss comes over but Cooley seems like a great energy/hustle/teammate guy that can give you 5 minutes when you need it.
UtahJazz,3clfi4,chrimewave,6,Thu Jul 9 01:01:21 2015 UTC,"can give you 6 fouls when you need it   This also.  Cooley is ok, but hes a big man who plays way below the rim, so his value will be hustle, screens, box outs"
UtahJazz,3clfi4,Popped_Tarts,2,Thu Jul 9 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree with you 100% there, he doesn't seem to know how to not foul people. I kind of enjoy it."
UtahJazz,3clfi4,zna0,3,Thu Jul 9 01:14:25 2015 UTC,"Watching him the other night at summer league i really feel like he should be signed...i think if given the chance he could be a poor man's draymond green. During warm ups i saw him draining 3's and mid range jumpers (never seen him take any in a game so maybe i'm wrong about his shooting ability) and can definitely bang down low and get boards as well as anyone. I think he's a good asset to have deep on the bench. He is basically the same size as Lyles (and more limited offensively) so maybe it doesn't make sense to keep him, but after watching him hustle so damn hard in SL i want to sign him"
UtahJazz,3clfi4,jwinskowski,3,Wed Jul 8 22:48:58 2015 UTC,"He can shoot, he just isn't asked to do it very often. He's a guy who knows his role and will do what the coach asks, which is another thing to love about him. He eats up space well, and I think if Pleiss comes over then it may leave Cooley without much playing time, but he can hold his own."
UtahJazz,3clfi4,chrimewave,3,Thu Jul 9 00:24:23 2015 UTC,"I gotta be honest, I am getting a little worn out with all of the Jack Cooley hype. I mean he's a cool dude I'm sure, but I don't ever see him being any higher than like the 12th guy on the roster, if that. Works hard, but that doesn't get you as far in the NBA as in the D League and Summer League.  Go Jazz"
UtahJazz,3clfi4,AlmightyBones,3,Thu Jul 9 03:38:12 2015 UTC,yeah i dont know why writers have seemed to focus on cooley in a few articles. hes a fine young man by all accounts..but will have a small impact on our team
UtahJazz,3clfi4,AlmightyBones,2,Thu Jul 9 07:20:39 2015 UTC,"You saw him in the Summer league, is he going to be doing that vs the players that are on teams?  He's a backup so he won't be playing many starters, but the take into account the competition hes playing against."
UtahJazz,3cj326,abdishaquor,3,Wed Jul 8 08:32:01 2015 UTC,Agreed
UtahJazz,3cj326,chrimewave,2,Wed Jul 8 15:29:48 2015 UTC,"Me too, but it makes Summer ball so much more fun to watch"
UtahJazz,3cj326,anonatitagain,3,Thu Jul 9 05:34:15 2015 UTC,Rodney Hood is quickly becoming an NBA stud.  Continued success to this kid.

UtahJazz,3cj326,Sex-Haver,0,Wed Jul 8 18:35:30 2015 UTC,Grant Hill is the player he reminds me most of.  Mostly because of how smooth and in control Grant Hill was all the time.
UtahJazz,3cj326,LawrenceOfTheLabia,3,Wed Jul 8 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yup. Let him play the last game just for the sake of it being in Utah, and then let him go home for Vegas."
UtahJazz,3cj326,Green_man_bitch,2,Wed Jul 8 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"Been admirer since ole miss, got overlooked in the draft but good situation in Utah. looks like he works well with Dante too."
UtahJazz,3cjkhi,jwinskowski,3,Wed Jul 8 12:21:58 2015 UTC,"I've seen a few people starting to get really ""jazzed up"" (terrible pun) about Raul Neto potentially coming to the Jazz. I've even seen people start to presume that a Neto signing means that Trey Burke would either be losing his spot or leaving completely.  This radio interview gives a lot of great insight into Raul as a player and what fans can - and should - expect from signing him.  In case you want to skip the interview, here is a tl;dr:   Neto's coach in Spain doesn't expect him back His court vision and passing are superb His shooting is atrocious. Not a threat to hit a jumper, and shot only 20% from 3 in limited attempts last season At the NBA level he's definitely not a starter, probably not a backup   What are your thoughts/expectations from a Neto signing?"
UtahJazz,3cjkhi,chrimewave,4,Wed Jul 8 12:31:36 2015 UTC,"i expect him to be worse than trey burke, to be perfectly honest with you. partly because burke will be in his 3rd year, and partly because I just think trey is a better player.  we'll see, at least we got a couple new guys now! if you count trey lyles signing"
UtahJazz,3cjkhi,josefmilo95,3,Wed Jul 8 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"I optimistically see him as our third string PG in a similar mold as we've used Jamaal Tinsley and Earl Watson in the past. A guy who's not on the court to shoot the ball, but to utilize his good passing and court vision."
UtahJazz,3cidpw,jwbt123,9,Wed Jul 8 03:37:12 2015 UTC,"So stop with all the ""Does he want to play here?"" talk."
UtahJazz,3cidpw,IAmJBear,4,Wed Jul 8 03:38:00 2015 UTC,So.. what exactly does this mean? This whole thing has been a little bit odd.
UtahJazz,3cidpw,IAmJBear,6,Wed Jul 8 04:32:04 2015 UTC,"It's Rich Paul, so he wants to get as much as possible. The annual salary amount was set, nothing they could do about it. 120% of the scale.   Paul was holding him out because he was negotiating minor shit, like a summer league bonus. Trey always wanted to sign, always intended to sign, but when you have an agent like Paul, you don't really say no to what he suggests.   He has a lot of power."
UtahJazz,3cidpw,jwinskowski,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:48:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I suppose I'm not opposed to guys getting paid. Thanks for the clarification, good to know that it wasn't Trey Lyles holding any of this up.  Let's see what he can do now."

UtahJazz,3cfs5h,RobertLobLaw2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"Burke obviously gets the highest return from a trade. Plus his 36/per is about the same as Neto's, but obviously Neto is doing that against sub-par Euro talent. Biggest strike to Burke, FG%, sub 40% is a killer."
UtahJazz,3cfs5h,Delex31,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:16:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Neto isn't much better of a shooter. In fact, he's not better at all.   Only 20% last season."

UtahJazz,3cdmhp,ronocyorlik,11,Tue Jul 7 03:05:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you can be more impressed with someone who scored just a few more points but was extremely less efficient.   I like smart, he has a amazing BBIQ. But, I think he tries too hard to show contact and will always be a flopper. He's very much like Christ Paul in that way. Fantastic player, doesn't need to do those things, but does them and will forever have the perception of being a flopper. I honestly think that the league is looking more and more at that and those players will get less and less calls."
UtahJazz,3cdmhp,pretzel_man,3,Tue Jul 7 03:10:19 2015 UTC,"Up-voted for truth. Exum was more efficient. I'm really, really encouraged by Exum's play today. Smart has confidence to spare, but, he isn't very efficient."
UtahJazz,3cdmhp,itryitryitry,-5,Tue Jul 7 05:11:45 2015 UTC,I wish we picked Smart. So much better defensively and a better leader - they are still both raw offensively but Smart looks 10x stronger driving. SMH

But If I had to chose one I would probably go with Hood. Might be a little recency bias because Burks missed out last season. But I couldn't be more pumped to have burks back! I think burks will start however.

UtahJazz,3cdzwi,jwinskowski,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:08:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's less of a question of who I like better and more of a question of who will fill which role. I could easily see Rodney starting so that Burks can add a scoring punch off the bench (where he'll get a lot more touches than playing with Gordon/Favors/Dante.) Heaven knows our bench needed someone to start the scoring for the second unit last year.  I also think Rodney could play that role, also. He's already shown an ability to create his own shot and handle the ball. Plus whoever is in the second unit will have Trey, Joe, and (hopefully) Booker to play with, so the floor spacing should be great 😎  Go Jazz!"

In the 13-14 season you could tell he had spent quite a lot of time improving his jump shot, and had a very serviceable mid-range game that kind of went unnoticed.   On top of that of course is the personality, which fit the Jazz organization very well, and he was such a nice guy and conducted himself professionally.

UtahJazz,3c9lcn,Loyfdnyrd,2,Mon Jul 6 12:21:07 2015 UTC,"No one at this point.  KJ would be our 4th best wing and we would add him and develop him in garbage time, practice, and when another wing is injured.  It's ok to have more players than you can play provided they don't have an overly inflated expectation of their role.  KJ didn't even play for the Rockets.

UtahJazz,3c8blo,LlamaCombo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:22:45 2015 UTC,"KG is one of the greatest players all time and he's very vocal about what he wants from his teammates when they play. He can help teach them how to play defense at a high level, he did win DPOY in 08."
UtahJazz,3c8blo,jwinskowski,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:49:52 2015 UTC,I'm not saying KG isn't a vet capable of leading a young group. I'm just seeing I haven't seen any signs that the team is making rapid strides thanks to his leadership...
UtahJazz,3c8blo,LlamaCombo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well he didn't get traded until the trade deadline, but all the young guys on that team seemed to speak very highly of him including Wiggins. I'd love to see how KG could mentor Towns."
UtahJazz,3c8blo,Tuchainzz,4,Mon Jul 6 21:55:44 2015 UTC,"I think DL and the Jazz are in a very unique situation with multiple young players who could pan out as stars. To me, they've CLEARLY decided to ride or die with them at least through this year to get a better gauge on what positions need to be upgraded in '16-'17.    It's so early for a lot of these kids that it'd be stupid to sign a veteran who could take 10-15 min away from potential development per game.  Play through this season, or gauge where we are at the deadline and take the cap flexibility into next season and have a much better idea of what we can upgrade.  You can't rush every rebuild, ask the Brooklyn Nets. The Jazz have been doing it the right way, and it might not get us to the playoffs this year but you can't sit there and say it isn't a fun team to watch."
UtahJazz,3c8blo,jwinskowski,2,Sun Jul 5 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see why fans would want a vet or two to help mentor the young guys, but at this point depth is the only reason I'd be interested in acquiring a ""vet."" I think that the team is more than happy to let Gordon, Derrick, Trevor, and Joe be the veterans/mentors on our team. And don't forget that coach Quin has a huge (and ever-growing) coaching staff that's responsible for helping the young guys grow. I expect this to be a great season with a lot of fun growth!"
UtahJazz,3c8blo,abdishaquor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"There is a middle road between having no vets and stunting player development for older players.  We need to be on that middle road.  Experience is a good thing that helps development, culture, as well as winning."
UtahJazz,3c8blo,fullmetalutes,-2,Mon Jul 6 19:25:09 2015 UTC,Somebody has a different opinion than you? Hopefully they burn in hell.
UtahJazz,3c8blo,Sex-Haver,2,Sun Jul 5 21:35:09 2015 UTC,He's just questioning the logic of trying to sign a bunch of veteran FAs that will take away from rookie development time. Is there any player other than LeBron that could take us far into the playoffs?  Why not let the young core develop some more and see what happens rather than panicking and trying to swing for the fences when we'll obviously miss.
UtahJazz,3c7ufs,jwbt123,9,Sun Jul 5 18:39:27 2015 UTC,Something is not right about this situation. I'm going to put my tin foil hat on and say that either Lyles doesn't want to play here and/or that we're working to trade him.
UtahJazz,3c7ufs,kqwin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:02:07 2015 UTC,Maybe it's both and we're trading him to Sacramento out of spite.

UtahJazz,3c7ufs,Tuchainzz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:09:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. A deal must be looming then.
UtahJazz,3c7ufs,pretzel_man,3,Mon Jul 6 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"This is kind of shoddy reporting.  No sources nor anything substantial enough to be verified by anyone else.  Just makes fans dislike Lyles for no clear reason.  It seems like if Lyles actually didn't want to be here, he would not have worked out for the Jazz in the first place."
UtahJazz,3c7ufs,casgoodnight,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:46:13 2015 UTC,Maybe his agent wants to sign a contract before he plays and risks injury. I think Rich Paul might have bigger things on his plate at the moment. Lindsay seems to be taking the blame in the name of cap flexibility.
UtahJazz,3c7onk,jwbt123,5,Sun Jul 5 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit out of the loop on this one. Is there some kind of beef right out of the gates here, or is something else holding him back?"
UtahJazz,3c7onk,IAmJBear,7,Sun Jul 5 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"Lindsey says it's the Jazz to save some cap space.   Other says its Rich Paul kinda holding out.   Others think it's because they will be trading him.   I don't know. Very, very unlike the Jazz to do this."
UtahJazz,3c7onk,6_ft_4,3,Sun Jul 5 18:27:57 2015 UTC,"Even if they were looking to trade him, wouldn't you want him to practice anyways? If he stays, he needs to know the system, no better time than the present to get started in learning it.  I don't think he wants to play here."
UtahJazz,3c7onk,TweetPoster,3,Sun Jul 5 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know. He's given every indication that he does want to play here.   His agent is Rich Paul, so he could be holding him out. Jody seems to be saying the price is there, it's just bonuses and incentives they are working on.   Maybe Paul doesn't want him to risk getting injured, so he's holding him out until that shit gets hammered out."

UtahJazz,3c8e3z,piilkypiilk,7,Sun Jul 5 21:29:58 2015 UTC,"Not overly great at anything.   He is by no means a good shooter, but he can hit shots.   Athleticism, of course. Will jump higher than anyone on your team, guaranteed.   Plus is an insanely hard worker. Will come in and do whatever is asked of him.   But the biggest contribution he will give your team is off the court. Great teammate. Even better person."
UtahJazz,3c8e3z,jwbt123,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:44:03 2015 UTC,Sounds just like Aminu last year.
UtahJazz,3c8e3z,USTS2011,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"He's similar to Aminu, but longer, thinner, and a little less skilled. He plays hard and is an insanely good guy. He's probably going to be your 4th big at best, and will provide you with a high flying highlight ever couple of games."
UtahJazz,3c8e3z,jwinskowski,3,Mon Jul 6 14:31:28 2015 UTC,"He's a decent rebounder, decent shot blocker, great hustle guy. He's got a decent midrange jumper as well. Not really great at anything, good a some stuff, decent at most things. He's been a fan favorite here for years because of the athleticism and mainly his hard work ethic, and great attitude. You guys got a hell of a reserve, happy for him and you guys!"
UtahJazz,3c8e3z,StankdaddyJones,2,Sun Jul 5 21:36:54 2015 UTC,I'm excited about him cause hopefully he can replace what we lost in brandan wright.   I think you guys are gonna be a solid team this year. I see you guys grabbing the 7/8 seed for the playoffs. Also loved your pick in trey lyles. Dude is a stud.
UtahJazz,3c8e3z,RobertLobLaw2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:19:25 2015 UTC,The guy is great at coming into the game for 5 minutes and making an impact. He's instant energy. He has a hard time guarding power forwards because he is undersized. Probably going to be the best artist on your team. You'll like him. I'll miss him.
UtahJazz,3c8e3z,chrimewave,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"hes got good bounce, thats his main thing. he is long and plays above the rim but is a better help defender than on-ball because larger forwards will just back him into the paint.  jeremy evans is the all time leader in alley-oops per minute in NBA history, he is very good at catching lobs.  hes, you know, not going to change the destiny of the franchise, but hes a good guy, nice, friendly, hard worker, and given some more playing time I could definitely see him being a solid contributor"
UtahJazz,3c8e3z,NoTengoTiempoParaTi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:59:30 2015 UTC,"Could be a solid bench player for you guys. He'll always give the team 100%. Unfortunately he never got consisted minutes with us because we simply had better players in front of him. I'll be paying close attention to how he's used else where. I'd really like to see what he could do getting 10-15 minutes consistently. Also, he can jump really high."

Maybe I've never quite recovered from the disappointment when his play dropped off during his Summer League after a stellar first game. He's got an awesome ability to keep the dribble alive, his ability to exploit passing windows/pockets is insane, but not sure how he fits defensively and worried that there won't be many scorers to deliver the ball to in the second and third units."

UtahJazz,3byu2p,SonicBroom51,8,Fri Jul 3 08:32:03 2015 UTC,"The Jazz needed two current playoff teams to have a rough free agency so that they have a shot at making the playoffs. With Aldridge probably leaving Portland, I wouldn't be surprised to see Robin Lopez and Wes Matthews also leave and go somewhere else. They also traded away Batum. That team is going to look very different, and I think that our team is better than the Blazers as long as they don't sign any big free agents.   The other team that looks like it is going to slip out of the playoffs is Dallas. They already lost Monta, Chandler, and Aminu. Unless they sign some quality players, they are going to slip out too. And as of now, it's looking pretty likely that they won't be able to get any other big free agents. Most of the players who are meeting with Dallas, are also meeting with other teams. And a lot of those other teams will have a more clear window to the playoffs.   If those two teams both slide out of playoff position, that means two other teams can get in. The first team is obviously the Thunder. But after that, it will be between us and Phoenix, and I think we have a better team than Phoenix. That is why I think some people, including myself, think the Jazz have a pretty damn good shot at making the playoffs next season"

Utah Jazz – Trey Lyles (PF, Kentucky, Fr., 19, 6-10, 241):   Still somewhat of a mystery because the ex-Kentucky forward had to contort his game to fit the role UK needed him to play last season. The Wildcats had a glut of frontcourt talent, so Lyles became a 6-foot-10 small forward in a two-post offense. While he isn't a liability defending the perimeter, his more natural position in the NBA is probably power forward. The skilled, versatile rookie should add to the strength of an already formidable Utah frontcourt. Marc J. Spears' grade: A+."

UtahJazz,3bwni0,helix400,10,Thu Jul 2 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"Like I always say if our defense carries over to next season, we will no doubt be in the mix for the 8th seed."
UtahJazz,3bwni0,TragicBronson5,9,Thu Jul 2 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"We should be a playoff team. I expect every player on our roster to be a better player than they were last year. Hayward and Favors have made marked improvement during every offseason. Burks was hampered by injuries, but still posted a team-best 3 pt. percentage (albeit in a moderately small sample size) last season. Gobert made a massive leap into the DPOY discussion. Exum is 19, getting stronger, and already made a wonderful defensive impact last season. Hood could have been in the RoTY debate if he had been healthy the whole season. Burke can make himself into a great backup point guard if he improves his shooting, and we still have Booker and Lyles for front court depth. Booker should be great next season because last season was the first time he shot 3s and he was already efficient.   I feel like almost all our wings and backcourt players could easily improve their 3pt percentages and here is why: Burks, Hood, and Exum can shoulder more of the offensive load, which will give Hayward more energy to expend elsewhere and give him more assisted looks. Burks was injured and shot his best percentage, which has improved significantly over the course of his career. Hood was a lot better in the second half of the season, and Exum should improve in every facet of his game. Trey is a little questionable here, but if he gets the green light in a bench role, it should help his confidence and allow him to operate more like he did at Michigan. Also having Cotton chomping at the bit might light a fire under his ass.  Our defense might not keep pace with our post-allstar numbers, but it can still yield 4-5 pts per 100 and still be league best. We did have a much easier schedule in at that time then we had at the beginning of the season. Having said that, however, it easily could. None of our players have hit their prime yet, and with our wings getting more savvy and growing into their man bodies, we might be able to match our interior force field with a lengthy wing curtain wall.   All that, and we might enter the season with eight-figure cap space, opening the door for a mid season trade with a team that was hoping to make the playoffs. If the Mavs miss badly, they might be willing to part ways with Parsons. A deal like that could give us even more momentum to carry into the playoffs.  I think we might surprise some people. The 8th seed might even be low."
UtahJazz,3bwni0,Sirenor,8,Thu Jul 2 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"It could. A lot of ppl are sleeping on the Jazz and were totally oblivious to the post all star finish. We still have a ton of young players with talent that need some more experience under their belt, I think 8 spot would be a good goal. This year isn't the year to look forward to tho, 2-3 years down the line we'll be a force in the west (barring any injuries)"
UtahJazz,3bwni0,StankdaddyJones,8,Thu Jul 2 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"I am so jealous of the Jazz, you guys have a great future and as a C's fan I would kill for your SF and Center"
UtahJazz,3bwni0,papi617,5,Thu Jul 2 22:16:09 2015 UTC,"There was a post in /r/nba a bit ago where someone made up a hypothetical reality show where LeBron goes to bottom dwelling franchises in one year deals. Their candidates for these basement dwelling teams included Utah in 2016-2017 season, and Timberwolves for the 2017-2018 season, and so many people agreed. So you ain't joking about going under the radar haha.  I swear, whenever the Jazz improve to be a Finals contender again, everyone's gonna be all ""Whats an OO-taw Jazz, and how are they in the finals?"""
UtahJazz,3bwni0,Incoherentrant,3,Thu Jul 2 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"Teams that improved the most post all star break the previous two years were the Charlotte Bobcats and the Sacramento Kings. They didn't exactly light it up the next year. Also, the Utah Jazz had the hardest strength of schedule before the allstar break and the easiest in the entire NBA after. Don't get me wrong, the Utah Jazz progress is promising and is going the right direction but I wouldn't be too surprised they are getting slept on."
UtahJazz,3bwni0,Clawedd,5,Thu Jul 2 23:02:23 2015 UTC,"Understood. Neither of those other teams had a defensive run like last year's Jazz tho. Post all star records may be flukes, but the defense is real."
UtahJazz,3bwni0,StankdaddyJones,7,Thu Jul 2 23:21:05 2015 UTC,"regardless of what happens in free agency, if we play defense like we did for the 2nd half of the season, we are making the damn playoffs, i dont give a good goddamn who is getting knocked out of their seed."
UtahJazz,3bwni0,chrimewave,6,Thu Jul 2 22:57:38 2015 UTC,"It will be super interesting if LMA were to go to the Suns (saying that, I still think  he'll end up in SA). Suns would be in a definite hunt for the 8 seed. Without LMA I don't really find them worse than last year, though.   I know that the three guaranteed things in life are death, taxes, and Tim Duncan in the playoffs, but maybe he slows a step. We know that Manu and Tony are on the decline, maybe that spot is up for grabs?  Mavs look like they're on track to win 25 games next year. Blazers, if they lose LMA along with Afflalo AND Batum (with the possibility of also losing RoLo and Wes Matthews), are definitely out of the hunt. Wolves could be intriguing if they can get the young guys playing well together.  TL;DR- the race for 8th seed in the West is going to be brutal, but fun as hell to watch."
UtahJazz,3bwni0,bubblegumshrimp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:21:38 2015 UTC,"Mavs look like they're on track to win 25 games next year.    Yeah, we've had a pretty terrible off-season... and I don't expect us to make the playoffs, but we're still too good for 25. Carlisle has found a way to get wins out of an essentially new roster each of the past 3 or 4 seasons. We'll hover around the 40-42 win mark (although that's actually our worst case scenario)."
UtahJazz,3bwni0,Ser_Scribbles,2,Fri Jul 3 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. With DJ in the mix, I could see you guys pushing 40. I guess it largely depends on if you end up with a bench at all. I think losing Monta was pretty big as well; he played a very large role. I also keep forgetting that you guys have Parsons, so hopefully he can step up and play a bigger role. We'll see if DJ can be more offensive-minded or if he'll take a step back without a HOFer feeding it to him at the rim."
UtahJazz,3bwni0,bubblegumshrimp,4,Fri Jul 3 20:46:02 2015 UTC,I think the eight seed is a possibility but it hinges on Dante improving to around the league average on offense.
UtahJazz,3bwni0,awerp,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:44:40 2015 UTC,he just seems scared to drive to the rim
UtahJazz,3buus5,TragicBronson5,7,Thu Jul 2 09:52:29 2015 UTC,"Nice to see someone mention the positive things the Jazz are doing. Team officials have said repeatedly that internal development is #1 priority, and moves like this certainly back that up. I'm personally really excited to see how our guys stack up this year.  I also think you can't underestimate the improvements that will come from being in Quin's system for a year (if you remember early last season, the team was just SO lost...) as well as having guys like Rudy and Rodney starting the year knowing exactly how successful they can be. Gordon has another developmental step left, I think (not sure if he takes it this year,) and don't forget that Alec Burks put up a 14/4/3 stat line last year, shooting 38% from 3 before getting hurt. And while Dante was a nice surprise defensively/from the 3pt line last year (remember, his shooting was a major concern before the season,) he was really pretty non-existent offensively. He's got a chance to really improve this year.  Should be a fun season!"
UtahJazz,3buus5,jwinskowski,6,Thu Jul 2 11:11:04 2015 UTC,Excited to finally see an Alec Burks at 100%. Crazy that his shoulder has been an issue ever since he's been here.
UtahJazz,3buus5,Rockettothemoon1,2,Thu Jul 2 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"Great post, and I think you'll notice teams that make a lot of FA moves in the offseason have a slow first month of the season until they all get used to each other.  Hoping the second half momentum continues for the Jazz in early '15-'16."
UtahJazz,3bunc2,OnlyhereforNBAstuff,6,Thu Jul 2 08:00:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like the ball ended up in Trey's hands at the end of the shot clock on bad possessions, and he would be forced to take more contested shots. I'm not saying he's a great shooter, but he took some tough shots last year because of our shitty offense. With Alec coming back next season and Rodney turning into a stud, I think Trey might have a better year. His trade value is so low right now, I think it makes more sense to keep him (at least for another year)"
UtahJazz,3bunc2,zna0,4,Thu Jul 2 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"im one of the remaining team trey strongholds on the internet, or the entire world most likely.  he is short, he does have a low fg%, but he was one of the very few players last year who could even get a shot up on his own. He made some strides on defense, and when he was on he had the ability to keep us in games or provide a 10point run.  hes also very professional, got demoted for a rookie teenager and never ONCE said anything negative or displayed poor body language.   definitely rooting for trey, and as /u/zna0 said, his value is low enough right now we're better off keeping him, is raul neto going to be better than trey burke? i doubt it"
UtahJazz,3bunc2,chrimewave,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:13:48 2015 UTC,"He's a solid ball handler and he knows the game, but he just can't shoot and he tends to be selfish sometimes. I think we should keep him unless the perfect guy comes along because he's a solid bench scorer (when he's hitting at least some of his shots), he's still young, and he's on a fairly cheap contract. If he is okay with being on the bench and coming off it to score I am totally okay with keeping him then, especially if he distributed the ball more to showcase his passing skills, which we saw glimpses of last year, instead of just chucking it up there. I also think that maybe a veteran presence (Neto?) would help take the weight off his and Dante's shoulders."
UtahJazz,3bunc2,seasonal_nudist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:27:50 2015 UTC,"If Trey can show any improvement in his shooting, I think he'd be a great backup PG. He's got nice passing skills in pick and roll situations and had an extremely low turnover rate in college and has kept that trend going so far in the NBA. His shooting numbers were just so terrible last year (worse overall and worse from 3,) in part because he was often our last/only option offensively in the second unit, and in part because he was just missing shots. I've got no problem keeping him as a backup PG.   As for Neto, I don't really view him as a fit at backup PG at all. Less size than Trey, and less threat as a 3pt shooter."
UtahJazz,3bunc2,jwinskowski,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:58:02 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everything said here is spot on. He's a great ball handler with an awesome assist/to rate. His shooting died somewhere in the draft, but his numbers are also low because he was like our only option on the second unit. I don't want to see him go, he's a hard worker and if anyone can help him it's Quin. Did I mention he runs the PnR extremely well?"

Edit: Only wildcard playoff teams right now are Portland, Phoenix, Dallas, NO, and Utah.  Pretty sure OKC, SA, Clips, Houston, Grizz and Warriors are in."
UtahJazz,3btxkk,cristianbernal,2,Thu Jul 2 05:28:45 2015 UTC,"We could stand a good chance, but you never know. If Portland lose LMA, the certainly wont be as good, but you can't count them out.   I want to be optimistic, I really do. But I don't see this team right now, winning more than 45 or 50 games. Which won't be good enough."
UtahJazz,3btxkk,jwbt123,2,Thu Jul 2 04:33:01 2015 UTC,"Well the things that I'm considering that, other than LMA, they were only 6 games away from missing the playoffs. (In my opinion) losing LMA would be a killer, but so is the likely loss of Wes, Lopez, Nic, and Afflalo does it for me. In no way do I see them outplaying 8 other very talented teams in the West for a playoff spot."
UtahJazz,3btxkk,bubblegumshrimp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:36:38 2015 UTC,"Last year had a 45 win 8th seed. Wouldn't be surprised if it climbed to 47, but the thing that people forget about such a strong Western conference is that it dilutes the wins from everywhere. OKC, SA, LAC, Houston, MEM, and GSW still have to play each other 3-4 times a year as well, so 10-12 strong western conference teams actually can help reduce the win total, as opposed to 8-9 strong western conference teams.  Also, Dallas is losing personnel and hasn't gained anyone. I see them dropping a step. Possibility is there with PDX as well, most notably if they lose LMA, Afflalo, Batum, and Wes Matthews."
UtahJazz,3btxkk,awerp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:32:11 2015 UTC,I don't think we can make the playoffs without a huge improvement from Exum. If he raises his offense to league average I like our chances but without it I don't think we can win enough games.
UtahJazz,3bq9be,Packattack622,19,Wed Jul 1 07:24:58 2015 UTC,"I hope they give him a max deal. For me that just will prove DL read the situation correctly, never intended to pay kanter that money, and traded 35 games of enes kanter for a first rounder"
UtahJazz,3bq9be,chrimewave,21,Wed Jul 1 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"Can we just move on, let them think what they want. Tbh I could care less how well he does now, he's not on the Jazz anymore."
UtahJazz,3bq9be,trippyimagez,4,Wed Jul 1 07:32:02 2015 UTC,Ya I'm with you. We have Gobert and he has played so much better since Kanter's departure. So I'm not mad just glad he is gone.
UtahJazz,3bq9be,clamjabber,3,Wed Jul 1 15:36:59 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I want to watch him sink their team so badly. If he gets money and gets to play with Westbrook/KD and gets some publicity he'll be happy, and meantime we'll be happy we're not watching him score 30+ in a losing effort"
UtahJazz,3bq9be,jwinskowski,10,Thu Jul 2 00:48:39 2015 UTC,"I don't wish him the best one bit. I hope he fails in his career. Call me bitter, but if our organization paid this CHILD copious amounts of money and put a ton of time into his development, and he didn't ""bring it every night."" Well then I couldn't care less about him."

UtahJazz,3bq9be,jwbt123,3,Wed Jul 1 21:11:13 2015 UTC,well to be honest Ibaka is a better defender than Favors

UtahJazz,3bp7lt,SixInTheStix,7,Wed Jul 1 02:38:16 2015 UTC,I'm sure he will.   Alec has been putting in work almost non-stop since he was cleared to actually start practicing again after surgery.   A very big thing is he tweaked some of his shooting mechanics.   There should be some serious battling going on in our backcourt between Exum and Burke and Burks and Hood.
UtahJazz,3bp7lt,J___,3,Wed Jul 1 02:52:44 2015 UTC,Biggest knock on Alec was his shot. Hope to see it better now
UtahJazz,3bp7lt,LlamaCombo,4,Wed Jul 1 03:20:19 2015 UTC,I legit hope Alec will shoot 38% or higher from the 3 this season.
UtahJazz,3bp7lt,SwordOfThunder,3,Wed Jul 1 03:22:42 2015 UTC,"Albeit a small sample size, he shot 38% from 3 last year.   I would like to see Alec take more threes next year. For his career, he only thees about 18% of the time. Not good for an SG."
UtahJazz,3bp7lt,MidLevelExceptional,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:43:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. His shooting has been far better than expected; the real problem (on offense) has been him foregoing open 3's for contested layups. He's also been a horrendous team defender, but with his physical tools and Snyder's tutelage, I'm hopeful that he'll remain healthy and have a breakout year offensively and defensively."
UtahJazz,3bp7lt,TragicBronson5,2,Wed Jul 1 23:11:46 2015 UTC,"biggest knock on Alec is his defense which is one of the worst from a perimeter player in the league. Hopefully Quin can do his magic with him like he did with Dante and Rodney. Close second knock on Alec is that he doesn't take the open 3p on the catch where he's actually great(43 this year, 42% last year), but rather prefers to drive into traffic for contested layups."
UtahJazz,3bp7lt,Redhot128,7,Wed Jul 1 06:38:27 2015 UTC,"This is said a lot, but Hood was an absolute steal for us. He can literally do everything on the court. He is going to be a great 6th man for us next season!"
UtahJazz,3bp7lt,RobertLobLaw2,4,Wed Jul 1 06:58:21 2015 UTC,"I actually wouldn't be surprised to see him force Quin to start him and have Alec come off the bench. Rodney fits what Quin is looking for little bit better with his 3 point shooting and his defense. Alec has had a lot of time to learn the offense and observe what Quin expects from his players, so he could come in this season and blow the doors off of ESA, but it is possible for Rodney to earn that starting role"

UtahJazz,3bq63z,Delerium89,6,Wed Jul 1 06:44:36 2015 UTC,"man i think we're just standing pat. and im ok with it. we could factiliate some trade and be the salary-dump team in a 3team trade (or direct trade) to garner more picks....but i dont want to get more guaranteed contracts because i actually would rather have elijah/cotton/ingles than some scrap heap of bullshit that gets us a pick in 2 years.  i also dont like the plan of bringing in a PG, just let exum breathe for a goddamn second. if you bring in a PG, at this point it feels like it needs to be a backup PG in exchange for trey burke--but i dont even like that much tbh.  shrug sign jinglin joe, sign trey lyles, test the waters on goberts willingness to sign an extension now, basically do nothing in FA, im fine with that"
UtahJazz,3bq63z,chrimewave,2,Wed Jul 1 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only thing that seems to be going on is between Ingles, pleiss, and neto. The biggest thing I can possibly see happening this offseason is signing those guys, and then trading Burke for a bunch of big contract guys and like a first or two. As much as I hate saying this, the lakers are looking for somewhere to dump salary. We could help them out, and maybe get a really good pick along with it."
UtahJazz,3bq63z,RGiss,2,Wed Jul 1 06:52:41 2015 UTC,I'm with you on this line of thinking. More assets coming our way in a salary dump and I think it'll be a very good move on our part :)
UtahJazz,3bq63z,pretzel_man,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:50:15 2015 UTC,I really at least thought we'd show more interest in Danny Green before he signed.

UtahJazz,3bpy2a,jwbt123,2,Wed Jul 1 05:14:16 2015 UTC,I really hope we sign this guy. We need a backup center. And I don't think we'd have to pay him a lot of money.

UtahJazz,3bsvye,chinabull86,6,Wed Jul 1 21:44:14 2015 UTC,"Would Draymond actually sign a contract with the Jazz though, based on what we know about him?   Not a chance. Draymond knows, and the FO knows, that we have better pieces than Green. Favors is younger, just as good defensively, better on offense, more experienced, and isn't a total cunt.   Green is a great fit for the Warriors. He is the most valuable there."
UtahJazz,3bsvye,jwbt123,2,Wed Jul 1 21:58:42 2015 UTC,Green can play the 3. Favors is a 4. Imagine Green coming off the bench to replace Hayward for a big lineup or replacing Favors if we need a smaller lineup. He would be a perfect fit. Can play D on the wing and shoot the 3.
UtahJazz,3bsvye,jwbt123,2,Wed Jul 1 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"He shots threes. He not all that good at it. Only 33% last season and 32% for his career. Booker hit 34% of his threes last year, albeit a much smaller sample size.   There is no way Green would come off the bench in Utah when he could start on the Warriors."
UtahJazz,3bsvye,natsemaj,-1,Wed Jul 1 22:06:51 2015 UTC,That's a good point. Money talks??  Can't a man dream? Isn't it worth trying?   Offer him a HUGE contract!

UtahJazz,3bsvye,chrimewave,-1,Thu Jul 2 02:08:17 2015 UTC,I do agree that it is a long shot that he would sign with the Jazz but what if we offer him the biggest contract he will see and he likes our young pieces...
UtahJazz,3bsvye,chrimewave,2,Wed Jul 1 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"from @andyblarsen on twitter:   Jazz won't chase after a max-level RFA (like Draymond) because they'd have to renounce Trevor Booker in order to sign the offer sheet.  Then Golden State would match, and then the Jazz would be sad that they lost Booker for nothing. And the Jazz try to avoid sadness.   So is it worth losing Booker to you to get a twat like Green to turn you down? Also where would you put him. You have a great 4 in Favors and a damn good 3 in Commissioner Gordon."

UtahJazz,3bi1x2,UnnecessaryHighFiver,2,Mon Jun 29 11:53:56 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that the major reasoning behind this and the Neto talks are to get players on cheap contracts before the 2017 blowup  Perhaps the jazz realize that they won't be able to afford everyone on their roster in the future and so this is a good bet?

Boise is much more likely. So then we have Exum/Burke/Cotton. If we trade Burke for something, that'll leave us with two PGs. Then we suddenly have a need for another PG.   That is where Neto could come into the picture.   But this is all just speculation on my end."
UtahJazz,3bgx4z,theberry10,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:48:29 2015 UTC,"This is kind of what I was thinking as well. They'll shave off a chunk of salary to add to Gobert's future paycheck, while getting more experience and consistent play from Neto."
UtahJazz,3bh3ky,trep88,8,Mon Jun 29 04:12:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think any of us would say no. That would be a killer trade for the Jazz.   But I think San Antonio says no to that fairly quickly. Patty Mills isn't a huge cap hit, so not much incentive to get him off the books.  I think the Spurs would look to trade Splitter +1st, and letting Danny Green walk. You get the much better Aldridge to replace Tiago, and let a guy who can be replaced walk.   They'll save about 13 Mil, and not lose a very good PG in the process. Plus with a slight cap rise and Duncan/Manu coming back at a discount, they could make it work."
UtahJazz,3bh3ky,jwbt123,2,Mon Jun 29 04:43:00 2015 UTC,"I'm betting resigning Danny Green > keeping Patty Mills for the Spurs.  Plus, Trey Burke is only in his 3rd year... still has some potential not realized.  And, if any organization could play to Burke's skill set, its the Spurs."
UtahJazz,3bh3ky,cristianbernal,2,Mon Jun 29 05:36:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting scenario. They would want to get rid of Diaw 100% if they're pursuing LMA. LMA would want above 17 mil a season. They couldn't get rid of Splitter because he needs to play either starting center or backup, they have no other option other than Duncan & Diaw currently and Diaw isn't exactly a center.  Could re-sign TD and Ginobili at 6 mil a year(both willing to take pay cut for LMA) and if they re-sign their roleplayers at minimum they could make it under the cap.  Trey to SA wouldn't make sense. They already have Cory Joseph.  This scenario would probably require a third team who needs a backup PG. Enter the Chicago Bulls(?), who desperately need someone to play Guard for them if Rose is out.  If we trade Burke and Diaw comes to us they save 7.5 mil a year for like 3,4 years. and we get what we wanted, a stretch 4/ good defender.  This deal would unfortunately make Booker expendable though. Diaw is taller, better defender, and better shooter. Booker's team option could unfortunately not be picked up, or if it is, he'd be traded to the Bulls because their only options at backup PF are Nazr Mohammed who is super old, and Taj Gibson who is more of SF."
UtahJazz,3bh3ky,cristianbernal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:18:50 2015 UTC,"A few things: Diaw is more of a fan-favorite than Tiago & $1MM cheaper; LMA can play the ""5"" as well, if needed; Trey is also $1MM cheaper than Patty; and LMA gonna make $18.84MM next year on a standard $80MM/4yr Max (meaning TD&MANU down to $4~5mm... don't think they're that generous, but maybe!)  Biggest benefit to the Spurs would be the Trade Exception, which they could use to do some trades before Feb.  Should be a lot of shakeup in the league due to explosive cap growth.  I like the Chicago play as well, interesting to think about.  They and BKN are in biggest need of a backup PG."
UtahJazz,3bh3ky,BabyS1othWithA1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:42:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah possibly, I don't know the SA fan base very well so I guess that's believable. His contract is still a liability though. If they're replacing him with LMA it would be a drastic upgrade and wouldn't make sense to keep 2 PF and only have one true Center on the squad.  Thanks, I came up with the Chicago scenario on the fly. Think of it though, Brooks and Hinrich are pretty huge dips in talent from D-Rose. Sure, Trey isn't that much better, but still an upgrade from those two.  Edit: didn't notice you edited so I will update.  Diaw won't play center, and no way they play LMA at center in the west. They would lose so many games. Also Duncan is like almost 40, he needs rest and will be out around 10 games, with no center back-up it wouldn't make sense to keep Diaw and trade Splitter.  Trey is a significant downgrade from Patty for only 1 mil. Not worth it for S.A. Especially since they have a better version of Trey in Cory Joseph.  BKN can't afford pretty much any FA at this point. They're on full on rebuilding mode, and we wouldn't trade with them because we wouldn't be able to take any valuable assets from them unlike Chicago.  Also BKN has Steve Blake and Jarret Jack."
UtahJazz,3bh3ky,BabyS1othWithA1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:54:59 2015 UTC,"Agree with your edit, for sure. What do you think we'd need to give up to get Tiago and Patty Mills?"
UtahJazz,3bh3ky,chrimewave,2,Mon Jun 29 20:00:24 2015 UTC,San Antonio says no aggressively hard. The only reason we would trade Splitter/Mills is to clear up cap room to sign LMA so we wouldn't take any contracts in return. If we take on a contract we won't be able to sign him. We probably won't be able to sign him if we retain Green.
UtahJazz,3bgycx,zfox,4,Mon Jun 29 03:19:21 2015 UTC,"Ingles - about 90% chance he not only gets on the roster, but gets a like a 3 year deal with a team option on year 3. Only way I don't see him back is if some team throws a lot of money his way in Free Agency (which I don't see happening).   Cotton - I'm about 60% sure he will be on the roster. I'm to the point where I think he'll make the roster, but there is still plenty of room for him not to. We just drafted Hanlan, and it looks like we're going to speak to Neto and see if he wants to come over.   I guess a lot depends on what we do with Trey. All I know for sure about out PGs is that Exum will be playing and (more than likely) starting."

UtahJazz,3bgycx,Rockettothemoon1,2,Mon Jun 29 03:45:31 2015 UTC,"I hope Pleiss makes the roster so that we have a legitimate back up center for Rudy. I also think Ingles makes the roster. His shot came along in the second half of the season, he also turned out to be quite a playmaker."

You don't trade that.  You never trade that.  If Derrick Favors ever gets traded, I lose faith in this front office."
UtahJazz,3bhb52,Xsy,4,Mon Jun 29 06:46:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be a fan. Derrick is better now than Millsap, and is probably better than Lyles will ever be.   Plus what of Exum? Do we downgrade our front court just to have Exum overtake Bledsoe anyway? Would he even want to stay? Do we trade away Exum as well?  I don't want to shake up our core. I think we should roll with what we have. I think we have a very, very good thing going. No need to shake it up."
UtahJazz,3bhb52,jwbt123,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:57:36 2015 UTC,"I felt like the whole Millsap situation was that he brings a different style that may complement Gobert better than Favors.   I would think the upgrade you're getting in the backcourt would definitely outweight the loss in the frontcourt, and Exum can still get playing time behind/with Bledsoe. He's on a rookie deal and there's no incentive to move him. If he does develop well, they could flip Bledsoe in a few years and let Exum take the starting role.   (I'd personally keep the core in tact, but think it's worth exploring the Millsap-idea)"
UtahJazz,3bhb52,Rockettothemoon1,3,Mon Jun 29 06:08:33 2015 UTC,"Trading Favors in any way is not a good idea. This man, not only wants to be in Utah, but has upped his game in some way every year and still hasn't reached his ceiling."

UtahJazz,3bdi4h,PachiBooks,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:03:51 2015 UTC,Not really. Exum was never really going to excel at hitting a mid range shot off the dribble.    Think more of this but with more scoring in drives.   I think Burks is a better comparison than Hood.
UtahJazz,3bca26,jwbt123,21,Sat Jun 27 21:18:16 2015 UTC,I like Joe. Good high character player that can come off the bench as a role player and contribute. I'm glad he'll be back!
UtahJazz,3bca26,AceHyzer,13,Sat Jun 27 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"plus I really like that he is mentoring Exum. He seems to have made Dante's transition here much better.  Also, his radio interviews are actually pretty fun to listen to during the regular season on sports radio"

UtahJazz,3b7v9v,Redhot128,21,Fri Jun 26 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"Jazz land Jimmy Butler. Thibs offers his services as an assistant coach just to be a part of a defense that gives up less than 85 points per game. Next year, Timmy, Tony, and Manu retire. Kawhi demands to be traded to the Jazz. Jazz become the new hotness due to winning 75 games during the regular season and Raul Neto's sex appeal. Jazz win the title for 5 consecutive seasons, never allowing more than 80 points in any game. We all get to complain about how this sub is overrun with bandwagon fans."
UtahJazz,3b7v9v,RobertLobLaw2,2,Fri Jun 26 23:31:59 2015 UTC,More Raul neto please.
UtahJazz,3b7v9v,Skiptoomylou,9,Sat Jun 27 00:06:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with you and I think that's the reason why we didn't pick Devin Booker. Seems that the FO has some faith in Hood and Burks. I would love a back up center, preferably a defensive minded kind of guy. I would also like to see if we could get some depth at the SF too."
UtahJazz,3b7v9v,seasonal_nudist,9,Fri Jun 26 19:02:36 2015 UTC,I heard that the Spurs were potentially looking to deal some people to make room for LMA one of the names discussed was Patty Mills. What do you guys think about going after him to increase our strength at both the PG and the Australian positions.
UtahJazz,3b7v9v,Popped_Tarts,6,Fri Jun 26 21:00:54 2015 UTC,mills over burke any day
UtahJazz,3b7v9v,sathyyyy,3,Sat Jun 27 16:27:34 2015 UTC,We need another bench Australian so Ingles doesn't get too lonely.
UtahJazz,3b7v9v,Packattack622,7,Sat Jun 27 05:11:10 2015 UTC,"We aren't competing for a championship yet.  I know we finished the season strongly, but I feel like too many Jazz fans think we're going to sign a borderline all star and make a run for the chip.  That's not happening.    If we sign any veterans, they're going to be bench veterans.  Dudes who can help our young guys grow, while not stealing any of their minutes.  Jamaal Tinsely, Earl Watson type veterans.  Maybe another Trevor Booker  at best.  This season is going to be more of the same as last year.  Stellar D, and working on a team offense."
UtahJazz,3b7v9v,Xsy,4,Fri Jun 26 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"you're right about not competing for a championship, but i disagree that 2015-16 will be ""more of the same as last year"" because the jazz were totally out of any realistic playoff contention by about December 1st.  this year we may only be 1 notch higher on the totem poll, but its an important notch, because we SHOULD be in the playoff race the whole way, potentially jockeying for position in the last week of the season as opposed to shutting it down."
UtahJazz,3b7v9v,chrimewave,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:08:58 2015 UTC,I don't count the first half of last season.  That was all an adjustment period. :P

UtahJazz,3b7v9v,jwinskowski,5,Fri Jun 26 20:19:24 2015 UTC,"since the all star break, i've been telling all my warriors fans friends that this is the team to look out for next season. in fact a national radio host laughed at me for suggesting the jazz make the playoffs this next season. from what i saw this team desperately needs  a second wing scorer from the guard positions. I think exum, since he's no longer a rookie, can recapture his aggressiveness that made him so highly touted and hopefully improves his shooting. however, im not sold on burks (yes injury i know) or rodney hood just yet. i think a wes matthews type would really but you guys over the top and this allows burks or hood to come off the bench where they'd provide much needed scoring depth. combine that with a top 5 defense and the pick of lyles, and you have the 6 seed in the west."
UtahJazz,3b7v9v,sathyyyy,2,Sat Jun 27 16:19:00 2015 UTC,I agree.  Jazz need a guy that puts up points in bunches.  I feel a 7/8 seed is more likely

A guy like Robin Lopez would be awesome I think, since he's willing to do the dirty work and just hustles. Solid player. I'd also be interested in a Spencer Hawes type as a backup stretch 5... Could give us flexibility. I think if we can get a solid FA or two things could be great this season. Would also like to see us add a veteran PG with starting experience."
UtahJazz,3b7v9v,jwinskowski,3,Fri Jun 26 19:46:41 2015 UTC,Really hope they lock down the 50% off Papa John's special again from last season. Did you know it was good for wings & not just pizza? Will be bummed if Papa John's is not part of this season

Brandan Wright or Kosta Koufos seem like a great options too, if we can get them for cheap.   Other than that I'd like a veteran point guard. I'd love to see Mo Williams come back, but that's unlikely to happen. Other than that I wouldn't mind Jameer Nelson or even 6 man like Lou Will."

UtahJazz,3b6yl9,Loyfdnyrd,8,Fri Jun 26 13:53:37 2015 UTC,"Booker - keep. Unless a good trade comes up, then his non-guaranteed contract could be traded as a cap saving measure.    Johnson - will pick up option, but cut after Free agency/training camp  Cotton - keep. I think he showed enough in the final month that they Jazz should keep him around, and stash that PG we pick up in the 2nd round    Cooley - Same with Johnson, will pick up option, but be cut later. I don't see a place for him in this team. Love the guy, but can't play the 5, where we need him.   Millsap - keep. We still need defense on the perimeter. Will stay simply because of that.   Evans - Gone. With Lyles coming, there isn't a spot for him on this team anymore. Love the dude with all my heart, but he's gone.   Ingles - will keep and sign to a longer contract, unless someone throws money his way."
UtahJazz,3b6yl9,jwbt123,4,Fri Jun 26 16:08:35 2015 UTC,"Elijah has potential as an elite situational/matchup defender. If he can get anything resembling a 3pt. shot (and stop trying to create offense himself) he could be a solid rotational wing player.  Booker is great. Love him. Could be a key cog in a trade or stay with us and bust his butt when he gets minutes. He's awesome.  Cotton is destined to be a 3rd PG, but I like him. I'd trust him as a backup if one of our first two PGs goes down, and he's cheap.  Cooley, Johnson, and Evans just don't really seem to have a place on the team at the moment. Just not the direction we're going.  Ingles is basically an ""if we don't get anything better"" type of guy. Can back up both wing positions, but Elijah already has an elite skill (and is therefore worth developing) and Joe is probably at or near his ceiling. If we don't pick up any other wing players, I'd keep him. If we get someone better, he's probably gone."
UtahJazz,3b6yl9,jwinskowski,2,Fri Jun 26 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"Trevor Booker (Team option) - Gone next year, Keep this year. Too expensive to keep after this season.  Chris Johnson (Team option) Keep. Played well consistently.  Bryce Cotton (Team option) - Keep. True PG.  Jack Cooley (Team option) - Don't care about this guy. Might keep him though.  Elijah Millsap (Team option) - Keep. Good rotation guy, great energy, and a Millsap.  Jeremy Evans (UFA) - Gone. Lyles is his replacement.  Joe Ingles (RFA) - Keep, LOVE this guy.  Also obligatory #TradeTrey"
UtahJazz,3b6yl9,cristianbernal,3,Fri Jun 26 17:18:32 2015 UTC,"Trevor Booker - Keep. Love his energy off the bench and I think he's a fantastic locker room presence for us. Great all around guy and would hate to see him go.  Chris Johnson - Let go. Meh.  Bryce Cotton - Keep. Love the pace he plays at off the bench and the tone he sets. Seems like he could be a great spark plug in the vein of Aaron Brooks/Nate Robinson  Jack Cooley - Keep  Elijah Millsap - Keep. Great defense and someone we can use to really lock in guards through stretches where our starters sit.  Jeremy Evans - Keep. I don't think we will, but I've always liked Jeremy. He's been a great pro and has shown some range the last couple years. I'd love if he could add a 3 point stroke and crack the rotation more.  Joe Ingles - Keep. He's a good playmaker and shooter off the bench. Helps to mitigate when Hayward is off the floor and he seems to be a good team defender and hustle player."

UtahJazz,3b516y,jwinskowski,2,Fri Jun 26 15:13:32 2015 UTC,Thats very reassuring. Phew. Thanks brother
UtahJazz,3b516y,Mrgreenfield,-1,Fri Jun 26 19:26:34 2015 UTC,"Measured in at 6'10"" 235, he's gonna do just fine at the 4. He actually is the kind of guy who will also probably lose some weight before he starts gaining."
UtahJazz,3b516y,beefdog99,0,Fri Jun 26 19:37:15 2015 UTC,He wont start because favors is a beast and booker is a decent backup. We really didnt need a pf
UtahJazz,3b516y,Mrgreenfield,4,Fri Jun 26 02:05:14 2015 UTC,"I love Trevor, but you don't make decisions based off of him really. He's replaceable"
UtahJazz,3b516y,tatatatyler,2,Fri Jun 26 01:21:05 2015 UTC,Gotcha thanks for the response. Could Booker play the 5 on the second team? Sorry for my ignorance.
UtahJazz,3b516y,four4four,3,Fri Jun 26 04:53:55 2015 UTC,No way. He's undersized at the 4 as is

UtahJazz,3b516y,four4four,5,Fri Jun 26 01:27:36 2015 UTC,I don't know that yet. I'd rather let them compete for the spot and see who sticks
UtahJazz,3b516y,That_Guy_At_Work,3,Fri Jun 26 01:28:46 2015 UTC,Lyles. Love booker to death.
UtahJazz,3b516y,Mrgreenfield,2,Fri Jun 26 01:36:44 2015 UTC,No. Hes listed as 6'8
UtahJazz,3b516y,Mrgreenfield,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:32:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's ridiculous when people argue against drafting a guy on the basis of having a backup already on the roster.  A backup? Seriously?  Booker doesn't even have a guaranteed roster spot?  Also rookies almost never contribute to teams winning so I don't see what fit this year has to do with it.  We have starters at all positions and Booker was a spotty backup who couldn't spread the floor, defend, or rebound effectively."
UtahJazz,3b516y,abdishaquor,5,Fri Jun 26 01:32:13 2015 UTC,I have faith in our FO but......what?
UtahJazz,3b516y,Krakenborn,6,Fri Jun 26 10:35:17 2015 UTC,Captures it perfectly for me.
UtahJazz,3b516y,pretzel_man,3,Fri Jun 26 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but what did you expect?  Multiple of the best sites have been projecting that we'd pick Lyles for months.  Even when he hasn't been the guy he's been in the conversation.  David Locke has been talking constantly about what a good fit he would be.  Also when mocks didn't have us take Lyles they had us take Turner, Portis, or Kaminsky.  A big that could shoot was a pretty well telegraphed decision coming from the front office.  Where is your confusion coming from?"
UtahJazz,3b516y,abdishaquor,2,Fri Jun 26 01:39:07 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think of is that they plan on signing Wes Matthews. If they can sign him or another SG, it makes sense that we take a post player. Lyles might end up being the big man off the bench that we lacked last season."
UtahJazz,3b516y,srlehi68,2,Fri Jun 26 10:29:05 2015 UTC,I just posted in another thread that I'd be interested to see if we go after Wes zzz Matthews. I also read that we're planning to pursue Jimmy Butler. I'm confident that we'll address wing shooting in free agency...I expect us to be very active come July 1
UtahJazz,3b516y,jwinskowski,3,Fri Jun 26 07:33:02 2015 UTC,Personally I was for trading down at this point. Need more info on Lyles though to make it seem justified
UtahJazz,3b516y,koolaidman1030,3,Fri Jun 26 10:19:34 2015 UTC,I just read about him and apparently they've played him at Small Forward despite his size. Hayward's backup then?
UtahJazz,3b516y,ARKO801,10,Fri Jun 26 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"No, he had to play out of position at Kentucky. Had Towns and WCS to compete with.   And I think that is a good thing. He is a natural 4, but has the ability to play the 3."
UtahJazz,3b516y,jwinskowski,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:47:43 2015 UTC,All depending on matchup. I think we'll utilize him well.
UtahJazz,3b516y,Not_MyCabbages,0,Fri Jun 26 01:50:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he will continue to play mostly at the 3. Can you imagine how useful a 6'10 ""small"" forward would be when we play LeBron or Durant?"
UtahJazz,3b516y,Dabawse26,0,Fri Jun 26 10:21:47 2015 UTC,Hes not a good defender tho
UtahJazz,3b516y,jwinskowski,5,Fri Jun 26 05:58:11 2015 UTC,"He's not a great defender, but he's not a bad one. Should do much better in our system and with our personnel."

UtahJazz,3b516y,simpleadventure,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:04:52 2015 UTC,I think Trey Burke gets traded.
UtahJazz,3b516y,mfpark,3,Sat Jun 27 11:34:57 2015 UTC,I honestly don't see what the panic is all about here.  He's intelligent.  He's played at the highest level.  His value is in his versatility as a big.  He can bring the ball down the court kinda of versatility. He's naive about the Utah scene. He doesn't understand how special it is here and how every player on the jazz generally likes living here :)
UtahJazz,3b516y,jwinskowski,3,Sun Jun 28 04:58:03 2015 UTC,"Well, almost every player."
UtahJazz,3b516y,simpleadventure,2,Fri Jun 26 01:20:59 2015 UTC,The opening paragraph to this article is soooo brilliant.

UtahJazz,3b516y,Delerium89,5,Fri Jun 26 01:42:10 2015 UTC,Any particular reason why Utah wouldn't want Booker back? I though his energy and intensity is exactly what this team needed off the bench.

UtahJazz,3b516y,pretzel_man,2,Fri Jun 26 08:25:46 2015 UTC,They're gonna trade him to someone for a 2 guard mark my words.

But after reading up and watching some clips he seems promising. If we get Butler (lord almighty please) we would be Conference Finals contention right there. Exum, Butler, Hayward (those 2 interchangeable), Favors and Gobert is scary.  That and our bench would be Burke, Burks, Hood, Booker, Lyles... That's pretty deadly. Although we would be pretty undersized for our bigs in the second unit. Unless we supposedly are bringing in that guy from Europe?"

He will give us a lot of versatility in our front court, especially if he starts knocking down his jump shot and extends it to the 3p line. Can't wait to see him in Summer league."
UtahJazz,3b516y,DarkSabre7,0,Sat Jun 27 11:35:21 2015 UTC,Not really happy about that honestly. Id bet hell never get minutes. I think we shouldve reached for a more high risk high reward wing/pg
UtahJazz,3b516y,jwinskowski,-1,Sun Jun 28 06:19:02 2015 UTC,"Can't say I'm super excited about this.  We need shooting, as Jalen said, and yet we take a big man who can't shoot from outside the painted area..."
UtahJazz,3b516y,TragicBronson5,4,Fri Jun 26 01:03:03 2015 UTC,He can shoot from outside of the paint. He can hit midrange shots. But he needs to extend his range further.
UtahJazz,3b516y,Mrgreenfield,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:06:15 2015 UTC,His numbers from 15 feet to the 3 pt line we're good... Now just have to solidify the 3
UtahJazz,3b516y,dareman86,0,Fri Jun 26 01:08:57 2015 UTC,Is he gonna play backup center? Because TBook is our backup PF.
UtahJazz,3b516y,Mrgreenfield,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:26:33 2015 UTC,"He's most likely going to play behind Book for now, unless he's better than we expect. Then he will mostly play the four, but will also be able to help out at the 3."

UtahJazz,3b53b1,jwbt123,7,Fri Jun 26 01:14:15 2015 UTC,Dude is also super versatile. He has the size of a 4 but also played the 3 in Kentucky. Could be a nice impact playmaking guy if one of our guys is struggling. But what about the Good Book?
UtahJazz,3b53b1,seasonal_nudist,3,Fri Jun 26 03:41:09 2015 UTC,We literally have players everywhere. Any pick we made would have eaten into someone's role who is currently on the team.
UtahJazz,3b53b1,abdishaquor,2,Fri Jun 26 07:27:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with you. He's a long 3/4, I think he has Lamar Odom potential."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,jwinskowski,3,Fri Jun 26 09:36:27 2015 UTC,The potential Lamar Odom realised or the potential Lamar had?
UtahJazz,3b53b1,whobefckdyou,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:51:45 2015 UTC,"What he realized, which was pretty good."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,jwinskowski,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:02:47 2015 UTC,Oh for sure. He was a jet and one of my all time favourites. If Lyles has half the career Odom had you could still be happy.   But I was just checking about the potential thing because I'd be pressed to find more than 5 players in the last 15 years who had more potential than Lamar.
UtahJazz,3b53b1,whobefckdyou,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:20:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he really did have a lot of tools at his disposal. Length, ballhandling, shooting. He was a nightmare for the Jazz during the Deron/Booz years."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,jwinskowski,3,Mon Jun 29 21:43:00 2015 UTC,In Dennis Lindsey we trust!
UtahJazz,3b53b1,That_Guy_At_Work,3,Fri Jun 26 03:32:21 2015 UTC,"Also worth remembering that DL's still got 4 months of possible trades, RFAs, and UFAs to address roster needs.   I like the pick, but then again I've always talked myself into liking Jazz picks on draft day."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,ThisIsAMormon,6,Fri Jun 26 08:45:03 2015 UTC,"For me, the general thought process is that we have a desperate need of outside shooting, and that isn't one of his strengths. Yes, Burks is coming back from injury and Hood finished strong, but we needed a stretch four and we possibly got Boozer 2.0? This might be the first bad pick of DL's tenure"
UtahJazz,3b53b1,spacemusclehampster,13,Fri Jun 26 01:37:47 2015 UTC,"Lyles is already a better defender than Boozer ever was.   He's really lengthy. He has a 7'4 wingspan, and he still has time to grow. Plus it's not like he doesn't have range. He can hit midrange shots. If Booker can improve as much as he did over one offseason, imagine what Lyles can do."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,hugephaggot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:45:32 2015 UTC,"7'1.5"" wingspan according to the NBA Combine measurements on Draftexpress, so he's not crazy lengthy and defense is his main weakness according to their scouting report. But I have faith that Quin and his staff can turn him into a capable defender, especially after seeing what they did with Rodney and Dante their rookie years."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,bland12,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:32:17 2015 UTC,"Remeber, he played the 3 in college.  So his defensive evaluations and based on him chasing 6-6 players around the court. Not guarding another 6-10 big man."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,Muchhappiernow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:42:46 2015 UTC,Booker was a stud with Washington. His range is still about the same as it has been. His thing is playing in the right offense.
UtahJazz,3b53b1,StocktonToMalone,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:30:01 2015 UTC,"This was a pretty unattractive pick to me but the more I'm reading about him I think we'll be fine. Besides it's not like the Jazz were really banking on this pick. The biggest thing for this team is internal improvement, we didn't need any major additions. Lyles seems to be a high character guy (or kid I guess lol) and he certainly won't cause any problems with the team chemistry. And if he can contribute some then even better."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,Saul052592,0,Fri Jun 26 04:55:41 2015 UTC,He was simply the best player availible....think about it Cal played him out of position at the three over a guy who you guys wanted in Booker who's natural position was a wing. Cal obvs knew that Lyles was just the superior talent.
UtahJazz,3b53b1,_cardinalpuff,5,Tue Jun 30 21:32:59 2015 UTC,"I agree we need shooting, more so than a backup big, which is why it makes sense to me for them to pursue shooting in free agency"
UtahJazz,3b53b1,hammock_complex,2,Fri Jun 26 02:36:03 2015 UTC,I do not understand the Boozer comp
UtahJazz,3b53b1,bland12,2,Fri Jun 26 04:03:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah it makes no sense, he moves much better than booz, runs the floor better than booz and looks to have a much less selfish attitude.   Plus his jumper doesn't look ugly as hell"
UtahJazz,3b53b1,abdishaquor,2,Fri Jun 26 12:49:09 2015 UTC,"I think Lyles projects as a possible three point shooter.     More importantly I think there was no one else on the board who could give us the shooting that we need.  Devin Booker couldn't give us the shooting we lack. We have decent shooting on the wing.  It's at positions 1, 4, and 5 that we clog the floor.  So given that need I don't think anyone outdoes Lyles.    Finally I think you can make the case that he's the best player available.  There is certainly no one who was obviously better on the board.  Many other teams considered drafting him much higher.  He was #9 on Chad Ford's big board and #10 on the best analytical model I've ever seen that was put out by fivethirtyeight.com."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,jwinskowski,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:24:50 2015 UTC,"Agree with this for sure. Has a good looking shot, and actually shot decently from 15+ feet. Sounds like he shot the corner 3 well in his Jazz workout, and can also play with the ball in his hands, meaning guys like Dante and Gordon can play off of him as shooters. Will be interesting to see what this means for Alec Burks (whose catch and shoot numbers are actually really good, though he doesn't seem to want to catch and shoot since that hasn't been his role before now.) And beyond that there just wasn't a guy who was clearly better than him. I think the low-risk pick reflects the team's confidence in the current roster and their ability to address needs (pure shooting wing and stretch backup big) in free agency. I'm intrigued to see if we pursue a guy like Wes Matthews. Great shooter and defender, was here before, could be more ""get-able"" after the injury..."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,Skiptoomylou,2,Fri Jun 26 09:49:20 2015 UTC,If you have watched any film on lyles you would know he is not at all similar to boozer in any way shape or form.
UtahJazz,3b53b1,Saul052592,0,Fri Jun 26 04:59:05 2015 UTC,Yeah Boozer was never capable of playing SF....Lyles was a steal
UtahJazz,3b53b1,wafflesofnote,4,Tue Jun 30 21:33:47 2015 UTC,At this point the Jazz are so much better than I thought they would have been I trust Dennis Lindsey and Quin Snyder  (as long as the rumors of getting rid of Favors to get Paul Millsap back are bullshit because honestly what the fuck?)
UtahJazz,3b53b1,Kaiwi,2,Fri Jun 26 05:17:58 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for Turner, but Lyles isn't bad by any means. We still have our core, and now we have someone who can rotate 3-4-5. I want the season to start already."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,Delex31,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:55:05 2015 UTC,"After the Lyles pick, I believe we were going Turner until the Pacers grabbed him, probably too high a price to move up."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,Saul052592,0,Fri Jun 26 14:30:45 2015 UTC,I think you got the better player anyway in Lyles....obvs time could only tell
UtahJazz,3b53b1,bland12,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"I cannot believe the amount of fans who are flipping their shot over this pick!   I get that booker is a sweet shooter, but two weeks ago that kid was projected to go in the late teens. Suddenly he's the hot name and what do jazz fans always think? That the jazz are going to chase the hot names! But the jazz never chase the hot names, especially not DL.  IMO if we draft booker the minutes go something like this:  Hayward 35 mpg burks 32 mpg hood 26 mpg Rookie booker 10 mpg??? Is that going to make a big difference?"
UtahJazz,3b53b1,Saul052592,0,Fri Jun 26 12:46:04 2015 UTC,If Booker was so good why did Cal start Lyles out of position over him? Because obviously he is a superior talent
UtahJazz,3b53b1,scootsy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"My only issue with the pick is that it doesn't fill either of our two biggest needs. Alec is a great scorer, but with out front court, we need spacers... great shooters. That's not Alec's strength. I remember everyone saying he just needed to shoot more from outside, but it hasn't really been successful within the scheme.   Next, we weren't in search of depth behind Favors, but rather depth behind Gobert. Lyles won't play the 5, considering he's smaller than Favors, and Favors was too small to play 5, and he isn't the spacer we need to keep the floor open.   I just feel like we may have picked a good player, but not the player that filled the need in the current arc of development."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,abdishaquor,2,Fri Jun 26 05:07:27 2015 UTC,I don't agree that Favors can't play backup 5.  The number of offensive backup 5's that are dangerous is extremely low.  Draymond Green had no problem going against backup centers.  Favors is extremely long and athletic and once he's not paired with Kanter in the front court I think he'll be absolutely fine playing 12 minutes a night at the 5.  I'm convinced that almost all of his struggles at that position came from being paired with Kanter.
UtahJazz,3b53b1,jwinskowski,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:31:10 2015 UTC,"I gotta disagree with you on us needing a pure backup center. If we can find a guy that's a stretch 5 (Kaminsky was gone already) then that might be great. But I think Favors is more than capable to play the 5 against most starting centers and certainly vs. backup centers. Having two big men in the post at all times is the exception in today's NBA, not the rule."
UtahJazz,3b53b1,Saul052592,0,Fri Jun 26 09:40:47 2015 UTC,I think when you are picking at 12 you just take the best player availible....besides you guys dont have any play making bigs so he brings that at a minimum
UtahJazz,3b5mb3,Muchhappiernow,6,Fri Jun 26 04:05:27 2015 UTC,And... adios to Daniel.   Being traded to Portland for a future second rounder.   Which could be good! Portland could be shit in the coming years.

UtahJazz,3b5mb3,Delex31,2,Fri Jun 26 15:03:27 2015 UTC,"I believe it's the same. You have to enter the draft, if you don't get picked you're free to sign."
UtahJazz,3b5mb3,hook_killed_pan,2,Fri Jun 26 15:26:15 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way: you, the player, are not really involved in the draft.  The draft is for all the teams to agree who has the rights to offer you a contract.  If nobody even wants to fight over those rights (undrafted), then you can pursue a contract with anyone.  If you don't want an NBA contract (Euro league lifer) then you don't have to sign with the NBA team that drafted you. But you can't stop them from calling dibs on you."

UtahJazz,3b4ej8,RGiss,8,Thu Jun 25 21:44:46 2015 UTC,Derrick Favors isn't on the table unless it's a REALLY good deal. I'd be extremely surprised and very disappointed if we got rid of Favs today.
UtahJazz,3b4ej8,poastertoaster,3,Thu Jun 25 22:45:05 2015 UTC,Why is everyone so sure that we're trading Favors and going to sign Millsap? Anything is possible but there's no reason for loads of speculation about moves that aren't likely to happen
UtahJazz,3b4ej8,thatshitlerscanoe,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:45:36 2015 UTC,"I was just explaining why I believed the rumor was there, and why it might, possibly happen. I don't think it will happen, nor do I want it to. We'll see though."
UtahJazz,3b4ej8,JrBusch91,2,Thu Jun 25 23:40:26 2015 UTC,"Thunder fan here. A thought just occurred to me, maybe they want Millsap so they can play small with Gobert as the anchor. Makes sense since scoring is the teams achillies heal. Gobert is a beast and I think that strategy isn't half bad as long there are a couple decent back up bigs who can rebound."
UtahJazz,3b4ej8,Faus7ian,2,Fri Jun 26 01:01:53 2015 UTC,I just don't feel like Millsap is that good of a player. Reknown for setting soft screens and fouling. Obviously undersized.
UtahJazz,3b4ej8,ClickClackHotHand,0,Thu Jun 25 22:25:03 2015 UTC,"For real. Undersized, and committing a lot of fouls sure. Setting soft screens, I don't see that at all."
UtahJazz,3b4ej8,MidLevelExceptional,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:16:30 2015 UTC,"No, the question is Favors+Millsap(OR another FA) or Millsap +another asset(uncertainty of the asset)? People act like draft picks are a sure thing. Also you have to take into account that Favors is 23 year old borderline all-star and has been improving every single year in the league and is still to hit his prime, and is on a great contract , while you would have to overpay Millsap to get him on the downside of his career.   On your question - I'd take Exum-Hood-Hayward-Favors-Gobert(with Favors best years ahead) over Russell-Hood-Hayward-Millsap-Gobert(with the uncertainty of Russell and Millsap quite possibly declining during the length of his next contract). Seems like you've given up on Exum already if you think a rookie will be better than him next year. What if that rookie turns to actually be worse than Exum? Have you seen him play defense?   If anything, if we made such a trade and ended up with that type of roster, I'd be putting Exum next to Russell in order for him to take on the better opposing guard and not let Russell be abused in D. I actually think they'd complement each other perfectly."
UtahJazz,3b3t7r,trep88,2,Thu Jun 25 19:07:09 2015 UTC,Burks? Hood? I'll pass.
UtahJazz,3b3t7r,cristianbernal,-2,Thu Jun 25 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think burks and hood would cracks the starting lineup even w the status quo. They're going to be fantastic off the bench, and we'll be legitimately 8 men deep with many versatile lineups."
UtahJazz,3b3t7r,Packattack622,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:35:53 2015 UTC,So I'm guessing you're predicting we sign Millsap in FA instead of any sort of trade?
UtahJazz,3b3t7r,Packattack622,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:39:47 2015 UTC,Why trade when we've saved the cap for years?
UtahJazz,3b3t7r,poastertoaster,3,Thu Jun 25 19:41:45 2015 UTC,"Understandable. Was just trying to figure out how you were thinking about this is all.

UtahJazz,3b2zf0,RGiss,10,Thu Jun 25 15:30:58 2015 UTC,"I still really like Trey, and I think he could still be a good player for us in this league. He's a professional who didn't complain when he got moved to the bench, and I think the horrendous shooting season he had last year will improve this year, because the third year is when most people improve. However, he really just doesn't fit with how we want our team to run. He slows the game down, and he isn't long enough to switch 1-3 like we would prefer. So I can see why this would make sense.  I know a lot of Jazz fans want him gone, and in the long run it would probably be beneficial to move him depending on what we get in return, but I'll support him wherever he plays next year. Whether it's for us, or for some other team."
UtahJazz,3b2zf0,Redhot128,3,Thu Jun 25 16:04:26 2015 UTC,pls. I respect him a lot as a person and a player but he doesn't fit here. We already have a solid backcourt in Dante/Alec/Rodney plus Bryce showed he's worth playing 10-12 minutes a game.
UtahJazz,3b2zf0,Krakenborn,2,Thu Jun 25 17:47:25 2015 UTC,Yes!
UtahJazz,3b2zf0,frozengash,2,Thu Jun 25 15:54:30 2015 UTC,I feel like Trey is our team's glue. By himself he's not much but with our team he comes off the bench fantastically. I don't want him to leave
UtahJazz,3b2zf0,poastertoaster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"RIP my jersey. But for real I'd be sad to see him go... Probably my favorite player throughout his college years and he's  a very professional athlete. If only his shooting hadn't failed him at this level. Whoever he goes to will be getting a new fan, and hopefully we get something good for him in return."

UtahJazz,3b2zf0,Sidekicknicholas,2,Thu Jun 25 19:30:18 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, probably a late first round pick around 22-30. Or they would package him with something else to try to get a veteran guard or shooter back."
UtahJazz,3b2zf0,Redhot128,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:38:53 2015 UTC,Kevin Martin for Burke ... straight up?  We get a backup PG and free up space at SG.  This could allow Wiggins to move to SG and then Bazzy be the starter at SF.  You guys get a vet sg.
UtahJazz,3b2zf0,Sidekicknicholas,2,Thu Jun 25 19:41:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe like 4 years ago I would have taken that trade, but Martin is 32 years old and injury prone. At this point I don't think he would be worth the risk and would rather bank on Trey"
UtahJazz,3b2zf0,Redhot128,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:13:35 2015 UTC,"What I feel we lack is depth at the SG spot, though most fans are looking for a stretch 4. Burke is a pretty solid 6th imo. I doubt he'd ever be 6th of the year, but he'd certainly be in the running one day. I wouldn't consider him a starter any time soon."
UtahJazz,3b2zf0,poastertoaster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:43:32 2015 UTC,"Kevin Martin for Burke?  We get PG depth, you get a vet SG... salaries are close enough to make it work."

He might be kinda pricey because his skill set is pretty valuable in the league and he's starting to get into a groove. He's also a tough guy, which fits in with our other big men. If he wasn't on the same college teams as John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Davis, etc. he probably could have made a name for himself in college and been a top 5-10 pick. I definitely think he'd be a good addition but I wouldn't give up too much. Trade Trey, maybe a pick or 2."
UtahJazz,3b3vcd,jliv60,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:31:54 2015 UTC,"I like him, but seems redundant with Lyles getting drafted."

UtahJazz,3b36xx,StocktonToMalone,6,Thu Jun 25 17:19:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. I love me some Faves. He has improved every year we've had him. I don't know if he'll ever be an All-Star caliber player but he is a damn fine defender and his offensive game isn't a liability anymore. KEEP THE FAVORS!!!!!

Paul is a free agent, meaning we don't need to trade Faves for Millsap. If we signed Paul and then decided to trade Favors, it would be for something good. Favors is extremely valuable to the Jazz. They're not just going to ""dump"" him in some crappy trade. It would have to be for something legit (i.e. Better than just a sign and trade for Millsap.) And that's exciting to me, in spite of how much I love Favors.   Who's the type of player you'd be willing to see the Jazz get in a Favors trade?"
UtahJazz,3b1zhy,Packattack622,8,Thu Jun 25 09:13:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Jazz will even try for him.   We already have the most DeRozan-like player in the NBA... Alec Burks.   I mean, it's scary how similar these two play. Don't get me wrong, both are good players. But do we really want two of them on the same team?   The biggest problem with them is the don't shoot or defend well. Big, big problem on this team."
UtahJazz,3b1zhy,jwbt123,2,Thu Jun 25 11:30:14 2015 UTC,That is true. It feels like forever since I've seen Burks play so I guess I forgot how comparable the two are. I guess maybe sticking with the defense first mentality is the way to go for this team. Do you think they make a push to sign Danny Green? I feel like he's the best fit for the team. Hopefully they keep building around defense with a guy like Myles Turner in the draft later.
UtahJazz,3b1zhy,jwbt123,3,Thu Jun 25 11:35:31 2015 UTC,"God, I hope so. Danny Green would be a wet dream for me."

UtahJazz,3b1zhy,Redhot128,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:30:27 2015 UTC,I went over to the Pacers sub and they seemed to believe Bird is locked in on Kaminsky or Lyles if WCS doesn't fall to them. As a Turner fan I guess this is good news. Only way to know for sure is to watch and see. One thing I know is this is shaping up to be an interesting draft.

UtahJazz,3azdeh,Muchhappiernow,7,Wed Jun 24 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I mean his offense is boner-inspiring, but the new Jazz identity is defense, and I don't think we want Favors coming off the bench. Pairing Love with Gobert would mitigate his defensive liabilities though. And Favors could still get significant minutes.... it's interesting to think about but no. I think our stretch 4 option should come in a reserve role. And in any case I think it's highly unlikely that he leaves Cleveland."
UtahJazz,3azdeh,LoneMantiss,2,Wed Jun 24 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"agreed, its unlikely he leaves cleveland and even more unlikely he leaves cleveland to play for the jazz.  he would probably do well paired up with Gobert, and would score more than derrick favors does. but kevin love is overrated imo, his points and rebound production puts him in the category of elite bigs but I think it grossly overstates his actual impact on a basketball game.   favors is probably just straight up better than love even though his stats have lower numbers"
UtahJazz,3azdeh,chrimewave,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"There is a post in /r/NBA about Cleveland looking for a sign and trade for Love, something the Jazz can definitely get in on."
UtahJazz,3azdeh,abdishaquor,2,Wed Jun 24 21:43:24 2015 UTC,We don't have the clout as a free agent destination. I don't think there is any chance he comes here.  The Jazz can't build in a big way around free agents.  We have to do it via trade or the draft.
UtahJazz,3azdeh,TragicBronson5,2,Wed Jun 24 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"Not trying to hate, but there is ZERO CHANCE that the Jazz even attempt to sign him."

UtahJazz,3azdeh,poastertoaster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:37:21 2015 UTC,Kevin Love has high demand and likely needs a larger market to cater to him than Utah. He'd be far too expensive for us. Regardless of whether or not he fits our team (I think he doesn't) we won't get him
UtahJazz,3awf9z,TragicBronson5,9,Wed Jun 24 01:22:05 2015 UTC,"Offense always rules over defense with these things.   So if a Jazz man is going to be named to the All Star team, it's going to be Hayward.   I'd say if Gordon averages 20+ ppg and the Jazz are somewhat at least in the playoff race, he'll get selected."
UtahJazz,3awf9z,jwbt123,3,Wed Jun 24 01:36:56 2015 UTC,"Just curious, where do you think the All Star placement has Hayward as a backcourt or frontcourt player?"
UtahJazz,3awf9z,jwbt123,3,Wed Jun 24 01:45:34 2015 UTC,I would assume a frontcourt player since he now has a legit SF body.
UtahJazz,3awf9z,chrimewave,6,Wed Jun 24 01:58:28 2015 UTC,"Hes absolutely a sf, we could run him as pf in some lineups, favors as small ball center, or even hayward and gobert. Hayward is like harden or lebron in that their positions may be sg or sf, but really hes just our point haygod"
UtahJazz,3awf9z,poastertoaster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:31:51 2015 UTC,Idk a lot of places list him as a 2 first and a 3 second
UtahJazz,3awf9z,abdishaquor,3,Wed Jun 24 12:37:42 2015 UTC,I think people talk about Gobert the most.  The national media pays attention to that guy and if we are the best defensive team in the league I think Gobert will get a lot of the credit.  That said the center position is a really hard one to get in on since it isn't even on the ballot.

UtahJazz,3awf9z,poastertoaster,3,Wed Jun 24 01:40:08 2015 UTC,"Most likely? If anyone I might think Gobert if he continues to play like he ended last season. The west is so good, the odds are for established stars."
UtahJazz,3awf9z,Xsy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:52:06 2015 UTC,Typically the all star game is reserved for offensive stars. I think favors has a better chance than gobert
UtahJazz,3awf9z,woopigchewie,2,Wed Jun 24 12:38:33 2015 UTC,Its Hayward or no one.  Most likely no one.
UtahJazz,3awf9z,EMateos,2,Wed Jun 24 03:48:31 2015 UTC,although its unlikely to happen
UtahJazz,3awf9z,Upural,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:54:26 2015 UTC,"I think Gobert is a sneaky pick to make the all star team. He definitely has the size/will have the experience next season to be among the west leaders in Rebs/Blocks. I think it's most likely going to be Hayward, though. He's going to have really solid stats next year. The team will be better = assists up, another year = his PPG will be up, if the Jazz stay in the top half in the west he will be the figurehead leader and have a shoe in for the all-star game (sorta like how the Hawks had like four Allstars this year)"

UtahJazz,3avgcq,Kidballa,6,Tue Jun 23 20:44:51 2015 UTC,Does nobody remember how much his terrible contract hurt us and how abysmal his play became after that?

UtahJazz,3avgcq,Crunketh,6,Fri Jun 26 07:52:28 2015 UTC,"No. I love the guy, but lets be realistic, he doesn't deserve to be in the rafters with those other guys. Hornacek was the difference between a playoff exit and a finals exit.... god damn MJ. Eaton was a multiple time DPOY, and has one of the most unbreakable records in basketball, blocks in a season. Griffith is the only one he's close to, and that guy had a major impact on our franchise keeping us somewhat relevant pre-Stockton and Malone."
UtahJazz,3avgcq,ignitionnight,3,Wed Jun 24 04:03:22 2015 UTC,I say yes but it'll probably have a lot to do with how iconic his number is to him as much as his play.
UtahJazz,3avgcq,Krakenborn,2,Wed Jun 24 00:15:55 2015 UTC,I reeeeeeally think they should. And they probably will. AK got us through some hard times post Malone-Stockton. And he managed to become an all star against all odds. Players like him rarely receive that honor. Plus he was a 5x5 guy. He did a lot for the Jazz during a big transitional phase.

UtahJazz,3avgcq,TragicBronson5,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"I think so. We've got Horny and Eaton up there, and AK was a better player than both of them, in addition to being more important to the team.   His prime was cut short by injuries and that contract was devastating, but he was one of the top all-around threats in the league for a few years."
UtahJazz,3avgcq,soapy_goatherd,7,Tue Jun 23 21:18:03 2015 UTC,"id take hornacek>AK  hornacek was a good player  that said, i think andrei will have his # retired here. #47 isnt in high demand for one thing, and for another AK was the talisman of our team for a few years in the post john/karl world we all found ourselves in"
UtahJazz,3avgcq,chrimewave,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:37:35 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong - I love Hornacek and loved watching those 90s Jazz teams. And he was a damn good player. I just think AK gets the edge because of his offensive versatility and defensive prowess.  And you're spot on about AK being the talisman between eras. Those would've been some dark years without him.

UtahJazz,3arkqi,phenom415,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:59:42 2015 UTC,"First off, I'd like to say that I am happy with the way things turned out.  However, in regards to the article, I would rather have our current teams floor than the speculated teams ceiling. Hayward and Wiggins/Parker would be a deadly combo, but as the article alludes to who knows how it would've panned out. Fave's is a huge part of our team and losing him could've been a serious issue. Our whole frontcourt could've shaken out in a very negative way very easily. It isn't unfathomable to think we could've been looking at one of the top 5 picks for the foreseeable future if the moves had gone through and south.  I see our current teams floor as a Memphis comparison, and I'm ok with that compared to the very real possibility of a sac/det comparison with a slight chance of a okc comparison.  Imo the risks outweighed the benefits of this ""what-if"" scenario and that's why we have our current roster and why we should be thankful to have our current FO."
UtahJazz,3arkqi,kaptinkangaroo,2,Tue Jun 23 05:01:39 2015 UTC,The strange thing is we would be spending a lot of time and effort developing Kanter and that would not have worked out well.
UtahJazz,3apbqb,rodeobot,2,Mon Jun 22 12:11:27 2015 UTC,Got to depth chart and immediately don't trust it. Jeremy Evans is not our 2nd string SF? Dante started at PG... I do agree about strengthening our big man rotation mainly by getting someone better than Cooley or Evans.
UtahJazz,3apbqb,trippyimagez,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah that depth chart was just wrong, also what does Portis bring to the table shooting wise, the way the article read was that portis is a hustle guy, who is a little taller than Booker.  I'm not sold."
UtahJazz,3apbqb,tintman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:49:15 2015 UTC,"To be honest I haven't followed the draft at all this year, so I have no actual opinion on the player. I've been a lazy fan 😐"
UtahJazz,3apbqb,trippyimagez,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"Portis has a reliable shot from out to 20 feet, with the chance to develop a reliable three. Portis does hustle, but that's not the only part of his game. His offensive repertoire is very well rounded he can play with his back to the basket and face up as well. He doesn't have an elite skill which hurts his stock a bit as people will want to chase home run chances with guys like Myles Turner, but he is very solid all around.  Most draftniks will get off on measurables and potential, but in my opinion there is something to be said about actually producing. I don't want to keep bring up Turner as if he and Portis are the only options, but just for comparison's sake. If Turner is as elite physically as he's supposed to be, why couldn't he dominate at the collegiate level? Bobby Portis is a sophomore who tore up the SEC (not the best basketball conference, but not a mid major either) and won conference player of the year. His PER is 4th behind Kaminsky, Anthony-Towns and Okafor.  Portis isn't winning rookie of the year, and honestly its hard for me to say he'll ever be an NBA starter, but the guy will be in the NBA for a very long time and will have a great career as a backup big in the NBA. I say take the soild pick, shore up the big man rotation, and see what this team can do with a full season under Snyder."
UtahJazz,3ak7f1,jwbt123,9,Sun Jun 21 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"Trying to be somewhat realistic about who we would pick, I don't think anyone would be bad. Pretty much any position can be upgraded on this team. We're at the point where we are a good team, but we need upgrade.   Honestly, the worst case scenario for me is us trying to trade up for a top 5 pick. Breaking up great team chemistry for someone who is still uncertain. Taking steps back, not forward.   I'm not entirely sold on anyone that's not Towns. I really want us to draft at 12 and continue on with what we have."
UtahJazz,3ak7f1,Mobilethrowawaytime,3,Sun Jun 21 02:08:52 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with you. I think if we just pick whoever the FO think is the best at our 12 spot, we'll do pretty well.

UtahJazz,3ak7f1,StocktonToMalone,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:22:57 2015 UTC,I just worry about being complacent with this team.

(Altanta Hawks) I'd prefer we trade some sure thing assets for a shot at the superstar we need to really compete. But I respect your opinion as well and my heart just really wants to press forward with the team we have.

But after taking a close look at Myles Turner I feel like he has the tools to develop some really solid range plus he has plus defense as a prospect. Also listening to his interviews he sounds like a really intelligent guy and seems like a hard worker. I think Turner and Kaminsky are really the best two options in that order.

UtahJazz,3aduiy,one8sevenn,2,Fri Jun 19 23:38:13 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this trade, is there something I am missing? How do we take 19 million in salary and get a draft pick without trading back with the 125% rule?  So we just cut cooley, johnson, ingles, jerrett, and bryce cotton?"
UtahJazz,3aduiy,AlmightyBones,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:38:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not a capologist by an means so correct me if I'm wrong.  According to hoopshype.com we have $45,583,334 in committed salary next year.  The cap is going to be around 69 million.  The difference is cap space.  You can take on salary any way you like while under the cap. It's only above the cap that the 125% rule functions.  It's for that reason that the 76ers were able to take on JaVale McGee's contract for nothing.  The Jazz did the same thing when they took on Biedrins and Jefferson from the Warriors."
UtahJazz,3aduiy,SammyP18,2,Sun Jun 21 00:05:22 2015 UTC,"Sooooo the Heat give us Chalmers, McRoberts, Birdman, and the #10 pick for future first round picks from two consistent playoff teams, and some bench players? They may have cap issues, but there is no way they would bite on a deal that one sided."
UtahJazz,3aduiy,Mobilethrowawaytime,5,Fri Jun 19 14:53:55 2015 UTC,"What you aren't considering is that the Heat have to make an extremely hard choice here to cut salary.  Not doing this trade (or one like it) would mean they might have to pay 50+ million in luxury tax this year (to say nothing of an additional 19 million in simple salary) and loose Whiteside the next year.  I don't know about you but that doesn't sound like a good strategy.  So they have to cut about 20 million in salary this year and hopefully cut as much as possible for the year after.  What alternatives do they have?  How else are they going to dump that many players?  Sure Chalmers, McRoberts, and Birdman have some value on the court but it's not near the combined 15 million they are owed.  I'm certain that those guys have almost zero trade value.  No one is going to take on that much junk salary without a large incentive.    Doc Rivers was ridiculed for trading a pick to dump 4 million in salary.  But he experienced a ton of pressure to cut salary.  It's not 1/10th the pressure the Heat are under.  As Jazz fans I think we need to try and take advantage of a team like that.    Miami does have some alternatives but I think they are very unpalatable.  They could try and find some way to low ball Wade, Deng, and Dragic and try and extract 15 million of salary between the 3 of them.  Then they'd have to move only McRoberts which is probably doable without taking back salary.  But I don't think the Heat have much leverage over Deng or Dragic.  Getting them to take a discount is going to be really tricky.  I don't see it.  Wade on the other hand they do have leverage over. Wade doesn't want to leave and probably wouldn't get huge money anywhere even if he did. But as an organization they rely on being the kind of team that takes care of their players.  They've relied on that frequently to attract free agents and get players to take less for brief periods of time.  If they screw over Wade here I think it's really ugly for them.   Wade had gotten promises that he'd be rewarded for his sacrifice. For him to get screwed instead would really hurt his relationship with the team and really damage their reputation as a free agent spot.  Also I'm not sure it's possible to lowball Wade enough to get the financial flexibility they need.      Another option might be for them to let Deng walk.  But that comes with a host of additional problems.  This team is built to win now.  They've spent huge amounts in money and picks to be good next year.  If they let Deng walk that means they have to start either a rookie that they draft at 10 (Johnson, Dekker, etc.) at the 3 or start a fringe NBA player.  I think this would doom them.  Very few rookies can make contributions in their first years and they'd need a huge one from anyone they slotted in there.  I don't see Pat Riley betting his whole season on a miracle like that.     So maybe you don't think they bite on this deal but what kinds of alternatives do they have?  I think this is about as good a deal as they can get."

We don't like one guy (who's mostly included for salary reasons) and that's enough to blow hope the whole deal. Seriously though who cares? The trade is not about Anderson it's about the pick.

UtahJazz,3a9ws9,edbenz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:43:52 2015 UTC,"if we get a point guard, i would hope that means we traded a PG and our pick and went up to get russell. id rather not draft someone like cameron payne @ the 12th spot and have exum/burke on the roster still.  now, would i trade exum + 12 for a top 3 pick? ugh probably but I really like exum"

UtahJazz,3a9ws9,frozengash,2,Fri Jun 19 00:25:38 2015 UTC,Nobody in the top 3 would consider that trade. Burke has yet to show that he can be a good player in this league consistently

UtahJazz,3a9ws9,trippyimagez,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"Im super pumped. I only wish i knew more about the college players. Ill be watching the draftexpress videos but i still have no idea who we're shooting for. It seems to me that the jazz need a 2 or 3 that can get to the rim and more importantly get fouls and also shoot the 3 ball well. But with our defensively orientated game now it really opens up who we can grab. I fear we get a 4 or a 5 in the draft and have difficulty giving them minutes (which may or may not be a reasonable concern.) i like the idea of a small 5 that could play when rudy is sitting that could play the 4 when rudys in, however. What do yall think we should look for ?"
UtahJazz,3a9ws9,Mrgreenfield,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:11:56 2015 UTC,"We are fortunate in this draft to have intriguing options at #12. Personally, I'd prefer a 3 (who can stretch 4) with consistent range on their shot. We're pretty stacked at SG/SF with Hayward, Burks, and Hood and I'd love for them to continue developing. A bigger wing who can score would provide some lineup flexibility in a league that's gearing towards small ball (and they could help provide relief for our Favors/Gobert/Booker rotation if need be)."

UtahJazz,3aans9,frozengash,3,Fri Jun 19 00:23:54 2015 UTC,"Russel would be absolutely perfect for us, but nobody in the top 3 is going to trade out for a grab bag of role players.  And I wouldn't want to trade Hayward, Favors, or Gobert.    It may be in the cards to move up a few spots to get in that 7-10 range, though.  I would love to see us get another athletic wing player or point guard, and there are a few in that range.  I can definitely see us trading some stuff for a late 1st rounder as well.  That would be right in the FO's wheelhouse."
UtahJazz,3aans9,JohnHenryAaron,2,Thu Jun 18 20:34:18 2015 UTC,Not to mention Gordon's trade kicker that would make him hard to trade anyway.  I agree though. I would not be opposed to picking up another athletic wing or guard. My concern is which asset would we trade to get up to a pick in the 7-10 range?
UtahJazz,3aans9,walmartsecure,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:10:48 2015 UTC,"Mudiej, Hezonja, Stanley Johnson, Kelly Oubre.  Johnson's an incredible athlete and would be a solid defender at the very least.  I haven't seen any of the other guys really."
UtahJazz,3aans9,JohnHenryAaron,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:50:45 2015 UTC,Who's asking who we would give up to attain one of those guys. I'm not really a fan of trading anyone besides Burke and the non core pieces

UtahJazz,3aans9,JohnHenryAaron,4,Fri Jun 19 05:36:29 2015 UTC,It seems like the only desirable picks are the top 3. There's no way we get one of those 3 picks. The talent level in picks 4-15 will probably be pretty even. I don't think trading up is needed.
UtahJazz,3aans9,jliv60,3,Thu Jun 18 20:49:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not that excited about most of the players in this draft, so no.  If one of the top couple teams was willing to give their pick away, sure, but I wouldn't want to give up any of the developing assets."
UtahJazz,3aans9,mimicgogo,0,Thu Jun 18 16:15:02 2015 UTC,Why? If I might ask. To me this draft looks incredibly deep and much stronger than others in the past.

UtahJazz,3aans9,trippyimagez,3,Fri Jun 19 00:29:13 2015 UTC,"Depends, really I don't see it happening. My prediction is Burke gets traded and we draft a guard."
UtahJazz,3aans9,Mrgreenfield,2,Thu Jun 18 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"No, i like what we have and i am of the opinion we can get a valuable asset with any pick. Hood was a good pick later in the first round, im sure whoever we get at 12 will be quality as well."
UtahJazz,3aans9,bikercyclistguy,2,Fri Jun 19 03:07:30 2015 UTC,"I'll probably get downvoted for this, but my draft crush is Bobby Portis. I think they could trade down into the late teens/early twenties and still get him."

There is nobody in this draft that is worth giving up proven talent for that will instantly come in and make us an immediate contender. At this point, that is what it will take for me to even think about moving one of those guys. And I think Lindsey feels the same way"

That's the foundation for a championship right there.  So yeah even though he's one of my favorite players in the league I'd absolutely trade Favors and #12 (or hopefully GS '17) for Porzingis."

UtahJazz,3aans9,SwordOfThunder,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:11:25 2015 UTC,True.  But I'm hoping and praying to win championships.  I don't think a Gobert/Favors front court can be a part of an elite playoff offense.  I think that without an offensive superstar and with two bigs who can't shoot we have a ceiling as a second round team.  I could easily be wrong but looking at NBA playoff teams seems to suggest that you need an offensive superstar and a starting PF who can hit threes.  I think that having neither is pretty damning.
UtahJazz,3aans9,DokerinZion,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"I would deal Favors, the 12th pick, and more for the 1st pick to get Towns. I guess the same would be true for Porzingis if the recent hype is real, but Lindsey would have to be pretty damn sure, and it better be based on numerous scouting reports of Porzingis in Spain (which they probably have), not just a strong workout.   Otherwise, while I like Russell the next best, I don't think he's good enough to move Favors or Hayward for (let alone Rudy), and you're not moving up more than a couple spots without including one of them or Exum."
UtahJazz,3aans9,Skiptoomylou,0,Thu Jun 18 23:28:55 2015 UTC,"I would drop either Burk, Burks and/or Favors for a top 2 or 3 pick."
UtahJazz,3aans9,EggoSlayer,3,Thu Jun 18 19:40:07 2015 UTC,Favors? Wat..
UtahJazz,3aans9,DokerinZion,2,Thu Jun 18 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also feel that is a bit ludicrous.  Giving up a proven good big for an unknown talent would be off the table.  Talented bigs are hard to come by these days.  I wouldn't give up Burks either.  Burke, possibly, but that wouldn't come even close to scratching a top 3 pick.  Unless they are willing to take a few role players and future picks I don't see it happening.  I would prefer to just stay in the position we are in right now.  I feel like whatever we would have to give up to move into that position wouldn't be worth the assets lost and there is some decent talent to be had in the draft position we are in."
UtahJazz,3aans9,chrimewave,0,Thu Jun 18 22:52:05 2015 UTC,I think you all give Favors too much credit.  He's not and will not ever be an all-star or the one person that puts us over the top.  Atlanta tried the no-name team and it ran into a huge Labron James.  You need a star to win and we don't have one.

UtahJazz,3aans9,DokerinZion,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:35:20 2015 UTC,You're drastically underrating Favors defensively. He's ALREADY one of the better defensive Power Forwards in basketball. His offense gets better every year. No question he needs to be part of the Jazz.
UtahJazz,3aans9,jliv60,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:00:17 2015 UTC,I am exactly estimating him.  He's too timid/lacks the skill to take a game over.
UtahJazz,3aans9,DokerinZion,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:11:47 2015 UTC,He's a beast at the rim. He rebounds really well. He's good for 15-20 points per game. Doesn't really have injury problems. What more do you need from him? His size puts constant pressure on other teams' big men. He and Gobert anchoring the middle of a team is going to be one of the best in the league in years to come. Just because he isn't an all star at age 23 is no reason to give up on him. This is Utah. Nobody wants to come here. We need to improve with what we have and what we have is extremely exciting. I'm willing to bet there won't be a better combination of big men in the league in 2-3 years if we keep Favors and Gobert together.
UtahJazz,3aans9,jliv60,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm not saying I don't like him.. I'm telling you that he's not a star and there are 3 freaks of nature at 1 2 and 3 in this draft that could be career dominant forces."

UtahJazz,39tges,collexensen,4,Sun Jun 14 16:44:46 2015 UTC,"Here is the section about the Jazz:  Utah Jazz  Likely cap position: under  Top objective: add shooting  Possible targets: The Jazz are poised to become something special, and they are about to add yet another lottery pick to their extensive collection of such players already on hand. They have the financial structure in place to keep all of these guys when they are ready to be extended, as Utah has already done with Gordon Hayward, Derrick Favors and Alec Burks. As this young group continues to develop together, another deep-shooting threat would help Utah mount a playoff push next season.  You don't want to overspend, though. There are free agents who make sense in a salary vacuum: Wesley Matthews, Khris Middleton, Louis Williams, etc. If Matthews' injury hurts his market value, then that might be a nice upside play. Otherwise, expect the Jazz to stay the course."
UtahJazz,39tges,phenom415,3,Sun Jun 14 16:45:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's just the injury keeping his name out of discussions. Pre-injury, he would have been maybe my No. 1 free agent target for the Jazz. Very concerned now."
UtahJazz,39tges,frozengash,2,Sun Jun 14 18:45:52 2015 UTC,I don't see a name that gets us over the hump.  we are better off staying put. The idea of a shooter sounds great but which one of these is actually a shooter upgrade

UtahJazz,39qw9p,chrimewave,2,Sun Jun 14 00:40:35 2015 UTC,"It kinda sucks that jeremy is haywards best friend on the team, but at this point if evans hasnt earned more minutes in 3 years thats not a good sig"

UtahJazz,39rk4e,Dante_Exum,5,Thu Jun 18 00:02:48 2015 UTC,The colours was one of the main reasons I picked the Jazz a few years ago actually.  I'm from Australia and the reason I picked the Aussie Rules team I follow was for their colours which is also blue and yellow

UtahJazz,39rk4e,DokerinZion,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:27:44 2015 UTC,"Never liked powder blue (too generic and bland).  Never liked the weird purple/copper mashup even though it was unique.    Our current color scheme is downright awesome.  The Jazz note logo is among the tops in the league.  Most teams go for 3Dish style logos.  The Jazz stick with a unique, sharp 2D one.  I'm happy they got away from the Mardi Gras purple color and went with a tweak to make it Utah's.   Going back to green on the road is perfect.    The only thing I don't like is the secondary logo's color scheme.  The yellow wording is just weird.  http://www.slamonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/utah_jazz_mountain_logo.jpg"

He is the starter on a team that just went to the Eastern Conference finals, and even if that series wasn't competitive, the Hawks were not full strength, and showed the league they are a great team. I just don't see it, as much as I want him back"

UtahJazz,39llx5,Xsy,11,Fri Jun 12 19:51:00 2015 UTC,I honestly love Paul but (if this rumor is true) this move would not make a lot of sense for the Jazz.
UtahJazz,39llx5,Kaiwi,4,Fri Jun 12 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"I think it wouldn't make sense for Millsap.  We'd love to have a versatile stretch four who's a proven winner.

UtahJazz,39llx5,MidLevelExceptional,4,Fri Jun 12 18:14:40 2015 UTC,"Good points from Andy Larsen:    Perhaps the biggest thing in the way of the Jazz signing Millsap is their inability to offer him a max contract unless significant salary shredding moves are made. According to Basketball Insiders, even if the Jazz release all of their non-guaranteed contracts (including Millsap's brother Elijah), the Jazz would only have $16.6 million in cap space.   Paul Millsap's max contract would start at somewhere around $18.6 million. If another team would be willing to offer Millsap a max deal, and there are indications that they would, Millsap would have to give the Jazz a discount in order to sign in Utah.    Link  I think the fact that Millsap is a big Quin Snyder fan is the only reason this rumor might have some teeth."
UtahJazz,39llx5,helix400,3,Fri Jun 12 19:15:21 2015 UTC,"This makes zero sense, unless Millsap is willing to be coming off the bench."

UtahJazz,39llx5,abdishaquor,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:53:24 2015 UTC,I don't see how this could be true. I've read in countless interviews that the Jazz do not want to make moves that will disrupt chemistry. I don't see how this wouldn't affect chemistry.
UtahJazz,39llx5,Rockettothemoon1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:36:53 2015 UTC,Millsap has always been a great chemistry guy.  Any move we make is going to involve bringing in a new player obviously.  The most you can hope for is that he's high character guy who will bring a defensive mentality.
UtahJazz,39iotd,danielsilva12345,6,Fri Jun 12 00:03:14 2015 UTC,I'm not doing backflips or anything over him. But I would love to see him on this team. He could make an immediate impact (especially with his passing ability)
