I imagine in time you'll realise you're bi, but maybe not and it's just this one friend.  Either way just enjoy it and try and avoid classifying yourself, as this leads to internal dilemmas (in my experience).  As a teenager I also had a thing for just one other girl, otherwise guys.  As I got older I found I liked girls and guys both, in general.  I'm okay with how it all turned out!

lgbt,3e10a5,alternativeleanings,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Bisexuality can be simple or it can be very complicated filled with specific preferences for either/any gender. So I think if people don't feel the EXACT things they feel for girls as they do for guys, they automatically think they can't be bi.  TONS of people in this thread are telling him he doesn't have to put a label on it, which is true, I respect that, but when did bisexual become such a dirty word? Even on TV all the bi characters ""don't like labels"" which is extremely unrealistic because every bi person I know identifies as bi (even if they didn't at first). It's all a part of sneaky bi erasure which is really depressing."

Besides, I like to provide more concrete evidence than ""we're all just people loving each other"" because while that has nice connotations it doesn't fit for everyone.

No, you are not alone.  Others have discovered that they can enjoy a same-sex experience.  I was one of them 50 years ago.  It was very confusing at the time, but eventully I came to understand my satisfaction with being intimate with other men as well as with women was very natural.    As a culture, we are evolving.

We're currently a month away from our 5th anniversary. I'm not completely gay, but I identify as bisexual.

Just know you ain't alone."
lgbt,3e10a5,hidingonthemoon,34,Tue Jul 21 05:53:23 2015 UTC,"I identify as a straight female. I once had very serious feelings/attraction for a lesbian friend of mine. Once. (Beyond the fleeting ""that girl is hottt!"" or random sexual thought. These were romantic feelings.) I thought I may be bisexual, but nope. As of right now, it's a one time thing, but I don't think sexuality is boxed up nice and neatly like that, anyway. (That being said, I also had a friend try to ""box"" me and say I was definitely bi.

lgbt,3e10a5,eh_politico,25,Tue Jul 21 12:05:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know how common it is because it isn't talked about very much... it's very taboo. I definitely don't think it should be, though. The experience you had sounds awesome, and people should be able to express themselves sexually however they want. Huge kudos that you had the courage to tell him/act on that btw. Basically, a whole bunch of people will tell you this:  Yeah, you're straight, but don't worry about it... you're young! Things happen. All about experimenting.   But I'm going to say this, instead:   Honestly, you're probably not going to find a label that perfectly fits your sexuality. A LOT of people don't. I certainly haven't. Don't feel like just because this happened you have to label yourself as something other than straight if you don't want to, but also don't see it as separate from the rest of your sexual experiences.   I'm your age (but female), and I believe that each of my feelings is (of course) just as valid as the rest. A very similar thing happened to me this past year, but the person in question had a significant other so I couldn't pursue it. My feelings for her were so strong that I immediately thought, ""Gosh, I'm bi! Or pan! Or... something!"" ...But here's the thing: since then, I haven't really been attracted to other girls. Not the way I was to her. For some reason, right now I'm back to boys. And though I struggled with this contradiction at first, I've come to the conclusion that yes, it does matter, and it will always be something that I remember fondly just like my other crushes/experiences, but I'm not going to worry about how it will affect my future actions/thoughts. I've realized that the people I'm attracted to aren't necessarily all in one category. I've settled on ""meh"" and moved on.   This is a really long reply, and it probably says lots of stuff you already knew, but it actually helped ME a lot to write it... so thanks! :) Best of luck, and I hope your future brings you just as much joy as he did."
lgbt,3e10a5,Whizbang,17,Tue Jul 21 04:48:32 2015 UTC,"Huh. I get exactly where you're coming from, except throughout high school I always hung out around friends who were gay or experimenting and it kinda taught me to stay away from labels. Yeah, I identify(ied?) as straight, but that was just because I just happened to fit into that. At this point I don't really feel the need to label myself for personal fulfillment, which I think is probably a good thing in my situation. It really just helps other people understand your emotions better than it helps yourself, which is why when all the other overspecific labeling stuff (tumblr) comes in I think it tends to just make the situation more complicated for everyone involved. And yes, the whole thing is very taboo. I asked him about it, and his words were ""you'd be surprised how often straight guys want to experiment and don't talk about it"". So yeah, basically... meh. Thanks as well. :)"

Who you are, who you see yourself as, what you love, like and hate, will change over your life.  Right now, you may consider yourself straight except where this one friend is concerned. Does a label really matter? It's your life, your body and your sexuality to define as you see fit. If Bisexuality means attraction to women and men, but you're attraction record so far is women and man, you may not feel that sexual orientation label to be applicable. One day you may change your mind.   Sexuality is fluid. You asked if this kind of thing happens often. Yes. We are autonomous beings with independent thought, incredible inquisitiveness and a need for connection with one another. It happens more than you'd think."

lgbt,3e10a5,brauchen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:40:06 2015 UTC,Maybe you (and I) feel that way because somehow it's more socially acceptable for girls? So many straight guys love it when girls make out and therefore when a girl has a crush on another girl but is otherwise identifying as straight it is seen as something cool and sexy. Whereas when a guy has similar feelings they are more likely to repress them since they don't want to be seen as gay.

You can say you're straight except for feelings for this one guy, or bi with feelings only for this one guy. Being bisexual doesn't mean you like both genders equally, it's a spectrum.   On the official question, yes. This happens (as others have said). I'm not sure if I consider myself bi or not yet, but I'm female and I've always liked guys. However I have gotten a crush on a lesbian friend. It's interesting that most of the replies about straight people liking the same gender have been on gay or lesbian recipients."

In highschool I had a boyfriend who I'm still with now. But in the 10th grade,  I had a female friend who I could NOT keep my eyes off of.  She was the perfect friend,  and I was obsessed with her body.  She identified as pansexual.  She'd constantly make jokes about how attractive i was,  and one day I accidentally returned the joke.  Long story short,  we talked about it, ended up fooling around a lot...  It was fun.  The thing was I couldn't see myself being attracted to ANY other girl.  I thought it was a very specific thing.  And that I wasn't going to be attracted to any other girls.    Until I met the next girl.  And the girl after that.  Now I realize that I am very pansexual myself,  and I just find it hard to be sexually attracted to females who I'm not close with to begin with.    It might just take you time to realize it,  but perhaps your situation is slightly like mine, or maybe you just have a very unique ""look""  that you're into for guys"

Most people thing people are 100% straight 100% gay or directly in the middle at 50% bi. It doesn't normally happen that way of course. Most people fall somewhere in the middle. I'm pansexual but myself bi. Truth is is that you might like some men but much prefer women. I normally like women but hey I still like men and other genders. Totally ok.

lgbt,3e10a5,Larcala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:49:30 2015 UTC,"Sexuality is not confined to boxes. Just because you feel mostly attracted to women that doesn't mean that you might feel attraction to a man. Your sexuality should be the overall of what makes you feel good and what feels right to you. But still, if you want labels, you might be bi/pan/omni, whereas the same-sex part would be demisexual. What this means is that you would feel sexual attraction to women and men, but in men that sexual attraction would only happen in the cases where a strong emotional bond exists. From the description you gave, this seems to fit just right, but again, it is 100% up to you. You use the labels you feel like are right to you and you shouldn't let anyone else police your sexuality or your identity."

One of our primary efforts was street outreach to homeless teens to get them into shelters.  At least half the boys we found on the street were gay kids who had been thrown onto the street by their own families.  We saw a similar reality on the suicide prevention efforts.

lgbt,3dxjjq,Staple_Sauce,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:37 2015 UTC,"Having worked with Homeless Teens in San Francisco, so many think it's a Safe Haven for LGBT youth and they flock here. The problem is that they are still kids living on the street, and are going to get preyed on regardless of whether the city is pro LGBT or not. I've seen way too many kids that became homeless, and decided to find any way they could to get to SF thinking it would be a Gay Mecca, only to be pushed into dealing or prostitution once they got here because they hadn't planned beyond getting here.  If you are facing homelessness, PLEASE look for local resources, regardless of your orientation or identification, even if you are in a less than tolerant area. There are often resources for homeless youth, and sometimes even LGBT youth, no matter where you are in the country. Don't put your life at risk chasing a pipe dream until you have prepared yourself.  That being said, if you do find yourself running to a big city, DO NOT join a street family. They can be good people, and I've known quite a few who looked out for each other and genuinely cared, but too many more will push you down a hole of drugs and sex that you may not come back from. Reach out to Homeless services and LGBT services in whatever city you end up in, and get back to trying to make something of your life.  In San Francisco at least Huckleberry Youth Services and Larkin Street Youth Services are two of the oldest and most respected homeless youth providers in the country, and they can provide resources for you to change your life rather than just survive it."

But still, to say homosexuality is not a sin is extremely important, and it's the only right thing to do. It goes beyond tolerance, beyond a sheepish ""who am I to judge."" It paves the way to acceptance, and that is good.   I think the Abrahamic religions and their whole morality are terrible to the point of being unfixable. I would wish for them to go away.

And I don't know why you're asking about the donations? It doesn't say they're doing anything with it, so I assume they're just making a profit (they don't have a non-profit code anywhere that I could see). And, for me at least, I don't really care. I just want transwomen to know that if they need to go somewhere ""for women"" that I will be happy to go with them to make them feel safer or more comfortable."

If you're not into men in real life (as opposed to in porn), just keep enjoying the porn you like and get on with your life (presumably by dating women). If you are into men in real life, hook up with one, or date one, if you want to, or just admire them from afar while you keep dating women.  In short: do what you want as long as you treat other people with respect."

Take the porn away and I still have a fetish with large cocks that I don't entirely support myself. I don't look at guys and think that they are attractive. I can't picture myself doing the things I would want to do with a woman, with a guy. Yet when it comes down to just sexual acts there is definitely 'something' there.  Is being gay or bisexual only a label you can put on yourself if you actually like the same gender entirely? Mannerisms, looks, etc?"

If you're not interested in dating or hooking up with or otherwise being involved with men I'd just stop worrying about it."
lgbt,3e2a84,hyzenthlay1701,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:22:18 2015 UTC,"This doesn't answer your main question, but it might help:  It's entirely possible to be attracted to men and women or even androgynous features in different ways.  The obvious breakdown is romantic vs. sexual (who do you feel an emotional, hearts & flowers attraction for vs. who do you want to have sex with): for example, some bisexuals like sex with all genders, but are only romantically attracted to one gender.  Some people break it down further: ""sensual"" attraction would be more above-the-belt interest, so who you want to kiss/caress, and ""aesthetic"" would be who you think looks sexy.  And you don't have to be attracted to the same types of physical features or desire the same type of relationship: some people might like hyperfeminine women and androgynous men, for example, or might like rough relationships with women but tender relationships with men.  So many combinations are possible, and all of them valid!  Also, just because something is a ""porn thing"" doesn't mean there's a problem!!  It's very common to like something in porn that you don't like in real life, or vice versa.  Porn can HELP you figure out your sexuality, and your sexuality can HELP guide you in finding porn you might like, but they don't HAVE to go hand-in-hand.  (Examples: straight men who like gay porn, and asexuals who like porn.)  Feel free to like what you like in porn, and like what you like in real life, and don't worry if they contradict.  The human brain isn't always logical.  Generally when people describe their sexuality, what they're referring to is their real-life interests; it doesn't mean your porn interests are invalid or any less real, just that it's not the same thing.  I love watching sci-fi but that doesn't mean I want to be a klingon :D  EDIT: I've referred just to ""porn"", but ""fantasy"" might have been a better word, a bit more inclusive."

Give it up completely and after about 6 months or so your sexual desires should be approaching normal.  The fact that you have no desire for men outside porn is a pretty good indication that you are straight so I would trust your instincts there."

To address your first question, it really depends on where you live.  There are some great resources online (maybe /r/makeupaddiciton to start?), but nothing beats trying it out in person.  As far as going to a gay bar goes, yeah, it was absolutely terrifying for me too the first couple of times.  In my case, it was mostly the result of being so scared to come out.  My first time ended up being more awkward and wonderful than I could've ever expected, and I loved every minute.  Finally, you don't owe anyone an explanation when it comes to who you're into.  Frankly, bi guys can get a pretty raw deal - that whole bit about women experimenting in college not really applying to men, and then people calling bi guys out as...not committing to being gay?

So I figured to hell with it, went in and had a couple drinks.  Had no idea what to with myself at first, but I got to talking with a couple great guys, danced a little, and just had a fantastic night in the end.  It was the first time in a long time that I really felt like I got to be myself, that I didn't have to put an act on for the sake of other people.  It was incredibly freeing.

Are you looking to have the style of a drag queen, or more like a ""typical"" woman? (I don't know how to word that any better, ah!) I don't know that sephora could do full blown drag, but they could definitely help with a daily routine/give you some tips. It may make you a bit nervous, though! But if you're comfortable having someone do your make up there, then go for it! Also, /r/drag and even /r/rupaulsdragrace have advice, tips, etc.  2) If you don't have a friend to go with, I'd say check the local gay bars' facebooks and websites to see when they have drag nights, and go meet some new people!

lgbt,3dz589,Troiker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:47:37 2015 UTC,"It may take a while for you to adjust to thinking of her as a girl. Given how we are conditioned in society- to think of gender as existing on a binary- as well as the stigma surrounding trans people, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes you some time to think of her as a woman. There's no need to feel bad about that as long as you treat her like a girl, because she is. I'm trans (non-binary; basically, I feel that I am neither male nor female most of the time) and I still think of myself as female occasionally, even though it causes me dysphoria, because I've been conditioned to believe that I'm simply a girl for my entire life.  My advice would be to approach this as you would a relationship with any other girl but appreciate that there may be certain difficulties and considerations that you will have to be mindful of. At the end of the day, she is a girl, plain and simple. I think if you could express to her that you are interested in a relationship and ask what her reservations are this would be the best way for you two to move forward. As long as you ask her what you're confused about in a respectful way she will hopefully be happy to talk things over with you. Obviously it will depend on what you want to ask her; if you feel that something is too sensitive or awkward to ask, you could always look it up or ask here. Use some common sense, too- don't ask her about something you wouldn't necessarily ask a cis person unless it's actually pertinent to your relationship specifically.  Best of luck :)"

I don't like being ""an example"" of the stereotype; but it is what it is.   I tried to change the way I talk and I think (now) I kind of switch between my ""gay voice"" and ""straight voice"" depending on the type of people I speak to at the time. I usually use my straight voice when speaking with possibly homophobic people or straight guys (because I don't want to creep them out). I know guys are allegedly more and more accepting of gays but it kind of became a second nature by now.  Knowing that gay men and straight women have similar brains, I guess it might indicate that the way they act/talk might be quite similar.

All of those stereotypes are embodied in the meme.

After all, they were only taught to think in school that soldiers are heroic and courageous which is enforced by our culture (movies, tv, etc), which is correct.    But the problem is our society doesn't know enough about transgenders and cant deal appropriately.  So they try to sweep it under the rug or bully them away, ridicule them, or even attack them and kill them.  There is a good reason why the suicide rate of transgenders is among the highest.  To simply living a life takes enormous courage for them and it is just so much easier to die for them.  It shouldn't have to be this way.  But it is the way things are for them.    What Caitlyn is doing is challenging the perception what everyone has learned to adopt for generations.  She is standing in front of the world telling them to respect her and other transgenders because they are simply living to be who they really are.  She is asking for compassion and acceptance.   People call her on social media with all kinds of mean names.  They are angry and disgusted to see a ""cross-dresser freak"" receiving award instead of a soldier who lost the limbs to fight for our country and freedom.  They are ignorant about transgenders.  It is not about beautiful dresses, publicity, or fame.   Yes, Caitlyn hit the nerve of a lot of people.  But that is exactly what needs to happen before we pause and think wait a minute why are we so hateful of transgenders.  Our society needs to exam to find out why it is acceptable to bash transgenders.   We need to root out the source of the hate and correct them.  We need to change what has been taught to us for generations.  It is going to take a while but it is worth it because People shouldn't have to die or live in perpetual misery because of our ignorance.    We are so much better than this.   Edit: words"

Talking to other parents will help enormously when she's ready to do that - which might be in a few days, or a few weeks, or several years. She should join http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tyfa_talk/ (if you're 18 or under) or http://groups.yahoo.com/group/transkidsfamily/ (if you're over 18) when she's ready. They're both fantastic parents-only groups. Frame it in terms of her getting her needs met, not a means to an end where you get your needs met. She's a lot more likely to be receptive to the idea if she doesn't think it's just a ploy to get her to give you what you want. It's hugely important for her to talk to other parents, just as important as it is for you to talk to other Trans folks. It's not healthy for you or for her if you're her only connection to what, to her, is a very foreign and possibly very frightening world. She needs to hear other parents - NOT just you - tell her that you should be trusted to know yourself, and that you are not doomed because you're Trans. Yes, you will find love, yes, you will find a job/career, yes, you will be happy; no, you will not be outcast from society, no, you will not be looked at as a freak wherever you go, no, you will not be alone and miserable forever. Parents worry about that stuff.

If you're attracted to men and women, even if not necessarily at the same time, then you're bisexual. You can be bisexual and in love with someone of the opposite sex. You can be bisexual and in a committed, long-term relationship with someone of the opposite sex, with no intention of having a relationship or doing anything physical with anyone else.  but the problem is, you will face biphobia and you will have to live with that. Even gay and lesbian people can and do discriminate against bisexual people. The best you can do is explain to them that bisexuality exists and it isn't just ""playing both sides"". It's who you are and it's just as legitimate as any other sexual identity."
lgbt,3dwj7a,lysate,2,Mon Jul 20 03:11:44 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've heard and absorbed a lot of biphobia. I'll try and break this down point-by-point.   If you're attracted to men and women, you're not ""gay"" in the traditional sense of ""person attracted exclusively to their own gender"" Being confused about your sexuality is okay. Not everyone is able to nail down their exact sexuality early on in life. I'm 26 and defining mine has been a process. You'll get there. If you enjoy sexual contact with men and women, bisexual is definitely a label you're free to claim.  Glossing over this because I'm terrible at relationship advice. Sexuality isn't defined by the relationship you're in. If you choose to ID as bisexual, then you would be a bisexual man who's dating a woman. Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is hopelessly wrong. Gay & lesbian people can be really terrible to bisexuals. They hear the same stereotypes that straight people hear, and a lot of them form opinions about bisexuals based off of that. You're not ""playing both sides"" and you're not necessarily ""indecisive"" (but if you are indecisive, that's okay too!) Please forgive me for being blunt here. If you open up to this woman about yourself and your feelings and she won't accept that, then you deserve better. Your identity is worthy of respect, and you deserve a partner who will respect it. Attraction is weird. The exact things to which I'm attracted at any given time tend to vary from week to week or even day to day. I'd say that this seems pretty normal. You're simply taking it to a logical step as someone who finds men and women attractive. If you want to embrace the label, then you can be fully bi. That's just as good as being ""fully gay"" or ""fully straight."" You'll be a part of the community just as much as anyone. You may not always get the warmest of welcomes from some parts, but I'd be eager to welcome you aboard, as would every other person who's attracted to more than one gender."

One person's prejudice doesn't define the experience of an entire community or even yours! Don't let someone else tell you how you feel.  My sexuality tends to fluctuate a bit in terms of attraction and it sounds like maybe yours does too... sometimes I'm more into guys than girls, others vice versa. I don't think this is unusual for bi/pan people. There's no rush for you to label yourself- take as much time as you need to fully figure yourself out. You never need to label yourself if you don't want to. Nor is there any need for you to come out, as you're not hurting anybody by not doing so.  Yes, you will likely experience some criticism from both straight and gay people but this is not a foregone conclusion and in all fairness you're going to experience some kind of bigotry or ignorance no matter how you identify. Don't let people force you to change yourself because of that unless you're in danger because of it.

If your in love with a woman, and intend on spending your life faithfully with her, you need not identify yourself to the world at large in any way that is of detriment to your life.  If you know what you are, and what you want, your good to go.  The issue of honesty with others is very real.  I have had bisexual friends who told me they were monogamous and seeking a single partner for life.  The partner could be of either gender.  Just finding the right partner was the issue.  I have also had bisexual friends who shared with me that they felt they must have involvement with both genders through out their life, and required both.  Nothing compels any kind of disclosure of your nature to the world at large, but we are all required to be rigorously honest with the partners we take into our bed.

However MANY gay men i meet instantly attack other gay men who dont act feminine and label them as being fake or self hating. When really they are just being themselves and the insistence that if a gay man does not act womanly then he is self hating is a very hypocritical stance for a gay man to take. People can act however they want to act. Look at orlando cruz worlds first openly gay boxer hes as masculine as they come is he fake? his bf is very feminine so is he self hating? no he is being himself.  Im sick of the gay community asking for tolerance and acceptance from those on the outside and yet dismissing those on the inside who differ from gay stereotypes as fake and self haters. It is BS and really needs to stop.

Everyone always assumes there is a one note approach to everyones life and everyone feels and does things for the same reason. I hid being gay but NEEEEEEEEVER was ashamed of it ever. I found the challenges and hardships that come with being gay to be annoying and bs at times and still do but never hated being gay. Why are we assuming this guy hates being gay because he hid it from family? Oh because thats how it would be for you? and how it is for one gay person is how it works for everyone right? (sarcasm)  I hid it to prevent facing discrimination and difficulties but not out of shame and not out of self hate. So I hope you are not implying that because somebody is hiding the fact that they are gay = they are self hating and ashamed. I know gay men in very powerful postions in very macho enviroments who are not ashamed but would have to give up there career and be homeless if the truth got out and when they retire they will be out. Not everyone hides out of ""SHAME"" or ""SELF HATE"" thats one of the things I hate about the lgbt community always asking others to be open minded while presenting very close minded ways of looking at things through a microscopic lens.  Early civil rights era mixed kids hid being black not out of shame of being black but they and there parents knew that passing for white was a social and economic advantage and served as a protection from discrimination.

People have the right to do what they have to to survive if some people choose to endanger their lives and their future for the good of others then thats wonderful it truly is. If not for people like that i wouldnt be here today. But please your hi horse self ritcheous attitude needs to go. Nobody is obligated to put themselves in bad circumstances just because its what ""you feel"" Is the right thing to do. Once they retire they will be speaking about it and stuff afterwards. But if they choose no to undo 10+ years of blood sweat and tears they poured into a military career by coming out early then dammit I understand why.   Nobody owes anybody anything in this world thats the very first lesson I was taught as a child. And I would NEVER ask anybody to put themselves in a bad position to personally help my cause that is why I have so much admiration and respec for those that do and why I have put myself in unfavorable positions to stand up for what I belive in all the time. But please stop making it seem like everyone is obligated to do so when some people are doing the very best they can just to make it from day to day in one piece.   I can tell your american Do you know people will literally be murdered and killed where they stand for being gay in some places on this earth? Does a 15 year old child in iraq need to come out and be murdered for the cause? Or should he do what he can to survive. That would be that persons choice to make based on how they feel. Your self righteousness is very annoying and extremely selfish.   Heroism acts of valor and nobility, and strives towards making the world a better place are all ""optional"" and you would do best to remember that. If a person does none of those things it does not make them any less in my eyes. Thats why you honor people that make the world a better place and show them respect but dont bash other people for choosing not do do something that is a personal choice."
lgbt,3dvve0,jwgarcia82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:25:17 2015 UTC,"""And nobody owes anybody anything in this world."" You're right, but some of us actually care, aren't selfish, and want to make the world a better place for everyone.    ""I can tell your american"" And? The conversation is about a situation that happened in America.  Of course I don't expect people living in Iraq or Russia to be open, but thankfully there are those that are that are trying to actively change things.  Besides that, you're still trying to divert from the original topic and I won't continue to entertain you.  As I've stated, to change misogynistic societal standards, the only path forward is for those that are against it to not live by those standards and be vocal about how wrong it is.  If you're happy allowing people to step on you and spit on you and treat you like garbage for being who you are, then by all means, live like that.  But you (and the guy that the post was actually ABOUT) don't get to spit on the pride / equality movement when it's done so much to earn Americans that share your strange worldview (and ALL LGBT people in America) the rights that they have."

Not choosing to die for a cause does not make you selfish not giving up your livelihood to scream hey world im gay does not make you selfish pretending to be white when you are black to put food on the table does not make you selfish. Pretending to be str8 to be allowed to play a sport you live and earn a living from it is not selfish. Demanding that someone make a personal sacrifice for something you ""personally"" feel they should is selfish a person making said sacrifice is both noble and heroic but the refusal to do so is by no means selfish.   Being the self richetous selfish individual you are though I see thats something you will never understand stick to posting on reddit because it is very clear you have little to no concept of what the difference is between an obligation and a personal choice. I knew you would dismiss What I said about the child in iraq and that only highlights your naivety and selfishness. What I have posted is something a selfish person could never understand though so I dont expect you to get it."
lgbt,3dvve0,jwgarcia82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:32:00 2015 UTC,"You're the one that started the argument my friend, not me, and I never once said anyone should do any of that.  The discussion was about someone who was being a snot about those that do and saying it's not necessary, when it so obviously still is.    "" it is very clear you have little to no concept of what the difference is between an obligation and a personal choice.""  Only because you choose to read into what I've said and add your own interpretation based off of the fact that you already have a huge bias in favor of perpetuating misogyny.  ""What I have posted is something a selfish person could never understand though""  You mean your idea that is basically ""screw everyone else, I don't owe anyone anything.""  That ""selfless"" concept that you've been spouting off about?   ""Pretending to be str8 to be allowed to play a sport you live and earn a living from it is not selfish.""  If your coming out could initiate widespread change in that industry, then yeah it pretty much does make you selfish.  There have been multiple athletes who have come out and have not had to give up their livelihoods and in fact have spurred dramatic change in their respective industries.    ""Demanding that someone make a personal sacrifice for something you ""personally"" feel they should is selfish""  When did I make any demands? I simply stated my opinion, nothing more.    ""I knew you would dismiss What I said about the child in iraq""  Except I didn't dismiss it, I addressed your comment. You are the one that is dismissing things.  Or you simply can't read... Still not sure which."
lgbt,3dvve0,Gaybrothrowaway222,0,Mon Jul 20 13:38:53 2015 UTC,"How funny and ignorant for you to say ""Only because you choose to read into what I've said and add your own interpretation""  and then say the summary of what I said amounts to ""screw everyone else, I don't owe anyone anything.  "" Please apply some comprehension. I never said screw anybody what I specifically said was nobody owes anybody anything in this world. I didn't say screw people in this world so who is it trying to misquote and misinterpret? I am done responding to you because its clear you either have selective reading skills or are consciously ignoring the entirety of what I post.   Not owing somebody something and saying screw somebody are two very different things your absolutism reflects your self ritcheous hi horse attitude your naive disposition and selfishness very well. You and your very selective reading can be dismissed now.  block has been applied good day"
lgbt,3dvve0,jwgarcia82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:44:49 2015 UTC,"You have said continuously that people that only look out for themselves aren't selfish when that is the very definition of selfishness.  (Granted in life threatening situations and it places like Russia, that's certainly excusable.)    You call me selfish, when the entirety of what I've said is that we should all be looking out for each other and attempting to make the world a better place.  You have your definitions skewed."
