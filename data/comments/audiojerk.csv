Please take a moment and enjoy some True Audio Suggestionstm. I am assuming that money is no object.   1. Audio-technica Ath-m50x  Absolute top of the line. Outclasses every headphone on the market in terms of every facet of sound. Be sure to save some cash by buying them half broken with some jizz stains (from cumming to the glorious audio!) off of Craigslist.   2. Sennheiser HD 650  A great budget option for the beginning audio enthusiast, be sure to pair with a high quality amp and dac. I personally prefer a FIIO E07K  3. Audio-technica ATH-M50X  It really can't be overstated.   4. Xiaomi Pistons  Top of the line IEM performance for my brother gave me a $15 amazon gift card for my wisdom teeth surgery and what do I buy now price.   5. A schiit stack taped to your ears  Some say if you listen close enough, you can hear the voices of sirens, trapped within their silver walls. That is, until you plasti-dip them and post your totally original concept to /r/headphones"

BEAR WIT ME N RIDE IT OUT N AFTER BOUT 8 HOURS ULL BE AMAZED!!! ITZ WORTH IT IF UR A TRUE AUDIOPHILE!!! A little weak on the bass but good sounds. Nvr hurd skrillex sound SO DOPE! Did u know there was squeals in his beats?? Once i put on a set of Beats By Dre overtop to fill out the bottom end and round out the sound I feel like I have my set up 4 life.  Update: My neck hurts.
audiojerk,3ccwkg,SQnotpoo,3,Wed Jul 8 03:38:19 2015 UTC,I've had ATH-M50s since the day they came out and they're the best headphones I've ever heard. I have to disagree with you on the Sennheisers though. I ordered them off Amazon (prime member lol) and listened to one song on them (Stairway to Heaven) and they didn't sound much better than my M50s. I decided to send them back and get a few more pair of M50s in various colors. Best decision I've ever made.

audiojerk,3bexpf,overallprettyaverage,18,Sun Jun 28 23:46:00 2015 UTC,"if you know any thing about sound systems you'll understand that I'm audiophile. Here's why system gets distorted it's not rocket science it basic stuff everyone should know. When in creasing the volume obviously it gets louder louder it gets more power needed to run the system. But like most cheap systems that aren't supplied efficient power so the speaker becomes distorted. Now fancy way of saying is there three different waves of sound lows, mids, highs. There's waves make sound and all work together to create perfect harmony but like anything that's ""perfect"" it's not. So increasing the volume the faster and stronger the waves become but they reach a certain point where if it doesn't have the power the waves go wonky and your music sounds crappy. If your looking for a nice sound system I highly recommend Harman/Kardon. You'll hear music like never before and you won't be able to go back because other sound systems can't compare. Unless you buy big ass Bose home theater(surround sound). Also how all speakers battery life measured is simple take your phone connect it to bluetooth(duh) set it to full volume then set the speaker to half and it will run for 75 hours THEY NEVER MEASURE AT FULL BLAST! Wanna hear a joke I'm 17 and I'm smarter. Technology is my best friend because I can make it your worse nightmare. So check the facts before running that smart ass mouth of yours.
