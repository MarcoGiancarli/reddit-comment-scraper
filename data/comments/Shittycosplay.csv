Shittycosplay,34d73a,DanyyDezeyte,11,Thu Apr 30 05:05:56 2015 UTC,but why did he do that to his face
Shittycosplay,34d73a,ThePizzaDoctor,3,Thu Apr 30 08:48:28 2015 UTC,I think he was fresh off of doing the left two here
Shittycosplay,34d73a,longshot,3,Thu Apr 30 12:43:33 2015 UTC,That really is shitty cosplay

Shittycosplay,34d73a,evolsteve,2,Fri May 1 04:17:56 2015 UTC,He really sacrifices everything to his art
Shittycosplay,33odc0,Worldchanger72,4,Fri Apr 24 04:11:30 2015 UTC,It's not really a shitty costume. Unless it's bad for that character. Just genderbent.
Shittycosplay,33fmu4,joecb91,2,Wed Apr 22 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"Made out of cardboard for a Halloween costume. They are also way too big for it to look realistic, but for the time it took me to make them (about an hour for each one) I was happy with how they came out.  And here is the actual costume using the smaller mask (using a basic Jedi Robe costume and Qui-Gon lightsaber to represent lightside Revan)  Sorry for not adding the [SELF] tag"
Shittycosplay,33f2i2,Flipperbw,7,Wed Apr 22 00:20:51 2015 UTC,"i mean the costumes are pretty much spot on but i dont think the fact that theyre black, overweight or ugly really counts as shitty cosplay though....i mean for what they had to work with physically, the fact that i can look at a group of large ugly black folk and instantly recognize them as a group of semi-magic japanese school kids.....is actually pretty amazing lol"
Shittycosplay,33f2i2,jesse710,7,Wed Apr 22 02:28:46 2015 UTC,Why is this shitty cosplay?
Shittycosplay,33f2i2,icystorm,0,Wed Apr 22 03:09:05 2015 UTC,because OP is transracial-phobic and promoting rape culture and is a cissy shitlord
Shittycosplay,33f2i2,Jack_Hat,3,Tue Jun 16 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"This is a famous cosplay! The set of photos is great, can't believe you didn't post the wonderful ""step up senpai"""

Shittycosplay,31to0x,TooShag,5,Wed Apr 8 02:21:41 2015 UTC,More like arachkid. Im surprised you've never heard of him. He gets people out of sticky and shitty situations.

Shittycosplay,2ddhg4,matrh88,4,Tue Aug 12 21:27:35 2014 UTC,"This is remarkably bad.  Well done.  EDIT: I mean ... The ""helmet,"" the angle, the overall composition of the shot and the background, with its failed ""epicness"" ... Just terrible, terrible, absolute shit cosplay all the way around. I love it!  The ""Optimus Prime"" character itself even seems strangely forlorn over how poorly conceived and executed the whole thing is. Genius!  This should be the banner of the sub."
