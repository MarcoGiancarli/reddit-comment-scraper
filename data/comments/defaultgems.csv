When someone does listen to them they walk all over that person and treat them like dirt.  Also the whole ""whining is really unattractive"" thing is really rich. I have been in numerous conversations with women where in the same breath they tell me to stop whining and then begin whining about their problems.  The truth is women just don't give a fuck about anyone because they don't have to, and they only respect men who do the same.   Unfortunately I don't want to live like that. I want to be good to people but that is apparently incompatible with being treated in kind.  (I am also pretty much a 32 year old virgin though not quite anymore, really, but at this point it's difficult to see the point.

Another is that even if you travel back into the past, you can't change anything, because it's already happened.

Often times they were just out there trying to get away from what they'd been jumped into, forced to join for safety, or were required to by involved family.   These kids simply wanted to get away from all that, and were not yet into it hardcore enough to feel the need to proliferate it at camp; they just wanted to be kids and have a good time.   The worst students were the ones with mental disabilities, or addictions to medication. The worst incident we had was a female student attacking a resident advisor over a hugely escalated issue that the advisor quite frankly wasn't great at handling.   Sure we had one fight once, but it was over a girl. That was the most students we sent home, and the only thing even close to the magnitude of a gang fight.

When Leno and NBC screwed him over, he quit and moved to CBS. Leno and Letterman were bitter enemies for years after that.  For this guy to make such a glaring, obvious mistake calls into question everything else he wrote about Leno.

Check their websites to see if anyone near you sells them, go to all the stores to get fitted, learn their return policy, and if they're able to tailor your bras. Don't go to one store and call it quits. Make a day trip out of going if they're not close.  After you know what size you are, buy some online from herroom, figleaves, barenecessities, or ebay.

Frankly 34DD seems to be quite generous and is probably skewed due to both obesity causing an increase bra size and an increase in the popularity of breast augmentations. I was a 36C before I got pregnant and I am larger then most of my friends (I'm in the UK, but our average size is similar when you adjust for differences in regional sizing).   Additionally, just looking at a pair of 36G boobs doesn't give you the entire picture of their size. They're heavy and they really hurt your back. Pictures are also 2 dimensional and unfortunately don't do much justice to the size. A 36G is going to be really uncomfortable and difficult to manage."

I'm not sure I should even post this. I just think it's interesting how the guy seemed perfectly normal in his original comment and after looking at his other comments he sounds like a guy I would never want to meet.  On gun control: ""See, logic escapes gun grabbers. Because they are adolescent in their desperate need to support their worshiped masters. These people are so pathetic and weak, they need to disarm stronger individuals to please their own ego's. It is like some sick desire to have law abiding, free human beings be put into bondage. It is in itself, psychotic behavior, just on a very pathetic scale.""  On the Duggars: ""It is painfully obvious that all the uproar on reddit over it is because they are Christians, a traditional family, and carry traditional values.""  ""When you are done, I am sure your new holy trinity(marxism, progressive liberalism, pseudo intellectualism) will find another Christian for you to burn. We all know this has nothing to do with Child molestation. You hate yourself some Christians, get a rope!!!!""  On Child Protective Services: ""But man, don't ever defend calling the CPS unless molestation and child labor is a better situation for the kids.""  And a mess of other stuff. He also calls guys that don't like hair on a girl ""down there"" pedophiles. Really, how he says things is stranger than actually saying them. I don't care if he is pro-gun or doesn't believe in global warming, but describing Canada as a ""nanny state"" where ""the masters that are slowly getting their slaves back"" is so... weird.  That's not to completely go against all the shit he's going through, because what you believe doesn't have a whole lot to do with being tricked into having kids with a mother who won't let you exist in their lives. And maybe the mom is a terrible person, or maybe she doesn't want her kids to be around someone who believes ""vaccines are a huge suspect for autism.""

He seems really unpleasant, and also prone to hyperbolic speech (which does make it hard for me to believe everything he's saying). In particular, he grossly mischaracterizes the opinions and motivations of those who think differently from him, which makes me think he has difficulties with listening and empathy. This leads me to think that the relationship went sour in part because the ex got fed up with him, though he makes it seem like it came out of absolutely nowhere. She probably reconsidered whether she really wanted to be tethered to this guy for the rest of her life, and he probably didn't react well to it.

I really don't see the mother's angle on this, or her family's angle/reasons for doing the following:  "" I would literally sit there and hold my daughters while her, her mom, her brother, and her father would mock me. They would laugh at me. They would poke fun at any little thing I did, demeaning me and belittling me. I was called horrible names, to the point I started recording my visits. When they found out, they would make faces, and stand 2 inches away from me. They would literally take turns sitting right across from me staring at me. I had gotten a lawyer, and was waiting for court to hear my case. I wanted to establish visitation, child support, and custody. Until the courts heard my case, I had to abide by her decisions. ""  That requires supervillian-levels of evil. I could allllmost understand one person in a family being that heartless, but the entire family? And the mother just flips her behaviour like a lightswitch according to OP. One minute they're both very much in love, the next she becomes some scheming machiavellian King Joffrey-tier demon from the 12th circle of hell. That's pathological levels of evil, and it doesn't seem rational at all - even if the mother had some sort of a mental disorder I can't imagine one which would make her and her family act like stereotypes of The Most Evil People Possible. It seems like it's written to tick every one of reddit's boxes - evil woman, hard working dad? Check. Spermjacking? Check. Ridiculously unfair child support? Check. Mother using child support irresponsibly? Check. Taking the guy to court over a pet which is a figurative saint? Check. I'm not even saying that all of it isn't true, the guy's vid shows that he does indeed have daughters who love him.

Even if a battery causes depolarization of nerves it doesn't have enough power to burn them out. It just makes them false fire. Sure it can have bad effects if you are doing it across the brain like in tdcs but a battery in the mouth has almost no chance of a main path going through the brain. There may be some transient voltage in surface nerves of the face or eyes but that will stop.

To call this tripe would be an insult to organ meats.     The ""South paid 90% of taxes"" is not exactly true, although I sort of understand the argument he is trying to make, namely that the high import tariffs on many manufactured goods effectively acted to subsidize Northern industry at the expense of Southern agricultural exports.  Which is true, but was hardly the chief cause for the outbreak of hostilities.  The rest of it is mostly bunkum.  The OP is right that the simple ""North good, South bad"" narrative is oversimplified and wrong, but the narrative he supplies is just equally incorrect and misleading, just in different ways.  His explanation of Reconstruction deliberately ignores the fact the fact that even after the surrender at Appomattox, the Union Army spent close to 15 years fighting a counter-insurgency campagin against several loosely-affiliated groups of terrorists, most of whom enjoyed the tacit support of the remaining local elites.

If anyone ever doubts that the civil war was about slavery have them read the Declarations of Secession, that is, the signed documents from the confederate governments listing exactly why they were leaving the united states. Here's a sample from the Texas declaration:   In all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color - a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States.    No racism there, no sir.   I think it's odd that OP talks about how terrible reconstruction was. The collapse of reconstruction in 1876 paved the way for nearly a hundred years of 'separate but equal' and incalculable damage to black americans in everything from lynchings to fraudulent arrests to withheld funding from black schools to the destruction of Black Wallstreet and the red summer."

defaultgems,39kreh,axck,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:12:38 2015 UTC,"The reason is easily understandable, and from a business stand points makes the most sense - make a movie that makes the most money by having the biggest audience.  But somebody who is a fan of the franchise, he would obviously be surprised to hear that the studio intentionally hired people, including the director, who don't seem to like Star Trek.  I was never into Star Trek, so I can't say much about the path the directors have chosen (they did feel too much like some comic book full of CGI & explosions movie rather than something serious that would probably be better). But what I can say, is that every time there's a reboot or a sequel, it is very rare to see a new director taking the franchise to a better path. When they do use the original director who ""gets it"", you get masterpieces like the new Mad Max - same director, and even the the age of 70, George Miller did an amazing job."

When I watch a TV show/movie, I don't really want that. TV/movies, to me, are a much more visceral entertainment type. Visceral might be the wrong word because I am not trying to say it has to be shallow, but my problem with star trek is that the ""deepness""of of the questions they were asking (which, let's face it, while deeper than most crap on TV, wasn't all that deep), as the author of this comment points out, always had to be explained through some ""Shakespearian monologue about the good vs. the expedient or race."" If you are going to make it deep, let me think about it. Don't tell me what to think about it. And certainly don't stop the plot to explain to me what the plot is about. I hate that shit.  I tried to get into it, because so many of my friends liked it and watched it, and I watched plenty.

defaultgems,39kreh,designated_shitter,3,Fri Jun 12 17:57:57 2015 UTC,"This has always been my issue I have with Star Trek fans' insistence on the ""philosophical"" aspects of Star Trek.  They are fairly basic.  Just because 90% of the rest of television doesn't do this, doesn't mean that what Star Trek provides is very deep. Furthermore, its pacing is just not all that suitable to cinema.  I loved Babylon 5, but nearly everything that made it great (political intrigue, unraveling plots, etc.) would be horrible to watch in a movie, and is reliant on a slow burn of characters and events that you have to keep track of over a long period of time.  Anything that is very deep or even moderately thoughtful is not usually something you can successfully convey in ~2 hours without being didactic.  I disagree with you about what I want out of TV/movies, though. There are definitely places for ""hard"" scifi in visual media.  Those places are movies made for ~$10 million that play in limited release, which may or may not make back their money, or long running series as described above."

One that has more to do with how shitty OP's parents were than the actual merits of spanking. I only got spanked up to about 6 years old. I would only be spanked if I had seriously fucked up, and my dad would hug me and comfort me afterwards. He wasn't attempting to inflict damage, and my brain would automatically associate the unpleasantness with the bad behaviour, and thus perform that behaviour less. It worked very well.   None of what I've said should be taken as me declaring that spanking is overall a good thing. It's just an anecdote. And anecdotes, while capable of provoking emotions, are not effective at analyzing overall merits of anything."
defaultgems,38y9u5,morvis343,9,Sun Jun 7 22:24:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I had the same experience. I only was spanked twice that I remember. Never was spanked after 1st or 2nd grade though.

defaultgems,38y9u5,buildabeast,11,Mon Jun 8 12:46:36 2015 UTC,"While mostly anecdotal he raises one important point and that is that parents ""spanking"" their child most of the time do so because they are overwhelmed with the situation and have no other parental resources to deal with the conflict. There are other ways to resolve problems with children and most on them are better than inflicting physical violence (no matter if it's meant in ""good will"").   Spanking does have a negative influence on kids and may leave marks that parents won't even recognize, which is why it is illegal (here in Germany at least).  However parents shouldn't be fooled by the typical ""it never harmed me"" attitude because that's exactly what keeps this kind of ""education"" going. Yes, kids need boundaries and punishment for their wrongdoing but spanking only signals that they shouldn't do anything wrong just to avoid getting a spanking instead of learning the reasons as to why not to do what they did wrong again."
defaultgems,38y9u5,Roggenroll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:47:28 2015 UTC,"But parents are human beings and many of their responses, and those of other adults you interact with as you grow, are a result of their emotions. Part of growing up is learning that those around you are human, with emotions and fuses, and that that's okay.  I'm not saying there can't be a case made, but it's not simply that spanking is an emotional response. More likely you should argue that physical violence should not be taught as an acceptable part of living with other people. When you're an adult people might get angry and you need to know how to emotionally weather that, but you don't have to put up with assault."

My dad spanked me about a handful of times up until I was 7 or 8. He'd sit me down beforehand, explain that I was getting spanked, why I was getting spanked, and why whatever I did was wrong. Then he'd smack my butt a couple times (pants on and nothing to hard) and tell me to go to my room and think everything over. He'd come back like ten minutes later and we'd talk about it (the worst part in my opinion, dude was wordy) and all would be well. Contrast that to my mom, she did most of the disciplining of my brother and I clearly remember her wildly slapping his head over and over while basically sitting on him for not potty training fast enough. I comforted him later by telling him to ignore her because she was just mean, she heard me and slapped the shit out of me too. Then, as she always did when she was beating her children out of impatience, she would come back ten minutes later to hug us and cry and apologize (also the worst part because why the fuck should I feel bad for her when she just started hitting me for no real reason?!)

I was spanked as a child and sometimes it was warranted and properly used to deter my behavior. Other times, it was an abusive power play. The difference was easy to tell. (My mother was an abuser and narcissist. My dad was not. My dad's ""spankings"" were legit. My mother's were abusive.)  The main differential I can think of is, imagine a 2 year-old who wants to put her fingers in a light socket, or on a cold stove-top.  A quick ""pop"" on the ass, with a cupped hand, will usually startle them enough to induce fear over what might happen if they do it again.

Not to be an asshole, but whenever someone starts a whole discussion on Reddit about spanking and abuse everyone is quick to join in on the ""spanking a child is physical abuse"" side. There is a big difference between spanking and abuse. I can't control how someone raises their kids so it's not my place to tell them how to raise them.  I was spanked when I was a kid. I was reprimanded. My parents let me know why it was happening and that it should not happen again. It wasn't for anything unreasonable, I remember I was spanked once for being mouthy and calling my mom a witch (didn't happen again). I'm not fucked up, I'm pretty successful and my other two siblings have had no negative effects from being spanked.  Like I said there's a big difference between a spanking and abuse. Slapping a child in the face is abuse. Spanking their butt for reasonable punishment to teach them a lesson is not abuse.

I didn't play sports but did have PE in high school and can confirm, that's pretty close. I know I've hit the locker room after a game and had a red hand print on my ass.

defaultgems,38y9u5,untaken-username,0,Mon Jun 8 04:48:43 2015 UTC,"Right, sorry I may not have been totally clear. The word ""hurt"" can have different levels of meaning.  In common parlance, ""ouch, that hurt"" will mean something entirely different from ""hurt"" in a legal setting. I'm differentiating between causing a mild, temporary pain and causing lasting damage. You could say hurt for either, but it's wise to steer clear of words that have a range of meaning and stick with something more concrete.   In other words, I don't think it's incorrect to say ""I spank my child, causing mild, temporary pain, but I would never hurt him.""  So back to the original poster I was responding to, he was saying that spanking was violent, and one of the definitions of violent involved the word ""hurt."" In your analogy, if I'm slapped on the ass after a baseball game, I might say ""Hey! That hurt!"" but I'd never say ""Hey!

According to Wikipedia most of the world still allows it, as does Great Britain, [edit: also Ireland,] France, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, and a good chunk of Eastern Europe, though you are right in saying most of Europe has banned it.   they idea of using violence   You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. Sorry to quote a movie there, but it's the most fitting phrase. Violence is simply not defined in any way that can be construed as being synonymous with spanking. Beating, abuse, etc., could be violent, but not spanking in it's proper form.    violence as a mean of control   Yeah, violence as a means of control is called abuse. That can be physical, mental, or emotional. Spanking is not abuse. There are plenty of people who abuse their kids and say they are just spanking, but they're wrong and proper spanking in itself is not abuse.    Your parents should be someone you turn to for help,   Totally agree.    not someone who [spanks]   Let's change that word ""hits"" to ""spanks."" They aren't synonymous, even though you're using them that way. Now let's look at that part of the sentence again.   Your parents should be someone you turn to for help, not someone who [spanks]   Those two things are not mutually exclusive. My kids can and do turn to me for help. My wife turns to her dad for help. He spanked her growing up in a loving and disciplining manner, while her mother was kind of abusive.    someone who hits because they cant convey that you have done something wrong without inflicting pain.   So when my son was about a year old, he understood the word no. He could tell by the sound of our voice when we were happy and not happy. He could even say a few words. One day, he reached for the light socket at my grandma's house. I said ""NO"" in a strong voice. He looked at me and reached again. ""NO"" I said, even stronger. He reached again and received a pop on his behind.   Now please explain to me how you would have sat down with that child, that 12 month old child, and explained and conveyed to him the importance of electricity and how he shouldn't be a conductive material for such a force. Or perhaps, you would take a live and learn approach, allowing him to electrocute himself, sending 100+ volts of electricity through his little heart and just hope to high heaven he doesn't die?   No, thank you. I popped his behind and he never touched an outlet again. He learned quickly that he needs to not touch and to be obedient because we have his best interests at heart.   Now that he's 5, he's obviously an extrovert and loves to play with his sister. We now have 2 punishments available for him: a spanking, or being sent to his room. Far and away the spanking is the least harsh punishment for him. With a spanking, we sit down, explain what's wrong, talk about it briefly, ask if he should get a spanking (he answers in the affirmative), then pop him, hug him, and send him on his way. Total time lost: 1 minute tops, and he straightens up and learns his lesson.   Option 2, we get fed up with him hurting his sister or throwing a toy or whatever, send him to his room, he then proceeds to bawl because he had to leave the family and it absolutely breaks his little brain to away from people for 5 minutes. Best case scenario he leaves the room and goes right back to what he was doing before, unless he's successfully redirected (not likely) or we happen to be seating him for dinner or walking out the door. Worst case he decides to pitch and fit and throw a tantrum while he's in his room, and he only makes things worse for himself.  So yeah, for him, the spanking works about a bajillion times better and faster and he prefers it because it means he gets back to playing almost immediately.   Now imagine an introverted child (like I was). Getting sent to your room isn't a punishment at all! Why, I was almost never spanked. Getting sent to my room was a treat! Oh, you mean I only have to hit my sister and you will not force me to play with her anymore? Sweet deal! Yeah, I wish my parents had spanked me - it probably would have straightened my horrid little ass out a lot quicker.   Here's a great video on spanking by a well respected pastor in the US. You can ignore the parts on Jesus and how spanking works biblically, but the anecdote on raising his kids is still great. That part starts at 3:20.   https://youtu.be/KbZJqhnxowM?t=3m20s"
defaultgems,38y9u5,fluffman86,2,Mon Jun 8 03:28:39 2015 UTC,"Violence is simply not defined in any way that can be construed as being synonymous with spanking. Beating, abuse, etc., could be violent, but not spanking in it's proper form.   If the spanking is not considered violence, then I wonder what your definition of violence is. I think spanking would pretty clearly fall under Merriam Webster's definition of violence ""the use of physical force to harm someone, to damage property, etc."", as I assume that the spank is going to be hard to cause pain, or else it won't really have any effect."
defaultgems,38y9u5,Ruleof2,0,Mon Jun 8 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"It comes down to intent. It's the reason we have the word ""spanking."" A violent act is done with the intent to cause harm. Spanking is done with the intent to correct and discipline and not to damage the child. If spanking was violent then we wouldn't need the word at all, and we could just say we whip, beat, slap, or attack our children. But those words connote violence and as such they are not synonymous with spanking. See the synonyms of violence that I posted above and you'll notice that none of those synonyms relate to spanking in any way.   Now, if you'd like to argue that spanking isn't effective, or that there are better ways to discipline, that's fine. Let's discuss that. If you want to point out that spankings can turn violent or that too many parents say they spank their kids but actually abuse or beat them, then let's discuss that because I know it happens though not to what degree. But to say that spankings are by definition violent is simply incorrect."
defaultgems,38y9u5,fluffman86,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:41:52 2015 UTC,"But you do intent to harm the child, or else they wouldn't react to the spanking. While this harm is meant to discipline the child, you are still causing pain to them, which indicates that you are being violent."
defaultgems,38y9u5,Ruleof2,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:02:18 2015 UTC,"No, again, if you are harming or damaging the child you're doing it wrong. See my long response above with the YouTube link and watch that video. There is nothing violent about that. Check the synonyms for violence. None of those are anywhere close to what happens during a spanking.  Also, calmly causing a measured amount of minor pain is not the same as damaging or attempting to kill someone, nor does it indicate a violent mental state."
defaultgems,38y9u5,fluffman86,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:20:55 2015 UTC,"hits because they cant convey that you have done something wrong without inflicting pain.   You can't convey complex reasoning to a two year old.  You can't to most five year olds.  Failing to convey to a child that throwing a toy at someone's head is bad is impossible when your child is just barely at the point where they are beginning to empathize in the first place.  Failure to convey the point isn't a failure on your part to communicate, it's simple physiology.  The kids brains literally aren't developed enough yet to understand this stuff.  But they understand pain, and can relate cause and effect, and certain behaviors need to be stopped immediately, not after they've done it several times and you've had multiple useless discussions with them where their eyes glaze over and they start daydreaming because they have zero understanding of the concepts you're trying to convey.   ""I threw my toy truck at Billy and got spanked for it.  I don't know why it's bad, but I know if I do it I get spanked.  I won't throw my toys anymore.""  At that age, that's all they need to know because it's all they're capable of understanding.  You expand the complexity of the lesson as they age, but when they're young they respond to unpleasant stimuli, and the more intense it is the longer they will remember it.  You can't take away a toy because they will just find another one and forget the first one even existed after a few minutes.  You can't reason with them.  But you can swat their butt and they will remember.  Once they're older, the spankings stop and the punishments get more nuanced because they can understand them.  Nobody should be spanking their ten year old.  IMO, the cutoff is around 6-7 years old depending on the child, but before that age a measured, controlled spanking is quite simply the most effective punishment for an unruly child.  Just as you can't reason with your dog as to why shitting on your carpet is bad, you can't reason with a pre-schooler and explain emotional harm.  They just don't get it.  Their cognitive functions aren't there yet, but their memories are.  Spanking isn't lack of communication.  When done properly, it's exactly the opposite.  It's pure communication: stimulus->response."

Children before a certain age have little to no ability to discern cause and effect. Trying to explain complex relations to a child, especially one who is strong willed, is nearly impossible. People have this desire to make everyone identical in action and reaction. People are not that way, what works for one child may not work for another and anyone with more than one kid can confirm this."

Besides, it's not being a bully to fight back against an aggressor who has attacked you.  The best way is to wrestle them for a bit since they usually have excess energy to get rid of, but there is not always time for that.  Of course there are other options as well, but do you really think that a kid who is willing to physically hurt an adult is going to respond to a request to ""go have your time-out?""  No, they are bringing it to that physical level because they don't think you will get physical with them, or they just want to wrestle.  Edit: I would also never mock a child in the manner you describe.  Even if I have to punish them I don't believe in doing it verbally (other than raising my voice slightly)."

However, people pointed out this leads to absurdities, e.g., if I'm a masochist and like to get punched, do I get to punch others? So the rule is refined and we get the platinum rule: do to others what they would do to themselves. But this also fails in some cases, e.g., people who want to commit suicide.  The overall conclusion is that there's no ultimate, objective guide to morality. You can't use a single simplistic rule, whether platinum or gold, to deduce what the correct action is in any situation. That's the conclusion to this philosophical debacle.  In common usage, the golden rule is just another name for the ""don't be an asshole"" rule, the observed phenomenon that in most ordinary situations, outside of those specific cases I outlined above, there's one choice which is obviously correct and one where you are a jerk. In this case you're right OP is overthinking this."

If you're in a gay bar, you're presumably in a place where the majority of people you meet are like you, attracted to the same sex.  You can therefore assume that you have a shot; the rest is down to your looks, behavior, conversational skills, etc.  (Just like a straight guy buying a girl a drink at a bar that's not specifically gay.  She might not be going out to meet guys, but if you happen to impress her somehow, you might still have an outside shot.)  Buying someone a drink and then finding out that they don't even like your sex is kinda hard to deal with.  You had the impression that here was a place where you could find other gay guys who were attracted to your sex, but here's this impostor that's only there for free drinks, you don't have any chance at all no matter what you do.

defaultgems,36iqb8,thundersaurus_sex,64,Tue May 19 20:30:08 2015 UTC,"I am a therapist and I work with this. Generally how people get depressed is through a process called negative reinforcement. It usually starts with repetitive setbacks (can be anything, loss of a job, girlfriend/boyfriend, family problems, injuries, cancer and so on). The repetitive setbacks gives the person the impression that he/she is not in control over his or her life and they start to decrease the activities they will engage in to regain control over life. For example, they will stay at home more, perhaps stop working out, cleaning, eating right, and create a more stale enviorment, perhaps just watch netflix all day. This is a short term soloution to create a cocoon where you are in control again, when you only watch netflix (it's just an example, it can be anything else really) there is nothing in your life that can go wrong anymore. The problem with this, and this is where negative reinforcement comes in, is that when you don't do so much during the day you don't get a reason to change your thinking patterns. And since what you think about creates the emotions you have in your body, eventually you will get depressed where you feel numb or nothing. So the soloution is to force positive reinforcement on yourself, where you reintroduce the activities you did when you felt better, or pick up new ones. The key here is to not let your emotions be the boss. Your mind is controlled by two systems (system one deals with everything automatic, and system two deals with everything that needs contemplation, see 'Think fast and slow'). So system one will tell you to keep watching netflix because it wants to remain homoestasis and 'the devil you know is better than the one you don't' so system two needs to be the boss, and you have to get out and do things no matter what you feel about it with the expectation that your state will change if you do. EDIT: I got an extremely positive response on this comment, so I thought I would add that I run a life advice youtube channel where people can e-mail me about their problems and I make videos responding to them, if anyone of you are interested in that just check me out at https://www.youtube.com/user/Raainmaker everything is free and I help everybody that e-mails me. EDIT 2: Thank you for the Reddit Gold kind stranger :-) TL,DR If you do new things you can't feel the way you did before since thoughts actions and feelings are interconnected"

If you have to keep remaking burgers because the customer didn't want onions or ketchup, but they couldn't figure out how to do that on the machine, then you're not really saving money.

defaultgems,35065g,OfficialCocaColaAMA,4,Wed May 6 16:11:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah the soda fountains are the comparison that I was thinking of too. They take way longer. They are only an improvement if there is no line. Have you ever been behind an old person trying to operate one of those? But that's different because we're comparing one customer operated machine to another.  But there have been self checkout lines at retail stores for years. They all need an employee to oversee them and fix them when they do something wrong. I can't remember the last time I went through a self checkout line that didn't have at least one of four machines down. In a retail location, these seem to provide a service by alleviating congestion in the other lines by letting the people with one  or two items go to a separate line.  They'll need to have some customer service in the restaurant, even if the orders are taken by a machine. So we still need to factor wages into the equation.  I stopped in a Jack in the Box in they middle of nowhere California a few weeks ago. They had one of these machines, but I didn't see anyone use it. Everyone was just lined up for the person.  Maybe they'll catch on at some point, but it didn't seem as simple as that user made it seem. This technology isn't new, so why hasn't it caught on yet?"

Yes, its not a 100% slam dunk solution that dosen't require some human supervision, but it is and does reduce the need for human interaction.   They'll need to have some customer service in the restaurant, even if the orders are taken by a machine. So we still need to factor wages into the equation.   Yes, but if you only have to pay two pimply teenagers an outrageous 15$/hour to help with the machines instead of four of them to take orders physically, you are saving around 60k a year. The machines don't cost that much by a long shot."

I agree about the consumer value tradeoff: touch screens are less expensive, but people may not be willing to pay as much for the experience.

It's clear that you're gonna get response only addressing men side. This response is even in line with feminist theory from what you say, it just does not speak about the women side.  So I guess what you're saying is: ""What about the women?""  Then it's a bit ironic because usually it's more ""What about the men?"".  Now to address the attractiveness. Yes men do benefits from attractiveness even if my memory serves me right women behaviors are less influenced by men's attractiveness. The point is more that men's beauty is not culturally a thing so even if beauty does something men don't get feedback about it so in the end they're clueless.  In a broader sense women are reduced to their appearance and men are reduced to their career/role. You could argue that it's better to be reduced to your career/role than looks and I would agree with you but in the end it can still feel like shit because you're still reduced to something that is not you."

To me his response fit perfectly well in the context it's asked.

This answer very well the question asked. If the response is shallow then the question is too.

But of course we are those things... And we are our bodies. What does it mean to be seen as a person and not any of the subparts thereof?   I suppose this reminds me of the Alanis Morissette song Joining You. How can we separate our value from the individual qualities which comprise us?   It's kind like Berkeley's argument against substance: if you say that there is a thing underlying all matter, but divorced from its particular qualities, then what is it exactly?  I remember there was an interesting subplot in Atlas Shrugged relating to this. James Taggart, the railway CEO, began a relationship with a shopgirl named Cherryl Brooks. Cherryl always admired James for his position as CEO and what she perceived as his accomplishments. But James wants to be loved for ""who he is"", not ""what he has done"". In the end Cherryl realizes that James is not a ""heroic being"" and commits suicide.  I have always wondered what to make of that exactly. I always kind of agreed with James' perspective, I wouldn't to be valued solely for my job. But I kind of also see how that is a cowardly stance to take. Because again, if we subtract all of our actions, all of our accomplishments, every good or bad thing we've ever done for which we can be loved or hated, what is left? Just an empty metaphysical concept of the essence of a person, which from a practical perspective we have to accept is nonsense."
defaultgems,34dc7p,DBones90,-3,Thu Apr 30 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"(This is the first reply to my comment that I actually liked and felt like replying to)  I think it depends on how you define yourself. Like if you take away everything but what is essential, then that shows you who you are, but who gets to decide what is essential there? Society? Your peers? Yourself?  I personally think men in general are allowed to be defined by more things than women. There are men who are defined by their social status, their careers, their sense of humor, their looks, their weight, their ideas, their lack of ideas, their intelligence, their singing voice, their speaking voice... you can easily find examples of all of these in movies and TV, and the only thing they all have in common is that they are men.  With women, you can find different shades of women all over movies and TV, but the vast, vast, vast majority of them are conventionally attractive. Before they are a soldier, a defense attorney, a businesswoman, they are first attractive. Their definition is first on the physical and then on something else.  So in other words, going back to taking away everything but what is essential, with guys you can have almost anything in that category. I would argue that people like Ryan Gosling are more defined by their allure and sexiness whereas people like Bill Gates are more defined by their success and social status. But with women, that ""essential"" category always includes physical appearance.  I guess why I find OP's comment ridiculous is because it essentially is, ""Men are defined by what they do, not what they look like,"" which is frankly silly."

He's not saying he wishes men were judged for their physical traits above all, just that it was more culturally normal to acknowledge them at all, because as is, it feels like men aren't being treated as people but more like cogs in a machine. To add to that, even in the rare times it is mentioned it's usually mocked, by men and women. Well dressed man? Must be gay. In shape? Meathead. Too skinny? Nerd. Too fat? Neckbeard. The only cursory attention paid to male bodies is just as shallow as the attention paid to women's, it's just less prevalent. Just as women being judged for their careers is less common. (But still shitty, since it's usually assumed any career women are massive bitches.)  Your job isn't you or your personality, just like a woman's body isn't her personality. Concentrating on any one of these aspects to the exclusion of the others ignores an important part a person's humanity.   Tl;dr  ""Society"" reduces people to simple and incomplete traits and everyone is less for it.  Edited to add: people definitely judged John McCain for looking old, Bush for attempting to look like a cowboy/hick and sooo many people judged Obama's looks in addition to being racist.

The commenter's not saying that these actions are going to make every man suddenly sexy to her, just that she notices them."

So if I'm so hot and can fuck whoever I want, and if men aren't actually attractive to me according to your theory, then why would I bother to sleep with them at all? Why wouldn't I just sleep with other women? I don't want kids, I don't need money or protection."
defaultgems,34dc7p,huyvanbin,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:40:42 2015 UTC,"Because you want to be acknowledged by those whom you deem more powerful, more important, etc. You want to think that you're good enough to be fucking someone who should be fucking someone much better looking."
defaultgems,34dc7p,sailthetethys,2,Thu Apr 30 18:17:35 2015 UTC,Not really. My last three partners weren't more powerful or important than me. General consensus was that I could do much better (and that includes the one that friendzoned me). I typically avoid men of higher status than me.   What I'm saying is women are human and have sex for the same reasons men do. We don't have some hidden Pussy Cabal agenda. We have sex because we like sex. Sometimes we have sex with really hot guys and that's awesome and we brag about it to our friends. Sometimes we fall for cute nerds with bad jobs that still live with their mom and they end up breaking our hearts. Sometimes we get desperate and hook up with a weirdo and then ignore their texts afterward.
defaultgems,34dc7p,huyvanbin,-2,Thu Apr 30 18:31:18 2015 UTC,"Right, because weirdos are sub-human and all that. Nobody cares how the weirdos adjust their hair when they think nobody is looking. Or they do, and they think it's weird."
defaultgems,34dc7p,sailthetethys,2,Thu Apr 30 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to me that you're so offended that I used the term ""weirdo"" when you had no problem generalizing all women as - hell, I don't even fucking know - powerhungry lesbians who just use men for spawn and resources? She-demons who dare to be attracted to men that aren't you? Hypergamous sluts who only like it when alpha men adjust their hair?  I am a weirdo. The men who I am attracted to are weird as fuck. But yes, there's such a thing as too weird. And GUESS WHAT - just because a woman won't fuck someone (or fucks him and then decides she's not interested in a repeat), it doesn't mean she's treating him as a sub-human. Women aren't obligated to fuck someone they aren't sexually interested in. And just because they have preferences and choose to pick some men over others, that doesn't mean that they're all evil harpies that are just thirsty for egg fertilization and validation. Sexual rejection isn't an injustice perpetrated by women onto men, it's just something that happens to both sexes.  For the record, I spent most of my life being the outcast. I know what it's like to be rejected and I know that it sucks. But you can't take that personally. I was rejected because I wasn't attractive enough and didn't fit in. I improved my appearance by a lot and become more confident, which made my personality more appealing. I still deal with rejection, but that's life. Men have preferences just like women do."
defaultgems,34dc7p,huyvanbin,-1,Thu Apr 30 18:52:10 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're saying so many mean things about women. I just said that they generally aren't attracted to men for their looks.

Not to mention that ""all these multitudes of things we can do to keep people safer"" are costly and prevent the whole ""basic right to drive"" entitlement mentality western society as a whole currently subscribes to.  There WILL be gradual increases in safety measures, and the story even talks about them! Cars that brake preventing collisions, lane minders, blind spot indicators are all progressions toward autonomous vehicles.   In the same way, there will be progression towards autonomous cars being the only way to drive and manual liscence no longer being issued- exactly as the anecdotal story alluded.   Not to mention, the progression is not false choice at all, but the least effort regulatory change for the most positive effect.

Such decisions might actually be made by people with your safety somewhat in mind but they ignore completely the emergencies that you might suffer locally. It is dangerous to drive in a blizzard but it is more dangerous for you or a relative to run out of diabetes supplies, not have a way to get to emergency services if someone suffers trauma or evacuate if your house is destroyed. I wouldn't even want to think about what happens if there are fires during a riot.

defaultgems,33hg11,wh44,7,Wed Apr 22 23:58:36 2015 UTC,"Now I remember why defaults were taken off /r/bestof. Crap like this kept floating to the top.  The NSA is a big ear pointed out toward the world. It's job is to collect foreign intelligence and report them to other agencies purportedly stop threats the to the US. It would be unproductive to actively use that tool solely against everyday Americans, especially for blackmail, because it's blatantly unconstitutional, and not to mention illegal It'd be simple to remove someone from office for that.  The NSA has no field agents, no arrest ability, no ability to take action on anything it collects. All its mandate permits it to do is observe and report. It's like being deathly afraid of the nosy neighbor.  There are better tools to use, like the FBI and CIA. both have a mandate to operate inside the US if necessary, both can get investigation warrants at the drop of a hat with a pretty simple excuse- (you're involved in a cyber attack!), and both have the internal infrastructure to do that kind of nasty thing. The CIA is the best because it's an independent agency, not a branch of the DoJ like the FBI, and the DoD like the NSA, and has whole bunches of rough men and women well trained and willing to do nasty things like meet senators in the back of limos and make them offers they can't refuse.  Then again, who, pray tell, is getting the benefit from all this? Who is the person or people at the top of this conspiracy? Remember the government comes in two flavors, and they don't like each other, no matter how much 'they're all the same' stuff people try to pass off.  There is no blackmail on the planet that has as much value as impeaching a sitting President. That's one for the record books. So if the President was committing mass crimes against the American people and then specifically against members of it's own government, you can bet someone would get it in their head to go for the gold and reveal that stuff to knock down the Presidency.  When you sit down and actually look at this kinda stuff, it doesn't make sense. Nobody benefits from writing security letters and getting FISA warrants to look at your stuff. The CIA has people that will come into your house log into your computer in person and copy the contents of your hard drive and you'd never know it. The FBI can bust in with 12 guys in black armor, take your electronics and by the time you lawyered up enough to get them back all the value would be sucked out of them.   They (whoever 'they' supposedly are) don't need the NSA to be tyrannical. They don't need FISA warrants and USA PATRIOT ACTs to do really bad things. The power people fear them having they already have.  And that's just the non-covert agencies. There are parts of the US intelligence community whose activities are so dark that most people don't even know or care they exist. They have black budgets and completely classified operations, they're so secret that nobody in the organization talks about the organization outside the community. If they truly were turned in toward us, we'd likely have zero defense and zero recourse, because you can't fight what you can't detect.  Not saying the boogeyman may not be real, it's just that people are calling the wrong organization the boogeyman because of counterterrorism tactics, which is probably just what the orgs that could really do this would prefer."

There's a huge number ""social fear"" issues that we kind of pick up in school (where everyone knows everyone else, and everyone remembers every stupid thing you do forever, because kids are assholes) that simply don't scale to the real world.  That time you dropped a tray in the cafeteria and people gave you shit about it for three years? You learned from that that you have to be careful about everything you do, because people remember stuff forever.  In the real world, your fear tells you that because there are more people the risk of screwing up is greater because there are more people, and you have to be more careful and more aware of everything you do.  In fact, the opposite is true. Yes, there are more people, but they neither know nor care who you are and they'll never see you again in their lives. Even once you understand and appreciate the mistake in your thinking, you've still got the habit of reflexive fear ingrained in you.

defaultgems,30rdar,Amberizzle,7,Mon Mar 30 01:32:14 2015 UTC,"While this is a good answer, it's even more complicated than that. I knew for two years that I had to get out of my relationship. I even tried a bunch of times.   Your abuser knows how to manipulate you. Even when you've gotten to the point that you know you don't deserve their treatment, they know how to push your buttons and make you stay. I always went back because taking the day-to-day mistreatment was FAR easier to deal with than the emotional warfare I faced if I tried to leave. I had to built my strength up for it, because I knew that if I wasn't strong enough, I'd just go back again.   In the end, I left him for something minor. My weakness was guilt - I am extremely softhearted and hate to hurt anyone. The big offenses that I'd eventually forgiven, he was able to muster up enough remorse and sorrow to make me cave. Having a grown man cry in front of you, one that knows you better than anyone else and who you share so many memories with, and beg you to forgive him - it's a difficult thing to harden your heart to. Toward the end of our relationship, I would forgive him not because I genuinely thought he'd do better, but because I just couldn't take the guilt of hurting him. I held on hoping another opportunity would come where he would no longer be so remorseful, and I'd be able to hold my ground.    When he realized I was serious about leaving him for the minor event, he was so shocked that he wasn't able to turn on the waterworks and the remorse quickly enough. Usually, if it got really serious and he knew he'd fucked up, he'd threaten to shoot himself in front of me. This time he thought I was being silly and childish, since I'd forgiven him for much greater offenses, so he threatened to call my parents. He misjudged the situation and used the wrong emotional weapon, and that's main reason I was able to stick to my guns and get out."
defaultgems,30rdar,sailthetethys,17,Mon Mar 30 16:51:22 2015 UTC,"I really hate the question ""why didn't they leave earlier?"" Because it just shows no empathy for the victim. Thank you for the post."
defaultgems,30rdar,jenjen3252,12,Mon Mar 30 05:25:53 2015 UTC,"Even when it's genuine, it kind of irritates me. Like, Really? Just leave? Wow! I didn't even think of that! I could have just left. It's really that easy!  Don't you think we've thought of that? Dreamed of it? Wished on a fucking star for it? It is almost never, ever that simple.  For psychological reasons. For emotional reasons. For financial reasons. For having-nowhere-to-go reasons. For having-a-shitty-support-system reasons. For he-or-she-will-kill-me-if-I-leave reasons.  I get it. Some people are curious, and it's not like I'll bite their head off for asking. But it's a question that makes me anxious, because you never know if, after you've explained everything, they're still going to grill you on why you didn't do X or Y to get yourself out, even if it's something extraordinary that very few people could do.  As if it's your fault. All the while never asking what the hell was wrong with your abuser and why they thought it was okay to do that shit to you, or to anyone. It can be very frustrating."

That's the reason people have to hear about a lot of things, emotional abuse (and things much nastier) included. I wish I knew about it earlier - the earlier, the better. I could have helped a friend if I did. She's stuck with a narcissist of a guy, living with a narcissist of a mother, completely without the know-how of getting the hell out of that shithole. Now we're far apart, both in social circles and trust, and there's nothing I can do.  I feel like there ought to be a new school subject: applied psychology. ""How to spot emotional abuse"", ""What is friendship"" and ""Why people hate"" are all useful lessons in life. It's odd we never teach them."

defaultgems,30rdar,derleth,18,Mon Mar 30 06:53:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on how it's asked. Some people are genuinely curious. Others use it as an accusation.

You shouldn't have let all this happen."" Which implies the victim is to blame for their situation.  Sadly, it's most often the beginning of an interrogation on why the victim didn't do more to escape than it is a genuine question."

Example of a widely used variation   Dear Friend, I am pleased that this letter has reached you safely. I was given your name as an honourable and upright person to do business with.  Let me introduce myself; I am Umsloppogas Adinga a barrister working in the Nigerian inheritance court and have been assigned to the estate of a Mr Bates who has left an unclaimed estate totalling £10,000,000.  If left, the money would revert to the government and I want to get the money safely to a western bank account. If you will forward me the taxes for this purpose, I would be happy to render 10 per cent of the estate to you as a fee for helping me .with this transaction.   It's not even close to thin it's almost exactly on point just a different variation  There are over 500 variations of this exact scam that are widely used, if you don't see the relevance you've gotta be either thick skulled as hell or be actively trying not to see/admit to the extreme similarity   can't receive the money without your help  need you to send x amount so I can claim it  will split  x% with you if you help me claim my rightful fortune   It's the entire foundation and all the key points of the scam but in a situation where it actually turns out to be the truth and not someone just trying to get money out of you, but instead actually needs your help and is willing to pay you if you do so"

I'm not actually aware of any version in which Joe Chill becomes the Joker.  The Joker himself doesn't really have an established backstory. It's actually sort of part of the character that nobody (Possibly including himself) actually knows who he is or where he came from."
defaultgems,30jlc3,poon-is-food,2,Sat Mar 28 04:47:46 2015 UTC,"It's indeed part of the appeal of the Joker.   All the other Batman villains have an identity that Batman either deduces from evidence and research, or already knows. They have their origin stories, their motives, their M.O., their oddities and compulsions.   Joker on the other hand doesn't fit this frame of reference. He has no real origin story (he makes up a new one every time he's asked about his past), no clear motivation aside from butting heads with Batman for fun, he has no real compulsions, his M.O. (though largely constant) adapts to the soup crime of the day and his oddities are largely focused around his clothing style and the way he dresses and styles his gang, weapons and gadgets.   The man is a complete enigma, as is where he learned all the things he does and where he gets the money to fund his campaigns and weaponry."

defaultgems,305sj4,SuperNinjaBot,4,Thu Apr 2 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is, you put yourself in that situation by not prioritizing whatever you were late for. Yeah, maybe something out of your control happened last minute, but that happens often enough in life that you can and should expect it and plan accordingly.  Have as your goal to finish and turn in your assignments early, that way you have a margin of error if something happens to prevent you from doing it on the last day before the deadline. Leave earlier in the morning than you strictly have to, so you can be on time if there's traffic or your viechle breaks down. And so on.  Almost no matter what happened it could still have been within your control if you had made it a higher priority and put it ahead of other things in your life. That's why it's still your fault even when something unexpected happens. That's why the excuse doesn't matter.  And above all, if something happens that stops you from keeping your obligations, let people know as soon as possible. Don't wait until after the fact to explain yourself, do it as soon as there's even a potential problem. That's the difference between an explanation and an excuse."

This is fucking retarded. You leave home every morning at say 6:30, get to work at 6:45 for your 7:00 job, and one day there's an accident on the road that only allows you to work at 7:30. What the fuck are you supposed to do about that? Start leaving for work at 6:00? Incredibly ignorant advice.  I stopped reading here."
defaultgems,305sj4,derGraf_,3,Wed Mar 25 04:17:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on the job. If it takes you 15 minutes to get to work, and you absolutely positively have to be there at 7, leaving at 6 every day is probably a good idea.  99.9% of people don't have those jobs. For the vast majority of people, it's good enough to just call your boss and tell them you'll be late. Most of the time your boss isn't gonna be angry because they wanted you to be the person who pressed the button that activated the widget or whatever, it's because they're considering whether or not you'll be there at all that day and whether or not they have to call somebody else in to replace you. It's the uncertainty that bothers them, not because you're irreplaceable and life can't go on without you.  For me, personally, I just don't give a shit. I'm non-punctual as fuck. So I actively look for jobs where it's not at all important to be on time. My commute is 45 minutes on a good day, 2 hours on a bad day. On more than a few occasions, I've looked at the giant red line on Google and just gone to IHOP, because it didn't matter whether I'm on time, it only matters if my shit gets done. And I can get my shit done just as easily at 7 o'clock at night as 7 o'clock in the morning."

defaultgems,2ziqi3,ChickinSammich,5,Thu Mar 19 02:58:55 2015 UTC,"This feels quite Dan Brown'y to me. The chain of events makes sense, but the ending goes into the abyss. ""What happens now?"" - ""What must"". Does it make any sense to everybody? Granted, I haven't read the Bible, so I may be missing some sacral point that mirrors the life of Jesus back then.  Why Aramaic, may I wonder? I have troubles computing how Son of God would have problems with languages. Why would he spawn with no knowledge of the modern language he'd require to use to preach properly, if (and from the image of God, I presume it is the case) it was known beforehand that Jesus would appear in Jerusalem again?  But that's the language fan in me speaking of a small inconsistency that might very well have an answer I'm not seeing. What really took me off was the style of telling. I have quite vivid an imagination, but it requires a solid storytelling in order to parse the events properly, otherwise it becames - as it did - a mess of facts. One second she's running, the next she's already there and back to the car she walks, then she sits on a bench in front of the Sun and thinks profoundly...  I understand how it may require such a fast pace. For me, it's both the beauty and the logical nightmare of the story. Still, if you were to portay such important events as The Second Coming (which, apparently, is the most important of them all, though I may be wrong), I believe you're better off with pace more calm and description more thorough. It might be solely my perspective, grant you: I can only comprehend events properly when they're described with as much details, as if a movie was being transcribed - that's how I write, too."

Apparently fire isn't good against them, and air can't even hurt them and they can go long enough without food to break through the dirt and metal walls the earth benders could make and continually repair."
defaultgems,2xkpxv,Tonkarz,1 point,Mon Mar 2 09:12:30 2015 UTC,"Air at least couldn't hurt them because air bending in general lacks ""hurty"" moves. This is one of air bending's major weaknesses vs the other elements.  Sure, they could toss zombies around, but they'd have a hard time killing them directly through air bending.  Fire bending on the other hand would do very well against zombies and kill huge numbers of them quickly and efficiently. So would Earth and Water, for that matter. Water especially can decapitate large numbers of zombies with not much effort. Zombies don't dodge and water bending is full of versatile razor edges made of water."
defaultgems,2xkpxv,Combogalis,1 point,Sun Mar 8 13:12:01 2015 UTC,Airbending has plenty of ways to hurt people. It's just that airbenders are less likely to use those as they prefer nonviolence when possible.  I see no reason an airbender couldn't make a very thin layer of air highly pressured to act like a bullet or blade. Or make a tornado that would turn everything in it into a deadly weapon fast enough to pierce bone. Or fly them up high enough in the air that they would die of impact on the way down. I think the airbenders would be more willing to use brutal tactics against undead.
defaultgems,2xkpxv,Tonkarz,1 point,Sun Mar 8 22:07:31 2015 UTC,"I see no reason an airbender couldn't make a very thin layer of air highly pressured to act like a bullet or blade.   Because air bending just can't do that. You can't make air ""hard"", because it's air (and if you could, why didn't Aang or any other air benders on the shows ever do this? There were times when air benders were trying to kill someone, or just times when it would be useful).   The bending forms were deliberately balanced against each other irrespective of what the user is willing to do. If you could do that, then air would be far superior to fire and water and probably even earth. Like, air benders would have conquered the world centuries before the show takes place.  Air bending does have ways to hurt people, and they involve tossing people around or suffocating them - neither of this things work against zombies."
defaultgems,2xkpxv,Combogalis,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:51:18 2015 UTC,"Air doesn't have to be made hard, just a thin stream, same as water. Thin enough at a high pressure and it can cut through. I already explained why, because airbenders tend to be peaceloving and gentle. They use airbending to defend, not attack. And more importantly, this would just be too brutal for a kid's with no blood in it.  Waterbending should be able to do the same thing, and metalbending definitely can. Just because we haven't seen something in the show doesn't mean it can't happen. In the original series, and the first few seasons of Korra, nobody had used suffocation. If it had continued that way, you would probably be saying that it couldn't be done because nobody had done it."
defaultgems,2xkpxv,Tonkarz,1 point,Mon Mar 9 01:13:34 2015 UTC,"No, I would be saying that it was theoretically possible given what was seen on the show already (as, in fact, I once did)."

defaultgems,2vcl66,Fibonacci35813,35,Tue Feb 10 01:07:47 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying that I don't disagree with the premise that there are different thinking styles, and that critical analysis and ""listing"" can be two of them. However, life is so much more nuanced than just a simple dichotomy, and much more than 10% of the population has access to the supposedly rare gift of critical thought. It seems /u/jaeldi agrees.  Surely most people reading this will identify as a critical thinker, but the poster says maybe ""1 in 10"" really have that ability. Then notice the top replies are from IT people. Technology today is advancing much more quickly than at any point in human history. These ""list people"" are learning more in their lives than 95% of people in any previous generation before 100 years ago. Nearly everyone is adaptable and creative, but there is a limit for everyone (and is highly dependent on background, education, etc.).  reddit was built by the programmer/IT types, and the demographics still skew that direction. So obviously, as the most accustomed to computers, most everyone else will seem dumb by comparison, and need lists to help them through an unwanted and (to them) ungainly addition to their lives. The constantly changing UI mentioned in the post would, naturally, be confusing for users who are forced to adopt a this new tech.  Here's an analogy: Economists realize that an economy based heavily on fashion design is actually the most productive and egalitarian. Numerous studies emerge showing that worker happiness, job completion, and customer satisfaction could all skyrocket if employees spent half their time designing clothing that makes everyone else happy. 10% of the population (aspiring fashion designers) is thrilled by this idea. The remaining 90% resign themselves to the fact that this is now a part of their lives, and they need to put forth at least a minimum effort. IT techs are forced to design casual office wear, ""for the nerd on the go,"" for most of their time, and do their actual old job in the few hours they can find in their schedules. Would you actually dedicate lots of time and effort to learning how to be a good fashion designer if you weren't passionate about it? The managing designers try to train you, but it's just horribly boring. You know you could put in some solid work and become good at it, but if you just follow the list you can get the designing done and go back to the job you're passionate about.  So, ok, maybe 1 in 10 people is that passionate about computers, but that doesn't mean those other 9 don't have their own lives and ambitions! How many of you could manage, with only on-the-job training:  playing a competitive sport  blacksmithing  roofing  being a typist  calligraphy  arguing on the internet (ok everyone)  The point being you may be good at some of those, and care about them, and be the best damn typist in the pool, but people are different, with different interests, and if you find yourself in a job you are passionate about, surrounded with at least some people who feel like you do, count yourself lucky, because 90% of people would rather be doing something else.  TL;DR: Obviously you're not passionate about reading, skip to the bit where I provided you with a list at the end."
defaultgems,2vcl66,Vadersays,10,Tue Feb 10 06:26:51 2015 UTC,"Trank you for your thoughtful response. The Fashion comparison was perfect.  Yet, I still would say that some types have an encyclopedic approach to knowledge and some have a system based approach. And of course a lot in between. I know I could never (happily) study medicine or law because to me it is just too many ""random"" facts that need to be memorized. My mind just does not work that way. Complex processes or algorithms where you have different abstraction levels and logic helps in tearing it apart and reconnecting it - no problem.  I think tax -that's what the op works in- is similarly a magnet for people with an encyclopedic approach. It just so happens that the people On that level in that company had a certain kind of education, but I don't think education or intelligence has anything to do with it."

defaultgems,2vcl66,Vadersays,6,Tue Feb 10 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"And I think the corollary is that in a new environment, we are all ""list people"".  Take a vaguely computer literate person and introduce him to a new task (like writing code in Visual Studio), and he will quickly need a list.  Later, he will look around and experiment, but the start is always the same.   Not to mention that as technology increases, even smart people just don't want to waste time learning a new system.  They want to get X task done, so that they can move onto what they really need to be doing, what they care about.   IT people often fail to realize that computers aren't everyone's hobby."
defaultgems,2vcl66,jmottram08,6,Tue Feb 10 07:11:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that everyone starts off with lists, but I disagree that everyone eventually moves on.  Many people get comfortable with their list and never move on to the exploratory phase.  Take my mother for example.  She's a very intelligent woman in many aspects of her life, but she still maintains a list next to her computer about how to create a Google calendar invite, how to check her email, how to do certain formatting tricks in Word and so on.  In contrast, my uncle - her older brother - just has to be shown once how it's done and then figures out most of the rest himself through idle experimentation: much like the rest of us.  Both of them have about the same level of interest in computers: that is to say, not a lot.  However, where my uncle will be content learning and exploring the computer systems I show him on his own, my mum insists on having a list of instructions for every possible task you can execute on the computer, much to my frustration."
defaultgems,2vcl66,PostalElf,6,Tue Feb 10 08:41:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, I see your point.  Some people are okay with experimenting, others are not.   My grandmother was hugely anti-technology, but getting an iPhone really helped... she was very happy that pressing the one button would always get her back to the main screen. I told her several times that she couldn't screw it up, and no matter what she did, pressing the button would get her back to familiar territory.   With that safety net, she explored quite a bit and learned things.  Granted, she only did this when she was sick in bed for a week and had nothing else to do... but she did do it.   So I think a part of it an individual's valuation of risk vs reward.  If the risks are low, people are more likely to explore.  Many people know that you really can fuck up windows, so they are afraid to explore it, even though they know that it would be better if they knew more."

defaultgems,2vcl66,mrpopenfresh,4,Tue Feb 10 14:34:51 2015 UTC,"I think what /u/rhombic_pentameter was getting at, was that you don't always get a list to follow when googling a problem.  You get a similar problem with corresponding solution, and you have to use your critical thinking skills to determine if this similar problem is related or not, and then most likely modify the ""list"" solution to fix your own similar problem.    A lot of times I can get a completely useless error message, like the famous ""Error: Unknown Error"".  But by wielding my google-fu I can get myself pointed in the right direction for tracking down the underlying issue. That's where in IT you stand out against your peers who are only able to fix a problem if its fully documented solution is a quick google search away.   This is why troubleshooting is sometimes called an unteachable skill.  The really good ones at it are good abstract and critical thinkers who understand how the underlying system works.  It is possible to reduce troubleshooting to a list-like process, and that's what you get when you call your cable companies tech support."

In order to solve computer problems, you need to have a deep understanding of the structure of the tools you're using, the platform you're running on, the task that needs doing, and the many ways a problem could potentially be solved.  Only once you've got all of these does ""googling shit"" even make any sense. How do you know what to google? How would it apply to what you're doing? What if it doesn't work, what do you do?

defaultgems,2vcl66,rcadestaint,2,Tue Feb 10 11:55:56 2015 UTC,"I think that in order to be a ""critical thinker"" you need to understand what you're thinking about. I am definitely not a list person when it comes to computers, because I've been using them for most of my life and my career is essentially built around grokking how they work. I can very quickly come up with solutions for a given problem and have no problem dealing with change. Just tell me how it's different and give me a little while to work the muscle memory out.  Now, ask me to cook something. I don't understand how cooking works. I get that when you heat stuff up some sort of chemical reaction happens and that makes the food tasty, but I have no idea why or how. If you give me a problem then yes, I'm never gonna come up with a solution. At best I'm going to use my computer skills to hope somebody else has made a list to tell me what to do. And I can do that, if you give me a comprehensive list then I can cook something and it'll be tasty, but I still don't know why. If I have to swap out an ingredient I'm fucked, because I don't know if it'll work, if it'll break whatever made the food turn into something yummy, if it'll catch on fire or cause the rest of the food to catch on fire, or whatever.  I think reducing it down to ""critical thinkers"" and ""list people"" is unnecessary and implies that some people don't think critically. We all think critically when we have the mental tooling to do so, and we all need to be told what to do when we don't understand what we're doing. I may never learn how to cook. I'm trying, but I don't get it, because I have no real foundations to come from and honestly I don't really care about cooking, I just want something tasty. I don't think that makes me stupid, and I don't think it should make somebody stupid if the case were reversed, and they just wanted to get their spreadsheet done."

However, I do a lot of field work with the, as you put it, ""'at least have a high school diploma or GED' types,"" and we also have some of them working for our company doing manufacturing . . . and I get along well with them.  As often as not, better than other engineers.  I've never had to mask my ""critical thinking"" from them nor ever had to make myself look like a ""list"" person.

Many a night out drinking at the bars with them.  (This is where I sound like a dick)  The way you phrase this here, it honestly sounds to me like you look down upon them.  It's like you are smart enough to understand them, but they are not smart enough to understand you, thus you, being the smart one, have to be more like them.

Problem is most cops don't give a shit.  They get called to the bars enough times as it is.  Plus, with how easy it is for a guy to dump a pocket full of roofies in the trash, it's hard to prove that's what he did or was doing.  So unless it's on tape, what's the point in calling the cops?  Plus most bar cameras are on registers, no the bar patrons."

defaultgems,2uya91,vbm,13,Sat Feb 7 11:32:44 2015 UTC,"Did a similar thing but as a patron.  Back in the early 00's I was at a club in Pittsburgh.  The bar in this particular establishment was rectangular with a pair of bartenders working the inside and barstools around the outside.  Anyway, the waitress's attire for this establishment all wore lingerie (anyone remember ""TOUCH""?).  Anyway, greasy douche-bag is working on this bottle blonde all night.  At one point she excuses herself to the little girls' room.  I notice the guy slip her a roofie.  I motion to the bartender and tell her what's up.  Now, remember when I said the waitresses all wore lingerie?  Here's where that little detail comes into play.  She tells one of the floor girls to do a ""pass by.""  The floor girl is in a white corset, garter, and stocking set with at least 6"" ""fuck me heels"" on.  As she does her pass by of the douche bag he locks eyes on her ass and does a full 360 as she goes by.  While he's preoccupied bartender switches drinks.  Minute later girl comes back none-the-wiser.  By the end of the drink the guy is not feeling so hot and it hit him.  He gets up and stumbles his way across the bar.  At this point the bouncers knew what was up and as he stumbles they proceed to ""help"" him outside.  As he gets bounced he lands right into the side of the waiting squad car.  Oh, and bartender comped my drinks for the night and gave me a VIP pass for the next time I came in.  TL;DR: At the bar, saw a guy slip a roofie. Told bartender and she switched drinks.  Guy ended up in cuffs and I got my drinks comped."

Imagine you were the client, and creative had this as a posssible campaign, but they told you 'we're not using it because it was posted on Reddit'.  You'd fire them in a heartbeat.    While it isn't out of the realm of possibility that someone from the creative team had read the comment and simply said 'let's use this', it certainly wouldn't logically follow that their story about how the ad came to be would go 'I saw it on Reddit and thought we should use it'.  Honestly, it's business.  Creativity doesn't necessarily mean originality.  This ad stuck.  I had chills.  I know so many people did too.

defaultgems,2uhoca,cos,2,Tue Feb 3 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"If that were true, calling BS on them for talking about the source without mentioning the reddit comment as the source, is not a criticism of using sources such as reddit comments, nor is it passing judgement on the ad or their concept or work on the ad.  So your comment is still shooting at a target that's not there.  However, it's entirely possible for the article to screw up reporting on something even if the people they interviewed didn't.

I have done this for the financial sector which is why I guessed 7 years, but looking at some jurisdictions it seems like 1-3 years is not uncommon for police records.

I've been an active user for about 6/7 years (previous account deleted as the username was my real name and the site got too popular).   The signal to noise ratio has noticeably changed for the worse, and while it may not sound like a big deal if you never experienced 'old school' reddit comment sections, a lot of people in the linked thread have testified to the effect it has had on the general quality of the site.  Like it or not, every asinine one-liner you post lowers the chances of a decent comment being seen and upvoted, distracts people from good comments, and can actually put people off even putting in the effort of writing a serious, in-depth reply.  There are currently five comments in this thread, of which one is a sarcastic one-liner that perfectly summarises the problem:   Yeah, people sharing their opinions about things is just bad for everybody.   When comments like this get in early, and early comments are the most upvoted, people get the idea that because they personally don't 'get' or agree with a post, they can dismiss it without making any kind of argument or contribution and be rewarded. It legitimises what is generally referred to as shitposting.  Without the community holding stricter standards to comments all the time, the quality of comments will inevitably decline over time. Reddit was initially successful because the voting system allowed the community to hold itself to a certain standard. It's what set the site apart from the likes of a standard php forum or YouTube.  The demographic changed with the increasing popularity of reddit and the new mainstream nature of smartphones and commenting on the internet- it  got large enough to continuously favour this intellectually lazy style of discussion (even if it's only ""some of the time and not hurting anyone""). It fundamentally killed what attracted the kind of people who just wanted drama-free intelligent comments with the occasional well-placed joke.

His main point was that bullshit is what happens when you are called upon to talk about something you know little or nothing about, yet still want to save face. We see on reddit that people can ""call upon"" themselves, quite frequently.  From Wikipedia:    As such, bullshit either can be true or can be false; hence, the bullshitter is a man or a woman whose principal aim — when uttering or publishing bullshit — is to impress the listener and the reader with words that communicate an impression that something is being or has been done, words that are neither true nor false, and so obscure the facts of the matter being discussed; i.e. “the bullshitter is faking things, but that does not necessarily mean he gets them wrong.”[1] In contrast, the liar must know the truth, of the matter under discussion, in order to better conceal it from the listener or the reader being deceived with a lie; while the bullshitter’s sole concern is personal advancement and advantage to his or her agenda; bullshit thus is a greater enemy of the truth than are lies.[2]"

When Reddit started out its demographic was university educated nerds, and that group has its own biases and blind spots. Also a tendency to think we can talk about complex social issues when we know very little about how other people live.  What makes Reddit so great is that lots of people come here who I would never talk to in daily life, like soldiers who were in any given battle, garbagemen, homeless people logging in from the library, alcoholics, drug addicts, politicians, actors, etc.  Of course these peoples' opinions are primarily valuable when they talk about what they know about.

I believe that people's lack of restraint on commenting is a good thing since any bullshit views or ideas that people will hold will NOT remain incognito, if people didn't speak their thoughts it's not like they would suddenly cease to exist, they will merely be buried within peoples minds and if people talk about how 'Eugenics are actually pretty good' there are going to be people that will come and say why that is not the case, THAT I value more than silence. Learning > Pretending to not be stupid. I made some comments I was woefully wrong in in the past but I had no trouble admitting to be at fault, contrary to popular belief.  Exercising self-restraint to not comment is not a good thing, not admitting to mistakes and being thick and stubborn is simply a bad thing."

That's why AskHistorians is generally regarded as one of the most factual subs. Once the moderators have had a chance to look through a thread and clean out anything not rock-solid, detailed, and sourced, you're left with seriously high quality information. It's a real shame that more of the site doesn't follow their example, but at the same time because such a huge proportion of Redditors are just lazy nobodies you'd be left with 80% of comments deleted in many subs."

defaultgems,2scg3l,just_a_little_boy,5,Wed Jan 14 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"Something the writer left out of the perspective angle is once you achieve stage 2 or even stage 1 of wealth, debt stops being a factor working against you and starts working for you.  For the unwealthy, buying a car (usually) and buying a house (definitely) means taking out a loan and paying interest. Selling those properties either means taking a higher net loss above the real value (on the car) or waiting a long time for a reduced profit because of the interest paid (for the house). For the wealthy, especially the extreme wealthy, there is nothing they have to take a loan out on that isn't going to net them some serious profit in the future. They want that Lambo? They don't take out a loan, they pay cash. If they need a loan for something, they get the absolute best terms possible and maybe even flip the property for a profit -possibly before ever having to make a payment. Even if the property loses value, they find a way to write it off their taxes and they still make money on the deal over all. So the perspective on what you can buy/what things cost the average person vs. the super-wealthy leaves out the understanding that, while a $20M house to someone making $4M a year equates to a $200K house to someone making $40K a year, the terms of those two deals are going to differ drastically and exponentially."

The difference between him and other humans is not big. Physiclly, they are almost the same. I am almost sure that if you switched the babys, a poor one and a rich one, it wouldn't really matter. Because the difference is not justified by anything. One person is lucky, he is born priviliged, has luck in his life and becomes someone godlike.

I guess my argument against the ""I'm torn about this"" statement, is with the ""He repeatedly insults him"" part. Other than referring to him as ""Mr. asshat"", I never insulted HIM. I insulted his behavior. And I guess i now see how ""asshat"" is a pretty inflammatory and unsettling remark that could carry some long term repercussions, but.... I think I will stick with my initial impression. He is a person who, at least on line, enjoys and gets satisfaction from hurting others. He is an internet troll, and thus, in my view, completely worthy of my cold and callous reference of him as an asshat.   Other than that I simply responded to his troll message with a (sincere) ""thanks for your service, here is an upvote"" (and yes, I upvoted him). Then I finished that statement off by saying he was acting like a cunt and was disrespecting his service to his country. I guess where we disagree is that I simply don't see it as being ""insulting"" to tell someone they are acting like a cunt, when in fact they ARE acting like a cunt... I'm sorry if some people do, but it seems to me that the simpler way for people who have issue with it would be to address it by telling the cunt acterer to stop acting like a cunt, you know, as opposed to telling the people who call them out for their behavior that they are walking the same moral ground.    In fact, I'd argue one of the problems of our society is we need to call out asinine behavior like this more often, instead of going all Social justice warrior and rushing to defend the internet troll who might have had his feelings hurt.   Internet trolling is not only completely assinine behavior, it's unhealthy and probably points to some SEVER underlying psychological disorders. Just read the links about the wife who caught her husband. There are major personality issues at play with that individual, and defending him or attempting to put my response to it on the same level is, I'm sorry, but it's asinine.   With that reasoning, this will probably make you lose your shit. Yesterday, as I was placing a womans teeth  into a bio hazard bag to transport them to the hospital along with the woman who had just been severely beaten by her husband, she actually had the gall to call him a ""mavervucker"" (I'm pretty sure she meant ""motherfucker"", but again, most of her teeth were either sticking through her lips, or were in a bag).  Can you believe she called him that?  I guess I dropped the ball because I didn't say anything to her about how that behavior will gain her no ground in no argument. I mean her response to her assailant was clearly uncalled for and she was basically guilty of the same behavior as he was, and by lashing out like she did she only showed my that her ego was hurt. I hope she learned her lesson and the next time she behaves more maturely.  With all that said, the truth of the matter is that I personally just thought it was funny to switch gears from the sincere apology to calling him out for acting like a cunt. That's just me and my sense of humor. Not everyone ""gets"" me, and I'm ok with that."

It seems to be the only reasonable conclusion one is to draw from that phrase and from your post in general.  I don't mean to belittle you in any measure: as you rightly point out, it's our civil duty to call out pointlessly-destructive behavior, be it towards one person, yourself or someone else, or social structures - and I'm exercising mine.  Instead of appreciating a good advice coming from years of hard learning to adapt to normal society, you delve into defending yourself with obscurely-sarcastic reference to an only slightly related event you participated in after my words have pointed out points of your insecurity and flaws in your personality you yourself seem to not appreciate being there. Here is what I'm talking about:   I guess I dropped the ball because I didn't say anything to her about how that behavior will gain her no ground in no argument. I mean her response to her assailant was clearly uncalled for and she was basically guilty of the same behavior as he was, and by lashing out like she did she only showed my that her ego was hurt. I hope she learned her lesson and the next time she behaves more maturely.   Referring to my words from the post you reply to:   Hiding behind immaturity will gain you no ground in no argument - only show that your ego is hurt by an offence nobody but you sees.   I believe that you're at least somewhat aware of how your example doesn't fit the thing I'm describing. You mixed the points I was making with your made up own - particularly the point of physical assault which left noticable lasting damage having similar weight to an insult from an internet troll that you, reportedly, laughed away anyway - in order to build yourself a better defence against an internet stranger who has the experience and insight necessary to point out how weak your self must feel in order to take aim and shoot at a person incapable of defending themselves in a verbal assault - the troll, that is.  That is not to say the troll was anything like a good-behaving citizen. I haven't even seen the words he or she has put into their post before you replied and inadvertently caused them to delete it, so I can't judge. That does not belittle the fact that your own behavior was not of the best kind, and the fact that you're defending yourself against my critique does solidify the fact more. It is as if you're denying the fact of existance of a flaw by beating the one who criticises you verbally so that no other word of critique follows. That's something I've seen both from outside and from inside quite a few times.  I'm not here to punish you for how you act or to attack your personality - the first one is impossible for me to do, and in both I have no interest. Instead, I came to offer you an advice about something I've been struggling against for a long time - and you seem to struggle with as well. I suggest you keep it and think about it, not because it benefits me - it doesn't, I will probably not hear from you again after this conversation is over - but because it will benefit you, the more the longer you know about it."

You claim that, because I haven't seen what the troll said, I can't judge you somehow. Of course I can: their words are not equivalent to yours, and yours I've seen quite a few times so that my arguments were solid.  You claim that I claimed you to be a troll - I did not, and I'm not going to unless you provide such behavior as to be proven one. It is my fault, though: I must have included my thought process on the subject in the post you're quoting instead of explainin myself here as I will follow to do.  You seem to have a tendency to belittle other people, some times sneakily, by claiming how either their motives or their actions are deserving of pity or not deserving attention at all - that is, destroying their moral or social base during the conversation. That's what you call your humour was about: you pitied the troll, and then, seeing how they don't respond, made yourself look superior over them by nonchalantly including your superiority feeling in the end of the reply to /u/Cessno. When somebody calls you out of that, you try to subvert any mention of this by trying to tear down the points and/or position of whom you perceive to be the attacker - upper context be proof of the latter part. It's not that people don't get you - it's that your methods of having fun are twisted beyond what many people will understand and accept as constructive social behavior, in part because it's similar to that of troll's. I suggest you think about it, about how other people perceive it, why they do so and how it affects you as a person: it is my promise that it would be at least helpful to yourself as a person, understanding yourself better.  Though of course, since my advice went unappreciated by you, I have nothing more to do here: this conversation turned pointless with your latest reply with you trying to pass me for a troll I was never intending to be simply to save your face before your self. Please note how I use the space between ""your"" and ""self"": during my studies I was led to believe that you as a person and your self are different, though conjugant, entities, with self being often the darker part of your personality. You may want to act to help others, but your self may very well drag you down to paths of insecurity and inconfidence, which never lead to happy life.  That being said, if you wish to continue the conversation on the subject I've raised particularly in the last paragraph, feel free to send me a private message. I promise confidentiality towards anything you tell me and the whole process of our conversation. Please don't write me if you still feel like you have to make yourself worth in your own eyes by attacking me: I will block you permanently, since it's nothing like a productive conversation I am willing to have any time of the day."

I am sure this aspect of his personality is but a small portion, and that it is hidden from his ""real life"" and is something that has manifested itself as a means for him to deal with some psychological issues or some self esteem issues. This is exactly why I responded to the other commenter by saying that I felt sorry for him. I never attacked him. I said he was acting like a cunt....because..and this is where some people seem to be getting lost.....he was! The only ""attack"" I made was referring to him as ""Mr asshat"". I guess I did not realize the emotional response such a reference would generate from people. For that I apologize. I hope he has recovered from my attack, and if he hasn't I hope he is willing to seek out professional help to aid him through it.

Usually, when people discuss trolls it's mostly about how we should ignore them and they're no big deal, but in this thread everyone was taking it very seriously and encouraging the OP to divorce him, which I think she eventually did.

I will admit art is probably one of the harder ones to tell but it is not exclusive to art. Even in the baseball example the farther you go before you find you are out the harder it would be to accept it.  I am in science, and the cuts are getting through undergrad, getting into grad school, passing exams in grad school, defending your thesis, getting post-doc, securing a second post doc, getting an academic position, securing tenure.  That is a ton of places you can find out you can't make the cut, and some of them quite late in life. I am at one of the later stages wondering if I can make the cut or not and thinking the answer may be no. In any career it is hard to know if you will make the cut or not, his baseball analogy is good for everyone with aspirations to read."
defaultgems,2p0crd,f4hy,6,Fri Dec 12 02:39:41 2014 UTC,"But it's not as bad as all that, either. PhDs and tenure are not the end all and be all of science.  There are lots of things you can do with science if you jump off that track, and most of them aren't even in academia. Hell, you almost couldn't pay me enough to get a PhD. Way too much bullshit, when I can be making good money with a lower degree and not getting stuck in meetings all day.   If you don't make the cut in a sport, there are minor leagues, coaching, analysis, etc. In visual arts, well, there's always Etsy. There's often a way to stay with your passion, if not always full time. So the time investment isn't a total waste."

PhDs are for the vision, the funding, and the paper at the end, but you're not a one-person show, and your whole team is necessary to make that impression you desire."

defaultgems,2p0crd,jeroenemans,1 point,Fri Dec 12 12:59:59 2014 UTC,"One big difference is that your grades already are an indication of whether or not you can make the cut (whatever that means to you). In sports, you can collect lots of objective statistics that are an even stronger indicator of how you're doing. Obviously you can work harder to get better results, but such parameters are mostly absent in arts.  One of those parameters is how many and how much people like your creations. Someone like a gallery owner or an experienced art collector can make an educated guess about how far you'll get with your art, but even these people are often mistaken. If you can't get anyone outside your close friends and family interested in your art, it may also be a bad sign."
defaultgems,2p0crd,Nohoshi,9,Fri Dec 12 21:04:45 2014 UTC,"I would say it is hard to realize if your art makes the cut or not because it is an extremely subjective industry with incredible biases towards people with the right networks.

It's a valid discussion to have and there was probably a decent amount of unwarranted ridicule sent his way based off of his Clipper flair. Basically, the rest of the community though felt there wasn't really a discussion to be had on the point.  The other post was a link to a gif of a game-winning 3 by Blake that was posted immediately after the game, hence the traffic and the visibility that allowed it to receive enough input from a range of people, including Blake fans that wanted to talk about him shooting 3's now.

While my 1st wife didn't steal from a bank she was very good at stealing from her cashier jobs and from other people. We were both the same age as OP in the story and got married young 20's and I was determined to ""help her get through it.""  End result was the same as OPs story, she turned into a massive whore and druggy party maniac who, strangely enough, ditched me for an 18 y/o cocaine dealer when we were around 25.  My advice to the young-uns would be that when you find out something, like that your S/O is doing illegal shit, IMMEDIATELY put the relationship in low gear. While I'm all for being supportive getting married doesn't help fix things, I've learned the hard way that people can only change themselves, if they want to, and you face getting sucked into a quagmire of horror for years.  Also, people rarely only do something the one time that they are caught for it. You get caught stealing the one time after you've gotten away with doing it 100 times before. So, it's a really good indication, once you find out about something, that the behaviour was common and just you didn't know because of obfuscation and lying."

Bullying could range anywhere from teasing to physical abuse.  My larger point is that there really shouldn't be any act for which sexual assault is a good and fitting punishment. That goes for bullies all the way to convicts. I'm not comfortable with the idea of rape ever being excusable because there are times the victim ""deserved it"". I make no distinction for ""justified rape"". There are far better ways to address poor behavior than to add rape to the equation.  What if the bully in the story were a girl? We all know that teenage girls can be vicious with their words. Would we be cheering her victim as much for deciding to get even by sexually assaulting her?  ""She deserved it because she was a cunt! That bitch just needed some dick!"" Doesn't anyone feel just a little uncomfortable with that angle here, even if it's a boy getting violated?  Regardless of the motivation, this act was committed specifically to wield power over the other and emotionally traumatize him.

Did she ask for it back? Or just keep it for 2.5 years? He checked the school's security cameras? From 2.5 years earlier? They just let the weightlifting coach watch security footage that's that old? The police watched a man assault someone (and possibly damage a stranger's car) on a school campus and just decided to let him go because the victim (without proof) was accused of rape?

Anyway, the point is that this poster thinks that jury verdicts shouldn't be questioned because the jury has more facts than we do... and then in both of his examples this is false. OJ's jury didn't know that he'd write a book called If I Did It, and Anthony's jury didn't know about this search. We have more info, and you bet your ass I can decide for myself about their guilt."
defaultgems,2nxwx4,tbotcotw,13,Mon Dec 1 21:51:14 2014 UTC,"Juries:   are not allowed to take notes during the case  cannot ask their own questions are asked to determine what constitutes reasonable doubt in the eyes of the law, despite not being lawyers are not told these legal points by the Judge on which they are deciding until the end of all testimony do not get a written copy of said legal points do not get a written copy of testimony (they have to ask the stenographer to read the court record) don't even decide what really happened, all they do is say ""guilty"" or ""not guilty""   Also, juries are not made up of geniuses -- they're made up of average people. Actually, they are usually made up of less-than-average people, because attorneys usually do not want people with advanced degrees on their jury.  The jury system usually works, but to say that juries know more than you do is ridiculous."
defaultgems,2nxwx4,rlbond86,12,Mon Dec 1 16:15:18 2014 UTC,"The top response explains why this is utter BS.  The jury isn't necessarily given more than is available to the public.  In fact, the trial is public, so the public has access to everything that happened in the case.  What the jury see is what the prosecutor and defense fight over what they are allowed to see.  Maybe seeing less is better in some cases, but to say they see more is BS.  However, what is important to note is that if you haven't followed the case closely (and I'm not talking about reading interpretations of it from your favorite, biased, news/blog source), then the jury does probably know more than you.  I wish I were amazed at how many people who hold adamant and strong beliefs about certain cases (Wilson/Zimmerman being the most notable ones for me) who have the facts so woefully wrong.  But, I've gotten to the point where I realize that, for most people, the facts don't matter.  Whoever said ""perception is reality"" was a wise person."

The point still stands, we the public often don't know all the intricacies of a case or why the jury came to x or y conclusion.   if you haven't followed the case closely   I followed the Kercher case very closely, even on the most objective sites, there was no certainty about how trustworthy they were.

defaultgems,2nxwx4,EatATaco,5,Mon Dec 1 15:31:03 2014 UTC,"The response doesn't contradict it, it just says that the judge was very lenient in Anthony case.  This doesn't change the fact that virtually all cases (including the Anthony case) are open to the public, so the public can look at all that information.  Unless the trial isn't public, what is presented to the jury is almost always a subset of what is available to the public.  I agree that the public doesn't follow the cases closely, but that doesn't change the fact that we almost always have more information and have the ability to make a more informed decision."

defaultgems,2nfkvy,mightyflynn,12,Wed Nov 26 13:52:48 2014 UTC,"When white people riot (it happens after sports events, most often), nobody goes on the news and says ""look at these problems with the white community! White people need to be less violent if they want to be respected!""   When a white man commits a mass murder, he's not accused of being a terrorist (look at the anti-Muslim sentiment in America).   The bad actions of a few white people rarely reflect negatively upon all white people- this is not true for American minorities."
defaultgems,2nfkvy,TheRighteousTyrant,3,Wed Nov 26 10:50:24 2014 UTC,"My point is the ""evil black/muslim"" stereotype is applied to all members of the race, whereas the ""evil white men"" stereotype is rarely applied and is rarely the cause of violence/action against a white person. White men don't get shot for being colonialist- they get holidays dedicated to them, and they get favored by the justice system and by the school systems.  There is no punishment for being a colonialist, conniving, nationalist xenophobe. In fact, I have literally never heard a white man referred to as any of those adjectives by popular media. Those adjectives are applied to individuals, never to the whole race. One white man acting ""conniving"" doesn't reflect upon all white people.   Regardless of that, when a white man acts like a racist xenophobe, nobody says ""stop! You're making white people look bad!"". Nobody tells other white people to go correct his viewpoint and make him less colonialist. This does not happen. White people, as a group, feel little pressure to be less racist- as evidenced by the crazy amounts of racist sentiment all over reddit/Facebook/the Internet in general in the past week, and the lack of backlash against the media's portrayal of these protests and riots.   My other point- stereotypes of the white man being violent should be prevalent in society. From the beating of slaves to the brutal Crusades, historically white people have been absolutely and horrifically violent toward each other and toward other races. Why do white people not have the stereotype of being violent? Where do these ""evil"" stereotypes come from? You can't make claims like you have without examining the root of these mental images of races.   It rather seems like you're trying to say that race is not an issue here- which, if you've been paying attention to anything, is clearly false. I'm not really sure what your point is, other than ""sometimes people think bad things about white people""- which in no way compares to the systemic racism against black people in America."

White people need to be less violent if they want to be respected!""    Are you implying that sports riots in America are about as white as the Ferguson riots are black? Because I think that's an assertion that needs some support.    When a white man commits a mass murder, he's not accused of being a terrorist (look at the anti-Muslim sentiment in America).    Timothy McVeigh was convicted and executed for domestic terrorism. Nidal Hasan's shooting, meanwhile, is classified as workplace violence."

Among the ton of messages I came home to this morning, one of them said I was mentioned here, so I figured I would put the whole thing in some context.   It started with a bunch of us in the Ferguson mega thread watching streams and many of us complaining about the guy on the Rebelution Z(sp?) ustream. Many people thought he was antagonizing the cops, talking himself up/trying to be the center of attention, and being pretty much all around douchey. I posted, without really thinking about it, that I lived near the area his was filming and I had half a mind to go tell him he was being douchey. It was a huge thread and I figured no one would care/notice I said this. I was very mistaken. Way more people than I thought possible messaged me and told me to seriously go do it. So I watched for a little while longer and thought, ""Meh, screw it. I will"" I posted that I would and another redditor suggested I say ""dishwasher"" during the encounter to prove it was me. So I went down there, met the guy, delivered the message, and left. A lot of people here thought it was really funny.   Why did I do it? I'd be lying if I said part of me didn't do it just for laughs. This is a stressful time for people, and I thought it would be fun to lighten things up at the expense of this vlogger guy who people were peeved at. But mostly I and others were just tired of the Z guy and the people he was talking to antagonizing the police and trying to get them to do something inflammatory on film, hearing these vlogger people talking to each other like they were war correspondents freshly back from Iraq, repeatedly saying that he was (possibly?) shot with a rubber bullet like it's something to be proud of. There is serious shit going down in this city and people are losing their livelihoods. I can understand actual journalists trying to cover this stuff, but this whole ""playing war reporter"" shit just rubs me the wrong way. I didn't see a lot of what he posted, so maybe I'm off base and I'm willing to admit that.   Was what I did itself douchey? Very possibly. That's ok with me, I'm not making money off of other people's misery like other douchebags. And yes, it may have been a little cringe worthy, but I default to honesty when I don't know what else to say. Considering what I said to the dude, I didn't think the thing he would latch onto would be the ""dishwasher"" part. So I just told him the truth: it meant nothing but a way to verify who I was. I wish I had thought of something cool to say, but I guess I'm not that clever. Hopefully, it made some people laugh in the middle of a bunch of terrible shit.  So to sum up/TL;DR: Some people on the Ferguson thread thought a streamer was douchey, I went and told him so and was sort of douchey myself in the process, some people on the internet thought it was funny.

defaultgems,2m2bvo,huyvanbin,5,Wed Nov 12 16:16:16 2014 UTC,"I think the trick to making hard choices is to make hard choices. I think they're not as hard for some people. From what I've read Steve Jobs dropped out of college in the 70s back when everything was supposedly fine and barely scraped by for a while. He didn't have student loans but he didn't want his parents to spend all their life savings on him.   When I read that I think, fuck no. No way I would ever do that. But why not? What am I afraid of? I'm not going to starve to death. Even if I did, what's the big deal? But I just can't give up the security that my job gives me even though I feel like that time is wasted and the money will at best buy me a house to hang myself in.  Something in some people's minds makes them feel secure enough to just set off on their own path. I see that in some of the people I know who start businesses. What they generally share is a comfortable above-average childhood and a complete bulletproof certainty that everyone around them ought to eat their shit whatever it is. Most of us aren't blessed with that kind of confidence and I think you have to be a little nuts to feel that way, in whatever time period.  Here's to the crazy ones, I guess."
defaultgems,2m2bvo,Fire42uck,6,Wed Nov 12 17:44:22 2014 UTC,"Meh, I don't think any making sweeping assumptions about an entire generation really gets anyone anywhere. I mean, how many hundreds of thousands of people are you claiming to speak for? Even if people share the same global history, the way they personally react to the circumstances surrounding their lives are unique, as the specific circumstances themselves are unique.   I suppose a lot of this is reactionary towards the supposed ""millennials are lazy"" comment that comes from the baby boomers (never personally heard it), but really, why should anyone give that more than a second of attention? It's another sweeping generalization that can't possibly correct. Instead of trying to validate it with arguing a cause or shifting the blame, we should probably just ignore it and move on."
defaultgems,2m2bvo,jts5009,7,Wed Nov 12 17:13:15 2014 UTC,"Generalizations always simplify the truth, but that doesn't make them useless.  It is an objective fact that teenagers are involved in more fatal accidents than any other age group.  That insight leads to the insurance rate differentials we see by age.  The generalization isn't true in every case, as there are certainly well driving teens and poor driving adults, but it is true on average.  While some generational articles offer more clickbait than substance, it's foolish to ignore valid points simply because they fall under that same generational analysis umbrella.    To address the article, Millennials definitely have different factors influencing their lives when compared to older generations.  The author the bestof post noted many negative influences that tend to make life harder for Millenials, but the positive influences cannot be ignored either.  No generation in all of history has had the same access to information as the Millenials.  Additionally, Millennials in the US have never had to fear nuclear war to the extent that the Baby Boomers did during the Cold War.  Racial tensions, while not 100% eliminated, are nowhere near what they used to be.    The author is right that, yes, some aspects of life are harder for Millenials, but others are easier. To some extent, the influences offset one another, but it's hard to quantify the magnitude one way or the other.  That said, recognizing the differences is indeed important, if for no other reason than leading to better understanding of perspectives across generations."

But, the truth is, it really isn't. It really would be useful for an older generation to read this an really think about the environment children today are growing up in and how that affects them and will affect them later in life.   I still say it's useless to compare the circumstances that create a generation because, as you said, it's hard to really say one has it better or worse than another. Personally, I don't think society has actually gotten worse in the past century. However, I now see that it's useful to understand what shapes a generation, as it facilitates understanding of other people—which isn't ever a bad thing."

I just thought it was a very well articulated way of explaining some points that dont seem to be common knowledge to baby-boomers. As someone who constantly hears a lot of shit talking about my generation (millennial) from my parents (baby-boomers), it just resonated with me. The problems each generation has faced aren't necessarily worse or better than others, just different. I just think its important to recognize those differences so we can better understand and relate to the other generations, rather than just trading blame and insults because we don't understand the others' perspective.  Haha I just reread your comment and realized I basically just restated you original point. So I guess we're in agreement after all."

defaultgems,2m0qe2,lolmeansilaughed,25,Wed Nov 12 12:30:48 2014 UTC,"I've been waiting for this thread my entire life.  I grew up involved with the Quiverfull movement, a type of Christian Fundamentalism that involves having a bunch of children, home education, extremely modest dress including headcoverings, the practise of ""courting"" and ""bethrothals"" (basically semi-arranged marriages taking place as soon as the girl was old enough to marry), and something called ""Christian patriarchy"", wherein the father is viewed as a sort of mini god.  I grew up attending a small Christian school run by the local Independent Fundamentalist Baptist church, where every student was Quiverfull. We were required to wear extremely modest clothing (ankle length skirts, hemlines that covered the base of our necks, etc. We had wardrobe checks multiple times each day.)  Each morning we pledged allegiance to the Christian Flag and to the Bible. It's been years, but I can still recite both pledges by heart. Then we recited the chapters of the Bible we were working on. Yes, I did say chapters. We memorized several books of the Bible (Jonah, all of Paul's epistles, most of Genesis, Daniel, a decent amount of Leviticus and I think the Gospel of Mark.)  Our schoolwork was primarily books published by Abeka, BJUPress and ACE. Our textbooks claimed that:  no transitional fossils had ever been found  the Loch Ness Monster had been proven to be real and was a plesiosaur  the Great Depression never happened but was just a myth made up by the socialists  slavery was a win-win solution for all involved  dinosaurs breathed fire  the KKK were great dudes who got a bad rap  the trail of tears was actually super great  outer space wasn't real because if you blew on a pile of baby powder, a new planet wouldn't form (this was demonstrated)  the Liberals don't believe in personal responsibility  the world is about to be attacked by the floating Space Jerusalem  We never covered much actual math, science, etc. Learning the truth about the government's plan to kill Holocaust the Christians was seen as much more important.   For one year the girls also took Christian Charm. This was primarily about how God really, really cares about whether your chest is 10 inches largest than your waist or not. Girls were forbidden from standing with their feet parallel, ""like a man's"", instead having to keep our feet at ridiculous and painful angles. We couldn't walk without being careful to ""glide gracefully"" and avoid ""swishing"" our knees. We were forbidden to not smile, but our smiles were never big enough, or they were too big.   There wasn't much time for real schoolwork anyway, since we were all so busy being punished for having an ungodly facial expression, and forced to spend the rest of the school day standing on our tiptoes on one foot in the corner.  In fourth grade my parents chose to pull me out and homeschool me. We joined a local homeschool group filled with Quiverfull homeschoolers. My parents had gone to a different church, one which was very Charismatic (we spoke in tongues, exorcised people, ""healed"" with prayer) but not necessarily quite so extreme as the IFB school I had been sent to. However, as my father became more violent (he had a lot of mental issues and was an extreme hoarder), my mother (who was a borderline hoarder and very depressed, so much so that for the first ten years of my life she barely left her bed except to use the washroom) became more and more heavily sucked into this subculture.  My parents had already gotten rid of most TV channels over concerns about evil spirits and only allowed us to read a few classic books, but after this my mom first stopped allowing us to read anything non-Christian, then banned novels altogether. We began being forbidden to see anyone who did not go to our church or homeschool group. Since my parents never really started teaching, and I had little access to books and at the time no internet, this left little to do all day aside from copy out Bible verses and stare out the window for hours. Time sort of stopped meaning anything.  We became more into the Biblical patriarchy thing, where my father was seen as the head of our household and a sort of direct representative from god who women were to serve and obey in every way. You weren't supposed to express any kind of wishes or desire, but leave it up to your husband/father to make all decisions for you. (if you were his daughter, this included selecting your husband--girls were expected to be stay at home daughters, serving their fathers, until marriage) Biblical femininity was emphasized, which in this case basically meant long skirts and not having opinions or desires, except to serve whatever man God chose as the best ""helpmeet"" possible.   For a couple of years my mom, who was herself a nurse stopped allowing us to take medicine, believing it to be witchcraft. She became more and more crazed about the idea of demons trying to attack her and our family.   Unfortunately, I was born with a birthmark on my leg. She believed that this made me Satan. My father and mother both searched for ways to fix this. I've been exorcised, had oil poured over me, had everything I owned burned, etc. It apparently didn't work.  After my father died we were at least spared his extreme violence, but my mother became only more unhinged and depressed. She mostly gave up on her idea of me as Satan, but became absolutely obsessed with the idea of Satan attacking our family. This belief is reinforced by our church and all the Charismatic material she reads. She even abandoned our homeschool group, believing it to not be concerned enough about how demons are possessing everyone.  Our church is obsessed with spiritual attacks, which are seen as stemming from absolutely everything. Anne of Green Gables? Witchcraft! Christian music? Actually sung by Satanists, filled with subliminal Satanic messages! Cabbage patch dolls? Demons who stay still when we look at them! (I'm 100% serious) The only way to ward this off is speaking in tongues, making prophesies, etc. A few people in my church believe they hear the voices of demons in their head, and said demons are chasing them. I've been there as we've all laid hands on people and prayed for them to be liberated from the demonic oppression in their lives.  I...don't really have an end to this story. I still live with my mother and sister. I still go months without seeing anyone who isn't from my church. I still have no real education, although since I can now access the internet (it's monitored, but my mother doesn't know incognito mode is a thing, so I can secretly read Homeschoolers Anonymous, No Longer Quivering, things about atheism and reddit) I've been trying to learn some math through Khan Academy. I have hope of eventual escape, even if I have no idea how just yet.   http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2h31pq/eli5_the_quiverfull_movement_among_some_christian  http://www.patheos.com/blogs/nolongerquivering/  http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/christian-patriarchyquiverfull  http://homeschoolersanonymous.wordpress.com/"

This is a bunch of people on a site that leans heavily left wing and atheist banding together to take one of those future soldiers of God from them.   That and I can't believe they would be so willing to throw down money with so little proof. Internet mobs are wrong all the time.

The statement ""Fact is called fact, theory is called theory"" suggests that you have a common misconception about scientific facts and scientific theories.  A scientific theory is a robust explanation of a collection of facts.  ""Theory"" is the strongest name an idea can get in science -- it never gets upgraded (i.e., the ""theory"" of gravity).  The ""issues"" presented in these textbooks are usually attempts to disprove evolution or climate change.  The problem with that is that the scientific discussion about those issues was finished a very long time ago.  There are no arguments against evolution that stand up to informed scrutiny.  You may not personally believe that (and you are free to accept whatever religious beliefs you prefer), but if you teach your children that evolution is false, then you are essentially guaranteeing that they will have problems with their faith down the road.    But the worst part of these textbooks is how they present logic.  If you teach children how to reason through problems, then they can handle any situation in life.

For example they're trying to remember the name of the volleyball in castaway and you suggest Woody.  For a split second their brain says, ""yes Tom Hanks is connected to the name Woody"" and they think they've got the answer then they realize it's not the right connection and before they can move on you suggest, ""Forrest""  Then someone else picks up on the trend and calls out ""Captain Phillips"".  By this point the original person is pleasantly befuddled.  Edit: I just did this within the past 5 minutes.  I walked into another office and one coworker was asking another, ""You know who T.I. is right?"" He looked at me obviously out of the loop and I responded, ""It's a calculator"" knowing full well that he's a rapper.

Of course the prof says ""well, you can't just decide not to show up to work.  You'd be fired.""  To which I say ""Well, in this case, I'm paying to be here rather than being paid to be here so I ought to be able to manage my own time as I see fit.  As long as I can prove that I am learning the subject matter via assignments and assessments, there is no non-petty, non-spiteful reason that I should be penalized because I had to work and couldn't make it.""  Yes, I'm still bitter about this years later.  College really can be a stressful and busy time but that's mainly because working to pay for it and support yourself means that between course work, out of class assignments/projects, and employment you're working the equivalent of a 40-50 hour week.  I had no problem accepting that and I did it voluntarily but I hated when professors assumed that their class was the center of your life.

Golf doesn't really use the same sort of athletiscm in terms of speed / quickness.      I think it's obvious that socioeconomic factors play a significant role, but genetic factors obviously play a gigantic role.  I mean, how often is there a white CB starting in the NFL?  And what % of the population are white people compared to black ones?  And how many white cornerbacks are playing in high school?  Where do they all vanish to between high school and the pros?     Socioeconomic factors definately play a role, but you can't explain that much improbability just with the socioeconomic angle."
defaultgems,2irya8,5510,0,Sun Oct 12 04:39:50 2014 UTC,"There are zero non-black CBs in the NFL, if you didn't know.   The consensus as to why, though, is because athletic white players are urged into the ""cerebral"" position of QB, whereas athletic black players are encouraged to play CB."

If there were neither genetics or socioeconomic factors, it would be literally astronomical.      Of course there are socioeconomic factors, but nowhere near enough to account for that insanely gigantic level of improbability.  There are tons of white CBs in high school, and they don't all end up playing QB in college.  Nor are they huge amounts of white QBs who are fast as shit and could definitely play NFL CB.  All the white CBs dispensary because virtually no white people have the speed / quickness to be an NFL CB."
defaultgems,2irya8,5510,0,Sun Oct 12 05:02:44 2014 UTC,"Not all athletic ventures but athletic ventures that require similar attributes to basketball.  I'd say height, jumping, short-distance speed and quickness are the attributes.  For example, American short distance track and field is definitely dominated by blacks.    Another direction to approach it is why white Americans are doing worse than black Americans in basketball.  If the average white American has more wealth, then we might say the average white American has better access to basketball gyms throughout the year (summer and winter).  We're assuming that basketball is pretty accessible to anyone, though, even the poor, so let's say that this advantage in access to gyms only provides a very slight advantage.  A ""disadvantage"" is that white Americans are more likely to be ""distracted"" by other sports that they can afford to play while black Americans are less likely to have that happen, so most black Americans only play basketball.  So then we get to: how many white Americans remain ""undistracted"" and stay playing basketball vs. how many black Americans are there who also just play basketball?  Even if there are more black Americans playing basketball than white Americans in general, is it as much as the ratio of black to white players in the NBA?"

defaultgems,2iq2mb,kingofthedesert,5,Thu Oct 9 02:35:53 2014 UTC,"I disagree. One of the strongest themes throughout the entire trilogy, which came up time and time again, was the idea that a symbol, not a man, is eternal.  They kicked this off in the first movie with both Ra'as and Batman. Was Ra'as one man, or simply a title passed from teacher to student? In the comics, Ra'as is immortal because of his Lazarus Pit. But it's hinted that in the movies, Ra'as is immortal because he is not one man, but a symbol. As stated in BB, you cannot corrupt or kill a symbol, hence why Bruce decides he needs one to fight crime.  The symbol which Bruce created, Batman, is incorruptible. Immortal. So when Bruce the man becomes old and tired, Batman the symbol must live on. And it lives on through John Blake.   The fact that his birth name is Robin is merely a slice of fan service."

People on Reddit are very quick to anger about certain topics, such as corporate corruption. Comcast is evil! EA is evil! BP is evil! A so-called ""corporate death penalty"" is a very appealing knee-jerk reaction to these companies. Just look at some of the top comments:     TIL that I am actually pro capitol punishment            I'm so torn between my hatred for big corporations and my hatred for big government overreach that I'm not sure how I feel about this.           ""Something, something, Comcast."" -Everyone, 2014     Master-Thief provides an alternate point of view that should be considered; that things aren't as black-and-white as they seem.

After about 30 seconds of her ""spiel"" I googled Primerica (which i regret not going beforehand, but my boss set up the appointment) and instantly laughed.  I printed out one of their documents which clearly showed a pyramid shape and handed it to my boss.  I then asked her, ""so if this isn't a pyramid… what shape would you call it?""  I instantly derailed her.  A few weeks later she called and irately read my boss a new one for not taking the opportunities she was offering our students seriously.  She said we were bad educators and should be ashamed of ourselves.

The anti-foreskin/pro-surgery bias you're displaying has been recognized as common in circumcising cultures.

defaultgems,2hsxjp,Ripshawryan,16,Mon Sep 29 17:11:51 2014 UTC,"Strangely, that reminded me of lengthy a passage from A Feast for Crows, by George R R Martin:  “Ser? My lady?” said Podrick. “Is a broken man an outlaw?” “More or less,” Brienne answered. Septon Meribald disagreed. “More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. They’ve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.  “Then they get a taste of battle.  “For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they’ve been gutted by an axe.  “They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when that’s still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.  “If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they’re fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it’s just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don’t know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they’re fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world…  “And the man breaks.  “He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them…but he should pity them as well.” When Meribald was finished a profound silence fell upon their little band. Brienne could hear the wind rustling through a clump of pussywillows, and farther off the faint cry of a loon. She could hear Dog panting softly as he loped along beside the septon and his donkey, tongue lolling from his mouth. The quiet stretched and stretched, until finally she said, “How old were you when they marched you off to war?”  “Why, no older than your boy,” Meribald replied. “Too young for such, in truth, but my brothers were all going, and I would not be left behind. Willam said I could be his squire, though Will was no knight, only a potboy armed with a kitchen knife he’d stolen from the inn. He died upon the Stepstones, and never struck a blow. It was fever did for him, and for my brother Robin. Owen died from a mace that split his head apart, and his friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape.”  “The War of the Ninepenny Kings?” asked Hyle Hunt.  “So they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny. It was a war, though. That it was.”"

You grew up wanting so bad to be Luke Skywalker, but you realize that you were basically a Stormtrooper, a faceless, nameless rifleman, carrying a spear for empire, and you start to accept the startlingly obvious truth that these are people like you.   Well, your own fucking fault for being an idiot.  I remember 9/11--I was infantry age at the time, and I remember a lot of people saying they wanted to enlist to fight the evil terrorists. Some did. I thought about it briefly--it was a crazy time--but I quickly remembered something: wars are when rich people convince poor men to die for no good reason. Bertrand Russell put it best: ""Patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons.""  I think it was partly my studies in history that made me realize this; few rich men died fighting the Confederates, or on Normandy beach, or in the Falklands. Traditionally, European troops had flanks in which the noblemen sat on horseback in the back (the word ""chivalry"" refers to the noble who fight on horses, far behind the front lines where the sons of peasants fought and died on foot). The fact that the newly elected president was a draft dodger helped.  So, yeah, I watched Star Wars as a kid too. And I was encouraged to imagine myself a Skywalker, not a paratrooper.

defaultgems,2h0vkv,ffiarpg,2,Sun Sep 21 17:33:47 2014 UTC,And yet much of what he says is wrong unfortunately.
defaultgems,2h0vkv,sn44,2,Sun Sep 21 22:05:12 2014 UTC,"4WD, AWD, and 4x4 are very similar systems with subtle differences.  Also, most 4x4s one the market have open differentials, which really means they are two wheel drive (one front, one rear). A main reason that 4x4 doesn't make you invincible in bad weather."
defaultgems,2h0vkv,pomf-pomf,0,Sun Sep 21 13:11:06 2014 UTC,An open diff doesn't make a four wheel drive car two wheel drive any moreso than an open diff makes a two wheel drive car (FWD or RWD) into a one wheel drive car. The only issue with an open diff is when you need to deliver (more) equal power to both wheels.
defaultgems,2h0vkv,sn44,2,Mon Sep 22 01:29:52 2014 UTC,"Familiar with the phrase ""one wheel wonder""?  Yeah, it's when an open-diff breaks traction and one wheel just spins.  THAT is one-wheel-drive.  If you can explain to me how that is 2wd, then feel free to try again.  In the meantime, I'll elaborate:  With an open diff both wheels get power if - and only if - both wheels have equal traction.  When a wheel breaks traction power goes to the wheel with no traction.  Not very useful off-road when you're twisted up in the rocks.  I know this because the Jeep I drive ('97 Grand Cherokee) has open diffs front and rear.  Sucks when I'm crossed up in the rocks and I only have two wheels spinning.  4x2 for the win!  Even a limited slip is technically one-wheel-drive.  Once you break traction with a limited slip it moves power to the wheel with traction.  It's how they work.  However the motion is gradual and works both ways.  So yes.  What I said is right.  4x4 with two open diffs is two wheel drive.  If you want AWD you'll need limited slips to transfer power from wheel to wheel.  If you want true 4x4 then you need lockers (or a spool) for a differential.  Of course the same goes for the transfer-case.  Although most Jeeps have part-time 50/50 locked t-case. Some have a 242 has a full-time 'open' options and then there are the 247/249 viscous cases.  I'm not even going to touch some of the newer systems with brake-assist traction control and electronic variable differentials."
defaultgems,2h0vkv,pomf-pomf,1 point,Mon Sep 22 02:28:23 2014 UTC,"I see what you're saying and I can understand why you're saying that: it's true in some situations with an open diff you can have one wheel spinning furiously and the other wheel motionless. I can understand why, to someone stuck in mud, that might seem like one wheel drive. But really, in situations like that, none of the wheels are doing any good. That's because an open diff works by splitting the torque of the drive shaft evenly between both wheels. When one wheel has much less resistance to movement than the other, this results in that wheel spinning really fast, and the other wheel not spinning at all. Since power = torque * rpm, that means all of the power is going to the wheel that has no traction.   That being said, calling a 4x4 with open diffs ""really...two wheel drive"" is just plain misleading and frankly incorrect. Wikipedia defines four wheel drive as ""a four-wheeled vehicle with a drivetrain that allows all four wheels to receive torque from the engine.""  Even when you're stuck in the mud in your Cherokee, all four wheels are still receiving torque from the engine. The problem is that all of the power goes to the wrong wheel. If you opened up your diff and wedged a rock in the pinion gear (i.e., you locked your diff), you would force both wheels to turn at the same speed. Since both wheels are now getting the same torque and the same rpm, power is split between the wheels 50-50 and so you'll be able to drive out."

The title of the original article says ""Study: Teens who smoke weed daily are 60% less likely to complete high school than those who never use"" but while the title seems to lend causation, the original author shows that there is only correlation and the more likely conclusion is that ""because marijuana is illegal and high school dropouts are more likely to commit illegal acts, high school dropouts are more likely to use marijuana if it is an illegal substance""."

The fact is, there are sure to be a combination of factors here. Not all teens who use drugs in school are going to be arrested. Probably not even most.    We know that the teenage brain is not fully developed yet. Doing a large amount of drugs is going to impact brain development.

That in itself is a gem. If only every article linked had the original author involved in the discussion.   But I'll bite.   The problems here:   The title, albeit sensational, is also misleading in that it's a survey done in Australia and New Zealand. In a title of an article in the Washington Post talking about marijuana, because it's such a hot button issue in America, it would be reasonable to make an incorrect forgone conclusion to assume that the survey was done in America based upon the title, and that's weasely.   The other problem:   Assumption: Teenagers who commit crimes are more likely to drop out of high school than teenagers who do not commit crimes  Supposition [Set A] ->  teenagers who do not commit crimes  Supposition [Set B] -> teenagers who do commit crimes  Tautology  -> Smoking marijuana is a crime in the countries the survey was performed in  [Set C] -> Students who smoke marijuana  Therefore: All students in set C are also members of set B, and all members of set C are not members of set A. Therefore because C ∈ B and C ∉ A there is no control group to compare against.   The test is inconclusive because there are no samples where C can be A, the students who smoke weed but do not commit any other crimes.   The test is a logical fallacy."

defaultgems,2ft4j0,pmanpman,-1,Mon Sep 8 23:17:48 2014 UTC,"The problem is two fold.  First, everybody is unconsciously racist and sexist (google ""unconscious bias""), this means that we're more likely to perceive neutral acts as being racist or sexist if we lose out, or we identify with the ""victim.""  Secondly, white people have historically been dominant, this means that racism by white people comes under more scrutiny that racism against white people (The Australian government currently has several policies that I view as racist because they exclude whites, but that may be my unconscious bias speaking). It's more socially acceptable to discriminate against white Christian men than any other group (probably, maybe Muslims are worse off).  White men still hold the majority of power in the western world though, which means that their unconscious bias causes problems for other groups. The ""only whites can be racist"" jerk is just as bad as the white supremacist jerk.  The only real solution (from where I'm sitting) is to forget that race is even a concept."

defaultgems,2folj7,Overgoats,26,Sun Sep 7 01:11:18 2014 UTC,"In case it falls victim to the [Serious] tag:  /u/throwaway10243798:   For context, I'm a male highschool math teacher. This happened earlier on in my career.  I used to run an after-hours tutoring session for any students that felt like they needed help understanding the material, or were just curious about the wonderful subject of math (I still run it, but I used to too). It usually wasn't busy, but I would typically get around 2-3 people. I find that 1 on 1 teaching is much more effective than 1 on 30. There was a point around June, about 2 weeks prior to exams, when a young lady from my grade 12 ""Calculus and Vectors"" walked in and closed the door. The other students that I had tutored had already left. I'll call her Freyja.  Now, I'm pretty professional about my job. I make an effort not to notice, and certainly not to act on, any distinguishing physical characteristics in my students. Perhaps because of my relative youth, however, I could not help but observe that this particular student was absolutely drop dead gorgeous. A perfect 10/10, as the saying goes. Red hair, green eyes, a light dusting of freckles. More than that though, she had more confidence than any teenager had a right to. Just the way she walked trumpeted it, kind of a rolling of the hips in a graceful stride. It was quite attractive. And much worse now that it was 1 on 1.  Despite my attraction, however, it was my responsibility as a teacher to keep a cool head. So keep a cool head I did. Or at least tried. Freyja walked up to my desk with a smile.  ""Hello Mr.throwaway10243798, I was wondering if I could get some help with this question""  ""Of course, Freyja. What's the problem?"" Cold and polite probably would have been my best bet, but I didn't want to risk scaring her away from my help.  ""I need the answer to lim(x->inf)(7xsqrt(x2 +1)-7*x2 )"" The question was a limits problem. Just use the MacLaurin series, centered 0. Though I knew how to answer it (I had made the question), I was having trouble completing it. Freyja smelled like vanilla. It was very... distracting.  I persevered, and finished answering the question. We ended up chatting idly for a while, for god knows how long and about god knows what. The entire time I was trying to focus on breathing deep and staying professional. At a lull in the conversation, I finally broke in: ""Is there anything else I can help you with, Freyja? I should really be getting home.""  ""Acutally, Mr.throwaway10243798, I have a bit of a confession"" She smiled shyly, and batted her eyes a bit. ""I didn't come here solely to get the answer to that question.""  ""Oh?"" Oh shit.  She walked slowly to my side of the desk, and laid her hand on my shoulder. It was only a light touch, but I was very aware. It felt like little bits of electricity were running from her into me. ""I actually have a bit of a... a crush"". The look on her face when she said that will be forever imprinted in my mind. It was beautiful, a shy smile touching her lips, a blush reddening on her cheeks.  ""...Oh?"" Ohshitohshit  She started to move her hand down my chest and down toward my pants. My mind started to go blank. I knew this was wrong, but I was having a lot of trouble summoning the willpower to stop it. She got to the waistline, put her hand in, and gently squeezed me.  I won't go in to the details, but we ended up having sex. Really awesome sex, in fact. A couple of times in the classroom, but mostly at my house. We dated for a few months after she graduated, but it broke off when she went to university in another province. What I did was illegal. Be that as it may, I don't really regret it. The relationship I had with Freyja was the most passionate and sexually satisfying I have ever been in. I've never got into trouble with the law, Freyja and I left on good terms.    /u/Hindu_Wardrobe:   Nice creative writing. But that's all this clearly is.    /u/JesusMonroe:   I was expecting it to end with ""tree-fiddy""    /u/The_White_Baron   Well, the limit of the function is 3.50. I'm just saying."

Perhaps there are some who prefer that feeling of domination by their emotions, to surrender to a tidal wave of hormones and allow their mind to be uncontrollably swayed from mood to mood.

I'm an investor,  and I look at a ton of property. Here are the things I actually give a shit about. Also,  don't ask a realtor. Realtors are the scum of the earth. They make used car salesmen look like boy scouts. This is probably the biggest investment you'll ever make.  Do not trust the weasel faced jackass who gets a commission off of this. NEVER EVER LET YOUR AGENT PICK YOUR INSPECTOR. NEVER. Pick one highly rated off of Angie's list who is ASHI certified. Follow that fucker like a dog in heat. Ask tons of questions. If your inspector makes your agent turn pale in the face,  that's your guy.     Ask about the foundation and the drainage.  Fixing a foundation can cost you anywhere from $40k-100 depending on the type of foundation and severity of damage. Let me repeat that: $100k potential repair cost. If it's a concrete slab,  ask if they have a sump pump.  Find out how much ""settling"" has occurred.  If you find a Crack and you can fit a screwdriver in it,  run like hell or get a structural engineer. Check for gutters.  Do you know what rain water next to your house does? It soaks into your foundation. That's a serious nightmare.   Seriously,  ask about the foundation.  Don't play games with this.  The roof! What type of roof is it? Asphalt shingle?  Tile?  Metal?  It's most likely shingle. How many layers on there? Some people just put a whole new set of shingles over the previous one. That's technically a no-no. It increases the weight on  the roof and you can't add another layer of shingles so you'll end up removing it all and starting all over. Is the attic properly ventilated? A really hot,  moist roof=mold and decaying roof deck support.   Plumbing.  Check the water intake pipe.  If there's a round ball shape near the entrance of it,  that's a sign that the pipes are lead.  Let me repeat thst--YOU'RE DRINKING WATER LACED WITH LEAD. Not good. Make sure those pipes are inspected.  Is it old ass Galvanized pipe? Christ, I can feel the pain in my ass already. Also that big beautiful tree in the front? It's roots may be slamming up against the pipes.  Serious money right there to fix. Looking for discoloration and bubbling paint. That's a sign of a leak.  Get a moisture  detector. If there's a leak,  it's going to be a pain to find and fix.  Check each water source for leaks,  water pressure,  and temperature.  Push the toilet a bit.  Does it jiggle like a fat man's belly? It needs a new plastic ring my friend.  Check and see if there is a pipe extending out of the roof.  That's the plumbing vent where the sewerage gas is released.  If you don't see it,  it's probably in your attic. Poisoning you.  Making you sick.  The electrical. Is this house an aluminium wiring/knob and tube death trap? Check for GFCI outlets in the kitchen and bathrooms so,  you know,  you don't shock yourself to death.  Buy one of those outlet testers at Lowe's.  Check and make sure the outlets are grounded and wired right. Also check your fuse box for recalled brands.  Many of them are fire hazards.  Water heaters. Get the model and the year.  Find out when this thing is going to die on you. Cause it will die on you,  you poor,  helpless mother fucker. I HATE water heater tanks in the basement.  When it dies and leaks,  guess where the water goes?  Into your foundation. It's also the lowest point in the house so have fun trying to drain the bitch. Upgrade to tankless point of use and thank me later.  If you have a gas water heater,  for the love of Christ,  make sure it's vented properly.  Those things release carbon monoxide and will kill you in your sleep.  Also,  any exposed wood or flammable material near the water heater is a recipe for a human BBQ.  Test the appliances.

If there's still a warranty and a company that services these appliances,  find out now.    Siding. Make sure there is a water barrier beneath that siding.  Vinyl is final.

defaultgems,2ec54t,EconomicSinkhole,12,Sat Aug 23 09:31:54 2014 UTC,"This really is not a very good post. Just a rant about things that no home buyer is realistically going to need to ask about. The best advice is to get a good home inspector. After that everything listed will be checked by the inspector, who likely knows a lot more than you will after reading a rant on reddit. I have a 21 page report from my home inspector detailing 2-3 actual problems and the rest are his thoughts on the house and possible points where improvements could be made. Nothing pointed out by this ""default gem"" would have been useful to ask a good inspector.   Foundation is usually the first thing the inspector looks at See above. You can add up to 3 layers of shingles to a house without compromising the roof. If you can do a tear-off each time it is better, but its not required. Again, no inspector should miss a lead pipe. Rather than messing with a toilet and worrying about a plastic ring you can fix yourself in an hour or less, check the pressure in the faucets and showers as that is more important than if the pipes are galvanized or not. I also like how he assumes the house wont be vented properly as if it wouldn't have killed the people currently living there.... A lot of states now require GFCI outlets in kitchens and bathrooms and the house may not pass inspection without them, but there is no reason to walk away from a house because it doesn't have them. Thats another cheap and easy fix. Be more concerned about weather the electrical box uses fuses or a circuit breaker, the later being preferred and this is not cheap or easy to change. Yes, age of water heater can be important but if it was not installed properly it would have killed the previous owners. Can be an expensive fix, but you likely wont have to deal with draining it since you can pay someone to replace it."

Shows your commitment to keeping things stable for your child and wanting to maintain your relationship with the child even if it means you have to live in the same house as someone you no longer love.  When it comes to custody it will be factored in.  Getting a divorce is the easy part.  Making it less terrible for your child should be your primary focus.  Getting revenge or moving on should be the last thing you worry about until papers are signed and you're the primary guardian.  Staying in the home also shows your connection to the place you live as your ""home"".

Revolution actually succeeded twice in the US - the first time creating the country by defeating the largest military in the world, and the second time through organized  solidarity to change some specific laws without fracturing the entire nation forever.  The US wasn't overthrown, it was corrected, as some wealthy assholes felt it was OK to trample the rights of people they thought couldn't do anything about it.  States like Virginia started nullifying federal slavery laws from the very beginning, and it took nearly a century but that sentiment of freedom spread, and eventually the replaced the unjust laws were undone by the revolutionaries led by Lincoln.

They might be cracking down on the next incarnation of the occupy movement, it could be a racial thing (Trayvon Martin).  But it will start with a local police force.    Marches start to border on riots and the police crack down harder.  Images and videos of the injustices perpetrated by the local police will go viral.  Outsiders will begin to travel to ground zero.  As the numbers of people in the streets swell the governor will ask for the support of the national guard.  This is the tipping point.  If the national guard can disperse the people without being too heavy handed it could end here.  But lets say they don't and someone freaks out and shots are fired into a crowd and protesters are killed.  The rest of the protesters rally force a few dozen national guard members into a building without immediate support.  Bullets vs stones fighting erupts in the halls.  Before anyone knows what is happening the building catches fire killing 34 national guard members and at least 2 dozen protesters.  Both sides point at the other for starting the blaze.    The military commander on scene with more than a little wounded pride comes down hard on the civilian populace with all the checkpoints and restrictions he can put in place.  Meanwhile the family and friends of the civilians killed in the blaze have armed themselves in earnest and are actively killing military patrols.    People who didn't care at first are starting to get sick of the restrictions.  Joe six pack can't go out after dark because of curfew.  Sally housewife can't get to the grocery store because it's outside her allowed zone.  Kids are stuck inside all the time for fear of violence and getting on everyone's nerves. Before too long these people who didn't care at all at first and fed up.  Probably not enough to risk their lives and actually join the fight, but they're prepared enough that something could push them over the edge.   Video of a small girl killed in the crossfire makes the news.  TV news claims that she was killed by insurgents but the youtube comments offer fairly definitive proof that she was killed by military fire.

The humans involved are still very much uninterested in harming their friends and family, and swore an Oath to the Constitution above all else, and have a duty to refuse illegal orders.  The bases those drones operate from are also not in a vacuum, they are fueled by guys driving trucks to them on roads, piloted by operators that eat local food and drink local coffee... do you think such people would feel safe eating food and drinking Starbucks if they were actively trying to kill the people serving them sustenance and delivering their fuel?  It wouldn't be all fighting, there would be sabotage and poisoning going on as well; anyone willing to wage a war on the public would have to go into hiding and hope supplies last forever... and a siege will always fail because the only thing needed to win is time, the ones hiding will always starve out.

It's a small step from shooting up terrorists on foreign soil to shooting up terrorists on domestic soil, I doubt it would matter so long as the briefing was phrased properly.   If an insurrection made it to where they were holding a ""siege"" state, they have won, the difficulty would be getting there. A nation-wide outbreak of uprising would be unlikely, one area would have to go first and that area would get quarantined and effectively would be the ones under siege, as you said they couldn't win from there. This would most likely discourage further attempts elsewhere."
defaultgems,2d11wn,Karma9999,1 point,Sat Aug 9 15:26:13 2014 UTC,"The military would be the ones under siege.  They are outnumbered a hundred to one at least, and soldiers aren't brainwashed zombies.  A military that attacks its own is a fractured force before it has even begun that attack - and a huge number of defectors would sabotage or steal equipment as they leave, and it would be impossible to know how many other soldiers that remain are willing to kill their own families or are simply staying where they can do the most good to resist.  China's Tienenman Square massacre, for example, failed initially as the local troops refused to fight their neighbors and other troops from distant regions had to be called in to follow orders; they needed to get hundreds of thousands of their troops into one city in order to have enough follow orders to actually be effective at squelching a peaceful protest.   That ""worked"" because there wasn't widespread action, but if even a second incident occurred in another city, the refusals and desertions would have been rampant and unrecoverable, and while armed revolt did not occur, if it did the Chinese government would likely have toppled, even without the advantage of a well armed populace."

Bases don't have their own power generators, refine their own fuels, and farm their own foods.  What you're imagining is some hind of distributed attack on American soil that goes unchecked or is started by civilians in some kind of organized fashion... that just doesn't happen.  If military attacks civilians, it loses.  Immediately.  If it does not, the issue never comes up.  Americans have no reason to attack military at all, the military is Americans which is why, if military would be asked to attack civilians so many soldiers immediately refuse.  But, in your hypothetical distributed attack scenario, the first time military attacks civilian targets, they start losing equipment and personnel to desertion.  They stop getting power delivered to bases, as well as fuel, water, and food.  Soldiers start worrying about poisons in the food they buy on their own dollar, roads and railways shut down, and the military technological advantage disappears.

Immediately.   yet have yet to see any actual proof. In the most recent equivalent of that, Israel don't seem to be losing currently.   In my opinion, the only way a rebellion could take off would be to be organised prior to the event and to have multiple uprisings at the same time. Otherwise it would be way too easy to control the information flow and isolate the individual areas, putting them down quietly or noisily, whichever helps the current PR situation."

The US lost in Vietnam, it was forced out of Iraq (and appears to be going back to try again for a third time now), Russia collapsed trying to occupy Afghanistan, and so on for all of history.  Force is a short term thing, occupation is a siege situation that always ends with defeat eventually unless outside support is found, and for a hypothetical majority-versus-minority US situation, the mojority population would always win.  Again, military personnel don't farm, don't manufacture gasoline, and don't attack the people they are sworn to defend.    I get that you're positive that the military wants to kill Americans and would be successful in doing so, but I simply can't agree.  That kind of attitude is unique to people that have never served their country, and is the opposite attitude of those that have done so.

The US needs a strong foothold in the middle east, Israel is a democracy with a good economy, seems like a safe bet.

I'm not certain about that though. A lot of Jews are very liberal and therefore ""anti-Israel"". I think being liberal and siding with Hamas are pretty big opposites though.  I'm not happy with how Israel is handling the whole situation but I can't see another option. Sucks that kids and innocents are dying, but war is war.   I think Israel needs to take control and police and rule Gaza itself. Slowly the terrorist threat will disappear. Hopefully.

War is gross.  Also, we are really only seeing one side of the story. The media in Gaza is being stifled by Hamas, we hear very little.

If you get a group of ten or so people together and wanna blow a couple hundred each there's really no reason to go to any of the Vegas nightclubs unless you're going to rent a table and do bottle service (imo).  Life pro tip would be to immediately tip the host/bouncers an extra hundred each to ensure the best experience.  It's definitely not the type of thing you want to do often but if it's a once a year Vegas trip it's completely reasonable, you only live once and all. As long as you buy a couple bottles they're not going to be angry if you order a couple buckets of beer or cheaper things if your goal is to drink a lot or you're not particularly fond of liquor. Generally beer is reasonable priced (compared to the bottles).  In reality, the bottle price has nothing to do with the liquor, it's just your large down payment to rent the space + bouncers. They specifically label it the price of a bottle to dissuade the type of demographic they don't want in their swanky clubs from going."

Complaining about the price is like complaining that the bottle of wine costs $60 at the restaurant when you can buy it for $25 at the liquor store or that you could make that same $80 steak for $30 at home.

You can call it ""narcissistic"" to be pissed at someone for running a red light without considering that their situation might be important enough to justify it. But I think since most people do it, you're painting with too broad a brush to say that 95% of people are narcissistic, or inconsiderate.

Even non-narcissistic, considerate, unselfish people still occasionally fail to have this realization that ZeroNihilist is talking about.   Maybe he doesn't describe it well because he is not talking about a ""realization.""  He is talking about disregarding the ""nobodies"" around you.

defaultgems,2avbtx,EatATaco,3,Thu Jul 17 00:29:04 2014 UTC,"Ok. Part one is fundamental attribution error, which is the phenomenon that people are naturally inclined to ignore other people's internal narratives, and only pay attention to the external cues. This is something that humans do, period. Saying that anyone who hasn't conquered that tendency is a narcissist kind of eliminates the purpose of the word narcissist in the first place (to describe a very particular mental condition). You could perhaps say that it's selfish to do what ZeroNihilist talks about in his story, but it's certainly not extraordinary in any way for a human to be that particular brand of selfish.  What I'm saying is that conflating this particular kind of selfishness with every other kind of selfishness doesn't do it justice, because of the psychological and evolutionary instincts behind it. Not justifying the behavior, just saying that lumping it in with other kinds of behavior isn't really a useful generalization. (If you've personally found it to be useful to generalize those two separate things together, I'd be curious how.)  As far as Dunbar's number, that's more to do with the fact that most people are able to understand that their close in-group are also protagonists, but they don't extend it any further than that. The same guy who mourns for his lost military buddy will have no issue shooting an innocent civilian if they're on the other side. This is primarily because even if you have the insight about others really being the protagonists in their own lives (not a common insight), you're still not going to have evolved emotional faculties for dealing with that knowledge because of Dunbar's number.  And regarding this:   he is not talking about a ""realization.""   I'm not sure if you read past the second paragraph of his comment, where he says:   ...I had this insight..."
