indepthstories,3dltwe,alcaron,3,Fri Jul 17 19:26:05 2015 UTC,They didn't have a choice. The BBC knew how valuable the show was - they're not stupid - but the media and Government had forced them into giving Clarkson so many final warnings over previous incidents that they were left with no option but to close it down when he punched a crew member.

You may not buy that the BBC had no choice, but it's the truth of it. You can't continually give final warnings only to roll over the next time something happens - at least, you can't if you're the BBC and subject to constant attacks from your commercial rivals and from the Government. They had to act.  If you consider WHY some senior staff didn't like him, there's a very good chance that it's because he brought negative headlines the BBC's way on a regular basis. The BBC is in a unique place where it's very vulnerable to attacks from Government and other media, due to the licence fee and Royal Charter. As we're seeing now, others can exert very strong power over the BBC so it hates negative publicity of this sort."

You believe that the BBC laid off Clarkson and effectively ended their single most profitable export, at a time when they are starved for funding due to the licence fee freeze, because some of the executive dislike Clarkson? Isn't the more obvious analysis that the BBC, under considerable pressure from other media and politicians due to previous Clarkson outbursts and having given final warning before, were left with no other real option when he hit the headlines yet again?"

My issue is it focuses on the petty mindedness of people and their selfish concerns on their own health (for example, the antibiotic hating crowd don't think about overuse developing resistant strains that would eventually affect us, but about ingesting these antibiotics because, drugs are bad?)  The article does not mention one possible, probably difficult to quantify danger: That genes would spread into the ecosystem causing unintended havoc. I'm just a layman. Perhaps this danger itself is minimal compared to the habitat destruction we engage in as a race."
indepthstories,3dd8w2,sunflowercompass,8,Wed Jul 15 13:56:47 2015 UTC,"In regards to the spreading of genes, I found this in a 2013 Nature article on GM crops:   “It seems inevitable that there will be a movement of transgenes into local maize crops,” says Snow. “There is some proof that it is happening, but it is very difficult to say how common it is or what are the consequences.” Alvarez-Buylla argues that the spread of transgenes will harm the health of Mexican maize and change characteristics, such as a variety’s look and taste, that are important to rural farmers. Once the transgenes are present, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to get rid of them, she says. Critics speculate that GM traits that accumulate in the genomes of local maize populations over time could eventually affect plant fitness by using up energy and resources or by disrupting metabolic processes, for example.  Snow says that there is no evidence so far for negative effects. And she expects that if the transgenes now in use drift to other plants, they will have neutral or beneficial effects on plant growth. In 2003, Snow and her colleagues showed that when Bt sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) were bred with their wild counterparts, transgenic offspring still required the same kind of close care as its cultivated parent but were less vulnerable to insects and produced more seeds than non-transgenic plants15. Few similar studies have been conducted, says Snow, because the companies that own the rights to the technology are generally unwilling to let academic researchers perform the experiments.   Snow's study is here: http://www.d.umn.edu/~jetterso/Ecological%20Genetics/documents/Transgenesreduceherbivory.pdf  Hope this helps."

The stultifying banality and pettiness of people was a deadening horror. It is the best explanation for the compliance of that particular  society.

They were taught that people who fled to the West were stealing from society by taking all the education that was provided to them, and then not giving anything back, a busybody who sincerely believed that would certainly think it was very moral to report anyone of doing so. You could call them stupid or idealists, but not petty or banal. To put it in today's terms imagine a redneck who sincerely believes that the US is under constant threat reporting his Sikh doctor because he wears a turban.   There's also people who do it to protect themselves and their livelihood (naming names in McCarthy Era America for instance), which is a moral gray zone.  I would not be surprised if a majority of the snitches were doing it to help their careers and other petty reasons though. I'm just saying they weren't all putrid, some were just stupid, and others could have had morally valid/ambiguous reasons to snitch.

indepthstories,3bjwcx,undercurrents,3,Mon Jun 29 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"I know the article is four years old, but I haven't found anything online to point to any changes in the laws since. I did find this from the Violence Against Women Act negotiations attempting to be passed in 2012:   Meanwhile, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the author of the Senate VAWA bill, went to the Senate floor on Thursday and plainly announced that House Republican leaders are blocking his bill ""because of their objections to [the] ... tribal provision.""  Leahy explained the provision, probably the least understood of the three additions in the Senate bill: It gives tribal courts limited jurisdiction to oversee domestic violence offenses committed against Native American women by non-Native American men on tribal lands. Currently, federal and state law enforcement have jurisdiction over domestic violence on tribal lands, but in many cases, they are hours away and lack the resources to respond to those cases. Tribal courts, meanwhile, are on site and familiar with tribal laws, but lack the jurisdiction to address domestic violence on tribal lands when it is carried out by a non-Native American individual.  That means non-Native American men who abuse Native American women on tribal lands are essentially ""immune from the law, and they know it,"" Leahy said.  The standoff over including VAWA protections for Native American women comes at a time of appallingly high levels of violence on tribal lands. One in three Native American women have been raped or experienced attempted rape, the New York Times reported in March, and the rate of sexual assault on Native American women is more than twice the national average. President Barack Obama has called violence on tribal lands ""an affront to our shared humanity.""  Of the Native American women who are raped, 86 percent of them are raped by non-Native men, according to an Amnesty International report. That statistic is precisely what the Senate's tribal provision targets.  The two sources say, to Cantor's credit, his staff has said they're willing to try to come up with other solutions to responding to violence against women on tribal lands, as long as the solution doesn't give tribes jurisdiction over the matter. But proponents of the Senate bill see the limited jurisdictional change as the only realistic way to address the problem....  ""Who is Eric Cantor to say that it's okay for some women to get beaten and raped?"" O'Neill said. ""If they happen to be Native women who are attacked by a non-Native man, as far as Eric Cantor is concerned, those women are tossed."""

Then, even with all the evidence presented that this guy is a dangerous con man who clearly seduces his victims with acts of extreme generosity and elaborate lies, his prison guards further fall into his trap and he is deemed not a threat so much so, that he is put in a position where he has very little surveillance.   I think we can safely assume one, if not both, of the men that escaped from the NY prison are psychopaths. One was even returned to the US from a Mexican prison where they said he was so bad and so immoral, they didn't want him. Yet, these men- who committed heinously unthinkable acts, even beyond that of just murder were the diagnosis of psychopath becomes a possibility- sweet talked themselves and faked a calm behavior that landed them both in a low security part of the prison where prisoners are allowed numerous comforts and privileges (I think it was called the honor block).  So knowing that a psychopath cannot be changed with behavioral or medicinal treatment (https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wicked-deeds/201401/how-tell-sociopath-psychopath), how do you protect society and weigh individual rights over the good of many?"

indepthstories,3abd48,dangzal,3,Thu Jun 18 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"I'm copying my comment from another sub, but...  Lily Marie Brown died of SIDS.  Not abuse; not shaking; not starvation; not dehydration; not exposure; not known and untreated medical needs.  Yes, SIDS is heavily correlated with unsafe sleeping practices (and strep infections of the heart). Yes, the foster parents used unsafe sleeping practices that the company/state should have educated them about, but they were ""unsafe sleeping practices"" that seem reasonable to an untrained eye: extra clothing and a light blanket while it's snowing outside, propped sideways with rolled towels so she wouldn't spit up and choke. Before the 1990s, the rolled toweled thing or front-sleeping was recommended to reduce the risk of SIDS.  When the foster parents checked on the baby, they called 911 and started CPR. Infants require special CPR and CPR licenses only last 2 years and require recertification in a 7-8 hour class. One of the reasons ""neglect"" was listed was because the CPR recertification was out of date.  Yes, there should be more funding and oversight for CPS. I don't think claiming this baby would be better off staying with her drug-addicted, homeless parents who lost more than 1 child to the system and used drugs throughout the pregnancy is the way to fix it."

CW: The whole business was premised on this concept called negative option. Which just sounds so creepy and draconian and weird, but the idea that if you don’t say no, we’re going to send you shit. It’s going to fill your mailbox, and we’re going to keep sending it unless you panic and beat us back. That was how the money was getting generated.  SFJ: Most times when you’re trying to get somebody to buy something, you are actively trying to get them to go and buy the thing, even if now it’s clicking or subscribing and subscription. Columbia House had this brilliant, perverse method which was [that] you sign up and then all you have to do is tell us not to send you things, and if you don’t remember that, we are going to sell you something and you have to pay for. And enough people will like that? Okay. And it was a profitable business. Could you ever get anyone to do that again?"

I used to have in my car a small case which only held about 50 cassettes.  I could carry 300 CDs in the same sized case.  For the record I still have my Columbia House ""ledger"" and purchase reports.  Over six years i purchased almost 400 CDs and averaged under $10/album which still is a good deal.   Now I pay $14 a month for unlimited steaming and 10 tracks. The hardest part is finding new music I like. I wonder if I have any of the old catalogs...
