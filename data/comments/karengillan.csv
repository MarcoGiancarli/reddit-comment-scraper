karengillan,3050gy,allen84,2,Tue Mar 24 17:51:13 2015 UTC,"I saw her on Sunday, after I assume she got some rest, she was amazing and all sorts of wonderfulness."
karengillan,3050gy,juanes3020,2,Tue Mar 24 20:48:48 2015 UTC,"""amazing and all sorts of wonderfulness"" is an excellent description of Karen! These are 2 very nice pictures of her. Thanks for posting them. :)"
karengillan,3050gy,juanes3020,3,Tue Mar 24 22:56:35 2015 UTC,"I was there the day of her Saturday arrival.  I was already not looking forward to the event, but to just go there for the experience for a couple of hours, and then leave, when I heard the news of her canceling late Friday night.  It was announced before 9 am Saturday morning, on their website and twitter, that she would make it ! This is while I was driving on the QEW on my way to Toronto. They said after 4 pm is her expected arrival.  I was ecstatic again.  They would condense both the 12 pm & 5 pm ticket holders with their updated 5:30 pm photo op time. As the security sees the mass growing number of people, they said they would honor today's ticket holders, tomorrow as well (Which was nice of them, but I wasn't going to come back tomorrow just to pay parking and another entrance fee again).  5:30 pm went by, there was approximately 700+ people outside in the lobby of the halls near the photo op room. And her plane was delayed (probably stuck at customs, or her people freshening her up with makeup and fix her hair to look more presentable)  Than a bit after 6 pm, she walked by everyone with her entourage towards the room 810, the photo op room.  The crowd erupted and cheered for her!  The amount of people that were there, I was guessing we would be there till about 10 pm for her to shoot and sign autographs for everyone.  But suprisingly the photos were all shot just bit after 7 pm ! that was insanely fast.     They had formed a line and setup a table outside across the photo op room for her autograph session.  I had my bro stand in line for me, Got the autograph by 7:15, and I was out.  I'm guessing they probably finished with everyone just after 8 or before.  I'm so glad she made it to the event, as she canceled Fan expo last year.  They were probably diligent in making sure she was here this time, as she was their biggest draw for Toronto Comicon this weekend.    Getting the photo op and autograph was an awesome experience with her.  She was so nice, gracious and polite.  Very cheerful mood she was in.  They said she was up till 5 am shooting in Boston for her new HBO show.  I'd imagine she was very tired with hardly any sleep.  What a trooper she was to do this for all her fans.  Makes me love this woman even more now."

karengillan,2zjv03,Wookiegroomer,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:32:19 2015 UTC,Why did she cut off her beautiful hair?
karengillan,2zjv03,bumperjack,2,Thu Mar 19 11:55:39 2015 UTC,And she still looks great with short hair. Maybe it's her that I like and not her hair. Nah. Her red hair is awesome.
karengillan,2zjv03,dallonv,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:32:44 2015 UTC,"For Gaurdians of the Galaxy.  She played the blue chick, Nebula."

karengillan,2yoluh,Username314159265,5,Wed Mar 11 15:00:33 2015 UTC,That hardly looks like her.
karengillan,2yoluh,Choreboy,2,Wed Mar 11 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think it's because her forehead is covered."
karengillan,2yoluh,cymon_tymplar,1 point,Wed Mar 11 23:31:59 2015 UTC,"The bangs and the way the curls frame her face make the shape of her head look different, plus the lipstick we aren't used to her in. I also believe her lips are overdrawn a bit, creating a different shape."
