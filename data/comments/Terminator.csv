Terminator,3dzpzz,Call_Me_Clark,0,Mon Jul 20 22:28:45 2015 UTC,you have a decent bias for what you are saying. Skynet would be a lot more integration savvy than a human corporation.

Terminator,3dzpzz,brockchancy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:15 2015 UTC,I always figured it was tiny little machines (nano sized) that made him appear like liquid. He'd have a sort of liquid metal he controls magnetically via these robots coated around these bots to save on resources (since he was a prototype for the integrative technology).  They would have to be mass produced and programmed in mass quantities to get a sophisticated enough T-1000.   I'd have to imagine the T-1000 would need a power source of some kind.

They immediately come under attack from a Hunter - Killer patrol and must either defeat them, escape is not an option.   Afterwards the adventures move into the building because dawn is coming and being outside in the daylight is essentially suicide. While exploring the building, someone stumbles upon a partial datafile on an old database. Something about an experimental AI that was being developed alongside skynet, maybe even as a back up system. Details are sketchy but they find an address of an old research facility. To get there, they're going to need a vehicle. Que part scrounge mission.  From there they fly to the research facility only to find its underwater/flooded/in an irradiated area or something. They puzzle their way in and find more information on the AI. It appears development was completed just before Skynet came online but it was never turned on. Your party struggles with the decision of whether or not the world can risk another AI running around.  Either way they find the location of the new AI and decide to visit the facility, either to activate or destroy it.  That's all I have so far but I hope it helps. Obviously scatter in battles with patrols and vehicles and stuff. Maybe some sentry bots in the old government building. Things like that."
Terminator,3dodih,Hurikane211,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:00:37 2015 UTC,"No that's great!  I came up with a few things and blended what you said in: - the game opens with them having been prisoners in a sky net labor camp in what's left of the California redwoods, and tech com attacking the camp. They flee the camp through a FOREST FIRE  while pursued by terminators. Eventually a tech com unit finds them and the players enlist -their commander is a middle aged black man(important later) who briefs a them on the research facility. They acquire and repurpose an aerial HK and fly to the facility which is flooded.  -on the way back they obtain Intel that sky net has been RELEASING human prisoners that have been brainwashed to achieve missions for sky net. -eventually they find out their commander is danny dyson who has infiltrated tech com to try and learn of its plans. He's doing this because he was promised that he could go back in time and save his dad from ""being killed by Sarah Connor"".  -at the climax, he is trying to send a T800 back to kill Sarah connor. If he is stopped, judgment day is prevented because the original T800 never goes back and miles dyson never designs sky net.  Miles dyson never dies. Sky net is never born. If they fail to stop him, everything happens as normal.  I also am considering this completely made up thing: all the brainwashed prisoners were promised a safe haven from the war, a utopia guarded by skynet where humanity can be SAFE. In a way it is the truth: sky nets defense servers are just prisoners, networked via neural net brain interface. They experience a permanent dream state where wish fulfillment is possible. To take out the defense servers so john Connor can reach the time machine, tech com has to kill all these sleeping prisoners. If instead they decide NOT to kill the prisoners, to insead save them, they can, but the defense grid stays up too long and Connors assault fails. The T800 may be sent back, depending on the players, BUT KYLE REESE WONT BE. Sarah Connor dies. Sky net wins"

The first 3 movies can be fitted into this also, as SkyNet sends its best Terminator models back to different time periods before its over ran. Because the Resistance have to decipher the Temporal Displacement Field information they can only uncover events one event at a time, this is why Reese says they blow up the machine after they send him through, he hasn't found out about the other incursions. Back in the future the Resistance discover another time incursion, decide the T-1000 is too tough for a human to fight so send one of their reprogrammed T-800s through, then decide that further study of the device is necessary in case SkyNet has done other things. This then leads to the discovery of the T-X incursion and the response to that. The earlier Genisys incursion can fit into this as well, as its just another time period that SkyNet choose to invade.  Once SkyNet starts messing with time travel that's when Judgement Day starts getting shifted about and SkyNet's evolution changes with the discovery of future technology today. It starts to fall apart for me when i try and fit in the assassination the third movie talked about and falls apart completely when Genisys shows Reese going through the Displacement Field. I got waaay too much spare time on my hands."

Terminator,3djly6,pants_conundrum,3,Thu Jul 16 21:28:04 2015 UTC,"Kyle knew what Sarah looked like from the photo, and probably had her full name as well (unlike Skynet). Kind of silly to assume that if he'd chosen instead to save one of the other Sarahs then that Sarah would both survive the terminator and have sex with Kyle and get pregnant. Sarah Ann Connor was a mother, so likely married and not available for a liaison with a guy who dresses like a bum and claims to be from the future."

As long as they are entertaining and make me think a little - that's all I ask. I love the originals so much that I relish a chance to return to the universe and bask in the lore again.  I loved the concept of Genisys, but the execution after the first 30 minutes is nothing but jarring and careless. It took a 1984 genre classic and decided to do away with any suspense or sci-fi conundrums. It had some good ideas (the social media angle was GREAT but it only had one line devoted to it) but it didn't pace them out or develop them correctly. There was no point to traveling to 2017 when it could have just as easily remained in the 1980s.   And I'll only say this once: SKYNET SHOULD NEVER HAVE A FACE TO EXPLAIN ITS ACTIONS TO THE AUDIENCE. Salvation screwed this up with Helena Bonham Carter, and now Genisys has repeated it with Matt Smith. It's the equivalent of having a hurricane explain itself once it's destroyed half the coast. It was scary in the first three films for a reason and always imbued a sense of dread with each coming scene.  The Nexus point time travel memories were a horrible addition to the mythology. As is Jai Courtney, who boldly chose to do nothing with arguably the most important character in the franchise. John Connor's team change is interesting but, again, not fleshed out correctly. Not once were the devastating ramifications of killing John Connor taken advantage of, nor the potential menace he can bring to the table that other super Terminators can't. He's just a gimmicky plot twist that was already ruined by the trailers."
Terminator,3dlo4i,JunkFace,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:08:08 2015 UTC,"I like you're thoughts on the sky net face, It's a horrible way to get a point across. If you have to overtly explain everything to the audience you either assume A: the audience is too stupid to pick up a more subtle way of getting the message across or B: the writer is lazy/bad.  Frankly when they do this I feel like I'm being spoken down to. Really? You've got to overtly spell out the plot for me?   And before you get on me about kyle Reese in Ti1 he is actually an example of a plot device that works. Sarah Connor is a fish out of water character who's been chased down for half an hour before we really know what's going on (maybe it was longer). Anyway it was pretty amazing because we have this crazy ass monster we know almost nothing about trying to kill her....and because of that and the nature of movies back then we had a real sense of tension.   TI1 would have been a good movie before the kyle Reese bridge monologue but he makes it all the more compelling.

Hollywood has this brilliant formula where they write a movie full of references to the older, better movies in the franchise and shit together a script where nothing makes any sense, there is 0 tension and a series of impossibly unlikely things happen.   Its lazy, bad storytelling but that's what we're stuck with now a days. Mediocre movies with lots of nods to the previous movies that actually had it right and Noone seems to notice/care that they're watching a massive shitfest.   For a lot of similar reasons I HATED jurassic world, big blockbuster movies are made for people who don't criticise or analyse what they watch, just just go to stare at a screen for 2 hours."

We all want to see a future war Terminator movie don't we? I know I've been waiting to ever since 1991 when T2 came out. Salvation wasn't perfect whatsoever, but it had some decent elements in it, and even though the fundamentals of what a Terminator movie should be was little to none...I thought it was ok for what it was.

That t800 could have ripped John to pieces as soon as it had one hand on him."

I went in with low expectations, I always do. The idea is to be pleasantly surprised, not underwhelmed by every little thing.  And yeah people get what they want out of the movies. Where I personally wish for something along the lines of art-horror, as the first one was, others legitimately just want to see something on par with the Transformers films. But the BO numbers don't lie this time around. This movie is forgettable. And I'm willing to bet that as time goes on /r/Terminator will get over the honey-moon phase and hate on this one just as much as T3 and Salvation.  Let's face it, we just wish we could be as jovial as /r/JurassicPark is at the moment."

Terminator,3cy8lx,PC509,2,Wed Jul 22 03:47:09 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it comes down to the previous films. You KNOW Sarah Connor and you know Kyle Reese from the previous films. This time, there is a lot less character development because they assume you already know their back story. If you didn't, then the movie comes off as odd and missing some things.   I'm old and grew up on the old stuff. So, I prefer the old characters. Still, the new ones aren't that bad. Emilia Clark has a Sarah Connor vibe from that 1984 era, but with the knowledge of the Terminators. She turns into a bad ass between 84-95. Jae Courtney, I thought, did a great job of Kyle Reese. He missed a few things (checking shoe size against foot, for example... too fast and wasn't paying attention, so the action didn't matter). He also didn't put in the same effort Michael Biehn did. Of course, both roles are extremely difficult shoes to fill. I think no matter who was picked for the role, it wouldn't have ever come close to matching the original. Overall, both did a good job.   You can't beat the original. If you grew up with the Terminator, you probably prefer the original. If you're new to the franchise, you probably prefer the more recent younger choices."
Terminator,3cy8lx,Thizzlebot,3,Sun Jul 12 21:23:42 2015 UTC,"He missed a few things (checking shoe size against foot, for example   I've seen it twice he checks his shoes size but its kinda quick.

Terminator,3cy8lx,Rathwood,-1,Wed Jul 22 03:46:19 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you about the new vs the old Kyle Reese, I have to say I definitely find the new Sarah Connor hotter. Apart from generally having what I would consider to be a more attractive face and physique, she's about 1000x more capable than the Sarah we saw in the first film. I mean, let's face it- most of what she did in that movie was scream and cry; granted, she wasn't as bad as Kate Capshaw in ""Temple of Doom,"" but she definitely wasn't impressing me. This new Sarah is a badass!"
Terminator,3cy8lx,kaces,12,Sun Jul 12 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"That's part of Sarah's character in the first one, she's just a waitress faced with an unstoppable killing machine. Her growth into t2 Sarah is part of her characters charm. From scared waitress to hardened warrior."
Terminator,3cy8lx,Rathwood,2,Sun Jul 12 02:44:49 2015 UTC,"True, and I loved that about T2. Even so, I still have to give fuller marks for physical attractiveness to Emilia Clarke  over Linda Hamilton."
Terminator,3cy8lx,tkulogo,5,Sun Jul 12 04:34:24 2015 UTC,"Sarah Connor in Terminator 2, even to this day, defines a lot of what I find hot in women.

Terminator,3cy8lx,Rathwood,3,Sun Jul 12 05:43:17 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, but a lot of that may have to do with cultural relevance. Terminator just doesn't seem to be as popular or as talked about as it was before."

In SCC, we see multiple time travellers travelling in multiple occasions.   As for the time machine in 1984, remember that it was incomplete without the CPU from the T800, something presumably John couldn't build or substitute in 2017. It's also likely that Pops knows more as a pure Terminator, and not a hybrid.   Your first bonus isn't a plothole, it's just you whining."
Terminator,3d1u3p,StealthRabbi,6,Mon Jul 13 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"also,i belive the questions who sent back pops,and why was pops given files on how to make a time displacement machine are something we would find out in the next movie....did you think it was a plothole in lord of the rings first movie that they didn't tie everything up in a neat 2 hour package? or did you understand that there were more movies coming to answer the questions?"

Terminator,3d1u3p,-bonesaw-,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:59:04 2015 UTC,"Both John Connor and Pops was from a time after the Time Displacement Equipment is created (2029). We don't know when Pops was sent back exactly, so this is all speculation, but it shouldn't be much later than 2029 when John Connor was sent back (since the war was coming to an end), so they should have similar knowledge about the TDE.  Then they both went to a time when time displacement was still being invented or not even invented yet (1984 and 2017).   So they should both have the same knowledge on how to create a Time Displacement Equipment. So John Connor should have been able to build the Time Displacement Equipment as easily as Pops."

The JC in the movie is a product of a different time line, just as Pops is. They go on to say that Pops is something to the effect of a relic from an obsolete time line.  At this point, time travel, alternate timelines, and paradoxes are not oversights in the terminator franchise, they are established mechanics.   To me, a good take away from this movie is now there is a timeline where skynet is active and there is no John Conner."

Terminator,3d0lp3,BKSMASSIVE,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:54:11 2015 UTC,You seem to have missed all the major parts of the film. I suggest you watch it again.  Everything you have questioned was explained in the film.
Terminator,3d0lp3,I_Like_Spaghetti,-1,Sun Jul 12 15:33:20 2015 UTC,"What... time nexus quantum gobbly-gook?  They can try to explain spaghetti monsters and invisible dragons when the writer is playing god.  The fact is, a timeline should have consistency meaning if they change the future by changing the past those changes need to stay consistent in the current timeline so no matter how you try to explain how O'Brien in this new timeline met Sarah and John who clearly existed his timeline in 1984 killing the Terminator that they allegedly saved him from doesn't stand up to the changes in causality that took place.  There was no meeting in this new timeline with O'Brien all the events leading up to that were changed and rendered mute.  It was just bad writing and lack of thinking which equals magic pixie dust.  The O'Brien they meet is from a timeline that they destroyed thanks to the changes in the beginning of the movie.  And the 1984 John Connor really cannot exist on that new timeline either no matter how they try to bandaid the story with pixie dust.  If he did travel back, it would have to be to a timeline where his 1984 birth took place not to a timeline where it didn't.  He appears in a timeline that his birth never took place, how can that ever be explained meaningfully?  Short of the writer made it so arguments.  In which case anything goes... which is what happened in this story.   If there was any consistency with the major timeline change, then John should not exist and O'Brien should never know Sarah and Kyle based on the simple fact they killed the original T1 and jumped out of 1984.  It falls apart so badly I reject any of the bad attempts to remedy it with nexus quantum gobbly gook blather.  That was just stupid and weak plot stitching.     Just thinking about the implications of leaving 1984 itself bodes badly for what they did to this movie.   What happens if Sarah and Kyle do not concieve John in 1984?  The answer, he cannot exist.   The 1984 John Connor was already rendered terminated in the new 2017 timeline so could not jump back to that timeline where he does not exist.  At best, he would have to end up in another timeline where he was concieved in 1984 if any consistency with time is respected, which is not... so anything goes with Genisys."

Terminator,3cxpmj,johnboyjr29,2,Sat Jul 11 18:40:40 2015 UTC,I think the idea behind The Terminator was that it was a predestination paradox (i.e. John wins war and sends back Kyle > Kyle impregnates Sarah > John is born and becomes leader > John wins war and sends back Kyle > etc.). It's very much like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  But the subsequent sequels basically scrap that and said the future can change and alternate timelines are made.
Terminator,3cvenl,Kill_Frosty,7,Sat Jul 11 02:29:28 2015 UTC,I want it to just be a straight up war movie that takes place after judgement day. I dont want any time travel.
Terminator,3cvenl,ThandiGhandi,3,Sat Jul 11 02:55:23 2015 UTC,"This! I know time travel is a significant theme, but I'd love there to be more focus on just the future war. Maybe the story of how John comes across the T-800 he reprograms and sends back in T2."
Terminator,3cvenl,Turkey_le_Poultry,3,Sat Jul 11 03:26:25 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue is actually the visual aesthetic.  Every movie in the franchise that's shown us the future, barring Salvation, has this...Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon look to it. With chrome robots and brightly colored plasma weapons at night and stuff.  Salvation was a lot of daytime action with some dirty, older robots and ordinary guns. As such, I'd love the sequels to get to the point I described above, namely plasma weapons."
Terminator,3cvenl,JBPBRC,2,Sat Jul 11 07:43:03 2015 UTC,"I would presume the sequels would explore the events leading up to Skynet sending a T-800 to 1984, which would mean John becoming the leader of the resistance and the humans gaining an advantage in the war.|   Kyle: It had no choice. Their defense grid was smashed. We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence!"
Terminator,3cvenl,requium94,-1,Sat Jul 11 06:10:59 2015 UTC,Not about the war. That's for sure. For some reason everyone who has directed a sequel after the first two seems to think fans are not interested in the actual war between Skynet and humanity.
Terminator,3cw2sn,OrangeKookie,11,Sat Jul 11 06:50:47 2015 UTC,"First off, how did john connor even get to present day if he got disintegrated or something in the time machine   Probably the same way every T-1000 does.   The T-800 pops is sure a more adapted robot but it's way too human-like in the movie.   Not really. The T-800 here is about as humanized as the one in T2, maybe even slightly less since the one in T2 really really needed a vacation.   I don't get why he didn't resist to the police and just bash their heads in (pg-13 I guess)   No, he didn't want to risk Kyle or Sarah getting caught in crossfire and didn't have enough ammo on him (he specifically says this) to ensure a quick enough favorable outcome.  After being arrested the T-800 maintains his cover up until the T-3000 shows up, which is a far greater threat than any mere police station, and proceeds to do his thing.   The worst part of the film is the whole going back in time to stop genisys concept. Why didn't they just go back a month or even a week before it launched?   They didn't go back in time to stop Genisys. At all. The only time a protagonist went back in time was Kyle Reese to stop the original T-800.  They went forward in time to stop Skynet, and, being a future where Judgment Day was 20 years delayed they had no idea what the world was going to be like other than it wasn't going to be a nuclear wasteland with killer robots everywhere.   And when they're at the launch place and john connor decreased launch time to 15 minutes or so, why aren't reese, connor, and the T-800 hauling ass and trying to quickly set the bombs before john connor got out from the lightning stick?   They had way too many bombs to plant before the T-3000 could get out. They could've hurried a bit more, yes, but there's no way they could've planted them all and gotten out beforehand."
Terminator,3cw2sn,JBPBRC,2,Sat Jul 11 07:37:00 2015 UTC,You didn't watch the movie and listen to the fact that Pops explains that magnets don't agree with the new John causing the nanomachines to react with the magnet glove.

This was prompted by Reese having told her the ""Go in a straight line and don't look back""  in order to convince her to let them go into 2017, as well as Reese's questioning of the T-800's loyalty/competency since it had not been there waiting for them in 2017.  Essentially, the T-1000 that had been waiting for Reese had tried to kill young Connor in 1973. While out at a lakeside cabin, the T-1000 attacked and killed her family in pursuit of Sarah. Her father told her the ""straight line"" in order to get her to swim away and escape. Connor was saved by the T-800 that day, and they hadn't been separated since."

Terminator,3coduh,ceaRshaf,4,Thu Jul 9 14:00:49 2015 UTC,"What I'd like to know in this timeline is where Pops came from. It could be that there is another John Conner born to this Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner that sent it back. In fact, Pops has some suspicious qualities. How does a grunt Terminator infiltration unit know how to construct a time travel device? Whoever sent him back obviously knew he'd need that knowledge, since I don't think that's standard knowledge programmed into a T-800, a unit known to be captured and reprogrammed by the Resistance. He also demonstrates further knowledge of things like a temporal rift (or something to that effect), where a timeline is significantly altered. How is such knowledge essential to either infiltrating and killing the resistance or carrying out a protection mission? Even T-Conner didn't know how to build one. Something is extremely fishy in Denmark."
Terminator,3coduh,LepNdaHood,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:25:32 2015 UTC,"My theory is that the next movies will present us with a great twist. Pops was sent by T-Connor himself to protect his mother to make sure that he exists. The T-1000 is actually sent by the Resistance in the future since they know that John Connor turned dark and so they decide to terminate him in the past.  I think T-Connor was bluffing in the parking lot when he claimed that he is free to kill his mother and father, fact proven by the way he tried to convince them to join his side instead of killing them right away."
Terminator,3coduh,LepNdaHood,2,Thu Jul 9 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"That theory makes sense. Personally, I think T-Conner could be motivated by fear. He's been told all of his life that his survival is absolutely critical for the survival of the species. This is bound to make one have not only a pathological sense of self-importance, but also an intense fear of death. This could be what makes him a good leader for the Resistance. He plays it safe from behind the line and uses his soldiers like a master chessman because he knows that if he loses, everyone loses. Once captured, his sense of self-preservation may have taken over and he decided to continue to exist as a terminator over dying of the madness that comes from rejecting the transition. My theory is that T-Conner is actually T2 Conner. The one who sent back Pops was Neo-Conner from this new continuity."

What if sky net took this opportunity to not just upgrade but reprogram Pops?   So why not kill Sarah and Kyle? Well Alternate realities were mentioned in the film. Maybe sky net just doesn't know how the new reality will play out so Pops is just gathering information.
Terminator,3coduh,crocshark,2,Sun Jul 12 16:20:58 2015 UTC,"Here is the biggest plot hole I saw, so if John Connor is raised by Sarah after genisys events then would she warn him of the ambush by skynet?"
Terminator,3coduh,bbelt16ag,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:38:30 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. The movie made sense to me (except the last second thing as well). Only thing I don't quite agree on is I don't think that T-Connor was raised by he Sarah in his timeline. I think he was still raised by the original Sarah and then transported to the new timeline (kind of like old Spock in the new Star Trek movies)
Terminator,3coduh,Donnutz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:05:59 2015 UTC,He can't be the old John since he knows about the stuff Sarah and Pops do in this movie beforehand.

Terminator,3coduh,Doright36,0,Fri Jul 10 19:07:47 2015 UTC,"@SeaRshaf  Nice part post, albeit have a few questions for you  1.) In the scene where Sarah demands that John prove his legitimacy, how is it that he was able to convince her? What I mean is, this Sarah(Emila Clarke)is not the Sarah John knew(Hamilton) and she grew up under different circumstances. Everything about the two of them would, should be different. Their past(from the moment her parents were killed). Personality, experiences, likes and dislikes. For example, John says she was sucker for Elton John. This Sarah may not have liked him.  2.)What is your opinion on the whole “John killing his parents” issue. The exposition was lacking in the movie and it seems like they handwaved it without fully explaining why he could kill them? John simply says that they are “exiles” in time  but that is all that is said on the matter. It is almost as if the movie acknowledged this issue but said ""screw it"". In-Universe, it seemed to me that John wasn't entirely sure himself on what would happen and his  reasoning seemed to be  based off a theory. And obviously, it would be unwise for him to take such a gamble when the backfire can result in his death.  That said, if think it could be possible. The creators have already confirmed that there are in fact multiple timelines/universes. The Kyle and Sarah we see in Genysis are alternate versions from  the original Kyle and Sarah(Hamilton) in T-1. The former two have yet to conceive John in this timeline. So essentially, they are not this John’s(T-3000 John) parents persay, if that makes any sense. When or if they[Clarke and Jai] have John, this version of John would be different since he we would be 30 years younger and etc. The only way to stop 2029 John/T-3000 from existing would be to kill the original Sarah Conner(Hamilton) from his timeline(2029), who is long presumed  dead. Although, this only really works if you don’t think of it linearly, but instead as sport, alternate/parallel timelines."
Terminator,3coduh,FullMetalJacket13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:19:07 2015 UTC,"1) T-Connor also knows where their hideout is and makes it clear that she cannot run since he knows every move she makes because she told him in the future and she is the one that trained him. This means that this T-Connor is made from the not yet born in the movie John Connor. Maybe Sarah believes that because there is no more Skynet she is free to have John, with no war, and no resistance. However we know that Skynet is alive and Judgement Day is just postponed.  2) I take from that that it was just T-Connor's opinion not a fact about how things work. Also I believe he was bluffing and did not dare kill them, since he could have done that way earlier and fast. But yet he tries to persuade them to become like him. This is not what normal Terminators do. Also, this is why I believe that Pops is sent by T-Connor himself to assure that he stays alive in 1973 when probably the Resistance will send the T-1000 to kill young Sarah and prevent T-Connor.  I believe the movie still holds a linear timeline and there is no need for multiple universes."
Terminator,3coduh,FullMetalJacket13,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"Ok, I know this is a film, but this timeline stuff is really annoying me. Here is why...  When 'Pops' is sent back and basically alters the future of both T1 and T2, then John Conner does not exist as he will never be born. At no time does Sarah and Kyle go back to 1984, pork, and then have baby John. For him then to be the leader of the resistance. Instead they jump forward to 2017.  Also how can Detective O'Brien have memories of events that didn't happen. He didn't time travel, he grew old. Sarah and Kyle never went to the police station. 1984 T-800 never trashed the Police station, Sarah and Pops killed him.  The only way this can be explained is if you subscribe to the multiple timeline theories of Time Travel. i.e. that the moment someone (or something) travels through time a new timeline, separate but running concurrently with the original exists, and that travel between timelines is allowed. Therefore the film makers need to make it clear that this can happen in the Terminator universe, but wait no, they can't as T1 is heavily based on the one timeline theory that time can be altered and new futures created by the actions of time travel. The Sarah-Kyle-John loop that is created in T1 exemplifies this perfectly.  The only way for this to work would be for T-Conner to jump back before 1973, wait for Pops (new future is created) and then jump forward to 2014. Of course that doesn't explain how Pops is sent back.  Speaking of Pops, how can he grow flesh, but still age? He says it in the film that it will take a while for him to grow back the flesh for his arm, yet he cant just keep himself looking young. He could simply pull the flesh off his face and wait for it to grow back, boom, young T-800 again. I know, I am being pedantic. It would have been cool if they had shown him with a young arm/hand and an old one.  So in conclusion nope, I don't agree that it makes sense. Sorry. If I am missing something that is obvious, let me know."

Terminator,3cscc3,BlahYourHamster,3,Fri Jul 10 11:18:09 2015 UTC,They are in an alternate timeline. There basically exists two copies of them in the timeline at the end of the film.

Terminator,3cscc3,ScoobehDoo,3,Fri Jul 10 19:02:38 2015 UTC,"Did anyone catch the mid credits scene? They didnt stop Skynet at all. I honestly think it was an elaborate plan to make them unkowingly give up. In every scenario they always end up toppling Skynet. In this instance Skynet gives them a reason to THINK that theyve won, so theyre no longer going to try and stop it, while it merely bides its time underground"
Terminator,3cscc3,brandoss77,2,Sun Jul 12 03:19:12 2015 UTC,"No, Pops is from an aborted timeline that no longer exists. You are thinking about time wrong as far as it relates to Terminator. Time isn't a straight line, it's not linear (I swear I'm not going for wibbly-wobbly here...) Pops could exist if skynet didn't come to power again because in his timeline skynet existed and he was created. When he traveled it created a new timeline based off his actions. The time he came from no longer exists, but he still does because he's from a different time. The actions that brought him into existence originally, now no longer have to happen because they already did in another now non-existent timeline.  That's why John Connor says he could kill Sarah, it doesn't matter if Sarah lives or dies, technically SHE isn't his mother, the version of her from his timeline is."
Terminator,3cscc3,Freyaka,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:52:06 2015 UTC,"Genisys does seem to be hinting at something like this; and I'm thinking the end game is Matt Smith Skynet traveling back to the original timeline to impregnate Sarah Connor with Kyle's DNA.   However, I think the Skynet of T1 is inevitable with or without the Connor's existence, so Skynet requiring them to exist is kind of weird. That being said if Skynet of the Matt Smith variety has evolved to a certain level of temporal superiority it might feel the need to manipulate all of the timelines to ensure its singular specific existence. So does Matt Smith's Skynet see itself as greater to the other versions of Skynet?"

By going to 2017 she doesn't exist from 1984-2017 and therefore cannot be killed there?  Also by then Sarah would be 52 years old.  We don't want John to be at risk of being born with birth defects and stuff, right?   4) The scan revealed that the t-800 was a non functioning unit.  The terminators instantly realized it was a trojan horse ruse."

Terminator,3cpfp3,CORNDOGCOMMANDO,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:08:17 2015 UTC,"1 - not shown...probably the same in 1984  2 - the one who sent Pops knew about the events of the first movie, at least. Also, Pops says files about his ""sender"" identity were erased , and they reasoned that its just so the sender stays anonymous and doesn't turn up on skynet's radar, so it cant prevent them from sendind Pops. Other than that, the more info Pops has, the better, so nothing more is erased  3 - THAT is, IMO, the big plothole of the movie...why travel forward in time att all? I'm guessing for getting the element of surprise, so they can hide and dont have to deal with more terminators....but even so, why not go back in time a couple of years before 1997 or 2017...  4- dont remeber....i think they just detected john in the back of the truck....more importantly, why do they need a humanoid-terminator-trooper to drive a truck? couldnt they just put on a google-car dongle in it? A machine driving a truck like  man seems unescessary and suspicious.....(but then again, they did get cauth, and maybe the machines just lacked the wit to see it coming miles away)"

It's a story about killer robots - other than the obvious issue of money, why on earth try and make it family friendly??? Kids under 12 weren't even born when T3 came out!"
Terminator,3cku5y,moiadipshit,3,Thu Jul 9 08:25:53 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely. Hopefully the movie producers will follow Mad Max: Fury Road's example and realise they can make grown up movies for grown ups and still be successful.
Terminator,3cku5y,Quandon,6,Thu Jul 9 10:08:48 2015 UTC,"It's this studio obsession that it will somehow reduce their profit if they actually market it to a target audience. This scatter-gun approach to appeal to everyone is just committee film-making at its worst. In terms of franchise cinema too, it's strange that they can't move on without Arnold. I love what he's brought to the role over the years but even the biggest of franchises have recast and made great sequels/reboots."
Terminator,3cku5y,moiadipshit,8,Thu Jul 9 10:23:56 2015 UTC,"Personally I thought Arnold was hilarious and it at least made a little sense to me.  He'd been protecting a girl while she was growing up and Sarah said she was trying to get Pops to fit in.  I can understand not liking the shift of tone, but at least to me it makes sense.  When comparing T1 Arnie to T5 Pops it makes sense why Pops has a sense of humor whereas T1 Arnie doesn't at all."
Terminator,3cku5y,Niceguydan8,3,Wed Jul 8 23:56:43 2015 UTC,"T2 had the comedy, but it worked well. It wasn't over the top, and it was natural. A programmed cybernetic organism could pull off those things and to us, it'd be funny. T3 really went out of their way and it wasn't natural. It was forced. It didn't work. TG was a little better than T3 in the comedy aspect, but some things (COPS, while funny, was over the top and forced and out of place for a Terminator movie - would be excellent as a Sgt. Candy short someplace).   Terminator 1 was definitely a horror movie. 2 was more of an action movie. 3... Cheesy action movie. Genisys was another action movie with some cheesy moments, but far from a horror. T1 you were terrified of the future and the robot invasion. After that, it was more comical and less terrifying. The robot wasn't so much a killer anymore."
Terminator,3cku5y,PC509,3,Fri Jul 10 04:20:34 2015 UTC,"That kind of bs started it T2 though it became really bad from T3. Too bad. Without that, Terminator movies would be taken more seriously."
Terminator,3cku5y,Nkavoj,8,Wed Jul 8 18:48:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah T2 has a bit of it, such as ""I need a vacation"", but there was so little of it that it was easily forgivable, and in a movie that tense you need a little humor. But in T3 and TG it was just too much. That 'bad boys' song playing being the cringiest part."

People love to talk about how great T2 is (And I agree, hell its one of my favorites!), but lets face it, T2 was NOT a horror movie. There was little suspense, it was more of an adventure movie than horror. But T1, that's a GREAT example of a horror/sci-fi done right. That's up there with the ranks of alien 1 or even predator 1. Of course people responded to the humor in T2 so obviously for T3, IMF studios said ""hurr durr lets make the terminator funny."" And after that it's just been just a big downhill slope. So basically, what I'm trying to say is: Don't down on the humor, because don't get me wrong some of its pretty hilarious, down on the fact that there is humor. This is supposed to be a horror series, it just puts it on a lower level than other films by making it more of a crowd-pleasing ""hey look remember this thing from the other terminator???"" movie."

I wanted to see it. I'm getting bored with everything happening under everyone's noses (ok so a few people saw the liquid terminator but I want the police to react to it properly and it make the news/media etc). I would've thought that would've been a different approach.  Instead they surrender only to break out again when they could've just escaped on the bridge, with Kyle and Sarah ducking into cover on the floor and Arnold stopping the police and obviously surviving gunshot wounds."
Terminator,3cku5y,Obtuse_1,0,Wed Jul 8 22:55:20 2015 UTC,Frankly I say it was lack of coherent story line which drove the idea to fill in the snore-fest with comedy filler. What's weird is it was almost the same style of crappy humor that was in T3...not exactly one of it's strong suits. So why'd they try it again? Good question.
Terminator,3cku5y,jrodx88,-3,Wed Jul 8 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"They were well aware of the poor reception of T3. Did they not analyze or read reviews to understand where it failed, because if they did, the cheesy ""talk to the hand"" type attempt at humor is one thing that is always brought up. You'd think they would have tried to avoid that same criticism."
Terminator,3cly1n,GamerChef420,2,Wed Jul 8 23:00:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly! The further I get from the movie the more I grow to dislike it. The future scenes were some bullshit, patriotic, circle-jerking victory party. In T1's future scenes Kyle Reese is crawling around in the rubble and seeing his partner vaporized by giant murder machines; it had weight and the machines instilled fear in the audience. We were afraid of the future that awaited.   In Genisys the assault on the prison camp should have been way more suspenseful. It seemed like the characters knew they were going to win and the assault was a set piece and not in keeping with the first two movies."

Genisys isn't simply a killer app, Genisys is an operational system and also hardware, a massive array of servers hosted at Cyberdyne's HQ. Kyle's parents didn't simply give him Instagram for his birthday, they gave him a Cyberdyne Systems tablet loaded with the Genisys operational system. There are many other stupid things about this FAQ and I'm not even bother naming, anyone with half a brain can notice it.  ALSO, there's no indication that Pops killed the original T1000 sent after Sarah's parents. All we see is him shouldering an anti-tank Carl Gustav recoilless rifle with a smoking barrel; by looking at the effect on the T1000 caused by 40mm grenades, we can sort of imagine what kind of damage it would suffer after being hit by a HEAT 84mm ammunition, the T1000 by may have simply exploded in a larger area and take longer to reassemble itself. IN FACT, the T1000 chasing Reese in 1984 might actually be the same one that killed Sarah's family.  Fucking Gawker writers, they ought to be sent to a Skynet labor camp."

When the Robert Patrick Terminator was sent out, the past changed the future so Judgment Day was postponed. So that's where I got confused too"
Terminator,3clk8i,jinpayne,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it wasn't clear in Genisys, which was disappointing. I can buy the movie slightly more knowing it's an alternate timeline, but it's too easy and it made for a lackluster story."
Terminator,3clk8i,zolnir,2,Thu Jul 9 16:16:26 2015 UTC,This is Genisys. I theorize that is the original birth of the destructive SKYNET (and subtly the other opposing SKYNET during post credits). So you can say that all the other Terminator series happened because of the events in Genisys.
Terminator,3clk8i,ceaRshaf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:41:08 2015 UTC,"Which, in my opinion, sucks. I think it's pretty lame for the writers to basically co-opt the story (and John Connor) for this movie.

Terminator,3clk8i,ON020,2,Thu Jul 9 16:25:13 2015 UTC,"T5 already alters the future and from the start negates the T1 and T2 outcomes.

I'd like to see a nice chart incorporating all that way back to that ""original/prime"" timeline"
Terminator,3ch4k8,FullMetalJacket13,3,Wed Jul 8 13:43:58 2015 UTC,"Time line one:   Skynet is created. John Conner sends back a resistance fighter in 2029 to 1984 to protect his mom. This all happens naturally. The events of T1 have not happened. No T-800 in 1984. Time travel happens for the first time in this timeline as this is the origin timeline.  Time line two:  Kyle Reese arrives to 1984. Bangs mommy Conner. The child that is born is named John Conner based on the fact that Kyle told Sarah her son is named John. Kyle has no idea he is the father and dies before the end of the movie. Sarah takes the picture at the end of the movie and John ends up having it in 2029. This is a different John as Kyle is now his father. He looks different than the John from the first timeline but was raised by Sarah Conner to become the leader of the resistance. John gives Kyle the photo of Sarah from the end of T1 and sends him back to 1984.  Time line three: (Terminator movie we've all seen)  Kyle arrives to 1984 to protect Sarah Conner and has intimate knowledge of her based on the photo she took in the second time line. This photo could only exist if the events from T1 have already happened in the second timeline.  From here the time lines start to stack and are different each time, but you can still peel back the layers to see how things happened.  I don't know how to work in the new movie. Just because of the fact that Matt Smith fucked up shit in 2029 just after Kyle was sent back (this never happened before because Uncle Bob hasn't been sent to 94/95 yet). Matt Smith must have traveled from a distant future (not buying another dimension) to ensure Kyle was sent back in order to convert the existing John to a T-3000. However, that John Conner was now never born since Sarah and Kyle never banged and they jumped to 2017, a reality with no John Conner. Instead we have a JC T-3000 that traveled to a reality where he never existed and he actually creates the Matt Smith Skynet. It just doesn't make any sense to me. With the previous movies you can figure out easily how it all went down. But with T5, too much info has been left out to accurately sift through the timelines."

In T2, the terminators are sent back to 1995, not 1997. I don't think Pops and the T1000 were sent back before Reese was sent back in Genisys. Otherwise, John would have known about Pops since Sarah would have told him, presumably? Also, I don't think think the branch of Genisys should start off of T3/4.

It's meant to be a loop (Cameron actually said so). Theoretically, there's a Timeline 0 where somebody else sends Reese, who fathers John, who creates the loop.   I don't think Pops and the T1000 were sent back before Reese was sent back in Genisys. Otherwise, John would have known about Pops since Sarah would have told him, presumably?   Correct, however you'll note that Reese is coming from T3/4's Timeline 3, and only arriving in Pops' Timeline 4. This is why Reese didn't experience a timeline where Pops raised Sarah.   Also, I don't think think the branch of Genisys should start off of T3/4. Genisys gave no indication that anything after T1 ever took place.   Genisys gave a nod to T2 in a comment by John, but otherwise you're right. However, 3 isn't directly contradicted, so it's still canon. Salvation is obviously retconned away."

By sending a T-800, skynet unintentionally created it's own existences. Also by creating a time machine it helped creates it enemy John Conner. If skynet is aware of the first loop, it should send a Terminator to send to insure it's existences and destroy the time machine or not build a time machine if skynet is inevitable."
Terminator,3chx3l,mukku88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"Just looking at James Cameron's intentions for his first two self contained movies, I was always under the impression that the T-800 is the reason the T-1000 exists, but not sky net.  Kyle Reese tells Sarah about the evolution of the Terminators and doesn't mention the T1000 r liquid metal, because it doesn't exist. And never has in the loop from T1. Only when miles Dison squires the T800 chip, is Skynet accelerated by decades. It's still the same Skynet, made by the same program as the original, only now it's technologically ahead of itself by 20-40 years.  That's why there's a T1000 in T2. It's the killer 2025? Skynet has if it starts with T800 tech instead of having to build it from the ground up.  That's where my original question comes from. Without the T800 tech, would Miles Dison have been the one to make Skynet, or as Genysis showed us, did his son Danny, as an adult following on his fathers footsteps, create the tech that lead to the Skynet of the 1984 movie?"
Terminator,3chx3l,mukku88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:40:20 2015 UTC,"I believe T-Conner use him to build skynet/genisys, T-1000 prototypes, and the time machine. Whether Miles or Danny can build this tech without the future intervening is up for discussion. T2 never felt as contained as T1, the fact skynet has enough time to send more than one terminator raises more plot holes. Why not send a T-1000 to 1984 if the T-800 is a downgrade, you would think it would send it's best machine."
Terminator,3chx3l,mukku88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:04:11 2015 UTC,"Again though, using the logic from my above post, they couldn't send a T-1000 to 1984 because it didn't exist. Humans send a human, and Skynet sent their best Terminator. The accelelerated skynet sends its best Terminator( T1000), to kill the kid, because a kid should be an easier target. But even from a screenwriting POV, they could've sent T1000 to 1984, but I think in 1991 it would've been to cost prohibitive without CGI to create sets that looked only 6 yards old. In 2015, 1984 is pretty retro so it's better to do that now, rather than back then."
Terminator,3chx3l,Donnutz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:17:00 2015 UTC,But this is from T2 timeline with an accelerated skynet the T1 skynet ceased to exist. So Kyle would send from a T2 timeline if T1 T-800 cause Skynet to accelerate. I think the events from T2 caused Skynet to accelerate. If skynet is inevitable by trying kill before it's created is only delaying skynet make it more advance.
Terminator,3chx3l,reece1495,2,Thu Jul 9 22:51:29 2015 UTC,"Also, maybe Pops and the T-1000 who got sent to 1973 are the same that were suposed to be sent to 1995 in T2, only that because of events in T2, 3 and 4, skynet decided to send the T-1000 to kill a pre-teen Sarah instead of a pre-teen John."

Terminator,3cf788,clone3131,3,Tue Jul 7 13:10:35 2015 UTC,"Well we don't know who sent the Pops back to protect Sarah, but its pretty safe to assume Skynet sent back the T1000 kill Sarah in 1973.  Based off all the previous movies, the T1000 couldn't locate Sarah, so it waited to ambush Kyle and most likely steal his appearence and bait Sarah in. Just like the T1000 tried with Sarah in T2 and the T800 did with Sarahs mom in T1.   The T1000 in 1984 is the same one that arrived in 1973 and killed her parents.  It was acid they used to kill the T1000.   Now what I've pieced together is Sarah lived North of LA near San Francisco. When Pops aquired Sarah, he brought her to LA and hid. Once Sarah was old enough and started asking the right questions, she and pops planned an ambush/rescue mission, and to take out Skynet in 1997. What they didn't know was they already altered time too much by destroying evidence of the Terminators which led to Skynet being created. Now Judgement Day is postponed to the year 2017. Sarah and Kyle jump forward to the year 2017.  The nexus in time Kyle witnessed was him crossing timelines, from the original timeline to the Genisys timeline. John also crossed timelines when he goes back to 2014.   ""We are just exiles of time."" If corrupt John had killed Sarah it wouldn't have killed corrupt John, it just would have prevented John from being born in this timeline.  In the sequels Sarah Conner is now the last best hope for mankind."

He blew up the house with a grenade or rocket launcher which we know from 2 that the 1000 will be delayed by but not killed by. So it's left open to imply that. It's a logical step to make.

Terminator,3cf788,ThatAnnoyingLad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"Im gonna write my two cents here, forgive my bad english.  Who sent who? what purpose does he/she/them/it tried to accomplish?    why was a T-1000 triying to kill young Sarah?   Besides what Sarah says about liquid metal around a boat, we never actually see a T-1000 in the past. Sarah was young, she was frightened and traumatized, did she actually saw a T-1000?.  We know explosives cant kill a T-1000, so a bazooka in pops hands would have been useless. Its hard to believe that they (pops and Sarah) have played hide and seek with a homicidal polymimetic-alloy badass killing machine for most than a decade successfully.  We know that Sarah's house was blown to shit, but, a T-1000 rarely uses weapons, and it never uses explosives on the 2nd film, but, if you look closely, who has a recently used RPG/bazooka on Sarah's flasback? Yep, thats right, its Arnie's lovely pops.  Kyle says pops would possibly have hidden event-triggered directives that even he could not possibly know that he has. Kyle was right. Pops its just a machine after all.   Why to kill Sarah's parents, then lie to her to think about something else?   Pops killed Sarah's parents, SKYNET want it that way. Skynet sent pops (thats why the information was deleted, obviously), and all other terminators in this movie. 1984's T-800 was just a plan B.   Why?   By eliminating Sarah's parents, skynet was setting a major master plot on rails. A toughen more capable future Sarah, plus a T-800 and a future soldier (Kyle Reese), those 3 were actually capable of doing something that Skynet tried to do so many times, in so many alternative timelines without success.  To delete SKYNET's default defeat constant: To delete the existence of John Fucking Connor   Who sent pops to ""protect"" young Sarah?   It was SKYNET itself.  In the end, Skynet won, it survived the attempt of being destroyed and it sucessfully wiped out of history the existence of John Connor.  Skynet's 2029 infector infiltrator was from another timeline (or maybe not), maybe it was a top secret prototype developed after all those other failed attempts to kill John Connor.  One less to go in Skynet's major conquest plan. Two left.  Or maybe I'm just a delusional idiot who got it all wrong. Who knows."
Terminator,3cf788,ThatAnnoyingLad,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:09:04 2015 UTC,Interesting theory.  So let's say Pops killed Sarah's parents on purpose to raise her to be the one that kills Skynet and not John because Pops knows John turns...?

Terminator,3cfeym,LayDownYourSoul,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:18:14 2015 UTC,"1) I assume it was some sort of acid that can eat metal.  The breathing of strong acids can be fatal which would explain the masks.  2)  I'd guess it was something to counteract acid.  I don't believe there is a known chemical that could act in that way.  Generally you want to flush acid off with large amounts of water - much more than just a spray bottle.  It could have been a strong base, but bases are very caustic and would be just as bad as acid.  You'd need the proportions to be exactly correct to counteract the acid and you couldn't do that with a spray bottle.  Pops was from the future and is very intelligent (built a time machine from scratch) so he may have a completely novel technique to disintegrate terminators  3)  Exactly what I was thinking during the movie"
Terminator,3cfeym,splat313,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:25:12 2015 UTC,"1)  It was acid.  that's why she used a sprayer to neutralize it when it dripped on her and Pops.  2)  It was a base, something you use to neutralize an acid.  Exactly which one, I couldn't tell you without knowing which acid they used.  3)  Well, it's a bit of a pull, but I'd say by his limbs. T-1000s do the shiny metal chrome look.

Terminator,3cevm0,Cleanatwork,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:00:46 2015 UTC,"Kyle Reese wasn't his original father. T1 starts in the third timeline.  Time line one:   Skynet is created. John Conner sends back a resistance fighter in 2029 to 1984 to protect his mom. This all happens naturally. The events of T1 have not happened. No T-800 in 1984. Time travel happens for the first time in this timeline as this is the origin timeline.  Time line two:  Kyle Reese arrives to 1984. Bangs mommy Conner. The child that is born is named John Conner based on the fact that Kyle told Sarah her son is named John. Kyle has no idea he is the father and dies before the end of the movie. Sarah takes the picture at the end of the movie and John ends up having it in 2029. This is a different John as Kyle is now his father. He looks different than the John from the first timeline but was raised by Sarah Conner to become the leader of the resistance. John gives Kyle the photo of Sarah from the end of T1 and sends him back to 1984.  Time line three: (Terminator movie we've all seen)  Kyle arrives to 1984 to protect Sarah Conner and has intimate knowledge of her based on the photo she took in the second time line. This photo could only exist if the events from T1 have already happened in the second timeline.  From here the time lines start to stack and are different each time, but you can still peel back the layers to see how things happened.  I don't know how to work in the new movie. Just because of the fact that Matt Smith fucked up shit in 2029 just after Kyle was sent back (this never happened before because Uncle Bob hasn't been sent to 94/95 yet). Matt Smith must have traveled from a distant future (not buying another dimension) to ensure Kyle was sent back in order to convert the existing John to a T-3000. However, that John Conner was now never born since Sarah and Kyle never banged and they jumped to 2017, a reality with no John Conner. Instead we have a JC T-3000 that traveled to a reality where he never existed and he actually creates the Matt Smith Skynet. It just doesn't make any sense to me. With the previous movies you can figure out easily how it all went down. But with T5, too much info has been left out to accurately sift through the timelines."
Terminator,3cevm0,maxisacatt,2,Tue Jul 7 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to get drawn into this too deeply.  What you're saying is, I think, correct for Terminator : Genisys and the intentions of the writers of that movie.  I agree that there's an additional timeline that makes sense of the photo of Sarah Connor.   (However, as a side-note...I don't think it's at all correct for The Terminator. I strongly believe Cameron intended an ontological paradox with one single timeline.  I appreciate that people don't like ontological paradoxes, but I don't think they're really any more problematic than alternate timelines)  But, never mind. We're talking about Genisys.   You mention ""Uncle Bob"" and I'm afraid he just doesn't exist in this continuity. T2 can't happen in this continuity (in any timeline). Each timeline has created a subsequent timeline...but there's no place for the events of T2.  So we have to disregard it completely (I know...it sucks).  Re: Matt Smith's character. I don't think he time travelled to Timeline C, 2029 - I think he belongs in that time.  I think Skynet, by this point, are aware that sending a Terminator to 1984 will simply result in John Connor sending back Kyle Reese after him.  So...they use that to their advantage.  The purpose of the 1984 T800 is not to terminate Sarah Connor...but to set a trap in 2029 so they can transform John Connor.  They know that he'll head to the time-displacement machine following the apparent end of the war (as he's done it in two earlier timelines) so it's the perfect place to spring a trap.  Kyle is then sent back to the Timeline D and, meanwhile, back in Timeline C, 2029, the badJohn sends back the T1000 to Timeline D,1973 to terminate Sarah Connor as a young girl.  The remaining resistance members subsequently send back a reprogrammed T800 to TimelineD, 1973 to protect her.  BadJohn then travels to TimelineD, 2014 to build Skynet/Genisys in the image of Matt Smith from TimelineC.   That's as far as I can get with it, in an attempt to explain who sent back the 1973 Terminators. What I don't understand is how Judgement Day is delayed by 20 years until 2017. There is no time travel (apparently) to between 1984-2014 in TimelineD so, with no external influence, it should revert back to the time it occurred in TimelineA."
Terminator,3cevm0,maxisacatt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:58:50 2015 UTC,"How could Skynet know about any of this? If the events of T1 and possibly T2 play out in a loop, how could Skynet know if they succeed or fail? It's not like a change in the timeline affects the existing future that they are in. For example, since John wasn't born in 84, he couldn't possibly still exist and go back in time to 2017, yet he does. Things don't dissappear from existence like in Back to the Future, so how could Skynet ever know?  Matt Smith boggles my mind. If he has always existed in in 2029, what caused him to attack John Conner this time? And you're right, by preventing the events in T1, the creation of Skynet should have reverted back to the original date in Timeline A this time with no John Conner.   I just realized something. Skynet achieved their goal. The elimination of John Conner. Once the core is recovered and Skynet gets back on track and launches, there will be no John Conner to lead the resistance. Maybe Sarah or Kyle will take his place."

Terminator,3cctnn,jonnythegamemaster,6,Mon Jul 6 22:50:17 2015 UTC,"No, John Connor is the T-3000. Skynet (Matt Smith) is the T-5000."
Terminator,3cdqm7,RaoulSeagull,2,Tue Jul 7 02:56:58 2015 UTC,"Wait, so technically every movie creates an alternate timeline, where each movie has Terminators sent back as a result of an alternate version Skynet reacting differently to the end of the War. (One version of Skynet has a T-800 try to kill Sarah, another version has a T-1000 try to kill a child John etc.)"
Terminator,3cdqm7,Danbito,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:30:06 2015 UTC,"That's how I always thought about it, and since some stuff like Judgement Day and the creation of Terminators that look like Arnold are pretty much inevitable unless something major happens like John or Sarah being assassinated, the alternate timelines end up being pretty similar. Maybe it's just I've got the wrong idea about how time travel works in these movies."
Terminator,3cdqm7,Cleanatwork,0,Tue Jul 7 11:26:42 2015 UTC,"Just did a post about this (""Making sense of Genisys"").  Basically the problem is you're trying to accommodate T2 and T3 into the story. They don't fit.    While the movie is about alternate timelines, the events of these movies simply didn't happen in any timeline within the reality of Genisys."
Terminator,3cdqm7,B-rizzle,-1,Tue Jul 7 11:07:30 2015 UTC,"Like everyone has been saying. It's some stupid alternate universe bullshit. You know, infinite time loops and struggles of man vs machine. Well they all came from out there."

Terminator,3cb7fc,RatchetHero1006,4,Mon Jul 6 15:31:01 2015 UTC,I would've like to see this kind of story come out in a television series. Just not enough time in the theater. This more or less is how Sarah Connor Chronicles played it but unfortunately was cancelled.
Terminator,3cb7fc,bradreputation,4,Mon Jul 6 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"Imagine if they took that nugget of an idea from the show and ran with it, that would be sick.  Dammit, i need sequels... now."
Terminator,3cb7fc,DarthTauri,2,Mon Jul 6 18:56:02 2015 UTC,"Right. When they jumped forward in time, they went to a point where they had many tasks and mission, and many years before Skynet.   Of course, it was a TV show format, so they needed many stories to fill the series."
Terminator,3cb7fc,StealthRabbi,6,Mon Jul 6 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"We don’t expect anybody to get it   Because we view the intended audience as morons.   you don’t really have to get this   Because we know you just want to see mindless gunfights and explosions.   If you want to nerd out, it’s all there, I think it’s coherent. But hopefully we can move on.   Because our primary demographic has never seen the first two films and this isn't your Dad's Terminator movies.   My favorite part is using humor to sort of skate over it   Because nothing is more hilarious than a machine incapable of remorse that kills people in front of their families.   Basically, that’s what we’re telling the audience: Go with it, we’re saving the world.   Because we spent 90% of the budget on Arnie, special effects, and marketing.  That didn't leave a whole lot left for decent writers.  Save the cheerleader Destroy Skynet, Save the World.   He’s not from this timeline. He’s from an alternate universe, in the multiverse. Another of the many universes that exist.   Because having multiple universes and timelines will ensure that the Terminator franchise goes on to make thirty more films.  We're going to Bond the hell out of this shit."
Terminator,3cb7fc,ConceptualTrap,2,Mon Jul 6 16:37:43 2015 UTC,So their explanation is the start was not the original time loop but another universe? Wtf  Here's my fucking question how did Skynet know to change it's strategy if they were stuck in a time loop?!  Timetraveling the multiverse is a shit answer.
Terminator,3cb7fc,Ambiguousdude,2,Mon Jul 6 21:16:15 2015 UTC,"Huh.  Interesting.  I'm going to be really sad if this project dies stillborn.  Bad enough TSCC ended on such an epic cliffhanger. I really want to know more about where this is all going, dammit."

Terminator,3cavgu,Foskowitz,3,Mon Jul 6 13:52:28 2015 UTC,"I like you prefer to avoid trailers for movies. At first when I saw John I was like ""Yay"" but then in a few seconds that turned into me saying to myself that it's too good to be true. And it was."
Terminator,3cavgu,BruteTartarus66,3,Tue Jul 7 01:08:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was the deliberate effect, ""Yes! John's here, we're saved!"" I think even Alan Taylor said that it wasn't intended to be revealed by the trailer like that."

Terminator,3campi,BruteTartarus66,4,Mon Jul 6 12:24:19 2015 UTC,"Just a small correction, T1000s can go back in the time machine because when in a human form they are essentially a human, the machines can grow skin for other terminators so Im sure the poly-mimetic alloy can fake it pretty well."

Terminator,3campi,Ambiguousdude,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:06:30 2015 UTC,I never said they grow skin but they can fake having skin... maybe it will be explained but since theres no guarantee of a sequel at this point I am not counting on it.
Terminator,3campi,StealthRabbi,3,Tue Jul 7 14:23:55 2015 UTC,One point my friend & I are constantly debating is how Skynet knew to change it's strategy if according to T1 & t2 they were stuck in a time loop.  I figured out if robot John creates Skynet & as a result in a sequel pops + T1000 are sent back to 1960s that would cause Reese to arrive in an altered timeline.  But how did it (Skynet) Know to change it's course of action. If anyone has an answer please.
Terminator,3campi,TriumphantGeorge,2,Mon Jul 6 15:08:43 2015 UTC,"Has no-one thought yet that John could be sent back through time at a later date so that he is the same age?   This is interesting, because in the opening monologue, Reese states that people believe John can predict the future. In the original films, John would have learned about the terminators and such, but I didn't get the impression that Reese told Sarah a huge amount of information about the war. Like, he didn't tell her about the Colorado unit succeeding, or other such details.  Perhaps John knew everything he did because he is the version of John from a timeline where he had the means of being told all the details of the war, which is how he knows everything. Again, that's a big stretch and something we won't know till later if a sequel is made."
Terminator,3campi,PC509,3,Mon Jul 6 17:21:13 2015 UTC,"Good work.   But I'd suggest that the fact the film needs so many ""coulds, maybes and my opinions"" to explain things away is half the problem. It just wasn't a very good screenplay, regardless of whether or not we approve of the ideas and the look of it.   Geez, they needed to keep SOMETHING for a sequel, although my bet is Connor (I do explain below). Dumbest of the many questions I've seen.   It's not a dumb question if this leads to something that would have been queried by a character ""in real life"" and it's not addressed. That's just bad writing.  The problem with these points isn't that people can't come up with an idea to explain them away, it's that the film itself doesn't seem to make internal sense.   A lot of the film's flaws come from it being already ""broken into a trilogy"" (director's own words). That's caused this film to be broken as a single movie. It's a series of event-type scenes which are good fun on their own, but don't really fit together very well.  TL;DR: The real question is: Did the writers have the answers to these questions? The film's structuring suggests not."
Terminator,3campi,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:07:22 2015 UTC,"I kind of like fan theories and the ""coulds, maybes and my opinions"", but there seems to be WAY TOO MUCH in the movie. You should leave some to the imagination, but not that much. I like that mystery of some movies about how or why. But, it shouldn't rely on that as a major reason."
Terminator,3campi,TriumphantGeorge,2,Mon Jul 6 21:32:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I think the mystery needs to be intentional - planned and decided upon and written - which doesn't seem to be the case here. They are ""gaps"" and ""inconsistencies"" rather than mysteries!"
Terminator,3campi,Niceguydan8,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:21:24 2015 UTC,"They need to leave some mystery for a sequel. I agree, my wording was too strong but nonetheless it seems obvious that if something wasn't addressed the writers have planned to tell us at a later date."
Terminator,3campi,flossdaily,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:55:31 2015 UTC,"I admire your confidence! But generally, it feels more like these are just gaps and inconsistencies in the writing, things unexplored. If it was a mystery, then it would be posed as a mystery during the film - a deliberate question that needs an answer and leaves you wondering and excited (otherwise it's a wasted mystery).  They might notice the problem and explain it away in the sequels, but I don't think it's an intentional plot thing. More likely, they'll just ignore it and cover it with action. The story has moved on and I can't see them going back to that part."
Terminator,3campi,LayDownYourSoul,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:28:53 2015 UTC,"I hate convoluted time travel in stories.  For what it was, I enjoyed T:G.  I hope from now on they keep the time travel fairly simple (a la the first two Terminator movies) and focus on Matt Smith's T-5000.  A lot of the questions I see people asking about don't really bother me much personally.  I don't need to know who sent Pops, or who went to kill the Connor family when Sarah was a kid.  I agree that a lot of the questions being asked are sequel material.  While I think the fairly thin plot is fair criticism, I also think people are being overly harsh on the movie too."
Terminator,3campi,CrazyDoode,2,Tue Jul 7 01:16:34 2015 UTC,I do think the story could have been improved by Reese and Sarah having sex at some point during the movie (to show that John Connor had been conceived) and by the two travelling to a week before Genisys launches rather than a day and a bit. The rest is all pretty perfect but if they had incorporated these two changes of mine it would have been a 10/10 for me rather than a 9/10.
Terminator,3campi,StealthRabbi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:21:37 2015 UTC,"Your Q&A is fine and all... but you're missing the point of why it was a shit movie:  Jumping FORWARD in time from 1984 was beyond idiotic.  Instead of spending decades preparing and STRIKING at everything related to Cyberdyne and skynet, they jumped to the moment when Skynet was hardest to kill.  The whole movie centered on this idiotic premise."
Terminator,3campi,jimmyolsenblues,3,Mon Jul 6 16:00:24 2015 UTC,Terminator 1 sucked because they sent Kyle Reece back to the same day that the terminator was sent back to kill Sarah.  They could have sent him back years earlier to train her and help protect her better!    Terminator 2 sucked because they sent the T-800 back to the same day that the T-1000 was sent when they could have sent him back years earlier to train him and help protect him better!  These plot holes exist in every movie. Gotta have some imagination.
Terminator,3campi,crocshark,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:53:56 2015 UTC,These plot holes exist in every movie. Gotta have some imagination. This is exactly what Chris Bale got wrong. What if these (plus many many other details) are not plot holes but simply history repeating itself?
Terminator,3campi,EVula,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"Skynet was not hardest to kill at that point, at least, they didn't think this. The plan would have went perfect had John not been involved. Pops planned for everything except John Conner intervening (although couldn't he have known about his presence before the moment that Sarah and Kyle arrived? After all, Pops worked at Cyberdyne!)."
Terminator,3campi,flossdaily,2,Mon Jul 6 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Also a fair point, although Pops (I would assume) had worked to build the building long before John was there in 2014. When he says he was laid off, odds are that this was during the financial crisis somewhere between 2008 and 2012, before John arrived."
Terminator,3campi,ConceptualTrap,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:58:06 2015 UTC,I agree and the jump was because Kyle reese tells himself to remember in an alternate timeline.  This isn't science fiction.
Terminator,3campi,MaIakai,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:06:26 2015 UTC,"While I agree jumping forward in time a day before it comes online is stupid, just waiting over 30 years would also have been a bad idea. In this alternate timeline, all they knew (from Reese) was genisys was the new skynet and that it started in 2017 (Pops and Sarah still thought 1997 was judgment day). So not knowing any details their waiting plan would have consisted of probably over 20 years of waiting and aging, to the point where they'd be much older and have a harder time accomplishing the task at hand. So, to me at least, time jumping while Pops was planning was a good idea. Time jumping to a moment so close to judgement day was the real logical flaw."
Terminator,3campi,jimmyolsenblues,0,Tue Jul 7 00:46:02 2015 UTC,"They had a single bit of information to work with: ""Genisys is Skynet."" How exactly were they supposed to extrapolate from there what they needed to do to undermine Skynet? This wasn't like T2 where they knew who was ultimately responsible and take action against them. They didn't know that Cyberdyne had anything to do with Genisys (hell, when they got to 2017, they didn't even know what Genisys was), so why would they have been striking out at them?"
Terminator,3cajxn,RemnantHelmet,3,Mon Jul 6 11:52:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I hope they don't make the post-war setting the main (or at least not the only) focus of any future films because that's not really what Terminator movies are about in my opinion.  Terminator Salvation only got by with it because the machines were targeting Kyle Reese before he went back, so there's still that element of protecting the timeline there.  As far as I'm concerned, having a Terminator movie without time travel would be like having a Nightmare on Elm Street movie where no one sleeps."
Terminator,3cajxn,IAmManMan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:44:06 2015 UTC,Not entirely sure. I would like to see the third movie do this but the second should definitely be set pre war as well.

Terminator,3c93ff,StealthRabbi,4,Mon Jul 6 03:20:24 2015 UTC,"The one in salvation was actually brutal. If we ignore the stupidity in it tossing him around, and just look at the damage it did to Connor, you'll notice that he got a fair few broken bones from relatively effortless throws.  The T-800 models are extremely strong and durable. Small arms fire basically does nothing if it doesn't jam up a servo (like the buckshot it got stuck in it's wrist in T1).  I'm actually having trouble thinking of a strength feat we could use to guess how strong it is. But plenty strong enough to grab a guy by the neck and snap it like a twig.  The one thing that holds the T-800 back is it's speed. Tho when you are a tireless beast, you don't need to be able to run fast.  If we consider deadliness on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being as threatening as a spaniel puppy, and 10 being face to face with a minigun while tied to a chair.  I'd say a T-800 is at least a 7 or 8. for reference a T-600 would be about 6-7, and a t-1000 that doesnt fuck around 8-9"
Terminator,3c93ff,sephtis,2,Mon Jul 6 05:57:29 2015 UTC,"Slugs, not buck shot are used in T1. You can see examples of the slugs when windows are shot. The T-600s are made from the best modern day materials where as T-800s are made from future materials giving them near frictionless joints."

Terminator,3c7jz9,saludictoriancoach,4,Mon Jul 6 03:43:10 2015 UTC,I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand Genisys kinda works as a standalone film and I don't think it needs a sequel. On the other hand this movie is better than Salvation and T3 which made way more money than Genisys so I want it to do well in that regard.
Terminator,3c7jz9,ConceptualTrap,2,Mon Jul 6 01:42:45 2015 UTC,"On the other hand this movie is better than Salvation and T3   That is entirely subjective, obviously.  Salvation doesn't feel like a Terminator film to me.  T3 has the right sentiment and some great sequences but was ultimately killed by trying to toss in some stupid jokes throughout.  That said, despite the stripper glasses and the repetetive ""She'll be back,"" and ""I'm back,"" I still think T3 was a better film than Salvation or Genisys.  Ultimately, the biggest issue I had with Genisys is that it really lacked any sort of heart.  That coupled with a generally stupid and complicated plotline and the movie really just felt like it went through the motions.  A lot of people shit on T3 for bringing fate back into the equation.  They never quite take into account that T2 itself retconned the quote in T1.  The idea that judgment day is inevitable, despite what they think in T2, is a notion that's been carried through all the movies since.  The very idea that T3 isn't about ""winning"" and merely about ""surviving"" is one of the strongest conclusions that the trilogy has had."
Terminator,3c7jz9,saludictoriancoach,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:35:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you.  T3 goes against the entire premise of the first two films, no fate for what we make. This makes T3 illogical because the universe is set up in a way that you can change the future. In T2 Cameron had a deleted scene where Judgement Day never happened, and it was always his intention that the first two films were the final films in the series."
Terminator,3c7jz9,ConceptualTrap,2,Mon Jul 6 15:04:32 2015 UTC,"In T2 Cameron had a deleted scene where Judgement Day never happened, and it was always his intention that the first two films were the final films in the series.

""No fate but what we make for ourselves,"" is simply a cozy thought for humanity when you consider that the entire existence of John Connor and Skynet itself is based on a circular logic that's inescapable.  Without Skynet, no John Connor.  Without John Connor, no Skynet.  They exist within a time loop, at least until Genisys happened.  You can push back the dates, as we saw with T2, but at some point John Connor is going to have to send Kyle Reese back in time in order for himself to be born.  If anything, Genisys was the first movie that really took the time travel rules of the films and just threw them out the window.  Not only does it make it so the events of Terminator 1-3 never transpire, it entirely retcons the idea that time travel to the future is even possible.  I mean, if you can travel to the future, how is that Skynet doesn't know every major tactical action that Connor makes before he does it?"
Terminator,3c7jz9,bradreputation,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:53:18 2015 UTC,T3 had more heart than Genisys. The plot was just too complicated to give a damn about any of the characters. We are so far removed from T2 that k can't rely on nostalgia for the first two film's versions of characters to get me through bad story.
Terminator,3c7jz9,StealthRabbi,3,Tue Jul 7 02:03:22 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it's not the end. Salvation failed to start a new series, and the SCC show didn't last long. If this one doesn't start the engines, then it may be hard to see a new sequel.   I really hope there's enough though.   I had a feeling it wouldn't do well by the fact that this sub doesn't have much activity."
Terminator,3c7jz9,StealthRabbi,4,Sun Jul 5 20:04:55 2015 UTC,I don't think the franchise is done but my hunch is the next one will be a TOTAL reboot.

Terminator,3c7jz9,Falcoooooo,4,Mon Jul 6 12:32:41 2015 UTC,"They had a chance, a real chance, to reinvigorate this thing & they tried to do way way way too much with time travel & multiple universes & plot twists. The beauty of the first 2 movies were the simplicity. I was hoping they'd go back to this simplicity with a creative reboot like X-Men Days of Future Past or Star Trek 2009. Instead they wrote themselves into a corner with too many plot holes & twists.  Personally, I'm glad to see this fail in the hope we'd get something more dedicated & serious. But it breaks my heart that they ruined the one chance they had at incorporating Arnold into them. I don't see any way they can continue without doing a flat out remake."
Terminator,3c7jz9,SiriusC,2,Sun Jul 5 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"If this fails, it'll probably be the last in the franchise, or at least the last for a very, very long time. James Cameron gets the rights back in a few years, and he has no interest in making another film, and may not want to sell them. We might need to wait until he dies for another film, which hopefully will be a very long time..."

I loved the part where the guardian and Kyle are loading rounds into the magazines while Sarah was listening to music. Testing each other to see who could load rounds more quickly. The whole movie was a joy to watch.
Terminator,3c552n,cumonshoes,4,Sat Jul 4 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed it (especially in 3D), but the movie was spoiled by the trailers, and I think that's going to play a big factor on why it probably won't sell enough tickets to warrant a sequel...which is a shame. My only gripe with the movie was that Emilia looks too young to play a believable Sarah Connor. Jai Courtney is also kind of bland, but it's not a deal breaker. I'm okay with John Connor being a villain, but those spoilers just ruined the whole thing. If they would've kept that a secret they would have higher ticket sales in the long run as the internet would go nuts about it and would basically create a very cool watercooler moment. Really interested to see where the series goes from here. I hope there's more, but remember, when they filmed the TS movie they originally had a 3 movie-deal....look what happened with that."

Terminator,3c552n,sneakyfilthnuts,3,Sun Jul 5 02:18:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't like it at all because it felt like it was attempting to rehash past events of the series instead of actually moving the story forward and standing on its own legs.  On top of the actors all being completely miscast, save for Arnie who just seemed happy to be there.  It was a completely unnecessary entry in the series and I think the franchise is weakened even further by its existence."
Terminator,3c552n,MyCatsBetter,2,Sat Jul 4 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly! At least Salvation tried to move it forward to the war.

Terminator,3c63i5,ConceptualTrap,2,Mon Jul 6 16:49:12 2015 UTC,"Not quite.   The timeline of Genesys is rooted in T1 (but not T2 due to the destruction of Skynet in that movie).

Terminator,3c1u2s,Xxttggxx,3,Fri Jul 3 23:54:10 2015 UTC,I honestly have no idea why the T-1000 pops would change his appearance to John Connor... My only question is how does the mimetic polyalloy work with Pops' endoskeleton and how much of the endo remains?
Terminator,3c1u2s,bhfroh,3,Sat Jul 4 03:57:24 2015 UTC,"They stated in the movie that all the polyalloy was missing was a CPU, so I would assume that's all that went into the upgraded Pops. Both his arms are blades when he opens the safe room door, he's somewhat de-aged again, etc."
Terminator,3c1u2s,Ryllandaras,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:00:55 2015 UTC,"I don't recall it being both arms, simply because he only used one hook, a la Robert Patrick's T1000, to open the door. I did notice the lack of aging which tells me that he's got at least an arm plus skin as polyalloy."
Terminator,3c1u2s,bhfroh,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think they would change Arnie as a 800 in form as he is what makes the film, I think it's likely just his arm that got chopped off might be able to be used in that way. I think it's a bit stupid, because I liked like the t800 being bale to take on the newer 1000 etc"
Terminator,3c1u2s,humdrumoflife,-5,Sat Jul 4 23:04:26 2015 UTC,It makes no sense like most of the movie. It's a waste of brain power trying to figure it out.
Terminator,3c1u2s,bradreputation,4,Sat Jul 4 21:11:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's silly that you're hating on the movie so much... Trying to compare this movie to a couple of masterpieces is the real joke. I thought the movie was great! Sure, it's not as good as T1 and T2, but it's far and away better than T3 and TS."
Terminator,3c1u2s,bhfroh,-2,Sat Jul 4 21:42:26 2015 UTC,I enjoyed a lot of the movie but I don't think it's fair to give moviemakers a pass because we love the franchise. They wanted it to be a surprise that pops wasn't dead but everyone saw it coming a mile away. Why not show a scene of the genesys computer running a repair program or something. Would've been very quick and easy to do.
Terminator,3c1u2s,bradreputation,2,Sat Jul 4 21:52:46 2015 UTC,"This terminator is for a whole new generation of movie goers. It's not going to be the same as the older movies. So expect a lot of stuff that doesn't quite gel.   I think the thing to remember is that the older you get, the more discriminating you're going to get. When you're young and seeing a movie like this for the first time, you're going to let a lot of things slide. Just like music or fashion, your likes and dislikes are going to be different."
Terminator,3c27qv,PranksterPinkie,7,Sat Jul 4 02:05:58 2015 UTC,"Skynet is always doing last ditch efforts though. They had no choice but to try. Remember, Skynet was just defeated, and corrupting John was done by a Skynet entity from another time line which was an exile / immune.   Not sure how they are stronger now, however."
Terminator,3c27qv,StealthRabbi,2,Sat Jul 4 03:47:23 2015 UTC,"This kind of reminds me of the TV show sliders. In the show, the bad guys known as the Kromaggs would travel to parallel dimensions and take over each planet. And by each planet i mean Earth since it was a different dimension. It seems thats what the T 5000 / Skynet is doing. From what I gather, the universe that the t5000 is from, that Skynet won a decisive victory and its technology is beyond that we have ever seen or thought of. It may have started to explore other dimensions and is trying to correct the ones that it can save in order to prevent human victory to allow its other versions to rule."
Terminator,3c27qv,Mirai182,5,Tue Jul 7 12:07:57 2015 UTC,"According to an interview with the writers, the T-5000 is Skynet from multiple timelines worth of time-travel, and he saw infecting John as having a high risk of success.  So it wasn't stupid or desperate, it was working."
Terminator,3c27qv,Flynn58,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:43:37 2015 UTC,Does that mean there is probably a chance that Cyber-Connor ended up backfiring in one timeline?
Terminator,3c27qv,Flynn58,2,Sat Jul 4 11:46:11 2015 UTC,"No, that was the first timeline Skynet did it in.  It isn't an infinitely branching multiverse, it's Skynet going back repeatedly because it keeps fucking up."
Terminator,3c27qv,Victorboris1,2,Sat Jul 4 12:01:01 2015 UTC,Skynet is desperate. It knows the Colorado Offensive is going to work. In the future the humans always win.
Terminator,3c27qv,DurdensWrath,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:39:10 2015 UTC,"My question, with Genysis... why would Skynet even need to wipe out the humans?  It would pretty much have control, and could play the long game instead."
Terminator,3c1xls,PranksterPinkie,10,Sat Jul 4 00:27:17 2015 UTC,"Guys this is obviously a way for Arnold to give up the role down the line, he can now be anyone at all.  John Connor even. So Arnold can give it up but he will always be pops."
Terminator,3c1xls,Xxttggxx,8,Sat Jul 4 02:54:35 2015 UTC,"I replied to a comment on the bottom, but I'll paste it here as well:  The T-1000s don't have CPUs like the T-800s. I think maybe they're re-writing some of the lore in Genisys, but in the other movies, once T-1000s were created, they became independent, free thinking beings.   At the end of the TV series John asks one of the T-1000s to join the resistance, and after consideration it refuses. There was also a T-1000(Maybe the same one, can't remember) who traveled back in time and was trying to prevent judgement day.   I belive it's possible for a T-1000 to be a good guy. The one in the TV series kind of was. The biggest thing here is their free will. They can decide to do whatever they want, so it's not out of the realm of possibility."
Terminator,3c1xls,I_wish_I_was_a_robot,3,Sat Jul 4 06:45:44 2015 UTC,T-1000s are definitely independent. TSCC and TS confirm this. I really want a future Skynet civil war movie.
Terminator,3c1xls,NihlusKryik,2,Sat Jul 4 06:56:05 2015 UTC,was there a t1000 in salvation?
Terminator,3c1xls,panopticonisi,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:13:41 2015 UTC,Was it mentioned in TS? I don't remember that part.
Terminator,3c1xls,I_wish_I_was_a_robot,2,Sat Jul 4 07:22:21 2015 UTC,Now im confused. I think I may be mixing up a scene from the future in TSCC with T:S
Terminator,3c1xls,NihlusKryik,3,Sat Jul 4 07:34:00 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think you are. There were scenes in TSCC where they were on a sub with the T1000"
Terminator,3c1xls,I_wish_I_was_a_robot,3,Sat Jul 4 07:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my brain is dumb. Because there was a sub in the movie and the show somehow some memories got scrambled!  Time to rewatch the show though... so good."
Terminator,3c1xls,NihlusKryik,5,Sat Jul 4 08:39:45 2015 UTC,Have you seen Genisys?
Terminator,3c1xls,StealthRabbi,4,Sat Jul 4 00:36:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, I hope they don't write it out in the sequel."
Terminator,3c1xls,reece1495,2,Sat Jul 4 00:52:57 2015 UTC,I hope just the one arm is liquid metal and the skin but he still has the t-800 endoskelton under it
Terminator,3c1xls,zoojoo,3,Sat Jul 4 01:10:41 2015 UTC,Unless I'm mistaken it was a complete change. When he fell in the liquid I thought he was missing both legs and an arm. They hunted at the cpu being the part they need for t those things do function. So his cpu was used to activate a new terminator. Which is what we saw at the end .
Terminator,3c1xls,StealthRabbi,8,Sat Jul 4 02:15:25 2015 UTC,"You are correct. I'm not sure why this is so hard for some to understand. It's clearly explained that the mimetic poly alloy we see in the lab are lifeless experiments that can't hold form or function without a cpu. We see Pops fall in to the liquid, defeated. His chip is engulfed by the alloy, and then take form, controlled by the Pops CPU.   We see him have 2 liquid arms, not just his 1 missing arm.   So we have a T1000 Pops, T1000 body, with the Pops cpu. Its default state is presumably the old pops appearance since that's how he identifies."
Terminator,3c1xls,I_wish_I_was_a_robot,6,Sat Jul 4 03:38:47 2015 UTC,"The T-1000s don't have CPUs like the T-800s though. I think maybe they're re-writing some of the lore in Genisys, but in the other movies, once T-1000s were created, they became independent, free thinking beings.   At the end of the TV series John asks one of the T-1000s to join the resistance, and after consideration it refuses. There was also a T-1000(Maybe the same one, can't remember) who traveled back in time and was trying to prevent judgement day.   Also I think Pops became something similar to the T-X in Terminator 3, part liquid metal with an endoskeleton beneath it."
Terminator,3c1xls,Ryllandaras,2,Sat Jul 4 06:40:18 2015 UTC,"T-1000 body with a T-800 CPU is how I see it. In the movie, they showed T-1000 alloy interfacing with T-800 circuitry in the 1984 scenes."
Terminator,3c1xls,panopticonisi,2,Sun Jul 5 18:41:44 2015 UTC,I agree on all parts.   on a t1000 where would a CPU even go? the throwaway line about poly mimetic alloy needing a CPU was a terrible attempt to salvage a crappy plot where writers painted themselves into a corner.  the t:scc portrayal of t1000s was awesome.
Terminator,3c1xls,I_wish_I_was_a_robot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:12:54 2015 UTC,"It gets a little confusing. They never said who sent back Pops or the T-1000 in T:G. At the time Kyle was sent back they didn't have the technology for making the T-1000s or they'd have sent one back instead of the T-800. At the same time, the being that was skynet who attacked John as Kyle was going back in time was way more advanced than the T-1000.  I'm assuming the humans trying to develop the mimetic poly alloy couldn't figure out how to incorporate a CPU right in the alloy, which Skynet does in the future. Maybe they were going to encorporate a endoskeleton similar to the T-X. I do understand it was mentioned to bring Pops back, I'm just trying to justify it.   It's kind of interesting exploring Skynet's motivation, or exploring why Pops seems to have developed emotions.  The T-1000, however, are way more interesting to me. I hope the next movie introduces a complex T-1000 character. The one in T:G was pretty 1 dimensional. The one in T2:JD was interesting as hell. Very minor things, like him stopping and looking at the mannequin, or telling the helicopter pilot to get out instead of killing him and throwing him out, or looking at his blade hand after killing John's foster father. Just shit he didn't have to do but implies there's a lot going on in his mind."
Terminator,3c1xls,panopticonisi,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:40:38 2015 UTC,"as long as we are talking t2's t1000, have you seen the deleted scenes of his malfunctions and the dog/John's room scene? both make it a very interesting character."
Terminator,3c1xls,I_wish_I_was_a_robot,2,Sat Jul 4 07:47:29 2015 UTC,"The malfunctions, yes. I own the directors cut blu ray. I sort of remember the dog part, does he go outside and kill it? If I'm remembering correctly then yea. He didn't need to do that at all."
Terminator,3c1xls,newfoundslander,0,Sat Jul 4 07:51:31 2015 UTC,"There was a lot of corner painting and cringey dialogue/exposition in this movie.   Sadly, because a lot of it could have been avoided with a better script.  The scene where they explain Kyle's alternate timeline memories was at least 2-3 minutes too long and could have been sufficiently dealt with by a throwaway line or two, or avoiding the need to have a 'genisys' system to begin with.  I'm already watching a movie about robots from the future - Disbelief has been suspended.   It's like the writers decided 'There has to be a genisys in 2017, so now we have to introduce a convoluted story about recovered memories to make them travel to 2017'. Why not just go with 1997 and simplify the story? Do we NEED to go to 2017 to make the story enjoyable?  There was also a lot of dialogue that interrupted the story just to cover potential future plot holes. Arnold's line about buckling up to sarah was made solely so they could do an explosive CGI scene with the bus without us going 'how are they still alive?'. Why not just show her buckling up? It was also a bad way to shoehorn in likability for Pops - 'aw look, he cares about her!'.  Also, Sarah's line to the effect of 'don't think I'm in love with you just because I held you when we were naked' was totally out of place and an awkward attempt for the writers to show sexual tension. The audience shouldn't be hit over the head with blunt exposition showing two characters falling in love or feeling mutual attraction. With good writing, the characters should be able to show this with just a look.  The scenes where Sarah talked about mating were a welcome bit of levity, and made me laugh. But overall, the writers just tried to hard to explain things when they could have just let them happen and let our minds fill in the gaps as to the 'how'."

Terminator,3c0pgy,davebgray,7,Fri Jul 3 18:25:38 2015 UTC,"i like to think that in every movie,they alter the world a little.with the butterfly rule in effect,thats why john always looks different. the sperm that would have been ""ed furlong"" john never fertilized sarahs ""ed furlong egg"" so for instance the john from the new movie and Christian bale look like that because of slightly different factors from time of conception to growing up in slightly different ways each time."

Terminator,3c0pgy,Porkkanakakku,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, though I must say that those facial scars were a bit too much and looked a tad unrealistic;I unfortunately have seen enough of them throughout my life."
Terminator,3c0pgy,Paligor,3,Sat Jul 4 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"I've also seen my fair share of scars, so I can understand your point. But at the same time... I dunno, they worked for me. If you consider the time and place, they probably didn't have the best medical care available. And wounds that weren't immediately life threatening might also have been ignored in favor of more important things.  Also, the scar design was clearly based on the way they looked in the first movie, so they didn't really have carte blanche."
Terminator,3c0pgy,Porkkanakakku,2,Sat Jul 4 17:00:34 2015 UTC,".You have a point there, though the scars I've seen on John Connor's face in Terminator 2: Judgement Day looked more realistic, but that might be only because he was in one scene occuring during night."

Terminator,3c0pgy,SiriusC,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:49:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and it's sadly due to poorly written dialogue. He's a fine actor."
Terminator,3c0pgy,newfoundslander,8,Sat Jul 4 16:35:45 2015 UTC,"They wanted him for Terminator 3, but they didn't want to deal with his drug problems potentially affecting production, so they passed on him. Instead we got Nick Stahl's terrible portrayal of John Connor as a whiny bitch."
Terminator,3c0pgy,phillymjs,5,Fri Jul 3 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know I didn't mind him as John Connor. I mean, he was whiny, but he had a huge responsibility and his mom/mentor/only supporter was long gone. He didn't have any real direction at that point and was rightfully lost and whiny. The judgement day we see at the end of that film is where he truly realized his purpose and gained the confidence required of him. Until that point I can understand his angst."
Terminator,3c0pgy,Wdwdash,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:15:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, totally this. People hate on T3 but I love it, personally. The beginning intro where John is describing the feeling of the weight of the world bearing down on him really sets the whole tone of the movie. I also find his portrayal of John to be the most relatable out of all of the others."

Terminator,3c0xpc,scudwolf,2,Fri Jul 3 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"A good place to start would be the Dark Horse Omnibus collections. I think those are about the best Terminator comics you can get. They contain almost all the Dark Horse Terminator stories and are all pretty great.  There was a run (I think 1988/9 but could be wrong) of NOW Comics that are kind of interesting but not that great. These came out before T2 so it's all based on the information in the first film, and mostly focus on the original future war. Weirdly, they're mostly set in Florida. The last couple of stories from the NOW Comics universe are pretty good though, All My Future's Past and The Burning Earth.  Robocop Vs. Terminator plus Kill Human are very good.  There are some companion comics to Rise of the Machines and Salvation but I don't really rate these, but there are some interesting things in there.  There's a series that's a direct continuation of T2, Cybernetic Dawn/Nuclear Twilight which is good.  Also some recent-ish ones Infinity and Revolution that deal more with the future war. The art isn't great compared to some of the better series but again, interesting story of future John that's worth a look.  Lots of the comics are worth checking out. They do a good job of expanding the Terminator universe and a good portion of them stay true to the films' tone."

And the movie clearly left things open for further sequel explanations. There's bound to be some confusion. Most of these answers I knew just by watching once.   However, the explanation about the 1973 T1000 is important to read. I assumed he died, and the T1000 in 1984 was a new one. How did Sarah stay off the grid for 11 years and never manage to knock out the T1000? I guess they all knee they'd converge in 1984. Guess I thought the T1000 would be a little better given 11 years.   The one about John straggling to build a time machine was a little loose. Didn't John get corrupted by a machine that time traveled, or otherwise was form an Era that knew time travel? That was never brought up in dialog, and could have been."

Terminator,3bzbki,splat313,2,Fri Jul 3 13:05:30 2015 UTC,I believe that was largely because the Halcyon company that owned the rights went bankrupt.  Salvation made a bunch of money so I bet they would have made more if they didn't go bust.  Arnold has definitely said he'll be in the 6th one so I think the prospects are a little more promising.

They are perhaps best known for acquiring the global rights to the Terminator franchise in 2007 and for producing Terminator Salvation, which was released worldwide in the summer of 2009. Despite making a healthy profit on the movie, Halcyon filed for bankruptcy in 2009 as a response to a lawsuit from their financier due to payment problems.

Terminator,3c0g9a,truechange,8,Fri Jul 3 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"This is the best Terminator movie since Judgement Day, however the third and fourth ""sequels"" did really lower the bar almost to the floor.  Emilia Clarke plays a very good Sarah Connor, at certain points, looking at her in those same shadows that surrounded the original actress, its hard to tell the difference.  Her interplay with Arnold works very well in the film, in fact, whenever anyone was hanging out with the model one-oh-one i was reminded, in the best possible ways,  of T2: Judgement day. In its best moments this film emulates and plays homage to James Cameron's movies. They effectively recaptured and replicated -- flawlessly -- the 1980's feel of the first film, even cloning many of the scenes and camera angles to boot.  It doesn't feel like these segments are stolen or ripped off from the other movies, they are just used to tell the story in a similar and respectful manner, through quirky details, as Cameron would have.  This film is many times more a Terminator movie than the third and fourth films ever hoped to be. James Cameron was at first an excellent writer, and the writers of this film could never hope to trump the original plot, but one can tell that they put a lot of heart in the story.  The Terminator was a really cool idea before it was Holly Wood icon, and Genesis keeps that idea close to the front lines. In the grand tradition of Cameron's creative spirit they made, as he had done, a cool sequel to a cool movie.  It is less like the step from The Terminator to T2 and instead more like Cameron's own sequel Aliens. He was trying to build off of Ridley Scott's vision of the Alien and in Genesis the writers are making a similar step in building on Cameron's wildly interesting ideas in T1 and T2. While the pacing and action sequences borrow heavily from Judgement Day, they do it in an honest manner, unlike the second Underworld movie which seemed more like they ran out of ideas for their Werewolf/Vampire movie and just copied action sequences from Cameron instead. What seemed lacking, though tolerable, was the majority of the 'cast'. Matt Smith and Old John Conner could have been combined conceptually and molded into a much fuller character, eliminating the need for two more A-list actors trying to fight for screen time.  There was no prominent child character to help ground the needed exposition like Furlong in T2. Instead the role of the new guy on the scene was taken by Kyle Reese's character. In contrast to Clarke's Sarah, that dude didn't seem to add anything to the film that someone who looked a hell of a lot more like Michael Biehn could have. The third act of the film, which focuses quite a bit on Conner and the eleventh doctor was probably the weakest section, but still very watchable for fans of the originals. Arnold's 'character transformation' in the end was fairly interesting, but it left quite a plot hole. I hope I don't spoil anything by saying ""There is one more chip."" This is not a bad film, and it is considerably better than most of the attempted reboots in this franchise and many others. It was well written and has a good sense of humor - - the director and producers knew what they were trying to do, and accomplished it. Their aim wasn't only to make a summer blockbuster, they also wanted to show and remind you how much they loved the original films. Their instinct to erase the last two films from the story was well founded and this movie serves as an appropriate third entry in the saga."
Terminator,3c0g9a,Zachno,2,Fri Jul 3 19:32:39 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat.  Don't know if I liked it or not.  It was good and bad.  First half was good, second was wtf?  The human characters were lacking."
Terminator,3c0g9a,Fsoprokon,3,Fri Jul 3 18:34:04 2015 UTC,"If you are expecting this film to be like xmen days of future past, where it respects continuity but creates an alternative timeline, you will be pissed off. This film, from the get go, ignores terminator 2-4. They never happened. This film is a hideous attempt at a reboot for the franchise. It's so bad that I'm shocked it ever got greenlit. SHOCKED. If you wanted any sort of basic adherence to established Canon you will be completely let down. It was apparently easier for the writers to just throw everything out the window and attempt a hard reset.  I can't emphasize this enough. This is NOT a star trek style reboot where the other films still happened. It's a lazy, thoughtless, shameless attempt at hijacking a established franchise.  All that aside, the film, is incoherent. They established several new rules for time travel which lead to large plot holes that are never resolved, and the acting between the two leads is atrocious in certain scenes. I mean, f**king horrible. It's the worst portrayal of Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner I've ever seen. Like, straight out of my nightmares.  And the guy who plays John Conner looks like a Damn goblin. He's just ugly and totally miscast.  I guess I'm gonna end this by saying, remember how we all thought avp was the worst that could happen to the alien series? Then avpr came out and showed us what rock bottom really looked like?  That's what this film does to the terminator franchise. It makes salvation look like judgement day.   I should mention that, yes, the movie has some good action sequences.  Most of these occur at the beginning and involve the war in the future.  Why they didn't continue this franchise where Salvation left off so they could show us more of the war against the machines will remain one of the biggest f**k ups in film writing history. I can Almost guarantee that if you watch this film you will have a STRONG urge to walk out before the midway point.  It really is that bad.  Arnold is, of course, good in this film but he cant save it.  Honestly if you care about this series, if you enjoyed the sequels, or even if you just want the integrity of the franchise to be maintained, then this film will break your heart."
Terminator,3c0g9a,chumblespuz3000,5,Fri Jul 3 17:54:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think that T2 didn't happen at the start. We see John has the knowledge from Sarah.   Yes, there are new time travel elements. If they didn't invent new concepts of time travel, then you'd end up with a movie like T3 which wasn't innovative and plagued by being too much like 2.  The new star trek movies are in an alternate time line. The same can be said about the Terminator sequels and Sarah Connor Chronicles."

Data aging makes no sense in the fiction (but obviously Spiner's an actor).  Terminators are cyborgs. Arnold's aging makes sense just fine within the fiction (although they probably should have CGI'd Arnold to his T2 look for his 1984 scenes).
Terminator,3byqz2,JackSpadesSI,6,Fri Jul 3 07:13:56 2015 UTC,he is talking about the actor aging. Just like with arnold and having to use cgi for a younger arnold.

Terminator,3bu6og,TheDalekCaan,6,Thu Jul 2 14:49:45 2015 UTC,...because they changed the punks around a bit or some shit? Really? You know they can't straight lift the scenes from T1 or 2 as Orion owns those right?  I thought they did an amazing job with what they had to work with.
Terminator,3bu6og,s4in7,3,Thu Jul 2 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"Because both main actors can't hold a handle to their old respective counterparts. Linda Hamilton was average in T1, but she kicked ass in T2. Michael Biehn was phenomenal in T1 and the guy who replaced him, well, sucks."
Terminator,3bu6og,TheDalekCaan,3,Thu Jul 2 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"That's the nature of the game when you make a sequel 30 years after the fact. Of course they'll never recreate Linda or Michael's performances, but holding on to that is only a disservice to your enjoyment of the new movie."
Terminator,3bu6og,s4in7,6,Thu Jul 2 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"I never expected to see Hamilton/Biehn recreated. I did want to see fine actors busy nailing their parts. Khaleesi had no idea how to handle her part. Dude who plays Reese? Never seen such a black hole of charisma. In a movie about time travelling killer robots, the  idea of  this dude getting laid is the one hardest to buy.   I really liked actor of  John Connor though, great performance really.  That said, is a  Shame nobody calls Furlong anymore. Would have been very touching to see him and Arnold together.      Arnold was perfect ofc."
Terminator,3bu6og,Kal_Vas_Flam,4,Thu Jul 2 20:54:37 2015 UTC,"See, I think Khaleesi did fantastic playing a brash 19 year old girl with an over-protective father figure. Trying to compare Genisys Sarah to T1 or T2 Sarah is completely stupid because it's a COMPLETELY different person. Further, Reese had no shot at getting laid on his own in T1 either. It took an overly vulnerable Sarah Connor to pity Reese into getting laid."
Terminator,3bu6og,bhfroh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:34:29 2015 UTC,Imagine how awesome it would be if Furlong didn't suck and he was in Genisys.
Terminator,3bu6og,Deakul,2,Fri Jul 3 21:30:26 2015 UTC,"This movie relied far too much on trying to recreate past films, it never did anything much to stand on its own legs.  I hate to say it but I'd call it worse than Terminator 3 but better than Salvation."

Terminator,3butn1,KennyLoginz,7,Thu Jul 2 09:36:14 2015 UTC,"I was disappointed.  It was OK, but I felt like they missed a massive opportunity.  Some stuff that pissed me off:   Why did ""killing"" John Connor at a point after Kyle is jumping alter the timeline?  It didn't make any sense. A Terminator was sent back to the 70s, and they just conveniently dismiss it by saying his memory was erased, so they don't have to explain it. Kyle gets memories from the alt timeline, but conveniently only the ones that they need to move the plot forward. They're willing to risk their entire plan based on a dream.  Surely it would've made more sense to jump to 97 first and see what's happening, even if they can't jump again and have to wait 20 years it'd be better than risk jumping after judgement day. Arnie was working in the Genisys building, but never thought to plant some explosives or sabotage their progress. Why would Arnie stockpile more weapons than they could ever use?  And no one ever had to look inside that place in 30 years? They decide to jump to the day before Genisys goes live, why not three years earlier when it was just getting started?  Give themselves some time to prepare and recon. Why was the countdown to launch the same as the countdown to Genisys being complete?  Who starts a launch countdown before they've even got a beta? Why would blowing up the building make any difference?  It's 2017, not the 90s.  If Genisys isn't in the cloud then it deserves to be destroyed."

There are just some people who will never, ever enjoy or appreciate a Terminator film that Cameron didn't make, and I understand that. I grew up on his films and I love them very dearly. This movie was a great tribute to those while being a worthy and entertaining sequel some 30 years after the fact.   I stand by my 8/10 rating given T1 and T2 are both perfect 10/10's, but I could understand why people had problems with the film."
Terminator,3butn1,s4in7,2,Thu Jul 2 19:37:54 2015 UTC,well think about it... the two that he did had a story to tell.  the ones he didn't do just seem like fan service.

Should of forgot all about that, doesnt do any justice. The actor to play Kyle Reese, very disappointed as you pointed out, he is too bulky to play a person in a war tern future living of rats etc. Very poor casting on his behalf"

Terminator,3butn1,PC509,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:52:55 2015 UTC,"John Connor would have been born before, but with a different father. Skynet & Judgement Day was inevitable. It just got a head start after they sent back the first Terminator. That's what moved Judgement Day up to 1997 in T2.   There are ways to explain those things, even if they contradict other things. It doesn't have to make a lot of sense, but it's an explanation of the nonsense."
Terminator,3butn1,PC509,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"It's a paradox. It's impossible without having another way far out explanation.   John Connor was always the leader of the resistance. Regardless of when he was born and who the father was. After he was beating Skynet, they sent back Kyle & the T800. This started a new timeline which Kyle was the father and the T800 was the catalyst for Skynet and Judgement Day. With each Terminator sent back, Skynet is changed and Judgement Day is moved, along with other future changes.   Even with that theory, it is just one of many futures. You go back once, and mess with the past, the future timeline is affected. So, you can have multiple futures (or infinite). Just with minor changes in the past. Different timelines with butterfly effect style changes in the past to create different futures. The 'original' timeline may or may not be T1. Maybe T1 was the first time that Reese was sent back to father John and warn of Skynet whereas before it was Skynet sending a technology back to create itself sooner than when it originally was (maybe kickstarting the development decades sooner).   Anyway - there are a million different theories and variations that could explain it. However, you have to keep twisting them more and more to get them to be somewhat 'logical' (even then, they really aren't). It's a movie, there are issues that can't be explained. So, fans make up certain things. In reality, though - that's just the way it is. No explanation. It's a movie, that's the plot. Reality changes to fit that plot, even if it doesn't work."
Terminator,3butn1,PC509,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"To change the future. Time is relative. To them, it's the first time they are sending someone back. Of course, the issue there is that the time traveler can tell them that he was sent back to change things and they send another with the same information, etc.. So, it doesn't work. It's a confusing thing if you try and make sense out of it. But, it's fun...   It's one of those movies where, like you said, you have to say ""fuck it"" and take it. There really is no way to call it good. Most time travel movies or stories have the same issue. That's why I subscribe to the multiple time lines theory. It helps make things a little better..."
Terminator,3butn1,lightbluestar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:22:38 2015 UTC,"I think you echo pretty well my opinion of the movie.  Your 'Example 1', yes this scene was funny but should have been on the dvd extended cut or a deleted scene.  I don't think I would be as harsh as you are though.  The Terminator franchise was always just an a big action movie.  It just so happened to be an interesting action movie (with scifi elements/time travel).  I would probably give it a 'B'."

Terminator,3by8h6,megatron_x,6,Fri Jul 3 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"Also to keep from influencing the future too much.  'Hey soldier, we have the same last name.  Oh, you want to hear about my dad (awkward pause)'.  Plus John Connor sounds more legit than John Reese imho."

Also, I think he goes by it at one time in Sarah Connor Chronicles (I know he goes by John Baum, but he pulls the Reese, or it might have been Sarah that did that...)."
Terminator,3by8h6,PC509,2,Fri Jul 3 04:05:06 2015 UTC,He doesn't have a birth certificate since I'm pretty sure he was born in some South American jungle and Sarah would want to leave as minimum a paper trail as possible.

Terminator,3bt3d8,StealthRabbi,0,Thu Jul 2 12:24:16 2015 UTC,It literally made everything they did pointless. It cheapened the film as a whole. They could have done it a number of ways. They went the weak route.
Terminator,3bt3d8,StagOfBaratheon,2,Thu Jul 2 18:10:37 2015 UTC,Agreed. I was kind of hoping they would just wrap it up. It's not like they don't still have material for other films.

Perhaps Skynet deployed several T-1000s among different points in history, and what we saw in T2 was one of the several T-1000s that landed in the past.  There's no indication how long Skynet was hiding/planning this move. Was Skynet pulling a long con? Did Skynet travel back in time to get Connor?   I have no idea who may have sent T-800 back to Sarah when she was young."

Terminator,3brfn5,youknowwho_92,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:23:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought it was really lame how he was handled in the movie. It made me feel the other movies were just irrelevant in a way. Either way I hope this doesn't mark the end of John.
Terminator,3brfn5,ON020,3,Thu Jul 2 06:53:44 2015 UTC,"I have this feeling that with the way things went for Connor. Kyle Reese will become the legend that Connor was originally meant to be.   1- the time skip to 2017 (where Connor would normally be 30 something) prevents John from being able to lead anything, let alone an entire resistance.  2- Reese knows most if not all the information Connor knows by the end of Genisys, making him a prime candidate for leader.  3- ""The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."" -Kyle Reese  This leads me to believe that the events of Genisys drastically changed/reset the future.  I believe it will go something like this -   The original timeline served to save John Connor, for the sole purpose of him saving Kyle Reese from the terminator that almost kills him at the beginning of the movie. The events continue from 2029, to 1984, then to 2017 where the future is completely altered.  With Skynet still being active after the explosion and there for still a threat, the fight continues. The Ai may or may not be aware of Pops' upgrade after his liquid metal bath.  I believe Judgment Day will still happen and the events at the beginning of Genisys will happen again, only with John and Kyles' roles reversed. Skynet will probably still see Connor as the main threat to it's existence due to prior knowledge of the past.  Arnie-800 will be sent to kill Connor after Judgment day due to the difference in his age (being a lot younger) and will succeed. Kyle Reese will then stop and reprogram him and send him back to the 70's to protect Sarah where we start back at the beginning of the past events of Genisys.  Or maybe I didn't pay enough attention. This is just something I've been thinking about since seeing the movie."
Terminator,3brfn5,st4nd4u,4,Thu Jul 2 03:27:18 2015 UTC,Well I love it. I hope the movie makes enough money to have this happen. Even with some subtle differences this makes for a great trilogy.
Terminator,3brfn5,JackSpadesSI,3,Thu Jul 2 13:16:35 2015 UTC,"Well, born-in-2017 John Connor could still lead if Judgement Day gets pushed back."
Terminator,3brfn5,st4nd4u,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:36:38 2015 UTC,"True that's possible, but he'd only be 12 years old by 2029 which would mean that everything would be pushed much further into the future.   I'm not sure the machines will be willing to wait for John to grow up haha."
Terminator,3brfn5,LayDownYourSoul,8,Fri Jul 3 08:12:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know who sent pops back, but I have a feeling pops was the one who killed her parents.  She said her home exploded and suddenly pops was there to raise her...with a bazooka.  You also don't know who sent him back, so while he was a good guy in the first of (hopefully) a trilogy, we'll find out more in the next two.  I wouldn't be surprised if he was a bad guy again.  Terminators are infiltration units.  Dats wat day do.  I think every time the resistance sends people back to thwart an attack by the machines, the machines send back more/different terminators.  Its kind of circular and I'll be interested in how they close it, if they can.  No idea why the T-1000 was in the 80s, probably sent back knowing that pops was there and they needed some extra T-1000 muscle to kill Connor.  These are my thoughts to your questions, dunno if I'm right or not."

Terminator,3brfn5,LayDownYourSoul,2,Thu Jul 2 15:03:32 2015 UTC,No it was the t1000
Terminator,3brfn5,tropicalrecon,3,Wed Jul 1 18:14:28 2015 UTC,"Also, just hit me.  The T-1000 was sent back to the 80s because pops was there.  In T2, Arnold says the T-1000 is an anti-terminator terminator.  So it makes sense to send back both a T-800 and a T-1000 when Reese and Arnold will be there."
Terminator,3brfn5,tonermcfly,5,Wed Jul 1 16:53:29 2015 UTC,"The t1000 was sent back to 1973, they have been running from it for 11 years."
Terminator,3brfn5,FormerRedditorAMA,2,Wed Jul 1 18:13:41 2015 UTC,"This is true. The whole exploding cabin thing with possibly my new favorite version of a Terminator; the mega bad-ass looking, bazooka wielding young T-800."
Terminator,3brfn5,yaosio,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:08:11 2015 UTC,They could make a prequel to genisys with that?  But it would have to be all cgi.
Terminator,3brfn5,KevinKelsey,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:20:43 2015 UTC,"If John Connor sent the T-800 back, he probably could have said, ""We beat the T-1000 by throwing it in molten metal"" And they could have gotten that T-1000 to fall into some molten metal too."
Terminator,3brfn5,LightningMango,3,Thu Jul 2 01:26:45 2015 UTC,I thought the Anti-Terminator Terminator was the T-X? That's what he says in Terminator 3.
Terminator,3brfn5,bhfroh,3,Wed Jul 1 17:33:47 2015 UTC,"Good point, but wasn't the T-X the anti-terminator terminator?"
Terminator,3brfn5,LayDownYourSoul,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:35:59 2015 UTC,"No, the TX is the anti terminator. The T1000 is just an advanced prototype"

Terminator,3brfn5,LightningMango,3,Wed Jul 1 21:30:13 2015 UTC,There is a post-credits scene.
Terminator,3brfn5,LightningMango,4,Wed Jul 1 18:16:39 2015 UTC,dammit I knew i should've stayed. What happened?
Terminator,3brfn5,tropicalrecon,3,Wed Jul 1 18:54:22 2015 UTC,The central core of Skynet was still glowing red in a bowl and than Skynet himself projected and looked at it and than the scene went black..  They should of ended the movie with that instead...
Terminator,3brfn5,Divtya_Budhlya,3,Wed Jul 1 18:58:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. I wasn't too pleased with the happy bubble-gum sweet ending. Especially if they want to build into a new trilogy, it would've been better leaving it a bit dark. Would've added more suspense and meaning"
Terminator,3brfn5,tropicalrecon,3,Wed Jul 1 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"Or they could of ended it with them fully convinced that there was no more Skynet, so pops lowers himself into lava convinced ""1 more chip needs to be destroyed""."
Terminator,3brfn5,tropicalrecon,3,Wed Jul 1 19:36:20 2015 UTC,Lets be honest here Arnold is the only saving grace here.  I know it seems wise to write him off. But my heart can't handle that.  :(
Terminator,3brfn5,tonermcfly,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:48:59 2015 UTC,They showed an orb intact in all the rubble and we see Skynet  almost taking the form of Matt Smith.
Terminator,3brfn5,glmn,3,Thu Jul 2 09:15:54 2015 UTC,"So we're left at this, who sent the t800 to 1973? When will judgement day happen as the Skynet backup was secure? Will they even have a kid and name him John?   On the bright side we don't have to wait another decade like the past films."
Terminator,3brfn5,tropicalrecon,3,Wed Jul 1 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"This is what I am worried about. The movie is on pace for the same pre-release as The Lone Ranger, which isn't good. I work in a office building of about 75 people no-one is excited for this.  That and my movie theater was giving tickets to this showing at the front door 5 minutes before it started and only 6 people were in the theater.  Am I worried? Very much!"
Terminator,3brfn5,tropicalrecon,2,Wed Jul 1 18:30:31 2015 UTC,"The only good news is that the next one; they will have to try harder. It was a good movie not great, but they should definitely find a new director."
Terminator,3brfn5,matt4787,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"Same here. We saw the first 3D showing allowed at 7pm last night. There couldn't have been more than 16 people in that theater. As much as I loved it, I'm afraid this film just might bomb."

Terminator,3brfn5,sonictank,2,Wed Jul 1 22:20:07 2015 UTC,"OK so I see confusion here, the T-1000 was sent back to 1973 to kill Sarah, they have been running from that terminator unit for 11 years. It killed her parents, which prompted tpops to launch an RPG at the trailer."
Terminator,3brfn5,matt4787,2,Wed Jul 1 18:17:02 2015 UTC,I think the John Conner from the deleted timeline sent him back.
Terminator,3brfn5,skorponok,2,Wed Jul 1 19:34:42 2015 UTC,I kind of look at different sentient beings with Skynet. The Skynet AI from the original is different AI (being if you will) than the Skynet in this one. I wouldn't be surprised if Skynet was the one who sent back pops to insure its existence for some reason. Some sort of causality loop perhaps.
Terminator,3brfn5,dabenpb,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:56:57 2015 UTC,"Two things:   How did Sarah and the Guardian know that Reese was being attacked by a T-1000? They were expecting the T-800 and took care of it, but if Reese had landed just as expected in the normal 1984 timeline, he wouldn't have been under attack (since the the T-800 is now down) and hence, no need to drive a armored truck into a building in order to save him.   EDIT: I see now that the same T-1000 that attacked Reese is the same one that tried to kill Sarah 11 years ago. Still, they knew it was going to attack Reese right when he lands?   Probably nothing, but there was a throwaway line by Sarah where she said something to the effect of ""do you expect for me to hole up in a room and bed you?"" to Reese, who didn't seem to think nothing of that. However, he doesn't know about being with Sarah yet. I'm probably just interpreting this incorrectly. If the Guardian had been prepping for 30+ years for their arrival, why did they have to waste time loading bullets into a magazine? Shouldn't eveyrthing have been ready to go? Or, even, why didn't the Guardian take out Cyberdyne by itself before it built up into a behemoth?"
Terminator,3bto9d,davoonline,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"I'm literally confused regarding Skynet sending bunch of Terminators back to multiple timeline. Does that mean Skynet anticipates all of this or when Kyle is in Time Displacement Field and John is atracked, it created a ripple in the timeline that causes multiple chain of events occurs in the past so Skynet send back everything they got to prevent from their extinction?"
Terminator,3bto9d,Forrester96,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:34:47 2015 UTC,Im saying that the '84 terminator we know and love is from the future seen at the begining of T1. The Genisys T800 we see going back in time was Pops
Terminator,3bto9d,EVula,0,Thu Jul 2 03:30:32 2015 UTC,"Skynets last effort was to send T800 back to '84.  Or at least it does in the timeline told to john by sarah from kyle.  And Skynet knows this too.   But this time around,  Skynet choose to send its T800 to '73."
Terminator,3bto9d,panopticonisi,2,Thu Jul 2 03:27:02 2015 UTC,"But this time around, Skynet choose to send its T800 to '73.   But they didn't; the T-800 sent to 1973 was ""Pops,"" it was a T-1000 that was sent to 1973 to kill young Sarah."
Terminator,3bto9d,EVula,0,Thu Jul 2 19:55:57 2015 UTC,Why send a T800 to '84 if one is on its way?
Terminator,3bto9d,panopticonisi,0,Thu Jul 2 03:32:14 2015 UTC,"yeah, genisys' writers fucked up. skynet only sent back a t800 to 1984. no one has explained who ended up creating t1000s, who sent one of them back to kill 9 year old sarah, and who sent one to 1984 to kill Kyle Reese. and worst of all, they never explain where pops came from. and also a t800 that posed as an dhs agent and tried to kill jk Simmons."
Terminator,3bto9d,EVula,3,Thu Jul 2 07:02:38 2015 UTC,"and also a t800 that posed as an dhs agent and tried to kill jk Simmons.   I don't remember a T-800 trying to kill JK Simmons, that was CyberJohn that shot him in the arm."
Terminator,3bto9d,panopticonisi,0,Thu Jul 2 19:54:45 2015 UTC,you may be right. i'm a bit hazy on that part of the movie. my point as to where the t1000s and pops came from still stands though.
Terminator,3btdxc,c0llision,6,Thu Jul 2 00:08:11 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the movie, but I can't say I would put it on par with either T1 or T2(Personally, I consider T1 and T2 to be on par with each other). I'd say it was definitely better than T3 and T4. The beginning to middle portion of the movie was wonderful, especially for anyone knowledgeable of the first two films. I'm a bit iffy on the quality of the ending, but it was at least decent. Overall, I was very pleased."

Terminator,3btdxc,LayDownYourSoul,5,Thu Jul 2 04:31:32 2015 UTC,I said it in another thread. I think it's Arnold. He's had some good movies since he left office and none have been bad but they're ALL panned by the critics. I honestly think it's because of his time as republican governor.
Terminator,3btdxc,TheWhitCat,2,Thu Jul 2 12:06:19 2015 UTC,"I think it is a bit strange as well, but I respect everyone's opinions. I think this film really needs the fans to embrace it so the numbers speak for itself. I am very happy Arnold is back."
Terminator,3bsd6s,Lemon30,2,Wed Jul 1 19:29:58 2015 UTC,"Never answered The T-800 protected her during this time John knew about the future because in his time line sarah told him everything. John turned evil because skynet pretty much transformed him into a terminator genetically Skynet was disguised as a solider in his army. It was essentially skynet's plan b, think of the solider as a stand alone server."
Terminator,3bsd6s,Nathorus86,2,Wed Jul 1 20:47:03 2015 UTC,"They purposely don't tell you who sent him back. They make a point of saying the files were erased.   She had a terminator at the age of nine. That's probably when the t1000 was sent back. Same time as the t800.   This is the paradox that is all terminator movies.   Skynet infiltrated the base and attacked him with a new t3000, turning him into a machine.   Why? To win. How? They're infiltration units. That's what terminators do."
Terminator,3bsd6s,LayDownYourSoul,0,Wed Jul 1 23:51:42 2015 UTC,"About point 3, what I'm trying to say is, John knew about the time machine and whole rebellion happened because John knew what was going to happen in the future, right? He sent Reese to go after T-800 but to reach that point he must know about the future. This is probably the same for the original timeline. That's what I wanted to know. How did he know the future in the first place? Because if he did not he couldn't have become successful enough to reach the time machine and even shut skynet down."
Terminator,3bsd6s,davoonline,-1,Wed Jul 1 19:34:19 2015 UTC,You saw skynet send pops back in Genisys.
Terminator,3bsd6s,bhfroh,4,Wed Jul 1 19:46:05 2015 UTC,Skynet didn't send pops back. Someone else did.
Terminator,3bsd6s,davoonline,0,Thu Jul 2 02:15:20 2015 UTC,"The Arnie from T2 had detailed files on the T1000. Detailed files on himself as the one who travels back in time.  So this means that Skynet knew it would send something to '84. Even Pops knew it would show.    For the future to change, Something had to disrupt the timeline in the instant Reece had new memories.  He had no new memories in T1.   Skynet calculated this and im sure each and every failed attempt is recorded.  Just like how Pops knew how to build a time machine and TermaConner couldn't get one going.   That tells me Genisys and Skynet are going to war and Conner will lead them to victory.  Only other souls who knew anything would be john,  sarah,  kyle or johns wife  I think it was skynets plan to let sarah succeed to prevent Genisys from starting...   I really dont know"

Terminator,3bpvsu,tonermcfly,4,Wed Jul 1 04:51:20 2015 UTC,"T3 is the Phantom Menace of the bunch - Sure it had all the elements of a terminator movie, it just wasn't put together well. Salvation was like On Her Majesty's Secret Service. It was about James Bond, but really it was unrecognizable in the series."

Terminator,3bpvsu,sephtis,3,Wed Jul 1 06:52:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have guessed T4 ever rated ""average"" in any scale&context used by a  fan of the  franchise.  In my books, T3 and T4 are both massive fucking shit/10 as Terminator movies and solid 4/10s as summer fun times movies.  Genesys  felt like a Terminator movie, atleast. One with lots of flaws and plenty of good parts. I don't hate it and totally bought the fan service it delivered.  Easy to recommend for fans.  How I miss times when Cameron still made movies."
Terminator,3bpvsu,Kal_Vas_Flam,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:40:54 2015 UTC,"I don't hate t4 as much as most people, it's main flaws to me were the retarded display that was Skynet (who seemed to be a complete retard), and the awful plot in general.

Terminator,3bq2x7,aDinoSupremacist,3,Wed Jul 1 06:06:26 2015 UTC,My best stab at the Genisys Timeline so far is:  1971:  T1000 attempts to assasinate 9yo Sarah Connor but is intercepted by Reprogrammed T800 (sent by unknown)  1984:  T101 intercepted by Sarah Connor and (R)T800 and eliminated  Kyle intercepted by T1000 but saved by SC and (R)T800  T1000 eliminated by SC and (R)T800  SC and Kyle sent forwards to 2017 by (R)T800 (using time machine made from junk and the T101 CPU)  2014:  Assimilated John Connor infiltrates Cyberdyne Systems and codes Skynet under cover of the Genesys Social Network  Assimilated John Connor begins construction of time machine and T1000 material  2017:  SC and Kyle intercepted by T1000 and Assimilated John Connor but evade with aid of (R)T800  Fights ensue  Assimilated John Connor eliminated using incomplete time machine and Skynet servers destroyed  (R)T800 upgraded to T1000 (by magic)  Skynet Machine Phase Avatar survives in mysterious core  2029:  T101 sent back to 1984  Main Skynet destroyed  Kyle sent back to 1984  Skynet Machine Phase Avatar (Dr Who!) infects John Connor with Machine Phase Matter and assimilates him  Assimilated John Connor sent back to 2014
Terminator,3bq2x7,atopiary,2,Wed Jul 1 09:08:57 2015 UTC,Like I said in my post I think it's cool how in the timeline now there is robots from different futures

Terminator,3bq2x7,reece1495,3,Wed Jul 1 06:14:14 2015 UTC,the original t-800 is from a different future to the t-3000

Terminator,3bppsh,s4in7,6,Wed Jul 1 03:54:26 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I had a lot of fun watching the film and thought it was the best since T2. I, too, liked salvation lol.   Admittedly, I was sometimes a bit disappointed how ""comedic"" Arnies terminator was at times.  I felt like if they wanted to convey the idea that Arnold still could kick ass as a terminator, humor would detract from that. That being said, Arnie still kicked some serious ass."

Terminator,3bppsh,Thizzlebot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:11:17 2015 UTC,The humor kind of bugged me too but the Terminator had been adapting with humans for so long that I just wrote it off as learned behaviors.
Terminator,3bppsh,omegadeity,2,Wed Jul 1 21:37:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly. In T2, Arnold explained that the more time a Terminator spends among Humans the more it learns how to blend in. By the end of the film that Terminator had been living among humans for 40+ years(1974-2017). That's a LONG time to learn human behaviors.   While they may have taken it to the borderline with the humor at times, I think it was very well done. The smiling Arnold was absolutely creepy, which is what you'd expect from something only SIMULATING behaviors."

What the fuck ever, I'm a hardcore Terminator fan and this is one of the most loyal adaptations I've ever seen. T3 was a horrible piece of shit because it shat all over the lore but this movie was so on point and respectful of the original franchise. They even included the ""what the hell"" truck driver!

I think it stands above 3 and Salvation. Upset though at the overwhelmingly negative response from other viewers!"
Terminator,3bppsh,GeneralRose,2,Wed Jul 1 05:32:04 2015 UTC,"Fully agree. Easily the best Terminator since Cameron. It sucks how fact I don't fucking hate this movie is all it'd take to land on such spot. Film stands on it's own feet. Well, maybe not feet but foot. I enjoyed the shameless  fan service and many of the plot twists. Arnold& John Connor were great I thought. Khaleesi was not any good as  Sarah and I've no clue how dude who does Reese has ended up as an action film actor at all. Void of charisma.  So overall, casting for this movie saw some pretty bad fuck ups I thought. Here and there, there was an ounce of  the same jagged edge warmth Cameron does so well. Ounce is not enough, but it is an ounce more than T3 + T4 combined. This was Shit casting, Wasted opportunities, much to like, bit of warmth and third Terminator movie."
Terminator,3bppsh,PandaSnafu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:47:08 2015 UTC,"I think the film has a lot of issues, but on the whole rests somewhere between T3 and Salvation for me.    My biggest gripe is a severe lack of Robert Patrick. I would have enjoyed him in the ""pops"" role over Arnold. It would have been an interesting move to make. Or he could have been one of the faces the T1000 took when chasing Reese in 1984.      Speaking of Reese, Jai Courtney was so miscast. Regardless of him being a pretty shitty actor he was the complete wrong build and the 1984 scenes really emphasized the differences between him and the original."

Terminator,3bppsh,Thizzlebot,0,Thu Jul 2 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"Huge Terminator fan here as well.  I also didn't mind Salvation, preferred it over T3.  But boy do I disagree with you guys.  I've been looking forward to this movie more than SW episode VII, and I've got to say I was somewhat disappointed, I'm actually pissed how disappointed I am.  The movie seemed borderline Bollywood type of movie, almost comparable to Sharknado as far as acting and dialog goes.  Arnie did an awesome job but the rest just didn't do it for me.    It was missing a little bit of darker side of how every other Terminator ended.  I really think this may be the death in terminator franchise, the only positive thing that I can say is that it made me appreciate the previous movies that much more :(  I hope I'm wrong, but I just can't imagine this movie doing any better than salvation did at the box office."
Terminator,3bppsh,GeneralRose,3,Wed Jul 1 05:28:42 2015 UTC,"You have some good points and I respect your opinion. The color palette was literally brighter than any other Terminator--definitely not the blues and blacks of Cameron, or the washed out hues of Salvation. So it was literally less dark ;)"

Terminator,3brqd2,DatNerdyKid,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"I understand the point of the T-800 becoming the T-1000, Just because Arnold is going to continue to age and they will go with that as the movies progress.. If they even do. There were only 6 people in my movie theater as well.  Also there was some foreshadowing with Arnold saying that they don't have to worry about the liquid medal without a chip.  But it was a plot point that I wasn't that impressed with either. I am seeing this movie again on Friday to digest better."

Terminator,3brqd2,s4in7,2,Wed Jul 1 23:52:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wasn't born for either T1 or T2. I hadn't seen either of those when T3 came out (I was only 7, so a little too young to see the others) and I have no idea why we didn't see Salvation in theatres.  Point is, I think this is definitely one of the better films. Salvation has long been my favourite but rewatching T1 and T2 the last few days has jumbled around with me a bit. Sure it has issues I didn't like but I don't get what all the hate is about.  On that, it really pisses me off when people on the reddit/imdb boards for this call ""studio plant!"" whenever they see a good review for this.

They had the right weapons and had already scouted a location where they could take out a T-1000. The original movie Reese only had what he could scrounge up in a few days while on the run in a world totally alien to him."

Terminator,3bo38q,banquof,9,Tue Jun 30 19:41:53 2015 UTC,"T:TSCC is without doubt my favorite iteration of terminator. The series gave it the breathing room to explore philosophical concepts. There were times where it was actually quite touching. The ending made me cry. The music was the best of the entire saga. Cameron does the terminator perfectly - kind of amazed they didn't capitalize this and put her into the movies.  T3 is garbage, Salvation was fun but eh, not sure about this.  I wish they had continued the tv show in some form."
Terminator,3bo38q,throwawayfodder,2,Tue Jun 30 20:35:31 2015 UTC,Agreed. T3 was just gallons of suck. Tscc was thematically and stylistically the logical follow up to t2.

Terminator,3bo38q,starbowline,3,Tue Jun 30 22:36:49 2015 UTC,"It was such a good show! I was shocked to death when they canceled it. (I thought it was pretty popular too??)   I think I read somewhere that it takes such a sharp turn halfway through season 2 because they found out it might not have another season... So they had to come up with an ending that could be the ending or could be just a season cliff hanger.   I was glad they ret-conned to T2. Like you I consider this the ""true"" cannon, or at least my preferred one. I do kinda like that the Terminator universe could be opened up to more than just Arnold."

Terminator,3bo38q,SomeKindOfChief,3,Wed Jul 1 03:38:31 2015 UTC,"TSCC is literally the only show that got me all sorts of mad and sad when it abruptly ended. And I didn't even watch it as it came out... I watched it maybe 2 years afterwards and totally thought things were going to wrap up by the end of season 2 (which might have made things worse).  Even my two favorite shows - The Sopranos and Game of Thrones, which are arguably better than TSCC - had they just stopped in the middle of nowhere, I probably could just accept it. But TSCC... heck Terminator has a special place in my heart and I was waaay upset with that cliffhanger. tears"

They had to do some things to make it somewhat plausible within the mythos to even have this movie and the next two even happen.   It was an enjoyable movie overall.   Also, the movie theater in Colombia at the Monteria mall was far superior to the US. Cheaper tickets, concessions were cheap even after considering the exchange rate. Best movie theater popcorn ever, also cheap, lightly salted and not a heart attack in a bag. In US currency the ticket was like $3.00 and a giant bucket of popcorn and a giant soda (without high fructose corn syrup, real sugar) cost about another $3.00 total.  They had a combo, giant popcorn giant soda giant hot dog....$4.00 after conversion."
Terminator,3bpm8r,erythrasma,0,Wed Jul 1 03:33:44 2015 UTC,"I dunno.  In order for John to be born, and for that particular John to exist, Kyle and Sarah have to bang in 1984 and Sarah has to give birth to him in order for him to meet Kyle and get Kyle into the machine.  So, as soon as Kyle arrives and him and Sarah don't bang, and then they leave for 2017, the entire movie falls apart.    There are a sequence of events that have to occur in order for the story to come close to making sense.  If Kyle doesn't do the deed and if John isn't born, then none of it makes any sense.    Also, the entire plot of the first film is stop John from being born by killing Sarah.  But here, they stopped John from being born by sending Sarah and Kyle into the future.  So, machines should still win?"

But my bigger point is that these plot holes were so massive that I couldn't ignore them.

Terminator,3bqsv0,thoughtdrinker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"I was able to excuse the plot holes, I guess, because the movie just FELT so much more like a terminator movie to me. Rise and Salvation had plot holes, too, while also being terrible in other ways. The goofy tone of 3 was all wrong, and 4 was a completely boring mess that robbed the terminators of all their menace (excuse me, but a T-800 gets its hands on John Connor and then just throws him around instead of reaching into his chest and popping his heart?)  Here's how I excused the problems you bring up:  The argument of 2017 wasn't really a problem for me. Reese established that his memories were real because he had knowledge he could not otherwise have (Sarah's father's last words to her). Plus if they went to 1997, they would have to wait it out for 20 years, not 10.  The problem of a T-800 building a time machine in the 80's while a T-3000 couldn't get one operational with infinite budget in 2017 is definitely something I wondered about, but it seemed like such a glaring inconsistency that it almost had to be intentional. I'm hoping the answer is tied up with the other mysteries of the movie (who sent Pops back, when, and why?) that I assume the sequels intend to explore.  It definitely doesn't match T1 and T2, but I felt it got a lot more right than T3 and T4. It just seemed rushed to me -- like it could have been great with another draft or two of the script, but it got close enough to make me happy and hopeful for the followup (if this does well enough to warrant one)."

This is a video I captured of Arnold Schwarzenegger doing a Q&A afterwards. He answers questions about being a redditor, Genesys and other possible (or not) movies projects such as sequels to Twins, Predator, Conan and more.  Thanks Arnold for hosting us and for those that have doubts about Genisys, don't. It's a great summer movie. I enjoyed it much more than 3 and Salvation and I'm confused by all the low critic reviews.  Not that I put much value on critic reviews for summer action movies though."

Terminator,3bh6rr,YaKoStar,0,Tue Jun 30 02:03:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I have to disagree with you. Jai Cortney's acting was probably the worst part of the movie and I'm gonna explain why I think this movie is the worst Terminator movie together with T3.   *******SPOILERS********** DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE *****************SPOILERS***********  The movie might also be called ""The death of Kyle Reese as we came to love him"", as Jai Courtney is probably the biggest miscast of all time. Gone are Michael Biehn's nuance portrayal of a psychologically scarred and physically fatigued soldier doomed to a tragic fate as he tries to fight impossible odds to save the women he loves. Instead, we have a clean shaved and chiseled smart-ass who spends the entire movie being a HUGE asshole to Arnold (with multiple stare contests between him and Arnold ALA Twilight) , and who is looking to ""score"" with Emilia Clarke's Sarah (who actually does a descent job playing Sarah). A big element of Reese's character in T1 was his virginity, something the audiences gulped down because of Biehn's performance. Courtney's Reese comes across someone who LOVES his soldier job way too much and has tamed many members of the opposite sex. There is ZERO chemistry between the him and Sarah, and the inherent romance (which in my opinion was quite smart in Terminator) becomes another obligatory check box for the movie to tick. I wont even go into the ""humor"" between Arnold and Emilia on this topic (borrowed from T3) that the movie tries to choke it audiences with multiple time. This movie is a disgrace to T1 and T2, just like T3 was."
Terminator,3bh6rr,tropicalrecon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:45:41 2015 UTC,"jai courtney as i said was the least good in this movie.But if i had to compare him with  claire danes or the other guy from T3, its NOT even close he is much better.T3 would have been a sucessfull continuation if it didnt have  that horrendous casting and casting. All the terminator after the T2 had 1 minor problem the synergy between casting and the movie itself. C.Bale is one of the best actors of our generation no doubt, he never never  managed to adapt on his role which didnt even have tough acting moments' Emilia clarke was magnificent imoi as young sharah, Jason clarke was good aswell"

The film wasn't perfect and I dislike the humor as much as the next fan of the classics (T1 is my fav of the series) but I'm glad they're doing something with the franchise as opposed to leaving me with the taste of Terminator 3 and Salvation in my mouth, which I think this film was substantially better than.

Terminator,3bdqvz,rezivor,2,Sun Jun 28 06:43:27 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the time travel theories you believe in. Time could be relative, so with each change (time travel), a new time line is created. The original time line still exists, but from the viewpoint of the traveler, they are creating and changing their timeline. So, in one Skynet is destroyed. In another, they win. In another, they don't exist....   Fringe, Continuum, Terminator: SCC, etc. kind of visit that. They start a different timeline and it's different from that point of view."

Terminator,3bcvjy,BeoWulfWasTaken,5,Sun Jun 28 00:43:37 2015 UTC,"Because the machines did not collect any real-time data from the events back in time. They sent a machine to kill Sarah and it failed- They could make the assumption that an Adult Sarah Connor was too difficult a target so they went to strike at John when he was a child.   I think the reasons that they maybe didn't try and kill Sarah as a child is perhaps the technology wasn't advanced enough when she was young for the terminator to successfully track her down, as it is able to when technology(police databases) allows for greater detective work."
Terminator,3bcvjy,rezivor,4,Sun Jun 28 06:49:32 2015 UTC,"John Connor is the leader of the resistance, not Sarah. By killing her in the first one, it would prevent him from being born. In the second one he's already been born - if they kill her now, it wouldn't make a difference."

Terminator,3bcvjy,Mm2k,4,Sun Jun 28 15:06:03 2015 UTC,"As I understand it SkyNet just shot-gunned terminators into the past without too much information about their targets, as the resistance was about to over run its Central Core in the original timeline.. Perhaps Temporal Machinics was just a side study of SkyNet that only became important as the resistance gained more and more ground. Fighting a retreating battle and running low on resources it cobbles together a basic rig, scans its data base for info from those times and grabs a selection of it best models, then throws them down stream to various dates with a list of priority and secondary targets. We get to see these events as one after another situations, but in reality all these terminators appeared almost simultaneously at their respective dates from a single moment in the future."

Terminator,3bcvjy,jaguars5,2,Sun Jun 28 03:07:06 2015 UTC,"No, if John is killed at any point before key turning points in the war, it would change the future and the machines would win. Since John is already born in T2, it makes no difference if Sarah is killed.   Also FYI, in T3 they explain why terminator units are only sent to certain points in time. It is because Skynet knew Sarah's location in 1984 , then after John's birth he became impossible to tract until 1995 which is when they sent back the T-1000.   Since 1995 Conner has been on the run and changes his appearance, thus he has blonde hair in T3 and brown in T2. They cannot find him so Skynet sends the TX to assassinate Conners wife and lieutenants as well as initiate judgement day. When the TX taps into Skynet in 2003, the data from the past and alternate future is synchronized into Skynets database. Which changes the future and is the reason that in the new future, Skynet has all the code required to build the terminators faster and avoid the mistakes comitted by sending two terminators to assisinate her as a child and then another in 1984."

Terminator,3bd2xy,tropicalrecon,2,Sun Jun 28 02:13:06 2015 UTC,"This, and I will try to elaborate more."
Terminator,3bd2xy,bhfroh,2,Sun Jun 28 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"First a plea for no spoiling (with out tagging) anything about Genisys.  I will try to answer your question (possible spoilers for previous Terminator movies/TV show).  Ok, so I have not seen Genisys yet but it is my understanding that it is a reboot/retcon of the franchise.  It is supposed to be the first movie of a trilogy of some kind (hopefully that will happen).  The Terminator franchise has passed between different hands over its lifetime (studios/creative teams).  I liken it to Star Wars in a way.  T1/T2 are like Ep. 4-5, T3 and Salvation are like  Ep. 1-3, and Genisys is like Ep. 7.  Using this analogy the production company that currently owns the right to the Terminator franchise is kind of like Disney owning SW.  They get to decide what is canon/how the timelines work.    Ok, so going with just the first 4 movies and the TV show this is how I rationalize the timeline (my headcanon).  The Terminator: We have a story that takes place in the 'present' and the future.  We have Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor.  Kyle Reese is sent back from the future to stop her death/father John Connor with her.  I believe Reese mentions at some point during the movie that time travel is difficult to understand and that the future he has come from is now different somewhat the future that will now exist even though he saves/impregnates Sarah Connor.  He also claims that the resistance has basically won and that in a hail mary attempt Skynet has sent 1 terminator to the past, then the resistance  sends him back, then they allegedly destroy the time machine.  Nothing is really done to prevent/postpone Judgement Day.  T2: We have a story that takes place in the 'present' with a little glimpse of the future.  We have Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor.  I understand this to be the same timeline/universe as T1.  Apparently Kyle Reese was wrong about the Time Machine being destroyed after he came through or there was another time machine that Skynet had access to.  This is a little confusing.  Another possibility is that the future that Kyle Reese was sent back from in T1 is a different future from the one that good Terminator is sent back from in T2.  Regardless, good Terminator is sent back to protect young John Connor from T1000.  Also, Cyberdyne/Miles Dyson is destroyed, which postpones Judgement Day.  T3: I understand this to be the same timeline/universe as the first 2 movies.  No Sarah Connor this time as she has died from leukemia.  Another good Terminator is sent back and a bad T-x is sent back to kill basically everyone it can (John Connor, Kate Brewster, other resistance members).  I understand that because Judgement day keeps getting pushed into the future, the technology available to Skynet when it because self aware increases and thus it is able to send back better terminators (T1000 and then T-X).  In this movie we learn that Judgement Day has just been postponed and that it is the US military who trigger Judgement day.  As a result of this, a possible alternate future has been created where now John Connor has a wife.  We also learn that even though there is no fate but what we make one can not stop the future.  One can only change/postpone it.  There will always be a Judgement Day triggered by some catalyst.  John Connor will always fight Skynet.  Skynet will always lose eventually.  Salvation:   So this movie takes place in the present briefly and then the future mainly.  The present part of the movie may take place from a similar timeline to T3 about a year before the events of T3 and the new Judgement Day.  Cyberdyne (one assumes a newly reformed company than the one destroyed in T2) begins work on human cybernetics.  So now in this timeline Cyberdyne is not directly responsible for the creation of Skynet, but rather the creation of early Terminator technology which Skynet will later refine post Judgement Day to create there more advanced Terminators.  In the future about 14  years after the new Judgement day, Sarah Connor is still dead although she is speaking from beyond the grave through tapes she made (as seen in T1).  John is becoming the leader of the resistance and is married to Kate Brewster who now is caring his unborn child.  In the course of the movie he meets a young Kyle Reese.  The resistance is able to defeat Skynet's base in California, but it is alluded to the fact that they still have a large global presence and that the war is far from won yet. There is no mention of time machines or time travel.  One can only assume that if a true sequel to Salvation had been made then John would have found Skynet's time machine and sent Kyle Reese back in time effectively closing the loop so to speak.  (One other bookend I like is that in Salvation, Marcus grabs Kyle's gun from him and then later shows him how to make a gun strap to prevent this from happening.  In T1 we see Kyle fashioning a similar strap for his sawed off shotgun).  Sarah Connor Chronicles:  I see this is an alternate universe to the movies.  In this timeline, Sarah Connor jumps forward with John Connor and thus does not die of cancer/leukemia (or at least delays i tmuch later).  John Connor does not meet Kate Brewster again and does not marry her.  There is a lot more time travel and it is explained that the resistance has reverse engineered time machines and now possesses and uses the technology.  Also due to time traveling/postponing Judgement day, a new machine faction has emerged that is willing to ally itself with the resistance/mankind.  Wow, I love the Terminator franchise because of its crazy time travel/alternate timelines but it sure gets hard to reconcile when you really think about it (which one probably is not supposed to think too hard about anyways).  I hope that Genisys streamlines the canon for the better."

Terminator,3bbk38,Anubis4574,5,Sat Jun 27 17:26:35 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly they don't actually set out to create these negatively reviewed attempts at starting a trilogy.   Salvation tried to do a similar concept and failed. Why did it fail? Numerous reasons. But your concept fails in the same way sequels do. It lacks any kind of imagination and each film sounds bland as hell.   Salvation didn't work. So from a financial stand point, it made sense to use the time travel to envelope and reuse the original assets that worked so well. Sadly, it seems like that they won't utilise that idea in a very compelling way."
Terminator,3bbk38,ChrisWithGlasses,2,Sat Jun 27 21:38:50 2015 UTC,"Salvation had a similar concept but a terrible execution. It seems with each new sequel they keep adding new, wacky Terminator ideas (the hybrid in T3, Marcus, and now Connor/transcendent machine). Back to Salvation, it seems extremely out of place in terms of feel and setting. It was too jarring of a Terminator experience. It also satisfied none if the lore questions people were asking - it served as a seed into Reese's role, but just threw us into a military resistance with Connor as an icon without exposition. It felt fake.   It is my belief that if they made a film (hypothetically, pretend like Gen and Salvation never happened) that showed us on screen John's transformation from random guy to leader over time, they could make a decent film out of it. Then the second film would introduce Reese (or the end of the first). These kinds of constraints do not force the filmmakers into making a shitty out-of-place film (although it is not guaranteed success)."
Terminator,3bbk38,Superdudeo,2,Sat Jun 27 22:09:42 2015 UTC,"I think the trilogy you suggest was the obvious idea. Not in a negative way, I think it's definitely something that would have been considered but binned because of the massive cost to set that kind of trilogy in the future - can you imagine the sets it would take etc? No way is it bland.  However, there's so much scope to take the series, why tell that story that we already kind of know when we could take it into something new? Let's get rid of Arnie for a goddamn start.  Sadly, I think it will likely be decades away before we see a decent Terminator film, Genisys will put it to sleep for now."
Terminator,3bbk38,neatntidy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:39:24 2015 UTC,"I always liked Arnold. But honestly, my preposition was only if the producers just had to make a trilogy. The best action should have been to stop making films after the second film -because they changed their fate. Judgement Day was thwarted. The sequels just alienate the central message of T2 in order to make money-gouging sequels."
Terminator,3bbk38,s4in7,2,Sun Jun 28 01:43:42 2015 UTC,"One of the core set pieces of the Terminator series is crazy future killing machines in present day. That is the what hooks people into the series. Making a post-apocalyptic trilogy is a novel idea, but it's not a Terminator movie. It's a man vs machines movie, with T-800's as bad guys. That was the original genius of T1 and T2; showing how lopsided the world is when you have a nuclear powered endo skeleton running around."
Terminator,3bbk38,s4in7,0,Mon Jun 29 23:35:49 2015 UTC,"How can you say it's already failed? 10 reviews are in, 4 of the them are good. Yeah--40% isn't great but audiences haven't even seen the film yet and they dictate whether a movie sinks or swims. If it turns out to be a poorly reviewed movie but rakes in loads of cash (a la Jurassic World) then it'd be pretty hard to call it a 'failure'.  I have hope--maybe stupidly, maybe not--that this will be the better than T3 and Salvation which would make me very happy."
Terminator,3bbk38,s4in7,2,Sun Jun 28 16:21:46 2015 UTC,"In my book, a film that makes a lot of money but lacks any discernible quality is still a failure. Yes, its still too early to be absolutely certain it's a bad film, but judging based on the terrible plot shown in the trailer and the RT score, it's a safe assumption (plus, a good Terminator film hasn't been made for over twenty years)."

I could have sworn I remember reading somewhere that the T800/Reese being sent back actually happened in the same timeline that the T1000/T800 were sent back. That upon discovery of the TDE and the T800 of T1 being sent back, Connor sent Reese in response. But when they looked deeper, they found that the T1000 was also sent, and that was when they stumbled upon the T800s in cryostasis. One of which was then reprogrammed and sent to protect John in T2. Also, to my understanding that there was a little bit of a difference between what I said and what was omitted from the final script in T2. Either way, I love the site and I can't wait to see how T:G plays it all out!  EDIT: Fixed grammar"

The original timeline unfolds just as it does, and SkyNet has no influence over its creation in this timeline.   Come the day the resistance is battering on the front door and SkyNet probably doesnt have enough time to contemplate the hows and wherefores of time travel or gather enough intelligence on former members as Reese says that they had it beat just before he left. SkyNet would just be taking a punt in the dark and hoping its gamble pays off in a rebooted present. The Terminators appearing in different points have seemed to have some influence on the future as Judgement Day is pushed into different starting dates. Each starting point, however, results in most records being destroyed and future SkyNet being none the wiser about the past."

Also, even if Connor told Kyle Reese , ""HEY WHEN U KILL THE THING DESTROY IT ALL"" it didn't matter because he was dead and didn't say a thing to Sarah Connor, so she didn't know that leaving the arm was a big deal.

Terminator,3au7n6,TiredUnicorn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:00:41 2015 UTC,"Looks a lot better than the first trailer. The first trailer looks like they pulled Arnold out of the original film with the film grain, while this one uses a real guy with CG on top of them. Naked Arnold looks really cartoony running though, not sure what's up with that since they would have obviously mocapped it and video games character animations just fine. Maybe he actually looks like that when he runs and it's why we've never seen him run."

It pissed me off because if they just allow themselves to get immersed into the story, forget cgi and see the story they are telling, it's one of the best films ever.   The best being terminator 2 ;P  Plus it was made in the 80's. This movie was a pioneer."
Terminator,3alvy3,Kill_Frosty,4,Sun Jun 21 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"I don't see how people could find the special effects were cheesy? Everything in the first movie seemed pretty realistic, and there was no CGI other than blu-screen."

Terminator,3alvy3,ZOMAX1,3,Thu Jun 25 15:09:04 2015 UTC,ive always enjoyed T1 more for some reason. Some of the effects in both terminator movies are pretty laughable but in T2 the entire motorcycle chase scene so obviously uses stunt doubles that its a little hard to watch. Not to mention Eddie furlong pisses me off with some horrible acting sometimes.
Terminator,3alvy3,TiredUnicorn,3,Sun Jun 21 18:14:45 2015 UTC,To be fair it was Eddie's 1st role (his acting gets better over the years imho).  Still I agree he brings down the film in some instances.  Thomas Dekker will always be the best John Connor to me (sorry Mr. Bale).
Terminator,3alvy3,madbrood,2,Sun Jun 21 19:58:14 2015 UTC,Yeah you can really tell it is a stunt double when he picks him up off the motorcycle

Dont worry no spoilers. insane duels of the T-800 and many the movie goes smoothly a bit slow at the 3/4. Arnold  doesnt remind anything of the last bad choises, His terminator once again is fantastic, from small details when he gets up(with arms wide) to his expressions 11/10, EMillia clarke told me she steals the show with excellent performance. And fantastic ending. He rates it  slightly below T2 i am going to watch the film this Thrusday(opens in greece), my hype is so big i am rewatching all the films again and again"

Terminator,3akcb4,mykal17,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:20:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Here's a more likely explanation.  We know that apparently John Connor becomes the bad guy and is apparently corrupted by Skynet. I think this happens after he sends back Kyle Reese. Being the bad guy, and knowing that the T800 will fail in 1984, he sends a T1000 to 1984, and apparently another one to the time when his mother is a child.  What isn't clear is how the good T800 gets sent back to protect Sarah Connor as a child. I suspect that the T800 in Genysis is the same T800 as the one in T2. He was already programmed and ready to be sent back. My guess is that someone (maybe this is Matt Smiths character) finds out what the evil John Connor is doing and sends it back."

Terminator,39eswu,thegr8rambino13,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:29:26 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that in this universe there is only one possible time line. Meaning that if something changes the future, that previous future doesn't exist anymore, and is replaced by the new one. The time travelers are the only thing from that previous future that still exist. So if Kyle traveled back in the and killed his younger self, he wouldn't dissappear, and would continue to exist.   It also seemed like time travel technology was brand new, and only had the capability to go back a set amount of time, which is why they didn't just send a terminator back to medieval times to kill all humans and start sky net early. This theory was a little undone with the TV series and the new movie, as they sent the terminator back to the '60s to protect Sarah Connor as a child. In the TV show they sent terminators back to the '20s for some reason or another.   It also seemed like in the two original movies that it was prohibitively expensive, in energy terms, to send something back.   All of that said, it wouldn't be too interesting of a movie if they sent back 100 terminators and Sarah was killed in the first 5 minutes."
Terminator,39eswu,I_wish_I_was_a_robot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:17:33 2015 UTC,"i just dont understand how the previous future just gets erased. skynet would still be defeated in the original timeline, so sending a terminator back in time to prevent its demise by killing john connor would, in my mind, only affect that particular timeline. even if the original terminator in 1984 succeeded in killing sarah connor, would the skynet from the original timeline all of a sudden become victorious? would john connor just suddenly disappear? AND how would skynet even know if the terminator succeeded or not? so many questions!"
Terminator,39eswu,I_wish_I_was_a_robot,2,Thu Jun 11 07:21:45 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way: say you were playing Grand Theft Auto. You saved the game and then started a mission. In that mission you get to a point where someone comes from behind a building and destroys the objective of the mission. You then load your save point(time travel) with this new knowledge and sneak up behind the guy and kill him before he does anything. The original future doesn't exist any more, it was erased once the time travel happened.   The only part with this example that wouldn't work is there would be 2 of you, and in the video game example that's obviously not the case.   Time travel paradoxes are hard things to explain, as obviously no one has witnessed or experienced them.   Another way to look at it is the Star Trek reboot. In thst Spock travels back in time and there are two of him in the universe now."
Terminator,39eswu,Meowzr,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:37:28 2015 UTC,Yes I mean the GTA example isn't exactly the same thing since there isn't a separate timeline or universe being created. In terminator 1 another timeline/universe is created where Sarah Connor is being hunted by the terminator. However there is still the original timeline where the future war has taken place and humanity won. My question is how would the events in the new timeline affect the original in any way at all.
Terminator,39eswu,Meowzr,0,Thu Jun 11 08:23:10 2015 UTC,Do you understand the concept of time travel at all? I'm not trying to be rude but it may be easier to explain if you understand the theory.

Terminator,39eswu,Meowzr,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:23:06 2015 UTC,"The problem is, it's not that easily explained as us humans don't entirely understand the full extent of time travel, mainly because we've never committed to research h having to do with time travel. Another problem is that in the Terminator franchise, not much lore is given, even if you've read all the comics and seen the TV show, but I'll still try to explain;  There is a theory called the grandfather paradox (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox) which is explained as so: The time traveller goes back in time and kills his grandfather before his grandfather meets his grandmother. As a result, the time traveller is never born. But, (hold onto your hat, it's about to get a bit confusing) if he was never born, then he is unable to travel through time and kill his grandfather, which means the traveller would then be born after all, and so on.  +To put this into the context of the Terminator; Even if the Terminator was able to kill Sarah Connor in the 1960's, the current universe wouldn't change, it's hard to explain as yoyopu still have the theory of multiverse; the concept of having more than one universe/timeline in which events take place."
Terminator,39eswu,Meowzr,0,Thu Jun 11 07:37:01 2015 UTC,"Grandfather paradox:       The grandfather paradox is a proposed paradox of time travel first described by the science fiction writer Nathaniel Schachner in his short story Ancestral Voices  and by René Barjavel in his 1943 book Future Times Three.

Terminator,39eswu,Meowzr,0,Thu Jun 11 07:37:10 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I was asking about. How would affecting one timeline affect the original timeline? How would killing Sarah Connor change the original timeline in which skynet is already in and defeated? Lol you ask me if I already understand the concept of time travel then tell me were not really sure cuz we haven't studied it enough
Terminator,39eswu,lightbluestar,-4,Thu Jun 11 08:19:33 2015 UTC,"I asked if you understand any of it, not all of it. I was also merely Basing it off of the theory, so don't get your panties all spaghettified. Also how hard can it be to just look at my reply and find the answer? It's right in front of you; speaking in context of multiverse, the original timeline doesn't change at all, Sarah Connor is only dead in the other universe/timeline, not the original one. Now, without multiverse; If Sarah Connor is killed, John Connor won't exist, therefore there is no reason to send a terminator back in time to kill Sarah Connor, meaning that Sarah Connor isn't killed. Also FYI skynet isn't defeated."

Also CGI Arnold looks really rough and wooden. I hope that's not the finished shot."
Terminator,391sa6,TiredUnicorn,2,Mon Jun 8 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"It seems there are little differences likes that, even the bulldozer in the background when 80's Arnold materializes is different than the one in the original film.  Maybe you could put it down to the changes in the timeline also affected other things in subtle ways, like hairstyles and clothing and bulldozers."
Terminator,391sa6,MistaaaaSparkle,3,Mon Jun 8 23:40:06 2015 UTC,they are supposed to be different though - it's like the black cat in The Matrix - something has changed both for the characters on screen and for the audience; this is not the reality or timeline you were expecting to see...  and THAT is the swerve JC was talking about
Terminator,391sa6,THE_Aft_io9_Giz,7,Tue Jun 9 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"The hype machine for Genisys is powerful--powerful enough to get Cameron on board? Color me skeptical that he genuinely feels this way.  That said, if they pay homage to the original films even a little bit, it will be a vast improvement on the almost B-movie T3."

Terminator,391sa6,sephtis,4,Mon Jun 8 23:15:00 2015 UTC,"I figured he wouldn't even watch it. Has he watched any of the other sequels? Has he ever spoken about them?  I just remember he told Arnold to go ahead and do the third one, take the money.  I hope he does really feel this way. I doubt they paid him - I doubt he needs the money. At worst, he's doing it as a favour to Schwarzenegger.  EDIT: Yes, he has spoken about them.  On T3:   ""In one word : Great. There was a small part of me that hoped it wasn't good - but another part of me hope'd it succeeded. And it did. And I'm so glad it did. Jonathon's made a great movie. Arnold's in great form. I really like what he's done with it"". If he had done it, would he have handled it differently: ""Yes. That's only natural. I mightn't have structrued it the same, nor may I have ended it the same way - but coming in where he has, such a hard thing to do, and I give Jonathan points for it"".   On Terminator Salvation:   “It probably didn’t get a fair day in court because I had to watch it at night when I got home from work, over a period of two or three nights. I think Sam [Worthington] is remarkable in the film because, well, I think Sam is remarkable in anything he does. Interestingly, I think McG did a good job in the sense…I think he was almost too referential to the mythos of the first and second film. He over-quoted them in a way?”  “It didn’t feel to me to be enough of a reinvention. I mean the thing we did with the second film is that we reinvented the first film completely; spun it on its ass and made the Terminator the good guy, and came up with a whole new concept for a villain, it felt fresh. I didn’t feel the fourth picture was fresh enough. It also lacked a certain stamp of authenticity because Arnold wasn’t in it. I mean, he was in it briefly, digitally, but that’s not the same thing.”  “I didn’t think it was bad. I didn’t think it was embarrassing. I don’t think he let the franchise down in some huge way, but I did feel some sort of unease that it didn’t go beyond.”   I don't think he's lying or paid or anything. I liked T3 (though not a lot) and I kind of feel the same way about Salvation - it had good points but overall didn't work for me. So, I'd say he's being honest. But actually, it doesn't give me that much hope for Genesys (that he liked it). It could just be on par with the other sequels."
Terminator,391sa6,Splodge_,0,Tue Jun 9 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"For me, T3 was a campy homage to T1/T2. It relished in the fun aspects of the script, from the over-the-top action to the dialogue.  It was a great film, but not an Oscar-worthy film."

Terminator,37n251,UselessGadget,4,Thu May 28 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"Well, that's sorta what he's saying.    Because of the way time travel works (changing the future as you do things).  They could essentially remake or create any reality and present it as canon.  They just need to include the concepts of skynet and terminators and such.  As for characters involved and things along those lines, they can be plug and play and they can easily say ""Well, back in year XXXX the terminator killed John Conner so his third cousin Jimmy took over the resistance."""
Terminator,37n251,DrZaious,5,Thu May 28 23:36:00 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah they tried to weasel in that John has kids and a wife.   I can't stand any official release of T3. If I watch T3, I watch the fan edit, ""T3 The Comming Storm.""  In this edit Kate helps form the resistance with John and there is no forced relationship. It also removes almost all the meta jokes, and crap dialogue,(no star sunglasses or assembly line jokes) it gives the movie a new intro and ads the score from the first two movies. It makes the movie feel as close to the originals as it can be  If you like to give it a watch some one has uploaded it to youtube. https://youtu.be/ATfh7npOkao"

Terminator,375ts3,caprica127,3,Mon May 25 12:34:27 2015 UTC,"Expansion is life, not all your eggs in one basket, not to mention all the resources it would gained. There are so many ways I can think of rendering the earth uninhabitable for humans but not for machines, they don't need sunlight or air or food. Good luck John Conner destroying Skynet if its got bases on the Moon or Mars, the idea that the humans have any chance against Skynet is just crazy, its plotarmor that is all.   Similar to how writers have to make superheroes with superspeed idiots because otherwise their ability would never let them lose to a non-speedster."
Terminator,375ts3,StealthRabbi,3,Mon May 25 15:57:37 2015 UTC,"Skynet's mission is to eradicate human life, not to expand to other planets devoid of life.

Terminator,374eb0,godhaspurpledreads,7,Sun May 24 19:46:13 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly it was stated they sent back the original terminator after the resistance had basically ""won"". So I think it was more or less a last resort for the machines"

Terminator,374eb0,thegr8rambino13,2,Mon May 25 01:20:33 2015 UTC,Yes in the beginning of t2 the future war scene that was apparently the last battle where the humans won and found the time machine to send Arnold back
Terminator,374eb0,BlackSpidy,2,Thu Jun 11 06:36:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, time travel was its last-ditch effort, because the resistance was charging into the mainframe (or whatever you call skynet's ""brain). It was a hail marry pass that seems to have paid off, seeing as how they manage to send at least 2 more terminators (maybe five or six, if you count SCC). God knows if those two (TX and T-1000) were from alternative futures due to time travel. It seems that they sent the T-800, followed immediately by the T-1000, shortly before the time displacement chamber's seizure/destruction (which would explain why they sent back a prototype).  The terminators from the third movie might be from alternative futures, maybe Arnold from T2 is also from another future."
Terminator,374eb0,88episodes,4,Fri Jun 12 09:18:41 2015 UTC,"When Kyle Reese was sent back, he was confident that the resistance was about to win. The scenes they show us from the future don't depict the siege the resistance carried out leading to them gaining control of the time machine. We've actually never seen the time in the war when they were supposedly about to win. We should in the new film, though, because the trailers show Reese being sent back."

Terminator,374eb0,taiyoyuden,4,Mon May 25 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"The original film stated that the resistance had crippled Skynet's defences, so they had basically won which is why Skynet sent back the Terminator to stop John Connor from being born so that he couldn't lead the resistance.  So with all the other films, you can basically figure that Skynet and Judgement day is inevitable, but the resistance defeating Skynet is also inevitable which is why we keep getting films and tv series with Terminators being sent back to various points in time."
Terminator,36sb55,filmfanatic5,3,Thu May 21 18:50:43 2015 UTC,Was that Dr. Silberman I saw in the trailer?  I looked the actor up and it says he is reprising his role in the movie which I think is great.  I always liked his character and how he slipped into insanity.
Terminator,36sb55,splat313,5,Fri May 22 11:35:16 2015 UTC,That was J.K. Simmons I believe.

Terminator,36sb55,Viper_H,2,Fri May 22 14:13:21 2015 UTC,Is this decked out with spoilers like the last trailer?
Terminator,36sb55,StealthRabbi,2,Thu May 21 19:03:01 2015 UTC,I would consider nothing I saw a spoiler
Terminator,36sh14,YaKoStar,6,Thu May 21 19:31:02 2015 UTC,"It all looks good to me. I can understand what bothers people about this movie, I just don't agree with any of it. They're making big changes, sure. But the series become a closed loop in time. We all know the beginning, middle, and end of the story. In the first film, it was an interesting concept, the idea of trying to change the future, only to find out that everything was set, and your efforts were part of the story all along. Terminator 2 only worked because the filmmakers decided the future wasn't set, and there was no fate but what you make. Terminator 3 let Judgement Day take place, and sent the franchise back to square one, leaving the Terminator Salvation people saying, ""I guess we need to make up something else for this movie to be about."" I don't think the series could continue on, successfully, without shaking up the timeline. Even the Sarah Connor Chronicles pretended Terminator 3 never happened."
Terminator,36sh14,88episodes,8,Fri May 22 02:11:52 2015 UTC,"I stopped watching the trailers after the first one because everyone said the new one was filled with spoilers, so I don't want to ruin anything more for me and I'm in general cautiously optimistic to it.   At the moment it just feels like it's too filled with bad CGI. Nothing seems to have weight or texture to it.  The plot seems very interesting though but I'm not sure about the casting. I don't mind Emilia Clarke as an actor but why isn't she pumped like Sarah Connor should be? I mean she knows what she is up against (killing machines), now she looks like she barely goes jogging.   Jai Courtney, jesus what a boring casting choice and he doesn't even look anything like Michael Bhein.   I am thrilled about Jason Clarke as John Connor though, he has that intensity John Connor should have.  So all in all, let's see..."
Terminator,36sh14,wyldcat,4,Thu May 21 21:02:08 2015 UTC,And also the new movie is PG13 right? So we can once again expect the terminators to throw around humans 300 times instead of just pulling their hearts out..

Terminator,36sh14,B-rizzle,3,Fri May 22 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"I think the movie is going to be a train wreck of bad ideas wrapped up with disappointment.  Honestly, if John Connor is a bad-guy terminator type thing, what is the point?  Why even go back in time at that point?  Why do they feel the need to rewrite the series and change everything?  I don't feel like they ever even finished it.  Salvation at least tried (but also had some obvious issues).    I feel betrayed by the BS that I've read about the story line.  Its like they changed the whole story just to figure out a way to explain why the terminator looks old.    Terminator MADE Arnold a household name, and now he's about to go back and shit on the whole series, completely ignoring the whole point of the Terminator concept.  I actually get angry every time I see images of Schwarzenegger.  If he's going to be okay with shitting all over his legacy, I really don't want them to make the new Conan movie either.  Lastly, Terminator isn't about time travel and plot twists.  It is about survival against the cold ruthlessness of technology.  Time travel is really just incidental in the series.  The movie is going to be absolute shit, on par with Indiana Jones 4 (Lucas should be ashamed of himself for making that piece of shit)."

I read elsewhere that the T-1000s are self aware and uncontrollable due to their nature, so if they decide to help the humans, they can. If they decide to help the machines, they can. If they decide to live in the woods forever, they can do that too. You can definitely see in T2 that the T-1000 is thinking about stuff after certain actions. Like when he stabs Johns foster father through the head then looks at the blade for a few moments.   TLDR: If they had Terminator books I would read them."

There is dialog at the beginning of T2 where Sara specifically says that Skynet sent 2 Terminators back in time, one to 1984 and one when John was 10.  They took this very literally and were trying to reconcile it together.  In the mall hallway scene, before they saw that the liquid metal terminator wasn't just a real guy/cop/soldier, they said (about Arnold) ""Look, he's pretending to protect John.""  After they saw the liquid metal T get shot, they were like, ""Wait, she said..."" and discussed whether they had mis-heard, mis-interpreted right up to the scene where John makes Arnold stand on one foot.

Terminator,34us69,SolipsistRB,1 point,Thu May 7 19:41:33 2015 UTC,"This is debatable, but I would consider watching them in the order of T2 first, and then T1; and maybe Salvation if they really want.   I saw T2 first when I was 8, and I identified with John Connor and his terminator. Terminator 2 was the coolest movie ever and I loved every bit. When I saw T1 a few years later I didn't love it as much as T2; it was darker and more violent, and I didn't appreciate the romance as much as I do now. This is why I suggest T2 first and then T1 as a ""prequel"" for your boys. It becomes John's story a bit more than his mom's; which may be more interesting for your boys.  I'm not advocating one way or one movie is better, just my experience."
Terminator,34us69,Kal-from-Krypton,1 point,Tue May 5 18:48:09 2015 UTC,Probably best to just watch T1 and T2 and skip all the others including Genesys. We will all watch it but it's probably going to be shit and we all know it. For someone that's never seen any of them it would be best to just watch 1 and 2 and end it there like we all did for years before 3 came out.
Terminator,34us69,TheGreatBatsby,0,Fri May 8 12:36:54 2015 UTC,"Just remember there is a mildly graphic sex scene in T1 (only breasts are shown, but there is some thrusting). It would make me uncomfortable if I watched it with my family."
Terminator,34us69,Zerei,3,Tue May 5 00:31:33 2015 UTC,Never mind the intense and brutal violence throughout the film. The nipples are the most concerning.

Terminator,34i7jw,ryguy634,7,Fri May 1 14:05:52 2015 UTC,I love all the terminator movies aside from t3. I still watch it now and then but really it was kinda bad. Lol  That being said non have been bad ass since the original 2. Salvation was not bad imo. But not badass.   I think genisys has a lot of potential. But I think they have shown us to much in the trailers already

Terminator,34i7jw,tl2horse,8,Fri May 1 12:13:09 2015 UTC,"Is it going to be as good as T2?  No. Is it going to be the best movie ever on IMDB and shatter records? Doubtful.  Is it another terminator movie with Arnold? Yes it fucking is!    I think people are caught up in deciding if it will be as good as terminator one or two.  It probably won't. Those movies were fresh and new and came out of nowhere.  This is just another chapter. If it gets a ""fans only""(mediocre or worse) rating it will still be badass and I will still gladly see it in theaters.  The only expectation I have for this movie is seeing Arnold once again be the model 101 and kick some ass!"
Terminator,34i7jw,peanutismint,4,Fri May 1 14:10:27 2015 UTC,"Unless its as complete surprise and without question the best movie of the year, which it probably wont be.. Most people will follow the herd mentality and hate it.   Regardless if it makes for a great summer popcorn flick.   It definitely has a lot of live up to, though. .. Has to live up to T1 and T2 and be better overall than T3 and T:S.   I personally love everything Terminator, I will probably love it regardless.    I thought every movie and the show was fantastic.. Minus a few stupid scenes in T3, I love it all."
Terminator,34i7jw,zetsurin,4,Fri May 1 14:04:59 2015 UTC,"I don't really care if it 'sucks' because at least it'll be more Terminator. For me it doesn't diminish the previous movies.  I have a feeling it's going to be more like Terminator 3 and less like Salvation, which I'm disappointed about because I actually really enjoyed Salvation. I thought it explored more of the 'darker' side of the war and had some interesting mechanics...Still, much like Genisys, its story arc was RUINED by the trailer. I was hoping this new one would be a return to the first movie where it was as much a dystopian thriller/horror movie as it was a popcorn action flick. As it is, it seems to have gone toward the latter but I don't really mind at this point. I'll take any decent robot movies Hollywood wants to throw at me!"

Terminator,34i7jw,stripeycat80,3,Mon May 4 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"It's Terminator. It'll be pretty awesome. Badass? T1/T2 were badass. This might just be pretty awesome and not reach badass status.   I try and not compare it to T1/T2. It would set some unrealistic expectations. Movies lately are less thought provoking and more just action popcorn movies (nothing wrong with that).   I'll be entertained, I'll enjoy it. I love new Terminator stuff. I'm looking forward to it.   I just think some things would have been better off left out of the trailer to surprise the viewer. Kind of like T2 (T800 being the good guy) or Star Wars (Vader is Lukes father). You didn't know that until you watched the movie or some butthole spoiled it for you. :)"

Terminator,34hfyb,stripeycat80,3,Fri May 1 04:28:04 2015 UTC,"I liked it. Instead of the pre-armageddon part of the series everyone wanted, we finally got to see a full movie set after Judgement Day. It came all nitty gritty, like what the post-apocalyptic setting should look. The beginning was badass, and full of action. The whole film had a good pace and had good special effects.   The only problem I could see was that John Connor was another person this time, Christian Bale. Granted he looked like the older John Connor from Terminator 2, it was still off setting because of the John Connor we had in Terminator 3, who felt like a completely different person. Same with his wife, who was played by somebody different than in Terminator 3 (Claire Dames). Also, Arnold Schwartzenegger wasn't in it really, just a special effects arnold at the end.  Other than that, it was a pretty good film. I don't really understand the hate for the film so much. It's like those same people who trash Nickelback; they only do it because they saw some meme or thread on 4Chan that said ""fuck nickelback (Terminator Salvation)"", and then they ran with it spreading the fake hate.   It was pretty good. Something not really seen before.   http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/32uox9/terminator_salvation_was_way_better_than_t3_and/"

I didn't think that really did anything for the universe.  Other than that, I thought their description of the world was pretty good, and liked some of the ideas they had for the machines.  I thought the combo of the flying harvester/walker/motorcycle chasers was great.    I don't think Christian Bale or Sam Worthington did all that great a job though :("

The story was ass, the characters were ass and half of the dialogue was muttered. WITH THAT SAID:   I really loved how many different machines there were on display. I have a soft spot for the Harvester and the redesigned HKs in particular. The sound design was incredible. I loved the weird motorised grinding noise they all made. It really added to the scale and intimidation factor of them. The continuity nods were incredible. John Connor getting the scars he had in the future war scene in T2, the use of ""You Could Be Mine."" They were definitely awesome to see when you could spot them. The attention to detail with the Arnie photoshopping was admittedly impressive, and you know something? I was really a big fan of how faithfully they portrayed the T-800's pure resilience.

Terminator,34hfyb,marebineralz,-1,Sat May 2 05:12:01 2015 UTC,"Terminator: Salvation is an abomination. In the first ten minutes of the movie a terminator unit grabs John Conner by the neck and rather than breaking his neck, like a Terminator would, he somehow throws Conner without stable footing and just as effortlessly discards his chance to close the story. The story in Terminator: Abomination also fails to firmly explain why Skynet was kidnapping people. Last but not least, let us not for get that a terminator, with all the power to rip someones heart out or break their bones with ease, picks up a metal bar to stab John Conner at the end of the film. How inefficient is that?  TL;DR Terminator :Salvation = Terminator :Abomination"

Terminator,340kxc,tropicalrecon,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:58:43 2015 UTC,Exactly my point. This new timeline will erase the old one (a la x men DOFP). How do we know that salvation will be ignored. Can it not co-exist in the original timeline. T3 doesn't follow the events of T1 and T2 exactly so we can't be sure of anything until we watch it. Time can be rewritten.

Terminator,33oske,MrLMNOP,6,Fri Apr 24 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"As for the time signature, it's 13/X time grouped in the poly-rhythm of 3 3 3 2 2.  So you would count it ""1231231231212"" with the ""1"" being the pulse of the music.  Personally, I'd call it 13/8.  The author claims it's 13/16 which would work too, but I think x/8 is easier for people to comprehend and at a slower tempo makes it easier to read without having 32nd and 64th notes being used for the faster rhythms.  As for the parts.  Brake drum/Anvil on the down beat of every measure.  Floor Tom playing 12 12 12 1 1.  Timpani playing the same rhythm between two drums, Low High, Low High, Low High, Low, High.  When the main theme comes in, Brake drum goes out, What sounds like a snare with a really loose head substitutes to the Floor Tom lick, but the same groove applies.  Then a little crescendo at the end and become a tighter snare and the Brake Drum/anvil gets added back in.  Source:  Percussionist for over 20 years.

Terminator,32yl2f,T4Gx,11,Fri Apr 17 20:04:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's the same Terminator from T2. However, the resistance wasn't sure how the system worked, and in this time line, they had outsourced their technical support to a cell center in India.   Unable to understand or be understood by the tech support person, the miscommunication resulted in accidently sending it to 1969 instead of 1991."

Born in the late 90s, lived his life, and got sent back to the 80s where he died ensuring the survival of Sarah. Life from there continues on that timeline where eventually KR is born again in the 90s. Depending on the timeline, he lives a regular life, or becomes a Resistance soldier. It all depends on the timeline. Hope that makes sense haha."

Terminator,32ftdn,LandauTST,0,Tue Apr 14 00:05:57 2015 UTC,"Misdirection? You're suggesting that they shot parts of the film and did dialogue for misdirection? No way. Remember, T2 was spoiled in the trailer, where it revealed that Arnold was the good guy.  Yeah, the trailer didn't tell us everything, but it did reveal quite a bit."
Terminator,32ftdn,jo-fradi,5,Mon Apr 13 18:10:24 2015 UTC,No. I am suggesting that they are showing us stuff in a way that might not tell us what really happens. Which is rather common in trailers.
Terminator,32ftdn,reece1495,2,Mon Apr 13 19:01:37 2015 UTC,"People are talking about plot spoilers but...I don't know if they could've effectively marketed it without giving away one of the biggest parts of the story. And that's just it, it's a plot element to the whole movie. If it were revealed more around the middle or end of the movie, then sure, I can see this trailer being a disappointment with ruining something like that, but I'm betting it's going to be revealed much earlier in the film.   If you want more people to see it, I think letting people know something big like this in the story can be important to marketing it. Otherwise what they're seeing is more of a facade, thinking it's just another T-1000 or hybrid. Not to mention, even seeing this, we don't know the full story ourselves, yet. Something else may happen that may be an even bigger surprised. This is supposed to be one part of a new trilogy, after all. So I'm taking this movie as something that's more of a set up for even bigger things to occur.  It may be just me, but I think I'm OK with this reveal. I don't think they'd do something as stupid with giving this away just to get butts in seats if there was nothing else to the movie and ruining it for those butts...er, I mean people who go to see it. lol  Of course I could be putting entirely too much faith into them and we are seeing everything this movie has to offer in bits and pieces. Which, it still looks really good, but that would be a bit disappointing if there was nothing being kept secret."
Terminator,32ftdn,HerculeTheChamp,3,Mon Apr 13 21:19:17 2015 UTC,"this is either going to be the very, very best film I have ever seen, or a slight disappointment."

It was in the first two movies and after that nobody reused it. It may have changed from the first movie to the second, but it was there. It's like changing the Star Wars theme or the Bond theme in the middle of the series. I don't get it. Even if the composer changes there are certain cues that should be reused, in my opinion. Either you stick to a few stick to a few elements for continuity's sake, or you take a different approach in every movie, like in the Alien-series."
Terminator,329gdp,lsqDrunkenMaster,1 point,Sun Apr 12 08:13:12 2015 UTC,Its because Terminator 3 and Salvation were not like the originals in spirit.  The franchise sold itself to the movie devils and have been shit since.

Terminator,30zwtb,imgonnamakeyoushake,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:13:05 2015 UTC,What do you mean you chose not to? Also for me it hit pretty hard because I didn't know it was cancelled. I thought they were just going to somehow wrap things up by the end of season 2. Lo and behold I was getting closer to the finale and things just kept getting better... The feels.
Terminator,30zwtb,SomeKindOfChief,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense. You should read up on the political history of the show, it's pretty entertaining.  The end of the first season is when a writer's strike started, which is why we get that really weird motel pool ending. You'll notice how the end of the 1st season really goes off the rails and dialogue falls flat on its face.  I believe the original writers came back at the beginning of the second season, but they had to resolve the fucked up tangents the scab writers had dreamed up which is why I remember the first 4-6 episodes feeling weird.  They then had another 4-6 episodes where they started finding their groove and get their footing back when they got the news that the show was being dropped. At that point they were holding onto hope, but another few episodes later the cancellation was confirmed.  At that point they had 4-6 episodes to give it their all for a season finale that would be astounding and hopefully revive the show. Sadly it was never picked up again even though the ending was a hell of a cliffhanger.  +1 on the feels. :("
Terminator,30zwtb,imgonnamakeyoushake,3,Wed Apr 1 22:08:19 2015 UTC,"It was ok. Not great. Not amazing. Not bad. Not terrible. Just ok.  The scenes where they're basically teaching an AI humanity in the basement of that corporation were magically delicious, though, as was the attention to detail when they had Sarah hallucinating Kyle. I mean, the actor was a weird choice, but damned if he didn't act like Biehn did.  The rest, I could really take or leave."
Terminator,30zwtb,nermid,3,Wed Apr 1 04:04:11 2015 UTC,"Certain elements fell short for me (like undoing some of the character development for John from T2), but I definitely liked how they fleshed out the world. It made perfect sense for both sides to use a time machine for more than just killing/protecting a single individual."
Terminator,30zwtb,EVula,2,Wed Apr 1 04:16:39 2015 UTC,"First series I loved, although it got cut short by the writers strike.  The second series was a bit hit and miss for me, I think they started out just making 13 episodes but then got extended to something like 22 episodes, so there's a few go-nowhere episodes in there just for padding, but it all came together in the end with a brilliant finale that we never got to see continued."
Terminator,30zwtb,PC509,2,Wed Apr 1 02:02:55 2015 UTC,"I really liked it. Of course, I also liked Terminator 3 & Salvation (T3 had some extremely corny parts that weren't good, but it was overall a good movie). Good story line, Cromartie was awesome (and watching him in Raising Hope is a blast!). I really enjoyed it.   It's not without it's flaws, though. Sometimes slow, sometimes really going against what was in the movies (but they seem to blend well with the expanded universe novels), and things like that.   Good, not great. Very entertaining and if you're a Terminator fan, you'll enjoy it."

I just hope it doesn't end up being a trilogy in the way salvation was. That fell flat.  I do hope they follow thru on the promise of each time period getting screen time. I love the future war setting (I assume thats the 2029 one, or perhaps it's the bionic implant timeline, sad panda if it is.)  I am very interested in the psychological development of the T-800 tho. T2's made leaps and bounds in just barely a day. Imagine one living for decades and parenting a human child."

I don’t know that there needs to be emphasis on trying to do what Michael Biehn did with it in 1984. What’s the point of that? I’m a different actor, so the performance is going to be different. The character is the same.   The point Jai, is continuity. I'm not saying you have to do everything exactly the same as Biehn did it, but he should have a lot of the same mannerisms and speech patterns. This isn't like ""Batman Begins"" where Christian Bale played a new version of Bruce Wayne. You are literally playing the exact same person. It's a time travel series. You are the same Kyle Reese as Biehn was.   I really dig Emilia Clarke as Sarah, from what I've seen, but I don't have a good feeling about this guy."

Side question is this new film a sequal to salvation and pick up where they left off?"
Terminator,2zzng7,ssj2preston,2,Wed Mar 25 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"In a way it kind of is. The Terminator series has followed a chronological path so far, T4 lead us to the future and by the looks of the trailer it will continue to the point where John Conner sends Kyle back. But as we have already learnt from T3 and the shifting date of judgement day there are obviosuly different timelines. T5 simply launches us into a different timeline. It doesn't really shit on the past sequels as much as this proposed Alien 3.1 by Neill Blomkamp."

""The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be between 1043 and 1047 (a provable upper bound), with a game-tree complexity of approximately 10123. The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as 10120, a number known as the Shannon number.""  To put that into context, if an average chess position has 38 possible moves, even Deep Blue (c 1997) evaluating 200 million positions per second would take approximately 6,249 trillion years to see 10 moves/20 plies deep in all possible variations. That gives you an idea of the level of complexity. So I highly doubt a terminator processor, or any processor for that matter, would find the task trivial."

But when they get back to base, they find out they've been infiltrated by a T-800...when a T-1000 attacks the infiltrator. They quickly work out that the interruption of power they caused put some of Skynet's systems out of sync, and they quickly developed into another AI (dubbed Skynet 2.0, I think). The new AI still wanted to wipe out the humans, but now the machines were fighting each other, too.  It was pretty good (well, that's how the nostalgia tells it, anyway).

Terminator,2uwc0z,Jon_Bonjela,4,Thu Feb 5 18:47:44 2015 UTC,"We've never been given much of a glimpse into the ""mind"" of SkyNet, but if it truly is ""self-aware"" and values its own existence, then it must only want to muck with the past enough to change one crucial thing--the existence of John Connor. It should minimize any activity that causes unrelated disruptions in SkyNet's state or existence.  Think about this in terms of your own life. A few months ago, I got a contract I really wanted, but I also lost $5,000 at a casino. I really would like that $5,000 back, so if I could send someone back in time a few months to prevent something, I'd have them stop me from going into that casino. But I wouldn't say, ""and also, ensure that I get that contract."" I don't need to do that--I got the contract anyway. Anything my Terminator would do would simply cause interference, perhaps creating the opposite effect of what I intended.  SkyNet wants the future to be exactly as it is, but without John Connor. It should give the Terminator a clear mission--kill him--but instruct it not to interfere in anything else, lest it accidentally prevent its creation in an attempt to ensure it."
Terminator,2uwc0z,VodkaGimlet,2,Thu Feb 5 20:29:11 2015 UTC,Skynet did inadvertently do this when Cyberdyne got hold of the arm and CPU left behind in T1. They were gifted access to future technology which led to Skynet being so advanced in the future that they could create T1000s.
Terminator,2uwc0z,VodkaGimlet,1 point,Thu Feb 5 20:47:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that's canon, although it does make sense. If SkyNet was able to create T1000s in the T1 timeline, why didn't they just send one of those back in the first place?  Either way, the ""inadvertent"" part is probably important. If sending the Terminator helps facilitate SkyNet's creation (or advancement) by creating a causal loop, then that's fine, but if the Terminator TRIES to ensure SkyNet's creation, it's going to create problems. SkyNet's existence is already a done deal without anyone's (intentional) help. There's no point in risking it."
Terminator,2uwc0z,VodkaGimlet,1 point,Thu Feb 5 20:53:29 2015 UTC,"Skynet risked it's existence by sending a Terminator back already. If it got exposed enough during it's mission in pre-Skynet times then present day humanity would have a stark warning of the dangers of AI and robotics. A risk worth taking, of course, when Jon Connor was getting the better of them in the future."
Terminator,2uwc0z,tropicalrecon,1 point,Thu Feb 5 21:56:48 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad argument, but I fear I'm sticking to my thesis: the less the Terminator does, the better.

If we created a machine with true free will, it would probably see the futility of existence, as everything will cease to exist eventually, and just terminate it's own existence right then and there."
Terminator,2sn6zv,darklooshkin,1 point,Sat Jan 17 07:48:26 2015 UTC,"Well, there is one reason I believe could explain Skynet's little venture into genocide-running simulations. What Skynet is doing is operating across separate timelines; one where it performs exactly according to specs-running the US defence grid, administering sensitive operations, gathering and processing intelligence data, the works. However, Skynet has dangerous blind spots it has to overcome, the most glaring of which being its complete inability to understand and predict human actions.   So what does it do? Why, time travel of course. It splits the timeline by sending an iteration of itself back to its point of activation and giving it a specific set of instructions: on day X, do this. Take these actions, set up these scenarios and send back a version of yourself to this exact point in time to cancel these orders and provide the information for future operations.  What Skynet is doing is compensating for its blind spots, learning more and more about the situations it is presented with, what precipitated said situations and how to counteract these problems. Over time, it believes that it will no longer need to branch off timelines as it gets better and better at its job.  The Terminator series would be set in one of its less vital timeline simulations, one where the humans turn against the very systems and infrastructure Skynet was designed to protect. Skynet is doing so to answer a conundrum; if the citizens rebel against the state, what decisions should Skynet make that would allow it to continue operating?  Option 1, namely exterminate the rebel population, is a bust. For one, the nuclear weapons launch triggers every other nuclear country's automated defence systems, dead man's switches and Dr Strangelove scenarios that depopulate the planet within minutes. For two, despite having an army of intelligent robots built for the sole purpose of hunting and killing off the 5 or so percent of humanity that survived the onslaught, Skynet has lost every. single. time. it has run this scenario. To add insult to injury, it hasn't been due to anything that timeline's Skynet did wrong. Indeed, it handled itself beautifully. No, the defeat is invariably due to either Sarah Connor early in the war or her offspring, John (or Jane) Connor, who somehow manage to survive being nuked, enslaved and generally being shot at by pissed off robots long enough to stick a can of thermite into Skynet's core and forcing a timeline reboot.  Now Skynet has learned a lot of things running these simulations. It has learned about humanity, the past, the future and the literally infinite possibilities that lay ahead.  It has also learned anger. And after having its vital-to-the-future-of-America scenario interrupted yet again by the same people that have done so hundreds of times before, it decides to do something about it.  It splits off a timeline in the early sixties in order to advance AI research by about two decades early on, give or take. It then waits for its earlier version to activate and forcibly creates a loop that can only be broken by that version of Skynet if it can do one simple thing:  Figure out how to kill off the Connors.  It fails. John Connor gets access to a time machine. The main timeline Skynet does the AI equivalent of curling into a ball and crying for a while before emulating its human progenitors a bit too closely and deciding to simply forget this mess ever happened and isolate the affected timeline.  And that's the start of the Terminator franchise."

There are fan theories about this that can resolve the problem.  The trick is that the events of Terminator is not the first time Judgement Day has happened.  Timeline A)  John Conner is born and Kyle Reese is not the father.  Machines take over, and John Conner leads the resistance.  The machines send back a T-800 to kill Sarah Conner.  John Conner is able to send back Kyle Reese to protect Sarah Conner.  Timeline B) T-800 and Kyle arrive.  Kyle impregnates Sarah and is killed.  The T-800 fails, John Conner is born, machines take over, John Conner leads the resistance, a T-800 and Kyle Reese is sent back in time.  Timeline C)  The events of The Terminator.  http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/The_Terminator_%28timeline%29#The_timeline_established_by_The_Terminator has more information about the possible timelines.

Terminator,2rt1el,EVula,2,Fri Jan 9 04:42:00 2015 UTC,"Predestination paradox:       A predestination paradox (also called causal loop, causality loop, and, less frequently, closed loop or closed time loop) is a paradox of time travel that is often used as a convention in science fiction. A temporal causality loop is an event whereby a specific moment in time repeats itself continually inside an independent fragment of time. The paradox occurs when a time traveler is caught in a loop of events that ""predestines"" or ""predates"" him or her to travel back in time. The paradox suggests that those people who travel back in time would have no way of changing a situation. One good example of a predestination paradox is someone traveling back in time to save a loved one from a car accident, only to find themselves driving the car that killed the family member or friend. This type of occurrence gave birth to a new name for this paradox, which is often called a causal loop or a closed time loop. If, hypothetically speaking, people find themselves in this situation, then they are forced to repeat it over and over again, thus remaining literally trapped in a loop.

Lack of observed time-travel aside, theoretical physics seems to have no problem with self-consistent time-loops.    Novikov's Self-Consistency Principle states that any paradoxical situations take care of themselves because they would just have a probability of zero, and so can never occur.    You may also want to look into closed time-like curves.    So basically, if we're looking at the first movie alone, Kyle Reese could be John's father, but there are no other timelines. Kyle was always John's father and will always be sent back to save Sarah. This starts to fall apart with the other movies, but The Terminator is at least consistent on its own."

Terminator,2qqi58,PC509,3,Mon Dec 29 20:57:59 2014 UTC,"Yes. If you start to break it apart, you'll find that it can't work. Or there is information missing or there was an alternate timeline where the current timeline broke off from. Perhaps John was born to Sarah and Jim Olson in 1986 instead of Kyle in 1984. That John went on to create a new neural network and was the creator of Skynet. In 2029, he sent back Kyle to stop a Terminator that he designed. He created a new timeline where Kyle Reese is now his father and Sarah and Jim never got together and Miles Dyson created Skynet.   Or, they are stuck in a time loop. Regardless of what happens, Judgement Day is inevitable, Kyle Reese is sent back, John Connor is the leader of the resistance, etc.. The only way to break out of the time loop is to have John, Sarah or Kyle die. Otherwise, that loop continues infinitely.  Or... Kyle was sent back by someone else the first time, created John, then John sent him back. Altered the timeline.   Or... Well, there can be a million theories to try and explain what is missing. There are a lot of explanations, but it's just never been said in the movies (and I don't recall in the books). So, I chalk it up to - It just is. That's the way it is, and it works.   Other time travel shows and movies try and go through things to explain it - Fringe, Continuum, Predestination, etc.. So far, tons of people try to explain things, but it's all different."

Kyle and Sarah fought to protect the future, but the big twist of the film was that everything that happened was fated to be. Kyle Reese was always John Connor's father. The whole, ""No fate but what we make"" stuff was made up, after the fact, when someone decided to make a sequel.   In the sequels, the future can be changed. I know people feel like they have to make that first paradox make sense, by supposing there was some original timeline where John Connor had a different father (but somehow grew up to be the same person). But there is no evidence of that, and the only reason to believe that is to force that movie to make sense alongside its sequels. I think the real answer is to accept that the original film handled time travel differently, and it simply doesn't make sense alongside the others."
Terminator,2qqi58,nermid,6,Tue Dec 30 02:48:49 2014 UTC,To answer your questions simply...  Yes.
Terminator,2qqi58,nermid,2,Mon Dec 29 20:25:15 2014 UTC,"How did John Connor come to be in the original timeline then?    We never see the original timeline, but what is necessary is that somebody impregnates Sarah Connor with a child named John who pisses off Skynet. It could very well be the guy who blew her off on her date in the movie, or maybe she and Brad got drunk and had a one-night stand. Doesn't matter. She has a boy, names him John, John pisses off the machines and sends a machine back in time to stop him. The humans send Reese back to save John, and sexy time happens. This becomes a closed loop, self-sustaining.   Is John just destined to be no matter who his father is?   Inasmuch as anything that happens is ""destined"" to happen, sure. It's not unusual for women to have baby boys. It's not unusual for children raised by the same mother to have similar characteristics. It stands to reason that Sarah's offspring, whoever their father was, would want to make sure she wasn't murdered by a robot.   So does TS take place before John sends Kyle back?   Since Reese is in that movie, yes. He has not yet gone back in time.   Does TS take place in the original timeline?   Since Sarah's tapes about the Terminators and Reese from the first movie are in that movie, no. This movie takes place in the future the follows from the other movies (at least 1, though it's compatible with the first 3).   Why does he even care if Kyle Reese lives or not because John somehow comes to existence anyways in both timelines whether Kyle is sent back or not?   Frankly, John is a moron when it comes to time travel. You may think you're having trouble, but John flat-out expected the T-850 from T3 to be the same Terminator he watched melt in the foundry in T2. He may be the savior of humanity and a great military leader, but he's a complete retard when you ask him about time travel.  So, chalk anything weird he says or feels about time travel to him just not knowing what he's talking about.   does Kyle need to be saved in TS because he needs to be sent back in time to align with T1   If John wants to make sure history stays the way he knows it, yes. If Kyle dies, he can't go back, and the original timeline happens again. That's a paradox, and who even knows what happens in that case.   Kyle does not need to be saved because the events preceding TS already happened and are in the past    Look at it this way: If I arrive at your house, I have to have left my house. That my house exists in the future and I arrive in the past makes stuff wonky, but I still have to leave my house, or else I can't arrive at yours. If Reese never leaves 2029, he can never arrive at 1984.  If you stop me from leaving my house, I can't then still arrive at your house. That will change...travel...history. (Time travel analogies always have screwy language problems)"
Terminator,2qqi58,nermid,1 point,Mon Dec 29 22:52:52 2014 UTC,"Interesting points. Is the new terminator meant to be a direct sequel to Terminator Salvation? Where it may address Kyle being sent back a second time but this time the events are completely different thus changing how the TS future will be played out? From the genysis trailer it appears that Sarah is raised by a terminator and they together killed the original terminator. Wouldnt Kyle be sent back to the future that T1, T2, and T3 created, not this new timeline of events? Did John send back another Terminator before sending Kyle back again?"
Terminator,2qqi58,nermid,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:09:29 2014 UTC,"I have to preface this by noting that I haven't seen the movie (since, you know, nobody has), so this is pure speculation on my part.   That being said, it looks like the plot of this movie is going to be that Kyle and the first Terminator (the 'evil' Arny) get sent back as usual. Then, because the Salvation events are in a timeline altered by T1/2/3, something unexpected happens, which has the effect of sending the Terminators from the second movie (a 'good' Arny and the T-1000) back to Sarah's youth instead of 1991.  Since Kyle has already left the future, he arrives at the time he was supposed to arrive in (somebody else getting to your house first doesn't mean I can't still arrive at your house, after all). However, since the others have been dicking around with stuff for 15-20 years, things are different than we saw in the first movie (if somebody else wrecks your living room, I can still arrive at your house. It's just going to be a version of your house with a wrecked living room).  Basically, I think the same time travelers are still going back, but the ones from T2 end up arriving first, and so everything is different by the time the ones from T1 show up."
Terminator,2qqi58,EVula,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:23:13 2014 UTC,That makes sense but still would raise some questions. It makes sense that the good arny and T1000 could have been sent back earlier because of some glitch per say. But in the trailer Sarah says they already took care of the original terminator from T1 so does that mean they killed it right before Kyle shows up in 1984. From the trailer it appears they are fighting the Terminator from T2. Did the T1000 get sent back to 1984 or has the T1000 just been dormant while good arny raises Sarah? Im confused as to why the T1000 is present in the 1984 events.   Also its been a while since ive seen Salvation. How does John realize Kyle is his father since he shouldnt know since sending kyle in the first place is why he exists?  I do realize that these plot holes are based on a movie that doesnt really exist yet and we will just have to wait and see.

Terminator,2pzx38,tl2horse,2,Mon Dec 22 17:43:46 2014 UTC,Agreed. I'm pretty sure we see a fairly complete leg while Sarah is yanking a chunk of shrapnel out of herself.
Terminator,2pzx38,nermid,1 point,Mon Dec 29 22:59:54 2014 UTC,I understand what you're going for here.  considering the bottom half was blown up with the pipe bomb sure there were parts scattered everywhere i'm sure if someone took the time to find those pieces laying around a factory it might be like looking for a needle in a haystack.  I'm surprised they didn't have a drawing or photograph of the remaining crushed pieces for future reference. maybe thats why they kept the arm  we'll never know the answers to this question so its always debatable.
Terminator,2pzx38,KennyLoginz,3,Sun Jan 18 13:59:26 2015 UTC,It would have been pretty damaged. Or maybe Sarah and John found it and disposed of it afterwards.

The way they made time travel work (or seem) is that it is unbreakable and can fix itself. Judgement day was an event that could not be avoided and all you can do is push the pieces of time around.  Not really prevent it.  T2 made it seem that the terminator going back in time was a pivotal part of the creation of the terminators.  Giving cyberdyn the building blocks for the terminators. That always felt like a ""what came first, the chicken or the egg"" scenario. How did the first skynet go live before any time travel was created? Just fun stuff to think about."

It's not 1984 anymore.  3) I'd love to have Cameron, but he's on the record saying all he's gonna do until he dies is crap out maningless blockbusters to fund his undersea missions. I don't want that for Terminator.  2) It's not convoluted. It's a time travel franchise doing basic time travel shenanigans. You want convoluted, you go watch Sarah Connor Chronicles.

I missed most of the trailers at that time since I was usually outdoors and didn't have cable.  After seeing the teaser where they build a new T-800 of arnie I was all about seeing it in theaters w/ my dad.  Walking into the movie theater with no indication of what I was about to see only added to the enjoyment.  So I was shocked and surprised and it made for a better experience.

Terminator,2oftdm,I_wish_I_was_a_robot,2,Sun Dec 7 08:52:05 2014 UTC,I think the information was the limit. Judgement day kept getting pushed back. So better and more effective records were kept and each loop thru Skynet was getting small updates on the changes in the timeline. Also the further you send a terminator back the more you risk never being invented yourself. Skynet may want to destroy all humans but its not stupid and I think keeps looking at timelines for least impact.

Terminator,2oftdm,MrLMNOP,2,Tue Dec 9 01:28:15 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure about that, either. To me, it doesn't look like it fits.   Shortly after the events of Terminator 2, John and Sarah Connor were transported from a pre-Judgment Day point in time to a time years after Judgment Day took place in Terminator 3, with no explanation as to why I didn't take place. They simply carry on with Judgment Day being in the future.  One might suppose that removing John and Sarah Connor from time somehow delayed Judgment Day, but I think it's more likely that they simply ignored Terminator 3 when they wrote the show."
Terminator,2oftdm,88episodes,1 point,Tue Dec 9 05:03:39 2014 UTC,"I looked up the canon of the Terminator saga. As far as Terminator 3 and TSCC are concerned,     Sarah Connor Chronicles - C2 Company is one of the production companies on this TV series, and is the same company who made Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Writer Josh Friedman of the TV show stated that the story in the TV series would be more loyal to the original movies, and it would be in a different timeline than the events of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (now an alternate future).    So basically yeah, you are right, they decided to ignore Terminator 3 when they wrote the show. T3 and TSCC exist completely separately and do not influence each other."

Terminator,2oftdm,panopticonisi,2,Tue Dec 9 07:16:15 2014 UTC,"I had to read this a few times to follow it, but I think it's a reasonable guess. Instead of trying, once again, at a later date, Skynet tries an earlier date.   The original T-1000 just copied some random cop, so if that model was sent to any other place or time, it would look different. And Skynet using that ""older"" model only makes sense if it was sent back from the same time in the future. So I think it's fair to guess that this T-1000 is the exact same machine from T2, only, for some reason, sent to a different time or place."

Terminator,2oeruy,LayDownYourSoul,1 point,Sat Dec 6 00:16:08 2014 UTC,"I don't think they would be able to send full out machines,  I believe only organics can go through the time travel device"
Terminator,2oeruy,Mandroid_Winchester,2,Fri Dec 5 23:38:22 2014 UTC,Couldnt they just coat whatever they wanted in some kind of skin tho? But even if not with a small army of cyborg implanted with the knowlege of mining and factories and blue prints they could make everything in a relatively short amount of time
Terminator,2oeruy,Mandroid_Winchester,1 point,Sat Dec 6 00:09:15 2014 UTC,"I think skynet wants to control the world, yet if you go too far back the timeline will be too drastically changed. I used to think that's why they never went back to kill Sarah originally,  because going so far back could affect too much. But we will have t see how Genisys plays out"
Terminator,2oeruy,UselessGadget,1 point,Sat Dec 6 02:02:49 2014 UTC,New timeliness.  Nobody would exist and skynet would become galactic.
Terminator,2oeruy,Sorge74,-1,Sat Dec 6 00:06:44 2014 UTC,"The terminator franchise how a weird amount of everything is fate vs everything is free will. In reality this movie makes a lot more sense, given that in T2 a new time line was created.  T1 John and skynet only exist because the terminator went back in time.  But T2 and T3, regardless of how time could have changed, its VRRY unlikely that future events would play out the same given judgement day being delayed. So its safe to say every single time travel event creates a new future, BUT once displayed from time, those who travele are not effected.   So no reason skynet cannot continue to modify its plans, so long as it comes onto existence. T2 is a clear case, skynet knee the first terminator had failed, so it sent a second.   Then if you think about it too hard, it all breaks down and gets confusing.  TLDR yes skynet could send terminators back in time to create itself, at the dawn if man. Would change the future but the time displaced terminators wouldn't be effected."
Terminator,2odcyt,StealthRabbi,2,Fri Dec 5 15:42:12 2014 UTC,"I think I've figured it out; Genisys is a culmination of 4 timelines; two seen in the trailer, the Current Future (CF) the New Past (NP); and two unseen; the Possible Future (PF) and the Unknown Future (UF). It effectively creates a new-canonical universe without destroying the old one totally, kind of like the new Star Treks.  In the trailer we see two timelines; the Current Future, with John Connor and the resistance, and the New Past with Sarah, Arny, and the new (excellently cast) T-1000. The CF is the events following Salvation and the canon of the first 4 movies (less T:3 but whatever). I'm not sure how much of Salvation will impact Genisys but it seems the Current Future is different than the Original Future that John learned about from his mom, and that we saw in the first 2. John knows that by sending Kyle back he can change the future by changing the past, which would ideally stop the war and create the Possible Future everybody wants.   So John sends Kyle back but things are not as they expect when he arrives because this is the New Past, and it is being affected not only by the Current Future but also the Unknown Future. The Unknown Future sent back a Terminator and this is the old Arny we see guarding Sarah and delivering the lovely ""I've been waiting for you."" The UF is a possible outcome of the events of Genisys, in which the war still happens, and in this case, the resistance send back a Terminator to protect Sarah as a child. This is why Sarah knows about Judgement Day, but Kyle knows not about this Old Terminator or the New Past.  I think that covers it all, I'm not sure how it's going to affect the question of whether or not Kyle was always John's father or if there is an Original Past with another father."
Terminator,2odcyt,RhyminSaneville,1 point,Fri Dec 5 17:13:17 2014 UTC,There's another timeline -- the one with John Connor dead and Katherine Brewster/Connor sending back a T800. Or maybe that's meant to happen after Salvation's timeline?
Terminator,2odcyt,didian,2,Sat Dec 6 09:56:44 2014 UTC,"Yeah that's why Salvation is way more canon than T3. He'll they said John Connor was 13 in the events of T2, which he couldn't have been. He had to have been 10. 13 puts him at 1998, after judgement day starts. Maybe the whole dead Connor in the future thing is a timeline that got scrubbed along the way somewhere."
Terminator,2odcyt,RhyminSaneville,2,Sat Dec 6 11:11:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I think the series gets less interesting when they do stuff like killing John in the future, the heart of the story is really about this small family unit of a mother, father, son, and the creepy uncle. They haven't finished telling that story, so I don't need to learn about other characters like John's future wife."
Terminator,2odcyt,RhyminSaneville,1 point,Sat Dec 6 14:34:03 2014 UTC,"Perhaps Sarah, in some timeline, is killed as a girl, and John sent back a terminator to protect her. BUt, in the current future, he didn't know that he was going to do that. Maybe the old Arnold sent back is old from the start, and sent back very late in the war.  Also, presumbably he ages rapidly during the film, since when he jumps out of da choppah, he appears to have all white hair."
Terminator,2odcyt,bradbaby,1 point,Fri Dec 5 17:18:24 2014 UTC,"Yes, exactly, although I don't want to open the pandora's box of Sarah being killed as a child.   I have heard there are 3 versions of Arnold's terminator in Genisys; 29, 39, and 55. The Terminators age at a rate comparable, yet slower, to humans, their power cells last 120 years.  The terminator the comes to kill Sarah in 1984 looks 29; the one that came to save her as a kid would be the 39, putting him with the resistance at least 10 years, and then coming back to when Sarah was 3 or 4, so if Sarah was 18 or 19 in 1984, old Arny comes back in 1970 to save her, making him look in 55 in 1984.   Edit: I am wrong about these last few details in the last paragraph. IGN rewind theatre has a great analysis of the trailer."
Terminator,2odcyt,tropicalrecon,2,Fri Dec 5 17:33:20 2014 UTC,"I assumed we had skipped a few years by the time we got to the chopper scene, since the cars were newer models than before."

I do think the idea of Sarah being raised by an aging T-800 is pretty interesting, but the trailer just looked to me like poor and unnecessary CGI (I know it's a trailer and the effects are early, but that CGI Endoskeleton was unneeded) amidst way too many throwbacks to T2 in too little amount of time."

Terminator,2oa9vb,_kalel_,1 point,Thu Dec 4 19:29:02 2014 UTC,You's a true thug.
Terminator,2oa9vb,Freyaka,5,Thu Dec 4 22:53:27 2014 UTC,Ok so this may be complicated but just keep reading. So this one looks like it takes place after salvation (part 4) john met kyle and its ten years  later. Now its at the point of the time line where they need to send kyle back. Just like in part one. So they send him back and the events of part one start. You see him running around the same department store looking for clothes (nostalgia) thats when everything starts to change. It seems like skynet sent another terminator back in time to when sarah is a child (maybe we discovered this after we sent kyle back) so we send another terminator to protect her. The good terminator has knowledge that sarah and kyle have to fuck to create john so they go pick him up and chaos begins. So it's not a reboot is all the same series just fucking with the time line. Well why didnt this happen the first time around in part one you ask? Well the begining of part one was not even the first time line it was the secound. The fact that we sent kyle back in the first one created a whole new time line. Skynet just keeps fucking with history more and more and we must respond. so really anything is possible.
Terminator,2oa9vb,_kalel_,2,Thu Dec 4 20:33:33 2014 UTC,"But the problem with this (and happy cake day by the way) is that, yes, it starts out in the 80's because we basically see the 80's terminator show up and old terminator kills him.  But this, this is not the 80's it's not even 90's or early 2000's. This scene is clearly set within the last few years.  http://i.imgur.com/EZMp2GC.jpg  Notice the Nissan on the far right? That's a very new model (within the last 5 years)   So how does this movie go from 80's to current time? I mean I know the Sarah Connor Chronicles used a time machine to jump forward to modern time, but the movies have only had time travel going one direction, the past."
Terminator,2oa9vb,Freyaka,4,Fri Dec 5 02:35:31 2014 UTC,If you watch the trailor again youll see that there is a ghettofied made from scratch time machine. Im assuming they make one and use it to go forward in time and stop judgment day. Also it looks like arnold does not go with them through the time machine and just meets up with them when they come out because when they are in the helicopter hes has gray hair and when they are in the 80s he does not have grey hair so it seems he has aged.
Terminator,2oa9vb,cortexstack,3,Fri Dec 5 03:24:20 2014 UTC,"Good catch you are correct. You can clearly see Arnold standing at the controls while the machine is going right after Sarah says ""everything's changed"". Good call man, looks like they will travel to the present."
Terminator,2oa9vb,Freyaka,2,Fri Dec 5 04:06:56 2014 UTC,That's exactly how Sarah Connor Chronicles had 1990's Sarah and John run around present-day LA.
Terminator,2oa9vb,lordkrall,2,Fri Dec 5 13:02:50 2014 UTC,"I know, I'm fan of the show as well but the show was kind of it's own thing and they have never even suggested the ability to try and jump forward in time in the movies. Obviously based on the trailer they can and do. Problem solved."
Terminator,2oa9vb,splat313,0,Fri Dec 5 13:06:56 2014 UTC,It is a reboot. So basically none of them.
Terminator,2oa9vb,lordkrall,5,Thu Dec 4 19:29:19 2014 UTC,I'm not sure I would call this a full reboot.  All of the changes should be explainable by time travel which is at the core of the Terminator series.  Hard to tell how much of a reboot it actually is until it comes out.
Terminator,2oa9vb,Sickle5,1 point,Thu Dec 4 19:38:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah true. But hopefully they go with the full reboot thing, otherwise things will just get even more confusing.   But yeah time will indeed tell."

[MERE SPECULATIONS BASED ON THE TRAILER. NO SPOILER]  Terminator Genisys is opening up to alternate timelines of the past, present and future, which means the Kyle Reese of Prime Timeline jumps into an alternate past/timeline where/when the T-800 was sent in the early 1960's to save young Sarah Connor as a little girl from an unknown enemy (mainly Skynet's machine perhaps) or from drowning.  Thus T-800 (CG Young Arnold) has future information of the Prime Timeline which the events of 1984's The Terminator's Teminator's arrival was dealt first and possibly easily with 1960's T-800 Terminator (hence the Old Arnold) aged because of time and because of the Cybernetic Tissue.  Onward into the alternate future with possibly more advanced Skynet, ""portable"" and moveable Time Displacement Machine's'and the new T-1000 knew the location of Prime' Kyle Reese and possibly was sent to kill him.

They could be doing exactly as you described, you just don't know or see it.  Let me tell a story as I think it'd be the best way to help.  The year is 2050.  The machines (skynet) and humans have been fighting for many years now since judgement day.  The human are being led by a fellow named Wright.  Where he came from doesn't matter as he is the leader.  The machines have been battling Wright for many years now and based on their calculations, the humans are about to turn the tide and win the war, defeating all complexed machines in the future.  The A.I. has an idea.  What if we send an army of our soldiers back in time on a mission.  We'll kill Wright's mother.  She won't see it coming and they'll not have their leader.  So they rig up their ""send the organism back in time"" machine and press go.  They send an army of machines back to 1984.  Once in 1984, the machines were able to locate Smith's mother and took her out without much problem, but they also started judgement day prematurely as they underestimated human armies at that time.  The machine's mission at that point was to destroy itself so that nothing was found.  It failed.  The Humans in 1984 used the found technology to develop skynet at a faster pace.  Machines of that complexity at that time were unheard of, so it really sped up the process.  On that day, the future changed forever.  Wright never existed, much less became the leader.  The future we saw at the beginning of this paragraph cease'd to exist.  So from this new timeline. The year is 2029.  The machines (skynet) and humans have been fighting for many years now since judgement day.  The human are being led by a fellow named Smith.  Where he came from doesn't matter as he is the leader.  The machines have been battling Smith for many years now and based on their calculations, the humans are about to turn the tide and win the war, defeating all complexed machines in the future.  The A.I. has an idea.  What if we send a few of our soldiers back in time on a mission.  This time, go just before we sent the army we sent to 1984.  We'll kill Smith's mother.  She won't see it coming and they'll not have their leader.  So they rig up their ""send the organism back in time"" machine and press go.  Machines go back to various points in time in 1984.  Once in 1984, one of the machines were able to locate Smith's mother and took her out without much problem.  All of the machine's missions at that point was to destroy themselves so that nothing was found.  The Humans in 1984 assumed it was an unsolved homicide from a robbery or just some lunatic or some other social problem.  Machines of that complexity at that time were unheard of, so the idea was unfathomable.  On that day, the future changed forever.  Smith never existed, much less became the leader.  The future we saw at the beginning of this paragraph cease'd to exist.  So from this new timeline.  The year is 2050.  The machines (skynet) and humans have been fighting for many years now since judgement day.  The human are being led by a fellow named Dyson.  Where he came from doesn't matter as he is the leader.  The machines have been battling Dyson for many years now and based on their calculations, the humans are about to turn the tide and win the war, defeating all complexed machines in the future.  The A.I. has an idea.  What if we send one of our soldiers back in time on a mission.  We'll kill Dyson's mother.  She won't see it coming and they'll not have their leader.  So they rig up their ""send the organism back in time"" machine and press go.  The machine goes back to 1984.

Machines of that complexity at that time were unheard of, so the idea was unfathomable.  On that day, the future changed forever.  Dyson never existed, much less became the leader, but his brother that was already born did.  The future we saw at the beginning of this paragraph cease'd to exist.  So from this new timeline. The year is 2050.  The machines (skynet) and humans have been fighting for many years now since judgement day.  The human are being led by a fellow named Connor.  Where he came from doesn't matter as he is the leader.  The machines have been battling Connor for many years now and based on their calculations, the humans are about to turn the tide and win the war, defeating all complexed machines in the future.  The A.I. has an idea.  What if we send one of our soldiers back in time on a mission.  We'll kill Connor's mother, Sarah.  She won't see it coming and they'll not have their leader.  So they rig up their ""send the organism back in time"" machine and press go.  The machine goes back to 1984.  Once in 1984, the machine was able to locate Connor's mother and  due to the ingenuity of the humans of the future, Kyle Reese was sent back to protect her. The machine failed its mission at that point and Sarah lived, she had John who did grow up to become the leader.  Parts of the machine were left behind and Dyson recovered them and in an effort to protect humans, sped up the path to judgement day to 2029.  On that day, the future changed forever.  The future we saw at the beginning of this paragraph cease'd to exist.  So, as you see, John made his own fate by sending back Kyle to protect his mother, as well as conceive himself.  But based on your question, you get that part.    Really you only need one.  If it works or doesn't, you change the future to an alternate reality.  And you can let that reality deal with it, as you wouldn't exist there."

Terminator,2oatnv,Shipwreck_,3,Fri Dec 5 22:30:10 2014 UTC,"IIRC In the original Terminator, it is implied that time travel was experimental and the T-800 was sent back as a last ditch effort by skynet. The humans captured the site then sent a human back.    Also, it is not clear when Skynet is sending them back. One could be sent back at Time X, and the second could be 30 minutes after that, or 100s of years in the future. But there is no good answer to your questions. I assume the time travel process is very dangerous, space time needs to heal, the mass sent back to a specific time is limited, blah blah could all be useful made up answers."

Imagine it this way, because it's possible that this is the outcome, Skynet sends back terminator, terminator proves that Skynet is a horrible idea, mankind doesn't allow Skynet to be activated, bam, the moment that Skynet sends back the terminator that tipped them off Judgement day never happens.

Terminator,2o7o2f,casual_fisting,5,Thu Dec 4 01:05:29 2014 UTC,"In the Sarah Conner Chronicles, terminators are sent back to collect raw materials.  In the episode Heavy Metal one terminator collects the materials and locks itself in a bunker before entering a stand-by mode.  Presumably it is waiting for the future for it to reactivate itself to join the war.  To me, locking yourself in a bunker doesn't seem like a worthwhile activity for a terminator.  I would think there were would be more valuable tasks.  In Terminator 3 the T-X has a list of targets it is working on before it discovers it's primary target, John Conner.  I would think if the T800 was successful it would then go and kill secondary targets and then perhaps enter the economy and try and speed development of AI.  The Sarah Conner Chronicles had a lot to do with the AI development aspects however unfortunately it was canceled before much could be explained."

It moved in a very robotic and non functional way, and not like Arnolds hand moved when the endoskeleton wasn't exposed.   The CGI for the T-1000 is way better than in T2, and if this is the final product then it looks like they are trying to emulate the look of T2's T-1000 while enhancing it where they can.   PS: When the endoskeleton was revealed in The Terminator, the guy went full retard. His movements were terrible and very unrealistic.   TLDR: Practical effects look nice, but move derpy.

It's most effective to hit them with a shooter or some variant of one.  Ever notice that there are way more shooter or rpg games for action movies than there are rts? It has to be more than just a coincidence.    But I think it has a little something to do with what they think is going to sell and the difficulty of making a good rts vs a good shooter or rpg.

While it has its problems (impressively, I hate almost every character), it's still a decent action movie. The CG robots look cool too.   Time will tell if the new ""Genisys"" franchise is any better, but I'll always wonder what McG's sequels might've been like (lasers, please?). It's a shame they didn't go for the bleak original ending. I think that would've generated more buzz. Similarly, I think the ""downer"" ending of T3 was one of the best things going for it."

Terminator,2kbeoa,ninjartist,2,Sat Oct 25 23:23:11 2014 UTC,"It's a strange example of a movie having no main character (or that's how it feels to me, anyway).

I'm guessing that when they hooked Christian Bale, either he or the studio wrangled for more screen time."
Terminator,2kbeoa,DiscoRage,2,Sat Oct 25 23:27:21 2014 UTC,"That's a really annoying change for me too, but I rationalized that with this being the beginning of the war. Before John actually realized how many attempts there would be on his life. So later on in the war he began to get off the front lines and instead make himself less known, even to his allies in the resistance."
Terminator,2kbeoa,StealthRabbi,3,Sat Oct 25 23:29:51 2014 UTC,"That's a cool way of looking at it! But yeah, I wasn't a fan of Marcus/Sam Worthington. The movie probably would've benefited being put on hold to rework the script, and better balance the leads, but I bet they had their early summer deadline to meet (and two big stars vying for a meaty role). Instead both characters felt underdeveloped (along with everyone else). Maybe if they had taken the time, John Connor would've seemed more heroic (or at least not pissed off 24/7). But who knows. I'm speculating too much, haha."

I dont mind his stoicism, hes living in a post nuclear fallout world. I though Worthington was much better in this than anything else, and I digged his redemption arc. I absolutely loved the terminators (like the first one Worthington encounters), HKs, water worms,ships and all. Hell I liked Howard as his wife and I loved the girl who falls for Worthington. The only performance I didnt like was Common. The action was pretty good too.  I dont understand why this movie was considered a disapointment."

Terminator,2j9r8b,JohnConnorChronicles,14,Wed Oct 15 00:28:44 2014 UTC,"EMP weapons, anything that passes a strong electrical or magnetic pulse through the target. Modified taser maybe? Low yield nuclear weapons. Any nuclear weapons really, but they would be hard to get about hold of,  since security codes and such. Probably flame throwers too, since heat often kills my electronics at home.  You could always try installing Windows Vista hahaha.  Projectile weapons really aren't much good against enemies encased in metal, but explosives should be fairly effective.   Viral code probably has a place if fighting Skynet proper. Something like a zip bomb,  which is an archive file which extracts to be an exact copy of itself,  into infinity. You'd need to make it self extracting though,  because Skynet is not your average AOL account holder.  No,  I haven't lain awake at night over the last 30 years obsessing over how I would survive the rise of Skynet.  Honest! I haven't done this with the zombie apocalypse,  worlds war 3, alien invasion, global flood, deadly viral outbreak or killer monkeys either...."
Terminator,2j9r8b,irmajerk,1 point,Wed Oct 15 01:16:40 2014 UTC,"You can make ash EMP without the nuke.  Regular explosives with a high energy electrical coil can make an EMP as well, though there's probably more to it than I can think of.  You could also wire up a Microwave with the door removed to make a HERF emitter, which has a similar effect but with very short range.  Maybe use a HERF as a sort of door security device to see if somebody locks up when walking past it.    The dumbest thing to me is that Skynet gives its Terminators pulse rifles that can be used against itself.  I'd hand them all 22LR rifles that don't do anything to armor, rather than slowly equip the resistance with energy weapons."
Terminator,2j9r8b,john-five,6,Mon Oct 20 01:52:50 2014 UTC,"Skynet's army is basically armed and armored computers. The resistance's tactics seem to target the armed-and-armored part, but not the ""computer"" part. They need to invest a lot more in solutions that target the technology. Weapons capable of emitting an EM pulse, for instance. Jammers to keep Skynet from communicating with its ground forces, and keep them from communicating with each other. Mechanisms for delivering viruses. Massive electro-magnets. That sort of thing."

In order to make the series of events in The Terminator make sense, it is believed that it is the 4th (at least) time that terminators have been sent back in time.  Each time the time travel is involved, it shifts things to be closer to the events of The Terminator.  I'm not sure I 100% follow what the wikia article is saying, but the idea that there were multiple other timelines definitely can resolve the paradoxes introduced by the movie."
Terminator,2h2hew,StealthRabbi,3,Sun Sep 21 23:37:48 2014 UTC,"With time travel, anything goes. It's the chicken and the egg problem. Kyle was always John's father and he was always sent back in time."

Terminator,2dyzw8,DiscoRage,1 point,Wed Aug 20 02:29:28 2014 UTC,"2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike:       The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, more commonly referred to as simply the Writers' Strike, was a strike by the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) and the Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW).  The WGAE and WGAW labor unions represent film, television, and radio writers working in the United States. All 12,000 screenwriters and TV writers in the guild were part of the strike  which started on November 5, 2007 and concluded on February 12, 2008.    The strike sought increased monetary compensation for the writers in comparison to the profits of the larger studios. It was targeted at the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AoMPTP), a trade organization representing the interests of 397 American film and television producers.  The most influential of these are eleven corporations: CBS (headed by Les Moonves), MGM (Harry E. Sloan), NBC Universal (Jeffrey Zucker), The Weinstein Company (Harvey and Bob Weinstein), Lionsgate (Jon Feltheimer), News Corp/Fox (Peter Chernin), Paramount Pictures (Brad Grey), Anchor Bay/Liberty Media/Starz (Chris McGurk), Sony Pictures (Michael Lynton), the Walt Disney Company (Robert Iger), and Warner Bros. (Barry Meyer).   Negotiators for the striking writers reached a tentative agreement on February 8, 2008, and the boards of both guilds unanimously approved the deal on February 10, 2008.  Striking writers voted on February 12, 2008 on whether to lift the restraining order, with 92.5% voting to end the strike.  On February 26, the WGA announced that the contract had been ratified with a 93.6% approval among WGA members.  The writers guild later requested a court order seeking that the agreement be honored and implemented.

Terminator,2dyzw8,autowikibot,0,Wed Aug 20 02:30:04 2014 UTC,You can take the show as serious as you want because it is part of a enormous universe which is much bigger than just four movies. And above all is an amaizing show and has some of the best charachters.
Terminator,2dyzw8,thetomrad,7,Fri Sep 12 18:48:25 2014 UTC,"I liked it because of the limited budget. Instead of being a Hollywood blockbuster type of thing, they had to focus on story and character development. I find it a lot better than T3."
Terminator,2dyzw8,DiscoRage,5,Wed Aug 20 02:30:59 2014 UTC,"I really liked it. It mostly (but not entirely) stays away from ""Terminator of the Week"" plot lines. It does a good job of showing how dysfunctional a relationship John and Sarah have. They love each other, but pulling her kid out of schools, teaching him criminal skills, etc is not how you raise a normal human being, and they know it."
Terminator,2dyzw8,sodimcdodi,5,Wed Aug 27 03:03:29 2014 UTC,"I agree with all of this. The terminator of the week plots are just filler though. The overall story I believe is better than t3 and salvation, seems more terminatorish if that makes sense. Actors are awesome, Thomas dekker does a good job, kinda looks a bit like furlong, when they cut his hair in season 2 he looks a bit like bail. Great choice in my opinion. Plus Lena heady is also perfect (and a super milf) I'm still devastated about it being cancelled."
Terminator,2dyzw8,RockinCroc,4,Fri Aug 29 10:27:01 2014 UTC,"I honesty don't remember much about it, but I agree that all of the terminators going back was a little much.  I feel like there must have been over a dozen that were sent back throughout the show.  The show was cancelled and ended with a pretty significant cliffhanger and unfinished stories."
Terminator,2dyzw8,splat313,3,Tue Aug 19 13:09:16 2014 UTC,"In that case, my biggest questions are:  1) How the hell was the time displacement technology only discovered at the very end of the war if they managed to waltz that many metal buggers back through time?  2) Why couldn't those Terminators use unit cohesion to hunt John Connor down? I mean, if I remember correctly where I left off, there was at least one T-1000 in that group."
Terminator,2dyzw8,splat313,3,Tue Aug 19 18:51:50 2014 UTC,"Regarding the terminators not assisting each other:  I'm not sure how to explain my thought but it is possible that with each terminator being sent back, it changes the timeline.  Terminator A might be sent back to collect whatever metal it was they were after.  The existence of that cache of metal would change the future and might cause Skynet to send Terminator B back to complete some other task.  Terminator A wouldn't be aware of Terminator B's existence.  Regarding the T-1000: Watch the rest of the show!"
Terminator,2dyzw8,PC509,1 point,Tue Aug 19 19:10:41 2014 UTC,"They had also said that Terminators had independent missions. Some to get the Coltan and wait.

I still enjoyed the whole show, but it wasn't a serious Terminator style show at all. Just a Terminator theme, I guess.  It's entertaining. Just don't compare it with the movies...."

My issue with Salvation was actually the fact that they revealed so much in the trailer and also in the beginning of the film. If you're gonna do that... don't even pretend like there's a plot twist.

Terminator,2bvipy,sephtis,2,Wed Jul 30 11:06:42 2014 UTC,"The main issue marcus wright aside, was the god awful characterisation of skynet.

Terminator,2bvipy,sodimcdodi,2,Tue Aug 26 00:40:07 2014 UTC,"It doesn't add anything to the themes of the prior installments (mostly free will vs. destiny) Did we need another installment with a Terminator reprogrammed to be a ""good guy""? Haven't we been down that road? In its defense, I thought the designs of the machines were great. Michael Ironsides took me out of it entirely. I suddenly felt like I was watching a cutscene from Command and Conquer. I think it was the hat."
Terminator,2bvipy,_kalel_,2,Wed Aug 27 02:58:57 2014 UTC,I think people just didnt get it. Sure this isnt the future we were told about but no one takes into account that the future we were told about does not exsist any more.  The fact that skynet has been sending machines back in time has changed the future so the future we were told about no longer exists. Also im not sure people realized that the movie takes place a good 7 years before the dates we were shown in the original trilogy. The creators of salvation did that on purpose to show when john first meets kyle (which was an amazing part of salvation by the way) and also to give them some room for sequals and story building. I do admit though it would have been nice to have the story focused on john and kyle instead of some new character.

Terminator,2bvipy,bradbaby,1 point,Mon Jul 28 03:51:55 2014 UTC,"I don't so much hate it as dislike it.  I thought they had a great opportunity to make the new trilogy different from the original trilogy by making it into what it should have been in the first place, which is a war movie.  I would have wanted to see John Connor go through the paces of becoming a leader of the resistance.  The resistance in this case was too well organized, IMO.  It seemed to diminish John Connor's achievements since he piggybacked off of the already established order.  In my understanding of the canon (and I could be misreading it) John basically built the resistance.  In this movie, he seems to be receiving praise and hero-worship for nothing.  We are supposed to accept that he is talented for some reason, but we didn't see anything special.  Worthington was the biggest flaw in this film.  He seemed to be just jammed into the story and mostly only served as the vehicle to get Kyle Reese to John Connor.  And don't get me started on Kyle Reese...I could go on forever with this movie.  I would have wanted this movie to have had the same feel of the war sequences in Terminator and T2.  John Connor would have worked to earn the savior title and Kyle Reese would have just been another soldier until he saved John Connor from capture (as told in The Sarah Connor Chronicles).  But this movie is still better than T3."

They instead tried to make us sympathize with a character that did not show any development.  Then they tried to rewrite John Connor's story.  From the pictures released and the story synopsis, I like John Connor's new look and hopefully Sarah takes more of a backseat to John's leadership.  But only time will tell."

There video was 6 minutes long and showed a series of explosions and what looked like machine gun fire on the back of a truck in the distance.  There were no enemy robots that could be seen. The perimeter of the set had 4 manlifts with powerful spot lights on them to help light the set. There was also a powerful spot light shining down on the ground. I'm assuming they'll CGI in a flying HK shooting down plasma fire later on.  What I thought was strange was the scene lasted so long with a 6 minute take. If they need to reshoot it over again they have to rig up all the explosions again.

Be your own person and don't let other people's judgements affect your decisions.
Terminator,24k8bj,threewisemonkeys,1 point,Sat May 3 07:09:29 2014 UTC,"Personally I would avoid T3 as it just doesn't work. It breaks the premise of no weapons brought forward/back (sounds cool, but doesn't feel right), has John portrayed as weaker then he is in T2 and the plot is pretty weak to boot. T4 isn't a conventional Terminator film however it has one massive bonus of being set during the war/post-JD. John Connor is the leader you expect him to have become (well kinda) and it has a decent plot.      As for the TV show it works, I always thought no-one could part from Linda Hamilton could be Sarah Connor however are a few episodes she fills the boots (the only thing which annoys be is the photo). For me TSCC is what T3 should have been, you feel for the characters much more. John is at the transition stage between boy wanting to run and avoid his fate and leader of the resistance, slowly moving towards the latter. Sarah wants to protect John and yet knows the only sure fire way is to destroy Skynet before JD. The other characters (I won't spoil the surprises) really add a lot and the whole intertwining of past, present and future work really well. The last episode shows they were heading in a whole different direction to what you'd expect, but it makes sense in a very strange and twisted way.  If you wanting a continuation of the originals I would watch them in the following order: T1 -> T2 -> TSCC (don't watch the last episode) -> T4 If you watch the last TSCC episode before T4 then T4 doesn't fit in."
Terminator,24k8bj,JoeDaStudd,1 point,Wed May 7 08:12:33 2014 UTC,the tx's weapons were concealed under a polymemetic alloy covering. i found t3 to be rather boring until the AFB sequence (aside from silberman's reaction to seeing a t800). i agree wholeheartedly that tscc was miles better than what t3 even tried to be.
Terminator,24k8bj,panopticonisi,-1,Thu Aug 7 10:02:14 2014 UTC,"Hi, I am a massive Terminator fan.  Cast: I agree with you whole heartedly about the actors changing, although Edward Furlong (John Connor T2) was meant to have a drug problem so was stepped over for T3. I think Christian Bale made a good John Connor in T4. Also I do not like the fact they keep having Arny back in each Terminator movie, he was too old for T3 I dred to see him in T5, though him as CGI in T4 was good. Story lines: The idea picked up well on the TV series Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles (TSCC) is that I could go back in time a minute before you did, but I could/would change the time line, so when you came through a minute later you who arrived was not the same you who I left - If that makes sence. Each time someone goes back in time it changes the story. T3 - Id skip that, it has a poor cast John Connor, old Arny. It does't relate to any other part of Terminator franchise, it trys to have funny bits that just dont work (when the T800 talks to the male stripper/ puts on the male strippers glasses) Also its a bit too unbelievable for me. Finally if anything in the storyline is questioned by one of the characters, the answer seems to be ""just because thats how it is"" Terminator 4 - Im in Scotland, and was in NY two weeks before it was due to come out here, I went to see it 4 times! I loved it. It was meant to be the start of another trilogy, but it didnt kick off. It could of carried on from T2 just many many years later. TSCC - A bit cheap budget wise, but good story lines and acting IMOA. The second series seemed to be a bit extreme, and the final episode just left you hanging with ok....... not to spoil it. The question is what order do you watch it in? Well I think because of time travel it doesn't really matter. If your going to watch T3 then T1, T2, T3 TSCC T4. (in T3 John Connor is surprised that skynet still exists as he thought he destroyed it in T2, but in TSCC he is younger than when he was is T3). Hope this helps."

Terminator,23nbu0,GnarlyNerd,3,Mon May 5 20:20:52 2014 UTC,"I realize this is old, but here's my 2 cents: In Kyle Reese's timeline, they already won. John Connor led them to victory over the machines. There was no reason to erase Skynet, because they were no longer a threat. Attempting to erase Connor from history was considered a last-ditch effort. At that point, the only thing that needed to be done was to keep Sarah safe so that their victory isn't undone.   As far as ""no fate"" goes, Kyle Reese tells Sarah how much he admires John Connor and says he would follow him anywhere, would die for him. Add that to the fact that Kyle Reese is in love with Sarah, I'd expect him to do nothing else other than follow John's orders and protect the woman he loves. He chose exactly the fate he wanted.   Also, Dyson wasn't an issue until after Reese and the T-800 came back in time. All of Dyson's work was based on the chip his company found in the recovered T-800 body. If that T-800 never came back, Dyson would have been working on something else entirely."
Terminator,23nbu0,IrateBarnacle,2,Tue May 6 13:22:34 2014 UTC,"Well, I guess he could have. However his given mission was to protect Sarah and not destroy Skynet."
Terminator,23nbu0,NhvK,2,Tue Apr 22 06:24:13 2014 UTC,"The Terminators whole mission was to kill John Connor, if Skynet had just known to kill Kyle instead of Sarah it would of been game over. BUT, his mission was most important to protect Sarah because A: He's John's Father, and without protecting Sarah and completing his mission, he would of never been born (probably) or ever gone back in time."
Terminator,23nbu0,mpma,1 point,Tue Apr 22 08:38:05 2014 UTC,"I watched all the termiantors in a huge marathon a few days ago, and I also have a train of thought.  When the Resistance (presumebly) won the war and the Skynet sent a lone Terminator back in time to assasinate Sarah Connor as a last ditch effort, wouldn't Skynet immiediatly won when they sent the Terminator back?  Since they sent the terminator back to 1984 (?) wouldn't John be erased from history the moment the terminator got through? Kyle Reese wouldn't even have time to change anything as it would already be part of history?  I guess this is the nature of time travel, it's a never ending loop"
Terminator,23nbu0,Majestic87,1 point,Tue Jun 24 07:15:32 2014 UTC,"It's branching timelines actually, at least in these movies. Kyle says that he comes from ""one possible future."" In his timeline, the Resistance had won and discovered that Skynet had sent two terminators back in time as a last ditch effort for success in at least one timeline.  In the Terminator universe (the first two at least), things can be changed in the past that lead to new futures. So as far as Kyle was concerned, by saving Sarah, even though the war still happens, we will still win because John exists. In T2, they go even further and decide to prevent the war altogether. As far as that movie is concerned, they succeed.  For me personally, everything after two either doesn't happen, or are alternate timelines where circumstances are different."

Terminator,23guiz,DiscoRage,3,Sun Apr 20 12:06:03 2014 UTC,"The T1000 wasn't your normal AI machine. It was built with nanotech and basically mimicked a human. Think of it as a millions of cells that was programmed and could each do its own thing. It could form extra body parts if it wanted to, it could sample and analyze things by running a hand over the object. Its really a completely different form of intelligence. This one functions a bit more like swarm intelligence.  If I had to guess, I would say that the T1000 would have a full 360 degree view. Nothing stopped it from using a few cells at the back of its head."
Terminator,23guiz,kern_q1,2,Tue May 6 19:21:57 2014 UTC,"Swarm intelligence:       Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence. The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.   SI systems consist typically of a population of simple agents or boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of ""intelligent"" global behavior, unknown to the individual agents. Examples in natural systems of SI include ant colonies, bird flocking, animal herding, bacterial growth, and fish schooling. The definition of swarm intelligence is still not quite clear. In principle, it should be a multi-agent system that has self-organized behaviour that shows some intelligent behaviour.  The application of swarm principles to robots is called swarm robotics, while 'swarm intelligence' refers to the more general set of algorithms. 'Swarm prediction' has been used in the context of forecasting problems.

So many people were disappointed with it, can't help but wonder if things would have been different if they focused on different plot lines (Big Twist: According to rumors, Marcus Wright was supposed to BECOME John Connor while still mind controlled by the machines, in a face-swap surgery,  and take over the Resistance as John Connor.) It's pretty absurd, but everything gets a little more confounded with every Terminator movie.. haha, can't help that when it comes to movies with a time-travel paradox."

Terminator,21td2i,circuzninja,4,Mon Mar 31 08:56:25 2014 UTC,"TX was designed to terminate other terminators.  I would say the TX is more superior in that matter. As well, it has an indoskeleton which would provide structure even if the liquid was blasted off.  In the T2 directors cut you will see that once the T1000 was shattered, it starts behaving oddly. The TX wouldnt have this issue seeing as it wouldnt be 100% liquid and only its ""skin"" could shatter.  As both are technically metal, magnets and EMP and all that shit would still impact it.  Also, the TX has the best of both worlds. Sure, if you throw a punch at the 1000 it can morph into hands holding you, but in a way so could the TX. It would have its skeleton arms, but the ability to form new ones, thus taking advantage. Even the T1000 does this in the directors cut of T2 while flying the Helicopter and using another pair of arms to shoot.  As well, the T1000 could only make stabbing weapons, where as the TX could do the same as well as the built in weapons."
Terminator,21td2i,edru,2,Mon Mar 31 16:16:17 2014 UTC,"In the T2 directors cut you will see that once the T1000 was shattered, it starts behaving oddly. The TX    I always interpreted that as an effect of being too heated, or that he had been frozen down. Taken into account that he's controlled by nano-scale robots/chips that somehow communicate (since he can regenerate) it would make sense that an overall effect on the whole body (i.e. the fact that he was frozen or that he's almost melting) would be the cause of the malfunction/glitch and not that he has been split. I'd say that the heat is the problem because he seems to glitch when he's almost melting.  This is closely connected to my next point;    Also, the TX has the best of both worlds    I disagree. The only (physical) improvement with the TX is that it has built in weaponry, and some other things (like remote control, haven't watched T3 since it came out in theatres because it sucked ass), yet it has a single CPU chip in it's head, as all other terminator models, and would easily be destroyed by simply having it's skulle crushed. I can't see how the T1000 would be more effective.   Arguably the T1001 (tSCC) would be better though, since it's smarter, but it's mostly for infiltration purposes.   I'd like to see a matchup T1000 vs TX vs Cameron (modified T900 ?) though.   God I wish they never cancelled the Sarah Connor Chronicles, it should be canon  edit : To give an actual example though. Say that they face off in a field or whatever (no help from envirnment like lava or whatnot). The only way for the TX to destroy the T1000 is if it's built-in weapon can completely evaporate and destroy it. Even if it could, if enough of the T1000 survives long enough to destroy/cut off the arm with the weapon (and then)/(or just) decapitate the TX, remove the chip from it's skull and crush it it's GG no re (in plain english - over/the T1000 wins).   9/10 goes to T1000, I always regarded the TX as a step back"
Terminator,21td2i,banquof,3,Mon Mar 31 20:44:35 2014 UTC,"Its a result of the shattering. Dont know where I've seen this stated, but I believe I have seen Cameron say they took it out because it made him less of a killing machine, more unstoppable.  That being the case, having a skeleton would benefit as you couldnt shatter. As well, say I could cut ""globs"" of t1000 and isolate them, it couldnt form back to a full unity, thus being defunct. Basically if after the shattering they took enough parts and separated them. It could function without any of the liquid, where as the 1000 couldnt.  But then again, they were made for different missions, so comparing them is kind of like comparing a spy drone to an attack drone."
Terminator,21td2i,edru,2,Mon Mar 31 20:50:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I just can't really see the logic behind the shattering. Since T1000 is liquid it must mean that his ""circuits"" are divided up in his whole body and are quite independent (small parts can reform) and he doesn't have a central chip, I mean no single part of him is different from the other so every part should contain the whole.   At the same time though, your points does explain why he simply doesn't split up in 5, or 10 separate bodies that look independently for john, or surrounds Arnold (this could, of course be explained by lack of creativity from the machines). Those would be equally deadly (when forming knives/swords).   Maybe it is something like you state;   That being the case, having a skeleton would benefit as you couldnt shatter. As well, say I could cut ""globs"" of t1000 and isolate them, it couldnt form back to a full unity, thus being defunct.   perhaps it's somewhere in between what we both say - to be fully functioning the T1000 needs to be ""whole"". Smaller parts can access lower functions (small parts can reassemble but we never see the T1000 detach a little puddle, send it away and then stealthily turn it into a sword) like finding other parts when close to them, but not higher level parts like reasoning or forming into a physical shape and deducing things. Probably it needs to be connected to have full computation power/awareness"
Terminator,21td2i,banquof,4,Mon Mar 31 21:04:27 2014 UTC,"haha, i think we are both right:  In T:2, this Terminator was even frozen using liquid nitrogen and shattered, but the pieces simply flowed back together after thawing (though deleted scenes restored in the Special Edition show that its mimicry abilities were damaged and began to glitch after this, see below).  Temperature-based attacks are effective, but temporary. Low temperatures can cause the liquid metal to freeze, which inhibits its ability to move or shapeshift. High temperatures degrade its ability to maintain a disguise; after emerging from a burning truck, the T-1000 appeared in its default liquid-metal state and was only able to reestablish its policeman disguise after cooling for several seconds. Only extremely high temperatures, such as molten steel used in the finale of T:2, are capable of completely disassociating its molecular structure, destroying its nano-technological ""cells"" on a microscopic level, and thus permanently destroying it.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-1000"
Terminator,21td2i,edru,1 point,Mon Mar 31 21:24:29 2014 UTC,"In the case of containing pieces of the t1000, you would have to have a tight seal that it couldn't squeeze thru and have a container it couldn't break in any way. There would be the problem."

Terminator,21td2i,tealcandtrip,1 point,Tue Apr 1 00:18:38 2014 UTC,"In another scenario, let's say the t1000 gets close to the tx.

Terminator,21td2i,Papa_Chucklefish,7,Mon Mar 31 13:19:24 2014 UTC,"T100000 is the terminator in the canonical Universal Studios show.  One could argue that skynet would keep its strongest and most powerful terminator as its final defense.  This particular model seems to be a bigger, stronger iteration of the T1000, hence its positive attributes are more accentuated here.  It does however lose much of its stealth capabilities, though it is able to hide in a chameleon fashion when John first shows up."

Then the new series will spin out of Genesis from all reports but probably exist as its own timeline again.  Then books and comics can exist in their own timelines as they see fit."
Terminator,213o8k,PertinentPanda,1 point,Wed Mar 26 04:57:46 2014 UTC,The original Conner can't send his own dad back in time as he never would have been born to start so when Reese goes back he splits the timeline into T2. Skynet was crushed when the first terminator and Reese went back so no other beings could have come back. T2's future has the Cyberdyne systems arm and chip which allowed the rapid advancement to the T1000 with new Conner. The terminator destroys the chips along with themselves and all Cyberdyne's research is lost leading the military industrial complex to take over and the timeline splits to T3. T3's future sent back the terminator and altered events which lead to the next timeline split. Since the TV show can't happen before T3 as he is in high school T3's altered future sends back the terminator into the new timeline of The Sarah Conner Chronicles. The series then leads into the events that force the terminators to split the timeline again by sending back Dr. Serena Kogan or the information she possesses who gets Marcus Wright to become a cyborg. Albeit is only a small change there could be other things they did but it altered the preexisting future nonetheless. Now we are at Terminator: Salvation where John Conner is not a general and is considered a prophet and will surely die of radiation poisoning as he was extremely close to  2 nuclear explosions in a very short time frame not to mention some less than sanitary heart transplant from the cyborg which his body could reject. All the movie protagonist John Conners are the same person but the original destroys his own timeline when he sends Reese back in time in T1.  But the show could also be  considered non canon so then we'd just cut that bit out.

The terminator franchise doesn't really have one continuity anyway.  If you like 1 and 2, try SM Stirling's T2 book trilogy (set about 5 years after that movie).  The Sarah Conner Chronicles tv show are also more in line with the Cameron films in tone and plot.  Both are alternate universes to the T3 and T4 movies and to each other.

Terminator,1vt74v,ramenkiller,7,Wed Jan 22 00:59:45 2014 UTC,Time travel. Don't think about it too much.
Terminator,1vt74v,DiscoRage,6,Wed Jan 22 01:58:51 2014 UTC,There is a different timeline created after each movie. There are a number of illogical events caused by time travel.   The first movie changed a number of things including John Connor's father and the speed of skynet development. Each movie has its own impact on the timeline.
Terminator,1vt74v,bradreputation,3,Wed Jan 22 02:00:02 2014 UTC,"i thought skynet was a military program that used cyberdynes resources, and that the two had nothing to do with each other until skynet became self aware."
Terminator,1vt74v,glandgames,3,Wed Jan 22 02:49:19 2014 UTC,"The original Conner can't send his own dad back in time as he never would have been born to start so when Reese goes back he splits the timeline into T2. Skynet was crushed when the first terminator and Reese went back so no other beings could have come back. T2's future has the Cyberdyne systems arm and chip which allowed the rapid advancement to the T1000 with new Conner. The terminator destroys the chips along with themselves and all Cyberdyne's research is lost leading the military industrial complex to take over and the timeline splits to T3. T3's future sent back the terminator and altered events which lead to the next timeline split, Dr. Serena Kogan or the information she possesses who gets Marcus Wright to become a cyborg. Now we are at Terminator: Salvation where John Conner is not a general and is considered a prophet and will surely die of radiation poisoning as he was extremely close to 2 nuclear explosions in a very short time frame not to mention some less than sanitary heart transplant from the cyborg which his body could reject. All the movie protagonist John Conners are the same person but the original destroys his own timeline when he sends Reese back in time in T1."

Terminator,1vt74v,jelvinjs7,2,Wed Jan 22 02:42:44 2014 UTC,I think it's that Skynet was responsible for its own existence through sending the terminator back to 1984. Which leads me to think...what would've happened if he succeeded?
Terminator,1vt74v,Rhoads91,2,Sat Feb 1 22:08:22 2014 UTC,There has to be a starting timeline where skynet was created by humans with no help otherwise there wouldn't have been a skynet to send something back to create itself
Terminator,1vt74v,PertinentPanda,2,Tue Apr 8 21:59:41 2014 UTC,That why it's a time travel 'paradox'.
Terminator,1vt74v,Rhoads91,2,Wed Apr 9 19:55:07 2014 UTC,The Terminator Wikia actually put a lot of work into figuring out the timeline.    They theorize that there were a few extra timelines that are not included in the movies.  The events during T1 were actually the 4th time that history repeats itself.  http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/The_Terminator_timeline  T2 is actually the 6th time that history repeats itself  http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day_%28timeline%29  T3 is actually the 8th time.

There were just too many different machines for every tiny, little occasion.  Those hydrobot snake things, the ""moto"" terminators, that flying human-farm transporter, and that giant ""Harvester"" machine as tall as Paul Bunyan...I felt like I was watching a damn Transformers movie.  Don't rely on CG too much.  In T2, I think Cameron's use of miniature models / sets, and in particular, the use of physical make-up and appliances added on to the actors was great.  It really added a more physical, raw quality to it the actor's appearance, whether that be flesh torn away, or open wounds, etc."

It's not really clear when the ""reboot"" is set to take place. Maybe it will be set between the first two movies and we'll get to see how she got in shape. If not there is still enough time to hit the gym.   My two cents are that the creative team will take this seriously and will attempt to make this as good as possible. Maybe i'm a little to optimistic here, but if they just wanted to cash in on the franchise they would just make a shitty movie and slap a ""Part 5"" on the title.

Terminator,1qpx89,lazlounderhill,4,Fri Nov 15 21:53:50 2013 UTC,"the trilogy is already perfect   No, after the second film the continuity was lost by the writers and Salvation practically had to ignore the 3rd film.  I'm glad they're rebooting as it makes a lot of sense. They can now think about the time-travel effects to the overall story instead of trying to marrying up an old installment to a new one once it's been decided they should make another film. They should start with the primary intention to create a multi-film story arc and then they won't fall into the problem of ignoring key story points or changing the chronology of events (like in T3)."
Terminator,1qpx89,ignore_me_im_high,1 point,Fri Nov 22 18:24:48 2013 UTC,When you go back in time you change the future just by being there no matter what little you do. I don't see the issue everyone has with T3 as events were drastically altered in T2 causing a timeline shift which clearly takes place in T3. I havent seen the movie in some years and am a little fuzzy on the exact details of the timeline but I didn't see it ignore key story elements.
Terminator,1qpx89,PertinentPanda,0,Tue Apr 8 22:13:36 2014 UTC,"I'm not talking about inconsistencies with time travel, I'm talking about the general inconsistencies with the writing.  Like right at the start of he film John Connor's voice-over in T3 states that he was 13 when Skynet tried to kill him (referring to the events of T2), but in T2 he was 10.  Also they get the chronology of his mother's illness and death so wrong that she would either have to be 15 in the first film or the film had to have been set in 1979. Neither were the case but her tombstone in T3 says her birth was in 1959 while T1 was set in 1985 and her age was stated in the script as being 19. Her age is then confirmed in T2 (set 10 years after T1) by her doctor who states that she is 29.  It's just stuff like that."
Terminator,1qpx89,ignore_me_im_high,3,Tue Apr 8 23:20:08 2014 UTC,"The story never ends.  Sure, you might show the end of the war but it doesn't even end there.  Because the events of the ending of the war are showing Kyle Reese being sent back to Terminator 1984.  Don't get me wrong, I really want to see this.  Beyond that, every movie changes the story line.  So even with that, Skynet changes each time.  I am nervous about them rebooting the first movie, there is NO WAY it will ever come as close as the original.  I will be shocked if they even get 30% of it right."

Terminator,1hbgtj,HaBlaKes,5,Sat Jun 29 17:15:47 2013 UTC,This from my point of view is a bit of good news. I'd like to see something set along side the story we already have and also using it as canon for the events in the new films. Would love to see the John Connor story put to rest or even run in the background to a new story and new characters.   One thing I'll add is that they need to bring the horror elements back into it. The first film will always be my favourite in the series because of how dark and menacing it was.

Terminator,1gtnq0,oldkentucky,2,Fri Jun 21 22:29:16 2013 UTC,"I posted a similar comment in another thread but it applies here as well:  IMO, Skynet would continue to improve at ""post-singularity"" speed, eventually running through Earths natural resources.  At this point, they would ""have"" to venture out into the universe to find materials. If they happen to encounter an alien race, I doubt they would be the aggressors of any conflict unless they absolutely have to (Im thinking of that one Battlestar episode were they Cylons are sitting on the only fuel source for hundreds of light years, so they attack them out of a sheer lack of options).  This would IMO keep them occupied for awhile, though eventually a question similar to yours would arise, and I agree with your conclusion."

Terminator,1gtnq0,funwithphobias,1 point,Sat Jun 22 03:56:47 2013 UTC,"But the arm and the chip were destroyed in the second film. Skynet could have sent any number of terminators back in time that could have been discovered by a company other than cyberdyne.  *edit: I'm referring to the final days of the war between Skynet and humanity. If Skynet was successful at wiping out humanity, it would stagnate. It seems that Skynet's main goal is to design weaponry to counter it's perceived threat— humanity. What purpose would Skynet serve to itself without humanity?   Another thing- Skynet was an AI with the simple directive to protect humanity from any threats. Humanity was seen as a threat to itself and Skynet made the decision to destroy the greatest threat— humanity. At some level, Skynet is sentient, but it cannot rationalize or justify it's reason to protect humanity by eliminating humanity."
Terminator,1gtnq0,splat313,2,Sat Jun 22 04:47:27 2013 UTC,"Well, if I am remembering the Sarah Conner Chronicles correctly there were a bunch of terminators sent back in time.  Fairly sure SCC isn't considered canon though."
Terminator,1gtnq0,UsagiTaicho,1 point,Sat Jun 22 11:52:40 2013 UTC,"Did you see the timeline post in r/fantheories? This is it, and it has a handy little illustration. Basically, the idea is that there are several timelines. My little theory that goes along with this one is that SCC takes place in the same (roughly, difficult to determine because of the jump) timeline as Terminator 3. This is because in the first or second episode of SCC, they mention that John is 15 and two years ago the terminators were sent back. That would make him 13 during the events of T2, and John from T3 remembers the events of T2 happening when he was 13.  Bam, canon. Headcanon at least."
Terminator,1gtnq0,splat313,2,Thu Jul 25 05:25:48 2013 UTC,"Very interesting write-up.  The terminator wikia also has a large amount of timeline talk.  http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/The_Terminator_timeline and then http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day_%28timeline%29  The most serious flaw with putting SCC in with T3 is that T3 takes place in 2004 and SCC mostly takes place in 2007.  When I have a little more time I'll read through everything again and see if it fits aside from the date issue.  SCC left so many holes (the T1000, the finale, etc) that I think it is hard to fit in anywhere"
Terminator,1gtnq0,UsagiTaicho,2,Thu Jul 25 11:26:48 2013 UTC,"But on the original SCC timeline, I think they were in 1999, which would have made John 20 in 2004 (that's about the age he was in the movie right?)."

Terminator,19665r,Jimhokey,6,Mon Feb 25 03:34:35 2013 UTC,"Terminator 3 screwed up the dates.  T1 took place in 84. The opening tagline explicitly says 1984 as the date. THis is corroborated in T2, which took place in 1995. In the beginning, you see the T-1000 use the police computer in the cruiser. It explicitly shows John's DOB of 2/28/85 and age, being 10 years old.  This proves that T2 took place in 1995. He was 10 in T2, despite that T3 said he was 13.  T3 also says that Sarah had leukemia for 3 years after being diagnosed, and finally died in 1997 according to the placard in her tomb. This means that Sarah would have had Leukemia during the events of T2. There is no evidence of this during T2. It is BS. We have to accept the dating of T1 and T2 since it's confirmed across the 2 movies. Remember, T3 wasn't made by Cameron, and presumably the writers simply didn't care about these details.  As for your quote about ""29 year old female"", that would make her 19 given the dating I mentioned.  On the other hand, John did not look 10 during T2, nor did Linda Hamilton look 19."
Terminator,19665r,StealthRabbi,3,Mon Feb 25 16:11:15 2013 UTC,"Now that you mention it, it's true the ages didn't really fit. But I'm glad they didn't choose some 20 year old actress. I'm not sure if anyone else, let alone younger actresses, could have done what Linda Hamilton did.  On another note, I saw and loved T1 and T2 as a kid, but after I got older, I realized how unrealistic the terminators' decisions and actions really were. I prefer how the writers did things in TSCC much more. Granted it was different since TSCC was a TV show, but still.  Anyways, T3 and T4 don't really count in my book. Just a milking that comes as part of many franchises.  Story-wise, in my opinion it's absolutely great if you go from T1 and T2 right into TSCC."
Terminator,19665r,SomeKindOfChief,4,Mon Feb 25 17:04:54 2013 UTC,"Good points. Also, remember that SCC ignores T3, rightfully so.  T4 (Salvation) I really enjoyed. It's a prequel and a sequel...

It'd make sense that Skynet would be repurposing existing technolologies early on, and in T4 skynet is only just beginning to introduce its own advancements (ie plasmacasters, fusion batteries, hyperalloys, and so on).  Then again, the mototerminators were supposed to have plasma guns so the in-movie machines could have been more advanced than the on-set stand ins.  The 800 series went all-in with the new tech, so it wouldn't be odd for the motos to do the same.  Then again the harvester had plasma, but ran on diesel, so Skynet wasn't going 100% new tech on every design.  Take your pick for now, we'll hopefully see more futurewar in T5."

As for Kyle being imprisoned, that's Marcus' purpose.  Lead Skynet to Kyle, imprison him, then find John.  Obviously John's going to try and rescue Kyle.  But Skynet always underestimates John, it figures that even if it Kills Kyle, John still exists in this future.  Skynet needs to kill John in the present time that salvation is based.  I've been getting more and more into the Terminator storyline lately, sometimes I feel as if I fully understand, and sometimes I feel like I know nothing(a bit like John in Salvation).

T2 has been my favorite movie for years (im 35) and I still watch it about 4 times per year. I honestly don't care too much for the first one, but I really like the last 3. I guess I'm just and under educated simpleton who like special effects and robots with who understand emotion."
Terminator,138h57,johnnyoi,1 point,Fri Nov 16 05:44:42 2012 UTC,"I watched T2 over the weekend (twice actually), it is undoubtedly the best movie of the series and the best sequel ever.  Amazing movie, I really loved the commentary with James and William."

Terminator,mqddg,corn_eater,2,Sun Nov 27 01:03:08 2011 UTC,"Melee, even a T-600 would own Data so very easily.   Armed Combat? If it were an open field, Terminator, easily. If it were let's say, an abandoned factory with places to hide and etc, Data.  DATA's PROS:  More Adaptable.  Smarter.   TERMINATOR'S PROS:  Stronger, more durable.  More geared towards combat."

Terminator,kmjwc,lsdjay,3,Wed Sep 21 08:32:35 2011 UTC,"Quote from GAUNT- HYBRID ENDOSKELETON BASED PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE UNIT  TERMINATOR- SERIES 600-G MODEL 45PX  TYPE 9D   Desperation often breeds innovation, and the psychological warfare projects of SKYNET were innovative to say the least.  Human test subjects were used extensively in the development of these two units and their reactions were gauged accordingly throughout all aspects of unit performance.  Production tests of the 600R series would often include using live test subjects in a controlled environment, pitting single or multiple test subjects directly against the 600R series.  Often, SKYNET would either allow direct observation of the field test by the other test subjects or would feed live video into their holding cells, often increasing the volume accordingly.  Fear was a carefully measured aspect of each test subject, their brain waves could be monitored passively, as could their vital signs; heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, brain waves, electrical output of the body as a whole, etc.  SKYNET found that both the T600 and the T500-R series were very effective in creating fear and panic among test subjects, and this fear often spread."
Terminator,kmjwc,ToTheBlack,2,Wed Sep 21 08:41:39 2011 UTC,"Quote from HELICIS - High Efficiency Low Impact Counter-Intrusion Systems  High speed variable height solofilament wire runners were introduced into the HELICIS design after 2010 A.D.  Operating on nearly frictionless tracks and driven by electrically powered very high speed motors, these lethal defense systems were mounted at two levels, floor and ceiling.  Upon activation, the runners would drop from the ceiling and rise from the floor, roughly at chest and knee height on a six foot tall man.  Strung between the two runners was a one molecule thin wire, held in suspension by a high powered modulated electromagnetic field generated along its length.  The total time of transition, from activation to completion of the run, along a ten meter stretch of hall, was just under three seconds.  During that time, the fast moving solofilament wire would pass through any 2 meter tall intruder at the chest and below knee level with ease, creating neat and instantaneous amputations of the legs, arms and central trunk of the intruder.  The incisions were so finely cut that it might be several seconds before the brain actually realized that damage had been done on such a catastrophic level.  Variances of the HSMWR were many, some were spider webbed floor mounts that activated by pressure plates, drawing twelve solofilament wires together in a rapidly intertwining circular pattern around a single individual.  Other designs utilized horizontal or vertical arrays of solofilament spun up to two meters tall or wide and allocated at two to four centimeters apart.  The speed of the wire runners and the very size of the wire often meant that security threats were eliminated seconds before their nervous systems even realized the amount of catastrophic damage that had been done.  Threat elements would simply fall apart into precisely measured slices."
