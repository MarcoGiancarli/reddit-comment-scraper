Drop bears are commonly said to be unusually large, vicious, carnivorous marsupials related to koalas (although the koala is not a bear) that inhabit treetops and attack their prey by dropping onto their heads from above.  [broken citation]  They are an example of local lore intended to frighten and confuse outsiders and amuse locals, similar to the jackalope, hoop snake, wild haggis or snipe. [citation needed] Stories of attacks by the fictional animal are commonly told to scare tourists.   Various methods suggested to deter drop bear attacks include placing forks in the hair, having Vegemite or toothpaste spread behind the ears or in the armpits, urinating on oneself, and only speaking English in an Australian accent.

Kissing is like gently exploring what the other likes, start by kissing her lips, no tongue, and then gently keep your lips apart, flick your tongue in between and touch hers, then pull back for a bit.  You'll get the hang of it soon enough, if someone had given me the info I bestowed onto you (not that it's that fancy or that I'm an expert) back when I was 12 I'd have thanked that person millions!

One thing tho, some of those bleeding heart liberals are gonna try to confuse with some ""facts"" that if you read them might make you feel ""stupid."" Like the fact that 60% of the people who get food stamps/welfare from the gov'ment are white. Or the fact that 70% of people receiving food stamps/welfare had 1 or 2 working people in their household Or that 60% of people who get welfare/food stamps are over the age of 60 or under the age of 18 Here's USDA SNAP program stats from Mississippi (P.S. SNAP means food stamps, I'll let you go look up all the information for every state if you think that Mississippi is an outlier)  Then again, if you were the type of person who was worried about the facts you probably wouldn't have posted such an ignorant meme on reddit in the first place.  Also, looks like you are a regular contributor to r/fatpeoplehate super classy bro!  Congrats!

meme,3482k8,IzGeorge128,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:22:11 2015 UTC,"I like and agree with your post in what you are trying to point out but statistics can be manipulated by the opposing view to prove their own point eg 40% of food stamps go to non white households but they form only 22.3% of the population. This distracts from the issue of WHY this section of the community have to rely on welfare to survive. Do some individuals take advantage from the system? Of course. Take any group and any system and there will be a small number who do this. This should not be a reason to castigate the majority. The real problems run so much deeper than the American media are prepared to admit. They take a populist approach and report what they think the majority will approve of and to hell with the truth. I am not an American resident now but lived long enough there to love the both country as a whole and and the Americans I lived and worked with (and married) but also to see it's faults. I was fortunate to live there at a time when American investigative journalism and journalists were admired around the world. To visit now and see what the country and the current media has fallen to is hard to experience. This might sound dated but after a string of bought, ineffectual presidents America could really benefit from a president like Regan, who might not be the sharpest pencil in the box but knows how to make every American feel they are equal and a part of a great nation, together, unified. Sadly the big business interests who fund the deadbeats and yes men who get nominated will never stand for this as they won't make money from that kind of man."
