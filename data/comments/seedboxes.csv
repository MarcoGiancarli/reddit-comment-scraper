Others (like online.net) forward the notice to you and expect you to reply with 48 hrs -- something like ""the infirnging the file has been deleted"" suffices every time."

seedboxes,3e2n7i,rendez2k,2,Tue Jul 21 14:12:25 2015 UTC,I think this might be a better off at the Sickrage forums. The question is not really related to Bytesized exclusively it's more about how you can give information back to Sickrage when you use blackhole instead of a direct connection. I can imagine that there is perhaps an API you can use to tell certain things to Sickrage.   I think this subreddit is too small and you won't get any sane answers.
seedboxes,3e2n7i,Animazing,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"I've had the same question... Not sure that it really matters though to be honest, but I would like to see that they were downloaded and not just snatched. I'll head over to the Sickrage forum to see what they say too."

seedboxes,3e2n7i,tafazzi87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:58:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, as long as sickrage knows where the files END UP and understands the file folder structure there, it should be scanning that hierarchy and seeing your new episodes. My current setup involves a blackhole of .torrent files, and a different program (MediaCenterMaster) that does the post-processing. Your problem should apply, but SickRage always figures out that the snatch has been successful when it scans my library and sees those episodes in their proper place.  What's your setup like? Is the comp that runs Sickrage the same that handles the DLed files? When your filebot renames the files, does Sickrage know where they're going? I.E. is the library seen by Sickrage the same the filebot is interacting with?   Maybe increase your Sickrage library scan frequency?  EDIT: Oh I see, Bytesized makes it a streaming thing from the box. So you'd need some sort of download notification going from the box to your comp at home. Unfortunately, SickRage is still too barebones to have something like that AFAIK. But instead, why not try getting Sickrage installed on the seedbox itself?? Check out this post, and one of the top rated comments. Perhaps your seedbox provider would be open to installing sickrage for you? It pretty much manages itself re:updating, etc. and plays nice with most ubuntu distros."

seedboxes,3e1fxf,aakrusen,4,Tue Jul 21 05:40:52 2015 UTC,To begin with in my experience Comcast is notoriously bad often during peak hours speeds will be much worst then off-peak hours which usually is a sign of overselling capacity.  Speedtesting sites are created to test your theoretical maximum speed. They achieve this by picking a server which is the closest to your location. Sadly a seedbox doesn't work this way. Your seedbox is just one server located mostly in Europe. So if you are in the US and your Seedbox is in Europe the route that your traffic must is usually much longer. That's why your seedbox speed will almost never match your speedtest speeds.   Sometimes your provider will have access to tools to reroute your traffic differently this might help. But usually the easier answer is just to use multi-segmenting FTP clients.
seedboxes,3e1fxf,Animazing,3,Tue Jul 21 06:13:00 2015 UTC,"As ^ suggested, you might want to try a different FTP client that supports segment downloading. This will allow you to download multiple files at the same time. Which will allow you to possibly saturate your connection..   If I were to suggest an FTP client, I would say use CuteFTP."
seedboxes,3e1fxf,R9BOOM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:18:51 2015 UTC,"I've heard that trying a different FTP client might speed things up, but how does that work?  Other than selecting a different way to move files, how could one client be faster than another?"
seedboxes,3e1fxf,R9BOOM,2,Tue Jul 21 14:49:22 2015 UTC,Because segment downloading is different than single downloading.. If you want to better understand refer to this  https://whatbox.ca/wiki/Multi-threaded_and_Segmented_FTP
seedboxes,3e1fxf,Animazing,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"Would multi-segmenting work on a single file?  I've got FileZilla setup to do a maximum of 10 files at a time, but how would that work with a single file?"
seedboxes,3e1fxf,robertblackman,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:23 2015 UTC,I think you are confusing multi-threading with multi-segmenting. The latter can split up a single file in multiple segments. FileZilla can't do this. Free Download Manager or CuteFTP Pro for instance can.

It should be something like /home/username/foldername  , I suggest setting it up with a user account and also disable root access. There are a lot of guides online to setup rutorrent manually, it involves more work and effort , I'm a newbie and I learn along the way.   Using a script is definitely more straightforward, if you can find other download links to the files, you can try to edit the script to input that.  Or maybe you can try installing other torrent clients such as deluge, there are also a lot of scripts for it and setting it up manually is also just a few steps, better to go with the latest version deluge 1.3.11, very easy to setup including enabling ssl.

Sometimes they pick routes that are not always in your best interest. Raise a ticket and reference this post and I will move you to a Feral based Streambox so you can reroute your traffic and most likely improve your streaming experience.  There is a small chance your ISP is overselling their local capacity in which case this won't make a difference but this is really rare so I think this will improve things for you.

Doing such should greatly increase the chances that your Plex will run smoothly. You may want to consider a dedi. It may provide a better Plex experience.  I don't have any experience with tal0ne. I don't think they are telling the truth about the JoySeed's upload. 8 times 150 Mbps is 1200 Mbps; dedicated upload per user might be more like 125 Mbps.

This way, it'd automatically transfer any new files, and just exit if there were no new files to transfer.   You could add some sort of ""recheck"" at the end of the script where it scans the source folder again, and if there are new files, it re-executes itself.   Or you could write an ""undo"" script which moves files back out of the _lftp folders, letting you rerun the script including new files."

seedboxes,3dabrb,deep-heat,2,Tue Jul 14 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"you start a torrent client on your seedbox, and add the torrents. Since you uploaded all the ""files"" already, you won't ""download"" the data in the .torrent again, you should just start seeding it directly. This part is a little tricky, and takes some experience to understand how it works.  I suggest you default to adding torrents in a paused state. Then go to the site you have your upload on, and download the torrent. It will add it, but not start downloading it. Then, edit the torrent IN the client ON the seedbox to point to the folder where you uploaded the data. Then tell it to recheck all the data. It should change from 0% downloaded to seeding 100%, but still paused. Then just start it, and tada, you are seeding from your seedbox.   There are other ways, but this is how I do it, so I make sure I have the exact right torrent, and if for some reason, i'm missing a file or something, it'll just download the difference and then seed.  Test on something small (not 4gb files/etc) in case you accidentally redownload your own thing, I don't want to see you screwing up your ratio on a site.  Surely your seedbox provider has info on how to use their service, if not, plenty of other providers also provide help/walkthroughs, you'll just need to adjust it for your server instead.  Good Luck!"

At that time I was unable to do 2 things: access the WebUI of my seedbox which is ruTorrent, and in FileZilla, the folder which held all my rips/uploads was not visible, so I used TM to move them all, which was a mistake. That folder is now visible, for whatever reason, and I've moved them back, which was potentially another mistake. I think your idea of downloading the torrent from the site, onto the seedbox, then editing the torrent may be my simplest solution. My idea at the minute was fixing my mistakes then migrating to the server, but I think I could potentially skip that. Although it was skipping steps which led me to my stupidity."
seedboxes,3dabrb,khalpin11,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:50:37 2015 UTC,If the files you uploaded to the seedbox are under the /files directory all you will need to do is copy the .torrent files to the seed boxes /watch folder and rtorrent will import them and start to scan the files (not redownload) to check if they are the correct files.
