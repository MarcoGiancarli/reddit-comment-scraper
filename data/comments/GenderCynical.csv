GenderCynical,3e2khg,illuminatedcandle,6,Tue Jul 21 13:49:31 2015 UTC,"It's actually really hard for me to understand how someone can operate on a day to day basis with an ideology that has such an emphasis on fear and hate. It's exhausting, not only mentally but physically as well. I've had my share of pure hatred and fear myself and it took me a year to even begin really recovering from it. When you spend some serious time and effort actively hating someone or a group, it has this tendency to take over your life and shackle your thinking to this binary process where you have trouble placing things outside of the two choices of ""this is what I hate"" and ""this is what I like"".  I see that happening here with the people on GC and I can't help but to feel very sorry for them. I wish they could find a way to live without seizing on the fear and hatred that they have of certain other humans and just focus on making this world a better place in general. I mean, ultimately, should that not be our goal as a species? To leave our children and their children a world where they get the opportunities that were denied us? To give them a society where anyone can find a way to fulfill their dreams?  Hating on trans people doesn't do that. Making their lives measurably worse doesn't help anyone except the same caste system and patriarchy these TERFS claim to fight. Claiming to fight oppression while oppressing others does nothing except continue the same cycle that's been going on for millenia.  All I want is the freedom and opportunity to be who I am, whatever that is, without facing discrimination, oppression, and violence. This isn't possible yet. I honestly don't know if it ever can be possible, but that doesn't change that working towards that goal is something I strongly feel is beneficial to everyone.  Heh, my dad tells me that I'm an idealist, a dreamer. That what I want isn't possible and that I should accept reality and just be content with working with the system. I want to tell him that he's wrong. I want to tell him that my dreams are what keep me going, that they keep me from being more broken than I already am. For what is mankind without dreams to chase? Nothing but rabid animals chasing their tails on instinct and I daresay that we are better than that. We are better than the fear that would strike at our hearts and damn our minds to misery. We are better than the hatred that would damn our souls to an eternity of lashing out at those we love. We have the capacity to dream beyond our limitations, to build upon those who have become before to a degree that is unimaginable, and to create things both terrible and great on scales that I can't even fathom exist.  And so many people don't seem to realize that. So many people are content with just surviving. They're content with parroting what they've been taught and irrationally hating anything that goes against that. They're content with taking mankind's potential and just trashing it, or worse, using it to maliciously destroy. And that makes me sad. I grieve not only for those lives destroyed by malice, hatred, or fear, but for those lives that are never properly realized because of them.  Enough ranting about that, I suppose. I am a dreamer. These TERFs want me to toss away those dreams and to be content living in a cage because they can't understand how anyone could live outside of one. I have enough fear and hatred to get past of my own, thanks. I'll not let them build a similar cage for me."

In any case, I hope that the answers that you are getting are useful to you. I will be watching the thread closely.  permalink report block user mark unread reply   [–]to BeeeboBrinker sent 52 minutes ago  My brother uses Reddit, he told me they had groups for everything. I don't understand what you mean though, why would /r/feminism be a bad choice and why would your group? My concern comes from my feminist beliefs.  If they are, could you direct to where's best to ask? I feel a bit bounced around.  I've become a little uncomfortable asking in your group, I don't think transitioning is right for my daughter and the one person gave me really good advice regarding legal council but there's something in my gut, reading the replies, that tells me something is wrong here.

Good luck.  permalink report block user mark unread reply   [–]to BeeeboBrinker sent 34 minutes ago  Teen wannabe FtM, that's part of it. The sort of uncomfortable language in your group.

Plus I've had a few direct messages from people who side with my daughter with some points.  I think I need to read up a bit about transgender people, re-examine things.

I always figured the GC crowd as being rad fem women who don't like men and the idea of masculinity being associated in anyway with men and femininity existing at all.  What is the cis male there for?  Are they non conforming men? Is that it?  How can a man be non conforming if gender is a hierarchy?
GenderCynical,3duxgn,theory_of_kink,7,Sun Jul 19 22:03:27 2015 UTC,Why do they say cis when they don't believe in the terminology?   They don't actually have terms that specifically refer to men who aren't transgender and women who aren't transgender so they have to borrow terms they would normally insist are slurs.

Seriously though, I don't really care about the appropriation of certain stereotypically feminine behaviours because, just as appropriating masculine behaviours did for us, it was a way of expressing their sexuality to each other in a time when they could face imprisonment or chemical castration for being gay. Gay mannerisms have their roots in feminine ones because like most women they were attracted to men and it could be the case that a man is feminine without being gay, giving them plausible deniability.  It's fine to me, they're not really saying anything about women by behaving that way.  EDIT: missing word."

Like gay men just like men, and are sometimes feminine.  And if you are gay and can't hide it, you're in for a lot of violence.  This is why appropriation doesn't apply as much when it comes to gender, because there are so many different things working.

GenderCynical,3duxgn,AdumbroDeus,5,Sun Jul 19 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"No.  Straight men are privileged on both gender and sexuality, gay men are privileged only in gender.   Having privilege in one area does not fix oppression in another, they interact and being oppressed in multiple areas can act as a force multiplier and/or simply change the type of oppression one suffers.  So no, gay men do not ""Gay men often have just as much privilege as straight men"", gay men are fundamentally and systematically oppressed in society.   They may still be privileged in gender and oppression in sexuality does not give them special insight into women's issues, but saying that they can be as privileged as straight men is pure fallacy, that's not how privilege works."

GenderCynical,3duxgn,theory_of_kink,5,Sun Jul 19 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"No, it's not appropriation.  It's subconsciously showing group identity by internalizing elements associated with it. Gay men are trained that their sexuality is a feminizing aspect therefore there's a tendency to subconsciously internalize aspects of female gender programming to show their identity. That's why it tends to show up from such a young age.   So society programs gay men to be effeminate just as much as it programs women."
GenderCynical,3duxgn,Philae_90,2,Sun Jul 19 23:45:53 2015 UTC,I think it depends on the case.  Can a gay man be misogynist? Sure.  I guess there is disrespectful caricature and then there is satirical parody.  We probably need examples.

How exactly are they signifying they are above women while ""colonising""* their tendencies? If it's usually a misogynist caricature, when is it not? Would the inversion (gay women appropriating masculine mannerisms) be misandristic? If not, why not? Because we do often appropriate masculine mannerisms in the lesbian community.  Also, this is after they've been accused of appropriating black culture. Is there anyone safe from the all-devouring force of gay male appropriation? Won't someone please think of the children?

GenderCynical,3duxgn,new_aphrodite,4,Sun Jul 19 23:48:52 2015 UTC,no.  It's subconscious internalization of feminine behaviors because gay men are told their sexuality feminizes them and because they're at least subconsciously aware of it from a young age. They're taking elements of women's gender programming because they're told being gay is feminine.   Same is true of lesbians.
GenderCynical,3duxgn,theory_of_kink,2,Sun Jul 19 23:49:42 2015 UTC,"Or...it's because male homosexuality is associated with femininity in our culture, and thus male homosexuals are conditioned to act out the roles society dictates."

Kids with inherent gender non conformity (trans and gay) and cross-sex identifications are more likely to buck their assigned gender role.  Children learn the differences between the genders at a very young age, and gendered items are all around them.  If you're into men and you see mommy is also into men, you're more likely to be like her in other ways."

Also, notice that I added:   If you're into men and you see mommy is also into men, you're more likely to be like her in other ways.   Kids learn a lot from the couples and parenting bodies they see around them, it's really naive to assume that toddlers don't already have pretty decent knowledge of gender roles and what they mean - I mean some of the best evidence is that gender identity is fairly immutable and determined by age 5 in many cases."

No but I propose there is something to femininity and masculinity having some biological origin.  It maybe only as a box we put things in to wave as a flag.  Of course kids learn out gender operates from those around them. But how much and what are they learning?  You think non conforming gay people are just mimicking opposite sex people because they think that will attract same sex people? I don't see it.  The kids are doing it before they know they are gay.  I think people have a natural desire to express gender."
GenderCynical,3duxgn,AdumbroDeus,4,Sun Jul 19 23:16:18 2015 UTC,"No but I propose there is something to femininity and masculinity having some biological origin.   It's certainly true that there may be some abstraction from some sort of biological sexual role, but we're culturally so far abstracted from that, it's difficult to imply that a lot of our gendered ideas are actually rooted in biology.   Of course kids learn out gender operates from those around them. But how much and what are they learning?   Almost everything. That's why fashion and gender roles differ so wildly across cultures.   You think non conforming gay people are just mimicking opposite sex people because they think that will attract same sex people? I don't see it.   When you have traits that are more like one gender, you may have closer identifications to people of that gender. It doesn't mean you ARE that gender, but rather that our notions of sexuality are very gendered. Men like women, women like men. Lesbians are assumed to be masculine and ""wanting to be men"", gay men are assumed to be feminine and ""wanting to be women"".  Kids know this crap. Kids are really good at noticing how they and others are perceived by society.    The kids are doing it before they know they are gay.   Because ""gay"" is a social category somewhat abstracted from same sex attraction. Kids mostly identify with people, not necessarily social categories, and then as they grow they become more aware of the categories and social implications of being certain ways.   I think people have a natural desire to express gender.   It's difficult to say this with any certainty because no child is raised in a vacuum, ever. But we can change the conditions to some extent, and to assume that presentation and clothing choices are inherent is very, very faulty logic."
GenderCynical,3duxgn,theory_of_kink,2,Sun Jul 19 23:32:43 2015 UTC,"Because the way they receive the message is ""be noncomforming"" due to the fact that the way gender roles are taught is based on an assumption of heterosexuality in the audience."

GenderCynical,3duxgn,theory_of_kink,2,Sun Jul 19 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"Uh, no. Gender roles aren't innate, they're social constructs.   By being taught what gender roles are, they subconsciously compare it to their identity and internalize the gender roles that match."

GenderCynical,3duxgn,theory_of_kink,2,Sun Jul 19 22:22:09 2015 UTC,"To match what their identity tells them is their social role. In the case of a gay man, it's a feminized man, in the case of a mtf trans person it's a woman. Of course individual aspects of nature and nurture will never make this 100% but society's messaging results in these roles being taught this way."

That seems unlikely. That seems like parents of gay children asking ""where did they learn this."" They didn't learn it anywhere. Children who grow to be gay adults are often drawn to cross gender conforming behaviour.  I'm seeking the reason.  I guess I think masculinity and femininity are real. In the sense there is a biological empty gendered box we put some things in.  I think biology needs signalling."

GenderCynical,3dn4l7,doodlebug_firefy,9,Fri Jul 17 19:10:08 2015 UTC,"well they're not inconsistent I'll give them that.  But the fact is that the way most people use sexuality is based on attraction, not based on practice. Gay and bi people are not oppressed in our society because they chose to stop having sex with the opposite gender, but instead because we love and lust people of the same gender.   That's why political lesbianism is appropriation of our oppression, because it is an attempt to redefine what we have ostracized and murdered for into something that is safe for straight consumption. They know that what they mean by ""lesbianism"" is not what has been oppressed for generations, yet they continue to try to force that definition, to participate in our groups, not as allies but as a part of us, they try to drive those same group's agenda towards their own interests.   That is the definition of appropriation.   So yes, by their twisted definition of sexuality a woman in a committed monogamous relationship with a man cannot be bisexual. But by the definition of sexuality that most people actually mean when they say bisexuality (even if they deny that bisexuality is actually a sexuality) that same woman can be a bisexual.   Furthermore this woman has suffered oppression her entire life for her sexuality, something political lesbians can never understand.   And as usual it is the identities of women that they chose to invalidate, women who have suffered oppression that they will never understand, oppression because of their identities, identities based on biology, is there any better evidence that they remain a force for the patriarchy?"

GenderCynical,3djacd,Relota,3,Fri Jul 17 01:36:51 2015 UTC,"COLOR CODES & RIBBONS In a standard 13x13x13 Illuminati alter system, 13 colors were used, and each computer was given a color. These would be pink, orange, yellow, white, red, brown, blue, green, black, purple, silver, gold and platinum, and clear. Color programming is reported to have been developed at UCLA. Whatever the case, Systems all over the United States have color programming. The hierarchy of colors in a System is often as follows (from top power down): Platinum, Gold, Silver, Purple, Black, Red, Green, Brown, White, Orange, Yellow, Pink. Clear is also used as a color for secret areas of the system. This hierarchy of color coding can be switched. The internal programmers can reassign colors if they need to, in order to protect the programming. Alters, sections, and parts of the computer are all color coded. The color coding for alters is not the same just because the alters are in the same section. The color coding within the Illuminati Mind Control is fairly consistent, however a sample of an alternative Illuminati color scheme will also be provided.  A survey of colors is as follows:  CLEAR. Secret or shell alters who can take on any color are coded clear. These are alters who serve as images or as a stage for other alters. This would include “Guardian of the Vail” alters.  GOLD. This color is for the supreme leadership in the System, which includes the Grand Druid Council.  SILVER. This color is for the Satanic alters who perform high level Satanic rituals. The Mothers of Darkness have silver coding.  PURPLE. These alters see themselves as the abusers, rather than the Illuminati. These alters were involved with the programming. They have been taught to forget the abuse and to reframe it in their mind as training.  BLACK. These alters were born out of Satanic ritual, and are Moon children. The Delta and Beta alters are black coded. They do the dirty work for the cult, such as blackmail and assassination.  RED. These altars see themselves as witches. They were born out of witchcraft ritual, believe they have great spiritual power, and tend to deny that they have been abused.  GREEN or EMERALD GREEN. These cat altars recognize they have been abused. They still see themselves as belonging to the cult family, and deny that they have been abused to protect their cult family.  BLUE ALTERS. Clones, armies and the ribbons appear to have blue coding. These alters will go so far as to hurt the body to protect it from leaking information or deprogramming.  WHITE. ‘These are Atlantean alters who have been given Aryan type racial nonsense to think they are superior. They believe in genetic engineering, and a master race.  ORANGE. These special protector alters are scouts who warn of danger from internal or external threats.  YELLOW. These are the strong Christian alters of which there will only be a few in the System. They help serve as a balancing point to control the System as well as to hide what the System is all about.  PINK. These are core related alters. They maintain the true feelings of the true self apart from the cult programming and the cult family’s programming. These alters are viewed as weak because they are emotional and often break down and weep. They are fragile emotionally.  An alternative color scheme that is used:  DARK EMERALD GREEN. This color is assigned to the AntiChrist-Satan alter(s). Green is the occult color for Satan and happens to be the most sacred color. Few people outside of Satanists know that Green is more sacred for them than any other color.  LIGHT GREEN. The gods and goddess alters which are triads which function in  Illuminati ceremonies get this color coding.  WHITE. The internal programmers who come around in white robes get this color assigned to them, as if they are doctors or angels of light.  RED. Sexual alters are given the natural color of sex and arousal red.  BLACK. Connecting alters that are Nexus alters between various system parts.  PINK. Reporting alters.  DARK BLUE. Non hierarchy cult alters.  LIGHT BLUE. Alters in charge of the way the system runs, such as the judges.  YELLOW. Alters which are ritually and sexually twinned with alters of other systems.  ORANGE. Guard alters which are heavily programmed for obedience.  VIOLET-PURPLE. Front alters and small child alters placed into boxes.  CLEAR. Shell alters to deceive the outside world.  GOLD. The traumatized alters upon which the programming is built on."

Brain controls identity yes there are recognized disorders that can be fixed, but to operate on the brain in order to rewire it to change somebody's gender identity.   Well that's pretty much equivalent to killing a person's personality. Somebody's still there, but it's certainly not the same person who was there before. That's why this proposal is unconscionably Orwellian.   On the other hand changing the body does not affect personality.  I just can't imagine the mental hoops one has to go through to consider killing somebody's personality preferable to simply having cosmetic surgery so one's body fits with their identity.   Related, the TV show Babylon 5 did a great exploration of death of personality in the episode, Passing Through Gethsemane. I highly recommend it for an exploration into what these TERFs propose as an alternative to ultimately cosmetic surgery."

Of course, because it's not like six year olds are ever interested in babies, or are aware they could eventually give birth to them.

And we all know that a prepubescent ten year old trans girl has a major advantage over prepubescent cis girls. After all, penises are magic.

The patriarchical response against women is different, women are assumed to have no agency therefore their preferences and identity can be safely ignored and occasionally violence can be used as a disciplinary measure.

To colonize lesbians they'd have to be trying to force lesbians to adhere to traditional norms especially in regards to male supremacy, which is logically impossible if they deny their maleness regardless of whether or not their gender identity is legitimate.   Patriarchy teaches men have an automatic right to women's body's as a class, denying maleness by it's very nature makes lesbian trans people not an expression of this.  Not to mention, all you have to do is look at how threatened the traditional agents of the patriarchy are by trans people to see that trans people as agents of the patriarchy doesn't work. No other area are traditionalist church leaders, male chauvenists, and every other patriarchal force so deathly afraid.   And it's not just the possibility of accidentally sleeping with a trans person, trans people illustrate the fallacy of assigning roles based on sex better then any other group, as such they are  threat that cuts right to the core of patriarchy.   They cannot function as patriarchal colonizers because their very nature opposes the existence of the patriarchy and being opposed to trans people actually supports the patriarchy."

They have willfully misinterpreted cis to mean happy with a gender role, to be happy with the roles society has imposed and that is not what cis means.  Nobody, especially not trans people, want to stick anyone in a box, and we certainly don't want to tell anyone they're happy with it.

I have heard pedophiles can't be cured, though I don't know how true that is, or very much about pedophilia. But if people who are pedophiles can be attracted to adults who haven't gone through puberty or young looking adults or things like that, then I would think that that is the answer to pedophilia. Since they could form sexual relationships with people who could consent.  If it's healthy sexuality between two adults who aren't hurting each other and are psychologically well and doing kind to each other. With mutuality and respect and love. Then I don't think it's much my place to judge. What I care about in relation to pedophlia, is whether or not children are safe and healthy.  If pedophilia can include healthy, consensual relationships between consenting adults. Then it stops being a word that's very useful about the subject of children's health and safety as much."

The research is clear that GrNH antagonists are more dangerous in people with circulating sex hormones: adults and youth in full-blown puberty.   Current protocol of starting blockers mid teens is higher risk because most kids, by that time, are in full blown puberty.  This is why WPATH and responsible doctors are trying to establish a standard of care that allows blockers to be started younger. Before puberty begins. That is the safest way.  This information is not hard to find. The only reason TERFs make an issue of ""11 yEAR OLDS ON BLOCKERS!!11"" is because, like Jenny McCarthy and Anita Bryant before her, claiming your opposition is deliberately endangering kids--maybe even your own child omg+ --is one of the standard tactics when you have no actual substance to your position.  + It's trans o'clock; do you know where your children are?"

GenderCynical,3cxpi0,maybeayri,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:28:53 2015 UTC,"This seems awfully different in so many ways. In fact, the comparison feels like it trivializes the horrors of rape and what pedophiles do to children.  Consent is a little bit complicated and there is more to it than just sex. There are lots of things that children aren't ready to consent to. And I'm glad that there are conversations about how things like non-sexual, but also non-consensual kissing of children and other forms of physical touching and coercion and how harmful they can be are being discussed. Whether or not the intent is sexual, there are all sorts of things that hurt children and things that children are forced into that aren't consensual that hurt children.   I'm glad that people are having those conversations. And the consent and ability to consent of children should always be considered important, not just for sexual things.  But also, this is very different. Children aren't feeling dypshoria for not being able to have sex with adults. Children aren't desperately asking for help in this way. There are children who are suicidal because they're so uncomfortable with what puberty is doing or may do to their bodies. But I'm pretty sure there aren't any children with suicidal feelings because they aren't having sex with adults.  Helping children with their wishes and needs is a lot different from an adult forcing themselves on a child sexually. Things like hormone therapy and delaying puberty are helping with a child's wants and needs, not the sexual desires of an adult for a child. There are children begging for help with hormones and gender identity and passing and the way their bodies are. While I see just the opposite about sex between adults and children. Where it is what the adults want and children don't want.  And abusive sexual relationships between adults and children aren't inevitable. Puberty often is. While there are many people who don't go through puberty at the same time or when they reach adulthood without outside medicine. And people all go through puberty at different times. Puberty is something usually chosen for them by biology without medical intervening. So whether or not there is medicine, biology usually chooses this kind of thing anyway. It's a kind of inevitability that's a part of people's biology.  Going through puberty or not going through puberty doesn't cause the kind of psychological harm that sexual abuse between adults and children does. If someone goes through the kind of puberty and development that isn't right for them, then that is psychologically hurtful. But that's why medicine exists to help.  So it just seems horribly and incredibly trivializing of rape, to compare offering medicine to kids to allow them the kind of development they want, to adults pushing their bodies on children who haven't had enough memories and experiences of the world to make an informed decision about having sex.  Also, I'm not totally sure about the definition of pedophilia. It does seem to have a lot to do with puberty, though I'm not sure why since many people who have gone through puberty can't consent. While there are people who are adults who haven't gone through puberty, for whatever reason, who are mentally developed who can consent. The whole distinction of puberty and who is or isn't a pedophile or an ephebophile is a biological distinction, but not a very good moral or ethical one, since puberty doesn't determine whether someone can consent. And if ephebophiles act on their attraction, it also hurts children.  I get the feeling that pedophilia refers to prepubescent children who are preteens, not people who are much older who haven't gone through puberty. But if pedophilia is about puberty and body hormones and type, at least for some pedophiles, rather than age. And you can call someone like that a pedophile. Then I would think that is the ethical answer to pedophilia, and that psychologists who deal with pedophiles should direct pedophiles to adults they can be attracted to, who can consent, rather than children.   As long as it's two adults consenting then I don't care who has been through puberty. Consent is what matters, not whether someone has gone through puberty or not because they delayed it.  Shouldn't the whole point of pedophilia being wrong be about the fact that children don't have enough memories or experiences to have informed consent, and not how fertile someone is or if they've gone through puberty or not? The whole point to me about the discussion of pedophilia is that children to be protected and kept from harm.  If someone has ""puberty blockers for life"" they will still become mentally mature adults who can still give informed consent. And that's what's most important and the part we should never forget about pedophilia. If pedophilia is all about fertility and puberty then it's not a very good word for describing morality or ethics. Because the concerns I have and would hope other people have, is the well being of children. And I don't think that telling children they have to go through puberty or any kind of puberty other than the kind of puberty they want to or feel they need to go through because of gender dysphoria, is good. I think that forcing a type of puberty on children, or puberty at all, is abusive. Just because someone's biology may have the tendency to put them through a certain type of puberty, doesn't mean that it's right for them."

GenderCynical,3cltev,ScabWingedAngel,6,Thu Jul 9 08:47:16 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that many TERFS find the 'truths' they've discovered, to be self evident, or evident. And the idea that a man or a boy has a penis and a woman or a girl has a vagina is common sense. And anything else going against that must be doing something akin to a white person pretending to being black, or a black person pretending to be white.  And they probably feel like a person on a path of feminist discovery must surely stumble upon these ideas, and find them sensible. But can't express them, because it's a social justice faux pas to do so.  They, or many, I mean, view themselves as true feminists who are willing to take a radical stance and not give into Patriarchal ideas, no matter the cost. And that other feminists would agree with them, if only their ideas didn't seem so radical and too egalitarian and not Patriarchal enough. And that other feminists don't agree with them, at least not publicly, because they want to have mainstream appeal and be accepted in the social justice movement.  It's of course frustrating, if you are a feminist, to be compared to groups you are ideologically the opposite of. TERFs and transfeminists in many cases are both each comparing each other to MRAs, reactionaries, and conservatives. And I'm sure this isn't fun for either side. When they aren't conservatives, and they are feminists, and they are social justice advocates just like we are.  Being marginalized in the social justice movement is nothing like transphobia, in that people are violent towards transpeople. While people are also violent against women and feminists in general, not just radical feminists. But I understand how it's frustrating to be marginalized in the social justice movement and feminist movement. Feeling like the movement you should feel fellowship with so often doesn't feel fellowship with you.   While being a feminist is a choice and being a homosexual or bisexual is not, I think a little bit of a comparison can be made. Not being accepted in the LGBT community isn't oppression, but it can be very frustrating for bisexuals like me, to not be accepted in a lot of the LGBT community and face biphobia. To feel like you're not accepted in straight society or the LGBT community. That it motivates many bisexual people to feel like we're more oppressed than homosexual people. Feeling like you don't have a real place of belonging.  Of course, if you're a part of an oppressed or marginalized group, feeling ousted or marginalized from the mainstream social justice movement if you want to be a social justice advocate, is going to be frustrating. And some people are going to make excuses and say they're more oppressed or that people secretly agree with them but can't. Making social justice faux pas is a real fear and I have it, too. Wanting to impress others you feel can and could understand and support you and your beliefs and cause.  TERFs have a clear personal understanding of what they think gender and biological sex is, and a framework based upon that for what oppression is. This seems very clear and obvious to them, so of course many other people should come to the same conclusions. So if someone challenges that framework, it must feel like, something is wrong, and that those people are challenging equality itself. Something they hold very dear. It could feel like there is a conspiracy of sorts that is suppressing their equality movement. Something that trivializes their struggle as ciswomen. An external force that wants to put them into a box they're not comfortable with, and they understand this external force as Patriarchy. In this case, this external force is excluding them, or helping to exclude them, from the wider social justice movement.  And to a very minor degree, they may have a point, even if they aren't right. It is scary to make social justice faux pas if you want to be a good ally and fit into intersectionality properly and not engage in horizontal oppression. And people can be very suspicious of your language sounding TERF like. I admit that some of the things TERFs say sometimes, really resonates with me, even as a transwoman. But it can be a little bit scary to express that because it can make me scared of how it will sound, and alienating potential allies. But for the most part, I've been very lucky and most social justice circles have been slightly suspicious of what I'm saying sounds, and mostly accepting. I've never been called a TERF, despite how many things TERFs have said I've sympathized with and agreed with.  I can definitely understand the fear, though, of possibly alienating potential allies, and having social justice beliefs, but also having unpopular beliefs within the social justice movement. And it's certainly possible that many people would downplay or pretend they don't have such unpopular beliefs. And who knows how many people that is. They've certainly gotten me to sympathize with some of the things they occasionally say, even if that's scary to say in many circles.   I don't know how many people that is that feel like me and to what extent we feel that way. I feel like it's surely a lot less that most TERFs probably feel about a silent majority who agrees with them. But I can understand a degree of what they're coming from. And I do personally feel like TERFs make a lot of good points, until it starts becoming overtly transphobic."
GenderCynical,3cltev,TiaraWay,3,Fri Jul 10 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"Nice reply! That definitely makes sense to me. Another thing along these lines that might be applicable here (it's certainly applicable in plenty of other situations) is a weird kind of effect that the formation of ""movements"" and things like that have. When people find themselves identifying with a lot of the things an ideologically-defined group says, to the point where they consider themselves a part of that group, this membership can be a part of their identity itself. The more worrying effect of this is that capital T ""truth"" begins to lose its value in terms of what people are willing to believe in; instead people will ask ""what do the people in this group believe?"" and then when they get that answer they'll adopt that belief regardless of how it meshes with their more deeply held ideas. Unfortunately this problem doesn't seem limited to any individual ideology, but I think I've seen this in action in some of the things I've read from TERFs. No doubt the social pressure you've described here has a hand in it too."
GenderCynical,3cltev,lecih,0,Sat Jul 11 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"Great response. Part of what horrifies me about TERFs is how they would otherwise be great people to have as part of the greater movement to abolish gender/sex-based oppression, but they focus so much on trans people and make us out to be agents of the Patriarchy that it turns me off from taking them seriously as allies in any fight. When they extend this to feminism as a whole, blasting other feminists for being accepting of transgender people, then they alienate those as well.  Aside from the transphobic stances like gender existentialism and ""all trans women are violent"", I actually like quite a bit of what they say they stand for. Most of them are good people. They just hold the wrong views."

Puberty is not a sacredly scheduled divine occurrence. Presently (in the U.S., at least), puberty is happening earlier than at any point in history. For most of us, our bodies mature a full decade earlier than our minds. There are social costs to this. It is not ""natural"" or good just because it's endogenous.   Why are TERFs obsessed with making sure 11-year olds can reproduce?"
GenderCynical,3cc5tv,Ebomb1,2,Mon Jul 6 23:18:24 2015 UTC,Yeah... I've always found something distinctly creepy about the way these people revere puberty and talk about it as if it's magical.

GenderCynical,3cc5tv,domirossi,18,Tue Jul 7 10:46:27 2015 UTC,"I'd love for a trans activist to address this. But I know they won't.   How are children with gender dysphoria handled and will they regret it?  It is a fact that the vast majority of children diagnosed with gender dysphoria will not have it persist into adulthood.   This is backed up by these two studies:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697020/  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194003  However, the vast majority of kids diagnosed with gender dysphoria are not ever given hormone therapy, here is the current method of handling these children in medicine:  First the child needs to decide that he or she wants to be the opposite sex and he/she needs to present as the opposite gender. No one is diagnosed with gender dysphoria if they have no desire to change genders, that would be ridiculous.  Then, the parent takes them to a psychologist and they diagnose them with gender dysphoria. The standard is very high when compared with the standard of adults:   ""In order for someone to be diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria today, they must exhibit a strong and persistent cross-gender identification (not merely a desire for any perceived cultural advantages of being the other sex). In children, the disturbance is manifested by six (or more) of the following for at least a 6-month duration:""  ""1. repeatedly stated desire to be, or insistence that he or she is, the other sex""  ""2. in boys, preference for cross-dressing or simulating female attire; in girls, insistence on wearing only stereotypical masculine clothing""  ""3. strong and persistent preferences for cross-sex roles in make-believe play or persistent fantasies of being the other sex""  ""4. a strong rejection of typical toys/games typically played by one’s sex.""  ""5. intense desire to participate in the stereotypical games and pastimes of the other sex""  ""6. strong preference for playmates of the other sex""  ""7. a strong dislike of one’s sexual anatomy""  ""8. a strong desire for the primary (e.g., penis, vagina) or secondary (e.g., menstruation) sex characteristics of the other gender""   http://psychcentral.com/disorders/gender-dysphoria-symptoms/  So to recap, the child needs six of these symptoms and they need to be stable for 6 months. Now lets look at adults:   ""A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months duration, as manifested by 2* or more of the following indicators: [2, 3, 4]""  ""1. a marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or, in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics) [13, 16]""  ""2. a strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s experienced/expressed gender (or, in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics) [17]""  ""3. a strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender""  ""4. a strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)""  ""5. a strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)""  ""6. a strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)""   http://www.ifge.org/302.85_Gender_Identity_Disorder_in_Adolescents_or_Adults  In adults, only two symptoms that persist for 6 months are required. So the standard is much higher for children.  Then the child presents as the opposite gender until the age of puberty, by that time many of these children drop out of their diagnosis, however the remaining children are very scared of going through their normal puberty. If a trans child goes through it, he/she will no longer be able to pass as the other gender. Their friends and everyone around them will see them as cross dressers and they would be mistreated, causing significant emotional damage. The rate of children dropping out of their diagnosis is still high so medical professionals still do not want to administer hormone therapy. So here is what they do: they delay their puberty with medications.   The child (now a teenager) is able to continue passing as the opposite gender and is given more time to decide. Delaying puberty is relatively harmless, at any point the teenager can decide to stay their gender and go off the treatment and gain fertility.   Then this continues until the age of 16. By this time, the vast majority of these children have dropped out. The ones left have around 7-10 years of experience of being the opposite gender and not rejecting it. At the age of 16, doctors are finally comfortable with the regret rate to administer hormone therapy.   According to a statement by the University of California San Fransisco, gender dysphoria at this point persists into adulthood nearly 100% of the time:   ""Concurring on this matter, UCSF states that the small amount of data collected ""supports the notion that gender constancy is certainly in place in adolescence."" They find that adolescents who present with a transgender identity go on to be transgender adults ""100 percent of the time.""""   http://www.medicaldaily.com/transgender-youth-are-puberty-blocking-drugs-appropriate-medical-intervention-247082  Most of the effects of this hormone therapy are reversible. However the infertility is not, but at a low regret rate and with the informed consent of the patient, who is now 16, this is acceptable.  So treating gender dysphoria in children is far more about weeding out those who aren't serious than administering hormone therapy. These doctors have good intentions, they want to avoid the permanent negative effects of hormone therapy if the patient truly doesn't want it.  I've taken most of my information from this source:  https://www.endocrine.org/sitecore%20modules/web/~/media/endosociety/Files/Publications/Clinical%20Practice%20Guidelines/Endocrine-Treatment-of-Transsexual-Persons.pdf#search=%22transsexual%22"

Leaving aside the various problematic things that radical feminism has done to the gay movement (appropriating lesbianism and using it to try to drive the lgbtq movement's agenda, opposing (sometimes violently) lesbian expressions of love that were viewed as anti-feminist, trying to drive a wedge between the homosexual men and women so ""male homosexuality's systematic misogyny didn't corrupt lesbianism"").  Trans people have been part of the movement from the beginning. The entire point of the movement's solidarity is group society labeled as freaks fighting for acceptance and the right to live their lives.   You don't get to declare war on part of the lgbtq movement and expect the rest to not react with hostility because your movement was friends* with us during the 70s.

You can't change that, we're just using accurate terms in a non-insulting way.   . I am a lesbian. I will not be re-classified by men who “feel like” women.

That is my personal preference, and just like you accuse trans women of scrutinizing lesbian sexuality to make lesbians who aren't interested want to fuck them (which doesn't make sense at all), you do not get to say that my sexuality is not valid or ""pornified"" because I was born with a birth defect just because you don't like seeing trans women at all and would rather have us dead than happy. We're going to live. Even with our suicide rates, we won't crumble so easily at the hands of people like you.  And you want to know something about sex work? Trans women are a niche industry. People pay through the fucking nose to have a ""shemale"" penetrate them. And there are trans women who are forced into using the genitals they hate in a way that makes them feel awful every fucking day. It's very common for trans women to prostitute themselves or go into porn so they can eat.  If I were a dominant, you would use that to invalidate my gender. If I were a switch, you would say it's a sex thing. If I were asexual, you would say I'm either forcing a stereotype of women as prudes or trying to escape being gay. But if I have even the slightest bit of sex drive, I'm automatically a dangerous pervert.  And you do not get to appropriate the gender spectrum to deny trans people their identity. That was made to accept non-binary trans people as well as people who fit into a binary of identity, and you will not shit in the face of our genderqueer siblings.

GenderCynical,3c41xa,Ebomb1,3,Mon Jul 6 23:05:57 2015 UTC,"I saw the thread title and thought someone might be arguing that women who are flat chested or small breasted are less women. I would be really disappointed, if so, because while I disagree with that a lot of trans exclusionary gender critical people say, I've luckily never met or come across a TERF who has said that you need to have breasts to be a woman, or that breasts make you any more or less of a woman.  One thing I don't understand is, if you want gender abolitionism, how does discouraging people from taking hormones help that? Being able to take hormones or delay puberty or things like that means having bodily autonomy and individual freedom and agency.  Yes, children are young, and can't consent to a lot of things. But if children aren't allowed to take their development into their own hands, puberty will arbitrarily do it for them. Children should at least have some agency and autonomy in the kinds of things that hormones or a lack of hormones does to their bodies. There's nothing ""crazy"" or wrong about allowing an 11 year old access to estrogen. Especially if they are unhappy with what masculine hormones like testosterone are doing to their bodies.  Believing that gender identity is harmful to gender equality, and is a Patriarchal social construct that reinforces gender roles and gender stereotypes is one thing. But being against people having agency in their own hormones and bodies is another, and doesn't do anything to promote gender roles or stereotypes. It's just bodily autonomy. I can't think of anything more feminist than giving people agency and autonomy in their own bodies rather than letting puberty dictate their hormones and bodies for them.  I wish I could have had access to this sort of thing when I was a child and desperately wish I could go back in time and make things right for me and my body. I have always been deeply unhappy with what puberty has done to my body, and if I had known I could have, I would have delayed and muted puberty as much as I could have.  It's not my or anyone's responsibility to go through puberty, a certain type of puberty, or certain hormone levels. And that's my bodily autonomy that should be respected, that has nothing to do with reinforcing gender roles or gender stereotypes.  This seems like taking choice and autonomy from people who deserve it. And valuing of traditional notions of development, what puberty normally does to people's bodies without personal choice and freedom involved. And the valuing of fertility and reproduction. And I can't think of anything more un-feministic than valuing someone's fertility or traditional bodily development over their own personal choice, agency, and freedom. To be forced to have a body and a body type for others is oppression."
GenderCynical,3c41xa,TiaraWay,3,Wed Jul 8 03:32:06 2015 UTC,"When it comes to children, most people (including TERFs) deny them any agency or autonomy at all on the basis of incomplete physical and mental maturity. Children are too prone to suggestion or coercion from others, especially authority figures so there is a distinct worry that children are being pushed into a path they don't really want or that is healthy for them. Couple this with a lack of trust in the medical establishment and you have a recipe for this position that we're ""transing"" kids and irrevocably ruining their lives."
GenderCynical,3c41xa,maybeayri,2,Wed Jul 8 13:17:27 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand that perspective, children are definitely open to suggestion and especially from figures of authority.   What I don't understand is so much distrust for medical establishment or children and their stories of dysphoria not being believed. And people insisting that children are being pressured into hormone therapy and things like that.  Many children are insisting about dysphoria and a need for help, despite transphobia from parents and other family members, and psychologists and therapists and others alike.  I definitely understand concerns related to consent and maturity. But there's also a degree of agency children should be allowed to decide for themselves. And with transitioning, hormone therapy, and delaying puberty, this is what in many cases these children are insisting, not being pressured to do.  If anything, society and establishment that is pressuring people not to transition. I don't see how TERFs don't realize this."
GenderCynical,3c41xa,TiaraWay,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"If anything, society and establishment that is pressuring people not to transition. I don't see how TERFs don't realize this.   Right?! I get that the media makes this impression that everyone's suddenly super-accepting and actively encouraging and all that, but the reality is that those are exceptions to the rule, which is why they're newsworthy to begin with. My sisters all ruthlessly gender police their children and only one of them is doing any part of it consciously. The rest are simply carrying on what they have been taught via clothing, sports segregation (girls have to play softball rather than baseball, really?), and toys. I'm incredibly thankful that none of my nieces and nephews seem to be transgender - I'd hate to see what would happen then.  This is even without mentioning the policing kids get from their own classmates still. So when a child is deliberately bucking all that and insisting on being able to change, I think it's something that merits some action other than suppression. Not all of them turn out to be trans, but for those that do, such support while young is invaluable.  The first generation of kids really getting this kind of support from parents, like Jazz, are going to be growing into adulthood during the next decade. Once that happens, this whole thing is going to take on a whole different look as they settle into that stage of their lives. It'll be interesting because as TERFs like to point out, there's no long term studies available on childhood transition. This is new territory, medically and socially."
GenderCynical,3c41xa,maybeayri,2,Wed Jul 8 18:31:38 2015 UTC,"Sadly, TERFs don't value agency or choice on the individual level, or even on a social group level, at least not on topics related to gender. They're all too happy to sacrifice the agency of trans people in order to try and further stabilize and uphold the sex binary. To them, doing so is worth the consequences of trans people's dysphoria and social stigmas driving us to suicide, or putting us at risk of harm, poverty, etc.   They're desperately clinging onto worn out narratives that uphold what they believe women are, and are willing to say or do whatever is necessary to uphold that. Even though, as you note, hormones don't buy into gender roles or stereotypes, they're still of the mind that since one's sex cannot be changed, that no one should be allowed to try and muddy the waters...that males are males and females are females, both distinct classes, and both which should remain pure and unmodified. And that attempts to change sex are just really (at least for trans women and amab NB folk) modes of fetishization of the female form, or (for trans men and afab NB folk) an attempt to gain male privilege.  So yeah, they don't care about autonomy or agency unless it's reproductive autonomy. And even then, only when it comes to choices over giving birth or not, rather than fertility as a whole (which is why they're so clearly against trans boys getting access to puberty blockers being denied 'motherhood' and all that jazz)"

Girls usually start developing around then, at least partly. Hell, girls are getting their period earlier, and so they're going to start having breasts or least starting to swell up, they will be buying bras and starting to get into all of the (unfortunate, IMHO) sexualization stuff. At some point the majority of the girls are going to be wearing things that need some level of breasts to fill them out, while this kid?  ...flat as a board, because he's not actually a girl. Even if they don't manage to figure out that he's trans (which is probably guaranteed to happen now that he's been on Frontline) they will think he's a ""child"" while they're all ""maturing."" And anyone who actually spent time growing up as a girl knows that is not an easy road either.

The major problem with this is a common one in that sub. They're placing a view on something then assuming that we have the same view.  Here's the rundown: They believe trans women are men. They also believe that placing a more specific identifier before the word ""women"" makes it less valid. They believe we share this view. Ergo, when trans women refer to women as cis women, they question the validity of her womanhood. Except we don't since we don't see ourselves as men and use the identifiers to be more inclusive by using the word ""women"" in both instance.

What reason do you have to believe that it's a woman-directed insult in essence, rather than just coincidentally/statistically? feminists tend to be women more often than men and if the number of trans exclusionary feminist women is the same proportion in comparison to trans exclusionary feminist men, we wouldn't be surprised to find that it's mostly women getting called TERFs.  I'm gonna use an inflammatory example here and compare the word ""nazi"". People are usually called nazis in today's dialogue when they're really racist or something like that, and the fact of the matter is that most people worthy of being called nazis are going to be white. However, this isn't enough of a reason to say that nazi is a white-aimed insult. We could only say that TERF is a female-directed insult if womanhood is semantically essential to the term but this doesn't seem to be the case from my experience with it at all.

GenderCynical,3bzfkq,lockedge,4,Sun Jul 5 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"To them, no-platforming is abuse. So when they're defined as TERFs and get kicked from private venues that were to host their events, they consider that abuse. When someone posts on Tumblr, asking someone not to reblog from a TERF user, that's abuse. When a TERF invades a discussion on trans folks' rights and someone dismisses them as a TERF and a transphobe, that's abuse.  Of course, if TERF views were much, much more popular, and socially acceptable, TERF wouldn't be considered a slur to them at all. It'd be a badge of honour, much like folks wearing/displaying the confederate flag felt about that during the civil rights movement. It's only that their views aren't popular that they're complaining and calling it a slur, because no one wants to listen to them, and people often dismiss them out of hand. They deem this silencing, but when folks know their platform well, and know their views & ideology, and know the TERF will be speaking to their feminist rhetoric, it's hardly silencing to dismiss them when they bring nothing new to the table, nothing that hasn't already been dissected, assessed, and ruled unfounded.   It'd be like a creationist complaining of abuse because education boards brusquely and offhandedly denied implementing creationism in science curricula.   Past these possibilities, the person could be referencing posts like ""Ugh, TERFS are shit"", and claiming that because there are a number of posts like this, that TERF is a slur and a form of abuse in and of itself. This is, of course, blatantly far from the truth to those who understand how words work (otherwise, 'cop', 'politician', 'democrat', 'republican', 'teacher', 'slow driver', etc. would be slurs), but TERFs have had the tendency to be selectively critical, so I suppose it's not outside of the realm of possibility that they think this way,"
GenderCynical,3bzfkq,AutumnLily11,3,Sun Jul 5 05:36:04 2015 UTC,"It really becomes clear to me that what the show to be their form of critical thinking isn't critical at all but falls intk the same tired traps we all fall intk when trying to navigate the world in general. Thinking that TERF is a slur point this out simply because it's essentially trying to lass the blame of their own shitty behaviour onto trans persons because we just happen to use it the most because the things they do affect us the most.  But to go further, they behave like children at the best of times. When they aren't getting their way they resort to name calling (quite viciously since they are well aware of the fact that the words they are using have negative effects) and then essentially they say ""We only call then that becauss they call us TERFS"" Even though that's not remotely true, since they use violent words (oh which by the way they say they don't, misgendering, trans slurs (that dont need repeated) and twisting medical terms (MtF is used by my doctors, it's a medical term that they need to differentiate my care needs from say my cis girlfriend) ) all the damn time.  It is a lot like my four year old, when he gets into trouble he will try to redirect the blame anywhere else that he can. Sometimes it was some imaginary boogeymans fault, sometimes its even my fault (for upsetting him by giving him into trouble for something) but even then my son will either eventually accept the blame for ripping up his new books or whatever, or accepts it without all the redirection. TERFs seem to be incapable of seeing the flaws and fault in their on philosophies and ideology. I have noted before that there is a desperate need for gender critical feminism, or just even gender critical thoughts external to any movement, however what TERFs hold up on high isn't gender critical. It might brush the surface but it usually veers off into gender essentialism or simply anti-trans ideology (I think I would go so far as to say it might even be anti-transhumanism, there might be an ick factor to them over the concept of humanity steering towards almost complete autonomy (think cyberkinetic upgrades, getting to choose your gender, that sort of thing) which isn't widely accepted at the moment if I recall correctly)"
GenderCynical,3bzfkq,lockedge,4,Mon Jul 6 14:37:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I often wonder what impact Catholicism and a lot of that new-agey spiritualist stuff from the 60s and 70s had on the foundation of gender critical writings, because there's so many signs of puritanism in early radical feminism, and there's so much of that ""your body is sacred, we need to go back to the 'natural' ways of the earth and simpler lives"" stuff that ties in with a lot of what I see in TERF rhetoric. So many TERFs I've seen online are against most forms of body modification, so many are the type of eco-feminists who think if everyone lived off the grid, social oppressions would collapse, so many feel that the ability to give birth is sacred and spiritual, and must be protected, and a good number of TERF political lesbians I've come across have been the type of sex-negative feminists that believe all sex is oppressive, but at least something pure like life can come out of it (which gives me flashbacks of victorian era morality around acceptable women's sexuality being that they're not supposed to feel pleasure, or want sex, but only to reproduce).   And I'm not about to say there aren't any TERFs out there capable of critical thought, that most aren't already aware of the theological influences on the writing that forms the base of their beliefs, but...I'd wager there's still a lot who haven't made those connections. And that's a little scary to see a lot of the same oppressive century old religious views get translated into some form of feminist discourse. Like...even when folks push for how we can come to abolish gender, actual directions or a series of actions leading towards that goal...there's nothing offered that's so different than the religious holy land of heaven, full of possibilities and what ifs, and hypotheticals, and assurances that everything will be better/fixed/pure, but nothing solid that can lead to that state. And the whole TERF standard operating procedure of wishing and praying for gender abolition to happen miraculously, and the whole shaming of 'sinners' or 'messengers of Satan' (cis men and trans women, in their eyes), the talk of trans women being wolves in sheeps clothing, etc. all has me wondering if that's just the greater social influence of religion talking, or is it the religious influences of their chosen texts speaking.  I mean, there's a reason i've decided to largely avoid arguing with TERFs...they're deeply ideological. They hold onto their texts, ones that have remained the same for decades now without change, and assume them to be fact above all else. For them to be above scrutiny. That's faith. And faith is not rational, it's not something a person can realistically be argued away from.  Note that I'm not shaming the religious here, just noting that deeply held beliefs that have been positioned as objective, core truths of life itself are very hard to think critically about. And TERFs, in turn, have a tremendous time being critical of their own texts, of their own feminism, and that makes them so illogical and frustrating. Nothing they believe has to make sense, their arguments don't have to have any basis outside of their belief system. And that makes them dangerous, given they're sometimes used as a sounding board by media on gender and trans-related issues."
GenderCynical,3bzfkq,AutumnLily11,3,Sat Jul 4 22:14:05 2015 UTC,"I am very much in agreement. Though there som real fanatacism and obsession. They seem more like religious zealots that your average person of faith.  Faith can have its place in the world, it can work miracles in the sense that it can help someone who is suffering deal with the pain and trauma (and then there's the positive mentality theory in dealing with particularly bad diseases).  To be honest, I don't deal with the concept of religious faith, I tend to stay at 'ground level' i.e. I need to see it, interact with it to be able to 'believe' in it (I feel the word believe is disingenous. I don't 'believe' in science, I percieve and understand science. Though there are metaphysical components at times (quantum physics sometimes requires a metaphysical leap or understanding to really grasp some of the more obtuse/abstract(/esoteric even))  Also the concept of not being able to accept that I am wrong, or that I could be wrong is foreign to me. I have been proven wrong more times than I have been proven right (the joys of youth) so that's enough to know that often times I need to be flexible in my opinions and be critical of any evidence that is shown to me. Just accepting things at face value is never enough and it shouldn't be.  I want to talk about the SCOTUS ruling on same sex marriage for a moment, as an example of this 'on the face of it' belief. A lot of people I know thought that this ruling in favor of same sex marriage (or rather the fact that banning any marriage is against the 14th ammendment) was the end of LGBT activism. Whereas we know from experience it's not, and there are others still that realise that as well. Essentially my point is this, this 'on the face of it' style of reasoning is lazy at best and dangerous at its worst, it leads to cognitive dissonance (women shouldn't be meek and its not an inherent trait etc but if a trans women talks up for herself its male violence and abuse and is inherent to men) abusive behaviours (words can be violent, as can derailing tactics etc) and its all a conclusion of blind faith, or maybe better to say zealotry?"

GenderCynical,3bzfkq,doodlebug_firefy,10,Fri Jul 3 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no.  Plenty of them recognize being a transsexual woman is a thing, but they have very strict criteria for it and they simply won't recognize the result of the transition process as a woman (assuming they recognize them - they seem to think all trans women can be spotted with 100% accuracy). Those that fit their narrow definition worthy of primarily pity and treated as if they were suffering from a severe mental illness. ""Oh, that poor guy had to undergo radical treatment and surgery just to feel right in his body.""  What they don't accept is, well, the rest of the transgender population. They seem genuinely confused by the thought process many of us go through to arrive at transitioning to the other gender or going for an androgynous presentation. Not every trans woman has crippling dysphoria right out of the gate nor does every trans woman want to go through HRT and surgery. While they can somewhat wrap their heads around a severe mental illness, they can't understand why anyone else would go through the same process without falling into that strict criteria, much less do it openly.  They long for the days when trans women furtively begged for hormones and surgeries, abandoned their former lives entirely, and were just basically invisible. It led to less questioning of the black-and-white gender binary and they could pretend those those transsexuals were all just highly gay men without any pushback.  Addendum: You may have noticed I didn't mention trans men once. That's intentional because as far as these people are concerned, trans men don't exist and those women that go for it are either traitors to the cause or victims of Stockholm Syndrome or something equally ridiculous."
GenderCynical,3bzfkq,claimstoknowpeople,10,Fri Jul 3 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"""Oh, that poor guy had to undergo radical treatment and surgery just to feel right in his body.""   They generally disapprove of SRS--most of the people on gender critical believe that since transgenderism is a mental disorder, it's natural to rely on psychological means to fix it; i.e. conversion therapy.

GenderCynical,3bzfkq,Death2Evil,-9,Fri Jul 3 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"It's like calling a woman a potato, you're assigning nonsense terms to her to take away her femininity."
GenderCynical,3bzfkq,dysphoricfoot,15,Fri Jul 3 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"It's actually an affirmation of her femininity as a core aspect of who she is, at least insofar as her femininity relates to her body. For example, I have a bunch of sisters. They are all very different personalities and range all along the spectrum from highly femme to tomboy. Each and every one of them expresses their physical femininity in different ways.  When I tell you that they are all cis women, I am not taking away from any of that. I am not saying that they are less of a woman in any way. All I am saying is that each and every one of them has no qualms about whether or not they belong in their bodies. Yes, all of them have parts of their bodies they would like to change - one constantly complains about her nose and how she can't seem to get to her target weight, another struggles with her post-pregnancy belly, another has been dancing the line between healthy and anorexia for years, etc. What makes them cis is that their core physical identity is still female. They are comfortable with having a vagina, breasts, hips, and all that.  I, on the other hand, struggle with a strong mismatch between what my body is and how I feel it should be. I have not started any sort of transition or even therapy yet so I can't speak with total certainty that the results of transitioning are what I want. What I can tell you is that when I view myself as a woman (mentally because I'm a fat fuck with no money to even pretend to crossdress), it feels ... better, like it's closer to the truth than being a man. I'm happier when I can picture myself as if I were physically a woman. When I came to this realization, that first month was one spent in constant euphoria and I actually overcame my depression and general lethargy for the first time in a long time. It was enough of a change that my mom pinned me down and started asking me what the hell was going on.  I'll be the first to admit that I have self-image issues. I've been overweight since early in high school. I'm nearly deaf. I retreated almost entirely from a social life into one filled with books and video games and just physically ballooned up. I recognized the health issues that could potentially come up and I would try to fight it, but the best I could really do was slow it down. I started reversing it when I was diagnosed with cancer but I still felt stuck, just with a renewed sense of failure at accomplishing anything of note. There are two really positive things that came out of that (really brief) fight with cancer: I promised myself that I would never attempt suicide and that I should do my best to pursue what makes me happy, not just what provides for a financially secure future.  I honestly think I have found one way to make me happier with my body and that route involves transitioning. It's scary. And weird. I constantly wonder, like my mother consistently says, if I'm just going for it because I want to feel like I belong somewhere. I constantly wonder if I'm just grasping at straws for something, anything, in order to find a way out of a life that seems increasingly grey, mundane, and filled with disappointment. To alleviate this and because it's necessary for me to do anyways, I'm losing weight and getting fit. I'm focusing on what physical changes I really want, not clothes, not gender roles or expressions. All HRT and surgery will do is make me look more like a woman. Do I want that?  Then I constantly ask myself if I'm okay with losing the male privileges I enjoy, with opening myself to more dangerous situations and to more discrimination, and with the expectations that come with being a woman in today's society? The answer is always yes, if it means finding some peace with my body. I inhabit my body and if I'm constantly distracted about what I don't like about my body, I can't focus on the activities that make me happy and on finding people that make me happy. I can't ignore it. It's too much.   And yes, I'm aware that being a trans woman doesn't make me the kind of woman that you are. I wasn't socialized as a girl, made to wear pretty dresses, given dolls, or allowed to grow my hair out. I didn't go through female puberty when I was in middle school, having to deal with that day you find yourself bleeding from your crotch, dealing with growing breasts, and wondering how to deal with increasingly sexualized language and encounters from other people. I didn't have to internalize the standards of female beauty in the same way you did. I don't have to deal probing questions from family about when I'm going to settle down and have a family because you know that clock is ticking! I never have to deal with cat-calls, condescending remarks about how I should smile more, and the expectation that I'm there to serve men in some respect.  Some of those things are universal enough to being seen as a woman that I will run into them myself in the future and it will be confusing, disgusting, and will probably make me second-guess my choice to transition if it turns out to be bad enough. Some of those, I will never experience and it honestly makes me sad. These includes even the negatives that I see so many radfems say that trans women are happy to avoid. I'd love to have such a completely female body that I have to deal with periods, vaginal maintenance, and the whole childbirth thing. I would have really liked it if I was born a girl in the first place. It's not rainbows and unicorn farts, but life in general is not rainbows and unicorn farts and I would rather deal with the struggles of being a cis woman from the start than to deal with the struggles of being a trans woman in my late twenties and early thirties.  In the end, I can't really choose not to feel this way. I didn't choose to have to deal with depression since I hit puberty. I didn't choose to feel so disconnected with my male body that I would much rather make it female just to feel I physically belong again. I'm not your stereotypical ""I always knew from the age of five"" transgender person that snuck in my mother's or sister's closet to wear their dresses, shoes, and makeup. This is the result of a long personal journey involving deep reflection, hard questions, and an intense desire to achieve a basic state of happiness that seems to be conspicuously absent from my life.   So that is what makes me transgender. That's why calling you a cis woman isn't an insult or an attempt to take away from your femininity. It's a simple affirmation that you are a woman who is comfortable being a woman in whatever manner you choose to express that. I can't say the same for me being a man and so I can't call myself a cis man anymore than you can call yourself a man at all."

But you are also saying that these differences have meaning and significance in the way we organize society. We need to create defined categories and police the boundaries with social rules.  This is exactly what a social construct is!  The socially agreed upon values and meanings of a thing and the rules and beliefs we use to enforce those meanings.  When the thing we are ascribing values and meaning to is physical sex then the social construct you are creating is gender!    The fact that you place all this meaning on physical sex and then tell me you are for abolishing gender makes me think you are disingenuous.  That you are only using ""gender abolition"" justification for the prejudice beliefs you hold about people like me.

GenderCynical,3blgqm,NowThatsAwkward,11,Tue Jun 30 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"There's credible research about the long term psych effects of physiological trauma, and surgery is a known cause. But (you knew there was a but) it tends to be surgeries that are unplanned, unwanted, have severe post-op complications, that happen with dubious consent (children who can't really understand what's going on and such), or are preceeded by extremely frightening or disorienting circumstances. With the exception of complications, none of those apply to transition-related surgeries.   Basically she's blowing smoke out her ass about ""spiritual wounds"" implying that on some level our brains recognize we've made a huge mistake and that gives us all PTSD."

Being transgender isn't used as an escape from the military, the military is used as an escape from being transgender.  For any lurkers from the other subreddit, there are a good number of trans women who go into the military as a form of regression. It does have to do with masculinity, just not in the way you think it does. The idea these women have is that by enlisting in the military, they'll be so surrounded by ""guy-stuff"" that they'll internalize it and stop wanting to transition. But it doesn't work.  Now that we as a society are starting to have a better understanding of transgender people and are becoming more tolerant, these women are starting to come out of the closet while they're still in service.  How is it GenCrit can come so close to understanding, but then hook so far to the right and then think things for us are the opposite?"

GenderCynical,3bgyd7,ramen_diet,2,Mon Jun 29 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"I imagine that for people who still that transwomen aren't real women when the technology exists, that the thing you're saying about appropriation and moving the goalposts is probably right.  A lot of TERFs compare gender to race, ethnicity, and culture, and see being transgender as a kind of ""gender appropriation"", and fetishization of an oppressed class. Personally, I think if we're going to talk about gender in a way similar to cultural appropriation or cultural appreciation, I think that being transgender is more similar to gender appreciation than appropriation. But it seems like a lot of TERFs don't see it that way.   To be honest, appropriation is one of the more confusing parts of social justice to me, I agree that trivializing parts of other people's culture and mimicking it in a shallow and insincere way, or mocking it, is incredibly mean and insensitive and hurtful. I don't like it when people mock and trivialize and disrespect other cultures. And I don't think that imitation is always the most sincere form of flattery.  That being said, I think that a lot of people mistake cultural appropriation for cultural appreciation. And it makes me uncomfortable, because there are people who have been called out in very rude, and even violent and cruel ways over the subject of cultural appropriation and being blamed of that, when what they were actually doing was appreciating. If people can't appreciate or feel free to appreciate other cultures, then that's just separatism, and it encourages ethnocentrism, because sharing culture encourages empathy between people. And I can't think of anything socially just about ethnocentrism or misusing the idea of appropriation to blame people who appreciate as appropriating.  I feel like it hurts and trivialized the actual idea of appropriation when people call things that are appreciation as appropriation. Like people who call cultural appreciation, cultural appropriation instead. Or blaming transgender people of appropriation. It trivializes actual appropriation when people use it as an excuse to be ethnocentic and against multiculturalism, or be very transphobic.  I think that also, you're right about socialization, and that many TERFs would say that, since transgender people have had ""lived experiences"" or ""socialized as male"" that we don't fully understand the female struggle and can't be women. And it's true that people who have been socialized as boys have had different experiences than ciswomen, even if that socialization was very painful and unwanted. But that seems like letting your past define you. Just because transwomen don't know what it's like to be assigned female at birth and be treated certain ways because of it, being a transwoman means that you will start to have female or girl or woman socialization after a point because people will look at you as a woman. I don't think you have to be socialized as a woman your whole life to understand what it's like to be socialized as a woman. And this argument, to me, seems like letting someone's past define them. And that things can't change.  To me, what some ""crossdressers"" or ""drag queens"" do sometimes, seems far more like mockery and gender appropriation than being transgender. Sometimes people, when they take on an appearance people associate with another gender and pass, do it in a mocking fashion. I don't think this is all people who identify as queens or crossdressers, and it would be terrible to discourage cisgender people from defying gender roles. But I've noticed that for some people, it seems less like an expression of their femininity, and more like a mockery of women, and wearing the idea of a woman as a costume to trivialize women.  I don't feel like that's what being transgender is, though. And I wish people wouldn't use the word appropriation so easy and discourage appreciation."

GenderCynical,3bgyd7,Skeptekr,2,Mon Jun 29 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"In that case, why do they care if ""men"" appropriate it?

A girl who was seemingly a TERF (it was a 2nd year course, so most students were super young, I'll usually cut people some slack because they're learning) went on this angry rant about how trans women are men, and how trans people mutilate themselves, and that there needs to be a focus on ""self-acceptance"" and fixing ""severe mental delusions"" that make trans women ""predatory invaders"".  I was too stunned by the bullshit to respond fast enough, but the other trans woman classmate of mine offered up a simple ""Are fucking kidding me with that?"" with a clear frustration and confusion. Which, of course, turned into the TERFy girl repeatedly petitioning the teacher in response to keep the classroom discussion free of ""violent male aggression"" while on the topic.   Like...it's just bizarre. Entirely bizarre that they think they can throw around words like mutilate, delusion, predatory, invaders...all with definite negative connotations...and think they should be safe from the tiniest hostility. Meanwhile, someone says the word 'fucking' as an amplifier to express their disbelief, and they're loudly misgendered and silenced? What?  It's ridiculous how they can frame reasonable responses to their absurdity into supposedly 'violent attacks'. Just ridiculous."

It wasn't a sexual thing for us, we just liked terrorizing the people who usually pushed us around.  But we certainly didn't think we were women, nor did we tell our girlfriends they had to accept us women. We just borrowed their dresses and their makeup and stole shit for them.

As well as questioning gender identity and it being valid, is kind of interrogative.   However, a lot of TERFs do turn being female and a ciswoman into an exclusive treehouse club. Saying that you have to have a vagina and xx chromosomes to be in women's spaces or to call yourself a feminist. I've seen many TERFs say that, not only can people who were assigned male at birth not come to women's spaces, but that people 'born male' can't call themselves feminists, because that's appropriating the women's struggle. And they should call themselves feminist allies.  That sounds very exclusive club and treehouse-esque to me."

GenderCynical,3atbif,ScabWingedAngel,16,Tue Jun 23 10:00:49 2015 UTC,"In my experience feminists who are trans exclusionary are usually very focused on the fact that gender roles are a social construct. They think transgender people reinforce those gender roles by saying they must be a certain gender to behave according to certain roles.   They fail to grasp that gender roles and gender identity are not the same thing, eg a transgender man may be extremely feminine when it comes to gender roles. People don't think they need to transition genders to suit their gender roles, that just doesn't happen.   As a result of this misconception TERFs are often angriest when a transgender person does present with conservative gender roles, which normally shouldn't really be a problem. A transgender woman posing for a glamour shoot they feel is setting women's liberation back."

Anyone who claims to be a transgender woman is a man who probably has non-normative sexuality (cf. Blanchard). I'm a conservative who's not particularly emotionally invested in either side of this debate. I think the gender identity/roles thing is beside the point though, because gender critical feminists really don't believe in gender identity as a useful category. It's all about biological sex."

As far as prejudice or hostile attitude against trans people goes, I haven't found many things to correlate with it (usually there are a good enough number of exceptions to destroy any link between a given trait and that), but one thing I have found that might, is sheer meanness or narrowness of mind, specifically I guess, a lack of empathy or relating to others."

Like if you had a cartoon gun that could transform them into someone else, so they'd have to live as that person for say a day or a week, or having to walk in their shoes, my understanding/philosophizing about this says that that should improve their meanness, but as to exactly what putting oneself into another's shoes improves, no idea really.

While most subreddits and LGBT groups claim to be inclusive, it seems to go unnoticed how much erasure goes on in the name of some feminist theories - ""biological sex is a construct"", ""IS is god-mode for transition"" etc. and it's terribly frustrating since there isn't a community for us, and the community that I do have seems to think my body is privileged in some fucked up way and thinks it's okay to use my body as a retroactive justification for trans identities, while providing nothing in return. Since I couldn't find an outlet for my frustration within the community, talking about, bringing up or otherwise naming the bullshit I saw, I turned to gender critical spaces and found a bunch of people who saw the same problems I saw - the language, the behavior, the constant lateral abuses i the name of social justice... cough viviphilia cough  Why am I no longer gender crit?  Because it's just not productive. I'm sure you've all noticed as members of this sub the insane amount of stupidity, double standard and half-truth that goes into forming a gender critical opinion. I have problems with the trans community, but I'm not prepared to start making stuff up to get angry. I think i reached breaking point when they started going after Jazz and all I could think was, ""this girl is 13 yo and these people are so jaded they're attacking a child."" Even if you consider the gender critical theory valid, you'd have to assume the parents pushed her into being transgender, which still doesn't make it her fault and these people still are mocking her... mocking a child... and that's not okay on any level.

One's a ~40yo single mom, one's my age but hispanic/white/black, another had thyroid issues that made her bones grow differently, and one is an alcoholic.

I have read one blog piece on intersex vs. Gender crit via trans politics. I believe basically this guy (was his definition of himself) decided to see why gender critical ideology was so popular with intersex persons and then looked at the whole thing with a critical lenss and concluded that gender critical ideology (as the movement is at the moment) was more damaging to intersex politics than was being shown, but it was a blog piece by one person, and I have a bias against gender critical (as the movement stands just now, I am fairly critical of gender stereotyping and forced roles, but I do believe gender identity (just another facet of our identity as a whole) is biological in that there is some neural construct (in combination with a faulty endocrine system) that results in conflicting identiy vs. Physical anatomy.

It was a very interesting piece, and it really made me think about the damage groups can do wether intentional or not, not just Gender critical in this situation.  As I had pointed out I don't necessarily disagree with gender critical in the sense of being critical of gender stereotypes, forces roles etc but the movement as it stands seems to outright ignore current medical recommendations (transition being the best for trans persons, and it seems that transition is also beneficial to intersex people at times) and they seem to be obsessed with the (false) concepts that trans women are violent or fixated on feminine gender roles, I say that as someone who finds themselves with no interest in either side of the stereotypical roles for either gender. I like what I like. I've stated elsewhere my problem is physiological, my body seems to be wired to expect a certain anatomy (womb, breasts etc etc) and them not being there which causes distress. I have no way of knowing the exact physical causes of this (I'm inclined to believe its proprioception, linked to neural wiring, but I have no way of really knowing that or investigating it) also the fact that I think all trans people are wired for one particular hormone (i.e. testosterone or estrogen) while running on the other and that itself causes physical issues in the brain (wiring that's expecting a particular hormone and not getting it becomes dull (much like how dopamine receptors in the brain dull with lack of sleep) and that leads to things like depression or something that is symptomatically similar. These are all just random thoughts though and I wish I had a way of funding a study or doing a study into these things  Sorry that was really tangental, but it happens a lot to me xD I really hope you find a good support group that can be supportive and helpful with any sort of medical transition you feel i necessary, and I'm sure you have a good support network already in terms of being intersex. I think there could be a lot of cross support between intersex and trans activist since medically we do end up going through a lot of similar things (for those itnersex people that need to transition from their assigned sex and for trans people that decide to transition). I am not for a second suggesting that the struggles and issues are the same, but sometimes we can face social stigmas and medical block that are similar.  You said you were and ex gender crit. How did you feel about their views on COINing? That's something that's interested me for a while,"
GenderCynical,3atbif,episplit,3,Wed Jun 24 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you have a good support network already in terms of being intersex   Nope lol. I have friends, but I also live in Utah, where I am the only one I know of, and the trans community was actually really shitty and self-centered about their treatment of me. I'm at the point where taking the time to look for supportive support groups is too much effort, and even then, I'm years in and 2months out from getting SRS - I'm not going to be around the community after that.    feel about their views on COINing?   That was one of the initial draws that I loved, and I still think it's a valid concept. One thing I see a lot of among activists in the trans community is a statement to the effect that there are xx men and xy women, therefore chromosomes don't matter, therefore there is no defining biological basis for sex, therefore transgender identities are somehow made more valid, since what is a man/woman anyway if it's not fixed in biology? Our hormones are good enough.  While ostensibly true, and I agree that phenotypic sex is more definitive of sex as we know it, hearing this constantly makes one think, ""well, you're using our conditions to justify your identity, so where's the activism done on our part for our problems?"" For which we see relatively little. It's partly a problem with the size of the intersex community, but when we see this coupled with so many trans people (women, mostly) either faking (or self-diagnosing) intersex to feel superior with no consequence from the trans community, it's easy to fall into the pattern of feeling victimized, or at least used by the community.   But the article that I linked addresses that more thoroughly than I can. COINing does need to stop."
GenderCynical,3atbif,AutumnLily11,3,Wed Jun 24 20:43:45 2015 UTC,"Understandable.  I really do hope that the trans community and the intersex community can be more unified (without either side being drowned out by the other (It seems to me that the intersex community has been getting the short end of the stick in this regard and I would love to see that stop)) since I do think there are a lot of social, mental and neurological similarities that need to be faced as a unified front.   And since trans people benefit from the same surgeries that benefit intersex persons then we need to fight harder for intersex identites to be acknowledged, accepted and celebrated as much as trans identites should be (both communities are clearly still fighting for recognition in their own rights) and it has to be seen that intersex and trans identites are just as valid as each other without being equated (i.e a transwoman is a woman as much as an intersex man is a man (if he chose to transition in that direction) and if someone chooses to be known as intersex, outside the sex binary then that needs to be accepted and is valid)  Funnily enough in terms of victimisation and the community in general, I personally feel fairly removed from it all. I reconise the violence that happens, I get angry at idiotic and/or ignorant statements, but I don't personally feel s though I am being attacked. Maybe because I am all but a hermit (excluding my imediate family; partner, son and doggy, I don't really socialise) and I've never really understood the need to feel like a victim. I've spent 90% of my life trying to escape labels that make me sound like a victim, clutching to an identity centred around that seems absolutely insane to me.  I hope surgery goes well, and having had surgery myself (not srs) I know that a support network is necessary for post-surgery is important and it is good you have friends to help"

The surgeries I have hade so far, 2 were minor (I say minor simply because they were easy to do and required little after care in terms of painkillers and antibiotics) but the 3rd surgery I had. Oh goodness, if I had been on my own I honestly think I would have died (that is not hyperbole, the infection I god from my 2nd surgery was mortally serious, and was caused by a realtively simple throat infection that ended up causing so many problems) eur... that was only meant as a confirmation that a support netword for post surgery is good xD not trying to be a terrifying idiot, which I have only just now realised.

After reading this:   The only healthy and feminist response to unhappiness with one's body presented is to learn to accept it as it is.   ...I'm starting to wonder if, with some TERFs, they hate their own bodies despite being cis, due to internalised misogyny due to the patriarchy, and they don't make the distinction between other people hating their bodies due to the patriarchy versus them hating their bodies because their bodies are not right for them as-is.  I did wonder how any intersex people could see TERFs as allies, given that they want to reinforce sex binaries and don't believe in body autonomy and consensual medicine and surgery.  This makes sense, thanks.  It sounds like TERFs use a combination of making up strawpeople trans arguments that would be bad if anyone actually believed them, mentioning how they don't like non-consensual surgeries and hormones, and glossing over how they don't like consensual ones either.

That is exactly what the claim is re: afab trans people. That everyone afab hates their bodies because patriarchy, therefore changing your body is capitulating/conforming. This goes for all basically all afab body mods, theoretically, but oddly, the miniscule number of afab trans people are the ones under the microscope as opposed to the far higher number of afab people who alter their bodies to make them more in line with patriarchal ideals.   I mean, if you want to attack a patriarcho-capitalist cabal, you could hardly ask for one more obvious than cosmetic procedures marketed to women. But it's much easier to wail and gnash teeth over me getting my boobs chopped off and taking medication that makes my belly furry. (because if there's anything that signifies conformance to the patriarchy it's being a boobless, furry woman by choice, and conformance is always easier than non-conformance!    But clucking at me doesn't require any actual work.  Edit to add: of course, I am using what would be their perception, not suggesting trans men are women."

While not being supportive of their politics and the way they conduct themselves, I can tell you first hand having had conversations (both in and out of pm) with these people that for the most part, I see the hurt and understand the rhetoric as projection. The 'female experience' and the pain of growing up as female they appeal to is largely their own experience manifest, and one could see how a very damaged or emotionally stunted individual might see MtF's as almost cheating the system by bypassing that painful timeperiod altogether.  But then you have your run of the mill mentally unhinged haters like Cathy Brennan, who populate a portion of any movement. Even in liberal feminism. But the point is, being confrontational only forces people who feel dejected and oppressed to dig into their politics harder. I think there's room for more conversation and empathy, and we have to be the first ones to try and understand them and offer them some of it.   strawpeople trans arguments   This is one of the things that put me off. There are no butch or gender variant trans people in gender critical theory because they allow for none in their characterizations. Every older trans woman is a crossdressing AGP who is unpassable. Every Teen-20's trans person is a rabid transactivist bent on enforcing their views through immature teenage male bullying. Every <15yo trans person was forced into it.   They actively consider those and only those trans people with contexts that are suitable focuses for their hate.    It frankly still amazes me that doctors need to be told such simple ethics as ""please help fix the bodies of people who do want it, and don't 'fix' the perfectly healthy bodies of people who don't want it"".   /u/Agnosticnixie made the point about being a hair away from testosterone treatment. I was put on testosterone treatment at 15. For about 6 months i got to deal with being the guinea pig for a doctor who reassured my parents that, though I had said I was trans, a round of T would fix that and my 'embarassing breast problem' (i.e. there was a time when lactation was a thing in my life).

The doctor told my mother I'd still be able to produce ""enough male hormone to make me a man"", in a misguided attempt at answering her question about whether the issue he was investigating had anything to do with how femme I was.

GenderCynical,3atbif,Ebomb1,2,Wed Jun 24 15:04:19 2015 UTC,"Apologies on behalf of the trans community for any and all erasure and bullshit you've experienced in the past. It would definitely be worth me pointing out why this can sometimes happen: jealousy and internalised transphobia. I think one of the biggest things is that people are generally more accepting of intersexuality than transgenderism; in discussions about transgenderism, people usually levy the ""You're a biologically normal X who just wants to be a Y; it's a psychological issue and isn't serious and I don't need to accept you"", usually with ""intersex people are the legit thing because there's definite signs of biological sex being mixed and so it's not at all like transgenderism"" in there somewhere. This really hurts and happens all the damn time, and it's thus no surprise that quite a few trans people try and justify things with intersex narratives, as it's less difficult to get by, and when your identity is not only constantly denied but also ruled as perverse or dishonest, you feel like you owe it to yourself. And then they get blasted for supposedly reappropriating another supposedly worse-off group. Likewise, although it's overstated how easy it is to transition if you're intersex (especially if you underwent genital surgery when you were young), in general transition is better (once you get past the awful dyadically-oriented psychiatrists) as the body responds to the hormones better and usually never got so dimorphic in the first place. So if you're this example trans person in question, you're likely struggling with internal self-doubts that society is oh so keen to viciously reinforce, and have a very uncertain and inescapably difficult transition ahead of you, and then there's this group of people who appear to get it easier in general in both regards, and yeah. Envy naturally kicks in, and it feels worse. And then you get told off for feeling that. Cue the fight response kicking in and consequently the bullshit you end up seeing.  This doesn't justify the erasure and whatnot, fuck no, but I find it helps to understand why people do what they do. And we've all seen the blogs and rants from intersex people about what it's like and how we dyadic trans people suck etc etc, and they're all fair points, but rare have I seen the light of day be given to why we dyadic trans people suck in the first place, and it tells a story less of some insidious dyadic privilege or some vast conspiracy, and more of pretty depressing psychological consequentialism."
GenderCynical,3atbif,theory_of_kink,4,Wed Jun 24 10:48:10 2015 UTC,"I think this response is largely bs. Intersex people who aren't trans are not on a better footing than trans people who aren't intersex. And your conjecture about intersex trans people ""transitioning better"" is really odd. There's some trans men with CAIS for example, and they don't respond to testosterone at all. And though their chromosomes may be XY, they still would have to go through an FTM transition that might be unsatisfactory to them. Just one example.   We cannot directly oppression Olympics style compare the two groups."

Sex (and gender identity) is a reality, and claiming that biological sex is wholly constructed erases intersex people entirely. That is not to say it can't change, or that it is fixed, or that it is not subject to cultural stereotyping in the same way gender is. If trans people want to ally with intersex people, there  needs to be some more in depth education regarding speech on both sides (I've seen some pr. heinous speech from IS people too regarding sex)."

GenderCynical,3atbif,SevenLight,4,Wed Jun 24 02:45:35 2015 UTC,"I had a thought that can give one of many answers to your problem. Many of us know what it feels like to be transgender and in denial. It shapes us into really weird human beings who can never act on their instincts, are depressed and frustrated with the world, and have no connection to the love that is around us. Sometimes we see people on the street and think to ourselves ""damn, he is probably trans, look at him struggle"". Sometimes people who I think are trans and in denial are total hate spewing assholes. Others are totally lost, and using one coping strategy after the other. Anyways, you know what i mean...  But i always only thought about MAAB's, what about FAAB's in denial? What about the men in women's bodies who can't be who they really are, what happens to them in denial? And then i thought about some feminists, who say that every coitus with men is rape. Wait a second, closeted ftm's are men who are letting themselves be fucked by men, it must feel really stupid, but it's only happening because they are not true to themselves. And these ""In denial transmen"" will also become very fascinated with (maybe radical) feminism for obvious reasons. It can also happen that they are totally sure about themselves being women, and this for a lifetime. No wonder when i think about what consequences hormones have on the mind and body, we can tell the tale i guess. Now i just want to say that im very unsure about these ideas and i really would like to hear the thoughts of others."

I think that however corrupt the initial theory's become, and however a person comes to TERFism, the base of its appeal is a worldview where others can be easily and permanently separated into good and bad.   The lives of trans people expose the possibility of switching classes, which poses an existential threat. The response to that is to double down on the belief that class assignment is permanent. Therefore trans women are infilitrating liars, which provokes hatred and fear, while trans men are deluded about their true place in the world and are mostly ignored or pitied."

I don't view being a trans man to be an insult, so I don't see what calling her a secret in denial trans man would be a ""gotcha"" at all. In fact, it would be heartbreakingly sad if she was one, considering the harm she has done.   I will defend the fiercest TERF from misgendering because the principle of the situation stands--people are the genders they say they are. Also, it's not an insult to call someone trans.  I happen to know a lot about Voldedirt due to various reasons, going back a dozen or more years. She has reasons for being the way she is. They are not sane or good reasons, but they are reasons. She took a large (who knows the percentage) portion of her community (butch as a noun folks) transitioning as a personal insult and a slap in the face to herself and her community, instead of just sagely going ""interesting. well, have a good one, trans men, and hi to these trans female butches and andro folks!"" which other cis female butches have done.

There are a small number of GC trans men who say the same thing, as well.   It's, uh. Well, this certainly betrays my bias about one of the sources of my past trauma, but it reminds me a lot of the celibate gay Catholic organization called Courage, namely in that there is a prerequisite acceptance of both an intrinsic moral order and the ""reality"" (scare quotes) that one is ""intrinsically disordered"" (actual quote, Catechism of the Catholic Church) and must therefore arrange one's life (celibacy, transition) to compensate for one's instrinsic immorality whilst simultaneously placing it front and center so no one, least especially oneself, can ever be allowed to forget exactly what is wrong with you. It's kind of the ultimate in self-flagellation because you're constantly admitting your life is a lie while maintaining that admitting you're lying is true integrity.

A woman is a certain set of experiences and social expectations set from pretty much birth. A trans woman does not undergo those experiences and has different expectations from the rest of society. I'm not sure who you're referring to specifically, but it's easy enough with that line of thinking to go ""okay, what I want is a female body, but that will never make me a woman because I never went through those woman-only experiences and never will"". Typically, the unique experiences are periods, childbirth, female gender role indoctrination while growing up, etc.  It's a thing."

Offer evidence of XY women and they'll either ignore it or just return to socialization being a key thing.  It's kind of bizarre. In all cases, though, you have to be born as a recognizable girl and undergo the kind of life that gets you. Growing up with a dick attached to your groin gets you a very different life than what most women get access to.  So, through the power of the penis, trans women are forever denied a spot in their special womyn's only place."

Even then, I, personally, am bisexual (dating a cis male long term), but basically never watch porn (never found it interesting), and especially under the influence of hormone therapy I experience a pretty damn low libido (all relationships I've been in thus far have been asexually romantic). Likewise, I have many female friends; in fact, since I was a kid, I associated mostly with them over males.

I just get intimate with my partner (it not even always about having sex)  And it seems these eejits (GC and G_C) seem to forget that a lot of the time a trans person can face extreme levels of violence when trying to be social, so no we don't exist in a fucking vacuum, I certainly don't I'm just extra careful who I socialise with (mostly women when my PTSD and social anxiety aren't making me quite agoraphobic).

They would still be socially conditioned as their birth sex, their worldview would still undoubtedly be shaped by their upbringing, and nothing would make their bodies anything other than what they were assigned at birth   Even if we could prove that there is a legitimate cause for being transgender it still wouldn't matter because muh fee-fees!"

Lesbian trans women are just sex obsessed men wanting to co-opt women's bodies for themselves, straight trans women are just gay guys who couldn't accept being gay so they became women instead, and trans guys, when they acknowledge their existence at all, are women who couldn't handle all this oppression and joined the mens team to gain male privilege.

I am always willing to engage with intellectually honest, good-faith opposition to any position I hold, but there is nothing of worth to be found there and no kind of genuine discussion to be had. MtT love drama, and they love female attention. Why give them the audience they crave?   OMG its like they have no self-awareness. Christ, we read gendercritical because you are all batshit insane and we love laughing at you. I mean, I used to want to have honest-to-god conversations with y'all but look in my history and you will see quickly what happened when I tried. You don't want to have conversations because you have no argument to stand on. You resort to banning and brigading and spamming posts to get your argument heard because your arguments are so asinine, anti-science and anti-logic. Your sub is a giant echo-chamber, GC, full of neonazis, trolls and conservative nutjobs as much as it is full of reactionary women. I don't even want to call you feminists.

Then I realized that this is actually a pretty fucked up situation. Unless details are being left out, both parents are inflicting their will on the child and both parents are in the wrong for getting rid of S.'s clothes.   Bonifacio said S. was interested in stereotypical boys' and girls' clothes and activities, and that gender expression shouldn't be confused with gender identity. Bonifacio recommended that the parents not associate clothes and toys with a specific gender, but provide a variety of clothes and toys and let S. pick. He recommended that the parents still refer to S. as a boy.   And this is why there are gender specialists, even if they can be a huge pain in the ass for older trans persons. I mean for fucks sake the child is four! Just leave S. be until they a little bit older and if they decide to to be on either side of the gender binary. There is nothing wrong with being genderqueer, but because of Canada's children privacy laws I don't think we will know any more of the story to have a better understanding of what exactly is happening here.  And now about gendercritical... Just like... fuck. The fact there is a divorce happening is not really the most important detail of this story. I mean it's relevant because the parent's are being complete asses for using the S. as a way to fight against each other, but I think the fact that there is a child that might be genderqueer and is being forced according to gender stereotypes on one side or the other. But nope! Of course the post is about how genderqueer kids will be formed due to messy divorces because this exact situation happens all the time!

Then I asked /r/askfeminists why male privilege is a thing if my life sucked and I got owned by radical feminists who told me I am still full of male privilege and so I pursued the philosophy and it made sense to me. I am a devout feminist now and realize me and many other trans women are fake women who still have socialized male privilege that I at one time refused to acknowledge.
GenderCynical,39tort,Ebomb1,6,Sun Jun 14 21:52:17 2015 UTC,"You're basically saying ""feminism =  hatred of males"". That's the only way it could make sense for someone who is ""male"" and a devout feminist to hate themselves for being ""male""."
GenderCynical,39tort,claimstoknowpeople,-6,Sun Jun 14 21:58:37 2015 UTC,feminism is not hatred of males is acknowledgement of patriarchy and males discriminating against females. and trans women are socialized as males and do not face the same obstacles as females.

GenderCynical,39tort,Skeptekr,2,Sun Jun 14 23:42:04 2015 UTC,"socialized as males   But that doesn't make a fucking difference. A transwoman enjoyed male privledge at the time that she was in boy mode. As soon as she switches to girl mode, she loses it. In fact, she even has less privledges than cis women. She is more likely to get raped and killed, less likely to get hired. It gets even more dangerous if she goes travelling in 3rd world countries, as some cultures lynch or incarcerate transwomen just for being trans.  Since you are an ex-MRA, I'm assuming you know about people who claim feminists are people with victim-complexes. TERFs prove that there definitly is a problem with victim-complexes within the feminist movement. If you as a cis-person claim that you are oppressed by transpeople, a minority which doesn't even make 1% of world's population, you don't give a shit about equality. You are just a feminist because it feeds your bullshit victimhood."

GenderCynical,39i28z,skye_em,7,Thu Jun 11 21:25:25 2015 UTC,"What's really sad is that misogyny is still so commonly endemic within male culture, and this, understandably, brings about a conflation of ""masculinity"" and the types of misogynistic behaviours recounted in the article and other articles it links, especially http://www.autostraddle.com/butch-please-butch-with-a.../   To be a bit pedantic though, I would replace pretty much every instance of ""masculinity"" in the articles with ""maleness"" to make a distinction. Maleness has that disgusting machismo to it (as I'm using the term now at least, and the word feels like that to me) whereas masculinity can... be beautiful.   If embracing masculinity psycho-spiritually, the feminine, and so actual women of all sorts, will be met with deep respect (and on an equal level of course) without the objectification, body policing, etc. The issue that comes through here is too many single-minded pursuits for sex/sexual relationships - the physical act only, meaning no real investment of the heart & mind. Even a one night stand can have real, genuine passion and feeling to it, especially if it's more serendipitous than a night out pursuit of the objective ""I need to get laid"" or even a sexual relationship being approached from a primarily physical desire.  (edit*: And ""I need to get laid"" is not a solely masculine expression...)   I know I'm missing some aspects here though, and being a bit naive and too idealistic maybe, or maybe I just have no sex drive still :·p"
GenderCynical,39i28z,javatimes,3,Thu Jun 11 21:27:28 2015 UTC,"so if i think maleness can be beautiful or doesn't have to be disgustingly macho, am I wrong? also how would that article make any sense if you subbed maleness for masculinity?  it's specifically talking about masculinity amongst non-males (for the very most part--one 'trans guy' is mentioned briefly, i think)  i guess like, if you want to discuss this here, i would need some clarification myself"
GenderCynical,39i28z,Ebomb1,2,Sat Jun 13 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"Right, and that's why it's ""pedantic"", or rather simply arbitrarily picky, as you've basically pointed out, cause yeah, it is the same in essence I'll submit, just that I was attempting to ionize the terms, when really, neither word is praising or pejorative in and of itself. I could explain my reasons for thinking of ""masculinity"" are more beautiful than ""maleness"" but you're probably not interested in such semantic nonsense :·p  I guess ""macho"" because of machismo is more descriptive of what I'm talking about anyway."
GenderCynical,39i28z,lecih,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:43:17 2015 UTC,"So, really my point is, and I didn't say this at first because my comment was really just copied and pasted from fbook where I had posted it where a friend had shared the article and her comment was kinda in line with the article and since I didn't feel like potentially offending anyone by saying, shockingly, as a trans female myself that...:  Really, I think it's somewhat misandric to describe that kind of sexual, let's say, conquistadorism as masculine or male. There is evolutionary and cultural precedent for why it would be thought of as such, but those lines of argument are fallacious, and plus the same kinds of historic arguments are used to try to prevent the actual advancement of women still.   Claiming ""misandry"" is dangerous, though, especially when I think any kind of men's rights movement is truly ridiculous, and misogyny is no doubt far more prevalent in most societies.   My point is still, if these butch lesbians are acting that way in the dating scene, which mind you is basically the bar scene as it would seem by some of the situations described by the author of the article, any bar/club scene is mostly likely going to be a skewed sample of the general population I think.   But again, maybe I'm being too idealistic and giving men too much credit, because especially when unwittingly engaged in groupthink, I'm sure too many men are still far too chauvinistic. But still, I'm an idealist through and through, I don't seem to be budging on my (possibly pipe)dreams for humanity any time soon... by which I mean, hopefully there are significant examples out there of why that's not ""masculine"" or ""male"" behaviour but just unclassy and even uncivilized/trashy behaviour, which is genderless."

GenderCynical,39h5py,neckbreadsftl,2,Fri Jun 12 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"Correlation does not imply causation:       Correlation does not imply causation is a phrase used in science and statistics to emphasize that a correlation between two variables does not necessarily imply that one causes the other.   Many statistical tests calculate correlation between variables. A few go further and calculate the likelihood of a true causal relationship; examples are the Granger causality test and convergent cross mapping.  The counter assumption, that correlation proves causation, is considered a questionable cause logical fallacy in that two events occurring together are taken to have a cause-and-effect relationship. This fallacy is also known as cum hoc ergo propter hoc, Latin for ""with this, therefore because of this"", and ""false cause"". A similar fallacy, that an event that follows another was necessarily a consequence of the first event, is sometimes described as post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for ""after this, therefore because of this"").  For example, in a widely studied case, numerous epidemiological studies showed that women who were taking combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) also had a lower-than-average incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), leading doctors to propose that HRT was protective against CHD. But randomized controlled trials showed that HRT caused a small but statistically significant increase in risk of CHD. Re-analysis of the data from the epidemiological studies showed that women undertaking HRT were more likely to be from higher socio-economic groups (ABC1), with better-than-average diet and exercise regimens. The use of HRT and decreased incidence of coronary heart disease were coincident effects of a common cause (i.e. the benefits associated with a higher socioeconomic status), rather than cause and effect, as had been supposed.

GenderCynical,39h5py,claimstoknowpeople,-1,Fri Jun 12 03:52:08 2015 UTC,"The fact that women are feeling CS degrees is due to the fact that trans women have filled their void because men see trans women as ""cool women with male personalities"" who will giggle at misogynist jokes with them.

GenderCynical,39h5py,John_314159,5,Fri Jun 12 18:20:29 2015 UTC,I think you misinterpret that data just a bit. It's well known that all women in computer science are trans. What's really happening is trans women have started attacking feminism by majoring in home economics instead.

At first I thought it was just me getting over all the internalized hate and seeing them for the disingenuous bigots they are.  But I've been wondering this for a while and now that you mentioned it, yeah crazier for sure.    The more exposure trans issues get the more they obsess.  The more they discuss trans issues in their echo chamber  the more their own prejudice is reflected back and amplified.  Their already warped perceptions of trans people and the world can only get worse.  They are having an increasingly difficult time maintaining the front of ""be critical"" and more and more often it comes off as just plain hate.    They are getting increased exposure with us and finding some people sympathetic to their views.  They honestly believe that society is currently very pro trans and these people are finally opening their eye to ""reality"".  What the don't understand is that society is very anti-trans.  Their prejudice beliefs towards trans people are not radical but rather the same widespread prejudice that trans people face from the rest of society repackaged with a ""feminist"" label that allows them to deflect criticism.  Of course transphobic beliefs are finding sympathetic minds in a transphobic society.   What they are not getting is that these are people who are looking to justify their prejudice and will take up any ideology that will allow it, not a groundswell of support for ""gender abolition"".    What is actually happening is that our transphobic society is a little more accepting so more people will come out.  More out trans people means more exposure.  People will actually be less inclined to listen to conspiracy theory about trans people spying for the patriarchy when they are referring to their cousins, their friends, their brothers and sisters.  The stereotypes of trans women being perverts or hyper feminine caricatures of women will be seen for the bigotry it is.  People will look at these criticisms and think ""oh my niece is a trans girl and she's just like any regular girl, actually a bit of a tomboy who hates being told to be ladylike"".  They will just be glad they could find happiness in a world that tries to bring them down for just being themselves.  And the people who are ""just being critical"" will be listened to less and less.  Their voices will become louder their language fouler and the world will see them for what they are."

If an 8 year old identifies as a girl, it's obviously not autogynephilia, which is their only internal theory of gender identity. So this gender identity must be, from their theories, externally imposed: being identified as a girl is something that has been done to her,  rather than something she has done. But wait, if someone is being raised, socialized as a girl, isn't that what we're always told is the only commonality that all women share since some have never been fertile?  Their only alternative here is to fall back on biology as destiny: the differences between girls and boys are not due to socialization but due to inherent physical differences between men and women, differences that appear as early as age 8.  Seriously, what can be less feminist than that? If such major physical differences exist at such an early age then society must raise them differently, including gender segregated sports.   Gender critical feminism is once again shown to consist of an anti-feminist set of inconsistent memes useful for denigrating trans people no matter what, rather than an internally consistent philosophy."

GenderCynical,391abt,BunBunself,2,Mon Jun 8 22:33:42 2015 UTC,"I've had the misfortune of speaking with more than a couple TERFs that believe that cis women don't experience paraphilias. They believe paraphilias are a product of male socialization and pornography. This is why Cathy Breadbox uses the phrase ""pornsick men"" so often when referring to trans women.  Nevermind that this is a disingenuous view of the subject and that many researchers in the field have contended that part of the reason for the disparity between men and women in this instance is likely a result of selection bias in studies which have largely ignored women in favor of men.    On top of that, the same studies are also biased towards convicted sex offenders, the majority of whom are men. Add onto this the society wide perception of women who are abusers and pedophiles as less dangerous than their male counterparts, and things start to come together.  It doesn't matter to them that Blanchard and many of the people who subscribe to belief in autogynephilia hold loads of sexist, heteronormative and outdated views on sex. Anything that they can use as a cudgel against trans women is enough."

So, they start showing up at stores, dressed in their homosexual attire, and just innocently go in and buy a cup of coffee and some donuts.

GenderCynical,38v690,agnosticnixie,8,Sun Jun 7 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"I find it odd that they're so supportive of this when she doesn't have tremendous issue with trans people (not that it's super supportive either, and the author's not the most articulate and clear in her understanding of trans folk and transition), just with certain uses of language being replaced (along with cissexism she seemed to feel was useful), and with people trying to concretely define what 'woman' means in a universal fashion, when she was against such definitions, and considers female (and seemingly sex as a whole) to be a social construct worth waging sociopolitical war over. Seemingly takes no considerable issue with those physically transitioning, or calling themselves whatever, just so long as they don't try using their own definition of self as a blanket definition for all others like them. That there's no objective way to perceive a social construct like female, woman, male, or man.  Like, seriously:   In the process, they undermine almost a century of hard-fought arguments that the very definition of female is a social construct that has subordinated us.   Unless I'm interpreting this wrong, she's arguing against biological essentialism, a founding aspect of TERFdom. But, then again, TERFs do tend to latch onto anything remotely anti-trans, regardless of the overall message."
GenderCynical,38v690,lockedge,-2,Sun Jun 7 04:11:34 2015 UTC,"Well, it is called gender critical. Not everyone who is gender critical is equally trans-exclusive, or holds the same ""TERF"" philosophy. Not all radical feminism or gender critical feminism is essentialist.  I think this person may have mean to write 'woman' instead of ""female"" here, though, considering how the whole argument is going. And the article seems anti-transgender from what I've read of it. But I do think that it's not true that all gender critical radical feminists believe in biological essentialist. On the contrary, gender critical feminism is opposed to the idea that there are male and female brains, and that's biologically essentialist and neurosexist.  In its heart, I think what gender critical feminism is about, or should be about when it isn't co-opted by transphobia, is that the belief in male and female brains is fundamentally sexist and anti-feminist. I feel like if more transpeople and gender critical radical feminists could come to an understanding and agreement about this radical viewpoint about gender, we could get along and understand each other better. Maybe I'm naive, but I'd like to hope some of us could understand and support each other better.  Many trans-exclusive radical feminists are right that transpeople and our gender identities are often used to promote gender stereotypes and the biological essentializing of people's brains."
GenderCynical,38v690,ViolenceIsTerrible,6,Mon Jun 8 09:48:09 2015 UTC,"I'm quite aware that not all radical feminists are trans-exclusive, being a radical feminist myself.   Honestly, I think I'd be much more likely to find common ground with TERFs and GCs if they gave up on the idea that sex is a static, valuable biological construct. I already don't believe in 'male/female brains', at least in the binarist sense. I wish they'd give up on the nonsense that sex isn't an oppressive cog in our social systems. I think with that, we can more readily come to terms.  But by and large they really do hold onto sex like a life raft, and that, to me, makes them essentialists. They believe sex is a necessary attribute for human beings, and that it cannot be changed. And that...that is absolutely not compatible with my own views of feminism or trans politics.   And absolutely, the whole 'male/female brain' narrative can, if twisted, be construed as backwards, being linked to the shitty ""Women are worse at math and better nurturers"" junk, when most really mean ""I have a female brain because I feel female, and I am female""."

Contrast this with her incarnation before that, /u/_Sindel - that userpage comes up 404 (just like /u/MissHim does), but if you look at this submission (thanks, Google!), you'll see it's still got her name on it. Further, being shadowbanned does not remove moderators from a sub, nor does it take away any of their mod powers. This has been true since ever. If her account had been shadowbanned (and again: it wasn't), she would still have been in control of her subreddit.   So like, this is very simple.

Plenty  of  my interests are stigmatized for a man...and  even  moreso for a trans man.

Women who aren't feminists fall at this first hurdle, and you see them everywhere too scared to say anything at all that isn't complete agreement.   Today I learned suicidal depression and protesting against denial of medical treatment is abuse. Good to know.   Name-calling, threats, pictures of sad dickheads in lipstick holding knives, people's kids' pictures being sexually photoshopped.   Name calling and threats? You mean like how Cathy Brennan calls trans women delusional and doxxes them? Oh, and outs trans women's status to employers?  And seriously, you're protesting people photoshopping their own baby pictures? Are you really that dumb? For real?   Or dismissive gaslighting (""Trans aren't interested in watching you shit""). They have no interest in our perfectly reasonable and valid objections, and they couldn't give a rat's arse about our fears.   Apparently gaslighting is pointing to the fact that there's no case of this ever happening. No man has ever pretended to be a woman to watch women pee.  It's too suspicious. I mean, you honestly think there would be no violent backlash if a man went into a women's bathroom wearing women's clothing, and going into a stall that is clearly occupied?"

By that strange logic, how could they not all be attracted to women? It also explains why they're concerned about trans women but not cis lesbians; they think trans is a pathological compulsion, so they don't trust trans women to control themselves. Despite the fact that statistical evidence seems to show that cis women are more of an actual risk to other women in that sense (not a great risk, sure, but it's something that has actually happened)."

Me: well the way I look at it, and I doubt it's just me, is that it's someone who expects their body to be female, and feels more comfortable in a female body than a male one.  It's also someone who, brain chemistry wise, generally feels more comfortable on oestrogen than testosterone, though I don't know whether that correlates 100%.  TERF: no it isn't!  A few days later...  TERF: no one's even been able to explain to me what a ""woman"" is supposed to be now!  They complain that no one's ever defined ""woman"" to them in a way that's trans inclusive and a concrete definition.  But people point out the definition to them quite often.  What they mean is they don't believe in the definition that's been pointed out to them many times.  Now, if they (TERFs and other conservatives) could define ""woman"" in a way that includes intersex women but excludes intersex men, that'd be something. :)  But they can't, so they just ignore anyone who mentions intersex people, along with ignoring anyone who answers their questions."

Of course men like Jenner are better at being hawwwt and sexxay than women, they're the ones that designed femininity that way. They know what it's supposed to be like because they created it.   BetAle doesn't know how patriachy works. Yes, BetAle, Bruce Jenner personally created femininity...

GenderCynical,38fz77,Ebomb1,3,Thu Jun 4 15:04:48 2015 UTC,"I'm responding to you and to the OP comment in one comment.  I think it's tough to compare those things. TERFs and terf-leaning cis lesbians have rather large platforms to talk amongst themselves about trans women. Gay cis men who don't want to fuck trans men just marginalize us out of their spaces. They report our craigslist ads as ""miscategorized"" and the ads get taken down.  Gay male (largely cis) sexuality is built around the cult of the penis, so rejecting trans men often happens as a matter of course.   And there's been tons of criticism of when groups that cater to gay cis men do officially ban trans men, as happened with the Chicago Hellfire group, a men's BDSM group.  See: http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=1841  As one can read, like TERFs, many gay cis men consider trans men to be women. Shocking, I'm sure. See also: http://transmenongrindr.tumblr.com/  And ""When was the last time you heard a FTM lecture other men on what a ""real man"" should look like?"" is absurdly ridiculous. It happens all the fucking time. I've had to ban dudes in /r/ftm for pulling that shit.  If anyone spends any time in an ftm support group, they will hear it.  I also do consider it bigotry when gay cis men dismiss trans men out of hand as partners.    I also FUCKING HATE that TERFs absolutely use 'poor, deceived FtTranses' like myself for their disgusting hate. They don't allow ""co-opting intersex narratives"" or whatever, but they pull out that ""FTM invisibility"" shit all the fucking time.

GenderCynical,38drx6,BattleFalcon,12,Wed Jun 3 18:27:34 2015 UTC,"Ignoring the fact that fat and  disabled trans women exist (w-what?!! Really/1?!?), even if there were hundreds of trans women openly desiring to be those things, TERFs would find a way to pathologize that too."
GenderCynical,38drx6,Skeptekr,7,Wed Jun 3 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"Heck, there are some who would be willing to get their feet bound if they saw it somehow ""legitimized"" their womanhood. Think about the amount of trans women who get breast implants. That's the sad thing about a trans woman's womanhood. Society will always find a way to delegitimize it, as well as make us afraid of expressing it through threats of violence.  Not feminine enough? You must not really be a woman inside. It pushes a lot of women into becoming more and more feminine to appeal to these standards. But when they become ""feminine enough"", suddenly they're ""insulting 'real' women everywhere by pushing standards"". It's a double bind."
GenderCynical,38drx6,tacosprinkles,11,Thu Jun 4 06:14:03 2015 UTC,breasts ironed or feet bound.   I also have yet to see a person who wants to be physically tortured.
GenderCynical,38drx6,CrystalCastlesII,9,Wed Jun 3 19:08:25 2015 UTC,I guess the point they're trying to make is that trans women haven't suffered those things but...neither have billions of cis women??

I can't even begin to image what it must be like to grow up fearing your family would disown you if they discovered you are a TERF.  Must be tough.  I also see many of them fear they would lose their jobs if they were discovered to be TERFs.  That must be stressful and painful to hide.  It must be hard growing up in a world that fundamentally misunderstands you.  If only I could fully understand and empathize with these things.  I could move past my preconceived notions and dogmatic ideology and understand them as people.  But then what group of people would I blame for my deep seated personal insecurities?

So apparently they want to get rid of gender roles and let everyone 'just be who they are', but only the appearances that match a strict binary are acceptable."

GenderCynical,384pl3,cervixbagel,14,Tue Jun 2 14:12:21 2015 UTC,"That's something I've always wondered about TERFs. They think gender is an oppressive social construct,  but  they  don't want to grant people the right to move freely within the construct or permit them the autonomy to choose what parts of that construct apply to themselves.   Instead, they work to reinforce the construct by misnaming and  misgendering trans people, ensuring the status quo remains that person born with X body must be Y socially-constructed gender."
GenderCynical,384pl3,Skeptekr,7,Tue Jun 2 02:56:43 2015 UTC,"I think it stems from the inability to see gender as both a construct and as a concept that has real meaning in people's lives. If you pretend that constructs are entirely made up, you can claim gender doesn't mean anything but their pet phrase, ""adult fe/male human."""
GenderCynical,384pl3,Ebomb1,7,Tue Jun 2 10:22:16 2015 UTC,"I think the main problem is the way that transphobia bends their entire ideology out of shape. If you work through a radical post-gender ideology from the ground up, then denying trans people's identities wouldn't ever seriously come into it. You might critique certain ways trans identity is talked about (medical narratives, for example), but you'd be doing that alongside plenty of trans people. However, if you constantly allow a downright ugly, visceral bigotry against trans folk (particularly trans women) to inform your thinking at every step then you end up with an ideology that makes no overall sense, except in so far as it serves to justify that bigotry."

Idk if she's a TERF but if she can't follow the rules, then she can't post there (or here if she breaks them).   Honestly, I think this ""lol TERFs are jealous"" line is not really good and too easily falls apart and comes across as rather misogynistic, even if I can see why other people here are saying it.   OP is a butthead sometimes (sorry John) but I don't think the intention was misogynistic. The biggest problem with these situations is that society won't accept a trans woman unless they appeal to extreme femininity. It is sexist. However, she has no choice really. Even masculine or androgynous cis women have a hard time being perceived as attractive and ""truly"" a woman, if that makes sense."

I am a butthead sometimes.  I'm also confused why imputing jealousy as a motive would be considered potentially misogynistic.

I don't see how that's any of anyone's business.  I also know you disagree with the concept of ""female brain"" because of the political ramifications acknowledging such differences would create.  That doesn't mean it's not true.  Jury isn't in and won't be probably within our lifetimes.  It just means it's scary for some people (particularly feminists) to think about because what if it is?  What does that mean for feminism?  We don't seem to have a problem with hardwired male or female behavior in the animal kingdom.

So like all 21st century bigots, they just silently resent and seethe, saving all that rage up until they can let it fly on some trans person on the Internet about how they're the cause of every bad thing that's ever happened to them because they're a man and will always be one.  Then they go home to their men.  Crazy fucking tapdance, isn't it?"

It's only purpose is to control and harm women.  To create an equal society we must see gender as irrelevant reject it and move past it as a way of organizing society and judging individuals.  In this nightmare scenario described gender is an increasingly irrelevant and meaningless social construct.  So much so that society will reorganize itself to the point where public gender segregated spaces disappear completely.  This is bad according to the gender abolitionist position because...? Without strict segregation they can't bitch about trans people?  Oh no wait it because sex is still important!!  So sex is completely independent from social constructs, very real and very important for the organization of society.  So we as a society will agree to strict rules around the concept of sex.  One could say we will construct them.  These strict rules about sex will police the boundary of acceptable behaviour based on people sex (which is real) and not gender because it's bullshit.  Finally once we realize man and woman are meaningless concepts while male and female are of the utmost importance to society we will be free!!!"

However TERFs demand that only one is acceptable.  Edit: I think one thing TERFs don't get is that trans people who transition have in a real sense lived both of these possibilities: no matter what we do, during transition we are often perceived as gender nonconforming, non-straight, etc., and we can choose how much we like that space.  We've actually tried all that out and know what works best for us.  It's TERFs who haven't actually given the other side a shot."
GenderCynical,36qul4,claimstoknowpeople,8,Thu May 21 12:19:53 2015 UTC,"I agree. It seems like, with many trans exclusive people, they see our ""lived experiences"" as male or men, no matter how others perceive our gender. And no matter what we do, we're seen by our larger society as non-conforming. Many trans exclusive people see us as men wearing a stereotype. Even though most of us aren't walking around naked, so most people can't see our genitals that most trans-exclusive people, and most of society, seems to make such a big deal out of in relation to our gender."

GenderCynical,36qul4,BunBunself,8,Thu May 21 14:09:18 2015 UTC,"I can sympathize with a materialist analysis of gender relations that respects trans people's right to exist and listens to our life experiences without falling back on cissexist tropes. I absolutely do not sympathize with people who call themselves gender critical.   Not because I don't believe that gender as a system of forcing people into specific behaviors isn't harmful, or because I can't empathize with how they feel about how we're treated in world where people who conform to social expectations of maleness can control you, hurt you and get away with it. But because it's a political label which is heavily associated with a particular type of feminism known to be antagonistic to trans people and which has and continues to have material effects on the lives of trans people.  Gender critical is just 2005's trans critical under new ownership. Out of all the 7 billion human beings on Earth participating in some sort of gendered social system, they choose to put a laser focus on the 0.5% of people they believe are responsible for upholding gender. They spend an inordinate amount of time trying to tear down and erase a vulnerable minority.  I won't engage with this viewpoint because it's plain nonsense to anyone who isn't filled with visceral disgust for trans people. It's a forgone conclusion; we are the enemy of real females. Trans inclusive feminism is more than capable of incorporating an analysis which is critical of gender and of advancing the rights of women without shitting on trans people."

Just like I've come across radical feminists who aren't trans exclusionary.  But it sure does seem like a lot of transphobic people are giving words like 'gender critical' or 'gender abolitionist' a bad name. So I don't blame you for feeling that way.  The oppression of transpeople definitely makes the least sense to me, and if gender critical and trans feminists are to come to an understanding and mutual respect, that's the thing that they need to leave behind.  Even if many radical feminists believe that gender should be abolished and upholds gender roles and stereotypes in some way. Society should still be seen as more to blame. So going after transpeople, makes no sense to me.  Many gender critical people are focusing on the wrong people."

I wasn't bagging on anyone's English, just pointing out that the subset of feminists who call themselves gender critical don't actually critique gender very much or very well. I mean literally speaking, I'm ""gender critical,"" but I don't describe myself that way because it so happens that the people who coined it as a group identifier believe very different things than I do, and I don't want people to get the wrong idea."

A lot of their rhetoric is detrimental to women like me (not traditionally socialized due to being autistic, history of abuse by other women, history of being rejected within ""women's spaces,"" etc). I don't have the luxury of being able to blame my traumas on male privilege. I often feel that what's happened is my fault when I think about the world in their context. Many of them flat out refuse to acknowledge that women can abuse other women.   I guess I just wish I could have a convenient scapegoat."

GenderCynical,36qul4,gamerzap,3,Thu May 21 20:37:02 2015 UTC,"I've heard a lot about sexism and gendering in relation to Autism. I don't know your story personally, but I've heard terrible stories. Neurosexists like Simon Baron-Cohen have been leading to a lot more marginalization and under-diagnosing of girls with Autism. And there's a whole lot of neurosexism and and other types of sexism in relation to Autism.  So I can definitely imagine many frustrating experiences.  And while I don't think that male privilege doesn't play a part in the ways that women abuse other women. I think it's sad and wrong how some gender critical feminists seem to see ciswomen as blameless more often than is accurate. Ciswomen are certainly not blameless and harmless, and certainly do abuse and bully.  I feel like it's also really sexist to portray women as moral and pure and innocent in this way. Because I feel like it can lead to stereotyping and images of women that are demure and gentle or at least un-empowering. It's sexist stereotyping to be treating people of any gender as ""pure"" and ""innocent""."

GenderCynical,36qul4,ellenok,3,Thu May 21 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"I do agree with them that brain sex is not completely black in white.   We still know so little about the brain and much of the research is sexist.   Most biologists that I have read say that sex is a spectrum and I would think that it is both physical and mental.    There is so much overlap and exceptions that to me it seems obvious that men and women are not a completely different species.    I can see why they would get mad at the thought of say girls playing with legos or like to run around or build things are really boys,  Occasionally I do see crap like that in the media and it does to lots of harm.   However, they seem hell bent on the trans guys are just self hating women and trans women are all deviant fetishists.   I don't understand why they can't just call out people who are assholes."
GenderCynical,36qul4,Ebomb1,5,Thu May 21 16:56:33 2015 UTC,"Sure, I see a lot of your points, but most of them are incredibly compatible with trans feminism.

That the brain is sexually dimorphic, and that intersex conditions (using a wide definition of intersex) happen."
GenderCynical,36qul4,ellenok,7,Thu May 21 20:20:07 2015 UTC,"It's the simple separation of biological gender, and social constructs...the brain is sexually dimorphic,   Drawing simple dichotomies is also reductionist in an unproductive way. We don't know enough about the brain's apparent dimorphism to draw reliable conclusions about the etiology of sexual identity or what variations result in trans-ness. At most we can assume some of the cause of some people's trans-ness is all or mostly biological. Assuming all trans-ness is down to biology is the inverse of the mistake TERFs make. Biology and social factors are too complicated and entwined to separate sensibly."
GenderCynical,36qul4,Ebomb1,4,Thu May 21 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Yeah we don't have enough studies, and large enough sample sizes, yet. Hopefully soon though.

GenderCynical,36qul4,lecih,3,Thu May 21 16:47:49 2015 UTC,"I know that it's believed a lot that people have their sexualities because of biology. Since most people seem to be kind of heterosexual. And a lot of people believe the same about gender identity.  But I don't believe that and I think that believing in male and female brains is pretty counterproductive to feminism. And that it's just as bad to say there are male and female brains as it is to say that boys have penises and girls have vaginas.  Also, saying that men's and women's brains are different has a history in Evo. Psych biotruths. Or neurosexism."
GenderCynical,36qul4,ellenok,2,Thu May 21 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"(note: tangent)  I think that if we as a species are going to move beyond oppression based on reproductive potential, then the emphasis we place on reproductive potential as an essential part of self-definition has to go way, way, way down.   It seems obvious that allowing people control over their bodies should extend to what we consider sexed characteristics.  But in a society (i.e. most all of them) structured around controlling reproduction, that's anathema.   If anthropologists are correct, then society has only been structured like this since the advent of planned agriculture, or about 10,000 years. That seems to suggest there are ways of structuring society that don't put social emphasis on who's male and who's female and that allow the body and reproduction to be a personal thing. Whether those would scale to a world of billions is another matter, but we're smart hominids; I'm sure we could come up with something.    Theoretically gender criticals and gender abolitionists would want something like this, but in practice they are really, really hung up over maleness and femaleness and never the twain shall meet. But like, who cares? It's perfectly possible to address misogyny--structurally and personally--while accepting the existence of outliers, which, at 0.2?--0.02? percent of the population is something we definitely are. The outsize emphasis on us is ridiculous. I think if you want to radically change society, you have to consider what made that society the way it is and upend that. The way we conceptualize gender can't substantially change (much less be abolished!) unless the way we relate to sex substantially changes."
GenderCynical,36qul4,Ebomb1,2,Thu May 21 18:22:24 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that trans-exclusionary people definitely focus too much on marginalizing transpeople, a small part of the population. Pushing down an oppressed group. Which is sad, because outside of that, I really agree with gender critical radical feminism.  Would you consider parents who try to raise genderless children without pronouns to be gender critical? I've often seen stories about parents raising ""genderless"" children making the news. I wonder if this would be seen as a form of gender critical parenting.  I did see someone in one of the gender critical subreddits one time say, that avoiding pronouns would be a good thing, particularly traditional ones like he or she."
GenderCynical,36qul4,ellenok,1 point,Thu May 21 17:07:22 2015 UTC,"I kind of think deliberately going for genderless or genderfree parenting is likely to backfire. Gender is such a huge part of life that avoiding it or restricting it is going to make it more tempting, just like how girls in religions that restrict sex have a higher rate of teen pregnancies. Also, I don't know if the publicity around Baby Xs has any meaningful impact. It certainly illustrates how deeply gender's entrenched when you see people going apeshit over it, but I'm not sure if it does anything beyond that. I think, though, if English had an official gender neutral pronoun that that could be a good thing to use, unless/until the kid says they prefer a gendered one.  It's probably more realistic to shoot for actively anti-sexist, anti-polarized parenting. Kids are going to be exposed to gendering regardless--to minimize its impact and counter the harmful messages is I think the best parents can reasonably do."

It would be terrible to invalidate her identity based on such a thing."
GenderCynical,36qul4,John_314159,2,Thu May 21 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think this should be a qualifier for anything, because we are way too far away from finding out everything about how gender identity works to do that.    It's simply something i think explains a lot of stuff very well. If it does turn out to be the theory for the norm, any cases outside of that norm should be studied, and the theory should be evaluated with the new data, and we'll probably learn a lot in the process.

We don't know the significance or neuron counts or volume differences, only that they exist. We don't know if brain differences are independently responsible for qualitative differences between male and female behavior or cognition, nor even know for certain if differences exist independent of environment.  What we know is, basically, two things. (1) Brains of people assigned male tend to look like this and brains of people assigned female tend to look like that, and (2) Brains of trans people are more likely to look more like brains from their identified sex. Taken alone that suggests a straightforward conclusion, but the amount of confounding variables is huge."

GenderCynical,36qul4,javatimes,3,Thu May 21 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"It's a theory i like. Not enough interest in research on trans people means not enough studies to really confirm anything though, but it's based on the research there is.  The gist of it: Parts of brains are sexually dimorphic, usually. Things can happen out of the norm during the brain's development, and you can end up with afab people with varying degrees and patterns of male brain parts, amab people with varying degrees and patterns of female brain parts, and people where varying degrees and patterns of the brain parts don't really match male or female. And that's why we have trans people.  Kind of like a lot of the rest of the body has sexually dimorphic traits, and sometimes people have intersex conditions, where not all of those traits are male or all of those traits are female."

Many of us at least start to internalize the ideas people have told us our whole lives about what a ""real"" girl or woman is. So of course, many of us would like that feeling. The feeling of being seen by the world as a ""real"" woman.  By the way, that part about the sheets and virginity made me deeply sick in the pit of my stomach. I can't believe that people did things like that. And I think some people still sadly do such a thing and care about something so trivial, and oppressive.

GenderCynical,36dpx9,mollymollykelkel,4,Tue May 19 02:56:31 2015 UTC,"The article mentions someone named Richard Masbruch who was apparently a serial rapist that was placed in a women's prison (of course, according to that source, getting into a woman's prison was something he conspired to do specifically to rape the women there). I  can't  seem to find any information about  this  person that doesn't come from a TERF/radfem blog. Are there any better sources  for this story?"
GenderCynical,36dpx9,Skeptekr,7,Mon May 18 18:04:27 2015 UTC,"CNN here seems independent.  Amusingly it says there are ""dozens, or possibly hundreds"" of trans women in prisons -- mostly male prisons.  If the actual number is 100 that means that a little less than 1% of California female prisoners are trans, most of whom are housed in men's prisons, and around 0.07% of California's total prison population."
GenderCynical,36dpx9,Skeptekr,4,Mon May 18 18:21:01 2015 UTC,Very interesting info! And  thank  you for the link.
GenderCynical,36dpx9,Astraloid,1 point,Mon May 18 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"Let's talk statistics, shall we?  There are a couple studies out there. The only one I have on hand is this one:  Comparisons with controls matched on reassigned sex yielded similar results. Female-to-males, but not male-to-females, had a higher risk for criminal convictions than their respective birth sex controls.  My understanding is transitioning from male to female does not significantly reduce one's risk of committing violent crime. If you have a study that shows otherwise, or a reason why these studies would be flawed, please share."
GenderCynical,36dpx9,cervixbagel,3,Wed May 20 00:38:52 2015 UTC,"Another way to read that study is that MtF crime dropped significantly between the two periods they studied -- almost halving.  It's been long enough since the study it could easily have halved again: without more current research, who could say?    The suicide rate in the later group was also a quarter of the first one.  It's almost as if the less isolation and poverty experienced by a group, the less time they spend in the desperate situations where crime occurs.  It's almost as if instead of opposing trans rights the right way to support these people is to accept them.  Remember when people argued against gay marriage because gays had too many sexual partners, which happened because society wouldn't support their monogamous relationships even when they had them?  Even if all the numbers the blog author pulled out of their ass were accurate, their conclusion doesn't follow.  The total amount of prison space doesn't decrease when prisoners are moved between prisons, and prisons are from time to time reassigned between different kinds of housing as necessary.  They also ignore the actual prevalence of rapes committed on trans people in prison for the TERFs favorite hypothetical: a fake trans person who transitions just for the purpose of raping people.  Anyway, I hope I'm not just encouraging more sealioning from you.

GenderCynical,36dpx9,Skeptekr,-2,Wed May 20 19:14:39 2015 UTC,"The study isn't measuring crime rates as a whole. It's measuring crime rates between populations. I don't see how fluctuating crime rates would effect that.  The suicide rates are more or less irrelevant to the crime rates.   The total amount of prison space doesn't decrease when prisoners are moved between prisons, and prisons are from time to time reassigned between different kinds of housing as necessary.   This does not contradict the author's conclusion.   TERFs favorite hypothetical: a fake trans person who transitions just for the purpose of raping people.   Stop making strawmen. Putting male-bodied people with women in jail and other correctional facilities has already hurt women. The reason for wanting to be placed there is secondary.   One can reasonably argue for separate housing. One cannot reasonably argue that women must accept extra risk so MtF trans people can feel more validated.   The one time I posted in the Gender_*Critical subs it was explained to me that ""men"" shouldn't be allowed to wear dresses at all   This is a lie."

Some trans guys use their first experience of being confronted in a women's bathroom as something of a rite of passage.  Also, if these people are so worried about men going into the women's bathroom... wouldn't legally forcing trans men to use the women's facilities cause an even greater risk? Not because  trans men want to rape women,  but  because  many post-transition men are visibly indistinguishable from cis men. Trans men going into the women's bathroom would normalize the idea of visibly male people going into the women's room, which would make it even easier for these theoretical cis male rapists to gain access without being noticed.

GenderCynical,365lf5,mollymollykelkel,1 point,Sun May 17 19:15:02 2015 UTC,"I suppose that many trans-exclusive people see gender identity in a similar way to race. Race doesn't exist, but shared culture and oppression often does.  So it's kind of like identifying as a race to other people. While some people would consider identifying as another race, wrong and not something that someone can become. Many trans-exclusionary radical feminists find identifying as another gender sexist. And a kind of appropriation. I've heard some tran-exclusionary feminists call being transgender ""ladyface"", and similar to blackface.  So I guess it's seen as appropriating womanhood. And see gender as a circumstance that doesn't mean much other than oppression. That people born with vaginas are treated as girls, and oppressed, expected to be submissive and demure. And those born with penises treated as boys, and privileged.   Perhaps many gender critical people don't want birth-assignment to be a major part of someone's identity. I've heard some people in gender critical radical feminism say how gender should be comparable to race, in that both shouldn't be a meaningful part of someone. But are both things people can't help being born with.  I'm not saying that I agree with this. But that's just my understanding, from reading from gender critical people. Forgive me if it's wrong."

GenderCynical,365lf5,Freya-Freed,11,Sun May 17 13:04:12 2015 UTC,"This doesn't seem to be the same at all to what is going on with trans people. No trans woman has ever insisted that they actually do have a vagina when they are pre-op, for instance. Instead they are claiming that the possession of a vagina is not grounds for womanhood and they claim further that there is some other grounds for womanhood (many gender variant people have different ideas of what these grounds are) that they actually possess. Just as much as I have never seen someone claim they have a vagina when they don't, I've never seen someone claim that there's a different ground for womanhood and they possess it, when they don't actually possess it. So there's nothing trans people are refusing to acknowledge about themselves at all.  Anyway, I was wondering how exactly you'd access this 'objective reality' thing. I've never been able to step outside of the world and my experiences and examine things from that perspective but it's pretty amazing that you can. Can you teach me this wonderful power?"

Except   when  it's objectively real. Or something.  These people make no sense. It's fucking Shroedinger's gender in here or something. Gender is only real when they don't want trans people to have it, then it's their ""objective reality"" of our ""real gender"" we must conform to. But  when  trans  people claim to have a certain gender, suddenly all gender doesn't real, we're just oppressive shitlords buying into the social construct of gender."
GenderCynical,365lf5,agnosticnixie,8,Sun May 17 16:46:06 2015 UTC,"Lived reality is actually rather more objective than ""objective"" claims from on high based on trying to hammer a square theory in a round world.  You remind me of a certain terf who thinks reducing people to their genitalia is how materialist analysis works rather than an understanding of material economic conditions. Thus, terf-approved marxist materialism is not actually about material conditions but effectively claimed inherent biological traits. It's Lysenkoism applied to feminism, more or less.  When you look at some of these positions and the comparable position of the old freudian/lacanian terfs at the french MLF (Fouque, Irigaray, etc), you see self-proclaimed feminists who were not only rabid transphobes (Fouque was extremely proud of the MLF kicking out the trans women she derisively referred to as ""les travelos de Pigalle"" who dared to think they, too, were women - reminder that the very first, 18th century wave of revolutionary feminism in France included one of the few well known pre-modern trans women in its ranks), but also veered very often towards a discourse that was both often lesbophobic and increasingly opposed to reproductive agency.  If ""material"" analysis of women's economic condition must be reduced to active motherhood rather than its cultural presumption, it thus stands to reason that any group who cannot or will not by dint of biology or by choice pursue it hurts said ""material"" analysis.   On an objective level, I've had quite a few trans friends who, even with wrong IDs, have been dismissed summarily by male doctors on the basis that such and such wasn't that important and that she was probably just pregnant."

She seems to fully identify as a young woman as far as I know.  When the reality is there are many different types of trans people and acting like all kids fall into this certain trope is harmful.

Autogynephilia is a terrible disorder that almost all cis women have. It interferes with their normal sexual attraction and forms the basis of their gender dysphoria.

If you find that confusing, you need to work on your reading comprehension skills.   What is the actual, at-birth gender of the person we’re talking about? And what gender will the person be identified as, once reassignment surgery is completed? Who knows?   In what situations are the answers to these questions important to the story you're writing? Because I honestly can't think of any, unless the story you're writing is specifically about someone undergoing gender reassignment surgery and nothing more, which would be kind of a boring story, probably.   If the act in question was undertaken by an individual who had yet to change his/her name or declare his/her sexual identity, it undermines our integrity as journalists to alter the facts just to suit a newfound sense of social justice in support of transgender rights. If Bruce Jenner decides tomorrow that he wants to change his name to Beverly, that would not justify future journalistic references to 1976 Olympic decathlon gold medalist Beverly Jenner. To do so would be a misstatement of fact. Bruce Jenner, and only Bruce Jenner, won the 1976 Olympic decathlon gold medal.   This guy seems to think that gender reassignment is the creation of a new person out of thin air.

This is due to the fact that trans women are very frequently in IT/computer science, and are seen as token women to the IT establishment when they come out of the closet. They are seen as women with ""male personalities"" by the IT establishment. This drives women out of IT. It's an observed phenomena that I sought out to investigate, and low and behold there is a large correlation between trans women and women leaving IT.  Is this the ONLY reason women are leaving IT? No, but I'm sure if you ran an ANOVA analysis on the data you would see there is a great interaction between trans women and other factors such as misogyny. I'm actually building such a dataset to run a 3 factor ANOVA and see the interaction effects between misogyny (as evidenced by wage gap), trans rights, etc."

That said, some trans men do fear rape if their trans status is revealed, but in my experience/people I know, trans people are at higher risk for rape, but it usually has nothing to do with stranger rape and is more about abusers of any gender preying on vulnerable people."

Personally, I think the thing that really breaks my heart (as a trans woman, for the record) about these policies is the percentage of cisgender women who are already struggling with body image and not fitting a very un-feminist idea of how they 'should' look are potentially going to get harassed over using their own gender's bathroom if they happen to look masculine. There are plenty of cisgender women who will be hurt by this and often too shamed to report it.  I feel like trans people and our allies should probably make it a point to advocate for them too..."

It's sort of funny but mostly sad: they think trans women should risk violence by using men's bathrooms, but I'm fairly certain that, if faced with an obvious man in the women's room, they'd object strenuously (and what's he supposed to do - show them his vagina?) - meaning that their solution for trans dudes is, implicitly, that they should use only unisex public bathrooms - or none at all.   Which... actually brings us to a more disturbing point, and I'm a little surprised this hasn't been raised: if we're supposed to accept that everyone should use bathrooms matching their natal (or even current) genital configuration - that means that they do have to accept, and everyone does have to accept, trans dudes in the women's room. Okay, sure. But if a cis dude did want to sneak into the women's bathroom and assault someone, surely the absolute simplest and easiest way to do that would be to pose as a trans guy, which as compared to posing as a woman would require literally zero doing anything whatsoever?

No, it's just a women's festival, and most of those women agree that trans women are women. They're not there to exclude us.  But it's not something that Vogel would change. The world changed around her, and she stayed put. Her 'intent' no longer flies in mainstream feminism today.

GenderCynical,33ys6o,ErisC,12,Sun Apr 26 23:14:49 2015 UTC,"Personally I think she's just an elitist. She latches onto the blanchard topology because it allows her to employ a hierarchical topology with her at the top. Basically her and people like her get to claim they are at the very least closer to being females than the other group. This other group being comprised of any one that is older when transitioning, attracted to anyone other than men, isn't womanly enough, or just doesn't pass well.

GenderCynical,33ys6o,gamerzap,7,Mon Apr 27 16:39:18 2015 UTC,"Because according to the BTT(Blanchard two-type topology) she's an extremely gay male who transitioned in order to better exist within society. Please note I have nothing against her viewing her self like this, I do however fault her attempts to label other people through the BTT. According to Blanchard male homosexuality represent an feminisation of the brain with regards to sexual attraction. This sexual attraction determines how people act in social settings. In other words a male attracted to other males behaves in a feminine manner to attract other males. In the case of a homosexual transsexual this behaviour is so extreme that they find they can only exist in society as women.   While she socially identifies as a woman, she does view the cause of her transition to be the result of this extreme homosexuality. This might seem counter intuitive, but it allows her to claim to be more legitimately female than other trans women. Those other trans women are, according to blanchard, extreme transvestites. This group  is also referred to as non-homosexual or autogynephilic. Blanchard posits that those people belonging to this group are in no way neurologically female and do not act naturally feminine. This group, according to blanchard, transitions in order to satisfy a sexual need to be viewed as women.   Edit: (TL;DR) so why does she view her self this way?  I think it's internalized transphobia. She does not view herself as really a woman, but she can still paint herself as more of a woman than other trans people."

As in - contrary to the intentions of the gender critical viewpoint.   For example   He believes medical research is inherently gender normative  He's sick of being unable to differentiate people by calling them abnormal.  He considers homosexuality abnormal. Benign. But abnormal. He reckons Autoandrophilia doesn't exist but only included the definition to 'jump the gun' on 'perverse feminism' (seriously) He thinks 'cross-gender identifying boys' will 'throw a ball' in a specific way, and he's cool with thinking of them as sissys (!?)   Source  I really think the GC crowd cherry pick their sources etc. pretty nicely to coincide with their views, but they really have zero idea of who Blanchard really is.

Not a single substantiated case. At all. Zilch. Nil. Nada. Life usually throws exceptions into every mix. This is (ironically) the only exception I've found. No cases, at all.

GenderCynical,33kxop,RevengeOfSalmacis,8,Thu Apr 30 03:39:02 2015 UTC,"Some part of me assumes that many are trans men of some flavor in denial quite reasonably traumatized by being forced into female social roles and by male misogyny. I have no real data to support this, so call it a fiction writer's hunch based on the characters I would write around the behavioral pattern.   I'm not sure I totally buy my own hunch either."
GenderCynical,33kxop,RevengeOfSalmacis,8,Fri May 1 00:24:44 2015 UTC,"That's definitely an interesting hypothesis, one I hadn't quite considered. It does remind me that a disproportionate amount of TERFs I've met have been intersex activists, which is a strange phenomenon to say the least. I'd like to see if that piece of anecdotal observation can be corroborated or explained by another?"
GenderCynical,33kxop,ErisC,9,Thu Apr 23 12:22:50 2015 UTC,"tbh, all I'm doing is working backward from having observed repressed trans people (mostly mtf) and repressed gay/bi people acting in obviously transphobic/homophobic ways and, depending on how keen their intellectual acumen is, finding increasingly elaborate rationalizations for their fear-based prejudice. My hypothesis is fairly economical. It's also probably the most annoying hypothesis I could construct, but not intentionally."
GenderCynical,33kxop,RevengeOfSalmacis,9,Thu Apr 23 13:35:55 2015 UTC,"Several years prior to transitioning, I read some TERF literature and decided that they were right: that gender is a social construct and I should learn to be happy with being male, and that trans people who insist on being considered female are delusional. And I tried that for a year or two, and was still miserable, suicidal, etc...   So it's entirely possible that some of them, at least, are trans people who repress themselves due to internalized transphobia."
GenderCynical,33kxop,Hyomicca,11,Thu Apr 23 13:38:56 2015 UTC,"I was pretty horrified by my encounters with TERF literature around a decade ago--as a young college student, I happened to read Janice Raymond's book in my quest to absorb my alma mater's multi-million-volume research library--and for some weird reason I decided that every other trans person was justified in transitioning--but at the same time I did decide gender was a social construct, devoid of any special significance, in a bid to come to terms with living as a man. That's a big part of why I hold this particular theory: I don't think cis people generally tend to have the same sense of gender identity itself as an utterly arbitrary imposition from outside, because theirs is at least congruent."
GenderCynical,33kxop,Freya-Freed,6,Thu Apr 23 14:12:38 2015 UTC,"For a while, when I first found out about the basic idea of Gender Critical stuff, I was also convinced that it sounded like a good idea, but the more I read, the more I realized that they don't actually care about gender so much as they just don't like transpeople.   And then, after watching them ""argue"" I realized that they have nothing to support their ideas. The common themes of ignoring arguments and picking on tiny semantics, definitions, and attacking people just proves that to me. I think in one of their threads, they ignored an entire argument just to generalize that all trans people use terms like ""y'all"" and ""folks"". Which is also not only absurdly incorrect, but entirely irrelevant.  At any rate, I'd personally love to ditch the rigid rules of gender expression. Would make my transition that much easier. However, since that's not likely to happen, I'll make do."

One is that a lot of them seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to be transgender, and they haven't gotten over that for many reasons, such as being surrounded by a very antitrans perspective.    Some of them definitely have some form of personality disorders, such as sadism (amy_amy, beebo, etc), obsession (this one seems pretty common) or exteme narcissism (neckbeard).  It seems to me that many of them were raised in a very conservative environment and just have some viewpoints leftover from there as well.  This also explans the strange unjustified homophobia and misogyny in the sub."
GenderCynical,33kxop,dysphoricfoot,5,Sun Apr 26 09:16:33 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with at least one part of your statment    modern psychology tells us that people aren't usually intrinsically evil   We already know children can be incredibly cruel to one another when faced with peer pressure. Being part of a group is intrinsic to social animals, which humans are and a part of that come with conforming to the norms of whichever group you inhabit, it just so happens that negative behaviour can arise from that without the need for there to be any form of mental health issue or difficulty. Also sometimes its less about mental illness and more about socioevironmental factors and upbringing. Someone can be brought up to be cruel without there necessarily being an underlying mental health condition.  In all honesty yes some cruel or evil people may be suffering from some form of extreme cognitive or mental stress,  (to also say evil behaviour arises from mental illness is a complete oversimplification of the nuances and behavioural issues that can arise from having mental health issues) but lets not forget that some people are just assholes, or have an abrasive and hateful personality. To boil it down to simply mental health issues is disrespectful to those who suffer genuine mental health issues, is disrespectful to our own community because it make their insults and attacks a symptom of their health issues and not a case of hate, and is disrespectful to their community because it assumes that negative opinion can only arise from them being mentally ill or less than stable.  They are human, and if we ever forget that then we will be just as bad as them, and whether it comes from a place of mental illness/instability or simply because they are hateful, its just another part of being human.  As a last statement, we are a dualitious race, in that we can hold both positive and negative opinions, we can make horrible travesties poetic, while hating the evils of the same travesties. We are neither inherently 'good' or 'bad' we're humans and are capable of doing great things, on either side of morality"
GenderCynical,33kxop,AutumnLily11,6,Thu Apr 23 22:28:09 2015 UTC,"They're not evil, just run of the mill bigots.  We challenge one of their core beliefs, that is gender is entirely a social construct.  Rather the change that core belief (which is hard for people to do) or live and let live (much easier if your not an asshole) they lash out at those who challenge their views.  This is no different from a Christian who deeply believe homosexuality is a sin.  Like Christians they see advocacy for our acceptance as a challenge to their beliefs that will ultimately harm them.  Another thing I have noticed that many have struggled with their own gender issues, I am not saying they are closeted trans folk or anything (some are though) I mean they are resentful of the roles society has imposed on the due to their sex, something I can empathize with greatly.  Many confuse this resentment with gender dysphoria and go through a trans phase.  When they realize that transition has not solved any of their problems they become upset with ""trans ideology"" that they feel led them down a harmful path.  And yeah cis people pissed about gender roles are not gonna be happy with transition.  I'm still pissed and resentful about gender roles myself but transition isn't meant to fix that problem.  Some of them simply had a bad experience with a trans person either in real life or on the Internet (peak trans they call it).  Being as they are assholes the extend the characteristics of the one person and apply it to everyone in that group and judge them accordingly.  That just regular run of the mill prejudice.  Sine their are ""gender critical communities"" they have a place to go to vent and share their frustrations and have their prejudice repeated and amplified back to them just increasing said prejudice.  Honestly they are less dangerous then most bigots and really should just be ignored.  I have issues doing this myself (since I am here in this sub) but that is because i owe many closeted years of my life to reading their shit and internalizing it when I was just a kid trying to come to terms with myself."
GenderCynical,33kxop,dysphoricfoot,3,Thu Apr 23 11:07:50 2015 UTC,"I never called them evil. I think i explicitly avoided that, if I didn't my apologies, an error in making myself understood.   My point was that taking a step back from any personal involvement in the situation, from any situation that involves bigots, some of them suffer issues that either cause the bigotry and exacerbate it, some are ignorant of the matter at hand and get angry that they have trouble understanding this new information, but some of them are just choosing to be assholes because it makes them feel good to put other down, or maybe they just like being inflammatory. That's the nature of autonomy, sometimes we need to accept that peiple can choose to assholes for any reason, or no reason. That's all. I don't disagree that they may have their reasons, in fact I support trying to rationally theorise about it, but as you say it can be hard to ignore them, it attacks trans people, at their very core, we've been accused of some sensationalistic bullshit in regards to our social demeanor and mental health, so wary caution may be well advised there as well.   As I have said before we are not a group of mentally ill, predatory anythings. We're people, just like anyone else, we're a nuanced and varied group, but not one of us deserves to be hit constantly with their bigotry and bullshit."
GenderCynical,33kxop,AutumnLily11,3,Thu Apr 23 12:21:25 2015 UTC,Sorry I meant to reply to the post not your comment!  I completely agree with what you wrote.
GenderCynical,33kxop,AutumnLily11,3,Thu Apr 23 12:36:30 2015 UTC,No worries xD it happens to us all at some point =]  Again my reply wasn't meant in a combatative or argumentative way. I love having conversations like this as understanding human behaviour really gets my brain juices flowing xD
GenderCynical,33kxop,AutumnLily11,6,Thu Apr 23 16:52:49 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand me. Even if you discount mental illness, there are predisposing factors. People aren't born hateful assholes, things happen that make that become the case - yes, conforming to a perpetual mob mentality counts as one of those factors. Yes, mental illness can often also be one of those factors, so it would be dishonest to exclude it from any formulation here - most of my post discussed human behavioural phenomena rather than mental illness (hence, forgive me if I wholeheartedly disagree that I ""boiled it down to mental health issues"" - I wasn't even proposing anything, merely asking and providing a range of potential considerations. I myself suffer from bipolar disorder and occasionally hear persecutory voices in my head, and people consequently seem to think I'm dangerous, so I take those accusations quite seriously!)  I'm taking it from your post that you similarly misunderstood (perhaps I wasn't clear?) my rape apologist analogy: I'm referring to the TERFs as the victim blamers, not us, as the example of ""psychologically familiar"" people being evil.  As said, I'm asking why TERFs become as they are, and wondering if anyone has insight into this. You're not just ""born"" a TERF, something has to happen along the way to make you one. What, usually, is it? It makes no sense to just rule it out as ""They're just assholes"", it provides no explanatory power nor any useful models we can use. Why aren't all assholes TERFs, and vice versa?"
GenderCynical,33kxop,mollymollykelkel,4,Thu Apr 23 16:59:18 2015 UTC,"Actually I never saw the rape apologism analogy. I got on a roll about something and forgot to read it xD  Sorry if I came across as inflammatory or accusatory, that was not my intention. In fact I agree with a lot you have said, I just think that sometimes we need to accept that being hateful might be due to internal factors that aren't related to anything except their personality, but as I said as humans we aren't inherently (or intrinsically) good or evil/loving or hateful, I would say that humans are intrinsically malleable, and yes I agree that someone may be predisposed towards bigoted beliefs, just as someone may be more disposed towards more charitable behaviours.  Again it may have been my interpretation of what you wrote, but it felt like blaming it on mental illness was to detract from how negative the behaviour is, as well as ignoring the possibility that some of these people are just arseholes (personal experience tells me the latter is more likely but thats confirmation bias) as you say, that wasn't something you meant by what you said so i am inclined to believe it was either a misread on my part or a misinterpretation.   When I say they are just assholes, that's not an explanation of their behaviour, just an identifier for their behaviour. They may be an asshole for many reasons, one reason or no reason. People can choose to be ignorant, and people can choose to be arseholes. Though it is more likely that these people themselves aren't really aware of the nuances of their own sub-concious mind.  However, in all my ranting, please don't think that I am against questioning, and trying to form a rational theory around their behaviour. I am, I would love to know what it is that makes them so hateful towards transwomen (transmen get hate to I know, but terfs seem to give them less of a hard time) and I'm pretty sure that their lipservice to the concept of 'once and x always an x' is just that, lipservice and a convienent scapegoat they can clutch to (even though science marches onwards and tell them they are wrong).  I would also put forward that chances are each terf has their own reasons for their bigotry and/or ignorance, and I would actually guess that some of them wouldn't be as vile or vehement in their hate and anger if it weren't for having a sympathetic group (safety in numbers, and echo chambers of hate do tend to dissolve down to the basest and most vile opinions possible, even if some individuals disagree with the strength of the collective opinion, peer pressure and fear of othering stop any form of critical discussion within their ranks)  Again my apologies for my abrasiveness, it was not my intention"
GenderCynical,33kxop,AutumnLily11,4,Thu Apr 23 11:49:33 2015 UTC,"Ah, no, it's fine! I wasn't sure how to really word what I meant in the original post, so I did kinda expect my thoughts and suppositions to not come across as well as I'd hoped. Yeah, I don't want sympathy to their behaviour or anything, god no, I think we'd all agree that people who ask us to ""think more about cis people"" with regards to us sometimes being abrasive need to fuck off and think more about trans people; maybe they'd realise that combining dysphoria with living in a society where you're constantly berated and victimized for it might make one pretty agitated and short-fused, very understandably. I do agree, it's unlikely mental health is a significant component there, but heh, yeah, was just wondering for sakes of logical honesty.  I do definitely see what you mean with regards to the group effects though. I think we witness this here first-hand with regards to MRAs: people otherwise-inclined to it for their own reasons seem to turn more extreme and hateful because of the sympathies of the groups they overlap with. The entire narrative becomes compartmentalized away from the real world and reinforced internally, and us-and-them starts taking over. People predisposed to being assholes are given the fertilizer to grow into them by the environment.  Sorry if I was at all rash or seemed excusatory of awful behaviour, it wasn't the intention! I'm not the clearest communicator lol."
GenderCynical,33kxop,ImAWafflecone,3,Thu Apr 23 12:11:51 2015 UTC,"No worries. Miscommunication happens sometimes, and seems we both had a hand in it.  As for what spurs them to these behaviours and beliefs in the first place, I don't know, though that would be intesting to know, as said whole group dynamics and crowd psychology can explain to an extent why their behaviour/beliefs get worse, sometimes it does seem awfully personal with GC and G_C, which would lead me to guess that many of them have personal experiences that already make them hostile to amab people, how that connects to the hatred of transwomen specifically I don't know. I'd be happy to hear any thoughts or theories.  I am glad we cleard up the error in communication, and don't worry you are very eloquent =]"
GenderCynical,33kxop,ViolenceIsTerrible,3,Thu Apr 23 13:32:57 2015 UTC,This Nova episode presents some interesting information regarding violent children. I agree that it's a combination of environment and genetics.
GenderCynical,33kxop,ramen_diet,3,Thu Apr 23 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"More often than not I think children are more swayed by society and external factors than adults, for some obvious reasons. A lack of social awareness, ignorance to social customs etc that's not to say genetics doesn't play into how malleable a child is to the likes of peer pressure or the differences between social advancedness (eur... not a word I don't think xD) which leads to the fact that not all children are easily influenced, again due to genetics and environment.  It always seems so complicated from an outside point of view (and sometimes I honestly believe that terts are incapable of realising that since they cling to the concept that early socialisation is completely permanent. I have some stories (read personal experiences) that blow that out of the water, though i suppose you could argue exception to the rule but no singular person is that special that they defy nature in ways no one else does, so invoking occams razor suggets that the simplest explanation is that socialisation is an ongoing experience and can be changed drastically in individual p.s. sorry for the mini-rant) but in reality the concept that nature and nurture work hand in hand makes a helluva lot of sense really. We're not born fully formed (physically or mentally) and as we grow our opinions and behaviours can change, while some habits or illnesses (mental or physical) refuse to budge. So yeah, nature and nurture must exists in a eternal state of back and forth, and neither has a completely permanent affect on anyone (behaviours changing etc etc)"
GenderCynical,33kxop,tacosprinkles,3,Thu Apr 23 22:04:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's because trans people threaten how they perceive their identity.   Believing trans women are women would call into question their whole self-concept, because they believe womanhood can't exist if you control for female socialization.  So they take on a strong anti-trans bias to uphold their own sense of self."
GenderCynical,33kxop,a_username_0,3,Thu Apr 23 22:15:28 2015 UTC,"I used to identify as agender and gender critical. And though I'm a transwoman, I'm still a bit that way, in some ways.  For me, it was always a fear of marginalizing gender non-conformity in cisgender people. Of reinforcing biosexism. Neurosexism like the idea that men are better at math and science and think differently. Or that men are stronger. I was afraid of transpeople and gender identity being used to essentialize men and women. And gender identity being used to promote gender stereotypes and neurosexism.  Of course, even then, I never believed in excluding transpeople or discriminating against us. Even when I went by calling my gender critical, I was more concerned, than anything, by neurosexism. And would use the word gender critical when criticizing people like Simon Baron-Cohen and Satoshi Kanazawa.  For a long time, I felt we should all aspire to being agender, as a way of stopping sexism and Patriarchy. And that it would be best if we all avoided traditional gender pronouns and words like he or she. Again, for me, it comes from a deep fear of neurosexism and the history of biosexism. And a fear of gender roles and stereotypes."

GenderCynical,33kxop,Threehundredsixtysix,3,Thu Apr 23 16:06:02 2015 UTC,"I think what you're asking more generally is what makes someone an extremist?  That's all TERFs really are at the end of the day.  What causes them to lash out is beyond me.  I do know that they have a very different perspective and use of language.  They see gender as wholly constructed and sex as a static trait.  Because of this their prime targets are non-passing trans women whose bodies might be much more masculine than the majority of women.  To TERFs, someone assigned male at birth saying ""I want to be a woman."" means ""I want to embody a subservient and unequal position in society relative to males and quite possibly am deluded into thinking that I am a female even though I wasn't born with the proper reproductive organs.""  They believe that the only thing that separates males and females is the capacity to give birth and that in all other ways the sexs are biologically equal.  To them, the rest is all social construct.  Which is why they hate and trash studies that show sexual dimorphism in brain structures.  It's basically a really ugly miscommunication due to differences of opinion on what is meant when one says ""man"" or ""woman"" or ""male"" or ""female"".  They have a VERY different world view and when they're presented with information they try very hard to make it fit.  What causes them to act in such extreme ways is something that I think you can only learn from them.  I'm going to guess that it's fear because the existence of trans people challenges a corner stone their perspective of the world.  In alot of ways their also extremely conservative, relying on ideas that were generated 30-40 years ago."
GenderCynical,33kxop,doodlebug_firefy,7,Sun Apr 26 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"The opinion of ""The vast majority of the world"" doesn't matter in the slightest to science. And part of the problem is that people such as yourself insist that ""biological sex"" is being called a social convention. Nobody on this side of the argument is saying that. Do you accept a clear difference between ""brain"" and ""mind""? Because what I'm getting at is that: a person's brain is purely physical, and part of their complex body. The mind, although not fully understood, is shaped partly by hormones and partly by nurture.   You are insisting that ""mind"" doesn't exist. That a person's consciousness, their strong sense of identity, their self, is mistaken if it doesn't align 100% with what their body is. We disagree with that. Human physiology is more complex than you are willing to accept. You insist on applying ""man"" and ""woman"" to only the physical body, and leave the mind, the self-identity, out of it."

""Over the past few years she lost her hair and she just wasn't the same Susan that she started off being,"" Mattie said.   No mention of being her trans from the community, but I'm sure that's just the trans cabal controlling the media as per usual.   EDIT: Closest thing I could find was a comment on a news article by someone confusing Susan Monica with Susan Larson, which is actually pretty funny."

GenderCynical,33il1h,lockedge,12,Wed Apr 22 23:58:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seems the GCers jumped the gun on claiming the perp was trans. All because she doesn't look like a typical woman...which is kind of ironic from them. But then again, their 'feminism' seems to ignore bald women, holds up patriarchal beauty standards, and push an idea that women cannot be violent(which, again, is drawn from tasty white patriarchal beliefs on female fragility, purity and weakness).

There are quite a few other articles about this woman's convictions. None have even hinted that she's transgendered. The fact that one commenter thinks there is now a conspiracy among the media to hide transpeople's true identity so as to blur crime statistics for men and women boggles the mind."

Women don't normally murder, hack bodies apart, or hitchhike, so it's reasonable to doubt if they're really a woman.""  SUCH MISOGYNY IT HURTS. THESE PEOPLE CALL THEMSELVES 'FEMINISTS'.

Just for context, Daily Mail columnist Richard Littlejohn is among one of the nastiest pieces of scum to be given a soapbox by the right-wing hate rag. Following the murder of 5 women in Ipswich in 2006, he went on a rant about the victims, claiming that because they were sex workers, they were no loss to society and that we didn't lose out on a cure for cancer. Years later, he was still grinding the axe against them, angry with the fact that others in the media were refering to them as 'women who worked as prostitutes' instead of just prostitutes, because to his mind that's all they were and how dare anyone try to humanize them. Just so we're absolutely clear on the kind of publication this is.   But hey, Littlejohn and the Daily Heil were also responsible in hounding trans woman Lucy Meadows to death, so TERFs can forgive all the woman hating, immigrant bashing, homophobic crap the rag usually gets up to. Just as long as they hate trans people, that's the important thing."

TiA also doesn't like genderqueer, which is in no way comparable to otherkin, most kinds of feminism, period (lol, right, man hating), among the many other things in there."

The term itself is used against actual trans people by GC types so please don't use it here. Hopefully that doesn't come off as too brash.

The sub /r/TiADiscussion is a great place.  TiA makes fun of terfs, tucutes, otherkin, headmates, and republicans.

Which, as usual from that subreddit, is a very conservative viewpoint, right? To me it seems almost very similar to the bootstraps bootstraps bootstraps arguments that conservatives make. But I'm sorry, as a progressive - and I'm not sure it's possible to be a feminist and not a progressive - I look at that and say, look, I'm really very sorry that your thing was terrible, and what I'd like to do is to try to minimize the number of terrible things people have to deal with in the future, because nobody should be expected to just grin and bear it, and you deserve better than that with your thing as much as I do with mine.

Social psychologists have developed several theories for explaining the ways in which the psychology of a crowd differs from and interacts with that of the individuals within it. Major theorists in crowd psychology include Gustave Le Bon, Gabriel Tarde, Sigmund Freud and Steve Reicher. This field relates to the behaviors and thought processes of both the individual crowd members and the crowd as an entity.  Crowd behavior is heavily influenced by the loss of responsibility of the individual and the impression of universality of behavior, both of which increase with the size of the crowd.

GenderCynical,32lv44,ramen_diet,6,Tue Apr 14 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"This is what she said to the press in 91 after ejecting a trans woman:   Some letters have been printed in the press in recent weeks  regarding the womon-only policy at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival as it relates to trannsexuals participating in the event.  We would like to clarify our policy and explain the circumstances which brought it to light this last August.  In the simplest of terms, the Michigan Festival is and always has been an event for womyn, and this continues to be defined as womyn born womyn.  We respect everyone's right to define themselves as they wish.  It's unfortunate that our choice to offer the Michigan Festival as an event for womyn-born-womyn is being construed by some as a position on the merits of people making individual choices on  how to live.  We only mean to define who this event is for. We hold dearly our right to make this determination and in the same regard we believe that is the right of every other womyn's institution and community to define these issues depending on their own particular needs and concerns.  We regret that the circumstances at this year's festival may have been a result of a lack of current public information on this policy. We think it is understandable that our priority would not be centered around who our event is ""not"" for, and we have deliberately refrained from placing our focus in that direction, though we have always been definite about our policy when asked.  When is was clear this summer there was a known transsexual man [sic] attending the event, the festival security staff dealt with it [sic] as respectfully as possible."
GenderCynical,32lv44,ramen_diet,0,Tue Apr 14 23:01:53 2015 UTC,"Notice that almost all communication from Vogel and Michfest since then has almost exclusively used the term ""intention,"" likely because an official ""policy"" would create legal hurdles for them due to laws against sex discrimination in events open to the public."

I'm sure they could certainly make the event as hostile to the targeted ""other"" as possible without breaking laws, but they all seem to stop prior to posting ""no coloreds"" or ""no women"" or : no old trolls"" or ""no fat chicks"" or ""no AMABs"" signs at the gate.

GenderCynical,32ho0p,mollymollykelkel,11,Mon Apr 13 21:49:52 2015 UTC,What bothers me the most about this argument is that it insists physical sex is the ultimate end when it comes to identification. Yet male and female have meanings beyond penis and vagina. To deny this is naive at best. These words will likely never lose their gendered definitions even if TERFs have their way. The solution here is to simply come up with new terms but noooo this erases oppression and reinforces the gender binary.
GenderCynical,32ho0p,Freya-Freed,14,Mon Apr 13 23:10:13 2015 UTC,"The problem lies in claiming to be a ""radical feminist"" but treating ""woman"" as anything other then a political class, that is oppressed by another class (""men""). Our shared oppression comes from being part of that class, which is political, not biological. Though it may involve biological elements, like limiting access to abortion. Radical feminism is recognizing that ""man"" is a class that oppresses the class ""woman"" and fighting that oppression.   This political womanhood, also referred to as the ""sex class"", is involuntary. And it is ridiculous to state that trans women are not part of this class. Even if most of the world screams very loud that they see us as men, we are not treated as men. We do not share the same class with men. And as such we are part of the sex class, we are political women, and we are subject to male dominance. There is plenty of evidence of this.   And to illustrate how fucking evident this is, one only need to open up google and type in ""tranny porn"" to see how trans women are made into an object for use by men. Like everyone who is part of the sex class, we are subjugated by male dominance.  Turning woman into a biological class distinct from men (making them ""other"") is what male oppression is founded on in the first place. It is biological essentialism. And is most certainly not radical feminism. But it is ""gender critical"" feminism."

Nonetheless, transgender women, absolutely a political underclass.

GenderCynical,32ho0p,Pterodactylism,9,Tue Apr 14 04:55:22 2015 UTC,"The problem with suggesting we all join together and talk it out is this. It would be obscenely dehumanizing to pretend that the historically and presently obvious oppression of trans women and those like them is debatable—or that the notion of trans women as perverts, pretenders, and rapists is entertainable. I've expended tens of thousands of words and many, many hours of my time arguing with TERFs in r/gendercritical and elsewhere, and some of those were spent well. But when I or others describe the intense existential pain inherent in being called a ""man"" when your mind is screaming otherwise, or the torment of having a body that isn't yours, or the humiliations, microagressions, harrassment, and hatred directed at many trans women simply for existing—and the wise gender critical warrior responds by flatly denying your lived reality, by saying that you're lying or delusional—what more can be done? At what point are we allowed to throw our hands in the air and exclaim that bigots will be bigots?  There is an inherent discrepancy in emotional capital when an oppressed person argues for their right not to be oppressed. Those conversations are heart-wrenching—for one of us, are completely exhausting—for one of us, and are only rarely and mildly productive for either of us.  A man who responds with incredulity and blame when a woman describes to him her daily gauntlet of street harassment should be told to sit down and listen. It would be absurd to ask that woman to engage in a protracted, emotionally draining argument that may indeed end in her being called a bitch anyway. It is similarly absurd to ask us to debate our powerfully necessary, self-evident lives and struggles with people who spend much of their free time mocking us on the internet. It's a hill on which I am no longer willing to die. I've done enough dying elsewhere."

For more understanding people on both sides, it may be possible to come to an understanding. Some people are uncomfortable with gender and gender identity. And have many concerns about gender stereotypes, neurosexism and biosexism, which are very valid.  I feel like coming together to express concern over ideas like gender stereotypes and biosexism, is something we should try to do.

But I believe the fundamental problem with attempting to reconcile my gender criticism with that of TERFs is the obvious: conversing with someone who blames your very attempts at survival for all the misogyny in the world is bloody exhausting. And discussing this with fellow trans people can be difficult because many them (us) are—predictably—wary of being attacked. Gender is an institution that harms trans woman more than almost anyone, so it's a shame that gender criticism itself has been co-opted and connotationally tainted by people who are unmoved, or in some cases even delighted, by trans suffering.  To use a convenient example, the person I was replying to when I wrote that comment engaged me via PM in what began as a civil discussion about the disagreements between trans people and TERFs. But I had to cut it short (rudely, I admit) after a few long messages, because the person seemed hellbent on blaming it all on the (apparently) vicious, angry, violent trans community and kept referring to trans women as ""males"" and ""men"". As I mentioned in my last comment here, I have feelings! And it's just very difficult for me to discuss these topics when people so frequently use hurtful language and cling to conventionally transphobic frameworks of transgenderness. I feel like I'm pushing a boulder up a hill, you know?  Anyhow, you're not alone in being a trans-positive trans person who is thoughtful about gender stereotypes and all that, and it's a bit of an uphill battle, but I'm not about to stop trying and I hope you don't either. One of my favorite bloggers is a really nice, smart, and eloquent Chicana trans woman who sometimes talks about these things in a compassionate and anti-colonial way (in addition to philosophy, radical left politics, and her life). Her url is genderkills.tumblr.com, but it looks like her page is only visible through the mobile tumblr app now. There used to be another really cool person by the name of camabradfem, but it seems their blog has closed up shop. : /  I'll stop rambling now!"
GenderCynical,32ho0p,ViolenceIsTerrible,1 point,Tue May 12 22:37:11 2015 UTC,"I guess we agree more than we disagree, then, that's wonderful. I'm not for being trans-exclusionary or transphobic. And I know that many people don't want to be reasoned with. I just wanted to promote the idea that being a gender critical radical feminist can be okay, and you can feel that way and promote gender criticism, without being transphobic and trans-exclusionary.  So I'm glad we agree. I can't say that I disagree with a single thing that you've wrote. Our mental health as transpeople is more important that trying to spread awareness and understanding about us to everyone, especially if people won't try to listen.  I've been told by some people that running away from such things is, for your mental health, is running away, and escapism, and being unable to listen to criticism or other points of view, which stops you from growing. But I disagree, you have to put your own health first and the most important.  Thank you for taking the time to write all this as a response."

If we don't prioritize self care, nothing else we do can be done with excellence.  Another thing I should probably do in the name of self care is stop reading the opinions of TERFs. It's starting to affect my self esteem, and at this point I understand (and can refute) their positions well enough that it's not doing me any good to read either the vitriol or the political theory any longer. The abyss stares back indeed.  But I wish you the best of luck in all your pursuits, friend! May compassion guide you. <3"

It makes sense that you don't want to keep banging your head and heart against that wall when it doesn't seem to make a lick of difference.  But there are people out there like me, unaffiliated and genuinely interested in listening closely to both sides, and deciding for myself where the truth lies--and the truth is not just facts and principles, but also lived experiences which can't be compressed into a rational debate.  I see the truth that both sides offer, and I see the ideological conflict, and I see possibilities for bridging that conflict...and then I see how quickly I am told to fuck off (by a moderator!) for expressing the mere wish that we could have a reasonable discussion.

Do you sit on internet forums and say ""I want to decide for myself where the truth lies, between the stormfronters and black people""? Don't you get it? TERFs hate trans women. They actually hurt trans women when they claim they are all men who only transition to invade women's spaces and whatever else. They are actually harming people. You don't get to sit your cowardly ass on the fence in this and expect trans women, and the people who care about trans women, to respect you for that."
GenderCynical,32ho0p,skye_em,3,Wed Apr 15 05:43:24 2015 UTC,"What are the possibilities you see for bridging the conflict, femininist? I racked my brain the past couple weeks in trying to appeal to something they could at least agree on and then build up from there on both factions of the gender critical subs, but in the end I couldn't keep, like you say, banging my head and heart against that wall when it doesn't seem to make a lick of difference. Thankfully I was banned from both, because obviously I wasn't going to stop trying until it killed me, and it brought me to brink a couple a times. I'm ashamed to say I was almost convinced a couple times to detransition and simply 'help to expand the category of 'male'' through simply genderfucking/genderbending, which I figured out they love over there. But, they contradict themselves when they draw a line and exclude trans identities. In the end, thank fucking god, a trans friend who's always there for me shook me out of that shit and kept me going till I saw the torture of their ways. They're like the 'Scientology' of gender movements, and they're as vicious as that cult is."
GenderCynical,32ho0p,femininist,-2,Wed Apr 22 03:25:19 2015 UTC,"I saw you over there, giving it your all.  You've got some interesting ideas.  I think your language was too academic for them though :)  I see the gendercritters more like atheists: yes they're right about the thing they're narrowly focusing on, but they're also assholes about it, and they're missing the larger picture.    For the sake of the whole movement, I think we need to let 'male/female' mean a person's natal biological reproductive capacities (even if nonfunctioning or ultimately removed).  Otherwise, reasonable people (like doctors) think this identity business is nuts.    Yes, that gives radfems the semantic opening to exclude trans women from their discussions and spaces.  So be it.  Trans women should stop demanding access, and radfems should stop attacking and mocking trans women.  This seems to me to be a very small concession, but it takes most of the wind out of their argument.  If they continued to attack, they would look more and more like a vile hate group, and trans people would come out looking more reasonable and sympathetic.  So I think this could be a reasonable truce."
GenderCynical,32ho0p,skye_em,3,Wed Apr 22 09:03:44 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... I think ""for the sake of the whole movement"" you're not going to get any (binary) mtf or ftm trans person to not identify as female & male, respectively. Now I'll just sit back and watch the aftermath unfold from the pandora's box you just opened.   I don't even identify binarily, but ""male"" is not a word that descibes how I identify in the least. Genderqueer, transfeminine, and when I have to simplify things for those who can only process gender in terms if the binary, I'm female, full stop.    Like seriously though, ""reasonable people (like doctors)""???   ...Girls and guys, have at her."
GenderCynical,32ho0p,skye_em,2,Wed Apr 22 10:49:17 2015 UTC,"But really, you can't do that without immediately proposing a new nomenclature that would likely be accepted or at least not be ridiculous, and by ""can't do that"" I mean it's not wise because... Pandora's box.   I think you just lost lost any trans person here (binary or non-) who was considering possibly hearing what you might have to say. If I weren't in such a good mood today on my way to a free clinic to get my levels checked for my 3-month check up, I don't know, I don't know... PROpose away a new nomenclature."

But the reason people reacted that way is because it's easy to interpret comments like yours as unfair requests for neutrality. As Desmond Tutu said, ""If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.""  Again: while that may not be how you meant your comment, many transgender people are primed for uncritical demands for their emotional labor because it happens so often, even in social justice circles. People get fed up with it and begin to assume that everyone with a ""let's talk about it"" stance is secretly a hateful TERF or ignorant transphobe, because unfortunately that's often how it turns out in the end.  I may not have much free time in the coming days but, despite my exhaustion, I remain committed to compassionate communication, education, and intersectionality. I believe I have a reasonably strong grasp on the nature of this conflict and a well-shaped critique of the failings of TERFism, so hopefully I'll have more time and energy sometime soon and, if you'd like, we can have a discussion."

Perhaps you can start a new sub, with you and Pterodactylism as the initial mods, but I think you'll wind up having to do a lot of banning in the beginning. Very few people can remain cool-headed in all this, especially when you have people who don't even read all that you have to say before hammering away at their preconceived retort.  If you two would allow me the privilege, although I'm new to reddit & new to TERFism, I'd really like to see what you two come up with and discuss.

But keep sitting on that high horse over there.   and then I see how quickly I am told to fuck off    And how do we know you are even worth our time? So many people ""listening"" to both sides have I talked to. People supposedly ""on the fence"" about the reality of our oppression, which is fucking obvious if you don't live under a rock. And in the end we give them discussion, and they still end up on /r/gendercritical or other such groups.  And always someone like you comes in to our spaces and is like ""BUT HAVE YOU TRIED HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS??!!!?"". Yes, we fucking have. We have these kinds of discussions everyday having to defend our fucking existence to people. And it's fucking tiring. Can you imagine?  At what point are we allowed to decide that some ""discussions"" just aren't worth having and focus on more productive things part of which includes, you know, living our lives? At what point are we allowed to do that without someone like you, who is privileged with not having to experience the oppression that trans people face, coming into our spaces and telling us how you think we should respond to that oppression? Because obviously you know so much better then us????  So yeah, fuck off sounds like a pretty reasonable response to me given those circumstances. And I'm tempted to underline that fuck off with a ban.

Society needs to be more accepting of gay people.  Conversion therapy for trans people is 100% correct.  There is no such thing as trans.  If there was, there would be a clear verifiable biological source for it.  Since there isn't, being trans is clearly a mental illness or a paraphilic perversion.

GenderCynical,31w5dp,IsupportLGBT_nohomo,6,Wed Apr 8 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"I'd rather watch women's figure skating than men's because the idea of being graceful is much more aesthetic in women's competitions. But men are better if you're talking about technicality. Men can do quad jumps and women don't try to land them in competition. Men seem to be able to do big jumps later in their programs, too.   It's an interesting subject though. Watching the special about Tanya Harding was so interesting. She had it pretty rough being a tomboy in a sport where having princess-like grace is part of how you're judged, or even pre-judged for how you act off the ice. She could do big triple axels when almost all women couldn't. That jump was equal to what the men were doing at the time. She seemed to think landing those axels should put her over the top, but they didn't. She didn't fit in. It's probably one if the most recent and public examples of a systemic punishment of un-feminine athletes for being too strong or too tomboyish. It still happens all the time, mostly towards black women (Venus Williams, Brittney Griner). But the Tanya Harding thing transcended sports, and ruined two careers.

But taking a stand against biosexism and neurosexism has always been important to me, even before I knew much about feminism.  I agree with and support this message, and, as a transwoman, I don't agree with trans-exclusionary feminism.  I feel like, if there's anything that gender critical feminists and transfeminists ought to be able to come to an agreement on, it's how harmful and terrible neurosexism and biosexism are. That mainstream science is filled with Patriarchal biases. That there's no such thing as a ""male brain"" or ""female brain"", and that gender stereotypes are very harmful.  Just as my gender identity matters to me, so, too, is standing against biosexism a very important thing to me. And I think it is very tragic that many people try to use us, to try to promote biotruths. And that's something that many gender critical feminists focus on. To many gender critical feminists, we should all be agender, and closely relate gender identity with gender roles, stereotypes, and historical and modern scientific sexism.   I definitely believe in women's strength. Ciswomen have been historically been treated as biologically inferior to men. And this is a very serious problem for women.

If course haters compare it to an open wound, a non-functional facsimile of a vag. But, hell, even other trans people say the same shit. I thought the same thing. I'm pretty sure at some point early in my transition I probably said to others that I didn't want an ugly, non-functional whatever... probably said that where post-op women could hear it.   Anyway, it sucks to read stuff like that all the time. I know that the shitty things people day about my surgery results are wrong, but it still hurts.

Which surgeons have you consulted with? Which graft site do you think is best for phalloplasty? You are aware that metiodioplasty generally leaves most of the nerves intact, right? And that people having that surgery report very good sensation and orgasm function?  And were you are that nerves regrow? And that the cutting edge of phalloplasty is to use microsurgery to attach nerves for tactile and sexual sensation?  Nooooo?  You didn't know that? THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD SHUT THE FUCK UP."
GenderCynical,31v9id,Notfaye,-4,Thu Apr 9 13:48:50 2015 UTC,"well the number of specialists in the field, would obviously make me being one, well improbable. but I can answer some of your questions.  Best graph site for phalloplasty?  one, met is better choice generally  two: it depends on what you and your doctor decide based on a few factors, the ""best"" is the one with the best vasculization, to try and promote nerve regrowth (same for any surgery in which you wish the graft to have tactile function). But your best might be the one that has the least visible scaring.  leaves most of the nerves in tact- I must admit since it's not my field I've never seen a medical journal that supports that, met in your context also implies a package of surgeries. If we're talking about one minimally invasive surgery, yes it's possible to keep some nerves in tact, that chance goes down if you continue on with more basic quality of life surgeries. This is a base truth to all surgery  I've seen some people self report good results, generally I'd be looking for something peer edited.  The cutting edge uses microsurgery nerve repair: Microsurgery nerve attachment in the PNS has been being done since the 80s, It has a generally low success rate (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1201001/ <40% success rate here, which is pretty common) Are you implying this would be an option for most FtM patients? this requires a surgeon with multiple rare specializations.  nerves regrow- scientifically, there are several physiological reasons this normally doesn't happen. It may happen, you may walk after your spine is crushed.  So I think you got off track by listing rare possibilies as having even average success rates. yes there is a fraction of people who may have feeling, yes some surgeons have some minimal success at nerve reconnection, yes because an orgasam is a response to a certain frequency of action potentials, it can be achieved in many different ways.   I mentioned I conflated a bit,  it's possible to throw a handful of quarters into the air and have them all land heads up, but people who actually consult with their surgeon will be asked to acknowledge the realistic expectations of the surgery and due to the realities stated above..................  tl;dr more MtFs will opt for surgery then FtMs"

No, it's to say that what defines being LGBTQ is in fact the lack of choice. To say that nobody has a choice about their ethnicity is not to say that one ethnicity is lesser, but similarly there is no choice in the matter.   Plenty of people DO make the choice to live non-heterosexual lives. Don't remove agency from queers.   That's called appropriation.   There's no gay gene. There's only inconclusive evidence about biology. We know very little about it, so stop making needless apologetic assumptions.   But it's not just genetics, is it? In the case of orientation, it's hormones, it's early childhood psychology. All 3 play a role, but the end result is that sexual orientation as defined by sexual attraction is unchangable.    I don't think many here seem to get the key here: so what if it isn't clearly innate?   And my disagreement with you wasn't based on your attempt to argue that it wouldn't be wrong even if it wasn't, it's the negative extrensic effects and how it's apologia for appropriative movements."

Ok let's assume that there was at some point in the future a drastic reversal in evidence on this topic occurs, and contrary to all the studies of the day  belief people can actually make a conscious decision to change what gender they are attracted to.  In that case, then there is no orientation and inherently no oppression of gay people because gay people aren't a distinct group, but there would still be an oppression of people who have homosexual sex which is rooted in patriarchy.  This is possible, but there have been many many studies on this topic, to find that they had all been wrong on this topic would not be akin to finding out unicorns are real, it would be akin to finding out that there are hundreds of millions of unicorns throughout the world that live in close proximity to where humans live and we simply haven't noticed them.

I'm not saying there's ways to change orientation or gender identity now or that there might be in any possible near future, I'm putting that hypothetical because it's important to keep in mind what the actual end result can be. It's not very far from biological arguments to pathologization, as just about anyone with a whiff of intersex can tell you.   In that case, then there is no orientation and inherently no oppression of gay people because gay people aren't a distinct group, but there would still be an oppression of people who have homosexual sex which is rooted in patriarchy.

It's also important for the self-acceptance of lgbtq people themselves.  Not to mention it's just the truth.  The fact that that it's inherently not shameful doesn't change these facts, while the population at large considers it as such it's necessary to emphasis. The mental health and well-bing and the political goal of reaching acceptance for lgbtq people should not be sacrificed for more general ideological goals and it's only apologetic if you chose to frame it as such.  ""Gay people were born this way, your discrimination against them is immoral"" is not more apologetic then making a similar claim against racism."
GenderCynical,31r2f9,AdumbroDeus,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"Inability? Seriously? Plenty of closet gay people living heterosexual lives. Plenty of open gay people living heteronormative lives.  Similarly, there are plenty of non-transitioning trans people who live as cis.  Might we have an aversion to those lifestyles? Sure, but transitioning - and living homosexual lives - are both choices we make. We're certainly capable of refusing to do so, and we do refuse at high rates.  Biology may affect same-sex attraction and gender identity, but lived experiences are based on choices.   And that's why people who are passing have such high suicide rates and according to patriarchal norms are still a failure.   Really? Plenty of differences are in-born and hates for it. If queer lifestyles WERE a choice, would that make it morally just to punish queers for making those choices?   A little basic propositional logic here.  The statement I presented:  If an attribute is inborn it is not ok to discriminate against it.  The inversion of this statement is this:  If an attribute is not inborn it is ok to discriminate against it.  You're arguing that the initial statement implies the inverse, so let's illustrate.  Let's take a true statement  ""All bats are mammals"".  Now let's take it's inverse:  ""If something is not a bat it is not a mammal""  Huh, that isn't true, and since the former is a true statement the latter cannot be implied by the former.  Of course there are statements where a statement and the inverse is true, this occurs when it's both a necessary and sufficient condition, such as in case when two clubs share 100% membership, you can state that if one is a member of one club they are a member of the other and it's inverse and be correct.  What this means is a statement has no effect on the truth value of it's inverse.  As such my statement has no effect on whether it's ok to discriminate on other non-inborn traits. Your implication that it does is simply poor Propositional Logic.   The only way that ALL queer and trans people will be free is when patriarchy is destroyed. Doesn't matter how you frame it. If racism, classism, misogyny, etc. still exist, some of us are still oppressed. Don't erase us.   It is the obligation of social justice groups to work on issues affecting them without creating negative impacts on other oppressed groups. If your solution is one that hurts a large population of vulnerable people for the ""greater good"" your solution is wrong.  Saying that sexuality is not a choice is not the only way to dismantle the patriarchy.    Except it is. This implies that if it were not in-born, it would be moral to discriminate.   Addressed above, faulty propositional logic.   Except no one ever had to argue that people of colour were born that way. It's pretty obvious.  Sexual orientation is a social construct, and the radical solution is to challenge the very notion of a ""sexually orientation"". And just because gays can marry and adopt doesn't mean all gays are free and equal.   Sexual orientation is a phrase constructed to describe biological facts, that some people are attracted to members of the same gender on a fundamental biological level, others are not. There is a massive body of scientific evidence attesting to this fact and not one bit discounting it. There is also a massive body of scientific evidence attesting to the fact that this attraction is not chosen.  In the past, it was understandable, but now with the body of scientific evidence we have we know that sexual orientation is biological fact and many protection for lgbt people are predicated on this lack of choice, not to mention that this is used to justify both discrimination and appropriation against queer people.  Fixing the patriarchy doesn't require lying about biology, if your philosophy thinks it does then you need a better conception of feminism."

The trans activist didn't get her article in on time, but they still published the TERF counterpart. Naturally this made the publication look biased towards TERFs, so they made a statement, distancing themselves from the transphobic article they published.  So now they're being called spineless by other TERFs, for making their stance more clear.  Also since I know the TERFs are reading this now, and they don't like the term TERF, I just wanna say the following: ""Sup TERFs? How's it goin?"""
GenderCynical,31blgk,BrandiMcC,12,Fri Apr 3 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"Why don't TERFs like the term TERF?

TERF."
GenderCynical,31blgk,gamerzap,11,Fri Apr 3 18:27:53 2015 UTC,It's probably because most people hate TERFs and if they publicly identify themselves as one it will make it clear to people that they can ignore anything they say.

The attitudes of one-true-way trans people are what is divisive and detrimental to the community and I can easily refer to the number of friends I have had over the years who were seriously put off by it to the point of being afraid of transitioning before they gained support outside the mainstream.  Trans people who happily misgender other trans people because of their own internalized transphobia and unexamined cis worship is the actual problem not calling out that shit. People who should damn well know better and don't and have hurt a lot of trans people over the years with this internalized nonsense."

GenderCynical,30u34i,a_username_0,2,Tue Mar 31 09:59:26 2015 UTC,It seems like it'd be difficult to think in binary terms and be genderqueer. They seem to be inherently at odds.   lol no. Binary-based and cissexist thought is fairly common.
GenderCynical,30u34i,Ebomb1,2,Tue Mar 31 14:27:39 2015 UTC,"Can you describe what a binary thinking genderqueer person would look like (figuratively speaking)?  Also, by cissexism do you mean body shaming and transphobia?"
GenderCynical,30u34i,a_username_0,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"By cissexism, I mean things like using af/mab and fe/male bodied interchangeably, and insisting that transitioning always changes your gender and never your sex. Or the semi-popular androphilic and gynephilic to mean attraction to genitals with the assumption that trans people retain their birth genitals or are in some way actually, permanently their assigned sex.  By binary thinking, I mean things like assuming (and ""educating"" others) that non-binary can only mean things between the binary genders, and extensions of that thinking like defining some behavior as masculine and deciding that it means someone else is expressing their ""male side.""   I've experienced all these in conversation with other non-binary people. The insistence that my transition was about my gender and not my sex and that my body would fall under gynephilic attraction (don't even get me started on skoliosexual) were particularly infuriating."
GenderCynical,30u34i,Ebomb1,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:11:17 2015 UTC,"... and insisting that transitioning always changes your gender and never your sex...   This extends into so many of the issues that we have.  I associate that more with people who presume extreme differences between men and women and believe that all aspects of sex and gender are fixed.  I guess I can see how its sort of associated with sexism.  To me sexism always seem to be about making presumptions about someone based on their sex, where this is more about making presumptions about ones sex.    ... or are in some way actually, permanently their assigned sex.   People keep gloaming on to chromosomes now when this perspective comes up with out actually understanding what DNA is or how it works.  Gotta understand the difference between genotype, phenotype, and morphology.     ... and extensions of that thinking like defining some behavior as masculine and deciding that it means someone else is expressing their ""male side.""    This discussion in asktg is talking about this very thing and the answers are pretty diverse.   Anything from behavior to fluctuating senses of self.  I don't know that these social terms are fixed and settled on yet which means that we're all going to be educated on each others experiences.    The defining of behaviors as masculine and feminine (and believing they're inherent to the sex, and that body dictates behavior) is what I've generally associated with sexism.  And have generally thought of binary thinking as more of a ""this or that"" sort of situation (which is pervasive and detrimental beyond thinking about gender and sex).    I guess I get it now, non-binary person with internalized binary thinking.  Seems right, yeah?"

We don't know how to ""fix"" the trans brain so that it reflects their assigned gender, we've tried many times, it doesn't work just like ex-gay therapy doesn't work, so the argument is that this means the brain doesn't need to be fixed at all, the body does.  But just because we don't currently know how to make someone feel ok with the fact they have a penis between their legs, does that mean chopping it off is the logical thing to do? What about, say, more research into the brain? I'm pretty sure it would be preferable to solve gender dysmorphia with the talking cure or even a pill instead of major surgery and hormone treatment.   The reason that transition is considered the treatment for gender dysphoria isn't just because therapy doesn't work, it's also because transition is shown to work almost all of the time.  I'm all for research into trying to find a way to get rid gender dysphoria without transition because that could create more options for people (I would probably take the option if I could-would make my life way easier), but that doesn't mean we shouldn't allow people to transition and it definitely doesn't mean we shouldn't allow people to transition right now when it is the only known treatment."
GenderCynical,30p8pt,gamerzap,12,Sun Mar 29 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, even if it was like ""NO YOU ARE DISEASED, WE WILL CURE YOU"" I would have transitioned and remained in transition in my little queer bubble because ultimately I HAD FUN. it may not be the experience of all trans people but as far as I care, the fact that it was ultimately my choice (and I mean it, I rushed so fast through some o the processes, completely avoiding the gatekeepery bullshit, it caused frictions with a few other people where I live; yay for bottom level support networks and I mean it) is all that really fucking matters and I would do it all again even if my life was down to this little Paris is Burning-esque circle of awesome queers.  If they gave a shit about bodily autonomy, whether it even registers as a medical treatment should probably be the last thing they care about seeing how a lot of medicalized conditions are not actually pro bodily autonomy."

Same thing with surgery. I'm pretty blase on the whole thing, which gets me in crossed horns with other trans people on a semi-regular basis. But when I stopped agonizing over identity and what my feelings ""made"" me, it was clearly a quality of life issue. I could do these things and get on with my life, or I could make my life about avoiding doing those things. It's clear they have no concern or even conception of quality of life issues. A therapy fix is preferable because it suits their ideology, period. The lives of the people they want to ""save"" are of no concern.   The faux concern about ""major surgery"" would be better directed at the huge number of elective cosmetic procedures undertaken by cis women, which far outstrips trans surgeries combined, are far less regulated wrt access, and which have complications comparable to trans procedures, in some cases more often and more severe. Where's the cry for a talking cure or a pill for every cis woman who has labiaplasty or lipo or abdominoplasty? Where's the call for legislation or gatekeeping? Absent, because it's far more satisfying and easy to scapegoat a minority for ""upholding gender"" instead of acknowledging the fingers pointing back at yourself."

Here we are with a rather interesting article (from last November, glad you're on top of this, TERFs) about whether or not it matters if there's actually a genetic reason for sexuality. Of course, it shouldn't matter whether the trait is genetic or socialized. People should be able to like whoever they like, express themselves however they want.  But then they bring trans people into it. Here's a great example:   There are posts where the questioners become very invested in ""proving"" or ""knowing"" that they are ""truly, and really trans."" When poked about that and questioned, some of the answers make it clear that somewhere deep down, some of these posters seem to think that they MUST be trans, they NEED to be trans, or else...  ...or else they'll have to stop doing all their gender non-conforming behavior.   Hold the fuck up. Just... just stop. Here, I'll post more of this brilliance,    It's as if they fear that if some physical measurable INBORN attribute of their body doesn't ""prove"" that they were ""born with it"" then they won't have JUSTIFICATION for their gender non-conforming behavior, they'll have to stop ""crossdressing,"" can't wear X Y and Z, can't get the haircut, must ""man up!"" or ""put on the dress like a proper young lady"".   k that's enough, I'm gonna vomit.  These peeps are completely missing the point. People who ask about whether they are ""actually"" trans aren't trying to decide if it's ok for them to be non-conforming. They're deciding whether or not to transition, which this genius does concede   When it comes to extreme body modification, there are actual risks to it, and you can't undo it, and so you end up with gatekeepers and I can understand the role of some sort of gatekeeping there. I mean, hell, there's a certain level of ""gatekeeping"" around getting facial tattoos for similar reasons.   OK, likening hormone therapy and the surgeries some of us go through to a face tattoo is a bit much, but at least she gets the idea (still, fuck gatekeepers).  So where do they get the idea that being a trans woman is just men justifying our gender-nonconformance with biological evidence that we're mentally women? Fuck, here I am, a trans lady, chillin' right here, just being myself. I didn't transition so I could be more ""feminine"", I transitioned so I could feel less dysphoria. I'm not some stereotype of a woman. I am a woman, and I'm free to express that however I want, regardless of gender 'norms'.  And even if we WERE choosing this (and I'm sure some people do, such as the various trans people who don't feel dysphoria, and there's nothing wrong with that), why shouldn't we be able to choose to be women? If you can choose your sexuality, why not choose your gender (or sex as the TERFs will have it)?  These people make perfect sense. I dig the double standard."
GenderCynical,30fg39,Notfaye,8,Thu Mar 26 23:01:31 2015 UTC,"They get the idea from the basis of their philosophy, which is the complete erasure of being trans. you can't have science, you can't have transmen experiences, you can't have transwomen experiences, all that is erased through complete cognitive dissonance, leaving only their conjecture. (pro trans conjecture obviously also part of the erasure)  There was a nice article on digg about evolution deniers, it's similar. When the teacher told his students that the pope had given his blessing on evolution, one student said the teacher was lying, that the information isn't on the Vatican web page, and that he'd only believe it if the pope himself came in and said it in front of the class (obviously you can watched the tapped announcement if you wanted to)"
GenderCynical,30fg39,Ebomb1,6,Thu Mar 26 23:54:08 2015 UTC,"There's actually is a lot of focus, on reddit at least, on wanting proof, and a bunch of commenters who chime in on every ""why"" thread with hypotheses which are not actually proven. Science is nice and all, but it doesn't convince people who aren't open to being convinced. The point is the same as with the gay gene: whether there's a traceable cause doesn't matter, because there's nothing wrong with the choices we make concerning our bodies and our lives."

They consider themselves feminists, yet do not fit into any feminist groups nowadays because most modern feminists are very pro-transgender rights and against the binary in general. They technically are a left-wing group, but with how modern left-wingers are overwhelmingly pro-LGBT rights, they don't fit in as their main goal is highly transphobic. They do fit in with the typical right-wing rhetoric on anti-trans, but considering how the right is also against lesbians, feminism, and reproductive rights for women there's no way in hell they'd vote for them. In other words, they have no allies because they're pretty much a pro-SJ group, but also for bigotry against trans people, which is why nobody wants to be with them."

They claim they want to abolish 'gender' and allow anyone to express themselves however they want. They just believe that the terms 'man' and 'woman' should only be used from a biological perspective, and they don't recognize transgender people as having a biological origin (because they don't separate gender identity with gender roles). Many of them don't have an issue with us changing our bodies, they just see that as a cosmetic issue and don't think it is a necessary medical treatment. Their main issue is that they think that the female sex has issues unique to it and we are making it difficult to talk about those issues. They forget that the female sex is a lot more complicated than just ""does this person have a vagina"" or ""does this person have XX chromosomes"" and they generalize WAY too much, ignoring women with AIS, who are infertile, women born with penises, etc... There's a lot more to being a woman than just growing up, having a period, and popping out babies.  Of course what they don't realize is that keeping the terms exclusive to your assigned sex at birth is incredibly oppressive and reinforces the binary anyway."

(Edit: linked to np version.)   I only discovered that subreddit a few days ago, and after the initial repulsion had worn off, my next thought was wondering whether TERFs would consider such people allies.  They've joined forces with deeply conservative anti-GSM groups before, in order to harass that poor trans girl who just wanted to use the toilet, for instance.  So I was genuinely curious whether they'd take it that far.  I guess not.  So... yay?  (On a side note, when they quoted the sidebar, it took me a second to realise they weren't quoting their own sidebar, that's how similar those subreddits appear to me...)  Anyway, they'd apparently already heard of the sub (presumably they deleted previous posts about it, hence I couldn't find any and thought it would be new to them) and presumed I was pro transphobia, so promptly banned me.  At least they banned me for a good, albeit incorrect, reason, I guess."

I mean:   The questions were answered reasonably, patiently and politely.   Isn't even close to accurate. I mean besides trying to start arguments in places where OP wasn't discussing and using no end of strawmen arguments. Most of the time they seemed more interested in attacking her friend than actually having discussion with her. Then there is the blatant, unapologetic manhating:   Transmen do not oppress men because men are not oppressed by women.    Then on top of that they threaten to ban her and accuse her of straw manning and accusations when I have heard them say those exact things.  Gen Crits, they drive me to drink :/  Also:   I see the likelihood of the artificial womb as more improbable than using stem cells to become sperm   I... I can't even. I'm sorry is she basing her argument on the idea that we will never be able to produce artificial wombs? Hell even if you take trans women out of the question, there is the demand for artificial wombs for women who can not have children for various reasons. This will become a thing, its not a question of if, its a question of when."

Worst part is, it's human nature to shut up about it if they're close to you, which can make them feel validated.  Hopefully some day they'll be mature enough to understand, if you're ideas are universally hated to an extent where you feel the need to hide them in public, it's either hate extremism, or the support for human freedom."

The relevant issue here and why he was arrested, which I 100% agree with, is that he's a convicted sex offender who was in an area where children congregate. He also attempted to illegally enter several cars.  Conclusion: He's a scumbag and belongs in jail, but his outfit appears pretty much completely irrelevant. Violating the terms of a conviction and breaking into cars are illegal regardless of how one is dressed.   https://gendertrender.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/bbut-trans-activists-say-this-never-happens/   From 2011: A woman fled a bathroom and reported that a man, possibly a trans woman, was there. The alleged scary bathroom invader is not reported as having done anything at all. Security checked the bathroom and reported there was no problem.  Conclusion: Well, nothing happened, so . . .   http://m.utsandiego.com/news/2015/jan/22/man-barbie-costume-guilty-assault-store-restroom/   From 2015 (!): A man, high on methamphetamine, stole two cheerleading costumes. He then went to the men's bathroom where he put them both on underneath his presumably regular clothes, entered a women's bathroom, and shoved a woman against the wall. She believed that he planned to rape her, but was able to run away.  Conclusion: The guy, outwardly, was dressed completely normally. The cheerleading outfits were hidden under his regular clothes, so this isn't even debatably a case of a criminal using his attire as an excuse to enter a female-only area. And while he might be a possible rapist, he might have been trying to rob her or do something completely different. He was totally fucked up on drugs. Who knows what his reasoning was?   http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/man-dressed-in-skirt-arrested-in-women%E2%80%99s-bathroom/   From 2010: A presumably cisgender man with a long history of indecent exposure arrests was arrested for walking into a women's bathroom and exposing himself to children. He forced adult women out specifically to expose himself to kids. The only really relevant part of this is that he happened to be crossdressing.  Conclusion: He compulsively exposes himself, and he has presumably done so in numerous other locations. One instance of this involved a women's bathroom. Yes, he should be in prison. Did his manner of dress have anything to do with what happened? It doesn't sound like it. He still probably would've ended up exposing himself to kids, and he could've still done it in that bathroom.    So only one of these cases might have involved a trans woman. In it, literally nothing happened. Only two of the other three cases involved a man entering a women's bathroom or locker room while appearing in typically female clothing, and there's no suggestion in the articles that they were allowed in because of their outfits or stated gender identity. Furthermore, both of those cases involved longtime, repeated, sex offenders whose behavior almost certainly wouldn't have changed if there was a cis women only law.  And this is the best they've got?"
GenderCynical,2zpos4,Anticonvulsant,8,Fri Mar 20 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"They posted more. Let's go with this.   http://archive.dailycal.org/article.php?id=110753   2010: A man entered a women's locker room and began taking pictures. He was not crossdressed. He used a towel to conceal the bottom half of his face, wore a large pair of sunglasses, and may have had a wig on. He was allowed in due to having a card for the area. The card may have been stolen.  Conclusion: This has literally zero relevance. The person involved wasn't trans, wasn't crossdressing, and got in by having possibly stolen credentials.   http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/62757/nelson-crossdresser-sentenced-indecent-assault    2009: A crossdressing man assaulted a woman in public.  Conclusion: The assault happened outside, in public. The man wasn't in any kind of women's only facility. It's a sad case, but completely irrelevant to the issue.   http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1385889/Joel-Hardman-wore-female-rubber-mask-wig-spy-women-public-toilets.html#ixzz1Mvhf2oLs   2011: A non-crossdressed man wore an extremely creepy looking, supposedly female, mask and a wig. He then sneaked into a women's public bathroom, photographed women's feet, and made audio recordings of them urinating.  Conclusion: The mask and wig do not look feminine or realistic and wouldn't fool anyone. He was surely wearing them to avoid being recognized, not to get into the bathroom. In fact, he was caught when someone reported that a man who ""looked like a mannequin"" had entered the women's bathroom. Again, a gross guy, but not at all relevant.   http://www.skyvalleychronicle.com/BREAKING-NEWS/MAN-WEARING-BRA-AND-WIG-ARRESTED-IN-WOMEN-S-RESTROOM-AT-LOCAL-COLLEGE-941018   2012: A partially crossdressed man, wearing a bra and wig, entered a women's bathroom. He was spotted immediately and ended up being arrested for a previous voyeurism incident.  Conclusion: There aren't enough details to make any real judgment on whether or not he was actually trying to pass himself off as a woman to get into the bathroom and peep. The TERFs have been doing so bad that I'll be generous and give them half credit on this one.   http://www.katu.com/news/local/132679743.html?mobile=y   2011: This is literally a repeat of the first case in my last post. So let's just ignore this one.   http://m.wsbtv.com/news/news/police-cross-dressing-peeping-tom-arrested-again/nJbf7/   2010: A man peeped into people's windows while he was crossdressed and wearing panties on his head.  Conclusion: This, again, has literally nothing to do with women's only facilities. Is it too much to ask that these links be at least slightly relevant?   http://m.news9.com/story.aspx?story=23443942&catId=112032   2013: A homeless man wearing only a pair of red panties was, somehow (not explained in the article), hiding inside a presumably one-person gas station bathroom. A small girl came in, and the man locked the two of them inside. He put an orange shirt on her for some reason, and then began choking her. Another man was able to get a key, open the door, and save the girl. The attacker ran away on foot, but he was captured soon afterward.  Conclusion: What does this have to do with anything? The attacker was creepy and wearing women's underwear, but it's otherwise totally unrelated to the issue. He wasn't really crossdressed in any meaningful sense, didn't dress up to sneak into the bathroom, wasn't trans or in a women's only area, and he likely would've attacked anyone who came in there.    Let's be blunt, gender_critical.  I was told there were HUNDREDS of instances of one of the following things happening:   A trans woman enters a women's only area and assaults/harasses a cis woman. A crossdressing male passes himself off as a woman, trans or cis, to enter a women's only area and assault/harass a cis woman.   Out of eleven links and ten individual stories posted on gender_critical, I was presented with one iffy case which MIGHT count if there was more information. The others either had absolutely nothing to do with women only facilities, didn't even involve someone trans or crossdressed, involved someone crossdressed who never tried to pass but just barged in and did something, or were cases in which literally nothing happened. A poster on gendercynical was able to post one indisputable case of which qualified. You, the virulently anti-trans group, brought me none. How fucking sad is that?"
GenderCynical,2zpos4,John_314159,5,Sat Mar 21 03:45:46 2015 UTC,I've seen the TERFs wave this case around as if a case from 1997 somehow vindicates their bigotry.  An 18 year old event is not an epidemic of trans violence against afab women.  You'd think they'd be able to find a more recent example if it was as prevalent as they allege (and by allege I mean imagine.)

Literally the only common factor they have at all with those women is being born cis.  But the moment a trans woman goes into a locker room in the US, suddenly they MUST BE STOPPED because African women undergo forced FGM.  They demand intersectional feminists to be ""intersectional"" with them in their exclusivity.    Their entire schtick is based on the concept that no one in the world is as oppressed as white middle and upper class women in western democracies."

GenderCynical,2zlfa9,frubbliness,9,Thu Mar 19 18:43:39 2015 UTC,"Down lower in the thread:   If I thought they were a man, I would react defensively. Passing trans men should probably use a unisex room. I have never averred that biological sex should be the one and only consideration, as a large part of the reason for sex-delineated bathrooms is to reduce male violence against women in those spaces, and that is primarily a social consideration. There was that study indicating that after being on hormones, criminality increased to near-male levels. I wouldn't have the same trepidation about a known trans man that I would have of a male-bodied person, but they would likely be significantly stronger than me as men are stronger than women as a whole due in large part to testosterone.   What a terrible answer. Even though they argue trans men are women, they still want to disallow them from women's rooms because they have the testosterone levels of cis men. You know who doesn't have the T levels of cis men? Trans women. But you never see them pulling out any hormone level argument there; you see the ""born male"" or ""male socialized"" arguments.   TERFs use whatever standards serve their purpose at the time. It's completely self-serving. They want the world to themselves and damn anyone else who wants rights or safety that might get in the way of that."

It's very true, that if your worried about your safety and comfort, transmen in thhe women's room is far worse then transwomen. They aren't pretending, they're much stronger, and they commit male rates of violent crime after long term usage of T.  Edit: and imagine having to legislate for that, ok chromosome bathroom checks, but if you're trans on hrt you need to use unisex bathrooms, ok now every  business and government building has to have unisex bathrooms.... I mean it's doable by removing all gendered  bathrooms, but it's sure a huge mess for the fraction of the .3%  of the population who are both trans and on HRT."

Dabbs Jr., J.M., Ruback, R.B., Frady, R.L., Hopper, C.H., and Scoutas, D.S. (1988) Saliva testosterone and criminal violence among women  then you can follow up with this, spoiler: there's a positive statistical correlation to female bodied testosterone levels and criminality (there's also a link in males, most of our differences of aggression are all linked to either testosterone or   https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCYQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FDavid_Terburg%2Fpublication%2F24431813_The_testosterone-cortisol_ratio_A_hormonal_marker_for_proneness_to_social_aggression%2Flinks%2F53e937670cf2fb1b9b66a1b5.pdf&ei=ZqQLVcqkMILcoATe0YLgBw&usg=AFQjCNEKMWc-bGmvVCMHFuTlWo-gVruC8g&sig2=LxrujaFTVo9esMVW1PxcrQ  the testosterone cortisol ratio (this is important for understanding why extremely low testosterone also produces high rates of antisocial crime)  more of Dabbs's work:  Dabbs, J. M., Jr., Carr, T. S., Frady, R. L., & Riad, J. K. (1995). Testosterone, crime, and misbehavior among 692 male prison inmates. Personality and Individual Differences, 9, 269−275.  Dabbs, J. M., Jr., & Hargrove, M. F. (1997). Age, testosterone, and behavior among female prison inmates. Psychosomatic Medicine, 59, 477−480.  Dabbs, J. M., Jr., & Morris, R. (1990). Testosterone, social class, and antisocial behavior in a sample of 4,462 men. Psychological Science, 1, 209−211  (spoiler, testosterone levels is always positively linked)  Hermans, E. J., Putman, P., Baas, J. M., Koppeschaar, H. P., & Van Honk, J. (2006). A single administration of testosterone reduces fear-potentiated startle in humans. Biological Psychiatry, 59, 872−874.  Hermans, E. J., Ramsey, N. F., & Van Honk, J. (2008). Exogenous testosterone enhances responsiveness to social threat in the neural circuitry of social aggression in humans. Biological Psychiatry, 63, 263−270.  so what is basically the general consensus on what is going on is it lowers your threshold to experience threat and anger, and increases the stimulus threshold for you to experience fear by basically blocking subconscious memory (like hey if I do this I'm going to get hurt) This leads to aggressive and dominate behavior, which positively correlates to crime rates    but then I saw the sample sizes of most work done going into trans prison statistics, and the number of states that would report no trans prisoners to survey. And then I realized, were talking at most .05% to .15% of the population (.3% gates, .1% California self identified trans rates, gates admitted he was doing ""statistical gymnastics"" I prefer .1%) / 2 (no one has done a break down of trans identity rates between the sexes, only SRS rates, and no one believes those are representative )  when you adjust for being on hrt before the crime, not being able to adjust for transmen who would prefer a safer female prison and would hide their status (not uncommon, men try to lie to get into ""gay wings"" all the time), you're looking at a statistical nightmare even before you get into all the other variables of incarceration.  While there seems to be a general trend in more incarcerations in Ftms compared to Cis females (based on self reporting, and correlations I was doing between reported self prison rape and abuse rates to predicted population size) I don't think this will ever be provable through direct study that HRT can be directly linked to incarceration in transmen (as opposed to other discriminatory and social factors.)  edit: this would be a great thesis if you did the actual survey work."

That's absolutely insane, especially hailing one of them as shining symbol of feminism. This goes especially since the rates of rape among men of color are far higher than the rates of white men.

But some people take the name of the sub too seriously. And sometimes TERFs find their way to the sub thinking they are welcome.  So one time one of our users was in an argument with a TERF.

I mean.... that isn't really feminism any more is it?"

GenderCynical,2zdu22,doodlebug_firefy,12,Tue Mar 17 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"They've isolated themselves in their echo chamber since the late sixties.  They're what happen to any ideology that remains insulated from change for decades - they go insane.    They remind me of the monster energy drink woman.  She sees the devil in everyday logos.  They believe  that no real leftist would be in favor of allowing a child to develop and make her own choices.    It has to be something sick and horrible in the parents' motivation.  It HAS to be, because otherwise it eould just be people living their lives.  And they'll never let that be what it is.  They're supposed to be about people being free to make any choice they want with respect to behavior typically perceived as ""gendered.""  Why, then, do they get so flipping pissy when someone chooses to gender themselves of their own free will?  If someone wants to be a housewife, or an accountant, or a fire fighter, or a teacher that's up to them.  And if they want to put on makeup or not put on makeup, or wear plain clothes or colorful clothes, if they act feminine or masculine or any variation in between, that's their choice.  And if they know themselves to be attuned to one gender rather than the other, whether or not it matches their plumbing, that's also their choice.  The Gender Critical movement gets pissed of at this for a number of reasons, the biggest if which is because they don't want people to acknowledge gender, because ""it don't real."". Which is silly, because we all know gender is real.  We know who a woman is and who a man is, and it very rarely has anything to do with what is or isn't in their underclothing.  I don't know whether all the men I work with or encounter in public have penises.  I also don't care.  I don't know whether all the women I work with or encounter in public have vaginas.  Not interested in finding out.  In civil society, people leave private things private.  Rude and nasty people get in other people's business and make it their own.  Many of these gender critical radical feminists don't know how to act in civil society.  They participate in ""call out culture,"" which reduces people to their class and then hammers them for it.  It's not how normal people act in public.  They get upset when they see other people treating trans* people with due respect because it calls attention to their own sneering disdain, and not in a positive way.  They feel marginalized because they've marginalized themselves, and they blame the existence of trans people for the results of their own behavior."

It's not just erasure, though. It's barbaric. It's the one actual situation where transitioning is coercive, abusive, and absolutely worth condemnation. Though, I guess it works out if you're actually trans in Iran. They won't kill you. BTW, they only pay for half of the surgery."
GenderCynical,2zdu22,Notfaye,2,Thu Mar 19 10:53:10 2015 UTC,"That lady may have been a spark, but there is a greater reason for trans acceptance in the Islamic world, and not only in Iran.  The Quran specifically condemns gender non binary and gay people. It specifically mentions that transwomen are ok. Specifically unichs that are gender non binary. Considering the time piece of the source though, the closest you're going to get to trans is, has had genitals removed and lives as a woman. Muhammad himself had these type of trans women living with and caring for his wives.  There is however a sharp Sunni and Shia divide on this issue, and only Shia accept this.  The list of Islamic countries that criminalize same sex intercourse, but publicly have given acceptance for trans surgeries are thus going to be Shia countries, you can find cases of the government accepting basic trans rights in Syria Bahrain as well as Iran."

GenderCynical,2zcyxo,Notfaye,6,Tue Mar 17 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"in order to bash and hate trans women, they logically have to become:  classist, racist, heterosexist, and conforming to patriarchal sex essentialism. All while erasing the rights privileges and safety of all women who block the advancement of their patriarchal vision.  which is sad because core gender critical philosophy only needs to revolve around erasure of transwomens identities, which would only be  anti LGBT, and cissexist, but still feminist.

GenderCynical,2z7ur3,Freya-Freed,13,Mon Mar 16 10:00:25 2015 UTC,"Wait. What?   Trans lobbyists won't even include all people in their workplace discrimination laws. It doesn't protect gender non-conformity, it protects transgenders, as a class. Women who don't perform femininity might not be protected unless they identify as men.   I don't even. Lets go look at what the scary trans-lobby is pushing through the government right now!   This enactment amends the Canadian Human Rights Act to include gender identity as a prohibited ground of discrimination.  It also amends the Criminal Code to include gender identity as a distinguishing characteristic protected under section 318 and as an aggravating circumstance to be taken into consideration under section 718.2 at the time of sentencing.   Oh. Its just gender identity. The blanket term that is an explicit protection for trans and non-binary people in Canada, in addition to the protection from discrimination based on sex that all Canadian citizens have. Gender identity meaning, in th ewording of the bill, an individual’s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex that the individual was assigned at birth. Holy shit. That also includes non-binary people, since thats my fucking gender identity.  I'm a trans non-binary person - and guess what. It protects both aspects of my gender identity. Not just ""transgenders"" you dipshits."
GenderCynical,2z7ur3,Trans-Canada,9,Mon Mar 16 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this doesn't protect gender expression. Statutes that do state so. Statutes that only protect identity still allow discrimination against gender non-conforming people. It's a legitimate beef but a lie to blame trans people because--get this--trans people who're visibly trans or who pass as cis but are non-conforming are also burned by identity-only protections.   This is one reason why it's a mistake to divorce the T from the LGB."
GenderCynical,2z7ur3,Ebomb1,-8,Mon Mar 16 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"I'd have to be trans or non-binary. As a ""cis-woman"" who doesn't want to wear makeup, am I protected from discrimination under this proposal? Unlikely.

So why don't you push for that protection yourselves? Why expect our help when according to you we shouldn't expect the same?  Of course your whole fucking post is based on the fallacious notion that we don't care about protecting women or gender non-conforming people.

It's not just cis women. Disabled people, racial minorities, people with mental health issues, etc also experience these problems. Oh and good luck if you're any combination of these things.   But fuck those minorities right? We need to make laws one by one instead of making laws to encompass more than one minority.

GenderCynical,2z7ur3,John_314159,6,Mon Mar 16 21:15:32 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about just gender non-conforming people. I'm talking about all minorities or vulnerable employees. Policies like right to work laws and at-will employment override discrimination laws because there's no guaranteed employment. You can be fired for any reason at any time. The US labor movement is broken and the problem is a variety of things but ya'll piss me off because you act like this is just a problem with gender non-conforming people. Then you blame trans people as a whole because it's convenient for you. Disregarding anything but legislation for gender non-conforming people (but let's be honest you really mean gender non-conforming cis women) as men's rights propaganda is just ludicrous. You don't care about worker's rights. You care about your own interests.  Just to give an example of how this all works although I can only vouch for the manufacturing industry... It's legal for these business to have required overtime so when it's busy you work 60-70 hour weeks. If you have any health problems this is a major issue and most companies will find some way to get rid of you if you ask for exceptions. They keep as few full time employees as possible and hire illegal immigrants for the rest. They can force the illegals to work seven days a week and the full timers will get Sunday off. I once worked with a Mexican guy who hadn't gotten a day off in three fucking months and he had a green card. The solution to this would be to start a union but because of at-will employment they can fire the dissenters and hire more temps because there's always temps available.

However, as it reads now, trans only protect themselves from discrimination as a special status."
GenderCynical,2z7ur3,prudemare,8,Mon Mar 16 17:23:00 2015 UTC,"Right.  Because trans people have so much power and say-so that they can ""protect"" the rights of half of the population of the planet (who haven't been able to protect those rights on their own for a few thousand years.)

GenderCynical,2z7ur3,gamerzap,-7,Mon Mar 16 17:53:57 2015 UTC,"Seriously? Trans inc are writing these laws, who else is responsible? Not that hard to change the wording to protect ALL gender non-conforming people.  You're being purposefully obtuse so I won't be contributing in this false dialogue anymore. Thanks for not calling me a TERF or bitch though, have a good one!  Edit: whoops! You did call me a TERF, just not in a reply to me. FYI TERF is an anti-feminist slur levied against women exclusively. Please stop using it.    It misrepresents radical feminism to be primarily about trans people. Trans exclusion isn't the basis of the community. Being focused on women and seeing the world from a radical feminist analysis is the basis of the community. RF is the belief of a social world order known as the patriarchy by which men are valued more than women and how that permeates our entire civilization. It is a misnomer. All radical feminists believe women have the right to create their own boundaries, whether it excludes trans or not. We don't police women or force them to share intimate space with in-tact males. It is used to stigmatize women. It is a slur because it is a word we don't call ourselves and is used to label and attack us. It is also exclusive to women and feminists, isn't that convenient? TERF should come with the marker *no men were hurt in the creation or use of this slur"
GenderCynical,2z7ur3,prudemare,11,Mon Mar 16 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"TERF is not a slur.  There's more to something being a slur than you not liking it.  Plenty of Christians don't like the word ""religious"" but that's not a slur.  It is a literal description of an idealogy: a transgender exclusive form of radical feminism.  I don't think all radical feminists are TERFs but some of them are, because they are radical feminists who seek to exclude transgender women.  Also, TERF is not exclusive to women and I have used it decsribe men that fit the label before."
GenderCynical,2z7ur3,John_314159,-6,Mon Mar 16 19:09:04 2015 UTC,"Are you a radical feminist? Because I am, and I am telling you: TERF IS A SLUR.   TERF is an ignorant description of a philosophy you know nothing about, because if you did, you would know that it's a misnomer at best, you would also know that men who believe in RF philosophy don't refer to themselves as radical feminists. There is no such thing as a male radfem so it's a sexist slur to boot.  You use it to stigmatize people who don't agree with your gender politics whether they are RF or not. It is a slur. Stop.

And yes, I have seen several men describe themselves as radical feminists so I have no idea what your talking about.  I don't stigmatize people who don't agree with my gender politics, (and anyone who disagrees with them is by definition trans exclusive) I dismiss them from the discussion.  It's an entirely different thing to dismiss someone from a discussion for someing related to a discussion.  People do it constantly with descriptors, that doesn't make them slurs."

Myself, and nearly all other radical feminist I knew were very much trans-inclusive in our ideology, and saw some theorists like Greer as distant from the core of our theories. So it was nice to be able to differentiate.   And it's about as stigmatizing as ""hard-line right winger"" or ""socialist"" or ""liberal""...if TERF beliefs were more socially acceptable, it would hardly be a slur.

Because we totally have complete control of our representatives and our government definitely isn't an oppressive oligarchy that's largely controlled by the 1% (this is mostly rich cis men btw).

The only reason TERFs don't use TERF is because it would point out that they are, in fact, trans-exclusionary. Obviously it's used to describe certain feminists since it has ""feminist"" within the acronym, but it's more narrow in its definition since the rest of the acronym is made up of adjectives describing the feminist in question. And it's not exclusive to women or even cisgender women. Trans women and men can be TERFs and I've run into a few, but it's mostly used against cisgender women because they're the most visible and active TERFs. There are men on GenderCritical, therefore there are TERFs who are men.  Should we take apart the acronym and just call all of you Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists so you can't argue with it?"
GenderCynical,2z7ur3,mollymollykelkel,6,Mon Mar 16 19:16:23 2015 UTC,You're a TERF. You need to be labeled and (ideologically) attacked.

GenderCynical,2z7ur3,Jessica_Ariadne,8,Mon Mar 16 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"Trans lobbyists won't even include all people in their workplace discrimination laws.   The only groups left who need workplace discrimination laws are the gay community and the transgender community. The Civil Rights Act covers pretty much everyone else.   Women who don't perform femininity might not be protected unless they identify as men.   Except, you know, Title VII and the Civil Rights Act.  It's not like we're pushing to get sexual orientation pushed off ENDA like the greater gay community already did to gender identity. We even support ENDA after we were booted from it.  Rights aren't a zero sum game, stop acting like conservatives. Us getting rights doesn't mean you suddenly stop having yours."
GenderCynical,2z5rsw,gamerzap,12,Sun Mar 15 20:55:25 2015 UTC,"I've notice a common theme is the idea of a universal narrative. ""All women have the same shared experience."" ""All lesbians have the same criteria for attraction."" ""All transgender people have the same motivation for transition.""  Really highlights a lack of intersectionality in TERF arguments as a whole. Experiences for young cisgender women are different from experiences of older cisgender women, as is the case with two women of different races. But TERFs don't seem to like talking about this since it steps on the idea of a shared experience of womanhood.  On the subject of ""beliefs vs. feelings,"" it's clear that they really don't understand why transgender people transition. AC doesn't even bother explaining the difference between either of them and keeps using them pretty much interchangeably. It's not a feeling of ""I like things that are associated with women, therefore I feel like a woman,"" it's a feeling of ""My body isn't producing the correct hormones that my brain is telling me it should. My body has parts that my subconscious doesn't recognize and is missing parts the subconscious is telling me is there."" Dysphoria is horrifying and yet reparative therapy is even more horrifying because it's been shown not to work. Transitioning has shown to be the best treatment and it does require work, the ones who refuse to put forth any effort is TERFs.  Closing out with gender socialization. It's kind of weird how TERFs acknowledge that social pressure of women does have an effect on trans women, but instead of treating us like other victims of that, they blame us for perpetuating it. A better position would be to keep saying ""Liking feminine things doesn't make you a woman, and liking masculine things doesn't make you a man. You don't have to follow what society says your gender should."" Instead we get ""Men and women are socialized in certain and separate ways. What affects men (or trans women) cannot directly affect women (or trans men), and what affects women (or trans men) cannot affect men (or trans women)."" This ignores that interpretation of the body begins early. Growing up, I felt inadequate about my body and I still do, but in a way that is socialized in women. Yes, this part is societal and I'll admit that, but that's not the reason I'm transgender, it's more of an effect of being transgender. We're still affected by portrayals of women in the media just like many cisgender women are, but correlation does not imply causation. While society can make dysphoria worse, it isn't the cause of dysphoria. Eliminating gender roles does not mean there will suddenly mean there won't be any more transgender people."
GenderCynical,2z5rsw,Boltizar,12,Mon Mar 16 02:57:24 2015 UTC,They're firmly beholden to the idea of socialization as separate courses given in separate lecture rooms. It's more accurately represented as one course in one huge room. Some of the information is clearly geared towards certain categories of students if you go by assigned gender. But every student is exposed to the entire syllabus and what any one student actually internalizes about themselves depends on far more than that student's assigned category.
GenderCynical,2z5rsw,Ebomb1,10,Mon Mar 16 11:15:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. My pushback to TERFs is to ask them to define the ""universal female experience"". I want to see them tell me that Black, Asian, Muslim, Latina, Poor, Rich, disabled, baked, Masculine, and Feminine women literally have the exact same experience and cannot be differentiated against.   They're second wavers, and their universalist, absolutist thinking is reminiscent of the racism, classism, and ableism that still permeates through radical feminism to this very day.   Honestly, if you disregard the Trans stuff (which you shouldn't, but I'm speaking hypothetically), TERFs are bigots in a plethora of different ways. But asking them to check themselves is like asking a fish to do your taxes. It ain't happening."
GenderCynical,2z5rsw,RTHREEB,12,Mon Mar 16 07:52:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly a lot of people on that sub aren't even TERFs or feminists at all. They are just there to hate on trans people.

Assuming you're telling the truth, which, considering I've seen you blatantly lie several times in the past day, I doubt.  If you are telling the truth, you also gathered data very poorly.

GenderCynical,2ymky4,John_314159,6,Wed Mar 11 01:08:14 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  How is it being overlooked that with age comes a tendency to be ""set in ones ways"" and resit change?  Why should feminists be immune to that?  Second wave feminists are aging because the second wave was decades ago.  Many summarily ignored new ideas in feminist thought and have become rigid in their stance that their way is the only correct way, their analysis is the only correct analysis, and their conclusions are the only correct conclusions.  It is foolish to go about acting like age doesn't have anything to do with that.  It also doesn't mean that it's the sole reason for their rigidity.  But let us not pretend it's not a factor.  That being said, there's no reason people can't say these things without getting slur-y about it.

I can accept that people older than I may be more worldly wise, but wise =/= intelligent though there is a factor of intelligence involved we already know that a younger person can be more intelligent if maybe lacking some life skills or common sense (which come with wisdom)  I also take your point of getting stuck in a pattern of behaviour as you get older and raise you that habits become harder to change as you get older so combine someone who is adamant that they are correct with a habit of being arrogant about it... yeah you can imagine how frustrating that would get.  We should have respect for those that are older but respecting someone and calling them out for problematic behaviours or opinions are not mutually exclusive, though there are reason certain people would want us to believe the opposite. They are too comfortable and happy with the behaviours and opinions of decades past and would prefer that there be sacrifices to intellectual and political forward momentum so that they can revel in what they truly want to say"

I've never spoken for intersex people. Claiming intersex people can't be heterosexual IS speaking for them however."
GenderCynical,2ybzyz,transsnarfleblort,7,Mon Mar 9 10:58:42 2015 UTC,Does this apply to all intersex conditions or just the ones that are associated with ambiguous genitalia? Can someone with Klinefelter's syndrome identify as heterosexual?
GenderCynical,2ybzyz,mollymollykelkel,8,Mon Mar 9 20:47:39 2015 UTC,I have no idea? It's not my opinion?   My point is that intersex people should be allowed to label themselves in any case. But it seems like TERFs think that intersex people are by default not heterosexual (because that would require a penis and a vagina in their point of view).
GenderCynical,2ybzyz,mollymollykelkel,-6,Mon Mar 9 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"not heterosexual (because that would require a penis and a vagina)   And ain't that the problem.  Heterosexual PIV sex is ranked supreme by society, anything else is viewed as second class.  I'll take my ban now."

It definitely had a political viewpoint. I was one of the first (and only) detransitioners to use the sub.  I thought it was kinda important and I was really questioning my transition at that time. PrarieFire made me a mod and I thought I could make a difference. Unfortunately some of the policies made that impossible. I managed to get the compromise that we would used preferred pronouns because god damn I don't know why that is always such a tough issue all the time. However, I couldn't get PrarieFire to agree to not delete comments and ban everybody who said TERF or just had a different opinion.  It would be one thing if the site was only for detransitioners but a lot of it was kind of opinion piece things that I felt everyone should be able to participate in. I was also interested in having a dialogue about a lot of nuanced issues that kind of get swept under the rug. Nothing like that could happen with the way the rules were (and to a certain extent, the people).  I don't know why the thing was made private, I resigned from being a mod after my disagreement with PrarieFire and quit checking there because it was obvious nobody new was coming and we had already stopped doing weekly check-ins.  I still think it would be a valuable thing to have but I'm pretty sure it was kind of a set up. I was getting really paranoid about it and had mixed feelings about the whole thing."

In between giving the distinct impression that her RFism and Dworkin's RFism is alike, she pokes fun of trans bodies, decries the fact that trans people can get medical care and laments that trans folk can legally transition in the UK. Not once did Jeffreys dare note that Dworkin found gender identity research to be subversive to patriarchy, that in Woman Hating Dworkin advocates for FREE trans medical care for trans folk, that Dworkin had trans friends, that Dworkin made her ordinances trans-inclusive, that Dworkin said trans people must be free to live as we see fit, that Dworkin appeared on TV with a trans woman or that Dworkin - numerous times - said that the sex binary is BS.

Of course, I grew up in an area with good Canadian radfems, whose views are pretty accurately described in that left column. I didn't exactly grow up on the TERF sort of radical feminism.   Made for a rude and uncomfortable awakening when I went to college and came across my first TERF, them being all ""My way is radical feminism, you're not a real radical feminist"". Which, like, fuck them, I hadn't even read any Greer or Jeffreys at that point, but I'd read more than enough radical feminism to know they were twisting feminist theory around to shitty, narrow-minded ends. I grew up on intersectional radical feminism and just saw so much vicious exclusion and willful avoidance of in-depth analysis on issues like colonialism and white supremacy. Like, up here, Sherene Razack sort of straddled the line at times (probably the closest to a TERF that I can think of off the top of my head in terms of relevant Canadian feminists), but at least she didn't have the tendency to cite herself (Jeffreys) or avoid critical analysis (Greer, Raymond), and recognized the limitations of her theories and didn't try to play those off as trivial on the regular."

GenderCynical,2xupf4,frubbliness,7,Wed Mar 4 22:00:38 2015 UTC,50 Shades isn't kink. It's abuse. Not everyone in the kink scene is good or really understands what kink should be about just like anything else but that doesn't give you the right to be shitty. Maybe the queer kink scene is just better than the heterosexual one. Either way your experience isn't the defacto kink experience.  You just got dealt a shitty hand.
GenderCynical,2xupf4,doodlebug_firefy,8,Wed Mar 4 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have had good experiences also. Like I said your experience isn't the defacto experience. It sucks that some people take advantage of kink in order to abuse people but the same can be said of any huge group of people. For example, I've received a lot of abuse in 'women only safe spaces.' Does that mean that the majority of these spaces are inherently enabling abuse? I would say no although I think the advertising as safe spaces is dishonest/misleading.   The point is that you have to separate emotions from judgement. Your experience doesn't make the entire or even the majority of the BDSM scene bad/misogynistic. Everyone's also conveniently leaving out how popular dominatrixes are."
GenderCynical,2xupf4,frubbliness,9,Wed Mar 4 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"I always find it entertaining that they can just slap a label of misogyny on any group while denying that abuse happens in women's only spaces/constantly promoting these spaces as ultimately safe. I even met one of my most abusive ex partners through a tutoring program for disabled students that emphasized the importance of having role models of the same gender (males were always paired with males and females were always paired with females).  It's sad though because these experiences are so minimized in our culture that rape/abuse is considered a male thing when in reality it's a power balance thing. Want to sexually take advantage of young women if you're a woman? Easy. Join a female only AA/NA group or support group. Even if you're about to get caught, just claim your victim is a drama queen who hates other women. It works more than one might think.  That's not to say that rape/abuse committed by males is less important. It's definitely more prevalent and endorsed by our culture. The only reason that abuse/rape committed by females is minimized is because females are viewed as weak. People take advantage of that for their own purposes though. No gender or one group of people is truly good."

GenderCynical,2xt08a,two-,3,Wed Mar 4 15:59:48 2015 UTC,"It's strange... it's almost as if these 'radical feminists' have never heard of Monique Wittig:   [N]ot only is there no natural group “women” (we lesbians are living proof of it), but as individuals as well we question “woman,” which for us, as for Simone de Beauvoir, is only a myth. She said: “One is not born, but becomes a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society: it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine.”  However, most of the feminists and lesbian-feminists in America and elsewhere still believe that the basis of women’s oppression is biological as well as historical. Some of them even claim to find their sources in Simone de Beauvoir.  Colette Guillaumin has shown that before the socioeconomic reality of black slavery, the concept of race did not exist, at least not in its modern meaning, since it was applied to the lineage of families. However, now, race, exactly like sex, is taken as an “immediate given,” a “sensible given,” “physical features,” belonging to a natural order. But what we believe to be a physical and direct perception is only a sophisticated and mythic construction, an “imaginary formation,” which reinterprets physical features (in themselves as neutral as any others but marked by the social system) through the network of relationships in which they are perceived. (They are seen as black, therefore they are black; they are seen as women, therefore, they are women. But before being seen that way, they first had to be made that way.) Lesbians should always remember and acknowledge how “unnatural,” compelling, totally oppressive, and destructive being “woman” was for us in the old days before the women’s liberation movement. It was a political constraint, and those who resisted it were accused of not being “real” women. But then we were proud of it, since in the accusation there was already something like a shadow of victory: the avowal by the oppressor that “woman” is not something that goes without saying, since to be one, one has to be a “real” one.    And then there's this:   The ideology of sexual difference functions as censorship in our culture by masking, on the ground of nature, the social opposition between men and women. Masculine/feminine, male/female are the categories which serve to conceal the fact that social differences always belong to an economic, political, ideological order. Every system of domination establishes divisions at the material and economic level. Furthermore, the divisions are abstracted and turned into concepts by the masters, and later on by the slaves when they rebel and start to struggle. The masters explain and justify the established divisions as a result of natural differences. The slaves, when they rebel and start to struggle, read social oppositions into the so-called natural differences. For there is no sex. There is but sex that is oppressed and sex that oppresses. It is oppression that creates sex and not the contrary. The contrary would be to say that sex creates oppression, or to say that the cause (origin) of oppression is to be found in sex itself, in a natural division of the sexes preexisting (or outside of) society. The primacy of difference so constitutes our thought that it prevents turning inward on itself to question itself, no matter how necessary that may be to apprehend the basis of that which precisely constitutes it.   Gosh, it's almost as if the TERF movement wants to pretend Radical Feminism isn't Radical Feminism."

The multiple languages that gender their words to determine what pronoun you use might disagree with you."
GenderCynical,2xdoui,John_314159,17,Fri Feb 27 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"So let me follow this logic.  The biggest danger to trans women is garden verity domestic violence from their male partners.  Trans women should focus their efforts on reducing this harm.  Ok this checks out, makes good sense.    So the implication here is, trans women waste their efforts arguing trans women are women and should be recognized as such by society rather than deal with the real issue of domestic violence.  Trans women lobby for access to women shelters for domestic violence victims.  Terfs lose their shit! Claim the reason trans women want access to women's shelter is for validation.  Furthermore the violence they experience is fundamentally different from the violence experience by cis women because reasons... So I guess it's not garden verity domestic violence? I am lost here this looks like a contradiction. Terfs argue that the reason trans women should be excluded from domestic violence shelters is because they are not women.    So like if I am a trans woman and one of the biggest dangers I face is garden verity domestic violence.  But I can't  get access to help from women's shelter ""because I'm not a woman"".  Wouldn't it make sense for me to argue that I am a women?  It doesn't seem like a wasted effort at all if that is the case.  AND YOU KNOW DAMN WELL IT IS.    I don't care about gender theory, I don't care if someone doesn't consider me a ""real"" woman.  It doesn't even matter if they are right about the nature of gender identity their actions are still shitty.  They may never raise a hand to a trans person but they contribute or are at least complacent in a society that harms us.  Hiding behind feminism does not make them any different from any asshole who yells slurs at me while they drive by.  In fact I appreciate when people are upfront about being assholes."
GenderCynical,2xdoui,dysphoricfoot,12,Fri Feb 27 20:06:17 2015 UTC,I'm surprised they're even acknowledging the domestic abuse bit. A few days ago a user was implying that trans women couldn't be victims of abuse because penis. They tell trans people to simply create their own shelters but that's not a feasible option for most communities. How can a very small part of the population create their own nationwide network of shelters? Not to mention hire enough professionals to keep them all from abusing each other since apparently trans women can't help but abuse.

TERF ignores this and insists that the other arguments must imply ""gender roles.""  The brain interprets how the body should be functioning biologically. Wires can get crossed and the brain can be trying to find something that is there or get a garbled signal from something that is. That's not gender roles, it's neurobiology. Saying there's something wrong with the body doesn't have anything to do with socialization unless we're talking about standards of beauty.   And it is this innate, internal (biological yet medically undetectable) ""gender identity"" that determines sex.   If it's ""undetectable"" how were we able to know about the hypothalamus thing from before?"

Never mind that even if you choose to file trans women under the category of men, there are still plenty of studies that show domestic violence against men is not only common but extremely under reported and not taken seriously.

GenderCynical,2wxu24,JediKnight1,12,Tue Feb 24 01:36:23 2015 UTC,"I think a large part of it had to do with the desire for simplicity in early feminism, which was used to form an idea of unity. For as convoluted and scattered as some of the older theories were, a lot of it relied on a foundation about what reality was, and that foundation needed to be simple in order to make their message marketable, and to make their needs clear. Philosophical complexities were fine so long as those complexities didn't bleed into reality.  Trans people were, and are, evidence of how complex reality can be, and messed with the notion that all women had a unified experience, that all women had the same needs and goals, that oppression operated in a few very simple, specific ways. The existence of trans people had some questioning the validity of some 2nd wave claims (trans people weren't really acknowledged back in the first wave), which IMO just led to more hostility toward trans people for muddying up feminism's message and goals. Combine that with a lot of feminists having bought into sex essentialism, into gender as entirely a social construct and misunderstanding what social constructs are, misinterpretations of dysphoria and gender expression as simply stereotypical gender norms...then add some convoluted twists on radical feminism, and some mind-boggling cognitive dissonance in separatist feminists, and you get a heaping spoonful of transphobia all around.   The first and 2nd wave were both racist and transphobic, yes. Maybe not always blatantly (especially in regard to race), but white and cis as default and superior tended to be the name of the game when the chips were down. 2nd wave feminism had a very set belief that sexism was entirely distinct and separate from race, for instance, and because the feminists with these beliefs were the ones in power, and largely steering the movement, their whiteness allowed them to assume that their experiences with sexism were universal, when they were not. Much like how a number of feminist groups make assumptions about sex and gender, and assume those are universal, and that trans people's lives and experiences are invalid due to this."

Coding allows many to work remotely, and for trans people early in their transition, that offers them some financial freedom without forcing potentially awkward public interactions."
GenderCynical,2wxu24,Quietuus,7,Thu Feb 26 00:13:29 2015 UTC,"It's not really historically accurate to call early feminism explicitly transphobic. Trans wasn't conceptualised in modern terms for most of that time; it was still bound up in ideas about sexuality with concepts like sexual inversion, which there were a range of views on. You can definitely say that early stuff was implicitly transphobic, in that it didn't (indeed couldn't) understand a trans perspective, but that was not really a problem situated within feminist theory.  Proper full-bore transphobia (involving the specific targeting of trans folk as an anti-feminist problem class) doesn't come in till the 70's. Probably the two most important books in providing a theoretical groundwork for contemporary TERF thinking are Gyn/Ecology by Mary Daly and The Transsexual Empire by Janice Raymond. Of these, Raymond is the one who seems to have the most enduring influence, probably because it's an easier read stylistically and because it deals solely with trans issues. Carrol Riddel's essay Divided Sisterhood is a good contemporary counterblast. Sandy Stone's The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto is also essential reading on the topic. Between those two you can avoid reading the actual book, which is so odious I've never managed to finish it.  As for what transphobic feminism is all about, it's pretty much as /u/lockedge says: the existence of trans folk disrupted certain poorly thought out aspects of 70's feminist ideology. Rather than reconsider matters, some went to (often quite extraordinary) intellectual efforts to attack trans folk. 30+ years down the line, this has lead to some individuals whose feminism has metastasised into an almost single-minded crusade against their hated enemy."
GenderCynical,2wxu24,autowikibot,6,Wed Feb 25 03:03:57 2015 UTC,"Would a male nurse or a female engineer be an example of that or did sexual inversion actually mean gender presentation and expression?

Yeah not necessarily linked with the parts that are responsible for identity.  How else can you explain gender identity differences in cultures that don't enforce strict gender roles, or gender roles that are completely different to westernised concepts of gender. Even better, explain how gender identity can arise in children, when gender socialisation hasn't yet affected them?  You can't, not without there being a neuro-physiological root for the identity, but as you point out, it's impossible to even allow for that sort of theory without invalidating their backward nigh-religious views of gender."
GenderCynical,2wfxpc,AutumnLily11,8,Thu Feb 19 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"Precisely, even children raised from birth in the opposite gender identity (eg male sex children raised as a female from birth) recognize that their gender identity is wrong.  Still, I don't understand why they don't justify it on the basis of gender being an arbitrary thing as is core to their philosophy? How can you preach ""gender is a patriarchal lie"" when every action is dedicated to preserving gender?"
GenderCynical,2wfxpc,AdumbroDeus,4,Thu Feb 19 21:05:14 2015 UTC,"Because they are using the guise of feminism to garner attention and support for their anti-trans causes.   By supporting feminist causes and enforcing the patriarchal gender norms, the concept that women and weak, agentless and require white knighting, furthered by the co-opting all women and homosexuality they engender this sort of soft quality that you aren't aware of unless a) you're trans or b) you've already got experience of them.  While quite patently their main goal is too keep trans-activism and social movement at a minimum, they use feminism as a cover to do so."
GenderCynical,2wfxpc,AutumnLily11,5,Thu Feb 19 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"TBH I don't think so, I believe that they honestly believe very strongly in feminist issues, the problem is they don't recognize ANYONE else's oppression or at least they're so oppressed that nobody else compares so they're perfectly willing to sacrifice everyone else if they believe it even marginally improves women's positions (straight cis white women of course because that's the women who make up their movement).   In that they remind me a lot of the MRM, the mentality of ""only my issues matter"" is pretty much what drives the movement to attempt to ignore or sabotage all group's issues that aren't their own.   So less conscious desire to burn the group, more blindness, the hate only comes when the group they're oppressing becomes an obstacle to their vision of the issues of their group."

""Pulled toward an ideology based on the moral and social significance of a distinct female biology because of its emotional and philosophical familiarity. . .""

She mentions both gay men and trans women in that context in ""woman hating"" (as being ""female"").  The TERF mantra that women's oppression happens entirely on the base of biology, is totally in conflict with Dworkins views.  We can argue how much of an ally she really was. She didn't stand up against transphobic radical feminists for example. But lets also view things in the context of her time.

For practical purposes, it doesn't matter if gender identity is something that's set before the first cell division, whether it happens in the womb or whether it develops during early childhood, or whether it's some confluence of genetic, epigenetic and social factors; by the time you're coming on to puberty it's in place, and the core of your personality is laid down on top of that. The more neural connections are made in the brain, the harder it is to change; a complete shift in gender identity in the adult brain would probably require something equivalent to massive head trauma.

I do not mean that BetAle makes me doubt sociology, but rather that the logic involved requires the destruction of sociology as a field. Feminist thinking requires her logic to fail as well.  Sociology requires a sense of totality about groups, something that can be said to be common about groups in perception, in reality, etc. One cannot speak of ""women's problems"" for example, without accepting that there is some sort of totality from which to approach women's issues. Of course, there are subgroups within ""women"" with their own particular sense of totality, and as such different experiences (this isn't just cis women and trans women, but say, white women and black women). If one wants to go down to the psychological level, all women have different experiences, sociology just notes them as being related by a greater structural experience. However, by BetAle's logic, not having the ""same experience"" invalidates all association. This, along with being utterly false, completely invalidates her own frame of analysis. Requiring the tier of homogeneity that BetAle seems to require in talking about ""women"" makes it impossible for any feminist politics to function."

Of course, that is assuming that it is applied consistently with regards to the self (that women, by socialization, were permanently relegated to a submissive social role).

Ok, so say the ""FtM"" part was just an honest mistake. Some people mix up the order sometimes. But even the article they're referencing used male pronouns, so the only reason I can think they got it wrong is because the article is using the wrong pronouns, and they thought the article is using her preferred pronouns, so they tried to use the ""right"" pronouns, thus accidentally using her preferred pronouns.  Goddamn it TERFs, this is why you need to use the right terms. It's 2015, we use pronouns based on how people identify, not your bullshit system of trying to pick the pronouns that would hurt the most. It's like you're speaking another language."

I'm kind of tempted to unban you so your cowardly ass can come here and defend your bullshit. It's hilarious but also incredibly sad. Please stop associating yourself with trans and genederqueer people if you have any conscious at all. Oh, and just to kick you where it hurts, you don't have gender dysphoria. You have some kind of OCD/BID/possible eating disorder issue. Go ask any psychiatrist. You're only claiming this because you want to be ""one of the good ones."" You need to feel special and the only way you can get that validation is by pretending to be something you're not to impress a bunch of losers who will never accept you unless you conform to their ideology. Ironically, once you do fully conform, you won't be able to be one of the ""good ones"" anymore because you'll be forced to acknowledge that you're just a cis woman with mental health issues. Boohoo.  But Molly, that's so mean, why would you say that? Because I went through literally the exact same thing a year ago and decided I didn't have gender dysphoria because I didn't want a penis or to be labeled a man. Disliking your 'gender role'/society's view of your gender doesn't make you dysphoric or trans. Pretty much every gender noncomforming person goes through this.

The patriarchy makes it suck to be a woman. It did not make them stick a needle in their ass. But of course that narrative meshes with the total lack of agency rad feminism notoriously assigns to women.  And shocker, a person can detransition and not consider the original transition a mistake. I think about it probably a couple times a week. I also struggle with what exactly transition means if you're not explicitly claiming a different social identity--but, point being, you can try transition, even transition significantly, decide to stop, and not be irreparably scarred. Physiology and phenomenology are surprisingly mutable. But don't, for the love of all things delicious, try to convince a TERF of that."

GenderCynical,2usmow,lockedge,7,Thu Feb 5 12:41:07 2015 UTC,"They believe gender is a patriarchal concept imposed to oppress women and therefore needs to be destroyed. That said they are of the opinion that others taking that identity trivializes the suffering of women and that shared suffering under patriarchy is a legitimate identity, others trying to become women is trying to insert themselves into that without sharing that expirience.  Problem is of course:   The attacks on trans people is based on an idea that they are confirming gender, which is suggesting they're on endgame footing, even if they're right we're still well at the social stage where acknowledging gender is important to fix the actual issues and denial just perpetuates issues. Paradoxically their internal treatment of people that they acknowledge as women encourages belief in gender essentialism. This rightly comes off as hypocritical when gender is ok for the people they say it is but wrong for everyone else. They don't acknowledge that there are other groups who may be oppressed under gender as well because they see gender as consciously enforced by men on women (and of course trans women are seen as an example of that enforcement), so anyone who was raised as a man cannot be oppressed by the patriarchy, no matter how vitriolic oppression of that group is.   So, it's really just a lack of self-awareness and basic awareness of others, that's why they're so similar to the MRAs, because they reach these detestable conclusions the same way.  It's not that a lot of the principals that they're coming from is inherently bad, it's just with a total lack of self-awareness and awareness of the issues of others the application becomes idiotic."
GenderCynical,2usmow,frubbliness,6,Thu Feb 5 14:56:27 2015 UTC,"The way they attack trans women for crossing the gender divide is justified with extremely twisted logic. Because patriarchy hurts women, they attack trans women, because they are appropriating women's oppression? But are trans women not oppressed in most of the same ways women are?  Say instead of genders we have two different neighborhoods. Both neighborhoods have their upsides and downsides, but one of them is considered more of a ""bad"" neighborhood. Somebody from the ""good"" neighborhood for personal reasons decides they want to move to the ""bad"" neighborhood. Ok, fine. That's their choice. But then people in their new community start harassing them and saying ""You don't belong here! You chose to be here, and we were born here! You don't know what it's like! You're not one of us!"" Now not only do they get all the problems of their new neighborhood, but they are also shamed for living there. How is that justified? How is that different from how TERFs view gender?"
GenderCynical,2usmow,lockedge,7,Thu Feb 5 17:44:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going to explain the justification from how it's been explained to me in person by a number of TERFs (and ex-TERFs) I've come across in my activism  My take on it is that they care more about the idea of trans people validating an existence of gender, and removing focus away from a static, binary sex-based ideological framework. To them, trans people asserting themselves as women removes focus away from cis women's sex-based oppression, and muddies the water as to how oppression occurs against women, how female socialization occurs, and muddies what a woman is (they tend to use the gendered term woman as a synonym for their understanding of a female person...a static social descriptor that's just as fixed as a person's assigned sex at birth). To them, there's no way that a trans woman can be a ""real"" woman, or can separate themselves from the mega-oppressive 'male socialization', just like how trans men can never be real men, and can't separate themselves from harmful 'female socialization', though they bemoan trans men taking up aspects of oppressive 'male socialization' as well at times. To them trans people would be best off to admit to their immutable sex, admit their position in the social hierarchy, and work from there to dismantle gender and uphold sex (most TERFs feel that chemical and surgical transition is wrong, harmful and, to some, oppressive)  So under their mental framework where everyone is male/man or female/woman, and sex based oppression is the end-all be-all of oppression, trans people challenge that with their existence. They challenge the supposed social stability of the terms ""sex"", ""male"" ""female"" ""man"" and ""woman"", which their ideology is structured around, and if they lose that structure, they can't combat oppression. To them, they're facing a new construction of social framework that would make fighting against female oppression harder, because if trans people are accepted, then gender will no longer be seen as purely a social construction by society at large, sex won't be understood as fixed and immutable, and the terms they built their theory on will have vague, nebulous definitions largey based around intangible feelings instead of observable ""facts"".  So under their theory, from the perspective of their narrow ideology, their viewpoints make sense and they're fighting the good fight and focusing on the long game rather than any short-term losses.  Of course, from basically any other viewpoint, their ideology is...well, chalk full of holes and nagging issues, and is very much transphobic and potentially dangerous. It also makes radical feminists look bad because they claim their theories ARE radical feminism when...well, there's been a shit ton of progression from the writings from the 70s that TERFs build their perspectives around."
GenderCynical,2usmow,javatimes,7,Thu Feb 5 20:17:10 2015 UTC,"I think you did a good job summarizing the TERF position. The problem here I think is that they have trouble viewing the oppressive sex dichotomy outside of the patriarchal framework that permeates all of our language and ideas regarding sex. They have trouble thinking about patriarchal oppression without the essential idea that oppression is based on sex. While true that oppression based on sex exists and may be the most basic form of patriarchal oppression, oppression based on sex cannot be divorced from oppression based on gender roles. To get down to the point, you cannot dismantle gender roles without also dismantling sex roles. If sex roles exist then gender roles absolutely would exist.  The idea of owning up to your sex and finding power through that is a good idea up to a point. Second wave feminism was important because it taught women to stop being ashamed of their sex and letting their sex hold them back. Owning up to one's sex and breaking gender barriers anyway made huge progress for feminism and women's rights. It let women do things that before only men were allowed to do. This becomes a problem, though, when you try to make other people own up to their sex. To tell somebody they cannot change their body because they can find power through their natural body is oppressive. Something that can be done with good intentions (telling somebody they have to be happy with their body) can cause harm because it denies people their agency to have power over their own body and do what they want with it.  It's important to value the agency of people who cross the boundaries of gender and sex because by taking control of one's own body and roles in society, it takes power away from the concepts that construct oppressive dichotomies. Walking the line between the binaries turns the system on its head, and it says that the roles of gender and sex have no power over you. It is a giant middle finger to the patriarchy. It dismantles society's ideas of gender and sex, the chains by which the patriarchy binds us. There is power in both owning your body the way it is and changing your body based on what you desire.  Anyway, if TERFs want to keep their precious woman/man dichotomy, well they're shit out of luck. Just look at the linked poll. According to the poll, 50% of young adults believe there is more to gender than woman/man. What do you think those numbers will look like in a generation? TERFs will be left in the dust while the new generation restructures our most basic ideas of gender and sex. Gender will be rebuilt from the ground up. Now THAT is radical."
GenderCynical,2usmow,lockedge,8,Thu Feb 5 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Their ideology is incredibly restrictive, and relies on a number of factors to be absolutely stable and static in order for their theories to hold up and be logical. Fact is, they've ignored realities where some of those factors clearly aren't stable, and they've gotten incredibly defensive in trying to reaffirm their beliefs by tearing those who challenge them.  It just turns out that as years pass, more and more evidence mounts against their viewpoints, which only seems to make them hold harder to their beliefs. Odd thing is, as you said, combating social norms and expectations regarding gender and sex help deconstruct those social ideals and norms, and helps create a new collective understanding. It helps dismantle a system of oppression. Yet, TERFs can't see that, because they insist any recognition of gender is harmful and playing into patriarchy ... the whole 'masters tools cannot dismantle the master's shed' or whatever that quote is. Except I'm not sure that's true, and in the 40+ years since the heyday of early radical feminism, trans people, intersex people, and those who challenge the sex and gender binaries have done more to attack those systems of oppression than TERFs. I've never really seen any action or theory by them as to how they plan to abolish gender. Not even the most far out there theory. Yet, they hate anything related to ""Queer Theory"", which has begun to dismantle the binaries that have oppressed western (and certainly other binarist) society for centuries. That's huge. That's radical. And gender sure as hell won't be abolished this way, but the norms around gender will have to change as society accommodates a greater understanding of how people exist in this world of ours. How easy will it be for people to hold up binarist oppressive norms when people understand there are more than just two ways to exist in this world, that there are pieces missing?  Instead, TERFs want there to be only two ways. They want things to be simplified, so that it's easier to theoretically work with, and find easy targets. Even if it means upholding the current patriarchal standards."

Thing is, if you want things to actually change, you can't live as-is. That keeps you at Point A and you'll never get to Point B. You have to live as-if. To change you have to change. If they don't believe male-assigned people can unlearn patriarchy...what are they even doing? And if they do, their objection to trans women crumbles.  I certainly have problems with queer theory, but TE rad feminism, and regular rad feminism taken to its logical ends, is just as life-denying and hopeless as they claim queer theory to be."
GenderCynical,2usmow,Trans-Canada,5,Thu Feb 5 23:19:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly, TERFs have constantly befuddled me in that I've never gotten a remotely straight answer out of them as to how they're making their theory actionable. I see them help out in campaigns to add funding for shelters sometimes, or whatever, but nothing specific to the abolition of gender. To me, that's like saying ""I think guns are a poison in American society"" and doing nothing but griping about how terrible guns are without even sending mail off to their MP or whatever.  They want a future where no one's oppressed by patriarchy, where women and men aren't oppressively and harmfully socialized, but they refuse to trust that any ""male"" born in this system can aid in creating this change, or at least that any such people have even a place in such a feminist movement. But at the same time, they don't do anything to fight back against the patriarchy other than...gripe. And word of mouth/etc. can help people think a bit, but it needs more levels. There needs to be a fully-fledged praxis, and TERFs don't have that. They never really have other than trying to shut down tangential 'threats' that don't even damage the patriarchy they hate so much. They're all reactionary, never making their own inroads, and that's a huge issue for any feminist sect that wants to enact change."
GenderCynical,2usmow,AdumbroDeus,3,Fri Feb 6 03:00:30 2015 UTC,"I personally believe that as gender roles wane and the binary gets shattered and people start labeling their gender as all sorts of things. Gender will just slowly fade away and people will just exist as they are without the need to label themselves. I feel the need for genderqueer exists because there is still a binary to shatter. Without a firm binary, there would be no such need.  Just my personal belief though, I have no idea if that's how its actually going to go. Maybe gender will always exist in some form? I'm just hoping that form isn't as oppressive as the current one."

Because the movement by intersex people for complete personal bodily autonomy is incompatible with the movement by transgender people for complete personal bodily autonomy.

Not to mention the idea is wrong, there is very clear science on this matter to the point that if you deny it you're akin to an evolution or climate denier, but nope, inconclusive!  Bullshit, after many studies of people who had clear incentives to change their sexuality there is no evidence of success period, desire doesn't change it's hormonal responses in the brain.   If you chose to have sex with a sex you're not attracted to, that doesn't change your sexual identity just sexual practice.  Similarly sexual dimorphism is present in the brain and in study after study trans people have been shown to have various attributes of the brain structure of the opposite sex, to the point where I'd argue that being trans clearly makes a person intersex and it's just a matter of perceived sex being different then actual sex.

GenderCynical,2rksp0,AdumbroDeus,6,Thu Jan 8 09:48:50 2015 UTC,"No.  Restricting this to transwomen is derailing as is restricting this to transmen. Leelah's sucide attempt was caused by issues that TRANS PEOPLE face, there are specific trans men and trans women issues but just because this particular issue happened to a trans women doesn't mean that the conversation should just be about trans women when this experience of parental abuse and high suicide rates are common to both.   That's why it's entirely fair to for transmen to call foul when they're being peeled off a discussion about an issue that all trans people deal with."
GenderCynical,2rksp0,Trans-Canada,2,Wed Jan 7 07:23:51 2015 UTC,"While I admit I haven't followed all that much of the aftermath of Leelah's suicide, I just haven't seen anyone saying ""trans suicides are not an issue pertinent to trans men."" it seems more there's been an overreaction to instead ""trans misogyny is an issue pertinent to trans women""--which is entirely different.  As a trans man with a history of depression and someone interested in communication and community, if trans men are legitimately being marginalized out of these conversations, I really want to know. I think if so, it definitely needs to be addressed. Mitch just did a poor job of it."

There is an absolute mountain of things in that tag. The author might as well have just told us to google trans man.   From what I saw, the posts under that tag about Leelah were positive and supportive of trans people who were suicidal, and a few talking about how recent suicides of trans men weren't being talked about (trending).  The majority of the others were talking about testosterone, birth control and other issues that primarily/exclusively affect trans men.   And finally, a few posts were saying that trans men faced the exact same oppression that trans women did. Go look through that tag if you want. I couldn't find a single post in the first couple of pages (thats all I looked) of trans men being shut out of the conversation of suicide for being trans men."

I just...I know this isn't a new thing, but it seems lately people are being extremely lazy when asked to back up what they are saying. Saying ""trans men are being marginalized out of a discussion on trans suicide"" is a HUGE FUCKING ACCUSATION. It requires citations--especially for those of us who don't follow tumblr.

GenderCynical,2ripvs,mollymollykelkel,5,Tue Jan 6 20:13:43 2015 UTC,"I agree that sexuality is a social construct, but not in the way they seem to mean it. Sexuality as we define it (homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual) is a social construct. This is made obvious by the fact that in Ancient times things were viewed very differently. Homo and heterosexuality weren't distinct like they are today.  That however does not mean there is nothing intrinsic about out sexuality/attraction. I can not magically make myself be more attracted to men. Socialization didn't succeed there either."
GenderCynical,2ripvs,Freya-Freed,4,Tue Jan 6 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"Sexuality isn't a social construct, it's descriptors of sexual attraction which is biological.   People lacking a concept of sexuality as sexual attraction in the past doesn't change the fact the fact that those words in our current language describe sexual attraction, and saying that homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual people didn't exist in the past because people conceptualized sex in terms of what people did rather then desire is like saying that germs didn't exist prior to the existence of a word to describe them."
GenderCynical,2ripvs,AdumbroDeus,3,Tue Jan 6 21:55:33 2015 UTC,People have different skin colors. This is a biological fact. Yet race is a social construct. Sexuality is in the same vein a social construct.
GenderCynical,2ripvs,Freya-Freed,3,Tue Jan 6 22:02:03 2015 UTC,"Sexual attraction is a biological fact, peoples' brians react differently to different sex hormones which defines sexual attraction. In modern English sexuality describes sexual attraction, so it is a biological fact not a social construct.   Edit:  The only reason it's argued that sexuality is a social construct is due to different usages of the term. This is either due to intentional misunderstanding (eg. your religious conservatives to argue sexuality is a choice), people arguing that it's always used as a social construct even though people think they're using it to refer to desire which you'll find in queer theory, or simply defining it differently for a specific context.   The latter is more coherent, but still incorrect, because there simply is not case of majority usage that doesn't fit sexual desire, for example people disbelieving bi people is because they doubt that bi people desire both genders. The last one should only be used when that understanding of sexuality is explicitly agreed upon and understood and labeled as non-normative, eg an academic context.   This is an issue because since the general public uses it to mean desire, popularization of non-normative uses will serve to benefit the religious conservative prospective first because it's the larger minority usage."

I'm sure that this is a process that a lot of homophobes and transphobes go through when they find out that someone that they love is LGBT. It takes time, and it doesn't always end, and it in no way excuses the hurt that bigots inflict on their loved ones while ""evolving,"" but normally they can just go through with it in some measure of privacy without a global audience watching on and encouraging their bigotry. The author has lost that luxury--her emotional struggle has now become grist for the transphobic mill. She's being actively and publicly rewarded for not accepting ""Tom"" for who she is, and for holding on to bitterness and entitlement. This isn't good for anyone involved, except the sklenton ladies and other transphobes who can weaponize her personal problems for their cause.

How would her life be different if she didn't have a platform from which to broadcast her thoughtlessness, and an audience willing to put a laurel wreath on her head for it and tell her what a martyr she is? How would her relationship with her ex be different?   I could extend this, and wonder how many TERFs would be TERFs if they didn't have their shitty little clubhouses to tell them how awesome being a TERF is and how enlightened and radical they are, while simultaneously expressing alternating currents of disgust and pity for the ""funfem"" sheeple who don't agree with their hate.   How does a person in that situation move on? How does a person in that situation come to terms with the fact that hey, fuck you, some people are transgender and that fundamentally affects their experience of and perspective on gender? How does some adult sense of perspective and empathy enter into that feedback loop? It just boggles my mind that so many people don't just hate us, but build identities out of hating us.  edit: Just to be clear, I hold the author responsible for her shitty attitudes. She needs to wake up to her own selfishness and the ways in which her own attitude is probably a lot more harmful to her children than her ex's struggle to live with gender dysphoria and be the person that she can't help being. The fact that her asininity is enabled by a shitty community does not change the fact that it is asininity.

Politically, socially, economically, race is, of course, a brutal reality around the globe. But the concept of race is a creation of the powerful. If we want a just world, the material institutions that keep people of color subordinate need to be dismantled. And the concepts of ""whiteness"" and ""blackness"" themselves will ultimately be abandoned as they make no sense outside of the realities of white supremacy.  A lot of people get confused when asked to apply the same radical analysis to gender. But from a feminist perspective, the parallels are obvious. Are there differences in skin tone across the human species? Yes. Why do those differences mean anything? Because a corrupt and brutal arrangement of power needs an ideology called racism. Are there differences in the shapes of people’s genitals? Yes. Why do those differences matter? Because a corrupt and brutal arrangement of power—patriarchy—needs an ideology called gender.  Patriarchy is a political system that takes biological males and females and turns them into the social categories called men and women, so that the class of men can dominate ""people called women."" Gender is to women what race is to people of color: the ideological construct that underlies our subordination.   At first glance this actually sounds kind of great. You can't be racist without races, you can't be sexist without genders. But, wait...pretty much every educated POC speaking on racism has said that the whole ""eliminating race"" idea is NOT the way to end racism. Rather, that we have to engage and acknowledge institutionalized racism, address its complex history and work from a position of deep understanding before it can ever be defeated.  So, to take that analogy and then say that the right way to end sexism is to abolish gender...well, the failure there should be obvious."
GenderCynical,2pmasl,girl_undone,-3,Thu Dec 18 11:33:18 2014 UTC,"You misunderstand.  We need to acknowledge that sex and race exist in order to end sexism and racism, but we also need to reject the ideologies of sexism and racism, the ideologies that say there are significant inherent differences between people of differing races or sexes. We need to acknowledge what has been made real by society, while rejecting society's logic for making these realities. For instance, that means acknowledging that people of color and women have been denied opportunities and do what it takes to make those opportunities available to them - which is in stark contrast to the ""pretend it's not an issue"" standpoint which would rather pretend that everyone has equal opportunities already.  It's the liberal queer movement that thinks sex can be eradicated, that we can ignore the history of sex and gender and rewrite it for a better future. In doing this, they are acting the same as people who ""don't see race."" They are erasing the history of the subjugation of women, not addressing it at all.  There is another difference between race and sex that mars your comparison, and that's culture. For instance, in America, where I live, people of different races tend to be separated by social groups for multitudes of reasons. There are different cultures in America because of this, and many of those cultures should be named and celebrated. Men and women, however, are not separated in the same way and thus do not have different cultures between them. It's been very important for people of color to rejoice in their cultures in the face of dominant American white culture, which has always been racist and thus harmful for people of color.  When people talk about eliminating race, they tend to be white people who, well-intentioned or not, are proposing things that would be very harmful for people of color, because they aren't considering the realities of racism, and are assuming that white culture is some sort of ""normal"" base line that isn't racist and is superior to other cultures, which is itself obviously racist.

Being trans doesn't excuse one from being a creep, sure (even I know one MAAB genderqueer person who seems to constantly forget I'm with a boyfriend and seems to have trouble with the concept of personal/intimate space), but to paint all of us with one brush? Seriously? Not to mention, if they're at a support group, they're more than likely to have other issues, autism being one that can lead to accidental creeping with no bad intentions meant. I'm actually glad they left, because a support group should not be run by them. A support group needs to be run on the Humanistic Psychology idea of unconditional positive regard, with empathy running high. You're dealing with people who need help, stop expecting totally functional people, and for god sakes stop generalizing. We tend to get killed by folk like those over at GenderCritical, so if we want to play that game, you're all murderously discriminatory freaks (GC obviously is not, but it's Reductio ad Absurdum)."

GenderCynical,2pbpp5,Freya-Freed,13,Mon Dec 15 05:31:35 2014 UTC,"Gonna answer non-sarcastically.  They believe that because ""biologically"" they are women and trans women are not ""biologically"" women that they would be allowed in.  However, the way they use biologically seems more like ""socially sanctioned"".  In that, they base who counts biologically as women as who are assigned female at birth.  So even if a trans woman is intersex or transitions early, they are forever their assigned sex. Similarly sex can't change even if a trans woman has been on hormones a significant period of time and their medical, social etc. needs are more in line with their target sex than their assigned sex.  This allows them to maintain a power differential between them and trans women.    You can see evidence for this in the way that trans women who are terfs refer to themselves as gay males when interacting with cis women terfs.  Trans women are not attractive to gay males, have only small cross over in medical concerns as gay males, do not usually engage in relationships with gay males,  are oppressed on the basis of their sex/gender by gay males, are not exclusively or defined by attraction to men, and generally have completely different needs in every way (social, medical, economic etc).  So calling trans women gay males prevents trans women from having the vast majority of their needs met or their voices heard, and that's generally the idea behind terfism.  To keep trans women from speaking for and defining themselves as a way to maintain cis privilege and control."

GenderCynical,2pbpp5,mollymollykelkel,3,Thu Dec 25 12:46:28 2014 UTC,"It doesn't make any sense.  For me, gay men aren't interested in me and I'm not interested in them.  My boyfriend has only ever dated women.  If I were to date again I'd look among straight and bi men.  So why would I categorize myself like that? Categorizations are made so as to be useful to humans, not to be assigned to us regardless of how little it makes sense or accomplishes anything useful.  The same goes for my body.  My body conforms with being female outside of my genitals, so why would I call myself male?  It's a category that doesn't work at all unless you're a doctor, but really a doctor needs to treat me as a trans female.  Because I have medical concerns that are unique to trans females and categorizing me as cis female or cis male would provide in incomplete care for me.    Feel free to say you're a gay male, just don't call me or any other trans woman that.    As far as sexual health goes.  Like OK, HIV is a problem in both communities.  That's a similarity.    But any other type of advice is not the same between trans women and gay men.  Like how to please a trans woman is very different than pleasing a guy.  Relationship advice needs to take into account gender, and gendered oppression.    You've never been oppressed by a gay male?  Like individually? I don't think you know how oppression works.  Gay men certainly have privilege over trans women.  Look at employment figures and poverty levels, there are discrepancies between trans women and gay men.    I understand radical feminism well.  But that's a pretty easy way to be just generally dismissive.  ""If you truly understood it, then you'd agree with me"" blah blah blah."

So because some trans people are horrible abusive jerks, you run to TERFs to complain about them, positioning yourself as the 'good trans' (I'm not even gonna attempt to translate that into TERF speak.)  Oh ok. I guess the ends justify the means. Whatever those 'ends' would be? Having a captive audience who will hate on other trans people with you?

Oh ok. I guess the ends justify the means. Whatever those 'ends' would be? Having a captive audience who will hate on other trans people with you?   I think some trans women/men do this because they need acceptance from someone even if that someone doesn't truly accept them. For example, there was a trans woman I knew who had the shittiest friends. Like they'd misgender her constantly and would fight with her over it. When a friend of mine or me would try to defend her, she'd get really angry at us and do the whole ""you stupid SJWs"" spiel. People look for companionship in weird places and it tends to get weirder when they're desperate.  Personally, I think it's one hell of contradiction to have a TERF ideology and be trans. It's like being a Jewish Nazi or a gay Republican. It's their right to choose who to ally with but their motivations are questionable."

They're anti-kink, anti-porn, and sex-negative. Those are all immoral positions. They also believe that sexuality is a choice, which is so actively harmful to gay rights.  There's a reason why radfems are being driven out of feminist groups in droves. Nobody can stand them. I also find it funny how they insist on using outdated terminology, e.g. referring to all feminists they don't like as ""libfems"" even though most of the people shutting them out of feminist groups are third-wave. It's like they're stuck in the '70s even though everyone has moved on.

I've met a lot of radical feminists who aren't any of those things but they do have critiques for particular issues within those communities. Like let's take pornography. Most of the radfems I know think adults should be able to enjoy porn. The issues come up when talking about the mainstream porn industry. The lack of verification of consent on free porn sites and porn being generally not friendly to women are some examples. That doesn't mean they're anti-porn; they just have objections to the conduct of many people within the mainstream porn industry. Hell, a few of the moderators here are pro-trans, pro-porn, pro-kink radical feminists who don't believe sexuality is a choice.  The problem here is that the extreme minority drown out the majority in terms of press. You always hear about and see TERF/SWERF blogs on Reddit (makes sense since the average Reddit user has a poor concept of feminism in general anyway) and these blogs are defined as the standard for radical feminism. I mean, just look at how often someone like Cathy Brennan is used as a legitimate example of feminism.

Sexism in porgraphy isn't unique to one genre or one source. There are certain subcommunities of porn that are controversial but overall the emphasis is consent. Could you give me some examples of your claim? I've seen some SWERFs get upset over BDSM but SWERFs are a minority like TERFs. I also wouldn't say all men are into BDSM or that all men would disagree with those who are critical of porn.   Verification of consent like... what? A pdf of notarized letters? Because adding in those scenes with the lady talking to the camera will eat up a lot of bandwidth just to make a feminist point.   Verification of consent shouldn't be there to be a talking point. It should be there because rape is against the law and inhumane. This would mean the hosting server would need to collect personal data on users who ulpoaded videos (phone numbers, SSN, address, etc). Consent forms would be created and submitted.

Of course, to project it onto the whole of society as coming after them and oppressing them (male and female are legit biological terms, useful for people and medicine and everything really, and I'm one of the most gender-progressive people I know). It's sad really that someone is clearly so hurting. But to present it as a legitimate sociological/psychological/political observation is pretty... Inaccurate.

The Byzantine Empress Irene sometimes called herself basileus (βασιλεύς), 'emperor', rather than basilissa (βασίλισσα), 'empress' and Jadwiga of Poland was crowned as Rex Poloniae, King of Poland.

GenderCynical,2okovk,Philae_90,9,Sun Dec 7 21:35:44 2014 UTC,The thing they ignore is that it's not entirely the modern understanding of transgenderism. It's clear that Bioware poured a lot into understanding transgender issues before writing this character and it's clear they put his life in the context of his culture and how it responds to the discovery that he was female-assigned-at-birth rather than having his transgender status an afterthought bolted on to the fantasy setting.

I thought the Krem character was just an extension of that weird modern-progressive trend in DA. However there is a serious catch to Iron Bull's acceptance of Krem as a man. If you put Cassandra and Iron Bull in your party you might get a piece of dialog where she will ask him if the Qunari allow women to be soliders. Iron Bull reveals that under the strict traditional law of the Qun if a woman decides to be a soldier they must agree to become something that is basically the Qunari equivalent of transgender.  It was really funny to get this little slice of radfem dialog after seeing all the pro trans reaction to the character. As much as some people complain about little problems with the character I was surprised no one was talking about this. Bioware was really sly to slip it in there like that out of context with the Krem character. I guess we'll see the real backlash when someone makes a youtube of it.   How is this radfem at all? It's borrowing from history. They always approve of these weirdly patriarchal fueled traditions just because they think it makes trans people less credible. Fucking gross."
GenderCynical,2okovk,Trans-Canada,11,Sun Dec 7 20:06:42 2014 UTC,"Iron Bull and Cassandra. For the quote in question.  Cassandra: I am surprised you accept fighting at the woman's side Bull. I understood Qunari women did not fight.  Bull: If a Qunari women really wants to fight, and has a gift for it, she becomes a Aqun-Athlok. The Aqun-Athlok joins the warriors and is treated like a male. He becomes a guy, for all intents and purposes.  Cassandra: But she wouldn't physically become male, surely.  Bull: Doesn't matter. In the Qun, your role is everything.  TL;DR Bull comes from a culture where your gender and role are closely tied, and people who change their gender-assigned roles become another gender, based on that role. You are strictly defined by your role. Hence why Bull has absolutely no issue with Krem. In Bull's culture, Krem's gender would never be questioned."
GenderCynical,2okovk,LovingLilith,1 point,Sun Dec 7 22:04:15 2014 UTC,"Ok, just found this sub. Hi.   The video is down, do you still have the quote somewhere? I'm asking because some other NPC started talking during this conversation and I missed the punchline about whether Iron Bull saw Cassandra as a woman.  Anyway, I wasn't trying to say that Iron Bull didn't actually accept Krem. Just that the whole situation is slightly more fucked up than it seems at first glance."
GenderCynical,2okovk,Philae_90,6,Thu Mar 19 20:01:09 2015 UTC,"Even most mainstream TERF's still advocate trans-exclusion in a much broader context of feminist thought, Germaine Greer or Robin Morgan only devote so much time to talking about transgender issues compared to other issues within feminism.  These people do not, they are completely focussed on one and only one issue and they take anything, even the subtle MRA stuff, to get to their end goal. I get the impression they'd prefer a world with a fixed glass ceiling, open misogyny and 1950's expectations of women with no transgender people than a fully equal world with us.  There's also nothing weirdly modern about the transgender issues. Krem's culture is extremely backward and vile in its treatment of him and the Qun laws only allow it because of the nature of its rigid, conservative caste structure. It's very well rooted in the context, I had a bigger problem with Leliana's sexuality and politics in DA:O.  This isn't modern liberalism nor would it matter if it was. There's no logical inconsistency in imaging a high fantasy world where politics are progressive, feudalism has collapsed but the technology has not caught up with ours, especially when magic could replace many modern functions of technology."

I think they might mean:   Trans man writes that being trans does not make one's views of women's (possibly trans men's?) bodies less misogynistic.   The only way I can connect this statement to the article is that they are both talking about people's bodies and the context in which we perceive them. The article does not talk exclusively about how trans men perceive trans men's bodies, but about how all of society does. The article argues that the mainstream model of ideal masculinity is still the mainstream image of trans men, which is an inaccurate model of trans men as a whole, and which reinforces hegemonic masculinity (which is related to misogyny).  The article is not by a woman. The article does not talk about misogyny. The article does not talk about women's bodies, and it does not talk about their purpose or function.

We do after all having trans women athletes dominating female sporting events to the point that they are able to make thousands of dollars doing it.    What happens when a super athlete decides she's a trans woman, and goes on to dominate women's sports?  Raking in living wage after living wage.  Living it up with health insurance.

If you recognize gender as an arbitrary set of ever-shifting social and cultural rules, it doesn't make sense that there are some hardline ends to a gender spectrum between men and women that can be combined as ""non-binary"" or ""genderqueer"" to begin with.   Because you don't understand what non-binary and genderqueer really mean, this statement doesn't make any sense."
GenderCynical,2nhs4m,frubbliness,4,Thu Nov 27 17:59:48 2014 UTC,biology is not binary.

GenderCynical,2nhs4m,frubbliness,6,Fri Nov 28 02:16:48 2014 UTC,"then ""feeling"" that one belongs to the other gender for reasons that are either vague/bullshit (""I have a female brain"" or ""I have always felt male"")   Vague? The entire underpinning of why transgender people exist in their philosophy is a malevolent meta-social puppetmaster that no one who believes it exists can adequately define nor agree upon.  ""I have always felt x"" is enough. If our identity requires a complete rigorous explanation of every reason why we think and feel a certain way then any sense of identity would just collapse. The same logic could be applied to homosexuality (not that they'd really mind that). Do have to defend my attraction to women on anything other than ""that's how I've always felt?"" or even just ""that's how I feel"" without any reference to past feelings?  EDIT: correction."
GenderCynical,2nhs4m,frubbliness,11,Thu Nov 27 02:55:50 2014 UTC,"They go on and on about how trans women have to prove they're women... well, how about you prove they're not? Not so easy, is it?  Edit: The point I'm trying to make is that there is no essence of ""woman-ness"" that all women have in common. There's nothing that all women have in common that they also don't have in common with any men. I think that's the same point the article was trying to make."
GenderCynical,2nhs4m,javatimes,8,Fri Nov 28 15:25:40 2014 UTC,Isn't it also circular to say woman is a human female? What defines a human female? What is a feature all human females have?

GenderCynical,2n3nb5,AutumnLily11,3,Mon Nov 24 20:05:29 2014 UTC,"The rape accusation is one that grinds my gears most. It reduces rape to a political tool, ignoring the significance it has to its victims in exchange for creating a cheap horror trick.   The snap that made me lose my faith in feminism and start fully identifying as genderqueer was Robin Morgan's accusation that Beth Elliot was effectively a rapist on account of her being transsexual.  Among the rhetorical tools of the TERF's, it's the one that sickens me most."
GenderCynical,2n3nb5,Philae_90,3,Mon Nov 24 22:02:23 2014 UTC,"Its especially disgusting when you've faced down the insidious and toxic pain that is left in the wake of things like rape.

GenderCynical,2n3nb5,mollymollykelkel,2,Mon Nov 24 22:14:30 2014 UTC,"I suppose it depends upon who you include in the MRA's. The less antagonistic fathers rights movement, at least in the UK, pushed for reforms that were pretty much essential and a few that still are. Our parental laws are in desperate need of reform.  At our Gender and Feminism Society, I think quite a few of us supported more parental equality but more from the principle of child welfare than any fathers rights or feminist principles."

I'm not an MRA but then I'm not a feminist either and I would still be uncomfortable with that statement inverted. I'm certainly more sympathetic to the MRA in this thread (though they have their own trans-exclusion issues).

I'm willing to respect the rule about no attacks on feminism, am I not entitled to satirise GC as well, especially on a sub that has no express allegiance to feminism on its description? Even more so given that that TERF's were one of the main reasons I abandoned feminism in the first place.  I'm here to mock GC, that's all. I made a comment above where stating I wasn't a feminist was relevant to the point. I wasn't attacking feminism, I wasn't going into a long talk about why I lost faith, I've done that on /r/offmychest and discussing it's over for me.  All I want to be able to do is being able to express that I do not identify as feminist when it is relevant to a point without being called up to justify why I'm not a feminist, attacked for it or told to go elsewhere when this isn't a sub identifying as a feminist safe-space or a sub about debating feminism anyway. It's a sub parodying transphobia and gender critical feminism, which is all I'm here to do.  Why is that so much to ask? I fully respect that you're a mod of this sub but am I expected to self-censor a fact about my socio-political identity even when it's relevant, inoffensively put, and there's no invitation to debate it?"

GenderCynical,2n3nb5,Philae_90,3,Sun Nov 23 05:09:16 2014 UTC,"What he means is that this sub isn't neutral.

GenderCynical,2mbhwb,Bmonkey5,2,Mon Nov 17 13:29:31 2014 UTC,"Welcome to every other trans woman's life experience ever.   NSS.   Go to a doctor, go do a biopsy, get a diagnosis.   OK, so this is what your problem is. You think that all medical conditions are known and characterized, and that everything that could be diagnosable already has an established test, where you simply go to the doctor and get that test and then the doctor tells you the results of that test. So basically, you have a child's view of how medicine works. You don't realize that doctors don't know everything. You don't realize that there isn't a test for everything. You don't realize that sometimes a person who has a medical condition has to fight to have that condition recognized.   What you don't understand about science, medicine, and the history of intersex, is that these things aren't always clear. If you noticed earlier where I suggested that transsex women might have a PAIS in the brain, then you should understand that you can't simply walk into the doctor's office and get a brain biopsy. But I'll tell you what. If you want to give me a budget and a lab I'll happily investigate this for you. In the meantime, I suggest you study the history so that you have a better idea of how our modern ideas about intersex have developed.   First read ""Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite"" to get a first person perspective of one of the famous early cases. Then read Alice Dreger's ""Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex"" for an overview of the decades of conflict over the discovery and characterization of the then-known intersex conditions. And if you're up for it read about the misery and tortured life of a late 19th century trans woman in Autobiography of an Androgyne (TW: lots of rape and violence).  The definition and understanding of ""intersex"" is still evolving. We are far from a complete understanding of all these conditions. If you want to argue that transsex is not an intersex condition, then you are going to need to use the current state of scientific and philosophical knowledge on these conditions to explain your position and persuade me otherwise, rather than assuming that your position is already established. It is not. We don't even know how many intersex conditions there actually are because the subject is extremely complex. So please, don't insult my intelligence any further. Go educate yourself and stop wasting my time with such childish insults."

I've repeated that theme over and over, and it has gone ignored by the members of the trans community on this thread (including yourself). So yeah, you're right. This thread is good example of what Dr. Costello was talking about - in that the trans community is not concerned with promoting medical autonomy for intersex children."

It seems the debate is irrevocably muddled by personal vendettas and such.  I can totally see the intersectionality that exists between Intersex and trans experience, both involve people struggling for their autonomy regarding their bodies, gender identity, and gender expression, rather than allowing parents, doctors, or society at large to dictate that for them. But I am totally not Intersex, and my experiences are unique from that of most Intersex folks.  I don't think I've met a trans person who is not against genital surgeries on young children or babies that don't even have the cognitive capacity to consent. I don't think there are many trans people who think it's ok for parents to pressure teenagers with vaginal agenesis to get a vaginoplasty.  What is way more important is how those thoughts and words translate into action, and that's sort of where I am at a loss."
GenderCynical,2mbhwb,viviphilia,0,Sun Nov 16 17:26:56 2014 UTC,"I regret that I was unable to recover the thread from Jess's derailment, but I did keep trying to bring things back to the issues of informed consent and medical autonomy.     But I am totally not Intersex   I am not saying all trans* people are intersex. I'm saying that severe genital dysphoria is certainly caused by an intersex condition of the brain. When I say ""transsex"" I am specifically referring to someone who has severe genital dyphoria with their natal genitals. There are some people who identify as trans who do not experience that type of dysphoria and their transition might be motivated more by social reasons than biological reasons. I don't think they are intersex.  And since ""intersex"" is an identity, even someone who has severe genital dysphoria doesn't need to identify as intersex.    my experiences are unique from that of most Intersex folks   Why do you believe that your experiences are different from ""most intersex folks?"" There are over 30 different types of intersex which have a wide variety of effects on a person. So even within intersex people the experiences are very different.     I don't think I've met a trans person who is not against genital surgeries on young children or babies   While that might be the case, what Costello and I agree on is that the trans community can and should be doing more to call attention to this problem.    What is way more important is how those thoughts and words translate into action, and that's sort of where I am at a loss.    I think participating in this discussion is a step in the right direction. For me, viewing my transsex as an intersex condition has strongly motivated me to read the research and talk with and learn from other intersex people in order to spread awareness about problems which intersex people face."
GenderCynical,2mbhwb,-Enkara-,3,Sun Nov 16 22:08:51 2014 UTC,"Warning: This post turned into brain diarrhea, I is tired, I hope it makes sense.   I don't really view your interpretation of the word Intersex as invalid, but I do acknowledge that everyone has their own interpretations, heck, everyone has their own definitions of what ""transgender"" means, my own definition of that word has traditionally been pretty fucking broad, and has narrowed of late as transgender came to replace transsexual.  Ultimately I guess I believe it's all semantics and doesn't (usually) matter.   It's an interesting point though, how do we determine when we have the right to assert that a label applies to us, regardless of what the vocal minority, or majority, in said group thinks about that?  Even that sort of line varies between all people... Do tumblr otherkin folks with headmates have the right to appropriate the label ""transgender"", for example? Ask a different trans* person, get a different answer. Ultimately I think that situation is commonly young people who are ultimately going to identify cis but are playing with gender identity and identity in general, which is a good thing and ought not be discouraged.  I guess in the end my answer to these questions is ""I don't know"", and I don't think there's an ultimate truth, it's all social/semantic bullshit which I don't excel at honestly."
GenderCynical,2mbhwb,viviphilia,2,Mon Nov 17 06:37:07 2014 UTC,"That definitely makes sense and I appreciate your thoughts here. I can't blame you for not agreeing with me at this point. My arguments here are still fragmented. I need to collect my thinking in some serious writing and fully explain my reasoning.   You've asked a great question and I hope you'll permit me to state a simplified interpretation. It seems like you're asking - when is self-determination legitimate? I think language plays a huge role in legitimizing self-determination. At some point, if you want others to respect who you are, you have to convince them of who you are. Language is our only tool for that. That's why this conflict with the TERFs is so important. They are promoting rhetoric which undermines our identities. We have to convincingly use our language to persuade others that we are who we say we are.   The reason why I say that as a transsex person, I am intersex, is because that's where my study of the science and philosophy have lead me. Whether or not there is some ultimate truth, this is how I see things. This is what makes sense to me. And it makes sense to others too. As ugly as this thread is, I've had people tell me that I changed their mind here.   I think you're underestimating yourself. Your words here do a good job of expressing your thoughtfulness. I appreciate the effort you put into your writing."
GenderCynical,2mbhwb,-Enkara-,2,Mon Nov 17 07:48:45 2014 UTC,"It seems like you're asking - when is self-determination legitimate?   This seems like a good simplification to me.   The reason why I say that as a transsex person, I am intersex, is because that's where my study of the science and philosophy have lead me.   If Intersex was purely treated as a scientific word I'd agree with you, I don't really follow the science that affirms that trans folk are ""born this way"" so much because I don't really care, (and see it more as a tactic used to justify our existence to haters, when even if we weren't ""born this way"" it would still be perfectly acceptable to be trans)...  All that is to say I don't know much about the studies, but I bet that decades from now we'll have way more concrete evidence that could only be doubted by the same sort of people who are able to doubt global warming with a straight face today.  It seems to me like there's also a social interpretation of the word Intersex, which being social, brings us to a sort of ""how even do words anyway?!1"" argument that is highly subjective. It's not open to critical analysis in the same way the scientific definition is, (radical?) pragmatism and not furthering oppression against oppressed groups takes more of a priority in my mind. If a large portion of Intersex folk take issue with me identifying as Intersex, I'm going to be way less likely to identify that way in general... Because in my mind it doesn't harm me at all to not identify that way (whereas not identifying as a woman or trans is harmful to me).  The other thing is would my identifying as Intersex harm Intersex folk... Well obviously I can't answer this question and the fact that I don't interact with Intersex people enough to know what they'd say in response to this question disturbs me a bit.  I could see an issue if trans people en-masse decided to suddenly call themselves Intersex, while fighting for all the transgender-intersex issues under the banner of ""Intersex rights"", much like how ""LGBT rights"" groups have this same problem, tacking on the T but ignoring it completely. (That doesn't seem to be what you're doing though)  I guess if I were educating an ignorant cis person, and the scientific context came up, I might describe being trans as a sort of Intersex condition, but I don't usually have those sort of ""justification"" arguments with cis people anyway because I don't think it matters, so it's never really come up.  I guess what I don't understand is why you want to identify that way, in spite of the (if Intersex folk are upset about it) pragmatic issues, and I don't mean that as ""I don't understand it therefore you're wrong"", but as an actual ""I maybe haven't experienced the same reasons you have so can't automatically understand it"" sort of thing.  It does bring to mind a separate observation I've made where a lot of times in the past I've come across trans people who wanted to get genotyped, and I used to want to myself, so that we can use the word ""Intersex"", and it's usually been a validity thing, at least it was for me. But it's only a validity thing in the context of the cissupremacist medical establishment and society at large (we do, as trans people, have some level of medical establishment legitimacy, but probably not as much as Intersex people because we ""could be making it all up"" and they by virtue of some more easily observable physical or genetic trait couldn't ...by that convoluted logic.)  The fact that they have the more easily physical or genetic ""evidence"" doesn't really work in their favor oftentimes, since the cissupremacist medical establishment then thinks it's acceptable to force treatment and surgeries on them... It's pretty telling that it's all about ""cis"" or ""gender/sex-normative"" people exercising their illegitimate authority over the lives and bodies of ""trans"", ""intersex"", or ""gender/sex-nonnormative"" folks.  EDIT: Thanks for your kind words, I am really enjoying this discussion, I think my opinions are getting clearer in my head by discussing it."
GenderCynical,2mbhwb,Bmonkey5,1 point,Mon Nov 17 08:55:50 2014 UTC,My primary effort on this thread has been to steal intersex people's narrative.    FTFY
GenderCynical,2mbhwb,viviphilia,-2,Sun Nov 16 11:51:41 2014 UTC,"Huh? What ""narrative"" are you talking about?"
GenderCynical,2mbhwb,viviphilia,5,Sun Nov 16 21:47:56 2014 UTC,"While that paper is great for its solid rejection of TERFism, it is still very problematic for its implicit transphobia. However, instead of talking about that I'd rather talk about this:   Costello says:    When someone presents a surgery as mutilating, trans advocates may immediately attack them as transphobic. This is very alienating to intersex people, and it is time for a more sophisticated approach. What trans people need to do is shift from arguing that hormonal treatment and genital surgery are lifesaving wonders that are never misapplied, to talking about a fight only for positive interventions into bodily sex, and never for negative ones.    A week before he posted his paper I posted the following on /r/CriticalGender:    Another problem with ""female genital mutilation"" instead of ""child genital mutilation"" is that intersex children all over the world are still having their genitals operated on at a very young age without providing informed consent. It's easier to dig a hole than to build a pole, so an intersex boy with a micropenis might have his genitalia removed/reconstructed at a very young age without being asked.  This issue of intersex children needs greater visibility. Since transsex people are currently in the spotlight, we can assist our intersex friends by bringing up this intersection.  All of these practices which ignore the principle of informed consent should be abandoned - except for in cases where there is a genuine medical need.    On child genital mutilation and informed consent   You can imagine how I was literally banging my head against a wall after reading Costello's paper. Yes, it is time for a more sophisticated approach. And I posted a more sophisticated approach a week before he called for it.   Focusing on the issue of informed consent and medical autonomy is more sophisticated than ""positive interventions"" and ""never negative ones."" If Costello has read ""Critical Intersex"" he should already know that the doctors who do those surgeries believe that they are ""positive interventions."" So Costello's rhetoric is ineffective.  The common theme here, for both transsex and other intersex people, is denial of informed consent and medical autonomy. When intersex children are subjected to surgery without their informed consent, it is a denial of their medical autonomy. When trans people are unable to get surgery for our well-established medical condition of sex dysphoria, it is a denial of our informed consent and our medical autonomy. To correct both of these problems we need to advocate for informed consent and medical autonomy. People need to be able to make their own informed decisions about receiving or not receiving genital surgery, whether it is waiting until a child is old enough, or giving the surgery to a trans person who asks for it.   In addition to being right about TERFism, Costello is correct about something else. The trans community can't be bothered with this topic. I know because it's the primary focus of my activism. And as well known as I am, I get little to no support for my efforts. So yeah, if I seem like I'm angry, that's why.   To the few people reading this who were aware of how I felt about this paper when it came out, I can't thank you enough for the support you gave me at that time. I really did intend to quit my activism and you gave me the support I needed to get back on track."
GenderCynical,2mbhwb,Jess_than_three,5,Sat Nov 15 08:17:26 2014 UTC,"So, it seems like you're upset because the author, discussing an issue from a broad, communities-focused perspective, didn't acknowledge and likely hadn't read your specific post? That seems very... well, something.   It's also interesting that you've completely ignored the section on how ""trans-ness is a subset of intersex-ness"" is really crappy and inappropriate and appropriative, to the point where in this comment you refer to ""trans and other intersex people""..."

I was talking about how the trans community here on reddit, while knowing who I am, mostly ignores my work on intersex. How could Costello ever have heard of my work when I am for the most part a pariah in the trans community? It wouldn't make any sense for me to be upset at him. It's not his fault. It's the trans community's fault for not paying attention to these important matters. What I'm upset about is that he wouldn't have been able to make those criticisms if the trans community had been listening to me.   If you want to talk about ignoring things, try looking at what you've been ignoring. For example, when I said that Costello was engaging in implicit transphobia, it should be obvious from my other writings that his policing of trans people's identities is what I was talking about. It isn't up to Costello or any other diagnosed intersex person to tell a trans person whether or not we are also intersex. Important researchers have argued that transsex is a form of intersex, and as you should know that is something I consistently argue. I didn't ignore Costello's transphobia, I simply chose to use my time last night to talk about the more important political issue of what transsex and other intersex people have in common - that is the denial of our informed consent and medical autonomy."

And I've seen this complaint often from people that doctors won't let them get a vasectomy or hysterectomy before a certain age because they ""might want kids later"".  Now there is some regret on my part that I didn't bank, but at the time it was absolutely vital for me to get on hormones and I simply didn't have the money. It was still the right choice and it was my choice and my fertility.  But they aren't really concerned about me I guess. They're concerned about ""kids"". They keep saying lots of ""kids"" are being sterilized and then turn out gay instead of trans, but I have yet to see any numbers on this.  That's why the default treatment is puberty blockers until 16. So fertility and ""natural"" puberty at that point is recoverable if the person changes their mind. And even after starting HRT there is a long period where stopping hormones can temporarily/permanently restore fertility.  Of course they also don't have any positives to weight against the negatives because they obviously don't believe that transition solves anything. Which we both know is very very wrong.  And yeah there is some valid criticism in there about using gender stereotypical things to ""diagnose"" gender dysphoria, but that doesn't take away that most trans youth I know that were on puberty blockers and later on hormones are much much happier then the people that wait longer. And there are actual statistics to back this up.  I feel bad that there's some people who wrongfully transitioned and regret it because of how society deals with gender, and I know some of these people are on GC. But that doesn't mean trans don't real and current usage of hormone blockers is barbaric. But this is of course totally to be expected because the feminism that sprang ""gender critical"" is kind of notorious for projecting their issues on other people/women."

For trans women, that they're just straight men trying to wiggle their way into lesbian women's spaces. To have sex, I guess.  The risk of violent death, the fundamental changes to the body, the ostracization from the rest of the society is apparently worth it for maybe having sex?  Alternatively, for trans men, gender-nonconforming women who have been brought down by the patriarchy is their idea, which is a pretty extreme interpretation of the nature of social influence."

It goes like this:  Why not allow trans people into the bathroom of their proper gender?    Bathrooms are segregated by biological sex, not gender.    (Leaving aside the biology aspect) Why are they separated at all?    Because men are violent and prone to rape and assault, and women need a safe place to relieve themselves.    Not arguing with that, but why are men violent?    Because male culture teaches them that it is expected of them, that they are naturally better than women and should enforce the gender hierarchy at all times.    So they should be kept out of women's bathrooms because of their gender, not their sex.    explodes"

There are prominent conservative leaders who see transgenderism as a tool for folding queers back into heteronormativity,   No, Astraloid. This is a fiction which you, as a reactionary, are manufacturing in order to create artificial divisions in the LGBT movement. You continue to ignore that trans women post-transition are about a third each gay, bi and straight. A trans woman identifying herself as a lesbian isn't folding anyone back into heteronormativity, no matter how much you hate trans women. And furthermore, you are participating in the same authoritarianism as those conservatives when you try to force a straight or bi trans woman to identify as a gay man.

And then there are trans women like me who don't even get second glances. I've actually never had a problem in any women's room. So if the TERFs want to police changing rooms based on the perception of masculinity, they are going to be policing butch lesbians more than trans women like me.   And furthermore, I don't see how policing masculine appearance is actually going to stop any predators. How about we police actual criminality instead of perceived gender?

You might not realize this, but it's rare that anyone is actually policed on their genitals. Spaces are typically policed based on perceived gender. So whatever a person's genitals actually are, and whatever sex marker they have on their ID, it is usually a person's appearance which causes initiation of policing. In most women's spaces it is not actually possible to police a space based on a person's genitals.  In cases where a person has permission to be naked, most trans women are going to be hiding their genitals. In this case where she is minding her own business and being discreet then it would be morally wrong for someone else to police that person. In a case where a person is being indiscreet, then there are a couple things which can be done.   First of all, let me just ask you what is the minimum length of a penis for you to initiate enforcement of your standard? One inch? Two inches? Narrowing that down will help us discuss details of who should or shouldn't be policed and of course that will be necessary if you actually want to create some kind of law about this. However it might be awkward if the person has their ""penis"" measured by police and they end up falling beneath the threshold for being an offending penis, especially if they identify as a woman and have ovaries and such.     For the sake of the argument, we'll just assume the penis is obvious and at least several inches minimum. If the person is showing it off and being obnoxious then the facility staff can ask the person to please be more discreet. And if they continue causing a disturbance, there are usually local ordinances which deal with ""disturbing the peace"" and related issues. Wouldn't that sufficient to address this issue?   And if you could further clarify, do you mean to say that you are OK with trans women who have had genital surgery using the women's locker room?     Butch lesbians don't rape women with their penises.   I'm not sure if that's true, but the fact remains that women sometimes rape other women."

On one hand I can understand the pain of being forced into a gender role or being confused about your gender, but why then take that pain and put it on someone else?   For example, some users there have mistakenly thought that they were trans. They blame the rhetoric of ""trans activists"" for their confusion.

It is no coincidence that former nun, Janice Raymond, is promoting that position. You're being misleading by trying to characterize the permissibility of transgender as a conservative position. The Iranian decision to permit sex transition was based on the progressive position that transsex is a medical condition in the same category as an intersex condition.

There are several parallels you could make. TERFs hate trans people because they subscribe strictly to sex = gender. What if someone said marriage = man + woman? Or sex = man + woman? One could argue the purpose of sex is to reproduce, so gay sex is wrong. What about sterile people? We can ignore them, they have a condition (like they say intersex people don't matter to the trans discussion). One could say being gay is a choice (like they say being trans is a choice).

I think the lack of research is due to what a big taboo it is to suggest transgenderism could be in any way psychological.   Can you imagine the outrage if someone suggested that feminism was a psychological disturbance where a woman failed at cooking and so she felt like she didn't belong in the kitchen, or lesbianism was a psychological disturbance in which women feel like they are failing at pleasing men and so they try to please women instead? There's a taboo on that kind of invalidation because women need to be able to self-determine and we don't need patriarchal TERFs cissplaining our lived experiences to us."

There is a whole layer of morphology on top of the gametes, and then a whole layer of social construction on top of that. Your view of sex is reactionary, not radical.   Gender roles are social norms which are imposed on us, I agree. But gender identity is the internal motivation to behave according to gender roles. If there weren't such a thing as gender identity then we wouldn't be arguing. Gender is a fact of life.   The way gender roles are currently constructed tends to oppress women. But trying to pretend like gender is going to magically disappear is unrealistic and unhelpful. Feminism has had great success in redefining gender roles and reducing enforcement of gender roles. Much more work needs to be done within that paradigm and the unrealistic abolition ideologues are derailing those efforts with their nonsense."

GenderCynical,2ke01c,Jess_than_three,4,Wed Nov 5 00:11:11 2014 UTC,"Good questions, thanks for asking.   How can you tell gender is inherent when people are socialised to act a certain way from birth?   I didn't say gender is inherent. I'm saying ""gender identity"" is inherent. Gender as a whole is made up of at least two parts, ""gender roles"" and ""gender identity"". The roles are constructed but the identity is inherent.   I don't see why people continue to make such a big fuss over socialization. If socialization were deterministic then feminism would be impossible. Women are supposedly socialized to be submissive and etc..., But somehow, those of us who become feminists are able to break out of that socialization or reject it in the first place.   I personally became a feminist independently around age 16 without actually knowing any other feminists. I rejected gender roles, including monosexuality, and I thought of myself as not having a gender. That didn't work for me in the long run. The urge to identify as a woman has never in my life gone away, and I have never in my life seriously thought of myself as if I were a man.   And here's another implication from the socialization perspective: if socialization is so deterministically powerful then why don't trans women identify as men? It doesn't make any sense to say that there are certain elements of socialization which are permanent, but the identity itself could be rejected. That doesn't add up.    That's like saying if there weren't such a thing as god we wouldn't be arguing if god exists or not.   OK. What I was trying to imply was basically what I just said above. It doesn't make any sense that, trans women especially, would go through what we go through if it weren't something permanent. But as I have argued above I don't see how the permanence of gender identity could be caused by socialization, which is clearly less deterministic than biology.    Gender is a part of society that varies dependent on the society, if it were part of life it would be uniform regardless of culture   But what I'm saying is that ""gender identity"" which is simply an internal motivation to identify oneself as male or female is uniform across all cultures. In contrast, it is the gender roles, the way people live as their gender, which differ between cultures.   gender roles are oppressive in nature   I really don't know why anyone would assume that gender roles are inherently oppressive given the gains made by American feminists in the last 50 years. We have radically redefined gender roles and we are still making progress. This clearly shows that oppression can be reduced by redefining gender roles.   Even if you got rid of this supposedly socially constructed conceptualization of gender, humans are still sexually dimorphic. Males, who typically have high testosterone, are on average quite a lot stronger than women. That physical strength is a huge factor in the ability to oppress, and it is caused by an element of human sex which doesn't necessarily have anything to do with any gender role. So by the fatalistic logic which it seems like you're using, we'd need to get rid of sex dimorphism in order to ultimately get rid of sexist oppression. That's why I have said elsewhere that we will have gender as long as we are human. Maybe once we can download into cyborg bodies then we'll be able to be ""equal"" in terms of all the things which gender-sex entails. But personally, if I get the opportunity to have a cyborg body, it will be a smokin' hot babe's body like Motoko Kusanagi!"
GenderCynical,2ke01c,Freya-Freed,3,Thu Nov 6 05:43:05 2014 UTC,"I think the high transition rate of intersex people is good evidence that there is some extent to which people have an innate sense of gender.  Of course, it's more complicated than that as many transition for other reasons, but a high number of them describe feelings very similar to non-intersex people who want to transition. http://home.myfairpoint.net/isgt/  There have also been a lot of studies about brains of transgender people that support this but it's difficult to prove that that actually produces an innate sense of gender so I'm not going to talk about those much right now.  It should be pretty easy to find a few if you want to.  I do actually agree with you that gender roles are bad and are oppressive by nature and it would be great if they didn't exist though.

The authors are ""in plain language reiterating what the DSM-5 actually says."" In other words, they are ignoring what the DSM-5 says and using their own pathologizing ""plain language.""   Here is what the authors of the DSM-5 are actually saying, in plain language:    DSM-5 aims to avoid stigma and ensure clinical care for individuals who see and feel themselves to be a different gender than their assigned gender.   Yes, that is the actual DSM-5 website and the APA fact sheet on GD. It's obvious that MetaRedditIsACancer is desperate to try to portray the DSM-5 as supporting his mistaken view, but the truth is that it is only the authors of the biased paper might agree with his mistaken view.   The authors were aware of the DSM-5, and therefore they must be aware of the shift to the diagnosis of ""Gender Dysphoria."" Yet they gave no indication of that fact. In the quote cited by MetaRedditIsACancer, the authors are acting as if ""Gender Identity Disorder"" were still an extant diagnosis. They said, ""the person is diagnosed with gender identity disorder"" in the present tense, failing to share with their readers that GID is obsolete. The truth is, people ""were in the past diagnosed"" with GID, but no longer.   This is clearly a sign of a pathologizing bias among the authors. They want to maintain the older, pathologizing diagnosis and they are ignoring that the diagnosis has been overhauled to eliminate the stigma against trans people.   This evidence of bias is also shown in their choice of what to include in the abstract. The purpose of including the statistically insignificant finding about pedophiles among trans people, which is no greater than finding pedophiles in any other population, was to contribute to the ongoing moral panic against trans people which we are all so familiar with.   So here is the biggest problem with their concern trolling. A standard part of transitioning is taking an anti-androgen such as spironolactone or cyproterone acetate. These androgen blockers are used in the treatment of sex offenders to reduce their libido and reduce the risk of them reoffending. Obviously the decision whether to go on such a drug should be between the client and their doctor. But getting pedophiles on a drug which is used to treat sex offenders sounds like a good idea to me.   So once again, the TERFs are so focused on bashing trans women that they aren't even willing to question if their methods are actually supporting their stated goals of defending women."

Unsourced claim. Several sites claim an average viewership of around 1 million viewers per episode as of 2013. Nothing to write home about really. But they are assholes, I'll give you that.    My question:  Where are the trans women?  WHERE ARE YOU?     Mostly busy trying to survive crushing unemployment and discrimination. We can't all be full time activists.   Oh, right, you are busy fussing about lesbians not sleeping with you and attacking the infinitesimal number of women who define as “radical feminist”   Ah back to the old trans people are rapists trope then. Speaking of infinitesimally small populations, what percent of people are transgender? 0.3%? This is the patriarchal vanguard, ladies and gents.    I have seen NO posts about this on tumblr. None.  Zip.   Because tumblr encompasses all of the internet, right?    The hundreds of angry trans women who spent incredible amounts of time trying to stop a teeny-weeny conference of 30 radical feminists (!)  are totally ignoring these right wing millionaires who call them pedophiles.   Oh so we're angry now? But hey, angry is a code word for scary and this is all about making people scared of trans women, isn't it? That's why TERFs call us paedophiles constantly and work with reactionary right wing bigots to restrict our access to public accommodations.    Where do you lazy trans non-activists get off claiming no feminists care about trans women, when you ignore Tea Party millionaires who are zealously organizing against your rights?   Who is saying feminists don't care about trans women? Some feminists have done a great job representing and being allies to trans people, others much less so. Feminism isn't some monolithic bloc. You keep pointing out that they're tea party millionaires, as if that somehow makes their brand of transphobia more reactionary than the transphobia of petty bourgeoisie academics or working class leftist collaborators.    Is there some reason you focus on the small fraction of women who call themselves radical feminists, to the exclusion of politically-connected TV stars who single you out as pedophiles and instruct the people of Arkansas to call the cops every time one of you tries to pee?   This was physically painful for me to read. It's like you have just enough self awareness to formulate the right questions, but not enough awareness to figure out to whom they should be addressed. Maybe TERFs should turn their hatred toward rapists, murderers, MRAs, Republicans. Hell anyone actually causing tangible harm to women (including trans women). That would be great. But then the cult would cease to exist, wouldn't it? Nothing says I care about women more than a laser like focus on the destruction of one vulnerable minority while the MRAs storm the castle. Maybe TERFs need to reevaluate why their movement is so useless? Furthermore, you're still trotting out the TERF hallmark that all trans women can be distinguished from real feeeemales at a glance.    See, ladies, this is why we think you are frauds and misogynists.  Understand now?  You fuss about the deaths of trans women, yet the plight of trans women in Arkansas does not worry you in the slightest.     I detect a hint of sarcasm in your employment of the term 'ladies'. But really, stop pretending to give a shit about trans women. Your faux concern is more irritating than simply admitting you hate us. Yes, we ""fuss"" about the deaths of trans women. Because it's a damned tragedy and if you're too thick to understand why this is a problem where misogyny intersects with cissexism then you're beyond help.    Let me know when yall are ready to head out to Arkansas to demonstrate against the transphobe Quiverfulls.  I am ready to go, and of course, I have wanted to demonstrate against the Duggars since forever   I'm glad you have the luxury of being able to travel all the way across the country on a whim.

GenderCynical,2jo4y9,popeguilty,6,Sun Oct 19 07:46:38 2014 UTC,"Sort of. Admittedly, I'm not an expert on the subject. But my reading of their conclusion is that random noise in the data MAY cause incorrect or misleading results if they rely on standard margins of error when comparing multiple samples. Since most fMRI software packages have methods for dealing with FDR (False Discovery Rate) and FWER (Familywise Error Rate), they argue that the analysis should be tweaked to deal with the possibility of such errors.  It is not an indictment of the effectiveness of fMRI as a way of understanding brains anymore than uncontrolled for variables can lead to misleading results in radiometric dating (as intelligent design believers are oh so careful to point out).   Regarding the data gathered from studies with trans people, I would say that the reason we haven't been able to come to a meaningful conclusion as of yet is multifaceted - lack of funding, lack of interest in funding, tiny simple sizes and a lack of understanding about how to interpret the results. What we do have so far is interesting and promising, but requires further investigation.   Regardless, whether or not we can conclusively prove whatever it is they would like us to prove, it should not have any bearing on the rights or treatment of trans people."

I hope you don't mind if I follow up on a couple of points.   /u/generibus said:    Women are not beating transpeople.    Chrissy Polis was beaten by other women. TERFs certainly contribute to the social stigma against trans women which motivates that kind of violence.   /u/BeeeboBrinker quoted me talking about how some genetic females are born with eggs, ovaries and a penis.   She added:    Here's what else the unfortunate people with CAH also often have: salt-wasting crises in infancy   I'm glad to see that Beeebs at least went to the Wikipedia page on an intersex condition and tried to learn something. That's a step in the right direction. However, she's still got a lot to learn. What she failed to learn is that there are more kinds of virilizing CAH than the salt-wasting variety. She also failed to learn that there are conditions other than CAH which can produce virilization. Any condition which produces sufficiently high levels of testosterone in the developing fetus has the potential to virilize the genetically female child, partially or fully. And furthermore, while it is a serious problem to have salt-wasting CAH, that female person will be still be virilized. Assuming the doctors don't cut it off without her informed consent, or that she doesn't identify as a man, she can still be a woman with a penis and ovaries.   One of these days TERFs need to try to understand that their vicious attacks on trans women are harmful to other intersex women too. Biological sex is not binary. There are some people who are in between male and female."
GenderCynical,2jjm4i,viviphilia,8,Sat Oct 18 05:25:43 2014 UTC,"Here's another one.   /u/deirdreofthegaians said:    How would you express the term ""the group of humans who create egg gametes""? What would be a word for that for you? Is it okay to have a word for that, one which operates independently of identity?   A human person who is actually producing eggs is a female person. But taking testosterone stops egg production. So if a trans man starts taking testosterone, he is no longer female by your reductivist standard of gamete production.   If you disagree with this then you need to elaborate on why you think he should still be considered female when he has male hormones which are producing primary virilization and male secondary sex characteristics which make him look like a man in society - and perhaps most importantly - when he identifies as a man and as male.   As far as I can tell, deirdre, your only way out of this is spurious chromosome or socialization essentialism, neither of which you have any objective support for. So in order to make that stretch, you are not only going to leave objectivity behind because you're not accounting for the hormones and their effect on phenotype, but you're also going to leave subjectivity behind as you ignore the lived experiences of another human person. That would be a deeply anti-feminist and possibly even misanthropic position for you to take.   deirdre, you're clearly one of the smartest of the TERFs on reddit so I challenge you not to take the easy way out on this problem."

No person who has hurt or killed a trans person has cited radical feminist views as their reasoning. Trans people are killed because of the same oppressive ideas about male entitlement that cause the murder of domestic violence victims, prostitutes, et cetera.   They wouldn't be wrong if they left out the part about justifying violence with radfem views. Radfem view: People with penises can't be women and people with vaginas can't be men.

All people who have or who once had a penis is a man and had male socialization, which makes them violent, aggressive rapists. All Penis in vagina sex is rape, so trans*women who identify as lesbians are rapists by default, and those who identify as heterosexual are really gay men who want access to women's spaces to rape them (because gay men love pussy, apparently). No person ever experiences gender dysphoria.  What they have instead is autogynephilia, which means they want to mutilate their bodies to pretend they are women so they can get off by thinking about themselves.  Or something.

GenderCynical,2jck7l,AFlatCap,5,Thu Oct 16 00:30:41 2014 UTC,"disclosure: this is a throwaway. i didn't want my main account linked to the things i'm going to say.  I think there are a few factors here. I don't doubt that there are some genuinely awful people who happen to be trans and some have even sent threatening or inappropriate messages to so called trans critical feminists (I refuse to call them gender critical because of their laser like focus on trans issues).   First off, when they talk about trans activists (alternatively 'transactivist or 'transjacktivist') what they mean is all trans people. Every trans person by virtue of existing is an activist for some tinfoil trans conspiracy. It's a snarl word used in the same way as 'warmist' or 'gay agenda' is wielded by conservatives.   We also have to keep in mind, this is the internet and on the internet nobody knows you're a dog. A lot of these threats are being posted anonymously with no way of tracking who sent them. Otherwise we would be seeing a lot more screenshots and calls to the police. Confirmation bias fills in the rest. Some of them are fabricated from whole cloth by TERFs. Others are channers or disenchanted goons who are both anti-trans and anti-feminist and enjoy stirring up shit.  Also keep in mind that like Jess_than_three said, they will take anything you say and twist it to sound like it's a death threat.  Trolling other trans people used to be a twisted hobby. 2010 was incredibly dark year for me. I hit a wall in my transition and felt like my life was going nowhere. I was being pelted from all sides by dysphoria, by lack of friends, by perpetual joblessness and crippling social anxiety that I was self medicating with drugs and alcohol.  I started reading TERF blogs after they were linked to an IRC channel I was in. At first I reacted like any rational and empathetic person, with disgust and incredulity. But after a while I started taking it to heart. The long short of it is that it was a convenient ideology for me to bludgeon myself with. There was a reason I was like this and it was because I was a terrible person literally raping women with my existence.   Flash forward a bit and I'm experimenting with going off HRT. I started running a couple TERF accounts on various sites under pseudonyms. I got to know a couple TERFs (none of the big names). I used my platform and my new 'friends' to seek out and tear down vulnerable trans people. And part of me felt really good. I felt like I was doing the right thing. More than that, a dark voice in the back of my mind really got off on hurting other trans people - by projecting my own insecurities back onto them as venom.   It wasn't uncommon for us to pass around rumors of threats. While a small number of them were verifiable, many more were coordinated intentionally. Many were received anonymously with no way of tracking the sender. Which in some cases was the owner of the account using an alternate. And like I said, confirmation bias fills in the rest. Everything is a means to an end that serves the ideology.  So the short answer to your question, yes. Some trans people are terrible people and have no doubt done this? Is it as prevalent as they claim it is? I highly doubt it."

GenderCynical,2jck7l,viviphilia,1 point,Wed Oct 15 23:09:13 2014 UTC,"Those kinds of threats are counter-productive to trans feminist efforts. A trans feminist who makes those kind of threats is part of the problem. That being said, holding all trans feminists accountable for those threats is itself a silencing tactic.   Since I started /r/CriticalGender, I have had as the top rule:    Threats of violence, death wishes, and over-the-top nonsense will not be tolerated.   I don't expect anyone to go out of their way to praise me for that policy but I do expect critics to respect that many of us speak out against violence. I do what I can to oppose threats.  And furthermore, at least one of reddit's TERFs have threatened to try to dox me, although one other TERF spoke out against her and she later expressed regret for what she said. So it's not like threats are a one-way street. People say dumb things when they are frustrated, it would be better if it never happened but people do make mistakes."

I'm not going to lie and say that Nazis, KKK, or other reactionary scum getting doxxed and fired from their job makes me sad though.

To try and explain this I can only assume that due to some last issues, during my most hormonal phases I was completely open to abuse and was t realising it due to not caring about myself. I went through a few relationships with many of the same type of woman (all cis) and the same things kept happening. The idea that cis women, can't rape, is just plain bullshit and has been shown as such. My evidence is anecdotal but go ask a couple of MRA's, or egalitarian feminists, they'll have studies showing that rape in and of itself isn't a gendered action, anyone in power has the ability to do it"

Yet the minute you bring their focus of ire into view all that goes to fuck. All trans women are the same clearly, a monolith to be judged and cast down. My fucking arse.  Whatever the trans-women did does not reflect on who I am as a person, so how the fuck does being trans mean I can get away with anything?

Since those people exist, it makes sense that we critically think about genitals. Male-typical and female-typical genitals exist in nature, no doubt about it. But the way we think about human genitals in terms of meaning and identity is in large part socially constructed. So a person who has ambiguous genitals might, if they wanted to, think of themselves as somewhere in between male and female. And I think it would be valid for that person to think in such a way.   I wonder why the blogger didn't get the hysterectomy earlier? Is it because she felt like she wouldn't be fully a woman without her womb and ovaries? Well, that would be her own thinking, not ours. Trans and intersex people are fighting against the dogma that genitals and gonads determine identity. So I'm not sure why she's mad at us. Maybe just venting?"

""Those busy feminists"", i.e. those people who don't have anything ""better"" to do with their time than try and show gender is a societal construct. What a bunch of losers!   Meanwhile, the pragmatic trans feminists who occupy the middle ground continue to be ignored. Gender is a biosocial phenomena. It is not entirely biologically determined, and it is not entirely socially constructed. Gender emerges out of the combined effects of our biology and our socialization.    Trans feminists are even developing rhetoric which resolves the issue from both sides. We widely acknowledge that ""gender roles"" are socially constructed and they need to be modernized in ways which empower women. But ""gender identity"" appears to be biologically innate, and that requires us to respect the experiences of trans people. This clearly allows us to maintain our feminist commitments as well as assert the legitimacy of our preferred gender-sex.   The reason we don't see the TERFs challenging this pragmatic bifurcation between roles and identity is because it thoroughly undermines their paradigm."
GenderCynical,2i1pej,viviphilia,3,Thu Oct 2 02:18:24 2014 UTC,"Sincere question: So how would you define ""gender identity"" apart from a preference for certain roles?"
GenderCynical,2i1pej,JosiahHenderson,4,Thu Oct 2 17:21:01 2014 UTC,"i am not who you asked, but i would like to aver an answer:   i believe that most people have what julia serano called a subconscious sex. yes, this term has taken a beating, largely by TERFS--but there's no perfect term. I think how strongly this characteristic is ingrained in a particular individual does vary widely--and frankly, most cissexual people have had no reason in particular to question their assigned sex and its accuracy. (please note my use of 'most', 'vary widely'--there's ambiguity here, both among trans and cis populations and the small percent of people outside of that paradigm.)   This has nothing to do with gender roles, and it really doesn't have to do with a ""brain gender"" (which is a TERF dogwhistle, sometimes for good reason), because one's subconscious sex has much much more to do with physiology and endocrinology than whether someone was forced to play with an easy bake oven.   I have a male subconscious sex. No one knows why, and I can't explain it any more than a cis male could likely explain why he thinks he's male (not that anyone would ask him!) My personality with regards to adherence to gender roles is marginal. I don't really 'get' gender roles and would like to see them destroyed. My body feels comfortable with post pubescent male sex characteristics.  I generally explain this as a 'body map' issue, but TERFs like to tear down that language, so I'll explain it as plainly as possible.  I owe feminism a great deal for shaping a world where I can get my body in line with what makes me most comfortable."
GenderCynical,2i1pej,javatimes,7,Thu Oct 2 18:20:43 2014 UTC,"I've just started on whipping girl and I really like the term ""subconscious sex"" over ""gender identity"", ""gender"" or ""brain sex"". It really describes how I experience my transsexuality the best."
GenderCynical,2i1pej,Freya-Freed,2,Thu Oct 2 18:49:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your answer, your personal openness, and also your sensitivity to the problematic of some of these terms and ideas. I still am quite confused about what the heck trans activists are talking about when they talk about ""gender identity"", but I am trying to understand and I really appreciate your taking the time to answer my question. I have some more questions, but please do not hesitate to tell me to get lost or go read a book if I am imposing on you or if this is not the right place for this discussion.    I have a male subconscious sex. No one knows why, and I can't explain it any more than a cis male could likely explain why he thinks he's male (not that anyone would ask him!)    I am what you call a cis male. I think I can explain why I think I'm male (and indeed, I think I can explain why I am male whether I think so or not) with reference to my chromosomal and gonadal characteristics. I can also explain why I sometimes do or do not ""feel male"" with reference to how I have been socially conditioned to think males should and should not feel. I think I hear you saying that what /u/viviphilia is calling ""gender identity"" and what you are calling ""subconscious sex"" is not either of these things, right? I really have a hard time locating in my own matrix of identities anything like that thing. If I am understanding you correctly, this is because I lack an innate ""subconscious sex"" opposed to my assigned and publicly recognised sex, and therefore I have developed my identity in terms of my ""conscious sex"" instead? (I hope I have not distorted your position here.)   So does ""subconscious sex"" come down to a hypothetical biological trait that disposes us to either have a dysphoric or a euphoric relationship with our sexed bodies?"
GenderCynical,2i1pej,JosiahHenderson,4,Thu Oct 2 18:56:04 2014 UTC,"sorry, it took me a long time to come back to this.  I knew that bit about saying ""cis male explains why he thinks he's male"" would be troublesome, but I couldn't word it any better than that.  You point to chromosomes and gonads, which obviously are most of the basic biological understanding of sexes. But I have a couple of responses to that. for one, unless you've got them sequenced, you probably don't actually know you are XY. So you are using evidence of your body and sexed characteristics to state you are XY, and thus male. I wish to bring my body as close to possible to a similar body status--and honestly, that is why I ""think I am male"" (phrasing was chosen to mirror previous phrasings about cis males.) So in my view, we aren't that far apart.  It's just, because you are cis, you have a naturalized claim to maleness, and I have a degraded, artificialized claim, though I am just as natural, and just as male as a cis male. Obviously that is a big sticking point with TERFs, but no TERF has ever been able to convince me otherwise about myself.   Because I arrived at trans feminism through Julia Serano's work, I highly recommend most part of her Whipping Girl book. One criticism people have that I agree with is she sometimes over taxonimizes things, but she does have a background as a biologist.  I try to skirt issues of measured brain differences and the like. I don't think it's a particularly fruitful road for further trans acceptance, though lots of trans people disagree. It's also underdeveloped due to many factors."
GenderCynical,2i1pej,javatimes,3,Fri Oct 3 23:55:29 2014 UTC,"I really have a hard time locating in my own matrix of identities anything like that thing. If I am understanding you correctly, this is because I lack an innate ""subconscious sex"" opposed to my assigned and publicly recognised sex, and therefore I have developed my identity in terms of my ""conscious sex"" instead? (I hope I have not distorted your position here.)    You're not talking to me, but kind of. In the social sciences, this particularly relates to the notion of positionality. To use a non-transgender related example, a similar problem comes up with sexuality. When heteronormativity is prominent, and there is very little conception of anything other than it, it is difficult to even conceive of an alternative sexual identity, where as to a gay, lesbian or bisexual person, this is very easy to see, solely based upon position. Similarly, if a woman lies in contradiction to basic ideas about gender roles, it is very easy for her to recognize a problem others might see as natural. This is chiefly because as humans we have a tendency to ""naturalize"" things we perceive to be true based on culture, over the actual reality of the matter.  Now, as I understand it (I'm cis, so forgive me), being transgender is chiefly related to a dissonance of physicality (manifest as dysphoria) which leads to a positional recognition of things that I as a cis person cannot see (the recognition of the ""subconscious sex"", or the ""gender identity""). It is important to note, however, that transgender people can see this differently within their class based on practice (or how they choose to move through a structural system). Some will attempt to justify this based on a structural relation (""I liked pink as a child, which justifies my feelings under the current framework"") while others will recognize both structures (""it seems this 'gender role' shit has very little to do with how this actually works based on my experience""), which seems to stem (from an etic or outsider's perspective) from an individual-based interaction with the broader structure. The former seems to be a focus of critique of Gender Critical types, but doesn't seem to differentiate much from cis people's justifications of gender (as they are grappling with the same structure). This can have something to do with individual action, but little in terms of the latter group (though they could have medical structural impositions force them into certain gendered behaviour, of course).  Forgive me if this is a bit dense, but I tried to explain my terms a bit in case you don't know them."
GenderCynical,2i1pej,AFlatCap,2,Fri Oct 3 17:17:12 2014 UTC,"Well, I'll need to write a longer answer after I take a nap, but can I lean on you not to use ""trans activists"" here? Just say trans people. Trans people have had to be active to get respect, but it's really confusing to see ""trans activist"" used in the TERF way, because to me a trans activist is someone like ...hmm I'm drawing a blank. Chaz Bono? Someone who basically is an activist for their job. Which most trans people aren't. Anyway, it has a strange connotation and is often used to besmirch trans people."
GenderCynical,2i1pej,javatimes,2,Thu Oct 2 20:00:47 2014 UTC,"Okay, thanks! I look forward to your answer! :)  I'm not exactly sure what was inappropriate in my use of ""trans activists"" (without intending to imply a ""sinister trans agenda"", I do think it makes sense to talk about the fact of a social movement promoting a certain way of thinking about gender) but I will try to avoid this terminology if it is loaded."
GenderCynical,2i1pej,JosiahHenderson,2,Fri Oct 3 00:08:22 2014 UTC,"Trans people are just people. I mean, yeah, some of us are involved in a trans liberation movement, but generally that's sort of orthogonal to discussions of language and terminology."
GenderCynical,2i1pej,javatimes,2,Fri Oct 3 00:31:14 2014 UTC,"Gender identity is a sense of self in terms of being male or female. A preference for certain roles is simply a mode of being. The gender roles allow a person to ""be as."" But the gender identity itself is the innate desire to ""be as."" That is to say, people tend to follow gender roles so they can ""be as"" a male or female person.   Is that helpful? Because I can definitely elaborate."

GenderCynical,2i1pej,Jess_than_three,5,Thu Oct 2 04:20:31 2014 UTC,"I think it's awfully telling, as an aside, that they evidently consider ""we must respect the boy who feels himself to be fully male"" to be an absurd, problematic, or otherwise objectionable proposition. Um... Yes? Yes, we should do that? Yes, we should respect all people by default, regardless of their gender, their genital configuration, and the parts they were born with?   Even more telling is the implication. The title makes clear that no ""boys"" (ie AMAB children) are deserving of respect - whether they ""feel themselves to be fully male"" or not. Which really, ultimately, is the fundamental thesis of the TERF platform.   Of course, that's further underscored by their obsessive, laser-focused obsession with trans women to the near-complete exclusion of trans men. Should a ""girl"" who identifies as male be respected? Their professed philosophy suggests that they shouldn't, as basically ""delusional"" people with ""fraudulent"" identities who seek to gain and benefit from male privilege - but isn't it interesting that that just never seems to come up?"
GenderCynical,2i1pej,Jess_than_three,3,Thu Oct 2 01:44:34 2014 UTC,"Aside, as GC can't resist replying to everything we do:   I'm leaving this post up to point out how stupid GenCyn is. ""Sexist book written by cis woman"" isn't even remotely accurate to anything we've posted here, considering the 'cis woman' in question is the female children's book critic who wrote this article, and the actual book authors vary in gender and even feature an autobiographical story about their favorite Trans Child Token, Jazz. Are they saying Jazz's life story is sexist? :) :) :))))))   The reason why Molly is framing this in terms of ""sexist book written by a cis woman"" is not because every book in the recent transgender book phenomenon is written by a cis woman per say, but to point out that these narratives that you dislike so much are hardly being pushed by trans people themselves, but even the ""women-born-women"" so idolized. Even if Molly made a mistake and is referring to the book critic here (maybe she has no WSJ subscription, and frankly I wouldn't blame her), that further compounds the point. Narrative has very little to do with how trans people actually are, when trans people are very diverse. Further, such narratives are not pushed by trans people alone, but more likely by a patriarchical system trying to address an anomaly Meaning this is less trans conspiracy and instead, something more familiar. Something, frankly, TERFs help participate in enforcing.  To address what someone said further down about ""transgender"" being conservative, I would disagree at base, especially if its based on someone conservative trying to justify the existence of transgender people through gender roles. This is merely conjecture in order to avoid cognitive dissonance, and any strict analysis of trans people will yield a far more diverse group than one based merely on gender roles."
GenderCynical,2i1pej,AFlatCap,4,Thu Oct 2 22:40:39 2014 UTC,"It's funny because almost all trans women I know hate the media's narrative of us. Media controlled by cis people. Some trans women collaborate because they get promised money or because they are naive. Some people think that ANY exposure is better then none. Narratives that can't be sensationalized or be made to fit the very narrow acceptable narrative are just filtered out.  How TERFs somehow think we are the driving force behind this I don't understand. Like, the whole idea is laughable and stupid. It makes them sound just as silly as other conspiracy theorists."

GenderCynical,2i1pej,viviphilia,2,Fri Oct 3 00:05:42 2014 UTC,"Beeebs said:   the supposed innateness of gender roles.   What Beeebs is failing to grasp here, due to her continuous deployment of strawmen, is that trans feminists are not suggesting that gender roles are innate. Trans feminists are saying that gender roles are socially constructed. It isn't gender roles which are innate, but rather gender identity. That is the urge to follow the gender role in order to ""be as"" one's preferred gender-sex.   Filling the gender role is a means to an end, not the end. The end is to ""be as"" a woman according to one's innate psychology. (I am speaking as a trans woman here, and trans men can speak for themselves about their experiences.)  There are many cis women who do not understand that there are ways to ""be as"" a woman outside of the traditional gender role. So it is patently absurd to expect that all trans women would accomplish that unrealistically idealistic goal. The TERFist double standard here is how they complain about how we're not feminist enough, and then they ignore our commitments to feminism.   If radical feminists want to do something radically new, then we should try empowering femininity. As far as I know that's never really been done before. The unrealistic goal of trying to abolish gender is a waste of effort."

Although it is now inactive:  link1 linked specifically to her view on trans women.   link2 I think she stopped considering herself a radical feminist though, because to many people used her work to defend radical feminisms transphobia.   I honestly hope there is a revival of radical feminism that's trans* inclusive, intersectional, and not patronizing to sex workers   Heck me too. Radical feminism and 2nd wave feminism in general weren't perfect, the greatly failed trans women (and most radfems are still failing miserably in that area), but there is still a lot of good stuff there."

While a poor person who becomes rich will retain some of the socialization they gained while poor, they will be socialized into new habits and attitudes (for example, often the rags to riches  sort will begin to believe in a more ""just world fallacy"" interpretation of things, or that they worked particularly hard compared to their peers). Another example would be how people view themselves and how others view them as they age.

Pat Robertson never brought up trans issues as part of his rhetoric, then he said it was natural (or at the very least not sinful) and then he made a comparison with horses. Yet you're saying he's pretty consistently minded against you. Interesting.   He said that trans people were like castrated horses, never fully female but a ""low-aggression male"" or some nonsense. This matches up with TERF narratives about castration pretty nicely.   Yet one of ours says something innocuous like ""her"" or ""she"" to refer to a MALE person and suddenly we can't make up our minds about pronouns. Couldn't have been a fuck-up. No siree.   Hey, once it was pointed out to be an error I'm more than willing to accept it was an error. It was just circumstantially funny.   If I am mocking you for making a stupid comparison (we are like Matt Walsh because both groups can understand BIOLOGY) and then I make a similar comparison to your stupid comparison (You are like Pat Robertson) and then say ""REKT"", I think it's fair to say that I am not being serious.  I think it's fair to say I am mocking you for being so stupid.   Considering how much your post has grown from the onset, and the word count committed, I'd suggest you're being a bit serious. If you weren't, wouldn't you have dropped it by now? Regardless, as demonstrated, Pat Robertson is hardly a transgender supporter.  inb4 ""well then you're serious too"" as if I suggested otherwise. :P  But realistically, if you're going to make a conjecture that suggests that myself or others are stupid, shouldn't you pick a viable example?"

GenderCynical,2hmf5z,-Enkara-,0,Sat Sep 27 21:23:16 2014 UTC,"One of the TERFs has responded to this comment.    We're not criticizing her for being repressed. We're criticizing her for appropriating an experience she did not have and acting as if her current identity means she did experience it.    wanderingwomb, let's be honest here, you're criticizing him for being trans.   What I think some younger folks might not understand is that the AIDS epidemic affected everyone who was LGBT or questioning and could read or watch the news. Whether we were out or in the closet, everyone of us lived in fear. We all responded differently to our fear. Knowing that gay men were dying in swarms made a lot of us go into denial and repression. The epidemic made us hide what we were. That's why AFlatCap's question is a fair question.   If a repressed gay man were pretending to be straight during the epidemic, then it is the same principle as a trans man pretending to be a woman during the epidemic. According to that TERF way of looking at it, if a man who recently came out as gay were to lament the suffering he experienced during the epidemic, then it would be ""appropriation"" since he appeared to be straight during that time.   But I think we can all agree that just because the hypothetical gay man was faking being straight back then doesn't mean he was actually straight. He was gay back then even if he only came out recently. And similarly, Ackley claims to have been a man back then, even if he only came out recently. That is to say that he internalized the suffering that other men were going through.    The idea here that even those who were closeted (whether gay or trans) had their own experience of the fear and misery of the epidemic, even if those experiences were from the ""safety"" of the closet. (As you can tell from Ackley's chronic suicidality, the closet is not a safe place for trans people.)   And importantly, you're ignoring that Ackley has experienced shame for not doing more during those times. So what do you even think he is appropriating? Survivor's guilt? Quite a strange thing to appropriate don't you think?    If you want to complain about appropriation, then what do you have to say about your own behavior? You said this:    It's almost like she believes older gay men are defined by the 80's AIDs crisis.   As I was coming into my sexuality during the height of the epidemic, it played a huge role in the decisions I made and my ability to define myself. Since you said that you were, according to your own words, ""doing nothing but drooling and shitting my pants at the time"", then who do you think you are to use these events as a means to attack trans people with? Aren't you ""appropriating"" the experiences of others and using them for your own malice?   You'd probably better take Beeebs advice since your behavior here is really indefensible."

I would love to see a thorough anthropological study of people who are forced into this cross-gender behavior and how they turn out in the long run.

How long do you have to be seen as male for you to be a man forever?  Lets not forget that privilege isn't just how you get treated, it's how you view yourself. I don't know a single trans woman that goes through life with the same entitlement and carelessness that most cis men have. How many cis men do you know that have body image issues on the level of trans women or cis women?"
GenderCynical,2h51z1,Jess_than_three,2,Tue Sep 23 04:13:44 2014 UTC,"Yeah. Agree on pretty much all counts.   As an aside, the idea that ""it's a boy/girl"" implies socialization kiiiiiiiiind of directly contradicts their claim that gender assignment isn't a real thing..."
GenderCynical,2h51z1,Freya-Freed,4,Tue Sep 23 04:15:45 2014 UTC,"Here's another one for ya. Do gay people have to be identified as ""gay"" from birth to not have straight privilege? If a gay person is in the closet till say like, 50, does that mean they have had straight privilege all that time?  Or did they maybe start realizing they were gay somewhere along the lines and start internalizing all these harmful messages that society has for gay people?  Let's take a PoC that passes as ""white"" to most people. Do they have white privilege?"
GenderCynical,2h51z1,Jess_than_three,5,Tue Sep 23 04:33:16 2014 UTC,"I'm comfortable saying that for example the latter situation is complex, and that white privilege (like all privilege) manifests in multiple aspects, some of which a person who was seen as white would experience. Does that person ""have white privilege""? Well, no, maybe that's phrasing that's insufficient to discuss the issue, and a more nuanced approach is required.   But we can't have that, right? Of course not. The TERFs believe that Male Privilege is a discrete, atomic thing, that a person has or does not have, and inextricably tied to manhood, which is, in turn, an indelible stain on any person born with male-ish genitals, defining them as The Enemy. So, person is born with a penis, person is A Man, person Has Male Privilege and Is The Oppressor, yes?   Riiiiiight."
GenderCynical,2h51z1,Freya-Freed,3,Tue Sep 23 05:06:32 2014 UTC,"Well that's my point. Being a (cis) man in society is very different from being a trans woman. ""Male privilege"" means a quite specific thing. And while trans women certainly get treated as male for part of their life, they don't internalize quite the same messages. Comparing the situation of trans women to cis men is just completely dishonest and lazy.   These people want their feminism simple. They can't handle that gender and socialization are far more complex then penis = male privilege and vagina = opressed"
GenderCynical,2h51z1,viviphilia,1 point,Tue Sep 23 05:12:28 2014 UTC,"It really bothers me that gender-sex class privilege is the only kind of privilege the TERFs seem aware of. When you start to account for all the various class privileges like economic, race, beauty, height, cis-het normativity, physical and mental health, education and every thing else, it leads to the conclusion that all people are different and that broad generalizations are problematic. Focusing only on gender-sex class privilege erases individuality and lived experiences. And of course that is their goal. By erasing individuality they feel less moral obligation to treat such individuals with respect. That behavior seems like oppression wearing the mask of liberation."

GenderCynical,2h51z1,Jess_than_three,7,Mon Sep 22 19:26:05 2014 UTC,"This is one of the things that just completely baffles me and boggles my mind. On average, how many of these people even know a trans person (that they're aware of)? How big an impact on their lives do they think we have? And like, I get the whole ""Being upset about one thing does not preclude being upset about other things"" thing, but some of these folks focus an incredible amount of time and energy on these issues. Surely there's some better use for their time, some more productive target for their activism? I mean seriously what the hell?"
GenderCynical,2h51z1,javatimes,6,Mon Sep 22 20:22:36 2014 UTC,"yeah, their persistence and obsession with trans people (obviously mainly trans women) does nothing to refute claims that they aren't using radical feminist tenets to prop up their clear transphobia/cissexism.  besides, while it's extremely unlikely, if more than a small percent of a percent of male assigned people started transitioning...i can't imagine how that wouldn't have hugely disruptive effects on systems of male privilege. i mean, what?"
GenderCynical,2h51z1,Jess_than_three,7,Mon Sep 22 22:06:28 2014 UTC,"I completely agree with you. And like, if you're opposed to a structure, I feel like the absolute last thing that you do is to police its boundaries and make sure that its categories are rigidly maintained. The more accepting of transition society becomes, the more fuzzy-edged gender categories get - which makes it that much easier to say ""fuck the whole thing anyway"". Saying ""the categorization of people into classes based on gender the genitals they were born with and/or the way they were socialized (depending on the context I'm arguing in and which is more convenient for me right this second) is terrible and should be done away with but also no you can't be in that category sorry"" just fundamentally doesn't make any fucking sense."

GenderCynical,2gzs1s,mollymollykelkel,5,Sun Sep 21 00:06:47 2014 UTC,"There's so many cringey things in this thread. Let's begin.   That's the scary thing, therapy and psychoanalysis aren't exactly regimented, and therapists are still humans who can have biases, agendas and suffer subjective reasoning.   This isn't necessarily factually wrong, but why the comment about psychoanalysis? Psychoanalysis is really on the decline in favor of more effective therapies (DBT, CBT, etc). Freud is mostly irrelevant in modern psychology, but his historical importance keeps him in textbooks.    My therapists supported negative behavior X.   I'd be curious to see the qualifications of these therapists and if they were actually licensed psychologists. Promoting any substance abuse or self harm is a pretty direct violation of that license. Regardless, generalizing all therapists based on your personal experiences is understandable in some circumstances but eventually you'll have to recover from this and find a therapist that you feel comfortable with. Obviously this isn't the first time GC has generalized.   It is incredibly irresponsible for the person in the position of identifying and treating a mental health problem to approve a physically harmful treatment that is outside of their area of practice.   There is no proof that transition is harmful for all patients. Many people commit suicide while taking SSRIs, does this mean SSRIs should be completely removed as an option? There's also the issue of correlation and causation with the ""proof"" they provide.   Are you suggesting I should re-focus my empathy on the people being paid for what is essentially medical malpratice? Because I don't give a shit how good they feel about shuffling more people through this horrendous system: dysphoric people deserve better.   Ah, yes, what would this post be without an appeal to emotion? These dysphoric people deserve better but I'm still going to misgender them/generally treat them like shit until they accept my ideology without question.   The exact same thing can be said about physicians and medicine.   Fluoride in the chem trail flu shots.   Have you read this? Beebz posted it. Worth a read. Definitely.   There is no need for these constant line breaks. Also the post she's referring to is here. It's basically some choice quotes (some of which use slurs and we all know that makes them oh so credible) that ""prove"" trans people are all evil liars and just doctor/medication shopping."

Fallon Fox has been beaten by better women fighters before (she's not that great of a fighter), but the woman she was facing was much smaller and even worse than Fallon.

They even collaborated with the religious right (another authoritarian group) to fulfill their political goals. They actively encourage making transition legally impossible and eagerly support any legislation if it means trans people result in less ""privilege"" (read as human rights).

Like it's really normal to hear a feminist woman be grossed out about another woman's plastic surgery (my women's studies professor even did it).

I do not agree with the TERF assessment that you are necessarily saying that all TERFs are repressed trans men. For one thing, it would be difficult to cis men on the TERF side to fulfill this. So, no one, I do not think even Jess, is taking that position. Rather, you made suggestions that someone is a repressed trans man based on near TERF-like reasoning, using a conflation of dysphoria and other factors and pseudo-psychological conjecture. If one holds respect for gender identity, this is to be deplored.   And frankly, it seems that the trans people replying to your post were the ones most firmly against you, but I digress. One should not use ""trans people"" and ""people who agree with me"" as synonyms.

It's fairly clear that A_macaroni_pro is wrong in their assessment that the trans community as a whole, especially given that there were at least three trans people actively disagreeing with you in that comment chain. As I pointed out in the post above (in which I did call them out, though you said I have not), it is reflective of classic TERF reasoning, the ability to make vast leaps in reasoning in order to come to the conclusion of ""trans = bad"", regardless of circumstance. A trans person saying something which is disagreeable (regardless of whether it is true or not from our perspective) is seen to be reflective of the transgender perspective, while anything close to agreeable to them is reconstituted as a ploy, as not being good enough, or as being a minority perspective. As for scapegoating you, I don't think we're trying to scapegoat you so much as say that you did something wrong in itself, unconnected to TERFs.    And furthermore, look how far policing me has gotten this community in view of the TERFs. The OP deliberately misgenders me while hiding their previous identity behind their alt account.   None of those people give a shit about your moral high ground. All the self-righteousness from this community has done is create a witchhunt against one of the most dedicated opponents of TERFism.    TERFs going to TERF. The purpose of our moderation policy is not to cater to TERFs or to try and convince them, but to act in a manner which is just. The moderation team of this subreddit, in line with respect for gender identity, have taken the stance that gender identity should not be imposed on any person, be it a TERF trying to deny a trans person, or even in the case here. There is unparalleled importance, an ethical obligation, to respect gender identity, regardless of who you're up against. We should not lower ourselves to the level of TERFs.  As well, being a dedicated opponent to TERFism makes you no more immune to error than being a feminist necessarily does. Both are good positions, but we all have some flaws. It would be wise to remember this.   You're all acting like puppets on the TERF strings and you still don't see it.    If you still have a problem with our moderation policy, I would suggest you take it to modmail from now on."

Dysphoria from depression and gender dysphoria aren't the same thing. The amount BS in that thread is amazing. Unless she's straight up trolling, BetAle has fallen to a new low.  I can't tell if the banned party is legit or not. (If detransitioning worked for you, great, I'm glad you were able to solve your issue.) Trying to lower the suicide rate is good, but I can't help but wonder if the party intends to encourage people to detransition as the only solution to their dysphoria. For some people, detransitioning really isn't an option. That's like saying SSRIs or some particular therapy are the only solution for depression because it worked for you.  Uodate: Apparently the banned party approves of /r/Gender_critical's message. What a shame.

GenderCynical,2ggxxw,mollymollykelkel,6,Tue Sep 16 16:15:21 2014 UTC,"So, I wanted to see what was terrible and wrong in his blog. At first, it was like, okay, dude's experience is what it is, dude is talking about resources for people considering suicide, okay, all good. But then you get down to stuff like this post, where this jumped out at me:   Reader would you like me to send you slides of biopsies from a new vagina with regenerated cellulose so you can see the that they are materially identical to other materially normal vaginas? You could send the slides to any scientist you wish. The same goes for the transudate fluid. You could send it to anyone you want to show is chemically normal vaginal lubrication fluid. Have you looked up metaplasia? How do want to publish the HBS link?  Me I don’t need slides.  I am sure you are right—but you are missing the bigger picture that I am talking about. A “vagina” is organic. The only thing “human made” about it is the fact that two people came together to have intercourse (or a mother chose another method of fertilization).  Beyond that nature takes its course.  There may be abnormalities or defects that need intervention—but it is still a vagina.  Context is what is important here. It is sort of the same thing about why people pay crazy money for diamonds when synthetic alternatives are virtually identical.  Context, “essence” and authenticity matters. So yeah, you can make the argument that a neovagina satisfied whatever criteria you are interested in when you yourself define a vagina.  That does not mean that others have to settle for your criteria as a means of satisfying their criteria for what they define as “vagina”.  Our bodies are more than the sum of their parts.   They are part of a larger story.  Just because this does not interest one person that does not mean that it won’t interest or be VERY important to another.   But yeah TERFs aren't essentialists no ma'am"

Textbook autogynephelia? Sounds like textbook internalized misogyny to me.  That's what patriarchy does to the people it doesn't favor. It makes them feel guilty about liking their bodies. But of course since trans women clearly are the leaders of the patriarchy this couldn't ever apply to them.

If anyone here is struggling with arousal in connection with trans feelings.  It's 100% normal and OK.  It's just something that happens with a closeted identity along with other factors that have nothing to do with you as a person but haven't been fully figured out yet.  Take some time becoming OK with yourself and overcoming shame whether through counseling or just some self-love and that stuff will resolve.

GenderCynical,2gba8f,mollymollykelkel,0,Sat Sep 13 20:09:40 2014 UTC,"I am acquainted with a girl whose parents are Eastern European immigrants. Being rather old and traditional, the father wanted a son not a daughter. So he treated his daughter as if she were a son. It was a deeply abusive relationship. When she went to college she was finally liberated from that oppression and I convinced her to get help for the psychological damage done to her.    I think it is interesting that she sympathized with and even identified with me as a trans woman. I don't know anything about her sex life, but we both wear brightly colored clothes. She told me that having her femme identity repressed by her father was why she wears such colorful clothes. It is a celebration of her femininity.   After that conversation I realized that it is indeed perfectly normal for a trans woman who has been repressed all her life to respond in a hyper-feminine way after she is liberated."

Since when does getting a boner = dripping wet? I hate to be the bearer of bad news, duderess, but that ""sexy feeling"" is you getting horny. That's why it's called a ""sexy"" feeling. It makes you want to have sex.   What? That is literal fetishism. That is fetishizing roles that girls -- young girls, ones that just started puberty or before as they grow body hair -- are FORCED into. Most of us shaved our legs as children because we had to, or deal with the threat of becoming ostracized   Okay, shaving your legs is definitely annoying and patriarchal, but for Christ sake, it's not that bad. No one is holding a gun to your head saying, ""Shave or I'll shoot!"" Just wear pants like a fucking normal human being or only shave when you wear bikinis/shorts/dresses. Or actually make a political statement and not shave at all. You won't find any of these radical feminists doing radical things like that though.  Bonus: I'm a man who doesn't understand female sexuality. It's not really too surprising that she has no idea what I'm talking about.

Also this whole vibe of suffering is essential to womanhood is really weird and wrong.  Like self-esteem within womanhood is possible and I can imagine it could be very harmful to both believe ""I am a woman"" and ""woman can't have self-esteem""."

GenderCynical,2fopz8,Freya-Freed,2,Mon Sep 8 17:10:24 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't say that all of second wave feminism is that. Second wave feminism certainly was important to feminism. Though it still greatly failed trans women and women of colour (Even though some 2nd wave feminists fought hard for better inclusion of both!).  The whole idea of splitting ""sex"" from ""gender"" is a second wave thing, where before sex and gender (roles) were conflated and they still often are used interchangably outside of feminism. Though ""gender"" as defined by the second wave is different from 3rd wave definitions where it would be called ""gender roles"".  Radical feminism stems from the second wave, thought many radical feminists now recognize concepts from the third wave such as intersectionality. Except of course TERFs, who kind of got hung up on hating trans people and basically are stuck in the 70's/80's  Second wave feminism and radical feminism deserve criticism but certainly did some a lot of good for feminism/women (can't stress enough how important it was for the 2nd wave to switch away from just aquiring legal equality into also fighting social inequality)."

But when trans women feel the same need to wear makeup and get cosmetic surgery, the TERFs always stretch for the worst possible explanation.   There is an easy way to explain why trans women have the strong urge to meet feminine beauty standards. It's because trans women internalize the very same socialization which is intended for girls.   I agree that a lot of the pressure to conform to gender standards comes from advertising. In the twenty years I've been aware of that fact, I've persuaded a lot of people to eschew advertising. So it's a shame that instead of working together as feminists to confront this common problem of sexist manipulation in advertising and mass media, that trans women have to defend ourselves from this constant TERF assault against our existence."

Cabals are sometimes secret societies composed of a few designing persons, and at other times are manifestations of emergent behavior in society or governance on the part of a community of persons who have well established public affiliation or kinship. The term can also be used to refer to the designs of such persons or to the practical consequences of their emergent behavior, and also holds a general meaning of intrigue and conspiracy. The use of this term usually carries strong connotations of shadowy corners, back rooms and insidious influence. The term is frequently used in conspiracy theories; some Masonic conspiracy theories describe Freemasonry as an internationalist secret cabal.

Anyone in biology and anthropology can tell you that classifications are a lot more hazy than people might think. Hence the issue with defining certain taxa, for one, but also in this case. Defining ""male"" and ""female"" by genitals is in error, and can only be seen as a simplification. To say that it is an essential definition, especially in the conversational context, is ridiculous. Furthermore, to say ""eh, it's good enough"" as a defense is also ridiculous. To essentialize human sexuality as heterosexuality because it works for a good portion of the population, I assume, is not accepted by TERFs."

But look, it's okay: all you have to do to dismiss the actual complexity of sex is to shout the magic buzzword ""appropriation"". Apparently the fact that intersex people are oppressed by the social paradigm of oppositional sexism means that their existing doesn't actually matter and we should all just pretend that people who don't fit easily into sex categorization systems don't exist - because erasure is better than noting that sometimes intersex people are misassigned at birth and fighting for those individuals' right to live as themselves, too.   But I guess that's radfems for you: the real world takes a back seat to politics."
GenderCynical,2e5gcb,javatimes,3,Thu Aug 21 05:00:12 2014 UTC,"Honestly while I don't think it's appropriation, I think it's unnecessary to bring up (non-trans?) intersex people for these arguments when trans people are plenty of evidence.  But that's just me. :)"

But the transgender movement embraces ""gender"" as concept with some ill-defined alternate usage, and advocate that one's sex must change to be congruent with one's gender, whatever gender means in that context. Again, it's ill-defined.    No, literally nobody - at least as far as I've ever seen - has said anything about what any other person ""must"" do with regard to transitioning or not. And in fact, a fair number of people - especially trans men - transition without any medical interventions of any kind. (I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that this is something you simply didn't actually know.) The whole point is living in a way that's congruent with one's own identity; and there are a variety of social and physiological steps that a person can take, but not every trans person chooses to do every given one of those things.     But defining terms like woman and man on the basis of the genitals a person was born with - now that, I do see an issue with, and I don't think it's the most useful way to define those words.   How do you define those words? Because in English they mean ""adult human female"" and ""adult human male"" respectively, barring in older English when the terms were woman and wereman.    That looks good in a dictionary, but it starts to get a lot fuzzier when you consider that often the definitions for ""female"" and ""male"" point back to ""woman"" and ""man"" - and fuzzier still when examining the actual science of biology, there aren't clear-cut criteria for either term. And again, I think that trying to classify people by genitals (current or at birth), or chromosomes, or whatever else, is less than completely useful - because none of those things pick out all and only the individuals one intends to refer to (even pretending for a moment that trans people simply don't exist), and because none of those are things that people actually know about the incredibly overwhelming number of others they meet or interact with.  But that's sort of neither here nor there, and I guess I'd prefer to stick to fewer topics rather than chase each individual tangent.

But it happens. There are people who feel dysphoric about the gender they were assigned at birth but do not feel any real dysphoria about their bodies and feel no need to do anything to alter them. And it's honestly pretty fucking appalling that you would ignore that reality, to pretend that those people don't exist, in order to push your argument and your ideology.   In that entire paragraph you didn't answer how you define the words ""man"" and ""woman"".   Man: n. An adult human being who identifies as male-gendered.  Female: n. An adult human being who identifies as female-gendered.  However, again let me repeat myself:  But that's sort of neither here nor there, and I guess I'd prefer to stick to fewer topics rather than chase each individual tangent. I hope we can both accept that we don't agree on this subject, at least for the moment.  Because we aren't going to agree on those definitions and frankly arguing about that is distracting from the other issues."

The claim that humans can metamorphose from one sex to the other with plastic surgery and artificially induced hormone imbalances.    Depends how one defines sex. And there isn't a perfect answer.    The claim that there are distinct ""male"" and ""female"" brains and they can come to be in bodies that are the opposite sex.   We know that gender is a human universal. It's not ""intellectually dishonest"" to suppose that there's a neurological capacity for recognizing one's self as a member of one gender or another - nor that it can develop differently from the reproductive organs.

Nobody has made that claim, again, this conflation is itself intellectually dishonest.   Now, sexually speaking? Yeah, I've seen that said.

GenderCynical,2e3gml,wanderingwomb,3,Thu Aug 21 02:48:47 2014 UTC,"Why do you claim there isn't a ""perfect answer""? Humans reproduce sexually and thus are a sexually dimorphic species.   Because that's the position of biologists. Whether you choose genitals (again: at present, or at birth), or chromosomes, or hormones, or anything else you might propose, there are exceptions. There is no standard that effectively covers everybody.   We do? Please define ""gender"".   No, you.  But no, more seriously, rather than get dragged down a rabbit-hole, let me just make my point more clearly. Every human society, extant or historical, has a system of genders. They don't all look identical to ours, but they're very similar - in very much the same way that every human society has language, although some have different structures than others. Notably, every human society has at least two primary gender categories, congruent with what anglophones refer to as ""men"" and ""women""; some have more, but there are none that don't have those two, and wherein those two aren't the most common - and, as you'll certainly agree, correlating strongly to reproductive organs. But let's be clear: correlating to, not congruent with. There are plenty of other societies that have variations on gender transition.  If gender wasn't an inherent thing, we would expect to find at least one society somewhere that didn't have genders at all, and for whom the concept of ""men"" and ""women"" was baffling. We'd expect to find at least one society somewhere that grouped people into classes like genders, but based on some other criteria entirely - age, or height, or who knows what. But we don't. Not one, not anywhere.  So to me, yes, those two facts - the universality of gender systems, and the commonality of individuals who don't fit into them (whether they're people who transition from a gender like ""woman"" to a gender like ""man"" or the reverse or not) - suggests strongly to me that those systems are rooted in an innate neurological structure.   There are several transactivists who advocate the concept of ""brain sex"".   Sure, that's probably true. But look:   The claim that gender identity is neurological in origin does not entail  that the brain is in any other way sexually dimorphic; To argue that the former claim entails the latter claim is intellectually dishonest; To argue that all ""trans activists"" (what even is this but whatever) believe or argue that is intellectually dishonest.    There's a common meme that gynecologists can't tell the difference between a ""neovag"" and the real thing.   Okay, and? That's not the same as the claim that natal vaginas and surgically constructed ones are ""functionally indistinguishable"". Aaaaand again, even with regard to the much more scaled back claim you've just made, to attribute that position to all quote-unquote ""trans activists"" is incredibly intellectually dishonest. Because while I'm sure there are trans people who think that a gynecologist somehow can't recognize a cervix, there are also those of us who are pretty sure that they're trained to do exactly that.   Why is the acknowledgement of biological systems of observable reality ""crapping on"" someone?   This is some neat equivocation, isn't it? As I think I've said, I have no problem really if you want to talk about things like whether or not someone is ""biologically male"" or ""biologically female"" (although I think that those things are a continuous spectrum that you can talk about in terms of a number of different traits, rather than two discrete states). But that's not primarily what your issue is, is it? Because ""biological systems of observable reality"" aren't something that's observable to you on a daily basis; what you care about, AFAICT, are social systems and social realities. And that's a very different question.   Of which very few women who regularly get called a ""TERF"" actually use that term themselves. ""TERF"" is a term that's practically used as a stamp to indicate whose to be vilified and dismissed outright.   Yeah, I feel really bad for people who dedicate vast amounts of time to explaining how the identities of a small minority of people (most of whom they will never meet or interact with) are invalid, because of bizarre ephemeral offenses committed by us against them. I actually cry myself to sleep sometimes.  Speaking only personally, I try not to use the term when referring to individuals, unless those specific radfems have demonstrated clearly that they are in fact transphobic assholes. Which is, you know, actually not a whole ton of people. But that's me."
