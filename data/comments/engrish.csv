engrish,3cdvhw,nickl630,2,Tue Jul 7 03:39:46 2015 UTC,"I can explain this typo...this is probably from Korea. In Korean, the sound ""young"" would be spelled ""영"", where ㅇ is basically an empty sound when placed at the beginning of a syllable. However, for many words, a beginning ㅇ may be replaced with a ㄹ, which sounds like a rolled ""r"" or an ""l"" and retain the same meaning. In this case, someone might spell it ""령"" and thus produce the ""roung"" that you see here.  Bonus knowledge: The ㅇ is considered softer and the ㄹ is considered more aggressive. North Koreans, for example, tend to use the ㄹ in place of the ㅇ for most words, though I highly doubt that this was produced in North Korea if it was actually produced in Korea at all."

His father Bill-Bel convinced the inhabitants to move new Zealand to bellow the sea but and then they used up a large amount of resources to make an underwater city similar to atlantis.  Later Bill-Bel realized that they needed to move to space but the people of new Zealand would not listen to him again, thinking he was a madman.  So because he was so sure that the earth would end tried to save himself by taking the only rocket he had designed. However his wife Lar-Nah and him got into a fight about who deserved to survive from the impending apocalypse. But when they were fighting Mun-Dee had crawled into the rocket and started the launch.  The rocket took of and flew straight through the roof of new Zealand letting a bunch of water flood the city. So Bill-Bel was correct about new Zealand being doomed in a way.  Now the rocket that Mun-Dee was in didn't make it to space and instead crashed near a farm in Australia. There he was raised by his parents thinking that they were his true parents."
