babylon5,3du0zr,dbutlerjr,7,Sun Jul 19 13:36:42 2015 UTC,"Earthgov (or at least Clarke) were working with the shadows, so they were probably advised from the shadows to stay out of the war.  We know this because of the shadow-tech human ships that Sheridan has to fight, otherwise the human ships would've been cake for the White Stars  (this is from memory, so i'm not sure 100% of the details)"
babylon5,3du0zr,skirrame,11,Sun Jul 19 13:45:17 2015 UTC,Earthgov also had a complete news blackout of off world events. That's why when Marcus and Franklin went to Mars to re-establish contact the martians had no idea a war even happened.
babylon5,3du0zr,xabulba,3,Sun Jul 19 13:58:08 2015 UTC,Forgot about that.  Seems like it would be pretty hard to completely ignore though but then again Clark had things nailed down pretty tight after his imposition of martial law.
babylon5,3du0zr,Topazornottopaz,4,Sun Jul 19 14:15:48 2015 UTC,"That would make sense- plus Clark was probably busy consolidating his power.  I guess it was a good thing the Shadow War didn't drag on for too long because then Earth may have been targeted by the Vorlons.  OTOH that would have put Sheridan in an interesting position- having to save Earthgov, which was his enemy at that point, from the Shadow/Vorlon conflict- which might have had an interesting effect in countering Clark's propaganda about Sheridan/B5."
babylon5,3du0zr,Vulcan-Hobbit,4,Sun Jul 19 13:55:26 2015 UTC,"There are several episodes that go into just how much the Clarke administration controlled the media. With all media under their thumb, any actual reporting on actual events would have been pushed to the fringe, so to speak. Anything that was too big to hide could also be spun, via state sanctioned news sources, into another threat that justified the sort of extreme measures being taken by the government.  If they were willing to push the attack on Centauri Prime even after Londo bombed the Shadows, merely because Londo himself was still alive, it seems likely that the planet killer would have eventually made its way to Earth, had things gone differently.  And if it seems weird that Earth played a very minor role in the course of galaxy changing events, well, that's the point. Give power to fascists and xenophobes, and you're unlikely to have the freedom to chart your own course, most especially if that course requires you to put yourself and others in harm's way to defend the very people those fascists and xenophobes hate most."
babylon5,3du0zr,Seanathin23,3,Sun Jul 19 21:36:19 2015 UTC,"In one end episode scene you can see Bester with Earthgov cooperating with shadows, so the Vorlons would come to Earth if it persisted, most likely.  Also in one scene with Franklin and Marcus traveling to Mars Dome the man they are travelling with claims they know nothing of any Great War.  He was under the influence of keeper though, so we can't be sure of how reliable his info was."

babylon5,3dpbh5,Freedom-35,7,Sat Jul 18 04:05:48 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't hate it as much as everyone else seems to have, though I certainly wouldn't call it good or anything... I thought like most back-door pilot attempts that there was plenty of flaws, but I thought I might have saw enough potential to warrant more.  I think my biggest problem with it is the whole The Hand thing... it felt kind of lazy on JMS's part... it's like ""I did this whole series dealing with the Shadows and Vorlons, the ancient, powerful races... the Shadows were the first of the First Ones after Lorien's species... now I want to do this new show, how do I top that? Oh, I know: I'll invent a NEW, even OLDER and MORE POWERFUL species that nobody knew about and failed to mention over the course of 5 years!""... it just seems like a cheat a little bit.  Now, if you actually read up on who The Hand are, it begins to make some sense when you discover it all ties into Thirdspace... and this is the one thing that makes me regret LotR not going anywhere... more about The Hand, and ultimately the Thirdspace aliens, would have been awesome... I'd have to think Lyta had a race memory about The Hand implanted like she did the Thirdspace aliens (though it's quite possible the Vorlons didn't know the connection at the time)... on the other hand, you'd think Lorien could have given Sheridan a heads-up on all of this before he left :)"
babylon5,3dpbh5,fzammetti,3,Sat Jul 18 14:29:23 2015 UTC,"I thought the overall premise of the pilot wasn't bad. First off, we get G'Kar as kind of a wandering mystic/wisecracking guest star. Then the idea of following along the Rangers maintaining the peace of the Alliance, could have tied into the Drakh and Telepath Wars. Plus giving them a crappy little corvette ship made for much better drama than some gigantic OMGWTFBBQ overpowered battleship, at least for this type of story arc.  Everything was just so corny though, from The Hand's mustache-twirling henchman to the silly special effects and the acting was flatter than the shadow vessel that got sucked into Jupiter."
babylon5,3dpbh5,lolzergrush,5,Sat Jul 18 15:57:11 2015 UTC,"As awesome as the Thridspace aliens would be, we would lose.  The Vorlons abandoned the gate for a reason.  Their fighters were one shotting Whitestars."
babylon5,3dpbh5,ActionFlank,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it definitely didn't look good... the Vorlons opened that gate, saw what poured out and said ""Nope, we're done with that!""... that's a pretty bad sign.  But, we lesser races didn't win the second Shadow war through force of arms, and we wouldn't have... we had to use our brains... I suspect we'd have had a shot in the same way.  (By the way, we call the 2260 the second Shadow war generally, with the first being a thousand years prior... but didn't someone, Justin maybe, say the Shadows had done this many times before?  So then how is it only the SECOND war?)"
babylon5,3dpbh5,fzammetti,3,Sat Jul 18 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"It's only the second war for those races that are present at the time of the show. The Minbari actively experienced the Shadow rampage from  a millennium before (i.e., in Earth's 13th century). Humans were not space-faring at the time, and therefore not aware of events at a galactic scale - this probably explains why the Shadows didn't hit Earth, although they passed through the Solar system to seed ships. Since the goal of the Shadows is to incite progress/evolution by kicking over the ant-hill, to borrow a metaphor from the show, it makes no sense for them to hit species that are too primitive and unable to fight back at all - they would just be eradicated.   Presumably, the major players of the galactic scale were not sufficiently developed/space-faring at the time of the Shadow incursion before the one that happened in the 13th century Earth time. We don't even if that took place 2000 years before the show, or maybe even longer ago."
babylon5,3dpbh5,Ryllandaras,2,Sat Jul 18 18:23:01 2015 UTC,"So you're saying its the second Shadow war from the point of view of the Minbari (since they were the only one of the younger races to experience it- J'Quan's tangential involvement notwithstanding) and everyone else involved this time around just adopted that nomenclature since they (and even the Minbari as it happens) just don't know any better?  If so, that makes sense."
babylon5,3dpbh5,fzammetti,2,Sat Jul 18 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's pretty much it :)."

babylon5,3dpbh5,ActionFlank,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:24:05 2015 UTC,"Good point... Lorien clearly played a big role... debatable whether Sheridan or anyone else would have been able to figure out ""what it was all about"" without him... and even if they had, Lorien was the telepathic bridge that allowed Sheridan and Delenn to talk to both sides... and he might have been a ""key"" or sorts besides: would they have even listened even if, say, Lyta had been able to provide the link instead of Lorien?  Or was Lorien's presence an indication to the Vorlons and Shadows that maybe they should listen?  Hmm.  The younger races may have been doomed without Lorien then, and if the Thirspace aliens were that much more powerful - not to mention outright malevolent, which the Vorlons and Shadows weren't - there may have been no real hope.  Though, I'm not a ""there's no hope"" kind of person... I'm definitely of the ""never give up, never surrender"" no matter the odds kind of guy... sometimes you find a way when it seems least possible... but, that attitude of course doesn't make a truly unwinnable fight any less unwinnable, it just makes it a little easier, it just makes the defeat go down a little easier :)"

It did highlight the slightly insane and suicidal nature of the Rangers, I thought. A military force that doesn't allow its soldiers to retreat under any circumstances is ridiculous.  Any of their ships can be goaded into an ambush and everyone who fights them knows it.

It's specifically explained within the context of the story. Remember Lennier's speech from Episode 201?  ""Over the last 2000 years there have been fewer Minbari born into each generation. And those who are born do not seem equal to those who came before. It is almost as if our greater souls have been disappearing.""    Additionally there are multiple times its pointed out the Minbari have not fought a protracted war for centuries. Their arrogance comes from the fact that they have no equal amongst the younger races (remember not even at the height of the Centauri Republic's power did they challenge the Minbari, see In the Beginning). Such power tends to create a sense of superiority of one's culture. Sheridan's actions proved them less powerful than they wanted. So they naturally had to reconcile the difference in ideology by denigrating him and his actions further. While ignoring the truth of the matter.   The simple fact is that people have cognitive disconnects like this all the time about their culture. We all want to believe we are the greatest and dislike it when pesky little examples show up that make us question it. The Newsroom had an interesting example of this regarding American politics."

It's specifically explained within the context of the story. Remember Lennier's speech from Episode 201?   I cannot believe I never noticed this connection before! I've always interpreted Lennier's speech from ""Points of Departure"" as a ""Le Wrong Generation"" moment, i.e. there's nothing really different about the current generation of Minbari, but Lennier is a student of history and is looking at said history through rose-colored classes out of admiration for his ancestors.  But you're totally right—the idea that the moral fiber of the Minbari has been degraded over time is supported by the discrepancy between the Minbari's reputation and their actions. Enjoy your gold."

If Return of the Jedi, Aliens, Avatar, and Afghanistan taught me anything, it's that the plucky, low-tech indigs would grind the war to a halt and ultimately prevail.  If the Minbari lost their taste for war by the time they reached earth, boy-howdy, we sure as hell would have given them a very bitter taste had they made planetfall.      Even if they used mass drivers, they wouldn't have broken us."

babylon5,3de1m2,WasabiSanjuro,2,Wed Jul 15 21:08:02 2015 UTC,There was the scene in In The Beginning of fighting on the ground.  Also its why the took Sinclair on board so they could find out about Earths defences...and of course there was the other hidden agenda as Delenn needed a way to pause the fight [Kosh: The arrow points to itself]
babylon5,3de1m2,RogueWedge,2,Thu Jul 16 07:58:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, thats a Valid point. Why didnt EDF bombed the Minbari homeworlds ? Kinetic missles can be fired from a very long range and nothing is capable of intercepting them. Genocide is a game anyone can play..."
babylon5,3de1m2,nebulasailor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:44:47 2015 UTC,"Presumably, for EarthForce to fire those missiles, they would need to jump to Minbar to get into an acceptable range to pop them off.  Now, let's, for the sake of argument, say that the Minbari can't track and take out the missiles.  That still leaves the problem of getting an Earth fleet to Minbar, which is probably guarded by at least a small task force.  Remember, the Minbari have superior sensors, so you would need to jump pretty far away outside the system just for their early warning systems not to go off.  At that range, though, it would take months, if not years, for missiles to get to Minbar--too long to wait.  So, now you have to be relatively close to the planet, say a week's worth of travel for a missile.  You would have to go deep into the Minbari system, well within their tracking abilities.  How to do it?  If you have a clever CO on the ship (you could only send one at this point), he would take you to just outside the Minbari scanning range and then power down and drift in to look like just another piece of space debris.  The problem, though, is that it would take even longer than just popping off a missile to get to a good firing range, and there would be a higher chance to get caught and destroyed.  That is why Earth decided on bio weapons, presumably.  Bioweapons are easy to use.  However, the kink in that plan was Dr. Franklin, the only Human, at that time, to have notes on Minbari physiology.  Without those notes, Earth can't make a weapon.  No genocide."
babylon5,3de1m2,RedEyeView,2,Thu Jul 16 14:09:31 2015 UTC,It would be like North Korea launching an all out bomber assault on the USA using their Vietnam war era air force.  They be dead before they got off a shot.
babylon5,3de1m2,nebulasailor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:40:40 2015 UTC,Uhm... im not sure if u understand the idea behind Kinetic missles. Basically there is NO range limit.. its a lump of metal fired from a ship so its insanly fast (ship speed+firing speed) it cannot be detected coz of its speed and it will only Accelerate once it reaches gravity well...
babylon5,3de1m2,The_Chrononaut,2,Thu Jul 16 15:36:29 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but you have to remember the insane distances in space.  For it to be practical, it would need to be able to hit the target in a reasonable amount of time.  It just would be too difficult to accelerate it to go so fast and be outside of Minbari scanning range when fired.  Earth would have had to be stealthy to even fire it since it's of no use if you get blown up before you can fire your missile.  The issue is practicality.  Let's do some rough math.  Assume that the Minbari system is roughly akin to the Sol system.  They have early warning systems out past where Pluto would be (7.5 billion km from sun) and Minbar is the third planet and about where Earth is (149,600,000 km from sun).  So, that would mean that the missile must travel 7,350,400,000 km.  Also, you say ""insanely fast"".  Okay.  I would say 0.25c would be pretty ridiculously fast (and probably way outside the reach of Earth's technology at the time).  That would be 269,813,212 km/hr.  That would mean that it would take 27 days 5 hours and 49 minutes from firing to hitting Minbar.  That's not great, but it could work...It's also unrealistic for Earth to accomplish.  Let's try another more realistic speed.  Say 1,000,000 km/hr (and still a bit fast).  Using the same distances, that would be 306 days 6 hours and 24 minutes from launch to impact.  Would you want to wait almost a year to destroy your enemy when they are slaughtering you and fast approaching your homeworld?  Plus, since there would probably be no guidance, it could hit a warcruiser or an asteroid or another planet.  It's just impractical."
babylon5,3de1m2,nebulasailor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:37:54 2015 UTC,"Impractical how so ? Its cheap, easy to manufature, impossible to stop. The War lasted for 2 years,  more then enough to employ such weapons to a devastating effect.  if One faces oblivion one responds in kind. Considering no other weapon system could be used, this one is a godsend.   Aiming- movement in space is very predictable, true a Spaceship might cross the path with missle (splattering the ship) but a planet ? Never, one can toss a lighter in space do some math and return in some time and the lighter will fall straight into your hand.   Speed, tell me why unreasonable ? True B5 universe ships are crawling in space which is kinda odd. But using magnetic catapult can achive wonders, add to that slingshot mechanic (using other planets to accelerate the missle even more) If used en masse it could even be used to wipe out their ships, heavily armed but slow as fuq...   As an afterthought, i dont really understand aiming problems. Minbari never used optical Camuflage (coz Starfuries had no problems tracking Minbari fighters at short range) so it should be very easy to make optical sensors to track them :D"

Once the Minbari starting going after Earth, the EA really didn't know how long it would be until they were on Earth's doorstep.  For all they knew, it could have been a few weeks to a few years.  They really couldn't use a weapon that would, at best, take a few months to reach its target.  By that point, Earth could be gone."

The Centauri want ""the good old days"", yet resort to being petty meddlers in politics. The Narn want revenge on the Centauri, yet are blind to their own potential for atrocity. The Vorlons want to guide the younger races, yet will raze their planets if they are disobeyed. The Shadows want to see races fight and defeat each other, but will mind-control those who stand against them.  The Minbari in particular have a superiority complex (perhaps rightly so given their advanced technology). To them sucking some humans into a jumppoint is akin to us gassing some ants. When the ants turn back at them and fight dirty? Outrageous! How dare they!"
babylon5,3de1m2,freelancer82,2,Wed Jul 15 22:34:47 2015 UTC,"What warcrimes? By their standard, they were on a mission of no mercy and extermination after a human expidtion attacked first and without warning.  We approach with our gunports open as a gesture of strength and respect. boom  Now as Delenn pointed out the warrior caste had no objection about kicking a weaker opponent because they 'know' what the eventual outcome would be [ie minbari wins]; why would they want to take on a stronger enemy (aka shadows) because they would get their collective asses kicked. As for why things went nuts, well they weren't expecting to get their best ship & crew nuked by a weaker foe. Presumable this ship would've held high ranking clan leaders & the best of the best, talent wise it's left a whole & social clan structures would've been damaged and that would've had a flow on effect when you think about the importance of clan structure to the Minbari.  'Underhanded tactics' no just unorthodox tactics. Stealth is just a matter of tech, similar to the us vs english in the war of independence where us were not lined up in bright red squares; and now all military use camouflage. Shooting further than the otherside, hey introduction of longbow in england vs france. It is fair play."

The only reason why I even started thinking about this was because a colleague of mine started watching B5 for the very first time.

He asked why the Vorlons waited so long to make a move, and as we discussed things (which was extremely difficult for me not to reveal anything,) I had that epiphany."
babylon5,3czuis,ActionFlank,2,Sun Jul 12 14:39:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure I'd call it the low path.  Millennia of waging pointless and cyclical war gets old.  In a way, it's a disservice.  The galaxy is so vast, no one can realistically police every planet, so there's a definite logic to removing the threat of upcoming bases.  Also, they weren't promoting discord.  It's more of if you've sided (or one wee portion of a government) has sided with the Shadows, we are going to disappear you.  Obedience.  Bigger issue is where do the PKs stop?  Earth?  Minbar?  Vorlon?!  Then it all ends with us accepting heralds of the Old ones as our lords and opening the Thirdspace gate again."
babylon5,3czuis,ActionFlank,3,Sun Jul 12 10:47:08 2015 UTC,"I feel it was the low path because the Vorlons were just champing at the bit for Sheridan to die so they could unleash hell upon everything.  They couldn't look like the bad guys here, they couldn't look like the aggressors.  I think this is what Kosh meant repeatedly by, ""We are not ready,"" and, ""It is not yet our time.""      The Vorlons didn't need to gather their strength - they needed to gather the moral conviction to murder all of the species that they were meant to protect and guide.  And they weren't consciously promoting discord - that was just a side effect.  When you take the time to manipulate sapient species, even in their nascence, to appear as angelic, godly beings, and then to turn your flaming sword on an innocent people who couldn't defend themselves from the predations of the Shadows, much less anything the Vorlons spat at them, it creates chaos and panic and mayhem.      Here, the Vorlons, be a species that gave the appearance of having no interest in the affairs of mortals, and suddenly and for no reason at all, go on a warpath.  If we remove ourselves from Sheridan's perspective and see this from a ""worm's eye view"" and look at it through the eyes of those who were not part of his war council, the Vorlon's actions would seem completely nonsequitur."

Londo's willingness to nuke an island and almost kill himself shows that the planet killer fear strategy does work to create the order they want (it's still a horrible thing though). However, I think this is the point.  The ideas the Vorlons and Shadows stand for have become dogma over the enormous period of time they have spent as essentially gods over the younger races.  Their crazy strategies that may have once been extreme measures to cause change that reflects their ideas are now used without thinking about the consequences because they see themselves as gods and want easy solutions to their problems."

Back the OP the Commonwealth Saga Pandoras Star and Judas unchained have everything, space battles, planetary warfare, sex, mystery, aliens and complex character development both Alien and human all brought together in a beautifully written (very long) story arc, its well worth a read."
babylon5,3creyr,landdrifter24,3,Fri Jul 10 18:33:20 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware there were more Commonwealth novels out or on the way and I don't think I have read the nights dawn trilogy. I did like The Dreaming Void and The Temporal Void. Not sure if it is a trilogy or not. Apparently I need to just go to the bookstore, get some coffee and browse for a while."
babylon5,3creyr,gzpz,2,Fri Jul 10 18:51:05 2015 UTC,"Yup the void trilogy is a continuation of sorts to Pandora and Judas, i found it hard to get into but fought it and ended up loving that too, as for the new books its set in the commonwealth universe again but not as far into the future as the void triology"
babylon5,3creyr,landdrifter24,2,Fri Jul 10 20:39:32 2015 UTC,This conversation is getting expensive! Looks like I need the last Void novel and all of the new commonwealth things. Thanks. ;)
babylon5,3creyr,gzpz,2,Fri Jul 10 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"Haha! sorry, but in the end it's worth it :)"
babylon5,3creyr,landdrifter24,2,Fri Jul 10 22:04:45 2015 UTC,I am trying to read Pandoras star but it is slow going
babylon5,3creyr,achancesw,6,Sat Jul 11 00:49:39 2015 UTC,"You might like the Old Man's War series by John Scalzi. It's kind of like Ender's Game meets Starship Troopers, but with more emphasis on the 400+alien races all fighting and politicking  for colonizing space."
babylon5,3creyr,madcowbomber,6,Fri Jul 10 05:45:05 2015 UTC,"Not a book, but the Mass Effect game series always sorta reminded me of B5, with all the races and their detailed histories, mingling together on the Citadel and other places."
babylon5,3creyr,Stupid_Ned_Stark,2,Fri Jul 10 18:53:59 2015 UTC,"There are Mass effect books, they are actually pretty good, but me being an idiot ended up reading the last one first, they dont follow on as such but some of the characters are the same so it did spoil it somewhat"
babylon5,3creyr,landdrifter24,4,Fri Jul 10 20:43:41 2015 UTC,"CJ Cherryh has the Alliance-Union universe, which is quite large. Downbelow Station is probably the best place to start.  Here's the bibliography."
babylon5,3creyr,Brotigone,4,Fri Jul 10 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"BWoodward, you really really really need to listen to Brotigone here. Downbelow Station is fantastic. When I read Downbelow Station, I kept thinking ""This is so much like B5!"" Then I realized the book predates B5 by over a decade. It is part of what INSPIRED Babylon 5.  CJ Cherryh created a huge, fully-realized galaxy of war, politics, black markets, labor riots, confounding aliens, realistic relationships and solid storytelling - all the stuff that made Babylon 5 great. Some of her stories are about great leaders, like the Admiral-turned pirate-king Mazian. But most are about regular folks who get caught up in huge historic changes, sometimes triggering them, sometimes swallowed up by them. And the best part is she's been writing these books since the 1970's, so there are TWENTY SEVEN of them already waiting for you to explore.  No no, don't freak out. You don't have to read them in any kind of order. The author explicitly says so. With a couple of exceptions, they can be read in any order you want - new characters, same universe. Downbelow Station is the perfect place to start.   My favorite is Merchanter's Luck, which follows a desperate solo Merchanter Captain just scraping by in a galaxy of enormous superfreighters.  I just discovered these about a year ago, and I've already read 10 of them. They are FUN. They tell grown-up stories that make me feel like a kid again. READ THIS SERIES."
babylon5,3creyr,jasontimesthree,3,Fri Jul 10 22:49:31 2015 UTC,I am so happy to find another CH Cherryh fan! You pretty much said everything I wanted to say. She's such a fantastic author.
babylon5,3creyr,Brotigone,3,Fri Jul 10 23:06:32 2015 UTC,I'm seconding another poster here in recommending a CJ Cherryh series. The Foreigner Universe is a series of 10 books and is a first contact story. I really enjoyed this series. A second recommendation would be The Mote in God's Eye and The Gripping Hand by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Excellent books in regards to Alien culture.
babylon5,3creyr,gzpz,2,Fri Jul 10 16:06:20 2015 UTC,"The Gripping Hand   Thank you. I already recommended The Mote in God's Eye earlier in the thread, but I had no idea they'd written a sequel. I'm going to enjoy revisiting the Moties.  As a side note, you spurred me to google John Christian Falkenberg and discover that Pournelle wrote more than the collection I'm familiar with (comprising The Mercenary and West of Honor) so I indirectly owe you that discovery as well."
babylon5,3creyr,nolo_me,3,Fri Jul 10 19:41:47 2015 UTC,My pleasure. You probably never heard of The Gripping Hand because it didn't come out for 18 years. I read TMIGE in my middle twenties and one day 2 decades later I just saw TGH on the shelf at Barns and Noble. What a happy surprise.
babylon5,3creyr,gzpz,2,Fri Jul 10 19:48:24 2015 UTC,And now through the magic of Reddit and B5 your happy surprise is now my happy surprise. Thanks again.
babylon5,3creyr,nolo_me,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"The Mote in God's Eye was the first recommended book I found so I started with that one. Just a couple of chapters in I was introduced to a character who is an anthropologist, which made me happy. I'm loving the books so far."

babylon5,3creyr,nolo_me,2,Tue Jul 14 02:25:09 2015 UTC,"Harlan Ellison was a consultant for B5, maybe he's a good place to start.   As a more specific rec, try The Mote in God's Eye by Niven & Pournelle."
babylon5,3creyr,spacednlost,2,Fri Jul 10 09:25:13 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid, I was fascinated by the 'Perry Rhodan' series, brought to America from Germany by Forrest J. Ackerman. It's an epic, but I guess you'd have to search used books, because I don't think they got reprinted."
babylon5,3creyr,mrwoolery,2,Fri Jul 10 13:03:19 2015 UTC,"Have you read the fanfiction ""The Dilgar War""?  It is an AMAZING epic novel based in the B5 universe.

babylon5,3creyr,Merari01,2,Fri Jul 10 18:41:13 2015 UTC,"Time Future and Time Past by Maxine McArthur.   A space station where many species live together, a federation of races, enigmatic aliens that are almost god-like, it has a lot that reminded me of Babylon 5.  I didn't think the second book was as good as the first but it does wrap up the storyline nicely and answers some questions about these very advanced aliens that reminded me of the Vorlons, the Invidi."
babylon5,3creyr,Ubergopher,2,Sun Jul 12 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"Have you read Dune? It's not like B5, but it's one of the best scifi books I have ever read."
babylon5,3creyr,Citizen001,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:40:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, I read it many years ago. After Dune I started reading more sci-fi books and although I enjoyed many of them, I seemed to encounter mostly books that focussed on military, war, robots, cyborgs, etc. My personal interests are in the areas of culture, linguistics, history, anthropology, etc. so I'm hoping to find sci-fi books with those sort of themes."
babylon5,3craqd,glvbtmn,9,Fri Jul 10 03:33:34 2015 UTC,"I read that an interview that the main difference is that the last episode of season 4 would have been Intersections In Real Time, with each following episode running as usual but in season 5.   So that means the end of the civil war would have been at episode 3 or 4 of season 5, like the end of the Shadow war was episode 6 of season 4.  I think, from what I've read, the main difference with the original plan for s5 was that the Byron conflict would have only lasted three episodes, instead of eleven.  We would have probably got a little more focus on G'kar and Londo. Personally, my favourite part of s5 is G'kar being a war-weary religious leader so I would have loved that, but I also wouldn't want to lose ""The Deconstruction of Falling Stars"" because I love that episode and I'm glad it happened"
babylon5,3craqd,skirrame,2,Fri Jul 10 10:22:15 2015 UTC,The telepaths were intended to have been introduced toward the end of season 4.

The only thing missing was the Reinforcements Pack #1 and I had to buy the 2258 core set again.  Then, to my surprise, am almost complete reinforcements pack was in the bundle set (glad I went that option) and the few missing tiles were made up with my 2258 core set!   At long last I have everything except the 2258 long box and the reinforcements pack #1 box.  ...now to find people to play it with.  Also, I have a massive amount of the Babylon 5 CCGs - but I now use them as backings for print and play games so I can make paper proxies to use."

The overwhelming feeling of betrayal sits with me because I really loved him from the first episode and now he's doing all this unforgivably evil crap...

babylon5,3cdzdo,Seafroggys,3,Tue Jul 7 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know about a B5 RPG , but there was a superb Freespace 2 conversion called ""The Babylon Project"" . Brilliantly done and has some nicely voice acted missions including a plot where you're an Earth Alliance pilot in the Earth-Minbari war (yes, the famed Battle of the Line is there too!)"
babylon5,3cdzdo,Tachyon1986,2,Tue Jul 7 17:00:16 2015 UTC,so you get to pilot a starfury and then get horribly killed being blown apart by a minbari cruiser? sounds like a great time!
babylon5,3cdzdo,Lexhare,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely correct , stay out of their line of fire and you just might survive till the Battle of the Line. Since this game is based off the FS2 engine , the capital ships have proper beam weapons and other hardpoints and subsystems. There is also another well-written user campaign where you get to play as the leader of a bunch of Raiders. You'll be flying their signature Delta-V craft against the Earth Alliance, Centauri, Drazi e.t.c . Additionally, there is a Shadow campaign too! You get to pilot a shadow fighter attacking pretty much everything besides yourselves."
babylon5,3cdzdo,Tachyon1986,3,Wed Jul 8 03:02:54 2015 UTC,I think it works better as a Civ V kinda game.

Babylon 5 was the last of the Babylon stations. There would never be another. It changed the future, and it changed us.  It taught us that we had to create the future, or others will do it for us. It showed us that we have to care for each other – because if we don't, who will? And that strength sometimes comes from the most unlikely of places.  Mostly, though, I think it gave us hope that there can always be new beginnings, even for people like us."

I had fond memories of it through the years, with no friends who had watched it. Fast forward to 2002 and we got cable and internet, and scifi was running it right after school. I'd watch it every day, but for some reason things were always keeping me from watching the fifth season. the next year I finally found a copy of the whole show and watched it all in 2 weeks over the summer and finally saw it, 10 years after it had all started.

Plus, It's shown that Lorien comes to see Sheridan right before he dies. All three of them, after leaving their human/minbari bodies go beyond the veil with Lorein.  I also believe that they, once beyond the veil, influenced the events of the story. Like they become beyond time. My reasons for this is Kosh always saying 'you have always been here', and the crystalis device that Delenn and Valen/Sinclair use. Delenn got it from the grey council, who got it from the ship Valen/Sinclair was found on (B4). Valen/Sinclair got it from Delenn... continue time loop. It had to come to them from outside of time.   I know that second part is a bit more of a stretch, but considering time looping is a thing in this show I feel like it works."

babylon5,3bu2j7,glvbtmn,28,Thu Jul 2 03:55:28 2015 UTC,"Londo.   G'Kar's change into a spiritual leader is profound, brilliantly portrayed and utterly compelling. But aside from that, so much of G'Kar's story is what happens to him. His dizzying heights and desparate lows are things that occur to him from without. His incarceration, his torture, his people turning him into a prophet, and so on.  But Londo? The things that change most in his story are internal. The thing that changes most is Londo himself. His prejudices, his beliefs, his dreams and desires, his fears. G'Kar changes once, in a profound manner, and has to explore what that means for his old beliefs. But Londo changes subtly, slowly, over the course of the entire show. So much so that by the end, we no longer recognise the man he started out as.   That, to me, is the better arc.  But honestly, I could watch either of them all day. And their individual arcs are so tightly linked that neither could exist without the other anyway."
babylon5,3bu2j7,kithkill,5,Thu Jul 2 08:31:30 2015 UTC,"I was going to say they are so intertwined that you can't separate them, but you have some strong arguments.  Reflecting on it, G'Kar early on was to much a villain that it felt false - you knew he was going to change for the better during the story.  This the change want really that dramatic or a surprise to me - but Londo? His feels like the main sorry arc of the show.   I know, the story is about the forming of the Interstellar Alliance, but without all that Londo did the IA would have been very different or not exist at all.   Moreover, as a tragic character  his actions connected the most with me.   He is a flawed person who makes many decisions he regrets, but through it all he does strive to do better (or at least what he thinks as best).  Most of the other characters only make minor mistakes and quickly recovery, leaving them mostly as good people choosing to do good things.  Londo is more like a Nazi officer who tries to become a good man after his misdeeds.  He is a person who will not get the forgiveness he needs or deserves, partly because those around him will not forgive him but mostly because he will never forgive himself."
babylon5,3bu2j7,mdillenbeck,2,Thu Jul 2 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"The thing that changes most is Londo himself.   And not just once. We see him move from buffoon to monster, and then a saviour of sorts, and then twisted into darkness again in the most tragic way. It's not an arc, it's a rollercoaster!"
babylon5,3bu2j7,DarrenGrey,18,Fri Jul 3 01:07:18 2015 UTC,They are so intertwined that I really consider it to be one and the same.

babylon5,3bu2j7,CountMecha,5,Sat Jul 4 13:20:38 2015 UTC,"Londo. I'll always choose the tragedy over the (relatively, in the case of G'Kar) ""happy"" ending.   What Londo willingly endures near the end of S5 is the best payoff of a character arc I've ever seen. But, it also. made me profoundly sad because we have a character who was never a ""bad guy"" per se, but made some REALLY bad choices... something most of us can relate to... over the first 3 seasons, but then largely redeemed himself by the end of S4... but he STILL got screwed in a way that I consider worse than death or even G'Kar's torture at the hands of Cartagia! What's the sense of being redeemed if THAT'S going to happen?!   Also, Londo's arc had much wider implications than G'Kar's did... I mean, G'Kar definitely had his moments of big impact, but Londo's journey as a whole, his choices, affected far more lives on many worlds. At the end of the day, Londo mattered much more to the overall story.   But hey, we're talking about two of the best character arcs ever written in any medium, and they're also very tightly coupled so you could argue they're one... it's like choosing to get a billion dollars or two billion dollars... one might be twice as good in pure value, but that doesn't tell the whole story and either one is going to be unbelievably great!"

babylon5,3bu2j7,Wadsworth_McStumpy,3,Thu Jul 2 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"Londo. G'Kar is a regular story of growth and strength, where Londo is a story of failure and death despite your best intentions in the face of an uncaring universe... Maybe I need to see a therapist."
babylon5,3bu2j7,ReckZero,2,Thu Jul 2 19:18:35 2015 UTC,Man they both had great arc's. G'kar I think. I felt sorry for Londo throughout the whole series.
babylon5,3bu2j7,zomb3h,2,Thu Jul 2 13:19:31 2015 UTC,"While I consider them to be the two best story arcs of the series.  I find Londo's to be a ""better"" story.  Its a story of tragedy and a fall into darkness.  G'Kar's story is going from hate to enlightenment.  I find Londo's more compelling.  I would say they are both well acted and I find G'Kar's the best acted.  Andreas Katsulas was an amazing Shakespearean actor."
babylon5,3bu2j7,naeblis1911,2,Thu Jul 2 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"I choose Londo's.  G'Kar had the some better individual scenes such as his freedom speech to the council, Dust scene with Kosh, elevator scene with Vir and his scene where Delenn opens up about her knowledge of the shadows.  But Londo's arc was more tragic and powerful to me.  G'Kar got to ride around the universe in freedom while Londo was stuck with his keeper."

G'Kar was a bit of a jerk at the start of the series but never went outright ""evil"" like Londo did, making Londo's redemption a bit more significant IMHO.  Londo's ending was heartbreaking."
babylon5,3bu2j7,dbutlerjr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:55:28 2015 UTC,"I'm intrigued that this specific question has always been a major one in B5 fandom. I've always felt that Delenn's story had it all: transformative change, insecurity, a huge mistake in the wake of anger that costs innocent lives, growth into a leader and warrior, and sacrificial love.  And Mira Furlan - well, you had to believe everything she said about the Shadows and the coming darkness for anything in B5 to make sense. Maybe because people focus on the relationship she has with John Sheridan, we never discuss her amazing story arc."
babylon5,3bu2j7,sibB,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:26:30 2015 UTC,I would say G'Kar but the Jesus parallels are laid on so extremely thick towards the end (39 lashes? Seriously?) that his pathos sometimes borders on parody.

Those who are unworthy are crushed. Wrong background, wrong race, wrong class, wrong genes? Tough - you're just no good.  The Shadows ask ""what do you want?"" to determine people's ambition, their ability to grow. This is at least more future-seeking, less judgemental of an individual's past. The Shadows are willing to give you a chance, whilst the Vorlons will try to keep you in your place.  Choose growth! Choose the future! Choose who you can be instead of who you are! At the end of the day, isn't that what you want? :)"

But for example, we see the ships that the Minbari were using 1000 years before B5 and they're exactly the same. If they had fought even one war against someone who could put up a fight between the two Shadow wars, they would've been forced to innovate, just like the did with the creation of the White Star Fleet.  however, in real life conflict is completely unavoidable, and it unavoidably changes you for better or worse, so the Shadows' methods were completely unnecessary  but out of the three questions of the series ""what do you have worth living for?"" is my favourite"

Who likes being told what to do, with no questioning allowed? Who would want to be subservient to an older race whom you had to obey simply because they told you so? The Vorlons as a whole were cold, distant and uncommunicative. Kosh was interested in communicating wisdom, but that didn't seem to extend to his people in general as we saw with his replacement and his government in general.  However, ironically, I think the Shadow philosophy actually does tell you who you are (by making you make awful, hard choices), whereas the Vorlon philosophy would show you what you wanted: freedom, independence and self-determination.   Would I want to BE a Vorlon or a shadow? Probably a Vorlon."

Because the thing I live about B5 is how it builds up the story and background over multiple episodes, seasons even. There are hints given and developments foreshadowed for everything that happens. Then you see first signs, and then WHAM.   I like to think of it in terms of plate tectonics, because I am also a nerd. Nothing seems to happen at first. But there are ancient stories of big catastrophes floating around. Then small earth quakes, then bigger ones, patterns emerge. And before you know it, there are mountains rising and super-volcanoes exploding. Because in the deep, immense forces are pushing around continents."

babylon5,3ajzxz,Captain_Trigg,4,Sun Jun 21 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"That might have affected things a bit. You didn't get introduced to the characters in the right way, you didn't see them grow as much over time. The characters are the heart of Babylon 5, and especially important is seeing the season 1 buffoonish Londo and rage-fuelled G'Kar change into the people they become later."

babylon5,3ajzxz,DarrenGrey,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:19:21 2015 UTC,"I had my issues with season 1 (Sheridan was more to my liking for example), but all the elements you're introduced to contribute to the enjoyment you have of the rest of the show, watching everything piecing up together, elements you thought were useless or simply wouldn't be used further in the story, but were expanded upon, it just feels great.  And not starting a show at the beginning, especially in a genre requiring a lot of world building, is heresy.  Edit: Also confused you with the OP, well, it's still relevant, to him more than to you, but hey, at least you enjoyed it. Still heresy."
babylon5,3ajzxz,ezaruz,14,Sun Jun 21 22:40:52 2015 UTC,"B5 was one of the very first shows (at least that I was aware of) that had a series long arc -- it was conceived of as a 5-year story.  So in context when it was on TV, it was fascinating.  It MATTERED what order you watched the episodes in.    Season 1 was odd ... keep in mind that the actor that played Sinclair was actually having a mental breakdown at the time.  He held it together for a season, but that was the reason for the lead actor switch (though it wasn't revealed until recently).    As the series went on, it became clear that apparently throw-away lines weren't throwaways -- they pointed toward future major plot points.  They hinted at the reasons why characters would make bad but necessary decisions.    And then ... season 4 is the payoff season.  At the beginning of season 4, they were told that there would be no season 5.  So they had to wrap up two seasons worth of plot in one season.  It's jam-packed.  And then ... at the end of season 4, they were told they got season 5 after all.  So season 5 is odd, too -- the major story is resolved, so it contains mostly B-plots that were intended to run parallel to a main story line.  Some major characters left the show, either for story reasons or because of actor career choices.  But the series finale was shot at the end of season 4.    It's flawed art, but it's art.  Radical and epic in conception and like nothing else I'd seen on TV at the time."
babylon5,3ajzxz,localgyro,2,Sun Jun 21 02:23:41 2015 UTC,"After just watching Season five again, it was a lot like season one was for me. Slow and building, with battles starting on many fronts, dark forces moving around the galaxy and a race determined to regain their place among the stars. What was dealt with at the end of season four would be revisited in seasons eight and nine. I could imagine another five seasons with the stories established in season five.  It seems disjointed with a major storyline seemingly wrapping up so early, but I did enjoy season five. Sorry, I can't find the spoiler intsructions on mobile or I'd explain what I really mean."
babylon5,3ajzxz,David_Harrison,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:37:59 2015 UTC,"Season 5 was really an add-on. Season 4 was supposed to go through mid-season 5, then the telepath arc (with Talia & Ivanova instead of Byron & Lyta) was supposed to be a shorter denouement to the series.   But during Season 4, the network that was paying for B5 started going under, and it became iffy as to whether there would be a Season 5. So in order to put a bow on the series, JMS had to pull everything forward and finish the Shadow War and President Clarke's story before hitting 4x22.   Then TBS or TNT picked up the last season of B5, except they'd emptied their magazine. Now JMS had to take what was supposed to be 4-5 episodes of material and turn it into a full season."
babylon5,3ajzxz,Gimli_the_White,5,Thu Jul 2 07:57:12 2015 UTC,I watched it when it first came on TV and re-watch it probably once a year for the last few years and just love it.The drama the realistic characters and science. The episode about the doctors general father and the troops one of my favorite with all the deaths and just harsh reality of war. As deep space 9 rarely killed anyone off babylon 5 was murdering thousands. I love deep space 9 but babylon 5 still up their. Now if Sisko was in charge of babylon 5 omg..
babylon5,3ajzxz,ajac09,6,Sun Jun 21 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"Why do I love Babylon 5?  The story.  And the fact that it has one.  The little details in Season 1 that come back later seasons.  That everything is connected.  I love the characters and their growth (G'Kar, Londo, and Vir grow the most out of all the characters, and it's amazing).  I started watching B5 one summer because Walter Koenig was in it (having been raised on Star Trek, I never gave B5 a shot until then).  Instantly, I fell in love.  I'll never forget the epiosde (Season 4 Epiphanies).  I had no idea what was going on, but I fell in love.  Babylon 5 is the first sci-fi series, I feel, to break away from singular episodes.  There are very few B5 episodes that seem to go nowhere, unlike most ST episodes.  You have to watch them all to get the full story."

babylon5,3ajzxz,milagr05o5,3,Sun Jun 21 09:43:20 2015 UTC,"I love it because I remember the utter sense of dread and foreboding I had when I first watched it when the Shadows were just... well... shadows!  When you just got a few hints here and there, when Delenn was telling them about this race that was old when the First Ones were young... it made them just sound so awe-inspiring and frightening and just awesome!  The Vorlons and the rest of the First Ones had some of that of course, but there was always something different about the Shadows and for some reason I just really was excited deeply by the idea of them... not in an ""I want them to win the war"" sort of way, I'm not evil or anything... I think because I'm such a strong believer in exploring the unknown and pushing the boundaries of knowledge of the universe around us, they kind of represented all of that and added the element of good versus evil, something else I feel very strongly about.  I love it for the attachments I formed with the characters through all their arcs and how there was real emotion when certain events later on happened.  I'm not ashamed to admit, as a 42-year old man now, that I cried a couple of times when I first watched it... and when I watched it again with my wife a few years ago... and yeah, even a few times now as I'm watching it again with my son... and I know I'm going to seriously cry when I watch the last episode again because that's just inevitable.  I love it for the wisdom sprinkled throughout it... there's an old meme (before the word meme existed) that ""everything I learned I learned from watching Babylon 5""... clearly an exaggeration, but damned if there isn't a TON of great life lessons in there if you pay attention.  And of course, I love it or the coherence of the story over five years... hell, even with all the changes and shortcuts JMS had to take he still held it together in a solid narrative.  Sure, there's things you could pick apart, maybe some lose ends here and there, but nothing was left dandling that was major.  The whole thing just holds together beautifully, which very few shows before or since have ever done.  It really is a work of art in terms of storytelling... as a sci-fi writer myself, that strikes a big-time chord with me.  As for why you hate it, it's hard to me to imagine how, especially with how far you've gotten (kudos for not giving up by the way- many people do, especially given the relative weakness of S1)... maybe it's that there's definitely some bad acting in spots and that cheapens it a little sometimes?  Ditto some effects work? (especially if you're watching the DVDs on a modern HD TV, I know watching with my son it looks awful at times)... you definitely do have some really great stuff coming up that might change your mind, but you're really right in the thick of it and if you're saying you hate it now I'm not so sure that's going to change."
babylon5,3ajzxz,fzammetti,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:08:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late response but I felt the same way about the Shadows.  Here was an alien species that had an alien mindset that even affected their starship design.  The first time I saw those beautiful, terrifying Shadow vessels...that was incredible.  The design was both elegant and nonsensical at the same time.  There was no obvious main propulsion.  No RCS thrusters.  They didn't even open jump gates.  They just phase in and out of reality like it didn't matter to them.  So glorious."

I loved how mastery of Newtonian physics seemed commensurate with each species tech level.  Earth Alliance and Narn Regime fighters all were constructed around Newtonian physics and boy it showed.  Their vectors were always straight and required their ships to wheel about in order to change course.  But Minbari and Centauri fighters, pfft, Newtonian whaaat?  We'll just fly around in space like we're birds because we laugh at Newtonian physics."
babylon5,3ajzxz,WasabiSanjuro,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"I love it because it had a story arc that was all preplanned.  I've always preferred miniseries on TV or with comic books to the endlessness of episodic content.  You could see it on shows like Lost and Heroes (beyond season 1) - plot elements dropped without a care and never discussed ask the time, major shifts in directions, characters flip flipping between good and evil to fit this week's ""cool"" story idea.  I loved it because if what they did at the end of season 1 - someone's the ""good guys"" don't always win.  I loved it for what the Vorlons', the Shadows', and Sheridan's side represented ideologically during the Shadow War - it made the struggle more meaningful.  I loved it for showing how easy it is for a fascist state rises and how even ""good"" people buy into it (if you're in the US, think about our country's changes since 9/11).  I loved it because despite many very cringeworthy episodes, the gems spoke to me in a deep in meaningful way.  (I never got into shows I consider vapid, like Friends or Seinfeld.)  I loved it because there are now truly good or evil characters, just produced and antagonists doing what they think is their best option.  I love it because it didn't tell me what to think.  Go back to the first season and think about Soul Hunter - the show presented different views on the gathering of souls, but it didn't say which was right.   This next one can be considered a bit of a spoiler... I loved it despite all the unresolved lose ends because I realized it is tells the story of the founding of the ISA - not Sheridan and Delenn's story.  Heck, if it's anyone's story it is Lando's story.  I love it for the chemistry/story between Lando and G'kar and Lando and Vir.  There are other great dramas involving other characters (and some not so great subplots), but those two are the ones that I perked up when they were developed in an episode.  I loved it because characters developed - they had flaws to overcome and you could see change in them.  I loved it for the graphics and ship designs.  (I watched it when it first was on TV - the graphics now are probably less than ordinary to most.)  Finally, I loved it for the episode * Intersections in Real Time* (16 June 1997, episode 418), an episode about being tortured.  I liked Chain of Command, Part 2 (Star Trek:The Next Generation, 21 Dec 1992, Season 6 Episode 11) - but comparing and contrasting these two I found Babylon 5's episode much more disconcertingly realistic.  There are other reasons, but these are the forest ones that come to mind."

I'm a huge Trek fan and really liked DS9. The Dominion is one of my favourite enemies of all times... I really wanted to ""love"" the shadows as much but I just don't (though the storyline, the whole foreshadowing IS compelling, no doubt at that). What I love B5 the most for are the characters and their development. There is just no one I don't like - at worst I am indifferent - although I had a hard time accepting Captain Sheridan (yes, I liked Sinclair, I was sad that he was gone after just one season). He seemed too smooth in comparison but grew on me over time. The engaging characters have the effect that I even enjoy the episodes that don't have such a great story to tell.  DS9 is kind of the opposite for me. Loved the arc, the characters not so much"
babylon5,3ajzxz,i_wantcookies,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:32:46 2015 UTC,"I like how many perspectives you can view the story from.  It's an epic Vorlon vs. Shadows, Lawful vs Chaotic, it's a coming of age story for humanity (and other species), it's about Gkar & Londo, or Vir and Lenir, or normals vs telepaths, or any number of other perspectives.    It has some of the most layered character development, and is the only show I've seen where  there's character development of a species as a whole.   The struggles of a species are reflected in the struggles of the individual.  I love that events or choices in the story play out with long-term consequences.  This isn't uncommon in more current sci-fi, but was rare for the time.  It still does the best job I've seen of creating a dynamic universe that changes with the actions of the characters."
babylon5,3ajzxz,entropiccanuck,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:29:04 2015 UTC,"Lets see. First off, true character development and growth.

I hope it's the latter.  Or have you just started watching somewhere in Season 2 or 3? That would be a grave mistake! Babylon 5 has a multi-season story arc that spans multiple years. Admittedly it starts a bit slow, but I for one had some really big grins on my face when something that started early in season 1 come full circle in season 4. Seeing the characters grow/develop is what makes this such a great show for me.  There are a couple of ""stand-alone"" episodes here and there, and some of them are really good, but in general you watch B5 for the 4-5 year arc."

However, like you I was trying to spot seeds in this first season - but I just think it won't be as well done as B5."

I'm perfectly okay with non-space sci-fi, like Orphan Black, for example.  I cannot get enough of that show and I feel physical pain because each Orphan Black season is only 10 episodes long.  But Sense 8, the thing that turned me off to it was the heavy-handed LGBT thing going on.  I know that this is important to Lana Wachowski especially in light of her recent transition (which I think is totally awesome, btw.)  But it's just ham-fisted and pseudopornographic.  Cosima, a lesbian character from Orphan Black, once told another character, ""My sexuality is the least interesting thing about me.""  And the show handles that in a very classy manner.  It doesn't feel gratuitous.  It just feels natural, organic, and not exploitative.  Like in Sense 8 where you see a still-sloppy dildo splatter all over the place when it hits the ground after the lovers were done."

So everything you're seeing, all those plot points that relate to his fate, were just pieces of one of many possible threads that could have unfolded. JMS wrote in ""trap doors"" for every character and multiple possible outcomes that could all tie together because the show was basically being written as it was filmed."

If I didn't have nostalgia for the show from watching it with my dad as a kid, there's no way I could sit through the first season now. It's very slow, and now in 2015, a lot of the stand alone episodes are just meaningless, you've seen all the storylines done, especially if you watch stargate as well. The thing is, the real story is 'in the shadows', background stuff, much of which will come back later. The later half of season 1 gets better as well  But season 2 is where it really starts. Season 3 and 4 are the pay off of the show. Both seasons are fantastic and completely make worth the first season.   Season 5 is okay as well, but the first half is really slow (without spoiling anything, they weren't sure they'd get a season 5, and parts of the story were condensed into season 4. This makes season 4 jam packed, but the start of Season 5 slow)"

I am slightly ahead of you, just a few episodes. The complicated layers embedded in the show are mind boggling.   I agree that the alien costumes may be OTT, but they are just the frame, not the painting. The gradual 3D-ing of the characters will see to that.  Babylon 5 is gold."

I've not noticed the close-up thing before, but now you mention I suppose it is true. It could be because the whole series was recorded in widescreen, one of the earlier series to do this, and so they had to be close-up to stop the frame being too wide. It could well be a contributor to the usual complaint about wooden acting in Babylon 5 season 1.  Later on they use wider shots of groups more often, which shows interactions between characters better."

He frequently recasts actors throughout the series, often under heavy make-up, but sometimes not. I have heard that it inspired a lot of loyalty in the cast,  they knew that they could always be recast if killed off. The actor who played Lorien, for example, played at least three different characters."

The variety of characters and personalities in the cluster is really interesting and they touch on so many aspects of society.  You can see characters that had a loved person transition from male to female, one accepting and one not accepting... the difference between accidentally and intentionally misgendering someone. It even briefly shows a trans exclusionary rad feminist.   It has a clear feminist undertone showing the different flavors of misogyny in different parts of world. It also even touches on what privileged means, how just where you were born gives you different levels of privilege.  I think they did various things that were very brave for a TV show. For example, Kala's fiance is a good guy, he loves her and cares about her but she just doesn't love her. Hollywood rarely puts a main character in the position of not loving someone that loves them when that person is a good person. You can see her struggle.  Also how they show birth, I don't think you rarely see a baby's head popping out of a woman's vulva like that. The show has many scenes that are very raw and touching. One of my partners who is a transwoman found the whole show a bit too emotional.  Remember that Delenn was originally going to start as male and then transition through the show as she transitioned to be half human? That's why she has so heavy prosthetics in the pilot episode. That was abandoned because Straczynski couldn't ever find a proper way to process Mira Furlan's voice to sound male. Also one of the Wachowskis is a transwoman. Sense 8 is one of the best portrayals I seen of a transwoman because that's not the gist of her character, just a trait. She's an amazing hacker, that's her core.  My only criticism to the show is that the characters seem to accept their telepathy without much crisis. Maybe it's part of the trait of being a sensate, but I feel that if I was in their situation I would first freak out a lot... ""Oh my god, voices in my head!!!!"" which they show a bit, but only for one or two characters. I think taking the leap to telepathy would be really hard, but let's say somehow I reach that conclusion, I would freak out even more. For example, when the cop and the DJ met, I was really happy to see him test it with a phone call. But after the initial confirmation, for example, I would have tried figuring out its speed... it's faster than telephony as they show an echo, but is it light speed, instantaneous, can they interact with their environment?, is the environment a simulation? is it based on the knowledge of the visitee? for example, if I'm being visited, close my eyes and throw a set of dice, can the visitor see how they landed? I understand that this is a very geeky/scientific approach, but I would expect at least Kala or Nomi to do it. In generally, I would expect more freaking out. People seem to accept the supernatural way too easy in movies and TV. But then again, maybe that's people in general... people believe in all sort of stupid crap, from leprechauns to gods."

babylon5,38viil,Therearefour-lights,2,Sun Jun 14 09:17:29 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for more from JMS. In the end it does come together and is interesting, but the hike there feels like a chore and is mostly uninteresting. The dialogue is clunky and most of the individual character arcs boring. I'm hoping they they take the criticism well for this season and improve upon it the next.  Over all 6 out of 10.   for reference house of cards is and 7.  Orange is the new black 9.

babylon5,38viil,INBluth,3,Sun Jun 7 09:48:10 2015 UTC,"This isn't a purely JMS show.  He teamed up with the Wachowskis (of Matrix fame) for this as he says in this interview:   The way we actually handle the physicality of it was that they wrote [episodes] one, two and three. I wrote four, five and six. They wrote seven and eight. I wrote nine and ten. Then I rewrote their scripts. They rewrote mine."

babylon5,38viil,PurpleFritoPie,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:18:52 2015 UTC,"I remember looking forward to this back when it was announced years ago.  I found the pilot incredibly infuriating. Maybe it's just fatigue after watching LOST but I have no patience that treat lack of explanation as a ""feature.""  Like, why should I watch your show at all if I can't follow what's going on?  I might watch the second episode. Anyone find that it got better after ep1?"
babylon5,38viil,IcarusBurning,3,Sun Jun 7 20:24:27 2015 UTC,Episode 1 & 2 wore the worst for me. After that the theme picks up more and it gets so good you forget how hard 1 & 2 are... it is really good. But it's probably best to do the washing or some needlework during ep 1 & 2.
babylon5,38viil,WhatABiscuit,2,Sun Jun 7 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the critic screener were the first three episodes, but the end of e4 was when the cluster starts to come together. (No pun intended.)  I am constantly amazed by the number of people who expect perfectly birthed shows after the pilot when that almost never happens, even for great shows. Breaking Bad wrecked it all with a pair of tidy whiteys and hush puppies."
babylon5,38viil,zixkill,2,Tue Jun 9 05:57:40 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing.  You know as much as the characters do.  You're learning what's going on along with them.  They are just as confused as you.  That's intentional.  That said.  The first three episodes are pretty slow.  Things start to pick up during episode 4, and really start to get going around episode 8 or nine.  The last two episodes are excellent.  Also realize this is JMS we're talking about and we know he likes his 5-year arcs.  This is no different.  Its' still the first act.  Things don't really get going in B5 until season 2.  I expect the same here."
babylon5,38viil,LtDarien,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:44:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not really buying the comparison to B5. A lot of people hate The Gathering, but I found it a perfect introduction to the universe and the characters. By the end, the premise and harassers were firmly established and I had an idea what to expect.   At the end of the first episode of Sense8 I don't remember the names of any of the characters or have any reason to care about them. Even further, I don't have a clear idea of what each episode could be about that's interesting enough to watch.   I'm not trying to put your opinion down or anything and I'm glad you're enjoying the show; I just wish I were enjoying it as much as I'd hoped."
babylon5,38viil,IcarusBurning,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:36:45 2015 UTC,"The concept was good, but it's very slow. And not much action either."

But it was an excellent start to an excellent show."

babylon5,38ppdg,fzammetti,2,Sat Jun 6 03:44:25 2015 UTC,"I've watched three episodes so far and frankly, I find it awfully tedious.  I don't need car chases and I'm fine with slower-paced shows, but I feel like they're trying to squeeze EVERYBODY into the show when they really don't need to.  I'd have preferred that they start introducing different characters bit by bit per episode rather than having to visit everybody.  And I found the lesbian scene somewhat offensive.     I'm not a prude - if I want to watch porn, I'll just watch porn.  I don't see how dripping-wet dildo that splatters as it hits the ground really pushes this story forward at all.  Orphan Black handled the whole lesbian thing in a much classier manner and I love how Cosima (the lesbian clone) stated, ""My sexuality is the least interesting thing about me.""  So far, based on what I've seen of Sense8, Orphan Black is the superior sci-fi show.  I get it, I get it: Nomi's storyline plays very close to Lana Wachowski's interests since she is a transgendered woman herself.  But that whole story arc is just too sensationalized and doesn't deal with it as organically as I would have preferred.  A person's sexuality is part of their identity but it shouldn't be the only thing that we need to focus on."
babylon5,38ppdg,WasabiSanjuro,2,Tue Jun 16 20:33:35 2015 UTC,"Having watched it all now I think you made a reasonable judgement a little too early... the whole sexuality thing makes a little more sense as you get nearer the end and winds up not being all that offensive or anything like that... I DO still kind of feel like the whole LGBT agenda is pushed a little too much in my face... did we really need TWO non-hetero characters?  Seems a bit much to me... but, the sexuality aspect I think plays into the overall concept pretty well actually.  But, even at the end I don't have much of a different opinion... by the end it was a bit more interesting, enough that I'll watch a second season, but honestly, if it was cancelled right now I don't think I'd feel all that bad about it.    My opinion is it's an okay show that I'll watch but it's not can-miss TV... maybe it will be... Babylon 5 is generally viewed as pretty weak through the first season and then turns into in my mind the best TV show ever after that... if I had to bet I wouldn't bet Sense8 gets anywhere close to that, but it could turn out to be a lot better than it is now."
babylon5,38ppdg,fzammetti,2,Tue Jun 16 20:40:23 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing that I actually found offensive was Nomi and Amanita's sex scene.  It was simply too gratuitous for my tastes.  I'm not turned off by LGBT scenes - I think it's perfectly natural for people to love one another - that's fine.  Orphan Black has a lot of sex scenes, the hetero ones I could live without but ironically, it's the lesbian scenes that are treated with a little more class and while it's important to the story, we're not treated to lovers running to gay pride parades, etc.  It's just a facet of their personality and oh, look, there's something more interesting happening elsewhere, let's focus on that now.   What set the negative tone with me was that sopping wet dildo and the fact that I was eating when that came up.  But like I said, I understand that the repercussions that Nomi faces for being a transwoman plays close to Lana Wachowski's heart and personal experiences.  I just wish that they would have been more clever about it."
babylon5,38ppdg,WasabiSanjuro,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:56:40 2015 UTC,I can appreciate that.  I tend to just kind of shrug that sort of stuff off... it's not turning me on or anything nor do I feel offended... it just is... but I can see where you're coming from for sure and I get how that sort of thing could turn you off to the show as a whole.  Makes sense.

babylon5,38ppdg,HoopyFreud,6,Fri Jun 5 22:53:13 2015 UTC,That review is exactly what I was afraid of. The Wachowskis really feel like one hit wonders with The Matrix. I haven't actually enjoyed anything from them since. And I don't think even JMS can save it.
babylon5,38ppdg,JacksonGuitarguy,11,Fri Jun 5 23:12:57 2015 UTC,"I think Cloud Atlas by The Wachowskis deserves a lot more credit.

Ebert calls it ""one of the most ambitious films ever made"", etc.  It's far from perfect.  But it's not terrible, and it attempts something interesting -- the attempt alone makes it interesting.

babylon5,38ppdg,merreborn,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:15:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but a lot of that was just how brilliant the book was.

I know that the intention is to show the different cultures the characters live in, but keeping track with 8 characters and their separate lives would probably not fly on regular tv, no one would even try to follow 8 different story lines one episode per week.  On demand streaming makes this a truly interesting experience and gives it a chance.  WOW! This series just got really awesome!"

All eight characters have very different things going on in their lives and all the narrative ticks that go along with each (crime drama, telenovela, family stuff), and yet the creators is still able to effectively combine them without clashing too much.

babylon5,38bf49,dbutlerjr,18,Wed Jun 3 03:12:01 2015 UTC,"Can anybody explain it to me?   Lorien caught Sheridan midfall (or literally right after the fall), injured from the nuking of Z'ha'dum. He linked telepathically (a vision of a cave system) with him to find out more about who he was and what he wanted. During this analysis he realized that Sheridan had a piece of a Vorlon, Kosh (who he may have once met). He also realized Sheridan was fighting on the side of younger races and not specifically for the Shadows' or Vorlon's agenda. So, he healed Sheridan.   He then healed him a second time after Sheridan was weakend during the fight with Ulkesh (fake Kosh). There he revealed what he had done on Z'ha'dum. (This time though did not require a telepathic link as Sheridan was made a viable host for Lorien's energy during his time on Z'ha'dum)    As Lorien pointed out, he cannot create life... he can enhance or extend it.   Sheridan was already dead at Z'ha'dum, his live force expired/expended because of the nuclear attack. Lorien simply infused him with a kind of bio-electric energy that kept Sheridan's cells/body going. But the energy was infinitesimally small by universal standards. It could only do such a trick for around 20 years (barring any accidental death by bodily harm) and no more.  As for why there was the metaphysical discussion, it's possible that the energy/lifeforce Lorien was trying to share had a telepathic component. (Much like a Vorlon's ability to break it's consiousness into others). In order to save him Lorien had to have Sheridan stop fighting (die) so he could start the process. While Sheridan was alive (and fighting) his soul/spirit/mind could not accept the lifeforce being transfered. This is why he was stuck between life and death."
babylon5,38bf49,thegenregeek,8,Wed Jun 3 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"One thing that I'd like to add is: Kosh told Sinclair Sheridan to jump, probably hoping/ expecting that Lorien would help him."

Going back to Interludes & Examinations, I do wonder how things might have been different if Kosh had been there.  I wonder if Kosh giving Sheridan a piece of himself as he was dying was intentional in order to help him at Z'Ha'Dum- since he knew that he was about to die himself?  The episode was incredible but there doesn't seem to be any realistic way he (Sheridan) would have still been able to survive (on his own) with what happened but it was left so ambiguous."

The episode was incredible but there doesn't seem to be any realistic way he (Sheridan) would have still been able to survive (on his own) with what happened but it was left so ambiguous.    You have to also realize that JMS was very inspired by writers like Tolkien (amongst many others). So he used a lot of homages in setting up his story. I suspect he wanted it to be a fanboy nerdgasm.  There's also a LOT of subtle background story elements that, at first, appear to be after thoughts. The link I've provided to my past argument is one such point. Without going into too much here, its basically safe to say that Sheridan was literally destined to go to Z'ha'dum at some point. The story is structured, via scifi concepts, that required him to go at some point. It was an immutable fact, or a fixed point in time. Once you consider that then it plays into the idea that Kosh's actions were always intentional... in a A LOT of ways you might not have considered."
babylon5,38bf49,Cragnous,2,Wed Jun 3 05:08:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I never saw that as ambiguous. Sheridan dies at Z'Ha'Dum but there he find Lorien who reanimates him but he can only do so for 20 years. You're right in that there's no way Sherian would have lived, he went there to sacrifice himself by dealing a massive blow to the Shadows, but instead came back with another 20 years to live and a powerful new alien ally."

To make this even more B5 relevant:  That Background!!! it is seen in almost every scene of every episode and I've become somewhat obsessed/fascinated with it.   It's used in basically every scene on B5, it's on the White Star, it is used to cast cool shadows in down-below,  it's even popular on Minbar!! It's everywhere!!! Any idea what was used to make these panels?  I've been considering fabricating something with this pattern to cover a few large windows in my home."
babylon5,386rti,ademnus,2,Tue Jun 2 08:39:09 2015 UTC,"it's cheap and most plastic stores carry it. The B5 sets were largely plastic and painted plywood. They just didn't have the Star Trek level budget. Of course, even Star Trek used this plastic now and then.  B5 always did something I found fascinating, though. In many character closeups they would use a part of the set that had one tone or pattern / texture on the left and another, different one, on the right, framed behind the subject. I picked up on it one day and spotted it in nearly every episode. It was a very nice convention to use and kept otherwise simple sets interesting as backdrops.  example 1  example 2  example 3  example 4  It's not every closeup, nor every scene, but if you know to watch for it now, you'll see it in nearly every episode.

babylon5,385stp,LilianH,3,Tue Jun 2 01:38:07 2015 UTC,"There's a little hinting in one of the Psi Corps trilogy books that Byron was some kind of a conscience for Bester. Bester is pretty much scum who will use his own people as disposable tools if need be, Byron is (supposed to be?) very compassionate and caring about telepaths. I think if they'd have played this up more in the show it would have been a better dynamic.  Instead Byron just looks like a completely insane cult leader with vidal sassoon terrorist hippies. Sucks, I know the actor can do much better, so I put all the blame on hasty writing decisions."

babylon5,385stp,JustPlainSimpleGarak,4,Tue Jun 2 02:24:11 2015 UTC,It's the down side to the 4th season rush. So much of the story was ended due to the writers thinking the series was ending. The 5th season just lacked a lot of the great story lines because of it. Byron was one of those things that should have only been a few episodes but became way too long to make up for it I always felt.
babylon5,385stp,psicopbester,2,Tue Jun 2 06:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'm upvoting your comment, OP.  Byron killed the 5th season of the show for me.  He was definitely trying be a messianic figure in his own right and was more or less a contemporary of Bester.  He was just as bad with the way he interceded on behalf of his ""people"" as Bester was working for the PsyCorp.  Man, I need to rewatch these."

babylon5,385stp,some-freak,4,Tue Jun 2 02:55:51 2015 UTC,That would have just dragged Ivanova down not boosted byron.   Byron may be the worst element of the b5 universe next to the demon in the lost tales

babylon5,385stp,DarrenGrey,2,Tue Jun 2 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"Lyta's development through Byron is interesting though. The telepaths weren't that interesting as a group, but seeing how the others interacted with them revealed a few new things. In particular Sheriden having to deal with troublesome rebels, and Lyta learning the truth of how warped and used she's been. If the Byron arc had been condensed and more thrown in about Lyta's resulting terrorism involvement I think it could have been far more gripping."
babylon5,385stp,DarrenGrey,2,Tue Jun 2 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"I think it was supposed to be Ivanova and Talia. Remember that Talia had her Psi power boosted by Ironhorse. When the actress left, they had to bring back Lyta and get her boosted by the Vorlon to backfill Talia's role.   So Talia would've been the Byron role - the telepath fighting for rogue telepaths and trying to form a colony on B5, while Ivanova would've been torn between her feelings for Talia and her duty."

babylon5,382ekl,leguan1001,7,Mon Jun 1 11:12:26 2015 UTC,"""The End Of The Line"", by JMS, would have been the season finale: Gideon traces the origins of the phantom ship to a top-secret EarthForce base. He learns the Earth Alliance has secretly been experimenting with Shadow technology, in direct violation of Interstellar Alliance policy, since before the Shadow War — and now want to eliminate Gideon to keep their secrets. The origin of Technomage powers is revealed to be Shadow technology organically bonded to living beings, the result of a deal between the Shadows and the earliest Technomages. The first season would have ended with Gideon travelling alone to Mars in an attempt to expose the EarthForce conspiracy, only to be shot and seemingly killed by an Earthforce sniper.    http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Trivia/Crusade"

babylon5,382ekl,Flelk,7,Mon Jun 1 18:29:35 2015 UTC,"But it already is. The Passing of the Technomages (although I may be misremembering the series title), a trilogy of paperback B5 novels produced in the early 2000s, was written from an outline by jms himself. They laid out the Shadow-TM link and focused on Galen struggling with the implications of not only this power bonded to him that was made for chaos and destruction, but the failing of the mages in general. There were 3 trilogies, the above mentioned as well as a Centauri story and a Psi Corps story. They're all worth a read, and the Technomage ones are easily my favorite."
babylon5,382ekl,swiftlikessharpthing,3,Mon Jun 1 18:54:38 2015 UTC,"That was one of the best things about them in my opinion.  Saints don't make for good characters. The technomages had a dark atmosphere and mysterious origins, that's what made them great. Also they had clearly superior technology - as JMS alluded to several times during B5, ""magic"" is just science that we don't yet understand (like a flashlight in the civil war, or a rifle in medieval Europe). There had to be some explanation for why the technomages had such advanced technology and the First Ones were the only race on that level.   It had to be the Shadows. Giving power directly wasn't the Vorlon's style. They manipulated evolution to produce telepaths out of necessity, but the Shadows wanted to plant seeds of chaos and hysteria as part of their overall goal of growth through evolution. What better way than to do that than creating each race's version of ""wizards"" and ""demons""?  It's a great throwback to JRR Tolkien's works, where the Maiar (Sauron, the five wizards, etc.) wielded great powers unthinkable to mortals. As a result of the influence this gives them, their entire world was plunged into tremendous wars that made each race stronger. Much like the wizards, the technomages knew that their ""magic"" was too disruptive to risk using to solve the problems of the lesser races, so they refused to wield it openly except in times of great need (in this case by leaving during the Shadow War)."

babylon5,382ekl,mdillenbeck,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"Well, he has been writing a B5 reboot film, budgeted for $70 million.  WB has the right of first refusal, but after that JMS is free to shop the project around. WB retains the rights to a tv show, but if Netflix were to finance it and put it up for same day theatrical and digital release...    Depending on how feature film is defined in the contract, they could restructure the series as a cluster of films each covering a year or so in the timeline.  They'd be leaving things out but they'd be doing it on a higher level of production scale with new effects.  I have a pipe dream that the movie will happen with the Wachowskis directing.  Considering the longstanding relationship that Warner has had with the Wachowskis up to now, they may be reluctant to pass on such a film and equally reluctant to finance it by themselves considering how that worked out the last time they gave them free reign.   If they were to structure some kind of deal with Netflix so that Warner gets an exclusive 3 month theatrical distribution window and Netflix gets the entire series as well as the extended cut of Cloud Atlas, that would be pretty great."

I don't think either one would do well if it was brought back. The cast members have moved on to other projects, the chemistry is gone, they're all focused on something else now. The sad truth is that show revivals are rarely well-received...and when it happens the die-hard fans get angry and the general audience just laments that ""It was okay, but it was nothing like the original.""  This isn't always the case...Futurama is generally considered to be still just as good, but animation is a different medium. Two of my favorite live-action shows, Airwolf and Arrested Development, were both revived and the new episodes were widely considered inferior."

When you get down to it, Firefly was really just another Space Western with the rag-tag crew and the hot-shot captain formula, but that's what made it so good. It wasn't a particularly creative idea but it proves that any concept can be great if it's well executed, well written, and well directed.  There are a lot of great ideas out there. Joss Whedon is probably up to his ears in scripts that people have sent him and Fox probably has a whole warehouse full of great sci-fi premises. I loved Firefly but it can never be the same if it comes back, let's keep our fingers crossed for what comes next."

babylon5,37wupb,Weyoun2,5,Sun May 31 02:12:24 2015 UTC,I would watch all the episodes in order. While S1 and S2 are not as dramatic as the later seasons there are a lot of good episodes in there give background to the later seasons.
babylon5,37wupb,LilianH,6,Sun May 31 02:22:15 2015 UTC,"If I had to give as streamlined of a rundown as possible, here goes:   Chrysalis. Sinclair recalled. Sherdian Arrives. Rangers.  Refa and Londo conspire. Londo turns to the Shadows. Centauri Emporer dies.  Narn-Centauri War begins. Londo betrays his closet friend.  Sheridan learns of Shadows and trains to fight legends. Night Watch arrives. Fall of Narn. Talia and Ivanova exposed. PSI Corp moves. Sheridan meets the Rangers. Kosh/Vorlons revealed. Keffer dies. The program on Earth accelerates.     Honestly, there's too many arc significant things to offer a decent overview. Season 2 fires on all cylinders to move the story along. Which is mainly, I suspect/argue, the result of a series rethink by JMS following the depature of Michael O'Hare and the series struggles with Season 1.  Keep in mind th B5 Universe was originally planned with 2 series (each having a 5 year plan). Babylon 5, which set up the universe leading up to the Shadow War. Then Babylon Prime, which dealt with the war being fought and won by the forces of light.  Because of the rethink the original timeline for B5 was compressed into Season 2 and midway through Season 3.  Aspects of Babylon Prime were then made into Season 3.5 through 5.  Simply there is a LOT of stuff that you just have to go through in order."

It's something you've never seen done in ANY SF-TV series, and I don't think has ever been done in TV overall. A very daring little story.  Word finally came back from our liaison with PTEN. ""Number one, this is absolutely against the demographics on the show. Number two, no studio or network executive in his right mind would EVER approve this story in a million years. Number three...it's a hell of a story, I love it, let's do it.""   And also, this wonderful quote:  ""The thing about ""Believers"" is that, really, nobody's right, and in their own way, from their point of view, everybody's right."""

Like real, solid, smack people and knock them out balls. Moments like that one at the end of the episode... I get the full impact of it every time. On the one hand I'm like ""Did that just really happen?!"" while on the other hand I'm just really excited to have a show that takes it all the way.   Anywho, thank you for your comments! I am now going to melt away again so that I remain unspoiled. :D"

babylon5,37sot6,RedEyeView,2,Mon Jun 1 10:43:18 2015 UTC,"Old or new? The new one is too manufactured for me to really get into it. I watched it almost all the way to the end and my husband told me the ending. It's mildly -okay- for me. Not a bad show, but not the best story I've seen."

He left things open and up to the viewer to decide. That moment when they puncture the abdomen and some gas leaks out was perfectly done."

For anyone who decides to see it though, just read a synopsis and DO NOT research further! Trust me, you'll WANT this ton of bricks to be a surprise.

babylon5,37lj79,plantlord98,5,Thu May 28 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"They are very different species. The Vorlons appear to have been aquatic based lifeforms initially before taking on an energy-based form. Their encounter suits probably do have some significance culturally (especially as both the Vorlons we encounter look different). The shadow are spider like in appearance and don't have an energy-based body. I can't recall if the Shadows have telepathy or not, but the Vorlons certainly do.  Both races do use bio-organic technology, but it is very different. The Vorlons use sentient vessels which can fly themselves, while the Shadow vessel require a sentient controller or pilot.   The way they use other races is also different. The shadow implant their allies with shadowtech (e.g. the Shadow Mages) while the Vorlon's modify their allies at a genetic level (e.g. the Telepaths).  So I doubt they are linked.  The biggest indicator that they are not the same race however is that they are not the only first ones. There are several other races spread about that are gathered for the final battle and leave with Lorien who are also called First One, but they don't get involved in the guiding of younger races like the Vorlons and Shadows."
babylon5,37lj79,LilianH,4,Thu May 28 14:50:22 2015 UTC,"So, spoilers for a 20-year-old show:  The Shadows are definitely telepathic, but are also vulnerable to it in a way that the Vorlons don't seem to be. They actively jam Lyta the first time they come to Z'Ha'Dum, and make contact with Ivanova's mind when she uses the Machine. They also invade Delenn's mind during that final battle.  It always seemed to me that the Shadows were stronger physically, but not as telepathic, while the Vorlons were psionic powerhouses. Although Centauri weapons made short work of a Shadow, and it took a couple dozen soldiers and another Vorlon imbued with Lorien's essence to kill the second Kosh, so that may be way off."
babylon5,37lj79,Stupid_Ned_Stark,2,Fri May 29 01:52:25 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered if the Shadow don't instead use technology to mimic telepathy. When they are seen together they seem to speak directly with one another rather than use mind speech. I'd imagine a telepathic race would have grown out of using words when telepathy was quicker.  At the same time, the Shadows seem to have a lot of creatures and machines that they use to control people and things. The keeper they put on Londo for example is linked into his body which allows it to communicate directly with him, but a part of it is also linked to the Drakh so it can communicate to its master what Londo is doing. Their creatures (Drakh, Shadow Mages, etc) seem to use technology to communicate rather than telepathy, although you could argue that the Drakh entire is telepathic communication (I don't think it is personally)."

babylon5,37lj79,zixkill,5,Thu Jun 11 14:00:12 2015 UTC,"I can't recall if the Shadows have telepathy or not   The Shadows seem to be ""anti-telepaths"" - it's strongly suggested (if not explicitly stated - I haven't read all the books yet) that the Vorlons created the telepaths specifically as anti-Shadow weapons."
babylon5,37lj79,Targren,3,Tue Jun 9 07:56:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to assume that the Shadows had telepathic abilities, especially when you remember how Ivanova projected herself when plugged into the Great Machine.  They seemed to notice her ""astral projection"" and were moving in on her."
babylon5,37lj79,WasabiSanjuro,2,Thu May 28 17:30:05 2015 UTC,"My understanding:  The Vorlons are naturally telepathic, but the Shadows are not entirely.   The Vorlons created telepaths in all species (except a few) specifically as weapons against the Shadows. Lyta confirms this when she discusses her own role.  My pet theory is that the Centauri are the only species on the show we see that have developed their own telepaths. That explains why they operate differently, and also why some Centauri can see the future. They're physically more advanced, but are a dead culture."
babylon5,37lj79,StumbleOn,1 point,Fri May 29 18:04:10 2015 UTC,"Also, the shadows had to take telepaths just to pilot their ships. They apparently were good at reprogramming humanoids tho."

I expect that they were experimenting, along with Psi Corps, to try and close the vulnerability to telepathic interference."
babylon5,37lj79,Targren,7,Tue Jun 9 07:53:55 2015 UTC,"There is a line from Lorien where he mentions finding both the Shadows and Vorlons ""when they were infant races"". Implying they were separate.  Considering Lorien is the oldest living thing in the universe (at least per his claim) it would seem unlikely that the Shadows and Vorlons were a single race prior to the point he first found them.  Ultimately there's no evidence suggesting they were a single race at one point. Only vague statements about their shared histories in their ongoing war."
babylon5,37lj79,thegenregeek,3,Tue Jun 9 10:14:08 2015 UTC,"They actually explain the encounter suits to a degree in season 2. From 2x16:   Delenn: That is why Kosh cannot leave his encounter suit. He would be recognized.  Capt. John Sheridan: Recognized? By whom?  Kosh: Everyone.    And then, when he leaves the suit to save Sheridon near (at??) the end of the season, this happens.  The theory about the previous shadow war being due to a race split doesn't really make sense because there have been many such wars every thousand years or so."
babylon5,37lj79,misho88,3,Thu May 28 18:06:20 2015 UTC,"OK, I really screwed up here, sorry everyone and thanks for your constructive comments! I really need to rewatch this show"

babylon5,37lj79,TinyCuts,3,Fri May 29 06:05:02 2015 UTC,Actually the Shadows in the Vorlons are not the oldest races in the universe. They are merely the oldest races that have stayed in our galaxy. Other older races have already left.

The Vorlons are a perfect example.  I'm positive he know that he was portraying a sterotypical ""angel"" with the Vorlons. But the stereotypical angel never appears in the bible, (In the bible they have 6 wings, and would probably be fairly terrifying to see). Just one of many examples in the show where JMS manages to pull off something that handled by anyone else would probably fall flat on it's face."

babylon5,36nvix,WazzupMyGlipGlops,13,Wed May 20 19:20:15 2015 UTC,"JMS pitched the entire series bible to Paramount. It had most of these points, along with a changeling in charge of security, the Dominion being the main antagonist, their primary motivation being order, and a large number of others. They turned him down, and then used a copy of it a year later as the basis for creating DS9.  Basically JMS was given a choice - make a case out of the fact that Paramount blatantly stole from him, or do his own show on PTEN. He couldn't do both. He chose to do the show, and we got Babylon 5, but he had to be quiet about it and leave out the major elements that had already been incorporated into DS9."

babylon5,36nvix,PicardX,5,Thu May 21 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"Don't forget:   A character named Dukat - in B5 he was the briefly shown Mimbari JFK, and in DS9 a meglomaniacal baddie (one of the deep ironies is that the two characters could not be more different) The Breen and Vorlon both are 100% mysterious and wear full body suits.  Sinclar becoming Valen, the Mimbari Jesus, and Sisko being the Emmisary, a major religious figure. (Had Michael O'Hare not had to leave B5 due to struggles with mental illness the ""War without End"" story would have been at the end of Season 5 and had a much longer burn) Vorlons and the Prophets messed around with less ""advanced"" species for their own reasons. The Zokolo and The Promenade are the same damn thing. The Prophets and The Pah Wraiths were DS9 standins for the Vorlons and the Shadows both playing a deep and deadly game with each other. B5 and DS9 were major commerce hubs where species from all over would come for dealings both legitimate and illegitimate."
babylon5,36nvix,redditless,2,Thu May 21 03:21:51 2015 UTC,"The Breen/Vorlon connection is something I didn't consider.  Well done!  To add to one of your points, not only did the Prophets genetically tamper, but the Founders (a stand in for the Shadows, like the Pah-wraiths) did as well.  The Jem'Hedar are analogous to all the Psychics, cannon fodder and shock troops.  Again, well done!"

The whole evolution of Ferengi gender rights was pretty fantastic and Berman clearly loosened his cheek-grip on the stick that prevented him from exploring non-hetero romantic interests in TNG.  That said, if they were my children, B5 would be my favorite."

My bad.  For number 8, consider:  The Shadows and the Founders pull back after the war starts going badly for them.  They use the planet of the people who sided with them (Cardassians/Centauri) as a staging ground which results in karmic retribution as they slowly begin to subjugate the populace (Drakh/Weyoun).  It also takes a revolutionary figure (Damar in DS9, Londo and Vir in B5) to purge them from the planet, at great cost to it's infrastructure."

babylon5,36nvix,GhrabThaar,0,Fri May 22 10:00:19 2015 UTC,Its well known that ds9 was a rip off of B5.  WB had access to jms's scripts a year or two in advance.  He's said so himself.
babylon5,36nvix,Anla-shok,7,Thu May 21 04:14:52 2015 UTC,"Before we dust off our pitchforks again, it's worth noting that while Strazynski definitely intimated that he felt they were taking several pages from his playbook, in the same breath he made great efforts to smother the flames of discontent from his fans.  That was one of the reasons they had the actor exchange; Majel featured in a B5 episode and Mumy featured in a DS9 episode.  Further, there are some great things DS9 did that B5 neglected.  Chief among them was an abundance of People of Color in primary roles that were nuanced and eschewed stereotypes.  Sisko and his father and son, Kassidy (a successful black female captain and businesswoman), Keiko (a brilliant biologist, and her two kids) Worf, and Julian Bashir (people often forget his parents were British and Indian).  That's 9 primary roles for people of color, unprecedented in the history of sci-fi.  There's also the numerous black, Latino, and Asian Bajorans you see on the station, as well as two episodes directly contrasting racial issues of the 20th century against ideals of the 24th.  What did we see in B5?  Dr. Huxtable Franklin, (the only person of color with a recurring role) develops a crack stim habit.  This may not be of importance to some, but it was somewhat of a first to see three generations of black men in a loving familial unit (when everyone was talking about the plight of the single black welfare queen in the 90's) on Star Trek.  Guinan, at the least, would be pleased.  The second thing to note about DS9 was gender roles.  A parallel exists between the way Ferengi and Centauri treat women in the initial depiction.  They're both objects for the pleasure of men.  What we don't see in B5 is growth.  In DS9, Ishka (Quark's mother) near-singlehandedly starts a suffragette movement that quite literally leads to a revolution on their home planet.  Whereas all Centauri women are depicted as conniving whores (Londo's two divorced wives and murdered mistress), shrill hags (the wife he kept) or spooky b/witches overcome by their nebulous feelings (aka psychic powers).  Then there was the whole transgender Quark thing (which was supposed to also be a plot point in B5 for Delenn, but ""Mira's voice was too high to be convincing"").  In all, and much like TNG, DS9 furthered Roddenberrys ideals of humanism across -isms.  Berman even relaxed his anti gay stance and gave us four gay kiss scenes (two in the alternate universe with Nerys, one with Dax, and one with Quark) whereas we just had the hint that gay was an acceptable thing in B5 (Ivanova's, uh, dalliance, and the con artist hitting on Zach to get into their psychic recruitment program).  Summarily, DS9 gives us a better hope for a progressive future within cultural themes.  All that said, B5 owns when it comes to larger, philosophical issues.  I'd even go so far as to say it beats TNG on that front.  Sheridan forcing a crucible between the Shadows and the Vorlons beats any tantrum of Picard when confronted by Q.  There's a lot to be thankful for in B5, a brilliantly crafted serial (which hadn't been done before) not the least among these.  But let's give DS9 it's due as well (after all, it's been over a decade)."
babylon5,36nvix,Targren,3,Thu May 21 01:17:35 2015 UTC,"Dr. Huxtable Franklin, (the only person of color with a recurring role) develops a crack stim habit. This may not be of importance to some, but it was somewhat of a first to see three generations of black men in a loving familial unit (when everyone was talking about the plight of the single black welfare queen in the 90's) on Star Trek.   Sorry, but you're reaching to draw that parallel. While Franklin's relationship with his father may be a little strained initially, he still has a secure family unit and his stim addiction is a direct result of his insane work ethic. It's more akin to House's reliance on Vicodin than a crack habit."
babylon5,36nvix,zixkill,3,Thu May 21 03:08:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's no reason except race to compare stims to crack. They're much more like amphetamines. Franklin is a model minority, really, so he gets the model drug habit, one born from his work ethic."

babylon5,36k1ie,Xiuhtec,5,Wed May 20 15:21:27 2015 UTC,You can't come here until you have watched it all.  Casual conversation here will spoil beyond critical plot points.  There are 2 episodes the the entire series that contribute nothing to the story.  All the others have something.  You are not ready to fight legends.
babylon5,36k1ie,bobchin_c,11,Wed May 20 15:32:13 2015 UTC,"Welcome.  You have a wild ride ahead of you.    You should check out the Lurker's Guide,  http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html  It was put together during the initial run of the show.  Just don't read ahead of the episode you've seen. B5 is well known for giving clues for what is coming up, and you should try to avoid spoilers.   JMS was very active on-line during the creation and airing of the show.  The Lurker's Guide has some answers to our questions from him, and some information you won't find anywhere else.   An almost complete record of his on-line interactions can be found at jmsnews.com."
babylon5,36k1ie,ActionFlank,16,Tue May 19 23:37:47 2015 UTC,"As awesome as the Lurker's Guide is, I'd recommend heavily against reading it on first viewing. While it avoids direct spoilers, it compiles a lot of ""hints"" and theories that hundreds of people analyzing every second of every episode worked to come up with, some of which are accurate and there's no way a single person watching normally would consider every one of. Just the Unanswered Questions section can spur you to think in a direction that might lead you to spoil yourself when you put the pieces together on your own too early.  As a small example, Babylon Squared's Analysis section has a spoiler for Revelations in the form of applying tropes to a directorial decision. For a larger one, a friend I watched with during the show's initial run knew the big War Without End reveal ahead of time (when I expressed my shock, he just gave me a sort of ""really? you didn't know that?"" response) just because he kept up with the Lurker's Guide regularly and it had apparently been a popular fan theory for months/years, but I didn't see it coming in the slightest because I just hadn't thought in that direction. I think I got the better experience for avoiding it.  That said, the Lurker's Guide is great on a second/further viewing (or reading through after viewing the entire series) for seeing some of the behind the scenes commentary and Usenet posts from JMS. It's great to realize the full weight of how planned out everything really was. And in some cases how close the calls were when it came to the incredibly late renewal decisions every year."
babylon5,36k1ie,bobchin_c,5,Wed May 20 01:20:34 2015 UTC,"And I still disagree.  Having lived through the initial airings back in the '90s, the Lurker's Guide was invaluable. Joe answered some nagging questions, and gave us insight into the making of the show.   The reveal was certainly discussed in fan forums of the time,  Compuserve, Genii, and a few others, but never on the Lurker's Guide.   It also gives the best viewing order."

I know it's been said many times about what a ""good seller"" the series is on DVD for Warners, so I'd guess WB is holding out for more money to stream-for-free on Netflix or without the customer paying on Amazon Prime. So, it still sells well enough, but sadly just not well enough for WB to invest the money for an HD restoration, damnit."
babylon5,36clgg,FKRMunkiBoi,1 point,Tue May 19 01:41:40 2015 UTC,"What I wish I could tell them is that their DVDs will sell better if they stream it and increase popularity. Look at TNG, it's been on Netflix for a long time now -but they still manage to sell blurays of it. If no one's heard of it because no one's watching and talking about it, no one will know they want to own it forever."
babylon5,36clgg,lcoviello,0,Tue May 19 01:45:28 2015 UTC,"Yep. B5 will gradually fade out unless WB or JMS does something with it. Actually a lot of Standard Definition broadcast stuff will die out over the next few decades.  As much as it pains me to say this, industry experts keep saying that DVD and Blu Rays sales are gradually dying off, and the TNG Blu Rays didn't sell as well as CBS wanted them to and it's looking like the remaining Trek shows will not get restored.  It's sad to see such a great series fading into obscurity, but the reason other properties have done so well over the long term is because the studios have invested in them and done something with them. If it wasn't for the Battlestar Galactica reboot, I doubt I would have ever seen the original series released on Blu Ray (which I got this week and it's awesome!)  The only chance B5 has of getting picked up and dusted off by the studio is to have something new come from it, whether it's a movie, made-for-tv movie, or even a reboot. It was the Trek reboot that got us the TNG Blu Rays. That's just how the studios do business.  It also sucks that there are less than 3500 subscribers to this subreddit."
babylon5,36clgg,FKRMunkiBoi,2,Tue May 19 01:55:21 2015 UTC,"I want to say my feeling on why TNG bluray has not sold well.  The greedy, greedy price.  I'm sorry, but when it first hit bluray I believe it was roughly 150 dollars for a season? ONE season! They are still trying to perpetuate the notion that Bluray is special magic and not simply another digital format AND that certain shows like Star Trek are, because of their popularity, somehow rarer and more valuable. Had TNG been offered at a more humane price akin to other tv seasons on Bluray, it would have sold a lot better. And I know they want to make money but I feel the lessons of Woolworth still stand, that it is better to sell 100 things for a nickel than 1 thing for a dollar. As far as supply and demand go? The demand is its popularity, which was very high. The supply is a digital format on plastic and foil -therefore infinite if the need was there. IMO they made a big mistake with their greed. It's one of my favorite shows ever -but it's decades old and shouldn't be selling for top dollar like that. Also, proliferation of it brings more popularity therefore more sales and more support for the rest of the franchise. TL;DR -they shot themselves in the foot over money."
babylon5,36b6sm,DeltaBlack,8,Sun May 17 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"I'd have to watch it again to be sure, but I believe the part of In the Beginning that you're focussing on doesn't say that the Narn got their weapons from the Centauri. Rather, the Narn are offering to sell captured Centauri weapons to Earth specifically because they don't match Narn weaponry and thus the Narn have nothing to lose because the Minbari will blame the Centauri"
babylon5,36b6sm,brbATF,3,Sun May 17 23:30:48 2015 UTC,"It's the scene after Londo declines to sell weapons to the EA, when G'Kar talks about the Centauri:   When we drove the Centauri from our world after 100 years of occupation, we seized many of their weapons. We took them apart, studied them, learned to turn their own weapons against them and we are willing to sell them to you.   This is where I noticed this."

There may have been certain hurdles or issues that would have prevented the Narn from creating perfect replicas.  It could also have been a cultural preference on several different levels."
babylon5,36b6sm,swampnuts,2,Fri May 29 18:12:05 2015 UTC,"The Narn definitely reverse engineered a lot of weapons and other tech from the Centauri, but I think by the time we see in the series there had been enough time and reiterations that they were sufficiently different.    I can't find any information on it, but I want to say in one of the books (lurkers guide maybe?)  they do talk about the various weaponry used by all the races, and the Narn weaponry most closely resembles that of the human fleets, in particular the large dual laser weapons at the front of the G'Quan class cruisers.  When you see the EA Omega classes, they were equipped with similar energy mine launchers located fore and under the launch bay, just like the launchers on the Narn cruisers, but never shown in use.  In universe, the Narn probably bought, sold, and developed anything they could and strapped it to their ships.  They did for small arms, makes sense they would do it with their big stuff too.  Take what works and bolt it on."

Makes sense, since the Humans and Narns are the two ""lesser"" races of the ""big"" four races (not counting any of the first ones), with the Minbari and Centauri being the two more advanced ones as witness by the Narn-Centauri war during the TV series and the Earth-Minbari war. The lesser was clearly much more lopsided."
babylon5,36b6sm,kengou,1 point,Mon May 18 09:07:24 2015 UTC,"I remember reading years ago that the Narn had a more raider/piratical approach to weapons and ship design. Since they had just shrugged off the chains of oppression they didn't have all the infrastructure in place to fully develop race specific or complex systems. So they primarily used older systems in a clever way to gain the advantage. The two Big cannons on the front of a G'Quan class cruiser was the only weapons that they equipped those ships with after they left space dock for the first time. Every G'Quan's armament was different as each captain was given some basic funds and then told to go privateering (legal pirating) against the Centauri. They would barter, trade, steal and modify whatever they could to outfit their ships from whatever was available, hence why no two where alike in armament.   Another clever feature I had once read was that the G'Quan was too big for any life support systems the Narn had at the time. So the clever Narn put a older but much smaller life support system in nearly compartment on the ship. So if the ship was destroyed the large sections that remained intact could still harbour survivors for a decent amount of time. This was a good basic strategy with the G'Quan cruisers as most of the other younger races didn't have enough firepower other than a armada to effectively vaporize an entire G'Quan, it's immense size played to it's benefit in this regard. At most they could cut through the ship and chop it up into chunks which enabled large portions of the crew to survive. Also because of this extreme redundancy which was carried over to other systems and design structures, the G'Quan was a very tough nut to crack for just about any other comparable class ship from the other young races.   Narns had to build these ships in secret and usually one at a time, so they were extremely valuable to the Narn effort due to their rarity. Mind you, this is all fluff that I read when the shows 3rd season was on the air. So much of it is probably deleted or rewritten."

babylon5,35t5di,mastigia,19,Wed May 13 08:08:52 2015 UTC,"My enjoyment of Season 5 increased when I viewed it as the conflict of the Shadow/Vorlon arc manifesting itself through the Drakh and telepaths. The Drakh, working through the Centauri, are demonstrating that even without the Shadows around there are always going to be those who can be manipulated into creating chaos, while the telepaths, an arguably superior group of sentients, attempt to use this superiority to enforce their view of morality on others, just like the Vorlons. (edit: it's doubly appealing that these new leading forces of passionate chaos and identity-driven order were servants/creations of the Shadows and Vorlons, respectively) The story of the creation of the Interstellar Alliance is simply a continuation of the eternal struggle between order and chaos, and between passion and identity.   These ideas are expressed most intensely in Seasons 2-4, but Season 5's unique contribution is that these conflicts are timeless, and will always pop up even without First Ones and Great Wars. I found that very satisfying and a nice way to end the show."

babylon5,35t5di,Seafroggys,6,Wed May 13 10:56:34 2015 UTC,"There's a bunch of reasons why the first half of s5 is very choppy:  1) They thought s4 was the last season so they wrapped it up as much as they could, leaving only a few threads incomplete to bring into s5. Originally s4 would have had ended at ""Intersections in Real Time"" and wrapped up the civil war plot in early s5.  2) JMS wrote the first few episodes of s5, then cleaning staff at a hotel threw them away and they had to be written again.  3) I believe they had to get the leads back under contract as most thought the show was done, some kind of fuck up meant that Claudia Christian didnt sign back on and her plots had to get rewritten into Lockley and Lyta.  I think there's other reasons too, but I forget. The main point is that the first half is weak, but stick with it for the second half."
babylon5,35t5di,mnlg,6,Wed May 13 14:42:08 2015 UTC,"The first half of S5 is generally horrible (except the CGI, I would say). I like the Psi Corps episode a lot.  What I really liked of S5 was the neat way the two alien guys managed to wrap up their story. It was much neater than it would have been without it. Plus the very last episodes are excellent in various parts. I think this saves the season even though the overall drop in quality is very evident. In a perfect world, S4 and S5 would need to go through some sort of osmosis, S4 is too cramped and S5 starts too slow, but we all know how things went, so let's just say we're lucky to have S5..."

babylon5,35t5di,CheeseNBacon2,3,Wed May 13 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"If you view the series like a book, you might treat S5 as an extended epilogue.

So, season 5 didn't bother me so much, and it prompted me to do a lot of googling and of course this thread in order to find out more of the history of the show. All of it has been pretty interesting, I can't say as I have ever cared enough about a show to look into it to any great depth. This was a story on and off screen, I am really happy with it on the whole."
babylon5,35t5di,ademnus,2,Thu May 14 16:09:57 2015 UTC,"There were several behind the scenes reasons S5 was rocky.  1: The lack of knowing if there would be a 5th season thereby forcing Joe to wrap up story lines in S4 that would've been in S5. For example is original idea was to end S4 on ""Intersections in Real Time"" .  2: Claudia's decision to quit in hopes of getting on Star Trek: Voyager. While she initially denied that she quit, she later came out and admitted it.  3: Joe's notes on S5 being trashed by the hotel maid in Blackpool England when a con.  2 & 3 hit at the same time and really left JMS in a bad place.  For the full story on it  From JMS himself, see this link. http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-8858"
babylon5,35t5di,Comrade_Beric,1 point,Fri May 15 21:40:17 2015 UTC,"2: Claudia's decision to quit in hopes of getting on Star Trek: Voyager   Well that would have made that show a bit better, and at least semi-worth her leaving.  What role was she up for?"
babylon5,35t5di,ademnus,2,Sat May 16 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"I heard it was 7of9. Others here say it was for Highlander (which she did for 1 episode), but Joe and the rest of the cast all say the same thing about the events leading up to season 5.  So I have to go with the truth."
babylon5,35t5di,Comrade_Beric,5,Sat May 16 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"Let me help make sense of it. Season 4 was the end of the series. There were teary farewells and the storylines were sewn up.  Then Turner Network Television bought the show and ordered up a 5th season.  It was terrible. The plotlines were thin, characters were missing or replaced, and the main arcs were really over. It was like ""AfterMash"" if you're old enough to remember that boondoggle. Maybe the biggest offense to me was the replacing of Ivanova with Tracy Scoggin's character. Her acting was wooden, sure, but the worst was how in the first episode she and Sheridan meet as total strangers and suddenly a few episodes later we're supposed to believe they were married at one time. It was absurd. There were a few gem-like moments in that season but by and large it was ill-fitting with the rest of the show."
babylon5,35t5di,GhrabThaar,3,Wed May 13 09:25:23 2015 UTC,"Them connecting her to Sheridan as an ex-wife was an attempt to make her less of an unknown quantity and to help place her in relation to the other characters in the show.  I get why they did it and I don't find her in context introduction that unbelievable.  What I do find unbelievable is that the writers took yet another female character and attached her to Sheridan as a spouse.  How many women has Sheridan married and why do they all have to be critically important?  There are nine main characters of the show in my opinion.  Sinclair, Sheridan, Delenn, G'Kar, Mollari, Ivanova, Lochley, Garibaldi, and Franklen.  Of these nine characters, only three are women, and of those women two are current or former partners of Sheridan.  That's just lazy in my opinion.  They wrote Ivanova, ffs.  They could have done so much better with Lochley than they did.  Edit:  Also, about your timeline with TNT.  You're not entirely wrong.  The thing is, JMS always intended it to be five seasons (It is Babylon Five after all) but when the network told him he wasn't getting a fifth season, he had to make a decision.  Call their bluff, stay the course, and let the season end on a cliffhanger like so many other series, OR resolve the great war by mid-season, cut off the aftermath and fallout, ditch the telepath plotline, and wrap up the Earth Civil War in less than half the episodes he'd plotted for it, just to give some actual closure to the series.  He chose option B.  Then, surprise! he gets his 5th season.  Now what?  That's why the first half of the 5th season was a thin watered down mess with a sub-par cast.  The Earth Civil War was his 5th Season.  The stuff he cut off just wasn't enough to make a full season by itself."
babylon5,35t5di,ademnus,1 point,Wed May 13 14:58:42 2015 UTC,He'd have been way better off if he hadn't fired Claudia to begin with.
babylon5,35t5di,Labfiend,5,Wed May 13 15:04:33 2015 UTC,"Please read my edit.  Claudia, as I understood it, wasn't fired.  She, like everyone else, thought there wasn't going to be a 5th season, so she signed a contract to play in a season of Highlander: The Series.  The only way to come back to B5 instead was to break her contract with them, which is a quick way to get your ass blackballed in Network Television.  Coincidentally, I believe that also ended up being the last season of Highlander."
babylon5,35t5di,mnlg,2,Wed May 13 15:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah that wasn't how it went, from either side. No one was ""fired."" The show ended, everyone moved on with their lives. Suddenly, months after everything was officially over, they got a fifth season out of nowhere. Claudia had already found work somewhere else, so she kept the job she already had instead of gambling on one thrown together last-minute. It was unfortunate, but blame the suits in charge for axing the show early in the first place."
babylon5,35t5di,ademnus,2,Wed May 13 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"From Claudia's book Babylon Confidential   I packed my bags and left the UK. The deadline passed, and by the time I got home there was a fax waiting for me telling me that I was fired from the show. My manager contacted them to see if we could salvage the situation. The producer's reply was that we were ""a day later and a dollar short."""
babylon5,35t5di,mnlg,1 point,Wed May 13 15:26:28 2015 UTC,The suits are why season 4 was as good as it was.  The channel (PTEN) was falling apart and they were only producing 2 shows for that final year.  They pumped up the budget of B5 as much as they were able to so it could end on a bang instead of a whimper.
babylon5,35t5di,john_dune,3,Sun May 17 04:35:31 2015 UTC,"she and Sheridan meet as total strangers   Not really, they do meet coldly and formally, but it makes sense, if you break up harshly and of course if you fight in opposite sides of a civil war, this might happen. However Sheridan does greet her, for the very first time, with a ""It's nice to see you again"". Hints were dropped."
babylon5,35t5di,WasabiSanjuro,0,Wed May 13 09:58:54 2015 UTC,Not very well. Their whole story was ludicrous. That whole season was such a disgrace to the rest of the series.
babylon5,35t5di,mnlg,3,Wed May 13 10:01:09 2015 UTC,"The quality of S5 was less than S4 - I agree.  ""Sheridan/Lochley meet as total strangers"" - No.  ""...and later on we're supposed to believe they were married and this is absurd"" - I don't agree."

No show has been able to achieve this after the star trek/ Stargate franchises died (and all the amazing other shows mentioned here) , whereas the 90s and early 2000s were full of them.   Society at large has embraced the geek/nerd since then due to the rise of technology and the Internet. Some of the biggest shows on TV are fantasy based. It seems like the time is right for space based sci-fi types of shows to succeed,  but I don't see any coming down the pipeline. Where's my Sci-fi?? What happened?"
babylon5,34nwx2,riazrahman,4,Sun May 3 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"I would actually say it's coming back around, but you are right in that it's been a woefully neglected genre overall, particularly these past few years.  For too long, Sci-Fi (sorry, but I refuse to use their ridiculous new spelling) were content to air cooking shows, wrestling, hunt 'dem 'darn ghosts, and pretty much anything else except proper sci-fi. Now though, they are figuring out that for a channel called ""Sci-Fi"" that's probably a bad idea.  I really like Defiance, the third season of which starts in a few weeks. Ascension I also thought was not bad, but unfortunately they pulled the plug on this so it won't be going to a series. 12 Monkeys was pretty damn amazing considering the (very) low expectations I had going in. That might be the best sci-fi show on TV right now.  There's also Continuum which is sadly ending this year, but has been pretty great overall. New unaired shows like Westworld and The Expanse look like they might be interesting, plus Sci-Fi's December miniseries this year is an adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End. Then you've got Sense8, the new Netflix show from the Wachowskis and jms, which I am actually pretty pumped for.  A little further down the food chain you have Extant, which was... ok I guess, and somehow got a second season (probably that Amazon money, which is also the reason Under The Dome is still going, against all probability), and also Falling Skies, another show of less-than-stellar quality that's ending this year. I won't say it's amazing, but it's ok.  So yeah, overall I think it's coming back, slowly but surely!"

babylon5,34nwx2,ActionFlank,2,Mon May 4 00:28:49 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the reply, you brought up a lot of good points about the SyFy channel. I actually prefer their new spelling as it reflects how far away from real SciFi they've gone. But you're right,  it's getting better. 12 monkeys is undoubtedly the best thing they've done in about a decade.  It's definitely my favorite SciFi show on right now.  Defiance is ambitious (it was a really cool idea to build it around an rpg) and does hit in a lot of areas (I love me some Tarr family drama,  and all the other species/cultural development). I had high hopes for falling skies but now just watch to make fun of how bad it is. But I look forward to exploring the other shows you brought up! I agree science fiction definitely still has a niche.   But still, nothing is set in space anymore! I want some intergalactic planetary drama with some badass ships that get into dogfights, a cool station/mother ship as home base, non corny creature/species of the week perhaps, and an overarching season long plot that deals with a major conflict with a big bad. This formula literally sustained several franchises for decades. Are we all just tired of it now?"
babylon5,34nwx2,riazrahman,2,Mon May 4 18:25:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed!   The Expanse looks to be set in space, so that's one to keep an eye on I think.  There's also Killjoys, which seems to be a show about bounty-hunters tracking people on the edge of known space."
babylon5,34nwx2,Sparta2019,4,Mon May 4 18:47:46 2015 UTC,"Society at large has embraced the geek/nerd since then   I think this is actually part of the problem. Back when the geek audience was a niche, sci-fi shows didn't try to grab everyone's attention they just made shows that they knew the true geeks would like.  Now network execs see geeks as the mainstream demographic, and as a result, we get shows aiming for the mainstream audience. It's either canned-laughter-lowbrow-sitcom Big Bang Theory type of mindless entertainment, or generic Syfy channel schlock filling the gaps between shows of actresses' breasts."
babylon5,34nwx2,lolzergrush,3,Wed May 13 03:07:26 2015 UTC,"I think for the moment we are in transition between two different eras; the era where we thought about ""the Future!""TM and where we live in it. Look at TNG now. Tablet computers, touch screen interfaces? That's science fact right now. You can also see the difference between TOS and TNG. In TOS, that transporter made the goofiest noises, and every button Spock presses at his station sounds like something from Wonka's factory. But in TNG computers make more realistic noises when you tap buttons. In short, right now, we aren't really picturing a new future.  That's why I think any good next Star Trek series must take place in the farther future where we can dream again. But right now, we're not dreaming, not the way once we did, and I don't know that people are looking to escape their push button present for a push button future. It was easier in the 60s or even the 80s when the future felt far away and the present looked like Instagram."
babylon5,34nwx2,ademnus,1 point,Sun May 3 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense, thanks for your perspective! I also feel in general we've lost so much curiosity about space since the end of the Cold War, as evidenced (in part) by NASA shutting down their manned missions.  Even private Ventures into space tourism/elevators and such get barely any press,  whereas the Apple watch and Kim Cardasian break the internet.  You're right; we're too busy looking down at what big corporations/celebrities want us to look at on our screens, instead of looking up to space and forward to the future to dream"
babylon5,34nwx2,riazrahman,2,Mon May 4 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"and we are surrounded by touch screens and cool stuff. I think the real next science fiction will be about a future far in advance of our own, to allow us to dream up new technologies again."
babylon5,34nwx2,ademnus,2,Mon May 4 18:14:45 2015 UTC,"Advertising happened. The sci-fi demographic is considered too intelligent to be swayed by advertising, so networks don't want those kinds of shows. That's why everyone has sitcoms and reality TV instead.  I'm a big fan of Agents of SHIELD, but the network pretty much hates it because few to none of those fans stick around for the rest of the crap on the network, so they're pretty desperate to kill it, even though they haven't yet.  Same with Constantine and The Librarians, which both recently got cancelled as far as I know. It amazes me that Sleepy Hollow has been on so long, but it's a pretty simple formula and the last season got pretty bad at the end."

(It's believed, with good reason, that the idea for the show originated with a pitch for B5 to Paramount)  Stargate SG1 (and the later series. But you have to start here.) - More humourous and mostly ground based at the start. But surprisingly entertaining.  Defiance - Newer show and I'm only a little ways into it. But there are some similarities to B5 with regard to interspecies politics. I've liked what I've seen so far.  Battlestar Galactica - A bit depressing. A lot, actually. I like it, but tonally it's quite different and I personally find many of the characters unlikable. Quite engaging once it gets going.   Doctor Who - Not really the same at all. But I like B5 and I like Doctor Who. So here it is.   Firefly - Short lived, but excellent. Similarly flawed but entertaining characters to B5. Skip the movie. (I'm in a minority here, but I absolutely HATED the movie)  Mystery Science Theatre 3000 - Set on a space station, references to 19xx Earth culture, robots. (Ok, so that's a poor description. But it's great if you're sick.)  Red Dwarf - You'll like it or you won't. Very British, very funny. Seasons 2-6 are best. Shockingly, two new seasons are coming. This show started well BEFORE B5.

While it is a different genre than B5 (superheroes), it has the same feel of an intricate and well-crafted story taking place over a long period of time, like B5. The kind of poetic writing that characterizes B5 translates well into the comic book medium."
babylon5,34nwx2,radishknight,1 point,Thu May 7 02:21:34 2015 UTC,"This may be an odd-ball suggestion, but I highly recommend watching Orphan Black.  It takes place in a contemporary setting or a near-future setting.  There are no space ships.  No aliens.  I feel it's one of the best sci-fi shows currently running (and the third season just started) in spite of how subtle the sci-fi part is - and they kind of trick people who wouldn't normally watch a sci-fi show into watching this.      The show starts out with a woman named Sarah who is using a pay phone on a platform in a train station.  Sarah's arguing with another woman on the phone, stating that she's going to change her life around, make enough money, and take custody of her daughter.  The woman on the other line doesn't seem convinced, but while she's on the phone, Sarah notices a woman a dozen yards away from her who's removing her shoes, her jacket, and then places it by her purse.       It's clear that this woman intends to commit suicide but at the last minute, the suicidal woman looks at Sarah...and Sarah sees herself - the woman looks exactly like Sarah, only dressed up and obviously more successful.  But before Sarah gets to say anything, the other woman jumps into the train.    So Sarah, who's looking for a way to score easy money to get her daughter back does the only sensible thing:  she steals her look-alike's purse and...well, you really need to watch this show.    It's not a sci-fi show set in space but this BBC America show is the kind of production that the SyFy network should have been doing all these years.  The show is very compelling, it will keep you at the edge of your seat, and every answer will lead to even more questions.  This is some fine storytelling that you won't regret spending time with."

babylon5,34mp0a,mahanahan,8,Sat May 2 15:37:21 2015 UTC,"One of the things that always bothered me about the Mars scenes on Babylon 5 was that the gravity's all wrong. Mars has a little over 1/3 of the gravity of Earth. People would run differently, you know (also it might not be heavy enough there to prevent bone decalcification, which would be bad, but it's not something scientists are sure of).  There's this other time on B5 when Ivanova and Sheridan talk about a time on Io when she threw someone out of a third-story window. He was okay because he landed in a pool, but Io has an even lower gravity (about half that of Mars). He's probably have been fine if she threw him onto concrete.  So I guess my point is that I hope they address this problem in their new Mars show, even though it's not even something I notice until I think about it.

babylon5,34788d,bright_ephemera,7,Tue Apr 28 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"Kind of an involved reply here....   All of these things lead me to believe that it is quite possible that throughout the era of Shadow wars and Vorlon guidance/reaction that Lorien has been on Z'ha'dum waiting and looking for a member of the younger races to reject the influence of the Shadows and Vorlons.   Things would have been far simpler to define than that...    Remember the Vorlon's knew what the next 1000 years would bring in their war... because Sinclair told them. This means they knew that Sheridan was coming to lead the fight, and that he would have a reason to visit Z'ha'Dum. (Outside of even Anna, as the commander of the Army of Light Sheridan would at some point need to attack and visit Z'ha'dum directly, to ensure victory. See far below, it ties up well and could fit with your theory.)  If Kosh tipped Lorien about that part of the future, then Lorien would have specifically known who he was waiting for (see below), which he could be hinting at when he states he was waiting for someone to talk to.  It's especially likely that the Shadows and Vorlon's still maintained rules for approaching Lorien, even if they didn't actually try any longer. Kosh could have used them (remember Lorien specifically states ""You have a Vorlon inside you"" and ""I think I met him once... long ago"") or, more likely, taken advantage of the Shadow's defeat 1000 years prior to talk to Lorien directly ON Z'ha'dum (see below, again).   I've also always wondered what exactly Kosh meant when he tells Sheridan that his death will prevent him from helping when Sheridan goes to Z'ha'dum...   Now, this all goes back to the Valen's Prophecies (which really weren't).   Kosh knew he was going to die, Sinclair told him. He knew pretty much everything that was going to happen up to (and including) the events of War without End. Not because of any mystical visions or deep insight into things, but because B5 takes place in a 1000 year causality loop:  Major events that happened in the show were made available to the Vorlons before hand via Sinclair's records and memories. They were following a plan that implied they were destined to win that last war and likely the next war. More than that, Vorlon arrogance led them to believe it was absolute destiny... proof they were right all along.   He reacts the way he does because he knows that Sheridan's request would result in his death. After all Sinclair most likely told him what happened. I suspect that he might have doubted/rejected it was true, on some level, and reacted negatively following that moment... when he finally realized his time had come. That is to say: he expected he would have a chance to take/lead Sheridan to Z'ha'dum, in some fashion (see below), before he died. Maybe he thought, like Sheridan and Delenn, that time was malleable and that he could change it. Time ended up being immutable.  Lorien specifically mentions that the Shadows would consistently return to Z'ha'Dum ""every time they're driven off,"" after losing. If this was the cycle, and Kosh (1000 years ago) believed the next cycle of the war would be won by the Vorlons, then he knew that at some point Sheridian would attack Z'ha'Dum to win the war. Introducing the possibility Sheridan would meet Lorien regardless. All Kosh would need to do was ensure victory, by training Sheridan, so he could lead the final attack on Z'ha'dum.  Your theory is definitely possible. It's also possible that it's not quite as planned out or intricate as you suspect. Kosh may have intended to expose the truth of the war after the army of light won in the next iteration. When they visited Z'ha'dum in victory, having driven the Shadows off, with Sheridan naturally meeting Lorien. Meeting Sinclair may have made him realize the war was not going to end and that something else needed to be done to end the pointless, repeating cycle of destruction.   Simply, Kosh wasn't necessarily orchestrating a elaborate plan getting Sheridan and Lorien together to get the Shadows/Vorlon's out of the galaxy, but rather playing his part knowing they would have to meet eventually, in the course of events, and expose the truth to Sheridan and the younger races there, as a by product of training Sheridan to ""fight legends"" and question the three sides of the sword.  Maybe the entire motivation was seeing the reaction of his people to the idea of the destiny Sinclair shared with them. After all somebody, per Sheridan's meeting on Z'ha'dum, had to have a very specific reason think that their way was the only way. (And indications are it was Vorlons...)"
babylon5,34788d,thegenregeek,3,Wed Apr 29 05:51:05 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered the role of the thousand year time loop in preparing Lorien to meet Sheridan, and I think your insight into the possibility that Valen actually pushed the Vorlons into breaking the rules of engagement in the last Shadow War is amazingly fascinating.  Still, Lorien's comment that Sheridan is the ""only one to make it this far"" implies that there have been others who have been candidates for Sheridan's role as the ""nexus"" of the younger races who could plausibly orchestrate the events of Coriana VI. It's completely possible that there were, but the time loop is what allowed Kosh and Lorien to facilitate that happening with the Sheridan iteration. In light of this implication as well, I wonder if the Inquisitor(s) really were sent by the Vorlons collectively to identify leaders for the Shadow Wars or by Kosh more specifically to identify candidates who would be both a ""nexus"" and able to reach Lorien.   All of your comments certainly help make the story much richer and more interesting to me, particularly by making Kosh more of a heroic figure in his own right. Thanks!"
babylon5,34788d,thegenregeek,1 point,Wed Apr 29 08:27:38 2015 UTC,"Still, Lorien's comment that Sheridan is the ""only one to make it this far"" implies that there have been others who have been candidates for Sheridan's role as the ""nexus"" of the younger races who could plausibly orchestrate the events of Coriana VI   To be fair, the exact wording Lorien uses is that he's been waiting ""a long time for someone to talk to"".  That's could imply he had some foresight and was waiting for Sheridan. But it's also vague enough that he could simply have been waiting for anyone who wanted to listen to an ""old man"". Perhaps he thought that some one would be a Shadow or Vorlon?  The fact that he gives no time frame means he might or might not have talked to Kosh 1000 years ago. ( I mean to a few million year old being 1000 years might be the blink of eye). He might have met Kosh 100,000 years ago for all we know.  Again its definitely a plausible fan theory. Definitely fun to debate, much like the R2/Chewy Secret Agent Theory from Star Wars."
babylon5,34788d,Targren,2,Wed Apr 29 19:47:56 2015 UTC,"Didn't Sinclair go back to become Valen before the attack on Z'ha'dum, and Kosh's death, happened? So he wouldn't know about it?"
babylon5,34788d,thegenregeek,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:18:15 2015 UTC,"Kosh dies in the episode Interludes and Examinations (3x15).  They travel back in time in War Without End, Pt1 & Pt2 (3x16 and 3x17).  Sinclair was not there by the time of the episode Z'ha'dum (3x22).  But if you notice I don't claim Sinclair knew about what would happen when Sheridan went there. I only pointed out that he knew Kosh was going to die, and when. That he most likely told Kosh of these events. (After all in the Gathering Special Edition Kosh specifically greets Sinclair as Valen)  I then argued that Kosh (being told the future by Sinclair) might have thought time was immutable (like Delenn and Sheridan did). And that he could alter events to be alive when Sheridan went to Z'ha'dum. Simply, on some level he might not have thought the warning about his own death was real.  No matter how you look at it Sheridan, as the ""nexus"" of the Army of Light, would have every reason to go to Z'ha'dum at some point in the war. There was no way he could not. If not because of Anna being alive, then because at some point he's have to attack Z'ha'dum directly to defeat the Shadows in the current iteration of the war. Since Kosh probably new his name from Sinclair it explains why Kosh acts the way he does in the series. He knows his mission is to prepare Sinclair specifically to ultimately attack Z'ha'dum. He just hoped he would be there at the final battle, despite being told it was unlikely."

Unfortunately, Justin is more or less a non-character who shows up, says enigmatic crap to dodge any questions, and dies. The role could have been filled by ""Anna"" and been exactly the same.  I didn't hate Justin per se, but there's nothing to really hold on to or identify with for him, whereas Lorien is much more prominent and interesting."

The whole thing on the Lurkers guide having Justin as some major player just never made any sense to me.  And ya, I totally agree that Kosh knew Lorien was there and that they had had previous contact. And that Kosh was going against the Vorlon status quo in supporting Lorien in giving the younger races a shot at existing without the old guard, so to speak, hanging around mucking up the works every thousand years or so..."

I certainly did not expect to see a tweet from JMS about my theory when I woke up this morning :)   I think I have to interpret his tweet to mean that the identity of ""the man in between"" is officially undefined, and that the Lurker's Guide quote is thus not a definitive statement.   I also briefly studied French symbolist poetry in college, so it doubly pleases me that he dropped a Mallarme quote."
babylon5,34788d,Targren,2,Thu Apr 30 08:56:00 2015 UTC,"I also briefly studied French symbolist poetry in college   For those of us who didn't, care to tell us WTF it means?   It's not quote Vorlon-depth, but..."
babylon5,34788d,DarrenGrey,3,Thu Apr 30 22:09:16 2015 UTC,"The Symbolist movement, of which Mallarme was a part, very roughly speaking, aimed to create sensory experiences of variable interpretation that lacked definitive narrative. The symbols they created accessed greater truths through the ""systematic derangement of the senses.""   The works of the Symbolists exist to provoke thoughts of an otherwise undepictable ideal. In a related Mallarme quote, he prodded artists to ""paint, not the thing but the effect it produces.""   Thus, if JMS is suggesting a symbolist interpretation of B5, there really is no concrete underlying narrative that exists outside of what the work itself suggests. At the same time, there most certainly is an idealized, undefined narrative suggested by the work that future interpretation, and more importantly, experience, produces.  In non-Vorlon speak, the approach to fan theories derived from the internal source material is that they are all legitimate and need not be consistent with any external guidance provided by anyone associated with the production of B5. On the other hand, none of them can be confirmed, either."

babylon5,34788d,naeblis1911,2,Tue Apr 28 23:30:53 2015 UTC,"An additional thought that supports your theory - Lorien acts as the man in the middle during the final showdown; in fact, he performs an analogue of a ""man in the middle"" hack when allowing the rest of the Army of Light forces to see what Delenn and Sheridan are seeing...  It could also be argued that he stayed behind in our galaxy to mediate between the Shadows and the Vorlons, but I don't think there's any evidence to support that."

babylon5,34788d,DarrenGrey,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:42:32 2015 UTC,"I think Lorien as the man in between makes a lot more sense than Justin. Justin has always been a very lackluster character.   The only problem with your theory I can think of is that Lorien's exact words regarding Kosh were ""I think I met him, once."" That doesn't make it seem like they were in cahoots. However, it's entirely possible that Lorien was simply being coy."
babylon5,34788d,GhrabThaar,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:19:43 2015 UTC,"So I think I had read somewhere that JMS specifically said that Justin was the man in between.  I couldn't find the source in a 2 min search so I cant prove that right now.   BUT, I really like your theory on this, actually I think I agree that Lorien is the better man-in-between.  If Kosh had sent the vision I don't see how it could mean Justin.  (An agent of the enemy)  That, coupled with the fact that Kosh clearly wanted Sheridan and Lorien to meet.    Well thought out sir!"
babylon5,34788d,DarrenGrey,3,Wed Apr 29 15:47:52 2015 UTC,"In the Z'ha'dum page on the Lurker's Guide, JMS said ""Justin is the man in-between...the ""middle man,"" as he describes himself."" I stumbled on this quote this afternoon.  That does directly contradict my fan theory, so I guess that's definitive. However, to take a broader, looser view, JMS has made mistakes in recall before, and frequently he discusses how his characters fight against his desires to direct the plot. Perhaps this instance is one where JMS's mind wasn't quiet enough to hear Kosh's song. Take it for what you will, I think the theory is simply more satisfying."

babylon5,332mia,joelincoln,14,Sat Apr 18 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"First we had Jeff Conaway's fall into substance abuse and eventual death. It mirrored Garibaldi's character arc in season 5 so much except there was no happy ending, only a slow decline to the point where we couldn't recognize him. The worst part is that everyone who knew him said he was a real decent guy, great to be around, he just fell so far that no one could pull him out.  Then there was Claudia Christian's gut-wrenching autobiography...okay, the first half which was a heart-felt confession (not the second half where her publisher made her pad it with 50 pages of name-dropping).  Now we find out about the demons Michael O'Hare was facing. I just saw this on his wiki page:   Straczynski offered to suspend the show for several months to accommodate O'Hare's treatment for his mental health; however O'Hare refused to put so many other people's jobs at risk...O'Hare told [JMS] to ""keep the secret to my grave"", pointing out that fans deserved to eventually learn the real reason for his departure and that his experience could raise awareness and understanding for people suffering from mental illness.   That's really fucked up. The worst part is that not one person on the show was ever really considered a rude asshole like you hear about with a lot of mainstream actors. They were all just decent people that worked their asses off for pay that wasn't enough, just to do what they loved in spite of their personal demons they had to deal with."
babylon5,332mia,lolzergrush,3,Sun Apr 19 01:21:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, I have read from multiple sources that some of the actors called Michael a rude ass and hard to work with. I wonder if the mental problems had something to do with that... or maybe it's some misinformation. Too lazy to look for sources now."
babylon5,332mia,lucius42,5,Sun Apr 19 01:41:06 2015 UTC,"I think working alongside anyone who was schizophrenic and keeping it secret, they'd come across as rude. Claudia didn't pull any punches in her book but she didn't really say anything terrible about O'Hare, just that he hit on female crew members a lot but never over-the-top. And she described plenty of people she'd known over the years as terrible human beings. I think she and Jerry Doyle were with him more than anyone else on-screen...Doyle said he was hard to work but his comments got sensationalized a bit by third parties."

babylon5,332mia,Enriquepollazzo,13,Sat Apr 18 23:42:49 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly.   Nobody else would have blamed JMS for simply asking O'Hare to leave and then doing nothing else.  He went above and beyond the call of duty.  For years B-5 fans speculated about bad blood between him and O'Hare as being the reason that O'Hare left the show.   JMS took the flak from the rumors and just kept his mouth shut as he vowed to do.  I've met at least two schizophrenics in my life who were fine on meds, but fell off of them and then never made their way back.    It is not something you forget seeing happen."

babylon5,332ghn,joelincoln,4,Sat Apr 18 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"The reason it doesn't fit into the four-season story arc was because they didn't know they were going to have a fifth season. The cast literally found out at the wrap party with only 2 episodes left to film, that they had just gotten another season.   In fact the reason they brought in Tracy Scoggins for season 5 was because of that. The producers tried to renegotiate the contracts with the actors at 3 a.m. without their managers while everyone was still drunk, Claudia Christian's manager said hell no so they just replaced her.  I'm surprised more people didn't walk out since now that the arc was over every character was replaceable. Season 5 was still pretty solid. Honestly Crusade wasn't bad either, Captain Lumbergh was great and it was a good concept they just couldn't keep the network suits away."
babylon5,332ghn,lolzergrush,6,Sun Apr 19 03:14:23 2015 UTC,"I liked it too.  In fact, I can say that about season 5 generally, so I'm crazier than you :)  I didn't like Lockley all that much, but her aside I thought there were more good episodes than bad, and a few great ones mixed in (towards the tail end).  The telepath arc has a lot going for it and I wish there had been more time to fully explore it.  So no, you're not alone :)"

babylon5,332ghn,GhrabThaar,2,Sat Apr 18 22:58:11 2015 UTC,"I wasn't crazy about it but I don't loathe it either.  It's still part of the storyline and it's still B5, which is/was a good show even at its weakest.  It is too bad that the IA couldn't have helped more in terms of finding the telepaths a home.  The Vorlons were instrumental in producing Telepaths for the Shadow War and then abandoned them and everybody knows how oppressive the Psi Corps is/was.  Unfortunately, Byron made some tactical errors in response to the Vorlon revelation and some of his followers turned too quickly to violence. My favorite part of S5 is the latter half of the season with the Centauri crisis and the conclusion of the series."

babylon5,32w2ug,jonathan2260,6,Fri Apr 17 04:45:37 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone.  This is my 1st time on this subreddit and thought it would be worth showing these to fans here. These are not officially licensed pins, they were made locally in my city by a guy many years ago when the show was still playing and the person made a limited set of a couple hundreds of these I think. The set didn't include the Earth Alliance badge, star fury or B5 station that you see in the picture. I bought those from that same person and added it to the collection. It made it seem more complete to me.  I'm wondering if people feel they are worth anything today and if so how much? No I am not interested in selling them, I'm still a fan but I'm actually curious if it has any worth considering that it's not an official collection."
babylon5,32w2ug,monkeyordonkey,7,Fri Apr 17 04:46:41 2015 UTC,"Given that they aren't official, I'd guess that the monetary value is low. On the plus side, they are frickin' awesome, so there's that."

He had also made a Psycorps badge but I didn't want one at the time since I hated them. These days I would have probably taken one to make the set look more complete but I'm not regretting not having taken one.  One of the reasons they look good was because the person was working in the industry making pins so he had access to decent equipment from his employer and that made for quality looking pins. I recall him mentioning how it was helping him to his employer since he was bringing in business in that way. :)"

babylon5,32l79m,kengou,5,Tue Apr 14 18:00:18 2015 UTC,"Any idea why the Excalibur uniform is different from even contemporary Earthforce uniforms?    It's probably because the Excalibur crew come from the Explorers section/division of Earthforce. This isn't Earthforce proper, or rather Gideon's crew isn't a combat division. Its an armed forces special division not tasked with combat duties, but rather scientific and diplomatic exploration.  I would imagine the Explorer's group functions a bit more like the US Coast Guard ( or other Noncombat Uniformed Services ) than, say, the US Air Force. A pseudo military division, effectively on loan to civilian departments, that has it's own unique culture given its role. The US Coast Guard is effectively part of the US armed forces, but has aspects unique to it and reports to Homeland Security. Parts of that meaning operations involve law enforcement duties, environmental protection and search and rescue. Which would fall outside of a traditional military role.  You can also make the case to think of the Explorer's division as something akin to NASA.  NASA is a civilian agency that uses many military personnel for operations, but they have them use mission patches and NASA designations on non military uniforms. Those personnel assigned to NASA are US military (usually US Air Force) but are given special consideration.  ( Keep in mind the Grey/Red uniform Earthforce demanded is closer to the traditional layout. Presumably some higher up figured it better sells the idea that the Explorer program was still part of the military.)"
babylon5,32l79m,thegenregeek,4,Tue Apr 14 19:03:08 2015 UTC,But what about the crew of the EAS Cortez from Season 2?  The crew as well as the captain wore the regular Earthforce standard uniform. Have they changed standard Explorer uniforms between 2259 and 2267 without changing any other uniforms?  What do we think might have precipitated such a change?
babylon5,32l79m,thegenregeek,5,Tue Apr 14 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"What do we think might have precipitated such a change?   (In universe answer...) Probably Earth's rise to fascism and resulting civil war. The founding of the Interstellar Alliance, and its role is dismantling Clark's regime, probably helped justify revamping the program with less of a military outlook. After all it was no longer about Earth trying to increase it sphere of influence nor was Clarke's style of government in favor. (And Crusade takes place 5 years after the founding of the ISA)  I mean, go back and look at 'In the Beginning.'  The entire reason the Earth Minbari War started was because Earthforce military wanted to ""lead the charge"". Earthgov left most major decisions to Earthforce, who's arrogance nearly wiped out the planet despite clear warnings about the Minbari from close allies.  Even after the War the Explorer program was probably still operated to project a sense of Earth's might to remote systems in first contact situations. (Routinely in Babylon 5 we are told how many people on Earth think the Minbari simply got lucky during the war. Or that Earth had rebuilt and was ready to fight the alien threat)  (Real answer...) They wanted to change the uniforms, because new show, and felt this highlighted a different era. Babylon 5 in many ways was structured much like the World War II global politics (hence their uniform designs). Crusade could have been aimed at focusing on Cold War era politics and scientific exploration (or roughly the 60's). In which case that would naturally lead a NASA style outlook, at least on the surface. (Of course the conspiracy angle of Crusade was never realized due to cancellation.)   Have they changed standard Explorer uniforms between 2259 and 2267 without changing any other uniforms?   We don't really know, because we've only seen crew from two explorer vessels. I don't believe there is any other canon sources on it. In B5, during the build up to Earth's Fascist take over everything was military focused. After Earth was liberated the focus shifted back to a far less hardline view of what the Earth Alliance's role should be.  We have enough understanding of in-universe politics that there is a logical reason why they could have changed it between 2259 and 2267."
babylon5,32l79m,Cern_Stormrunner,2,Tue Apr 14 20:38:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting and insightful answer, thank you very much!"
babylon5,32l79m,WasabiSanjuro,2,Tue Apr 14 21:02:28 2015 UTC,"I remember something about the black uniforms being uniforms specifically for Exploration class vessels. I think it was in the episode where they got the ""new"" gray/red suits"
babylon5,32l79m,autowikibot,2,Tue Apr 14 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late to the party but I wanted to chime in on this.    It is not uncommon for unique uniforms to arise out of an established look or to even see a complete overhaul of designs.  For example, these sites will show you how the Air Force uniforms have evolved through the decades:  http://www.usmilitariaforum.com/forums/index.php?/topic/5846-post-wwii-50s-60s-us-air-force-uniform-photos/   http://usafeenlistedheritage.org/history/uniforms/    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniforms_of_the_United_States_Air_Force    Clearly, the Air Force's Equestrian uniform is quite unique compared the rest.  And then there's this nightmare:  http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/air-force-chief-of-staffs-hilarious-new-uniform/    After Earth was attacked by the Drakh, it's not completely inconceivable that they would have to do some restructuring, consolidation, redundancies, and redesigns.  While I can't definitively state that these new uniforms have been applied across board, we can conclude that either this uniform was made exclusively for the Excalibur's crew because of their unique mission profile and crew composition, or that this was applied across the board but was slowly being applied to different units a little bit at a time.        It should also be mentioned that the uniforms/armor that the Marines donned on the Excalibur was also quite different than anything we've seen in Babylon 5 thus far.  We would also have eventually seen more of the Warlock Class Destroyers, which were first debuted in Call to Arms."

babylon5,32cprv,tdasnowman,4,Mon Apr 13 04:20:08 2015 UTC,"I've said it before on here, I'm still a little butthurt over the whole TNT situation.  Probably always will be.  It isn't that season 5 was bad necessarily, but it was a letdown, in my opinion.    I will agree season 5 got much better toward the latter half.  When the season aired, I almost stopped watching it.  Almost.  I watched the show religiously from The Gathering on forward as it aired, so I wasn't about to let it stop me completely.    Right off the bat, I hated Lochley.  She grew on me, by the end I accepted her and liked her, but man I hated her at the start.  I wish the whole telepath arc had played out a little differently and had provided a better way to explore the looming telepath war.   It is what it is though, and Babylon 5 is the best television show ever produced as far as I'm concerned.  I may be critical of it, but damn do I love it."
babylon5,32cprv,swampnuts,3,Mon Apr 13 04:28:39 2015 UTC,I really think the telepath arc was meant to start in season 4 and conclude in season 5. Lotta shows have a problem with that last season BSG got weak there as well.
babylon5,32cprv,tdasnowman,2,Mon Apr 13 04:38:52 2015 UTC,"Season 5 would have been so much better if TNT actually did Crusade, which was going to continue some of the telepath stuff."
babylon5,32cprv,beaverteeth92,2,Sun Apr 19 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"Lochley was actually much better in Crusade, but when she first comes in S5 she actively resents or opposes most of the established characters. She acts like a villain, and the fans kind of treat her as such. It's kind of a shame, Tracy seems extremely nice in interviews despite lots of fan vitriol."
babylon5,32cprv,GhrabThaar,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:58:21 2015 UTC,"There were several behind the scenes reasons S5 was rocky.  1: The lack of knowing if there would be a 5th season thereby forcing Joe to wrap up storylines in S4 that would've been in S5. For example is original idea was toend S4 on ""Intersections in Real Time"" .  2: Claudia's decision to quit in hopes of getting on Star Trek: Voyager.   3: Joe's notes on S5 being trashed by the hotel maid in Blackpool.   2 & 3 hit at the same time and really left JMS in a bad place."
babylon5,32cprv,bobchin_c,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"Wow.  I knew about 1, but 2 and 3 holy shit.   Was Claudia going for Janeway?"
babylon5,32cprv,swampnuts,2,Thu Apr 23 21:14:20 2015 UTC,Nope she went after the 7 of  9 role.
babylon5,32cprv,bobchin_c,2,Thu Apr 23 21:20:54 2015 UTC,"yeah, derp, I should have thought about that before posting it...she wouldn't have been in the show at all if she left for Janeway."
babylon5,32cprv,swampnuts,11,Thu Apr 23 21:23:45 2015 UTC,I think your assessment of the first season is pretty typical.    Hold on to your seat.  You're heading into the fire !
babylon5,32cprv,joelincoln,3,Sun Apr 12 18:42:36 2015 UTC,Into the night might be a more fitting phrase.
babylon5,32cprv,joelincoln,2,Sun Apr 12 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but didn't Emperor Turhan ask Kosh is this would end ""in fire"" as he died?  I suppose it's all a matter of perspective.  ;-)"

babylon5,32cprv,gzpz,3,Sun Apr 12 19:40:58 2015 UTC,Ya I agree i'm just saying that I'm finding season 2 to be much better. There are still a lot of good episodes in season 1 like Babylon squared.
babylon5,32cprv,slykethephoxenix,4,Sun Apr 12 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"You are most certainly correct when it comes to action and a continuing arc, but as a Princess of the House Corrino once said ""A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct"". And that you place people in the correct time and correct place.   I've been a fan of science fiction for over 45 years and I still think Babylon 5 is the best of the many series offered on television. As others in this thread have said ""Hold on to your seat"" it's just gonna get better. Enjoy!!! I'm kind of jealous that you are getting to see it all for the first time."

babylon5,32cprv,gzpz,3,Mon Apr 13 03:37:55 2015 UTC,I wonder how much Michael O'Hare mental health affected the pacing of season 1.
babylon5,32cprv,tdasnowman,2,Mon Apr 13 04:24:51 2015 UTC,"Some I'm sure but the way I understood it Straczynski had the whole story planned from the very beginning. Switching captains would have gone on regardless and I thought most people didn't learn of Michael O'Hare's problem until later, some even not until after he passed ""beyond the rim"".  (Sorry)"
babylon5,32cprv,GhrabThaar,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:52:28 2015 UTC,"Sure the switch was planned, but possibly not as sudden Straczynski has written that he had to make adjustments to his plan, there was more planned for Sinclair that wasn't possible to shoot. They were abl e to keep it quiet surprising considering the show was launch at the dawn of the internet."
babylon5,32cprv,tdasnowman,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:38:47 2015 UTC,"((Sigh)) yes, the dawn of the internet....Well even though I was a software support tech then and have used and enjoyed the internet from the very beginning, there was not a lot of the info out there and available like now. I think I didn't find out about Michael's problems until I was watching the Bonus materials on the DVD's.  Possibly there was some mention on the Zocolo website, but I really don't remember. I'd bet the secret wouldn't have been so well hidden if it were happening today."
babylon5,32cprv,GhrabThaar,2,Mon Apr 13 15:06:03 2015 UTC,"Very true. I remember some grumblings at cons in the late 90's, but nothing confirmed."
babylon5,32cprv,tdasnowman,5,Mon Apr 13 15:39:46 2015 UTC,"Season 1 makes a lot more sense on second watch, though it still has the highest concentration of off-the-wall random episodes of all the seasons, perhaps barring 5. In my opinion lots of stuff in S1 was very relevant, but to the characters moreso than the overall arc of the show. Really there's only 1 arc of the entire plot I utterly despise, and even that's due to abysmal execution more than content specifically."
babylon5,32cprv,GhrabThaar,2,Sun Apr 12 21:11:13 2015 UTC,what was the plot point you despise?
babylon5,32cprv,tdasnowman,5,Mon Apr 13 04:25:29 2015 UTC,"The telepath arc was actually okay in theory, but the execution was done in the dumbest possible way that it ruined what should have been a very interesting foil for Bester. It dragged on far too long on top of that, so I just try to ignore its existence."
babylon5,32cprv,Meithos,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:55:49 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, there was so much there, so much you could possibly explore, but we kept being stuck with this same little group. If this was the beginning of the telepath war, I would have liked to have seen some action on Mars and Earth as well. That and their demands were so under explained they were outlandish. And the way the Taliah arc ended was bullshit. You mean to tell me that a telepathic being capable of becoming pure energy and seeing a million years in the future couldn't see where she was going, but Kosh could?"
babylon5,32cprv,sleight42,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:06:12 2015 UTC,"My interpretation was that the personality is buried in something extremely unpleasant for Talia. We saw that she had scanned a serial killer before, and how unpleasant that was. I assumed Ironheart was being metaphorical about his million year statement, and I don't think a guy on the verge of skipping a few rungs on the evolutionary ladder is going to take time out and mentally dissect a former lover on his way out the door."
babylon5,32cprv,StarFuryG7,2,Mon Apr 13 05:35:39 2015 UTC,"Originally I thought the million year thing was just a throw off statement, but given that was the exact time line the Vorlon homeworld becomes accessible I doubt it was coincidence after rewatching the show a few times. I do think it's just proof they had concepts for the telepaths that they didn't fully flesh out and linked poorly. I also think Kosh was after more than just the memories of the serial killer case she was on. I can't remember the exact line but it was something about mirrors and reflections."
babylon5,32cprv,radishknight,2,Mon Apr 13 05:56:15 2015 UTC,"On my first experience with B5, I started watching towards the end of season 1 and I was unable to catch all of the episodes. While I enjoyed what I watched, the show was just another show on tv. Upon my second viewing, years later, I watched the movies and the seasons from start to finish. I was still not a huge fan of season 1, but as season 2,3 and 4 played on, I grew to love the show more and more. The more I watched, the better it got(acting, music, fx etc). It wasn't until my third, fourth and so on, times viewing the series that I began to appreciate the growth of the characters through season 1. Without season 1, it is harder to appreciate the full arc of the story, the lore and how great Londo and G'Kar were. I would give anything to binge watch B5 again for the first time. Easily, one of my top 3 shows ever!"
babylon5,32cprv,soulmajesty,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:24:47 2015 UTC,"Season 1 was scripted by a hodgepodge of writers. JMS didn't write the majority of episodes.  Season 2 is almost entirely JMS. 3-5 was, AFAIK, 100% JMS.  Also, if you see Janet Greek as the director, time to pucker up, Legolas, because it's going to be a helluva ride. Greek was brought in to direct most of the heavy arc episodes. She did a bang up job of them!"
babylon5,322uv1,INBluth,12,Fri Apr 10 03:14:24 2015 UTC,"I bought the scripts to get access to the official timeline/""bible"" for B5 and it only has a paragraph describing the events of 2762, a line that the Rangers helped the monks in 3262 - so no help there.  My personal view? After the great burn the Earth was of-limits and left to tend for itself, but this did not stop the Rangers from intervening to ""guide"" the humans left behind.  I have a suspicion that this idea might have come from A Canticle for Leibowotz by Walter M Miller,  which follows the rise of mankind after a nuclear apocalypse and the importance that some monks had in the second rise of mankind. If this Era interest you, then read the book or listen to the radio drama."
babylon5,322uv1,mdillenbeck,10,Fri Apr 10 09:25:59 2015 UTC,I have a suspicion that this idea might have come from A Canticle for Leibowotz by Walter M Miller   JMS said so himself.

babylon5,322uv1,BrotherChe,3,Fri Apr 10 17:27:10 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain Canticle was said to be part inspiration for the storyline. It was likely mentioned on the Lurker's Guide or some other Usenet post from JMS.  Yup, there it is http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/088.html"

Plus, USENET was groundbreaking as far as fan-creator interaction, and the Guide helped pull the best tidbits together each ""week""."
babylon5,322uv1,lolzergrush,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry for responding to a two-week-old post.  As for what happens, we can take some guess that the Rangers infiltrated various religious orders. JMS seemed to have a keen interest in monasticism as it was a recurring theme. The order of monks led by Brother Theo were said to originate from New Melleray Abbey which is a real OCSO monastery in Iowa (commonly called ""Trappists""). Europe was brought out of the dark ages in large part because of the technological innovations and work of monastic orders. Interestingly, many historians posit that the industrial revolution would have happened a century earlier had Henry XIII not brought down a Cistercian monastery in England that had Europe's first blast furnace. I would guess that JMS' vision was that history was repeating itself, with the monks being a force for gradually moving Earth back to an industrialized society and the Rangers helping them along.  Behind the scenes, that episode was thrown together very quickly. They basically didn't know they had a fifth season approved until after the Season 4 wrap party. (In fact they got the cast to renew their contracts at the wrap party while everyone was drunk.) The last episode of Season 5 was meant to be the Season 4 finale, but now that they had a whole new season to do, JMS threw together a script basically overnight and within a week they were filming it. A lot of the sets hadn't been put back up yet and cast members had schedule conflicts so they needed a plot that allowed them to de-emphasize the usual characters and settings."

Training him to see the unexpected potential in other races, to not fear the dark or the unknown, and to embrace change and be willing to give up part of himself to grow.  What could better embody these lessons than Sheridan crawling into that dark hole, giving up his insignia, and being rewarded with the beautiful hymn the typically maligned and misunderstood Pak'ma'ra race sings for him?  This kind of attitude is seen on a much larger scale later on, where Sheridan has the Army of Light recruit the remaining First Ones for their battle against both the Vorlon and Shadow armadas at Coriana 6.  So, essentially, Kosh was showing Sheridan the attitude he needed to save the galaxy and the younger races from the wrath of both Shadows and Vorlons in the coming war."

babylon5,31yrzp,DarthNobody,12,Thu Apr 9 07:14:03 2015 UTC,"Kosh was a little different from the rest of the Vorlons. Although ""we are all Kosh"", he could see the potential in the younger races to choose their own path, not the ""right way"" from the Vorlons or the ""wrong way"" of the Shadows.   It wasn't about what wa in it for the Vorlons, it was about actually helping the younger races. Something the rest of the Vorlons and the Shadows had forgotten in their contest. They wanted to win. Kosh wanted to help."
babylon5,31yrzp,kengou,2,Thu Apr 9 11:35:47 2015 UTC,"Just proving they're right, really:  rigid order and control (Vorlons) versus pitched conflict and chaos (Shadows) in figuring out which advances younger civilizations better.  The Vorlons and Shadows didn't exactly like each other, but they respected each other's might enough to not want a war.  So, they let the younger races duke it out on their behalf.

From the first episode, when we saw Zathras, I think it was Babylon Squared, and the 2nd episode, War Without End, Choate's Acting was quite seamless.   Aside from the slightly grainier video quality of the old scenes in War Without End, Zathras doesnt seem to miss a beat, he acted them very well, and they would have been a year later yes?"

babylon5,312s5t,WasabiSanjuro,2,Wed Apr 1 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"My theory is: he'll drop the tool later and it'll get used by someone else on B4 for jury-rigging something critical later. If he uses the tool for its apparent purpose, it will get worn and/or damaged.   The tool was desinged and made by Vorlons / Minbari not to do the thing it looks like it was made for, but the thing it actually gets used for."
babylon5,30yb3l,RetroPhaseShift,9,Tue Mar 31 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, been a lurker here for a long time and I'm glad to finally have something to contribute. My purpose for sharing it here is kinda two-fold, though: if anyone knows more about the plans for Crusade that they can source, please share! When I started the article I was surprised there wasn't more, especially as JMS had indicated a willingness to share his plans years ago. I pretty much dove through the entire Usenet archives of his posts, but some of them were lost, so it's quite possible there's more info out there that I haven't been able to find.   If you know any other interviews or anything, I'll happily add that into the article and be sure to credit you as well. If you don't, I hope you enjoy the article as it is now. Thanks!"
babylon5,30yb3l,swampnuts,3,Tue Mar 31 18:19:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it was an interesting article.  Crusade was pretty bad, but it had potential.  I see it as a mirror of the B5 series.  B5 really didn't kick off hard until the end of season 2 really.  Season 1 and 2 were mostly (needed) exposition, but in my opinion were fairly boring and serve as a huge barrier to entry for most people.  The same thing happened with Crusade, but TNT wanted an action show and Crusade was just on too slow of a fuse.  Is that a fair assessment of what went on?"
babylon5,30yb3l,Seafroggys,15,Tue Mar 31 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"Crusade wasn't bad by any means.  It was a lot better than B5 Season 1 imo, and definitely on par with the beginning/middle of Season 2.  You're just comparing it to the middle of Season 4, which is unfair, really.  EDIT:  Really, there's only two outliers as far as bad episodes go.  War Zone, and that one with that mind control virus thing that spreads by touch (the one that had Mr Wells in it).  All the other episodes range from okay to pretty good."
babylon5,30yb3l,Triplanetary,7,Tue Mar 31 18:44:05 2015 UTC,"And ""War Zone"" was an episode that TNT mandated JMS do instead of the episode he wanted to air first. ""Fistfights on the bridge"" is straight out of TNT's bad recommendations handbook."
babylon5,30yb3l,swampnuts,5,Tue Mar 31 18:51:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah. B5 isn't Star Trek by any means, but these characters are still professionals, and it's just as jarring as if Roddenberry had been told, ""You know what would be great? If Riker just decked Picard in the face on the bridge."""
babylon5,30yb3l,FKRMunkiBoi,3,Tue Mar 31 19:54:08 2015 UTC,"True. I guess the TNT involvement soured me then, and it sours me still.  I wasn't a big fan of how TNT handled either show.    I didn't say season 4 so I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion.  I'd put crusade on par with the latter half of season 2, actually.  There was a lot of good in crusade, but there was plenty of bad as well.  It's sad it didn't get the chance the other series did to get past its initial growing pains."
babylon5,30yb3l,Triplanetary,9,Tue Mar 31 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty fair. As the conflict grew, TNT apparently got some research in indicating that almost none of the B5 viewers were sticking around for their other shows and vice versa. Basically at that point, they just wanted out, so they gave some truly heinous revision notes for the episodes from that point on and did everything they could to sink the show. When Sci-Fi channel tried to come up with a deal to save it, TNT went out of their way to make the deal impossible, just in case Crusade ended up being a hit on Sci-Fi and made them look like idiots for doubting it. The show was doomed before it ever made it to air (hence why it was deliberately promoted as a ""limited mini-series""). By the time the contracts were up and Sci-Fi was able to get the rights to air B5, it was too late to bring Crusade back. Although, Sci-Fi did support the creation of new stuff like Legend of the Rangers, and had that been picked up to series, I think it's likely we'd have had some Crusade crossover to tie up that series (a ""Fully Absorbed Finale,"" as TVTropes likes to say.)"
babylon5,30yb3l,fzammetti,4,Tue Mar 31 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it will end up one day in one of those self-published books that JMS churns out. While I appreciate he does it, I was turned off by the ""B5 at Twenty years"" book (because their cheap ass paper stock made a muddy mess of the HD photos we were promised), in addition to the ""interviews"" book that was massively spaced to increase the page count and was $40 for nothing new or substantial (transcripts of video easily available on youtube).  Yes, it's a damn shame Crusade ended when and how it did. But JMS has been such a ""take all my toys with me from the toybox"" type when things don't go his way that it's been hard to justify investing any further into a dead storyline."
babylon5,30yb3l,Sparta2019,7,Tue Mar 31 19:04:57 2015 UTC,"JMS has a bit of auteur syndrome, I suppose. 90% of the time it works out great, but B5 does have a couple goofy moments where I wish somebody had told him, ""This is goofy. Change it."" For example: ""The characters are getting mugged while passing through Downbelow again? Seriously?"""
babylon5,30yb3l,kesherz,2,Tue Mar 31 19:57:17 2015 UTC,The far worse offense with that 20 book was there is virtually nothing on the Shadow in it. Like maybe one page and very few pictures of any kind.   To use a relevant meme: what the ACTUAL fuck?!

babylon5,30f0t8,watyrfall,14,Thu Mar 26 21:00:21 2015 UTC,"I actually HATE that scene... because it demonstrates why we'll never have a proper B5 reboot: who the hell could you EVER get to play G'Kar with the same gravitas on display in that scene? I honestly can't think of a single actor alive today that could deliver it as well.   I'm not sure I WANT a reboot mind you, but this scene is proof that we CAN'T ever have it even if we wanted it."
babylon5,30f0t8,fzammetti,5,Thu Mar 26 23:07:48 2015 UTC,"Not that I want to ever replace Andreas, but Gary Oldman could handle the material."
babylon5,30f0t8,FKRMunkiBoi,3,Thu Mar 26 23:22:08 2015 UTC,"I thought about him, and I like him a lot, but I can't see him in that role. He's a little too... quirky maybe?   The only person that I thought could come close is Denzel Washington. He's got the intensity to pull it off certainly. The problem there though is Denzel is basically always Denzel. And that's usually cool, but not when he needs to be G'Kar.   There was a thread some time ago where we all tossed around actors to replace the originals... lots of good ideas, but it seemed like the consensus was that G'Kar and Londo could not be replaced while all others could (Delenn was borderline as I recall). That's my take too."
babylon5,30f0t8,fzammetti,4,Thu Mar 26 23:46:40 2015 UTC,"Again, nobody could ever, ever replace Andreas or Peter. However, to me, Gary Oldman would sting far, far less than some lesser flavor-of-the-year actor cast simply to sell tickets.  I'm sad I missed that thread you mentioned, sounds fun.  But we do need a reboot. Desperately. That's the only way WB will ever even consider revisiting the original series for an HD upgrade. Just like JJ Abrams Trek convinced CBS to pay to restore STTNG. Otherwise, this incredible show is going to eventually fade into obscurity, just as so many black & white shows of yesteryear. You need a lot of new blood coming in for WB to ever care about this show again.  And I would trade in my entire 7 seasons of STTNG on Blu Ray in exhange for the 5 seasons of Babylon 5 restored in HD on Blu Ray."
babylon5,30f0t8,FKRMunkiBoi,3,Fri Mar 27 00:01:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Oldman certainly wouldn't suck, that's for sure. There are certainly far worse choices.   And I agree... a lot of people don't want a reboot but I for one am okay with it... some people think reboots somehow destroy the original and that's just not true... if a reboot sucks you still have the original and can even ignore the reboot if you choose. As you say, a reboot might be the impetuous for figuring out how to do an HD update of the original... from all I've read it's almost impossible at this point given the original assets were destroyed, but I'm sure someone could figure it out, and would, if they thought there was money to be made.   Plus, we want a new generation to get hooked like we were and,  sad to say, the original doesn't always do that because of the ""cheapness"" in spots. It took my own son almost four seasons to realize he was actuality digging it because it took that long to get past the look and some of the cheesy acting. I can understand that, and if a reboot solved that problem then I'm okay with it."
babylon5,30f0t8,fzammetti,3,Fri Mar 27 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"It's not impossible. It's simply cost-prohibitive to rebuild everything from scratch for the CGI.   I talked with someone on the TNG restoration, and we did talk B5 (he already has a current working relationship with JMS and you better believe I showed my support for B5!). He said they just upload the footage into the computer and the computer matches the movement. It's the hours and hours of work in paying CG artists to build the CG models that costs so much. If they had the original computer files, then it's pretty much a case of adding new paint (a new HD skin) to the models. Building them from scratch takes a lot of time.  The original Star Trek already had this done. All of the new CGI for the 1966 series was done using this method.  So then it's just a matter of finding the original camera footage for the live-action as well. Reports were that some of that had been chewed up by rats while in storage."
babylon5,30f0t8,FKRMunkiBoi,3,Fri Mar 27 01:36:31 2015 UTC,Andreas balances intensity with levity and knows how to use either properly.
babylon5,30f0t8,WasabiSanjuro,2,Fri Mar 27 15:17:15 2015 UTC,"Morgan Freeman perhaps.  Anthony Hopkins too.  Then again, I don't even want it remade."
babylon5,30f0t8,ActionFlank,8,Thu Mar 26 23:43:54 2015 UTC,"Not really. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman every time. Anthony Hopkins probably could, but honestly his charm always seems less sincere and more forced, while he could handle the ""dead. dead. dead."" part.  Gary Oldman has great range and gravitas, and has played psychopaths to beloved Uncles. Plus, Gary is far more of a chameleon and could really disappear into the role. Morgan Freeman would be Morgan Freeman as G'Kar.   Then again, I don't even want it remade.   I understand that, but I DO want it remade, simply because that's the only way that WB is going to ever dust off the series and give it the attention it's been lacking for so long. A successful reboot that it a hit with the masses (even if it leaves the original fans cold) would go a long way towards convincing WB to invest in that HD upgrade of the classic series that at this point isn't going to ever happen otherwise.  Reboots = we can ignore them, but if they are a hit we can still benefit.   JJ Abram's Star Trek made enough money and had enough people talking that CBS was willing to cough up the cash to get STTNG restored in HD. To me, that's worth the price of existence for those rebooted films."
babylon5,30f0t8,FKRMunkiBoi,4,Thu Mar 26 23:54:11 2015 UTC,"I know this is a bizarre idea, but I can see Michael Keaton as G'Kar. Not nearly Andreas's caliber, but I think he can handle both the humor and gravitas the role requires."
babylon5,30f0t8,bobchin_c,3,Fri Mar 27 20:07:08 2015 UTC,That's just bizarre enough to work!
babylon5,30f0t8,fzammetti,3,Fri Mar 27 20:18:04 2015 UTC,I reckon Idris Elba could pull it off. He's the only actor around at the moment that manages to have that threatening physical presence mixed with sharp intelligence and deep emotion. Whether he could pull it off beneath latex I'm not so sure...   Not that it really matters in my view. If they ever remake B5 they don't need to make the characters exactly the same.
babylon5,30f0t8,DarrenGrey,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:04:32 2015 UTC,"When I first saw this post, I, too, thought of Idris Elba in G'Kar's role."
babylon5,30f0t8,Lettershort,2,Mon Mar 30 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite moments from the series is Ivanova getting severely pissed at the advanced Earthforce destroyers.  Right before opening an extra-large can of whoop-ass on them, she gives a small pre-battle speech ending in barely a whisper:  ""I am Death incarnate, and the last living thing that you are ever going to see...God sent me!""  Even after watching it many times, the intensity of her furious anger mixed with the cold resolve to kill every last man and woman on those ships sends chills through me.  I seriously don't think that a reboot of the series would ever get these scenes right, they're one-time things that can't be recaptured except as pale reflections of the original.  So, yeah, I'm not sad we'll never get a reboot, it's one of the things that TV is doing right these days."

babylon5,30f0t8,CoffeeAndCigars,4,Fri Mar 27 00:53:09 2015 UTC,"There's a reason B5 is basically just ""G'Kar and Londo, the Series"" for many of us. They're characters with flaws and issues, while having great strengths and complexity at times. This allows them to develop and change over time, developing relationships and bonds that fuel the story so wonderfully.   Neither are inherently good or inherently bad. They're products of their past and like any good character that past is both troubled and beneficial."
babylon5,30f0t8,mexter,4,Fri Mar 27 20:07:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It helps that the actors were fantastic fire both of them, of course.

My dad and I realized at one point that NO weapons were allowed and it dawned on us that this could be a moment were that rule is just tossed.  But then again it is G'kar and rules are fluid around him.  This is also one of the scenes that really struck me on his acting. Through some major face paint and prosthetics he managed to convey such deep emotion and capture my attention even as a kid.  My favorite scene of his is still when he gives his speech on freedom though, right as Londo strips him of his titles and status."
babylon5,30f0t8,Gark32,7,Fri Mar 27 12:09:44 2015 UTC,"there are lots of knives on the show, though. that's not even the only one that G'Kar has -- remember he was gonna straight stab the Centauri emperor with a different weapon. Londo has a whole PPG in bits in his quarters. Hell, they let King Arthur/Mcintyre onto the station with a damn sword on Marcus' recognizance, and he's way lower on the totem pole than an ambassador."

babylon5,2zo3j8,niki9,5,Fri Mar 20 06:44:58 2015 UTC,"Notice that near the end of the episode, Kosh bows to Sinclair. This has to be a reference to Sinclair being Valen.    In The Gathering (series pilot) we see Kosh's arrival on B5 from his perspective, as a flashback when Lyta is scanning his mind for clues about who tried to assassinate him. Upon first meeting Sinclair, he bows to him and says, ""Entil Zha, Valen.""  Entil Zha = Ranger One. It's not for another two years that we find out that Sinclair is Valen. JMS foreshadowed shit from season 3 in the pilot episode, in a way so subtle that no one could possibly realize it unless it was already their second time around watching the series.   There are things like that sprinkled all throughout the series. I've watched it about 5 times through now and I still notice new connections. And that's why it's hands down my favorite TV series of all time."

babylon5,2zo3j8,A2597,6,Fri Mar 20 12:18:39 2015 UTC,"I've always appreciated how JMS handled this. They appear as pop-culture angels. Two wings, white robes...

Babylon 5 does not.  EDIT: I mean, think about it - B5 visual effects are purely digital. Season 1 was composed and rendered in Lightwave version 1 (!) on Amiga (!!) farms.

Also, I don't think the composition is the difficult part. They don't have to match the previous scenes pixel-by-pixel, they only need to have more or less the same scene. In any case, I think in the same special features it said they do have the original files."
babylon5,2zij8c,Stile4aly,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:42:31 2015 UTC,"Any single CGI scene contains at least one (but usually tens or even hundreds) of the following:  light sources (local, on models, scene); particle effects and their sources, trajectories, types, numbers of particles, particle properties; camera trajectory, speed, angle; any object trajectory, speed, angle; texture bump maps and material maps; other effects such as damage to ships, ship lasers (if not done via particle effects)...   There are surely things I have forgotten (it's been 5 years since I did any 3D animations).

babylon5,2yvoa5,INBluth,21,Fri Mar 13 04:47:39 2015 UTC,"I believe that this refers to Justin, the man Sheridan meets on Z'Ha'Dum. Justin is meant to be a sort of ""dark Sheridan"", his equal and opposite, similarly qualified but working for the Shadows. The idea of a dark Sheridan is hinted at a few times. In the same dream sequence as ""the man in between is searching for you"", you see repeated imagery of another Sheridan, a different Sheridan. Then there are brief quips like, when Sheridan predicts the Shadows' plan in Shadow Dancing, he says ""It's what I'd do. You know, if I were the enemy...""  Honestly, I think this is one of the parts where the series stumbles a bit. There's a good amount of foreshadowing towards this ""dark Sheridan"", but then we actually meet the guy, and it's never really made clear that he's what everything was building towards. Maybe some pages were cut from the script or something, but Justin doesn't really fill the shoes that were made for him. The audience just sees him as ""oh, another corrupted human like Morden."" There's even the climactic close-up of Sheridan firing a PPG and killing him, but it's filmed wrong. It's filmed so the audience thinks that Sheridan is shooting at the Shadow that just entered the room. There's no focus on what he's actually doing, ""killing his opposite number"". Sheridan kills Justin, aka Dark Sheridan, and thus must die to keep the balance.  But the audience doesn't get any of that. I didn't even get it until my fourth or fifth watch of the series. Justin-as-Dark-Sheridan just does not come through in the editing, the camerawork, or the scripting. I don't know if that was studio interference, or a genuine flub by JMS, or what. But IMO it's one of the biggest ball-drops of the series."
babylon5,2yvoa5,AirborneRodent,12,Fri Mar 13 06:49:13 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Justin actually say something like, ""Think of me as a sort of middle-man.""  Middle-man, man in-between...I always thought that was meant as a clear indicator that he was the man in-between."

babylon5,2yvoa5,vaminion,3,Fri Mar 13 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"in the technomage trilogy, (which is considered canon and written according to an outline created by JMS), Justin isn't' killed when Sheridan fires.  He fires at the shadows entering in the room.  Justin has dialogue and offers anna one final chance to turn sheridan...pretty good indication of not being dead.  He does, however, die shortly after when the White Star detonates in the underground city."

babylon5,2y6ly1,Calcifer643,53,Fri Mar 6 22:32:15 2015 UTC,"And who is going to punish them? The Earth Alliance?  What happens when the Onteen government gets involved?  EDIT:  Most of the answers in this thread have been less than helpful, including my own. Hell, the top voted one right now is just a quote from the episode and given the question you've asked here, you're probably not sure why the quote is even relevant. I'd like to give you a more detailed explanation.   But first, please note: minor spoilers from the episode which follows this one.   If this is your first time watching B5 you may be missing some of the geopolitical (galactopolitical?) context. Especially considering that you're right before the episode which contains most of the relevant context. M'Ola and Tharg are Onteen, and the Onteen are members of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds (LONAW.) The Onteen aren't even one of the more influential members of LONAW, and Aicha, the Onteen homeworld, is mineral poor and strategically unimportant. Compared to the Drazi, Vree, Abbai, Brakiri or even the Markab or Hyach they are small fries; in 2258 they don't even have a representative on the LONAW delegation to the B5 council.   But—you could easily make the case that LONAW is the Earth Alliance's best ally in the known galaxy, and by extension the Onteen and the EA are considered friends. The EA and the Centauri have pretty strong economic ties but no military alliance to speak of. They have a pretty neutral relationship with the Narn and Vorlons. Their relationship with the Minbari is complex due to the diversity of Minbari opinions on the humans, but it would definitely not be described as friendly. So not only is LONAW an EA ally, they're really the EA's only ally.   Why? EarthForce saved many LONAW members from extinction a mere 30 years ago, during a war in which the Minbari and Vorlons refused to intervene and the Narn and Centauri actively (though clandestinely) funded the Dilgar war effort. Why do you think that LONAW, a loose, fractious coalition of culturally, technologically, and militarily disparate worlds has a seat on the B5 council at all? Because they've made nice with the people who are running the show. (Perhaps more accurately, the people running the show have successfully made nice with them.) A little later in the series, Delenn will comment that no other race would even consider building a place like B5 because the EA is the only government which even occasionally places the interests of the nascent galactic community on the same level as their own. But lets concede the point for a moment—even if, say, the Centauri were the ones to build an interstellar meeting place, they wouldn't give LONAW a seat on the council. Neither would the Narn, and neither would the Minbari.  And on the topic of our beloved interstellar meeting place, never forget just how damn fragile this entire dog and pony show really is. The aging legacy of a wartime president, the only reason it ever came to fruition is because the current (popular) president has a well-known soft spot for the project. Londo may be jaded but his assessment of galactic peace as a paper fantasy is quite reasonable. Point being, Sinclair needs every drop of support he can get if he is going to make this work. The only way he is going to secure that support is to adhere to the principles he outlines for the viewer at the beginning of each episode: ""Creating a place where humans and aliens could work out their differences peacefully.""  You are not going to work out many differences peacefully by imposing your moral code on others. Hell, wars have been started for less. Sinclair was 100% right and Franklin was dead wrong. The chain of command is in place for exact reason: Franklin's perspective is extremely limited, and as Franklin's CO it was Sinclair's job to see the big picture. This is going to sound cold, but the life of a single boy from a relatively unimportant race is pretty much irrelevant when compared to what was at stake. If LONAW withdrew from the council it would have been devastating, and potentially terminal, for the Babylon Project.   Ultimately, Franklin got lucky, and under a different commander he would probably have been court martialed. I mean, consider how this situation looks on paper: an EarthForce officer and member of the senior staff at a high profile installation with a history of insubordination egregiously violated the cultural and spiritual beliefs of the citizens of a sovereign nation. Shit son! Had I been his CO I would have had him on the next transport back to Earth post haste. Not only did he ignore a direct order, he put the entire mission at risk.  If the death of a boy is what it took to get the project back on track then I say it's worth it. Yes, ideally, the Onteen would abandon their unusual beliefs and allow Franklin to save the boy. Just about everyone who wasn't a member of the Children of Time would have preferred this outcome. But one of the main themes of B5 is that we live in an imperfect universe and we've gotta make the best of the situation with the cards we've been dealt. Franklin did not do that. Franklin looked at his cards, didn't like his hand, and decided to cheat. The question here isn't why weren't M'Ola and Tharg prosecuted, as they were just acting in accordance with their (admittedly backwards) cultural beliefs. The question is why wasn't Franklin unceremoniously booted out of EarthForce! He is the one who actually violated the protocols of his own culture.  This is the point that Kosh was getting at. The system that M'Ola and Tharg were trying to navigate had far more momentum than they were able to grasp. All of the agents in this situation could be expected to act within the confines of their own moral codes, and that's exactly what happened. Franklin saved the boy's life and in turn, M'Ola and Tharg took it. Whether or not Kosh filed a protest was irrelevant: Franklin still would have performed the operation and M'Ola still would have killed her son."
babylon5,2y6ly1,kraetos,9,Fri Mar 6 23:32:24 2015 UTC,"I've thought over a couple of your points previously, but you've constructed a brilliant, cohesive analysis.  You may have seen this before, but here's a couple of things the creator of the series, J. Michael Straczynkski, had to say about the episode:   Actually, I disagree when you say that the doctor was right. Says who? Not the parents. Not the episode. Nobody was really right, when you come down to it, except maybe Sinclair, who made the correct call. You say the boy was okay at the end...the parents didn't think so. Who's to say if there was or wasn't a soul inside? I think David's [David Gerrold's] script walked a very fine line and really didn't endorse either side. (I've had people send me email upset because we showed that the parents were right, and others because we said the doctor was right, and others because neither was right and the ambiguity bothered them.)  A lot of our episodes are constructed to work as mirrors; you see what you put into it. ""Believers"" has been interpreted as pro- religion, anti-religion, and religion-neutral...""Quality"" has been interpreted, as you note, as pro-capital punishment, and anti-capital punishment. We do, as you say, much prefer to leave the decision on what things mean to the viewer to hash out. A good story should provoke discussion, debate, argument...and the occasional bar fight.   The above quotes are courtesy of the episode's page on The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5."

But that is putting the cart before the horse. Who writes these universal laws? The Vorlons because they are the most powerful? The Minbari because the entire point was to appease them? The Humans because they built and operate the place? The Centauri because they have extensive experience with the various moral and legal codes in play? Or the Narn because they would raise hell if they weren't allowed to write them?  None of these codes would work. The Vorlons wouldn't do it simply because they are intentionally vague about their morality and legal system. The Centauri would never agree to being subjected to Minbari morality, the Minbari would object to human morality, the Narn would object to Centauri morality and everyone would object to Narn morality. The point of the Babylon Project in the first place was to lubricate relations between the great powers so that maybe, just maybe, the powers in question could eventually agree upon some sort of basic, unified legal code."

babylon5,2y6ly1,kesherz,1 point,Sat May 2 00:00:48 2015 UTC,"Mind if I ask a question?  I'm always a little stunned at how quickly Babylon 5 seemed to fall out of the public conscience considering how good it is (and I'm only on Season 1 still).  It's a bold series with a lot more to say than shows like TNG or Deep Space 9 dared even contemplate.  Serious ethnical and philosophical questions, compelling social and political drama, and with a complex story and universe that embraces differences of perspective rather than try to handwave or whitewash it all away with space magic and ""enlightened idealism"".  Every single episode begins with a declaration towards belief in the ideals and pursuit of peace and understanding, and emphasizes a terrible fate that will befall should this fail. It highlights peace as an active and perpetually in motion process that must be guarded and maintained at all costs despite the flaws of all of us.   ""Our last, best hope for peace"".   Yet as a franchise it just seems to have vanished.  What went wrong, besides TNT fucking things up?  Why is does it feel so marginalized?"
babylon5,2y6ly1,Hairy_Seldon,1 point,Sat May 2 00:45:16 2015 UTC,"There are a few reasons.  First and foremost, B5 was ahead of it's time in a very literal sense which hurt it in a very tangible way. Serialized primetime sci-fi was a real novelty in the 90's. In fact, primetime serialized anything was pretty rare. Sitcoms had running jokes and dramas had character development, but the idea of this tightly-cohesive story arc which has a well defined beginning, middle, and end like a novel was just not a thing you did on television if you weren't making a soap opera.  TNG did it a little. Contemporaries Buffy and DS9 did it as well. But the problem is that in a pre-DVD environment there was no easy way to catch up if you missed a season. Similarly, in a pre-streaming environment there was no easy way to catch up if you missed an episode. And if you missed the wrong episode of B5, hoo boy you were totally lost.  But that doesn't fully explain it away. Buffy has a stronger following today despite running concurrently and also being a sci-fi/fantasy show. B5 has a number of technical weakpoints. Interestingly enough the aliens are, overall, much better actors than the humans. In particular, O'Hare, Boxleitner, Christian and Tallman all have good days and bad days. I think that Doyle does a pretty good job overall, and while Jurasik and Katsulas are consistently excellent, the problem with having the human leads be a little stiff is that it makes it harder for the human viewers to get sucked in, since those are the characters you're supposed to immediately relate to.  The sets and costume design are a little overbearing and the CGI did not hold up all that well. The pacing is bumpy, and individually the writing for each episode when looked at on an individual basis can be a little ham-fisted. It's basically a classic case of judging a book by it's cover. If you catch one episode you're probably going to be severely underwhelmed, because the show only works when you take it as a whole. It is greater than the sum of it's parts and originally aired in a climate where it was difficult and expensive to get your hands on all the parts.  Had it came out ten years later it would have made a much deeper impression. Combine the technical merits of Battlestar Galactica and the long-form storytelling of Babylon 5 and you've got yourself the best sci-fi show ever made. But ultimately, the individual episodes of the show weren't strong enough for it to truly thrive in an analog environment."
babylon5,2y6ly1,pennywaffer,1 point,Sat May 2 01:17:13 2015 UTC,"It's strange however, that similar shows from this pre-digital era managed to find their own respective niches, though for reasons I'm not entirely certain of.

Babylon 5 demanded more of its audience both in commitment and intellectually, had a smaller potential audience pool, and wasn't as accessible to as wide a demographic stretch.  It also had fewer resources to work with while doing so and thus seems to have struggled with set design, lighting, and ""polish"" issues which I can only assume are budget related. (I'm still going nuts with the lift doors on the station with the horizontal lines that don't seem to match quite right).   In the end it's a testimony to the strength of their idea and vision that they managed to deliver such a compelling saga despite the limitations imposed upon them.  As for why it still is condemned to such unfair obscurity, I instinctively suspect it has something to do with rights issues, or some kind of hesitance on the part of J. Michael Straczynski?  I remember it was on Netflix once upon a time, but now in the age of unlimited digital streaming it only seems accessible on a per-episode or per-season basis on stores like Amazon and Google, and its follow up series (quality aside) are even more scarce.    It seems like a perfect cocktail to make it inaccessible to modern audiences who are mostly driven by convenience."

I have to add a little something...  I learned how to use a VCR at a very young age because of this show, my Dad would make sure I knew when and how to set up the recording so we could watch it later (no commercials!)  I remember when it was switched to Sci-Fi, not exactly a specific date as I was very young, he made sure to remind me it was now channel 44.  We watched this show every single day. Every rerun no matter what.   And then something magical happened. The DVD. Season 1 was released and of course we HAD to have it! I remember being so excited when it finally arrived, now we could watch every episode of S1 when we wanted. It was truly a marvelous thing. As the next seasons were released we would make sure to start at the beginning each time.  I can, with all honesty, say I have seen this show over 20 times. I can't vouch for my accuracy now as I haven't seen it in a few years now but when I was still living with my parents I knew nearly everything that happened in each episode and could rattle off all plot details before the opening credits.  I have all the seasons but I can't watch the first 8 episodes now. I went and got the first 2 disks signed by Claudia Christian and Walter Koenig. Why? It seemed like a great idea at the time.  Finding you guys made me so very happy, I remember all the great times with my dad either sitting and watching the show until midnight or the deep conversations we would have about some of the more interesting and very Outer Limits style choices they would make such as the S1 e10 discussion.

Sinclair showed up with a team to rescue them, and now this fucker storms in, grabs Ivanova (who is herself a military officer of course) and gets her to safety and behind cover, while the ambassador is left to fend for herself in the middle of a firefight! What an asshole."
babylon5,2wnio7,monkeyordonkey,3,Sat Feb 21 16:52:29 2015 UTC,"I actually rewatched that episode a couple weeks ago and remember thinking, ""Wait, shouldn't his first priority be to protect the helpless ambassador?"" But the ambassador did crawl away and find cover, so I guess that's something. But I do hope Sinclair visited her later and apologized profusely, given that he had treated her like shit on two occasions as a ruse, without her actually knowing that it was a ruse."
babylon5,2wnio7,Triplanetary,3,Sat Feb 21 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I absolutely believe this to be an oversight in the writing of the script, as television was held to lower standards back then, but it still cracks me up every time. It's just so absurd."
babylon5,2wnio7,monkeyordonkey,4,Sat Feb 21 17:20:54 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed O'Hare/Sinclair more as the captain too. Sinclair was more introvert, which is rare for a main character. I liked that. I have to admit that it took me a great deal of efforts not to dislike Sheridan and his brutal manners. I almost stopped watching the show at the begining of season 2 because of that. Fortunately, the character got better with time. So did the actor."
babylon5,2wnio7,Renard4,3,Sun Feb 22 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"Though I preferred Tron....er...Sheridan overall, I don't get the dislike for O'Hare.  Maybe he wouldn't have been a great fit for what happened in later seasons but he seemed to be a good fit for his character in S1 (and character arc beyond S1).  He seemed more like a diplomat, which complemented his acting style (and was more befitting his character as commander of a diplomatic outpost like B5) whereas Sheridan played a more versatile ""career military guy"" role, which complemented his acting style and character arc.  I was sad to hear about his (O'Hare's) mental illness and recent passing."
babylon5,2wnio7,dbutlerjr,3,Thu Feb 26 20:09:48 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I watched but I remember Sinclair mostly for being wooden and stilted. I assume this was supposed to be covering for PTSD, and events later on would have forced him into a more active person, but that didn't happen.  Instead, I remember Sheridan the most, because of all the big things that the character was a part of.  If anyone's a Lexx fan, it's the same as Zev/Xev. I'm partial to the one I spent the most time with as a viewer... though I don't really dislike the original actors."
babylon5,2wnio7,GhrabThaar,2,Sun Feb 22 01:46:05 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree with you on that-- though on the point of Z/Xev, I pretty much felt that Zev did a stronger job bringing out the ""love slave"" aspect, whereas Xev seemed to harness the concept of the cluster lizard better. YMMV.  I thought the acting of B5's station commanders was weak on both parts, but like you, it's Sheridan that really stands out because we had him for four years and not just one. I wonder what the arc would have been like with O'Hare throughout. It's an interesting exercise.   To my mind, Jurasik, Furlan, and especially Katsulas really were the center of gravitas on the show. Whereas the others could be (and in some cases, were) trap-doored, I don't know that losing any of those three would have been survivable from a dramatic standpoint.   (Edit: Words. Missing words. Words are tough.)"
babylon5,2wnio7,jeffyagalpha,5,Mon Feb 23 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"Londo and G'Kar.  In any other universe, they would have been a married couple.  Those are easily my two most favorite characters in the show.  G'Kar started out as a foppish troll but evolved into a major religious figure and savior of his people.  Londo...well...he is positively the CEO of the Good Intentions Paving Company."

I was so happy to se Dureena Nafeel come back, as I really liked her in Babylon 5. Matthew Gideon and Galen were also great, and with more episodes I'm sure they would have developed their charachters more as well. They all had great potentials."

The reason B5 is so amazing, and better by such large leaps and bounds then crusade and DS9 is its later seasons. The worst 13 episodes being the same as the best 3 of crusade doesn't change that crusade's a terrible series."

babylon5,2wmsn4,Seafroggys,7,Thu Mar 19 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"Starts very weak, ends pretty good. It's extremely uneven because of frequent network meddling and budget changes, but by the end of its run you can really start to see what JMS was trying to do (especially if you read the unfilmed season finale, whose script can be found on the Internet).  For the first half of the season, I kept thinking, ""I don't care about any of these people. I barely remember half their names."" But again, towards the end, the character development starts to get really interesting. It's really a shame that the show never had a chance to come into its own.  EDIT: Oh, and you're probably aware, but in case you're not, the movie ""Call to Arms"" is intended as the bridge between B5 and Crusade and must be watched before Crusade."
babylon5,2wmsn4,Triplanetary,4,Sat Feb 21 06:19:58 2015 UTC,"Comments being mostly negative, it's one season so it's not exactly going to take a lot of your time to make your own decision.   If you just go into it with the idea that Lumbergh is managing a ship, that'd be great."

You expect brilliance and depth but simply get mediocrity.   One pet hate of mine is Galen. He's deus ex machina personified in everything he or his kin appear in (including the books). It really takes the tension out of things when there's an all-knowing, seemingly omnipotent character around."

babylon5,2w4dml,aborders79,13,Mon Feb 16 21:49:49 2015 UTC,"Folks and OP:  I am a life-long Trekkie in my 50's and I like all of the various incarnations of Star Trek including DS9.  I consider DS9 my second favorite series of the franchise after TNG.    But, let's talk about Babylon 5.  I like B5 as much as I do ST.  It is an incredibly well-written and acted series.  Honestly, when I watched B5 for the first time (live) I was on the edge of my seat, literally.  ST never really did that to me.  Like ST, B5 has some warts that you need to endure, but they are minimal.  For example, the first season is a bit slow and plodding (not unlike TNG), but once they get into their stride, watch out!  Even though B5 and DS9 are both set on space stations, I really don't see that much similarity.  Of course, both are set in the future, in space, in a less-than-utopian society and with a generally positive outlook.  And one of the basic themes regarding one of humanity's strengths underpins both B5 and the whole ST franchise (but I won't mention it explicitly here).  So, as ""space operas"" there will be similar themes and plot mechanisms as it would be with any similarly set science fiction.  But the similarities end there.  B5 is a serial... that is, you have to watch it in order with story-lines that span multiple seasons.  DS9 is, like most of ST, is generally episodic.  IMHO, B5 represents a somewhat more realistic view of our not-too-distant future.  The story twists are truly awe-inspiring.    So, I would highly recommend B5 to any Trekkie.  I envy you when you get to experience it for the first time."
babylon5,2w4dml,joelincoln,1 point,Tue Feb 17 00:17:17 2015 UTC,"It is an incredibly well-written and acted series.   I'll second this.  The episode ""Severed Dreams"" is probably the best episode of any show on television I have ever seen. Edit: caution - that link is a spoiler."

Your question read to me like this: ""I really like apples. Should I eat a pizza?""  It's just a non-sequitur.  (ST: TOS hat-tip!)  B5 isn't about a post-human future where we've evolved into better people, we are pretty much the same, just with space ships. Plus, we get caught between some other space races who got a lot going on.  I'd say the main reasons I enjoy B5 is because of the tight integration of the story. There are things that happen in season 1 that don't get resolved until season 5. And it was by design.   The story is much bigger than the characters. It's really an opera.  Star Trek is about exploring ""out there"" and seeing the wonder and mystery of the universe, in an attempt to understand ourselves better.  B5 is about a particular place and time, and the people who moved through it and what happened to them. It's the center of a wheel of giant spinning cosmic opera and you'll get to see the center of it and the people who happen to be there and take part in it.  There's no reason not to give it shot, although I will warn you that the first season of B5 is uneven. But it is recommended to view it, since so much of what is explored comes back later. S2 is just amazeballs.   Best of luck!"
babylon5,2w4dml,Parev00,0,Mon Feb 16 22:17:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting perspective, but I have to admit it makes me wonder how much of Star Trek you have watched. DS9 was not about exploring ""out there"" and the shows are actually so similar that fans of both groups accuse the other of co-opting (read: ripping off) whatever show they happen to like. In fact, the similarities are so striking that B5 has an entry in the Star Trek Wiki, here is a list of the similarities. Check out the page for more, but it definitely seems as if DS9 and B5 are similar enough to cause some ... consternation between fans.  set on space stations near space transit point – the Bajoran wormhole for DS9, a jumpgate for B5 head of station has rank of commander – Benjamin Sisko, Jeffrey Sinclair     commander carries trauma from recent war or battle – Battle of Wolf 359, Battle of the Line/Earth-Minbari War  female second-in-command – Kira Nerys, Laurel Takashima in ""The Gathering"", later replaced by Susan Ivanova     second-in-command fending off attack on station at pilot's climax  station contains a casino/bar and a central marketplace area for commercial activity – the Promenade, the Zócalo station visitors include diplomats, merchants, smugglers, and other travelers pilot episode features a character who changes shape or appearance – Odo, Minbari Assassin using a changeling net.    I am thinking of giving B5 a try because I've heard it executes the ideas better than DS9. I want to hear from fans who have watched BOTH series and can explain what made B5 better...."
babylon5,2w4dml,Parev00,13,Mon Feb 16 22:54:36 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Seen all the shows. Love ST, in fact, I go to the con every year in Las Vegas.  These similarities just don't mean much in the grand scheme of things. They are just very different shows. Here's a point of comparison for you. There's a story that goes like this: Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and the boy dies. That's Romeo & Juliet, and also King Kong. They just have nothing to do with each other.   I am aware that there is a religious war out there between these two ""sides"" but I find it just makes no sense. While there are some similarities in the set-up of the shows, it's just not worthwhile to compare them in this manner.   I think if you give the first few episodes a shot, you'll see that B5 has a different take on things. But it may not float your boat, which is OK too. Best of luck to you!"
babylon5,2w4dml,JangoF76,5,Mon Feb 16 23:09:32 2015 UTC,"I've watched both and I completely agree with the previous guy. The similarities between the two are circumstantial. It's the feel, atmosphere and execution that make the two shows different. You'll understand if you watch B5.  B5 does not execute ideas better than DS9 because the ideas are different. DS9 is about a straight up war between two super powers, whereas B5 is more about the entire galaxy pulling together out of necessity to overcome a merciless foe that simply wants to destroy everything (think Mass Effect).   Now i love B5. The overarching story is great, but I have to say that the production quality, acting, script-writing and SFX all kinda suck ass compared with DS9, especially in the first season. B5 had a much smaller budget than Star Trek and it really shows.  At the end of the day, the only way you're going to know if B5 is for you is to watch it."
babylon5,2w4dml,Lettershort,4,Mon Feb 16 23:13:35 2015 UTC,"Babylon 5 was very much about two warring superpowers. The Shadows weren't the only bad guys in the fight... you'll remember a certain First One asking another race to leave, too. Hell, in a lot of ways, the Vorlons were worse. Both races destroyed entire planets, whole races in their fight for control, but the Vorlons messed with the evolutions of many races to get telepaths to fight on THEIR side of the disagreement over how to 'watch over' the baby races in the galaxy. The Vorlons also programmed basically all the baby races to 'respond favorably' to seeing them--that's why Kosh was seen as a deific being when he rescued Sheridan after the transport tube exploded. As Lorien put it, it was basically two parents fighting over how to raise a child--and the Shadows (chaos and evolution) and Vorlons (order and obedience) knocked everything else over and broke a ton of stuff on the way. Kosh was an exception in the Vorlons--people forget that, I think. While ""they are all Kosh"" they are NOT all like the Kosh we knew. Kosh was the oddball."
babylon5,2w4dml,DarrenGrey,5,Tue Feb 17 05:50:00 2015 UTC,"Babylon 5 wasn't ""about"" that though. It didn't feature that heavily, and mostly we see manipulation in the background. It's much more about politics than war, and with that all of the political intrigue of the various factions at work.  This is where it really differs from Star Trek for me. The political depth of B5 is far beyond any Star Trek series. In particular we see multiple factions within factions, whilst most ST races are pretty homogeneous. When Star Trek wants to explore a new idea they invent a new race that gets encountered - in B5 they tend to show a new side to an existing race instead."
babylon5,2w4dml,Lettershort,1 point,Tue Feb 17 12:44:20 2015 UTC,"The Shadow War was basically the first 3 1/2 seasons of the show. So while it wasn't always in the forefront of the action, it was still very much an integral part of the show.  That said, Babylon 5 wasn't just about the Shadow War, no. That's a huge part of its beauty and genius. Even when Babylon 5 is about one thing, it's about a dozen others, too. The smallest plot element, critical as it may be, is just a single layer in the onion (to borrow the analogy from Shrek, of all places) that is Babylon 5. Watching how everything comes together is a great part of watching the show--even after nearly a dozen times in."

The technomages are just members of the lesser races who have been ""gifted"" with shadow technology.  The Shadows are hoping that the ""You were not ready"" gift would corrupt the recipients and cause death and devastation.  Only through the actions of a few initial technomages (weirden and some of her ilk) would the Circle be formed, the Technomage's code instituted, and the mages turned from Chaos to order.  Unfortunately doing so also clouded the technomages origins and watered down the effects and power of their initial spells.  That is, until one mage decided to dig a little deeper than most...."
babylon5,2w4dml,Lettershort,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:52:20 2015 UTC,"Be that as it may, the Shadows' ""manipulation"" was technological--they gave tech. The Vorlons literally altered the genetic makeup of races and ultimately caused the races of these other races to see them as deities. That's some pretty crazy stuff. Not saying the Shadows weren't bad guys--they were awful--but the Vorlons were just way sneakier about how they 'kicked over the anthills'."
babylon5,2w4dml,ademnus,3,Sun Feb 22 06:07:47 2015 UTC,The writing on b5 is superb. Plot seeds sown in the first season bear fruit worth waiting for down the road. The first season is rough and low budget with some bad acting but persevere; as soon as season 2 starts it's like a whole new show.
babylon5,2w4dml,MattBD,3,Tue Feb 17 05:01:16 2015 UTC,"B5 generally had a stronger overarching plot than DS9 - virtually everything that happened had consequences down the line.  B5 also took a lot more risks than DS9 did, and it was refreshingly different at times - in one episode, at one point where the commander says anyone who doesn't want to participate in a risky action can leave their post, someone does leave their post, and they mentioned on the commentary that this never happened in ST.  Finally, with the benefit of hindsight, B5 broke the mould. At the time, there was an attitude in television that there was only room for one space opera series, and that was Star Trek. B5 proved that there was room for more than one, and off the back of that we got Firefly, Farscape, Lexx, Battlestar Galactica and the whole Stargate franchise."
babylon5,2w4dml,burried_digger,5,Tue Feb 17 13:34:13 2015 UTC,"I was a teenager when both shows were on the air. Despite being in love with ST: TNG and sooooo excited for another ST show, I couldn't stick with DS9. I watched maybe a season or two and quit. But I always liked B5. B5 is one of the shows I name as one of my all-time favorites whenever the subject comes up.   Many years later I would come back and watch all of DS9 and enjoy it. But I agree there is not much to like about the characters. I probably liked Garak most of all, and he was just a supporting character.   What appeals to me most about B5 is the novel-like structure of it. Plots and character arcs span multiple seasons, and their resolutions are very satisfying. Season 1 can at times be boring and tacky, but seasons 2-4 are amazing, and you would probably regret not having watched season 1 first."
babylon5,2w4dml,RogueWedge,5,Tue Feb 17 00:00:49 2015 UTC,"Just try it for yourself, they are different. Considering it was made what 15-20 years ago, the graphics still hold well and the characters have depth. Admittedly you have to grind through some of season 1. Get the B5 movie collection and start with the pilot double episode movie. Do not watch the rest of movies just yet. Then watch season 1-5 & then go back to the movies.  Also B5 has Bester (Walter Koenig) so you could claim your watching him (& therefore ST and not defecting)  I'd like to see a thread of what you think of B5 as you watch."
babylon5,2w4dml,nolo_me,5,Tue Feb 17 01:15:05 2015 UTC,"Why should a die hard Trekkie defect and check things out?   Some other die-hard Trekkies (and Trekkers) who thought it was worth not only checking out, but appearing in: Majel Barrett-Roddenberry, Dwight Schultz, Walter Koenig, Patricia Tallman. Other guest stars included Sam Neill, William Sanderson, Brad Dourif, Penn & Teller and many others; Harlan Ellison served as technical consultant for the entire run. Edit: oh, and Adam Nimoy directed a couple of episodes.   One of the things I've always loved about B5 is that it's a lot more gritty and real than the Trek universe. They haven't dispensed with money, there are no transporters or replicators and there's no perfect holier-then-thou Federation. Humanity is a newcomer to galactic politics and is still beset by the same infighting, internal politics and pettiness that we're all too familiar with. There's unemployment, petty crime and slums. There's moral ambiguity and characters who grow on you and with you: you'll find yourself feeling for them even as they commit war crimes and make questionable decisions.  You'll have to make allowances for some of the CGI, especially in the first season: while it may look a little ropey nowadays it's worth remembering that it was state of the art at the time.  The five-year story arc was planned out in advance (though there was a little reshuffling due to possible cancellation) and while there are monster-of-the-week scenarios, everything from news headlines overheard in passing to little throwaway comments between regulars ties into the overarching story.   TL;DR it's essential viewing for any sci-fi fan, with a pedigree as long as your arm."

(won't repeat what others have said hopefully)  Probably a much more realistic vision of humanities place the universe compared to other alien races (hint: we are certainly not the strongest/most advanced)  The show is much more substantial, deeper and gritty than any Star Trek Series and a lot more adult orientated (anyone else remember how Molari cheats at cards?!?!?!) And much more satisfying as a result.  Think Picard and Janeway had it tough fighting the Borg? Wait till you see The Shadows! Like big space battles? There's lots of them.  If you can grind your way most of the first season (which does give a few tastes of things coming later) you'll love Babylon 5"

You WILL like Babylon 5 if you give it a chance (at least into season 2).  It's got great writing, a fantastic plot that is constantly built on and developed from as early as the pilot episode, and very likeable interesting characters.

Chiefly, I find the characters vapid and unlikable   Vapid? Compared to TNG's one-dimensional characters? And they weren't all meant to be immediately likeable; that was half the point.   and the show is very out of place in the Star Trek universe.    Again, that was the point. DS9 was supposed to be the anti-Star Trek; it was supposed to break almost every cardinal rule that coked-out hack hamstrung TNG with, turning it in to little more than a kid's show that was carried by only the masterful performance of one thespian. Oy vey.  And what you know of or think about ST should have no bearing on what you get out of B5. Comparisons serve no good purpose. If you like today's long-format, complexly-written cable dramas (or early precursors like Twin Peaks); a strong, unadulterated authorial vision; are open to the space opera setting; and can tolerate a lot of cheese, occasional sloppy plot contrivances, questionable production values, and uniformly horrible episodes throughout the first half of the first season, you should get something out of B5.  That said, if your expectations are dead-set on hollow suits sipping tea while pondering the mystery of the week from a comfortable chair, patronising morality plays, and everything sorting itself out in 44 minutes or less, you've probably handicapped yourself to the point of ruining B5 for yourself."

babylon5,2vmd8v,bootsorhearts,2,Thu Feb 12 21:18:17 2015 UTC,"It is the single most fiddly game I have ever played. And I love it for it.  This is the stat card, or Ship Control Sheet ('SCS') for an average ship.  All the little boxes? Those are the hit points. For each system. The numbers in the circle? That's each system's armour.  The 'turn cost' under 'maneuvering'? That's how many points of thrust you have to spend in order to change one hex facing. The thrust you spend has to be distributed through the thrusters (you want to turn left, you have to thrust out the right side, and the front or back). The thrusters are the rectangles with the batman ears on the front, sides and aft of the ship (the 'icon recognition' in the bottom corner is the key to the symbols).  If your thrusters get shot off, you may not be able to turn, accelerate or decelerate anymore. If your weapons get shot off, you can't fight. If your reactor gets shot off, you explode. Whole sides of your ship can just fall off when the structure (the unnamed hit boxes in each section) gets destroyed.  The thrust that goes through the thrusters? They're generated by the engine (the number on the icon is how many you have to play with). Need more thrust?  You have to spend energy (generated by the reactor), paying the 'engine efficiency' under the 'combat stats.'  Most of everything has to be powered by the reactor as well, any of the numbers in a diamond on the thing are how much energy that system takes to operate. If your reactor takes damage, it generates less power, and you have to turn stuff off every turn.  It's beautiful, but can take a very, very long time to finish a turn.  There's a huge custom community that has generated thousands of additional ships for the game that can be viewed at the Vault. The Star Trek ships done by Tyrel Lohr are particularly good. As are the Freespace ships.  You want to fight the USS Enterprise, a Shivan Dreadnought and a Shadow Battlecrab against a Borg Cube and a Star Destroyer? It's the game for you. If you have an hour to resolve each turn.  If someone were to make a fully computer assisted version of the game, including all the alternate ships, it would be amazing."

So basically he was working with EA"
babylon5,2uwdsj,flavioxavier,1 point,Thu Feb 5 23:12:58 2015 UTC,"I just watched this episode.

The truth is that when Sheridan was wheeled into that other room to be ""executed"" himself, I was expecting the hooded figure to actually be one of his allies there to help him and was shocked to see that it was the Drazi ""prisoner"" he thought that he had helped a little while earlier.  That was such a brutally intense episode.  Anybody notice that that the interrogator was played by ""Pap Smear"" from the Naked Gun movies?  LOL"

You have to realize the 90's were a far different time for TV production than we have now. The syndication market for original series allowed shows to make money in very different markets on a station by station basis. Because most broadcasts were entirely regionally controlled. So the ratings didn't have to be too great (not like today). Just good enough for the markets to continue to pay for it. And in markets where it didn't do good the stations could just dump it as a filler on late night.  To be honest there were A LOT of terrible syndicated series in the 90's. B5's less than stellar first season looks like Shakespeare compared to them. Which I'm sure helped programming directors in deciding to keep it."
babylon5,2ug8um,thegenregeek,3,Mon Feb 2 00:06:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tend to forget how bad TV sci fi in the 90s generally was.

babylon5,2ug8um,laskinonthebeach,4,Mon Feb 2 04:59:53 2015 UTC,Well Season 1 has a lot of clunkers for sure.  But Sinclair gets a bad rap by many.  I think he did a great job with the character and obviously brought his own demons to the role of a man with demons.
babylon5,2ug8um,thegenregeek,3,Mon Feb 2 06:19:56 2015 UTC,"I never got that, really! I loved season one!"
babylon5,2ug8um,Eurynom0s,3,Mon Feb 2 07:47:06 2015 UTC,"I have never understood the hate for season one. Sinclair just has the most melodic, soothing voice.   What I realized a long time ago is that that is the problem. Sinclair was so self confident and sure of who he as a person there was no arc left for him. He could walk in and calm a room by talking without over emoting. At most there were a few moments where the character had doubts about something episode specific, but there wasn't enough to really grow for the overall arc.  This is not as solid an idea as it sounds on paper for a series about the galaxy falling into chaos and anarchy. You need someone willing to never back down from a fight, but also to have the fish out of water angle of figuring out who he is in the grand scheme of things and struggling with his own fallibility. (And Sinclair, in his monotone delivery could never really project that fallibility.)  This is ultimately why Sheridan was a better option (and thereby better liked) for viewers. (Which is in no way meant to knock Michael O'Hare in any way.) Sheridan comes in and first thing he does is start a ""golly gee whiz"" tour of the station. Then he spends the next year or so getting past that and embrace his inner tactician and leader. By the end he's much closer to Sinclair than I think people realize.  So, I don't think it's really hate for Sinclair. It's that he was planned for where the series was going to go, before people realized what that mean, and felt out of place. Especially to people more used to Picard and Kirk. He basically was too early for the story and the audience couldn't cope.  (This is also why his character really clicks when he returns. At that point he is the right character in the right time and place.)"
babylon5,2ug8um,-Icaria-,1 point,Tue Feb 3 05:09:30 2015 UTC,"I don't get it either. It's only ""bad"" in the sense that seasons 2-4 are amazing. I guess I could see being anxious to get to season 2 if you know what's coming but I very much enjoyed season 1 my first time through.  Also, I have to wonder how similar to what we actually got Sinclair's arc in the later seasons would have been under JMS's plan A for not having to move to Sheridan...because from what we got, it actually makes sense that Sinclair was a little wooden. Dude's walking around with a huge burden on his shoulders that he can't tell anyone about."
babylon5,2ug8um,mnlg,0,Sun Feb 8 06:01:03 2015 UTC,"Having only watched B5 for the first time last year, the only way I was able to get through the first half of season one was by literally napping through it. It was just the most generic, unambitious, low-brow sci-fi schlock possible.  By By Any Means Necessary, the writing begins to improve. The characters are less cartoonish and shallow, they begin to become a bigger focus than the situation of the week, and we begin to see the first murmurings of continuity beyond ""there's a hole in your mind"" being repeated ad nauseam.  I wouldn't say the writing ever reaches brilliance but the cohesive story and vision for the show is what really carries B5. If you've seen B5 before, it can be difficult to remember what it was like going in to the series in the dark, before the characters were established or even likeable, when the show consisted of little more than middling self-contained episodes. If not for the people who had seen the whole series encouraging me to stick with it, I never would have made it to the good stuff.  And the main protagonist really didn't help. Sinclair had no dramatic range; he just sort of floated in to frame, delivered his lines deadpan, and had the thousand-yard stare of someone who had seen some serious shit. Of course, it turns out that he was seeing some serious shit due to what was likely undiagnosed schizophrenia (I do have some morbid curiosity as to what it would be like losing your mind while on a space station sound stage, surrounded by people dressed as aliens, I have to admit) and it had a very real impact on the quality of the first season."
babylon5,2ug8um,FrodoFraggins,3,Mon Feb 2 15:03:35 2015 UTC,Really briefly. Had a bit more screen time in S3.
babylon5,2ug8um,Stile4aly,2,Mon Feb 2 13:08:25 2015 UTC,Actually one of the main reasons it gets better for me is that Sinclair left. That guy was just the worst actor. He reminded me of Lesley Nielson in Naked Gun but without trying to be funny. A single facial expression and wooden monotone delivery. It was really distracting.
babylon5,2ug8um,dylzim,3,Mon Feb 2 08:08:04 2015 UTC,to each their own.  He was introverted and introspective.  I found Boxleitner to be too goofy early on.  Yes he did get better but his romance with Delenn was horribly done.  No chemistry at all.  the guy lacks gravitas.
babylon5,2ug8um,dbutlerjr,5,Mon Feb 2 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"Season 1's problem is that it does too good a job of fooling the audience into thinking it's just another standard sci-fi show.  It's only upon rewatch that you catch the clues which lead up to the ""what the hell was that"" moment in Signs and Portents.  Overall, I think it gets unfairly maligned, but that doesn't change the fact that the show gets a whole lot better once the arc picks up."
babylon5,2ug8um,dylzim,4,Mon Feb 2 07:08:43 2015 UTC,"Season 1 is also laying down an absolute ton of prep-work, essentially, for what follows. You have to establish who the characters, you have to convince us to care about them, and you have to take your time, or else the WHAM that happens late season 2 through the end of season 4 doesn't hit nearly as hard."

We just did ""Signs and Portents"" and she's slowly getting reeled in.  We are also starting a slow first time watch of Game of Thrones and are on S2 and enjoying the slowly unfurling storylines of that show as well.

babylon5,2tw4hs,joelincoln,5,Wed Jan 28 01:42:17 2015 UTC,"The problem with the Markab planet (and I asked JMS this question at a panel many years ago) is all of the dead bodies (millions if not billions) that are lying around there. No real way of cleaning them up.   Plus the jumpgate was destroyed, so no easy way to get back there."
babylon5,2tw4hs,bobchin_c,7,Tue Jan 27 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"Why couldn't the alliance give the telepaths their own planet?   It wasn't a matter of space. It was a matter of politics.  What Byron was trying to do was get the the Interstellar Alliance to grant them a planet AND gaurantee their safety from reprisals of member ISA civilizations. Which the ISA could not do without creating a constitutional crisis. After all, the ISA does not have the legal right to govern other worlds, it's power is derived from the authority granted to them by member worlds (which includes the EA).  The ISA had a constitutional responsibility/agreement/rule that guarantees every species' right to govern their people. Bester specifically points this out when he shows up on Babylon 5, to grab Byron's telepaths, which was under ISA ownership. As EA citizens the ISA had no legal right to deny a member civilization access to it's people. (If they did they could just let the telepaths live on B5)  Even if the ISA give all telepaths a homeworld, it had no legal right to force member civilizations to respect the planet as sovereign territory. There would be no teeth to the idea of it as a sovereign world (for telepaths), beyond the ISA claiming it was. Not without force and the risk of a war on the matter.   Simply giving them a world would not be enough, the ISA would also have to commit, potentially, to offering security forces and/or military resources to keeping races away. Something no member race would ever to agree to. After all it could lead to their own citizens being outside of their control or assistance.  Without protection the second the world was founded the PsiCorp could just walk in and start abducting people, who were violating the laws of the Earth Alliance, under ISA law. As any other race could do with members of their own species too (depending on the laws and culture of that member race).  This is also why Babylon 5 was forced to turn over the telepaths in the first place. EarthGov signed an agreement, in good faith, when they joined the ISA. An agreement that gauranteed the ISA would respect the laws and sovereignty of it's member races. If the ISA ignored that it would be a breech of trust. It would give Earth, and conversely any member race, the right to simply walk out of the ISA for abandoning it's word.  This is why Sheridan backs down when dealing with the ISA's desire to attack a certain other member world. He is not the ruler of the ISA, at best he is a guide. He has as much power as the ISA member races are willing to give him. And all of those member races have their own agenda's and objectives.  Of course when Byron's pulls his stunt you can be sure the only power the ISA wants Sheridan to have is the ability to protect them from rogue telepaths that just stole their state secrets. At that point the ISA's marching orders for Sheridan were to eliminate any risk of the telepaths becoming a legimate political force the ISA would need to contend with.   Surely there were some out there?   It wasn't a matter of space. It was a matter of politics. The act of giving them a world would create a lot more problems. (Stated above)   What about the markab planet, that was deserted.   As pointed out elsewhere there is no easy access to the sector, given it's jump gate was destroyed (and given the energy released I'd question if it didn't effect the planet's eco system). Even then, using my point about authority, the ISA could not stop other races from sending forces to reclaim their people. The PsiCorp could just sent a jump capable ship into the area and they could grab whomever they wanted. (Assuming the ISA declared it neutral space)."
babylon5,2tw4hs,thegenregeek,3,Wed Jan 28 03:04:15 2015 UTC,"Similar reason for why Guantanamo Bay couldn't be shut down... nobody would accept the prisoners.  Also, once the telepaths forced the issue, they lost all of their goodwill from the alliance."
babylon5,2tw4hs,FellKnight,2,Tue Jan 27 22:49:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, there were plenty of planets the telepaths could be settled on, but need to disagree in regards to why the ISA didnt really help the telepaths.  To be honest, it would't have been hard to give them a planet that was remote, and to have 2-3 white stars guard the planet.  In many ways, the ISA was essentially already doing something similar with its ranger training bases, which were on remote planets that were guarded with only a few ships.  I suspect the real issue is the danger that a free telepath colony would've represented.  A planet where people with extraordinary powers could roam wild, without control, and could be used as weapons by any side that was willing to pay the highest price.   Every single civilized empire had rules to make sure that people with pyschic abilities couldnt abuse them, which wouldn't be the case if telepaths had their own planet."

babylon5,2to5sk,Chicken2nite,1 point,Mon Jan 26 02:50:30 2015 UTC,"The novelization of In The Beginning is worth reading as well.  Peter David, the author of the trilogy and the writer of several B5 episodes, wrote it, and the fact that it is a story told by Londo is played up in the book.    A scene that comes to mind that wasn't in the tv movie was the first meeting of Sheridan and Sinclair that neither of them remember, iirc considering that I haven't read it for well over a decade."
babylon5,2to5sk,kithkill,2,Wed Feb 11 01:15:49 2015 UTC,"I loved the Psi Corps trilogy. I always thought it was a story that could have been lifted from the B5 mythos and done as a standalone story, or TV show, or whatever. The basic premise - how do humans react to the sudden appearance of people who can read minds - is a fascinating one, and even though these books were fun, they never really scratched the surface of all the crazy ideas.  What made them great was the entire tragedy around Bester - where he came from, and his ultimate fate. I could read and re-read these.  The Centauri trilogy was also brilliant, but I kind of expect that from Peter David. Londo is one of my favourite characters, and getting to see the events between the end of Season 5 and the time of ""Sleeping in the Light"" felt like scratching an itch I'd felt since we last said goodbye to him.  The Technomage trilogy had some great ideas, but I cared less about the characters, factions etc. I suspect I'd have cared more if we'd seen future B5 TV series take off. I enjoyed it for what it was, but it's definitely third on my list."

babylon5,2t1755,YeOldeMuppetPastor,3,Tue Jan 20 17:06:43 2015 UTC,This raises the question of what's going on with the hair and that bone?  Is that thing a solid extension of the skull?  Does Delenn have what amounts to a very classy mullet (shortish on top and straight long off the back) Or is there like a hair way in the crest??
babylon5,2t1755,cRaZyDaVe23,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"I imagine it as that maybe the bone has a small gap between the bone and her scalp. The only places it connects to her skull are on the sides of her minbari noggin.  So, if she wasn't careful when grooming, the long hair would have to be tucked back under that bone to join the rest of her long hairs. Emerging from her chrysalis made her go from bald- to 'classy mullet.'"
babylon5,2t1755,ParadoxPixie,2,Tue Jan 20 19:48:16 2015 UTC,I imagine it as that maybe the bone has a small gap between the bone and her scalp.   Must be something like this. She had a ponytail with all the hair above the bone several times but usually has all of her hair below the bone. So there must be a way to transfer the hair from above to below the bone.

I actually got to ask JMS a few questions about B5's main races at rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 and got answers. Later on, I started the ""You Know You've Been Watching Babylon 5 Too Much When..."" list and got JMS's permission to include an entry he came up with himself.  I was there when he had to stop posting in rastb5 because of imbecile trolls, and I voted FOR the creation of rastb5.moderated.  The main thing was that we could ask him questions. There were some rules to be followed and people (minus the subhuman trolls) would follow them. We could send private answers to JMS and he would answer (I'm sure not all of them, but still)."
babylon5,2t0o56,mfarah,2,Tue Jan 20 12:16:07 2015 UTC,That's pretty amazing.  I don't know of to many other shows where that kind of thing happened.  You got to wonder how JMS found the time to interact in that way while working on an all-consuming project like B5.  How long was JMS doing that?  Did it continue through all 5 years?
babylon5,2t0o56,mfarah,1 point,Tue Jan 20 15:46:09 2015 UTC,"How long was JMS doing that? Did it continue through all 5 years?   Since before B5 was named B5, and all the way through the end, and then some.  The day they filmed the last S5 scene (where Sheridan and Delenn leave the station and a crowd of people are there to watch them), they set up a computer connected to the official B5 chat, where an (in modern terms) the op was liveupdating what was happenning. A couple minutes after the last scene was done, JMS sat at the computer and sent us a quick message thanking all of us for being there, etcetera.  I used to have the log of that chat, but lost it a few years ago. :-("
babylon5,2t0o56,replayer,1 point,Tue Jan 20 15:50:27 2015 UTC,Can you think of an example where the online community (or maybe you) came up with an idea that JMS ended-up using?

I can't remember the exact quote so this is just paraphrasing:   The network executives at TNT told me they wanted to add a ""hot-shot pilot"" kind of character to attract more viewers. For the most part they left me alone but this one they just wouldn't let go. As soon as I gave in, we casted the role and wrote him into the show, and I said to myself ""I'm gonna kill him."" That kind of character has no place in this show.  Sure enough, as soon as they stopped looking over my shoulder, I killed him off. Sorry Keffer, but you were doomed from the start."

babylon5,2t0en4,joelincoln,3,Tue Jan 20 04:04:27 2015 UTC,"No probs.  Not sure about Na'Toth. Every ambassador had a ""sidekick"" i.e. assistant and G'Kar was a fan favorite, but he did well as a loner. It wasn't contractual obligations because the character was played by multiple actresses and the main actress also appeared as Sheridan's lawyer (Gwenivere Corey)."
babylon5,2t0en4,lolzergrush,5,Tue Jan 20 04:10:29 2015 UTC,"Na'Toth was an unrealized ""trapdoor"".   One of the risks of having a 5 year plan is that the actors might need to leave partway through, so JMS designed the show such that any of the lead actors were replaceable. For Sinclair and Ivanova he could just pull the ""let's ship someone else in from Earthforce"" story, and likewise with Lyta/Talia and PsyCorps, but with the ambassadors he apparently wanted an established character who could just step in."
babylon5,2t0en4,philwelch,4,Tue Jan 20 05:15:55 2015 UTC,"That's true, but it could be said of Lennier and Vir as well. However those two were very important and well-developed characters that played roles in the central arcs and had their own character arcs as well.  Not sure why but Na'Toth just disappeared into thin air, then had a brief appearance as a prisoner. With the Narn/Centauri war there was a lot they could have done with her, especially with her tough attitude and G'Kar's diplomacy role in getting the League organized to fight the Shadows.   Maybe they were just afraid she'd detract too much from the existing storyline. The show was brilliant and if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
babylon5,2t0en4,lolzergrush,6,Tue Jan 20 05:22:32 2015 UTC,"Little late, but wanted to jump in. I always suspected the G'Kar's trapdoor changed from Na'Toth to the guy who always carried the sword (can't remember his name). In the third and fourth seasons you see him in the background and helping to solidify support for G'Kar among the Narns and he's thoughtful in a way like G'Kar is."

babylon5,2t0en4,lolzergrush,3,Thu Jan 22 18:58:07 2015 UTC,Ta'Lon. Kinda liked the guy.
babylon5,2t0en4,NorwegianViking86,5,Wed Jan 28 16:23:47 2015 UTC,Gwenivere Corey   I think her name is Julie Caitlin Brown.  She also had a couple of appearances in Star Trek.
babylon5,2t0en4,joelincoln,2,Tue Jan 20 04:16:31 2015 UTC,"I saw JCB at a con, and she said she was just not linking spending time in the character makeup."
babylon5,2t0en4,clawclawbite,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"That sounds right. Gwenivere Corey (sp?) was the character name but she did a lot of other roles on the show as well, often as a female alien."
babylon5,2t0en4,lolzergrush,3,Tue Jan 20 04:37:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'd call either character 'redundant'... maybe unnecessary or unsuccessful.  Like Londo and Delenn, and even Kosh, the Ambassadors had assistants.  So, too G'Kar.  But, Na'Toth never got much to do.  I think that was a result of the writing.  They didn't have enough time per episode to develop her character or decided not to for one reason or another.    Warren, too, could fall into this category of writing decisions.  But, I don't think the actor ever really 'clicked' with the show or the fans.  It's possible that MJS always considered the character to be cannon fodder.  Can anyone else shed some light on this?"
babylon5,2t0en4,joelincoln,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:22:01 2015 UTC,It's just both of these characters just didn't seem to fit in anywhere on the show. They barely appeared in a season that they were supposed to be a part of the main cast in. It was just... unusual. The closest thing I can relate it to is Cirroc Lofton's role in Deep Space Nine.
babylon5,2t0en4,Triplanetary,2,Tue Jan 20 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"They barely appeared in a season that they were supposed to be a part of the main cast in.    Yeah, I distinctly remember the first time I saw the show, and halfway through the second season I suddenly noticed that there was a title credit for a guy and I no frikken clue who he was. :P"
babylon5,2t0en4,DaEvil1,2,Wed Jan 21 00:43:01 2015 UTC,"Warren was added in due to studio pressure, and JMS killed him off as soon as he could, Na'Toth probably had a bigger arc in mind, but the first actress quit after the first season because she didn't like dealing with all the makeup required, and the second actress didn't work out I think, so she basically vanished, but the original actress agreed to come back for a one off episode, to deal with what happened to her and sort of close off her never-realized character arc."
babylon5,2t0en4,joelincoln,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:16:28 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean about Jake, but he had a lot more to do than these two characters in B5... in fact Jake's character was involved in one of the most beloved episodes, ""The Visitor"".  There are plenty of examples of characters that were out of place and superfluous in any number of shows.  It's just part of the game."
babylon5,2t0en4,zomb3h,1 point,Tue Jan 20 04:13:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I guess I just expected actors considered to be in ""the main cast"" to have their characters appear a lot more often."
babylon5,2t0en4,mfarah,1 point,Tue Jan 20 04:15:19 2015 UTC,"Apparently the actress that played Na'Toth auditioned well, however once she starting doing the role she played the character kinda of quiet and withdrawn from G'kar and she sorted faded into the background.  Hearing this I can almost see all the people acting there heart out to get more camera time."
babylon5,2t0en4,NorwegianViking86,2,Tue Jan 20 09:47:00 2015 UTC,"That was the second address to play Na'Toth, not JCB."
babylon5,2t0en4,mfarah,2,Tue Jan 20 13:56:43 2015 UTC,"Yea. As I understand it she wanted to take the character in a new direction, a softer version of Na'Toth than JMS wanted, so he got rid of her. I think of JCB as the 'real' Na'Toth."

babylon5,2sgcw9,DarrenGrey,2,Fri Jan 16 11:56:14 2015 UTC,that may have been where i got the sounds in the first place! All the Bab5 websites are like geocities relics now. I remember that I could only find wav files

babylon5,2s120x,mexter,3,Sun Jan 11 13:33:50 2015 UTC,I agree. I've thought (since the first game) that ME is the B5 game I never knew I wanted. So much so that I almost feel like the Reapers had to be inspired by the Shadows.
babylon5,2s120x,jacobi123,2,Wed Jan 14 07:27:52 2015 UTC,It's a shame the mass effect ending was the single most disappointing thing I've experienced in entertainment. And that includes the BSG reboot. Ruining a hundred hours of gameplay in 10 minutes is an amazing accomplishment.
babylon5,2s120x,GhrabThaar,1 point,Wed Jan 14 21:11:27 2015 UTC,I was late finishing the game and saw all the headlines popping up about the ending then the promised DLC to fix it. So I ended up only playing the fixed ending. This one! :P  SPOILERS if you haven't seen all of B5. SPOILER SPOILER ... there I said it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tj4qfe9afs
babylon5,2s120x,kengou,2,Wed Jan 14 21:50:39 2015 UTC,I tried but the gameplay in ME1 just did not work for me.  I was expecting something like Knights of the Old Republic and instead got Gears of War.  I also found the story fairly predictable...  But that's just my opinion.  Apparently a ton of people love it...

babylon5,2s120x,kengou,-1,Tue Jan 13 03:14:37 2015 UTC,Oh Yes. Queen snore Liara is far more interesting.  We might have to agree to disagree.
babylon5,2s120x,mexter,2,Tue Jan 13 03:29:16 2015 UTC,"There are definitely predictable affects to the story, but did you make it all the way through? They drop a couple of twists later on.  Game play is a lot more fluid in the later games, although I personally like part 1 the best."
babylon5,2s0lhl,StarFuryG7,2,Sun Jan 11 01:01:30 2015 UTC,I think he liked it...  :-)
babylon5,2s0lhl,joelincoln,2,Sun Jan 11 02:03:28 2015 UTC,"A few things worth pointing out about his review though .  .  .   Sinclair was a Commander, not a Captain. I found his taste with regard to the Stargate television franchise quite questionable. He loved SG-1 for example. I didn't, and stopped watching the show before it left Showtime (although their direct-to-DVD followup, 'Stargate Continuum' wasn't bad, which I did happen to catch). And he didn't care for the spinoffs, whereas I got pretty into SGU and was downright pissed once it got canceled by the end of its second season. Clearly he wasn't familiar with any of the background regarding 'Crusade' and all the interference with the show by TNT executives, which was why it had so many creative problems and ended up canceled before it even premiered, which he did know interestingly enough, with that being about it though apparently."
babylon5,2s0lhl,tanajerner,2,Sun Jan 11 04:30:42 2015 UTC,I guess he went on how he enjoyed watching it. Which is fair. No point in getting into the politics side of the show if it's for a casual viewer

babylon5,2rv6yw,quintus_aurelianus,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:45:06 2015 UTC,I didn't feel like the character was using the phrase ironically; he was seeking peace for Earth and he believed the treaty with the Centauri would bring it. The story however did use the phrase ironically.
babylon5,2rv6yw,SilverHawk7,1 point,Sat Jan 10 16:32:56 2015 UTC,"No, the character was not using the phrase ironically.   That, I'm saying, is the problem.

It turned out great – my family (even the kids!) loved it, but I really think it's a bit of a personal taste thing because the mix of garlic-y, oily, salty flavours really isn't for everyone.  btw: It's especially good if you serve it with  Narn Naan bread."

It's a pretty great one, and pretty unique. I usually get pretty emo after that final episode. I'm really excited to watch the movies again though, even the soul hunter badness one.   Have you tried Farscape? It's mostly not as political or Lord of the Rings-ey as B5, but the character arcs are especially good. There is even an analog (Or few) to the G'Kar/Londo bromance that comes along. It often times feels very Firefly, or at least, what Firefly wanted to be."

It would have been even better had they been able to take their time with it."
babylon5,2qvvio,DKOB,1 point,Thu Jan 1 01:08:22 2015 UTC,"I finished a rewatch a week ago. It had been a good 10-15 years since I last saw it. I was really surprised that I enjoyed it a lot again. For me, the best part of the series is G'Kar and Londo's evolution throughout the seasons. They have this chemistry that reminds me of John and Scorpius from Farscape. The story is really good, though I wasn't a fan of the telepath arc on the first half of season 5. B5 remains one of my favourite series.  Then I watched some of the B5 movies. I found most of them boring. The pacing didn't feel right. The music didn't feel quite right either. I remember a few battle scenes where voices and sounds were removed, the camera would show one scene after another with only music. This happened in A Call to Arms, and the music they used during that silent battle scene didn't do justice to what was happening at the time.  Then I moved on to The Crusade. I watched a few episodes, then watched the rest in fast-forward. How did they go from the great series that was Babylon 5 to The Crusade??? It's like The Crusade had no budget. The soundtrack kills me. I realized quickly that one thing that didn't work for me was the lack of aliens. No Narn, no Centauri, no Pak'Ma'Ra or any other races really. There's a Minbari in the background of one episode... Every episode, I find that so very little is happening that I care about. It's a shame."
babylon5,2qvvio,zixkill,2,Thu Jan 1 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, TNT was more the problem with Crusade. I think it probably might've stood on its own, but at the end of the day it was still a Planet of the Week series and at the end of the day, that isn't the kind of show the existing fans wanted.   Then again, it sounds like they would've discovered the cure pretty quickly so not sure where the series would've gone."

I remember when I first went through and watched all of B5 it seemed like after every episode I was just like ""damn....this show is great"".   And agree about Londo in season 5. S5 definitely suffered from losing great characters (Ivanova, Marcus), having some characters turn into jerks (Garibaldi) / lose some morality (Lennier), and having some characters roles diminish (Londo)"

After that, there are some canon graphic novels as well, but i've never managed to get my hands on them, so i can't speak as to the quality.    There's also ""space, time, and the incurable romantic,"" written by JMS about Marcus, but that's even harder to track down.  You won't regret getting them.

babylon5,2qqp6w,chazwhiz,26,Mon Dec 29 20:14:16 2014 UTC,"I'm probably going to be hunted down by Reddit and shot for this, but I never had a problem with that episode. I think it underlines something very important; the idea that humans are seen as somehow separate and apart from all other alien races. That's a very important plot building block as the series moves forward - the adversarial, almost resentful nature of the relationship between Earth gov and the alien worlds, be they non-aligned or aligned. Normally in the show, we see things from a mostly human perspective as the command staff are all human. This gives us the impression that humans are in charge. With the mutai we see that aliens feel about humans the way many non-Americans feel about Americans. Brash, arrogant and undeserving of participation in the more spiritual, sacred traditions of their own cultures.  I also really enjoyed the character development for Ivanova, especially the brief glimpse we got into the existing cultural subgroups of humans on the station (in this case, Jews) when one comes together to comfort an individual they don't know. We rarely get to see beyond the sphere of the main characters and I always really enjoyed those episodes. The docker's strike was another one where you get to pull back from the zoomed in major plot driven story and see life on the station for people besides command & ambassadorial level characters. To me, this is what really sets Babylon 5 apart from any Star Trek series - being able to see the underbelly of the station (down below), as well as the blue collar people, the merchants, importers/exporters, etc. Even DS9 didn't get as much into that."
babylon5,2qqp6w,goodhumansbad,7,Mon Dec 29 20:39:31 2014 UTC,"I don't think TKO is terrible.  It's a little cheesy, but still less so than a lot of TNG or TOS or even early DS9.  I'll take TKO over Grail or Infection."
babylon5,2qqp6w,quintus_aurelianus,7,Mon Dec 29 21:13:16 2014 UTC,"The main plot of Grail (the seeker) I think is good in theory, albeit cheesy in delivery.  The secondary plot (the fake-kosh) has always bugged the crap out of me though, it's just no big deal to imitate a Vorlon encounter suit, not to mention domesticate a vicious predatory animal...   Infection feels off in retrospect, but as a before-the-arc-really-starts episode I don't think it feels out of place, just like generic alien-of-the-week scifi, could easily be a Star Trek episode."
babylon5,2qqp6w,bobchin_c,3,Mon Dec 29 21:22:55 2014 UTC,"Except Infection introduces IPX, Organic Technology and a couple of other things.  JMS didn't like the episode either (remember that it was the 1st one written and filmed) so those who hate it are in good company.  From my perspective I think Grey 17 is the worst of the series Though I love the Neroon/Delenn subplot."
babylon5,2qqp6w,gaph3r,1 point,Wed Dec 31 02:54:55 2014 UTC,"This is one of the things that has set Babylon 5 apart from other shows, for me at least. Even the episodes which I ranked the lowest (Grey 17 is Missing, Infection, TKO...) still had so much other great stuff in them, in many cases tied to one of the main story arcs, that it never really bothered me."

babylon5,2qqp6w,SilverHawk7,5,Mon Dec 29 23:05:58 2014 UTC,"I'm with /u/goodhumansbad and the others; I didn't mind TKO so much.  To me, the piece with Ivanova was the main takeaway. The Mutai piece seemed like something to just carry the rest of the episode, but to a certain degree it made sense to me.  Here you have this tradition that so many aliens are a part of, and then the Human tries to intrude; some of them are like ""you wouldn't understand,"" others are straight up ""you don't belong here and you never will..."" (like that one dude who does the most complaining).  The Muta'do (the judge) didn't give me the impression of rejecting him other than from the aspect of maintaining the tradition of the Mutai; the only way you get in is by doing so in accordance with those laws and traditions.    For me, the lowest episode in the series I think is probably Believers; I straight up skipped that episode during my last run through the show.  It's a little bit of development for Dr. Franklin, but little else."
babylon5,2qqp6w,Janzbane,1 point,Mon Dec 29 22:03:03 2014 UTC,"Oh man, I hate believers. I am very sick of the ""science versus religion"" debate. This episode is particularly nauseating because it paints the religion side so poorly. Granted i am a theistic evolutionist so i really dont see much reason for perpetuating the false dichotomy.  As bad as it is I can at least suffer through ""The Seeker."""
babylon5,2qqp6w,CoffeeAndCigars,2,Tue Dec 30 07:56:34 2014 UTC,"It paints the religion side so poorly because that sort of thing actually happens. I've witnessed it myself, as a paramedic. Life saving treatments for children refused because of religious nonsense.   The episode itself is bad mostly because Franklin should frankly be more acquainted with that phenomenon already, and is generally being a viewer stand-in acting and learning about the nonsense for the first time."
babylon5,2qqp6w,goodhumansbad,3,Tue Dec 30 12:20:07 2014 UTC,"I agree on the Ivanova plot absolutely. I really liked it as character development for her, I think it's one of the best early examples of why she is the way she is, you really see her as more than just ""angry tough as nails russian"" but as a flawed person with a reason for being so rigid.  And seeing the additional jewish community bit is a good point, I never really thought about why I liked those episodes that step down from just the command level people, but I do.  As for the Mutai part though, that Human vs Alien part is one I my biggest complaints about it - I agree with the importance of seeing the conflict, but why is it a 2-sided conflict?  Why are all the aliens united in the spirit of no-humans?  Anyone walks up and asks to join, they ask ""are you human?"",  ""no"", ""alright you're in"".  That bugs me and (IMO) greatly weakens the premise."
babylon5,2qqp6w,Goomich,5,Mon Dec 29 21:17:01 2014 UTC,"If I had to guess at why it's a two-sided conflict, I would say for the same reason the American/Non-American thing is: because in this case the humans hold a lot of the power on the station. They run it, albeit in conjunction with the Minbari, but they're the face of authority. Earth Alliance stomps around with the really big warships and guns and resources, but most importantly control of the rules.   The aliens might have numbers on their side, but the humans (or more specifically Earth Alliance) have bureaucracy - they can determine if your ship is allowed to dock and unload its cargo before it goes bad. They can determine what order the ships come in... etc. etc.  I think it's tied very directly to the station itself; humans are controlling one of the most critical resources in known space (apparently) in terms of trade and diplomacy, and that pisses people off. Like in real life, it pisses people off more than farther down the social/political scale you go - the more disenfranchised people are, the more they resent those in power. In this case the regular aliens (as opposed to the diplomats for example) are hating on a human who although he is also a 'regular guy', they see as perfectly symbolizing everything they hate about Earth Alliance - arrogance, heavy-handedness and presumption. He blasts in there thinking he knows everything, and it takes a lot of contextualizing from an alien to show him what the mutai means to them all."

babylon5,2qkhr6,BAMAToNE,8,Sun Dec 28 02:39:48 2014 UTC,"That is not why Michael O'Hare left the cast of B5. Actually, he was struggling with mental illness:   As Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski describes it, during the filming of the first season of Babylon 5, O'Hare began having paranoid delusions. Halfway through filming, his hallucinations worsened. It became increasingly difficult for O'Hare to continue work, his behavior was becoming increasingly erratic and he was often at odds with his colleagues. O'Hare sought treatment for his mental illness, but feared that, as the main character of Babylon 5, taking an extended medical leave of absence would destroy the show just as it was getting off the ground.  Straczynski offered to suspend the show for several months to accommodate O'Hare's treatment for his mental health; however O'Hare refused to put so many other people's jobs at risk. Straczynski agreed to keep his condition secret to protect O'Hare's career. O'Hare agreed to complete the first season but would be written out of the second season so that he could seek treatment. He reappeared in a cameo appearance early in season two and returned in season three for the double episode ""War Without End"", which closed his character's story arc. He made no further appearances on Babylon 5.  Although his treatments were somewhat successful, he was never fully cured. Upon O'Hare's return to Babylon 5, Straczynski promised again that he would keep his condition secret to his grave. O'Hare told him to ""keep the secret to my grave"", pointing out that fans deserved to eventually learn the real reason for his departure and that his experience could raise awareness and understanding for people suffering from mental illness. On May 25, 2013, eight months after O'Hare's death, Straczynski fulfilled his promise and finally revealed the reasons behind O'Hare's departure from Babylon 5 at the Phoenix Comicon."

babylon5,2qk6cg,demonstar55,2,Sun Dec 28 00:41:56 2014 UTC,"That's a logical order. Though, the truth is if you watch seasons 1-5 straight through you won't hurt yourself by watching everything else later. The Gathering has to be first of course, and A Call To Arms has to be before Crusade, those definitely matter, but the rest don't (oh, and also that bit about not watching In The Beginning until later, that's important)."

I found a lot of those episodes a little light or annoying, but I also recognize they had pieces to add to the story that would be referenced later. Skipping Born To The Purple leaves you wondering what Londo is talking about later in Season 3 and Season 4; some of his motivations appear to just come out of nowhere."

babylon5,2q4rbl,Zartan_,11,Tue Dec 23 02:09:31 2014 UTC,"I watched this episode when it first aired on the UK's Channel 4 back in 1996 and the ending just floored me. Jeffrey Sinclair had probably the most fascinating character arc of anyone on the show. He started out as a guy who was still badly damaged by what he went through in the Minbari war, to the point where he once admitted that for years after the war, he wanted to strangle the life out of any Minbari he saw. The he finally ends up not just as a Minbari but as one of the saviours of their race. What an amazing journey. The scene with Valen flanked by two angel-mode Vorlons is one of my favourites in all of science fiction. This year I found out the truth about why Michael O'Hare left the show and about his courageous struggle with mental illness. This adds another layer of poignancy to an already stunning conclusion to Sinclair's story. R.I.P. Michael and thanks for the memories."
babylon5,2q4rbl,joelincoln,2,Tue Dec 23 02:09:51 2014 UTC,"I also watched this when it first aired in the US.  I was on the edge of my seat, flabbergasted by the implications of the turn of events."
babylon5,2q4rbl,fzammetti,5,Tue Dec 23 17:07:20 2014 UTC,"I've always felt that Sinclair has a bad rap and it's largely due to season 1 somehow being ""weak"" in most people's minds. I gotta say two things on this...   First, I freakin' LOVE Sinclair and can honestly say I always have. I loved how even-tempered he always seemed, how in control he was. There's a deep calmness that no other character ever had (well, maybe Lorien too) and it always connected with me a lot because it's the exact opposite of me but is what I strive to be.  Don't get me wrong: I love Sheridan too... enough to make my son's middle name Sheridan :) ... and I wouldn't have wanted these characters to have gone any other way. Though not the original plan I think things worked out narratively for the best. But I'll always have a soft spot for Sinclair. He also has that ""nothing's the same anymore"" line that gives me chills every single time I hear it to this day... probably tends to have more meaning when you get into your 40's :)   And, on season 1, I recently watched it with my son and it's not nearly as weak as people say IMO. I think I only counted 4 or so truly ""weak"" episodes, and truthfully, I can almost say that about every season, even the seemingly perfect S3. It's only weak relative to the greatness that follows, but on its own I think I S1 is a a magnificent season of storytelling on its own.   And with that, my rant concludes... I now return you to your regularly schedule StellarCom broadcast :)"
babylon5,2q4rbl,BranWafr,3,Tue Dec 23 06:10:44 2014 UTC,"I think part of the weakness of season one is because it has the most scripts from outside writers.  Because they didn't know the outline of the entire story arc, and because the characters had not been living in their heads for years, the stories they wrote are not as integral to the main story and the voices aren't exactly the same.  That isn't to say the episodes weren't good in their own rights, but in many cases they feel like a generic space story that was changed just enough to fit in to the Babylon 5 universe.  That happens less and less as the show goes on and JMS takes over more and more of the writing.  And, really, almost all shows have uneven first seasons.  Unless you are adapting a known property, it takes at least half a season to figure things out and get in the groove.  I think Babylon 5 gets/got a lot more complaints than other shows simply because it is obvious from episode one that it has a grand vision, and people don't seem to be willing to cut it the same slack.  I think with most shows you feel you can just watch a few episodes here and there until it gets better, if you miss some, no big deal.  With B5, you kind of feel you can't miss an episode because you might miss something important.  Because of this, I think people are less willing to give it a shot because it feels like more of an investment up front.  I disagree, but I think that is how it is seen by many who didn't give it a shot."
babylon5,2q4rbl,BranWafr,3,Tue Dec 23 19:08:06 2014 UTC,"I got in to a discussion with some other people about time travel in movies and TV a few weeks ago.  A lot of people think that time travel ruins the story because it takes over and becomes a dues ex machina that the writers lean on too much.  I used Babylon 5 as an example of how it can be done right.  It was integral to the story, but it didn't take it over.  It wasn't used as a cheap way to solve problems.  It was a specific story telling tool that was used for a very specific purpose and then put away.  It's amazing how well things can be used when you have the structure figured out before you start and aren't just making things up as you go."
babylon5,2q4rbl,TotallyNotKen,3,Tue Dec 23 18:59:09 2014 UTC,"If you haven't yet, you should definitely read To Dream in the City of Sorrows, which tells more of Sinclair's story."

He was set up as pretty much the reason B5 was safe from the Shadows during most of the arc, but then when they come to B5 in Za'ha'dum they have no problem blocking him from intervening.  Then they use the machine (without seeing or hearing from Draal) to power their Voice of the Resistance...  and that's it.  I don't recall any reference to him again.  Along those lines, it bugs me that the Great machine in general isn't really explained or explored as a story in itself.  It's only been there for 500 years and yet seems to be technologically on par with the first ones.  Also damned conveniently located under B5.

I posted about it at 1998-04-06 to a local usenet group, which we used for very active discussions when B5 was showing in Finland. Here's an adapted translation:  The dream began as I am doing something, and glance at my watch. Aaaaaagh, B5 has already started! I run quickly to the TV, and am very happy to see that the opening credits are still rolling, so I only missed the part before the opening sequence. (A fun curiosity: the credits are being shown interleaved with the beginning scene of the episode, like with any other series, yet not B5.)  A large ship is on screen, and a smaller ship launches from it. Radio communications sound in the background ""Lowering shields down, you're clear to go."" The small ship accelerates and radio chatter continues ""Ok, powering shields back to normal"", or something like that. The ship flies dramatically past the camera to left. It looks like a transport shuttle carrying only few people.  We cut to B5, where Sheridan is examining a laptop on a table. Curiously, the laptop is exactly like the one I owned at the time! Very old tech in B5 standards, and thus Sheridan is somewhat puzzled by it. The laptop contains some important information that needs to recovered. ""Computer on!"" Sheridan attempts to command, but the ancient tech doesn't respond. He desperately looks for the power switch, but fails. (At this point, I comment to the people watching with me that this is silly, they really should still understand the basics after 200 years.)  Sheridan finally manages to power on the thing, at which point I find that I am actually with him, on B5, explaining the directory structure of the old operating systems.  At which point I, unfortunately, woke up."

babylon5,2pmx9v,dembones01,1 point,Fri Dec 19 00:50:51 2014 UTC,If the Grey 17 ep was named after the Neroon story arc instead then it wouldn't have anywhere near as abs a reputation.

And I love that stuff! But even so, it never hits as hard for me as stories about actual people. Terrorism, civil wars - these are stories that are almost as big, but you believe - even if only for a moment - that they can happen to you.   I loved S4. S2-3 almost as much, for the build-up if nothing else. But S4 gets me in the guts whenever I watch it."
babylon5,2pmx9v,chazwhiz,1 point,Thu Dec 18 09:09:30 2014 UTC,"Episode for episode, s4 is probably better.  But looking at a season as a whole congruent object, I'd say s3.  Yes it has odd things like Grey17, but it feels consistent and unified as the chapter of a novel.  S4 just feels jumbled, bouncing between plots, wrapping up arcs randomly - every episode is good, but the season is inconsistent and jarring.  Not sure if that makes sense.  And only really means anything from a retrospective viewpoint binge watching them back to back."
babylon5,2pmx9v,mnlg,1 point,Thu Dec 18 14:21:42 2014 UTC,"I think third. Second has too many weak episodes, fourth is too compressed. Plus, third has Severed Dreams, the episode that made me worship the series."
babylon5,2pmx9v,Chrysalii,2,Thu Dec 18 14:39:49 2014 UTC,I agree when you said that season 4 felt like it was much too rushed. Getting an entire civil war done in five or six months? Getting two-thirds of an entire military to defect? Not something that happens that fast.
babylon5,2pmx9v,Scootamoon,1 point,Thu Dec 18 16:15:12 2014 UTC,I really wish the network didn't die and B5 was known to have a fifth season so JMS could flesh it out (and we could avoid the Telepath arc).
babylon5,2plg4x,jibbroy,11,Wed Dec 17 17:53:37 2014 UTC,"It was also phenomenally ambitious to do back in that day.  From JMS's comments on UseNet at the time (archived on the Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5):  ""When producer George Johnson saw the scrpt for #10, ""Severed Dreams,"" he laughed, walked over to me and said, ""Boy, this is the best episode we're never gonna deliver. ARE YOU NUTS?!"" As an example of ""ARE YOU NUTS?!"" in ""The Fall of Night,"" in the sequence between the first Garden shot and the end of Sheridan's rescue, about 6-7 pages of script, there were, I think, about 60 or 65 EFX and practical shots. In just the span of 4 pages in 310 there are roughly 100 EFX and practical shots. In EFX terms, it's probably one of the biggest shows we've done, so it's better to give Foundation a little extra time to get it right rather than rush them.""  ""All I'll say here is that there were so many EFX here that we mixed the episode a few days before delivery, and got it down there 2 hours before the process for uplinking the episode to stations. It was the hardest thing we've ever done...but it was worth it.""  I strongly suggest reading through the Lurker's Guide for each episode after you see it. There's a lot of really cool stuff in there."

That's because they had to ""tone them down"" to be able to finish the F/X on the episode (and, as /u/tenkadaiichi quoted, they barely did so). It was, indeed, not cheap.

Gary Cole is phenomenal and exactly what you'd want to see in a sci-fi captain. The rest of the crew isn't as good for the most part but they all have their moments.   It's really a shame that the show had so much network interference, especially when B5 did so well without any ""help"" from the suits, but there are a lot of in-jokes in the show if you view the Earth Alliance government as a proxy for Paramount.  Other movies, again hit-or-miss. In the Beginning is great in my opinion,   Other shows - well there's nothing like B5, but Firefly and the new Battlestar Galactica was incredible. Of course if you haven't seen any Star Trek series yet you're sorely missing out. Too many others to mention, but a lot of television sci-fi gets screwed by networks ruining a good thing (i.e. Andromeda, Earth: Final Conflict).  As for non sci-fi shows I won't even touch that one because it's too vague. If you liked B5 and like fantasy, you will love Game of Thrones for its story arcs and character development. Other than that just browse around /r/television if you want to see what new shows are like. I'll just plug two classic series that are my favorites: Airwolf and Tales of the Golden Monkey. You won't read much about them because they aired almost 30 years ago but they're still awesome today."

The other commenters already answered your question about the B5 movies- but I would second that some excellent sci-fis deserving your attention are Firefly, Farscape, Star Trek(any), Stargate SG-1, and Battlestar Galactica."
babylon5,2p9wsi,demonstar55,3,Sun Dec 14 18:33:12 2014 UTC,"I would watch the other movies, they're not all that bad. Thirdspace is JMS' take on Weird Fiction (a la Lovecraft) so if that's your cup of tea, you'll probably enjoy it. I found Crusade to be extremely disappointing. Personally, I would say watch them all :P at least once."
babylon5,2p9wsi,Stile4aly,3,Sun Dec 14 20:43:47 2014 UTC,"None of the other movies really hold a candle to In the Beginning,  and while Crusade has some great moments,  it has the stink of executive meddling all over it, and let us not speak of Legend of the Rangers.   The Lost Tales isn't bad,  but the best continuation of the B5 series is really the books,  particularly To Dream in the City of Sorrows,  the Centauri Prime trilogy,  the Psi Corps trilogy,  and the In Valen's Name comic 3 parter.   As for other Sci fi series worth watching,  Deep Space Nine was quite good,  and I really enjoyed Battlestar Galactica.  The Stargate series had its moments as well.  People love Farscape,  but I never watched it regularly.   The HBO docudrama series From the Earth to the Moon was outstanding.   Space based Sci fi has fallen off the TV lately in favor of zombies,  vampires,  and fairy tales.   Hopefully someone will come up with a story worth telling.   Edit: How could I have forgotten Firefly/Serenity and Doctor Who?!?"
babylon5,2p9wsi,bollocks666,1 point,Sun Dec 14 18:22:07 2014 UTC,The Centauri prime trilogy was excellent. I enjoyed more than the psi corps trilogy

babylon5,2p9wsi,kengou,3,Mon Dec 15 19:30:18 2014 UTC,Definitely check out crusade. I personally loved it.  The lost tales was quite good too.
babylon5,2p9wsi,fzammetti,2,Mon Dec 15 04:02:53 2014 UTC,"Thirdspace is interesting... not what I'd call great, but definitely worth seeing.   A Call To Arms is actually pretty good, as I thought Crusade was beginning to get near the end, but I can't really recommend it given you won't have closure, and that hurts.   Legend Of The Rangers is kinda divisive... I personally enjoyed it and wouldn't have minded it as a series, but a lot of people hate it and they make valid points about it, so a toss-up I'd say.   The two extended movies are a mixed bag. The one with Sheridan and the new emperor isn't bad but the one with Lochley is forgettable (the fact that I don't remember their names and can't be bothered to look them up is telling).   River Of Souls is for me not worth seeing (unless you just want to watch everything B5, which I of course did). Lochley in lingerie wasn't bad of course, but not enough to make me recommend it.   TL;DR Watch Thirdspace, toss a coin for all the others, or simply hunker down and plow through 'em all to be able to say you saw everything B5 :)"
babylon5,2p9wsi,GhrabThaar,2,Sun Dec 14 18:26:03 2014 UTC,"Nothing new to add other than the B5 books were pretty good, so I hear. I liked Crusade except for Cole's occasional bullheaded idiot decisions but you need to watch it in the recommended order instead of the production order. The non-continuity movies are hit or miss, I don't think JMS handled non-episodic plots very well at the time. The one part of Legend of the Rangers I saw was laughably terrible."
babylon5,2p9wsi,lolzergrush,1 point,Sun Dec 14 23:05:15 2014 UTC,"I don't know what happened in legend of the Rangers, but it's universally thought to be terrible. which is a shame, because jamás paints the prototypical action heroes, like when they forced him to put Kiefer and as a hotshot pilot he couldn't stand it and he killed him off almost immediately. Rangers were the only real action heroes he liked, because thing for the existing outside of the whole hierarchy of society and more independent.doing a whole series on the Rangers, and it was meant to be a pilot, but in a lot better but something happened that end up being terrible"
babylon5,2p9wsi,K_U,2,Mon Dec 15 02:16:24 2014 UTC,"Other than Babylon 5, can you recommend me similar sci-fi or non sci-fi shows?   So I am guessing when you say ""similar"" you mean serialized, with a multi-season arc.    There are plenty of shows that either (a) started strong with a multi season arc but lost their way by the end (Lost, Battlestar Galactica reboot, Heroes), or (b) have defined single season arcs that are serialized (The Wire, Dexter, True Detective), but very few shows have kept both momentum and continuity from start to finish.    If you haven't watched them yet, Breaking Bad (the whole series), The Wire (the whole series), Battlestar Galactica (the whole series), and Heroes (Season 1) are well worth the time."
babylon5,2p9wsi,Sometimes_Lies,2,Mon Dec 15 05:23:47 2014 UTC,"I don't have very much to add to the list of already-great suggestions here, but I'll toss a few things in.  The only show that I'd add to the list which no one has recommended is probably Buffy. It doesn't compete with B5 in terms of a show-long plot arc, but each season has its own story.  The show isn't as serious as B5 and it is intentionally campy, but the writing is still solid beneath that. Between the show and its spinoff, the universe has a fairly detailed and interesting cosmology, and there is meaningful character growth throughout the series. Sometimes it is obnoxiously angsty, but usually it pulls itself together eventually, and there's a lot of humor to balance it out. The spinoff is much less angsty.  It's a different kind of show, but it's high quality and was made around the same era. The spinoff is also quite good (arguably better than the original show), though its name is a spoiler. It picks up at the end of season 3.  As for things people have recommended:  Stargate SG1 is very good, though again a different kind of show than B5. It has many of the same moments of ""this is funnier than it has a right to be,"" the premise is solid, and the cast is likeable. I feel that overall, the show's tone is consistently optimistic.  One of the most interesting aspects of the show is just how much it evolves over time. The last season is wildly different from the first season, but generally it feels like a natural progression from start to finish. There is definite power creep, but it's done (mostly) in sensible and logical ways.  Several people recommended Star Trek. Personally, I'd recommend starting with DS9. It is very derivative of B5, but a well-executed copy of a great show is still going to be, at minimum, good. The multi-season plot takes quite a while to get going, but it's interesting when it does. Several of the show's core concepts are the same, and the characters will feel at least passingly familiar. It is my favorite Trek, hands down."
babylon5,2p9wsi,mexter,2,Mon Dec 15 10:31:16 2014 UTC,"Farscape would probably be my first pick. Like B5 the first season is weak, but it pretty much knocks it out of the park for the next two.   Other than that, Deep Space 9, Stargate SG1, new Battlestar Galactica, Buffy, Firefly, and just to their a non sf into the mix, Veronica Mars. That last one sounds terrible on the description, but is astoundingly good. Well, not season three."
babylon5,2p9wsi,DarrenGrey,1 point,Mon Dec 15 15:12:35 2014 UTC,"Nothing. There's just nothing else. Long ago Babylon 5 ruined all other television for me and I've yet to find a cure :(  Seriously, there's nice stuff out there, but you won't find anything with the same long-term planning, consistency between episodes, and playing big and small scales together in a believable way. Oh, and don't get me started on the cruddy follow-up series to B5 :-/ I really wish I could unsee Lost Tales.  The B5 books are nice though. The Shadow Within is a good place to start."
babylon5,2p9wsi,Scootamoon,1 point,Mon Dec 15 12:37:48 2014 UTC,"I sort of want to plug Blake's 7. It is one of the shows that JMS states influenced Babylon 5. It was one of the first sci-fi shows with season arcs and cliffhangers, and a single writer taking on a lot of the legwork (I think he said Terry Nation held the record for most consecutive eps written until he took it!). You can certainly see a lot of the origins of B5, especially between the second and third season which features a war with mysterious aliens from another galaxy followed by an Earth civil war... (which mostly happens off screen due to BUDGET)  That said, if you like classic sci-fi, it is good. If you need good special effects and spectacle to enjoy something, MY GOODNESS stay far away. It looks legendarily bad, but then again, stuff like that is surface deep. Also the final episode, ""Blake"" is one of the best tv show finales ever."
babylon5,2ozgdf,DarrenGrey,8,Thu Dec 11 16:36:06 2014 UTC,"Now that you mention it, yeah it feels kinda forced.  But then again, he is not present at all. Like we see two or three video bits of him. He does not have much screentime. All his evil actions are carried out by his henchmen. Who also are not completely evil, at least thats their reasoning. They only do what is necessary.   So maybe Clarke as a archetype character is a bit flat, but now that I think about it, it seems that he is another manifestation of the evil in the background. The puppetmaster.   One of the leitmotifs of the whole rebellion against earthgov is civil disobiedience and not following every order. In order to set up the stage of that you need the big bad. And given the time constraints JMS was under he may not had the time to flesh this setting out more subtlely.  Also consider the time this has been written in. During the 80's and 90's we were not as much aware of the all the bad stuff a government is capable of. Nowaday with all the whisteblowers and all the real conspiracies and the big brother stuff, we think differently about this. Back then you probably needed a bigger hammer to hit that message home."
babylon5,2ozgdf,ReneG8,8,Thu Dec 11 18:03:07 2014 UTC,"Was Hitler a cartoon villain?  I know it's an excuse, but that's what it felt like the writers were shooting for.  Lazy, yes, but the parallels seem fairly straight forward.  Suspicious death of the previous leader, for whom he is the brand new second-in-command, Psicorps-SS, racial hatred (by Psicorps for mundanes, and by Clarke's regime for anyone who wasn't human), media control, widespread mistreatment of civilians...  if they'd given him a speech and let us find out later he'd been gassing aliens, the circle would have been complete.  I get that that feels forced.  But it's all just the same beats as Hitler, basically. At some point, you can't really call out Clarke for being ""cartoon-like"" without trampling into actual history and lessening the actual crimes of real monsters.  Why did he do it?  Shit, people are still asking that about Hitler and that's after he wrote an entire book/self-help-manifesto to explain it to us.  Clarke could have used a lot more work from the writers, but I really think they were ripping off history, not captain planet, when writing him."
babylon5,2ozgdf,Comrade_Beric,2,Thu Dec 11 21:51:12 2014 UTC,"I agree that the history references are clearly there, down to Hitler ordering the burning of Berlin before killing himself (the order wasn't carried out) and the easily manipulated post-war society that blames outside forces for everything wrong in the world.  I guess I would just like to see more of the human side. Hitler wasn't pure evil, and any documentary about him will mention his military history, his art background, his charisma. And in the context of Babylon 5 this character (or general force, I suppose - he's not a real character) seems lacking.  The easy comparison is Londo, who carried out many Hitler-esque atrocities himself."
babylon5,2ozgdf,mdillenbeck,1 point,Fri Dec 12 09:35:32 2014 UTC,"To an extent, yes.  Just as Caesar painted Vercingetorix and the Celtic people as bloodthirsty savages in order to pillage gold to fuel his ambitions, the Allies' propaganda did turn Hitler into a cartoon villain.  Hitler was a product of his time and situation, just as the undetailed Clark was in B5.  Both required complicity from the populace and key figures in power, and both are figurehead punished for the evils of a greater State - but having one person to point at makes us feel better as people.  However, I ultimately agree with you.  I can see a Hitler like figure rising up, so Clark does not seem so cartoon-y to me as much as a warning of what could be.  One merely needs to look at the global trends in policing across the globe to see that it is ready for a ""cartoon villain"" to rise up again."
babylon5,2ozgdf,TotallyNotKen,6,Thu Dec 11 23:42:28 2014 UTC,"When the show was on in the 1990s, someone made a similar comment on Usenet: it's just not believable that President Clark would have the military attack the legislature.  That kind of thing went out decades ago.  JMS replied pointing out that tanks had fired on the legislature in Moscow in the 1990s.  You're talking about cartoon villains: what do you think Vladimir Putin is?  He's had people murdered, he's invaded neighboring countries, he stages photo ops of himself bringing up vases from ancient shipwrecks, and he's taken control of the press so they only report stuff which sounds good.  Yes, Clark was a cartoon villain - but the world actually has cartoon villains in it, and is likely to for as long as there are human beings."
babylon5,2ozgdf,chattymcgee,3,Fri Dec 12 02:52:42 2014 UTC,"Oh, I think it's all believable. Its certainly all happened in history.  But this is a show in which we saw Londo overlook the bombing of Narn, a mass killing of civilians that eclipses anything Clarke ever achieved. We feel sorry for Londo in this moment even though he made it happen. Clarke never gets the barest of sympathies or explanations."
babylon5,2ozgdf,chattymcgee,6,Fri Dec 12 09:41:30 2014 UTC,"I think sometimes a story needs a cartoon villain to instigate the action.  If he had just been a little bad, not bombing civilians or the like, then Babylon 5's only reactions would be words and feelings.  I can't say if that would have been worse or better, but I do enjoy me some giant space battles, and those required Skeletor or Cobra Commander."
babylon5,2ozgdf,mdillenbeck,6,Thu Dec 11 17:58:59 2014 UTC,I'd have preferred something like Bester - committing atrocities but  having some internal justification.
babylon5,2ozgdf,fantasyham,11,Thu Dec 11 18:21:53 2014 UTC,"Now that I'm thinking about it, I think my headcanon for Clarke was that he wasn't really a person, he was just a puppet being used by the Shadows.  They wanted conflict, so they created Clarke and set him loose.  He was like a trained attack dog, not very interesting.  Bester, in contrast, has goals outside the violence and conflict.  He'll do some shady shit if it furthers his goals, but he won't start a fight on a humbug."
babylon5,2ozgdf,The-Doctor-94,6,Thu Dec 11 18:31:15 2014 UTC,"Interesting - put that way I see Clark as an aside for what Mollari could have been if his ""love"" for Centauri Prime hadn't been so great.  Sort of like JMS saying ""this is how everyone views Mollari near the end - and maybe if he hadn't been exiled as an ambassador this is how the viewers might have seen him also."""
babylon5,2ozgdf,Haster,5,Thu Dec 11 23:29:32 2014 UTC,That's how I saw him as well.
babylon5,2ozgdf,-Icaria-,2,Thu Dec 11 23:16:38 2014 UTC,"Bester also has the advantage of screen time. Walter Koenig was really enjoyable in the role, and that helped us love/hate the character.  Clarke was hardly seen, and the short times we see him didn't really add anything to the character."
babylon5,2ozgdf,CowboyFlipflop,6,Wed Dec 17 03:17:08 2014 UTC,"There's enough seeded into the show that you could probably make something up that fits but it's never outlined very well no.  It is hinted at in season 1 that earth is going through some economic troubles which could be blamed on some alien influences. Xenophobia could be a realistic reason, particularly if some aliens had started investing in earth (particularly the centauri). think of how people feel about the chinese 'buying everything in sight'.  There's also the fact that, following the minbari war, you'd think earth was pretty badly indebted to the Narns who would be calling in everything they can to deal with centauri aggression. this could also be blamed for some economic hardships.  There's enough there that it could have been woven into an interesting narrative but as you pointed out it wasn't."
babylon5,2ozgdf,cmfg,6,Thu Dec 11 18:55:40 2014 UTC,"Given how Clark himself was barely featured in the show; how the Alliance's democracy was far from healthy in the first place (Psi Corp's existence and the long-running strong-arming of Mars was proof of that); and how there was a slow, gradual build-up of jingo and erosion of rights and protections over the course of a couple of series, I wouldn't say it was handled any more clumsily than anything else in the show.  I'd still say the arbitrarily timed and dubiously motivated exposition used for almost every major reveal and plot twist in the series was a far bigger failing of the series. 'We've had a few episodes since the last big reveal, have Kosh or Delenn suddenly decide to reveal a secret to Sinclair/Sheridan for no particular reason'."
babylon5,2ozgdf,sequentious,5,Fri Dec 12 09:26:47 2014 UTC,"My only way of explaining things might be that he had a Keeper,   This has always been my assumption.   but this is never hinted at in the show.   Clarke was barely in the show."
babylon5,2ozgdf,sequentious,5,Thu Dec 11 21:30:30 2014 UTC,"Clarke was, I think, only a figurehead. A simple minded man, lusting for power at all cost. That made him open to being manipulated by various parties, including Bureau 13, whatever that really was, the Psy Corps, the Shadows. Everyone promised him more power, if only he did some of their dirty work.   I actually like the idea that Clarke had some kind of mental illness, megalomania or whatever, which led him in the end to attempt a murder-suicide with the whole planet earth, once he was dropped when no longer considered usefull."

""I don't know. There's something about this idea of a threat to planetary security I find very appealing. As long as we keep the real truth to ourselves, there's no reason we can't use this situation to speed up the program here at home.""  -- a Senator, Morden and a Psi Cop in Babylon 5:""Matters of Honor"" (here and here)   This shows the Corps and a Senator planning the coming changes, with help from Morden. I always assumed the Corps was pulling the strings, using fear to push Martial Law (keep the mundanes in check), the Loyalty Scans (remove any troublesome officers), and generally put Psi Corps staff, sympathizers, or puppets in key positions in the government. This would eventually lead to the Telepath War between B5 and Crusade.  Clark wasn't an ambitions man lusting after power, he was a Psi Corps puppet, something along the lines of what they did to Garibaldi. He seemed one-sided because he actually didn't possess any depth. He was solely purposed to push an agenda without exposing the Corps. If he was compromised or fell out of favour, the Clark puppet could be thrown to the dogs, and replaced with another."

Of course, we never really got an insight into Clark and the upper echelons, so it is all rumour and supposition.  Remember, Bester wasn't in charge of the Corps. As much as a villain as he was, he valued all telepaths above 'mundanes', his bosses may not have had the same motivations (especially in handing over those telepaths to be experimented on by the Shadows)."
babylon5,2ozgdf,sataimir,5,Sun Dec 14 00:16:30 2014 UTC,"Look at the EA ship captains that Sheridan was fighting in the ""march to Earth""- they were three dimensional characters.  If Clarke had actually been a character in the series, I'm sure he would have been interesting and different. But look at Cartagia...sometimes a cartoony-villain archetype can fit perfectly into a scenario. If we had only heard about his actions- torturing at will, letting the shadows have part of Centauri Prime, humiliating G'Kar and trying to break him -he also would have sounded like a Bond villain-type. But since he plays such a powerful role, it just fits. We see his mental illness manifest and believe in it fully.  Frank Herbert wrote a good line about power not corrupting people in a vacuum, but being most attractive and lusted after to those with corruptible and megalomaniacal personalities."
babylon5,2ozgdf,quintus_aurelianus,3,Thu Dec 11 23:04:03 2014 UTC,"With the Centauri we quickly make parallels to the mad emperors of Rome - and that matches with my earlier point that these characters are portrayed from the viewpoint of propaganda and not ""reality.""  The story writer is am unreliable witness - was Cartagia mad like Nero, or are we heading the message that the people on Babylon 5 were hearing?  We only empathize with Mollari because we know his moral struggle, and we eventually realize what the Drak did for revenge.  To the rest of the universe, he was just another mad emperor."

Of course what was interesting about Cartagia was not so much himself, as the way he forced people around him to act. Anyone less insane might have led Londo to make more excuses and follow the lead. Cartagia forced Londo into doing actions he would never have considered otherwise."

I think just the fact he killed himself gives credence to the idea that there is a lot of hidden motives going on behind the scenes that we just didn't see, why he was the way he was. His motives. I think he was doing what he was for a stronger Earth, and by the end of the war he had just gone kind of insane."

But pretty much everything he does is based on things actual Western governments have done at one time or another. I know JMS said a lot of the regime was based on 50s America and McCarthyism. Heck, even what happened post 911, with the government passing really restrictive laws based on fear. No-one would have believed something like Guantanamo Bay could have existed until it did. And apart from the odd protests, the majority of people were perfectly fine with it. Very scary, and not a million miles away from what we saw of Earthforce in Babylon 5.   Really, it's really the opening fire on civilian targets that makes Clark a bit too cartoon evil, but again even modern governments show a disregard for civilians in combat situations (historically in Vietnam, and WW2 where both sides carried out extensive bombings of civilians. A modern comparison would be opening fire on refugee ships or ships from embargoed countries like Cuba, though I'm not aware that has happened! Would it be fair to blame the President directly if it did? Probably not."

After G'Kar has learned that Centauri cruisers have led the attack on the Narn colony in Q14 (remember that earlier in the episode, he had learned of the Emperor's peace offer and shared a toast with Londo about it), he's barreling down a corridor in the ambassadorial quarters in a murderous rage, searching for Mollari in order to kill him, and is stopped by security. As Sheridan tries to talk him down, he breaks out ""They'll kill everyone, don't you understand? They've done it before, they'll kill everyone!"". And for the first time I realized that the belligerent Narn, who up to this point had kind of seemed like the Klingons of B5 to me, had been the victims all along!   And as G'Kar broke down in that corridor, slumped against the wall, repeating ""They're going to do it all again"", my heart broke for him.  And then, there's this:  ""And some day, when all of this is over, perhaps you will find it in your heart to forgive me. ""  ""Perhaps... but not today.

babylon5,2osp43,Ubergopher,18,Wed Dec 10 20:14:55 2014 UTC,"Some of your points were raised by other EA commanders after the liberation of Proxima 3.  They sat around the table and had a debate, and one said they'd leave for neutral territory and not get involved, and another said that Sheridan was splitting some hairs mighty thing to get his justification for what he was doing.  But there are times in life when you have no perfect choice.  Whatever you do, it'll be wrong from at least one perspective, and possibly more than one.  IIRC, Sheridan declared independence, but didn't go to war until after EarthForce ships destroyed two unarmed civilian transports with multiple thousands of people on them.  That's an unambiguous war crime, and it was - to all appearances - approved by the Administration.  Once the decision was made to stop such actions, some innocent people were going to get killed by Sheridan's forces.  Janitors on EA destroyers, who maybe don't even know who's getting shot at, are going to be blown up right alongside their homicidal commanders.  Medical staff who would never kill anyone, serving to save lives on board ship, dead.  It wouldn't be on purpose, but it can't be prevented 100%.  Some innocent people are going to die.  But way more innocent people would die if Clark was left in power.  Also, once the decision was made, not using the WhiteStar fleet would be immoral.  If you send someone into combat, you have an obligation to provide them with the best possible chance of living, which means the best possible equipment.  They mismanaged the politics of the issue some (I agree about the flyover), and made some other missteps along the way.  I actually prefer that; if Sheridan had been some sort of infallible and perfect commander, the story wouldn't have worked at all."
babylon5,2osp43,TotallyNotKen,5,Wed Dec 10 02:21:09 2014 UTC,"I like the point you make, but there's just a minor thing. Generally speaking, everyone on a warship is a military member.  There aren't ""janitors"" that don't have any idea; they're junior crew members.  Everyone serving on the warship does so knowing that they're on a combat ship, a legitimate military target that can be subject to attack.  Some of them may be ""innocent,"" but they're also military members who know what they're getting into."
babylon5,2osp43,SilverHawk7,2,Thu Dec 11 01:38:36 2014 UTC,"Generally speaking, everyone on a warship is a military member.   They know they're in the military, obviously, but some may have joined just to get out of poverty, and have jobs of no military significance at all.  They don't know what planet they're going to, they don't know why, they just repair machines.  Farther up the chain, if the captain orders guns fired on a target because he says it's full of bioweapons headed for Earth, and they blow it up, they're innocent of murdering civilians because they didn't know that's what they were doing.  And then there are those who do know, but fear to speak up or refuse an order because they'll be the ones getting killed, or maybe family members back home will be killed.  So they keep their heads down, and hate what's happening but are powerless to stop it.  It's probably the case that every EA ship had some people like that on it, innocent of the crimes the captains were ordering, but being innocent didn't keep them from dying when the shooting started."
babylon5,2osp43,TotallyNotKen,12,Thu Dec 11 02:08:40 2014 UTC,"Breaking away from Earth.     Capt Hiroshi pointed out that Clark had already dispatched a force to take control of Babylon 5 and arrest the command staff.  Had Capt Sheriden not seceded Babylon 5 from the Earth Alliance, he, Cmdr Ivanova, Dr. Franklin, and Chief Garibaldi would have been arrested, and the ""conspiracy of light"" would have collapsed.  He points this out in his deliberation with the others.     Declaring war against Earth.     Capt Sheridan decided to move against Earth after witnessing the EAS Pollux firing on several civilian transports carrying wounded.  He points out that this is a war crime; it's not merely a ""dubious action.""  Sheridan decided at that point that he could no longer sit by and watch while Clark slaughtered innocent civilians.   Is it the place of the military to make political decisions?     No, and Sheridan acknowledges this.  Gen Lefcourt poses the other side of the same coin, pointing out that while he might not agree with the President's actions, it's not the place of the military to fire on their own government.     Not making it a clean fight.     By ""clean fight,"" Capt Sheridan means human commanding officers.  While some of the crew might be aliens, they're taking orders from humans.  Ultimately, responsibility for actions taken during the war fall on humans.     Using the telepaths.     This is a muddy issue, but a valid point regarding the ""innocence"" of the telepaths.  The muddiness comes from the nature of the telepaths, mostly ""criminals"" fleeing Psi Corps, and implanted with alien technology that's impossible to remove.  Depending on who one asks, they were dead anyway.  But it wasn't wholesale slaughter, nor were they callously lined up and executed; their sacrifice saved countless human lives.  That's probably how Sheridan and his forces rationalized it.  Whether they were right to do so is a matter of some debate.     What was his plan?     Sheridan knew about the resistance on Earth.  It's not a matter of ""no one wanted to arrest Clark;"" a great many wanted Clark dealt with.  Look at the number of military ships that defected to his side.  If it came down to it, Sheridan would have probably landed troops (good god I hope human troops only) to arrest Clark.   Getting away with it.     This assumes the population believed Clark's propaganda.  Keep in mind the resistance, but also the shear amount of military forces that defected to Sheriden's side.  Also keep in mind the ISN reporter that broke the story after the coup; the same reporter that was reporting for possibly years before ISN went dark and was replaced by an ""obvious"" mouthpiece."
babylon5,2osp43,SilverHawk7,9,Wed Dec 10 02:21:43 2014 UTC,"I think the issue with almost all of these points is that while Sheridan's actions could be rationalized, there were no right choices at all.  Sheridan chose what he felt was the lesser evil - to fight to try to save, rather than not fight and watch Earthforce slaughter civilians at will.  In my opinion, they illustrated Clark's crimes so vividly to highlight how truly and completely evil his side was so that by comparison anything Sheridan did would seem heroic regardless of the moral issues at hand, because he was clearly much less evil than Clark.  I think Sheridan understood this because of how torn he was before every engagement and how insistent he was that his forces never start an engagement, but always finish it.  Make the bad guy prove he's the bad guy so that you automatically become the good guy, relatively speaking."
babylon5,2osp43,AnnihilatedTyro,3,Wed Dec 10 06:59:03 2014 UTC,"Many choices a leader has to make, especially political choices, can be rationalized, but are rarely as cut-and-dry as right and wrong.

That plot point was a huge disappointment to me. It was the kind of trite Star Trek-ish TV sci-fi trope B5 was supposed to be smashing to bits: ""Member of the crew opposed to the captain? Turns out they were kidnapped by aliens and subjected to mind control!""  Garibaldi really should have been allowed to turn against Sheridan of his own free will. It wouldn't have even been much of a stretch for his character, and it would have made their falling out much more meaningful and tragic."
babylon5,2osp43,koreth,3,Wed Dec 10 04:10:57 2014 UTC,"You have a lot of good points, and I feel like if you wanted, you could actually turn them into a very significant plot twist. I haven't re-watched the show in years, so my memory may be a bit off, but...  If we go strictly by in-universe stuff and not follow obvious ""real life"" explanations, the final episode reveals that the entire show has been an educational documentary.  Taken with the fact that Sheridan really did do some morally questionable things, that opens a huge can of worms. Could it be that the show itself is an unreliable narrator?  As viewers, we knew a lot more than any individual character, and that justified their actions. But, who was making the show in-universe? Did they have an agenda? Were Sheridan's later critics truly revisionists? Since our entire knowledge of the founding of the alliance comes from a re-enactment that someone wrote, we have no way of knowing. Maybe we saw the revisionist history.  Now, like I said, this is only valid if you ignore obvious out-universe explanations. In reality, the documentary thing was just a cutesy way of acknowledging the people who made the show and give them more credit than the standard end-credits allowed. But, if you take it at face value, it really can completely change the tone of the show."
babylon5,2osp43,Sometimes_Lies,5,Fri Dec 12 06:41:24 2014 UTC,"I think it's clear that in a lot of things Sheriden was wrong and that there were many who doubted what he did or judged him harshly after. Of course the problem is that there was no right action he could do... Should he be paralysed into inaction because none of the options available are perfect?  We see this turned against Sheriden in season 5, when the telepaths take ""the wrong way, the inconvenient way"". Delenn rightly rebukes him for saying that!"

If they are able to present some compelling evidence of this chain of events, it's hard to see it as an ""Invading alien force"" instead of the saviours who swooped in at the last minute.  Granted, the Scorched Earth wouldn't have happened if Sheridan hadn't tried his coup, but the fact that Clarke even had such a plan is quite telling.  As for whether he was 'right' or not... that's an excellent and potentially unanswerable question. Babylon 5 is a long story about questionable moral choices, and choosing between multiple paths, with no guarantee that any of these paths are good."

Because yes, if you think about it, Sheridan started out as ""fixing mess"" and ended up ""re-making the galaxy"". Londo did the same and his tale is a lot more tragic than Sheridan's.

babylon5,2op7ac,StuBlad,1 point,Mon Dec 15 22:03:49 2014 UTC,"Sorry to bump this topic, it's my first time posting on Reddit but I wanted to drop something here.  It's been going around for years that WB requested Babylonian Productions hand over all the CGI assets and destroy them once production ended which was true. Then we hear the WB lost them later on down the line. Whilst this is all based in fact, several sources who actually worked on the show have said they have almost the entirety of the assets backed up from their time working at Foundation Imaging or Netter Digital.  You can see several mentions of it on this b5 site that's been updated as recently as October 2014: http://www.b5scrolls.com/  In an interview with Ron Thornton, the VisFX designer on seasons 1-3 & co-founder of Foundation Imaging he states:  ""Question: I asked some folks for suggestions on what to ask you, and I this was an interesting one.  Unlike physical models that can end up in the Smithsonian, what happens to original copies of iconic CG created designs.  Do they just disappear into the ether?  Answer: Well they shouldn’t.  Let’s put it this way, I can grab at least 4 or 5 people who have pretty much all the assets from Babylon 5.  Even down to the original ships I did for the test, because it was all on the Foundation servers before we went bankrupt.""  Although he goes on to mention the following:  ""Question: That would have been cool, and I can imagine plenty of folks took personal backups - I've spoke to some of them. ; ) Which makes it all the more surprising that no one could find the assets when they were doing things like the Lost Tales, or the Legend Of The Rangers before that.  Answer: If they had asked me I could have given them straight away. But realistically the original assets really aren’t up to anything like the modern standard. They are so simplistic. Plus the guys did such a good job on the station, Starfury and also the green ship for the Lost Tales""  Source: http://www.b5scrolls.com/#Screen1_01_14  If you leaf through the entirety of the interview he mentions that they saved assets on a show by show basis and had things very organized. To the point where I'm imagining you'd have all the scene files there with things setup ready to go. Wouldn't that be a major cost saving/time saving method of making Babylon 5 HD a reality?  Of course reskins would have to be done, the overall look would benefit with tweaking but you have the meat and potatoes there which is WB's main sticking point. They don't want to fork out to redo it all from scratch, the CGI especially. In this case, you'd be able to majorly cut down on the amount of time/money spent on this in particular.  Re-cutting each episode scene by scene from the negatives however still sounds like a daunting task and is easily another major barrier to this becoming a reality.  I wish some of those assets were at least able to be shared for the fans to prototype some samples that could be shown to WB to help make it happen but that really is daydreaming :P"

babylon5,2obwvc,GhrabThaar,1 point,Fri Dec 5 20:38:13 2014 UTC,"Little late here, but I gotta give my opinion.   I'm really very surprised more people didn't recommend Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. It's easily the closest thing to Babylon 5. It's not even close to normal Star Trek; it's dark as hell and very arc-based. By far the best Trek series, and often just as amazing as Babylon 5.   It does a while to get going, though. Babylon 5 sows its story arc seeds in season one, then shit hits the fan for most of the series. With DS9, there are a few good episodes in the first two seasons, but it's mostly throwaway. The story arc, and thus the show's greatest point, doesn't start until season three, and even then the season is kinda eh. Season four and on is when it gets really amazing. So yeah, takes a while to get going, but once it does, boy, does it ever.  Battlestar Galactica would be the third part of my ""dark arc-based sci-fi"" trinity, right after B5 and DS9. Definitely watch that. Farscape isn't as close to B5 as many will say it is, but it is very continuity-based, and is definitely a must-watch for a whole mess of reasons.  If we branch out from sci-fi, you're gonna wanna check out Game of Thrones (or the book series, A Song of Ice and Fire, whichever floats your boat). Branching out from television alltogether, I think you'll very much like the comic book series Y: The Last Man and Saga, both by the same incredible writer. Oh, and, though this is really going far from the ""political sci-fi"" angle of B5, The Walking Dead is beyond amazing in both comic book and video game form, though I'd say you can skip the TV series."

babylon5,2o2kam,ReallyGheyLuxray,39,Tue Dec 2 19:01:00 2014 UTC,"Because it was cheaper, but good enough.  Star Trek TNG got lucky way back when because ILM was somewhat struggling at the time (it wasn't the powerhouse it because by the mid 90's and later. In 1987 it was a small fry with a handful of notable releases).  When Paramount approached ILM to do Star Trek The Next Generation ILM offered them a sweetheart deal because they needed the work and wanted to keep their artists working (at least on something, and probably figured they could leverage the partnership for future Paramount movies). So they could afford to use film quality physical models and rotoscoped effects (done manually), until eventually 3d CGI caught up.  With Babylon 5 the budget was much smaller and JMS had to make a lot of his budget stretch. One way he found to cut costs was to build his own in house effects company (with other B5 producers), which leveraged the Amiga and video toaster technologies. Offering nearly the same high-end features of other 3d tools for much less. Coupled with smaller effects partners ( like Foundation Imaging, who ended up working on Star Trek years later ) they were able to get what they needed at a fraction of the cost.  Also keep in mind, in 1993-94 those graphics were actually cutting edge, especially for a TV show.  Jurassic Park appeared in 1993 and used it's CGI sparingly. The CGI shots of dinosaurs have a total of 6 minutes screen time and took over a year to make on high end SGI 3d graphics workstations at $80,000-$100,0000 each. B5 was doing nearly the same every week on cheap personal computers averaging $5,000-$10,000 each.  Insektors came out in 1993 as the first fully CG television series, with 12 minute episodes. Reboot was the first half hour CGI series in 1994. Both were more cartoon-y in presentation. Toy Story wouldn't be released until November 1995. Practically nobody else was using 3D CGI for serious story telling.  While today the graphics are dated, at the time they worked perfectly. It was not laughable but considered impressive they could get such a look for less money, done for a weekly series. In fact B5 won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Special Visual Effects emmy in 1993 for ""The Gathering""."

As the studio had lost all the original CG assets, Atmosphere Visual was forced to start completely from scratch. Eventually asking fans to provide their home made models as reference.  When JMS went in during an early production meeting he was presented with a low polygon model of the station.  With the effects artists apologizing for the incredibly low quality of around (I want to say) 2,000 polygons.  To which JMS had to laugh because that count was higher than the original model they were working with on the show. He's have killed for that resolution in the 90's."

babylon5,2o2kam,ChoiceD,7,Fri Dec 5 17:55:58 2014 UTC,Well the technology still isn't there but that doesn't stop pretty much every show and movie from exclusively using CG images for all space scenes.  I must be the only person that actually enjoys the B5 effects.  I think I just find it more endearing than the crap that we're used to these days.
babylon5,2o2kam,zworkaccount,5,Tue Dec 2 20:24:05 2014 UTC,Well the technology still isn't there    I've gotta disagree with you... Battlestar Galactica proved you can do amazing things with CGI in a sci-fi TV show.
babylon5,2o2kam,kengou,1 point,Tue Dec 2 21:56:02 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying you can't do awesome things with CGI, I'm saying the technology does not yet exist to make it look as real as a model.  Battlestar Galactica is the greatest science fiction show ever made with probably the best CGI ever made for TV, but at no point during the show did I ever forget that I was looking at computer generated ships."
babylon5,2o2kam,zworkaccount,2,Wed Dec 3 13:13:52 2014 UTC,"at no point during the show did I ever forget that I was looking at computer generated ships.   This may of course be down to personal differences, but I did all the time.  The ""shaky-cam"" style of shooting, and the high quality of the CGI and overall kind of dark lighting, made it look exceedingly real to me very frequently.  I think they did a phenomenal job - it pulls me into the space battles more than the most expensive CGI movies have."
babylon5,2o2kam,kengou,1 point,Wed Dec 3 13:19:19 2014 UTC,As someone who does CGI as a hobby I can tell you the effects Battlestar Galactica (for the most part) only look as good as you think they do because of fast camera movement/zooming and  lighting/focussing which prevents you noticing the bad parts ;)
babylon5,2o2kam,NaughtyFred,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:27:04 2015 UTC,I can't disagree with you but it still looks fantastic to me.  Maybe others should copy some aspects of that style :P
babylon5,2o2kam,kengou,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:20:45 2015 UTC,"Personally I prefer miniatures over CG effects, other than for weapons fire and such. I think they have an artistic touch that CG effects lack..."
babylon5,2o2kam,zworkaccount,1 point,Tue Dec 2 21:10:38 2014 UTC,So do I.  That's the point I'm making.  CG still doesn't look real to me so how unrealistic it looks doesn't really make too much of a difference.
babylon5,2o2kam,BranWafr,6,Wed Dec 3 13:13:59 2014 UTC,"As others have mentioned, it was largely a cost thing.  However, there were other aspects to the decision.  It would have been very hard to do organic spaceships using the traditional model way of doing things.  Say what you want about the quality of the effects in Babylong 5, because of CGI they have a much more varied collection of ships.  Also, it would have been nearly impossible (on a TV budget and timeframe) to do the kind of epic space battles that we get in some of the later seasons.  I don't know if it has been beaten since then, but at the time several episodes of Babylon 5 broke the record for number of ships on-screen during a space battle.  I don't think you could have done many of the battles during the Shadow War using traditional models.  There were just too many ships and too much going on.  Maybe in a movie, but not in TV.  I say the same thing here as I do with video games.  I'd rather have a good story and less than perfect graphics than great graphics and a crappy story.  I'm willing to forgive the limitations of the time simply because of the amazing things that they were able to do because of it.  (Just like I can still enjoy The Last Starfighter as a movie even though the CGI in that is even far more primitive than Babylon 5)"
babylon5,2o2kam,kengou,5,Tue Dec 2 20:52:15 2014 UTC,"Also worth mentioning is that it would have been extremely difficult to do the realistic space physics of the Starfuries and other ships and stations using models.  The way those ships turn and move in space is very much unique to Babylon 5 and only possible using CGI technology, and for me that attention to realism is a big part of the appeal of B5's universe."
babylon5,2o2kam,seeingeyefrog,7,Tue Dec 2 21:57:50 2014 UTC,"If you have been watching the DVDs, there is another problem to consider. The CGI was only done in the old TV aspect ratio. When stretched to widescreen, there is a big loss in quality."
babylon5,2o2kam,PicardX,3,Tue Dec 2 21:46:40 2014 UTC,"They made the show with the plan to go wide screen one day, only problem is the CGI was created for SD so the widescreen transfers crop the top and bottom and zoom in on the rest to fit widescreen."
babylon5,2o2kam,AdShea,0,Tue Dec 2 22:14:45 2014 UTC,"Hmmm, I wonder if changing the aspect ratio to 4:3 in VLC would help anything?"
babylon5,2o2kam,mharsh,0,Wed Dec 3 00:25:44 2014 UTC,Do you know the original aspect ratio?
babylon5,2o2kam,Tigrael,2,Tue Dec 2 23:47:11 2014 UTC,"4:3, just like an old TV.  They shot the live parts on film but figured it would be cheaper to re-render on newer hardware when they were going for a widescreen release than waste time on it at the time."
babylon5,2o2kam,mpierre,2,Wed Dec 3 01:35:47 2014 UTC,"Live action shots were filmed in a forward-looking 16:9 ratio then cut down to 4:3 before airing. CGI scenes were only created in 4:3, and these CGI scenes weren't merely outer-space shots. They included any live-action scenes that had CGI composited into them (great machine holograms, technomage monsters, etc).  When the DVD sets came out, they went back and got the 16:9 live-action cuts and re-edited them into the video. However, all the 4:3 CGI scenes had the tops and bottoms chopped off and were zoomed in making them look blurry and badly framed. Sadly, it's really obvious when it happens."
babylon5,2o2kam,davidsverse,3,Wed Dec 3 18:44:44 2014 UTC,"Keep watching, they get better."
babylon5,2o2kam,botany_bay,3,Tue Dec 2 20:53:37 2014 UTC,"Another thing to keep in mind when comparing TNG/DS9 and B5 is the residuals...  B5 had a budget of 900,000$ per episode if I remember well, and not a penny more.  TNG often had more than 1-1.3 million per episode(depending on season) BUT, and this is the big BUT, they had access to an advance on residuals.  Here is the idea.  TNG didn't go off the air when it ended, and it didn't play only 24 times per year.  Frequently, it was shown syndicated during the week even WHILE it was running.  Those reruns bring in serious money. Since TNG is episodic, you can very easily syndicate it and catch occasional watchers.  As a result, when TNG needed more money then their budget, they could use an advance on the residuals.  B5 had 900,000 per episode and not a penny more. If they wanted 1 million, they needed to cut from other episodes.  JMS explained this in details back in the days, but I remember going to a sci-fi con in Montréal (the one in which they announced Deep Space Nine as it occurs), and many members of the TNG cast were present and this was mentionned because it was also the year of Redemption, which cost if I remember 10 million for 2 episodes and they were all very excited.  10 million, that 5 millions per episode for extra space battle!  The money had come from residuals in part.  Babylon5 didn't have access to that..."
babylon5,2o2kam,mdillenbeck,3,Wed Dec 3 18:06:51 2014 UTC,The emotional impact of the fx makes up for a lot.  I will take any space battle from season 3&4 over anything done today.
babylon5,2o2kam,weks,1 point,Tue Dec 16 21:30:54 2014 UTC,It's unfortunate that all the CG effects will also likely keep Bab 5 from ever coming out on blu ray since they'd have to recreate (likely from scratch) all of the CG work. That would be cost prohibitive.
babylon5,2o2kam,quintus_aurelianus,1 point,Wed Dec 3 00:03:59 2014 UTC,"Unless they crowd sources rendering with distributed computing - how many B5 fans are already doing this with Boinc already, and would jump at a chance to help render high quality wide screen animations?  Add to that a simple request for models in a specific platform or fan-made sequences, and the B5 fans would food them with work.  Yes, there would be costs - but not as high as traditional production costs."

babylon5,2ng0xo,geojoe14,6,Wed Nov 26 03:55:17 2014 UTC,Couldn't agree more. I rewatch B5 regularly and every time I do I get something new.   Did you find the Minbari 'religious' view as explained to the monk doing research (i.e. we are a manifestation of the universe trying to understand itself etc. etc.) as compelling as I did? I'm an atheist and for some reason that really struck a chord with me.  What characters resonate most with you?
babylon5,2ng0xo,goodhumansbad,6,Wed Nov 26 04:00:20 2014 UTC,"I am more agnostic, I suppose. I do enjoy thinking about the concepts that are presented in B5, and most other good science fiction. There is an array of different philosophies about religion and deities and it can be an interesting thing to think about and compare to others.  I think the character that stood out the most for me was G'kar. The evolution of his character is fascinating. I really like the fact that despite all he had been through, he remained one of the most honorable and loyal characters on the show."
babylon5,2ng0xo,Dracoprimus,7,Wed Nov 26 04:26:39 2014 UTC,"actually, G'kar wasn't all that honorable or loyal in the first season, so full of hate and anger.

Definitely a favorite character by the last season."
babylon5,2ng0xo,Agandhjin,7,Wed Nov 26 05:08:58 2014 UTC,"The Londo/G'kar storyline has to be one of my favorites as well.

Apropos the religious part  of the series; as a student of religious sociology specialising in religion/popular culture and fan of scifi, I love that they named the ""future"" Valen Sinclair; the past/future saviour carries the same name as the proposed bloodline of Christ made popular by the DaVinci code. Has anyone else considered this?"

I guess it's the fact that we can easily remember the exceptions which makes it seem better in retrospect.  I wonder what the current ""exceptions"" are? In a lot of ways, it seems like modern tv has come a long way. More things can be done without fear of censorship, and the formerly overwhelming scream of ""people don't want to have to remember what happened last week, give them a new story every week!"" has quieted somewhat.  It seems like things should be better, but I'm not aware of all that many current shows that're good. That's probably my fault as much as anything, since I've not been keeping up.

babylon5,2mxdas,StarshipSentinel,3,Fri Nov 21 01:36:44 2014 UTC,"It's pretty much certain that Jeffrey Sinclair at least hinted to the events of Kosh's arrival on the station.  Remember, he set up nearly every other major event preceding his departure from the 2200s.  Additionally, Kosh's encounter suit (canonically) has a great deal of technology in it.  Sensors included, and I'd be surprised if Vorlon sensors couldn't see through such low-brow technology as a derisive snort Changeling net....  Even if all that weren't the case, remember that Kosh felt he was being greeted by a trusting and trusted friend.  The tab was applied when Kosh offered his bare hand/tentacle/whatever in greeting.  He never would have made himself so vulnerable to a member of homeguard.  As to the original question...Oh man, that would've been hilarious."

babylon5,2mphpf,ParadoxPixie,6,Tue Nov 18 22:38:30 2014 UTC,"You heard wrong. It was always intended to tell a 5-year story arc, one year per season, but it was reordered in response to threat of cancellation. As it panned out, some of the stuff intended to be in Season 4 was pushed to Season 5.  TL;DR: watch it."
babylon5,2mphpf,nolo_me,4,Wed Nov 19 03:14:04 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I just recently rewatched the entire series (and posted the same question). Some dull moments with Fabio Byron, but that's was fast-forwarding is for.  Good development with Centauri Prime. And of course, there's very good character development, too, as you've already seen through the first 4 seasons.  Get your tissues ready for the final x episodes. It's OK to cry. We all do. It bonds us together.  As a character says in Paragon of Animals, ""We are one."""
babylon5,2mphpf,Weyoun2,9,Wed Nov 19 17:51:29 2014 UTC,Watch it.
babylon5,2mphpf,Sloblock,4,Tue Nov 18 22:07:58 2014 UTC,"Absolutely. The first third(?) of the season is iffy, but as the season progresses it picks up quite a bit."
babylon5,2mphpf,Theopholus,3,Tue Nov 18 22:34:39 2014 UTC,"Yes. Some parts are goofy, but you made it this far. The last half of the season make the whole journey complete for me."
babylon5,2mphpf,Labfiend,3,Wed Nov 19 01:11:42 2014 UTC,"Season 5 suffers for not having Ivanova as commander as was planned.  The telepath story would probably have been a lot more personal for her.  Things also seemed kind of dragged out, mitigated by no longer having to wait a week between episodes anymore.  However, even with its faults I think it was a great ending for the show.  The whole season is a winding down, giving time for the characters to reflect and move towards a satisfying endstate.  The reason B5 sticks with me so well is because they didn't end on the climax of the story, like so many other stories do.  Epilogues are beautiful."
babylon5,2mphpf,monkeyordonkey,2,Wed Nov 19 04:50:37 2014 UTC,"After the last two episodes, I was never the same again.  Watch it."

babylon5,2mphpf,DarrenGrey,2,Wed Nov 19 00:41:59 2014 UTC,"I introduced two friends to Babylon 5 last year and they really loved it until season 5. I was quite surprised as although s5 isn't great I didn't think it was bad enough to taint the whole series. But for them it did, which is quite sad.  I think it should be fine if you go in with the right expectations. There are some brilliant moments in season 5, but there's a lot of drudgery and one particular multi-episode storyline that contains all sorts of awful. Overall it's still worth it.  The movies are spin-off series are most definitely not worth it though. Except In the Beginning which is quite good. The other stuff... wow, some real trash in there."
babylon5,2mphpf,dbutlerjr,1 point,Wed Nov 19 13:09:21 2014 UTC,In the Beginning and Call to Arms were quite good.  The other two were ok but totally skippable
babylon5,2mphpf,Lurker_242,2,Fri Nov 21 19:55:56 2014 UTC,"I am currently on Season 5, and I must say it's definitely not as good as 1-4 by far. The whole Byron arc really got on my nerves, and it was resolved both badly and with possibly the most pathetic moment of the entire series. On the other hand, it has a lot of Bester, one of my favorite characters, and I also love Garibaldis descent and Landos long arduous road to his fate and (hopefully) redemption.   I think it's the weakest season (though I have heard a lot of good things about the finale, looking forward to it) but even with its weaknesses, it's still loads better than 99.9% of the other crap ever shown on TV. Keep watching!"
babylon5,2mphpf,dbutlerjr,2,Thu Nov 20 10:23:37 2014 UTC,"The first half, which consists of the Telepath arc, isn't that great but it establishes a few things.  There are also a few experimental standalones that feature characters not part of the main cast.  ""Meditations on the Abyss"" is when the season really takes off IMHO and it's great from there on all the way to the end.  I would say more but then I would be spoiling things."
babylon5,2mphpf,helix400,2,Fri Nov 21 19:53:39 2014 UTC,"I rank the seasons as 4, 3, 2, 5, 1.  The fifth season has some strong episodes.  Day of the Dead is kind of hit or miss for the fans, but it was one of my favorites.  The Londo/G'Kar thing continues as it needs to.  (It sets up the Crusade series and the novels, but unfortunately JMS got cheesy with Crusade and it didn't go very far.)  The telepath plot is interesting, could have been better, but still worth your time.  Lyta's story is engaging.  The only time I got bored in season 5 is the need to wind down every character, and they all seem to end with long winded speeches.  Afterward watch the River of Souls TV movie, it was pretty good."

Whole of season three is a roller coaster with great action and dialogue. But the one scene that always gets me is when Garibaldi reveals the telepath conspiracy to Bester, and Bester in turns explains how he adjusted Michael's mind to become a sleeper agent for PSI Corps.  I have now two more episode left, but I've been delaying it because Sleeping in Night is so emotional and I always get very sad.

Garibaldi gets the girl, has a kid, kicks the alcohol and even finally manages to bag bester, but he too has to live with the tragedies of his previous mistakes.  Lennier betrays the love of his life and dies trying to make up for it.  It's odd when you think about it- considering the shough had hundreds of alien races, a massive space station, many colonies, a few races so powerful that their technology is basically magic, what i love about Babylon 5 is the reality of it all."

babylon5,2kwat6,DarrenGrey,5,Sat Nov 1 00:02:29 2014 UTC,"For me it was the story telling. Plots that lasted seasons some lasted an episode some several. I felt every week I would gain more information on whats happing in the B5 universe either small tidbit on the over all story arch or ending a couple episode plot while starting another one.   When I first found it I was like oh cool a scifi show and watch it because I am a scifi fan. I didn't understand anything I seen. Took 2 or 3 weeks before I was like oh this ties to that and so on. Then if I missed an episode I would be lost until I could see the next because so much happen. I love it and hated it but I was intrigued so keep watching.  Then theres the re-watchability of the show. First time it ended was like dam that was a good series. 2nd time was Ohhh look at all the little things I missed. 3rd was dam I don't remember that. At this point I make it a ritual to re-watch the series every year.  I think there was a lot of insight into the human condition in the series as well and that was just icing on the cake for me.   One of my favorite quotes from Delenn  Before the war, Dukhat wanted to know more about your people, so I began studying your history. I came to the conclusion that of all the races we had encountered, humans were the most dangerous. Because humans form communities. And from that diversity comes a strength that no single race can withstand. That is your strength. And it is that which makes you dangerous."

I didn't realize until I got back into the series at the end of Season 2, beginning of Season 3 that it was changing and there were little things every episode that made a difference much further down the story line.  This show was the first of it's kind in my memory, the first TV show with a continuing, overarching storyline (except maybe X-Files). The space battles also caught my eye in a big way."

The whole range of possible story lines created from this one simple concept drew me in. The way the writers created the interaction of these races and the characters stories hooked me. S1E1 was one of the most alluring series premieres I've seen for a show ever. I was hooked from there and never lost the love for the show.

I really wanted to find out who these guys were.  Then eventually read the Lurker's Guide way back in the infancy of the world wide web and was able to fill in what I had missed - I had seen a few minutes here and there of the show before that, but that's what really hooked me and after that I watched it religiously until season 5 where I guess I started to lose interest for some reason.  I guess because the intended 'end' of the show had passed at the end of season 4 (due to the original season 4 and season 5 story being compressed into season 4) and maybe the material just wasn't as strong after that, though season 5 certainly had some great moments now that I have gone back and watched the whole thing."
babylon5,2kwat6,lolzergrush,1 point,Mon Nov 3 23:04:31 2014 UTC,"The graphics were amazing, the story arc and universe was great, but it all comes down to the characters.  JMS didn't screw around when it came to creating great characters. When the network suits told him to create a hotshot pilot, he gave them a cardboard cutout and deliberately never developed the character, made him stick out like a sore thumb, then killed him off at the first opportunity. The message was clear - don't fuck around with JMS' characters.  At the same time, when JMS decided to give us a new character he wanted to do at Season 3, he gave us Marcus. Within a couple episodes we knew his backstory, his motivations, and the whole fan community was cheering for him. They could have tried to focus all of that energy on Warren Keffer and shoving him down our throats, but a brilliant show creator knows what makes a shitty character and a great one.  The same is true with the whole cast, really. Everyone had room to develop their characters but no one actor was calling the shots or taking control. Most sci-fi shows are about Captain Manly McTestosterone flying around the galaxy getting laid and then the actor becomes a prima donna because the whole show revolves around him which turns the show into shit (cough Andromeda cough) but B5 never went down that road."

babylon5,2khpwd,mdillenbeck,10,Mon Oct 27 22:47:03 2014 UTC,That's not it for me.   I'm happily married now and it's the concept of turning to my wife and saying goodbye before going or to the edge of nowhere to die.   I guess it's the mundane nature of the final death that I find most realistic. He doesn't die as some great hero. He dies alone. It is equated with going for a drive on Sunday and never coming home. Ordinary. Normal.  The banality of out is the human experience.   I think that is why JMS is an extraordinary man - he wrote the character Sheridan and kept him very human.

babylon5,2kev1e,gowronatemybaby7,30,Sun Oct 26 23:21:05 2014 UTC,"It gets better.  The first season puts a lot of pieces on the board, whereas the second season is when they really start moving.  A lot of characters are set up at the beginning to fit into certain archetypes...but after a while the depth really starts to show.  What's more, one repeat viewings, you see the depth and nuance was already there.  I love Babylon 5.  The effects are dated, Sinclair wears on me, and some of the S1 episodes are tough to get through, EVEN knowing the important kernels that are in there.  It's totally worth it.  Some people say to skip the entire first season - I think that's crazy.  There's SO MUCH that's important that occurs.  I say if you're not on board by episode 13 (Signs and Portents, the episode the season is named after) check in again.  Note:  episode 4 of season 1 is perhaps my least favorite of the series."

To watch and understand their development season is indeed very important. But there are some boring episodes in season one. Power through it! The reward is so great you can't possibly imagine. Season three is some of the greatest science fiction on television. Just you wait. I just started rewatching the series yesterday. Am on episode three as we speak, believe Babylon 5 is worth it."

I hated the acting etc. in the first season, Sinclair felt terrible! But I stuck through it because it felt like there was promise. I could feel the kernel of awesome under suck.   Once I was a couple episodes into season two I liked the series. When I watched the season finale I was hooked. I will almost certainly rewatch the entire series after I finish."
babylon5,2kev1e,localgyro,1 point,Mon Oct 27 20:35:28 2014 UTC,I think it's also worth noting that Michael O'Hare (Sinclair) suffered from paranoid delusions. It's the reason he was replaced for season 2.
babylon5,2kev1e,lucius42,1 point,Fri Oct 31 16:04:55 2014 UTC,I didn't know that. Makes sense though considering where the series goes.
babylon5,2kev1e,MaiLaoshi,1 point,Fri Oct 31 16:40:48 2014 UTC,It had to tough on him considering two episodes key to his plot arc dealt with investigating Sinclair's history.
babylon5,2kev1e,GhrabThaar,2,Wed Nov 5 11:38:43 2014 UTC,Season one could almost be considered meeting the characters. It will make things a lot clearer by the time you get to the good part (Seasons 2-4)
babylon5,2kev1e,drummer_San,10,Thu Dec 18 01:52:55 2014 UTC,"First season is rough -- and pretty much everyone admits it.  The lead actor (Sinclair) was replaced after that season, and it's since come out that he was dealing with significant mental issues at the time.  But I wince when I go back and watch first season Star Trek: The Next Generation, too.    Yes, the effects are circa 1995.  They just are.  That you'll have to deal with.    But what it all develops into is ... wonderful."
babylon5,2kev1e,tarrbot,3,Sun Oct 26 23:41:40 2014 UTC,"Hey, I'm a huge Trekkie, so I understand wholly about rocky first seasons. I still think that Star Trek had better effects though, even in '87, but I guess that's just a preference for the real models instead of the CG. Although DS9's full CG models are pretty awesome too."
babylon5,2kev1e,quintus_aurelianus,7,Sun Oct 26 23:50:19 2014 UTC,"You have to admire the fact that Season 1 of Babylon 5 was rendered on Amiga computer farm :) Anyway, the visuals get better somewhat, up to the point where they are comparable to DS9.  Having said that, I can't imagine B5 looking differently - the visuals just grow on you. Trust me."
babylon5,2kev1e,quintus_aurelianus,2,Mon Oct 27 03:43:25 2014 UTC,Upvote for Amiga reference
babylon5,2kev1e,arsenal_is_the_best,6,Mon Oct 27 08:43:56 2014 UTC,"I said it elsewhere but it bears mention... Star Trek's budget was almost an order of magnitude above B5's, especially to start. Give it a chance to grow a little, and you'll be surprised."
babylon5,2kev1e,lucius42,2,Mon Oct 27 06:31:02 2014 UTC,I've heard it said but could never confirm that babylon 5's entire budget for season 1 was still smaller than a single-episode TNG budget.
babylon5,2kev1e,mk262,1 point,Mon Oct 27 17:00:24 2014 UTC,"Something you might want to think about. In TNG, there was a lot of real models at first and by the end of the series, you can't tel the difference between the real models and the CG ones.  Also, Video Toaster/Lightwave was pretty new at the time and it took people a bit to make the most out of the software."
babylon5,2kev1e,GhrabThaar,1 point,Thu Oct 30 23:22:08 2014 UTC,Part of the problem you may be seeing is watching them on modern HD equipment.  The producers always expected the CGI to be rerendered for an HD release (which is why they filmed in widescreen).  Instead they just used the standard definition for the DVDs.  The effects are in lower resolution than the rest of the picture. It looked okay in 1993 on a CRT.  It looks pretty bad on a monitor or a HDTV in 2014.
babylon5,2kev1e,kengou,2,Tue Nov 18 17:53:21 2014 UTC,I'm watching it on my little 2008 macbook. :-)

babylon5,2kev1e,mdillenbeck,7,Wed Nov 19 00:17:34 2014 UTC,"You have to trust your instincts, there are many good reasons to keep watching B5. Hold firm to the path you have set, finish what you started. This series is a deep story about light and darkness, based on high quality science fiction."
babylon5,2kev1e,TotallyNotKen,4,Mon Oct 27 01:49:02 2014 UTC,"Once you get to 1x13, you will either love it or stop watching. But get to 1x13."
babylon5,2kev1e,kengou,3,Mon Oct 27 03:38:27 2014 UTC,You just gotta hang with it.  Season 1 is kinda tough.  I begged my wife for years to watch it.  She finally went ahead and did.  Ended up taking her to a scifi con and she loved it.
babylon5,2kev1e,drummer_San,3,Mon Oct 27 04:49:52 2014 UTC,"Hmm. I'll give it a shot, though my opinions aren't always with the majority.  Wooden acting/character issues: yes, because this was very early in the show and no one had time to grow into their characters. That's really unfortunate but it can't be helped now.  Effects: ... Well. yes, but their budget was basically zero. I want to say the budget for one episode of Next Generation was like... half of a B5 season's budget? It gets better as the show goes, but they really had next to nothing.  Writing: This is... Hold on this one til the end.  Character design/costuming: I'm not sure where this comes from, so I don't know how to respond. Elaborate?  The thing about the show is, a whole lot of it is meant to be taken as a large picture seen across several seasons. Season 1 sets up a whole lot of things that look isolated and pointless until season 2 or 3, but the first time through they seem pointless. Ragesh III and the Narn/Centauri tensions play a big thematic role for the series, but Vir's overacting is off-putting if you don't know there's a larger context at work. The result is, season 1 is much more interesting after you've already seen it, but you need to see at least the high points to get to season 2.  There are some episodes that only fit in tangentially though, and many of them are in early S1, so it presents a ""barrier to entry"" of sorts. If I had to pick the worst ones.... Soul Hunter, Infection, Believers (more of a character piece for Franklin and the ambassadors, can be skipped for plot-relevance the first time), TKO (shamefully bad), Grail (meh). As said elsewhere, episode 13 is when the real show starts, so you at least need to get that far before calling it quits."
babylon5,2kev1e,HoopyFreud,2,Mon Oct 27 06:29:03 2014 UTC,"Man... Soul Hunter and Believers are some of my favorite S1 episodes.  They really set the atmosphere of Babylon 5 so well, and have some terrific acting and writing in them.  Infection and TKO can both be safely skipped, but I can't think of many other episodes I'd tell a newcomer to outright skip.  Most S1 episodes tie into the characters, universe, or story in some meaningful way later."
babylon5,2kev1e,SonuvaGl_tch,1 point,Thu Oct 30 03:36:42 2014 UTC,"I actually like Believers, but almost entirely for Franklin. Soul Hunter just felt cartoony to me, I always wince trying to get through it. I actually like Infection's concept and foreshadowing, but its execution left a lot to be desired. TKO just doesn't belong in this series, I don't even know why it exists."
babylon5,2kev1e,GhrabThaar,2,Fri Oct 31 07:04:46 2014 UTC,Season 1 is dodgy for lack of a better word. Grind through it.
babylon5,2kev1e,DarrenGrey,2,Mon Oct 27 06:33:22 2014 UTC,"Season 1 is fairly episodic in nature.  Season 2 is where the serial nature of the show comes into play.  However, the end of season one? The cliffhanger? Wow.  That hooked me. So watch through to season 2 episode 1 in the minimum.  Season 5 is tough also - they weren't sure they would have it. JMS wrapped up the plots in S4 and filled the finale. S5 episode 1 became the S4 finale.  The finale? I am in tears every time I watch it.  Can you skip S1?  No. JMS wrote 92 of the 110 episodes - info in them are important for later episodes."
babylon5,2kev1e,Coldf1re,2,Mon Oct 27 07:20:18 2014 UTC,"It's a bit wobbly starting out.  And they didn't have the FX budget of being on a network or being a cash-cow franchise.  But there are stories from classic Doctor Who that I really like even though the effects were pretty ridiculous by modern standards; TOS Star Trek is filled with rocks that are styrofoam and skies that are seamless paper backgrounds, and yet people rewatch them over and over.  If it helps with the effects, think of watching a stage play, where people mime being on horses and the like.  The story is worth it."
babylon5,2kev1e,drummer_San,1 point,Mon Oct 27 12:44:30 2014 UTC,Something about the fact that they're CG just really ruins it for me. Dunno why!
babylon5,2kev1e,demoux,1 point,Mon Oct 27 23:10:26 2014 UTC,"The CG in season 1, when you aren't used to it, can be distracting at times.  But if you keep watching, not only will the CG get better, but you'll just get used to it.  There are some seriously amazing space battles that happen in Seasons 3 and 4 that you will NOT want to miss!"
babylon5,2kev1e,drummer_San,2,Thu Oct 30 03:38:20 2014 UTC,"it gets about 1500 times better, and that's not even hyperbole.  Keep going.  but don't let the perceived quality of each individual episode lull you into not paying attention- there are hints and foreshadowing allllll they way back in the first episode."
babylon5,2kev1e,tarrbot,4,Mon Oct 27 16:59:02 2014 UTC,"I'd suggest skipping all of the 1-star episodes on this list: http://mpierre.com/index.php?id=23  All of them are practically if not entirely irrelevant to the larger story. TKO in particular is so bad that after the first time through, I never actually rewatched it. You won't miss much."
babylon5,2kev1e,tarrbot,4,Mon Oct 27 01:20:26 2014 UTC,You could probably cross-reference that with a list of episodes (not) written by JMS.
babylon5,2kev1e,winkie5970,3,Mon Oct 27 03:02:13 2014 UTC,JMS wrote Gray 17 Is Missing. :) No one's perfect...
babylon5,2kev1e,SkullLeader,9,Mon Oct 27 06:31:53 2014 UTC,"Grey 17 gets such bad press, but the other half of that episode (Neroon!) is actually really good."

The game iirc was very realistic to the show right to having to contend with the inertia during firefights, the Narn ship would just fly straight past you if you didnt judge things right then you would be dog fighting for ages whilst trying to get hang of the inertia, with the computer controlled narn ship seemingley having the same problem resulting in many hours spent on just that one mission...

babylon5,2idvip,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Oct 7 04:30:59 2014 UTC,"Section 1. Production background of article  Crusade %28TV series%29:       Like Babylon 5, Crusade was intended to have a five-year story arc, although as Straczynski notes in the DVD commentary for A Call To Arms, it was intended to resolve the Drakh plague after a season or two and move onto other arcs. However, conflicts arose between the producers and executives at TNT, and production was cancelled before the first episode was broadcast.   TNT's research had indicated that the audience for Babylon 5 did not watch other TNT programming, and likewise TNT's main audience was not watching the show, making another related program unattractive to the network's management. Straczynski believes that the network's ""interference""  with the production was an attempt to get out of their contract by allowing them to argue that he failed to deliver the series they wanted.  Thirteen episodes were made and broadcast by TNT, with at least four more scripted. The Sci-Fi Channel attempted to pick up the show and continue production, but was unable to find room in its budget.

Since he's doing pretty will with his other projects; this is fairly likely.  Remakes and reboots are fairly popular these days - good source material, tried and tested; and can pick and choose the bits that worked vs. those that didn't.

Crusade has a more somber tone thanks to the plot and the music.  It feels reflective, thoughtful, mature, but sad at the same time.  They're exploring ancient dead ruins, dealing with leftover shadow tech and the drakh.  Of course, we're only getting a small part of the overall picture due to the early cancellation; later seasons would surely have had different tones, much like Babylon 5 did.  It's a shame we never got to see for ourselves where it was all going.  Babylon 5, in contrast, had a much more epic, operatic feel to it.  There were politicians, emperors, ancient races, the sweeping changes of history.  The tone was at times somber, at times funny, at times fast-paced.  Crusade was a different show, with different themes, tones, and characters.  We also saw a pretty much aborted season, so comparisons may not be the most fair.  I enjoyed both quite a lot."

And some of the CGI... ugh."
babylon5,2i352p,lolzergrush,2,Thu Oct 2 16:31:17 2014 UTC,Babylon 5 had a worse start. If Crusade had been given the same opportunities as B5 to flesh itself out it could have been just as good of a series.

It just felt like whatever they were trying for, it didn't work. Not a high point of Season 5 in my opinion.  I still like the Rebo and Zooty characters in the episode overall, the humor just didn't work even in an ironic sense. Love Penn & Teller's actual work."

babylon5,2i0kk6,Lurker_242,4,Wed Oct 1 18:43:14 2014 UTC,"To answer the main question, I don't remember any spoilers or anything in Thirdspace. There are thematic references to the main plot, but that's about it.  My recommended viewing order would be...  The Gathering -> Seasons 1-4 -> In the Beginning -> Season 5 -> Whatever else. If you move on to Crusade, the plot setup movie was pretty decent for that one. Lost Tales is definitely last.  For Thirdspace specifically... in my opinion JMS struggled with compressed storylines at the time. His strong point has always been large arcs, and you just can't apply the same skillset to a movie as easily, and it does show. I liked it but you really get the idea that he only had two ideas to expand the universe for a while after the events of Season 4 (mysterious aliens that are stronger than us, and mysterious aliens that are MUCH MUCH stronger than us), neither of which ever really panned out anywhere."

I've heard G'kar was in it for a few scenes and that was the sole redeeming factor of the whole mess.  Crusade was interesting and could have been great. The network had basically declared open war on the show immediately and forcibly destroyed its continuity when JMS wasn't making the schlockfest lowest-common-denominator tripe they wanted. It was cancelled halfway through filming the first season, before it even went to air.  I recommend giving it a watch, but check out the lurker's guide's recommended viewing/continuity order and ignore the uniform changes as best you can."

Special effects could have used a bit of work, though, but the show was very ahead of its time in what it tried to do with CGI."

babylon5,2hd4jf,Sampo,15,Wed Sep 24 20:28:41 2014 UTC,"The first, most important thing to understand is that they are all fundamentally different series, with different goals, themes, and ideologies. Trying to pin labels on them would go something like this (Caution! Opinions incoming!):  The Original Series is a ""space western"" with lots of campy setups and social commentary that comes from the era it was born in. I personally find the show thematically and intellectually interesting, but can't stomach watching much of it at a time because it's so over-the-top campy. Oddly, I think the last entry in it is the best... Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.  The Next Generation tried hard to re-gather fans of the original before trying its own thing, and that shows. Season 1 has its moments, and 2 was a big step towards being great, but I hated Pulaski's character. 3-6 were mostly awesome. 7 was mostly terrible (Sub Rosa anyone?). Movies vary greatly in quality.  Deep Space Nine is Paramount directly ripping off B5. They both have their strong points but I think DS9 suffered a bit just by being too formulaic a few times, while completely derailing at others. That said, it had some masterfully done moments and the characters were phenomenal. The closest to B5 is here, sometimes to the point that it's uncomfortable to watch, and it has a slow start as well. But... You'll probably find this one the most agreeable as a jumping point.  Voyager ... Hmm. They wasted a lot of potential and the execution of many things just fell short. Above all it suffers heavily from the ""Status Quo is God"" mentality that just doesn't cut it these days. Of all the series, this one has the fewest great episodes, and the most stinkers.  Enterprise Had a lot of things going for it, but isn't the best place to start. I may not be the one to judge though. I really liked the season (second? I think) that did a season-long arc that led from one episode to the next and tried to be coherent. No one else in the fandom did, and they ended the whole plot in one of the dumbest moves imaginable. So... save this one for later and come back to it if the rest draws you in.  Honorary mention to:  Galaxy Quest which is considered by many Trek fans to be a worthy parody entry into the culture as a whole. It's hilarious if you love trek, and hilarious for many different reasons if you don't. It's simply great, and I'd recommend it to anyone regardless."
babylon5,2hd4jf,GhrabThaar,4,Wed Sep 24 23:53:43 2014 UTC,"I agree with this list. I would recommend going through the best episodes of TNG and then jumping right into DS9. DS9 is a fantastic show, and one that any B5 fan should enjoy, despite the rip off elements that it includes. It eventually found its own feet and worked well."
babylon5,2hd4jf,Theopholus,3,Thu Sep 25 04:29:22 2014 UTC,"Sub Rosa   Sub Rosa was definitely terrible and unnecessarily creepy (in a sexual way, not scary creepy), but I think Genesis takes the cake for worst episode of season 7. When Genesis ended my mother laughed out loud while I sat fuming. After seven seasons that was the kind of horse shit and complete disregard for factual background they were gonna smear on my TV?   Anyway, I agree DS9 is the closest to B5, though from what I have seen of B5, B5 is the better written show.   DS9 is easy to understand without having seen TNG, but I would recommend starting with TNG. You get a much better understanding of the federation and the players involved in DS9."
babylon5,2hd4jf,WakeUp_SmellTheAshes,3,Thu Sep 25 18:21:44 2014 UTC,"To be fair, Trek as a whole never, ever cared the least bit for ""facts"" and ""realism."" You can time-travel by flying around the sun! Spock's missing his brain! Darmok and Jelad! Holodeck Safety! Worf is a terrorist! ""Prime Directive""! The list goes on.  I actually didn't mind Genesis, because I couldn't take it seriously. Compare Voyager's Threshold where we're ""evolving by de-evolving"" into orange salamander things. That one was so bad it's kinda hilariously good. It watches like a parody of Trek and from the description there's no way you'd think it was real.  What really got me was Voyager's demonstration that a Captain's job can involve willfully murdering their crew members for no reason. Tuvix, yes. That one was a real nadir for the franchise."
babylon5,2hd4jf,GhrabThaar,2,Thu Sep 25 22:46:00 2014 UTC,"Excellent list here. One thing I would emphasize again is that if you're looking for stronger story arcs, DS9 and Enterprise are the ones that had it in the later seasons. Star Trek was always full of standalone/filler episodes.   Despite that, it is my personal belief that Picard is the best captain (I love you Sisko but only as a friend) so watch TNG."
babylon5,2hd4jf,Nyarlonthep,1 point,Thu Sep 25 19:53:44 2014 UTC,"Deep Space Nine...   and the characters were phenomenal.    I know there are differences of opinion on DS9, but I couldn't enjoy it (and I did watch it all through), and one of the biggest reasons was the characters.  Every one of them was boring, flat, and unlikable to me.  I just can not think of one character I liked.  And Avery Brooks is one of the worst actors I have ever seen.  Ugh."
babylon5,2hd4jf,kengou,6,Thu Oct 9 20:29:05 2014 UTC,"I highly recommend Deep Space Nine to any sci-fi fan. B5 often gets compared to Deep Space Nine in various and sometimes unfavorable ways. As a fan of both my two cents are this. B5 is better written than DS9, especially in the sense that it tells a much more intricate and coherent overarching story and is probably the best written sci-fi series ever. However it's ambitions were often limited by it's small budget. Deep Space Nine by virtue of its larger budget was in almost all ways a better produced series on an episode to episode basis. It could afford better sets, effects, costumes, make-up and A-list actors. While the frame of its narrative had sometimes jarring shifts in tone, scale and focus, DS9 had competent writers like Ronald D. Moore helming it and produced some of my favorite characters and dramatic moments in any TV series. The two parter ""Improbable Cause/The Die is Cast"" is the best example of this and the scenes between Andrew Robinson (Garak) and René Auberjonois (Odo) are absolutely stunning."
babylon5,2hd4jf,iansarmy1,4,Fri Sep 26 11:37:38 2014 UTC,"I really enjoyed original series.  I'm nostalgic for next gen as I watched it as a kid but it doesn't really hold up.  I agree that DS9 was great from season three onwards.    Babylon 5 is really the king of science fiction TV for me though just because of the foreshadowing and long story arcs.   Saying that,  if your looking for something else to watch try Andromeda,  its a bit daft in places but i really enjoyed it.  Farscape is another one to look at too,  very very good especially towards the end."

It's not a rip off of B5 but I could write a decent essay on some comparisons/contrasts between the two shows.  All of the other Trek series are not without their charm though.  The original series was campy but often entertaining.  The Next Generation was a solid series as well though it was more episodic.  Voyager had potential and some good episodes but rarely executed we'll.  I didn't want much Enterprise so can't really comment much.  If I could make one overarching comparison between the two shows, it is this: Star Trek is a more idealized view of the future whereas I've always felt that B5 represents ""the real world"" and what the future is more likely to look/feel like."

Sadly, there's a lot of set up in season 1 that pays off beautifully later on. I'd advise grinding through season 1 for those, just know that it gets like twice as good in season 2, then 3 and 4 kick ass.  The beauty of it is it's one story arc that was well planned for 5 seasons -- so as I said theres little hints and setups all the way through that get connected seasons later.    BUT.. The network wasn't so sure they were going to give them a season 5, so seasons 4 and 5 get jammed into season 4.  But it's still very good.   (Then season 5 gets tacked on and it's kind of aimless.  There's some shit about Vidal Sassoun rebel telepaths waging a war for better quality hair products or something. Its dull, but their hair is really really fabulous for people supposedly living on the run from the authorities. )  I'd recommend it.  Seriously, good stuff.  The CGI gets a little better as it goes, but some things are just a product of their time -- like TOS. Enjoy!  Edit: spelling"

You know how awesome DS9 is as the dominion war goes deeper and deeper?  B5 is even better than that, but it's the whole show.  This is from a person who watched DS9 first.  My brother nagged me to watch B5.  I plodded through season 1 to humour him, all the while cringing at every poor set piece, every bad acting job, every terrible graphic.  But once the story heats up, that all dissolves away.  And I think they start getting bigger budgets as the seasons roll by."

babylon5,2ha9rp,dylzim,8,Fri Oct 10 07:02:21 2014 UTC,"I used to be a big Trekkie until I watched Babylon 5. Then it ruined all other sci-fi for me till Farscape came along, and even these days I find myself turned off by series that don't manage to have coherent story continuity (curse you, BSG!)  It's not perfect though, and many parts haven't aged well. Personally I enjoy having a laugh at the terrible outfits and props (what the hell is with the cheap plastic thing Delenn keeps building?) And oh, the hairstyles... Some of the make-up is awesome though, and who would have suspected the Centauri hairstyle could be pulled off with gravitas! The space battles also get much much better as the series goes on.  It helps to have someone to watch with, so you can discuss the story as it unfolds and try to pick out what's relevant for later. Also, check out the Moderator's list for some idea of when the good eps are rolling in: http://mpierre.com/index.php?id=23"
babylon5,2ha9rp,DarrenGrey,5,Wed Sep 24 12:48:20 2014 UTC,"Obviously, this subreddit is very bias'd for B5. We absolutely love it and will praise it endlessly. With that said...  Season 1 can be tough to get through. You do have to remember that CGI was done in-house on the first edition of Lightwave in the early 90s. It does get better as the sfx artists get better (and Lightwave was updated as well); however, once you are done with the series and rewatch it later on, you'll see the beauty of Season 1. It was really well executed and starts a few plot lines that run through the entire series, little bit by little bit. I think it's worth watching, but it's not super necessary. They always remind and mildly re-explain things that the audience may have forgotten."

babylon5,2ha9rp,Solarshield,4,Fri Sep 26 18:59:18 2014 UTC,"I like both, but to be honest, B5 doesn't feel at all like Star Trek, even when you compare it to DS9. B5 plays out more like an epic fantasy and even has all the purely fantastical elements to go with that while Star Trek is more strict sci-fi. At the same time, B5 is more careful with regard to common physics than Star Trek is, e.g. ships fly around in 3D and aren't all ""right side up"" and engines are in use only to speed up and slow down.  I would find a viewing guide to get you through Season 1, which has some critical episodes, but is mostly awful. Season 5 has some decent episodes, too, but even if you skip the whole thing, you won't miss out on much.  My favorite thing about B5 by far is that the story was more or less planned out from the onset. If you watch the pilot movie, there are subtle references to things that become important to the plot as late as season 4. I honestly don't think there is another show out there that can make that claim.  It's also worth noting that the acting gets better as the series progresses. In the first season, it feels like you have Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar, and also Tomalak on TNG) and Peter Jurassic (Londo) who regularly upstage everyone else, but after, better actors are brought in and the ones who stay significantly improve (especially Jerry Doyle who played Garibaldi, in my opinion)."
babylon5,2ha9rp,misho88,2,Wed Sep 24 02:27:37 2014 UTC,Andreas Katsulas showed up in an episode of Enterprise recently. It was the happiest and saddest I've been while watching that show.

babylon5,2ha9rp,Solarshield,3,Fri Sep 26 16:02:05 2014 UTC,"So, should I try to force myself into B5? Does it get better after a season or 2?   Yes and yes. Season 1 introduces the universe as a slow crawl, then Season 2 starts to runs with it. Season 3 and 4 basically throw a jet pack on you for good measure.  The thing you need to realize is that Babylon 5 is very much a slow burn. A lot of the character development and plot get kind of thrown around (and radically transformed) as you get deeper into the series.  Some things that seem unnecessary actually turn out to be very relevent.  In the end you'll probably find more appreciation for Season 1 after Season 2. Because little things that were grating are fixed or presented in a new light that gives them much more weight."
babylon5,2ha9rp,thegenregeek,2,Wed Sep 24 02:50:59 2014 UTC,"I watched B5 and DS9 side by side during their first run and liked them both despite the controversy over the similarity of the shows.   I would recommend doing a selection of episodes from Season 1 so that you get an establishment of the characters and the basic setup of the series.  Midnight on the Firing Line - First episode Mind War - Sets up the telepaths And the Sky Full of Stars - Sets up Sinclair's history Signs and Portents - Sets up the Shadows Babylon Squared - Babylon 4 and Chrysalis - Season Finale.  There are other great episodes in Season 1, but these give you all the setup you need for the show.  Then you can go back and watch the rest of Season 1 once you're hooked.  Season 5 likewise has issues, especially the first half, but the telepath payoff is pretty good, the Centauri arc is strong, and the finale is probably one of the best ever to come out of a sci fi show."
babylon5,2ha9rp,Stile4aly,2,Wed Sep 24 03:07:16 2014 UTC,As a person who has watched ds9 so much that i can recite almost every line... Absolutely worth it. As some have said season one is kinda meh but once you get through it then it is everything you ever wanted ds9 to be.
babylon5,2ha9rp,nateinks,2,Wed Sep 24 03:34:01 2014 UTC,"I think one often overlooked aspect of B5 that makes it kick even more ass is the increasingly relevant Nightwatch storyline, especially with all the stuff about the NSA coming out in recent years."
babylon5,2ha9rp,Stupid_Ned_Stark,2,Wed Sep 24 06:51:45 2014 UTC,"Personally, as a Star Trek TNG fan (though not a DS9 fan) I loved B5. The first thing you have to realize, though, is that at the time no one believed any sci-fi IP could succeed if it wasn't Star Trek, so funds were scarce and it had a lot to prove. But if you can endure the first season's low budgety-ness and some spots of bad acting and melodrama, trust me when I say season 2 will make your hair stand on end. You will be at the edge of your seat.  It builds the universe very well, sowing seeds of storylines that pay off episodes, sometimes seasons down the road. Most of the story arcs were carefully plotted before the series even began and it truly shows. No episodes like LOST where you wondered if they just made it up as they went along and had no idea what was coming. When mysteries pay off you leap out of your seat.  You may find it richer and more detailed and gritty than DS9 ever managed to achieve. I envy you your first watching of the series. Enjoy it -I think you'll love it."
babylon5,2ha9rp,ademnus,2,Wed Sep 24 09:00:08 2014 UTC,like LOST where you wondered if they just made it up as they went along and had no idea what was coming   That also bugged me with Galactica.
babylon5,2ha9rp,Sampo,3,Wed Sep 24 19:31:23 2014 UTC,"Yes, i feel the same way! It was an amazing show with a very poor payoff. It was like they just never had a plan and figured they'd think of something at the last minute."
babylon5,2ha9rp,ademnus,2,Wed Sep 24 19:40:56 2014 UTC,Watch the pilot. Season 1 has its moments but is dodgy.. watch all of it. Season 2 onwards rocks... Season 5 not so much but the end episode are awesome. Agree with GoronoP.
babylon5,2ha9rp,RogueWedge,2,Wed Sep 24 12:28:38 2014 UTC,DS9 and B5 are two of my favourite TV shows.  Season 4 of B5 is easily my favourite season of any science fiction TV show.
babylon5,2ha9rp,spaece_daemon,2,Wed Sep 24 14:06:44 2014 UTC,"If one is inclined to skip episodes of Season 1 (I would advise against it), one must absolutely see    Midnight on the Firing Line Born to the Purple The Parliament of Dreams Mind War And the Sky Full of Stars By Any Means Necessary Signs and Portents A Voice in the Wilderness Pts 1 & 2 Babylon Squared Chrysalis   These are, in my opinion, the ten most important episodes of the season. Once you get past Season 1, the pace picks up, and there are perhaps a half dozen ""bad"" episodes in the next three seasons (Confessions and Lamentations, Exogenesis, Grey 17 is Missing - I'm looking in your general direction). Season 5 is riddled with ""bad"" episodes - the overall problem seems to me as though most of the ""A"" plots for Season 5 were crammed into Season 4 when it appeared the show would be cancelled, and then when the last minute renewal came through, much of what was left were ""B"" and ""C"" plots that had little connection to the main storyline, the telepath storyline that feels very rushed and the other major plot point of the season."
babylon5,2ha9rp,danwincen,2,Thu Sep 25 15:13:46 2014 UTC,"^ Relevant Username ^  Yes. Season 1 & 2 are rough, like many shows, the crew & cast take a season or two to really figure out how to make the show flow, but they're necessary for character and plot development.  After that, things start really rolling.  That being said, it was planned for five seasons, but the network was iffy whether they'd get them, so they crammed a lot of the resolutions from 5 into 4, and then 5 ended up happening and being weaker for it, but it's still worth watching."

I'd have to say that with the exception of episodes such as Far Beyond the Stars, I didn't find DS9 as deep as Bab 5; certainly there wasn't so much of an overreaching arc.  Honestly, I think the question you should be asking, is whether you'll like it because you like authors such as asimov - Babylon 5 certainly panders more towards a sci fi audience, whereas DS9 had a very specific intent to capture a wider audience."

babylon5,2h8wcn,FKRMunkiBoi,6,Tue Sep 23 18:14:08 2014 UTC,"This.  The first season is just...bad at times.  The costumes are low-budget, the plots are weak, the dialogue is bad, and several actors get replaced.  The core storyline doesn't really get going until the second half of S1, but there are a few episodes here and there that do lay the groundwork and context for the amazing things that are to come.  The show eventually becomes very well funded and they fix all the bugs.  Just stick with it, watch every episode, and trust that it will be amazing very soon.  After you watch the whole show, go back and rewatch the story arc episodes of S1.  It will blow you away how much foreshadowing and foundation-laying was done that early on in the show, when you consider that in real life it was five or six years long.  Straczynski had the whole story in mind right from the beginning, right down to details."

babylon5,2h8wcn,lolzergrush,8,Tue Oct 7 01:49:00 2014 UTC,"My impressions of this show are this.  Straczynski worked very hard on the writing and the plot line develops very well.  Season 1 is much like a soap opera and leaves you wondering if the show is really going anywhere.  The show gets progressively darker and complex as it gets into the other seasons.  Also take a lot of it with a grain of salt because it is an older show after all. There are also more important plot related episodes than not, unlike some other shows.  I love shows like Stargate because there are hundreds of episodes, but B5 really seals it all up in the 5 seasons it has.    Take some time after each episode and read about it from the Lurkers Guide from the sidebar.  It is extremely detailed and really gets you thinking about the plot line."
babylon5,2h8wcn,prophetfxb,2,Tue Sep 23 18:17:04 2014 UTC,"You know, I hear a lot of ""Season 1 isn't that good"", but I absolutely loved Season 1. I'm gathering it's a minority opinion?"
babylon5,2h8wcn,flameofmiztli,3,Thu Sep 25 01:13:51 2014 UTC,"Same as I.  It's not that its not good, it just has a different direction.  Some really comedic interaction between Londo and G'Kar as well in S1.  The lighter times on B5 were very enjoyable."
babylon5,2h8wcn,prophetfxb,1 point,Thu Sep 25 01:36:29 2014 UTC,I think a lot elements from Season #1 got dropped or re-worked in later seasons.

There is a lot of great stuff to love in that first season and it's necessary to watch to understand what comes later though.

babylon5,2h3j6h,chazwhiz,5,Mon Sep 22 18:58:37 2014 UTC,"It was very detailed including things like a shapeshifting security guard and a widower for a station commander, as well as a highly detailed story arc where the Federation comes into contact with a powerful species whose motivations lie in the diametric opposition of chaos and order.  After Paramount ""co-opted"" the series bible, JMS was basically told he could make a big stink about it which might block the production of DS9 but he would burn a lot of bridges and he'd never work in television again. It was that, or just accept it so that at least he could have a shot at doing his own show on a more obscure network with a smaller budget.  JMS had to actually omit many of his own ideas from Babylon 5 since they didn't have the money to fight an infringement suit. In he end, he probably felt like he was taking it lying down but if he hadn't we never would have gotten B5. Even if Paramount had let JMS produce the Trek series he'd pitched, they never would have given him the freedom that he had, so it all worked out for the best."

After that and Bab5 I feel that Farscape rounds out a nice top 3. Then Stargate but I still need to see the last few seasons. The new Battlestar Galactica has been good but I've only watched about half of the first season.  I keep waiting for a new Sci-fi series that's anywhere near the caliber of these to show up. Anyone know of one I've missed that's currently running? The closest I can think of would be Doctor Who but it feels more fantasy than Sci-fi.

Stargate wasnt bad, firefly was meh, and bsg was a huge disappointment (and not just the finale).  Space Above and beyond was quite good - but its a bit dated now and had a short run.  Another good sci-fi show, although not of the space opera sort, are Dark skies and warehouse 13.  Part of the problem OP is that its quite hard for shows to survive long enough to a) find an audience b) develop their story.  Either they find an audience but dont know how to do the story (ie. BSG), or they have a story but cant keep the audience ( Dark skies)  Edit:  not quite sci-fi - but carnivale was excellent as well"
babylon5,2h3j6h,MatthewGeer,4,Tue Sep 23 22:01:48 2014 UTC,"I'll say I have very widespread and eclectic tastes in entertainment, so take it as you will. I don't think Trek or the other sf stuff really holds a candle because B5 wasn't about science fiction, really. That said, Brisco County was the first boxed set I ever owned, so you have good taste.  Big Ol' +1 to LEXX. Seasons 1-3 were masterful. I love Lexx.  Warehouse 13 was a gem while it was on, until it got cancelled (very) suddenly between seasons 4 and 5. First 4 are mostly awesome, though. 5 is hastily strained to get syndication rights done and only 6 eps, and the quality suffered greatly, but it still has its moments.  The recent Battlestar Galactica series was basically two pretty good seasons followed by a long, painful, slow motion train wreck. I stubbornly suffered through all of it and then abandoned TV for two years in despair. Thumbs down.  Marvel's Agents of SHIELD is great if you like any Marvel stuff at all. First season starts slowly but it gets really good later on, and I have to support any series that still does 20+ episode seasons.  Sleepy Hollow was fun. Lots of grim occult stuff and a bit of fun alternate history thrown in, too. More fantasy than SF, but sue me, I liked it.  And because you're never too old for cartoons....  Futurama - what else can I say? It's awesome.  The Venture Brothers - Two-fisted pulp tales and mad science collide. Failure and comedy ensue.   Rick and Morty - It's the drunken love-child of Doctor Who, Sliders, and Back to the Future, with a big dose of macabre humor and dark comedy. I haven't seen many, but what I have seen are all great."

babylon5,2h3j6h,seeingeyefrog,6,Mon Sep 22 18:03:23 2014 UTC,"Firefly is short but extremely well-made. It also has a ""warmth"" to it that you only find in B5 and Farscape. Farscape is weird and unusual, but very much worth it, if only because it is amusing to have aliens with Aussi accents. The 'concluding' mini-series/film, the Peacekeeper Wars, is terrible though. BSG (Reimagined) is also excellent, although the deus-ex-machina stuff at the end is pretty bad for the most part. It has a big reveal in S3, like B5, but i thought the latter executed it better. TNG is the best Star Trek, although not without its flaws (Data gets on your nerves after 5 seasons).  DS9 is basically Star Trek's interpretation of B5. There's a Dukat, a lizard race involved in an occupation and genocide, a prototype escort ship, etc. It is the most mature Trek series, and is worth it just for episodes like 'Duet' alone. Doctor Who is very old (it starts several years before the original Star Trek) but it's a true classic. The first Doctor is pretty bad, but it picks up after that. It's really interesting that through this series you can see how society changed, especially in regard to the treatment of women and the environment. It also seems to have been the inspiration for the Borg, the human Cylons and the first Alien film. And i've only seen half of it so far, who knows what else they inspired?"

babylon5,2h3j6h,scealfada,2,Mon Sep 22 17:56:35 2014 UTC,Best part for me of E:FC is the opening theme. Probably the best opening theme in any TV show.
babylon5,2h3j6h,scealfada,5,Tue Sep 23 05:25:16 2014 UTC,"Some newer shows, like Falling Skies, haven't been terrible, but I agree with the other commenters. Babylon 5 is unparalleled.  I've been watching Defiance, and it's pretty bad. Every driving force, motivation or problem feels forced, and there's not too much major story development during the seasons until the finale where, again, the story feels forced and comes out of nearly nowhere.  The new BSG was alright, until it fell apart towards the end when they basically swapped from a survival theme to religious salvation. But it was alright. I felt Stargate Universe showed some brilliant promise but it was, unfortunately, cancelled.   I can't find a comparison to Babylon 5. Nothing has captured the scale of a galactic battle as Babylon 5 did. Nor do any of the other shows have the excellent characters that B5 does. Perhaps because it was pretty much written in it's entirety before it started filming, but Babylon 5 never feels forced like the rest of the TV shows out there. I'd love to find something else like B5, but nothing has come close.  Thinking about it today, B5 was even more amazing. There are few sets, even fewer location shoots and not much in the way of CG (at the beginning), and yet it still managed to capture an entire universe at war.   EDIT: While not strictly scifi, though it is at times, LOST! How could I have forgot!   Also, Earth: Final Conflict was interesting. It gets a bit convoluted towards the end, but it was quite entertaining.  I'm sure you have seen it already, but The X-Files is very good. Lots of filler, but the alien plots, colonization, virus, abduction, Syndicate... There's a lot to go with. I stop at the end of season 7, though. Just before Doggett comes in."
babylon5,2h3j6h,gordonp,3,Mon Sep 22 05:47:10 2014 UTC,"Thing is, even though people might not be happy about it, there were religious themes in BSG right from the start. I think people secretly hoped some of those religious aspects would turn out to be completely explained by science. Many were, but there were some big ones that were not. The show combined religion and science quite well for the most part,  SPOILER: but let science down a little at the end, which I think made some people angry."
babylon5,2h3j6h,Brewjo,4,Mon Sep 22 09:38:58 2014 UTC,"Actually I was more angry that the entire show reeked of shoddy writing and the staff openly, publicly admitted to just not caring about plot integrity. One of the writers said they picked the Final Five by putting names on a dartboard and then narrowing that list down to whoever made the least sense.  That's not a good thing to do (especially not a good thing to admit) when the big draw of the early part of the shows was that everything had been meticulously planned out and would definitely lead to a satisfying conclusion.  I felt the marketing hype was specifically targeted at people who like B5-style arcs to string them along while the quality of the show just went downhill consistently from Season 3 onward."

I think that the way BSG handled it was forced on the viewer though. It felt to me that they'd run themselves aground with a complex story they'd been generating, got to series finale time without a plan, and took a simple shortcut. Religious themes are fine, even interesting and add some great depth to a story, but BSG didn't handle it well, I don't think."
babylon5,2h3j6h,gordonp,2,Mon Sep 22 13:28:29 2014 UTC,"Compared to B5, they did not. But I did still enjoy the story, and it ended better than some other sci-fi shows in my opinion."

There were political themes, but no one turned out to be George Washington. There were also military themes, but no one revealed themselves to be literally Hitler.  And to be fair, the religious themes in the first 2 seasons were along the lines of ""look at the stupid junk these backward idiots believe."" Then it turns out to be literally true, with no foreshadowing.  Deus ex machina is the weakest shit a writer can pull.  Best first 2 seasons, worst last 2. I wish it had been canceled like Firefly."

You have to keep in mind that the Cylon religion was heavily implied to be the true religion, as it combined human and Cylon in it's teachings. That is the one that turned out to be most true, while the prophecies of the human religion had truth to it, but was never able to predict that humans and Cylons would come together. Instead the human religion only served to prepare them a little for the Cylons.  I'm not saying it was brilliantly written, but I felt that it made enough sense. The Cara Threase being an angel thing was definitely stupid. I agree on that. The Gaias and '6' being more than human made a bit more sense, since they were both having religious visions of each other, and there actually seemed to be a point to it."

But it really wasn't good.  But for a decent syndicated Steampunk show might be ""The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne"" from '99.  I've only seen one or two episodes.  Also, if you liked Brisco County Jr., you might liken ""Jack of All Trades"".  It also stars Bruce Campbell.  There was a lot of interesting syndicated stuff on in the '90s.

Oh, and I have to throw in the Anime series Heroic Age. It has fantastic space battle sequences that would suit a B5 fan very well plus the  way the bridges on human ships lock down, raise the captains platform and turn the entire deck into a real-time, 3D, 360 degree view of the battle begs to be used in Omega Class Destroyers...."

babylon5,2h3j6h,Solarshield,2,Mon Sep 22 20:14:06 2014 UTC,[perhaps some spoilers for Battlestar Galactica]  Why all the hate for Battlestar Galactica? I loved every single season of the show. From a lot of comments it seems that people hated it after season 2. You are right that it changes because it becomes a totally different show. It becomes a show about the characters. Commander Adama and his grief over his sons death. Apollo and his relationship with his father after all he is the second son and trying to impress his father while trying to become his own man. Cara with her coming to terms with her past with Apollo and his brother and her own ego always needing to be the best and not wanting to get close to anyone. Sal and his wife are an interesting dynamic. With his loyalty to Adama and his love for his wife. She is attracted to power and Sal is second in command. He doesn't want to hurt or disappoint his long time friend and commander because he is the reason he is there in the first place. Also all the politics of trying to keep a bunch of humans from killing each other. Presidential elections and assassination attempts. Characters that you truly care about. That's why I love this show. It made me feel. It does have its slow points but it is worth it. Please please watch it.

There's apparently a romantic relationship brewing between Talia and Ivanova? I gathered this was a bit controversial?    Yes, there was. Ivanova admits as much during ""Ceremonies of Light and Dark"" If I recall correctly, JMS took some heat from the network for it and wasn't able to show it properly.   Why did Talia leave and Lita replace her? They were clearly building up Talia for 2 seasons, so i'm guessing there was some sort of fallout with the actress.   Correct. I believe I heard Andrea Thompson left because she wanted to be a more recurring character?  Every main character in Babylon 5 actually had what JMS called a ""trapdoor"" - a secondary character that could step up and replace the character if one of the actors left. (IE, the aides could replace the ambassadors, Ivanova could replace Sheridan, etc). Lyta's case is kind of weird because she was the original telepath in the pilot, got replaced by Talia and then came back to replace Talia in the end."

That's really a shame, for all of the ""benign neglect"" that the network gave B5 during its run they decided to interfere because of a romantic relationship between two consenting adults who happened to be the same sex.  It wasn't even like it was just lesbian kisses played up for ratings during sweeps week (I'm looking at you, Roseanne)...this was two characters with a very complex history who were destined to be at complete odds with each other since a very early age. Susan hated the Psi Corps for what they did to her mother, while Talia was raised by the Corps and was only beginning to distrust them since she found out about Lionheart. Seeing them gradually overcome this predetermined conflict, grow respect for each other over the show's run and form a connection would have been an outstanding dramatic point. I guess it's all moot since Andrea Thompson left the show, and JMS wrapped it up as well as could be expected in Season 3...and Lyta had great chemistry with everyone so it all worked out."
babylon5,2h1gfi,lolzergrush,11,Mon Sep 22 03:10:47 2014 UTC,"Every character had a trap door built in that would allow the actor to leave the show without messing up the story too much.  IIRC, had Talia stayed, she would have been enhanced by the vorlons the same way lyta was, and would have taken over that part of the story.  Since Andrea wanted to leave, the control personality story was implemented and she was replaced by Lyta.  Yes, Ivanova and Talia were romantically involved.  Yes, they slept together.  I don't know how much farther that plotline would have gone even if she had stayed."
babylon5,2h1gfi,drummer_San,8,Sun Sep 21 16:07:29 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure the main motivation for having the Vorlons fiddle with Lyta was because she wasn't there to be fiddled with by the unstable super-telepath who gave Talia her expanding telekinetic powers earlier in the series. Given that Talia was already put on a path towards becoming a super-telepath, it's unlikely that they would have bothered establishing a redundant Vorlon plot point to achieve the same end had Andrea remained with the programme."

babylon5,2h1gfi,vmos,3,Sun Sep 21 17:05:26 2014 UTC,I don't think she would have been enhanced by the vorlons. Remember the episode where her boyfriend shows up and he has super telepath powers and ends up turning into some sort of energy being? He grants Talia a gift and at the end of the episode she throws a penny through the wall with her mind. We probably would have seen the latent powers he granted her growing until she also became a super telepath.
babylon5,2h1gfi,lolzergrush,7,Mon Sep 22 12:50:14 2014 UTC,"Everyone else pretty much covered it, but just to add - Andrea Thompson and Jerry Doyle (Garibaldi) met filming Season 1 and got married, but they were in divorce proceedings by the end of Season 2. It was apparently an amicable break-up but even still it had to make things difficult.  Talia and Garibaldi did have a romantic arc planned, though it was much lighter than Talia's and Ivanova's arc, but , well...even between the most professional actors in the world, having the chemistry of a playful, comedic workplace romance between your characters with someone you've just divorced is pretty damned difficult. I wouldn't be surprised if JMS simply had too many concerns that this would be a risk, so when Andrea decided to leave he didn't fight her on it and they parted ways professionally."

There wasn't a same-sex kiss on network television until Buffy the Vampire Slayer in 2001, and Joss Whedon had to throw every ounce of his weight behind it. JMS probably had enough battles to fight on other fronts without forcing this issue.  That said, fascinating relationship. It was a shame to see it get cut off.  (Edit: Upon review, there were prior gay kisses. Few and far between. BtVS had it between regular characters actually developing a relationship, not one-offs.)"

Beginning in 1991 with a kiss on the American L.A. Law series' episode ""He's a Crowd"" between C.J. Lamb and Abby Perkins,  David E. Kelley, who wrote the episode in question, went on to use the trope in at least two of his other shows. Subsequent television series included an episode in which a seemingly heterosexual female character engages in a kiss with a possibly lesbian or bisexual character. In most instances, the potential of a relationship between the women does not survive past the episode and the lesbian or suspected lesbian never appears again.

babylon5,2g9c82,qwantz,2,Sat Sep 13 16:34:13 2014 UTC,"Final Notes: I wrote this trying to keep in mind what made Babylon 5 such a great series.  The concepts of loyalty, of sacrifice, of order and chaos, and of transcendence, becoming something more than you once were, were all driving points of each character's story, and the story at large.  Although this is only the most basic of outlines, and is head-fanon at that, I feel that it presents the story of babylon 5 in new ways- the vorlon/shadow order/chaos battle is presented in an entirely new way, with new players, new facets for each side, and most importantly, with the previous hero, Captain Sheridan, portraying an antagonistic role for a large part of the series.    The two men are equals and opposites- one acting on his own gamblers instinct, following the cause of doing good, the other acting on a sense of what is right, and a chain of command he was willing, and did, fight for at one point- both fighting for what they truly believe in.  Lochley is caught in the middle, allowing for a great deal of growth in her character as she struggles with her choice- she owes Sheridan her career, her placement at Babylon 5, a great deal of respect and even some lingering love, but she also has grown to care for and respect Gideon, as well.  The outline depicts two major points of transcendence- when Gideon is reborn with some proto-vorlon capabilities, culminating in the nearly omnipotent (if someone reluctant to use his powers) Galen acquiescing representing Gideon's transcendence.  Likewise, the Excalibur defeating three Minbari war-cruisers (a ship that is considered nearly invulnerable to any of the younger races) demonstrates that the ship itself is a force to be reckoned with.  Gideon is the man with the lever, and the Excalibur is his immovable place to stand.  The final battle, with the drakh fleet choosing to self-destruct rather than face the wrath of the once-more united Interstellar Alliance, demonstrates once again that the humanity is the glue that brings a disparate collection of races together.  I imagine a scene, during the final battle, in which a narn heavy fighter is being tailed by a drakh fighter, and calls out ""Mayday, assistance needed. Bogey locked on, directly behind.  Mayday, assistance needed,"" and he receives a communication from a Centauri fighter wing- ""Narn Heavy fighter six-two, we are in position to assist.  Prepare to break port."" And then we see the centauri wing save the narn pilot from destruction.  A personal moment of transcendence between two otherwise faceless pilots, each of a race that was out for the others' blood just a few years earlier.  Well, this only took three hours.  What do you think?"

babylon5,2g71bh,WonderfulTonight,7,Fri Sep 12 12:29:07 2014 UTC,"Does it capture the B5 feel?  No, I can't say that it captured any piece of it at all. I was thinking more of the radar vector display from the old-school Battlestar Galactica (1980s) TV series. I think you captured old-school Battlestar Galactica crossed with a romance novel. Probably not what you were going for?  Onto other comments:   The guy's hair projects an image like some sort of anime romance novel hearththrob? Not my thing. The shirt doesn't communicate anything about the character (do the hexagons make it Cyberpunk?). I can't figure out why a keyboard is partially projected over the radar. I also can't figure out why some things on the display are reversed while others things are not. His recessed jaw, mouth, and philtrum disturbs me. It took some closer inspection for me to see that the scars were actually sweat.   I read the page about your game. I like the concept, for what it is worth. I just dislike this illustration, and back to the point, I think that it does nothing to invoke B5."

Did you like the graphic material presented on the about page?"
babylon5,2g71bh,Atari_Historian,4,Fri Sep 12 17:14:48 2014 UTC,"Limiting my comments to the artwork: I like everything up until the negotiations screen for the Schilla qween. On that particular page, your hexagon background is strongly working against readability.   Below that image, I dislike much of what I see.  The character portraits really bug me. They look like a medieval painting crossed with abstract impressionism, which actually is fine by itself, but has a strong visual conflict with the more cyberpunkish interface. That conflict makes everything look cheap.  The versions with the more muted colors don't seem to clash as much. Compare this muted scientist with these saturated portraits. Toning them down would be one way to resolve this mismatch.  Of course, you could go another direction to resolve this conflict (which given the effort, I can understand if you are reluctant): rework your interface. This is just a design opinion, so take it at face value: if you're going to do something cyberpunk-ish, do it awesome, or don't do it at all.  Perhaps an interface that is more neon colors would work well with the portraits. Perhaps something inspired by a Star Trek LCARS interface with solid blocks of saturated color?  Really, if you devise an interface that matched the artistic style of the portraits, that has the potential to be really quirky in a good way."

I've experienced it and seen it happen to other indie developers.  Frankly, I'm tired of it. Why don't you go and explore our forums?

I know what good public relations is supposed to be. But I wasn't there when the rulebook was made. When I defend myself I feel that I show how passionate we are about our games and our company, and that I won't take shit from anyone. I just feel that I have the right to do that.  If everybody always does the same as everybody else then nothing will ever change. Whenever a customer has been unhappy with our products we have given them a refund no trouble no hassle.

babylon5,2fp1to,lolzergrush,2,Wed Sep 10 15:48:03 2014 UTC,"This is all so poignant because of the sheer arrogance of the politicians & generals at the beginning of this movie. Earth was the indisputable ""good guy"" of the galaxy, having just entered a galactic war at the right time and place to halt crazed army of conquerors bent on genocide. They'd won - and hell everybody liked them. All they had to do was keep some sense of humility and enter the sphere of galactic politics cautiously and everything would have been fine...but nope. They had to go kicking over anthills just to let everyone know there was a new big kid on the block.  Justifications like ""man's natural state is war"" and ""we're a martial society"" (seriously that phrase appears in protocol officers' handbooks) are used every time someone wants to expand their sphere of influence - whether national  interests, statewide paranoia, or just sheer boredom. The eventual outcome is tragic and it just makes you want to go back in time to the point where some politicians were sitting around a mahogany desk and shout at them ""Okay right here is the moment you're making decisions that are going to cause a horrible shitload of death and human misery. Right now. You're doing it. Stop,"" but of course you can't.  If humans made contact with aliens tomorrow, this is exactly the kind of thing the US would start pulling - and we'd piss off some extremely powerful alien race that wipes us out. There'd be no one around to say ""I told you so"" just like here."

babylon5,2fjn5u,mexter,6,Fri Sep 5 17:06:14 2014 UTC,B5 did that constnatly. It was a series of flashbacks. There needs to be a supercut version that takes all the flashbacks out.

There's a couple of episodes where Londo has a very similar conversation with Vir at the start - about how he's being too sympathetic to the minbari in his 'reports'.  Binge-watching makes this apear almost like a mistake - same scene happening twice, but a week apart to digest the show made it feel like time had passed."

WB would have to re-create all the CGI, but if the movie is a smash hit (or at least successful enough to raise the profile of the B5 name), I could see them making it happen. Per episode, it'd probably cost at least as much as the Star Trek remasters that are currently happening, but that money would definitely be recouped in sales. JMS said in 2006 that the DVDs had generated over $500 million in revenue, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if that had been doubled in the 8 years since.

babylon5,2fdsqe,kraetos,15,Thu Sep 4 03:36:55 2014 UTC,Almost certainly not. The source files for the CGI are long gone and the live action stuff probably wasn't filmed with enough resolution for a 1080p conversion to be worthwhile. (A lot of pre-2000s television was not filmed with any kind of longevity in mind.) 480p is the end of the line for B5 which means going past DVD is pointless.
babylon5,2fdsqe,merreborn,18,Wed Sep 3 19:22:47 2014 UTC,The live action stuff was filmed on 35mm.  And in 16:9.  Longevity was absolutely a priority for the producers.  Not so much the studios.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5#Mastering_problems  The CGI stuff you mentioned is the biggest limiting factor.

Mastering problems of article  Babylon 5:       While the series was in pre-production, studios were looking at ways for their existing shows to make the transition from the then-standard 4:3 aspect ratio to the widescreen formats that would accompany the next generation of televisions. After visiting Warner Bros., who were stretching the horizontal interval for an episode of Lois & Clark, producer John Copeland convinced them to allow Babylon 5 to be shot on Super 35mm film stock. ""The idea being that we would telecine to 4:3 for the original broadcast of the series.

babylon5,2fdsqe,XNormal,2,Thu Sep 4 00:23:13 2014 UTC,I believe that technology similar to this may be used to essentially analyze the CGI footage back into models and re-render them at higher resolution.
babylon5,2fdsqe,demonstar55,2,Tue Sep 16 20:25:05 2014 UTC,"Pretty much all pre-2000 stuff was shot with longevity in mind, or maybe not, but they were all most likely shot on film, which means they can just be reprocessed and ta-da it looks wonderful. They actually went out of their way to make sure everything looked good under 16:9, but the CGI wasn't rendered at 16:9 at the time because it was pointless. And then the CGI studio went under and the CGI source files were lost.  From what I understand, they actually found some other sources for CGI stuff so if they released DVDs they could make those scenes look better (also make the rest look better since they have better tech now to transfer them), but no one wants to spend that money.  If the CGI was found, we'd probably get some really sexy bluray releases, but they probably won't, so the best we could get is probably TNG quality bluray release, if someone convinces the higher ups to give them enough money :P"
babylon5,2fdsqe,jerslan,6,Thu Sep 4 02:54:57 2014 UTC,"TNG quality would actually be better than if no CGI is found at all.... Very little of the original effects needed to be reshot/CGI-ed for TNG... They still had all the film negatives, and they were WAY more detailed than the eventual VHS composites for original Air Date. Having all of that made it easier, only the handful of actual CGI components needed to be updated.  This is also why DS9 and Voyager are a bit more difficult... The later seasons of DS9 and almost all of Voyager relied more on CGI than crazy detailed physical models. That CGI takes a lot more work to update than just remastering the original physical SFX shots..."
babylon5,2fdsqe,tygirwulf,3,Thu Sep 4 07:41:32 2014 UTC,"I've always wondered, why couldn't new CGI be created? What use would the ancient files be? Wouldn't everything have to have new models, textures, shaders, and animations anyway?"
babylon5,2fdsqe,juhae,2,Thu Sep 4 06:22:06 2014 UTC,"Sure could. I think the main point (ahem, main expense) is that creating new CGIs for the whole show would take quite a bit of time. Rendering is quick nowadays, but to set up the scenes from scratch, with only the tv show renders as a guiding point... That's going to take some time and money.  Just being able to make use of the old scene setups and animation paths would be a lot faster. Or maybe just rerender everything in HD, but it brings the problem of texture resolutions, model details and so forth."

No one even spoke ill of O'Hare at all until he passed away - and it was his wishes that it be revealed he was difficult to work with (and why).

babylon5,2f8e9q,Atari_Historian,1 point,Tue Sep 2 15:10:44 2014 UTC,Hmm. Kevin Spacey as Morden...
babylon5,2f8e9q,dbutlerjr,5,Tue Sep 2 18:19:12 2014 UTC,"Hmm... definitely a difficult chore to cast these characters... lemme give it a go... a few of them I'll be copying from Bewjo because some of them are quite good...   Sheridan: I disagree that the recast can be ignored... I actually think a true reboot MUST have both Sheridan and Sinclair, though I actually think Sinclair becomes something of a minor character in terms of screen time but who has a strong arc throughout... Sheridan is there from the start, with Sinclair popping up as necessary... so I've got to cast both (argh, making it harder on myself!) so for Sheridan I go with Christian Bale.  I think he's got all the qualities you'd want for Sheridan, though Sheridan could be funny at times and I'm not sure I've seen much of that from Bale so that'd be my one concern.  Otherwise, he can obviously own the screen and lead, as Sheridan should. Delenn: Lena Heady.  Delenn has to be played by a lady of extreme strength who can also show tenderness and wisdom.  I think Heady is perfect for that.  She can be hard (Game of Thrones) and also motherly (Sarah Connor Chronicles, and also, interestingly, Game of Thrones!) Ivanova: I love the pick of Laura Prepon, excellent choice Brewjo, I can definitely see that!  She can play tough, can inject some humor and can also do some serious acting when needed.  Orange is the New Black proves all of it alone.  But, in the end, I'm going to go another way: Kate Mara.  I think her work on House of Cards was amazing and assuming she can be a little less soft-spoken I think she could nail Ivanova. Garibaldi - Jerry Doyle!  Here's my thinking... when the movie MASH went to series, they kept one character played by the same actor (Radar) to kind of link them together... I think I'd like to see the same thing happen here.  Of all the actors still available I think Doyle would be the best choice.  The character was present start to finish, played an integral role throughout and in that way is a lot like Radar.  I toyed with the idea of having Delenn be this link, but I actually think it's got to be almost a secondary character... I hesitate to call Garibaldi secondary, but I think in comparison to the four real mains (Sheridan, Delenn, G'Kar and Londo) it fits.  If not Doyle then Carl Urban works well for me too. Londo: Lee Pace.  Because, really, who CAN'T this man play well?!  No, seriously... Londo has to be a tragic figure who can also be funny and deadly serious at the drop of a dime.  Pace has proven he can be funny (Pushing Daisies) and can be dangerous and evil when needed (Guardians of the Galaxy) and also tragic and flawed (Halt and Catch Fire).  G'Kar: Denzel Washington.  I mean, if we're going to dream big, let's dream REALLY big!  He's absolutely got the gravitas to play G'Kar and he can swing between intense anger and calm, caring tones like Katsulas could.  As everyone says, this is the toughest to recast, but I like Denzel for this. Lennier: Silas Weit Mitchell.  Gotta admit I didn't know his work much but after a little looking into him, yeah, I can see this too.  Thanks Brewjo! Franklin: David Hewlett.  It's a reboot after all, so the black-to-white change doesn't matter much.  I think using Hewlett would provide an actor that can do all the sorts of technical speeches Franklin sometimes had to do (well, as much as B5 ever really did that sort of thing, which was limited compared to other shows) and also can infuse some humor, which was something Franklin did from time to time (not as much as Garibaldi, but Doyle and Hewlett together could make for some comedy gold I suspect). Sinclair: Gary Oldman.  I think he'd have to channel a combination of a number of characters he's played over the years, but he's certainly a good enough actor to pull it off... my fear is he's always got a little bit of neurosis in his voice and that's definitely not something you can have in Sinclair... he's got to be calming, soothing, always in control... I think Oldman could pull it off though.  Thinking of him as Gordon in Batman, he spoke with authority (in the last two movies anyway) and that makes me think he could do it. Vir: Sean Astin.  I think his LotR work proves he can do the sidekick gig well... I think he's got the innocence about him too that Vir needs to have, and he had some funny bits too so I suspect he's got the comedy chops. Also going to give you a Marcus, since that's the other ""major"" character I think has to be in there somewhere.  I'm going with Tom Hiddleston.  We know he can kick ass ala Loki, and we know he can also play the emotionally damaged character (err, again, Loki!)... I can totally see his unrequited love arc with Ivanova playing out with him and Kate Mara.   So, yeah, all of these roles are damned near impossible to recast, and getting all these actors together would likely be cost-prohibitive on top of it all... but I gave it a shot :)"

It doesn't have to make sense. The Shadows, like the Vorlons, are a galactic super/hyper power dedicated to ""checking"" their enemy. Their interests spanned beyond simple borders, economies and even traditional power. They were dedicated to cultivating their ""playground"", which was the whole damn galaxy. They didn't care about building ""borders"" because that's transitory and thinking small. They wanted control of the entire galaxy and view that as theirs.   In all honesty the Shadows could have launched a surprise attack on the homeworld of any of these empires and wiped them out over night (they could destroy entire planets!). But doing so would incur retaliation from the Vorlon's. That's what the Shadows were focused on, winning and proving they were the rightful rulers of the galaxy.  It wasn't invading a neighbor to take their space. It was dismantling the Vorlon's control in the latest iteration of their galactic cold war. To prove the Vorlon's were wrong.   Wouldn't it make more sense for them to tackle the already-unstable EA and the Mimbari first?   Well, they did infiltrate the EA... well before the Narn/Centauri conflict (if we go by Dr. Mary Kirkish's statements.   The Minbari had the closest connection to the Vorlons of all the younger races. Additionally all of Minbari culture was structured around the next Shadow War. Kind of hard to infiltrate their society when they have 1000 years of history dedicated to preparing to fight you and they treat the Vorlon's word as gospel. Better to avoid them, destabilize the weaker societies the Vorlon's haven't influenced and deal with the Minbari last."

Our son is safe"" was because they had dealt with that problem."
babylon5,2danba,stemdaken,12,Tue Aug 12 01:53:35 2014 UTC,"Such an intense scene. While G'Kar obviously drives that final nail with his speech in the meeting chamber, that look on Londo's face during says it's all: he didn't win.

G'Kar is my favorite character, no doubt. Moreso than Sheridan or Garibaldi.   And the subtle rise and fall and rise between G'Kar and Londo is exemplary. I have never seen the likes of it in any series.   Londo with his initial bravado and aspirations and G'Kar with his snide and nasty curtness and disdain.  Both give way to the polar opposites of themselves from the beginning of the series.   If G'Kar is my favorite then by extension, Londo is my favorite. The ascension of G'Kar can't be seen without the tragedy of Londo. Both characters are just so impeccably portrayed and stunning in their dance with each other.

babylon5,2d4sno,Circuitfire,4,Sun Aug 10 12:11:27 2014 UTC,This would be great. My  understanding is that the show was filmed in HD but that the visuals were lost. Thus we're stuck with 480p CGI.
babylon5,2d4sno,mexter,2,Sun Aug 10 19:54:39 2014 UTC,"I believe you are correct, I think it was filmed HD, but converted was one of the first shows to be stored digitally, and they only stored what they used at the time. So the 480p resolution is all that remains. I know with Star Trek TNG, it was actually put to film then centercut to 3:4, but retained the film negatives, which allowed the HD upgrades they have been doing."
babylon5,2d4sno,Circuitfire,2,Sun Aug 10 20:17:08 2014 UTC,"Not entirely true. The film originals but all the SFX files were lost in bankruptcy sales and general bad storage practices, so when the time came to master the DVDs they upscaled the 480i and 576i masters for NTSC and PAL regions. Hence the PAL versions look a little better.  A similar project to the Star Trek enhancements could be done, but Star Trek has a bigger market.

Does Straczynski think he told the story he wanted the way he wanted? If he thinks a reboot is the way to go then I'm ok with it, we will always have the original tv series."
babylon5,2d4sno,FullMetalBitch,11,Sun Aug 10 07:53:52 2014 UTC,"I think the biggest problem with rebooting it was that for the first 3 seasons, it really was the story JMS wanted to tell. Season 4 was a rushed version of seasons 4 & 5 combined, then the 5th season was what was cut from the original 4 & 5. So essentially, you'd get the first 3 seasons nearly identical to the original. Hard to maintain an audience for a story that's already been told with few changes.  edit: Plus, who can ever follow the dynamic of Londo and G'Kar? Peter Jurasik and Andreas Katsulas were so iconic in their characters, and the interplay between them would be almost impossible to match, much less improve on."
babylon5,2d4sno,Circuitfire,5,Sun Aug 10 15:26:30 2014 UTC,"I do believe he changed things on the fly often in the first 3 season, but he did get to almost everything, I'm pretty sure he didn't plan on getting rid of Michael O'Hare when he started.

babylon5,2d4sno,bswalsh,6,Mon Aug 11 20:03:53 2014 UTC,"Completely agree. Most of the spin-off stuff was dreadful (okay, maybe an overstatement, but it was nowhere near on par with the main series). I fear a Star Wars-esque level of disappointment from any new content.  And how in space could they hope to recapture the glory of the series in a single movie? B5 took 3 seasons to really reach its height."

I'm thinking assassination plot (something they did at least half a dozen times through the series) involving a sleeper who had already suffered death by personality with the free mars movement set up to take the fall.  They would need to show things more than just talk about them and form something of an arc for the characters while setting up the universe which is tricky but not impossible to do."
babylon5,2d4sno,Chicken2nite,7,Mon Aug 11 19:13:41 2014 UTC,"I love the original series. I own it all on DVD, and have watched it multiple times. I love the story in general and many of the characters, but in hindsight I think that there are a lot of episodes that are a bit thin, and a lot of speeches or story lines that got repeated.  I get the feeling that with JMS writing the majority of the show that perhaps it was too much for him. Instead of 22 episodes a season the series could have gotten away with the 13 that a lot of HBO-style shows use, trimmed out a lot of the fat, and had a stronger story."

babylon5,2d4sno,jeheregh,11,Mon Aug 11 00:25:36 2014 UTC,"Let me tell you why that's a terrible opinion.  You can ignore anything new. However, whenever a reboot comes along, studios are more inclined to spend the money to restore the older titles in their catalog.   If Babylon 5 were to be rebooted and became mega-successful, then WB is actually far more likely to spend the money to restore the original series in HD.   And no, the classic series is not ""perfect the way it is"". It will eventually be lost to apathy by future generations who will never give a blurry SD series with dated CGI a chance. An HD restoration will help bring in new fans, and increases it's chances for more future syndication runs.   If B5 is left alone, it will eventually fade into history. That would be a terrible shame."
babylon5,2d4sno,FKRMunkiBoi,3,Sun Aug 10 23:59:17 2014 UTC,"Exactly. The Babylon 5 we know and love will still exist but if nothing changes it will fade away. We might not like the new version, but so what? Our version lives on.  To me it is similar to Evangelion. The original anime + end of evangelion movie are excellent and I don't particulally like the direction the reboot movies are taking, but you know what? I don't care.  Enjoy what we had and be hopeful for what we might have in the future, maybe it gets done in a way to attract old and new fans."
babylon5,2d4sno,kaleph,6,Mon Aug 11 03:22:02 2014 UTC,"I love Babylon 5 as much as the next guy, but it's unpalatable for the current generation. The effects, costumes, and makeup are quite dated.

I love the original series and agree that story wise it is as close to perfect as can be, but when things are forgotten, as Babylon 5 is becoming, they die off. It'll die off with our generation and will be a mostly forgotten blip on the sci fi television universe.  If a successful reboot happens, not only will it bring new fans (even if its bad) but it'll stir up interest in the original series. Only then do I think we ever have a chance of getting the recreated CGI. Only when Warner sees that they could actually make their money back.  I look at what all the spin offs/reboots did for Star Trek over the years and see how beloved the original series still is and the relevance that it has. I could only wish that Babylon 5 would gain that sort of success in the future. Plus, I don't think JMS would let us own with something this big, if it even happens."

They had one of these for all of the characters. This is why Sheridan came in during the second season, O'Hare was having ""health issues"" and couldn't continue as a series regular... So they activated his ""trap door"" of being re-assigned to Minbar as an Ambassador, and brought in the Character of Sheridan with just a few key alterations to the long-term story plan."

babylon5,2d4sno,Ohmstar,2,Sun Aug 10 14:16:15 2014 UTC,"While I'd like them to just leave it as is, something ""new"" might be good overall for the genre.  Not sure about you guys, but with the absence of stargate on air, TV sci-fi is just kinda stagnant with promising ideas that turn into relationship dramas with a dash of tech.  While a ""reboot"" of sorts will be be on the big screen, it will end up being good for the tv world as well.    That said, reboot/remakes are seldom as good as the original.  This is a bit different though since it's in JMS hands and not some floozy the network is handing it off too.  It's JMS world, I'll live in it."
babylon5,2d4sno,tarrbot,2,Mon Aug 11 02:32:39 2014 UTC,"No matter what happens with big screen reboots, I'll always have my DVDs (and books and comics) of the original Babylon 5. Nothing can take the series away from me.  I am both excited and apprehensive about the reboot. If it's one singular movie, there's no way to do the story any justice. If it's a series of movies (even just, say, three), I think there's a lot more potential for it to be good. With JMS behind it, I have faith that they won't ruin the series. And seeing a new take on Babylon 5 with today's graphics could be a lot of fun.   If there is enough interest in the movies, maybe they'll actually release Babylon 5 on blu-ray with touched up CGI sequences (or, like a lot of shows, blu-ray with the option for original or upgraded CGI).   My biggest worry is the actors. I can't imagine anyone else in the world playing the roles of Delenn, Londo, G'Kar, Ivanova, and all of the others.   But, no matter what, I'll always love the Babylon 5 that we have. If the new movie(s) end up being terrible, I'll view them in much the same way that I do Transformers and Ninja Turtles: unnecessary alternate universe tales where everyone and everything is stupid."

Essentially think the world of the guy, but... he's only one man. He can fail just as easily as anyone can. One medium is not the same as another and while some can transition between them, some can't.  Case in point is Chris Roberts, the designer of the Wing Commander series). A video game that had Mark Hamill, Malcolm McDowell, John Rhys-Davies, Jason Bernard, Tim Curry and others in roles. Great great series. Can't adore it enough.  Then the movie comes out.  Worst piece of sci-fi I have ever seen, bar none. It was so awful I walked out of the theater. Never have I done that before.  And the movie was directed by none other than Chris Roberts himself.   I have no idea how that happened but it was a horrible movie. Utterly and ridiculously horrible.  At any rate, they will not take my memories of Babylon 5 away from me just like they can't take my memories of Wing Commander the video game from me."
babylon5,2d1s3z,antdude,13,Sat Aug 9 05:31:26 2014 UTC,I have serious doubts of this happening. It is nothing but a thought in JMS' head at this point. It's been 15 years. The series isn't even available to stream. If you asked most people they would have little idea what Babylon 5 is.  They even joked about it's obscurity in Breaking Bad.  I love the show. I rewatch it to this day. But until I hear of production actually starting I'll remain skeptical.

Not saying it automatically means it will be good, but there is a huge difference between working on something you created and have a vested interest in and coming up with a new story for a character someone else created and has been around for half a century."

It's no small task. There is an assumption that Deep Space Nine won't even get the HD treatment due to the costs involved, and Trek has a much larger documented fan base to justify the expense. If you want to see B5 in HD, buy TNG Blurays. Buy lots and lots of TNG Blurays. It's a financial decision the studio is unlikely to make without significant financial justification. A feature film might be that justification, concurrent release would mean an automatic cross-promotional synergy."

The last two offerings, make that three if you include Crusade, have been very disappointing to me. At the same time i feel the bar has been set pretty low by these disappointments, and other current scifi offerings, so i guess there is hope.  The B5 story had, and still has, real world relevance, an incredible acting crew, fantastic art and music that tied it all together. Despite how many times i see the show i still feel the intended emotional ups and downs. I hold little hope that a movie reboot will rekindle any of those sparks.

I'm happy Stewart Copeland declined when they asked him to score the series. Christopher Franke's music is just awesome. I bought several of the soundtracks for the show too. Only one spot seemed foul to me: in season 4, in the ep with Garibaldi and Sheridan on Mars when he's getting abducted, whoever did the music for that scene pretty much ripped off Strange Days' soundtrack.. blatantly. No idea if it was homage or just ""need to find something QUICK"".  That lady who played Takashima.. she's been on lots of other stuff and her acting has never improved. The doctor guy .. NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN (thank god).  The neat thing about the pilot is that Pat Tallman is in it, and then they find a way to bring her back later when the NYPD Blue chick quit the show. Always thought that was neat."

Really? I wouldn't say that, especially when Juliette was already doing a cover of PJ Harvey's song in the first place. Either way, I think the B5 version is my favorite of the 3.  From what I understand, JMS recycled part Takashima's plotline for Talia's exit. Always thought that was neat. The doctor from The Gathering gets a nod in Midnight on the Firing Line when Franklin is introduced and a few times in later episodes."

But the thing that seems like a ripoff is.. on the soundtrack, the tracks are arranged so the song by the rapper who died is next (not sequential like that in the movie) but the songs in that episode move from one into the next. Can't be coincidental.  Oh and Juliette Lewis did it better for sure. The PJ Harvey version sounds like something someone sings to fail out of first round American Idol. WTF"
babylon5,2cvzsg,wmblathers,13,Thu Aug 7 15:02:05 2014 UTC,"If this is truly a reboot, then they will need to have a series of movies to tell the story. I can't possibly see the story of the Shadow War being told in one 2.5 hour movie.  That being said, I place my trust in JMS. He has never steered me wrong."
babylon5,2cvzsg,tenkadaiichi,9,Thu Aug 7 15:58:37 2014 UTC,"Personally I'd rather they go back into the existing universe and tell the story of the Dilgar War.   It's early enough in the universe to allow for a self contained story that can be set up in a first movie (maybe Earth Force cadets of Starfury pilots?). With the option to push it out into 3 movies covering the whole affair (second a major battle, third a final battle). They could even include a number of subtle ties to the existing universe for fans, like Sinclair's father as their commander or instructor."
babylon5,2cvzsg,thegenregeek,7,Thu Aug 7 16:30:24 2014 UTC,"My preference would be for the Telepath War. The little snippets we were given in Crusade weren't enough.  For the Dilgar war, there's some great fanfiction out there that deals with it in a very well done and thought out way (despite the constant typos, and so on). Sinclair's dad was a commander of a starfury wing and Garibaldi's dad was a gropo, so there were the tie-ins you mentioned. Londo and G'Kar even had cameos. Bester, too, as a brand new Psi-Cop recruit who got his butt handed to him.   And the whole story was wrapped up nicely and fit in with everything I remember from the history of the universe. I really don't need any more from that period. I consider this to be good enough, and sufficiently canonical."
babylon5,2cvzsg,tenkadaiichi,5,Thu Aug 7 16:44:05 2014 UTC,"My preference would be for the Telepath War.   Only problem with doing a Telepath War movie is you'd need a number of B5 players back to do it right (At a minimum Bester, Lyta and Lennier). And to be blunt the actors aren't getting any younger.  The last time JMS tried to get a movie going with Warner Bros what killed it was his refusal to recast any actors for established parts, because the studio at the time wanted all new younger actors to play the same roles.  As cool as the Telepath War might seem, I don't believe it could be done without gutting the soul of the series (it's original actors). Which raises the question, is it worth it in the first place for existing fans? ( And, would new viewers be able to jump into such a movie and not confused about what the TW is about?)  Setting it in the same universe at a different point in time, with new younger actors, gets around the studios concerns about dropping millions on it. It opens the story to new viewers who have no context about what the universe is about. All the while still making it something establish fans can enjoy as it ties into events they are already aware of.  A reboot doesn't necessarily have to mean dropping everything that came before it. (Though, sadly nowadays when reboot is used it means remaking the same concept with new actors, which it sounds like JMS wants to do now). Technically Star Trek: The Next Generation was a reboot of the Star Trek franchise."
babylon5,2cvzsg,thegenregeek,1 point,Thu Aug 7 21:12:05 2014 UTC,"Honestly I would be okay with them recasting Lyta. As much as I like Pat Tallman, she was a fairly minor character in B5 as a whole.  Bill Mumy would be under makeup and prosthetics for the whole thing, so he can be any age. (Why would he need to be around? I forget). Walter Keonig... you have a point t here. I can't see Bester as anybody but Checkov. While he had an even smaller role than Lyta, he owned all the scenes he was in."
babylon5,2cvzsg,tenkadaiichi,3,Thu Aug 7 21:34:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah, to me there can be no Bester without Walter Koenig. He made me hate how much I loved him (and vice versa).  Interesting tidbit, Pat Tallman is currently the CEO of Studio JMS, which would basically mean she's the one actor from the series closest to being available for a cameo/return. Or it could automatically mean she'd be too busy for such a commitment. Either way she's technically involved in anything that would come out of this reboot."
babylon5,2cvzsg,thegenregeek,3,Thu Aug 7 21:49:33 2014 UTC,"Bester was a GREAT role for Koenig, and he filled it wonderfully.  He may have aged, but you could probably fold that into the story.  Mumy could totally be hidden beneath the prosthetics and makeup, so that wouldn't worry me.  Now, could we get Vir back?  I loved Vir."

If Warner Bro. doesn't pick up the project he has to decide on rather to fund it himself on a budget of $80-$100 million. That is a huge gamble and I honestly hope he doesn't take it. He would never make that money back and it could ruin him financially. And Warner doesn't seem to have any interest in the B5 property. They haven't done anything with it for so long.

babylon5,2cvzsg,beaverteeth92,3,Fri Aug 8 18:02:28 2014 UTC,"The entirety of the B5 universe was constructed to tell the 5-season arc of the original show. Everything came together so cleanly, and every character fit into the plot so tightly, and the continuity is in it's lowest-energy state.   That's part of why I could never get into Crusade. It felt like I was watching the janitors sweep the empty stage after the play has ended."
babylon5,2cvzsg,dahud,2,Fri Aug 8 18:05:46 2014 UTC,"Except for the fact that Season 4 and 5 were shortened because he thought they were getting canceled.

Going back and getting a re-do could mean we could the original version of the story we never saw because Michael O'Hare left."
babylon5,2cvzsg,warplayer,1 point,Fri Aug 8 19:09:38 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but ""Crusade"" was a separate series with a separate focus all its own, and the Evan Chen musical scores most certainly didn't help it either.   I think it would be easy to do a movie set later in the timeline with all new characters and an all new focus, without tying it so directly to the television series if Joe or the studio is afraid it might hurt its box office take. They don't have to play that aspect of it up in the media is all, just be very subtle about it, if asked by a reporter about it, subtly dodge the question, then later on, after the movie has been released, acknowledge whether it's set in the same universe as the TV series. But to reboot the thing with different actors stepping into those iconic roles? For fans of the show, that could and probably would be very jarring and I suspect it won't work for a lot of people.  This conversation also already came up once years ago, where it was suggested to imagine the saga with Michael Douglas (when he was younger obviously) stepping into the role of Sheridan, and Julia Roberts (when she was younger also obviously) playing Delenn.

That said, J. Michael Straczynski has stated that he would like to use cast members from the series, such as Bruce Boxleitner and Mira Furlan, in new roles in the feature film. “I’d love to see Bruce as the President of the Earth Alliance”, he said.   Huh? How is it a reboot if they're using the same actors for the same roles, and they're jumping straight to President Sheridan? (Also, President of the Earth Alliance? When did that happen? He's president of both now?)  Is this like a Star Trek style reboot? Draal decides to send Sheridan back in time to change the timeline in some way? Or am I misunderstanding this entirely, and JMS is saying he'd like to cast Boxleitner as Clark? (Think Richard Hatch as Tom Zarek.)  Also the idea of rebooting B5 as a movie seems very strange to me given that we're in the middle of a ""Golden Age"" of serialized television (which I would argue B5 was the template for in the first place) whereas Hollywood seems to be stuck churning out one mediocre superhero movie after another."

And a movie would be compressing the 18 or so hours of content from season 1 into 2 hours, meaning he'd get even less visibility.

babylon5,2cvzsg,Enderschoice,1 point,Fri Aug 8 14:43:58 2014 UTC,"The telepath war is a much richer story vein, IMHO, than the Dilgar war or any other ""little green men are fighting us!"" story. Telepaths are human, came out of nowhere and you can't tell them apart from the general population. That's f'kin terrifying, as was well-described in the books.  It's in the same area as the Galactica reboot with the human-looking Cylons. They could be anyone, but in this case they can also tell what you are thinking...how do you fight that, when you have to assume any of your ideas are instantly known to the enemy?  JMS could riff on asymmetric war, terrorism, torture etc. Much juicier material than ""The Blergs are attacking, rawr!"""

babylon5,2cn4sa,TomTitTot,15,Wed Sep 3 19:31:50 2014 UTC,"I'm afraid you're watching the wrong show if you're not ready for some unexplained beyond-our-comprehension plot devices. The way I look at it is that Babylon 5 wanted to explore more than just technological advances and politics; the show aspired to explore ideas of spirituality (through characters like G'Kar), destiny, fate and even God. Episodes like Day of the Dead are best enjoyed as pleasant mysteries, magic as it's intended to be. You suspect there's a rational explanation, but you can't figure it out... yet."
babylon5,2cn4sa,goodhumansbad,-2,Tue Aug 5 00:52:59 2014 UTC,What rational explanations can you come up with for this phenomena?
babylon5,2cn4sa,UberMonkey21,9,Tue Aug 5 01:24:17 2014 UTC,"Sorry fellow ""ant"" I can't give you an answer."
babylon5,2cn4sa,Pupvote_And_Kick_Ass,2,Tue Aug 5 09:36:02 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I think this is the way to go. There is that old saying, that if technology is advanced enough it will look like magic. I mean they never really explain organic technology, how does a ship possess sentience? But you never really question it. The Brakiri stumbled upon technology far beyond what they can explain, and what we could understand. It happened, just accept it, and enjoy the episode for what it is."
babylon5,2cn4sa,drummer_San,4,Sun Sep 7 19:50:06 2014 UTC,"there are any number of possible precedents for a reality-altering experience such as the one in Day of the Dead.   Vorlons can literally tear holes in reality, snatch people through time, modify races on a genetic level.  Same with most of the other first ones. Even the Minbari have some pseudo-scientific powers: The triluminary can recognize a person's ""soul.""  Delenn says ""even the minbari do not have the ability to control a time rift as unstable as this"" (the implication being they can control and utilize time rifts that are more stable). Nearly anything in the babylon 5 universe can be done with the appropriate application of energy- resurrection, healing, killing, traveling, creating matter...."
babylon5,2cn4sa,Cragnous,5,Tue Aug 5 17:00:43 2014 UTC,"The vorlons never traveled through time as far as I recall... they got Jack the Ripper from his own time period and just held him in stasis for hundreds of years.  And the Minbari triluminary works based on DNA analysis - human ""souls"" is what they call human DNA, I believe this is pretty explicit in Season 4.  That is a very interesting point about the Minbari controlling time rifts...  And it's not that this event is impossible, as you say there's plenty of precedents for ways it may have happened.  But they never even try for any explanation.  The only one they talk about is that the section of the station is now thousands of light years away, which has NO precedent as far as I know... all other races utilize Hyperspace, even First Ones, as far as I recall.  Instantaneous FTL teleportation is not something supported by the B5 universe.  I just wish they had attempted to at least posit some explanations in-show, and not just leave it."
babylon5,2cn4sa,drummer_San,6,Tue Aug 5 17:08:21 2014 UTC,"Well they have techno mages and Sheridan resurrects, I just assume it's some kind of alien power or technology that we are not made aware of."

babylon5,2cn4sa,owlmanatt,3,Tue Aug 5 00:57:41 2014 UTC,"In Soul Hunter, that could very easily be explained (and this explanation is even brought up) as a personality matrix being stored after physical death of the brain.  It's left open-ended whether this is what happens.  Minbari also believe in souls existing after death - this is fueled in part by the Triluminary and Valen mixing minbari and human souls, all of which we know is based on technology from Epsilon 3 (and time travel).  So far before this point, everything in the show that was mysterious or fantastical was explainable (even if left vague) by science, even the seemingly godlike First Ones.  Explanations are at least hinted at every single time.  But not so with this episode."
babylon5,2cn4sa,DarrenGrey,4,Tue Aug 5 01:23:30 2014 UTC,"How do the soul hunters have magic soul-sense of when someone ""great"" is dying?  I agree the Dead thing is more of a stretch. I find the story of the episode compelling though, especially... ah wait, you haven't seen that yet... ;)  I strongly recommend you avoid some of the B5 spin-off stuff, as some of it is way worse."
babylon5,2cn4sa,warplayer,1 point,Tue Aug 5 01:35:28 2014 UTC,"You're only thinking of that in a religious context because Delenn, and to a lesser degree, Sinclair, were biased to present it in that way.  Snapshotting mind states isn't something unfathomable in the B5 universe; the Ikaran war machine from season one had a (partial) snapshot of a scientist. I'm sure some species has figured out the mechanics of psi well enough to remotely grab a mindstate and run it on a computer or small amount of biomass.  The lights and gas can be explained as gimmicks masking the underlying technology. There's even a precedent for that -- the technomages' tech was wrapped up in all kinds of layers of ritualistic bullshit. The smoke & mirrors there kept anyone from asking questions, but it was really just Shadow tech being passed out by the Drahk.   And it's a bit of a stretch, but the whole 'I can sense death~ oooo spoky~' thing can also be explained away with 'a telepath did it'."
babylon5,2cn4sa,owlmanatt,3,Wed Aug 6 10:20:57 2014 UTC,"All right, telepaths then - what a load of nonsense they are! ;) Of course if you want to use mystical psi energy to explain the Soul Hunters you could probably wrangle something similar for the Brakiri.  It's funny how we accept some fantasy tropes in scifi but not others."
babylon5,2cn4sa,warplayer,2,Wed Aug 6 10:54:40 2014 UTC,"Maybe I'm misunderstanding your phrasing, but when was it explained that technomages were using Shadow tech that was passed out by the Drahk?"

babylon5,2cn4sa,JaxRiens,2,Wed Aug 6 10:56:13 2014 UTC,"Lost Tales' first part deals with a freaking Biblical demon.   Though they never actually confirm/deny that that's what it is.  How could you prove such a thing?  What we know from other episodes is that some aliens have the ability to put their consciousness, or at least part of it, in your mind, and these visiting brain bits have some degree of control over what you see and feel and do.  Maybe what the Bible writers called ""demons"" were just tiny chunks of broken-off Vorlon."

Kosh said that the Vorlons didn't take an interest in other worlds, but he was obviously studying Earth, and perhaps along the way he'd studied the Brakiri and figured out what their comet was but kept it to himself.  Having died, he knew what was going on and was able to send a message to Sheridan.  Zoe didn't even know how she'd ended up there, but Kosh told her to deliver a message, knowing she was going and where she was going.  Clearly he knew a lot more about what was going on than any of the rest did."

I enjoyed the storytelling and character development, especially Captain Lochley (""Zoe's dead.""). The problem I have with this episode is one plot point with Rebo & Zooty, specifically when Rebo says they want to give up comedy for politics. This really rings false to my ears every time I hear it. It just feels forced, not at all natural character development for these guys. I wish Gaiman could have handled that part of the story better."
babylon5,2cn4sa,Numlocks,2,Thu Aug 7 09:01:02 2014 UTC,I think it's a massive illusion perpetrated by Reebo and Zooty. I can't explain why yet I just woke up in the middle of the night with that answer after reading the post earlier in the week....
babylon5,2cn4sa,Chrysalii,0,Wed Aug 13 06:50:05 2014 UTC,"I mostly try to pretend that episode never happened because it was just far too silly.   If I had to guess, though, there are references throughout B5 that souls pass onto an afterlife, one of the reasons the Soul Hunters are hated so much for keeping souls in the normal universe. In that episode, they claimed that parts of the station were both there and elsewhere.  There was a guess that it was thousands of light years away, but they could have actually been displaced to overlap with whatever dimension the souls of the dead inhabit. If that happened, it would have had to have been initiated from the ""soul dimension"" because they literally did nothing on the B5 side of things that could have done it beyond making the Brakiri section Brakiri land for an ancient Brakiri ritual. This means that you'd have to go back thousands of years to figure out how the whole thing was initiated.  Anyway, that's a crappy theory, but it's all I've got."
babylon5,2cn4sa,jerslan,1 point,Tue Aug 5 01:28:09 2014 UTC,Is it magic or is it a science that seems like magic?  Maybe there is some psychic link between the Comet and the Brakiri that allows this to occur even light years away from Brakir itself?

With the new movie coming up, it's possible that either him or the WB may drop the price or put the show back on streaming to increase publicity.  Here is an Amazon reviewer's suggest viewing order of the series and additional movies:   Watch the B5 movie ""The Gathering"" The Babylon 5 pilot movie The Gathering was originally broadcast in 1993 a full year ahead of the regular show. Season 1 Season 2 Season 3 Watch Season 4 up to episode ""The illusion of truth"" Watch the B5 movie ""Thirdspace"" Season 4: continue with episodes 9-22 Watch Season 5 through to and including episode ""Objects at Rest"" Watch the B5 movie ""River of Souls"" Watch the B5 movie ""In the Beginning"" This is a prelude set 10 years before Babylon 5. Against the logic of the title, I would strongly recommend seeing it at this stage. Should one see it before Season 1, much of the suspense in the main series would be ruined. Watch the B5 movie ""A Call to Arms"" This movie lays the groundwork for the spin-off TV series ""Crusade"". Watch the B5 movie ""The Lost Tales"" [Thanks to Eric Pregosin for his comments to build on the original list] Watch the B5 movie ""The Legend of the Rangers"" [Thanks to Lisa for her recommendation] Watch Crusade Series Season 5: watch final episode ""Sleeping in light"""

babylon5,2ceck9,Ezreal024,1 point,Sun Aug 3 16:02:38 2014 UTC,"I came to Mass Effect the other way; I had already seen Babylon 5 quite a few times before ME1 ever came out. Playing ME1 (and eventually the entire series), I definitely felt some B5 vibes. But I also felt vibes from about a thousand other sci-fi universes.   Mass Effect and Babylon 5 are my two favorite sci-fi franchises. While I know there are similarities, I wouldn't say that ME is a ""big ripoff"" of Babylon 5, so much as a grand homage to all excellent sci-fi."
babylon5,2ceck9,Ohmstar,1 point,Sun Aug 3 15:05:08 2014 UTC,"Really? Wow, I need to play some Mass Effect. An interactive version of B5 sounds great."
babylon5,2ceck9,warplayer,1 point,Fri Aug 8 19:35:48 2014 UTC,"In some ways I agree but, only in broad strokes, and they took the ideas in different directions. Yes, Reapers ~= Shadows (ancient big bad comes to screw with things), but things like the motivations are completely different.   Yes, the Vorlons are kind of like the Protheans (our jump-gate tech is based (as far as we know) on Vorlon tech, Mass Effect based on what is believed to be Prothean Tech), and the Minbari are kind of like the Asari (oldest of the spacefaring races, somewhat decadent, somewhat aloof, etc.), but again, its broad strokes stuff.  That said, I do love both universes. I just wish they both got the ends they deserved (ME3 ending [not butthurt or anything, just disappointed] and Crusade's butchering by TNT)  Edit: Oh, and B5's big moments, and big speeches are a hell of a lot better than ME. In fact, you'll get one of the very best (as in one of the best in all of television) very soon. Very soon indeed. You'll know it when you hit it."

Other than a vague similarity in that there's Big Inscrutable Bads in all three universes I don't see any similarities at all to be honest.   Where are the similarities between B5, ME and/or Revelation Space other than that they're all Sci-Fi and use some fairly basic story tropes (that you'll find pretty much everywhere anyway)?"
babylon5,2ceck9,CoffeeAndCigars,1 point,Sat Aug 2 08:26:48 2014 UTC,"I meant that ME rips Revelation Space, which rips B5, and maybe something came before that.  I won't get in to it too much within the thread because of spoilers, but I'll hide my paragraph below.    This contains high-level spoilers for Mass Effect, B5, and Revelation Space: You have the ruins of a previously advanced society that vanished which give humans all of their fancy technology, a massive ship/station as the major set piece, factions or races that come together, and then the conflict between the ancient enemy race and current space-faring races where humanity is the savior.  Ultimately they all involve a plague as well.  B5 and RS both have a race called Shadows.   I love B5, and Revelation Space, and ME, but they're pretty inbred.  EDIT: I haven't read RS or played ME in a while so I don't remember the proper names for a lot of things."
babylon5,2ceck9,ludlology,2,Sat Aug 2 10:26:22 2014 UTC,"Well, I don't quite agree there. Rev Space is set in a myriad of different settings, sometimes in the same book. In B5 I honestly see humans being almost peripheral as a species in the major conflicts (obviously not counting the Minbari/Human war, and no I'm not spoiler alerting something that's a big theme already in the pilot).   As for the other things, these are common story tropes. You could almost claim they're ripped from LotR given their generic attributes. In every significant detail, they're all exceedingly dissimilar to each other.   That there are similarities is almost impossible to avoid in large scale sci-fi."

babylon5,2ceck9,demonstar55,1 point,Sat Aug 2 16:58:19 2014 UTC,ME3 was when they decided to reveal that and ME2 was the earliest the writing even reflected the Reapers' first intentions (before the ending got leaked and hijacked). How's this for a spoiler? The Anti-Spirals and the Reapers both have the same reason for wiping out civilization (that it would destroy itself if it got too big/advanced) and only really come back when it passes a threshold of creating synthetic life in regards to the reaper or reaching one million humans on Earth for the Anti-Spirals. The reason I put it under a spoiler is because the very idea that they're (in their minds) trying to 'protect' the people they're killing is a spoiler. I figured everyone in the process of the story or knew them would know what I was talking about. I guess I was wrong.

babylon5,2bv2f9,StarshipSentinel,11,Sun Jul 27 21:37:53 2014 UTC,"From the most official source so far:  Re: JMS at SDCC - B5 News?!? Jan's full update from the SDCC panel!   Quote: Originally Posted by Jan Schroeder Saturday at San Diego Comic-Con (or the day JMS announced that he'll do a B5 movie).  I got there at a good time, not long after the con opened at 10:00 AM. A little surprisingly, the mezzanine didb't really seem too much busier than other days so far except for the food area being busier. I've got pre-written letters to WB and NBC/Universal out on the table and a fair number of folks took those to mail after adding a little demographic info. Five or six were left with me and I dropped them off to be mailed.  The big panel of the day was JMS' of course. First I went to his signing and got a few things signed that will most likely be destined as fund-raisers. I verified with JMS that he wouldn't mind if I handed out buttons and postcards before his panel. A new friend, Lukas, handed out at the door and I wandered the room where people were already staying from the panel before.  JMS started the panel by reviewing his current projects, both 'out house' (not Studio JMS) and in-house and continued with news. We got an introduction to the Sense8 actors. JMS described it as a ""...complex, amazing tapestry of stories."" - Ten Grand: JMS is currently negotiating with a major Studio/Network for a series based on this. - Shadowman feature film: He's two to three weeks from turning in the latest draft. - He couldn't name it, but he's working on a project for Universal concerning Rod Serling and working with Carol Serling, Rod's widow on it. - Again he couldn't say much but he sshowed a title card for a show called ""Two Streets"" that he's just made a deal with Universal for that he'll be working with ""Walking Dead's"" Gail Anne Hurd. - ""Titans"" is the name of the Ffeature film/graphic novel project that was just announced yesterday (see movie thread).  So it's been a really big year for Studio JMS. And due to that, he can now look to doing a feature film ffor B5. JMS recapped that WB owns everything about B5 except the movie rights and even though he holds the film rights, to take a B5 movie to another studio without holding the TV rights wouldn't work. There's one studio in LA that doesn't care about that - Studio JMS - and in 2015 JMS will write the script. He'll give WB the opportunity to step up, but if they don't, Studio JMS will make it in 2016 on thier own with a $1-200,000,000.00 budget.  Fan questios: A fan asked if JMS might crowdfund part of the film so that fans might be involved and JMS said that he resists doing that because it seems to him that SF fans are an exploited group and he doesn't ever want to do that - he'd rather accept investor money.  Asked about the current situation with streaming Babylon 5, JMS said that it's all up to Warner Bros. and geve the #FreeBabylon5 campaign a nice plug, telling of the success in Europe to date and hoping for some movement domestically.  A fan asked if the success of a B5 feature might improve the chances of streaming and even future TV projects and JMS said that it would probably have a significant effect, that a good way to get someone's (WB) attention is to rattle their cage.  Asked if the film would be a reboot or a continuation: ""It would have to be a reboot because it's been twenty-plus years since we started that show and some of the age ranges wouldn't work with some of these characters so we'd need to move a few people around. But what I want to do is use the original cast one way or another but we'd have to move some things around. I'd love to see Bruce as the President of the Earth Alliance; it would be the perfect role for him.""  JMS went on to tell about a story he wanted to do that he wasn't allowed to in the original show where when Londo was injured, he wanted to do a dream sequence where the actors played different characters but the studio thought the audience would get confused.  A fan asked what's being made not that would equal BB5 for being transformative and JMS replied that TV is having a golden age right now with lots of amazing things. being made.  He concluded with his regular homily for the fans to never surrender their dreams, that with persistance and talent and luck, can overcome your circumstances and follow your passionss and succeed.

G'Kar not played by Katsulas? Londo not played by Jurasik? How?! Yet, there's probably no other choice. With JMS at the helm and the right actors I think it could work.   My bigger concern frankly is with it being a movie... How do you scrunch the whole story (I assume a ""reboot"" means the same story roughly) into 2-3 hours? Even it you planned a trilogy that's a REAL tough nut to crack.   At the end of the day though, it's new B5 from JMS and the type of awesome I've got to be massively excited for no matter what!"
babylon5,2bv2f9,fzammetti,3,Sun Jul 27 17:44:55 2014 UTC,"I don't necessarily disagree with anything you said, but JMS himself used the R word so it seems to be where it's headed... what you describe, which I want to see too, I suspect would. only work for existing fans, and if B5 is to continue beyond this then I think new fans have to be hooked and I'm not sure anything but the Shadow War does that... hence my comment that a reboot might be the only way to go.

I want it too!... but could you hook NEW fans with it? I'm not sure I see how.   I'll tell you a personal story... I've been trying to get my 14yr old son to watch B5 for a couple of years... never could... I should him an episode or two (pivotal, Shadow-heavy ones) and they didn't grab him. He couldn't get past the FX and acting in S1 (the one time I got him to watch a few episodes). This summer I finally got him to watch it (cost me making a deal: watch the series and I'll buy you the guitar you want).   And guess what? He's into it now! Midway through S3 and he's liking it a lot.   It's a tough thing to get ""modern"" people into B5 though because objectively, as great as we all know it is as a whole, some of the parts are tough to slog through. I think you kinda NEED the Shadow war as the main driver because what else would match up? Telepath war? Maybe, but lots of backstory needed. Crusade failed unfortunately, as did Legend of the Rangers. I think we kind of NEED the biggest arc, told with modern effects, to get the younger generation hooked. I HATE that the original cast won't be there in their rightful roles, but that can't be helped. I'd rather get people like my son into it like we were when it first aired.   I think that's the better alternative for the property as a whole than some continuing stories that you and I as existing fans might prefer but which will quite possibly doom anything following that.   Just an opinion of course... we'll all be there opening day regardless and that's what counts :)"

babylon5,2b137r,pupeno,8,Fri Jul 18 09:55:46 2014 UTC,Very unlikely. There are civilian vessels that operate regular transport routes and Earthforce vessels are military and I imagine space is limited.
babylon5,2b137r,RaeseneAndu,4,Fri Jul 18 08:12:45 2014 UTC,"Starfleet and Earth Force have two completely different mission parameters.  While Starfleet ships were combat-ready, this was not their sole function and were often used for scientific and diplomatic missions.  Also consider that many Starfleet ships, like Cruisers, were designed for extended tours of duty where its crew would be far, far away from home and everything familiar to them.  Having family on board seemed to make sense for Starfleet.    Earth Force ships, conversely, were designed explicitly for combat, especially when you consider the lessons learned from the Dilgar and Earth-Minbari Wars.  Some exceptions would apply, naturally, and I imagine that those huge exploration ships might have families.  But the Novas, Hyperions, Omegas, and Warlocks don't seem like they had much room for anything else but crew, munitions, and supplies.  I get the impression that Earth Force ships (other than the Exploration ships) don't do years-long tours of duty."
babylon5,2b137r,Solarshield,2,Fri Jul 18 15:32:33 2014 UTC,"It's a pretty nutty idea to put families on vessels, especially if you look at casualty rates on sunk/heavily damaged naval ships in WW1 & WW1 Episode 2, The Riech Strikes Back. Think 80%+ dead... nice way to open some story lines up though. :)  From the B5 series I get the impression EA would monitor and escort Earths' private and civilian ships based on their strategic value. Maybe the odd Presidential trip or VIP would have family but that would have them on a smaller frigate class ship off side a regular fleet."
babylon5,2b137r,Brewjo,1 point,Sat Jul 19 13:16:49 2014 UTC,"Also, consider the fact that Earthforce ships were explicitly less technologically advanced than starfleet ships.  Starfleet ships were using Antimatter power plants even in kirks age(what was that, the 2300s?).  In Babylon 5, Earthforce, Narn, most of the league (with the exception of the vree) use fusion power plants.  Even if earthforce ships WEREN'T purpose built combat vessels, the additional resource use caused by family members could strain the technology beyond its limit"

We know about his feelings for Delenn; and know how strong they are.  He wants to prove himself; he embarrasses himself totally by confessing his feelings during a critical moment...  I see him as a blank slate of a person - in some ways the fact he is fairly innocent in terms of life experiences, means he doesn't have the tools to react appropriately to what is a heartbreaking situation for him.  Look how grizzled someone who has been through a few relationships - knows what to expect - becomes."
babylon5,2ahi8r,wappingite,1 point,Mon Jul 14 12:58:30 2014 UTC,"I agree with this. Lennier began the series as a complete shut-in, raised apart from everything and kicked wide-eyed into a vast world he couldn't understand. Then he spends the next three years serving everyone around him as dutifully as he can... but war changes people and strips away many of the lies we tell ourselves. The stress and responsibility changed him just enough that, for one second, he decided to take what he wanted. Clearly Sheridan was a buffoon who didn't understand or appreciate the greatness of his One True Love and for one single moment, he let pretense drop.  He was a victim of circumstance and poor emotional development that just couldn't cope with everything quite as well as he should have been. I think if he hadn't stormed off on a suicidal honor-tantrum the three of them might have come to terms with it, but he also lacked the emotional faculty to face what he had done and acknowledge that he was flawed."

babylon5,2acedf,ann_no_aku,22,Thu Jul 10 16:34:48 2014 UTC,"I doubt it was anything that complex.   First off you need to realize the Drahk's actions were their own only after the Shadows left. Their actions before that point (meaning up to Season 4) were entirely in line with the Shadows stated goals. They were the servants following the masters and their plans.  The Shadows weren't interested in designing a virus to wipe out weaker races, even though they easily could. They'd rather have those races be conquered by a neighbor. In doing so some Markab might conceivably evolve new technologies and abilities to fight back. Surviving near annihilation and evolving into a stronger race as a whole.  Think of it using Morden's anthill analogy. If you drop poison on the anthill and kill everything, no one is left to start to rebuild. The anthill never gets stronger because no conflict really occurred. It doesn't promote natural evolution, it just creates death.  The point of the Shadows actions wasn't really to wipe out weaker races themselves, but to promote various races towards armed conflict. Which would then end up killing some, but advancing others. While the Shadows chose races to back in order to start the wars, they had no real allegiance to them. They'd have been just as happy with the Centauri losing as with them winning.  (That's why at one point Sheridan is dealing with some ambassadors and points out that the Shadows set them up. Claiming they were protecting them and encouraging them to fight back against other species. They told every race they had their backing so the races would fight amongst themselves and Shadows could just walk away at the right time)  And of course if it was the Drakh virus then why would Crusade happen? Franklin cured the Markab virus (too late of course). Why wouldn't he then have a nearly ready made cure after the Drahk attack? Wouldn't he have noticed the virus wasn't natural when he first encountered it?  (And lets be honest the Markab virus was effectively a metaphor for AIDS and HIV. I mean it's mid 90's television. Philadelphia had just come out 2 years prior in 1993 and JMS was trying to be far more forward thinking on the issues his show addressed. Hence his implied Ivanova/Winters lesbian tryst they couldn't/didn't do more with.)"
babylon5,2acedf,thegenregeek,1 point,Thu Jul 10 16:56:55 2014 UTC,Isn't trying to fight a virus a battle?  Wouldn't dropping a virus bomb on a planet which gave the population a set period of time to discover a cure or die fit into the Shadows' mindset?  The Drakh might have just wanted to wipe out Earth in an act of revenge however the Shadows never would have used the virus in the same manner.
babylon5,2acedf,astalavista114,1 point,Sun Jul 27 19:13:41 2014 UTC,"I refer to Racing the Night - the Shadows did exactly that. When a race rose up against the Shadows, and refused them their base on that world, they left the same nano-plague on that world, with the same 5-year solve it or die situation. But they only released it in response to being denied their based. I suspect that if they hadn't been leaving already, they probably would have done the same to Narn when G'Quan lead the Narns against the Shadows during the Great War."

Their scientists later figure out that kept their genetic pool diverse enough to ward off being susceptible to one single devastating disease.  This feels like it was likely the same answer, or similar as JMS liked to re-use certain ideas and I feel like Season 5 was the more fleshed out version, this season 2 episode felt like it was the same story, just focusing on the ""Hey we're going to find a cure!"" But only succeeding when it was already too late."

Guess we are both at the same point watching the show again :-)   Think this was just a normal virus. It hit more of self delusion and convincing people those kinds of things will never happen to them and that people who get it somehow deserve it.   Someone else mentioned this was a metaphor for HIV and AIDS and that certainly is an easy example.   Side trivia: Isaac Asimov actually died from contracting HIV in heart surgery in the 80s but his family didn't admit it for years because of the sigma his family would have gotten.

Claudia had one fan come up in the question line and he simply asked ""Claudia, can I have a kiss?""  And she gave him quite the french kiss, then told the audience ""That only works once, sorry"".  Peter's voice talent is awesome, and he really does enjoy getting into a character just for fun.  Really wish I could relive that convention somehow.  The organizers did a great job of attracting nearly every actor in B5 to it, but didn't market it well to the fans.  So few people showed up, everyone ended up with a lot of one on one time with nearly every actor.

babylon5,29m767,Emperor_Cartagia,8,Wed Jul 2 02:51:30 2014 UTC,"If that's true, how do long-range or long-term deployments work?  Or deep, multiple day Hyperspace voyages?  Fighter pilots can't possibly just sit in their cockpits for days at a time - there wouldn't be enough air/fuel for that, surely, not to mention the fatigue on the pilots.  It just doesn't add up.  Such a limitation of fighter deployment capability would surely limit the capabilities of entire fleets, if it were the case."
babylon5,29m767,Emperor_Cartagia,13,Wed Jul 2 03:49:48 2014 UTC,"If that's true, how do long-range or long-term deployments work?   Our Capital ships, while lacking full fighter bays, do have docking and refueling spars to periodically cater to Fighter needs on a temporary basis. We maintain refresher crews and fuel stores aboard, there's also tenders with spare parts and repair bays, though they're often kept far behind the lines or remain in hyperspace, which is why there's not seen in battle.   Or deep, multiple day Hyperspace voyages?   It's important to understand that Centauri Fighters are more advanced than almost any other species besides the Minbauri or the Vorlons, their fuel efficiency and autopilot systems are much more advanced than, say, their Human or Narn counterparts. It's often possible for a pilot to set his course from the beginning of his journey and merely remain in the cockpit, knowing the computer will alert him the moment am unexpected threat makes itself known or the craft is about to arrive at its destination.   Such a limitation of fighter deployment capability would surely limit the capabilities of entire fleets, if it were the case.   Thankfully, it isn't. It'd be quite difficult to rule over such an Empire were that the case."

Perhaps it might be a compromise to say that the Primus is probably at least capable of being fitted with extended hangar facilities to house some fighters, although the ones seen up close on the show weren't.  B5 Wars does talk about Centauri carriers as well, doesn't it?  I think it covers a whole variety of ships."
babylon5,29m767,amcintosh,2,Thu Jul 3 03:27:29 2014 UTC,"B5 Wars Primus: 12 Fighters, 8 close in twin particle weapons, 4 Heavy Laser Cannons.  B5 Wars Centauri Balvarin Carrier: 36 fighters.  It may be that fighters are not carried when there is not a mission demand."
babylon5,29m767,mrwoolery,1 point,Thu Jul 3 05:03:55 2014 UTC,"B5 Wars also featured a variant of the Primus, the Secundus, an assault ship variant they AoG designed to reflect the onscreen battle outside of B5 at the end of season 2. Specifically: * There were no fighters * It never fired an lasers * The primary weapons looked like the twin arrays, but packed much more punch.  Thus the Secundus featured Heavy Arrays instead of the Lasers, and assault shuttles rather than fighters.  The Primus commonly carried fighters in the rest of B5 Wars usage.  As mentioned by clawclawbite, there was also the Balvarin carrier. There was also a carrier variant of the Demos (which itself is a larger Vorchan) fitted with a single flight of fighters."

Even if I only go to matinee movies for $7 that's still more than twice the $/hour value of going to see a movie. It's slightly less if you throw in a $20 DVD player, or still better if you get popcorn or go out to eat after a movie... and gas costs.

When building sfnet.viestinta.tv.babylon5 we noticed there's a TV show of the same name and decided to talk about it instead.  But seriously, it was a collection of somewhat fanatic fanboys (and gals) who gathered to dissect every episode after it aired on national broadcaster. As spoilers were dreaded, the group was moderated - a unique thing in Finnish usenet space (this was time before internet forums).  We had internet memes before they became a thing.

babylon5,271nil,wickedsteve,38,Sun Jun 1 18:19:07 2014 UTC,"I think they're viewed as the equivalent of our weapons of mass destruction today: they're seen as indiscriminant and therefore somehow more barbaric than, say, particle beam weapons, which are more controllable and limited in the scope of their damage.  I think primarily it's because they have a much longer-lasting effect... it seems like beam weapons are the weapon of choice in the B5 universe and it's not unreasonable to assume that those types of weapons, while massively destructive at the time, don't cause lingering effects like radiation and such.    Mass drivers though do what any asteroid collision does: throws debris into the air, blotting out the sun, killing vegetation, right up the food chain, and changing the climate of a planet for decades to come.  We do in fact see some of those effects in later episodes as Narn struggles to rebuild (I even kind of remember it being talked about, though I can't pinpoint an episode).  I think that's really the key point and why they're deemed illegal in the B5 universe.  They don't just destroy a bunch of stuff in a relatively localized area over a short period of time... they destroy the ecosystem of entire planets over a long period of time.  If you'll pardon a weird expression, that's not a nice way to fight a war :)  Even the Shadow/Vorlon planet-killers could be said to be more ""humane"" in that they do more damage of course, but they limit suffering by being immediate.  Mass drivers, not so much."

babylon5,271nil,Pawn_in_game_of_life,9,Mon Aug 11 21:40:09 2014 UTC,I would suppose it's the B5 equivalent of carpet bombing. It's a broad attack on civilian targets instead of pinpointing military installations.
babylon5,271nil,Game-On,5,Sun Jun 1 18:35:47 2014 UTC,It's more a case of what they were using the mass drivers for. In this case it was to accelerate asteroids to bombard Narn from space.
babylon5,271nil,nativefloridian,-2,Sun Jun 1 18:33:36 2014 UTC,"Still doesn't make sense. They should have made bombardment by any means illegal. Just seems like a writing goof or something. I was hoping for a real explanation. JMS has thought out so much of the show so well, I was hoping he had this covered. Maybe he just didn't know what mass drivers were and thought they sounded scary."
babylon5,271nil,mistervanilla,5,Sun Jun 1 18:40:36 2014 UTC,They should have made bombardment by any means illegal.   They probably did. Mass drivers are probably just the most common/cheapest method of orbital bombardment in the B5 universe.
babylon5,271nil,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jun 1 18:48:24 2014 UTC,I guess I will just chalk it up as Londo paraphrasing.
babylon5,271nil,reddog323,7,Sun Jun 1 19:09:51 2014 UTC,"Actually, it could be quite a common linguistic device, such as the totum pro parte. Wherein the act of 'using mass drivers to propel asteroids towards a planet with the aim of causing mass destruction' has become shortened to 'using mass drivers'. Even though there would be other uses for such technology in the B5 universe, it doesn't seem hard to imagine that slinging asteroids onto planets would capture the most notoriety and cause it to become wholly associated with that in the public (non-technical) eye, leading to this phrase."
babylon5,271nil,Xenophon13,2,Mon Jun 2 00:57:55 2014 UTC,"Totum pro parte:       Totum pro parte is Latin for ""the whole for a part""; it refers to a kind of synecdoche. When used in a context of language it means that something is named after something of which it is only a part (or only a limited characteristic, in itself not necessarily representative for the whole). A pars pro toto (in which a part is used to describe the whole) is the opposite of a totum pro parte.

Minbari: A pilot assigned to the Black Star, you're assigned to search out and destroy the last remaining sensor relays in the rings of Saturn, including the capture of two, and taking them back to the Black Star.  First Act: The Earth-Minbari War, Mission Two.  Human: The Black Star is destroyed, but a wing of her fighter escort has survived. The radiation of the battle is interfering with your targeting systems, but the Minbari seem similarly hampered, you are clear, weapons hot, engage!  Minbari: Distracted and delayed by your capture of the human sensor bouys, you witness the destruction of the Black Star, you're ordered to avoid the radiation field where the rest of your crewmates are all presumed dead, and join up with the Valens Song which is pushing past the Mars defense perimeter. Arriving towards the end of the battle, you hunt down and destroy the last wave of Starfuries.  First Act: The Earth-Minbari War, Mission 3.  Human: The Battle of the Line. All the cards are on the table, fighting has already broken out in extra-lunar orbit, you're closing on the Minbari lines the wings ahead disintegrating before your eyes, your wingman is hit, you take your first shots, they're wildly off as the Minbari stealth tech is at full effectiveness here, the Minbari are closing in on you, you're hit, your stabilizers are gone.. and then they stop. The Comms light up, the Minbari have surrendered.. You're adrift as you watch another of your friends captured by a mammoth Minbari Cruiser..  Minbari: Valens Song is a part of the Vanguard, assaulting the Lunar defensive grid. With your stealth tech and targeting sensors fully operational, the Starfuries are nearly helpless before you, wave after wave are annihilated almost as soon as they close within range.. Valens Song moves into position to directly target the Earthforce Lunar Base.. and stops. You are ordered to return to base, stand down, we surrender..  Act Two would be the Narn-Centauri Conflict of Season One, piloting light frigates, larger than fighters, less than cruisers.  Act Three would be the beginnings of the Shadow War, one mission each in fighters, frigates, and a destroyer.  Act Four would be the Shadow War proper, pick your ship of the line, Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, Earthforce AWOLs, Narn, Minbari, White Star, or a smattering of Non-Aligned Worlds vessels, Drazi, Pach-Marah, etc.. or a Shadow ship.  Act Five would be the final confrontation, the world killers as environmental hazards, every ship available, including Vorlon."

babylon5,26jy84,martianinahumansbody,10,Mon May 26 21:49:00 2014 UTC,"He did explain what he would have done. Google Babylon Prime.  Yes The One line was him covering his ass after the series rethink around the end of season one. No, Sinclair wouldn't have done what Sheridian ended up doing, at least not in Babylon 5 as a series nor in regards to Earth. It would have been similar though, with regards to the Shadows."
babylon5,26jy84,thegenregeek,3,Mon May 26 23:47:29 2014 UTC,Wow. Reading up on this and I am actually surprised how different a direction it would have gone. I kind of feel we ended up with a better version. Feel like his 5 year plan wasn't as solidified as he makes it sound.
babylon5,26jy84,thegenregeek,8,Tue May 27 03:43:59 2014 UTC,"I would argue his 5 year plan was solidified (B5), as was his second 5 year plan (B Prime).  Him compressing things is not him having a incomplete vision or having a less sound strategy. If anything it was a smart move to realize he was probably being overly ambitious in the first place. (Many writers tend to over think their stories, that's why we have editors)  What I suspect happened was that, when Michael O'hare left and JMS was dealing with network interference (like them wanting to add Lt Keffer), he realized getting a single show done was hard enough. Odds were good either the network would screw with his original first series plan and/or he wouldn't get the second show at all. So he just condensed the separate plans into a single series. Effectively cutting each 5 year period down to 2.5 and merging them together as his new 5 year plan. Then he used his ""trapdoors"", which he's always had planned anyways, to fix inconsistencies to explain it away. (The biggest trapdoor being the Babylon Squared storyline and what happened with B4).  At most the 5 year plan got a little weakened near the end of Season 1. But by (start of) Season 2 he knew exactly what his new (condensed) 5 year plan would be.  I don't believe after that point there was any doubt about where he was going for the series, at least in the broad strokes. Like wise I don't believe he claimed to have every single thing planned, just that he had a story with a clearly defined beginning, middle and end."
babylon5,26jy84,BeachSC,4,Tue May 27 04:03:00 2014 UTC,"In Parliament of Dreams, Catherine mentions the Minbari ceremony that was shown also doubles as a marriage ceremony. She then adds ""... Was there a serious exchange of looks?"" (Of which we were shown, between Sinclair and Delenn) Sinclair says something like, ""why yes."" Catherine then says ""Hm. Someone got married at that ceremony."" I believe this was the groundwork for a later real relationship between Sinclair and Delenn, like Sheridan. Of course at some point it would come out. She would be like, surprise!! We're already married!! What better way to keep an eye on him tho..."

Sinclair/Valen lead them 1000 years ago, Delenn leads them during the present era of the show, and Ivanova will lead them in twenty years, after the finale.

That said, it was a lot of fun back when I played it and as ship-combat systems go, it wasn't nearly as dense as Star Fleet Battles.  If you can still find some rulebooks (second edition, skip first ed, trust me) and some people to play it with (preferably three others so you can hit the major races, but the minimum is really just one friend) and knock out a weekend.  The system isn't very complicated and by the second battle you won't even need the rulebook anymore.  The system was so popular at one point that there were fan groups making ships from just about every IP in it, the most robust of which was the Star Wars conversion guys.  I even think their yahoo group is still open, if inactive.  Edit:  /u/arquebus_x just offered a url to the B5W Vault which seems to have many of the ship sheets and sourcebooks available.

Personally, I wouldn't go over three/four ships per side, and every 24 fighters is as much work as a ship, so they count.  The classic Centauri Primus Battle Cruiser vs Narn G'(something-or-other) Heavy cruiser plus fighters works really well as an introductory game."

I would assume it's power source is beyond and more volatile than q40, as they opted not to destroy the gate."
babylon5,25chht,Saintarium,2,Mon May 12 13:18:55 2014 UTC,To be fair it was the Vorlons of eons past.... i'm not sure how stagnate they became but its fair to guess they were more powerful in the last shadow war than they were when they first opened the 3rd space gate.
babylon5,25chht,kalenvor,2,Mon May 12 16:55:48 2014 UTC,Well the implications of the Vorlons getting so brutally driven back that they NEVER tried to go back there would certainly suggest that they felt the beings were more powerful.

B5 is there because the Great Machine is there. That no one (living) knew the Great Machine is there is sort of beside the point. The Minbari insisted it had to be there (for reasons you will find out later, IIRC), so that's where it was.  Yes, it is weird to put the station there without thorough scans of the planet. But (IIRC) the initial scans showed a dead planet, so there wasn't much cause for alarm. And it was in the right part of space, so that's a bonus. And, most importantly, a species that nearly wiped out the human race (the Minbari) wanted it there in order to avoid another war. So there you go."
babylon5,251g3w,mpierre,5,Thu May 8 14:51:45 2014 UTC,"Plus, if the machine was working properly, it could probably shield itself from scans somehow. When it was scanned, it was a bit out of sorts."

It's absurd and would never, ever happen.    The show goes over multiple factors that are in play in the B5 universe:  1) The Minbari wanted it there. Important because the project wouldn't work without them. Earth made major concession (in it's eyes) to keep the Minbari happy. Remember what Garabaldi found out about Col Ben Zayn in the season 1 episode ""Eyes""? There was a long list of very notable people who the Minbari kept crossing off, until they got to Sinclair. Earth ended up passing over far more important people until Sinclair.  2) The planet was explored, in so far as a general survey found nothing of note.  The planet was stable enough and no signs of life were detected. There were no other reasons Earth could think of to investigate further.  3) B5 was the 5th station in a line of stations that kept running into issues that nearly doomed the entire project. Political reasons could easily have caused project planners to disregard matters for the sake of getting it done. You find more about what that means in season 3, the episode Grey 17 is Missing. But there are references through out the series.  4) Babylon 5 is not the only human based post in space. Though it is the most remote. There are other colonies like Proxima 3 and Orion 7. B5 was the only human outpost outside of Earth controlled space (ignoring the Minbari embassy and any other embassy). It was also a rather controversial outpost, with many political conflicts internal and external to the Earth Alliance. As mentioned in the ISN episode in Season 2 the ""vegas"" odds for its survival low. Given this there was a faction on earth that didn't really care if it made it and presumably restricted funding for non station specific matters (like survey projects). In season 4 you'll see another ISN episode that offers a perspective on this.  5) The Great Machine is very powerful, more so than just vaporizing a ship or two in Voices in the Wilderness. It is entirely possible that it masked it's appearance during the initial scans, with it's structures only apparent due to the events in Voices in the Wilderness 1 & 2, where it's caretaker was weakened. You will find out how powerful (and important) in later seasons."
babylon5,251g3w,DarrenGrey,8,Thu May 8 16:11:41 2014 UTC,The down vote is probably just the weird math reddit uses to average stuff...  I think it all just relies on planets in the Babylon 5 universe just not really being that lively. The reason the stuff they found there is a huge deal is because its pretty much inconceivable at that point that there could be things like that on a random uninhabited planet. They gave it a once over and didn't find anything. That's probably all the survey required to build an orbiting station over an uninhabited planet that they didn't plan on ever landing on anyway. Its like if they want to build an airbase now they probably don't scan down to the mantle to see if there's crab people or something.
babylon5,251g3w,unabsolute,2,Thu May 8 15:30:09 2014 UTC,"but conflicted space, why do it in orbit it of an unexplored planet.    There you go!  If it's unexplored and uninhabited and, lifeless (like the planet is), you can't easily colonize it and as such, no one really wants it.  But it's still in the middle of everything, so it's a rare strategic spot which NO ONE wants.  It's like an empty desert in the middle of 5 big countries. No one really wants the desert, at least, not any special places in it.  All they want, is to have control over territory.  However, in B5, you can use gates and jump-gate generating ships to jump anywhere, so just controlling a section of space for the fun of it is costly and almost useless.  No one would really profit from controlling this start system one way or another.  This is why it was suitable for placing something like Babylon 5 which doesn't require a planet with plants to survive."
babylon5,251g3w,wymarc10,5,Thu May 8 19:18:36 2014 UTC,"I'd always assumed that the Varn (controller of the Great Machine) just made sure nobody could find him, and rigged their scanners to find nothing.  But when he got so old his body was finally failing, he couldn't do it anymore."
babylon5,251g3w,Collateral_Dmg,3,Thu May 8 18:24:28 2014 UTC,I think the central location to the major powers and existing jump gate might have also influenced the location to the point where doing a thorough study of what appeared to be a dead uninhabitable planet seemed unimportant.
babylon5,251g3w,agamemnon42,3,Thu May 8 15:37:27 2014 UTC,"Trekkie, huh? How about relating it to Trek's Neutral Zone then? I'm sure others will correct me if I'm wrong, but that seems a decent enough analogy.   But IIRC the intro (I even forget which seasons!) state that it's located in neutral territory.  And pretty centralized among the different major alien empires.  Why does not having a deep scan of the planet bother you so much? Isn't a surface scan good enough? Assume that full, deep scans take time, there are shit-loads of plantes in the galaxy, and they needed to establish a neutral location in a neutral territory before some a-hole comes in and claims mining rights, should they take the time to see if maybe there is some quantity of rare ore that might leak out and cause them to lose the site to miners?  They needed to establish that it was uninhabited and truly neutral. They did that. You expecting a ""deep scan"" is about the equivalent of expecting a full evaluation of the Marianas Trench before we can sail on the ocean. They scanned for life and that was all they needed at the time.  I think you're expecting the B5 universe to have the same magical push-button scanning technology of Star Trek.   I'm not trying to be rude and I hope this isn't coming off that way, I'm in a rush to type this out because I have to go out for a bit ;)  But:   my feelings towards the centauri and narn keep flipping   That's a big part of the intentional fun!! You're supposed to flip-flop, they aren't cut and dried one-note species like the famous Trek aliens. They aren't all ""greedy"" like Ferengi, etc.   I'll try to come back to type more later.

babylon5,251g3w,finchiTFB,1 point,Thu May 8 17:46:28 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. In saying I'm a semi - Trekkie, I essentially meant I have watched through all of the episodes of all series, I by no means claim to be able to argue the finer points, and your point about the so called neutral zone is a valid one.    I suppose the reason it bothers me so much about the deep scan is that I do geophysical mineral exploration for a living, and we have the ability now to be able to scan areas of the earths surface down down 10s of kilometers through different techniques (granted some of those are from solar flares interacting with the earth's magnetic field) but I don't see why we couldn't simulate the same scenario 200 years in the future, even if the planet doesn't have a natural magnetic field.  I could go on about the fact that every contingency plan should have been thought of , hence why deep scans of the planet should have been done considering B1-B4 were all destroyed, but I get the feeling I should just put up and shut up until I have watched the whole series, and then see if my points are still relevant."

babylon5,251g3w,fzammetti,1 point,Thu May 8 22:31:43 2014 UTC,"It might be that there was a thorough survey and it didn't show up any of the underground stuff. The Great Machine is said to be very deep under the surface, and could be hiding itself well from even probing surveys. If you look at a planet and see nothing but rock you're not likely to wonder if there is ancient technology kilometres below the surface.  As for why the location is chosen, I don't think it's ever said, and certainly as presented in the series it does seem like rather the coincidence that B5 happens to orbit such an important site. But then there could be other historical forces at work... Both the Minbari and the Vorlons have a hand in ensuring Fate goes the right way."

babylon5,251g3w,jollyreaper2112,1 point,Thu May 8 18:32:57 2014 UTC,"1 the literal explanation. It's a good transport hub location, a midway between a lot of worlds. The planet seemed fairly innocuous, there are allot of fairly innocuous worlds in B5. Also if the machine is powerful enough then if it did not want to be seen as attractive to investigation then it could project readings that made that clear.  2  the political explanation. The Vorlons are mysterious fuckers. Sometimes they ask directly but quite slot of the the they get the minbari do of their work for them. ""Understanding is not required only obedience"" as lener would put it.  3 nothing is a coincidence.  B5 as I'm sure you have heard by now is super planned out. It does have a function and a more general use. It's not super important but it will come up later."

babylon5,24z2il,dbutlerjr,4,Mon May 12 13:19:08 2014 UTC,"What kind of theory of explanation are you looking for, exactly? People die.  Andreas Katsulas smoked ""with a passion"" and died of lung cancer.  Richard Biggs died of Aortic Dissection.  Others died of complications from drug abuse and vehicular accidents.  It's a sad truth but some people go early, some don't. In this case, it's many members of our beloved cast who have left us early.  Sorry mate :("
babylon5,24z2il,I_suck_at_mostthings,1 point,Wed May 7 20:24:24 2014 UTC,"It could be because less of the B5 actors were big celebrities. They haven't had the success of veterans of other shows, and so more easily fall into the traps of drugs, alcoholism and mental health issues.  That's silly conjecture though. Simple fact is you will get statistical anomalies between shows.  Could also be related to the age of the actors involved? Not sure if B5 had an older cast or not."
babylon5,24z2il,DarrenGrey,2,Thu May 8 15:54:34 2014 UTC,"I was thinking things along both those lines.  The anomaly is pretty striking though, when you consider even against the much older cast of the original series.  Yes, the B5 cast was more diverse age-wise than ST:TNG and DS9's casts, I suppose... then again, the DS9 cast didn't exactly hit big celebrity status either...    It's just... peculiar.  And very sad."

babylon5,243srh,DarrenGrey,5,Sun Apr 27 19:53:46 2014 UTC,"Yup, same here. Other shows are just so poor in comparison. I tried watching BSG recently - the miniseries was great, and there were a few good moments, but by mid series 2 it was obvious they were making it up as they went along."
babylon5,243srh,Stile4aly,5,Mon Apr 28 00:25:11 2014 UTC,"The problem with BSG seasons 2 and 3 is that it seems they knew how they wanted to start the season and how they wanted to end the season, but then used the middle to simply move pieces into place rather than making those stories as compelling as possible.  Season 2 mitigated this with the Pegasus 3 parter, but then dropped the ball with Black Market.  Season 3 has it worse with Hero and The Woman King bookending a mediocre mid-season plot in the Eye of Jupiter.  I do think they solved this in season 4 which is compelling throughout.  I know the ending annoys a lot of people, but everything leading up to the last 10 minutes is well thought out and well executed."
babylon5,243srh,fantasyham,2,Mon Apr 28 01:15:19 2014 UTC,"I was thinking of watching Falling Skies and then I read an article where the show runners were talking about the new season and they mention something along the lines of ""Well, we had him on the alien ship and then we had no idea where to go from there.""  Glad I didn't waste my time with that show.  If you're going to do a show like that where you know there's going to be a definite end (i.e. humans kicking aliens off Earth), then you need to have a decent plan on how to get there."
babylon5,243srh,wickedsteve,1 point,Mon Apr 28 03:13:03 2014 UTC,I think the miniseries was the best part of BSG. It had so much potential and then the writers painted themselves into a corner trying to wing it. I was expecting way too much.
babylon5,243srh,fantasyham,2,Mon Apr 28 01:25:46 2014 UTC,Yes! Yes! Yes!  It's because of B5 that I couldn't get into shows like Lost and BSG.  After the first season you can tell they have no idea what they're doing and I don't feel like giving shows like that my time.
babylon5,243srh,fzammetti,4,Mon Apr 28 03:10:33 2014 UTC,"The only other show that's given me even remotely the same level of satisfaction as B5 is Stargate SG-1.

I'd say it ""holds up"" well to B5, though not for the same reasons."

babylon5,243srh,rayford,2,Mon Apr 28 06:10:20 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but I rather like how the Shadow War ended. It seemed like a sort of natural conclusion. The younger races caught in between two giants, being forced to rally together and throw all their cards on the table. Sure, it could have lasted a few more episodes. So could the fight for earth.   I dunno. Maybe I need to go back and watch the series again. It's been almost a year since I did a full re-watch, after all. :P"
babylon5,243srh,tdasnowman,1 point,Mon Apr 28 14:01:19 2014 UTC,"Oh I liked how the war ended overall, it just ended up being rushed a bit.

babylon5,243srh,LtDarien,1 point,Mon Apr 28 14:53:26 2014 UTC,"Well I figure the Shadow War would have probably ended about two-thirds to three-fourths of the way through season four, with it ending with the beginnings of the fallout from B5's succession (perhaps with Sheridan's capture? - that would kinda tie-in with the ending of season 3), Season 5 would be dealing with Earth, and the beginnings of the Interstellar Alliance, with Mars and the Telepath war mixed in to both seasons 4 and 5."

babylon5,23w4iw,FKRMunkiBoi,2,Fri Apr 25 16:59:05 2014 UTC,"You have to buy the book ;-)  Put simply, she wanted to be in only 18 of the 22 episodes, but still be paid for the 22, meaning a pay increase.  However, the lower budget (because of the switch to TNT) meant lower pay from everyone.  Worse, when you ask an actor to lower their salary, they put a disclosure that ALL of the other actors need to agree to it, so that it's not a personal thing.  So, if they agreed to give a pay increase to Claudia Christian, it would have cancelled the signature of the other actors."
babylon5,23w4iw,FrodoFraggins,1 point,Fri Apr 25 17:28:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks for replying. I hate to say it, but I feel very burned out on buying the B5 books. I'm glad they are made available, but I'm still severely pissed about my B5 at Twenty book. It was billed as the best thing to B5 in HD that we'd ever get, but the printing process was so cheap and shitty that the photos are very dark and murky and not anything approaching the ""closest thing to B5 in HD"" that we were promised. As a diorama / model builder, this was such a wasted opportunity I just couldn't bring myself to complain to them since they at least put it out there in the first place. So instead, I just don't shop there anymore due to the heartache.   Back to the topic, it's amazing everyone else agreed to the pay decreases and we didn't lose more than just CC."

babylon5,23w4iw,FKRMunkiBoi,0,Fri Apr 25 20:31:30 2014 UTC,"My guess is that they all had fears that leaving would brand them as Divas... and most of them LOVED B5...   Really? I can't picture most agents going along with that, nor the union. I was never happy with CC's decision to leave but I never thought her to be a diva for it. I still haven't gotten around to it, but I hear on the new Blu Ray commentary for one of her 80's movies (Maniac Cop 2?) The director or someone said she was unpleasant to work with.  A quick IMDB search found this:    Here's an excerpt from her book Babylon Confidential  After booking a movie of the week for the USA Network: ""Then we learned that TNT and Warner Brothers had come through with the money for a fifth season. That’s when the problems started. I couldn’t sign up for twenty-two episodes because I needed the first few episodes off to do the Movie of the Week. Joe promised that he would write me out for those episodes. He’d done the same thing for some of the other cast members. I was happy with that, but the cable network wasn’t prepared to take me on if I was double booked, because it would affect their ability to get insurance. I pressed my manager, because I was committed to continuing with the show, and he got USA to agree that everything would be okay if I got a guarantee in writing from Babylonian Productions stating that I would be released for those episodes that would be shot while A Wing and a Prayer was shooting. Joe told me that he was unable to do that. If he renegotiated in writing for me then it would open the door for the rest of the cast to do the same, and that would affect the budget and scheduling and jeopardize the entire fifth season. TNT wanted all the lead actors, which included me, committed to all twenty-two episodes. They set a deadline for me to sign the contract. I was caught between a rock and a hard place and hoped that Joe and the producers could find some way to work around it. Joe and the key cast members attended a sci-fi convention in the UK, and some of the studio guys were there, too. They plied us with wine and good scotch, and we went to bed at the hotel completely bombed. At 3 a.m. someone knocked on my door. It was a producer with a contract in hand. He started blabbering, pressuring me to sign. I found out later that they tried the same thing on some other cast members who still hadn’t signed on for the new season. I rang my manager in L.A. to ask him for advice. “Claudia, no beep way are you signing anything at 3 a.m. in a foreign country when I haven’t even seen the contract. I’ve been asking these guys to fax me something all week, and they haven’t sent me a goddamn thing!” I packed my bags and left the UK. The deadline passed, and by the time I got home there was a fax waiting for me telling me that I was fired from the show. My manager contacted them to see if we could salvage the situation. The producer’s reply was that we were a “a day late and a dollar short.”""    On the same message board for CC, I found this:   Although everyone in the cast covered his ass at the time, and either towed the company line, or else refused to comment, you can lay the blame squarely on JMS for Claudia Christian's sudden departure. Or at least a very big part of it. Despite what was 'leaked' at the time, she never asked for more money, more perks, or anything else of the kind. Nor was she a diva on set. She had been booked for a film role when they didn't even know that B5 was coming back or not (remember everyone, even JMS, thought season 4 was going to be the end), and when season 5 did turn out to unexpectedly get the green light, JMS out and out refused to write around her for the two weeks that would have crossed into the B5 filming schedule (which would have caused a couple of episodes to be Ivanova free, though they still could have added insert scenes during later shoots if required) which is all that she requested, and which was something that he had done for other actors in past seasons, and which is usually seen as a routine courtesy for cast in long running ensemble shows anyway. But for some reason he just outright refused and wouldn't even really discuss the matter. Instead he gave her an altamatum, basically demanding that she quit the film that she had already agreed to do, or else he'd recast. She didn't back down, he recast and introduced the Lochley character instead, and the rest is history. The old story of an irresistible force meeting an immovable object, and no one wins. Sadly, I'm not even sure the film ended up happening, as I believe funding fell through...though I may be mistaken on that bit. It has been a few years, after all. :p  Back in the day when I was helping run sci-fi conventions I got to get to hang out with quite a few former B5 actors, and I heard basically the same story not just from Claudia Christian herself, but also from Jerry Doyle (who is not someone I'd ever believe 100% even if he told me water was wet and the sky was blue, as he's a born 'storyteller'), the late great Andreas Katsulas (along with Dwight Schultz, one of the nicest 'stars' I've ever met), and Bruce Boxleitner (also a very nice guy actually).  In fact Boxleitner in particular at the time readily admitted that he greatly regretted not sticking up for her at the time, and digging in deeper as to what exactly was going on, as he and Claudia were good friends, and he was quite vocal when she left, blaming her, which split up their friendship for a time. According to Boxleitner, he was lied to, never given the full story, and told that she quit when she hadn't, and took it at the time as an insult against the show, taking on face value what he had been told without digging any deeper. He said by the time he found out what really happened it was all far too late. He did make good with Claudia Christian again eventually, and it's all water under the bridge again now (or at least it was by 2000 or so when I met him). Ask Boxleitner if you see him at a con, he'll be quite frank about the whole thing. Or at least he was happy to be back at the time anyhow.    Does JMS's story in the book greatly differ from this? I can completely see the ""immovable object meeting an unstoppable force"" in regards to these two."
babylon5,23w4iw,SIR_MASTER_THE_GREAT,1 point,Fri Apr 25 20:45:00 2014 UTC,"Well, JMS seems to admit that there was a lot of confusion, so it's not a complete contradiction.  The 18 episodes fits with this, but it is implied in the book that CC still wanted to be paid for those missing 4.  They gave her until midnight to sign and she didn't. That's why they said she quit.   It's a very messy situation I guess, but we hadn't heard JMS's side yet."
babylon5,23tqv4,fitzgda,21,Thu Apr 24 02:31:37 2014 UTC,"Okay, hear me out on this. If you're looking for a single episode to give them a hook, you don't even need to think about the big episodes.  The episode to do this with is:  And Now For A Word  The reason for this is that the episode reveals nothing huge, yet provides lots of adequate information about the plot  It fills you in on the following, to name a few:  -The Narns and Centauri hating each other, and being at war, and the impact the war is having on everyone else, including Babylon 5  -The Vorlons are more advanced, and really mysterious, and want to be left alone for the most part.  -The typical Earth news watcher is severely misinformed  -Earth and Minbar have a rough history.  -Public support for the Babylon project is falling in numbers.  The episode is about a news team spending a day or two aboard Babylon 5 and trying to interview as many people of significance as possible. It is a great display of the show's humor, as well as its depth. Great episode to either start someone with, or to show them as a sample before they even begin season 1. (This way, they know the show goes somewhere eventually and get tough it out through the first season)"
babylon5,23tqv4,I_suck_at_mostthings,5,Thu Apr 24 05:56:26 2014 UTC,"Mentioned this before, but the episode that has worked for me a few times is Passing through Gethsemane.  It is a season 3 episode, but it doesn't impact the arc, and doesn't do much to spoil anything before it. It deals with larger questions in a characteristically B5 way and serves as a good example of the ""tone"" of the show and what it can be.   Worked with a scifi fan who was skeptical as well as my decidedly non-scifi fan wife, who watched the entire series with me afterwards."
babylon5,23tqv4,TZath,3,Thu Apr 24 14:48:03 2014 UTC,"Good suggestion! This is a great episode just in its prompt: ""If a man were to forget all of the evil things he has done and start anew, is he the same man or a different man? Is he deserving of redemption/forgiveness? Do our actions define us or our pasts?""  Religion plays a big theme in this episode but it's a great episode for anyone. The conflict within the episode is very universal."
babylon5,23tqv4,I_suck_at_mostthings,3,Thu Apr 24 15:25:35 2014 UTC,"I'd show them In the Beginning first. It is somewhat self-contained, and while it does spoiler some parts of the first season, it is not too bad in that regard. Also, it is awesome."

babylon5,23tqv4,DarrenGrey,2,Thu Apr 24 18:23:33 2014 UTC,"You might consider ""Midnight on the Firing Line,"" ""Born to the Purple,"" and then ""Signs and Portents.""  That sets up Narn aggression, Londo's desperation, and even though we become sympathetic with Londo and his situation, and we see his frustration, and the Shadows get him out of an ugly spot, we're still left with an uneasy feeling.  There are some people you shouldn't take favors from."
babylon5,23tqv4,I_suck_at_mostthings,2,Thu Apr 24 20:52:10 2014 UTC,"Just start them from episode 1. If they don't like it then tough. No point ruining the plot for them just to try and get them in. You can't appreciate the likes of War Without End unless you've seen the full build-up over many episodes.  I got some friends hooked by just giving them the season 1 boxset. It wasn't until early season 2 that they started to lag on it, and I had to convince them it was worth pushing through."

The quality of those episodes is pretty terrible, and only the ""Bell-hop Uniform"" episodes (8-13 of the TNT run) represent what JMS actually wanted to do. Those episodes are of similar quality to the early episodes of Season 1 of B5 - not plot heavy (although no doubt they would have been later [much like Midnight on the Firing Line was]), but solid, and setting up where things are initially pointing.   Then TNT started meddling to kill it off, and we got the other episodes. They aren't bad bad (although War Zone is terrible), but they are no-where near the quality of the rest of the B5 - think more Legend of the Rangers than B5 Season 1)"

babylon5,23gdzw,co_fragment,3,Sat Apr 19 19:10:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah, narrowing down to ten was difficult"
babylon5,23gdzw,I_suck_at_mostthings,10,Sat Apr 19 20:19:49 2014 UTC,"My favorite is the G'Kar scene about moments of revelations and moments of transition ""the future is always born in pain"""
babylon5,23gdzw,I_suck_at_mostthings,6,Sat Apr 19 20:36:32 2014 UTC,"The Sigma 957 Walkers.  That moment was my first ""Oh, wow. This show is perfect for me"" moment. I'm glad that's first on the list.  If I had made the list, I would have replaced ""The First Appearance of the Shadows"" with G'Kar's declaration of war in The Coming of Shadows, s2e9. Mainly because, while the first Shadow appearance is so monumental, the season 1 style execution of it didn't quite to it justice in my opinion. G'Kar seems a Bloodthirsty Wrathcase, basically up until war finally, officially breaks out between the Narns and the Centauri, and you can see the regret when he declares ""We are at war"". The complete about-face in his character is one of the most significant moments for me.  ""The Fall of Night"" - This goes without saying.  Delenn's arrival was the one I KNEW would be on the list when I read the title.  Vir's wave was one of the best payoffs ever.  I might have replaced the humans becoming ""second ones"" with the demolition of Babylon 5 in Sleeping in Light. That scene hit me in the feels overwhelmingly.  Great list!"
babylon5,23gdzw,mexter,4,Sun Apr 20 00:03:45 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! While I was making the list I was trying to differentiate between favourite moments and 'cool' ones. I'd have loved to include G'kar's 'resistance' speech from Long, Twilight Struggle' - while it's a monumental performance by Andreas Katsulas and awesome writing by JMS - it's not quite 'cool' by my (admittedly self-imposed) rule for the list, so sadly it had to go."
babylon5,23gdzw,I_suck_at_mostthings,3,Sat Apr 19 21:41:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I figured ""cool"" didn't necessarily mean ""most significant"" or ""most intense/memorable""  G'Kar's resistance/freedom speech from TLTS is such a heavy moment! In addition, The destruction of Narn while Londo looks on…"
babylon5,23gdzw,DarrenGrey,2,Sat Apr 19 22:05:59 2014 UTC,I loved the wave. I just wish they hadn't included the flashback.  It should have just been a reward for faithful viewers.
babylon5,23gdzw,thegenregeek,3,Sat Apr 19 22:26:47 2014 UTC,I feel the same way about that scene. I think that was a casualty of being a 90s series when they had to assume many watchers had not been watching since the beginning or at least didn't pay that close attention.
babylon5,23gdzw,LocutusOfBorges,1 point,Sun Apr 20 01:32:22 2014 UTC,In general Babylon 5 steered clear of that flashback style. It's pretty much endemic in so many movies and programs now. Producers seem obsessed with the idea that us viewers have no attention span and need constant reminders of what's going on and why.
babylon5,23gdzw,replayer,8,Sun Apr 20 01:46:53 2014 UTC,I'm a little dissapointed Sheridan's attack on Z'ha'dum isn't here. I mean the weight of that scene is so damn intense as Anna is stalking John and he's just buying time to sacrifice himself for the cause. All the while Babylon 5 is facing an immediate all out attack they have zero chance of winning.  I remember watching that having a near panic attack.
babylon5,23gdzw,mexter,2,Mon Apr 21 03:29:41 2014 UTC,"I already had one 'John Sheridan jumps off a high thing to avoid an explosion' in my list, I couldn't put two! I love that scene though, it almost made it in the ten."
babylon5,23gdzw,dbutlerjr,4,Sat Apr 19 22:02:44 2014 UTC,"Seconded. That crescendo of tension towards the end of that scene was amazing.   Easily the best scene in the series, I'd say. The tone completely knocked it out of the park."

babylon5,23cmfa,bulgaringon,11,Fri Apr 18 12:16:17 2014 UTC,"I think your analogy might be more accurate, but less visceral. Sheridan was making an appeal to emotion (at least on the part of the viewers) more than intellect.   I think this might be an example of how drama differs from reality: in a real-world situation, the Cold War analogy might be more persuasive, but in a drama it's the emotional provocation which carries the day."
babylon5,23cmfa,merreborn,5,Fri Apr 18 13:53:40 2014 UTC,"I think additionally, part of the point of the ""parent"" analogy is that there's no ""good guy"", no ""right side"".  It's a pointless squabble that deeply hurts (millions, billions dead?  entire races extinguished) the younger, weaker races.  In the case of the cold war, I suspect many would see it as at least somewhat necessary and justified.   That one side is ""the good guys"" and the other is ""the bad guys"".  It's hard to look at it neutrally.  At the same time, I kind of understand OP's point.  There's something a little anti-climactic about the scene.  Sheridan almost comes off a little whiny."
babylon5,23cmfa,TotallyNotKen,7,Fri Apr 18 17:13:59 2014 UTC,"Of course, for Sheridan, the 1900s Cold War would have been 270 years in the past, so it's probably not an analogy that springs to mind for most people, any more than you make references to War of the Austrian Succession."
babylon5,23cmfa,atreides78723,8,Fri Apr 18 21:39:11 2014 UTC,Everyone in the fleet is listening. Every alien race probably understands parents. Not every alien race is going to know or care about the intricacies of a 250-year-old squabble on one planet…. It's as much for Sheridan's fleet as it is for the Vorlons and Shadows.
babylon5,23cmfa,I_suck_at_mostthings,4,Fri Apr 18 23:00:52 2014 UTC,The point is that the Cold War was like two bickering parents making the children forced to pick sides.  I think JMS wanted to appeal to an issue that is universal instead of having Sheridan mention a very specific time in Earth history. That would have less of an impact.
babylon5,23cmfa,wickedsteve,2,Fri Apr 18 23:23:00 2014 UTC,I agree. I am sure JMS was influenced by the cold war. Who wasn't? But he would never be so blunt when the subtly has more impact.
babylon5,23cmfa,thegenregeek,7,Sat Apr 19 17:49:24 2014 UTC,"I always thought it was better if the analogy was the cold war.   I've felt that's very much true, mainly as I think the core of the story is structured around post WWII era global politics.   By that I mean each of the B5 Council races represent certain contemporaries on our Earth. The EA is the United States, a young democratic power expanding it's influence following a war with a genocidal zealot race that aimed to conquer everything and destroy inferior races (Dillgar=Nazi's. And ignoring the Minbari for one second, see below).  The Centuari Republic represents mainly the British Empire, but also European hegemony, a once leading power now in decline riding the coat tails of its closest ally the EA (US) as it tries to face the history it's brought to the world. The Minbari represent asian culture, mostly Japan (in regards to the Earth/Minbari War), older civilizations that historically had their own culture and way of doing things.  Finally the Narn represent Russia with an amalgam of Africa, the the Middle East and a number of other civilizations freed from European power (both it's control and threat), though hell bent on revenge for the destruction of native cultures and resources and a strong assertion of its new culture as justice for the loss of it's older one. Effectively they are the rising Russian power that's found new strength thanks to the ideals they needed to survive Centauri (British/European) interference.  The Shadows and Vorlons then represent the ideological structure that all of these races have to face during this new era. Though it's not strictly capitalism or communism. It's unrestrained freedom and aggression (Shadows) or absolute totalitarianism and oppression (Vorlons). Both taken to the farthest extreme. Extremes where that balance between safety and security is ignored for the dreams of the state. From that lens it's ultimately freedom/liberty and self determination (US/Capitalism/Shadows) versus collectivism/equality and safety (USSR/Communism/Vorlons)  Now that's not to say things line up perfectly in my my opinion. The Earth/Minbari War plays around with elements from WWII. The surprise attack starting the war (Pearl Harbor) occurs due to the actions of the EA (US), but for less political/militaristic reasons. And the surrender of Minbari forces (Japan/Asia) occurs as they are kicking the EA's (US) butt all the way back to Earth (this is similar to the Pacific War and US fighting up to Japan. Both major events are basically flipped with the cultural representations the same). Likewise the Narn are far more Russian in focus at the start, before the Shadow War twists that around and they kind of revert back to when they were under colonial rule. The Narn Regime (Russia) though initially represents the opposite to the EA (US). It too is a rising power, though long an enemy/victim of Centauri (British/European) aggression, using that to justify it's expansion (see USSR in eastern Europe) and assertion of its ideological views. Finally the Earth Alliance is of course far more of a militaristic driven power structure than the US, driven more by military control than the US was at that point.  Of course Babylon 5 itself represents the United Nations as it works around the back and forth of the EA (US) and Narn (Russia) governments over the matter of the Centauri (British Empire/Europe). It also deals with the other lesser powers that make up the 3rd World view of post WWII era global politics. The Babylon 5 Advisory Council is akin to the United Nation Security Council, where 5 major powers get veto authority over ""lesser"" nations.  All in all though the reason they used that analogy is because it's far easier to leverage that than trying to explain the above. Almost every one has parents (or parental figures) and most understand how them asking the child to choose is problematic.  Not every one is keenly aware of global politics post World War II."
babylon5,23cmfa,CthulhuCompanionCube,6,Fri Apr 18 16:40:48 2014 UTC,"That's probably because the Shadow War was an analogy for the Cold War. Spelling it out directly would remove any level of subtlety in an already unsubtle show. Not to meant that in story there wouldn't be any historical reference for the cold war for the alien races, so they wouldn't get the analogy."

babylon5,222tl5,bl0rk,13,Thu Apr 3 04:36:57 2014 UTC,"Londo was personally responsible for the deaths of a great many people. He was ruthless and hard-hearted whenever he wanted to be. He manipulated his friends, stabbed people in the back and encouraged aggression amongst other races. And the worst thing? He knew what he was doing was wrong. Everyone else who committed evil deeds pretended to themselves that it wasn't wrong, but Londo knew. He knew and he did it anyway.  I think you're looking too much through the camera lens if you think the others should have figured out what was going on. All they saw was Londo behaving erratically and turning to outright evil deeds. They saw him justify Centauri attacks on innocent worlds, defend the bombing of Narn and eject G'Kar from the council. Any confusion in the Centauri courts could easily be put down to the usual messed up Centauri politics. This was a world ruled by Cartagia after all.  As viewers we got to see the softer side of Londo, his moments of doubt and his crushing guilt. He hid these from everyone else. To them he was a monster, one who walked in shadows, and they wanted nothing to do with him. The vision Sheridan saw of the future would only solidify that.  Of course the great thing about Londo is that he's a villain we feel pity for. Not many shows can manage to have such a nuanced character."
babylon5,222tl5,DarrenGrey,2,Thu Apr 3 12:50:21 2014 UTC,"I disagree about him being responsible for a great many deaths and being ruthless, hard-hearted, and back-stabbing.    But I agree that he would look that way to a lay person viewing the council meetings and public interaction.  But anyone who actually deserved to sit in those meetings should have known better.  Yes, he justified Centauri attacks, bombings, and ejected G'Kar from the council... because that's his job.  He was an ambassador for a monarchy.  He's not the monarch!  He doesn't make those decisions.  Esteemed diplomats from all over the universe should have been aware of that."
babylon5,222tl5,DarrenGrey,13,Thu Apr 3 13:42:34 2014 UTC,"He arranged for the assassinations of Refa, Cartagia and Morden. Perhaps they deserved it, but it was all done in a ruthless way. He kept using Morden's services even when he knew the cost of life it was incurring. He used Vir as a pawn, lying to him and letting him be subjected to a forced mindscan to further his goals.  De'lenn and Sheriden both opposed their governments when their actions crossed their morals. Londo didn't. He went along with the plans, helped the plans, vigorously defended the plans. He was worse than hard-hearted, he was wholly complicit.  The shadows chose Londo for a reason. They knew he would play their game."
babylon5,222tl5,pretty_mermaid,4,Thu Apr 3 16:04:25 2014 UTC,"actually there is evidence that his governement intended to become more peacuful and transition to a better way, but as londa was more interested in going bak to the old ways he aligned himself with Rifa instead of the emperor setting in motion the whole catastrophe"
babylon5,222tl5,DarrenGrey,5,Mon Apr 7 13:46:37 2014 UTC,"Excellent point! The Centauri were a falling people as Londo saw them, and it was he and Rifa that spear-headed their return to more aggressive politics. Indeed, Rifa alone would never have been successful at this, it was only Londo's use of the Shadows that game the Centauri the confidence to expand and to fight the Narns. Londo was a nexus point for evil dealings, the counterpoint to the likes of Sheriden and Delenn."
babylon5,222tl5,wickedsteve,1 point,Mon Apr 7 13:50:09 2014 UTC,"He arranged for the assassinations of Refa, Cartagia and Morden.   And others are implied. These are just the ones we know about first hand."
babylon5,222tl5,lizzyshoe,6,Sat Apr 19 17:55:50 2014 UTC,"Londo was a dick to the Narns. They were afraid of him and the power he amassed. Remember how Morden helped him wipe out a Narn colony? Nobody knew how he did it, but everyone knew Londo was behind it. They didn't feel they could trust him anymore, so they kept him distant."
babylon5,222tl5,arquebus_x,2,Thu Apr 3 06:36:40 2014 UTC,"First of all, Morden didn't help him wipe out a colony.  Londo was furious with Morden when he heard the colony had been wiped out.  Secondly, most people outside of the Centauri government had no idea Londo had somehow orchestrated that. It was pretty clear that everyone was keeping Londo distant long before any of that happened."
babylon5,222tl5,TotallyNotKen,4,Thu Apr 3 13:45:42 2014 UTC,"First of all, Morden didn't help him wipe out a colony. Londo was furious with Morden when he heard the colony had been wiped out.   Yes, but no one else knew that.   Secondly, most people outside of the Centauri government had no idea Londo had somehow orchestrated that.   They knew that Londo was gaining power in his own government. They could connect the dots."
babylon5,222tl5,dbutlerjr,3,Thu Apr 3 17:12:22 2014 UTC,"At first, I think they were just worried about getting to close to him; karma has a way of rebounding on you, and he had started to acquire power. Once he got a lot of power, he was just horrible. When the edict came down that the penalty for the murder of any Centauri by any Narn will result in the execution of 500 Narns - including the perpetrators entire family - Londo announced it with a look of arrogance and authority.  Finally, the Centauri Republic had been returned to greatness.  When Babylon 5 sheltered a Narn ship (as required by interstellar treaty), Londo got on the link and demanded it be handed over, and a Centauri warship showed up and fired on the station.  Londo's government - with his apparent approval - tried to shoot holes in B5.  People who live on B5 can't really be expected to be happy about that."
babylon5,222tl5,andamaroo,2,Thu Apr 3 23:11:30 2014 UTC,"Londo was a great character- very flawed  but also capable of learning from mistakes and attempting to set things right.  He made a deal with the devil (Morden, Shadows) and it caused a lot of death and suffering, esp the Narn.  He eventually realized that it was a mistake and gradually achieved some level of redemption by the end of the series (and by the end of his life). However he made lots of mistakes in the beginning and won't be able to evade responsibility for everything he did.   He is sort of like Dukat from DS9 but more capable of introspection and humility and thus the ability to seek redemption for his mistakes whereas Dukat persisted in his delusions and perished as a result."
babylon5,222tl5,poltsi,2,Fri Apr 4 17:09:44 2014 UTC,"I remember when the war ended and Londo had to call for G'Kar's return for trial and execution at council (Long Twilight Struggle, 2x20 I think) many of the people on the chat rooms (irc.warnerbros.com) were so pissed at him, and you could tell in that scene.  They hated Londo so much, and I was so sad.  Peter Jurasik's acting was so good in that scene.  You could literally see on his face how hard it was for him to ask for it. It seemed like most fans didn't notice."
babylon5,222tl5,RogueWedge,2,Tue Apr 8 16:58:00 2014 UTC,"I just re-watched Londo's scenes in that episode.  He's visibly very unhappy with literally everything that happens. He was unhappy while talking with Refa and tries several times to talk him out of everything. He decries the attack on Narn.  Says mass-drivers are outlawed.  He looks really disturbed while watching the bombardment. While delivering the surrender conditions, he pauses and coughs before delivering the verdict for G'Kar.  Because it was difficult. And while G'Kar is giving his speech about freedom, Londo looks sad and begins to say something and stops himself.    This is a character that has never hesitated to wear his joy on his sleeve.  I mean, this is a guy who stopped and cried when he heard beautiful singing.  If G'Kar was his enemy and this was his moment of triumph over him, we should have seen it on his sleeve. We didn't, because this was not a moment of triumph for him.  He didn't smile in a single frame of this episode.  All the other Centauri smiled and laughed.  Londo didn't."
babylon5,21ty7n,YeahBruvInit,20,Mon Mar 31 14:56:33 2014 UTC,"Was there no other option but to kill him?   Sadly yes.   1) By that point Sheridan and crew had realized the Vorlon's were as large a threat as the Shadows. They were destroying entire civilization over the matter of the Shadow influence. Many that were forced to accept Shadow presence, which the Vorlon's could have made every effort to liberate and chose not to. The Vorlons had effectively ignored the plight of its allies and started killing them along with the enemy. (forfeiting any morality protections for them and their ambassador in the process)   2) Ulkesh had been ordered to leave and given an escort out, he willfully refused, assaulting station personnel in the process. Realizing that the station had no method to contain a Vorlon in captivity and that he could be free to do what ever he wanted. Security was clearly unable to deal with a pissed off Vorlon, even in full assault gear and environment rigged to fight him. This and point 1 changed Ulkesh from an ambassador to spy of an enemy state. (Leading to....)  3) Vorlon telepathic abilities are unknown, but clearly far beyond even a P12. For example, Kosh was able to access Sheridian's mind from across the station while being killed by Shadows. Given this the continued presence of a single Vorlon risked the entire station and every world joined in the war effort. There could be no guarantee that a telepath (or group of them) would have been strong enough to stop a Vorlon. (Remember the Vorlon's engineered them and knew their limitations...)  4) Time was of the essence. There was a limited window for Sheridan to unite the League against the Shadows and Vorlons. Attempting to work around Ulkesh may very well have slowed everything down while putting everything at stake. As Sheridan stated they could not do what was needed while Ulkesh was on board.  5) Technically, Ulkesh was murdered by one of his own, who was also an ambassador. That piece of Kosh may have been released by Sheridan, but it chose to protect Sheridan and the League. Therefore, in a strictly literal view Sheridan didn't kill him. He was merely an accomplice, maybe an orchestrator. (Who knows what Lorien was able to help that piece of Kosh do? Maybe it showed Sheridan he needed to kill Ulkesh)  Given all of this Sheridan's choice was aiding in the death of one being that was complacent, even boasting of genocide or potentially saving the lives of billions of innocent sentients that were victims of an interstellar pissing contest.   It's was a hard but necessary choice."
babylon5,21ty7n,thegenregeek,5,Mon Mar 31 16:55:13 2014 UTC,And I'd like to add one point. The only one who actually did the killing was the shard of Kosh Naranek and we can assume that to be an internal Vorlon conflict.
babylon5,21ty7n,ademnus,1 point,Tue Apr 1 03:27:01 2014 UTC,My thoughts exactly on this. This was the planned outcome.
babylon5,21ty7n,To0nMaN,4,Tue Apr 1 20:03:45 2014 UTC,"I think to some extent you are right... it even falls in line with a whole series of questionable self-righteous choices Sheridan makes in season 4. Ending with, frankly, Earth being forced into the alliance with the hostile display of an armada of hyper-advanced ships answering to only one man, hovering over its defenceless cities.  But on the other hand, he was known to be hostile and it can be presumed he would rather tear Babylon 5 apart than leave; after all, if Babylon 5 is not with the Vorlons, it must be cleansed. He was also blatantly spying on everybody and was a huge risk. It was not 'nice' to kill him outright, but it was the (self-righteous) 'only way'.  Does Londo not also basically try and kill G'Kar in one of the early episodes, only to be stopped by Garibaldi? Centauri kill spies by the bundle, in any case!"
babylon5,21ty7n,BrentingtonSteele,3,Mon Mar 31 15:33:50 2014 UTC,"I find that such an interesting question, because what Garibaldi accuses him of in season 4 seems to some extent completely legit. He comes back from the dead, has some alien sidekick and everybody acts like he is the messiah. And he and his friends, again, set up an army which answers only to them; the rangers are 100% loyal to him and Delenn, no questions asked. In many ways he and Delenn form a new group of 'first ones' to look over the smaller races and help them grow.  But to answer your question... the way I like to think about it is that while some characters were consciously written ambiguous, Sheridan was perhaps written as the 'good guy' but can be read as someone who is not that good. I mean to say; the series definitely frames him (constantly) as good, unlike Londo, so doubting it is going against the series. But to be fair that is the only thing which makes season 4 good for me, to sort-of imagine a creeping fascism into it. And to think that Garibaldi was not far off the truth anyway.  That is strange about the series overall, actually, season 1 had a lot of legal consequences for doing a small thing, by season 4 it was the might of several Minbari ships hovering over Babylon 5 that made things 'right'."
babylon5,21ty7n,HoopyFreud,2,Mon Mar 31 15:46:11 2014 UTC,"That was the brilliance of Bester's plan with Garibaldi. He said the he just enhanced his pre-existing paranoid and anti-authoritarian nature and in the face of what Sheridan had become nature just took its course anyway. Had Bester not used Garibaldi as he did, I don't think the relationship between him and Sheridan would have been much different other than the timing of their falling out perhaps being delayed."
babylon5,21ty7n,Dayanx,5,Mon Mar 31 19:48:05 2014 UTC,"Sheridan, Garibaldi, Londo, and G'Kar are not nice people. It's debatable whether or not they're even good people; they have too much of the zealot in them, and the politician. Ulkesh was too dangerous to confront in any peaceful way, as was seen earlier in the same episode when he was asked to leave. He (and his ship) are powerful enough to rip the station apart. Sheridan did what he felt he had to do, though it might not have been the right thing."
babylon5,21ty7n,wymarc10,1 point,Sat Apr 12 20:35:36 2014 UTC,I like to call it a balance.
babylon5,21ty7n,Dayanx,3,Mon Mar 31 16:01:08 2014 UTC,"1) None of the other ambassadors have been a threat to the station.  2) They did try asking him to leave first. His response was to assault station security officers, possibly killing some."
babylon5,21ty7n,DarrenGrey,1 point,Mon Mar 31 17:43:56 2014 UTC,"His response was to ignore them. ""Alright, that request just became an order."" They move in and get zapped. Classic escalation up the force continuum."
babylon5,21ty7n,TotallyNotKen,3,Mon Mar 31 15:27:17 2014 UTC,"I think Sheridan took on a bit of a ruthless attitude after coming back from Z'Ha'Dum. This is one aspect of that. In The Deconstruction of Falling Stars when the future-nazis try to portray him in a very totalitarian way I think they're building on truth rather than simply inventing things.  I don't think there's anyone in Babylon 5 who doesn't have a dark streak to them. This is Sheridan's shadow.  And hell, at least Ulkesh got it better than Morden..."
babylon5,21ty7n,fzammetti,2,Mon Mar 31 17:46:08 2014 UTC,"There would be no way of putting him on trial.  They ordered him to leave, and he refused.  They drew their weapons and he drove them away.  The power imbalance was so great that their only hope of beating him was a surprise attack, done by tempting him into a trap (something Sheridan had done earlier).  Two other things to notice are (a) the Vorlons were wiping out anyone with Shadow connections, and the Shadows had been to B5 multiple times, and allies of the Shadows were on the station many times, so the Vorlons might have gotten around to toasting B5 eventually, once they were sure they could handle Draal; and (b) Sheridan had a piece of Kosh in him at the time, and it was a plan Kosh apparently agreed with, and in the end it was Kosh killed Kosh2, not any of the security officers or even Sheridan.  Sheridan got the encounter suit destroyed, and did him notable harm, but in the end it was a fight between two Vorlons."
babylon5,21ty7n,dbutlerjr,1 point,Mon Mar 31 17:57:49 2014 UTC,"Yes, he was right to do it. The Vorlons were no longer allies at that point, he simply killed (or helped kill, as others have rightly pointed out) an enemy combatant essentially- and that only after giving him a chance to leave peacefully. I'd go so far as to say Sheridan was TOO NICE about the whole thing. I think he would have been entirely justified in spacing him immediately without a word... you know, if he COULD have and if it would have done any good anyway!"

Just generally be aware that it's a universe with ancient races and lots of politics with species (and within species, including humans).  However surely there's something better out there? Thirdspace is mostly good for just one elevator scene, and that requires some knowledge of the characters involed to really mean something.  I also don't think it's all that Lovecraft-y. Though I suppose it's more Lovecraft-y than most things that call themselves Lovecraft-y..."
babylon5,21s5a9,DarrenGrey,2,Mon Mar 31 01:37:56 2014 UTC,"I see, thank you. Well, the last few months I've been reading a lot of HPL and I'd love to watch a movie that has that sort of narrative and ideas. I've yet to find one that tugs on the same fear strings - and as I'm sure you're aware, all movie adaptations I came across are terrible (in a bad, non-horrifying way).  I guess I judged it as potentially Lovecrafty because from what I read, it deals with a very ancient alien race that is nearly god-like and malevolent, and I've heard some mentions of impossible geometry as well."
babylon5,21s5a9,brbATF,4,Mon Mar 31 02:32:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah, there are aliens of that sort, trying to break in from another dimension. And it does the nice Lovecraft-y thing of never actually showing them. The problem with most horror movies is they make a spectacle of the horror, which is precisely counter to the more aetherial horror that Lovecraft did so well.  I could have a low opinion of the movie due to how poor it compared with the main Babylon 5 series. Maybe on its own it's not so bad!  I'd also point out that Babylon 5 as a series has a fair bit of ancient and powerful alien races of malign/dangerous intent. Very worth watching if you want a touch of that done well :)"

I had trouble with season 1 when it was on in the 90s.  I came back to B5 during s3 and had my mind blown.  Stick with B5 and it will reward you.
babylon5,21lky1,mattzog,8,Fri Mar 28 16:01:56 2014 UTC,Yep. Season 1 really drags and is the reason I will likely struggle to ever get my SO to watch it. Might just skip most the episodes.  Its worth it though. Season 2-4 is the best TV I've ever experienced.
babylon5,21lky1,midwinter-az,16,Fri Mar 28 18:18:33 2014 UTC,"One thing that's kind of unique about B5 is that there's an incredible amount of worldbuilding and backstory in the early season(s). Things that seem boring or insignificant come back in a BIG way later on. A lot of the ""B"" plots (the secondary story in an episode) in S1 are more important than the ""A"" plots. So grit your teeth to get through the groaners and try to pay attention to the other, more subtle things going on in the background. I appreciated S1 much more after going back to it later. I'm a writer, so I'm biased, but the sheer craft that went into laying the B5 foundations continues to impress me, and I keep finding new things each time I re-watch.  Another thing that can really increase your appreciation of things is reading the behind-the-scenes notes on the Lurker's Guide. (http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/)"

babylon5,21lky1,arquebus_x,9,Sun Mar 30 15:13:08 2014 UTC,"Ignoring the season 1 problems (which were considerable), there is the simple fact that shows like Battlestar Galactica and Firefly only existed in the forms they did because Babylon 5 paved the way for the possibility.  I watched Babylon 5 when it first aired, and I can't watch BSG because it's so trite and boring (and handles religion so, so badly)."
babylon5,21lky1,quintus_aurelianus,6,Fri Mar 28 16:24:51 2014 UTC,"Like every one else has said, the first season is hit or miss.  Probably more miss. However, I always advise people not to skip it because so much of the wonderful later seasons build off of things set up in first season eps that it is worth the experience."
babylon5,21lky1,TotallyNotKen,5,Fri Mar 28 21:13:55 2014 UTC,"I'm with the others; the first season is wobbly.  But you've made it through the shakiest part, so keep going.  (You might skip s1e14, ""TKO."")"
babylon5,21lky1,FellKnight,3,Fri Mar 28 19:47:58 2014 UTC,"I never understood all the hate for TKO.  It's not the pinnacle of television, certainly, but the B story (Ivanova/Rabbi) is very solid imo."
babylon5,21lky1,TotallyNotKen,3,Fri Mar 28 16:40:54 2014 UTC,I never understood all the hate for TKO.   Maybe it's because the title story is a retread of 1000 lame movie plots in which the outsider wins the big fight and earns the respect of the people he was fighting.  The plot and even some of the dialogue were retreads with way too many miles on them.
babylon5,21lky1,FellKnight,6,Sat Mar 29 03:28:55 2014 UTC,"Which is absolutely a reason to consider it mediocre, tired, and uninspired, but I never understood ""worst ever"".  To me, S1E4 ""Infection"" was pure cringe from start to end."

babylon5,21lky1,Sometimes_Lies,5,Wed Apr 16 06:11:36 2014 UTC,"Just to reiterate, it may be a generation gap, but the fact you're in the first season is definitely contributing.  I honestly feel it's one of the best shows I've ever seen, however, the first season is significantly worse than the rest of the series. Every time I recommend the series, I always am careful to mention that.  Things do improve and continue to improve after that. The acting gets noticeably better, you get fewer and fewer ""filler"" episodes, the primary plot of the series slowly creeps in and eventually takes the show over (this is a good thing), the writing improves, you start to care about the characters since you know them, etc.  So basically,   I'm ready for the downvotes but I was wondering if you all felt this way or can convince me its worth continuing watching.   Yes. Even as a huge fan of the show, I consider the first season a chore. I think the rest of the show redeems it, especially S3-S4. S2 is still much better than S1, though.  Edit: Just to be clear, I don't recommend skipping S1 either. It's not great, but later seasons do build off it in meaningful ways. Since the entire show was planned beforehand, there is a lot of significant foreshadowing going on even now."
babylon5,21lky1,phantom887,4,Sun Apr 6 00:47:40 2014 UTC,"It took about a month to get through season 1, and then about 6 weeks to get through the next four."
babylon5,21lky1,ademnus,5,Fri Mar 28 20:17:00 2014 UTC,"It's VERY worth continuing watching.  Thing is, season 1 is very hard to get through and we'd all tell you to skip it if it werent for the fact that it sets up so much important groundwork for the story.  HANG IN THERE. It is TOTALLY worth it."
babylon5,21lky1,c-m-vanek,3,Fri Mar 28 21:58:04 2014 UTC,I have watched it multiple times and I agree with what everyone else is saying about give it time.  Just hold on a little longer. Finish the whole 1st Season before you say goodbye.
babylon5,21lky1,OisinDebard,3,Fri Mar 28 23:02:30 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Every single person I've tried to get to watch the show was stumped by the first season. Interestingly, it DOES start picking up around episode 11 or 12, but to really get hooked, you've gotta go on to season 2 and 3. I'm sorry. I feel your pain, but it is worth it."
babylon5,21lky1,ManWithABeard,2,Fri Mar 28 22:21:42 2014 UTC,The first season is uneven - but it gets sooooo much better.
babylon5,21lky1,DarrenGrey,2,Sat Mar 29 09:31:39 2014 UTC,"Keep the faith! The payout is pretty amazing. It's like the opposite of the new BSG (which I thought started brilliantly and then got wobblier and wobblier).  Mind you, if you really don't want to try then there's plenty of other good TV out there. B5 does need a bit of initial dedication to reap the fruits of its later highs."

The ending showed what a lack of planning will do to a show.  Babylon 5 is the opposite - it starts, frankly, terribly.  The graphics are never as good as BSG (although they do improve) but the story is light years ahead.  It's without a doubt the best-plotted show of any genre I've ever seen."

Hang in there. I promise. Season 1 sucks until you are in the later seasons and you realize how valuable it was."
babylon5,21lky1,Chrysalii,0,Sat Mar 29 20:09:54 2014 UTC,There is a bit of the Seinfeld Effect (Warning TVTropes). However it's fared very well despite it.  But it's still the best once you get past season 1. Even later in season 1 when all the pieces start to get put together.
babylon5,21hvuf,co_fragment,6,Thu Mar 27 11:18:01 2014 UTC,"I was there just after they struck the sets on Crusade. Good to see old Big Bird hasn't been changed any. They named each stage after a Muppet. A was Big bird, I think B was green so it was Kermit. C was pink/purple/blue I think, forgot the name of that. There's a picture somewhere of Mira and Bill hanging out next to that stage, waiting for their scene.  The ceilings were pretty high, actually. They have to be, considering the White Star bridge was pretty tall and it was a swing set. This used to be a former hot tub factory. They ran the wires in giant wooden troughs above everything. Everything was made of wood, not too surprising since they didn't bother to cover up the sounds of people walking on what is obviously wood. One year they came back for a new season and the Zocalo had become warped, because it was so hot that summer.  All that was left inside was the paint on the walls, a few pictures outside Kermit. That's where the craft table was always for people to eat quickly during shooting. Otherwise it was outside in a tent for lunch. There were huge weird pencil drawings in the little rooms outside each sound stage where people would wait until the light was off.   The office of the person who gave us the tour still had scripts in it along with books full of all the props. I was allowed to look at props, but not the scripts because Crusade had not finished airing yet. The blue screen was still up inside Big Bird. It was to the side and part of the end of that stage. Stage C was for swing sets but it was a lot smaller than the others, but the doors were still plenty tall. You could also still see the tape lines for the Crusade sets where the prison cells were, etc.  JMS name was still on one of the parking places outside, and the Sentient Xing sign was still on the gate. If I knew where my photos were I would share. Not all that exciting though, pictures of empty stages with concrete floors and colorful walls. Bear's empty prop cage and all that."
babylon5,21hvuf,eryntzun,2,Thu Mar 27 19:55:34 2014 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! That's definitely some cool insight into the daily workings of the place - I've never heard the whole 'stages as Muppets' part, before (maybe C was Grover or Cookie Monster?).  What was the reason you were getting the tour? As for any pictures, I'm sure I speak for plenty of people here when I say we'd love to see them."
babylon5,21hvuf,fzammetti,4,Thu Mar 27 23:07:40 2014 UTC,"This post reminds me a lot of when I first moved to Pennsylvania, the first road trip I made was down to West Chester, where the Commodore 64 headquarters was... well, USED to be as it turns out: it's now a QVC studio complex.  The Commodore 64 and the old Atari 8-bit computers informed my childhood about as much as Babylon 5 did my early 20's so I definitely understand the drive to want to make such a pilgrimage (even if only digitally in this case)... and I understand the disappointment of the reality of things :("
babylon5,21hvuf,fzammetti,3,Thu Mar 27 13:19:42 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't say I was disappointed by what I found, but all the references to a disused factory conjured a more grand image for me than this. This location seems more fitting for a failed dotcom business."
babylon5,21hvuf,cbnyc0,2,Thu Mar 27 13:53:34 2014 UTC,"I guess it was my disappointment projected then :)   My point was that like the Commodore headquarters, because it and the B5 studio hold great importance as the place something that meant so much to us was produced, I expected to find a monument to the greatness of the creations at both places rather than simply the continued march of capitalism at play. It's easy to forget that things don't have the same importance to everyone else as to ourselves and these places are really just leasable parcels for business endeavors rather than the shrines they are to us.  Then again, Elvis has Graceland, don't us B5 fans deserve the same?! :)"

In some ways I've always thought of Morden as another victim of the Shadows, much as Anna was.

babylon5,204un3,deadfraggle,13,Tue Mar 11 12:52:50 2014 UTC,I'd put the Starfury up against the Minbari Nial Class Fighter.  To avoid season 3 spoilers I'll just say This Ship vs This Ship  Some others could be Earth Alliance vs Minbari and Narn vs Centari.
babylon5,204un3,Game-On,3,Tue Mar 11 13:34:13 2014 UTC,The Shadow Vessel would look awesome against our current white background.
babylon5,204un3,Game-On,3,Tue Mar 11 19:22:34 2014 UTC,You could also pair it with a Vorlon ship.

I remember I suddenly had to ""go to the bathroom"", but I told her to keep watching without me. Only way I could get through it a second time in my life :)   As a side note, she's still not a sci-fi fan, just not her thing, but she said B5 was a lot better than she thought it would be and she liked it.

babylon5,1zp2tp,co_fragment,3,Thu Mar 6 12:24:09 2014 UTC,I did but felt that this was a more constructive video to post.  Also regarding the video you posted JMS was correct.  Love can make you completely idiotically self destructively irrational.  Yes logically what Bill said was correct.   But JMS showed the dangers of unrequited love.  And gave Lennier and Lyta a reason to team up and kick psi-corp ass in the telepath war.
babylon5,1zp2tp,DarrenGrey,1 point,Thu Mar 6 15:43:17 2014 UTC,"Yup, very much agree. He says in the video that Lennier's love is a ""pure love"", but it's not. It's real, obsessive, dangerous love, not fairy tale stuff."

babylon5,1z8rhz,CountMecha,1 point,Tue Mar 4 21:55:58 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds worse than I mean. I guess what I would say is that they aren't conventional hosts. Will is incredibly dry and deadpan, and Ian sounds kind of clumsy.  These aren't bad things, just interestingly off kilter. I think what pulls it all together though is that Heidi and Elizabeth sound fairly engaged in the show, which is I have to admit moreso than I was at this early point in the show. They throw out those wild theories and keep getting into characters that will never appear again (Takashima and Ko'Dath), so it all gets rounded off into an oddball but fun and entertaining hour or so."

And the end result shows that the script-writers probably did a proper calculation of this to make sure it came out sensible.

I can recite every word of that line from memory, most of the show as i said ive watched it a lot, but i never thought about the numbers, pretty cool.   Also, for your first watch you should definitely watch all the first season eps, just know it gets so much better after that. Now i watch just a few from s1 when i go through the show.

S3 has its weak spots at times (Plot A of Grey 17, Exogenesis, Convictions) but it just shines otherwise.  I still remember how I felt at the end of 3x22. I stared at a blank tv for about 15 minutes, thinking ""what could possibly top this? what motive would I have to watch more television?"" I spent in total about 45 minutes just idling from the chair to the bed. I guess I felt like my mind had finished a huge meal and didn't want to let in even one more notion."

babylon5,1yrkxg,saqwarrior,3,Tue Feb 25 02:36:36 2014 UTC,"I think that he said something to the effect that he told the story he wanted to and that dragging it out more might have added a few more explosions but not much substance.  I felt that aye it was a bit quick but OTOH once the characters understand what the ""Shadow War"" was really all about, the fairly quick resolution of it makes a lot more sense.  I also believe that ""intersections in Real Time"" (the Sheridan torture ep)"" was originally intended to be the season finale- could you imagine waiting a whole summer after that ep?  Frankly, after watching the entire series, I felt like JMS wrapped everything up very well and would not have changed any of it."

In the movies, a guy meets a girl and they're in bed 35 minutes later and married by closing credits.  I've seen movies in which someone dies and their romantic partner is hooked up with someone else in the next day or so.  But if my wife died, especially under those circumstances, it would be a long time before I was ready to start again.  And when I did, I would have to go slow.  Right now there are things I've only told my wife, things that are just between us.  Getting over the feeling of betraying her in death wouldn't be a one-episode process.

babylon5,1xucu4,drummer_San,8,Thu Feb 13 22:30:51 2014 UTC,"Vorlons.   What's on the Vorlon Homeworld? What was the nature of the intelligence of Vorlon ships? Were they, themselves, essentially Vorlons, or was the relationship more like that of a horse and rider? Did larger Vorlon ships require larger crews, or was every ship crewed by a single Vorlon -- or no Vorlons, the ships instead acting out the will of the Vorlons without pilots at all? Did Vorlons share a collective consciousness of some kind (""We are all Kosh"")?   What was the nature of the ""true"" Vorlon body? It was clearly luminescent, capable of passing through the bulkheads of a space station without damaging them, capable of defying the centripetal gravity of the station. But it also apparently had substance and so could not be a purely energetic phenomenon.   I know only what Kosh would tell me if I asked.   ""The truth points to itself."""
babylon5,1xucu4,IHaveThatPower,6,Thu Feb 13 23:16:36 2014 UTC,"Here are some speculative answers based on official but non-canon sources (IE, statements made on usenet, the mongoose publishing sourcebooks, etc)  Vorlon ships are organically grown and upon coming of age, are implanted with a partial personality matrix of the vorlon to which they're assigned.  Ships didn't have crews as we know them- rather the metaphysical vorlons were able to ""bond"" with their ships (similar to how shadows plugged individuals into their own ships, but just like everything between the Vorlons and shadows, it was flip-flopped.  Where shadow ships overwhelmed and imposed the will of its programming on the individual inside, Vorlon ships had their programming controlled by the vorlon riders.  Sometimes there was more than one vorlon in a ship.)  Are you familiar with EVE online?  Similar to that, the vorlons made their ships extensions of their consciousness and will.  Vorlons had a collective consciousness of a sort- they could place their thoughts, memories, experiences, etc onto a....the best way to describe it would be similar to a ""cloud"" setup...and from there it was available to any and all Vorlons who wanted it.  This is how the Vorlons knew Kosh was being killed.  It's not impossible to think that they experienced getting ripped apart, piece by piece, even as Kosh did.  Here is an answer that IS canonical (from the mouth of JMS when answering questions about how a Vorlon can be poisoned)- Vorlon bodies are composed of a crystalline lattice made up of energetic particles- energy that has been ""frozen"" into semi-solid matter.  Like the Shadows, they could phase through solid matter, explaining how they were able to enter/leave their encounter suits, or how Kosh/Ulkesh were able to leave the station without breaching the hull.    As for what's on the Vorlon Homeworld- a small snippet of that can be seen in one of the comics, the plot of which follows Director Vacit of the Psy-corps to a Vorlon base where teeps were first engineered.  It's not the homeworld, but does offer a decent look at how Vorlons lived- or at least worked.  Again, i say there are NOT officially canon pieces of information, but they come from sources that were overseen by JMS himself, or written based on outlines that JMS penned.  Enjoy!!!"
babylon5,1xucu4,FrodoFraggins,2,Fri Feb 14 01:06:37 2014 UTC,JMS didn't oversee the Mongoose stuff at all.   So unless it's a JMS quote it's not even close to canon.

babylon5,1xm58p,unstablereality,1 point,Tue Feb 11 17:01:48 2014 UTC,"Zócalo: NSFW !      The Zócalo (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsokalo], plinth) is the main plaza or square in the heart of the historic center of Mexico City. The plaza used to be known simply as the ""Main Square"" or ""Arms Square,"" and today its formal name is Plaza de la Constitución (Constitution Square). This name does not come from any of the Mexican constitutions that have governed the country but rather from the Cádiz Constitution which was signed in Spain in 1812. However, it is almost always called the Zócalo today. Plans were made to erect a column as a monument to Independence, but only the base, or zócalo, was ever built. The plinth was destroyed long ago but the name has lived on. Many other Mexican towns and cities, such as Oaxaca and Guadalajara, have adopted the word zócalo to refer to their main plazas, but not all.

babylon5,1wysfe,YeOldeMuppetPastor,5,Tue Feb 4 07:02:30 2014 UTC,"I'm sure it has been talked to death on this sub, but goddamn if G'Kar didn't grow the most as a character and become one of the best characters of the show.  Such a shift from season 1 villain G'Kar."
babylon5,1wysfe,psicopbester,2,Tue Feb 4 15:43:49 2014 UTC,It is amazing. I remember reading once that JMS felt that Vir of all people grew the most for him. Hard to say with such amazing growth in Gkar and Londo.
babylon5,1wysfe,YeOldeMuppetPastor,3,Tue Feb 4 17:52:21 2014 UTC,Londo's story is so much more tragic.  He got everything he ever wanted but is so much more a prisoner for getting it.

babylon5,1wypfp,mongd66,15,Tue Feb 4 05:39:49 2014 UTC,People in general don't give this show enough credit for what it really is: one of the first series (if not the first) to use that 5 year arc writing style which modern dramas still use to this day.
babylon5,1wypfp,hpvista,7,Tue Feb 4 06:46:12 2014 UTC,"I hear SO many people marginalize this show, particularly in favor of DS9, it drives me insane. There is no comparing those shows, and B5 was a rare, rare gem of epic proportions."
babylon5,1wypfp,ademnus,5,Tue Feb 4 08:14:31 2014 UTC,"I consider DS9 to be the best Star Trek series by far, and I often compare it to Babylon 5, but there is no favouritism. If you liked B5, and understood why it was so damn good as it was (dialogues, character development, long story arc, great drama, superb story-telling, depth of themes...) then it comes, I feel, totally natural to see the resemblance in DS9.  They are two very different shows, being set in very different universes, but they share a common ""feel"" to them, and that is why I think it should be impossible to love one without loving the other. At least, I know it's impossible for me ;)"
babylon5,1wypfp,curson,5,Tue Feb 4 23:36:03 2014 UTC,"Well, having watched them both as they originally aired, I followed the behind-the-scenes of both as the years went along and any resemblance between the two had a lot to do with both the fact that JMS first pitched B5 to paramount as the new Trek series (which they rejected because they refused to do a continuing drama) and because, as B5 grew in popularity, DS9 tried to copy them. When suddenly they extolled the virtues of becoming a continuing drama, we just laughed knowing the history. DS9 also couldnt manage to maintain ratings without show transforming gimmicks. First it was episodic, then they brought back worf to save it, then suddenly it was a continuing drama, then suddenly dr bashir's entire history changed. I couldn't keep up."
babylon5,1wypfp,ademnus,3,Wed Feb 5 06:01:55 2014 UTC,"I have honestly never heard that myself. I find B5 to be remembered much more fondly than DS9, and more widely praised in many circles."
babylon5,1wypfp,DarrenGrey,2,Tue Feb 4 13:08:08 2014 UTC,"heh go ask in /r/startrek or /r/daystrominstitute -DS9 is heralded as the best series of the lot, which truly blows my mind. But bring up B5 and you'll really get upset."
babylon5,1wypfp,ademnus,3,Tue Feb 4 19:18:39 2014 UTC,"Well, what do you expect bringing it up to die-hard fans like that? If someone identifies ""fan of Star Trek,"" there's a good chance they're going to be biased."

babylon5,1wypfp,Okiah,4,Tue Feb 4 08:45:32 2014 UTC,"I've stopped trying to convince people that B5 is the greatest show ever and now I go straight to trying to convince them it's the greatest STORY ever told.   I mean, if I'm going to fight an uphill battle I may as well go for broke :)   Truthfully, the only story I can think of that's even close is Lord of the Rings... and it's no coincidence B5 borrows from LotR quite a bit (a fact that in no way detracts from either)."
babylon5,1wypfp,fzammetti,8,Wed Feb 5 02:23:02 2014 UTC,"I got some friends into B5 recently. In the first few episodes they said they were getting a bit sick of the cheesy stories where the station captain goes out in the fighter ship to deal with the problem of the week. But then it all turned around a few episodes in when Garibaldi stopped Sinclair and told him to stop going out, that it wasn't the station captain's responsibility, and that many Minbari War veterans took unnecessary risks because they had a death wish. Not only did the show break apart the usual sci-fi trope, but it added a whole level of psychological complexity on top.  What really got me in the whole 5-season arc was how the victory over the shadows was left hollow after the in-fighting between the leftover races and the attack on Centauri Prime. There was no black and white victory, there was no simple ending. A bit depressing perhaps, but so much more engaging."
babylon5,1ws3kk,Grandoldpodcast,14,Sun Feb 2 03:43:13 2014 UTC,Last year my Calculus teacher recommended Babylon 5 to me. Unfortunately I couldn't watch it then because I didn't have the time but during my senior year my lung collapsed and I got hospitalized. Since I had all the time in the world in the hospital I watched Babylon 5. Best decision ever.  Really a shame my math teacher and I are the only people in the school who have ever watched or heard of the show.  It's too good of a show to be a cult classic...  Edit: grammar
babylon5,1ws3kk,PlanetaryPeak,15,Sun Feb 2 06:20:25 2014 UTC,I would buy every season on Blu-ray if I could. Great show.

babylon5,1wojuq,ShadyBiz,8,Sat Feb 1 03:41:31 2014 UTC,Did you enjoy DS9 after season 2? Then you will enjoy B5.  The SFX and CGI are dated (way more than trek due to it being mostly CGI rather than models) but the story and pace is very similar to DS9 (loooong backstory to why that is).  It is a quality sci-fi and should be watched by any sci-fi fan.

babylon5,1wojuq,optical_power,3,Sun Feb 2 00:33:06 2014 UTC,NIce interview.  Personally I'd like to see new ideas being brought out rather and a rehash of Babylon 5 (as much as love the show).  I think it's because of things like the same sex couple issue etc. You can't do things like that easily these days. Also modern shows will need have attractive teens doing everything as opposed to wizened old space dogs and ugly aliens - or perhaps not get shown/build a advertisers prefered demographic.

babylon5,1v4wea,floodcasso2,11,Tue Jan 14 05:55:18 2014 UTC,"Their Rebo and Zooty comedy routines were more like a farce or caricature of comedy.  A sort of a anti-comedy or meta-comedy.  The real humor came when Rebo and Zooty where out of character and sitting down to dinner with Sheridan and Delen.  It was irony and satire delivered as serious conversation with lines such as:  ""But no one takes commedians seriously.""  ""The real comedy all happens in the senate.  They do one idiotic thing after another but people listen because they say it seriously.""  I thought the whole thing was great.  When they create the expectation of comedy, they don't deliver.  But, tell the audience to expect serious conversation and then give them comedy.  Very Penn and Teller."

I was puzzled by Penn (I think it's Penn - the one who talks), I think my strongest memory of that episode is him ""explaining"" humour to Sheridan with the same passion by which I explain a clerk at my bank that I need to withdraw money after having queued for 15 minutes. Also I think the final revelation by Sheridan of what Zooty/Teller (the guy who doesn't talk) whisphered to him were massively underwhelming. Or at least I never got why that was so illuminating for him.  It wasn't a bad episode, I sort of liked the Morden-Lennier pairing, it was unexpected and fun.

babylon5,1v4wea,mnlg,1 point,Tue Jan 14 08:45:21 2014 UTC,"After prowling around on the B5 wiki yesterday, I noticed there's not anything that seems to specifically confirm it. Maybe it's just my own headcanon. I just always assumed that's what it was, though, especially because I think it was around the time they started layering in those things."
babylon5,1v4wea,lamblikeawolf,1 point,Tue Jan 14 17:03:55 2014 UTC,"Right, I have devoured most B5 text resources on the net since 2003, and I haven't found any such suggestion anywhere else either. It's not too far out, but I am still unsure about it. The episode is mostly comedic and the message is meant to be uplifting and enlightening. Not that jms wouldn't use this for dramatic effects, but I personally can't see it.  Oh by the way, the second thing you mentioned was at the end of season 5, specifically in the episode ""Objects at rest"". There's a nice dramatic music as the camera zooms in on a certain object."
babylon5,1v4wea,mnlg,1 point,Tue Jan 14 17:14:21 2014 UTC,"Good to know. It's been a while since I last watched the series - I'm borrowing the DVDs from my parents house. I know they did a couple of flash forward episodes at the end of S4, because they weren't sure if they were going to get a fifth season at the time, but I couldn't remember if this had been one of them.  It's just the tone of the way Zooty says ""because it tells me to"" in that episode that made me make the connection."

babylon5,1v4wea,mnlg,10,Tue Jan 14 17:40:19 2014 UTC,"Same thing happened in Star Trek (Even in the newer series), the humour of the far future seems to be the humour of the 1950's. I supposed the closest answer I can come up with is that science fiction programs have sci-fi writers, and not comedy writers.  Also the way the crew laughed certainly didn't help any of those scenes."
babylon5,1v4wea,marsneedstowels,7,Mon Jan 13 23:59:14 2014 UTC,"Part of it is that Penn and Teller are not, in fact, funny, except insofar as they are Penn and Teller. Put the same humor in another outfit, and it becomes painfully obvious that they are not funny."
babylon5,1v4wea,arquebus_x,2,Tue Jan 14 00:04:27 2014 UTC,"It's hard to have something that will consistently be considered funny by the entire audience. I mean, it's not specifically a comedy so it can't really be assumed that the audience will all have the same sense of humor. Thus it makes more sense to have them actually not be funny, at least from the perspective of the audience. Putting the audience in the position of the outsider thus allows you to observe that other people find them funny, but still be unable to get it.  Compare the cases of 30 Rock and Studio 60. In-universe Studio 60 was supposed to be funny, but it was almost universally agreed by viewers that it wasn't, it was just terrible. This creates a dissonance in the audience. 30 Rock, on the other hand, was supposedly to be pretty crappy in-universe and functioned more as a parody of terrible sketches since it wasn't actually supposed to be viewed as funny and it wasn't it actually became funny because there is an agreement and you can thus enjoy mocking how bad it is."

Though It seems that most of the aliens are monocultures compared to us Terrans (I've yet to find SF where that isn't the case...though it seems there would be something to that effect out there...) thus only have the one religious view that they are shown.  Also religion is also programmed into all of the younger species in the galactic region by the Vorlons in order to get us to do their bidding.
babylon5,1uoncy,Dracoprimus,3,Tue Jan 21 19:10:31 2014 UTC,"Listen to Garibaldi. I'm re-watching and only up to S01e16, but Garibaldi has already made several very firm statements in the series that solidify him as an atheist, if that's what you're looking for.  Also, this is a show about people with emotions and feelings. By that point, Ivanova has already been established as Jewish as well. Are you really surprised that a Jewish person takes God somewhat seriously?  Religion is a deeply ingrained part of culture - for the aliens in the series as well as how it affects people in real life. (See how much you are confounded by its inclusion, as opposed to its exclusion?) I think it gives the show a beautiful sense of realism, and adds degrees of believability. Because really, at the end of the day, aren't they all searching for universal messages and truths? And isn't that what religions do?  If you're uncomfortable with the theme of religion, and if you feel it ruins the experience, I hate to tell you that it doesn't go away, because it means you will probably stop watching it.

babylon5,1uoncy,hitchslap55,3,Mon Feb 3 22:39:09 2014 UTC,"I'm a true and true die hard atheist. And I've so far felt Babylon 5 has one of the best, most mature treatments of religion in any media, especially TV show. Unlike Battlestar which basically said with definitive conviction there is a God, but not really questioning why or how, or Lost which tries to do the placating, ""Maybe there is one, maybe not, it's all good son!"" agnostic spin, B5 dealt with it from multiple angles and NOT just an atheistic one, though btw, if pay close attention to the show, you'll note that multiple characters on the show have expressed an atheist background. It's just not everyone, because the B5 world is not a world where religion doesn't exist.  If your frame of reference is coming from Star Trek, I could see the apprehension. Star Trek is for all intents and purposes, an atheistic show. Yes, there are characters who believe in religion, think they're God, have met him, etc. But for the most part, majority of main characters, majority of the Starfleet are presented as not believers of any particular religion. And that's fine too, I'm not saying that's bad either. But that's not B5's deal. B5's world HAS religion. And it's not gonna shy away from it, nor should it.  Like I said, I'm a devout atheist. Among my group of friends, I am in the minority, most of them are religious practitioners. And I've had many great and informative conversations with them about religion that was neither preachy nor condescending from either direction. I love studying and discussing theology. And going back to the show a little bit, the first Commander, Sinclair, mentioned a Jesuit background. He also jokes he wasn't the most devout worshiper. Jesuit's are famous for being one of the most theological orders out there, they were throughout history known for their study of philosophy and science, one of the first and still only Christian orders that accept the Big Bang and evolution. I've always regarded this to be the most reflective on the show's ""stance"" on religion. Let's study it, let's discuss it. Let's delve into actual theology because so many shows don't. And if you don't believe in any of it, that's perfectly fine, and if you do believe in it, that's perfectly fine too. But neither belief nor disbelief is a requirement to get something out of the conversation.  Sometimes religion is shown in a positive light like when it gives certain characters like G'Kar direction and purpose in life. Sometimes it is shown negatively like when they did the Christian science allegory with the parents allowing their kid to die instead of seek medical treatment. If you want an actual real conversation about the subject, then you can't just paint it as all bad, just like you wouldn't want it painted as all good. It's multifaceted. And if there is one thing Babylon 5 is, it's multifaceted.  And perhaps in the end, it's just the case where you just feel uncomfortable when the show does any mention or discussion of religion. And that's fine too, that just means the show isn't for you. If you feel the show is preaching to you, well I'd highly disagree with that point. I'd be surprised if anyone who finished watching Babylon 5 walked away thinking that show was pro-religion. Or anti-religion. The show isn't interested in making a statement trying to come up with an answer one way or the other. The show is interested in asking the questions. I feel secure enough in my beliefs to not feel threatened by it and in fact enjoy and love it."

babylon5,1ufzpy,ademnus,7,Sun Jan 5 09:29:33 2014 UTC,"In retrospect, I'm glad they filmed SIL when they thought there'd be no fifth season. For a start it meant we still had Claudia on the cast. I can't imagine the last episode without her.  I loved the little touches they put in as well. The ending sequence with shots of the cast when they arrived & when they left is a beautiful monument. That's another reason I am glad they made the episode when they did - if it had been shot during season 5's production I doubt they would have had the shot of the cryo tube with Marcus' body in it, and the writing on it:  SUBJECT: MARCUS COLE DESIGNATION: RANGER STATUS: DECEASED COMMENTS: INDEFINITE HOLD IN THE EVENT OF NEW RESUSCITATION TECHNOLOGY REQUESTED BY:CMDR. S. IVANOVA  Perfect."

SIL was supposed to be that ending.  When the go-ahead for season 5 happened JMS wrote ""The Deconstruction Of Falling Stars"" to replace SIL because he didn't want it to be seen before it was supposed to be."

A close second (but sill second) is the final episode of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, with Adama sitting by the grave of Laura Roslin.

Shows like Lost, which people rave about the arc, don't even begin to hold a candle to what JMS achieved.  When you watch the whole series, seemingly throwaway moments in season 1 have vast implications in later seasons.  Better yet, things aren't thrown out or changed just because they become inconvenient.  In general, if a premise changes, it is because we are seeing events through the character's eyes, and they don't have the whole truth yet.

babylon5,1ta07q,cRaZyDaVe23,32,Thu Dec 19 21:55:17 2013 UTC,"The Minbari strategy was to neutralize the space-faring military threat as they 'marched' towards Earth, then mop up the ground forces and civilian populations on the way back out, so the battle of the line really was the final meaningful defensive point as all other military assets had been eliminated. This means that, while there were some ground operations (probably to destroy supply lines), most of the fighting was done in space, ship to ship.  Considering this, a more accurate comparison to World War 2 would be to look at just The Navy's casualty count, which is around 35,000. Naval warfare isn't anything like ground combat in terms of casualties. Ships have very low crew counts compared to, say, an armored regiment. So 250,000 is a whole lot of ships blown out of space... and once you've lost space, you've lost the war/race because no number of ground forces can provide an effective defense against orbital bombardment."

babylon5,1ta07q,boring_name_here,6,Thu Dec 19 22:33:34 2013 UTC,"For the sake of comparison, the current US Navy operates 283 ships on active duty (according to wikipedia). Now, I don't remember if it's explicitly stated, but it is rather strongly implied that the Minbari just about completely wiped out EarthForce's fleet. If all of the US Navy's ships were crewed with around 1,000 sailors, a full wipe of just the fleet, without any additional casualties to civilian populations, could easily accommodate the casualty number listed in ""And now for a word"".  However, I'm right there with you in thinking this number seems WAY low.  One of the many great things about Babylon 5 was the way in which they tried to get scale right. The station was massive. The Great Machine was appropriately named. The timescales of the back story were geological. Which means all the ships that we see pulled up to the station are also MASSIVE. The Nova class that, we have to assume, preceded the Omega class as the front line warship in EarthForce service, was like, 1,500 meters long by some estimates? For a real world comparison, the Nimitz class aircraft carriers of the US Navy (the largest warship in service in any navy, I think), is only 333 meters long, roughly 1/5 the length of the Nova, but carries over 6,000 personnel. Now, the replacement for the Nimitz, the Ford class, is touted as having much more automation, which means it needs fewer crew. But even it will need in excess of over 4,000 people to man it. So to realistically reach the 250,000 mark, the Earth fleet was either  -comprised of a VERY small number of ships that were manned with crews sized proportionately to warships we currently know (i.e., if a modern warship needs 5,000 people, a ship five times as large must need about 5 times as many crewmen). Or  -comprised of a larger number of ships with INCREDIBLY small crews. Like, each of these ships, which are almost all larger than the current tallest building in the world (Burj Khalifa ~830m, Nova~1,500m, Hyperion generally listed at ~1,000m, only the Olympus class is considered ""small"" and it's estimated at being ~445m, though there's very little screen evidence to support that one), which in turn is more than twice as tall as the world's largest warship is long, all of them have crews in the couple hundreds. Which strikes me as genuinely absurd. I mean, I'm sure the 23rd century has some great automation, but can it really be THAT great?  Either option seems pretty silly to me. The smallest one, the Olympus, is more than a football field longer than a supercarrier! The second largest looks like it's only habitable from about the mid point on, but that means it's still roughly 2 football fields longer than a modern day supercarrier! The idea that these giant fuck-off warships have a smaller crew than the senior class of a lot of high schools is ridiculous. And while the other option (EarthForce has kind of a small fleet, but each ship has a more realistic (to my eyes) crew size) seems plausible given the way that 30 Omegas in orbit around Mars in season 4 were deemed a big threat that needed to be eliminated with some WAY outside the fucking box thinking, the stated estimate still seems pretty low.  Consider: If it's the ""Small fleet with giant ships with proportionate crews"" scenario, what's with the insane blow to the human psyche? I mean, America went kind of crazy after 9/11, but I would hope that 200 years from now we would be smart enough to say, ""You know what? We did put all of our eggs in, like, 100 baskets, which is not that many baskets, navally speaking, and it's not that surprising that all our eggs got cracked by ethereal alien space ships that totally look like betta fish."" And while the other scenario, with the larger fleet, could reasonably drive a proud race mad with shame, I still just don't buy it. The casualties the Earth Alliance suffered are a little more than half of what the US suffered in World War II. That's the Earth Alliance, with almost the entire planet folded in under it's umbrella, and numerous off world colonies, whose total population must be in the billions. Stacked against that, 250,000 just seems low, and nowhere near high enough to account for the effect we see on Earth society, with the fairly rapid abandonment of democratic principles in favor of the comfort of fascism.  Although, the 9/11 comparison is very compelling.  That's about all I have. I just want to take this time to mention that I recently re-watched the series and only just the other week realized that the badge on the breast of every EARTH ALLIANCE officer was a stylized ""E"" over an ""A"". I've been watching the show since 1993. I'm not a smart man."
babylon5,1ta07q,Topazornottopaz,4,Fri Dec 20 01:46:46 2013 UTC,"Regarding the omega class in orbit around mars, somebody stated that there were 30,000 souls total over those thirty ships, and using the mentioned extreme measures resulted in 30 deaths to save 30,000. So each omega has 1000 crew compliment a piece. Apply that to the scale for the rest of the alliance fleet.  Would give sources, but phone etc etc"
babylon5,1ta07q,boring_name_here,2,Fri Dec 20 03:03:31 2013 UTC,"I had forgotten about that. I don't remember the exact episode, but that sounds right. And 1,000 people for a ship that was longer (supposedly) than even the Nova class seems kind of odd. For a TV SF contemporary to B5, the Enterprise-D from TNG had about a thousand people on it, and was only half as long, if that, and with what looked like a much less voluminous design."
babylon5,1ta07q,Topazornottopaz,2,Fri Dec 20 03:20:38 2013 UTC,"I think it's a bit different scale for engine and generator capacity. Example, a ship the size of the white star wouldn't normally have a jump engine. I think human jump engines are very large, compared to Minbari and Centauri ships. That surely accounts for a lot of volume in the ship.   Same goes for generators, the only generator we saw was on B4 during WWE, and in season two when the psycho bombing maintenance guy was there. The generators and the surrounding areas were huge. True they powered a whole space station, but tiny they were not. And iirc, there were multiple generators in both stations"
babylon5,1ta07q,AcidOphidian,1 point,Fri Dec 20 03:28:25 2013 UTC,"It's certainly plausible, but with something like the Nova, if even half the length of the ship is taken up by reactor/engines, etc., that still leaves a about 750m worth of ship. It's not that they couldn't get the crew size down, but it seems silly that they would get it THAT far down. Especially for the Omegas, where each ""end"" of the rotating hab section looks like it masses as much as a modern day carrier. That's just eye-balling it, of course, but it's enough to reinforce the impression that I always got that these ships have almost no one in them, for their supposed size. Or more likely this is one area where JMS and crew dropped the ball and couldn't make this corner of their vision match the scope of the rest.  Not that I'm complaining, mind you. Best show ever."

babylon5,1ta07q,techie1980,2,Thu Dec 19 22:08:17 2013 UTC,I agree that the number is low for how epic they tried to make the war seem. In 'reality' however I think a war fought primarily in space probably would have relatively few casualties given how few people you would want in ships.  As I recall earth's colonies were still very new and probably quite small. the Minbari bypassed most of the older colonies at the eleventh hour to go straight for earth which means civilian casualties probably would have been few and far in between.  All in all I think a bigger number probably would have fit the narrative more it's big enough that I didn't stop to think about it at the time.
babylon5,1ta07q,brbATF,2,Thu Dec 19 22:11:08 2013 UTC,"I always wondered the same thing -- as well as how they produced that many ships AFTER the war + built at least 5 large space stations. There's a comment made during ""In the Beginning"" that the Earth currency essentially collapses. It seems like it should take more than a few years to recover from that.   I wonder if it would have made more sense to have set babylon 5 20 years after the Earth Minbar war."
babylon5,1ta07q,SirJiggart,8,Thu Dec 19 23:10:38 2013 UTC,"It's all a matter of priorities... They didn't need to buy anything from other races to build all those ships or the five babylon stations, remember the Minbari left most of their non-military infrastructure intact, choosing to go for the quick kill (and then halting short) rather than systematic annihilation as they went. Earth had access to all the materials and equipment it needed to rebuild as quickly as the ""never again"" philosophy could drive them."

babylon5,1skyuc,flitterio,6,Tue Dec 10 22:07:14 2013 UTC,"So, I broke out my copy of the B5 scripts.  When Sheridan disappears the first time and goes forward to Centauri Prime, he briefly returns to the present where he loses his stabilizer.  Zathras takes the stabilizer to repair it and sets up the suit.  He tells Marcus and Ivanova that the suit's power should help stabilize him temporarily.  Sheridan disappears again after B4's time jump but later reappears and falls unconscious, where Delenn finds him.  Offscreen, Delenn gives Sheridan her stabilizer and takes the suit whereupon she becomes unstuck in time.  She appears and disappears throughout the station until Zathras finally hands her the repaired stabilizer before she vanishes one last time and reappears at the White Star."
babylon5,1skyuc,Stile4aly,3,Wed Dec 11 05:08:22 2013 UTC,"She took Sheridan's broken stabilizer and put on the suit, essentially to save Sheridan by sacrificing herself because of the time shifting.  At least, that's how I interpreted/remember it."
babylon5,1skyuc,beonarri,2,Wed Dec 11 03:44:44 2013 UTC,"I just watched both episodes. Zathras clearly hands the repaired stabilizer to Sheridan before the beam falls on him (Zathras). Later, when Sheridan is (no longer in the spacesuit) found by Markus, he says the stabilizer has no damage, so someone must have switched theirs with his. Earlier, we see Delenn climb up through the hull breach created by the White Star and witness Sheridan reappear in his spacesuit. I assume she switched the stabilizers and took the suit before Markus found Sheridan. But why put on a spacesuit just to go rescue Zathras from the fallen beam. She was never outside the station. It really looks like JMS had more planned for the episode and had to leave something on the cutting room floor."
babylon5,1skyuc,thegenregeek,7,Wed Dec 11 04:12:41 2013 UTC,"It really looks like JMS had more planned for the episode and had to leave something on the cutting room floor.   Honestly I think its more a hold over from when the original plan was (probably) going to have only Sinclair in the suit. But since Michael O'Hare had left the show it was easier to switch in Sheridan and Delenn in order to give the impression that things were more thought out than they were. As well as a perfect set up for Anna's return and Londo's future.   In the original concept for the series, before Michael O'Hare left and JMS completely rethought his plan (so Season 1-ish), the events on B4 were to be addressed/answered in the last episode of the series. Sinclair was going to steal Babylon 4 along with Delenn. In order to fight the Shadows, following the destruction of Babylon 5. All in a future set spinoff called Babylon Prime. Where  B4 would be acting as the a base/ship traveling around the galaxy during the proper, actual Shadow War.  So if you just watch Babylon Squared and think from that perspective, every time we see the guy in the suit it's supposed to be Sinclair going through the motions of keeping events on track. (As he stated at the very end during the reveal in Babylon Squared to, presumably, Delenn ""It happened just as I remember""). With Zathras recognizing Sinclair when he was saved from the beam. Why Sinclair was thrown like a rag doll when touching the man in the suit (the same matter cannot occupy the same space time...). Why everything indicates B4 going into the future.  With the series rethink, and wrap up of the B4 question moved to Season 3, JMS probably figured it was better to twist things a bit to surprise the audience. That and to touch on future events to give them more meaning ( I mean JMS looovvveessss his Chekhov's Gun ). This is why they suddenly introduce the idea of ""The One"" being 3 different people. Why Delenn was suddenly ""The One"" to save Zathras (and not Sinclair or Sheridan). Why both Sheridan and Delenn were magically put in a position where they could/would jump around in time. (Instead of only one of them.) Why Garibaldi wasn't able to go along (Remember in Babylon Squared when Sinclair saw Garibaldi die in a future battle?). Why nobody else got thrown when touching another in the space suit.  It wasn't so much that it was really thought out and had to leave more out, it was a bit of hand waving to get the viewer to move past it. Because by that point JMS had written himself into a corner with Sinclair, his taking of Babylon 4, and the negative effects of the time jumps on his body.  Those were ultimately plot elements intended for a different series. One that stop existing after Season 1.  So ingeniously JMS used it as a final trapdoor for Sinclair and the Babylon 5 story that never was."

babylon5,1saxf5,uriman,20,Sat Dec 7 06:39:54 2013 UTC,"To your main question, because those events weren't what the series was about. The main series was about the Shadow War and the formation of the Alliance. The events you're talking about were supposed to be addressed in other media, like books and spinoffs.  Unfortunately the spinoffs didn't succeed. So we don't get to see them addressed on screen. But they were in the books in various fashion.  From onscreen:  1) We know what happened to Londo's Keeper Gift. It activated and lured David Sheridan to Centauri Prime. John Sheridan went there to save him, was captured, then freed by Emporer Mollari before he was killed by G'kar. (Remember in War Without End when Future Delenn said ""David is fine, our son is safe""?)  2) G'kar and Leeta traveled for a bit before splitting up. G'kar ended up facing the Hand during a diplomatic mission with members of the Alliance (Legend of the Rangers).   From the books (which are considered canon):  Leeta ended up returning to Garibaldi (which she mentioned in the last episode she was in) where she used the slush fund he was building to start an open civil war against the Psi Corp (The actual Telepath War). Eventually culminating in a suicide bombing of Psi Corp headquarters that destroyed the leadership of the Corp ( and which claimed the life of Lennier and Leeta ). Just prior to this Garibaldi's ""Asimovs"" were lifted by Leeta and he spent a number of years tracking down Bester who was wanted by EarthGov after he had escaped ass a wanted fugitive. Once Bester was captured he was placed on sleepers with a life sentence for his actions in the Psi Corp's attempted coup of EarthGov.   Now it should be pointed out the Leeta, Bester, Garibaldi details were going to be explained in Crusade (onscreen). One episode they filmed for Crusade was originally written to have Leeta being held prisoner by Lieutenant John Matheson. It was changed just before filming when they couldn't get Patrica Tallman back into a generic rogue telepath. Another episode, which they had written but couldn't film (since the series plug was pulled) would have had Bester come back as a fugitive. (I believe he was supposed to be a recurring character)  Like wise the Drahk weren't really defeated until Sheridan and the Alliance found out they were on Centauri Prime. They were ultimately defeated when Vir Cotto lead a resistance against them. This happened after Londo Mollari's death at the hands of G'kar. (Onscreen it's presented as Vir picking up the Emperors crest and with Zack Allan as a ranger alongside Emperor Cotto, Sleeping in Light.  In books by Armies of Light and Darknesss )"
babylon5,1saxf5,thegenregeek,2,Sat Dec 7 07:43:13 2013 UTC,"I just had a feeling that there was a lot of room for another plot arc. I think I read somewhere that because WB threatened to cancel repeatedly the shadow war wasn't as flushed out as it could have been. Also, it's claimed that is why the finale battle of the shadow war ended early mid season. Londo's fate is almost a tragedy and I missed him in the finale.   The show sometimes gets frustrating by mentioning events or foreshadowing events and then not showing them. Small things like the death of Londo's gf to the caste war to Linnear's betray against the rangers."
babylon5,1saxf5,thegenregeek,10,Sat Dec 7 08:19:08 2013 UTC,"I see.  They did push up the end of Shadow War to Season 4, but not necessarily because Warner Bros was threatening to cancel.  What happened was the Prime Time Entertainment Network, home of B5 was dismantled and became part of UPN. Because of that there was literally no network left for B5 to run on as it had just stopped right near the end of season 4. (As a personal story I missed the last 4 episodes of season 4 when they first aired because my local channel just stopped showing the series. I had to wait nearly a year before TNT aired them)  WB eventually found a home on TNT, but only after the 4th Season had ended.  Because of this J Michael Straczynski went into the start of the 4th season expecting not to get a 5th. Not due to ratings but market changes. So he wrapped up what he considered the necessary core elements of the show then. (For example technically the series finale, Sleeping in Light, was part of Season 4. When they got Season 5 they quickly shot a new season 4 finale and moved Sleeping in Light into season 5)  At literally the last possible second they got that final season and a spinoff. So JMS wrote season 5 to close out a l couple of things he'd left out of Season 4, due to time. But with a plan to introduce stuff they could handle in the spinoff. (Had they had the full series run there probably wouldn't have been the Telepath arc and the Fall of Centauri Prime would have been condensed a bit.)  Then TNT turned out to be bastards who sabotaged Crusade because of network politics."
babylon5,1saxf5,blackbook90,2,Sat Dec 7 08:30:40 2013 UTC,I thought for ages that Babylon 5 ended with season 4 because the Sci Fi channel just stopped showing it and obviously the nature of the s4 finale. Then maybe 2 years later I put on the Channel 4 and what do I see Delenn about to  die with Londo begging for her life. I just starred at the screen thinking I must be dreaming a new episode. I did regularly dream about new episodes as a kid. So glad I'm an adult not limited to half an hour of dial up a day now.
babylon5,1saxf5,DarrenGrey,8,Wed Dec 11 22:30:46 2013 UTC,"Not all questions have to be answered, no story truly comes to an end.  For me one of the things I loved about B5 is the sense that it is one part of a greater story, a glimpse into one place and time in a wide universe. There are so many unanswered questions about the previous Shadow wars, the history between the Centauri and the Narn, the Earth-Minbari war, the Dilgar war, and so on. And at the same time so much we don't know about what happens to all the characters and factions in the future. There are plenty of hints, but never the full story.  And that's great! It makes the universe believable. It makes the mind dwell on these things and imagine what the full story can be.  A truly great piece of fiction doesn't just tell you a good story, it triggers your imagination to think of countless other tales."
babylon5,1saxf5,Topazornottopaz,2,Sat Dec 7 15:08:45 2013 UTC,"It helps to keep in mind that JMS wanted a 5 year story for B5. To adequately address all the ancillary issues would likely have required 6 or maybe even 7 seasons, and he was focused on doing justice to the story of the Shadow War, the departure of the First Ones, and Clark's experiment with fascism in a comparatively concise 5 year time frame meant that some story would get bumped. The plot threads that weren't resolved in B5 were meant to be resolved in Crusade, or other media which, to our everlasting fury, were hamstrung by studio politics or the arcana of finance. The good bye episodes were there because, for those characters, their time in the spotlight was over."

babylon5,1s6um1,Colonel_Green,13,Thu Dec 5 21:33:37 2013 UTC,"Keep in mind there is a near 20 year gap between that moment (when Sheridan learns about the keeper on Londo) and when Londo starts acting ""weird"". Future Delenn herself specifically states she never really believed Sheridan's story until that moment. So only Sheridan really would have that insight and believe it a factor.  However, the future John saw lacked the context we the viewer got from multiple sources through the run of the show. All Sheridan knew is that at some point during those 20 years some allies of the Shadows would return to Centauri Prime. Also that Centauri Prime would pay a price when Sheridan's allies failed to stop them at some point during that 20 year period. For all he knew those future events Londo was talking about occurred a year before he was captured in the future. By the time Centauri Prime has fallen it's too late for Sheridan to do anything about it.    Unfortunately this puts Sheridan in the situation where he knew enough that he could ask questions. But had no way of getting answers, until events played out as they were supposed to. Furthermore it introduced the possibility that he's be asking the right questions too soon, at the wrong time.  So Londo acting ""weird"" isn't inherently a sign, to John, of that future occurring then. Only that the future was now locked in place. He had to assume Londo was just being Londo, putting on a show as Emperor. When he meets Londo again, and Londo gives him the urn with Keeper Sheridan wouldn't have thought much of it as it just would re-enforce the idea that it was all a show.  The whole point of War Without End is that we learned time is immutable. It is nearly impossible to alter events. Even if you know what's coming you're stuck living it."

babylon5,1s6um1,cyberleadr,2,Sat Dec 14 21:37:38 2013 UTC,"Perhaps I should clarify by ""time"", I meant more in the sense of ""time travel"". Babylon 5 clearly used a Deterministic Model of temporal mechanics. Meaning anything you do, with regards to time (travel), lends itself to a predestination paradox. Once you are in that paradox there is no way to get out of it, until events presented within it are complete. Call it destiny, fate, or whatever. You have free will, but cannot necessarily break those events. Because they are fundamental forces of the universe.  While you are right that there is a theme of one man making a difference, there are also very clear signs that events will always play out as they are supposed to. The entire series of events of Babylon 5 are driven by a predestination paradox. Namely the events that occurred on Babylon 4.  Think about it, the Minbari prophecy, that wasn't a seer peering into the future. It was Valen/Sinclair telling about the future he lived to both the Minbari and Vorlons. Which ultimately guided events into the future so they happened as they always were supposed to. Inevitably to the time when he traveled back using B4 and restarted the whole cycle (Hence the title ""War Without End""). In that moment both Delenn and Sheridan were caught up in the final part of the predestination paradox. Mini paradoxes created by seeing a small glimpse of the future (for Delenn the near present and Sheridan the future). The last ripples from Sinclair's actions in an endless cycle of cause and effect. (This is why all three are The One. Because they were at the center of these events, due to time travel).  That is what the Seer meant by ""some things that must be and some things that may be"".   If it is related to time travel in the B5 universe, no matter what you do (except for the choice to steal B4 or not) events will play out as they were supposed to. (But if they didn't steal B4 then everything would have changed too much to be recognizable. So they were kind of forced to make the correct decision.)  Like the Lady Morella said, ""you will be Emperor one day, that part of you destiny cannot be changed"". She, through her gift, could see flashes of the paradox. To the last moment where the paradox was relevant, when Londo met his fate. In that moment his choice was to decide who he wanted to be, a cowardly monster dying at the hands of a life long enemy denying his role or a tragic hero who willing sacrificed himself for his friends and his people. All knowing it would destroy him and redeem himself so he could avoid the fire (IE hell) that awaited him at the end of his journey (IE life)."
babylon5,1s6um1,thegenregeek,1 point,Sat Dec 14 23:04:34 2013 UTC,"Perhaps, but my counter argument is that surely, if this was the case, the shadows would know it to be true.  Therefore why would they risk resources and exposure trying to destroy B4 when they knew that it survived to travel back in time.  Just because everything we saw worked out the same way it had in the future, it doesn't mean it always would."
babylon5,1s6um1,cyberleadr,1 point,Sat Dec 14 23:54:51 2013 UTC,"You assume the Shadows are more powerful than they presented themselves to be. Like the Vorlons, they were as flawed as any other race. Just older, with more technology.  Ultimately,the Shadows didn't really know they would be defeated. Nor did the Vorlons. They thought it was all a game that would continue as it always had.  Remember, as Delenn said (during her Trial in season 4), Valen only knew what Sinclair knew. Which basically meant that the Vorlons only knew (or been informed) as to what would happen up until Sinclair stole Babylon 4 (so they wouldn't have known about the attack on Z'Ha'Dum, Lorien resurrecting Sheridan, nor of the younger races rebellion) . Their information on the future would have come from Sinclair and, presumably, only him up to a point in the next war.  This gave the Vorlons a belief in their convictions of the rightness of their actions to that point. (after all it was predetermined)  The Shadows on the other hand didn't have that information. They knew at one point in the past they were defeated by use of a station of unknown origins the Minbari had in the last days of the war. Then one day, a thousand years later, that same station was being built by humans along with aid from the Minbari. They may not have known how it got back in time, only that at some point it did. (Maybe they thought the Minbari had the technology, or maybe the Vorlons)  So they preemptively tried to destroy it, once they realized what it was, possibly because they were not aware of the immutability of time (or at least the paradox). Because of the deterministic nature of time travel (as presented) they were ultimately stopped by the paradox when the crew showed up at the same time. By that point events were on track for everything to happen as it should. Because it was immutable.  Let me put it this way, why does Kosh get so upset at Sheridan's request for a Vorlon counter attack, then tell him he won't be around and respond to Sheridan ""You do not understand"" regarding the price?   On the surface it's because it appears that he probably figures the Shadows will kill him in retaliation. I would argue it's because he knows the Shadows will kill him in retaliation. Because Sinclair/Valen told him. Likewise, this is why Kosh appears at certain key points to drive events along and ignores other events outright. Because Sinclair/Valen told him much of what would happen. And Kosh was playing the part, doing what he knew he was supposed to do.  He knew the Narn homeworld was going to fall. He knew he'd have to reveal himself to save John Sheridan.  He knew Santiago's assassination would lead to new commander, John Sheridan. He knew who Delenn was and that he had to be there to guide her to keep the Minbari from destroying Earth. He knew Dukat was going to die, starting the Earth Minbari War. He knew that Earth would become a major power during the Dilgar Wars. He knew of all of these events because he was told by a man who lived it (or as Ranger One had spent years collecting information on it).  What he didn't know, because Sinclair/Valen wasn't there to see it, is how it would end. So, like the Shadows, he probably figured the system/cycles would continue forever, with each iteration ending in fire and destruction and rebuilding. Though for at least this iteration of the war events had been predetermined.  Once the B4 paradox was resolved (with the death of Londo) then events might have become fluid again. By that point it wouldn't matter. The Vorlon's wouldn't be around to see it.  Ultimately I would say the use of time travel in B5 is a rather smart bit of writing. Most time travel series use a fluid view of time. Which means time travel is a get out of jail free option.  If a character can travel in time they always tend to have the option of undoing things. B5 is one of the only shows to flip that, wherein time travel can't really change anything."
babylon5,1s6um1,thegenregeek,1 point,Sun Dec 15 01:39:31 2013 UTC,"Again I have to disagree.  Certainly the Shadows and Vorlons are flawed, but they do have a great deal of knowledge and it would be highly unlikely that their knowledge bases do not include at least a rudimentary knowledge of how ""time"" works.  Additionally they have had untold millennia to improve their strategy and tactics so it again seems unlikely that the Shadows would risk exposing themselves, when they have been so careful up to this point, on a mission they know must not succeed if your interpretation is correct.  It is a different matter for a single individual such as Kosh to try to change things, as all living beings have a tendency to fight the inevitable in order to live longer.  The Shadow race as a whole, or at least those responsible for making strategic military decisions, would not make the same mistake.  I would argue however that Kosh's actions and the Shadows do make sense if they both know that destinies can be changed.  Even knowing that changing the timeline is difficult and uncertain, it would be worth the risks for the Shadows to try to change things, and Kosh would only have to postpone things until after Sinclair has left to make his outcome uncertain.  I agree that B5 is one of the best written shows of all time, but if time is not at least somewhat fluid than it would not be worth writing about at all.  There must be risk, the potential to fail or the story is meaningless and the audience would not emotionally care."

I think you're missing part of my argument. It's not a matter of not knowing how ""time"" (travel) works. It's a matter of not knowing the full details of the paradox.   The Vorlon's knew parts of it, what Sinclair told them. As such the paradox would have appeared beneficial to them and their goals. After all the paradox basically stated they'd win the last war and pretty much rule the galaxy their way for at least 1000 years. It also gave them a heads up about what they needed to do to prepare for the next iteration of the war. To stop keep the Shadows at bay for another thousand.  So the Vorlon's, being arrogant (highlighted in various examples), would have seen it as their destiny to be the victors. (This is my theory as to why Anna Sheridan stated that something changed and Vorlon's decided their way was the right way)  The Shadows may have had no idea that Sinclair was Valen (if they did they would probably have tried to kill him). So they wouldn't have had no idea that he would have gone back in time, using the knowledge he gained from studying the history, to force events along. As I was saying they merely knew about the station and that it would go into the past.  They wouldn't have necessarily had the full details of the paradox. So they thought if they destroyed the station it would resolve itself. They had no way of knowing that a white star would show up, at that moment, from the future to stop them.   Additionally they have had untold millennia to improve their strategy and tactics so it again seems unlikely that the Shadows would risk exposing themselves, when they have been so careful up to this point, on a mission they know must not succeed if your interpretation is correct.   The show establishes the whole Shadow War wasn't arbitrary. Also that the Shadows and Vorlons only thought they were unstoppable. Destined to win at their ideological debate at some point.  Both the Shadows and the Vorlons effectively used the same tactics for thousands of years. They'd reached an evolutionary plateau where they couldn't develop further (or at least thought they couldn't). That's the entire point of the Shadow/Vorlon conflict, finding ways to allow new civilizations to evolve. By clearing out the older generations standing in the way after their time was up. The Vorlons argued thoughtful control and reduction (ordered dismantlement). The Shadows argued natural selection (chaotic warfare).  Lorien specifically points out that the Shadows would always return to Z'ha'Dum, because they thought it showed reverence for him. For a species "" they have had untold millennia to improve their strategy and tactics"" that seems contradictory.   ...but if time is not at least somewhat fluid than it would not be worth writing about at all.   Again, my point is that time isn't fluid due to the paradox. Outside of the paradox, sure nothing is written maybe it's fluid. We don't really know. But inside of the paradox certain things have to happen to maintain the paradox. The entire show occurs inside the paradox. So, for the show time is immutable.   There must be risk, the potential to fail or the story is meaningless and the audience would not emotionally care.   Not at all. There is a quantum view of reality and a personal relativistic point of view. At the quantum view it doesn't matter because the characters will do what keep the universe (or story) going. At the personal view the characters choices matter.  Put another way, every choice you make is leading to your death. Does that mean your free will doesn't exist? At a quantum level no, we are all the byproduct of the universe's entropy. Matter going through the motions. What will happen will happen. Nothing we can do to change that.  The thing is we exist within our universe. So from our perspective everything matters. We cannot see beyond our horizon, though we can imagine it. So the choices we make do matter from our perspective and experience.  It's the same with the characters.  We, as the viewer, get to exist outside of the universe and see all the pieces the characters don't. We get to discover what happens as they do. How it impacts them and what they have to go through as a result. And in the end we get to learn from that and determine what meaning it holds for us."

To which she said she didn't truly believed it until that moment.  But by that point there wasn't a lot they could do about it. Since what had happened happened. Though in the books its explained with proof the Drakh has taken hold of Centauri Prime Emperor Vir Cotto was able to force them off.

The Hidden Evolution of Babylon 5  The Hidden Evolution of Babylon 5 pt. 2  Original Babylon 5 arc  The first season is pretty interesting to watch now with all of this stuff in mind. Pieces of it still seem to be in place by that season's end. I'm inclined to agree with the people in those links that had Sinclair stayed, the show might've ended with War Without End.

They should be on the sidebar really, there's such great repositories of information :) But bloody hell, how different those original plans were...  One thing I've seen JMS mention in interviews is that he had ""trap-doors"" for every character. In case any actor had to leave he had a back-up story that he could use to pull them out of the show. Talia got one of those laid on her. I'm really curious what trapdoors they would have had for other characters..."
babylon5,1rvsmv,DarrenGrey,5,Mon Dec 2 11:34:15 2013 UTC,"I'm really curious what trapdoors they would have had for other characters...   He technically used the trap doors a couple of times. Though the trap doors were not inherently fully planned story outs. (Some trapdoors were closer to back up plans of how to swap out the character at a moments notice. Others were simply plans of how they would get rid of a character, while moving the story along.). The idea behind the trapdoors were to keep the story moving along, without needing to change things too drastically because an actor had suddenly left.  As he mentioned in the B5 scripts (which I have), over time it became less of an issue. So a lot of the trapdoors were mainly in the beginning and only worked based on where the characters were at the start. By the time they got to the point where they might have needed the trapdoors it was less of an issue.  To your point, Talia was a trapdoor. She had replaced Lyta from The Gathering. It just so happened when it came time for her to leave JMS was able to get Patricia Tallman back. So Lyta became a trapdoor to replace her original trapdoor, Talia.  As I recall the plan they had for Talia involved the VCR (or Viker) Abbut who scanned her mind during a Kosh business meeting in Season 1. Talia was supposed to go evil due to the Psi Corp reprogramming and turn against the station crew. This would have played up the Psi Corp / Shadow infiltration story line more and acted as a trapdoor for plot elements reused from Laurel Takashima (below).  If she hadn't left the show, eventually Garabaldi was going to use the VCR recording of her mind to restore her personality. Then she was going to be the ""nuclear option telepath"" character that Lyta ended up being towards season 5, presumably using the powers she'd gained from Jason Ironheart in Season 1 (and NOT the Vorlons).  Likewise they were supposed to move towards a relationship with Garibaldi. But eventually, as she was gone, they (sort of) switched the planned relationship storyline towards Zack and Lyta.  I suspect the idea was Garabaldi would have a thing for Talia, but she wasn't going to play for that team. So, like Zack towards the end of Season 5, Garibaldi would be silently watching her while sticking to the job.   Laurel Takeshima was supposed to be a double agent, specifically a victim of Psi Corp mind control program (which later went to Talia. Presumably due her leaving after The Gathering and to the series rethink after season 1). She was supposed to be the one who shot Garibaldi in the back, not his aide. In The Gathering, for example, its implied she provided security credentials to the Minbari assassin who attacked Kosh. So her trapdoor, if she'd stayed with the series beyond The Gathering but wanted to leave after season 1, was to disappear much like Garibaldi's aide did. Get caught, then shipped off. If she wanted to stay she'd have been restored (probably by Garibaldi). From there she could be reassigned at any time and replaced.  Since she left after The Gathering, Ivanova became the replacement character for Takashima. She was effectively Sinclair/Sheridan's aide (to replace them). Who could have been replaced herself due to bureaucratic reshuffling. (or possibly her telepathic status would have disqualified her for service and she'd be taken in by the Psi Corp)  In the case of Garibaldi, an alcoholic relapse would have been his out. One of his aides would have taken over and he'd be forced to leave in disgrace. Originally this could have been the aide that shot him. Then Lou Welsh. Finally Zack Allan. (Of course if they couldn't get Garibaldi's actor back for season 2, he probably would have just died)  Franklin's trapdoor, as I recall, was actually played out and recycled. The idea was his stim addiction would force him to leave because he'd become a liability (similar to Garibaldi). If they needed to drop him they'd have him leave and just replace him with one of his aides. But by the time the show was that far along JMS knew Richard Biggs wasn't likely to up and leave and chose to use it as a storyline. (Franklin was also a trapdoor, who had replaced Dr Kyle. If Dr Kyle hadn't left he too could have had the stim problem, presumably brought on in relation to the events of Gathering and seeing inside Kosh's encounter suit)  Likewise Na'Toth, Lennier and Vir were all trapdoor replacements for their respective ambassadors. If any of the actors playing the main ambassadors wanted to leave the aides would be able to jump in and explain the situation as normal bureaucratic reshuffling. Then events would have preceded similar to what we saw, using the aides. If any actors playing the aides wanted to leave, they would get replaced with new aides (or like they did with Na'Toth, replace the the actor but keep the character).  In the case of the main ambassadors it would have been something like the following. Londo would have been appointed to the Royal Court (where he'd eventually become Emperor).  G'kar would have died during the bombing of the Narn homeworld. Delenn would have rejoined the Grey Council to prepare to fight the shadows. (Presumably the whole child story line mentioned in the linked articles could have shifted Sinclair's child to Cathrine Sakai, just tweaked a little so the child was covered in prophecy but human only.)   Lt Keffer's trapdoor was dying in a random mission. (Which was used and pretty obviously an easy out).  Of course Keffer was really just a character the network forced JMS to use. He was added because the network felt the show ""needed something for the ladies"". JMS despised the character and used the trapdoor the second he could. He then tied that in with the Shadow vessel recording.  There were no trapdoor plans for Kosh, given he wasn't played by any actor.  Marcus didn't really have a trapdoor as I recall. He has an arc, which they pretty much used as planned. (Though they invented a trapdoor for Ivanova given they couldn't get Claudia Christian back)  Finally, and to put it in context, the TV market for B5 was way different than it tends to be today. For the most part original syndicated shows are kind of rare now, especially original syndicated scifi shows. So things like multi-year contracts weren't as common as they are now. A lot of the plans were based on the expectation that contracts might be renewed midway through the show (or at the end of even the first season). Since syndication was less desirable for actors of the day, JMS didn't want to risk anyone jumping to network TV. So he planned trap doors around that, just in case any actors or network executives tried to mess with things..  Nowadays most shows tend to be made by networks (broadcast or cable), who are willing to sign longer term deals to keep talent around. So there's less of a chance of some actor suddenly walking away because they don't want to keep doing it."

babylon5,1rpls7,Exterus,12,Fri Nov 29 14:39:26 2013 UTC,"I think that over time the galaxy would slowly change into an image of the respective sides' philosophies, becoming all the more distilled and extreme as time passes.   A Vorlon galaxy would slowly turned into a stifled, autocratic place with the Vorlons running the governments of the various species in the background through manipulation and, I think, fear. Suffocating order and obediance on a galactic scale. In time the galaxy would look like North Korea.  The Shadow galaxy would be a war zone. Their notions of strength through conflict would set all the races and factions against each other. Imagine the worst moment of the last shadow war only multiplied by a factor of ten, since there wouldn't be a Vorlon presence to balance it out. Over time it's possible some faction will prevail and gain a measure of dominance over the others, at which point the Shadows would step in and stir things up again, starting everything over again.  Since the Shadows were the yin and the Vorlons the yang, there would be a severe imbalance. Either race is not meant to function without the other as a balancing force. In essence, shit would fall apart."
babylon5,1rpls7,brbATF,10,Fri Nov 29 16:26:52 2013 UTC,"I have to disagree about the Shadow outcome. The Shadows weren't waging war for the sake of waging war, they were waging war for the sake of an impetus to more rapid development - and they understood that evolutionary development (both biological and technological) requires extended periods of peace between major conflicts.  I think they would've been withdrawing to let the rest of the galaxy do its own thing for a thousand years between each major assault whether they were beaten or not"
babylon5,1rpls7,Exterus,3,Fri Nov 29 19:26:45 2013 UTC,Perhaps you're right. But I'm not so sure they would keep to their schedule if the Vorlons weren't out there to oppose them.
babylon5,1rpls7,brbATF,1 point,Fri Nov 29 19:35:01 2013 UTC,"I imagine you're right about that! I see two scenarios, but without an insectoid brain (or JMS's creativity) I'm having trouble putting odds on either one: 1) The shadows come out every couple hundred years to 'kick over all the ant hills' as Morden put it, or 2) They no longer need to directly interfere at all because the Vorlon's artificial peace no longer needs to be overcome.  Given the external threats we saw in Thirdspace and Legend of the Rangers, I actually think the Shadows forcing the other races to adapt militarily to a superior enemy was probably the best possible way to prepare them for what lies beyond the known galaxy"
babylon5,1rpls7,mrwoolery,5,Sat Nov 30 03:58:06 2013 UTC,"If the Vorlons won, we'd have seen the galaxy continue as it was...after all, that's what happened 1,000 years ago.  In it's known iteration it was already being heavily influenced by the Vorlon.  The cycle would continue...  If the Shadows won, we'd see pretty much the same sort of thing, with different philosophies based on Shadow precepts of strength and adaptation to occur.  I suspect things on a larger, galactic scale would seem eerily familiar (at least from an Earther's point of view)...more ""dog eat dog"" and amoral laissez faire things going on (basically the darker side of humanity coming to the fore).  You have to remember that humans were straddling the light and the dark in this war--we would've pretty much stayed very powerful and ""natural"" to ourselves regardless of which side won."

So I suspect regardless of which side won things would have simply gone back to however things were before... MAYBE the ""winning"" side works behind the scenes to implement their style of teaching, but I doubt that even. It's also very possible that both sides may have just left like the rest of the First Ones... I think of it this way: it was always actually about the disagreement, not really helping the younger races, and this is supported by how quickly and easily (relatively) they left after Coriana 6... once the argument is settled what's the point of continuing to help the younger races, or even of sticking around? I don't think there is a point for either race anymore so they just step back or leave entirely is my guess."

Still, did you really not like any of season 1?  Season 2 picks up really well about halfway through, when it becomes clear that they are weaving a series of long plot arcs together. In particular there is a two-parter episode that will make you go ""wow"". Still, it has a few stale episodes early on in the season.  Seasons 3 and 4 are non-stop amazing. It will reach heights you've never seen sci-fi go. And I'm being modest about the series here, because personally I even love season 1 ;)"

You needed to suffer through the first season like the rest of us for backstory so you'd understand what was going on in the following seasons. It gets much, much better.  Bear in mind that Babylon 5 is a five-year story arc. Also bear in mind that the first season was a proof of concept on a network not accustomed to science fiction, it succeeded - by the skin of its teeth, and season 2 and onward got a much larger budget which really shows."

babylon5,1ronf2,Knarkis,3,Fri Nov 29 06:27:51 2013 UTC,"Absolutely.  Most of the episodes in season 1 were not written by JMS, but from about a third of the way through season 2 to the end of the series, he wrote almost ever single episode himself.  This means that the story is probably the most tightly arc'ed and well planned out series that has ever been on TV.  But yes, the first season isn't all that great, and the graphics are atrocious.  They get better too by the way, much better."
babylon5,1ronf2,ishamiel,2,Fri Nov 29 04:13:31 2013 UTC,"Yes, it's worth it absolutely. I had the same problem with Buffy and in both cases I'm hugely grateful that I kept at it. S2 onward are fantastic."

I know B5 doesn't have a Trek or X-Files level profile, but I think the thing is that B5 is always going to be around, with new people getting into it and once the HD work is done, it's done forever. WB can then sit back and make a slow, healthy profit eternally off Blu-Ray sales, downloads and re-syndicating (if that's the correct term here) the HD version."

babylon5,1rhvz2,irregardless,4,Sat Dec 28 21:07:38 2013 UTC,"Hell YES!!  B5 is a strong ""catalog"" seller. Once all the TV markets move entirely to HD (still a few years away), they won't be able to license B5 for syndication ever again. This upgrade ensures that, as many others here have wisely pointed out, B5 would continue to be a profit earner for WB.  There's a reason WB has never put B5 on Netflix - because it still sells on DVD. Lets hope that when they crunch the numbers, they get a good result. Yes, there a re a ton of CGI shots, BUT once you build the main ship CGI models, that's the bulk of it right there. They don't need to waste any time or money storyboarding or designing ships from scratch. Once you have the station, you mimic the original shots, same with the Star Fury's, White Stars, Shadow vessels, etc.  The article cited $9 million down to $6 million per season for the STTNG seasons. For a show as uniquely marketable as B5, that's an easy sum to earn back from Blu Ray sales and new syndication deals. Especially when you can market it honestly to TV stations with all of the awards it's won.  Blu Ray Babylon 5 would be an immediate purchase from me! I'd gladly sacrifice my STTNG Blu rays in favor of Babylon 5 in HD, since B5 has the better story and is one I love to rewatch over and over."
babylon5,1rhvz2,FKRMunkiBoi,8,Tue Nov 26 18:32:49 2013 UTC,a reason WB has never put B5 on Netflix   B5 was on Netflix a few years ago (in the U.S). I was in the middle of a re-watch when it disappeared from my queue.   It was a disappointing day.
babylon5,1rhvz2,mk262,2,Tue Nov 26 19:27:37 2013 UTC,"I totally missed that then. The season sets can be had for around $20, I highly recommend them!"
babylon5,1rhvz2,thegenregeek,5,Tue Nov 26 21:25:43 2013 UTC,Inspired by TNG in bluray?
babylon5,1rhvz2,pretty_mermaid,3,Tue Nov 26 15:48:49 2013 UTC,"That (mentioned in the article) and probably the reaction from the Breaking Bad shout out. BB got a number of people talking about it again, many lamenting the lack of ability to watch it streaming online. That discussion also, I believe, lead to a UK cable channel picking up the series again.  So WB might be looking at it, assuming this source is accurate (not holding my breath), in order to get both BluRay sales and future syndication revenue from online and television channels.  The sad truth is that with the move to HD for a number of networks and distribution channels, the upscaled work they did for the initial DVD release won't cut it. They need to release a native wide screen version, one where the shots don't go blurry when an effect happens on screen. The only way to do that is to remaster the whole thing."
babylon5,1rhvz2,StudioDraven,4,Tue Nov 26 17:53:57 2013 UTC,"i always thought the ppg blurriness was intentional, like an effect of the weapon"
babylon5,1rhvz2,DarrenGrey,2,Tue Nov 26 20:47:18 2013 UTC,IIRC it was. According to Ron Thornton it's supposed to be a heat ripple from the weapon fire.
babylon5,1rhvz2,m0rris0n_hotel,2,Wed Nov 27 00:22:44 2013 UTC,"You see blurs in other scenes where there shouldn't be any though, always because of some little CG effect."
babylon5,1rhvz2,thegenregeek,2,Wed Nov 27 01:24:23 2013 UTC,The source is accurate. This stems from a podcast hosted by Feltenstein himself. The last 2-3 minutes of This one is where he adresses Babylon 5.
babylon5,1rhvz2,senses3,3,Tue Nov 26 18:18:39 2013 UTC,Based on the results for the updates for Star Trek I would be cautiously optimistic at the results of this. B5 had some great effects for its time but they do seem a bit jarring these days. Producing a set that has both the original and updated effects would be ideal. This way everyone wins.
babylon5,1rhvz2,thegenregeek,11,Tue Nov 26 15:52:27 2013 UTC,"Based on the results for the updates for Star Trek...   I don't think you even have to look there. Remember when the Lost Tales came out? That alone sold me on what they could do if they simply redid the effects for the original series.  My favorite bit from JMS, about the Lost Tales, came when he mentioned his first meeting with the FX team. He was brought in to look at an early ""low resolution"" model of part of the station they were working on. Before he was presented with it the FX team lead warned him it was a work in progress and only had like 2,000 polygons (or something similar in number).  He responded ""that's more than we had for the entire original model""."

The Star Trek updated effects sold me it could be done and not kill the magic that each classic episode had. Same goes for B5. It'll take some getting used to but would enjoy seeing how it turns out.   And I am quite curious to know how updated Vorlon and Shadow effects would look. Those interest me more than anything."

I raised the possibility a while back that if nothing else, WB could ""open source"" the whole thing - scan the footage, shove it on a torrent, and let folks play with it online.   Apart from some folks who seemed to think that the 3D models could never possibly be recreated, there also seemed to be a major cognitive dissonance about the state of the live action footage. I understood it was all film and somewhat safe; others seemed to believe it had been scanned into digital and the stock destroyed; and another group appeared to believe (as stated in the article) that the original stock was damaged.   Until there's an official report on the state of the live action footage, it's all speculation."

babylon5,1rhvz2,Wooperlooper,3,Tue Nov 26 18:45:33 2013 UTC,"They filmed in 16:9, but did the CGI in 4:3 aspect initially, under the assumption that they could render out new versions of the CGI if they released on new media (e.g. DVD). But they lost the model files, so they had to zoom & crop the CGI bits, which makes the PAL edition of the DVD particularly bad, because the resolution change between regular live action and CGI is quite visible."

babylon5,1rhvz2,stevekez,6,Tue Nov 26 19:42:31 2013 UTC,"Well, for shits and giggles I'll explain it in a less video techy way!  The cameras filmed in widescreen, but the show was only going to be aired in normal, so they did the CGI bits (where there's live action combined with computer effects), in normal. The idea was they could re-make those bits later if they needed to.  But they'd lost some of the files they needed to re-make them when the time came, so they had to improvise. They chopped the top and bottom off the CGI shots to make them widescreen shaped, then stretched them out to fit.  Here in Europe we use a video format called ""PAL"" which has more lines than the american standard ""NTSC"". So, the stretching looks worse over here, because the difference in detail between the two types of shot is greater, as the CGI is stretched out over more lines."

For me the biggest issue with the program wasn't crappy CGi (hell I grew up in the 70's - B5 was fantastic at the time), rather it was the claustrophobic nature of most indoor the shots, that lead to the stories being impacted. Perhaps the sets could be enhanced using modern CGI?  Let me try and explain.  B5 is the story of galactic proportions with adventure at epic scales. Massive societies (like the Centauri) control vast areas of space. So what you’d expect is that there would massive levels of stuff happening. However when you look at the things in B5 lots of the sets have few people, or few distance shots. The really big League of ambassadors seem to exist without the support of what you’d normally expect – entourage etc. The scenes on say Minbar, or Mars or on-board ships don’t convey the size galactic backdrop up on which this tapestry is being weaved.    All in all the scale of the War against the Shadows seems so minor compared to what it was – a galaxy level war with many many combatants. You can see similar correlations with the original Star Trek and the later updates/reboots.  It seems to me that key pieces – The Shadows/Vorlons/Ancient ones, The fall of Centauri Prime, the Liberation of Mars/Earth and others, were supposed to be (pardon the phrase) ‘galaxy shattering events’ but they  didn’t seem to convey that. I think the biggest anomaly is the Psi Corp and the telepaths – it was a such a critical piece in the B5 chess games, but many important scenes were very small.  Now don’t get me wrong – to me the execution of B5 at the time was excellent given its financial and technical constraints, but what I’d really love to see is the scale of what B5 was intended to be truly realised.   Edit: I know Lucas' cuts to star wars weren't all universally accepted (me included), but he did do one thing that helped reduce the similar claustrophobia in the old SW movies. Take the adding of windows in the Cloud City as an example."
babylon5,1rhvz2,Molotov_Cockatiel,1 point,Wed Nov 27 01:01:35 2013 UTC,"This actually makes me a bit sad - it's the obvious impact of modern overengineering of movies.   When you watch a dramatic performance, your brain should be willing to forego the trappings of the performance to focus on the story. Greek plays were performed by all men on an open stage with virtually no set or props. Shakespeare's works were also performed with minimal set pieces. They are about the story.   Babylon 5, similarly, is about a small group of people and their impact on history. When Sheridan addresses the station, I don't need to see several thousand people in an auditorium to ""get it"" - a dozen folks will do to make the point.   And in fact, one tangential effect of the improvements in CGI through the five seasons I think really works well - in the first season most space engagements showed a handful of ships. As the show progresses, the space battles get busier and more complex until the massive battles in season 4 really make you feel like the entire galaxy is at war.   Never an intended effect, it is still a very fitting one."
babylon5,1rhvz2,senses3,1 point,Sat Jan 4 13:36:46 2014 UTC,Yes you are right. I love stage performance as it's acting and stories that carry it. But B5 had CGI that was too big for the stage but too little for screen. A sad hybrid.
babylon5,1rhvz2,letsgocrazy,1 point,Sat Jan 4 13:48:57 2014 UTC,"I remember hearing that they saved all of the CG stuff and this could be done rather easily. They will still have to go back to most of the live action stuff and redo that for HD though, which may be the harder part.  Feel free to correct me, I'd rather know the truth than go by what I have heard in the past."
babylon5,1rhvz2,SearchNerd,7,Tue Nov 26 18:57:21 2013 UTC,"Quite the opposite, both companies who did the VFX (Only Foundation Imaging really counts) went out of business, including the production company.  Some artists probably still have some assets, but they'd be useless anyway, way too low resolution with texturing that'd look about right for a PS2 game...    So everything would need to be remodeled.  Then re-animated and re-composited.  And I'm just not interested if the original Emmy-winning artists aren't involved... that just wouldn't be B5.  Look at the dogshit that was Season 4 and especially 5 to see why.    Even bigger problem than re-creating pure CG is that all the (film) elements used in the composited shots have to be well preserved, they're easy to overlook/lose since they're often not listed in the Edit Decision Lists.    And WB is just no Paramount.  Even though Paramount knew it had a cash cow on its hands there were some difficulties with degradation and cataloging of the TNG film.    WB was at best indifferent to B5 and had no reason to be exacting with the quality of their cataloging and storage.  110 episodes is a lot of film.    And (just like TNG) the first episodes are the weakest (esp. the Pilot) which makes it harder to use this to attract new viewers or massive sales from the early work to pay for the rest of it...    It'd probably be better if somebody like Netflix just did a remake or new series...  But the follow-ons to B5 made it seem a little like JMS's well was running dry and he's pretty busy working on massive budget movies these days..."
babylon5,1rhvz2,taldarin,2,Tue Nov 26 19:24:30 2013 UTC,"Ah wow, they have their work cut out for them.   I won't be holding my breath for this to happen. I still have hope just because I think it would be awesome if it happened."
babylon5,1rhvz2,Netzaj,2,Tue Nov 26 19:34:14 2013 UTC,"I'm not being funny, but if they really wanted to recreate the CGI they could.   It's not massively complex stuff, and if you just made a shot for shot copy of every scene at HD it could be rendered on home computers or small boutiques.   You could get some models remade (the probably exist as fan models anyway) and farm out shots or episodes to different fans and leave them to it.   Although the CGI definitely improves through the series, I probably have more power than their entire render farm on just one PC.   It would be a great project to be involved with though."
babylon5,1rhvz2,Hairy_Seldon,1 point,Wed Nov 27 01:51:18 2013 UTC,I saw this on B5 scrolls too. The discussion around it was about it being a huge and difficult project. I think something that lends credence to it is the acknowledgement that they realize there is a ton of demand for it.

I'm pretty sure it wasn't until years later when I got the DVD sets that I saw it, and I'm kind of glad that it played out that way. Watching all the seasons back to back, I can appreciate this much more now than as a 17 year old. The whole episode is a meditation on the necessity of ending, and like the tail end of The Deconstruction of Falling Stars, it makes the value judgement that if the end has to come, it was better to be swallowed in flames (light) than darkness.  So I think I'll just go weep quietly in the corner for a while."
babylon5,1qqhjn,beaverteeth92,3,Sat Nov 16 03:35:28 2013 UTC,"I remember there was a fair amount of discussion about destroying the station on the mailing list, back in the day. One could review that material on the Lurker's Guide page for the episode or search JMSNews for his reasoning.  That said, while it's poetic and it fulfills flashforward/prophecy from earlier in the show, I don't think blowing it up makes a lot of real-world sense as presented because, as mentioned elsewhere here, now it REALLY creates a navigation hazard and there's lots of materials that could be salvaged.  All that would have been needed, really, was the shot of all the dignitary ships leaving to go on a bit longer to show a cluster of salvage ships moving slowly into the debris field. After all, the station was still in pretty big pieces after the explosion, which are probably easier to manage for materials salvage. This makes the explosion analagous to a building being imploded.  Alternately, the rotation could have been slowed to a stop, some engines mounted along the spine, and a course set for the nearest star, if actual destruction was the goal."

babylon5,1qnz0f,OisinDebard,2,Fri Nov 15 05:47:28 2013 UTC,"Yeah, we'd encountered a few races before the Minbari, but they were the first to give us a run for our money. I believe the first extraterrestrial race was the Centauri, who tried to convince us that Earth was a long lost Centauri colony, but that didn't work out. Still, they leased us the use of their jumpgates, and that allowed us to expand. We ran into the Dilgar which were slightly less technologically advanced, and had the Dilgar war. When that war was over (with Earth coming out incredibly victorious), Earth decided it was time to sit at the big boy table. Since Centauri wouldn't sell advanced weaponry, Earth forces decided to go looking for trouble, and try to find the Minbari, which we'd heard about, but never encountered. The Centauri ambassador warned us that was a very bad idea, but the Earth commander said, ""we handled the Dilgar, we can handle the Minbari."" Which prompted Londo's best line ever: ""Ah, arrogance and stupidity all in the same package. How efficient of you.""

Population continues to be a problem, despite the heavy losses caused by the Earth Minbari War.

Yes, there is plenty of poverty to go around, but that poverty is what we've seen as a symptom of expansion (pioneering people taking big risks and losing, getting far enough out to try to strike it rich but losing out and ending up on the down below levels), wars, or losing out in the new economies that are springing up due to failure to compete."

If it's good enough for Paramount/CBS and the BBC to post their shows, then why isn't it good enough for JMS and WB? If they really want to save B5, it would be back on Netflix tomorrow. Some money generated from Netflix surely has to be better than no money while the film rots on dusty shelves."

What does an official protest by the Vorlon look like?"

babylon5,1pumk3,xeothought,3,Mon Nov 4 03:06:04 2013 UTC,"""The scuttling must be careful.""  But seriously, the Vorlons were always only cryptic, as opposed to terse, when it served their purpose to obfuscate. Most of Kosh's famous lines in seasons one and two were for the specific purpose of obfuscation, and so Kosh was characterized as an always cryptic person, when in fact he wasn't. Very clever of JMS, frankly.   Consider the difference between lines such as ""The willows must scuttle carefully"" (obviously obfuscation for Talia's benefit) and ""The avalanche has already started. It is too late for the pebbles to vote"" (mainly nonsense in an attempt to deflect the line of discussion) and lines such as ""Leave this place; they are not for you,"" and ""They are alone. They are a dying people. We should let them pass,"" both of which are extremely terse, but absolutely clear expressions of the ideas Kosh wanted to convey."
babylon5,1pumk3,MayContainNugat,5,Mon Nov 4 15:37:35 2013 UTC,"I agree, but I would add that I don't think that Kosh was actually trying to confuse people. I think that the Vorlons viewed communicating with pretty much anyone as trying to talk to a much lower form of life.  The Vorlons were millions of years more advanced than anyone else who was actually represented on Babylon 5, existed as a plasma, could exist in multiple places at once, and it was strongly inferred that the race communicated among themselves via telepathy, which was moving FTL. This is how they knew that Kosh died. And also, how the Shadow vessels suddenly knew that Sheridan had bombed Zahadun.   I think they just really had a difficult time dumbing things down to our level, which was why any long telepathic contact with lower races seemed to drain them. For example, when Kosh rescues Sheridan."
babylon5,1pumk3,techie1980,3,Mon Nov 4 16:11:38 2013 UTC,"The ""The avalanche has already started"" line wasn't nonsense.  It was a cryptic reference to the pilot episode where Sinclair used his powers as military governor to order Dr. Kyle, the original Chief Medical Officer, to treat Kosh against the wishes of the Vorlon Empire.  He says this after the mother asks him how he would feel if someone performed an unwanted procedure on him against his wishes which is exactly what happened.  The avalanche (The decision to perform an unwanted procedure against an individual's will) has already started (The precedence has been set).  It is too late for the pebbles to vote (The decision will be made regardless of the feelings of the individual or the group)."

babylon5,1pj6yw,ArcaneShield,7,Wed Oct 30 13:32:44 2013 UTC,All of the shots in the garden where Kosh exposed himself are heavy green screen.  This would be a project that would easily triple the cost that Paramount spent on remastering TNG.

babylon5,1pj6yw,FrodoFraggins,6,Wed Oct 30 15:53:54 2013 UTC,I don't think the hardware and software costs would really be the problem (especially since effects houses have already paid for them). It would be paying people to redo the effects.  Then combine that with expected sales. Would a B5 remaster sell as much as TNG?  I'm not saying the numbers don't work out but I'm sure this is part of what is being factored in. Also B5's first run syndication was 3-4% of US households while DS9 was 4-5% and paramount has not committed to remastering that.  Edit: Wikipedia article cited for viewership
babylon5,1pj6yw,FKRMunkiBoi,5,Wed Oct 30 21:13:01 2013 UTC,"Your attitude makes responding pointless.  But rest assured, it's not a cheap endeavor and WB has no interest in spending money on upgrading B5 to be BluRay worthy."

I'm going to be absolutely shocked if there aren't machines where you load up a spool of 35mm, run it, and get an avi out the other end. Straight film->digital transfer has got to be cheap.   And like I said - if the film isn't in any condition for that, then this is a non-starter.   But I'm saying in a world where corporate asshats weren't so poorly informed about the business nature of copyright, that could be where WB's work pretty much ends. Then they just release it for fans to do the rest if they choose.   So stick with me here - if a fan builds some 3d models, and a fan does the motion graphics, and a fan does the rendering - that's not ""WB doing the work""  And one more time - I agree they won't do it. But it's because they're idiots, not because of massive costs or because of some business problem."

Or they can release it into the public domain. Or they can publish some part of it into the public domain. Or they can release part of it with a limited license to adapt and distribute online (see the GPL).   Look at all the artists who openly publish their music online, either as a gift to the fans, or as a means of gaining notoriety, or to piss off the record label. It's all possible.   The executives and attorneys running the old media companies, for some reason (and I have never gotten a straight answer on this - I keep trying) refuse to share any intellectual property they hold, even if they're not making any money on it. Many authors have put older books of theirs online as e-books because otherwise they're just gathering dust.

If the film exists, they could fan-source all of the labor on a B5 Blu-Ray release or even offer content parcels to universities with compatible majors and students who'd like the line on their resumes.   It would be fun, build a huge wave of interest in the show, and it would be forward-thinking without setting any real precedent because this show is the product of a transitional time in TV cinematography.

What I wish is that they'd just release what they have into the public domain - run straight HD scans of the existing films and post those files online. Then folks can crowdsource remastering, at least of the more interesting episodes, or the episodes where the CGI-Only scenes are really bad (season 1)  The existing episodes still exist, so it's viewer's call if they choose to replace various eps with crowdsourced remasters. And since it's very unlikely that 100% of the series would get redone, there would actually still be a market for the original WB series on Netflix and DVD."

babylon5,1pj6yw,demonstar55,12,Thu Oct 31 00:56:04 2013 UTC,"There will be no re-rendering.  Warner did a piss-pour job managing/tracking assets, they have none of the original CGI data and probably don't have much of the original VFX elements (raw footage of greenscreen shots/etc).  On top of this both VFX companies (and the production company) went out of business.    Paramount knew well what a cash-cow ST is so they had all this stuff down quite well, and had shot all on film, which was appropriately stored, with a lot of the VFX being models / optical effects so they just needed to be re-scanned and cleaned up to be HD.  The re-modeling stuff and render time are not the biggest issues, where they were required.    Next, ST:TNG's remaster is probably not a slam-dunk, financially.  The purchases of disks has fallen off a cliff the last several years.  They'll probably do OK, but that's for a massive show that millions and millions of people grew up addicted to.  Sure there's some demand for streaming, but that doesn't pay nearly as well as the golden days of disk sales.    Given all this the only reasonable thing to hope for would be a simple up-res job.  But the fact it was mastered in standard definition video but letterboxed means there's even less picture there to work with.  The predictable backlash about the lack of quality will prevent that, if they thought there was even a market anymore.    So read some reviews, find the best up-scaling home DVD/Blu-ray player out there, buy a 4k TV even, put in your DVDs, and enjoy the STORY."
babylon5,1pj6yw,demonstar55,-6,Wed Oct 30 22:14:59 2013 UTC,"The live action stuff was shot on 35mm - if those films still exist (and I understand they do), then at the cheapest they can do a direct rescan to 1080p (35mm film can render to 1080p just fine).   I don't understand why everyone goes on and on about the models. The meshes were created by artists the first time, they can be done again. There are already amateur renders of B5 and Star Furies on YouTube - most of them are many years old.   Yep here you go - free for the download. These are low-res, but adding detail is just a matter of patience and time.   And that's why I said ""fansource"" it - I'm sure there are plenty of people who would love to redo the Battle of the Line or Severed Dreams or the other battles. If the film has the native greenscreen work, then even that can be redone in several commercial packages.   The original show was done on a freaking 1994 Amiga - my phone is more powerful than that. Doing rerenders will just happen if someone can just digitize the film and promise not to go banhammer on fan footage on YouTube."
babylon5,1pj6yw,demonstar55,9,Thu Oct 31 00:29:35 2013 UTC,"Because you continue to willfully miss the point.  Yes, the space shots would not be that hard to redo, even if everything had to be remodeled.    But the VFX shots that incorporated live action... all of those plates (backgrounds) and elements (greenscreen shots of actors) would be needed yet are almost certainly lost.    Scans which there's no way in hell JMS or Warner will ever work together to put in the public domain.    And it's not B5 without the original Emmy-winning visionaries in charge of the VFX.  You think it can be done faster for damn near free?  So did Netter Digital and this is why S4&S5 are practically unwatchable."
babylon5,1pj6yw,demonstar55,-6,Thu Oct 31 00:51:04 2013 UTC,"I'm not willfully missing the point, though there is missing information here. YOU are willfully missing the point.   As far as I know, there is currently no information available about the 35mm film that was shot for the series. I will grant it is most likely trashed or damaged.   But there's also a (slim) possibility that it's sitting in a vault somewhere, like so much old stock does.   So let's posit that the 35mm film for ""Severed Dreams"" is found.   Now as far as I am aware, what is on that film is all the live action that was shot - set pieces, actors with empty windows, and even the live action portion of digitally composited shots.   I'm pretty sure the process was:    Live action on 35mm film. If there's an actor involved, it's on film. Anything that is not actor, prop, or set is greenscreen on 35mm film Pure CGI scenes were, of course, rendered directly.  Live action shots that needed digital compositing were (I believe) scanned to the editing suite, the CGI was rendered and composited in, and then the whole thing was rendered to final format   If that is true, and original 35mm film was available, everything else can be recreated, just like Paramount did for Star Trek remastered. Do you think anything from the original series other than the live action film was necessary to do the re-renders and recompositing? Bah - CGI artists created models for everything.   I'm just confused - it seems like everyone thinks that the CGI work that was done in 1994 can never ever be recreated by anyone ever again. It was created once, it can be done again.   The live action footage is what cannot be replaced or recreated, and I'm pretty sure all of it is on 35mm film."
babylon5,1pj6yw,wlpaul4,3,Thu Oct 31 01:17:01 2013 UTC,"And you honestly think something like THIS--at HD nontheless, is better than the amazing stuff we already had?

babylon5,1pj6yw,Hairy_Seldon,5,Thu Oct 31 01:21:08 2013 UTC,"Well Star Wreck was a lot better than that, the Star Trek/B5 parody film. Not sure how professional they were.  But still, the volume of work required is immense. And WB would never trust fans to do a professional job. There are all sorts of legal issues with contracting people for this sorts of work (what if a fan slips in a porn slide?) And even if they did allow the simple fact is that huge fan projects tend to start with lots of steam and quickly run into the ground. I would not expect something of this scale to succeed without paying a proper company a lot of money to do the job right.  The green screen stuff is the worst, and you can see even on the DVDs that these are much worse quality than the regular live shots. It can never be upscaled - never.  But, as has been said, the true joy of Babylon 5 is not in pretty space battles (many of which are pretty enough as is). It's about story, drama, characters, and a rich and believable universe. 1080p is not needed for any of that."

You know, I simply had an idea. The big showstopper is WB being asshats. But after that, it would be possible for neat things to happen.   Several people here seem intent on finding reasons why it won't work. This is not a great way to live life. How about thinking of ways it could work instead?"
babylon5,1pj6yw,ArcaneShield,6,Thu Oct 31 01:08:18 2013 UTC,"But they have a valid excuse, the models got lost so they would have to recreate everything to render them at a better resolution. And there was film that was damaged / lost, so they would have to reshoot that."
babylon5,1pj6yw,sequentious,-3,Thu Oct 31 01:19:05 2013 UTC,"If the film is gone or damaged beyond repair, then this is a non-starter. It can't be reshot, the existing digital copies are useless, and we're done.   This only works if the original 35mm film is available and can be rescanned to 1080p. If I were running WB, I'd write the check to do that - just run the films through a digital scanner to create 1080P avi files, and put them on BitTorrent with an open license.   Maybe offer awards for the best fan cuts, and the best rerenders of CGI scenes - judged by JMS if he'll do it. Give away any remaining props as prizes (priceless to the fans, worthless to the studio)  All entries go on WB.com, and now you have a free stream of PR for whatever you want to use it for at almost no cost. Sell Blu-Rays, or advertise the streamed show on Amazon. Piggyback on it for a new SF show if you have one handy.   Pretty much zero-risk upside, as far as I can tell."

babylon5,1pgjz9,FrodoFraggins,4,Wed Oct 30 01:33:29 2013 UTC,"The man is making a show for Netflix with the Wachowskis.  I think he gets it.  The idea behind him wanting the show on television is for the theoretical newcomer who browses between channels and discovers the show because it's on television.  Nothing is stopping people from time shifting, and daily syndication beats what WB had previously done to the show with online viewing (making only random episodes from the series available at any given time, making it impossible to watch from beginning to end without buying the dvds or pirating the show).    I got hooked on the show when it first went into 5 day syndication at 4pm while season five aired on Saturdays, so to me this is good news.  Even then there was this device called a VCR which you could program to record shows even when you're not home.  Those tapes may still exist, and were viewed more than once."

I assume that the in universe reason was that as she was the highest ranking member of Sherridan's fleet in the civil war placing her at the helm of a brand new warship that was still fairly experimental, brand new artificial gravity system and all, was a safe way to give her a prestige posting and to get her our of the way politically."
babylon5,1pbtpa,kindalas,6,Sun Oct 27 19:44:20 2013 UTC,"Plus, with the Whitestars, she has experience commanding a ship with gravimetric drive, something very few, if any,  other Earthforce officers have."

babylon5,1pbtpa,Gark32,4,Sun Oct 27 19:41:23 2013 UTC,quite a bit during the Earth-Minbari war.
babylon5,1pbtpa,RangerSix,5,Sun Oct 27 20:46:45 2013 UTC,"Pretty sure Ivanova missed the war. War ended in 2248, she was commissioned in 2249."
babylon5,1pbtpa,Gark32,4,Sun Oct 27 21:00:30 2013 UTC,"I think ""commissioned"" is the wrong term here; in a military context, that generally means someone who has achieved at least the rank of second lieutenant (or equivalent) and as such has received a formal document of commission.  If you mean to say Ivanova joined Earthforce after the Earth-Minbari war, the appropriate term would be ""enlisted"". (Though it's fairly obvious that she was also commissioned after the Earth-Minbari War too, as she held the rank of commander at the time of her posting to Babylon 5.)"
babylon5,1pbtpa,RangerSix,3,Sun Oct 27 22:48:31 2013 UTC,she enlisted in 2247; she went to OCS in 2249.

She wanted to—which is why she enlisted in 2247 and was immediately sent to OCS—but she never carried an enlisted rank and graduated in 2249 as an EarthForce officer.  ""And Now For A Word"" talks about this as well, when the reporter asks why she joined EarthForce. She went right to OCS."

babylon5,1pbtpa,drummer_San,3,Sun Oct 27 21:11:25 2013 UTC,"Ivanova had flight time in the station's Starfuries, and a White Star is still probably a more sophisticated and powerful ship than an Earthforce ship."
babylon5,1pbtpa,dbrees,1 point,Sun Oct 27 20:23:28 2013 UTC,More sophisticated yes but a warlock shits on it. Remember warlocks have reverse engineered shadow tech on them basically like the whitestar has vorlon.
babylon5,1pbtpa,Sadik,1 point,Thu Oct 31 17:53:15 2013 UTC,Can't find the source but the Warlocks (and subsequent future Interstellar Alliance ships) benefit from both shadow AND vorlon technology.

babylon5,1owtr8,KinkotheClown,10,Mon Oct 21 16:47:53 2013 UTC,"They could have served as undercover operatives, or were held back as a surprise reserve no one would expect. Don't forget, Sheridan forced a premature conclusion the the Shadow war, which could have dragged on for years to come."
babylon5,1owtr8,ZebeDIEah,4,Mon Oct 21 16:57:41 2013 UTC,I know that there was a Drakh piloting the transport full of Telepaths that were being processed as CPUs for the Shadow Vessels.  I just figured that they would have played a more prominent role than ship drivers given that they were more adept at war than even the Shadows were.  There is also the fact that the reason that the Shadows lost the previous round of the Shadow War was because they moved too quickly.  Having the Drakh serve as the primary attack force allowed the Shadows time to build up their own supply of ships and keep their involvement a secret from the Younger Races.
babylon5,1owtr8,Stile4aly,4,Mon Oct 21 17:15:40 2013 UTC,"given that they were more adept at war than even the Shadows were   No they were not.  The shadows were THE first ones. (excluding Lorien and his race)  They were more technologically advanced than even the Vorlons. They were making war on the first ones when they were naught but babes. The Drakh on the other hand, are comparable to the younger races ie; Minbari, Centauri, humans.  The Drakh were a bunch of tweenager wussies compared to the Shadows."
babylon5,1owtr8,sequentious,1 point,Mon Oct 21 23:27:43 2013 UTC,I'm not speaking on their level of power but their level of tactical and strategic thinking.  The Shadows were trapped in their ways of thinking on how to wage war.  They utilized the same tactics time and time again even though it led to their defeat.
babylon5,1owtr8,BrentingtonSteele,4,Mon Oct 21 23:36:24 2013 UTC,But their purpose was not to win the war.  Their purpose was to create chaos and weed out the younger races.
babylon5,1owtr8,misho88,1 point,Mon Oct 21 23:55:13 2013 UTC,"They could have played a destabilizing role, attacking minor targets in order to free up the Shadow Vessels to attack larger targets."
babylon5,1owtr8,misho88,5,Tue Oct 22 00:30:08 2013 UTC,"Especially when you consider that the shadows viewed conflict as beneficial to the species involved (well, at least some of those involved). The strongest emerge from a fight stronger.  It doesn't make sense that they would take their (apparently) strong allies, and isolate them from the front lines."
babylon5,1owtr8,mrwoolery,2,Mon Oct 21 17:14:46 2013 UTC,"I'd put the Drakh on par with the Minbari in terms of strength.  Considering that the Minbari were the chosen of the Vorlons to represent them, it was odd that the Shadows didn't put forth their own equally powerful representative on the field."
babylon5,1owtr8,DarrenGrey,9,Mon Oct 21 17:20:26 2013 UTC,Not really. The shadows lived up to their names. They hid behind the curtains and let the other races fights amongst themselves so they became stronger. They didn't need a race to waive their banners. For them to have one powerful favoured/chosen race like the vorlons did with the minbari would go against the shadows' entire belief system. They preferred to stir up the pot and see which races came out on top all on their own.
babylon5,1owtr8,brbATF,3,Mon Oct 21 23:50:07 2013 UTC,"My reasoning is this:  The Drakh take care of the Shadows between the wars if I remember correctly. It makes sense that the Shadows wouldn't want that fact to be well known. After all, their original plan was to kill a whole bunch of people and then retreat for another thousand years to allow the survivors time to recover (stimulating natural selection and all that). If records are left behind clearly and unquestionably identifying the Drakh as the Shadows' caretakers, things wouldn't go very smoothly next time around, so it makes sense to use the Drakh as little as possible."
babylon5,1owtr8,ZebeDIEah,2,Mon Oct 21 18:50:48 2013 UTC,I don't think the Drakh were servants of the Shadows in the time of the First Shadow War given that Londo knew of them which means that they were active as an independent power at some point during the centuries after the the First Shadow War when the Centauri started their own forays into space.
babylon5,1owtr8,brbATF,3,Mon Oct 21 19:06:11 2013 UTC,"I read through this: http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Drakh  Records of the Drakh seem to only reach back a few centuries, so it's not clear whether they did anything during the previous war, so you may be right. Londo just says that they spent a certain amount of time poking around the galaxy generally being scary but mostly harmless before disappearing. Probably, that means they were gathering resources in preparation of hiding at Z'ha'dum. Regardless, they've proven that they're useful as guardians and servants to the Shadows, so it still makes sense that the Shadows would want to keep using them for that."
babylon5,1owtr8,brbATF,4,Mon Oct 21 19:47:02 2013 UTC,I don't think the Drakh came to have any formidable power until they inherited the scraps left behind by the Shadows.
babylon5,1owtr8,demonstar55,2,Mon Oct 21 21:59:41 2013 UTC,"Yes, this is my interpretation too. They are the shadows of shadows, what is left behind when their masters disappear. As servants of the shadows they had much less power at their disposal, or at least less freedom to take advantage of that power.  Besides, as a fighting force they didn't have the Shadows' ability to hyperspace into an area, kill everything extremely quickly without taking damage, and then hyperspace away with ease. For a strike force they just wouldn't have been anywhere near as effective."
babylon5,1owtr8,Exterus,3,Wed Oct 23 09:42:28 2013 UTC,"I'm not at all convinced that the Drakh are comparable to the Minbari  They're far more effective than the Minbari as covert assets because of their ability to take direct control of a target, but when you get into ship-to-ship combat... well... a squadron of white stars took out a fleet of similar-class ships and a capital ship while only losing one of their own, and we know that the Minbari have much more combat-capable ships than the white stars... I just don't see them as anywhere near comparable  Post-shadow-war, the Drakh couldn't even dent the Excalibur"
babylon5,1owtr8,Reemer09,3,Mon Oct 21 18:23:35 2013 UTC,"Both the White Star and The Excalibur were based on Vorlon technology. The Drakh were NOT first ones, like the Vorlons."
babylon5,1owtr8,naranek,2,Mon Oct 21 23:31:18 2013 UTC,"Yes, and my point is that Minbari capital ships were much more powerful than the white stars despite the white stars' partial vorlon design, making it all the more significant that a handful of essentially heavy fighters, which had already been damaged in an ambush, took out a Drakh capital ship and escorts.  The white star's inability to engage younger-race capital ships except in swarms, let alone minbari capital ships, was the entire motivation behind creating the Excalibur and Victory"
babylon5,1oqzz7,misho88,8,Sat Oct 19 00:22:28 2013 UTC,"There's a few arguments which could be made here. First of all, a lot of the day-to-day running of the station was handled by Ivanova, freeing up Sinclair/Sheridan's time for diplomatic matters. The other thing that comes to mind is that the Minbari had a lot to do with getting B5 up and running, and it's made clear in the first season that they manipulated things so that Sinclair would represent humanity (i.e. the biggest backers of the Babylon project other than humans insisted on Sinclair rather than a real ambassador). Once Sinclair left for Minbar, the command structure stayed the same and they just got Sheridan to come in as a replacement."
babylon5,1oqzz7,MatthewGeer,11,Sat Oct 19 16:52:04 2013 UTC,"it may be just a plot issue, allowing for Sinclair and Sheridan to run the station and be present in diplomatic matters.  it's a good point u raise tho.  imagine how busy you would be running the station, it's population and representing Earth to all the ambassadors.  i think that if we did operate a neutral diplomatic station, that we would hav one of our guys running it, but would hav a separate ambassador."
babylon5,1oqzz7,thegenregeek,12,Sat Oct 19 04:53:50 2013 UTC,"Especially in season 5.  Who is Earth's representative to the Interstellar Alliance?  Mars and Proxima Centari are no longer part of Earth Alliance at this point, either, so there should have been multiple human ambassadors on the council."
babylon5,1oqzz7,gragsmash,3,Sat Oct 19 05:36:19 2013 UTC,"Keep in mind Tessa (No 1) had a direct in with him in season 5 as the representative of Mars. She also had worked closely with the other key human members of the ISA.  As for any other colonies, Sheridan was their liberator from EA control. So they probably would have been happy letting him represent them. With direct contact through their head of state.  Now an important point to also consider, humanity was still rather xenophobic. Places like Mars really wanted to focus on Mars first and then it's dealing with Earth. So there may have been literally no motivation to have a direct ambassador to the ISA. (Tessa only went their because Earth was playing games and they wanted to put pressure on them. Which only the ISA could do). Proxima was a remote colony, but was still withing Earth controlled space. Meaning there may have been little alien interaction to warrant the ISA."
babylon5,1oqzz7,thegenregeek,1 point,Sat Oct 19 19:05:36 2013 UTC,"In season 5, didn't the captain represent earth?"
babylon5,1oqzz7,BrainDeadUnit,1 point,Sat Oct 19 17:05:24 2013 UTC,"yes, Lochley was the EA rep.  but if i remember correctly, at the ISA council meetings in s5, Sheridan was the only human.  maybe the race that holds the presidency doesnt get to send an additional rep?"
babylon5,1oqzz7,chattymcgee,4,Sat Oct 19 21:13:13 2013 UTC,"Personally I would say the fact that B5's ambassador is also its military governor is an important point showing us that the Earth Alliance was already on a path towards fascism. Rather that is to say that Earth was very much organized centrally around its military and ""nationalist fervor"" towards its citizens and non-humans.  That's what made the Shadow infiltration, PSI Corp, and Clark's take over possible (and easy). A strong centralized military industrial complex leads naturally to government overreach and abuse. (Nazi Germany, Italy, some current events in the US and other western democracies.) Of course the check and balance on that is an engaged citizenry, ever vigilant in monitoring and correcting that abuse. Even then skillful leaders figure out how to manipulate the masses and quiet dissent, usually with vague threats of an unclear enemy. All in the guise of that same vigilant monitoring.  Post civil war John Sheridan would be the best person to speak for humanity given his profile. Mars pretty much saw him as their savior, true to his word. Same with any other colony that stayed independent. Half of Earth itself viewed him as a liberator who was willing to stand up to government corruption no matter the cost. The other half distrusted him but realized he wielded far too much power to be sidelined/ignored. Effectively they were discredited by his actions and forced to let him stay in the role. (Since, in a way, it allowed them to rebuild too. By using him as an example of the ""threat"" of contamination the aliens still posed to humanity)  Effectively Sheridan represented the cultural shift back to the pre-fascist government of the B5 universe. Him being the ambassador of Earth fits perfectly with the various stages of Earth politics through the run the show."

'Universe' chronological order (as shown in that guys website) is a nice thought, but to be honest River Of Souls, LotR, Call to Arms, Crusade and Lost Tales are not vital viewing for the major B5 characters, and a bit variable in quality. Feel free to watch after 'Sleeping In Light' instead. Maybe if you watch the series a second time, go chronological that time."
babylon5,1o4stq,DarrenGrey,1 point,Thu Oct 10 11:18:04 2013 UTC,Finish on Sleeping in Light and pretend the other stuff doesn't exist. Only if he really pines for more B5 stuff let him see the rest. Or send him to the books - The Shadow Within is quite fantastic.

First, it really bothered me that JMS, when pushed to respond to the JMS-centric notion, mentioned only crew and effects. No mention of other writers like, say, Harlan Ellison?   But this bothered me more.   I came in to correct outright fabrications and misleading information. Instead of simply addressing that, you chose to become acrimonious and accusatory and tried erroneously to take the high ground, which led in turn to questions about your right to use these images   What he MEANS is ""after you took the high ground, I decided to threaten you legally over a completely separate issue."" Had the entire argument been about the image use, that would be one thing, but what he did was tell them to shut up or he'd lean on them financially.  Frankly, I have never forgiven JMS for what he did to claudia christian, and I do hope she is asked for her side of it when she does her AMA soon.

babylon5,1nx47n,Ohmstar,2,Tue Oct 8 15:48:44 2013 UTC,I'm not siding with anyone here. But I will say... JMS.. He's one of those creators that I really have to work to separate their work from their personality. Babylon 5 is wonderful. Crusade had a lot of potential. But I've liked very little that he's done since then. And he straight up ruined my favorite fictional character when given the chance to write her. He seems more and more like a jerk every day.
babylon5,1nx47n,ArcaneShield,5,Tue Oct 8 14:30:07 2013 UTC,JMS has an ego the size of Babylon 5... on the other hand both groups seemed to be pretty rude asshats... not sure. I'll echo: neither.  Edit: I'm siding with behind the scenes on this one. JMS starts pulling out the copyright banhammer when he feels he's losing the argument. Serious dick move there pal.
babylon5,1nx47n,FKRMunkiBoi,12,Sun Oct 20 16:42:08 2013 UTC,"Funny, I never got the impression JMS was ""losing"" the argument.   BTS made a straw man argument, and started this whole ball rolling by slinging mud at JMS claiming he never gave credit to the other behind the scenes workers on the show. From my 20 years worth of memories following B5, JMS has always been incredibly generous with giving credit where credit was due.   If I were JMS, I'd be pretty pissed too if someone came along and essentially called me a glory-hog. BTS's opening argument was very inflammatory, derogative,  and just plain unwarranted.  I don't doubt JMS has an ego, hell everyone does to some extent. But to be maliciously insulted like he was, I'd take offense too if someone was featuring my work without the rights to do so and also making false insulting statements.   Is it surprising when you insult the owner of the playground, that they ask for you to stop playing with their toys that they own? He had never complained before he was insulted, and to ""pull out the copyright banhammer"" is completely within his rights, both legally and ethically. You don't want someone coming across a site that appears official or officially endorsed that insults you if you own the property.  I'm with JMS on this one. BTS made uncalled for inflammatory statements, JMS' reaction is perfectly justifiable here."
babylon5,1nx47n,ArcaneShield,2,Mon Oct 7 18:02:35 2013 UTC,"BTS never said that JMS was a glory hog or that he said it was a one man show, in fact if you read the post and his first comment, he was thanking JMS for letting the creative team be creative and the less hands on approach he gave them.  He was only attacking the widespread fan notion that B5 was JMS and only JMS, while ignoring the contributing work of the numerous other creative minds including the FX team themselves, to which he never implied JMS contributed to.  JMS put words into BTS' mouth and started the pissing match. BTS never had any fight with JMS, only with the ignorant fandom."
babylon5,1nx47n,chattymcgee,2,Mon Oct 7 19:41:55 2013 UTC,"Legally yes, ethically no. If someone was making money off his creation none of us would mind the legal threat. If he had brought up the legal threat at the beginning before his feelings were hurt few of us would mind. Bringing it up as a hammer to silence a critic, which is his threat, is offensive to our internet sensibilities."
babylon5,1nx47n,FKRMunkiBoi,8,Mon Oct 7 20:14:36 2013 UTC,"Funny, I feel the opposite. If JMS had come straight out and threatened to ""banhammer"", then I'd have agreed with you.  However, JMS responds to BTS's claims, and gives them a chance to redeem themselves and apologize. BTS chose to dig in their heels and continue insulting away at the property owner himself.  There's a difference between silencing a critic, and silencing a troll. BTS wasn't criticizing, they were blatantly lying by claiming JMS was hogging all the credit. That's a far different position than someone saying ""this show/episode sucked"" getting a banhammer. BTS lied. JMS responded. BTS continued to back up their lie. JMS brought out the banhammer after attempting to actually resolve the issue first.   So, your statement that it's ""offensive to our internet sensibilities"" is horribly misguided and terribly entitled. As the property owner, JMS does not need to take BTS's shit. He actually tried to resolve the issue, BTS wasn't willing to be professional about resolving the issue, then the ""banhammer"" was brought out. You really need to give JMS credit for NOT coming out swinging with the ""banhammer"". ""Banhammers"" exist for a reason, and it was not abused in the way you claim it was. The sense of entitlement I refer to is that your sensibility to the use of a ""banhammer"" was offended, without regard to the manner in which it was deployed."
babylon5,1nx47n,ArcaneShield,0,Mon Oct 7 19:57:59 2013 UTC,"JMS started the fight, putting words in BTS mouth, then went apeshit on him when he defended himself."
babylon5,1nx47n,FKRMunkiBoi,7,Mon Oct 7 20:16:50 2013 UTC,"JMS did not start the fight. Let me quote the very beginning of this article for you where BTS started this whole mess:   In case you haven’t guessed it yet, one of the things that come out of the interviews on B5Scrolls was that Joe Straczynski was far from being the only person who had creative input into most aspects of Babylon 5.  While that doesn’t do the myth of the single ‘Great Maker’ any favours (which some have difficulty letting go of)   Can you not see how this paints JMS in a negative light? BTS is trying to claim that the fact JMS wasn't the only person working hard is some kind of new revelation, as if we didn't know who else worked on the series until 20 years later after BTS comes around to ""enlighten"" us.   Sure, they compliment JMS and his contributions, but only after starting things off insultingly. This is what is called an ""underhanded compliment"". Complimenting him immediately after insulting him doesn't excuse the insult.  There was never any ""myth"" about a single Great Maker. Nobody has ever said that JMS was ""the only person who had creative input"". This, as JMS specifically points out during their exchange, is a straw man argument. BTS is just slinging bullshit to make it sound like they've unearthed some new discovery, at the expense of insulting JMS' longstanding history of giving credit where credit was due. BTS went way too far with their hyperbolic attempt to get clicks for their interviews. BTS started this fight. JMS does not go around picking fights. I don't see where you fail to see where he might be insulted by BTS's claims."
babylon5,1nx47n,manveruppd,1 point,Mon Oct 7 20:22:24 2013 UTC,"Arguably not even legally: BTS's use of the images looks like Fair Use to me, but there's no way any fansite could afford to go to court over it. The copyright banhammer is a bullying tactic in most cases where it's whipped out.  (which is not to say I'm siding with BTS - they've been slinging mud at JMS for years, and I don't know why they feel they need to as their content is fascinating, the interviews riveting and the concept art awesome!)"

Jan (I think her name was) mentioned that they have had this conversation before.  After 20 years, I'd imagine that JMS is getting a little sick of fans acting like this toward him.  If they had been humble and gracious and apologized for the misunderstanding, it wouldn't have gotten nasty, but they decided to be dicks to this guy who created this thing they're fans of.  I can definitely see why JMS would be cranky about this kind of thing."

Jonathan Franks directed a terrible live-action remake in '04.  A re-make of the series, Thunderbirds Are Go!, is due out 2015, with Peter Jackson's iTV on board.

Uh...can't agree. Reason being is that I think the last few season of DS9 were some of the best Star Trek made. I think TNG, DS9 and VOY will all three stand the test of time. TOS is getting old and I don't watch it much at all anymore but we have to admit TOS is the foundation and without it and the dedicated fans who kept the spirit alive long after cancelation, we would not have the franchise we have today.

A few years ago i really got into sci fi so i decided to watch TNG, Voyager, DS9, Enterprise, Tos  in that order.  TNG was great and lovable. Voyager sometimes made me want to smash my tv and put a curse on the writers.  DS9 fascinated me and i couldnt put it down.  It had so much more character development and so much darker in themes with amazing performances.  I loved Quark, Garek, Odo, Dukat, the fireball that was Kira, and the badassness of sisko.  Enterprise was Meh and i didnt find it as horrible as everyone said but it wasnt special either.  TOS was fun and although the pacing bored me at times it was also one of the fun things about it when i was drinking or smoking. Then i watched Babylon 5 and it blew me away.  By the 4th season i was at the edge of my seat binge watching it and raving to my girlfriend about how amazing it was. Then the 5th season happened and it lowered the amazingnes of it all.   After all of those Trek adventures DS9 was the one that i kept thinking about over and over again  and the one i have rewatched.  I would say overall i preferred Babylon 5 as it really engaged me in sci fi like no other show before.  When it comes to trek DS9 is my favorite followed by TNG.  when it comes to sci fi in general then Battlesta galactica is my all time favorite followed by Babylon 5"
babylon5,1njb6l,Qwyjibo_,7,Wed Oct 2 00:36:43 2013 UTC,"I love both shows but overall, I prefer DS9 due to, IMO, stronger writing, acting and characterization.  Babylon 5 is maybe the best planned TV show story I have ever watched. Obviously it's because JMS had full control and basically wrote all of it but still, you don't see that anymore. The entire story flowed almost perfectly (taking into account actor departures) with no hints of ""we're making this up as we go along"". The writing wasn't the greatest though. Among some of the great Sheridan/G'Kar speeches, the dialgoue was often times brutal and came off as artificial reading of lines. For me, it also lessend the impact some of the characters had.   I thought DS9 shined in that regard. There was far more depth to the characters and the show took some effective risks with some of its stories. Visually, it was clearly more impressive as well.  Also, the first 3/4 of the first season of Babylon 5 was really hard to sit through. DS9 never had that prolonged of a lull."

I rewatch both series yearly, and DS9 definitely ages better.  However the story/writing/character development of B5 blows every other sci-fi show ever made out of the water."
babylon5,1njb6l,batstooge,2,Tue Oct 1 22:28:43 2013 UTC,"production quality, maybe, but I'll put Andreas Katsulas (god rest his soul) over anyone on DS9 any time."
babylon5,1njb6l,Coarch,3,Wed Oct 2 20:27:46 2013 UTC,hard to disagree but as a whole I still have to give it to DS9 for overall acting.
babylon5,1njb6l,fivestarcam,2,Wed Oct 2 22:10:54 2013 UTC,"I have to bring up Marc Alaimo, he made a genocidal mad man, well not like able, but relatable in a sense that we got to see him as a person and not just a sci-fi Hitler."

babylon5,1njb6l,HoopyFreud,3,Wed Oct 2 17:13:22 2013 UTC,"I agree with what was stated in the article on every point. The sisko over Sheridan is also valid, if only because of the leadership change between season 1 and 2.  That said, I think DS9 will hold up better in 10 years aesthetically than B5. I re-watched B5 recently and the computer animation just looks very dated. I wish someone would do the TNG style blueray update for it and reanimate all the CGI.  I think the biggest flaw with DS9 was the horrible religion subplot running through the last season. B5 had the pretty meh psychic story line but Kai-Winn and Dukat was just some of the worst television I've had to put up with.  The best thing about having DS9 and B5 is that when you watch one and wished for more, you simply watch the other series!"
babylon5,1njb6l,StarFuryG7,2,Tue Oct 1 23:17:55 2013 UTC,"Personally, I adore both series. They're honestly my favorite two sci fi sagas ever created. I almost feel bad that B5 and DS9 come into conflict so much, seeing as how they're both top freaking notch."

The Prophets spend seven years being inscrutable when the big mission the whole time was ""throw the One Ring, err, the One Book into the volcano.""  Enjoyed DS9, still quote DS9 once in a while, I'm glad it was made.  Liked Garak, liked some of Sisko's exchanges with the aliens, enjoyed Quark schooling the Vulcan in logic (she needed to rethink her actions in light of the Third Rule of Acquisition).  But there's no way I'd watch DS9 all the way through again, which I have done with B5. If I was going to show DS9 to someone who'd never seen it, I might pick maybe 20-30 of the better episodes and watch those, skipping the rest."

babylon5,1n1euo,FTFY_Cat6,5,Tue Sep 24 18:42:39 2013 UTC,"My opinion of course, but the following selections focus on the arcs, while keeping characterization too:   Midnight On The Firing Line - It's a bit rough, but works better as a pilot than the pilot does. Remind them that the show starts a bit choppy, but gets immensely better. Born To The Purple - Good Londo story. Parliament Of Dreams - Spiritual musings with good Londo and G'kar stuff. Then that final scene. Mind War - Bester + First ones, need I say more? And The Sky Full Of Stars - Great Sinclair episode, advances the arc and demonstrates this isn't some kind of weak Trek rip-off. Maybe Believers, Deathwalker or By Any Means Necessary - Not the most vital episodes, but fairly solid stuff. See how your friends are enjoying it - if they're a bit bored of standalone stuff, maybe skip these. Signs And Portents - of course, just don't build it up too much before they see it. Legacies through to the end of the season - it's all good from here on.   EDIT - First version done on my phone, so maybe not the clearest."
babylon5,1n1euo,co_fragment,2,Tue Sep 24 18:00:00 2013 UTC,"Tricky one. I managed to get my non-sci fi loving wife to sit through the entire of season 1, so you may be able to get them too as well. I actually like season 1, but do admit it can be very ropey.  Easy option is to start them on season2, but they will regret that when it comes to the babylon 4 episodes.  No real answer to your question, I know, but if you do only parts of season 1 then make sure you also include babylon squared and war as well  Edit: Mind War"
babylon5,1n1euo,aeloen,2,Tue Sep 24 17:40:38 2013 UTC,"start with episode one.  it has it all.  the opening sequence is an attack, then you hav the ambassadors scramble to deal with the situation.  it sets up everyone's roles and you can start to take sides."

babylon5,1n1euo,fzammetti,2,Tue Sep 24 19:46:46 2013 UTC,"Where to start? Where to start?  My suggestion would be to skimp a lot on the middle of season 1. You don't have to do a full take on the first watch-through. As you mentioned there are quite a few weak episodes in season 1. It would be a pity if they stopped watching halfway through season 1 because of a few bad apples.  Anyway, here's my suggested order of watching:  Start off by watching 'Midnight on the Firing Lane', 'Soul Hunter' and 'Born to the Purple' (episodes 1, 2 and 3) as they really set up the atmosphere for the station and it's inhabitants.  Skip episode 4.  Watch episode 5 'The Parliament of Dreams' as it provides an insight into the different species and cultures on the station and how it affects 'our' characters.  Mind War, episode 6, is a bit of a tough one. If you want them to just enjoy a new scifi show I'd say skip it and rewatch it later if they really enjoy the show. If you want to hook them then just watch this one straightaway. It has Bester and while not a great episode it is an important introduction to a great character.  Skip 7 and watch episode 8 'And the Sky Full of Stars'. Again, it might be not the best episode in the series but it shows Battle of the Line and the Minbari war from the viewpoint of Cmdr. Sinclair.  Episode 13 'Signs and Portents' for the reasons you already mentioned. It's a good episode to see how they like the series so far. I think this episode is a pretty good indicator of what most non-arc episodes are like. If they don't like this episode they'll probably stop watching somewhere around the second half of season 2.  'TKO' and 'Grail' are obvious episodes to skip.  So the last question would be: do you continue from episode 17 'Legacies' and skip episode 16 'Eyes' or not? I would watch 'Eyes' simply because it shows more of Ivanova then we previously had.  Of course the rest of season 1 is all normal episodes and shouldn't be skipped.  Do comment if you disagree or if I've overlooked something important."
babylon5,1n1euo,arquebus_x,2,Tue Sep 24 21:42:15 2013 UTC,"A lot of people poo-poo S1, but they forget that most of us fans, at least those of us who watched it during its initial run, watched it straight through and we were hooked early on - enough to keep watching anyway. I don't suggest anyone ever do it any other way. Why would you? It's how it was meant to be watched.   There's a question of age too... I tried getting my 13yr old son into it and it just doesn't fly... he simply can't get past the FX & rough acting in parts... and why should he? He's used to shows and movies that are measurably better in most ways other than story, and it does take most of S1 to start to get past that. Us 30+ folks remember when more shows & movies were of similar quality, so it doesn't bother us as much. Same problem as video games: I can tell him how fun hours of Donkey Kong was in an arcade, but it's not Halo quality, which is all he knows and therefore what he expects.   I think the point I'm trying to make here is simply that if someone watches S1 and doesn't like it, especially if they're younger, don't bother trying to force the issue. It's probably not going to work. We all know S1 has flaws and weaknesses, yet we all wound up fans anyway, and some of us even find S1 has grown on us over time... but if it doesn't hook someone like it did all of us then trying to contrive circumstances to help someone get hooked despite that isn't a great idea IMO."
babylon5,1n1euo,nativefloridian,2,Wed Sep 25 05:34:10 2013 UTC,"Start at the beginning and go to the end. Every episode, with the possible slight exception of TKO, is relevant. Everyone seems to hate on Grail but it's a very important episode, considering it mirrors A Late Delivery from Avalon."

babylon5,1n1euo,Chicken2nite,1 point,Wed Sep 25 02:46:00 2013 UTC,"I got my mom into the show like a year ago or so. She doesn't really like science fiction, but I knew she'd appreciate the hell out of the show (and she ultimately did). But knowing how season 1 is, I knew it would be some project, wading through those first episodes while she gets used to it. But I don't believe in skipping episodes or anything (yes even TKO), because even if the episodes stink, you still need to see them to become familiar with the characters and get to know them. I doubt anyone who skimmed episodes or started straight on season 2 cared very much that Garibaldi had been shot in the back.  So I was just straight with her, told her that the first season was really clunky, it has its moments, but is a pretty rocky road for a while. But it'll become amazing later and you'll be able to forgive this stuff that came before.  That's the impression that you really need to give. That hey, you wouldn't waste there time on a terrible TV show, just ask them to trust you and go along with the ride for a while. Though this means you pretty much have to watch it with them, you can't really trust them to watch it on their own. But that has its own quality, since you can kind of crack jokes at the dumber stuff, O'Hare's bad acting or whatever.  I don't know why everyone always suggests skipping Soul Hunter, it only foreshadows the Chrysalis, emphasizes the importance Minbari place on souls, Sinclair's future, probably more that I forgot about."
babylon5,1n1euo,learhpa,1 point,Wed Sep 25 02:46:35 2013 UTC,"This gives me an idea:  It would be a massive undertaking, but it would be cool to clip together all the scenes that are pertinent to the overall storyline, and remove scenes that have nothing to do with the plot. For example, the scenes with Sinclair's girlfriend wouldn't be necessary, nor would the scene with Talia and Kosh (because she left the show).  And a few of the stand alone episodes have nothing to do with anything.    Like I said, it would be a massive undertaking, but how cool would it be to have a concise show that follows the main arc without all the missteps in between (due to budget, people leaving the show, script inconsistencies, etc)?"
babylon5,1n1euo,TZath,1 point,Fri Sep 27 20:13:56 2013 UTC,"I watched the series entirely out of order, that is to say I watched season 5 as it aired concurrent to the first four seasons in mon-fri syndication in grade 9.  I had also seen In The Beginning which aired before this, which along with the scatter shot clip nature of the season five opening, gave the definite impression that this is something to take notice of and that all the pieces matter.  Later, in order to get move the arc forward, I tried to create a playlist of episodes for new viewers to watch somewhat out of order in order to move the plot forward.  It was some time ago that I did this, and in so doing you miss out on some of the smaller character moments (such as 3.02 Convictions where G'Kar and Londo are stuck in an elevator after a bomb goes off, which was a great moment for G'Kar).    So you basically have 12 episodes each for seasons one and two with 16 for season three, ordered not simply chronologically but instead thematically so that the Sinclair storyline dominates the first group and the telepaths dominate the second group.  I suppose I could've done this more, with holding back on the two part A Voice in the Wilderness and maybe even Babylon Squared until War Without End, but I didn't go to that extreme with it.  I was pretty much of the opinion that there weren't any episodes which could be skipped for season four, and in skipping episodes in the first three seasons you undoubtedly lose something, but I felt that while you lost some meat by trimming the fat that a new viewer wouldn't be lost from not knowing what was skipped and might be more likely to stick with the show rather than be distracted by a sub-par episode that didn't seem to go anywhere.

The language is not Narn, or Human, or Centauri, or Gaim or Minbari.   It speaks in the language of hope; It speaks in the language of trust; It speaks in the language of strength, and the language of compassion.   It is the language of the heart and the language of the soul. But always, it is the same voice. It is the voice of our ancestors, speaking through us, and the voice of our inheritors, waiting to be born.   It is the small, still voice that says: We are one.   No matter the blood; No matter the skin; No matter the world; No matter the star; We are one. No matter the pain; No matter the darkness; No matter the loss; No matter the fear; We are one.   Here, gathered together in common cause. We agree to recognize this singular truth, and this singular rule: That we must be kind to one another, because each voice enriches us and ennobles us, and each voice lost diminishes us.   We are the voice of the Universe, the soul of creation, the fire that will light the way to a better future.  We are one. ""  G’Kar Babylon 5"

Something set during the show would more than likely have the player as either a Ranger or an Earthforce officer. If playing as Earthforce, you could choose your faction as 'loyal' or 'AWOL' with storylines for each. I can see some good story arcs for 'loyal' Earthforce officers who slowly come to realize what's happening and switch sides, but I can't see a storyline where you could switch sides from awol/ranger to loyal earthforce.  Possible unlockable character type of a Psi-Cop.  Or, if we just have one story to progress through, start as a loyal earthforce officer doing a few standard missions until you begin to realize that the things you are doing are hovering really close to the line of being illegal. Go to Babylon 5 and talk with the NPC command staff, realize that you are now branded a traitor and are on the run. Do a couple more missions that reveal more about the Big Picture and the galactic war that humanity knows nothing about. You and your crew enlist with the rangers (or at least start working alongside them) and help stabilise the galaxy, somehow managing to survive, and then the long hard task of cleaning up the mess that you fled earlier?

The show would have Narn, Centauri and others, but no Minbari. I think the Minbari have been sufficiently explored, but I would like to see the Narn and Centauri dealing with other races before the time of Babylon 5.   *It would have an entirely new cast.   Perhaps the only return would be the actress who played Deathwalker, she would be older in the past. The Shadows and the Vorlons are still around. Let's admit it, they are everyone's favourite. It is possible the the Dilgar war was prompted by the Shadows to test the waters for their return.

Imagine how many B5-esque quality shows we'd have without the networks being so crappy!  I've introduced friends to the series with my DVD collection. It's definitely possible to convert people. But Netflix would make it so much easier. Alas, it may never be."
babylon5,1ln5w4,DarrenGrey,11,Wed Sep 4 09:43:02 2013 UTC,"One bad thing about JMS... which I suppose is a good thing in some cases... is that he's exceedingly stubborn.  If things aren't done EXACTLY the way he wants, he poo-poo's it.  I think that serves him very well when writing, or directing, but hurts him significantly on the business side.  I don't think I can point to any specifics, but I remember over the years hearing about his dealing with studios and while it's undeniable he had a lot of crap to deal with, I remember on many occasions thinking ""gee, if he gave in JUST A LITTLE here, things would work out"".  I get the sense that's the case here too.  I mean, if Netflix, for example, came to him and said ""gee, we really need a sci-fi original and we think a B5 series, whether a reboot or a tangential story, would be a perfect fit""... is he going to say no because it won't draw enough new fans?  Come on JMS, gimme a break!  I do get what he's saying, and I think there's a lot of truth to it... people flipping through channels and catching the Shadows destroying of the Narn outpost in Quadrant 37 would probably grab A LOT of people and would build the fan base and perhaps lead to more original stories being told.  But if that's what he's hanging his hat on exclusively, I think that's a big mistake.    I'm not suggesting he half-ass anything, far from it... B5 needs to be treated with the utmost respect and done right in whatever form it takes... but if the alternative is doing nothing with it because you're waiting for the EXACT, PERFECT thing?  Please, JMS, back off the stubbornness just this once!"
babylon5,1ln5w4,fzammetti,5,Tue Sep 3 16:54:05 2013 UTC,"JMS is already making deals with Netflix. He's signed to make an original series for them, ""Sense8"", with the Wachowskis. I think you underestimate his business sense."
babylon5,1ln5w4,philwelch,8,Wed Sep 4 02:32:39 2013 UTC,"Netflix is not an option because of WB, so this entire rant is pointless. WB is starting their own channel and pulling all their stuff from Netflix, so the responsibility is on them now, not JMS. The only way we will see anything else from the B5 universe is if WB is somehow convinced to do it. It's entirely out of JMS' hands."
babylon5,1ln5w4,Stupid_Ned_Stark,6,Tue Sep 3 18:03:01 2013 UTC,THANK YOU! This has nothing at all to do with JMS being stubborn. It is 100% about Warner Bros. having control and keeping B5 in a dark corner where fans can't access it unless they buy the DVDs.

babylon5,1ln5w4,edcba54321,11,Tue Sep 3 15:32:56 2013 UTC,"I thought it was about a reboot of the series, too.  Unlike you, however, I thought it would be a good idea.  It was amazing how much of what JMS wanted made it on screen, but let's face it, the original show was mired in constant threats of cancellation, budget shortages, casting changes, etc.  I adore the original, but Television is a very different place today than it was in the 90s.  Now we have series like Game of Thrones and the new Battlestar Galactica that could plot out story arcs that lasted multiple seasons with far less fear of corporate tampering.  Babylon 5 was ahead of its time, and I think its time is now."
babylon5,1ln5w4,Comrade_Beric,2,Tue Sep 3 16:07:19 2013 UTC,"Bad examples imho.  Game of Thrones can plot out their story over multiple seasons because they have the guide of the yet to be finished book series to go off of, but Battlestar Galactica wasn't very well plotted and wasn't really done so in advance.  It, like Lost, Star Wars, or 24, was loosely plotted from the beginning and sort of made it up as they went along.  Not only that, but there was a constant struggle especially in season three with the network wanting more self contained episodes, which hurt the show in my opinion.  Them going from 13 episodes in season one to 20 in two and three (with four having a nice long break due to the writers strike which helped them creatively) led to some substandard stories as well as a big convoluted mess for the second half of season three.  With them not knowing what was going to happen with them getting a season five, they chose to end it at season four because of Ron Moore's experience with ST:TNG going on too long to the point where they weren't the show they used to be.  Vince Gilligan made a similar decision with Breaking Bad, which was why the final season of both shows were spread out over two years (writers strike notwithstanding, the networks likewise wanted to have the shows on their balance sheets for both fiscal years to show off the ratings without having to pay for another season).  While Game of Thrones is getting record setting ratings for HBO, they're only being renewed one season at a time.  If they get cancelled early for some odd reason, fans at least have the books, and if the author dies or doesn't publish TWOW fast enough, the showrunners at least know the ending that they're driving towards so that they could come up with something along those lines on their own.  One would think that by the time that the show catches up with the books, the budget for both spectacle and actors will be going up, which means that HBO might have to dig deep to see the story to completion.  They only have the actors signed through season seven or so, which would leave them with anywhere from one to three seasons short of completing the story on their existing contracts.  That is, assuming that there are any original actors from season one still alive at the end of the series ;)  I do agree with the sentiment that B5 was ahead of its time, but I don't think a reboot in the way of a rehash of 2258-2262 would necessarily be the way I'd want it to go, nor do I think that such a series would be guaranteed a five season run, just as no existing series is guaranteed a five season run on any network.  Not even Star Trek is guaranteed a five season run anymore.  Counting from the air date of season four, we're nearly the point at which the actors would've aged as much as they portrayed themselves in Sleeping In Light.  I would think that any continuation would be taking place at some point around that time, as in past the point of the existing media.  With many of the actors and characters dead, they would be able to avoid recasting characters and focus on making new ones."
babylon5,1ln5w4,Chicken2nite,1 point,Thu Sep 5 02:05:42 2013 UTC,What about a CG revamp like they did with Star Trek TOS?
babylon5,1ln5w4,Dayanx,3,Tue Sep 3 21:52:48 2013 UTC,I was informed by someone who was in a position to know that the model data for the original CGI shots no longer exists so re-doing the SF would require a complete remodel of every shot of the series.  Apparently there's no one who thinks that investment would be worth it.
babylon5,1ln5w4,ChrisAndersen,1 point,Wed Sep 4 00:01:32 2013 UTC,3D scan the model or contact the old Revelle people. They had Furies in the untold tales a few years ago too. Are those gone?
babylon5,1ln5w4,Dayanx,1 point,Wed Sep 4 00:15:33 2013 UTC,"Having the models is one thing, using those models to recreate shot for shot every battle from 110 episodes of television would be an lengthy endeavor, which they did for Star Trek TOS at a not insignificant expense.  Considering that B5 had many more effects shots than ST:TOS, it would likely cost more to remodel and relight and redestruct all of those ships, and considering that while Paramount considers Star Trek to be a big franchise for the studio, Warner Bros doesn't feel the same way, which is why when JMS refused to continue Lost Tales on the shoestring budget for DVD release, Warner Bros didn't think twice about shelving the franchise rather than put the money in to make a feature film (which JMS had already refused to recast the already established characters for, preventing them from adding a bankable film actor as a lead).  Also, for composite shots (where actors and cg elements are on screen at the same time) like Londo watching the mass drivers do their work to Narn in the season two finale, the original plates used for the live action portion weren't kept, meaning all there is is the final shot which simply is what it is."

These days people are generally fans of the new BSG, Firefly, and are vaguely acquainted with TNG. Getting someone used to BSG/Firefly to then go and sit through Season 1 of B5 with its sometimes spotty production values and uneven acting is really tough - it's a lot of hours to sink in before all of the set up and piece-placing starts to pay off. Season 2 gets a lot easier to go through but it takes a while to get there. Right now doing a re-watch and getting my SO into it and it took them until half-way through season 2 to get into it, but now they are more excited to watch the next episode than I am! On the flipside, tried getting a friend into it and he stopped after Soul Hunter (S1E2)....  Before there are any re-makes the original needs to pick up popularity - how can we help with that? How can we get people into it more easily?"
babylon5,1ln5w4,karathas,6,Tue Sep 3 15:45:43 2013 UTC,"Before there are any re-makes the original needs to pick up popularity - how can we help with that? How can we get people into it more easily?   The answer (despite JMS' downplay): get it on Netflix.   It would open the series up to much larger potential audience. From there it would allow existing fans to better persuade people to give it a try without too much commitment. With the entire series online and easily accessible existing fans could basically do a grassroots lobby amongst themselves to get their friends to watch it. They could then work around Season 1 weaknesses by offering a streamlined arc significant viewing list for friends that just don't want to go there.  As it sits now the show is practically non-existant online. The only place you can find legitimate episodes is TheWB.com. Even then it's only Season 1 and 5 episodes of Season 2. Which is quite honestly (as  huge fan of B5) a poor showing for getting new people into it.   Because the entire model requires people to buy the DVD's to get the show many people won't give it a try due to the upfront costs. Period. But if it's at their finger tips and costs nothing it's far easier for existing fans to persuade their friends to give it a go. From there they could justify buying the DVD/Downloads if it truly makes it mark on them. From there it gives JMS, who already has an in with Netflix (with Sense8), the chance to lobby for more."
babylon5,1ln5w4,thegenregeek,4,Tue Sep 3 16:38:38 2013 UTC,"I agree. It used to be on Netflix but got bumped to dvd only for some reason - which is far too much trouble to watch a show you're unsure of. It's on less reputable site (like project free tv) but that doesn't let you easily get your friends to watch it when everyone does things on Netflix these days. TheWB also skipped a random episode of S1 (Believers) which is one of the most emotionally powerful ones.   Was it WB who pulled it from Netflix, or was there some other reason? We need something like that to try and pull a Firefly to get its popularity back up. Based on the 20yr convention there is still a ton of popularity, it's just not public and not growing... 54k people on r/firefly and 2k on r/babylon5 is very depressing. I really like Firefly, but B5 has so much more to offer (clearly a huge fan as well)."
babylon5,1ln5w4,karathas,2,Tue Sep 3 17:04:07 2013 UTC,"Short answer was historically speaking B5 was always a very decent seller on DVD, and I'd guess WB doesn't want to cannibalize their DVD sales if it's available on streaming."

We could avoid using any of the OG characters by purposefully keeping the Minbari mysterious (more Vorlon-like in their aloofness), the Centauri and Narn with different representatives and characters, and the Earth Alliance with different officers and - importantly - civilian politicians and construction crew that would be essential to the project.   Flashbacks to the Earth-Minbari War, Dilgar War, as well as domestic terrorist attacks would help fill out the space-pew-pew, while the immense drama that goes with any major construction project would be in play on an interstellar stage.   Moreover, with the outlying commercial relations necessary to construct the many Babylon Stations, we may get a chance to see more interactions with different planets and aliens. Expand the B5 universe to show how there really was a lot of chaos throughout the galaxy indifferent to the Earth-Minbari War that the B5 stations could stop.   That particular avenue (with construction workers and B-Officers R&R-ing on nearby planets) would help create worlds of different financial and social classes, luring in the diversity from the Firefly series.   Throughout it all, though, would be a sense of aspiring towards hope. Like BSG with its ""grittiness"", there is a lot of cynicism towards peace between aliens and humans. But, folks have to keep going. Past the destruction of B1-3, and especially after the 4th one freaking disappears to the past.

Once it's out of WB's hands, a dedicated streaming website could be set up for the show and movies. Charge a small annual fee for access and membership, run some advertisements on the page and advertisements at the beginning, middle and end of a episode to turn a profit.  I'd pay $15 a year for the next 10 years if I could have access to B5 and help generate new quality B5 content ( 5-10 min shorts to show at festivals, rebuild and demo 3-D model database). Just look at what has happened to the other sci-fi IP's- they all get rebooted or prequeled because they were not written well enough to stand-up to a new audience/generation.  If there is a feasible way to buy B5, it would take only 50,000 fans around the world to generate $750,000 for the first year, which does not include revenue generated from advertisement. That would cover renting servers, employing a small business team and media staff."

Lyta as the Vorlon WMD and becoming leader of the rebel teeps was always intended though.

babylon5,1kypmk,ActionFlank,1 point,Sat Aug 24 19:57:36 2013 UTC,"Honestly I never had a problem with it, but then I watched season five as it was airing week to week alongside seasons one to four which had finally entered syndication which was the first time they had aired the series where I was since season one, which I had found quite off putting at the time.  Watching it that way, season five didn't seem to have a noticeable drop in quality compared to what I was used to, although at the time I was given and determined to like the show/give it a chance.    When I last rewatched the franchise, the real dip in quality was with Crusade. Part of that would be due to studio interference/episodes airing out of order, but part of it was the drop in production values, in particular the x files spoof which was made by a first time director and it showed.  Season five had the strength of the cast as well as a few great one off episodes (the aforementioned Day of the Dead and the day in the life of the janitors/maintenance techs).  I'm just sad that we never got (onscreen) closure for the telepath war.  I really enjoyed the Centauri Prime trilogy at the time, as well as the history of the psi corps books, but even those were focused on Bester and skipped past the telepath war, which was somewhat annoying, although I'm sure if crusade had continued they'd have gotten around to filling in many of the blanks in the timeline.  OK also sad that they did the Lockley lost tale instead of a Lando or Garibaldi one.  Wasn't a fan of the space exorcism."

babylon5,1jyqcu,thegenregeek,6,Fri Aug 9 03:34:13 2013 UTC,"You also have to consider the context. He'd just spent the better part of, I recall, around 4-5 years trying to get to this point. Along the way he'd been told by numerous executives that no SF series could ever succeed if it wasn't Star Trek. That was the excuse practically every time they passed on trying to make it. Now he had a featurette on the SciFi Channel's premiere news show, with a chance to truly vent and share his thoughts.  The funny thing is this is actually about a year before the DS9 happened. So the angst isn't as much as it probably became during that point in his life. (He seems more reserved about it all now though)"
babylon5,1jyqcu,lumpking69,0,Fri Aug 9 04:55:37 2013 UTC,"no SF series could ever succeed if it wasn't Star Trek.    They weren't really wrong. The show was plagued with problems. Every season the show came with in an inch of getting canceled (and the later seasons suffered greatly from it).   It certainly wasn't a failure, but no success either. It limped along for a very long time and continued to limp after it was dead."
babylon5,1jyqcu,thegenregeek,3,Fri Aug 9 06:57:10 2013 UTC,"Considering the series did over a $1 billion dollars in revenue, with $500 million dollars from DVD sales (and cost roughly $110 million to make), I think you could call it a success.  In an interview JMS gave at one point in 2004 he mentioned that there was a contractual requirement that the series be profitable from day one.  Because Warners wasn't going to invest if they couldn't be certain of that.  In fact JMS mentioned all this because Warners used a bit of Hollywood accounting to claim the show made less money that it did. (as in the show was $80 million in the hole in 2004)  Any near cancellation issues came from the management of PTEN while they were trying to transition to the WB. In fact that specifically was why the series was cancelled at the end of Season 4 before TNT picked it up. As for Crusade, it was cancelled due to a change in direction at TNT when they realized that Babylon 5 audiences weren't likely to watch other shows. (Based on ratings from B5 Season 5).  Hell, Crusade was cancelled well before the first episode even aired. Legend of the Rangers was aired by Scifi Channel on Superbowl Sunday, following a limited promotional effort.  I mean if you're not a fan or feel there were quality issues, fine, but your information is wrong if you feel the first series wasn't considered a success as far as Hollywood/Warners was concerned. And the other series attempts met with the same bias he initially had when trying to get B5 made. That since it wasn't Trek it couldn't succeed, despite B5 proving that wasn't the case."
babylon5,1jyqcu,lumpking69,0,Fri Aug 9 07:01:06 2013 UTC,"I remember that interview. It was the DVD's that made WB $500 million dollars. AFAIK, there are no numbers for how profitable the show was. But its safe to say it wasn't boat loads of money considering how many times the show was almost canceled. You don't almost cancel a good show, you almost cancel a show that can be easily replaced by a new show that could do better. You don't almost cancel a success or a hit."
babylon5,1jyqcu,cyberleadr,1 point,Fri Aug 9 07:26:52 2013 UTC,"Can you link to a source about B5 being almost cancelled?  I've never heard that before and I'm not finding anything about it now.  As far as I know, the only reason they had to move to TNT for season 5 is because PTEN went bust, despite Babylon 5 being their most profitable show.  Seasons 1-4 were syndicated, and syndicated shows stick around as long as they make money, assuming their production company doesn't go out of business.  Even without as many viewers as star trek, B5 eps cost about $500,000 per ep, while Star Trek: Enterprise cost about 3-5 million an ep.  I don't have numbers on DS9 unfortunately.  Why would TNT pick it up if it was such a risk?  Regardless of financial info, I would still disagree with your assertion that Babylon 5 didn't succeed.  It set out to do exactly what it was meant to.  It was good science fiction, it was good television, it took an adult approach, it looked like nothing else on television and it told it's originally intended 5 year story featuring seasonal story arcs a full two years before BTVS aired.  Sounds like success to me."

It's like Babylon 5, at its absolute best, for ~80 hours.   Beyond that? Battlestar Galactica (2004's reimagining), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.  B5's the closest thing I've ever come across to those series. They're bloody wonderful."

Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica are givens.  Non-SciFi: Luther, The Tudors, The Borgias, Eastbound & Down, and The Three Stooges. The latter I watch daily; I've seen each short at least 100 times. :)  Edit: I should add, I just recently got into B5, too. I'm powering through S1, and it's getting better. The first episode was nearly intolerable. But I'm committed to the entire series."

I was pretty excited to see His Grace the Duke of Suffolk play Superman. And Jeremy Northam's performance as Thomas Moore was one of my favorite of all time. So incredibly underrated.   Havn't seen The Borgias yet, but I am a fan of the other flavor, Borgia. I don't know how he is portrayed in The Borgias, but in Borgia Cesare Borgia is a total badass.  Oh and add Rome to the list. Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus are my second favorite duo after Londo and G'kar."

And the only one who could stop him would be Arthur! :P  I would say Amelia Earhart, but I think her disappearance would be more of a Vorlon move.  If they would take anyone from Earth, it would be the great minds like Einstein, Aristotle, Confucius, etc.."
babylon5,1j4nqv,SgSpecial180,3,Fri Jul 26 23:25:29 2013 UTC,"The Soul Hunters didn't utilize a morality scale on who they took though.  For example, had the Vorlons not been the ones to blast her out of space, I'm sure that they would have taken Jha'dur's soul given that she was the greatest mass murderer in history.  They were drawn to greatness, those who were set apart from their peers, regardless of whether or not they were good or evil."
babylon5,1j4nqv,SgSpecial180,4,Fri Jul 26 23:36:45 2013 UTC,"True. My thoughts on Amelia were more that the Vorlons abduct, while the Hunters wait for a person to die move in. Because of her disappearance that makes me think that the Vorlons took her in mid air, plane and all. I rather think that then have her die and the Hunters came to her."
babylon5,1j4nqv,Circuitfire,3,Fri Jul 26 23:46:38 2013 UTC,"Though they would have to have a reason to abduct her.  We all know why they took Sebastian, because he was a perfect tool to test those who were to serve the Vorlons.  The only thing I can think of would be that she was part of the Vorlons' experiments in creating Human Telepaths."
babylon5,1j4nqv,iamzeph,5,Fri Jul 26 23:52:54 2013 UTC,"My theory would be that they would take her to better understand the sometimes rebellious nature of Humanity. They guided our evolution to accommodate their philosophy of Order and Obedience, and this is reflected throughout our history in the form of governments, laws, rules, social ranks, etc. However there are anomalies, those that refuse to conform to societies 'norms'. I imagine this would cause the Vorlons to worry, and they would want to take some of these rebellious people to study to understand why they do not follow rules. I think Amelia is a good example of that."

babylon5,1iq5wi,atreides78723,7,Sun Jul 21 01:18:20 2013 UTC,"I'm not too entirely sure it would have been that different.  I rag on Jankowski as much as the next guy, but he made a decision based on the situation at hand.  In the same position, someone from the Federation may have done something similar to protect the life of his or her crew.  The Federation has the benefit if being much more advanced than the Earth Alliance.  It's easy to hold yourself back when you have comparable or better tech than anyone else.  When you're outclassed or outgunned, being more aggressive may be the only thing that saves your ass.  And Earth was very, VERY outclassed.  Seriously...  Minbari scanners almost took out an Earth ship.  Jankowski didn't make the best move, but I bet many in the same situation would have done something similar.  The only thing that could have saved them would be if the Earth Captain had thought ""if I were in their situation, what would I do?"" and come to the reasonable conclusion that scanning for information might be it and that could be what was happening.  But that's a pretty big risk, especially for a people who spent years fighting the Dilgar/Space Nazis..."
babylon5,1iq5wi,the_raptor,18,Sun Jul 21 02:29:25 2013 UTC,"I entirely blame the Minbari. For a supposedly ""advanced"" race they sure seem stuck in a Minbari-centric mindset and don't consider how other races might react to their traditions. How the hell are people you have never met before supposed to guess that gun-ports open is a gesture of peaceful intentions?  Imagine if an earth navy had a tradition of closely sailing past potential enemies with their guns aimed and ready. It is begging for a misunderstanding.  P.S. And a TOS era Federation ship would have probably done the same. It was only in TNG that Federation captains became honourable-stupid."
babylon5,1iq5wi,atreides78723,10,Sun Jul 21 07:40:31 2013 UTC,"Some friends of mine and I have had this theory for a while that the Minbari are actually pretty immature and stupid about the realities of war and conflict and have only been protected by their extremely advanced technology.  A lot of their traditions and philosophies would be discarded or rethought if they ever fought someone of comparable or only slightly better technology.  In the show, we only really see them fight Earth, who they far outclass so their stupidity is not a detriment, and the Shadows, who are so much more advanced that their stupidity is not costing them significantly."
babylon5,1iq5wi,Chicken2nite,2,Sun Jul 21 14:11:38 2013 UTC,"I know there is a lot of peripheral works that point out that while the Minbari had supremacy in space they were inexperienced on the ground.  They were basically set up to combat the Shadows, which from my understanding fought a purely space-based war, which left them completely unprepared for planetary theaters of war against races that made war an art form.  As to whether or not they would abandon their traditions and philosophies, I don't think they would.  Had the tables been turned and the Earth Alliance was at a level to give the Minbari major difficulties in both space and on the ground, the Minbari would have fought on the same way they had before right down to the last of the Warrior Caste."
babylon5,1iq5wi,MercurialMithras,6,Mon Jul 22 00:27:49 2013 UTC,"Or if Sheridan had accepted the offer of XO and done the job properly, instead of the yes-man feeding the fears of the CO who was in over his head.  He may well have had to border insubordination and could well have been prevented from preventing the disaster from occuring, but it certainly wouldn't have gone any worse, although the stain on Sheridan's record would've drastically changed his career path.  One of my favorite moments from the novelization that I only vaguely remember was where Londo was describing a chance encounter between Sheridan and Sinclair in a shuttle on their way to earth in which Londo reflects on neither character remembering it, yet old, drunken Londo is recounting the dialogue exchanged."
babylon5,1iq5wi,BaltoSquadGuy,4,Sun Jul 21 01:57:50 2013 UTC,Or that.  Though I don't see Sheridan having to step in and keeping Jankowski from making a boneheaded decision hurting his career.  This is especially true since Jankowski already has one black mark against him even though the tribunal cleared him of the Omega Incident.  If there is one thing I have learned from being in the military it is that being cleared of something does not equal being complete absolved of it.

babylon5,1htv8i,ChrisWF,8,Mon Jul 8 06:15:22 2013 UTC,"I love that story from Londo, it is one of his more personal moments:  Something my father said. He was old, very old at the time. I went into his room, and he was sitting alone in the dark, crying. So I asked him what was wrong, and he said, ""My shoes are too tight, but it doesn't matter, because I have forgotten how to dance.""  I never understood what that meant until now. My shoes are too tight, and I have forgotten how to dance.    Londo by himself was brilliant, however it the relationships he forged that made him even better:  Londo + Garibaldi Londo + G'Kar Londo + Vir  The three biggies above (not in order, of course).   with Michael: It is good to have friends, is it not Mr Garibalir...even if only for a little while.  With G'kar ..... too many scenes to mention however the scene where they are trapped in the lift together is probably my favourite.  With Vir... again there are so many...: 1) When Vocator Jado comes to visit and Vir and Londo are comparing notes on Centauri Opera. 2) When Londo realises that Vir is one of the few true friends he actually has.  Again though, there are so many good characters in B5....Vir was immense in his own right. I especially loved his little ""Meetings"" with Lennier to complain about their positions; just because they understood eachother's position. It was an amusing little touch."

babylon5,1hf6rl,thegenregeek,1 point,Tue Jul 2 02:50:05 2013 UTC,"Warner Bros. holds the rights to the property. JMS only has rights to the scripts.  Warner Bros. has licensed parts of the property to various companies in the past, and continues to do so. So it's not a dead property.  As for non-computer based games: Agents of Gaming, and now Mongoose Publishing, hold/held licenses for B5-based tabletop space combat games (Babylon 5 Wars and A Call to Arms, respectively). ACTA still exists. Mongoose (and Chameleon Eclectic before them) published RPGs based on B5.  There have been no successful computer-based games using the Babylon 5 license. One was in development ages ago (over a decade), but it fell apart before completion.  Fiery Void is a fan-produced multiplayer web version of Babylon 5 Wars, and I maintain a site that includes genericized rules for Babylon 5 Wars (called Advent of Galactic Wars; AOGWars was originally written up by one of the designers of the game). Too far beyond that and you're probably asking for trouble."

Warner Bros holds almost all the rights to Babylon 5. For this context, yes I believe also they own the rights to any video games.That stated JMS owns the movie rights.   Walter Koening also let it slip that JMS was, at least a few years go, trying to buy back the remaining rights (though I don't believe anything happened).  JMS also made some comments at one point that due to the nature of the rights/deal neither Warner Bros nor he can make a new series or movie without the others say so. So they are sort of stuck in limbo unless they can work together.  Which isn't going to happen because Warner Brothers screwed JMS via hollywood accounting."

babylon5,1hf6rl,arquebus_x,1 point,Tue Jul 2 12:34:48 2013 UTC,"No, he does own the rights outright. I guess I should clarify exactly what he has said, since I finally found a proper link. This one being an article from 5/31/2013:    Sun- If I’m not mistaken, Warner Bros. owns the television rights to “Babylon 5.” What sort of relationship do you have with them, and is there ever going to be a time when B5 will be available on Netflix, or in its entirety on Hulu — or somewhere else? Studio JMS TV, perhaps?  JMS- Warners has never really understood “Babylon 5.” We’ve always been their little-favored stepchild, complicated further by the fact that the folks running regular network TV programming were kind of shut out from what PTEN was doing, leading to resentment toward the show. Consequently there’s never been any real desire to keep the show on the air in the US, though it continues to do very well overseas. As to the future: the problem is that WB owns the TV rights and I own the film rights. One can’t be done without the other, so maybe one day we’ll find some way to make this work.    I guess a better clarification on the point is that it can't be done properly(?). Not that it can't be done at all. He's never really been too clear on the specifics here, from the various articles I've read where he's asked this.   One factor to consider is that most studios are not going to want to finance a movie based off a series owned by Warner Brothers (Limiting JMS to self finance or back to Warners). He did try to work with Warners at one point on a movie, but they wanted a new, younger cast to replace the existing ones if they were going to finance it (Which JMS didn't want). The other factor is that with the death of 4 members of the cast JMS mentioned he's not completely on board for a revival.   So as a whole it's probably more accurate to say JMS cannot get a B5 movie made without Warner Bros. Warners could probably bypass JMS and make a new series if they wanted to, but have no interest unless he signs on (since he could simply denounce the project and effectively kill it with the fan base).  Therefore, for practical reasons, they cannot make a serious effort at either a TV or movie without the others say so."

It's a gray area, but some rules of thumb:   It's not strictly forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, but you should sort of consider yourself on thin ice. So please pay careful attention to the rest of these bullet points. If you spend more time submitting to reddit than reading it, you're almost certainly a spammer. I read, by far, more than I post on reddit. I'm a journalist. I read 5-10 news articles/day on reddit, so not spam as per this bullet point. If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to peoples questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer. If over 10% of your submissions are your own site/content, you're almost certainly a spammer. My contribution has been small because I'm still relatively new. I participate in discussions and try to answer every comment left. I own none of the domains I've linked to on this subreddit. I'll admit that I'm in a grey area for my not having read the 10% rule. One who isn't trying to spam doesn't tend to read the rules of spamming. If people historically downvote your links or ones similar to yours, and you feel the need to keep submitting them anyway, they're probably spam. Some links do better than others. I've never posted anything more than once, so not spam as per this bullet point. If people historically upvote your links or ones like them -- and we're talking about real people here, not sockpuppets or people you asked to go vote for you -- congratulations! It's almost certainly not spam. But we're serious about the ""not people you asked to go vote for you"" part. I've never asked people to upvote. Honestly, I don't care if it's upvoted, downvoted or ignored. I've been trying to share and contribute. That's all, so not spam as per this bullet point. If nobody's submitted a link like yours before, give it a shot. But don't flood the new queue; submit one or two times and see what happens. I've given it a shot.

Convinced my GF a while back to watch the new Battlestar Galactica, and even got her to watch a few episodes of B5. One thing that struck me about these two series is that they have opposite problems.   B5 is exquisitely well written and plotted, and its strongest suits are its complex but consistent characters and its interwoven storylines. Its major shortcoming is its slightly dated aesthetic, especially in terms of costume and set design. the dialogue can also come off as a little... ""immature"" for lack of a better word.  BSG by contrast is still slick and stylish, though time will tell on that front. And the gritty, conflicted characters sometimes come off as more realistic than those on B5. But the show is also woefully underplanned; compared to B5, many of the characters just aren't that consistent or believable when considered through the entire course of the show. The overall plot is also very intriguing at the outset, but it becomes painfully obvious upon watching the entire thing that the show runners were flying by the seat of their pants past the first season or two.  That being said, B5 is still my favourite sci-fi series of all time, and ranks up there with The Wire as my favourite TV show ever."

babylon5,1f2hsz,beaverteeth92,26,Sun May 26 05:22:32 2013 UTC,All the bullshit I have read about O'Hare. This changes everything.
babylon5,1f2hsz,Netzaj,10,Sun May 26 09:16:47 2013 UTC,Yeah a lot of the stuff I read prior to this said things like he would sexually harass all the female actresses and was a complete asshole.  It's relieving to know he quit because he was a genuinely good person who wanted to see the show succeed.
babylon5,1f2hsz,FKRMunkiBoi,1 point,Sun May 26 23:04:27 2013 UTC,"The two are not mutually exclusive. If there are reports of him harassing the female actresses, those don't just disappear because he didn't want the show to end. He could still have behaved in a manner others found asshole-ish and yet still been kind enough not to want to cost every person there their job.   JMS has clarified the cause, he did not speak of how the symptoms manifested themselves."
babylon5,1f2hsz,FKRMunkiBoi,3,Mon May 27 04:08:46 2013 UTC,"I'm aware they aren't mutually exclusive, but I had heard that was the actual reason O'Hare left the show."
babylon5,1f2hsz,DaEvil1,0,Mon May 27 04:11:37 2013 UTC,"You already said that's what you'd heard, but your comment made it sound like this new information meant he couldn't have been acting like an asshole or harassing women. I got the impression you had changed your mind.  I feel like an ass myself for even pointing it out, because I don't want to speak ill of either the dead or someone who's work I've admired, but I had to say it's entirely possible that both of what you said was true and one didn't cancel out the other - He was struggling, true, he was concerned for everyone's job, but in dealing with his demons he might still have been less than pleasant for some co-workers. Personally, I don't recall hearing those stories and if you have any sources I'd be interested to read them.  EDIT: Found an interesting article about O'Hare's behavior"
babylon5,1f2hsz,SgSpecial180,3,Mon May 27 04:24:13 2013 UTC,"Here's one.  The ""Don't try and control me!"" thing makes a lot more sense in hindsight now that we know what we know."
babylon5,1f2hsz,Dayanx,2,Mon May 27 04:29:49 2013 UTC,"I can't say I'm too surprised that he was a stand up guy. I heard Claudia Christian comment on his departure, and it honestly sounds more like he was frozen out of the gang more than anything. Add to that the issues he had while filming, and I find it pretty amazing that he managed to do so well."
babylon5,1f2hsz,SgSpecial180,24,Sun May 26 21:42:10 2013 UTC,"If you don't want to read the whole article and watch the video, O'Hare left because he was dealing with a massive mental health issue where he constantly thought people were out to get him.  Straczynski offerred to halt production while O'Hare got help, and O'Hare refused to let the show go with him.  He didn't want to see people lose their jobs because the lead actor had his own personal issues.  So he parted from the show and the rest is history."
babylon5,1f2hsz,Obidom,17,Sun May 26 06:27:24 2013 UTC,Man... I had no idea O'Hare had it so bad. That is just terrible. I also did not know the good doctor was nearly deaf. This puts all of their performances in a new light for me.   At least Andreas Katsulas was exactly as I would imagine. I figured he would be a ladies man in that costume.
babylon5,1f2hsz,sitharus,4,Sun May 26 06:39:37 2013 UTC,In high school a friend of mine was a mascot for the football squad. He only had ladies around him when he was in costume- otherwise he was shy guy. I wonder if other actors who wear a lot of prosthetics have similar effects.
babylon5,1f2hsz,farmingdale,3,Sun May 26 16:00:14 2013 UTC,"I would imagine that being in costume would give a shy person a good confidence boost. Being behind a mask gives you a degree of separation from who you are and those around you. And everyone loves to be around the mascot, and I'd think that would make it much easier for a shy person to open up and talk to people, especially girls if that person was normally awkward around them. I'm sure many people who dress up experience this."
babylon5,1f2hsz,anarchistica,8,Sun May 26 16:59:03 2013 UTC,Wow I never realised so many of the cast had shuffled off this mortal coil
babylon5,1f2hsz,Obidom,8,Sun May 26 07:30:47 2013 UTC,"Yep, Dr Franklin, Zathras, Zack Allen, G'Kar and Sinclair now. It's been over 20 years since the pilot aired."

babylon5,1f2hsz,FrodoFraggins,6,Sun May 26 06:04:30 2013 UTC,Wow. What powerful words in that recording. JMS has such a way with words.
babylon5,1f2hsz,demonstar55,2,Sun May 26 13:37:22 2013 UTC,"I was at that Phoenix Comicon panel.  JMS took questions for Tue first half hour, and the last half your, he spent talking about tjw 4 main cast members who had passed. For that last half hour, the audience was so quiet that you could have heard a pin drop.  It really did shed new light on why O'Hare left the show, and why there was so much secrecy about it.    The other thing I loved learning from that memorium was that Richard Bigger really loved the fans. Even when he was sick, he would go to conventions and get out and talk to Tue fans instead of sticking to hos.hotel room when he wasn't scheduled for something. Those are the kinds.of.people.we need in the industry. Ones that appreciate that of there were no fans, there would be no show."
babylon5,1f2hsz,demonstar55,3,Thu May 30 00:15:23 2013 UTC,Jerry Doyle seems like a total dick now :/

babylon5,1f2hsz,FrodoFraggins,3,Mon May 27 03:23:28 2013 UTC,"It's possible even Jerry had no idea.  The Usenet post above says only four people knew why O'Hare left, and it was JMS and three producers."
babylon5,1f2hsz,FrodoFraggins,1 point,Mon May 27 04:13:06 2013 UTC,I know. It still kind of shitty of him.
babylon5,1f2hsz,Shabaz,2,Mon May 27 04:27:29 2013 UTC,Jerry comes across as a highly opiniated ass.  No real shocker there.

babylon5,1f2hsz,owen_birch,4,Tue May 28 01:05:05 2013 UTC,I always assumed that Michael was let go by the suits.  It made me very angry that they didn't give Michael more to do in season 2.  Now that I understand it makes perfect sense.  I've only gone out of my way to meet one celebrity and that was Michael O'Hare.
babylon5,1f2hsz,minterbartolo,1 point,Mon May 27 03:12:17 2013 UTC,How long ago and what was he like?
babylon5,1f2hsz,BranWafr,2,Mon May 27 04:13:54 2013 UTC,"Oh geesh at least ten years ago, probably closer to 14 years ago.  It was an autograph signing at a comic store.  I had my picture taken with him and he signed my Season 1 cast poster.  He was very polite but reserved.  It was just a pleasure to meet him."
babylon5,1f2hsz,AngryRedHerring,3,Mon May 27 06:36:03 2013 UTC,"Laudable as JMS's loyalty to O'Hare may be, this is still a tad disturbing. Didn't JMS at one point blame the WB execs for firing O'Hare because they wanted a stronger male lead?"
babylon5,1f2hsz,JBlitzen,11,Sun May 26 18:17:29 2013 UTC,I don't think so. The neat thing about JMS having spend so much time on Usenet is that most of that stuff is archived. This is the original announcement 19 years ago about O'Hare leaving. Here you have JMS getting upset that the Hollywood rumour mill is saying he was forced to fire O'Hare rather than it being a mutual decision. There is even a message of him chiding fans who were looking to start a letter writing campaign to WB and implying it wasn't JMS's call to replace O'Hare.

babylon5,1ez6wy,SgSpecial180,1 point,Sat May 25 20:24:30 2013 UTC,"I think part of the problem may just be the lack of scale in the pictures, though.  It's almost 3 feet long, which means that if you stuck a child in the picture it would look pretty massive. Instead we just have an orange background and a placard of unknown size.

He went on his tangent about grinding the Centauri's bones to dust, blackening their skies, etc... but when Morden asked 'then what?' he appeared to astonished, like he was so consumed with rage against the Centauri that he never stopped to think about the future of his world outside of that. Maybe that was a small seed planted in him, a realization that his all consuming hate of the Centauri may have blinded him to what his world really needed for survival."

My brother adored him, being a big anime fan, and he had saved up to get some things signed, and Vic went above and beyond, giving him a free wristband, a free picture of brolly (my bro likes dbz) with that signed.  Since we where the only people to get a picture with him he also stayed and chatted with us for a while, talking about Full Metal Alchemist, what it was like being a Christian in the anime biz, stuff like that. Really positive experience."

Before his 'finding himself', I found the character came across as self-righteous, condescending and preachy.  This felt a lot more natural. He understood and accepted the other man's point of view, and admitted feeling that way at times too. But then he, respectfully, explained where he was coming from. And made one hell of a case, without being sanctimonious or arrogant.  Much, much better than Franklin in seasons 1 and 2, and even season 3."

babylon5,1ebm25,ArcaneShield,-3,Tue May 14 18:53:14 2013 UTC,"Well, now I have a new anecdote about being insulted on the internet for no good reason."
babylon5,1ebm25,Chaosdada,1 point,Tue May 14 19:03:27 2013 UTC,"Ahh, my apologies. Was more trying to make a general comment with 'intellectuals with their heads up their asses' than a specific insult to your person. I don't know you, I don't know how intellectual you consider yourself or why you don't consider personal stories of persuasive value.  It has been my experience that there is a divide between the esoteric logic of right and wrong, and the practical application of right and wrong. Lofty theologians and philosophers can debate esoteric logical conundrums till they're blue in the face. We can logically debate right and wrong with heady words and generalist logic. That does not always lead to the practical application of right and wrong, and it also often doesn't actually line up with reality, life 'in the trenches' so to speak.   If a person asks me why I believe A is right and B is wrong, I can engage them in a carefully prepared intellectual argument. But we are not simply beings of pure logic, their is a measure of empathy, and the oral story-telling tradition within human culture. I think that if we're willing to let go of the more esoteric and elitist jargon, we can be more open to real life examples and frank discussions based on real world experience, rather than divorced philosophy."

babylon5,1ds17i,sourbrew,12,Mon May 6 06:01:56 2013 UTC,"It was meant to be five seasons, but they had to make accomodations to the story to wrap things up in the 4th season, as they didn't know until the very end of it if they were going to get a 5th. As such, the 5th had to start slow to generate new plot threads that had been cut out previously, and then wrap up quickly.  Telepath war would have been developed more from Crusade, I expect (if indirectly) but that failed to get off the ground. There would certainly have been a lot of work with the Drakh, however. Dealing with the Drakh was the main purpose of the show."
babylon5,1ds17i,tenkadaiichi,7,Mon May 6 06:08:58 2013 UTC,"Actually I think SiL is one of the best endings to any TV show ever. It's almost flawless IMHO.  Season 5 on the other hand, while still having great moments, very much suffered from not being planned out due to all the cancellation issues."
babylon5,1ds17i,jschild,2,Mon May 6 21:08:28 2013 UTC,You actually like SiL?   What about G'kar? What about Lyta? Why the hell was Ivanova one of the primary characters? What about Sheridan and Delenn's kid? Did he turn 16 and receive a keeper? How did Londo die? Did they resolve the Drakh situation on Centari Prime? Does Garibaldi get Bester? Do the telepaths have their own home world?  So many gaping plot holes they could have tied up instead of just leaving you with a sentimental reflection episode.
babylon5,1ds17i,jschild,6,Mon May 6 22:53:24 2013 UTC,"Gaping plot holes, I know exactly what happened to G'Kar and Londo, if you don't, you never watched the show. The same with Jason.  Apparently you never watched the show if you don't know those answers.  As for the Telepath situation, JMS NEVER, EVER, planned to have it dealt with on B5. He had hopes of one time of dealing with it as a movie. However, he did deal with many of the questions in the Telepath Trilogy B5 books (which are canon). There is also a trilogy that deals with Centauri Prime by Peter David that is also canon, but again, we know those answers if you watched the show.  They aren't gaping plot holes, they are things beyond the story of B5 itself and weren't meant to be dealt with it proper.  It just boggles my mind that you can ask what happened to G'Kar and Londo. Watch the show man, they tell you straight up what happened, hell, you get to watch it."
babylon5,1ds17i,jschild,0,Tue May 7 01:02:58 2013 UTC,It would appear you are reffering to the events of   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5:_In_the_Beginning  Which was not part of the series proper. It would appear I need to watch some of these tv movies as well.
babylon5,1ds17i,Blob_of_Goo,4,Tue May 7 01:39:53 2013 UTC,"No, not at all, that wouldn't explain anything since it takes place 10 years before the show starts.  I am referring to War Without End, Part 1 and 2 from Season 3, EP 16 and 17.  http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/060.html"
babylon5,1ds17i,mahanahan,8,Tue May 7 01:53:22 2013 UTC,"Textbook case of an excellent sci-fi being fucked by network execs.  It was indeed supposed to be five seasons, but the network decided to cancel it after four, meaning JMS had to wrap it all up pretty hastily.  Season four should have been dedicated to the Shadow war, season five to removing the presidential usurper and his fascist Black Watch.    As we all know, the show was brought back for that fifth season after all.  In my opinion that was a mistake - they should have just moved straight on to spin-offs."

As Ms. Christian explains after they failed to get the initial funding for season five, she took on a movie project.  Then when season five was suddenly and surprisingly funded, basically contract work fell apart.  She had 3 filming periods where she could not be available due to the prior contractual agreement with the movie, but JMS had said it was all or nothing.  It would have been breach of contract for her, so it was nothing.  Very unfortunate."

And although the con had two of my favorite comic artists, AND Adam West, AND Billy Dee Williams, I was by far most excited about meeting Walter Koenig.  I haven't watched much of the original Star Trek, but I love Bester.  He is my second favorite character after Londo/G'kar tie for first.    And although he was lovely, it was probably the most embarrassing experience of my life.  The first time we tried to have our pic taken, I had unknowingly run out of space on my SD card.  So here we are, posing for the photo, while his assistant struggles with my camera.  We stood there awkwardly smiling for like 5 minutes, and I felt like such dirt for wasting his time (then again, there wasn't a line to meet him or anything).  At the time, this had never happened to me, so it took a couple of hours after that for me to finally figure out what was wrong.   So I take care of the problem and we return to his booth the next day.  My husband (don't judge him for the denim, lol) is explaining about how much we both loved the show and about how we incorporated it into our wedding day (my vows began with G'kar's ""We Are One"" speech).  So Walter turns to me, and says.....something.  I don't know.  It's like, being star-struck plus the camera fiasco from the day before combined to cause my brains to leak out my ears.  It was some sort of joke quizzing me about obscure B5 lore concerning to Corp.  So I ended up blanking, panicking, and then sputtering something like this:  ""I like you.  You are best villain.  Good job you.""  ...all while beet red.    sigh  Thankfully, we also met Claudia Christian (who hasn't aged at all), and she was super nice.  I somehow avoided getting the funk brain with her, and in our photo, I got to touch her waist.  lady swoon  This is the story of how I humiliated myself in front of the the scariest telepath in the world."

babylon5,1dluz8,Cern_Stormrunner,19,Mon May 13 02:54:46 2013 UTC,Telepath Wars. I really wish Babylon 5 delved deeper into the Psycorps... I really liked that aspect of the setting.
babylon5,1dluz8,ArcaneShield,9,Wed May 29 02:43:32 2013 UTC,"Definitely Telepath Wars. As a science fiction setting it is simply brilliant - how would telepathy affect a society, how would you combat incredibly powerful telepaths... You could definitely draw some analogies to the current information revolution we're going through."
babylon5,1dluz8,detestrian,3,Wed May 29 15:13:06 2013 UTC,"Yeah, and I think it would provide a god opportunity to do what the original series, which is show that all sides in a conflict have vlaid motivations for how they've got to where they are.  One of the things I really appreciated about B5 is that (outside of a few cases) it didn't generally resort to the idea that there are goodies and baddies.  The various characters and races have reasons to have taken the paths they have."

Then did the darkness come to Narn until it was driven out by G'Quan and the last of the surviving mindwalkers.'"" Sheridan: ""Mindwalkers. Telepaths? They're afraid of telepaths!"""
babylon5,1dluz8,Stupid_Ned_Stark,8,Sat May 4 00:41:53 2013 UTC,"I think the Dilgar War would be too human-focused; one of the things that made B5 great was that there was an interesting story going for all the major council races. And we definitely don't need a remake/reboot, just a complete overhaul of the CGI.  20 years after is too far in the future, I think. I'd rather see something about 5-10 years after the show, preferably the Telepath Wars books made into a series. That would be amazing."
babylon5,1dluz8,Dayanx,7,Sat May 4 05:32:20 2013 UTC,"I would love to see the CGI redone, then we might get an HD release.  The telepath wars would be interesting for sure. I can't think of too many other events that could be made in to a full series though."
babylon5,1dluz8,Dayanx,2,Sat May 4 05:51:19 2013 UTC,"I think I read somewhere a while back that a group was gonna try and redo all the CG as a fansourced project, but I don't know if that ever got off the ground. As it stands, JMS said B5 is essentially done; the original files for the CG effects were destroyed, so they'd have to do them from scratch again, which is way too expensive to do apparently."
babylon5,1dluz8,lithium42,3,Fri May 3 08:46:09 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I remember that as well. I'd believe it'd be too expensive to do commercially, since the only revenue would be direct sales.

babylon5,1dluz8,co_fragment,2,Fri May 3 12:00:16 2013 UTC,"You're right in that the main conflict was mostly human-based, but there's a lot going on in the galaxy at that time, which would make it easy to weave in other races stories, too."
babylon5,1dluz8,mrwoolery,2,Fri May 3 11:57:37 2013 UTC,"The Humans had interactions with the Narn and Centauri who kinda raised them up, so we'd still have those races. The Minbari hadn't been met just yet, so we'd lose them, and most of the races discovered through the successful construction of B5, such as the Gaim, Pak'Ma'Ra, Brakiri, Llort, Vree, and most of the other League worlds with perhaps the exception of the Drazi.  The show B5 was already human centric if you consider that the only alien main characters who got their own story arc were Delenn, Lennier, Vir, Londo, G'Kar, and Kosh. The Humans get Sheridan, Sinclair, Garibaldi, Ivanova, Talia Winters, Bester, Zach, Byron, Lyta, Marcus, Dr. Franklin, Lt. Keffer, and Lochley. More than twice as many humans as aliens."
babylon5,1dluz8,bumchester,1 point,Fri May 3 08:53:49 2013 UTC,"True, but there was still an ongoing arc for each member race during the whole show, which is one of the things I love. I would just hate to see any of the major races not get their due."
babylon5,1dluz8,mrwoolery,2,Fri May 3 09:08:32 2013 UTC,"Right, but we could see more of characters that we didn't get to see much of in B5, such as Franklin's father. I'd love to see the touching story of him getting captured and rescued by a Dilgar doctor.  The Dilgar would replace the Minbari as a major race to have a focus on."

babylon5,1dluz8,lithium42,3,Fri May 3 15:41:07 2013 UTC,"To be honest, I think prequels have been done to death. We know how the first shadow war and the dilgar war and the earth minbari war end. With the last one, there was an excellent movie.   Babylon 1-3 blew up.  They were shown on screen blowing up and discussed in various episodes as having never gone online.   I'd be interested in the Telepath wars, but I don't know how well it would translate to television.   As to a remake -- just leave well enough alone. There are some things I would like to see changed -- better acting, better production values,  etc. But the show was groundbreaking in its storytelling, character development, and graphics.   Unless they decided to make it completely different, like BSG did, I don't see a point."
babylon5,1dluz8,brbATF,2,Sat May 4 03:22:35 2013 UTC,"I completely agree. There would need to be a new story, somehow in the Babylon 5 universe, but with interesting new ideas. The Shadow/Vorlon/Ancient Ones idea of older species guiding and toying with the younger species, and then getting kicked out of the galaxy, was great. You can't have that happen again, and that was I think the main driver of the overarching plot -- how older species screwed with younger species and what the interactions and ramifications (like President Clark) were.  The only thing measly old me can think of, is looking at the Babylon 5 universe something like 1000*x years later, and seeing how all the major races evolve. (Touched on in that season 4 finale that might have been series finale at the time.. but maybe pretend that didn't exist) Here are some things that series could explore.   Will things be like the Shadow/Vorlon dynamic? Who are the new ""young"" races to ""guide"" and what are they like?  What is a hyper-evolved futuristic human society like? What races stay uninvolved like the mysterious Ancient Ones that we barely saw, and which ones will meddle to the max like the Shadows/Vorlons? What happens to the Narn/Centauri relationship? Does Sheridan become a prophet to people in the future and a new religion is born? shudder   But probably the most important thing: Can you build on the Babylon 5 Universe in a way that makes the new series stand on its own?  Fan service (cough prequels cough) can be nice, but only gets you so far, and that's not far enough for B5. It's not nearly as big as Star Wars/Trek. The hypothetical new series would need to attract a lot of new fans and not turn them away because they feel 5 seasons behind.  I think the chance of a new series in the Babylon 5 universe happening are like 1:1000. single tear"
babylon5,1dluz8,fzammetti,4,Mon May 6 16:33:20 2013 UTC,Imagine the story of Babylon 5 with the style and panache of Batlestar Galactica.
babylon5,1dluz8,Private_Sub,3,Fri May 3 18:55:58 2013 UTC,"JMS agrees with you, last I heard. He's said that with Andreas Katsulas and, er, the guy that played Franklin being dead, he doesn't think he could do B5 without them.  I think that's a little overstated - for every actor that appears onscreen I feel there are twenty more waiting tables in LA that could feasibly fill a role."
babylon5,1dluz8,oliksandr,2,Fri May 3 21:20:29 2013 UTC,"I'd like to see a remake with consistently good acting. Some of the acting in the original leaves a lot to be desired.   I'd also like to see more of Sinclair's story between the time he leaves as B5 commander and the time he becomes Valen (there must be a few stories that can be squeezed out with regard to the Rangers). In similar vein, I think they could follow Sheridan before he takes over B5, so we can see him losing his wife and maybe trying to investigate her death. There's no need for them to be as mysterious with regard to the shadows in a remake, since the audience already knows about them.   Finally, if the series lasts long enough, they could go into the telepath wars and whatever was happening on Centauri Prime.  Honestly, I think that if anything B5-related is made, it would be a remake (C) because a lot of time's passed since the original, so you'd have to treat audiences as if they know almost nothing of the original B5 (pretty much leaves out A, D, E, and F). D's also out because there are no humans, so audiences wouldn't really like it. H wouldn't really fly since their stations (and therefore set pieces) would get destroyed once per season, and I don't really know what it could be about beyond the characters' repeated failure to make a space station. I don't really remember anything about the Dilgar War beyond the fact that it was mentioned at one point, so B would be a hard sell to studios. G is actually quite promising; I would gladly watch it and think that, in contrast to the Dilgar, the Minbari would be very interesting antagonists. It would also be easier to convince a studio to do G because you can promise that it could lead into a B5 remake, so when you run out of stories a couple of seasons in, you can just say, ""Okay, the Minbari War is done now. Let's change the name of the show to 'Babylon 5' and jump forward a couple of years."""

The B5 universe certainly has material to build upon: telepaths, non alliance worlds, legacy of the vorlons, etc.   I think the Dilgar war would probably fit best. It would certainly fit nicely into established 'mythology', and could give us new perspectives on various civilizations. Pre-War Earth, a prouder Centauri empire, and a new enemy in the Dilgar would be informative, rewarding, and exciting.  While B5 isn't perfect, I don't think a remake/reboot is warranted. There's such a defined story that any remake's changes would feel odd (at least to me), and might as well be a different show.   However, I wouldn't mind a perspective from the Mars rebellion, or the Earth underground. I could see this being concurrent with the events of B5, or perhaps in the years between the Earth/Minbari War and the 'present.'"

babylon5,1dluz8,Endomandioviza,2,Fri May 3 13:51:57 2013 UTC,"I think that could work as a mini-series or made for tv movie, but I think it would be a struggle to have it as a 5+ season tv show."

It's not enough for a series, but a nice 8-hour mini-series?  Sign me right the hell up!  Peter Woodward is still around so it could be done, and that story is one I really love.  I should Kickstart that bitch :)  Unrealistic idea aside... although there's a part of me that completely loathes the idea of a reboot, it might be the best option... in many ways, B5 is tailor-made for that actually.  It's been quite a lot of time since the original now, aside from us existing fans there's very little public knowledge of the series... a lot of the actors have sadly passed away so there's an easy argument to be made that you couldn't ""properly"" continue the original anyway (and really, virtually any of the ideas above you'd want some cameos in and even those possibilities are shrinking due to the natural passage of time)... but at the end of the day, you've always got a very strong story and a robust universe to play in, so rebooting it successfully would open the door to doing all the other storylines we all want to see... but rebooting what was, in at least some ways, a successful series that's been largely forgotten now by the general public, would be the way to get to that point."

There was definitely some strong-arming there and there's certainly precedent for Sheridan doing what he has to do when he knows what's best for people (Rumors, Bargains and Lies).  After all, some of what Garibaldi said in The Illusion of Truth was right, even if he said it for the wrong reasons: Sheridan came back with a bit of a Messiah complex. Whether he turned out to be right all the time or not is another matter.  Edit: Having thought about it some more, though, there is also precedent for people coming out of a war, wanting to never go through it again, and forming/joining larger groups to that end. See also the League of Nations and the United Nations."
babylon5,1d6ujy,smilingkevin,8,Sat Apr 27 02:26:56 2013 UTC,"Maybe, except the government they overthrew had usurped power and declared martial law. And the homeworld defense ring was only destroyed AFTER the leader of said government turned in to his own planet in an attempt to kill hundreds of millions of people. Before that the fight did NOT include the alien ships or fleet. Until he tried to glass his own planet Sheridan wanted the fight to be human resistance against Clark's military. Once that happened he called in everything. If nothing else the amount of force he was withholding should let them know he wasn't there to take over."

I love the show for what it is but I do think a more mature version could add a lot to the show from a themes point of view. What I love most about sci fi is it's ability to make us think about issues we face in our lives in a context that doesn't come with the same baggage we normally carry in these conversations."

Speaking as someone who's watched almost all of B5 (think I missed some episodes of Crusade and one of the TV movies), watching In the Beginning simply changes the tone of the series.   You go from seeing everything as it's happening to knowing the inevitable outcomes and ramifications of their decisions.  to use Londo as an example, you know of his downfall from the very start, but you get to watch him walk the path to hell with the best of intentions. It's very depressing and Russion. Ivanova would approve"
babylon5,1cd76a,olavharald02,6,Tue Apr 16 00:16:42 2013 UTC,I felt this way as well but the writing is phenomenal so it was worth it. Season 1 is rough so try and get past it. The rest is pretty great.
babylon5,1cd76a,thegenregeek,11,Mon Apr 15 03:47:38 2013 UTC,"If you want an abridged season 1 to watch first you can hit, ""Mind War"", ""Signs and Portents"",  ""Legacies"",  ""A Voice in the Wilderness (Part 1 and 2)"", ""Babylon Squared"" and ""Chrysalis"". That will give you a good primer to a number of the overall plot arc elements so you can appreciate things better in Season 2.  The series though really picks up in season 2. That's where a lot of the main story arcs start coming together and things feel like they fit. If you absolutely despise season 1, you can just start around there I'm season 2. But you won't get the richness of seeing the little things get put in place during season 1.  Now, the funny thing about Season 1 is that it's kind of better once you know where things are going. Don't get me wrong for some people it's just not their cup of tea. I've forced family to watch it and the reaction I got was, ""you know season 1 was kind of like being invited into the house, awkward at times. Season 2 feels like being welcomed to family.""  You appreciated things better because season 1 spends most of it's time laying the foundation so you understand the context of the universe better.  EDIT: To be clear I recommend watching season 1. The above is an option if you simply don't want to."

First thing first - line up a job, and a place to live before you book passage. There are a lot of people, both in the major races and non-aligned worlds, that land on B5 and are not able to find work.  If you don't know where to start, contact your race's consulate on the station.    Secondly - check news feeds carefully before you travel. Life on Babylon 5 can be a little rough sometimes, but the surrounding area is prone to conflict and civilian vessels sometimes get stuck in the crossfire.   Thirdly - make friends, but be cautious. One of the wonderful things about Babylon 5 is that you will meet people from races that you have never heard of before.  Most of these people are just people, and you will probably find you have much in common. Some of these people, just like you experience at home, are dangerous and should be avoided. A very few of these people may try to eat you for lunch.   Good luck!"
babylon5,1cd76a,sleepdeprivedtechie,3,Mon Apr 15 13:55:40 2013 UTC,"As most of the comments here say, stick it out through the first season...

Things that sound like trivial details will often turn out to be important later on.  To be honest, I envy you. I wish I could forget everything about B5, and watch it again as a fresh show.  As for the movies, I would watch the pilot ""The Gathering"" first, and then the series. Then watch the other movies."
babylon5,1cd76a,mrwoolery,2,Mon Apr 15 21:09:52 2013 UTC,"If you skip parts of season 1, or decide to start with season 2, you'll get hooked and love the B5 universe...but you'll ultimately hate yourself for being impatient and skipping stuff that would've paid off so much more by watching the whole series from episode one.  Yes, season one has a slower pace to it, but that's on purpose.  It's to set a good background for the universe, to introduce you to characters (and set your paradigms about them), before things really heat up.

If you absolutely can't get into season 1, then make sure you watch the following Season 1 episodes:   Midnight on the Firing Line Parliament of Dreams And The Sky Full of Stars Signals and Portents A Voice in the Wilderness (parts 1 and 2) Babylon Squared Chrysalis   There are other 1st season eps that are useful and have effects on later episodes, but these are the really truly important ones.  I cannot stress enough how important  Babylon Squared is.  I also cannot stress enough how bad TKO is.  I love this show but skip that episode unless you're OCD or into completeness.  No good can come of it.  As for Season 2, make sure you get all the way through The Coming of Shadows (ep 9).  If you're not into it all by then, it might not be for you.  But I sure hope it is. :)"
babylon5,1cd76a,ann_no_aku,0,Sat May 25 23:42:21 2013 UTC,"I really recommend watching In the Beginning first (great movie) for background info and to get into it more (better cgi). Then watch The Gathering (the 2 hour long pilot).  Season 1 is difficult (as is 5, ugh), but once the pieces start to come together, you'll see how it's worth it.   Babylon 5, to this day, remains my favorite show of all time. I rewatch it every few years."

babylon5,1c9s1z,lalophobia,2,Sat Apr 13 15:17:12 2013 UTC,"I remember this bothering me at the time... It's explained that he needs line of sight or extreme proximity to do a scan in space, so it makes sense that he wouldn't need an escort when they're out on their little fishing expedition, but inside the station he ought to have had escorts at all times and he didn't... all I can think of is that they didn't want to or couldn't find extras willing to wear that much costuming long enough to shoot the whole episode that way...  As for the ethical issues with using minbari telepaths, I don't see the issue - the psy corps is involuntary, minibari telepaths aren't, so far as I recall, in any sort of organisational structure, nor had they previously been employed in combat. They're volunteers"
babylon5,1c9s1z,brbATF,1 point,Sat Apr 13 15:53:56 2013 UTC,"yeah, also what I may have missed was how Bester knew babylon had some kind of ship that would even allow the captain to go after the transport. Or knew the capitain would be able to get a ship from one of the aliens.  But I didn't want to pick apart the episode too much.  they say at the start most of the secrets that they were trying to keep were out anyway but that special minbari ship the captain uses was still a bit on the down low I thought.   probably conveniently overlooked. (but then again it's not said they used the special ship it could be any minbari ship)   ""ethical issues / They're volunteers"" good point about the volunteers and ethical was a bit too strong, I was just thinking aloud for that part, exploring possible arguments why they haven't set up some kind of telepathic counsel or whatever or at the very least included a telepath in the war room.. Could have missed it or play a role in later episodes but the rangers don't appear to be of the telepathic kind."
babylon5,1c9s1z,brbATF,1 point,Sat Apr 13 16:11:07 2013 UTC,"I don't recall ever hearing about a ranger who was also a telepath... on either the human or minbari side... seems odd to me in hindsight.  I hope this isn't spoiling anything, but the main reason Sheridan doesn't bring human rogue telepaths in is because he's still hoping for reintegration with Earth, and the psy corps is a part of that - so he'd have to turn them over, which would effectively hand the psy corps everything they've been doing. Minbari telepaths on the other hand... They would be pretty handy, but there're those pesky ethical issues involved in compelling them to help, so they're limited to a handful of volunteers"
babylon5,1c9s1z,brbATF,1 point,Sat Apr 13 16:16:30 2013 UTC,"Fair enough and you didn't wrote it specifically spoilery (cheers!) so no worries. Should have noted the fear of having to report them to psycorps after clark gets the boot would have been more likely to any political/practical/ethical reasons why not to drag the minbari telepaths in too much. Because when he really needed the answer from that centauri and conveniently that rogue human telepath was on board a few episodes before .. etc. ;D  (but then again, Bester had seen some of them anyway.. so that's no real news.. it could even be argument to wave them away, but unless I missed it they got circumvented first and then nobody considered about them for the remainder)   But all the more reasons why they are a bit missing.  I think it may just have been a practical thing to leave them out because you can only fit so much in an episode, so they could focus more on some elements like the Bester character and whatnot. But I just wondered a bit, it seems like a big enough thing to at least throw a line or two at to wave them away for the rest of the episode. Maybe I overlooked the line explaining it.. but I was watching it and wondered..   Bester played nice ,he got on board without them etc.. In fact, Because Bester circumvents them they get acknowledged again, so first they take care to write the excuse why they don't need them initially but then they just vanish. It got me wondering if I missed anything :D  Maybe I'm looking in it too deeply, but so far the series looks really well written (in my laymans point of view) and I realize no tv show escapes a trope here and there, but yeah. could be me. Was wondering if it just irked me or not ;)"

Near the start of the episode I thought they were totally forgetting the Nimbari, but on the grander scheme for the part about the machine girl and transport attack and such it wasn't quite required and maybe even hindering exploring the bester personality touch of the episode. now I still think either I'm overlooking or they missed a bit of dialog waving them away for the rest of the episode, but still it was a entertaining episode.   Maybe they wrote the episode purposely so they ended up lowering their guard a bit and this will become relevant again in a later episode that you're trying not to spoil. I'll see ;)"

My favorite.  You can see the pride in Sheridan's eyes, Delenn's too. A sort of 'You tell 'em, G'kar!'. Londo's face shows his disdain, but there's nothing he can come back with and he knows it. And G'Kar himself... in that moment you see him change from someone who squabbles with Londo to a man (Narn) of a hard resolve and determination. Everything has changed for him and you can see it. Gives me shivers."

For example when Delenn and Lennier are talking in her quarters they are speaking Minbari. Londo/Vir Centari. Ivanova/SInclair English. (Etc Etc) He felt that we the watchers shouldn't need to worry about the difference in language, that we should assume the magic of television is translating for us when each race is speaking in it's own tongue and while using other languages we don't know about.  Keep in mind there's a number of references throughout the series to Interlac. When you see the various interactions between different races they may be speaking in that tongue (but we are hearing English because of the magic of television) or another language.  The Centari Republic was a major economic power house for centuries, much like English has become a current standard for international commerce, so would/could the Centari's language or Interlac.   This also fits with some of the language translators machines the races use. They are all calibrated to Interlac for easier cross species communication."

I don't want to force him, but I'm close to doing just that! Sure, some of it is typical teenage independence, but it didn't grab him before and unfortunately I understand since even I as an uber-fan recognize that S1 is a little weak in terms if really pulling you... although the handful of key episodes I thought would and they didn't... argh, just venting :("

Now, I live for the one, I die for the one.   Edit: Just thought of what really got me into it- it was seeing ""In the Beginning,"" the TV movie about the Minbari War. That tells a great story and sets up some intrigue into what exactly Z'ha'dum is. And since it's a prequel, he might gain some understanding about Sinclair and S1."

I will say though that his interest was piqued a little in S1 by the first appearance of the Shadow ships taking out the Raiders... so maybe I make a deal with him: watch S2 up to Coming of Shadows and if he's still not into it then we'll stop.

The writing is overly concerned with the quality of technical form/presentation/acting/dialog, rather than using that information to give insight into the narrative content of each episode. Some of it is just illogical reasoning, such as:   The episode’s title implies that it’s about revealing where everyone stands. As such, it’s not the most exciting hour of the series, but it is effective and necessary at setting up Babylon 5’s second season.   For impressive reviews, give me Lurker's Guide, any time."

The new slimmer package movie box set is only $14.49 on Amazon.com right now.   Amazon also has Seasons 1-5 bundled for around $90 to $100 for the whole set. Though, right now it's $82.69 before shipping for the seasons individually, so... cheaper. Add the movie box set and that's $97.18. If you have Amazon prime, you get free shipping. That's a great deal for the entire series.  I was getting the show when it was first coming out on DVD, and was paying upwards of $45 a set, and I still think it was worth every damned penny.

I did like that the Federation ships are shown with greater speed and mobility than the Earth Alliance ships, but was confused as to why we didn't see any use of the Federation shield technology. Ultimately, I agree with the outcome of the battle, but was sorely disappointed that we didn't see more of the ships from the B5 universe."
babylon5,19v9dd,TheEnterprise,5,Fri Mar 8 00:05:25 2013 UTC,"The reason no advanced tactics are shown is because both commanders are idiots.   The starfleet (or rather,  P-Fleet) commander let the other side know his intentions by thinking out loud about invading the other side's Earth during a conversation with the Babylon 5 (Babel 13) commander,  who then went in to a Speech about tyranny and whatnot... and did not notice the P-Fleet ships getting ready to fight because Pirk (the P-Fleet commander)  got bored waiting for the speech to end.   He gave battle orders over the open channel and Sherrypie (B13) was too busy speeching to notice.   There are no shields,  because,  as Lieutenant Info tells Pirk: ""Fascinating!

I've seen random episodes in the past but recently started from episode 1 and am only halfway into s3 so (avoid some spoilers lol) i recently saw that episode and I did get the gist of it but I don't know much yet about the gene therapy.. anyway,  from in universe view.    if they were merely observing the general area and trying to be non interfering and sebastian was able to sense them being the strong a teek/teep, they could probably have sensed that.  again i'm not too intimately familiar with where the vorlon story arch goes in later episodes but there of tons of examples from other space scifi where they somehow end up interfering anyway and it ends up as a sort of damage control smallest interference so i'm using that as reference to nitpick about 'interfering' but understand that I'm just trying to give some reply and find your point interesting and don't mean to tear it apart or any :)    also that leaves a 'minor' gap of how jack could expose them but aside that suppose they considered it a threat anyway it could be argued that removing jack, and thus removing additional killings and actually get them someone to take out of storage every once in a while, unfortunately leaving a mystery behind isn't that big of an interference, in the grand scheme of things, for the greater good and such.    I dunno, on the other hand the whole putting someone in storage is a bit odd to say the least. and I'm only on the part where he's only been outside the shell once with the saving the captain bit and the whole vorlon thing is a bit teased but still mostly mysterious so for all i know they may seem angelic now but turn out to be mayor pains later on so i'm just speculating :)"

""For five years, as we struggled to find a home for Babylon 5, we were told that there was no market for a science fiction show of this nature, that the audience couldn't handle a five-year arc, that you couldn't compete with the juggernaut that was Star Trek.  We Sold the Pilot.  After we produced the pilot, everyone said there was no way we could afford to make the show on the scale necessary for the story, that television EFX weren't up to that level yet, that the market couldn't sustain more than one series about a space station. TV Guide critic Jeff Jarvis, weighing in on the odds of us making it to series said simply, 'fat chance.'  We Got the Series.  Every year of the series, the odds of renewal were always accompanied by the predictions of doom. The market was changing, the competition was fierce, and the fledgling network that carried us was becoming increasingly fragile.  We Continued to Get Renewed.  Finally, after the fourth season, during which the network itself folded its tent, we reached the point where it seemed that the fifth and final season might never materialize.  We Got the Fifth Season. We Told the Story We Wanted to Tell, and We Told It to Completion.  On the front of my house, there is an art deco door knocker, with a small silver plaque in the center. It contains just three words: ** 'Never Surrender Dreams.'**  Faith Manages.  Here Endeth the Lesson.""  J. Michael Straczynski, creator--Babylon 5 January 2004"

babylon5,190cnf,kaleph,3,Fri Feb 22 15:59:07 2013 UTC,"I understand, but is it really that expensive?  For TNG, a large part of the cost is that it was finished on video, and they are going back and finishing it on the original film.  B5 was filmed, and as long as it was never transferred to video, there's a cost savings right there.  Now, for the CGI, is it so expensive as to be cost prohibitive? B5 has always been a great seller on DVD for WB. And with a restored version, they can sell the license to air them to Netflix and television. It's not like they need to make 100% of their money from Blu Ray sales alone.  Additionally, considering the cost of CGI, I don't think it's going to cost so much that it'll break the bank. The show is already designed and storyboarded, so there's no necessary cost there. Just create models and then move them around. A lot of the ground work has already been done which is included in most CGI budgets that we hear about.  Besides, weren't the station and a few others recreated already after the tv show files were lost for The Lost Tales?? Even if not, you only create the station once, Star Furies once, White Stars once, etc. polish and change a few bits where needed, but then it's spread over 5 seasons!  So much of the original B5 CGI was reused a lot, so after you've spent the money for nice models of everything that appears multiple times, then you've freed up the rest of the budget for the one-time-only appearing CGI stuff.   Finally, DON'T compare it to Star Trek! Money is not made by comparing to another property, only if profit can be made and by what margin. You don't decide whether to go to work each day by determining if you'll make as much money as someone else, do you? No, you determine that by your needs and if your job is worth the reward.  TL;DR it is not an insurmountable goal! It is not as expensive as you think, especially when spread over 5 seasons! And the restoration work needed is not as much as TNG requires - they have to re-edit EVERY scene!"
babylon5,190cnf,FKRMunkiBoi,1 point,Fri Feb 22 16:37:25 2013 UTC,"So apparently the main problem with Star Trek is that you had a fuck-ton of shots of things like people standing in front of the viewscreen. And apparently this created a very difficult problem of it not being a straightforward problem of doing things like replacing viewcsreen graphics, but rather having to basically do everything from scratch. From what I understand of how B5 was done, this is really NOT an issue, you basically have live action shots with the completely independent CG stuff composited on top for the composite shots, and completely separate for the pure CG shots,  I was reading recently how apparently the live action shots, at least, WERE specifically recorded in at least 720p for future-proofing purposes. But then WB did the DVD transfers and by all accounts ""forgot"" that they had these 720p prints on hand and used the syndication prints instead. Rather sad, really.  So basically they wound up cropping the composite shots to accommodate the shit CG prints, IIRC. Hence the very obvious quality issues when they crop 4:3 content to 16:9 instead of using the 16:9 content that they already had on hand. (Beyond the fuzziness of the shots, you can tell when scenes seem awkwardly cropped. Especially in one of those ""ISN exclusive"" episodes where the ISN captions get cropped out.)"
babylon5,190cnf,Eurynom0s,1 point,Mon Mar 11 04:03:44 2013 UTC,"Supposedly it's not as bad you'd think. The CG would probably have to be redone, IIRC, (but this would probably be cheaper than CG was back when B5 was first made). Meanwhile apparently the rest of the shots WERE made in at least 720p.  I remember reading about this recently and one person described it as Warner Bros ""forgetting"" that they'd recorded everything in hi def SPECIFICALLY to future proof themselves against a future shift to HD. And from what I could surmise this wasn't a BBC recording over season 1 of Doctor Who situation, the higher def recordings seemed to have most definitely existed as of 10 years ago (at which point studious in general seemed to stop being complete idiots about this kind of thing). You'll notice that in the DVD transfers, the worst quality shots by a very obvious mile are composite shots (scenes where CG and live action are in the same shot, if it's a pure CG shot or a pure live action shot, the quality is basically fine and you're not going to really notice a quality dip).  It's pretty sad, TBH. They cropped down a lot of 4:3 shots to 16:9. It's pretty obvious when certain shots are cropped weird (cutting out parts of people's faces when you can kind of tell it shouldn't, for instance) but just BLATANT in one of those ""ISN exclusive"" episodes where the ISN captions are constantly not 100% in the frame."

babylon5,18z15r,Dayanx,7,Thu Feb 21 20:58:16 2013 UTC,"One of the things I loved about B5 was the lack of so-called ""technobabble."" While I appreciated the nods to theoretical physics during the Rick Berman era of Star Trek, at times it became overwhelming:   Yellow Shirt: ""Captain, if we vent the plasma drive into the temporal anomaly and then use a tachyon pulse to trigger an explosion we can proceed through the wormhole and arrive back in our own dimension!""   Blue Shirt: ""Or we could use a phase-warp transducer to create a static warp bubble around the ship and then modulate its harmonics with the forward deflector dish to prevent the rift from closing!""  Red Shirt: ""Do that thing you just said... with the other... thing.""  Is that storytelling?  Eh, maybe.  And how many times were the transporters not working used a plot device?  After a while it kinda started to get cliche and tired.  There was none of this in B5. Straightforward stories, a focus on the characters, their human flaws, motivations etc. I'm still a big Trek fan but B5 will always be #1 to me."

babylon5,18z15r,donkeycentral,5,Sun Feb 24 06:37:33 2013 UTC,"I still remember when I first saw the show. I was a child and at first like ""lol that looks so cheap"" and not really being a fan. But I kept watching (it was aired alongside star trek tng and ds9 here, so easy to just keep watching) and during the discovering of the shadows it manages to catch you. You want to know whats going on and the show doesn't go into a full season of fillers, it starts to get more serialized. It answers questions of previous seasons (bablyon 4) that on any other show would have been forgotten at this point. Before I even realized it, Babylon 5 became my favorite show. Still today there isn't much that comes close to this series. Stargate Universe had the potential to came close but never got the chance to tell its story, so Babylon 5 will probably remain on the throne forever, because I am not trusting todays tv stations to support a show long enough to tell its tale."

Unlike the more teenage scifi worlds, you are not fed a simple story and told what to expect by the end of the episode. As an adult you bring your own personal experiences and viewpoints (whatever they may be) to B5 and fill in the unspoken and unseen events of the story. JMS did what Shakespeare did, told a rousing good tale - but not all of it, he left that for his audience. The layering of story lines is impressive. Compare the story arcs of Lanier to Vir. Or ask yourself why do the Vorlons and the Shadows so revere Lorien?   I agree that the first year is weaker but understandably so, as there was not enough time and money to hone and polish things. I wish that B5 had been shot with today's technology and special effects. I deeply wish that time and care had been kinder to the original film media. We tolerate the poor special effects in the original Star Trek shows because our expectations of what could be done on film back then are so low. B5 suffers unfairly because it was recorded when CGI was in its infancy.   I have watched the whole series several times, and like reading a good book, each viewing reveals new subtleties in the story or the lives of the characters. B5 is like a diamond gemstone. There are flaws, yes, but when you hold it up to the light and reexamine them,  they make it all the more interesting."

B5 was also the first time where the producer of the show would interact with the fans in any meaningful way, and now that's not at all uncommon.  Similarly, the first time a show was written with a planned story arc for its duration. They were absolutely astonishing in the scope of what they did, and many shows since then have taken that example and run farther with it given new technology and the ability to learn from the mistakes of those who have come before.  And I still think B5 has a better, tighter story than those that came afterward. Battlestar Galactica, for example, did a great job but I really feel they were making stuff up towards the end."
babylon5,17mj57,tenkadaiichi,6,Thu Jan 31 19:37:45 2013 UTC,"Battlestar Galactica is the opposite of B5. Great visuals, cinema quality acting, no plan. B5? Early CGI, theatre acting that took a season or two to get used to (I'm looking at you, G'kar) and the most GRRMian or Tolkienian arc. B5 was when I realized that TV could tell novels' stories. BSG was when I realized how truly unique and monumental B5 was.   I showed my fiancèe BSG first. I wanted her to enjoy it, because B5 is the gold standard by which sci-fi is measured, in my book. It took her a season of B5 to get into it, but we just finished Deconstruction last night. Season 4 is one of the best seasons of television made.  BTW, no other show has Zathros. He would have made sure that Galactica never had stress fractures, but he would have ended up being pushed out an airlock. Horrible life, horrible death. At least there's symmetry."
babylon5,17mj57,drgradus,2,Sat Feb 2 17:26:24 2013 UTC,"Interesting, I am not quite sure what you mean by cinema quality acting as opposed to theatre acting. Can you clarify?  I do agree that the B5 acting took some time to mature and get used to. I wish we had more of Michael O'Hare though. He could have really shined if he had been given more time.  I was recently watching the JMS commentary on one of the episodes, and he mentioned that a lot of people wanted Sinclair replaced because of his wooden acting, but when he came back for WWE everybody thought it was fantastic and wanted more of him."
babylon5,17mj57,tenkadaiichi,3,Sun Feb 3 01:10:47 2013 UTC,"Theatre and cinema acting differ in the focus of attention.  [Here's] a quick rundown of the difference between acting methods required.   Since film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it 20 or 30 times, cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater.   and     as D. W. Griffith himself put it, the stage actor projects an emotion or a character to an audience, whereas a film actor must in some way embody and perform these emotions in as true and believable a way as possible   Especially G'Kar and Londo were theatre-style portrayals.  They voiced their characters boisterously without much room for intuiting their characterization for the audience.  This is absolutely required when on stage, since that deaf old lady keeps buying seats in the back row and she has to ""get"" the character.  On TV and cinema, one can take a more subtle approach, a la Brando chewing his way through scenes.  Film and television permit the actor to portray subtleties relating to the character and expect that an attentive audience understand the portrayal.  Theatre requires more vocal projection and larger movements. This doesn't always translate well to the screen; it seems melodramatic.  Theatre actors have to change how they portray characters through the different media.  Not all of them do that well or take time to figure it out."

The first episode I saw back in the day was ""By All Means Necessary"", which is a standalone episode but a very nice one. Since I didn't live in the US, I got it very erratically on cable and couldn't or didn't make an effort to follow the episodes in order. There were some bad episodes but I missed Infection, for example, which is the Worst Episode of Babylon 5 (in a close tie with that other one with the guy who thinks he's King Arthur). Overall, however, I got the better part of Season 1 and was hooked to the series when I saw Chrysalis. I love political intrigue."

babylon5,177u5m,Cern_Stormrunner,3,Thu Jan 24 23:44:54 2013 UTC,Possibly.
babylon5,177u5m,misho88,11,Fri Jan 25 00:54:43 2013 UTC,"For some of the races, it might be just because it doesn't help the narrative to introduce too much complexity. You have to keep in mind the audience doesn't necessarily want to keep track of that many details.  For other species like the Minbari, for at least a thousand years they've had 3 castes, each with its own language and traditions. They're a fairly ancient species that has become very homogeneous in each of its three castes, but quite different between them. Even males in the warrior caste have more pointy bones than males in the religious caste, indicating that interbreeding is rare.  The Narn definitely have several religions with different individuals being more or less devoted. In season 1, if I recall, G'Kar is a follower of G'Quan, having read his holy book, but doesn't much care about his religion, but steadily grows more religious as the writings of G'Quan are proven true. They do only seem to have one language, though (G'Kar explicitly says that the book of G'Quan is written in ""Narn"" when Garibaldi complains about having trouble reading it).   As the series progresses, you get hints that there's a lot more to the races than is outright presented, but they're all definitely more homogeneous than humans. I always got the feeling that the other species felt that it had to be humans that made Babylon 5 because we were the ones with most experience with bringing inhomogeneous cultures together. It also gives humans an advantage over the other races, all of which have been space-faring for quite a bit longer. Otherwise, at least in B5, humanity doesn't bring all that much to the table."
babylon5,177u5m,Cern_Stormrunner,4,Fri Jan 25 00:13:40 2013 UTC,"Just a quick note: Minbari will carve their headbones as a fashion statement. So its possible warrior caste either let theirs grow wild or have them sharpened, while religious caste sand theirs down. I think Lennier's crest starts fairly smooth but grows as he ages (and makeup improves)  Also, even among the castes their are differences. The warrior caste has five different clans if i recall correctly. And there are two religious groups mentioned that i can recall, the sisters of valeria (Delenns mom joined them) and Lenniers third fane of Chudomo.  I really wished we learned more about the worker caste. The book To Dream in the City of Sorrows has a pretty important worker minbari but thats about it"

babylon5,177u5m,WasabiSanjuro,3,Thu Jan 24 22:53:16 2013 UTC,"Absolutely. I've been considering that as well.  I think what is at the core of what's nagging me is a feeling that many of the alien races seem to be based on a political system / culture from human history, with some typical human traits (such as the need for vengeance) intensified.  I'm probably just a bit confused right now, but it all seems rather intriguing to me. I'm not complaining."
babylon5,177u5m,mpierre,6,Thu Jan 24 23:03:54 2013 UTC,The Drazi are infinitely more complex than you can ever imagine. Whomever pulls purple cloth out of basket is Purple.

babylon5,177u5m,Snevitje,4,Fri Jan 25 17:36:23 2013 UTC,It's a pretty standard sci-fi 'humans are special' narrative. Delenn explicitly says so at one point.
babylon5,177u5m,FellKnight,4,Fri Jan 25 20:57:56 2013 UTC,"My go-to assumption is that social uniformity, fanatic religiosity,  rituals, caste systems and so forth are all used to make aliens feel alien in sci-fi shows like these, contrasting with the familiar plucky, irreverent, secular, resourceful human muggles. ""We"" may have telepaths, but they're rarely spiritual.   And of course it's cheaper.  And most of the characters tend to be military and/or politicians, so there's a bit of a pre-selection to whom we get to see.  But yes, there's a background to the religiosity and ""order"" in B5, and the specialness of the humans is pointed out repeatedly as well."
babylon5,177u5m,elrac1,3,Sat Jan 26 15:43:04 2013 UTC,"This is mainly due to budget restrictions... a lot of costumes and effects were re-used.

babylon5,177u5m,aphroditex,3,Fri Jan 25 03:57:50 2013 UTC,"The ""out-of-universe- explanation would be that they didn't want to bog down the story and the universe too much by creating 30 different religions for every single race.  A possible historical explanation, in-universe, is that humans are noted in the show for their ability to weave together community of vastly different peoples and looking past the differences within the community. The other races are not nearly as good at that. So, any secondary religions within the other races are likely to have been ignored, excluded, or otherwise eliminated from the communities of the other races."
babylon5,177u5m,mpierre,2,Fri Jan 25 17:28:24 2013 UTC,"I think the Narn have 2 different major Prophets - G'Lan and G'Quon. The Minbari have only one religion but that is due to the unification of the casts by Valen. Still, the Minbari have a lot of differences in the interpretation and prophecies.   I think the simplification is just a necessity for a television show. You don't know where any particular viewer is going to start watching, so the aliens have to be rather distinct and homogeneous in most ways. I think Joe was asked this on usenet and said all the races had minority religions back home but the politics kept them there."

babylon5,16d0im,SHADOWJACK2112,18,Fri Jan 11 04:30:28 2013 UTC,"The Lurker's Guide was the first website that I remember spending lots of time reading (and still occasionally visit).  To me, it was the first place that I would see regular updates about something I cared about. It showed me there were other people asking some of the same questions I had, and actually getting response from the man on high. Sure, a lot of it came from discussions from the forums or Usenet, which I didn't have the courage or time to spend in, but it brought together so many things.   From here I found access to other dedicated fan pages created by people who not only enjoyed this great show, but had the energy and enthusiasm to create something to honor it. A community of people not content to lurk, but to question and seek and celebrate and share. The dissection of shows by fans spurred my own analytical skills in observing events unfolding not only in the show but in my own life. Their created stories, images and small temples invigorated my own fandom, something I'd before only took part in as a form of consumption.  The universe created by jms reinforced my desire to learn more about story telling. And though I lack his skills it helped me to appreciate the fundamentals of building a story so that it might unfold for others not only to witness but to become enthralled by. It gave me an awareness in character development I'd overlooked many times before.  And the thrill of seeing the creator comment, or the agony of waiting for a response, were things I'd never imagined to be felt. It's one thing to sit and watch or listen to a story, but when you know that the voice of the creator should quite possibly appear to enlighten upon a nagging question or reveal an overlooked gem, on a regular basis, that was like a little bit of christmas anticipation every time.  I know at the time there were many other sites for many different things each with their own fanbases and occasional visits from their authors or stars and such, but within this microcosm it seemed that we were all able to sit in the same room with the storyteller and share about something not only alive but woven so very vibrantly."
babylon5,16d0im,BrotherChe,6,Fri Jan 11 05:30:23 2013 UTC,Every time I watch B5 I read through the Lurker's Guide. It's a fascinating piece of internet history and innovation.

When it came back up, I started trying to download backups of every page for reference in case it ever disappeared. Just making sure the page links and images worked when I moved them around my drive... I don't know how many different crawlers I used trying to find the right one.   With those saves long gone, I'm so thankful the site still resides in that particular spot in cyberspace. Like a beacon in the night."

babylon5,16d0im,mrwoolery,3,Sat Jan 12 22:57:20 2013 UTC,"I am sure others noticed this as well:   It would be flat-out wrong to claim Babylon 5 was the first TV sci-fi show to implement season-long story arcs, since Buffy: The Vampire Slayer was doing the same thing at the same time.   First off lets look at the release dates:  Babylon 5 1994-1998 Buffy The Vampire Slayer 1997-2003  And take into consideration that JMS did The Gathering in 1993 and was writing up ideas years before that, I am claiming that B5 did it first."

babylon5,15gqrv,dreamCatalyst,9,Wed Dec 26 11:55:36 2012 UTC,"Here it is:  I’ve mentioned before that I still hear the characters from Babylon 5 talking in my head at all hours, especially at night when I’m trying to sleep. I alluded to one of them at the last convention I attended. I generally scour them out of my head when they come because if I don’t, if I let them accumulate, pretty soon character A has something to say about what character B said and it starts going nonstop. But this one, despite being brief, was rather tenacious. What follows is the exchange in full.  Visualize, if you will, as I unwillingly did, Londo walking alongside Sheridan. Unsurprisingly, Londo is doing all the talking here.  “I’m afraid I have a slight problem with your concept of a ‘bulls-eye.’ I have investigated this matter at length and it is simply a series of concentric circles with a dot in the center. It looks nothing at all like a bull, or an eye, or an eye of a bull. Not even a bull that had too much to drink the night before, unless you know something about the genetics of these creatures that I failed to discover in my research. Insofar as I can determine, a ‘bulls eye’ is nothing more than a big stiff piece of wood with a target on its front. Which brings me at last to YOU, Captain Sheridan....”"

babylon5,1481ky,bobchin_c,3,Mon Dec 3 22:40:10 2012 UTC,"In the DVD commentaries it's mentioned that EVERY character had a contingency plan for if the Actor decided or was forced to leave. This is talked about a lot in regards to Andrea Thompson's abrupt departure in Season 2 after they clearly spent time developing her to be Kosh's telepathic assistant (a role later filled by Lyta).  While some characters would be harder to replace than others, EVERYONE was replaceable if need be. JMS needed these contingency plans not to keep the actors in line, but so that he could keep telling the story he wanted to regardless of what happened with the actors.  Another pretty obvious example of this was replacing Claudia Christian in season 5 with Tracy Scoggins.  Theoretically there is a very large number of ""The Babylon 5 That Never Was"". One for every combination of characters and potential replacements."
babylon5,13xtqf,driscoll42,17,Wed Nov 28 16:30:25 2012 UTC,"I don't think it is so much level of advancement as it is implementation of advancement. What I mean is that aside from Jump gate technology most races developed independently. This can be seen easily by the differences in ships between different worlds. Notable exception being that Narn tech is mostly based off of Centari tech.  The League have been interacting for a long time, and warring off an on, this probably included the Dilgar. After a long period of time the league+dilgar probably knew how to fight eachother and had developed tech intended to respond to other groups tech. In this situation the Dilgar really only needed one key advantage over the others, that was provided by deathwalker. As such the Dilgar were able to sweep through the league.  Now then here comes earth, humans have been fighting eachother forever, as such they have a very well developed military, probably on par with the league as far as advancement goes. Their advantage however is that they have not fought witht he league before. The league and the dilgar do not have experience responding to human strategy, nor do they have anything meant to respond to humans unique weapon and defence systems.  So Earth tech was probably on par, or even less advanced, but they had surprise on their side. Nobody knew how to fight humans. In addition the Dilgar were probably weakened from the fight with the league.  The final advantage is mentioned in Babylon 5: Humans build communities. In the Dilgar war the Dilgar likely attacked the league one by one while convincing others that they were safe. The worlds that would eventually form the league likely stayed out of their neighbors fights hoping to be spared. By the time the league formed and the worlds started helping each-other it was probably too late. However when humans came in with a fresh force they were likely a nexus that gathered league support and tied together the force necessary to beat the dilgar."
babylon5,13xtqf,exodist,2,Wed Nov 28 16:54:57 2012 UTC,"Okay, thanks for answering it that makes sense. Did the League preexist the Dilgar War or was it formed in response to, a la the League of Nations?  Also another question which I presume I know the answer to if you don't mind. At the Battle of the Line when the Minbari surrendered to Earth after the whole soul thing, why didn't the Minbari just accept the Unconditional surrender of Earth? I assume it was an honor thing, trying to atone for killing so many ""Minbari souls"" but it just seems like by accepting the surrender of Earth it would have created far, far fewer questions/problems for them and would not have been seen as all that odd by the galaxy at large.  Edit: Also, it's said that the Minbari surrendered unconditionally to Earth after the war... any idea of the terms that were dictated afterward?"
babylon5,13xtqf,DKN19,1 point,Wed Nov 28 17:23:21 2012 UTC,"From what I could gather from the series, I believe the Minbari ""unconditional surrender"" was to the effect that they did not claim spoils of war, ie they returned all Earth colonies, took no prisoners and ceased fire immediately.  Also, ""unconditional"" in this case worked for both sides. Despite the surrender, Earth was in no position to negotiate. All borders returned to their pre-war status and I believe Earth took no prisoners of war as well (if they even had any)."
babylon5,13xtqf,mrwoolery,1 point,Thu Nov 29 04:38:19 2012 UTC,"The short answer is probably:  The aliens haven't even read Sun-Tzu, we wrote that shit.

Seeing things through her eyes, the production values are getting hard to ""swallow"", now being accustomed to a large HDTV, BluRay quality etc. However, with a few exceptions, the acting wasn't AS bad as I was afraid I would see it. Sure, Londo and G'Kar are in a class of their own, I can't argue with that. But I don't think Boxleitner is far off from being the perfect guy for this particular leading man-role. Also, Ivanova, ones she stops with the ""boo hoo psi corps done killed my mama"" bit all over the place in S1 has depth.

babylon5,12t3qz,Ameridrone,11,Thu Nov 8 04:01:34 2012 UTC,"It didn't do well because it was one of the first really serialized TV series.  Up to this point, TV series were episodic--you could tune in and watch any episode and the story would be stand alone.  With B5, you had to watch them in order, and the bigger story was more important than what was necessarily happening in each episode.  TV viewers, especially scifi viewers, weren't used to this in the early 90's...it was essentially a new way to present the show and people didn't catch on by watching single episodes.  It tended to get passed by viewers who didn't catch on immediately, and it tended to get lost by station programming that would juggle the show's schedule.  The show always struggled, but as someone who watched it when first aired, I was absolutely ENTHRALLED by the show.  For it's time, it gave Star Wars a run for its money in terms of the awesomeness of the B5 universe and storytelling.  Nowadays, the production values, acting, and writing seem cheap...but it's still VERY much worth watching.  The first season is tedious because it spends most of it's time building background information, developing characters and the universe.  It really picks up from there, though, and you'll miss out on a lot of context if you skip it."

babylon5,11tj82,gragsmash,8,Sun Oct 21 14:27:32 2012 UTC,"Personally, I disagree with Glitch. The fifth season does feel strange and also less meaningful than the previous season, but I feel that was because JMS didn't believe their would be a 5th season since WB cancelled it and so he had to wrap up many plot points in the 4th season that could have been extended into the 5th and blossomed further.   The fifth season starts slow and odd-feeling, but I feel it is worth watching for the fulfilment of Londo, Lennir and G'Kar's character lines, who seemed to get nothing at the end of the 4th season. Great twists or ends to those three. Not to mention, the end of the series would have felt very sharp if done at the end of the 4th season. The 5th season beautifully draws out the goodbyes over the last couple episode and creates an ending worthy of a 5 year story.  I recommend the 5th season, but know that it starts slowly."

babylon5,11ezfy,uzi20,8,Sat Oct 13 15:10:40 2012 UTC,"When I first watched the show, I got very bored with the first season and skipped a sizable chunk of it.  I have been rewatching it, and have no idea what was wrong with me back then.  I kind of like Delenn more in the first season, because she seems more mysterious and less benign than she becomes once she grows hair.  In a more direct response to your post, one of my favorite parts of the show always was that humans, although the center of the show, were not the absolute center of the universe, as it often seemed in Star Trek.  Humans qualities were important to the battle against the Shadows, but so were Minbari and those of the Non-Aligned Worlds.  Humanity's flaws were always on display, from the political infighting of Earth's government to Dr. Franklin's drug addiction.   The flaws are as important to humanity's success as their strengths, and the Minbari, or at least Delenn, knew it.  Not sure if that makes sense, but, regardless, go Bone-Head Delenn!!"

Where another race would surrender to despair, the humans fought back with greater strength. They made the Minbari fight for every inch of space. In my life, I have never seen anything like it; They would weep, they would pray, they would say goodbye to their loved ones, and then throw themselves without fear or hesitation at the very face of death itself, never surrendering. No one who saw them fighting against the inevitable could help but be moved to tears by their courage, their stubborn nobility. When they ran out of ships, they used guns, when they ran out guns, they used knives and sticks and bare hands. They were magnificent. I only hope that when it is my time, I may die with half as much dignity as I saw in their eyes in the end. They did this for two years; they never ran out of courage. But in the end, they ran out of time."""

How about when he hands over his burden (in the form of Excalibur) to Delenn? May not be a super powerful moment, but I though it was a tad moving.   Whenever I think of that episode I think of the scene when Arthur was freaking out and shouts ""Their horses were on fire!"" with the reflection of flames in his eyes. For whatever reason I really enjoyed that.  Also the name of the ship he served aboard (not exclusive to this episode I know) had good meaning. Prometheus brought fire (used to cook, forge weapons, etc) to Man. In mythology this is a positive thing for Man, but the ship Prometheus brought another kind of fire to man; a fire of Minbari rage, death and destruction on an awesome scale. I think that was a good twist on the myth."

I always loved his smartass comments (forgive the quality). His replacement though, Ulkesh, now that dude was a dick.  Now when I think worst, I think of the Stribe from All Alone in the Night. They were so shitty I couldn't even find them on Google images, and was forced to take my own screencaps. It's so painful I have to apologize for it.   While I'm at it, I thought that G'Kar's aide Na'toth had excellent potential to be a great character, like Vir. Too bad Julie Caitlin Brown decided to leave and they replaced her with Mary Kay Adams, who has the same ferocity as a cat on Xanax. Very disappointing. The scene where Julie Na'toth kicks the crap out of G'kar to break his pain givers was priceless."

Sure he probably had to die, the ""get the hell out of our galaxy"" probably wouldn't have went the same way and the humans wouldn't have moved on to what they became had he been there..  I just HATED to see him go.  For me the series changed when the ""father figure"" departed.  4 or 5 times ive seen this series, this is still the worst part of it for me.

babylon5,1186a1,HellaSober,0,Wed Oct 10 05:35:37 2012 UTC,"I thought that how they portrayed the Human religions amounted to pandering and cowardice. All of the other major races demonstrated ceremonies from their dominant religions, yet when it was the turn for Humanity, we show them dozens of religious figures without any semblance of details.  In our present time, Catholicism is the dominant religion, with Islam not far behind. I do not know what the dominant religion would be in 2257, but I am quite doubtful that American Indian religions would have any part in it.  The refusal to designate a human dominant religion or belief system (even a setting-specific one such as Foundationalism) while showcasing single religions for the other races are limited shows a...  A) Lack of creativity. This is unlikely as those in charge were quite successful in attempts to characterize the setting. If they were to create their own religious ceremony, this could have been fixed. B) Fear of offending someone. This is probable, but could also have been fixed with some creativity.  Ultimately, the decision to show religious leaders from all backgrounds and traditions was merely a groveling attempt at political correctness and the promotion of 'religious tolerance' despite the fact that all of the other races went with a single tradition for their demonstrations.  It's not really that big of a deal, but I feel that it did cheapen the episode quite a bit. Fortunately, this occurs at the very end."
babylon5,1186a1,philh,7,Wed Oct 10 06:09:10 2012 UTC,"See what i got out of it was that the other races were monolithic in their religeous beliefs, while humans were diverse. It ties back into what Delenn had said about how humans build communities.   Made me feel good that 200 odd years from now humanity still had the same beliefs as we do now.   As a Catholic, i always appreciated the way JMS handled religion, even though he is an atheist. Your milage may vary of course.   As an example i remember an episode of STAR TREK VOYAGER where Janeway was dieing and saw her dead father, but it turned out it was some kind of alien parasite who fed on the dead. Contrast that with the episode of B5 when Lyta did the deathbed scan on the dieing Ranger. All they showed was a tunnel of light, no explanation as to what it was, its left up to the viewer.  I showed my born again christian friend and my aunt who is a nun the LOST TALES episode with the demon possessed guy. They both really enjoyed it."
babylon5,1186a1,Cern_Stormrunner,3,Wed Oct 10 13:14:16 2012 UTC,"Well I think of it as the humans trying to show that they don't have a state sanctioned religion. The dominant religions of other races are often involved in the governance of their civilizations (see Minbari) - so the humans might see their secular tolerant nature as an important differentiation.   Of course, imagining humans to be the only ones like this is a bit far fetched."

babylon5,114ewe,Stupid_Ned_Stark,13,Mon Oct 8 04:18:39 2012 UTC,"So many amazing scenes like this that there too many to count. It saddens me that I've tried to introduce this show to so many friends, colleagues, and acquaintances, only to be almost unanimously shot down with cries of ""the effects and makeup in season 1 are so bad, I just couldn't watch it."" Those weaklings are missing some of the best scenes ever written for television."
babylon5,114ewe,Stupid_Ned_Stark,3,Mon Oct 8 04:46:27 2012 UTC,"Oh, the effects are by far the worst thing about it. The first season in particular is just painful to watch because it looks so bad. I think they were just working on such a shoestring budget that that's all they could accomplish. If they had the budget of something like a Paramount show, which JMS went to first but was rejected supposedly, I think a lot more people would know about it. The arc for everyone is probably the best I've seen in television, in terms of sticking to a vision, you are absolutely right.  I totally disagree that Londo and G'Kar are the only ""non-wooden"" performances though. They are consistently the best, I'll give you that, but I think everyone on the show was given their time to shine. I would add Sheridan, Garibaldi and Delenn to the list of roles that were written and acted the best. I think the problem is that JMS adds a little too much theatrics and soap-opera style soliloquys that sometimes fall flat, but for the most part I thought the writing was one of the best aspects of the show.  I totally agree about Crusade, it was a cool idea that was just horribly executed, but supposedly the studio interfered a lot with JMS' plans, which is why he left it and it was canceled so early. As for the movies, In The Beginning is pretty amazing, I think, and by far the best, while A Call To Arms was decent. The rest of the movies were pretty awful though.  As for your comparisons, I would put B5 above everything on that list except for maybe TNG, but even though I think there have maybe been better sci-fi shows to come along (BSG reboot, Firefly, Lost even), I still like B5 the best. I really think that if there was some way to get the effects totally redone to today's standards, it would make a huge difference on people's perceptions of it. The payoff from the story arcs and the main storyline in general is I think still unmatched."

babylon5,114ewe,co_fragment,1 point,Tue Oct 9 02:41:43 2012 UTC,I don't actually. I think the quality of improved CGI would be pretty jarring next to the bare-bone nature of the sets. This is why I don't like the ST:TOS updates. The two quality levels just don't fit.  I'm currently watching episodes of the first Doctor Who and you really have to put aside qualms about the production values to try and appreciate the larger story. The same should be true of both ST:TOS and B5.
babylon5,114ewe,sleepdeprivedtechie,1 point,Mon Oct 15 04:03:11 2012 UTC,"Agreed that Crusade was awful, though it had a (very) few bright spots, mostly around the thief and the Technomage. Thinking about it, the thief reminds me a lot of Sophie on Leverage, though more self-assured. My favorite Crusade quote:  ""You never told me you were a member of the Thieves' Guild!"" ""The trick to keeping an organization secret is to not go around telling everyone about it.""  As for B5 - the acting was hit-and-miss. As for the scripts, I finally figured out that JMS' true talent is setting up set pieces and speeches. The man has a gift for incredible speeches. Outside of speeches, the scripts run hot and cold.   I am incredibly forgiving on SFX because when they started they were rendering everything on a single Amiga with Video Toaster. Now this runs counter to my standard opinion about art should stand on its own, but I simply cannot fault the shortcomings considering what they had to work with.   In addition, Babylon 5 gave us the space battles we'd been wanting to see since the first time the Enterprise fired phasers. The battle in ""Severed Dreams"" is jaw-dropping, both as an SF space battle but also for the emotional impact of it being a civil war - brother fighting against brother.   All of that makes for a pretty damn good show. But then, as you said, it has the arc layered on top. That puts it in the top echelon of ""greatest SF ever.""   And this, my friend, is wisdom that should outlive us all:   I believe when we leave a place, part of it goes with us and part of us remains. Go anywhere in the station, when it is quiet, and just listen. After a while, you will hear the echoes of all our conversations, every thought and word we've exchanged. Long after we have gone our voices will linger in these walls, for as long as this place remains. But I will admit that the part of me that is going, very much will miss the part of you that is staying."

babylon5,110bw9,SgSpecial180,2,Fri Oct 5 20:38:11 2012 UTC,That makes sense.  I wonder if that would have been an episode if they hadn't had to cut the arc to fit season 4.    Would have been a good payoff for that character.
babylon5,110bw9,SgSpecial180,16,Fri Oct 5 21:08:56 2012 UTC,"Yeah I think it would have been great to explore. Being B5 though, I don't think it would have ended well. I can imagine it going down something like this:  Clark realizes Franklin may be able to slow down Sheridan, due to his ties with his son so he dispatches Franklin with a fleet to intercept.   Captain Sheridan aboard the Agamemnon encounters Gen. Franklin in the Schwarzkopf, both with supporting fleets. Sheridan hails Gen. Franklin and pleas for him to stand down, citing illegal orders, etc. He tried to get Stephen on the link but all communications are jammed. Franklin gives the 'sorry, but it's my duty' speech and the two exchange fire. Franklin's support ships are aced out, and the Schwarzkof is critically damaged. Sheridan pleas once more for him to stand down, but Franklin continues to refuse. Sheridan is now able to patch through to B5 and is finally able to get Stephen on the com. Stephen begs his father to stand down, but alas Gen. Franklin with tears in his eyes delivers some heart wrenching line about duty, and how he loves and is proud of Stephen. He then opens fire on Sheridan again, who is forced to destroy him, and Stephen watches his father die."

I'd have the rest of it remastered as best as possible so matches the new CGI (but I wouldn't add anything).   At the same time I'd buy the SyFy channel and return it to it's proper SciFi roots. I'd use it as a platform to relaunch B5. I start with The Gathering and go from there, keeping everything in order. I'd also have it streaming for free online, because that's how I roll. Then I'd release it all on Blu Ray, but each release would also include the completely untouched original versions.  And I wouldn't stop there.

They were secretly developed by the Minbari Religious Caste under the supervision of Ulkesh and were used to test the hybrid Vorlon technology that was being developed for the new White Star class warships.  The hybrid fighters were single-pilot ships, similar to Earthforce's Starfuries but much more powerful and maneuverable, able to match the capabilities of even a Shadow Fighter.  Though only slightly larger than a Shadow Fighter, the Hybrid fighters are similar in configuration to the White Stars and the later Snub-nose Whitestar, featuring a central cockpit flanked by port and starboard mounted engine nacelles. Also like a White Star, the fighters feature a Vorlon organic auto-repair system. The fighters' cockpits were pressurised and equipped with full life-support systems, however, Entil'Zha Sinclair decided that like in Earthforce, pilots should wear full pressure suits as a backup precaution.  Only three examples are known to have been built, all of which were deployed under the command of Entil'Zha Sinclair on a mission to Sector 14.  (-To Dream in the City of Sorrows)"""

I started watching in Season 4 (Epiphanies) because Walter Koenig was guest starring and I had just watched Star Trek IV The Voyage Home (huge ST fan).  When it was being re-aired on TNT from the beginning while airing Season 5 at the same time, I recorded every episode on tape and kept a database of the episodes on each tape.  Needless to say, I was obsessed.  Fast forward 16 years or so, Babylon 5 is still my favorite TV show.  I rewatched it recently (Season 5 is so hard to get through), and the writing is so amazing.  G'Kar and Londo are my favorite characters (along with Morden, of course), they have had some amazing quotes.

babylon5,zuy4n,ann_no_aku,6,Fri Sep 14 13:19:47 2012 UTC,I  haven't rewatched it yet. Is it fun picking out bits of foreshadowing?
babylon5,zuy4n,philwelch,5,Fri Sep 14 03:53:31 2012 UTC,"Yes!  Yes X1000 :)  I'm rewatching it for the countless time, on S5 E6 ""Strange Relations,"" and I'm always surprised by new literary or cinematic elements that I hadn't seen before or fully appreciated.  Sometimes I think how strange it is to have a plot that has been revealed by way of foreshadowing, however the writing does an excellent job of accounting for and incorporating these concepts into the story lines.  If you doubt this, consider the forces at play in the introspective S5 Ep 2 ""The Very Long Night of Londo Mollari."""
babylon5,zuy4n,00Batou,3,Fri Sep 14 04:10:22 2012 UTC,"SPOILER  It's funny because ""geometry of shadows"" has an arbitrary Drazi revolution to establish dominance and make their race stronger. That pretty much foreshadows the Shadow philosophy in a nutshell."

babylon5,zuy4n,moriquendo,5,Wed Oct 3 22:12:39 2012 UTC,"I started again about three weeks ago. This time around I wondered whether to skip over season 1 and see what the experience would be like without it. But after the first two episodes, which are a bit awkward, I realised just how much foreshadowing there is. At least half of the episodes in that season are in my opinion a must-watch.  I must say though, I was relieved to get to Season 2 and have Bruce on screen again.  Also, having read the ""Echoes of our Conversations"" books, it's even more interesting to spot things that they talk about - things you would never look for ordinarily."

Also keep in mind that the Omegas had more weapons that were never used in the series, like the dual heavy mine launchers under the front fighter bay and the heavy missile batteries between the head and rotating section(the red hatches).

babylon5,zca5b,JohnoTheFoolish,2,Wed Sep 5 09:44:35 2012 UTC,"Larger EA ships have jump engines and do not require gates. The White Stars were unique as ships that small normally didn't have jump engines. In the first season, pirates were using a mother ship that could dock their raiders and form its own jump points.  Near stations or settled planets, the polite thing to do is transit in via the local gate. Opening a jump point unannounced in an occupied system is both risky (risk of collision) and possibly an act of aggression."

babylon5,zca5b,JohnoTheFoolish,1 point,Wed Sep 5 15:46:43 2012 UTC,I think the size of the engines was the limiting factor. Earth technology was fairly clunky compared to the other races so the jump capable ships were much larger.

Vipers are faster, but Starfuries and Thunderbolts are more maneuverable. Also, it seems the Omega carries more fighters than a Battlestar. The Omega's energy weapons are a huge advantage, moreso I think than the Battlestar's seemingly superior interceptor screen. But then again, Battlestars can create their own jump points. They've both got nukes, so that's a wash.  This is a tough one. But if I had to choose, I'm going with the Omega.   What about the Minbari Cruiser vs. a Basestar?"

babylon5,zca5b,philwelch,1 point,Wed Sep 5 17:38:14 2012 UTC,"Galactica wins. It has short-range jumping ability which provides greater effective maneuverability, its main batteries can fire broadside rather than having to face the entire ship towards the target, and Vipers can match the maneuverability of Starfuries with greater speed and better missile armament. The bridge of the Omega is also more exposed than Galactica's CIC, which is at the center of the ship. Also, Galactica is hardened against direct impact with nuclear weapons, while a nuclear impact would cripple or destroy an Omega class ship. Since the Galactica could deploy a nuke close-in with a Raptor that might be decisive."
babylon5,zca5b,mrwoolery,2,Wed Sep 5 16:03:50 2012 UTC,"Omegas can fire broadsides, too.  All the large cannon batteries on the Omega can swivel to be brought to bear, just as the the Galactica's can.  The Bridge of an Omega is also deep within the vessel, just as the Galactica's CIC.  Both ships are hardened against direct assault...the Omega is actually built specifically to take a beating to get closer and force a close range melee, as part of EA starship combat doctrine (thus the reason it has strong interceptor screens as well).   Only the beam weapon is forward fixed.  The only way Galactica could win would be to guarantee a nuke impact, which is unlikely to occur on both sides of the battle.  Starfuries also have missile capability, and it's unlikely a Raptor would get close enough with a nuke to strike (interceptor screens).  I think some of the deciding factors would actually be sensor capability and manueuvering.  In BSG, it's been shown that stealth can be achieved over DRADIS by going passive, while that doesn't work in B5.  That may be a factor that would lead to successful tactics.  BSG does have the ability to do quicker jumps than Omega, though."
babylon5,zca5b,philwelch,1 point,Wed Sep 5 20:36:04 2012 UTC,"The only way Galactica could win would be to guarantee a nuke impact   Jump a Raptor close in, beyond the Omega class's defensive screen."
babylon5,zca5b,babylon5ftw,1 point,Thu Sep 6 02:34:24 2012 UTC,"Omega wins but not without taking some damage.  Fighter vs Fighter: Starfuries have the advantage in armor, firepower and endurance compared to Vipers.  In the maneuverability department they are probably very close with the Viper being a bit more maneuverable.  I would say that it would take two to three Vipers to match one Starfury.   Fighter vs. Capital Ship:  Given the sheer amount of flak/interceptor fire both ships should be able to put out, I would say that neither fighter would survive a direct assault.        Raptors: Just plain fucked if going up against Starfuries or even a half way decent interceptor grid.  About the only advantage they have is if they would jump right on top of the Omega to launch a nuke but that would be a suicide run as they wouldn't be able to get out of range of the blast wave in time.  Galactica vs. Omega: Here is where it gets interesting.  The Omega was designed to deal with energy weapons but I'm sure that kinetic weapons would still deal damage and definitely sure that nukes would cripple/destroy an Omega.  The Galactica however was designed to deal with kinetic weapons and nukes but energy weapons weren't even considered.  I would give the advantage to a ship equipped with energy weapons because they are capable of dealing a massive amount of damage to a single point rather than being spread over a large area.  I'd say that even the smaller plasma cannons on an Omega would be capable of punching through the hull of a Galactica class Battlestar in a relatively short time especially since targeting computers would be able to direct all the fire to a single point.  Get the forward or rear weapons arc involved with dual laser cannons and a Galactica class Battlestar would be carved up faster than a turkey on Thanksgiving.  Now I will grant that the Galactica can throw out a significant amount of firepower from all directions so an Omega isn't going to walk away completely unscathed.  If they managed to place a few lucky shots, take out a few weapons emplacements on either broadside, it is possible that the Galactica could come out the victor but they'd sustain heavy damage in the process."
babylon5,zca5b,mrwoolery,-1,Sat Sep 8 17:29:32 2012 UTC,"I'll have to go with a Battlestar, yes the omega class has energy weapons however, What would it do against Nukes? The defense grid on the Omega class is not overly affect, and with the help of Viper support, I believe the omega class would not fair to well."
babylon5,zca5b,babylon5ftw,3,Tue Sep 4 16:59:39 2012 UTC,"Both the Omega and Galactica have nukes, and both have interceptor screens to prevent the nukes from getting within useful range, so I'd generally rule those out as overt weapons (though they might be useful by both as mines).  I think it'd come down to tactics and logistical capability, too.  I'm still leaning towards the Omega because it has the beam weapon capability.  If both ships went full interceptor/anti-fighter on all projectile based weapons, the Omega could still bring a huge energy weapon to bear on the Galactica."

babylon5,w48bi,nicholb,8,Sat Jul 7 07:00:13 2012 UTC,"(replace two main characters, wtf?)   That was because of actors(/having to leave) rather than something that was planned/intentional.  Having said that, though, one of the many amazing things about the show is that JMS planned around actors leaving. Every main character in the series has a story, but he also had ""what-if"" scenarios for every major character leaving, shadow characters who could replace anyone as-needed, and alternate ways to get to the same plot points.  The upshot of all this is that no one was irreplaceable, and the plot would not (and did not) fall apart should any of the actors leave/get fired/die. It's jarring that the commander would leave at the end of S1 but honestly, the amount of contingency planning really shows, and S2 isn't any worse for the changes as a result.  I wish more shows had planning to this degree. It seems like we're lucky if the creators even have a plotline/ending in mind when they begin a series, let alone have contingency plans like ""what do we do if our lead gets hit by a bus?"""

It stands alone okay as long as you explain the basics, its heartwarming and funny and the characters are brilliant. And then when you get them hooked properly they can watch it again on their way through season 2 and pick up all the nuances and in-jokes they missed the first time :)  For similar reasons, Born to the Purple and War Prayer are fairly self-contained and have excellent character development. (Well, Londo development; I can't help it, I love him, I think he's great.)"
babylon5,v6b8j,sennalvera,2,Sun Jun 17 12:49:41 2012 UTC,Upvote for War Prayer. That's a good choice.
babylon5,v6b8j,sleepdeprivedtechie,5,Sun Jun 17 23:49:28 2012 UTC,"I started my husband with the first season and a major warning that ""it doesn't really get good until the second season.""  It took us about a month to trudge through the first season, then another month for seasons 2-5.  To me, its a series you can't ""just start anywhere"" and understand the feelings and storylines, like Star Trek.  You can't appreciate G'Kar and Londo without knowing the history behind the Narn and Centari."
babylon5,v6b8j,Hairy_Seldon,8,Mon Jun 18 01:12:46 2012 UTC,"The first episode of Season 1 deals with Narn taking over a Centari World. It is a fine episode.  In it Kosh says ""They are a dying race, you should let them die.'  Sinclair asks ""The Centari or the Narn""  Kosk answers 'Yes""  If someone doesn't like this episode, let them watch Stargate or some other shit."
babylon5,v6b8j,kraetos,3,Mon Jun 18 00:30:48 2012 UTC,Yep. Midnight on the Firing Line. Starting anywhere else would be confusing and counterproductive. MotFL was written with the express intent of being a quick hook into the series. That's what it's there for.
babylon5,v6b8j,cocoamix,3,Thu Jun 21 21:49:57 2012 UTC,"I used Believers to intro my wife to the series. Mainly because I knew the child's story would affect her and it's a great example of This Ain't Your Dad's Star Trek as in Trek, the kid would have lived and all would be hunky dory. A good example of what kinds of risks the show is willing to take.  However, I agree with all who have said In The Beginning. Great story, great effects, stellar moments, and only really spoils the first season. Doesn't even really spoil it. After all, as JMS himself has said: knowing how the story ends is nothing. It's watching how it gets to that point. Watching all the mystery about the Minbari surrender is still interesting even of you already know what really happened."
babylon5,v6b8j,mr_soren,5,Sun Jun 17 23:48:04 2012 UTC,"I think In the Beginning, while it does spoil a lot, may be worth it for someone unfamiliar with the series, especially it it gets them started watching it.

I did schedule three snack breaks tho with delicious food so she had lots of motivation to power through.  After the first season she was the antagonist, demanding we watch B5 instead of other stuff :P  Edit: Also, if anyone out there has a similar guide for ST:TNG, BSG or DS9 I'd really appreciate it if you could link me!

Aside from hearing that a 5-year arc was planned (much like B5), I hadn't heard anything. What you've posted here is incredibly fascinating.  I'm not terribly fond of Crusade. But, my biggest problem with Crusade is that it was really starting to capture me towards the end, and then blammo - cancelled."
babylon5,v6133,Circuitfire,8,Sun Jun 17 04:47:43 2012 UTC,"As someone that was lurking in the B5 forums a the time it aired, I feel I should point out that Crusade was cancelled before it even aired! It never had a chance, the producers and network got in a pissing contest over changes to the series. Network wanted to 'sex it up' (think 7 of 9). They even aired them in the wrong order (if you are wondering about why the uniforms changed one episode to the next) Over a decade later, I'm still pissed off at TNT.   **Edit: Additional  I also seem to remember TNT dicking the series over with contracts so that it couldn't be picked up by another network (Sci-Fi tried). Something like holding the right to the series beyond the point where the actor's retainer contracts expired. Basically TNT refused to even take offers for the rights until long after the actor's contracts expired and they had to move on to other jobs (actors gotta eat)."

Not to be rude to idiot network execs who cancel perfectly good shows without giving them a legitimate shot, but 'sex it up'? Seriously? Sure, there were sexy people in Babylon 5. But it was never really a sexy show, and it wasn't really a show that should have been sexy. Why would the expect the spin-off to be sexy? Oh... 7 of 9. Ridiculous.  If the only thing that was needed to keep the show going was a sexy lady (why is it never sexy dudes?!), they should have just cast someone as Sexy Space Lady. However, since I am not a Soulless Bastard TV Executive Who Cancels Great Shows, I don't see why they needed to sex the show up to begin with. And who's to say they wouldn't have added sexy people as the show progressed? 7 of 9 wasn't even in ST:Voyager until the end of season 3!  Now I will spend the next decade pissed at TNT as well! Hooray!"
babylon5,v6133,razzmatazz1313,2,Sun Jun 17 14:41:24 2012 UTC,"While I agree with your statement, Look at it from TNT point of view. The appearance of 7 of 9 drew ratings. When she became a regular, the ratings went up 60 percent.(numbers may not be completely true, but huge increase.)  If I were a network exec I would want to throw some sexy to at least get the stupid males to watch also."
babylon5,v6133,Circuitfire,7,Sun Jun 17 14:57:21 2012 UTC,"Babylon 5 did good enough ratings on TNT in the 5th season to warrant the green-lighting of Crusade in the first place, so it wasn't a low ratings issue. Retooling, or even cancelling a show that wasn't doing great would be understandable. But TNT cancelled it before a single episode aired. Fuck the audience, fuck the ratings: they flat out cancelled it because they didn't get a chance to meddle in a show that was designed with a tightly designed long-term story arc as its successful predecessor. Let's count all the fantastic TNT original series with a huge following. Let's count them!  ...   ...   ...   ...   ...  Fuck TNT, I still hate them."

When she returns from this event, she has a sword/knife that glows whenever Gideon is around. (shades of Sting from Lord of the Rings)  Gideon was going to be shot in the season finale. His consciousness would be trapped in the Apocalypse Box for a bit.  Somehow Matheson gains a ""techno-telepathy"" ability from the Box  the Excalibur crew exposes Earth Force screwing around with Shadow-tech, gets branded traitors, goes on the run.

babylon5,v6133,Ohmstar,6,Sun Jun 17 10:03:59 2012 UTC,I loathed the idea of the techno-mages and I think it really detracted from the show.   the big secret behind the mages was that their abilities derived from Shadow-tech. They were essentially a counter to how the Vorlons created telepaths.  Galens mission was to track down the people who were using shadowtech - which would have turned out to be a faction of Earth Force. the ship that killed the Cerberus was in fact a human vessel made with back engineered shadow stuff. It went nuts (since its sort of alive) and thats why it attacked Gideons old ship.

It's the heartbreaking re-enslavement of the Narn, the collapse of the Centari into Shadow domination, the key event that will move G'Kar from an annoying blowhard to a hero of the resistance to a prophet and man of peace, that shifts Mollari from an amusing buffoon to a mass-murderer who's also lost control of his secret weapon.    Sheridan becomes the joint head of the Rangers, and his move to accept G'Kar is the first concrete step to move openly against Earth.  It's also an episode that was perfect.  As a piece of film-making it transcended what was expected from TV 20-odd years ago and moved into the realm of cinema, and bloody good cinema at that: the sequence where the destruction of the Narn fleet is intercut with G'Kar's prayers would be one any number of film directors would be happy to have in their highlight reel."

babylon5,ubj9u,Cern_Stormrunner,1 point,Wed May 30 15:58:39 2012 UTC,"It seems like the biggest strategic obstacle to that would be the relatively small B5 fan base, and I suppose that the easiest way to expand the fan base would be to work to get B5 back on TV somewhere. I'm not sure how this could be possible, but I'd assume it would require a catalyst that leads significantly more people to be interested in B5, even on a small level.   There are enough requests for the best ways to introduce people to the series that it seems we could do something to drive people toward these hook episodes or movies. Just for example, if In The Beginning is the best hook we have, then we could work to produce a great and creative mod for a popular game centered on the Earth-Minbari war that people might play just because it's fun. They might become curious enough to watch the movie. If it's fun for non-B5 fans and tied to whatever we think best hooks new viewers to the show, we could leverage that down the line to push for syndication, and maybe resurrection someday."

I think they would have to redo all of the CGI, which actually would be pretty cool to see. But alas, these things cost money...   I thought the CGI in the Lost Tales was pretty great, and wouldn't mind seeing the old series redone with the same quality CGI. I know some people would scream blasphemy, but as long as we had access to the originals I think it would be OK. JMS isn't a douche like some... other scifi creator so I dont think that would be a problem ;)"
babylon5,too8r,SgSpecial180,4,Tue May 15 20:15:50 2012 UTC,The CGI source files were lost. Also some of the film was damaged. So you are right that they can't do it for these reasons.

babylon5,too8r,stevekez,5,Tue May 15 20:40:02 2012 UTC,"I also heard that for The Lost Tales they borrowed models from various modding (Homeworld B5, etc) communities to make up for the lost originals."

Apparently they filmed on 35mm so a 16:9 or indeed Blu-Ray transfer of the live action is quite probable but the early CGI work is 4:3, exceptionally low poly and was done on Amiga's with a video toaster module.... Season 1 of B5 really is the Amiga strutting just as hard as it can.   BUT all of that would need to be remade from scratch.  At this point in time even if the later Lightwave models still exist they'd be laughably bad.  I'd go so far as to say if you stuck a low-budget SyFy movie CGI element next to a Starfury from B5 (or a Shadow ship) the SyFy crapfest will look better.   Saying that though, I want to know how the Crusade to end the Drakh plauge ended, I want to see what happened during the last Great Shadow War... it's a universe full of stories and I think rather than retelling an old one (i.e. remastering B5) we should petition JMS to tell us some new ones."
babylon5,too8r,Vaneshi,1 point,Mon Jul 2 16:18:24 2012 UTC,"I agree 100%. I would also like to see them expand upon the first war, the one that B4 was used in. Too bad they rescued the human crew from B4... it would have been cool to leave them stuck in the past so you could have that as a story to visit (though it might cause some problems as you are introducing the humans to the Minbari early, but you could say that it was a small human crew and they were forgotten over time). You could also explore other events that happened at the same time, like the Narn uprising against the Shadows that were on their planet. I invision a pretty powerful scene of the Narn telepaths sacrificing themselves to rid Narn of the Shadows... and imaging it like how JMS would tell gives me goosebumps lol. I don't know if you could get away with a whole series devoted to that, but it would make for a good mini series.  You could also easily do made for TV movies about the first Centauri occupation of Narn, the Dilgar War, etc.  I would just hate for B5 to end... there's just too much story left to tell and right now we need a good epic sci fi series. There is NOTHING filling that spot on TV right now.

I would love to see B5 updated to modern standards for effects and video quality, but it isn't going to happen and 100 signatures certainly isn't enough to prove a point to the studio. This kind of work is really expensive and would require enough return on investment to justify. Paramount is only now getting around to updating Star Trek: TNG and we know that will make orders of magnitude more than B5 ever will. I'm sorry to say that this isn't going to go anywhere.

I think you could do without The Gathering; I like it, but it's not all that important, as the plot points are referenced elsewhere on the show. Call To Arms is cool, but just feels like a lead-in to Crusade, which it is. I rather liked Lost Tales, but it seems most people didn't."
babylon5,tijbz,Stupid_Ned_Stark,1 point,Fri May 11 21:18:26 2012 UTC,"I think In the Beginning is a great hook for the show. I started with B5 by catching the last 10 minutes of Endgame on WB, and watching ItB on TNT before any reruns. Since B5 is all about the journey and not the destination, it worked out well for me."
babylon5,tijbz,pipe1234,1 point,Wed May 16 05:10:16 2012 UTC,"If I had to convince someone who had never seen it before to watch it, I'd choose In the Beginning to show them. However, if you care at all about the story, which is the best thing about the show IMO, I would think you wouldn't want to spoil one of the bigger mysteries that early.  I really wish the effects on the show were as good as ItB, I think it would help pull in new fans. I've known a few people I've tried to get into B5 that just couldn't get past the shitty DVD computer effects. And sadly, JMS said a Blu-ray remaster is impossible. And all my dreams, torn asunder..."
babylon5,tijbz,Stupid_Ned_Stark,2,Fri May 18 00:16:37 2012 UTC,"I have to agree, the Beginning is great. Thirdspace always has a weird place in my heart because of it's strong lovecraftian overtones."

babylon5,tijbz,xcake,2,Sat May 12 17:15:32 2012 UTC,"As a new viewer (a few episodes into Season 2 so far), I would recommend The Gathering (which I watched first). It provided a good intro duction to everyone on the station for me, and while a few bits didn't continue with the series (Delenn's pain rings), some parts are definitely worth the watch (the doctor seeing Kosh, Sinclair's first mention of his 24-hour gap) and overall it was a good way to start off.   I can't speak for the rest of the movies though, so I'm curious about the consensus on them as to if and when they should be watched."
babylon5,tijbz,Hairy_Seldon,2,Fri May 11 22:14:45 2012 UTC,"I have said this before.  I would not recommend the pilot as a start for people.  I know people who watched the pilot and gave up.  The first episode of Season 1 is a great episode.  The movies are not good.  The one exception is ""In the Beginning"".  ""A call to Arms"" is for those people moving on to crusade."

babylon5,tdpq2,exatreide,9,Tue May 8 23:00:52 2012 UTC,Have you seen the Lost Tales? But otherwise no.  There has been no new content and it seems highly unlikely there will be.  There was a bit of excitement last year (I think it was last year) as Walter Koenig suggested he had been talking with JMS about some new content but JMS squashed that pretty quickly.  WB has treated the franchise and JMS extremely poorly and with the loss of many of the actors playing important characters it is difficult to see how there could be more anyway.  Time to start the re-watch if you want more.
babylon5,tdpq2,ozmars,3,Tue May 8 23:32:32 2012 UTC,I thought lost tales was just awful :(
babylon5,tdpq2,Ameridrone,2,Wed May 9 05:11:04 2012 UTC,"Yeah, it certainly wasn't up to the standard of even Crusade unfortunately.  But it is the most recent content."

Shame really
babylon5,tdpq2,HellinPelican,10,Wed May 9 00:04:32 2012 UTC,"One of the big problems is that JMS was supposed to receive residuals when B5 would turn a profit and instead of paying him, they billed a bunch of expenses on the B5 franchise which had nothing to do with the series.  Those residuals would have helped JMS because he would have needed to chase less other contracts and would have been able to focus on the B5 universe.  It would have also showed it to be a profitable franchise and not a loss.  The death of 3 actors (G'kar, Franklin and Zack) hurts, but in general many of the actors are slowly growing older, with the series becoming sadly less and less recent.  It would need a reboot, but you don't reboot a series which lost so much money.  For the record, episodes were produced at 900,000$ a pop on average, so the series cost roughly 100 millions to produce, but whatever the movies costs. Let's say 150 millions.  It generated roughly 1 billion in revenues. But it lost money.  Go figure..."

babylon5,t5uun,mrwoolery,8,Thu May 3 22:38:07 2012 UTC,I have often said that there should be a new Babylon 5 set during the Dilgar war.  Please make 4 seasons of this and I will buy the Blu-Rays.  The time period is great because: The Minbari would be out of the show (at least from a human perspective) It should be an interesting time for Narn and Centari The Vorlons are around. The Shadows are around. Earth is just beginning to wet its feet in the galaxy. Deathwalker was pretty cool.  The actress who player her originally could reprise her role.  She would be older in the past. There would be no space station.
babylon5,t5uun,Hairy_Seldon,3,Thu May 3 23:29:24 2012 UTC,"This is really amazing stuff. The central idea of desperately responding to impending doom through aggression and what that does to people, would make this a great standalone story even out of the B5 universe."
babylon5,t5uun,pipe1234,2,Tue May 29 02:57:39 2012 UTC,"It's a large novel, a long read...but when I read it I found it totally engrossing.  It has many characters which precede the cast of Babylon 5, but the writing is so good that I couldn't stop reading.  It really fleshes out the rise of Earth as a superpower, why the League of Non-Aligned Worlds are weak...and has lots of great space battles/tactics/etc in it.  Before reading this, I thought that the Dilgar were a minor power in the universe...but I found that....ah heck, just read it.  It's awesome if your a B5 fan!"
babylon5,t5uun,JaxRiens,2,Thu May 3 22:42:02 2012 UTC,Only issue i've had with this is it was quite obviously serialized when it first was released leading to alot of character reintroduction. Good if you are perhaps months between chapters bad if you are reading it in one sitting.

babylon5,rjl8e,mrwoolery,2,Thu Mar 29 19:15:36 2012 UTC,came here to post this. wish i'd never seen it before i watched the pilot!
babylon5,rjl8e,asterios,2,Fri Mar 30 06:42:59 2012 UTC,Yes. Do not watch In the Beginning. Do not watch it for a long time! Don't watch In the Beginning until its appropriate place much much later in the series.
babylon5,rjl8e,Ohmstar,6,Sat Mar 31 17:08:44 2012 UTC,"Watch the original pilot and TV movie ""The Gathering."" You can buy the double feature here, new (not from Amazon) for $5. It's the pilot you were meant to watch. Then you can get into the regular seasons. I know some people like to watch ""In the Beginning"" after season 4, but I prefer to wait until after season 5.   I'm sure there are other, less legal, ways to watch ""The Gathering"" online, and they are easy to find, but $5 isn't all that much for two movies. Good luck!"

babylon5,rjl8e,KoNP,3,Thu Mar 29 22:56:26 2012 UTC,"I've posted this once before, but it doesn't hurt reiterating.   Watch the B5 movie ""The Gathering"" The Babylon 5 pilot movie The Gathering was originally broadcast in 1993 a full year ahead of the regular show. Season 1 Season 2 Season 3 Watch Season 4 up to episode ""The illusion of truth"" Watch the B5 movie ""Thirdspace"" Season 4: continue with episodes 9-22 Watch Season 5 up to episode ""Objects at Rest"" Watch the B5 movie ""River of Souls"" Watch the B5 movie ""In the Beginning"" This is a prelude set 10 years before Babylon 5. Against the logic of the title, I would strongly recommend seeing it at this stage.  Should one see it before Season 1, much of the suspense in the main series would be ruined. Watch the B5 movie ""A Call to Arms"" This movie lays the groundwork for the spin-off TV series ""Crusade"".  Season 5: watch final episode ""Sleeping in light"" Watch Crusade Series   Have fun! :-)"
babylon5,rjl8e,Hairy_Seldon,1 point,Sun Apr 1 04:32:23 2012 UTC,"""Thirdspace"" and ""River of Souls"" are horrible, and do nothing for the overall mythos that's worthy enough of their failure. ""Call to Arms"" is the best of the movies after ""In The Beginning"", which is pure awesome. You don't have to wait until after season 4 to watch ""In The Beginning""; I watched it after season 3, and there were no spoilers to be had.   I don't like ""Thirdspace"" because there's absolutely no way it could have taken place in the timeframe that JMS says it chronologically occurred, as everyone in it was doing something else during that time on the series, and it's never even referenced by any characters before or after. It just felt so out of place."
babylon5,rjl8e,xm03,2,Mon May 7 18:52:27 2012 UTC,"Watch ""The Gathering"" first. There's a few differences, most notably Delenn - she was apparently supposed to be an effeminate male (played by Mira Furlan - the ""french"" woman from LOST) so they deepened her voice a bit, and gave her a stronger chin and cheekbones. Didn't work very well so they shitcanned it.  But it's a good start to the series. The special effects were hokey as shit but they had their own kind of charm, the series in general is quite slow, very ""future politics in space"", but it's not done poorly.  Also, prepare to have most of your assumptions about characters and groups of characters proven to be quite incorrect."
babylon5,rjl8e,Stupid_Ned_Stark,1 point,Wed Apr 4 09:31:00 2012 UTC,"I would avoid the pilot ""The Gathering"" Just go out and buy Season 1.  Enjoy. (Skip the movies) (Skip Season 5, except for the last episode which was filmed in Season 4)"

babylon5,pmkcd,floydian239,4,Fri Feb 24 21:26:30 2012 UTC,Day of the Dead is probably the best episode from the 5th season. Up there in best episodes of the whole show.
babylon5,pmkcd,UglyWesternBaby,2,Mon Feb 13 00:08:00 2012 UTC,Wasn't that the only one not written by Straczynski in that season? Perhaps he was a bit burnt out by then.  Not to mention trying to come up with things once his main story arc was finished.

The way those White Stars could turn would have everyone inside them becoming modern art pieces on the walls inside.  Also, the distances involved in a space battle would be nothing like as cramped as they are shown in B5.  And I reckon that races intelligent enough to get that much hardware into space would have computers doing all the fighting. Fewer misses and casualties. Still far too 20th century to be convincing."

babylon5,p7oiz,co_fragment,3,Thu Feb 2 14:11:10 2012 UTC,"I think the idea of an episode to 'hook' someone has to be one that doesn't necessarily drop a bunch of spoilers. For example, both Doctor Who episodes are great stand-alone episodes, but don't really spoil any slow-boiling story arcs. They are both awesome, self-contained stories.  Being honest, stand-alone episodes are not B5's strongest point. As much as I'd love to say Coming of Shadows, Signs and Portents, The Long, Twilight Struggle, Severed Dreams, etc. they work SO much better once you've gotten to know the characters and what is on the line in the universe.  So while trying to pick a great 'hook' story that doesn't drop some major arc-spoilage is very difficult. I'd second your mention of ""Confessions and Lamentations,"" it's just such a strong, compelling story.  Passing Through Gethsemane is also a strong story, and I don't think there's much arc stuff going on. It's a quieter, more character-driven episode - C&L has a lot more of the 'scale' we come to know in Babylon 5 so I think it's maybe the better choice."
babylon5,p7oiz,eventualperv,1 point,Mon Feb 6 04:55:27 2012 UTC,"+1 on the notion that an arc episode will have a lot more meaning for those who watch thing in order and pay attention. While I do agree that S1 is difficult to hook people on (case in point: My ""The Rewatch"" series of posts), I believe in the long run it will result in the great episodes having more impact. It would be a fun project to put someone completely unaware of the show in front of ""Sleeping in Light"", but I doubt that they would feel the same sense of sorrow without knowing everything leading up to those final moments.  Then again, I could be wrong. I usually am."
babylon5,p7oiz,Floppyboobsack,3,Mon Feb 6 06:49:12 2012 UTC,"I agree with the others on the arc thing. I am a total newb to B5 and just watched the entire thing including movies in the last week.   I just wanted a new sci fi and gave it a go. No idea what it was about even, just remembered hearing about it.  When I watched the first episode I literally thought the show was way too cheesy and I could not understand why anyone would rate it high (as it was rated on IMDB).  However I read a few posts about how good it gets and boy I just LOVED this series! Honestly now I am trying to get my BF to get past S1 and it is just a matter of saying it gets a hell of a lot better. I don't see how you could watch just one episode since it is such an arc, I think it is better to just keep adamant about how good it gets."
babylon5,p7oiz,spyrakett,3,Mon Feb 6 23:42:38 2012 UTC,"I know the OP asks for single episodes, but here's a guide I use for introducing someone to Babylon 5 in an orderly fashion:   Watch the B5 movie ""The Gathering"" The Babylon 5 pilot movie The Gathering was originally broadcast in 1993 a full year ahead of the regular show. Season 1 Season 2 Season 3 Watch Season 4 up to episode ""The illusion of truth"" Watch the B5 movie ""Thirdspace"" Season 4: continue with episodes 9-22 Watch Season 5 up to episode ""Objects at Rest"" Watch the B5 movie ""River of Souls"" Watch the B5 movie ""In the Beginning"" This is a prelude set 10 years before Babylon 5. Against the logic of the title, I would strongly recommend seeing it at this stage.  Should one see it before Season 1, much of the suspense in the main series would be ruined. Watch the B5 movie ""A Call to Arms"" This movie lays the groundwork for the spin-off TV series ""Crusade"". Season 5: watch final episode ""Sleeping in light"" Watch Crusade Series"
babylon5,p7oiz,FellKnight,2,Wed Mar 14 21:31:06 2012 UTC,"First episode I ever saw was ""Severed Dreams"", and the amount of awesome crammed into 45 minutes had hooked me forever, but I can't recommend it as it comes too late in the arc.  I'd have to go with Signs & Portents from your list.  I plan on introducing my new wife to the show this year, but I expect I'll start with The Gathering and Midnight on the Firing Line, though I may skip a few of the awful episodes after that so as not to let her lose interest."
babylon5,p7oiz,eventualperv,1 point,Sun Feb 5 21:51:52 2012 UTC,"I think you're on the right track. Of course Signs & Portents is great, but starting there means losing out on the whole Sinclair/Minbari mystery arc. There are several S1 episodes that can be safely skipped of course, but even some of the more sucky ones drop some ""arc hints"" here and there.. :|"
babylon5,p7oiz,Neroon,2,Mon Feb 6 06:51:16 2012 UTC,The key to every person I have turned on to this series is to explain that getting through season one is key. If you can do that then the rest is easy and gets so amazing.

babylon5,p7oiz,JMSadmirer,1 point,Tue Feb 21 02:17:35 2012 UTC,"Personally I think it depends on just who you are trying to get to watch. If you want a fellow sci-fi watcher to give the show a try, then I would not hesitate using some heavyer ""story-episodes"", such as the ones you have already mentioned. I would also add ""Comes the inqusitor"" however. Simple awesomeness. However, if you are trying to get someone with limited or no sci-fi experience (so to speak) I would recommend an episode where the super-duper deep story is not the main focus. I got one of my friends to watch this show (not a big sci-fi person) and the first episode I showed was ""Deathwalker"". Mid season 1, characters still developing and it has not only an interesting dilemma, but also an unexpected ending. The last episode I am going to throw out there is GROPOS. I know it has very little to do with the overall story, but I think it showcases war and conflict in a way that people do not expect from sci-fi, especially if you are used to Star Trek (certain DS9 episodes not withstanding). My 2 cents :-)"

Really any of the Londo and G'kar heavy episodes, honestly--nothing against Sheridan, Garibaldi or Kosh, but those two characters were always the powerhouses of the series.

babylon5,oxb92,AmericanGoyBlog,5,Thu Jan 26 06:52:37 2012 UTC,In the Beginning was the only one really worth anything. The others were pretty much just long episodes. Thirdspace is an interesting story if you like Lovecraft. A Call to Arms was just a setup for Crusade.
babylon5,oxb92,CthulhuCompanionCube,3,Thu Jan 26 19:44:30 2012 UTC,"Movie - In The Beginning - Great, on par with the best of the show.  Movie - Thirdspace - Fun, with a ton of action, but not very deep. Worth seeing for the great Zach Allen/Lyta scene alone.  Movie - River Of Souls - Interesting guest stars, but a weak plot, cringeworthy humour and waaaaay too much Lochley. The Franklin cameo almost makes it worth watching though.  Movie/Pilot - A Call To Arms - Not bad, but the Drakh aren't the greatest enemies and Chen's music never fit well. It's pretty much the pilot for...  Show - Crusade - Had potential - see the first 5 episodes produced - Well, ""Visitors"" was a bit stupid, but the others are good. However it was monkeyed around with very badly by the network who produced it and most of those episodes produced after, understandably aren't as good.  Movie/Pilot - Legend of the Rangers - It has G'kar in it, which is good, but the plot is a bit basic, as are the effects, the new characters, and the new enemies. The Ranger's ship looks kind of cool, but the weapon interface is terrible. Didn't get to be a series, honestly I was kind of glad, it just felt like B5-lite.  Movie/Anthology - The Lost Tales - Two stories, the B5 set one is weak, but watchable, the Sheridan one is far better and definitely worth seeing.  There's a few books worth seeking out too."

babylon5,o1als,livingoxymoron,8,Wed Jan 4 17:18:43 2012 UTC,"He seems pretty wooden to me.  There were parts of the first three episodes (as far as I am) where I knew he had just said something but completely zoned it out as if he wasn't there and it hadn't happened.  It was rather bizarre.  It was as if he was there, and not there at the same time.  His character is like a cardboard cutout talking through a voice synthesizer that drags out the last bit of sentence for emphasis, in real life, and everyone around the cutout seems to think its perfectly rational to have a conversation with it."
babylon5,o1als,frostek,29,Tue Jan 3 21:13:30 2012 UTC,"Yes, exactly. Because the character suffers from a kind of post-traumatic stress, from the Battle of the Line among other things, and he goes through life almost without affect, until he finds himself in adrenaline-fueled situations.

Another thing is that she felt equally used by humans, and expressed as much to Zach before the war with Earth, and to Garibaldi and G'Kar, right before she was kicked off the station.

Your gf might not have caught on to Kosh calling Sinclair Valen in the pilot. The show will pick up.

babylon5,nhdo4,doublarthackery,7,Sun Dec 18 23:17:26 2011 UTC,"SPOILERS: In the Beginning is just the story of the Earth-Minbari War, as told from the perspective of Emperor Mollari. It doesn't go into season 5 territory, and there is a lot of old footage of Delenn/Dukhat/Sinclair stuff, but it kind of fills in some holes. Definitely worth watching, in my opinion. I love old Londo with a Keeper, though. Watch out for Robin Downes (Byron) as a Minbari.  I have seen the other movies (except for Legend of the Rangers). I don't really remember them so much (In the Beginning came with The Gathering DVD that I have). I hated Crusade.  I made it through season 5, and don't think it's as bad as S1. The two worst episodes (""Infection"" and the one where Garibaldi's friend boxes) are way worse than anything in Season 5. I also hope that you watched the final episode ""Sleeping in Light."" It's great, and originally belonged at the end of S4, before the show was picked for a 5th season. Season 5 definitely gets better as it goes along. Great G'Kar and Lyta stuff. ""Day of the Dead"" is a great stand alone, also."

Worlds where the audience now joins the story being told by the npcs and the actors behind them.  There's a poignant moment, when you first enter Winterfeld keep and you hear Ulfric and his lieutenant coldly discussing their plans for the war.  The harsh and racist viewpoint then justified with so much pain ... then as the player, you have to decide to follow them or not ...   That decision, the gnawing uncertainty of ""is this the right thing to do"" ... I love it.  And then you can play it again and make different decisions. Each time with the NPC actors wooing you in their direction with their motivations.  The Sandbox nature of the world is what gives you the freedom to explore each part at your leisure. Visiting each little village with stories of love and loss, all combining to frame a world in chaos and on the brink of massive war.  I can't get enough.   The game isn't perfect: I wish they had done more with the companions. But it's truly great.  I find myself wishing for a Babylon 5 universe implemented the same way."

An architect, he explained, is a writer who crafts in excruciating detail the skeleton of his narrative and the identities of his character. An architect outlines and revises before even putting prose on page. Contrarily, a gardener is a writer who begins with a seed, an idea planted from their swirling subconscious on to the page, and then tends that idea as it courses on to completion.

babylon5,ldgkg,co_fragment,3,Sun Oct 16 02:14:52 2011 UTC,Although there currently is no end written yet. There's still two (supposedly) novels to go.
babylon5,ldgkg,razzmatazz1313,2,Sun Oct 16 22:53:30 2011 UTC,IS that counting the winds of winter. because it thought he said wanted to finish it with the 6th but he felt it would of been to much of a rush so he decided to make it 2. But i could be wrong. I mean id be happy im on the 4th book now.
babylon5,ldgkg,co_fragment,1 point,Sun Oct 16 23:07:35 2011 UTC,"I said supposedly two as I believed it was meant to be one more book and has now expanded into two. The other thing is that many writers say they are finished with a series or specific 'universe' they write in, then turn around and do more at a later date.  I just hope he's left copious amounts of notes on how it all ends in case he gets hit by a bus. Something that I couldn't help but think while watching Babylon 5 during its broadcast run."
babylon5,ldgkg,razzmatazz1313,1 point,Mon Oct 17 15:04:44 2011 UTC,"Yeah since he isn't the quickest with turn around on the books, But that is because he wants to do it right. But he did say in an interview, that the end of the series is coming together a lot quicker then he thought.   He had already written about 100 of the next book before he finished the 5th book. and that was about a year ago now. Also I think the HBO series is having him pick up the pace a little.  he has 4 years to finish the next book if the series continues, at its current pace. no way he will have the last book done in 5, but you never know."
babylon5,ldgkg,GreatZapper,8,Mon Oct 17 15:36:42 2011 UTC,"A bit off-piste, this, but I'd almost go for the first three series of The Wire, in that in those seasons there is an over-arching story arc which reaches a peak at the end of season three.  That said, season four is essential as well even though it doesn't fit in with the rise of the Barksdale crew.  (I'm not saying any more due to spoilers...)"
babylon5,ldgkg,razzmatazz1313,8,Sat Oct 15 22:56:13 2011 UTC,"What do you mean ""boring, sci-fi series about political issues???""  Seriously, watch Avatar, the last airbender (the series, not the movie, The movie is awful).  It's for kids, but it's amazing.  Fringe is only in the 4th season, but it's supposed to be planned like B5."
babylon5,ldgkg,tidux,2,Sun Oct 16 19:31:51 2011 UTC,"Seriously, you know what I mean. 99% of an episode of B5 is people sitting at a table, talking about political problems. It's horrendously boring, and I had to force myself to watch the last season (because you want to know what happens, you know), yet the fact that everything is tied together and makes sense in the end is just amazing, it makes the whole series so awesome."
babylon5,ldgkg,jankyalias,4,Sun Oct 16 22:05:25 2011 UTC,"Yeah the last season was boring, but season 2-4 best scifi ever, in My opinion. but you can't forget season one and 5. I think I didn't like season 5 because, well I wasn't a big fan of the psych core. Also, almost all series are planned to some extent. But some times the needs for ratting makes the writers/ producers have to do something quicker then planned.   Side note, Sons of Anarchy is a planed 7 seasons story arc, so they say."
babylon5,ldgkg,ratjea,1 point,Sun Oct 16 22:27:07 2011 UTC,SoA is a great show.  Jax Teller reminds me of Sheridan at times - he even grew a goatee and married the hot brunette.
babylon5,ldgkg,ratjea,5,Fri Oct 21 16:00:15 2011 UTC,"Buffy.  While the beginning and end of the whole series isn't set in stone (the story continues in comic form today, after all) each individual season is.  A very good series.  Just know that the first season suffers from lowish production qualities and is quite a bit more, cheesy maybe?, than the others."
babylon5,ldgkg,cardinality_zero,5,Sun Oct 16 13:38:48 2011 UTC,"Yes, pretty cheesy in the first season, but after you've seen the series it's really neat to go back to even the first episode and see the personal dynamics already playing out. The plots were thin, but the actors already had a good idea of their characters, in general."
babylon5,ldgkg,starmonkey,4,Sun Oct 16 14:26:26 2011 UTC,"The guy who got me into B5 also got me into some anime series. He says he likes anime because the best series are completely thought out beginning to end and don't run forever. I'm still undecided: it's cartoons, dammit! Still, though, I like most of what we've watched:  Evangelion - Not the best example. Supposedly it did have a planned ending, but the production ran out of money so the end is really confusing. Not bolding this one because it's iffy. :p  Death Note - Probably the best example. Tautly plotted, with verbal sparring too.  Ouran - Kind of silly, but has an irresistibly sweet attitude towards its mostly-caricature-ish characters. Its major planned plot points are in personal development of the teen characters, and it's just as engaging as the police hijinks in Death Note.  Ghost in the Shell - Not as affecting as the others for some reason, but still good.  For TV, I think Alias had great plotting. There is one major story for the series, but its focus shifts a bit season to season for reasons that are apparent when they happen. And it is one where a lot of first season stuff gets explained later; however, it's a spy/action series too so you aren't bored or confused like I was sometimes in season 1 of B5.  This is a really unexplored structure for TV series, I think, unless I'm missing some. The sad thing is, people eat it up. Why'd we all sit glued to the television every week -- these were series that made even people like me who hate watching first-run TV watch it -- for BSG or Lost? Because the series promised a series-long story arc, that's fucking why. And they cheated us, strung us along and disappointed us.    Oh. There are some story arcs throughout modern Outer Limits episodes. Yes, it was an anthology series, but certain characters and themes, and storylines (like the time travel one) popped up regularly. It would be fun to piece them together and watch the episodes as a mini-series.  Sorry not to be more help. I eagerly await moar/better suggestions too!"
babylon5,ldgkg,ratjea,4,Sun Oct 16 14:42:37 2011 UTC,"The only serious title here is Ghost in the Shell. The entirety of it - the three movies and the two seasons of the TV show - is very nicely thought out and deals with big issues, just like B5 did. It also has some of the ""boring politics"" that I liked in B5.  For someone new to the medium I'd also recommend Cowboy Bebop, Mushishi, Haibane Renmei and maybe Black Lagoon (the English dub), though it's not necessarily something that someone who liked B5 might enjoy.  Frankly Ouran and Death Note are not really on the same level as B5 story-wise and the former might be hard to appreciate for someone new to the medium."
babylon5,ldgkg,lucifers_attorney,2,Sun Oct 16 18:06:43 2011 UTC,"I'd like to also recommend Ghost in the Shell.  ""Stand Alone Complex"" (The TV series) is fantastic and well planned out."
babylon5,ldgkg,eremiticjude,2,Wed Oct 26 11:56:05 2011 UTC,"I think Death Note is definitely another good example. I'll look at the others as well, thanks !"
babylon5,ldgkg,trekkie1701c,2,Sun Oct 16 14:48:50 2011 UTC,"Warning: Ouran is majorly sweet candy, could be off-putting at first. Was to me, until I realized it was ironic/parody. Having not been exposed to anime before, though, I thought it was serious for a while."
babylon5,ldgkg,razzmatazz1313,5,Sun Oct 16 15:00:32 2011 UTC,"A lot of people don't like it, but DS9 fits the bill. The show definitely follows the Beard-Growth Model of Sci-Fi, but by season 2 to midway through 7, you've got a strong continuing story. Especially true is the entire Dominion War arc."
babylon5,ldgkg,razzmatazz1313,13,Fri Oct 21 12:10:07 2011 UTC,"Battlestar Galactica, the new one. Political, detailed, and until the very end the illusion of it all being planned out is very good. As long as you don't watch the finale, you'll never know Moore was pulling it out of his ass as he went. Just don't watch the finale. Get drunk or stoned or whatever your preference is and decide how it ends, but whatever you do don't watch the finale."
babylon5,ldgkg,mobyhead1,4,Sun Oct 16 00:42:17 2011 UTC,"Well, if we're willing to go with stuff that didn't really have a planned ending... DS9 is considered by some to have been a B5 ripoff.  That and it takes awhile to get to the meat of the series, and doesn't really make sense if you skip a lot of it.  And a lot of initial stuff is really, really stupid.  And they borrowed the name for Dukat, just they made him a completely different character.  I also liked SG-1 and felt like it had an awesome end to the Goa'uld arc (seriously, if they'd made that combo defeat of the Goa'uld/the Replicators the finale, would have been the most satisfying sci-fi ending I've ever seen), though you could toss some episodes out of order.  I doubt either had any sort of serious pre-written plan, but then again, neither did BSG really."
babylon5,ldgkg,ratjea,1 point,Sun Oct 16 05:36:51 2011 UTC,"Yeah Season 1-8 some of the best out there, but yeah you can throw out prob like 5 episodes a season. also they lost the dynamic due to Don S Davis getting ill."

babylon5,ldgkg,jankyalias,6,Sun Oct 16 02:51:19 2011 UTC,"I love BSG but I'd say that it's probably the number 2 show for ranking without a planned ending.   Number one being Lost, of course."
babylon5,ldgkg,wolfsktaag,3,Sun Oct 16 14:25:08 2011 UTC,"Well Farscape was supposed to be five seasons, it got 4 but the 4 hour peace keeper wars, it really ties it all up really well. Other then that, umm i got no idea, but I sure as hell would be interested in one also.  Did you mean also not SCifi only or any genre."
babylon5,ldgkg,razzmatazz1313,5,Sat Oct 15 21:45:31 2011 UTC,"Any genre, really. I like sci-fi but I'm mostly looking for the ""end already planned"" kind of thing."

babylon5,ldgkg,grozzle,1 point,Sat Oct 15 23:59:01 2011 UTC,"Indeed.  And even one of the episodes that is basically filler, ""The Ember Island Players"", is still worth it for the (IHMO rather funny) self-parody of the rest of the series."

babylon5,ldgkg,BatGuano,0,Sat Oct 15 22:08:08 2011 UTC,The thing with Farscape that made it go off the story line mostly was that zann( the blue chick) got health problems(so the say) with the makeup so she had to be written off.

babylon5,ldgkg,AmericanGoyBlog,3,Sun Oct 16 01:18:48 2011 UTC,"Are you okay with books instead of shows? There was a whole ""gardner vs. architect"" discussion somewhere... where architects do something more like the B5 model. Brandon Sanderson and Steven Erikson (after the discrepancies from the first book in his Malazan series) are both good architect style writers for the series they put together.  If you like shows, you are going to have to just watch the first season of most of the shows. Heroes, season 1 was planned but after that they started winging it. I think the same might be true for Prison Break. There are probably a lot of them if you look. Treat these shows like miniseries and ignore the later seasons if you can.  The Wire, as mentioned by GreatZapper, is an exception where you can go multiple seasons and it feels like the story was thought through clearly."
babylon5,ldgkg,Bridger15,3,Sun Oct 16 02:42:47 2011 UTC,"I realise this comment is super late, but what the hell.  Blakes 7 - I don't think the show was planned with a 'true' overall arc, however the continuity is kept throughout the show. So things that happened in series 1 get referred to in series 4, characters leave or die. It's a little more like Farscape than B5 in that respect, but still better than most SF shows.  The writing of the characters is awesome, the acting is generally good, but the show was made on a shoestring. In the late 70s. It makes B5 look like it got a blockbuster budget, but it's part of the charm, like pre-2005 Doctor Who. Just be ready for wobbly sets, atrocious costumes and fairly basic model work.  I'm almost 100% sure JMS stated that Blakes 7 was a big influence on his writing of Babylon 5."

Once you make it out of season one you're good (there were some good episodes in season one, and there were some bad episodes in the other seasons, but in general it works). I think it really helped once the show started really serializing the storylines. She really liked DS9 for the same reasons I think.

Of course, everything changes with the internet, so now we can see anything we like, but the reason for me taking a chance with B5 is that I sincerely believe that she will eventually enjoy watching it. I don't really know other sci-fi shows I can say that about.  She falls asleep to Futurama, mostly, even gave me a hard time for tearing up at the end of Jurassic Bark (see what kind of woman I'm struggling with here?).

I am a real wuss when it comes to emotion in movies and TV. Not that I hate it. Anything that can make me feel anything is usually doing it because of quality, and Babylon 5 scores high in this department. For some reason someone is always cutting onions whenever I watch (not limited to)   Jurassic Bark Sleeping in Light (all of it, pretty much) The ""classics"" in B5, like Z'ha'dum, Between the Darkness and the Light, etc. Toy Story 2 and 3 (they're just TOYS, damnit!)

babylon5,kv32k,flex_mentallo,2,Mon Oct 3 08:02:41 2011 UTC,"Hmmm, she likes Sex In The City, Gilmore Girls, and The Big Bang Theory.  Have you considered that when it comes to t.v. she may just be looking for passive entertainment rather than something as compelling as B5?"
babylon5,kv32k,doublarthackery,2,Thu Sep 29 17:51:36 2011 UTC,"I see your point and understand why you're asking. However, she got totally hooked on The Sopranos.

My first time I lost interest somewhere in the first half of season 1, then came back and saw a few episodes of S2, which really hooked me.

babylon5,k4cmh,maruse,4,Sun Sep 4 22:02:56 2011 UTC,"In the Beginning... - It was first aired just before the beginning of season 5.  This episode is actually quite full of spoilers if you watch it before that point.  It is framed using a flashback; someone is ""remembering"" the events the evening before a major event in their character arc.  So if you haven't seen the episode where the event takes place, the frame story loses all of its poignancy.  I would go into more detail, but I don't want to spoil some of the most awesome plot points of the show.  Thirdspace - Seriously, avoid this like the plague.  It is horrible, and has little to no relevance to the rest of the series.  I think it takes place sometime in the middle of Season 3 but was aired during Season 4.  If you have exhausted the rest of your B5 experience maybe consider coming back and watching Thirdspace.  River of Souls - A fun little B5 yarn.  Aired near the end of Season 5.  There is very little continuity spillover between this and other installments.  Watch it at the end of Season 5 if only to not get confused with the unfamiliar characters.  The Legend of the Rangers - An aborted pilot.  I can't claim to have seen it, but I have only heard terrible, terrible things.  A Call to Arms - The semi-pilot for Crusade.  There is no overlap between this and B5; it is just a sequel.  Voices in the Dark - Two stand alone episodes that ostensibly take place after the conclusion of Crusade."
babylon5,k4cmh,maruse,1 point,Sun Sep 4 21:42:30 2011 UTC,"Awesome, thanks! I'll try to watch Thirdspace and In the Beginning when I'm done with season three. Not got Voices in the Dark, maybe I'll have to look out for that if I still want more after Crusade... but I just skipped through the first episode of to try to get a feel for it, and it doesn't look promising. Annoying, even! D: Are there any die-hard Crusade fans that wish it could have run longer?  EDIT: The Lurker's Guide says Thirdspace happens during S4, looks like I'll watch it then! That should break up the series' a bit __^"
babylon5,k4cmh,co_fragment,1 point,Sun Sep 4 21:59:03 2011 UTC,"I think that Crusade is very much a mixed bag.  However much Babylon 5 was a genre-defining show, Crusade just seemed like another tired spaceship-on-a-mission yarn.  It was able to glean some really good and fun plot elements from B5, but it itself brings very little to the table.  As much as I like Gideon and Galen, Dureena Nafeel is just totally grating.  I have difficulty even remembering the other characters.  The special effects may be leagues better, but the music is unbearably grating.  Finally, the Excalibur is just fan-wanking ""most badass starship in the universe"" porn.  Complete with mega-super-lazor."

babylon5,k4cmh,Bridger15,3,Sun Sep 4 22:17:00 2011 UTC,"Hopefully this will help to start - link - see the box on the right? It shows the series chronology.  ""In The Beginning"" works best either just before ""Sleeping In Light"" (the final B5 episode) - as this is when Londo is actually telling the tale or watch it anytime after ""War Without End part 2"" which is in season 3, as it ties in with that episode in many ways.  As for the other movies:  Thirdspace - It fits in any time after episode 8 of season 4. I enjoyed it a lot. Basically a big space battle romp with Lovecraftian overtones. Has little effect on the story arcs, but has Jeff Conaway's best scene in the whole series.  River of Souls - Takes place after ""Objects at Rest"" in season 5 and before A Call To Arms/Crusade. The worst of the bunch IMO. Lame humour, weak story, wasted guest stars and Lochley. There is however a great unexpected cameo from one of the main cast that makes it just about worthwhile.  The Legend of the Rangers - Takes place after River Of Souls and before A Call To Arms - Exceedingly bad pilot attempt, even G'kar turning up can't save this. I'm a huge B5 fan and I would still say not to bother.  A Call to Arms - Watch just before Crusade. Suffers from Evan Chen's odd soundtrack, but sets the scene for Crusade.  Crusade - Watch after A Call To Arms. The only problem here is there's even debate over which order to watch the series itself in! Long story short - Five episodes were made before the network started interfering, these are mostly good, the other eight vary wildly. Watch the original broadcast order for them to make sense continuity-wise though, the better episodes are the last five.  Voices in the Dark - Takes place after Crusade and before ""Sleeping In Light"" - Not bad, two back to back episodes basically. The budget is a bit low, but worth watching. The first one isn't great, but stick around for the second episode definitely.  Edit - expanded on reply"

babylon5,jotjn,masterpi,2,Sat Aug 20 20:40:37 2011 UTC,It's probably not possible due to the quality of the masters. They had to cut a lot of corners to get this show made. Perhaps one of them was their camera budget.
babylon5,jotjn,TinyCuts,2,Sat Aug 20 22:01:09 2011 UTC,"There was a big issue when they were prepping the DVD release, as touched upon by vjmurphy above. That issue in particular was regarding the widescreen conversion.  They had wisely filmed the entire series in widescreen (16x9? 16x10? dunno), but cut it down to 4x3 for television. When they rendered the special effects, they did those in 4x3, since that is all it would air at. In theory, you could re-render them later at a better resolution or different aspect ratio. Unfortunately, the original animation data has been lost, so re-rendering is not possible. Which means they have widescreen shots of actors, and 4x3 NTSC special effects.  On the DVD release it wasn't too big of a deal aside from shots that had both effects and people as you now had a frame of reference to see how crappy it looks. The film used for the actors may be able to be scanned at 1080p for use on a blueray, but that would only make the sfx scenes stand out even more."
babylon5,jotjn,sequentious,2,Sun Aug 21 00:32:02 2011 UTC,"I was kind of hoping maybe Warner's might be willing to throw some cash at it to get the effects re-done from scratch sort of like how CBS Paramount did for the original Star Trek a few years ago. After the 'talks' we heard of between JMS and Warner's didn't resulted in any new B5 announced, I hoped this might have been a consolation prize - especially with the 20th anniversary rolling around...  I'm sure that it would cost millions to re-do the entire series, but I'd think the Blu-Ray sales would merit the initial outlay AND give B5 a new lease of life back on tv now they could promote it as ""Hi-Def."""

babylon5,j2ebf,Numlocks,6,Thu Jul 28 23:34:53 2011 UTC,I'm interested in a story about the rise of Psi Corps and the rise of Bester. There were a series of books that dealt with those issues starting from the emergence of telepaths a century earlier and the rise of Psi Corps all the way to Besters final confrontation with Garibaldi.    A new series wouldn't have to go into the last part but a show about the discovery of human telepaths and the formation of Psi Corps would be bad ass.

babylon5,j2ebf,Don_Quijoder,2,Fri Jul 29 08:01:19 2011 UTC,This is an amazing idea and a show I think pretty much all of us here would watch. I just don't think that there enough B5 fans to actually make this happen.
babylon5,j2ebf,Circuitfire,4,Fri Jul 29 02:26:14 2011 UTC,"Sadly, I agree. Unless they figured out a really good way to kick it off with new viewers without having seen Babylon 5 the max potential audience is former Babylon 5 viewers. Very hard to do."

I doubt you could hook people into watching a continuation of this if they aren't familiar with the B5 universe."
babylon5,j2ebf,Circuitfire,4,Fri Jul 29 03:24:15 2011 UTC,"I'm thinking something like the mini-series that kicked off Battlestar Galactica. Self contained story that leads to something bigger. It would almost have to be marketed with no ties to B5 so that non-viewers would give it a try without thinking they had to see B5. Basically a steath prequel, sneak it in on the unsuspecting. Of course the B5 fans would know it's a prequel just from online hype and watch, but catching and hooking the non-B5 fans would be the key. Damned near impossible.  I loved the politicking too, that was the heart of the show and one of the reasons Lando and G'Kar were so fantastic. But a series about the last Shadow War would pretty much by definition be more action oriented, although the arrival of B4 could necessitate alliance building."

But a series about the last Shadow War would pretty much by definition be more action oriented, although the arrival of B4 could necessitate alliance building.   And this is where I think you have a fantastic idea.  It gets you action, it gets you the political maneuvering and it gets people interested in the back story.  Add to that, you keep something close to the original introduction, and you can make a great series that chronicles the tales of every Babylon station from B1 to B5.

Prequels could be good if there is a decent story to go with it, which is why I think the last shadow war would be awesome.

babylon5,j2ebf,Circuitfire,1 point,Sat Jul 30 04:44:25 2011 UTC,"Well in the B5 universe at least, we know what the future holds because the Shadow/Vorlon conflict ended forever. Doing a 'picking up the pieces' series like Crusade or Legend of the Rangers didn't seem to work, a direct sequel to B5 is out because actors have aged/died, and most of the major plot points were wrapped up. So the far past seems to be the best place to have a really epic, far reaching story line. We know a little about Valen, know that's when the Narn telepaths were exterminated, but not really a whole lot else from that era. So it's really a clean slate for the most part with a decent setup."

babylon5,j2ebf,PsychopompShade,4,Fri Jul 29 13:15:59 2011 UTC,I read somewhere that he wanted 2-3M per episode. B5 in its prime cost 900k in the mid 90s. I thought costs would have inflated more over the last 15 years.
babylon5,j2ebf,PsychopompShade,6,Thu Jul 28 18:43:49 2011 UTC,"Out of interest I just looked up some other shows (although this is internet info, so take with a pinch of salt):  The general numbers for episodes of Lost, SGU and BSG were around $2M per episode.  Mad Men is around $2.5M.  Deadwood was about $5M and surprisingly so were some episodes of Heroes...  So I think $2-3M an episode should give a show equal in look of sets and effects to BSG - that would do me fine.  Edit - format and final comment"
babylon5,j2ebf,quarksbar,2,Thu Jul 28 19:00:09 2011 UTC,"CGI will be much cheaper.  But they have ""for free"" the most important thing: a story and characters that have proven to be able to hold for 5 seasons."

babylon5,j2ebf,_nofuture,2,Fri Jul 29 17:21:48 2011 UTC,"Even if this happens, I feel that the original characters were made iconic by the actors who portrayed them.  I don't think you could cast new actors without your original core audience having a fit.  I can't imagine any of the main characters portrayed other new actors.  Not in a good way.  Who could portray G'kar better then Andreas?  Or Sheridan better then Bruce? Londo? Garibali?  Forget about it.  Curiosity and the thought of something new for B5 makes me feel excited.  But I think it might be a dud from the start.  I wish JMS would just write some more B5 comics or perhaps some new books.  Heck even more of the straight to DVD stuff they've done might work better if done right."

So we could have the whole David Sheridan story line that we see some of in War Without End and that was covered (not that well in my opinion) in the final 'Legions Of Fire' novel.

babylon5,j2ebf,mrwoolery,1 point,Fri Jul 29 14:59:09 2011 UTC,"I too have a hard time seeing other actors take on those roles.  But. Let's be honest. Not all B5 actors were that great. Watching it again now there are some cringe worthy moments... The acting was good compared to what else was on tv in the nineties, but not all of it holds up.  Also I think we have to separate the actors actually doing a good job from them just having become our picture of that character. It would be painful to see someone else as G'Kar. And it would be strange to see someone else as Ivanova, but I wouldn't mind seeing someone with a bit more range in that role.   At the end of the day I know I would see everything B5 related JMS puts out no matter what."

babylon5,iyk2m,moriquendo,3,Mon Jul 25 03:23:22 2011 UTC,A $3M budget would go a long way to doing some outdoor sets and shoots. I'm sure O'Hare is looking for a gig. Perhaps Valen would turn up an alien plot and his ranger buddies and Zathras would take care of business.
babylon5,iyk2m,UberMonkey21,3,Mon Jul 25 03:57:43 2011 UTC,King Arthur legends were about 700s. About as far aware from 1300 as 1300 is from us.
babylon5,iyk2m,Circuitfire,1 point,Mon Jul 25 12:50:02 2011 UTC,"Uh, Arthur is 5th/6th century. The 1300s are Black Death time. And about a century prior, the Cathari heresy was wiped out by the Catholic Church. Cathari believed ""that the physical world was evil and created by Rex Mundi (translated from Latin as ""king of the world""), who encompassed all that was corporeal, chaotic and powerful; the second god, the one whom they worshipped, was entirely disincarnate: a being or principle of pure spirit and completely unsullied by the taint of matter. He was the god of love, order and peace."" (source: Wikipedia). Order versus chaos. Sound familiar?"

babylon5,iyk2m,mpierre,5,Mon Jul 25 04:27:51 2011 UTC,"A reboot wouldn't be the same without the unique actors that made the original one of the best sci-fi shows of all time.  This is very good news, regardless."

Perhaps a faraway future where the races we know are now the old ones, and there are new races emerging, and the old ones (humans, minbari, narn, centauri, etc) have to counsel and help them along."
babylon5,iyk2m,mpierre,3,Mon Jul 25 03:26:32 2011 UTC,"That could be cool...  But not with ALL of the new races being new ones.  Imagine that the alliance JUST discovered how to be beings of ""energy"" like the Vorlons.  The show would be about convincing the rest of humanity, of the narns, of the Centauri, etc... to join in and become ""first ones"".  Most people don't want to, but the Alliance wants to leave room for the new races just evolving to grow.  The second season ends with the scene in the 4th season finale in which the ranger leaves the Earth: the sun explodes to ""hide"" the Earth.  The next 3 seasons are like you said, they help the new races."

babylon5,i0lta,mpierre,6,Thu Jun 16 03:23:01 2011 UTC,"You made quite a lot of errors in your message...  You used the plural for writer and creator.  JMS created the series by himself, and wrote 92 of the 110 episodes...  As for the 5th season, the show was planned for 5, but before the 4th season, UPN files for bankrupty meanining there wouldn't be a 5th one.  At the last minute, TNT bought the show after the bankruptcy, and produced the 5th season, when most of the arcs were already solved in the 4th season, hence less material for that last one, including seeing the ISA in action when it's creation was supposed to be the closing of B5."

babylon5,i0lta,Apophis27,3,Thu Jun 16 03:26:07 2011 UTC,"I was being sarcastic ;-)  Most TV shows are run by more than 1 person. Lost, had 3 show-runners, for example.  The result is that sometimes, you have different point of views of how the show should go on. Each of the show runners has his own idea of how the show should go.  Then, each episode is written either by a guest writer or a commitee of writers who sit in a room and pinch in ideas. Many sitcoms are written like that: 6 to 10 people sit in a room and throw in jokes after jokes until 21 minutes have been filled in on a pre-decided theme.  For sci-fi shows, you usually have a single writer who contributes a ""guest script"" after having watched the show or read the bible of the show.  These guest writers often do not make the show move forward, so it's perfect for shows like Star Trek with no continuity.  Babylon 5 is unique because JMS wrote all of the episodes of season 3, all of season 4, and all but one (Day of the Dead, by Neil Gaiman) of Season 5.  He also wrote most of those of Season 2.  But in Season 1, there were a lot of guest writers, to get the show started.  JMS did write the last episode ;-)"
babylon5,i0lta,cocoamix,6,Thu Jun 16 09:46:46 2011 UTC,"a lot of people gripe about the 5th season, but i think it was a welcome departure from the abrupt endings a lot of series have"

Collective identity means a great deal to them, and they come from a pretty rough planet to live on, so I kinda get how they'd be utilitarian and sort of logical seeming."

WHOCKCHIKAH!!!"".  Season 2 had a lot of nice subtle buildup and just political background, but 3 was amazing. Beautiful battles, characters torn between loyalties, but watching the darkness fall on earth is heartbreaking from afar.  This season made the series by far. And that isn't counting the B4 bit. One of my favorite scenes to this day remains Marcus's duel with Neroon.  Also, the war montage in ""In the Beginning"" is probably the most touching scene in any movie to me.  Oh, and season 5 had a few jokes too."

My main dislike was that they were first ones with the minbari at the same time even though the minbari were thousands of years ahead humans, and the humans were even hundreds of years behind centauri and narn. Although the centauri did fall pretty hard and it's likely narn would too. And now that I think about it jms is presenting a really positive hope that humanity will work itself out and evolve to a great place in the universe.

babylon5,hn96w,ClankersGonnaClank,5,Mon Jun 6 21:09:00 2011 UTC,"IIRC, the telepath thing was one of the storylines affected both by the upheaval of having the fifth season cancelled, then picked up, and by Claudia Christian leaving the show.

babylon5,hn96w,co_fragment,1 point,Mon May 30 16:46:10 2011 UTC,"That sounds familiar. JMS had to wrap up the storyline when he thought he wouldn't get a fifth season, and then after that they got one at TNT. So he then had to go back and expand some minor plot points to an entire season..."
babylon5,hn96w,kmissett,1 point,Mon May 30 16:53:02 2011 UTC,I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that Ivanova was originally supposed to get involved with Byron instead of Lyta.
babylon5,hn96w,eventualperv,1 point,Mon May 30 17:24:22 2011 UTC,"I think that's right. She was also eventually supposed to take over the station, so they needed to create the character of Lochsley to accomodate that once Claudia Christian left the show.  I actually didn't have that big a problem with the telepath story, though it ended up going a lot slower than it should have, for the reasons above. Now that I think of it, I take that back: it wasn't so much that it was slow as that JMS had to draw out the story as filler. A much better version of a not-too-dissimilar plot was the whole Baltar commune thing on BSG. That got a little slow and drawn out too, but it did at least provide for character change and growth..."
babylon5,hn96w,feuerkugel,2,Mon May 30 17:33:22 2011 UTC,"Babylon 5 is my all-time favorite TV show, and while I haven't seen it in a while, I never shared the hate for the Byron stuff in S5. Sure, they where whiny. Byron was a little too space-Jesus'y.   But hey, Lochley was captain of the station and hated by many. That doesn't mean that the writing was wrong - perhaps she was just a different type of character than what we had grown accustomed to? Yeah, less whiny telepaths would be nice. Perhaps a lifetime of being chased and stepped on would have toughened them up a bit. Then again, perhaps the training they had gone through led to them being that way. The villains don't always conform to how we think they should behave.  Yeah, I see them as villains because of the way their story ended.  Now, talk about the evidence that the alliance based their whole war against the centauri on (even if the attack was not what they had planned)... In my mind, that was just as weak.  But the one thing that was sad about S5 was the return of something we almost hadn't seen for two years - filler episodes. :(  I love S5 to death. I love them all to death. I'm probably a jms fanboi. :)"

babylon5,hn96w,ntr0p3,2,Mon May 30 16:53:49 2011 UTC,Right on. Seemed like the Narn and Minbari in particular would have accepted the feels into their territory no problem (admittedly the Narn have an ulterior motive.). No need to hide out on the station until run down by Psi Corps.
babylon5,hn96w,CSNX,2,Fri Jul 1 18:21:44 2011 UTC,"Eh, I don't think it ruined it per se... the choice of actors for Byron I thought was strange... he struck me as someone who did not get chosen for Interview with the Vampire and took the B5 job instead.  He was supposed to be on the run, with very few supplies, etc, and yet every episode he looks like he had a perm.  I think they should have developed his character more with being ""ex-psi-corp"" instead of making him some sort of Messiah.  Also the shared sex whatever the heck the thing was between Lyta and Byron where everyone else does their ""psi-voyeurism"" I thought was just off the charts weird to say the least..."

Use chalk or a pencil to draw the outlines of the logo onto the cloth. Use outline stitch (http://www.needlenthread.com/2006/06/basic-embroidery-stitches-line-stitches.html) to draw the outline (!) of the text and the number 5.  Use something like stem stitching to fill the letters (http://www.needlenthread.com/2010/08/filling-letters-with-stem-stitch.html).  Use any kind of fill stitch to fill in the number 5 (http://www.needlenthread.com/2010/09/embroidery-filling-large-spaces.html).  Voila! Perfect B5 embroidery, hand made by you :-)"

babylon5,halpt,dragonpaw,1 point,Fri May 13 21:21:18 2011 UTC,"It depends on the thread size you are going to use, but bigger is always better for good flowing curves :-)   Seriously, I'd guess 10 cm in height should be bood enough. Outline stiches work pretty well, as long as the curve isn't to sharp, and the number 5 has a pretty good curve. For the letters, they are very sharp along the corners, so outline stitch should be good there too.  Try out with just a single letter first, and see how it works out.

A colonel coming to the station and simply deciding to take over wouldn't be able to, because the ""commander"" of a ship or a station is supreme commander regardless of the rank.  Only superior positions such as General in charge of the sector would be able to relieve him of duty.  That's why the colonel had to use the semblance of a trial to relieve him.

Maybe JMS was feeing nostalgic for the days of yore, where ships of the line would fire barrages at each other broadside.  Perhaps the Johnson rays (which are a side effect of that particular model of cannon) necessitate a certain amount of Hobart shielding in order to protect the warp coil power bus from overloading."
babylon5,h5yok,psicopbester,4,Sat May 7 10:37:09 2011 UTC,"I can confirm what psicopbester said - according to the wikipedia entry Paul Bryant, the original designer, was trying to evoke a naval broadside with some of the hardware.  More importantly, remember that the Omega was supposed to be a force to be reckoned with even when fighting alone.  If you consider it, you would want lots of weapons with a variety of firing arcs, in case you wind up in something other then a capital ship slugging match.  According to the link above, the Omega can launch fighters, massive gigaton ordinance, missiles, and has good turret coverage.  The turrets were probably to keep medium ships from trying to come in from the sides and avoid the main guns.  Having a lot of smaller guns is also helpful if you're getting swarmed.  Just my opinions.  Interesting question, Tron-Gorf."
babylon5,h5yok,IrishCurse,2,Sat May 7 18:45:25 2011 UTC,"This seems very reasonable. I would like to add that in space, placement isn't as important as at sea. You can easier turn the ship to provide coverage to the gun you want."

babylon5,gjf6j,merreborn,2,Tue Apr 5 23:39:18 2011 UTC,"Yeah that guy's frame rate is terrible.  To be fair, Armada II was not very kind on most PC's when it came out.  B5A2 did not help the problem.  Also, I may have to check out Nexus, that's a pretty sweet looking mod, way more detailed than B5A2.  My mod was more about huge fleet battles, this looks way more like the smaller engagements actually shown in the tv series."

babylon5,gi3x2,DarthNobody,12,Mon Apr 4 05:24:36 2011 UTC,The Vorlons weren't interested in defeating the Shadows.  They were interested in keeping them in check and maintaining balance.  It wasn't until the Shadow War of the Second Age that the Vorlons decided to eradicate all cultures tainted by Shadow influence.
babylon5,gi3x2,feuerkugel,5,Mon Apr 4 05:38:14 2011 UTC,"The Vorlons weren't interested in defeating the Shadows.   You're right, it was an ideological disagreement.  You'd think, though, that the best way to settle that disagreement would be to eliminate the source of the problem.  Personally, it always seemed to me like the Vorlon / Shadow conflict paralleled the Cold War very closely, with the two superpower dividing the known universe via proxies and distributing their weapons everywhere.  If Moscow had the ability to wipe America off the map without fear of reprisal, wouldn't you think they'd do it?  Because I'm not sure how the Vorlons wouldn't be able to pull that off.   They were interested in keeping them in check and maintaining balance.    Actually, the Vorlons were always interested in order, as I understood it.  This stood in diametric opposition to the Shadows, who thought true strength came from the struggle of chaos."
babylon5,gi3x2,ntr0p3,9,Mon Apr 4 05:53:18 2011 UTC,"It wasn't a war. It was a disagreement. The goal wasn't to have the other side erased from existence, it was to shut them up and prove them wrong by showing the strength of unity and order. And that's what happened.  The Vorlons did defeat the shadows, in every way they cared about.  Oh also, they'd have to attack Lorien's planet, which I don't think they actually wanted to do."
babylon5,gi3x2,mpierre,2,Mon Apr 4 06:02:20 2011 UTC,"Not a shooting war, perhaps.  Disagreements about politics, though, often develop into war.  Cold/proxy war seems to be state of affairs between the two, simply with VERY long cooldowns between the shooting.    I wouldn't say the Vorlons won, necessarily.  The Vorlons believed in order through unity, not just of cause but of action, appearance, thinking, pretty much anything.  Things were still plenty frantic and unordered around the galaxy after the Vorlons, Shadows, and other First Ones departed beyond the rim with Lorien.  Order and chaos struggling against one another in a healthy balance was a compromise that the two major, older races never could agree upon.  As long as you don't look as either one as savior or villain, you could say they both won, while also both loosing.  You do have a very good point about attacking Zha'ha'duum, by the way.  Kudos, I hadn't even considered it."
babylon5,gi3x2,HellaSober,8,Mon Apr 4 07:00:21 2011 UTC,"Consider this,   There was a fight between the psi-corp and the rogue telepaths escaping the psi-corp.  In that fight, the psi-corp wanted to ""save"" the rogue telepaths and not kill them because rogue telepaths ARE still telepaths and they are so rare.  Mundanes on the other end, breed like bunnies and make one to another all the time and can be killed without reason.  The shadows and the vorlons behaved the same way, but with first ones.  First ones are precious, rare, unique. The new races might as well burn to the ground, who cares, new ones will replace them in a few hundred years.  But First ones are sacred.  So, on one side, there are the Vorlons, who want the new races to CONFORM. To OBEY. To grow up by following order.  On the other side, the Shadows are disgusted by that and instead want them strong and powerful so they may become first ones themselves. To do that, they encourage them to fight and to kill each other so that out of the chaos, every survivor is stronger.  Then, the Shadows relax a little and let the Vorlons educate them for the next fight.  What you need to understand is that the Shadows and the Vorlons behave like divorced parents.  When the Vorlons have custody, they shape us. They discipline us. The manipulate us.  When the Shadows have custody (on an alternating week-end), they take us to the park and get us to fight so that only the strongest kids survive and get stronger.  They never wanted to kill each other. They liked that arrangement.  The Vorlons were just afraid the Shadows would go to far and thus, only helped with the clean up at the end.  And the Shadows were just afraid the Vorlons would go to far and thus made sure to have enough firepower to counter-act them.  In the end, a balance arrived, until the dawn of the 3rd age (In the Babylon 5 world).  1000 years earlier, the Shadows pushed too much in response to a too powerful Shadow attack, and the table was set for the next time where things would explode."

Except that the First Ones aren’t like children, more like brothers and sisters, if I’m remembering the relative ages of all these races correctly.  As such, they shouldn’t be capable of being manipulated by the Vorlons and Shadows like the developing races have been.   They never wanted to kill each other. They liked that arrangement.   If you say so.  Having never been privy to the uniquely fucked up world of a divorced family, I can’t really say anything about it.  It’s a strange analogy, though, because parents typically want to protect their children at all costs, even at the expense of the life of the other parent.     1000 years earlier, the Shadows pushed too much in response to a too powerful Shadow attack, and the table was set for the next time where things would explode.

See, the whole thing about telepaths didn't really jive then, since the Vorlons and Shadows concerned themselves ONLY with the 'mundanes' and not their fellow older races while with the telepaths, it's kinda the other way around.  I get what you mean now, but...are you saying the other First Ones require protecting and, if so, why?   It is in relation to the ""last great war"" referred to in the second season, and when Babylon 4 finally arrived.   I got that part.  I guess I'm just wondering what specifically happened 1000 years ago when Valen showed up with B4 that was such too powerful of an attack on their part.  If memory serves correctly, the Shadows mistake 1000 years ago was that they acted too quickly and struck before they could really put a lot of force behind the attack.  This time, they were slower, careful, and more deliberate with their attempts.  The real catalyst for things exploding was the bond between Sheridan and Kosh I which led to the Vorlons directly attacking a small Shadow fleet."
babylon5,gi1lm,Vanetia,6,Mon Apr 4 03:21:19 2011 UTC,"I was the ultimate Star Trek fan.  Growing up I thought this show was a total rip off of DS9.  Little did I know that it was the other way around.  I warn you.  If you hold Star Trek as something sacred.  Especially Deep Space Nine.  You will not after watching this show.  Like you I picked up the first season cheap somewhere on a whim.  By the fourth episode I thought it was pretty decent.  By the second season I had taken the bait. Hook, line, and sinker.  By the third season I thought this show rivaled Trek.  And by the fourth season and fifth season finale I was a total convert.  Babylon 5 is quite possibly one of, if not the greatest sci-fi shows of our time.  Often times it's campy or goofy.  Sometimes the stories are a miss.  And sometimes the acting is bargain basement.  But the heart and over all sentiment of the show is where it truly shines.  I promise you if you give this show a chance and watch the entire arc you will not regret it.   Recently a lot of the science fiction/fantasy shows on TV have been stringing the viewer along, only to deliver a hastily thrown together, poorly thought out, very unsavory ending.  THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SHOWS.  It was written as a complete five year story arc with a beginning, middle, and end.    Never before or since have I come across another show like Babylon 5.  I'll end my nerd rant here and leave you to your discs.  I sincerely hope you find as much enjoyment out of the show as I have."
babylon5,gi1lm,quarksbar,3,Mon Apr 4 05:05:00 2011 UTC,"The first season is crappy, but if you power through it the payoffs will be worth it come season 2, 3, and 4. Just trust me, some of the worst things about the first seasons are not there in the next seasons.  You may also want to consider acquiring the pilot movie (The Gathering) in its re-edited version. It flows better and makes more sense. Or at least, while watching the pilot episode you have, know that the next episode is not that bad. I for one got bored the first time watching the pilot and didn't try to watch the show again for another year, and was very regretful that I waited so long!  After watching each episode, consider reading the Lurker's Guide for that ep. Or maybe wait until your second run through the series. It helps put some episodes in context."

babylon5,gi1lm,lizzyshoe,3,Mon Apr 4 04:42:10 2011 UTC,"Pay attention and try to learn your main characters during these episodes. They make incredible journeys through the series. Londo and G'Kar make the most amazing transformations from where they start in the beginning. Garibaldi's journey is heartbreaking and real. Delenn is one of the strongest female characters ever portrayed in TV or film. Sinclair too has a journey, but I can't summarize it without spoiling too much about the show. Once you start, in fact, you may want to avoid spoilers about the following seasons because there are great surprises in store for you.  I have watched this series too many times, and I have not even begun to delve into the rest of this wonderfully fleshed-out universe."
babylon5,gi1lm,OneAndOnlySnob,2,Mon Apr 4 05:40:15 2011 UTC,"To put it bluntly, the first season sucks. Seeds are planted there though, so you will want to watch at least some of the episodes.  My experience with Babylon 5  I renewed my commitment to watching it because of this subreddit. I had made an attempt at watching it before, but season 1 is so terrible that I did not continue to season 2. I wanted to eventually, but my interest in B5 was completely drained at that point. The first half of season 1 is pretty much unwatchable. The second half is quite a bit better.  I watched season 1 again because this subreddit started up, and even with the encouragement of the nice people in /r/babylon5, I had trouble making it through season 1 again. But once I made it to season 2, a whole new world opened up. Season 2 and 3 are seriously great and so epic. Seasons 4 and 5 are only very good IMHO. Having nearly completed Season 5, I'm already thinking about going back and watching it again, so it goes without saying that I'm glad I watched it.  If I were you, I would watch season 1 until I got annoyed with its terribleness. I would then refer to the sidebar and check The Moderator's list of Babylon 5 Episodes with their importance, and I would watch episodes with 4 or 5 stars, and proceed to season 2.  Good luck!"

babylon5,ggv3p,paleck,2,Sat Apr 2 03:20:41 2011 UTC,"yeah, I spoke to a friend about londo and he said the same... the problem is that I never got the impression that he was doing all that acting until the Drak got involved.  I mean, he seeked out the deal/relationship with the shadows. He wanted it but then he didn't.  I guess maybe it wasnt clear to me when he was acting for others, himself or when he was genuine. I know he was always genuine when he was a nice guy though. Evil londo perplexes me.  also, I didnt just ""like it""...  I really loved it. I just think it had lots of faults."

I watched every episode as if there was going to be a test lol I do freely admit that I may have blinked and missing something though. But I didn't get that feeling about Londo just from one episode or one season. I get that feeling after reflecting on the whole show.  The one scene that bothered me the most was when he pushed G'kar out of the league. He was very evil, mean and very non-lando. If it was an act, there was no reason to go that over the top. To me, that was Lando drunk on ""I just got my empire back"" and I understand why he wanted G'kar out.. but the way he did it seemed like terrible writing."
babylon5,ggv3p,CSNX,1 point,Sat Apr 2 04:00:02 2011 UTC,"It's been a while, but as I recall, he was doing that because he was backed into a corner. His own people had just started a war that he was having second thoughts about(including his part and the deal with the devil that led to it) and the friends that he had on B5 were all acting like he'd betrayed them(which he kinda did). He and G'Kar had almost come close to becoming friends, and his government had ordered him to have G'Kar thrown off  the council and sent back to Narn to be tortured and then executed.  What you saw was a man acting like he was between a rock and a hard place and doing the only thing he could think of to make sure he saw another sunrise and not being too happy about the whole deal."
babylon5,ggv3p,bbaydar,4,Sat Apr 2 04:05:49 2011 UTC,"This was a good review, but I honestly think you should watch the show again, because, as it's already been said, you've missed out on the nuance's of Londo's character.  The Londo/G'Kar character arc is the show.  I've even heard a rumor that this arc was the main story of the show, and everything else was subplot.  I like that idea.  What these characters go through with each other is done brilliantly through seasons 3 and 4.  Also, I do not agree with your assessment of Mira Furlan.  Minbari are not, at all, like humans.  I always thought she purposely played mostly confused all of the time, because she was caught between two physiology's, and in love with Star Killer, to boot.  Of course, all of this is my own personal opinion.  I'm just glad kraetos's post earned a new fan.  The show deserves it :)"
babylon5,ggv3p,earthforce_1,4,Sat Apr 2 04:46:46 2011 UTC,"Londa/G'Kar were indeed the heart of the show. There was a scene, in season 1, where they break into an argument while waiting for an elevator. A human walks up and enters the elevator and Londo/G'Kar miss it because of the fight. This was symbolic of the missed chances of their races and the humans stepping up and taking the future. JMS put a LOT into the scenes of those non arc stories."

A devoted fan! :-D"
babylon5,ggv3p,co_fragment,3,Sat Apr 2 07:39:46 2011 UTC,"A bit of research would have turned up that the show was slated to be cancelled at the end of Season 4 instead of the promised 5th season. So yes, everything was rushed to tie up loose ends.   Also. you need to watch the other movies for the conclusion of the Londo G'kar story.  Quoting from here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5  Ratings for Babylon 5 continued to rise during the show's third season, but going into the fourth season, the impending demise of network PTEN left a fifth year in doubt. Unable to get word one way or the other from parent company Warner Bros., and unwilling to short-change the story and the fans, Straczynski began preparing modifications to the fourth season in order to allow for both eventualities. Straczynski identified three primary plot-threads which would require resolution: the Shadow war, Earth's slide into a dictatorship, and a series of sub-threads which branched off from those. Estimating they would still take around 27 episodes to resolve without having the season feel rushed, the solution came when the TNT network commissioned two Babylon 5 television films. Several hours of material was thus able to be moved into the films, including a three-episode arc which would deal with the background to the Earth–Minbari War, and a sub-thread which would have set up the sequel series, Crusade. Further standalone episodes and plot-threads were dropped from season four, which could be inserted into Crusade, or the fifth season, were it to be given the greenlight.[18] The intended series finale, ""Sleeping in Light"", was filmed during season four as a precaution against cancellation. When word came that TNT had picked up Babylon 5, this was moved to the end of season five and replaced with a newly-filmed season four finale, ""The Deconstruction of Falling Stars"".[19]"

Soul hunters showed up in large numbers to get Ducat's soul. I suppose they have some ability to see events in the future or are drawn to death. JMS took some heat for the supernaturalish basis for the soul hunters. I believe that he stuck to the essence of life and mental energy not being supernatural or something like that.  I don't know about the books or other.
babylon5,gbuwr,DV8R,1 point,Sat Mar 26 09:18:40 2011 UTC,"I always looked at the fantasy elements of B5 as part of the human condition.  The way I see it, JMS tried to capture as much of what it means to be human within a space opera.  There are many fantastical parts of humanity that cannot be easily explained by science.  Sure, most if not all of them will be eventually explained, but it is the mystery that is part of being human.  JMS was genius in that respect, in my own opinion."

babylon5,gavso,CSNX,2,Fri Mar 25 00:36:42 2011 UTC,re-edited pilot   Where can we find that? I never heard about it and I am the moderator our here. Why does nobody ever tell me anything ?   Sinclair...the actor sounds like Captain Zap Brannigan   Oh. my. God. I will never be able to unsee this.
babylon5,gavso,CSNX,1 point,Fri Mar 25 17:10:55 2011 UTC,"It's called ""the Gathering"", and the only place I've been able to find it is Amazon, for like ten to twenty bucks in a two pack with ""In the Beginning"", which is also a great made for tv movie. It might be on Netflix instant watch.  I know it's on netflix to get as a disk."

babylon5,gavso,ntr0p3,1 point,Thu Apr 28 21:41:36 2011 UTC,I would say the first season is hard to get through. It's a lot of character development. The second season has more action but again it's more plot and character based. The thing to remember is that you're watching a 5 season story arch and this is how it gets started. The 3rd and 4th season are some of the best sci-fi ever made. Enjoy!!
babylon5,gavso,grozzle,1 point,Fri Mar 25 06:45:41 2011 UTC,"The first half of the first season is hard, after Signs and Portents, it ramps up rather nicely, imho. Also, Legacies is underrated imho."

babylon5,gadnn,Sdtodd,3,Thu Mar 24 12:53:16 2011 UTC,"Maybe you could explain what's with the listings for characters. You have Morden, Marcus, Lorien, Lyta, Zathras and others with ""0"" across the board. Doesn't make much sense to me how this whole section is numbered."
babylon5,gadnn,elrac1,3,Thu Mar 24 13:01:22 2011 UTC,Seconded. I couldn't figure this part out.
babylon5,gadnn,Sdtodd,3,Thu Mar 24 16:32:56 2011 UTC,"I'm surprised to see the Gathering only having one star, I understand the main conflict of the episode doesn't have a lot of importance later on, but surely people need to have the basis for the characters relationship with one another."
babylon5,gadnn,kraetos,3,Thu Mar 24 14:32:28 2011 UTC,"Not only does it introduce every charecter, but it also introduces the concept of the Vorlons not wanting to be seen and shows how far they will take that.  An important plot element for the main story line."
babylon5,gadnn,co_fragment,3,Thu Mar 24 14:54:26 2011 UTC,I didn't see The Gathering until many years after the start of the series. I would never introduce anyone to B5 by showing it to them. And I've never found that anyone missed anything by skipping it.
babylon5,gadnn,mothdna,1 point,Thu Mar 24 20:56:27 2011 UTC,"Yeah, it's hard for me to say otherwise because I did see The Gathering first, in terms of quality, I'd prefer to avoid it as an introduction to the series, although I have no problem with it, a sceptical viewer might.

babylon5,gadnn,undergarden,1 point,Thu Mar 24 23:11:32 2011 UTC,"Ugh, no.

babylon5,gadnn,kraetos,2,Fri Mar 25 00:31:42 2011 UTC,"I always feel like if someone's going to watch B5 they might as well watch the entire thing. Particularly with the first season, it sets up the world in general and the station itself as places that feel 'real'.  Even if you have to plod through Infection or Grail, at least you get to bitch with the rest of the fans after and know what you're talking about. The opinions on which episodes to skip are always so objective."

babylon5,gadnn,ntr0p3,1 point,Thu Mar 24 16:32:30 2011 UTC,"Here's mine.  Similar concept, different execution. I only have 4 tiers, you have 6. You focused almost entirely on arc relevance, but I tried to take episode quality into account as well.  Also, it looks like you lent a little more weight to certain sub-arcs, like the Psi-Corps or The Great Machine. I think this would result in a more balanced viewing than mine does..."
babylon5,gag2c,kraetos,3,Thu Mar 24 12:56:32 2011 UTC,"I mean, go for it, but lets be honest... Crusade was pretty bad.  Also, has there been a jump in the number of Rangers recently? Last week I sent a bunch of Niners over from r/startrek. I wonder how many stuck around."

babylon5,g8gj9,lizzyshoe,3,Mon Mar 21 20:59:52 2011 UTC,"I was working on this post to put this on the main page, but it might as well go here.  A quick trip to Wikipedia reminds me the list of novels considered canon by JMS are:  Babylon 5 #7: The Shadow Within by Jeanne Cavelos (only 90% canon)  Babylon 5 #9: To Dream in the City of Sorrows by Kathryn M. Drennan  The Psi-Corps Trilogy by J. Gregory Keyes.  The Centauri Trilogy by Peter David  The Technomage Trilogy by Jeanne Cavelos  Personally ""To Dream..."" is the only one I feel completely satisfys me as a part of B5 canon that I would recommend EVERY B5 fan read. The characters feel spot-on and it's a great story that doesn't try and violently shoe-horn itself into the series continuity.  ""The Shadow Within"" - Jeanne Cavelos's book is also excellent, the IPX mission to Z'Ha'Dum and what they find there is well written and full of awe and dread, knowing the outcome doesn't change how well this story is told (the John Sheridan side-story is okay but a bit disposable though). However the flaw it has is one that pretty much ruins the book for me - namely her take on Morden's motivation. It doesn't really make complete sense and never fits right with the Morden we see on screen. Had he suffered the same fate as Anna Sheridan (removed from a Shadow vessel with his personality altered) then that would have fit his character far better. Apparently JMS considers this novel only 90% canon - hopefully the Morden part is the 10%.  The Trilogy sets are all good, but all have a few issues:   The Psi-Corps novels are really interesting, but feel almost detatched from B5 and are almost too down-beat and dystopian.  The Centauri trilogy doesn't feel grand enough, while it answers MANY of the outstanding B5 questions (in particular the David Sheridan affair), it does it in a way I found mostly unsatisfying and low-key despite the scale of the events... It's a weak outing for the usually reliable Peter David that doesn't sparkle.  The Technomage Trilogy was better, despite revolving around the Techno-mages and Galen (I always felt lukewarm to the whole concept, but I know for many they were a favourite aspect of the show). The tale of their route to exile and Galen's parts in it are pretty entertaining although sometimes it's a bit slow and Galens ENDLESS soul searching gets very tiresome. The origins of the tech and how it all works is very well worked out as well as the expansion of the TM society and politics. Unfortunately Cavelos tries to cram a denuement visit to Z'Ha'Dum by Galen at the same time as John Sheridan and it suffers a ton of contrivances and coincidences that broke my suspension of disbelief as she tried to tie far too many story threads together. It tries to fix a few plot holes (such as how the hell the Shadows allow Sheridan's White Star to sit in orbit stuffed full of nukes), but you just feel the trilogy would have been better served without trying to have a fan-pleasing tie-in at the end. That Galen meets Lorien feels the most wrong of all.   The other novels justifiably languish as only having 'canonical parts' - If I remember they were all pretty weak except for ""Clarke's Law"" which is a great example of what a good tie-in novel can do - It tells an interesting tale opening up the universe on a subject the show itself couldn't really do."
babylon5,g8gj9,co_fragment,2,Mon Mar 21 23:05:13 2011 UTC,"Wow, thanks. This should be enough to get me started. Off to Paperbackswap to start making some orders."
babylon5,g8gj9,van_buskirk,1 point,Mon Mar 21 23:15:50 2011 UTC,"Yeah definitely read the Technomage Trilogy.  It definitely serves as a good insider look at the ideology of the Shadow War, from the viewpoint of a character that knows a lot more about what is going on than any of the mains of the series.  Really interesting look at the Shadows, their technology, and their minions.  ""To Dream in the City of Sorrows"" also has to be recommended, if only b/c it's the only book to be officially accepted as cannon by JMS.  It can get a little tedious at the beginning, but I felt a lot more interested in Sinclair's character after reading it.  It also clears a up a lot of the more convoluted bits of the Rangers and the time-travel plotline in Season 1 and 3."
babylon5,g45a9,USSMunkfish,6,Tue Mar 15 04:00:15 2011 UTC,"Agreed, brilliant finale. I still remember watching it debut, trying to shield the tv from bright sunshine during Channel 4's bizarre ""we don't want Babylon 5's target audience to watch it"" weekend morning slot.  Honestly the only good movie is In The Beginning, the rest range from decent-ish long filler episode quality to truly dire. You might want to check out Excalibur though. Only about 13 episodes, but it had its moments."

babylon5,g45a9,daboku,3,Tue Mar 15 17:36:56 2011 UTC,"Small point to make: The final episode of b5 was not filmed at the end of season 5, but rather at the end of season 4, because they didn't -at the time - think they were going to be renewed for a fifth season. That is why Susan came back - because she left after the end of s4 filming, after the filming of the last episode. I think I read somewhere there was a big brouhaha about her getting credits for the episode, since she wasn't in the rest of the season."
babylon5,g45a9,pupeno,2,Tue Mar 15 23:14:19 2011 UTC,"Order was important if you placed them at the correct position inside the main Babylon 5 timeline, right now, it doesn't really matter.

babylon5,futfl,gschizas,10,Tue Mar 1 04:21:41 2011 UTC,"The reason was that indeed TNT was pushing B5 to end in 4 seasons, and it wasn't known if there was going to be a fifth season until the second half of the 4th. So, (in order to not leave the B5 story unfinished), JMS compressed the 4th season to contain much of what happened in the 5th one. The final battle between Humans, Vorlons and the Shadows was supposed to be the end of the 4th season.  The very final episode (5th season's ""Sleeping in Light"") was filmed as the last episode of the 4th season (and was replaced with another episode - that even has Claudia Christian missing from the credits)  After getting word that indeed there was going to be a 5th season, most of the 4th season had been written and filmed, so the 5th season has a lot of filler."
babylon5,futfl,kraetos,3,Tue Mar 1 05:23:10 2011 UTC,"The final battle between Humans, Vorlons and the Shadows was supposed to be the end of the 4th season.   You mean ""Into the Fire?"" No, ""Into the Fire"" is where it was supposed to be, and the majority of season 4 was always intended to be about the Earth Civil War. ""Intersections in Real Time"" was supposed to be the end of the 4th season and ""Endgame"" would have been about a third of the way into season 5, much like ""Into the Fire"" was a third of the way into season 4.  Basically, 4x19-21 was supposed to be 5x01-07. And you can tell—those three episodes are packed.  Then we would of had the Centauri-ISA war arc happen in the back half of season 5, and the Byron arc would have been compressed down to 3 or 4 episodes.  This, IMO, would have been ideal. Season 5 gets a lot of flak for Byron and everyone always seems to forget that the Centauri-ISA war was awesome."
babylon5,futfl,USSMunkfish,2,Fri Mar 25 00:09:20 2011 UTC,"The final battle between Humans, Vorlons and the Shadows was supposed to be the end of the 4th season.   I liked how it worked out though. I just finished S4 and I enjoyed the change of pace with how all the big stuff wasn't saved for some end-of-season cliffhanger. It was really unexpected, I wish more shows were as unpredictable."
babylon5,futfl,undergarden,3,Thu Mar 3 04:05:38 2011 UTC,"You are right. But DO watch the very last episode of Season 5 after finishing Season 4! It is glorious and was meant to end Season 4 if Season 5 didn't get made.  And even if S5 otherwise isn't exactly GREAT, it isn't all that bad, either."

babylon5,el0v2,Tartantyco,2,Mon Dec 13 14:37:56 2010 UTC,"Learning Curve  Subtitled: Due process? What due process?  Not that long ago, several anvils fell from the sky asserting that Delenn is the font of all that is good. Now, we have her ordering her minions to summarily beat a thug into unconsciousness for assaulting one of her employees. I suppose one could call Delenn the font of all that is good amidst all this if one assumes that it is a good thing for a military leader to use her forces as a personal death squad, but otherwise it just makes her look like a bully with delusions of morality.  For going along with this, Sheridan is either a moral vacuum or completely unable to oppose his wife on issues that are important to her.  Unsurprisingly, JMS took the easy way out by not showing us which rather than portray either of his Mary Sues protagonists in an unfavorable light.  The implications of the ISA running a death squad accountable in law only to the dictator-president were swept under the rug far too quickly.  That Sheridan rubber stamps Delenn's idea of justice is less of an issue than the fact that he has the right to sanction death squad activity against ISA citizens in the first place.  Putting that level of power in the hands of a single, unaccountable, leader rarely ends well.  If the Rangers really are unaccountable to anyone other than the ISA president, how are they in any way better than Clark's Black Omega?  G'Kar's lament to his own people (not removing one dictator to install another) seems to be utterly lost on Sheridan.  It says nothing good about the ISA member governments that none of them care enough about the rights of their citizens to draw a line in the sand against the ISA having the legal right to order the revenge beating of an ISA citizen for the explicit purpose of spreading terror.  I don't get the impression Delenn's jealous of Lochley.  She's angry because Sheridan didn't tell her his reasons for selecting Lochley to manage B5 on a day-to-day basis “ten seconds after” he thought of them.  It takes a special brand of industrial strength hypocrisy for Delenn to be upset about that, but industrial strength hypocrisy is what she specializes in.  Speaking of due process, why ever did Vir get away with criminal damage and assault?  Presumably, hehas diplomatic immunity and can't be charged with anything, but both Lochley and Sheridan have grounds to throw him off the station.  He should not have walked away from that little fit without consequences.  If anything, the overall message from this episode from both Mora'dum and Vir's little tantrum is that the right kind of 'good' people should be above the laws of mere mortals.  JMS may be selling, but I'm not buying.  Strange Relations  Two supposedly intelligent professionals who keep very deadly secrets for their day jobs decide to have a very private conversation while walking down a public hallway.  Right.  I can see that.  What a weird coincidence that the two ISA leaders most interested in developing a catalog of cross species infections also have the most interest in cross-species sexual intercourse.  I'm just saying....  Dear Byron: DIAF now."

No Compromises  Somebody won a victory against EA's fascist wing, so it's time for another hostage taking and assassination attempt!  This is getting repetitive.  Station security is typically incompetent in allowing a deranged assassin (again...) to steal a Starfury.  Garibaldi (as a civilian) has his own personal Starfury?  By saying that only loosely run commands have regular crises, Lochley is implicitly calling Sheridan incompetent.  Of course, she's right, but that's not a smart thing to say about her boss.  “President” Sheridan would have benefited greatly from surrounding himself with more people who had the level of professionalism Lochley's claims to have.  The chain of command--something never very well defined on B5--gets even more muddled.  The station is supposedly an independent state, but the CO is an EF officer provided by EA because...why exactly?  If Lochley's on temporary loan to the ISA, shouldn't she be wearing an ISA/Ranger uniform along side the rest of her senior staff?  For that matter, who's paying the junior crew right now?  EA or the ISA?  ""President"" Sheridan has two heads of intelligence (Delenn and Garibaldi) but proceeds to ignore the best advice of both of them.  Smart, that.  Real smart.  Dear Byron: DIAF now."
babylon5,egsaz,vacant-cranium,2,Mon Dec 6 05:52:08 2010 UTC,"The Very Long Night of Londo Mollari  The Londo plot was an interesting piece of drama but it's hard to say that it actually had a point to the arc.  Minbari information security must be awful if Lennier can send an official message in Delenn's name.  Either that or Delenn's not quite bright enough to realize that she shouldn't keep her passwords (any guesses it's 'john4ever'?) on a post-it note beside her terminal...  Wouldn't sending a forged message be considered lying?  Lennier going for military training starting at the ground floor seems somewhat beneath him given that he's been administering beatdowns both hand-to-hand and as pilot/operator of a White Star for the past few years already.  Remember the conspicuous use of the word 'goodbye' between Delenn and Lennier.  It's part of a plot hole later.  “On Minbar, three is sacred.”  Just how far did Delenn intend that to go and just how many psychoactive berries had she eaten to think it had any hope of working?  I can't see her as wanting a sexually polyandrous relationship including Lennier but even establishing something resembling a surrogate child arrangement (as she seems to want) would have been very difficult even among emotionally well adjusted people.  None of the parties (least of all Delenn) are particularly well adjusted.  Pity we didn't see Delenn's new aid/aides and whether she learned her lesson from Lennier and refused to let her new staff look up at her or not."
babylon5,egsaz,vacant-cranium,2,Mon Dec 6 06:19:25 2010 UTC,"The Paragon of Animals  Seems those pesky skeptics in Deconstruction were right about Sheridan needing to pull out the bigs guns to maintain order after all.  Seems to me that the declaration of principles should have left out the philosophy in favor of a much more concrete list of rights and duties.  Starting with 'no ISA member shall conduct acts of piracy against any other state.'  In the hierarchy of needs, survival and safety are rather far above philosophical reasoning.    JMS has completely fscked up the military hierarchy again.  The White Stars are supposed to be the most advanced warships in the galaxy—capable during the Shadow war of earning one-shot kills against Shadow spiders—but now they're so vulnerable that even raiders—raiders that Sinclair killed like flies using Season 1 EA technology—can critically damage them.  Delenn quotes from Dukhat about terror. How much does Sheridan know about Delenn's background and training?  There's ample unfinished business here that we should have seen dealt with.  Does he know how close Dukhat was to her? Did they agree, tacitly or explicitly, to share everything except what they did during the war?  Did she declare her entire professional life prior to their first meeting off-limits?  Either way, we should have seen it, if only in flashback to give us something more interesting and rewarding to watch than hours of footage of whining sociopaths telepaths.  Dear Byron: DIAF now."
babylon5,egsaz,vacant-cranium,2,Mon Dec 6 06:45:09 2010 UTC,"A View from the Gallery  Naturally, protecting peripheral worlds from random acts of piracy is so important that there aren't enough ships available—out of the combined strength of all three Minbari castes and the smaller members of the ISA—to permanently station an adequate defense force to protect the ISA's capital city.  Or are the raiders now so powerful that they could take down a group of Sharlins?  Naturally, the failure to post a credible defense force for the ISA's capital city when most of the fleet is out playing with the border worlds, nearly resulting in the death or capture of the entire ISA government, doesn't result in a formal inquiry which ends with the responsible staff being forced to resign.  Naturally, the escape pods are a safer place than the station for the ISA president and VP to hide out in a firefight.  Because, of course, defenseless lifeboats would be too difficult for armed bandits to destroy or capture and hold for ransom.  Naurally, Delenn's first thoughts in this situation would be to find some way to bring about a messy, lingering, suicide rather than to do anything useful.  Naturally, having two throw-away characters comment on just how wonderful the protagonists are isn't enough to make a showrunner who's lost his scripts wonder if he's created a bunch of Mary Sues.  Naturally, a showrunner who's struggling to write a season without any pre-planned material didn't think about turning the aftermath of the attack into a mini-arc that involves an inquiry, includes some public ridicule on ISN (“If Sheridan's government can barely protect itself, how can it protect us?”), and ends with everyone responsible realizing that they have to step up their game a little.  That would have been good for a few episodes, but, naturally, we were treated to more whining sociopaths telepaths instead.  Dear Byron: DIAF now."

babylon5,ed8g8,irskep,2,Wed Jan 26 04:56:48 2011 UTC,"** ISA Arc Commentary **  Throughout the Shadow War era of B5 (up to ItF), there was a pretty clear indication of where, in broad terms, the plot would be going.  The war would be fought and, ultimately, it would be resolved in some way or other.  The details of how the war would be resolved were always a surprise, but there was always that highly visible end goal and there was never any doubt that every bit of plot connected to the main arc lead towards bringing the great war to an end.  The ISA arc, extending from Lines of Communication to Rising Star, however, was very different.  This arc was entirely hidden and seemingly undirected until after it was finished.  From all appearances, S&D spent the last half of season 4 spinning their wheels, floundering like a pair of incompetents, reacting to problems thrown at them by others rather than trying to accomplish anything meaningful.  It's only after the arc was done and the ISA treaty was presented that the viewer sees, roughly, that S&D did have a plan, weren't actually letting themselves be overwhelmed by events, weren't really spinning their wheels after all, and were really playing a Machiavellian game so perfect that no one even noticed the game was afoot until S&D had won and installed themselves as leaders of the galaxy.  This does not make for a good narrative strategy because it trivializes most of the episodes between LoC and RS instead of emphasizing their real importance.  In hindsight, it's clear that Sheridan wasn't crazy, he was instead crazy like a fox, and perhaps a little drunk on the realization that he was going to be crowned dictator president of the galaxy.  If we the viewers had known any of this, then the run between LoC and RS would have been much more tolerable.  Viewers like to know what their protagonists are really up to.  Indeed, outside of a very small segment of largely experimental literature, the entire basis of fiction is to tell the audience what the protagonist is doing and why.  It is only in very rare circumstances that actively hiding the protagonist(s) motivations and goals from the audience adds substance to a work.  Fight Club and The Sixth Sense are rare examples of this technique working reasonably well in film.   The ISA arc of B5 was definitely not one of these cases where keeping the audience in the dark added to the work.  For the ISA arc to work from a critical perspective, the fact that S&D were actually working on the ISA, rather than running around chasing their own tails for no obvious purpose, needed to be known to the viewer at the opening of the project.  Fiction is not a surprise party.  The audience needs to know where, roughly, the plot is going: if there's a war, while the resolution will be unpredictable, it's obvious that the war needs to be fought.  If there's an permanent alliance to be built, the audience needs to know that it is being built.  The suspense and payoff comes from not knowing if the project will succeed, not from seeing—as we did in Rising Star—the project pulled out of a hat, fully formed, in circumstances that can best be described as contrived.  If I had written this part of B5, I would have put almost all the cards on the table to the viewer immediately after Epiphanies.  Delenn, Sheridan, Londo and G'Kar would have explicitly cooked up the project over a few drinks where Delenn (the ISA was her idea in the real canon, after all) tells all of them that she'd like to keep the Drakh (who she did see them escaping from ZHD) from metastasizing into a galaxy-wide cancer in order to leave a safer future for her kids.  S&D will have a cute mini-fight over the fact that she's never mentioned children before, and then roll into some political horse trading to bring Londo and G'Kar on side (e.g. offering Minbari ships to protect Narn and Centauri Prime until they can rebuild their fleets, as well as positions for Londo and G'Kar in the ISA government), with the ultimate conclusion that Clark needs to be removed before he finds common cause with the Drakh.  The plot then continues roughly as it was given in canon with only a few minor tweaks.  Delenn goes to fix Minbar—before everything goes completely to hell—to protect her power base.  Once the GC is restored, the Minbari secretly give Sheridan permission to use the White Stars to destroy Clark.  Everyone else gets in on the slaughter liberation of EA once the Shadow Omegas appear because, by that point, everyone recognizes that Shadow-armed Clark is a threat to everyone.  Earth is forced to surrender, pay compensation for sitting out the Shadow War, and hold new elections.  The ISA project rolls forward with the willing membership of some peripheral EA worlds while Earth chooses to remain independent.  Cue a version of Season 5 that doesn't suck.  The extra character development from this arc variant, in the form of Sheridan being put into a position of destroying his own government at the behest of the Minbari, Delenn having to deal with her own guilt head on by sanctioning another war against Earth (this gets the content of Atonement out without the rape overtones), G'Kar having to push back against other Narn who would want EA wiped out in revenge for selling the Narn down the river during the Shadow war, and so on, comes for free.  The ultimate point is that we'd get to almost the same the end result seen in Rising Star in a way that's both plausible and of at least equal quality to the plotting seen during the Shadow War era.  These relatively minor changes to the canon are all it would have taken to raise season 4 out of the gutter and up to something at least on par with what B5 was during the Shadow War era: the best serial scifi TV before nBSG.  But what do I know--I'm just some anonymous no-nothing bozo on the Internet...."
babylon5,ed8g8,vacant-cranium,2,Tue Nov 30 07:14:31 2010 UTC,"Rising Star  Isil'zha veni, this one is painful.  In crossover fanfics, the usual practice is for each universe's respective protagonist factions to be written to immediately ally with each other on the assumption that every faction written to the viewer as sympathetic must also be sympathetic to each other.  It doesn't take much thought to see the problem with this.  Rising Star, building on the rotten foundation established in BtDatL, suffers from the same problem: factions portrayed to the viewer as sympathetic suddenly start acting sympathetic to each other despite having divergent interests.  Throw in some dumber than usual abuses of the idea of a chain of command, and a complete evasion of the powers of confirmation bias and self delusion on public opinion, and the resulting script would fit far better in a kids show than in the franchise that gave us work the caliber of Severed Dreams.  Confirmation bias being what it is, Sheridan isn't going to get out of this without being reviled by Earth's population.  Public opinion in propaganda cultures is not rational—look at how many Americans believe Iraq was behind 9/11.  Realistically, Sheridan would be blamed for making Clark turn the defense grid against the population and hated for bringing in a bunch of aliens to strip Earth of its defenses.  This is how nationalists think.  If Sheridan surrenders to EarthGov, his chances of getting away alive would realistically depend entirely on how scared EarthGov would be of Delenn and Londo ordering the Earth razed if Sheridan was not returned.  The only way for Sheridan to get out of this in a way that doesn't smack of fanfic for and by twelve year olds is for him to demand Earth's complete surrender (not just the removal of Clark) and keep the big guns in orbit while he imposes a government shaped to his liking.  In short, hold the civilian population hostage.  From the alliance side, things are worse.  National interests being what they are, honest writing would mean Delenn being reviled both by her people and the alliance for wasting thousands of lives to save Earth while failing to secure anything in return.  There ought to be an awful lot of Minbari and alliance officials, veterans and next-of-kin wondering very, very loudly why their soldiers, friends and colleagues were sacrificed for the benefit of Earth rather than for the Alliance itself.  That's not what their people the signed up for.  Just because the viewer is supposed to care about what happens to Earth doesn't mean the rank and file League and Minbari crews ought to be happy to sacrifice their lives for a planet populated by a bunch of undeserving freeloading savages so supportive of Clark that they very nearly return his party to office in the next election.  The only way Delenn's going to get out of this—again, given an honest writer—is to demand Earth's surrender and extract a meaningful bone to throw to her own people.  Forcing Earth to hand over and destroy all of its Shadow technology would be a start.  Extracting financial compensation/reparations to the League/alliance for military losses incurred during the great war would be another option.  Naturally, the episode is written to end with everyone and their dog (except for Bester) treating S&D as  god's gift to the universe, however, if the writing was anywhere near honest and S&D did exactly what was shown in the canon, they'd both be shuffled off somewhere—retirement, exile, jail, or execution—where they'll never harm anyone else again.  Delenn's relationship to power is, as usual, very confused.  On the one hand, she's competent enough to maneuver events to make Space Jesus into President Jesus as something of a wedding present to him, but on the other hand she's too naïve to see any problem with letting an a new and untrusted Earthgov keep Shadow technology or to have any reservations about further undermining Minbari security by offering Earthgov gravetics.  There's a very fine line between a complex character—such as someone who is unreasonably generous to humanity out of personal guilt for EM War I—and fscked up writing.  The fact that Delenn give away the store without any consequences from her peers suggests that she's on the 'bad writing' side of it.  The Minbari have no reason to assume that post-Clark EA will be any less dangerous to peace than pre-Clark EA was back when it sent a violent hothead on a first contact mission.  There are also an awful lot of humans out there who are itching for a rematch of the Battle of the Line—and given that Clark was elected as VP, it's only a matter of time until one of them winds up in power.  Giving away the store to a bunch of violent savages who may well take it into their heads to sack Minbar is not smart.  Why the new Grey Council allowed Delenn to manage EM War II alone—despite her being in a deep conflict of interest on two fronts due to Sheridan and her guilt over EM War I—is beyond me.  They should have sent a Satai or three to handle EM War II objectively and left Delenn on B5 to work on Sheridan's wedding present building the ISA.  This isn't B5 as it was during the good years. This is bad fan fiction that just happened to have been produced for television."

What was that I said after Rising Star about the Minbari being utterly crazy to give anything to Earth?    Given how much of a pain in the arse Earth and EA were to the ISA over the next million years, it's an open question if S&D wouldn't have been better off to freeze EA out rather than invite them inside.  You're generally better off to have an enemy outside the tent trying to p--s in through a closed door rather than an enemy inside the tent p--sing on your own bedroll.  There's a plot glitch with Delenn's reappearance given what was known when DoFS aired about Minbari lifespans and Delenn's age.  She was supposed to be 140 when she barged in on the conference.  Word from JMS is that Minbari live to be either 160 or 200.  Given these figures, no one should have been surprised that she's still alive.  Worse yet, unless Delenn kept Sheridan in the dark about her age, Sheridan shouldn't have been wondering if they'd be remembered in a hundred years because she'd still be around to make sure no one forgot anything she wanted them to remember.  Delenn's age was retconned after DoFS to make her much older, but, if you really believe she was in her mid sixties when she was on the station, I have a bridge to sell you, and, that retcon still doesn't explain DoFS as written.  I was not impressed in the slightest by the substance of Delenn's efforts to protect Sheridan's honor.  She sounded like a semi-senile and very bitter widow still in emotional pain over the loss of her husband, eighty years after his death.  The implication that she never got over Sheridan emotionally is very clear.  It's also very unfortunate because it means Delenn chose to define herself not on the basis of her own not insubstantial accomplishments but in terms of forever standing in the shadow of the man she loved for a very small slice of her life.  That's a damn misogynist ending for any professional woman much less for someone who has a very legitimate claim to be seen as a national hero in her own right.  She should have been standing there telling the historians that the credit for creating the ISA belonged to many: herself, Sheridan, G'Kar, Londo, and the people who supported them."
babylon5,ed8g8,vacant-cranium,0,Tue Nov 30 06:43:58 2010 UTC,"Between the Darkness and the Light  If Epiphanies is where the series starts to suck, this is where the series starts to blow.  Where's Plinkett when you need him?  JMS has spent the past four years painting Earth and 99.999% of humanity as, at most, one step above the scum of the universe.  This includes Psicorps, pre-Clark ISN, rank-and-file members of EF (remember GROPOS), to the isolationist bigots in the Mars resistance.  The only redeemable humans identified are the station crew and the (largely unseen) human Rangers.  Now, after four years of this buildup, suddenly all of humanity becomes so special that the rest of the galaxy drops everything to save the human race from a government that's (as far as everyone knows at this point) not hugely worse than business-as-usual in the Centauri 'pain technicians' Empire or the Minbari 'what civil rights?' Federation.  That's hard to swallow.  I get Londo and G'Kar's arguments for intervention in the EA civil war, but neither character should be making any of those arguments given what has already been established about Centauri and Narn national interests.  Londo and G'Kar may owe something to Sheridan personally (which would make launching a commando raid to retrieve him reasonable) but this by no means extends to owing humanity anything whatsoever.  Sheridan is not the personification of humanity.  The League, Narn and Minbari have every reason to dislike and mistrust the bulk of the human population.  With the exception of the humans who joined the Rangers to fight the Shadow war, the bulk of humanity shirked their civic responsibilities.   In but one example, the Narn ought to be a little bitter over EA's decision to sit on their hands while the Centauri bombed Narn back to the stone age.  In total the human race exists only because of the sacrifices made by the Narn, League and Minbari during the great war to stop the planet killing spree.  Humanity, in short, are the galaxy's freeloaders rather than its saviors.  When the League is asked to intervene to save humanity, the operative question should be 'what have these idiots done for us lately?'  With the answer being 'nothing,' the proper response from the League should have been 'sucks to be them.'  Worse still, from a viewer's perspective, it's very, very hard to care about liberating the bulk of humanity when the core EA population has been painted as the enemy for the entire series.  The only humans depicted as worth caring about are already free and the ones 'suffering' under Clark have been almost universally portrayed as the kind of people who deserve his leadership.  It's hard to see much of a point in liberating, for instance, Mars when even the 'good guys' in the Martian resistance are just as xenophobic and reactionary as Clark.  It's time to utter the eight deadly words and treat the rest of the EA civil war as unintentionally funny in an MST3K sense."

Awareness of all of this takes a bit of the edge off, I think (it's still amazing work.)   But to be in the middle of an episode early in the series, when Londo is still something of a buffoon, and suddenly hear his voice grow so very, very weary as he says ""My shoes are too tight, and I have forgotten how to dance.""  Honestly, to me - that one line is the heart of Babylon 5. Underneath all the pomp and circumstance and bluster, he is an old man who feels that life has passed him by."

Of course there were the funny scenes too, like when Londo waves to G'Kar from the elevator. G'Kar had just learned that Londo was the only person on Babylon 5 who had a GQuan Eth plant.  Or again, in another lift after the station was attacked when G'Kar refuses to help Londo escape from the elevator they are stuck in because in doing so, he will be able to kill Londo without breaking the law that would cause 500 Narns to be executed.

The Rangers are ultimately funded, trained and supported by the--now completely reconstituted--Minbari government.  All fuel, crewing and repair costs associated with Sheridan going to war against EA will ultimately be born by the Minbari.  Ranger facilities throughout Minbari territory will also be quite legitimately be open to counterattack by EA.  In short, using the White Stars to attack EA means tipping the first domino towards open warfare between EA and the Minbari. B5 appreciation of the finer points of international relations has never been notable, but putting Sheridan in a position of being able to use Minbari assets to bring EA and the Minbari to the brink of EM War II without needing any kind of permission from the official Minbari government ranks up there as one of B5's stupider ideas about politics and authority.  Awkward legal and logistics issues, meet rug entitled 'JMS ignorance.'  Get swept under.  It's awfully dubious that the Omegas are harder targets than Shadow ships.  Sheridan is pushing the EA crews to surrender, but given that the White Stars were earning one-shot kills against Shadow ships during the great war, the idea of the Omegas holding out for more than a few seconds before being crippled is completely ridiculous.  The WS-Omega battle ends with the Omega captains being forced to the point of defeat and then changing sides after having examined Sheridan's motives and found them to be true.  Haven't we seen this denouement fifteen times before?  Where does Sheridan intend to get fuel and other supplies for his defecting ships?  FTE  Sheridan can't claim that this is a 'clean' human-to-human civil war when the Minbari (in the form of the Rangers) are providing all his heavy firepower.  Keeping Delenn in the shadows for PR purposes is a good idea (she is a walking PR disaster, after all), but it doesn't change the fact that the backbone of the fleet is hers, or that she'll be the backstop if EA decides to counterattack against B5 or the Rangers.  Command and direct materiel support are two different things, but are equally damning from a propaganda perspective.  Does Ivanova really have the training and experience to lead major fleet battles?  That's not normally within the skill set of a commander who's spent a fair chunk of her career to date tending a single space station and/or doing single ship work....  Sheridan has an awfully bad habit of trusting people he really shouldn't.  But, he's dumb like that.  Dumb like concrete.  IRT  JMS has quite a torture fetish, doesn't he?  I'd be surprised if any series before 24 beat out B5 for the sheer number of implicit and explicit torture scenes."

I see his name is listed first now in the credits.    OMG, just watched 4-17 and it sucks, it's so stupid!  Let's count the ways.   There is no way in hell sheridan would risk getting caught just to rescue his father.  There's a million other ways he could have tried to attempt a rescue without letting the figurehead of the rebellion to get caught.  Whitestars are based on a combination of Mimbari and Vorlon technology, but a big deal was made of how earth ships couldn't hurt mimbari ships, much less vorlon ones.  Why do they seem so easy to destroy now?   Why would Sheridan's father be transported from earth to mars when mars is still in rebellion and easier to be removed from? Garibaldi was captured by shadows, not by psicorp.  He's not a telepath, unless shadows were working directly with bester, there was no reason for capturing him, especially since the shadows already had sheridan in their possession."
babylon5,e9tze,ttifiblog,1 point,Sun Jan 23 08:09:41 2011 UTC,"He's going to see Garibaldi about a possible rescue plan, he still trusts him as he's unaware of Bester's control over Garibaldi. He has numerous friends, allies, and agents on Mars and doesn't feel as if he's taking a huge risk.  Whitestars are much smaller than Minbari cruisers and Minbari ships aren't indestructible; Sheridan destroyed a Cruiser, but that was a lone ship that was unaware of his ship's presence. The Minbari ""indestructibility"" was due to them working in groups, numerically superior and with much greater firepower. Additionally, Earthforce weapons technology has improved since the Battle of the Line.  The Psicorps has a secret intelligence center on Mars, at Syria Planum, which they use for these things.  The Shadows use Psicorps ""pilots"" and have a close relationship with Earth Alliance. Garibaldi was captured by the Shadows on request by the Psicorps to be re-programmed. After Garibaldi was re-programmed Bester re-directed the transport he was on to a facility of his own choosing, discovered what the Psicorps had programmed him to do, then changed it to suit his own needs. Again, the objective of the Shadows is to create chaos and anarchy, pit one group against the other, their objective was not to specifically catch Sheridan(Who they wanted as an ally). Catching Garibaldi was not a Shadow plan, it was an Earth Alliance plan which the Shadows helped them accomplish, another task aimed at causing chaos."
babylon5,e9tze,ttifiblog,1 point,Sun Jan 23 11:59:15 2011 UTC,"There's nothing he can't coordinate with garibaldi over communication channels, there's no need for sheridan to be directly involved even if they need to meet face to face, he could send an emissary such as markus in his place.  It's the same idiocy that sees sheridan and sinclair ever getting into star furries in the same place.  Commanders are kept in positions of power, you never expose your king.  Sheridan destroyed a cruiser by mining an asteroid field.  The reason they didn't destroy any other ships was because they couldn't track them.   Earthgov wasn't using psicorps training center as an interrogation room, that's why there are no psicops interrogating sheridan.   The shadows were not using telepaths, they wanted to, but the shipment was intercepted.  This is why we don't see shadows operating on the telepaths in their flashes, we see some other alien race.  The shadows would not have had any interest in garibaldi, ivanova OTH.   The point is that the plot holes and rewrites are large enough to drive a truck through and detract from the overall storytelling."
babylon5,e9tze,ttifiblog,1 point,Sun Jan 23 13:56:28 2011 UTC,"Again, he went himself because he didn't want to waste Council resources or risk the lives of others on a personal mission.  The Earth-Minbari war happens because a Minbari Cruiser is attacked and damaged, killing the Minbari leader, they frequently take damage during battles, they aren't indestructible.  It's an Earth Alliance installation, it's not as if they can't use it.  No, they intercepted one shipment. Also, Shadows have a myriad of races who act as their servants.  And again, the Shadows don't have any interest in Garibaldi or Ivanova, they have an interest in stoking the flames of conflict, and if somebody wants Garibaldi or Ivanova and this furthers the objectives of the Shadows then they will do it.  You seem to have missed large portions of the B5 story here, it's no wonder you think you're finding massive plot holes(Although there are admittedly some). You also have to keep in mind that this is a TV show, they have to make various concessions for technical, practical, and budgetary reasons that sometimes affect the credibility of some things. If you add an emissary with lines of dialogue to an episode then you actually have to pay the guy who's playing him, inflating the cost of that episode. Additionally, at that point a fifth season was looking a little uncertain and JMS had to squeeze two seasons worth of plot into a single season, which sometimes leads to somewhat odd events and some hurried parts."
babylon5,e61gb,Tartantyco,2,Sun Nov 14 20:25:28 2010 UTC,"Lines of Communication   Kind of funny how Valen's institution is so pervasive.  It makes sense though that once a power base is eliminated, someone else will try and fill it.  I think it shows how the people of Minbar thought goodwill would carry them along.  Naive perhaps, but ""Minbari do not kill Minbari"" is so ingrained that to think otherwise is akin to a sin.  I'm actually liking the way this is playing out even though we don't see much on Minbar. Nice to see Delenn take charge and protect her people (Minbar) against these enemies (both in the battle and at home).  She really does make for a strong character.   Conflicts of Interest   For what it is, I think the Garibaldi character is extremely well played.  The plot line in getting there is a little dry, but it is what it is. Looks like things are gearing up towards an encounter with Earth.  But not much substantial at this point. Mostly a transition episode.  So that's all I'll say for now.   Rumors, Bargains, and Lies   One of my favourite episodes.  I like the fun spirited nature of the entire thing. ""I'll see you all later... probably""  hahaha Londo explaining how he doesn't understand humans was funny.  Not so much the specifics, just the his mannerisms and the way he explains himself. Delenn working with Neroon is a nice turn of events.  I wish we saw more of the ground game on Minbar.  Showing other planets is tough on a small budget though.   Moments of Transition   WOW!  Bester and Lyta.  This is one of those episodes where you really pick up a lot the second time you see the series. Delenn was incredible this episode.  And Neroon didn't betray her.  Funny that.  Delenn was intent on dying to make sure there was no going back to the old ways.  By giving Lennier instructions on how to rebuild the gray council so that the worker caste was in control was brilliant.  Not only is she sacrificing herself, but she holds her promise that if either the warrior caste or the religious caste leads the other, chaos will ensue.  Neroon sees her for the leader that she is and disagrees with the old ways as well because then you would lose said leader.  So he goes in instead.  Not for Delenn specifically.  But for his people because he trusts that Delenn will follow through.  With Lennier or someone else rebuilding the caste, the people may not accept it.  But if the chosen of Dukat, the same person who destroyed the council, rebuilds it... then that has meaning.  Almost like a prophecy coming full circle.  It also has symbolism that the warrior caste is supposed to put their lives on the line to protect the others. Just brilliantly awesome episode.  And Sheridan now has to do what he has to do."
babylon5,e61gb,Vorlath,1 point,Mon Nov 15 03:25:11 2010 UTC,"Lines of Communication  Let me translate S&D's encounter in CnC:  Sheridan: I don't care if your people are under threat, stay here           to keep me happy. Delenn: Fuck off. Sheridan: Did something just fly over my head?   What's Aderonto for 'marrying down?'  Delenn, dear, unless you want to become nothing more than the vessel into which Sheridan empties his 'worry tank,' grow a little self respect and learn to put him down in terms he will understand.  I'm getting fed up with all the hostage takings in this series.  Is this universe really populated by 8 year olds who think they can solve their problems by holding other people at gunpoint, without realizing that taking hostages has consequences that will make all their other problems pale in comparison?  Wait, don't answer that....  Given that she survived Sebastian, Farell threatening Delenn with pain is a bit like threatening to kill a fish by drowning it.  It's notable how many of Delenn's enemies die of fate poisoning without her ever getting her own hands dirty.   Do all Minbari wars involve genocide as a matter of course?   If involving non-Minbari in Minbari affairs is taboo, then what about the human (Ranger) captains of the other White Stars?  You'd think that somebody who's supposed to feel a little guilty about starting a genocidal war after a botched first contact might pause for a few seconds of reflection before wiping out another first contact fleet down to the last ship.  Unless, of course, she's not feeling that guilty.  The Drakh being essentially nomadic at this point, their motherships do carry what passes for the Drakh civilian population.  Naturally, though, the Drakh are so intrinsically EEEEVIL that there's no moral issue whatsoever with massacring them on sight.  In their second scene together, Sheridan pretty clearly wants him and Delenn to stand down into some kind of retirement so they can spend the rest of his life together.  That's a fair request, except for the little fact that he's asking Delenn to stand down when her caste mates are being made victims of a genocide.  Anyone else would have slapped him—or threatened to break off the engagement entirely.  Sheridan is blissfully unaware that he's not the one wearing the pants in the relationship.  Delenn's really pissed at Clark now, to the point where she's barely bothering to hide the fact that she wants Sheridan to kill him.  The last ISN interview must have hurt.  Rule #1 of the B5 universe: never, ever piss Delenn off.  What does Delenn want Sheridan to build and why?  Knowing how this ends, it's easy to read between the lines and conclude that she's afraid of the Drakh and wants to build a permanent alliance to keep them at bay, but this request is voiced so obliquely that there is no way she could have expected Sheridan to understand it given how badly he understands everything else about her.  If this is all Delenn said to Sheridan, she ran the very real risk of coming back from Minbar to find that he built her a doghouse.  Sheridan is dumb like that.   Dumb like concrete.  Given that she didn't come back to see Smiling Space Jesus smiling proudly over a brand new doghouse, I can definitely see Delenn very patiently explaining a larger plan to him after their goodbye dinner, in words of two syllables or less, and not letting him go to bed (with or without her) until he finally understood it....  Delenn has spent the past four years gleefully tearing down massive swaths of the old political order; her suddenly turning towards construction is unexpected and quite out of character.  We needed to see what was driving her here—personal power? a better life for her children? something entirely different?—instead of having her get off her bed one morning and promptly announce that she wants Sheridan to unify the galaxy for her for no obvious reason.  There's no good reason to keep the viewer in the dark about S&D's motivations and objectives here.  Character motivations drive the story, and when they are missing, the story loses focus and ceases to be compelling as it could be.  This is the overarching fault in S4 as compared to the prior three seasons.  It was pretty clear where things were going for the first three years—minus twists added for the purposes of suspense—but in S4 things meander aimlessly without conveying a clear sense of purpose.  As far as the handling of S&D's relationship goes, again, it's jarring how badly the two supposed soulmates communicate.  Sheridan essentially said that the survival of Delenn's caste means nothing to him and yet she doesn't even notice.  Sheridan wants to retire but Delenn won't even entertain the possibility of perhaps potentially discussing the prospect of him finding a quieter life for himself once he's finished following her latest orders.  Nor does she even appear to realize why listening to his needs might be important.  I could see this as perfectly plausible in a political marriage where they stay together purely to cement an alliance, but they're supposed to love each other with a supernatural strength and that ought to mean that they care enough about each other not to plow under life-stages questions with the kind of misdirection and stonewalling tactics that they use against their political opponents."

A plague sounds like a very good idea.  Pacing was bad given how much stuff JMS tried to jam into season 4.  The establishing shots were far too long and much of this episode could have been cut without effecting the arc plot in any way whatsoever.  JMS did too much plot abbreviation in his effort to stuff S4 and S5 into 22 episodes when he should have been cutting subplots wholesale to concentrate on points that mattered.

babylon5,e61gb,vacant-cranium,1 point,Mon Nov 15 07:52:31 2010 UTC,"Rumors, Bargains and Lies  Alliance plot / Sheridan goes nuts  Why didn't Franklin and Ivanova relieve Sheridan for medical/psych evaluation?  For all they know, he might have developed a brain tumor.  The Shadow-Vorlon conflict between obedience and violence has been resurrected with new leaders in place of the old principles.  Sheridan is playing the role of the Vorlons—controlling the galaxy through demands of unquestioning obedience and tactics of manipulation, half truths and lies—and the Drakh are playing the role of the Shadows by using indiscriminate violence against everyone.  The only difference this time is that the Drakh, unlike the Shadows, have no ideological objectives or  pretext of enforcing social Darwinism.  They are simply out to...uhhh...do whatever the script requires of them.  Actual motivations or logical objectives were never the Drakh's strong point as a character.  It's hard to imagine how league species dumb enough to fall for Sheridan's childish gambit—one week after turning down his above-board effort to extend them protection—could figure out how to run their own towns, much less have unified species-level polities.  A certain level of IQ—that certain level being above room temperature—is absolutely required to reach that level.  Where would Franklin get all that blood?  It's not as if B5 is a galaxy-scale blood bank....  Minbari civil war  Word of JMS is that Delenn has no formal authority over her caste.  She simply has enough of a reputation that they follow her voluntarily.  RBL establishes that her reputation alone is strong enough that she could call on her caste to surrender and have them agree.  That level of respect is very hard to square with how Calenn and Farrell treated her.  It's not hugely clear how a big man / consensus government could work on the scale of the Minbari civilization.  It also begs the question about how the caste leaders are paid given their lack of formal positions.  Presumably, the job of Ranger One pays a salary, but that doesn't explain how high-ranking Minbari with less glamorous day jobs pay their bills.  Whatever happened to the ties Delenn had to the worker caste and warrior cast representatives who followed her out of the Grey Council chamber in Severed Dreams?  They would have made for useful allies to force a non-violent end to the conflict.  No one will be doing much fighting if the people who keep the lights on and the water running (i.e. the worker caste) go on strike and tell both sides to shove it.  Lennier was atypically stupid to try to comfort Delenn by mentioning Valen's prophecies given that Lennier was one of the people who helped send Sinclair back in time.  Poor guy seems to have had his brains taken out.  Delenn seems utterly oblivious about how much the seeds of the civil war stem not only from her decision to break the Grey Council but also her role in starting and stopping the EM war.  As much as she seeks to confine her guilt only to her decision to break the GC, the civil war really is about her choices and her leadership in general.  Everything the warrior caste cannot accept has happened as a result of her decisions.  It's very clear how differently Delenn regards her culpability for the Minbari civil war and the EM war.  While her statements regarding her guilt for the EM war are ambiguous deflections of personal responsibility and half-admissions of guilt, she's very acutely aware of her responsibility for the civil war and definitely feels guilt over her role in causing it.  There was great potential here to make Delenn's guilt for the civil war collide head on with her ambiguous guilt for the EM war and force her to cope with both but for some reason JMS didn't want to go there.  One wonders how much damage Delenn's reputation (read: power) would suffer among the RC if they knew about her role in the EM war.  Coughing up the truth about Valen could seal a lot of old wounds.  It's hard to argue that Delenn isn't flirting with Neroon in the same way she makes Sheridan think with his other brain when she wants him to do something important to her.  Negotiating tactic or unsure of her romantic choices?  Either way, ick.  Given the events of MoT, Delenn lied to her caste by telling them that surrender was not part of her plan.  Delenn's far closer now to Lennier than she was early in the season, when Lennier didn't even rate being counted among the people who were important to her.  Naturally, this (dubious) milestone is passed in the same episode that they tell major lies to each other.  Lying to your opposite seems to be the unspoken first ritual of love for Minbari...."
babylon5,e61gb,vacant-cranium,1 point,Mon Nov 15 23:31:54 2010 UTC,"Moments of Transition  Presumably, the Vorlon government stopped paying Lyta as soon as Sheridan executed Kosh.  This means Lyta was unpaid at Coriana 6.  Whoever handled the station/Ranger payroll during the war ought to be looking for another job for that oversight alone.  A pension might have been in order, given her earlier contributions to the war effort, too.  Delenn didn't communicate with Sheridan at all during the 3+ day trip to Minbar, before everything went to hell?  Not even, once seeing how bad the situation was, a message to wish him goodnight, just in case she didn't come back?  That was....cold.  The warrior caste has a point about entering into wars for productive reasons.  One wonders why the only way they could think to make their point involves wiping out the religious caste.  Would Neroon have cooperated with Delenn if he knew how much she was responsible for?  Neroon is concerned for Delenn's safety?  Aww.  She must have been awfully good in bed for Neroon to have such a glorious epiphany.  Nobody seems to have told Shakiri what happened to the people who killed Sheridan's last lover.  Delenn's ruthlessness is on clear display but I wonder how much damage this escapade might have done to her long-term credibility.  She made an agreement with Neroon to end the war but broke it to utterly humiliate his caste when push came to shove.  Anyone she approaches for negotiations in the future ought to think more than twice about whether she'll stab them in the back as well.  That's not a good position for someone who leads by persuasion to be in.  Neroon, like most of the people who get in Delenn's way, however, didn't seem to notice that she just stabbed him in the back and instead sung her praises as if she was the second coming.  Like I said, she must have been awfully good in bed or something.  Since the terms of the original agreement had established that no one was obligated to die to resolve the conflict, why didn't Neroon step out?  The lack of other women among the Minbari leadership is notable.  This is at least the fourth attempt Delenn has made at suicide/heroic sacrifice, after Sebastian, walking into a knife thrown for Sheridan, and trying to kill herself when Sheridan left her.  Ministering to the Markab was a borderline fifth case.  Stack all these events together and it really looks like she has a death wish.  It's also a miracle she hasn't been reduced to a gibbering wreck.  Delenn has now joined Londo and G'Kar in having asserted a willingness to die for the good of their people.  The only species representative yet to make this choice is Sheridan.  Deciding who is fit to rule on the basis of who has the greatest death wish is no basis for a system of government.  There are certain similarities between the internal Minbari conflict and the now-concluded Shadow-Vorlon conflict.  Like the Vorlons, the religious caste rules through lies, half truths, lies of omission, manipulation, and expectations of absolute obedience.  Like the Shadows, the warrior caste prefers the more direct approach of simply killing people that get in their way.  The workers, like the young races, are stuck in the middle.  In practical terms, however, the reconstruction politics wander very far into wallbanger territory.  I've studied rebuilding strategies for wartorn societies and the resolution JMS wrote is about one of the worst approaches possible.  Taking a political entity (such as the worker caste) that has been chronically oppressed and putting them in a position of power over their historical oppressors (the warrior and religious castes) and leaving a power vacuum at the head of the polity does not result in good governance.  It results instead with revenge oppression equal or worse than the original crime.  The Rwandan genocide and the Israel-Islam conflict are perfect examples of what happens when someone tries this in the real world.   In JMS' world, putting the worker caste in control worked, but building that outcome from the circumstances depicted is just as much fictional as JMS' hyperspace and telepathy.  The Starfire leadership selection process wasn't the brightest bit of political world building, either.  Think through the results of a few iterations of Starfire-decided successions: the cowards will be alive but discredited and very angry, the patriots will all be dead, and the non-entities will be left standing to pick up the pieces.  The leadership class left behind would be something dominated by people like Shakiri and Lennier....  One wonders how much news of this process found its way back to Sheridan.  If this isn't enough to make Sheridan understand that Delenn deserves to be treated with a lot more respect then he really doesn't deserve her.  It's terribly convenient that EA didn't give Sheridan justification to borrow a bunch of Minbari ships to declare war on EA until after Minbar had a stable government again, isn't it?"
babylon5,e2p89,Tartantyco,3,Mon Nov 8 01:17:51 2010 UTC,"Epiphanies   Bester is such a great character.  I like how JMS wrote another part just for him after he was unavailable for another small part. So it would seem that Sheridan knew what Lyta was doing.  I keep forgetting about this event, but if Sheridan was inclined to help Lyta before, that relationship has completely broken down at this point.  It's kind of ironic in a way since she's the one being used by everyone like the Vorlons and Sheridan or whoever else. I really liked the rest of the ep, especially the light and festive mood that's been lacking in much of the series with everyone stressed out.   The Illusion of Truth   Wait!  So ISN is saying that Sheridan freezes people and does experiments on them to transform humans into Minbari.  So Delenn has shown him the way.  They can convert, so can we.  GENIUS! I liked some of the editing.  They should have done more of it.  It's hilarious.   Atonement   Delenn has a lot of skeletons in her closet. That Marcus bit made me laugh. Although not much to say, I think it addresses a lot of the issues with Delenn.  Specifically her guilt.  And also her background with the Earth Minbari war and with her ancestry.  But she still isn't being up front with Sheridan.  She did not even come up with an excuse when she came back.  She could have had other business on Minbar and said that.  Really weird.   Racing Mars   Weirdest ritual ever.  Even the Pak-Ma-Ra are going WTF? Garibaldi is being as pleasant as ever. There are keepers on Mars.  We already knew there was shadow influence.  But it now seems like the Shadow allies have taken over or something. For some reason, I rather enjoy these episodes that show different small pieces being developed."
babylon5,e2p89,Vorlath,1 point,Tue Nov 9 15:34:02 2010 UTC,"Really weird.   I don't think so.  What Delenn fears above all else is losing Sheridan.  She's too scared of losing him to ever let him find out what she did during the EM war because he might not forgive her.  If she tells him why she's going, he'll naturally want to help, either through violence (which she wouldn't want) or by coming with her and potentially finding out what she did (which she really doesn't want). She can't tell him anything because even the slightest hint could destroy the image of herself that she's cultivated in Sheridan's mind over the years.  Telling Sheridan anything would mean that Delenn was ready to admit fault for what she did and she's just not ready to do that.  Something tells me Sheridan wouldn't want to know what she's really capable of, either."

babylon5,e2p89,Vorlath,0,Tue Nov 9 23:27:44 2010 UTC,"It is really weird because she is letting Sheridan know that she is holding something back.   Unless she invents a story out of whole cloth, how could she slip off to Minbar without Sheridan knowing she's hiding something?  Sheridan is far from the sharpest knife in the drawer but ""I'm ... umm ... going on a 'business trip' ... no, you're not welcome ... no, I don't know when I'll be back"" isn't going to pass under his nose unquestioned. No matter how she answers the inevitable questions, he's going to know she's hiding something.   That usually indicates that they want to tell the other person, but aren't ready to do so yet.   I definitely think she wanted to tell him explicitly that this might be their last night together but she couldn't find a way to do it without running the risk of the conversation going into areas she didn't want to expose--with the attendant risk of needing to shut him down in ways that would end their last night in a fight.   If she really wanted to hide everything, she could have easily answered Sheridan when she came back without causing any doubt.   If she tells him a comforting pack of lies after she comes back, she'll have to explain why she didn't trust him enough to tell him what she was doing before she left.  Given that Sheridan's issue with her is trust, that's a huge new minefield itself.  I suppose she could have brought back some kind of very fancy surprise wedding present and told him she just went home to shop, but she'd need to square that story with the fact that she was clearly very unhappy to be leaving.  I don't think JMS really wanted to paint her as that manipulative, either.  The character is supposed to be deeply ambiguous and that's what she demonstrates here.  The fact that she cause this many unanswerable questions is why she's such a wonderful piece of work."

She's a leader of her caste (at least someone of stature).  She used to be in the Grey council.  Does she not have family there?  Yes, I know they are taken at a young age, but that doesn't mean she doesn't have something close to a family.  She's an ambassador.  There's plenty of stuff she could say without lying outright.  Instead, she specifically chose to let Sheridan know she was hiding something from him.  Maybe she's thinking if he doesn't press the issue, he doesn't really want to know.   I suppose she could have brought back some kind of very fancy surprise wedding present and told him she just went home to shop, but she'd need to square that story with the fact that she was clearly very unhappy to be leaving.  I don't think JMS really wanted to paint her as that manipulative, either.   Those are both good points.  I still think there's a way to do it without seeming manipulative.  No matter what, she's hiding something.  So it's not going to affect that part of her character."
babylon5,e2p89,Vorlath,1 point,Wed Nov 10 01:32:01 2010 UTC,"The only way I see she could have completely hidden the fact that she was hiding something without running into the trust minefield would be for her to have a story ready before she left. She's definitely smart enough to figure that out.  What might be a bit problematic, however, would be her delivering the story without breaking down emotionally as she indeed did when she told Sheridan she was going.  I'm not sure if she has the emotional self control to do that.  If she falls apart, the gambit would be up and she'll be caught in a lie and be in a worse position than if she said nothing.  It's certainly conceivable that she could have completely hidden what was going on, but I think she just found it easier/safer to clam up rather than say something and run the risk of getting caught out.  Delenn's fears of abandonment make her quite a coward when it comes to personal relationships."
babylon5,e2p89,vacant-cranium,1 point,Wed Nov 10 23:15:25 2010 UTC,"Racing Mars  JMS is really into voyeuristic sex scenes.  Playing it for laughs doesn't make it any less creepy.  Yuck.  Nasty thing for Lennier, too...  Everyone seems surprisingly calm about the revelation that somebody allied to EA is using invisible mind controlling parasites on members of the Mars resistance.  It's awfully hard to support the idea of overthrowing Clark's EA when even the supposed good guy factions are full of ignorant, bigoted, hotheads.  Why should the viewer care about what happens to Mars (or Earth, or any other part of EA) when, out of all humanity, only the station crew and the human rangers have ever been portrayed as having even the slightest shred of human decency?  Why isn't the station able to grow its own food?  There's certainly enough space on board for agriculture."

babylon5,e2p89,vacant-cranium,1 point,Mon Nov 22 10:21:50 2010 UTC,"Epiphanies  This is the point at which the series really starts to suck.  What authority does Sheridan have to take a White Star to ZHD as part of a deal with Bester?  The White Stars ultimately belong to some part of the Minbari government--presumably the religious caste--and were gifted to Sheridan for the purposes of fighting the Shadows.  Now that war is over, why does he still have authority to use them as part of his ongoing spat with EA/Clark?  That's not a war the religious caste has signed on to fight to any extent beyond protecting B5 from Clark--again in order to ensure the station could be used as a command base for the Shadow war.  Regardless of whether Sheridan fully remembers his flashforward or not, he's a complete and utter idiot for taking no steps whatsoever to figure out who the minions are, what they want, or where they're going.  He's got no reason to assume from first detection that they're intractably hostile so there's nothing to lose by calling for another ship and sending some redshirt to attempt a first contact.  Or, at the very least, he should have put out a warning to the rest of the galaxy about Shadow minions bearing gifts.  If he remembers his flashforward, he knows the horde will be a problem.  If he's forgotten, he'd need only half a brain to be suspicious enough to do something other than sit on his hands.  Either way, this should have been an 'oh hell' moment.  Shame on JMS for expecting us to accept that Sheridan is both competent enough to be respected and ignorant enough to let something this dangerous slip right under his nose almost completely unnoticed.  Notably absent in this episode is any discussion of where the principles want to go now the Shadow war is over.  Garibaldi has voted with his feet, of course, but no one else on the station seems to be recognizing the end of the Shadow war as a career and life altering moment.  Sheridan was motivated to fight the war first because the Shadows stuffed his first second wife in the fridge and then out of his love for Delenn--with a bit of civic duty thrown in.  Now he's won, what's driving him and what does he want to do next?  We don't know because JMS didn't bother to tell us.  Delenn fought the war because, as a creature of prophecy, she'd been preparing to do it for her entire life and because it was her actual official job as Ranger One.  Now that war is over, she's left with no more prophecies to follow, a formal role as a ambassador for a government that no longer exists, and command over a military order that has lost its raison d'être.  If that doesn't spell 'crisis of faith' then nothing does.  What's driving her now she's accomplished everything fate required and she has no more of Sinclair/Valen's prophecies to reenact?  Again, as with Sheridan, we don't know because JMS didn't bother to tell us.  Or, apparently, think that it was important.  For that matter, what about Ivanova, Lyta, Franklin, and the rest?  Garibaldi shouldn't be the only odd (sane) one out reevaluating his future.  The lack of appropriate character work to re-establish motivations immediately after the war was disappointing.  (P.S. any guesses if having sex in the shadow of a vanquished enemy's former capital is an ancient Minbari tradition?)"
babylon5,e2p89,vacant-cranium,1 point,Mon Nov 8 03:08:02 2010 UTC,"The Illusion of Truth  Clark's regime legitimates itself by fostering xenophobic, anti-alien, sentiment among the general population.  For some inexplicable reason, this means that Sheridan's first, last and only plan when one of Clark's minions shows up to do a propaganda hit job is to emphasize the centrality of various Minbari to his personal and professional lives. I can't imagine why this would end badly.  There's not a lot anyone can do in the face of malicious editing (just ask Acorn) but Sheridan gave ISN more then enough rope to hang himself even without editing shenanigans.  Why would Delenn say so much to ISN given that she's normally barely willing to open her mouth even if her life depends on it?  Note again the use of the right wing shibboleth about the media being evil.  JMS may not be a conservative in real life, but his writing makes a habit of using many, many right wing shibboleths.  Ironically, Garibaldi's comments on Sheridan are dead accurate even though he's portrayed by the episode as a traitor.  Is ISN/Clark trying to humiliate Delenn as part of a planned strategy or is JMS following his usual anvilicious ways and writing ISN as targeting Delenn as a means of proving that yes, dear viewer, they are indeed evil?"
babylon5,e2p89,vacant-cranium,1 point,Mon Nov 8 05:10:21 2010 UTC,"Atonement  This, for us Delenn fans, is a fun one.    Let there be no further doubt that Mira Furlan can act when she's given good material.  It's such a pity she didn't get more of it to work from....  (Season 5, I am looking at you.)  The framing used to uncover Delenn's history was creepy and contrived.  There's no prior evidence that S&D's relationship was illegal and the idea that Delenn would consent to be violated in a way that is worse than rape without making any attempt to out maneuver Calenn first seems dubious.  She broke the Grey Council with little more than the force of her own will.  Pushing down Calenn before she gets violated should not have been much of a problem for her.  JMS has an unfortunate habit of abusing his female characters in ways that have very misogynistic overtones--especially when one considers their ultimate dispositions at the end of the canon[1]--and the framing of Atonement is not an exception.  Delenn seems to take it for granted that she'll be having children.  Has she seen fit to discuss this with Sheridan?  Something tells me the answer to that is a very clear 'no.'  I realize this audience doesn't really appreciate lit-crit, but what follows is a lit-crit I wrote some time ago:  Delenn's culpability and guilt  The core revelation that Delenn was the last link in the chain that started the Human-Minbari war--and the implications that has for Delenn's motivations--is perhaps the single most heavily debated plot point in the B5 canon.  Many tens of thousands of words have been written on this point in the years since Atonement aired.  Delenn's personal responsibility is undeniably overstated.  While she clearly regards herself as personally to blame for starting the war, it is indisputable that responsibility for the EM war extends over a very large web of culpability that includes not just Delenn but the rest of the Grey Council, the warrior caste, EA, EF, the Centauri, and even the Vorlons.  The war started as a result of a very long chain of mistakes—the avoidance of any one would have resulted in a less traumatic first contact.  Delenn was a link in a chain, not the whole chain.  One must also question what Delenn expects from herself as a leader given the circumstances when she  voted to avenge Dukhat's death.  No one ought to expect a 20-something young adult who finds her mentor/father figure (or possible unrequited lover) dead after an unprovoked attack to stand down and do nothing if she has the power to avenge his loss with a single order.  No one in the B5 canon would do any better under the same circumstances.  It speaks to Delenn's arrogance that she completely blames herself for lacking the strength to stand against a tide so strong that no one could resist it.  What comes out of this episode and everything that surrounds it is the utter ambivalence about Delenn's guilt and possible redemption.  On the one hand, Delenn herself says, supported by the word of JMS, that she's personally responsible for starting the Earth-Minbari war.  On the other hand, Delenn does everything she can to avoid accepting moral culpability for what she did.  As far as she's concerned, she's responsible, but it was just a bad day at work—a 'moment of rage' and nothing more.  Nearly everything else we see about her in the series is set up to make us believe her version of events: Atonement takes place well after nearly all other discussion of the EM war and well after Delenn has been firmly established in the viewers' minds as one of the most selfless and unambiguously good characters in the canon.  This pattern is repeated after Atonement where everyone practically falls over themselves to comment on how perfect Delenn is.  From all appearances, JMS desperately wants us to believe that she had a bad day at work and nothing more.  Unfortunately for Delenn, a moment of grief-stricken rage doesn't explain away the entirety of her actions.  It does not explain awat her willingness to participate in the torture of Sinclair at the end of the EM war, years after Dukhat's death.  It does not explain away her complete and utter lack of introspection about the consequences of her decisions.  It does not explain away her complete inability to engage in any overt acts of contrition towards people who know what she's done.  It does not explain away the complete lack of evidence that she's actually learned something about the need to maintain a healthy separation between her personal feelings and her professional life.  It does not explain away Delenn's complete lack of appreciation of the need to take first contact situations carefully.  In short, while she does consider herself responsible, there's very scant evidence that she's actually sorry--or even understands why she should be.  Delenn seems to sleep very well at night for someone who considers herself personally responsible for starting a war with xenocidal intent.  That goes a lot deeper than just a bad day at work.  Where Delenn becomes a monster is in that she chooses to (wrongly) accept the entirety of the blame for the war but then proceeds to live with it in ways that very strongly suggest she's not entirely sorry about what she believes she did.  She believes she's responsible for every death in the war but cannot bring herself to apologize even to Lennier for her culpability in the death of his family on the Black Star.  She believes she's responsible for every death in the war but cannot bring herself to explain and apologize to the warrior caste for their losses.  She believes she's responsible for every death in the war but cannot bring herself to apologize to humanity—nor does she even seem to even consider the views of human survivors to be important.  These are not the choices of someone who is genuinely sorry over what she did.  These choices are are, at minimum, the choices of someone who is too much of a coward to take responsibility for her actions.    Delenn is very deeply torn over her culpability.  She certainly feels responsible, but she can't bring herself to feel sorry in a meaningful way.  Part of her perhaps wants to feel remorse for the entirety of what she did—and not just dismissing it as a moment of rage—but that's a leap she cannot take because it would mean admitting that she's just as fallible as anyone else.  Similarly, a large part of her sees her path to forgiveness though misusing Sheridan's love—as both Lennier and Calenn argue—but it's also hard not to think that part of her sees her path to redemption only through a heroic death in the service of others.  It is hard to explain her extreme willingness to sacrifice her life in other terms: part of her definitely wants to die to relieve her own pain of knowing that she is capable of genocide.  It is the ambiguities and complexities of Delenn that make her such a sophisticated character and these revelations make Atonement one of the best episodes of the series.  ** Further commentary on Atonement **  (Spoilers)  http://rivendellrose.livejournal.com/767122.html  http://hobsonphile.livejournal.com/146556.html  http://eye-of-a-cat.livejournal.com/27011.html  http://community.livejournal.com/b5_revisited/47975.html  http://4thofeleven.livejournal.com/67606.html  http://icepixie.livejournal.com/732348.html  http://eye-of-a-cat.livejournal.com/71703.html#cutid2  [1] Out of the B5 women, only Sakai has a good end--as Valen's wife.

babylon5,dzb8b,vacant-cranium,2,Mon Nov 1 09:28:33 2010 UTC,"I personally found the end of the Shadow war to be the least satisfying plot thread ending in scifi TV until the end of nBSG.  The premise of the two races as competing guardians was definitely good, but the execution of the ending was awful.  The Shadows and Vorlons were locked in an intractable conflict for at least a thousand years and yet they abandon their project and forgive each other for their conflict after little more than some mild criticism at the hands of their former proxies.  Proxies who, it must be said, reduce the representatives of the supposedly ancient civilizations to whining like children after pointing out the blindingly obvious fact that they'll have no one left to play with dominate if they destroy their client races.  This ending doesn't seem any more credible than a world where WWII came to an end after Ghandi made a speech so moving that it persuaded both the Allied and Axis leaders in the moral superiority of passive nonviolence.  People who are so deeply committed to an ideology that they will kill for it very, very rarely change their minds in the face of a single act of begging or moral suasion.  Getting committed ideologues to change their mind usually means bribing, blackmailing or killing them.  None of these options were valid at Corianna 6 because the Shadows and Vorlons were too powerful to overwhelm without reaching into some orifice and pulling out a very big deus ex machina.  Note also that the end of the Shadow war followed the typical B5 template for conflict resolution: somebody powerful fights/attacks somebody weaker until the stronger person sees weaker person's motives and is so awestruck by their moral clarity that they stop fighting.  Other examples: Sebastian vs. Delenn, Neroon vs. Marcus, Neroon vs. Delenn (fighting in the non-violent sense), Sheridan vs. Earthforce.  The first two examples make sense, but having the Shadows and Vorlons give up essentially after being overwhelmed by the moral clarity of Space Jesus Sheridan and his girlfriend seems somewhat....dubious.  As I see it, JMS wrote himself into a corner and had no other choice but to pull a contrived ending because the scenario he wrote was unwinnable.  Given where things stood at the end of TLN, it's probably not possible to write a more satisfying version of ITF that ends in victory--there's far too much path dependency at this point to go in a direction that doesn't look like an arse-pull.  The only ending for ITF that strikes me as plausible (barring extreme deus ex machina) given how the situation was set up would see the alliance fleet wiped out."
babylon5,dzb8b,vacant-cranium,1 point,Wed Nov 3 07:04:56 2010 UTC,"I see you point, despite your vacant cranium. It's actually a good point.  I disagree with you. I actually like the way it ended. The Shadows and the Vorlons initially stayed to let us grow. They acted as our parents, not as foreign countries locked in a war.  The Shadows and the Vorlons had philosophical differences but didn't fight each other.  They acted like 2 divorced parents, an over-controlling mother and a father who pushes his kids out the door to they may play with fire until they learn not to burn themselves.  The speech by Sheridan and Delenn was their wake up call. They care about the smaller races, until how the Allied and the Axis felt about Gandhi.  They weren't fighting to kill all of their children, only to each destroy those who had sided with the other parent without realizing it meant almost everybody.  They with drunk with self-righteousness and the speech made them realize that.   Plus, their own father, Lorian, was there to tell them : My grand-kids are right, it's our time to leave.  And their family ( the old ones) were also telling them : ""It's our time to leave"".  But, all that said, you are right, unless you accept that exactly this way (which I do), you will find it cheesy (which you do) and for very good reasons.  Several hints were dropped in the first 3 seasons that the ending of the Shadow war wouldn't be military but philosophical in nature.   The 3 edged sword analogy When you become obsessed with the enemy, you become the enemy Etc...   (Geez, I thought I had more examples in mind, but it's 6h00 AM in the morning and I am currently personally between episodes 4.17 and 4.18 with my family)."
babylon5,dzb8b,xauriel,1 point,Wed Nov 3 09:59:24 2010 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that a military solution would have been any better. The ending would indeed have been even worse if, for instance, Sheridan had walked into deus ex machina land and pulled out not Lorien but rather a can of whoop-ass on the scale of a Culture GOU. Ending the war on the basis of all three sides agreeing to disengage is by far a more mature ending than having everyone shoot it out.  What I don't buy is that the Shadows and Vorlons cared enough about the young races to stand down after a single wake-up call.  JMS didn't lay enough groundwork to suggest that the S&V cared enough about the YR to have any problem exterminating them.  Everything the S&V did throughout the canon up to that point suggested they regarded the YR as beneath contempt or as tools to use for their own sadistic enjoyment.  There was not enough 'this is for your own good' foreshadowing for a turn from 'impudence' and destroying entire planets to leaving the field after a stern talking to to be, as I see it, credible.  As I see the S&V political positions by the time of ITF, they're both so drunk on power that they'd both scream 'impudence,' destroy the alliance fleet, and carry on fighting until the galaxy was depopulated.  Neither party seemed to have the basic morality to see this as wrong.  Without that moral base, there's nothing for Space Jesus (or Lorien) to connect with to convince the S&V to stand down.  My main beef with the ending is that it was pulled out of nowhere with no prior indication that either the Shadows or Vorlons were open to a non-violent settlement.  If the groundwork was there, then I'd have no problem accepting ITF as a well done resolution to a serious conflict.  Without the foreshadowing groundwork, though, it's an arse-pull and a very bad case of talking Cthulhu to death."
babylon5,dzb8b,vacant-cranium,3,Thu Nov 4 02:31:36 2010 UTC,"Sorry to take so long on this batch; I've been extremely busy and extremely sleep deprived lately.  I'll try to get through them before Monday at least.  ""The Summoning"":   There's a whole lot of plot crammed into this one, and I do mean 'crammed'.  Too much is happening without proper development or foreshadowing.  I honestly felt a bit cheated by Sheridan's big rousing return; I mean, we didn't even get to see him get off Z'Ha'Dum!  The big peace rally alone should have had an episode to itself, a chance for Delenn and Blue Guy to really argue their cases, rather than a two-minute exchange where Delenn, an experienced diplomat and politician, seemed to be floundering on the most basic points.  On the other side of things, I like Wortham Krimmer as Emperor Cartagia more every minute he's on the screen.  He's just such a bastard.  It's interesting how completely Londo's attitude has changed, while his essential motivations remain perfectly in sync; it's all a completely logical outgrowth of his established character, which I really appreciate - characters in this series tend to have somewhat, shall we say, erratic motivations. Speaking of spotty motivations... now, I get that Ivanova is a proud woman.  She's also career military, and by all accounts competent.  She really wouldn't have even tried to go out on a major mission knowing that her Minbari is absolute shit.  It really is not like her to have that big of a blind spot regarding her own capabilities. Sheridan is gone.  Ivanova is gone.  Garibaldi is gone.  Who's in command of B5?  Delenn?  Where exactly does she fit into the chain of command?  Head of the Rangers?  Since when did all of the ex-Earthforce personnel on B5 get inducted into the Rangers?  Or did she receive a commission in the B5 bridge crew too, while we weren't looking? I fracking love G'Kar's S&M jester outfit.  Despite how implausible it seems that jesters on Centauri would look just like jesters in Europe in the middle ages.  I need to make me one of those. Sigh, Londo and Vir, once again speaking loudly about conspiring to kill the Emperor in public places.  And on that note, yes, I understand that it's necessary for Londo to be able to talk freely with G'Kar to advance teh plot; but realistically, how could he know G'Kar's cell isn't bugged? Wow, New Kosh is a great big douchebag. Why the hell are Ivanova and Marcus looking out the damn window?  What happened to the awesome Minbari super-waterfall-viewscreen? Garibaldi has every right to be suspicious of Lorien - not to mention Sheridan, who just came back from Z'Ha'Dum.  Who else do we know that's done that?  Morden, the fixer.  Anna, the traitor.  At the very least, Sheridan should be absolutely open with everyone in his inner circle about absolutely everything.  I also, were I one of the people in that room, would not necessarily be buying the whole 'the Vorlon-Shadow war is really just a big difference of opinion' angle that Sheridan is pushing now.  As a viewer, I appreciate the increasing complexity and subtlety; but the characters have spent the last 2 seasons watching the shadows get built up as pure evil in a half-pipe.  I feel like it would take a hell of a lot more convincing than this to bring them around to the idea that things are more complicated than that.   ""Falling Towards Apotheosis"":   This, on the other hand, is a very nice piece.  B5 is at its best when it stays focused.  I loved the effect of the constant war bulletins, with Ivanova matter-of-factly reciting lists of planets that have been destroyed.  It adds a palpable feeling of futility and dread to the proceedings.  The performances given here were for the most part bang-on.  Nicely done. I did like the kill scene with Old Kosh and New Kosh fighting, but I still question how easily a bunch of apes were able to bamboozle a being with the knowledge and power of a god.  I'll just go ahead and assume that Lorian was using his first-one mojo to cloud New Kosh's powers. 20 years?  They only get 20 years together?  What a... reasonable amount of time for two people to spend together.  Altogether, hugely not a fan of the proposal scene.  In which an actual proposal did not happen, btw.  Call me old fashioned but I think it's kind of polite to actually ask the woman you're getting engaged to if she, you know, will marry you. Also... 'We could die 2 days from now'?  Actually, no, Sheridan.  You know the two of you will at least live to see the end of the Shadow War and the fall of Centauri, and Londo as an old geezer, and have a kid.  You know this. Cheeky Londo, trying to manipulate a lunatic with the power of life and death.  I loved the final scene, the cell door just swinging shut and then fade to black.  Perfect.   ""The Long Night"":   Absolutely brilliant.  This is the way it should work - resolve a major plot point in one arc while setting up the next major plot point in the opposing arc, then repeat.  In addition to the truly amazing assassination scene, there are a few really nice character pieces here - Ivanova and Sheridan, Londo and G'Kar, Londo and Vir, G'Kar refusing to take control of Narn. Conspiracy sure looks good on Vir.  In the stifling social world of the Centauri aristocracy, he was nothing, but he has not only grown a lot wiser being immersed in Londo's plotting; being an integral part of a small group where rank means next to nothing and everyone must implicitly trust the others lets that wisdom be heard.  His becoming emperor is not looking nearly so implausible anymore.  Alas, though it was poetic to have Vir kill Cartagia, I still feel sorry for him.  Poor Vir. I also like how reluctantly Londo takes power after Cartagia is killed.  He knows he has to, but he can see where it's going - straight down prophecy road - and he doesn't like it. I'm not too happy with Lennier's extremely important tactical information being played for laughs.  And since when do people interrupt each other in the war council?  Sheridan, at the very least, knows better than this. No!  Not Ericsson!  Anyone but Ericsson!  I gotta say - despite being a throwaway red shirt, Bryan Cranston does an able job portraying Ericsson and making him someone I liked and cared about at least a bit.   ""Into the Fire"":   Well.  That was... abrupt.  I really feel like there was a pacing problem here. On the other hand, I can't tell you how happy I am to see the back end of Lorian.  Also, I'm having a bit of difficulty with the whole 'the first first ones were born immortal but then the universe decided it couldn't be having with that' theory of devolution.  That does not strike me as particularly plausible. Where, exactly, do we go from here again?"
babylon5,dzb8b,Vorlath,3,Sun Nov 7 05:55:42 2010 UTC,"Sheridan is gone. Ivanova is gone. Garibaldi is gone. Who's in command of B5?   David Corwin in charge of this shit motha'! Sheeeeeeet, he be pimpin' yo!  Actually, I have no clue. Most likely Delenn as the security council(or whatever) is basically their government right now since the secession.  I was also a little disappointed at how the Shadow War plot unraveled, I think a lot of it had to do with squashing 2 seasons worth of material into 1, though. Still, having the Vorlons and Shadows basically regress into infants during their last scene was quite awkward."
babylon5,dzb8b,mpierre,1 point,Sun Nov 7 06:25:56 2010 UTC,"According to JMS (who could be a lying bastard who doesn't know what he's talking about but I suspect might actually have some idea what was going on) the plan was always to end the shadow war early in season 4, and the EA civil war would last til roughly the first quarter of season 5 - leaving what we got in season 5 more or less intact.  So, while it is true that the plot was compressed a bit, it's not exactly like several decades of TV was squished into half a dozen episiodes."
babylon5,dzb8b,Vorlath,1 point,Mon Nov 8 00:53:57 2010 UTC,"Who's in command of B5? Delenn? Where exactly does she fit into the chain of command? Head of the Rangers? Since when did all of the ex-Earthforce personnel on B5 get inducted into the Rangers? Or did she receive a commission in the B5 bridge crew too, while we weren't looking?   These are the kind of questions you really shouldn't ask. :)  Presumably, Delenn has her hands full at the moment with her day job.  Unless B5 has an unnamed and never seen 3rd in command, the station is very likely leaderless.   Delenn, an experienced diplomat and politician, seemed to be floundering on the most basic points.   ...   I also, were I one of the people in that room, would not necessarily be buying the whole 'the Vorlon-Shadow war is really just a big difference of opinion' angle that Sheridan is pushing now.   I think a lot of that can be pithily addressed by saying that Ivanova and Delenn lost at least 25 IQ points--and most of their professional skills--after Shadow Dancing.  Professional cynic Ivanova--of seasons 1-3--ought to have been at least as suspicious of Sheridan as Garibaldi was. Nor would professional officer Ivanova be willing to command a White Star given that poor language skills could get her killed very, very easily even through comparatively trivial hazards like flying the ship into a rock, much less combat risks....  Delenn's professional implosion has been going on in slow motion ever since she was impeached from the Grey Council--as if her leadership skills came with the job rather than vice-versa.  Being reduced to making pathetically weak arguments from the middle of a mob that was on the verge of lynching her, however, was a pretty abrupt drop even from her season 3 skill set.  Meekly accepting Sheridan's story without as much as a privately raised (metaphorical) eyebrow, despite the fact that a) she knows the Shadows can make Anna-like zombies, b) she doesn't fully trust anyone and c) his tale goes against everything she's been indoctrinated to believe about the Shadows for her entire life just adds insult to injury.  Apparently, both Ivanova and Delenn lost their basic professional competence and established character traits in the same place Delenn lost her gravity rings: down a hole marked 'plot inconvenience.'  I suppose one could say that Lorien (and/or the Kosh fragment in Sheridan's mind) was using telepathic manipulation to make everyone else believe Sheridan but this, if true, should have been explicitly stated.   I still question how easily a bunch of apes were able to bamboozle a being with the knowledge and power of a god.   It's no different from Ivanova being able to manipulate a First One with trivial mind games.  One underlying message of B5 is that humans are superior to all other life, even life millions of years older.  White mans burden, anyone?   Call me old fashioned but I think it's kind of polite to actually ask the woman you're getting engaged to if she, you know, will marry you.   IIRC, wasn't Delenn watching Sheridan sleep essentially the opening step of a Minbari engagement anyway?  Sheridan is largely offering what Delenn has more or less asked for already.  Mind you, politeness and maturity aren't exactly hallmarks of S&D's relationship.  If one tallies up all the times that either of them do things that should be dumping offenses you'll get a number that approaches perhaps half the number of personal scenes S&D have together.   Also... 'We could die 2 days from now'? Actually, no, Sheridan. You know the two of you will at least live to see the end of the Shadow War and the fall of Centauri, and Londo as an old geezer, and have a kid.   Word of JMS is that Sheridan believes he's averted that future by going to ZHD.  It was very amusing to see JMS make increasingly pathetic excuses for why Sheridan completely disregarded his flashforward as it became ever more painfully obvious that Sheridan's memories of the event had fallen down another hole marked 'plot inconvenience.'"
babylon5,dzb8b,vacant-cranium,2,Sun Nov 7 19:15:12 2010 UTC,"The Summoning   Soooo... when does Sheridan walk on water?  I think it's a continuity error that he doesn't. I like those Vorlon ships.  I wanted to see more. I thought it worked ok, but perhaps a different person should have shown an expression when Sheridan walked out.  Heck, even Zack would have been more fitting.  I don't mind Garibaldi doing it, but he just got back himself. Lyta is really being fucked around. Poor G'Kar.  Every time he has to humble himself, there's another bigger sacrifice right around the corner.   Falling Toward Apotheosis   I didn't really get the Kosh fight, but that's ok. I liked this episode.  But not much to say on it overall.  Just more pieces coming together.   Falling Toward Apotheosis   This episode had me hooked from beginning to end. It was hard for me to imagine that when we first saw Vir in B5 that he'd have such character development. I really liked what G'Kar said at the end.  They just removed one emperor.  Would they put another so soon?  I don't know how an entire civilization could let go of the revenge though.  It's symbolic of what happens here on Earth all the time (with revenge). And then there's the shadow war.  It's coming to end.  Too bad JMS didn't get his 5 seasons like he wanted right away.  The entire fourth season was supposed to be the shadow war.  But he only found out later and had to wrap things up this season.   Into The Fire   The only thing I'll say is that I'm impressed at how the Centauri plot had me drawn in just as much as the war.   I noticed two things that may be coincidence.  When Cartagia told Londo that he had G'Kar's chains replaced, it seemed like his chained were already separated.  So what's the official story?  Did G'Kar break the bonds on good chains through sheer force and will, or did even Cartagia's guards not listen to him.  Perhaps, Londo's guards found out and weakened them again.  We never hear of it again, but I think it's an important point.  edit: JMS says: That was one determined Narn.  Another coincidence is the Vorlons leaving Centauri Prime.  Did Londo do enough or did they leave because they got called back as reinforcements?  Or both?  Probably one of those things we'll never know for sure."
babylon5,dzb8b,Vorlath,1 point,Tue Nov 2 18:44:00 2010 UTC,"I don't mind Garibaldi doing it,   You'll see why in the future episodes.   Lyta is really being fucked around.   Don't you think that perhaps they should take better care of poor Lyta ?   Poor G'Kar. Every time he has to humble himself, there's another bigger sacrifice right around the corner.   Yeap."
babylon5,dzb8b,vacant-cranium,1 point,Wed Nov 3 10:00:46 2010 UTC,"You'll see why in the future episodes.   I've watched the entire series multiple times.  I don't see anything in the future that would change anything.  Sure, it's possible that Garibaldi's captors believed Sheridan to be dead.  But still, I would have preferred someone else to picture a reaction.  Garibaldi just came back himself."
babylon5,dzb8b,Vorlath,1 point,Wed Nov 3 13:08:00 2010 UTC,Another coincidence is the Vorlons leaving Centauri Prime. Did Londo do enough or did they leave because they got called back as reinforcements?   The Vorlons pulled back to reenforce their fleet at C6.
babylon5,dzb8b,vacant-cranium,1 point,Fri Nov 5 21:34:49 2010 UTC,"We know they turned around after they passed by Centauri Prime.  But did they leave Centauri Prime alone because they were told to come back right away, or was Centauri Prime clean?  The fact that they left tells us nothing if Centauri Prime was clean of shadow influence or not (to the Vorlons' satisfaction)."
babylon5,dzb8b,vacant-cranium,1 point,Sun Nov 7 05:31:34 2010 UTC,"It's strange that everyone on the station accepts Sheridan's return as Space Jesus at face value given the Shadows ability to reconstruct people to suit their purposes.  Everyone was suspicious of Anna Sheridan and Garibaldi, but for some reason Jesus John Sheridan was immediately accepted as the second coming without as much as a second thought.  The Vorlon planet killer was an artistic embarrassment for production TV.  Presumably, the show blew its budget on battle FX and didn't have the money to design a ship that looked half decent.  Speaking of VFX errors, where did all those Starfuries come from in ITF?  EF is on the other side of the war.  We should have seen some arguments about whether it would have been a good idea to delay the showdown until after the Vorlons had exterminated the Centauri.  An awful lot of the league would have been very happy to see the Centauri wiped out--and for very, very, good reason.  So should Sheridan, for that matter.  If there was intelligence that the Vorlons were aiming to give the Centauri their just reward for all the suffering they intentionally caused, there should have been a lot of pushback from the league against any plan that would let the Centauri live.  Sacrificing a redshirt no one has ever heard of as a means of demonstrating that the situation requires desperate measures was hardly the brightest act of B5 writing.  If a writer wants that kind of twist to have some emotional punch, they've got to kill someone the audience already cares about.  Given how important Lorien was to resolving the pseudo-battle in ITF, you'd think Sheridan would have planned to bring Lorien to the showdown, rather than have him show up essentially by accident as a result of Sheridan keeping a personal promise to Ivanova.  (Yes, I know Lorien and Ivanova's detour to B5 was due to a production error.)  Delenn gets up to a lot of stupid stuff in these episodes.  ""And you, they have left for us"" was a beautifully dismissive way to drive home the point that she's fallen from being the brains of the operation to being Sheridan's not-too-bright follower and love interest.  It's surprising that Clarke didn't go on a territorial grab while everyone else was busy at Corianna 6.  At minimum, retaking B5 would have been dead easy while the Minbari were otherwise occupied.  Note how much hope S&D had for the future on their way back from Coriana 6 to B5 -- and watch in the future how all of this is stripped from them.  Heartbreaking."
babylon5,dzb8b,Vorlath,2,Wed Nov 3 06:16:06 2010 UTC,"Presumably, the show blew its budget on battle FX and didn't have the money to design a ship that looked half decent.   You have to understand something. US Sci-fi TV show go over budget most of the weeks.  TNG had something 1.3 million dollar per episode but spent almost 10 million dollar on the 2 parter episode ""Reunification"" (or was it Redemption ?) about the Klingons.  The way they did it was on future royalties borrowing.   If you show makes 1.5 millions per episode in ad revenu and you want to keep 200,000$ in profit, your budget is 1.3 million.  But the show will run in reruns and yield a lot more in the future.   TNG and DS9 both both royalties borrowing: Paramount lent them money from future reruns and DVD-sales to allow some episodes to go over budget.  Most sci-fi TV shows did that. In fact, almost all of them.  Babylon 5 didn't a single penny in royalties advance from Warner Brother. and as such, Babylon 5 didn't get a single episode over budget.  When an episode costed more than their budget, they had to take the money from a cheaper episode in the same season.  And for the kicker : TNG, made before B5 got 1.3 million per episode and frequently went overboard for special episodes.  For season 1-4, B5 got only 900,000$, meaning that it only got 19 millions and 800,000$ per season.  That includes sets, actors, fx, etc...  The 2 parter Reunification (or Redemption) alone of TNG was half of that.   you'd think Sheridan would have planned to bring Lorien to the showdown   It was planned. It was in fact essential to his plan."

babylon5,dw7je,xauriel,1 point,Fri Oct 29 03:49:08 2010 UTC,"Perhaps a poor choice of words.  I'll hardly deny that he planned the plot arc of this series in considerably more detail than anything which came before.  Unfortunately, the writing still displays a lot of episodic style conceits which I feel detract from the overall pacing of the series, and the slow start to each season is IMO symptomatic of that.  It's something I hardly fault him for, considering how visionary what he was doing was at the time, but I can't help but see things from the perspective of the considerably more smoothly plotted series I've had the pleasure of watching since."
babylon5,dw7je,Vorlath,1 point,Fri Oct 29 07:29:46 2010 UTC,"I still haven't seen anything that compares.  What series would you suggest?    Also, the studios were forcing JMS' hand at every turn to make B5 more episodic.  That was one of the requirements for his next series, Crusade.  He actually contemplated quitting at many points during the B5 series.  He's outright refused to comply with many requests and almost got fired.  He's talked about ways to word things to the execs so that they would end up changing their minds.  Don't be so hard on the guy until you know all the details.  Also, at the time, no one planned 5 years series.  It was batshit insane and everyone kept reminding him of this.  I remember him once saying that the intro eps to each season actually killed his ratings, but it was the only way to keep the execs satisfied.  But the results would back him up and he'd be more free to do what he wants near the end of the season."
babylon5,dw7je,xauriel,2,Fri Oct 29 22:48:46 2010 UTC,"Again, I'm not sure that what you're hearing is what I'm saying.  There are numerous series over the past decade or so which took the stylistic approach which JMS was primarily for responsible for developing in this series (along with a very few other vanguard productions like Hill Street Blues) and built on the same approach to create a much more integrated technique for dealing with multiple ongoing, long-term plot arcs instead of the traditional 'complete story, unchanging backdrop' episodic style which network television has fostered over the last several decades.  Off the top of my head, Lost, Battlestar Galactica, The Sopranos, and Weeds have all used this continuing-storyline approach to great effect.  And before you launch into how much better B5 is than any of these other shows, please make note once again that this is not the argument I'm making.  Whatever the overall merits and flaws of the storytelling of for instance BSG are in comparison to B5, I think it's clear that on an episode-to-episode basis the ongoing plot arcs of BSG are developed much more smoothly and continuously than in B5, simply because one series was produced after the other, was influenced by the style of writing developed in the other, and was able to take advantage of developments in storytelling technique that were developed long after the other aired.  You really don't have to defend the holy writ of JMS to me.  I have stated repeatedly that I consider B5 to be one of the best sci-fi TV series ever produced.  But you have to acknowledge, at the very least, that the cultural universe continued to evolve after it ended its run.  As to the pressure he was under from the executives, I have no doubt of this and I take your word for it.  That doesn't change the facts on the ground: the series is just not as good as it could have been if, let us say, the great planning that JMS engaged in could have been used to its full advantage."
babylon5,dw7je,Vorlath,1 point,Sat Oct 30 06:14:10 2010 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, I don't think you realize just how big of an insult that is.  JMS had to work within the confines of what would work in the 90's and fought very hard for 5 years just to get it on the air.  Knowing what we know now, would it be possible to do a better job?  Yeah, CGI is cheaper now.  He could have had a better makeup crew in season 1.  He could have ditched the episodic stuff entirely.  He could have done many thing.  But would it have been a success?  I say NO WAY IN HELL.  I watched most of it during its original airing.  There was a Trek revolt over the show, which at that time was 100% episodic.  It was seen as a traitorous move to watch both shows.  People say DS9 and B5 are very similar.  In fact, JMS pitched his idea to Paramount a few years earlier with full info for 22 episodes.  Next thing you know, DS9 comes out a few months before B5.  Both B5 and DS9 were pretty bad in the first season.  Episodic stuff was known territory.  Doing an full arc was very anti-trek and very risky.  But it was JMS' plan all along.  But he wasn't stupid either.  You talk about BSG.  That's the same writer from DS9.  I really liked the Sopranos as well.  While that show certainly had an arc, it was more the extreme nature of it that pulled people in.  Almost every show, someone died.  And BSG's entire first half of season 4 we could have done without.  There was plenty of episodic stuff during the entire run of all these shows.  About the episodic stuff on B5, seems I was in error.  It was season 1 and 5 that he had some pressure along with Crusades which ended up cancelling the show.  He had full creative freedom for seasons 2 to 4.  And those were the best seasons.  It's easy to say it could have been better in retrospect, but it doesn't mean it's true.  BTW, I'm not a terribly big fan of the episodic stuff.  But I see absolutely no way that B5 could have been on the air at all if it was full on arc from the beginning."
babylon5,dw7je,xauriel,2,Sat Oct 30 06:52:16 2010 UTC,"Whoah, whoah, whoah!  Back it up!  You need to take the time to read what I'm writing a bit more thoroughly and try to check your emotions a bit.  (This seems to happen on a regular basis.  I strongly suggest you invest the time.)  What I am specifically saying is that the writing constraints JMS was working under, whatever their source might be, led to the series not being as good as it potentially, in a perfect world, could have been.  I am fully aware of the stupid fan-cult bullshit that was happening around that time.  (My wife, to this day, refuses to watch B5 because of the way B5 fans were ostracized from her circle of friends during the show's original run, not to mention the insanely cultish way a lot of B5 fans reacted.)  I am fully aware of the kind of risks JMS was taking with his career.  Once again, you do not have to defend the man or the series to me.  It is one of the best TV series ever made.  I am speaking from a purely idealistic viewpoint here.  I'm not intending to insult anyone or anything here.  It's not an insult to state that something is more advanced, from a technical standpoint, than something else that it was influenced by.  Remember it was what JMS did with B5 that paved the way for later continuous-arc series like Lost and BSG to even exist.  That's not an insult, if anything, it's proper respect.  I really don't think it's fair to me to be engaging in a purely technical literary analysis and suddenly get blindsided like this.  You need to calm down."
babylon5,dw7je,Vorlath,1 point,Sat Oct 30 10:37:55 2010 UTC,"Check my emotions?  Just because I disagree with you doesn't mean I'm emotionally invested.  I apologize if it came out otherwise, but I assure you that your response has taken me by surprise.  I was very relaxed when I wrote my response and thought it was actually too long for how dry it was.  First paragraph was about how it could be different.  Second is what happened during the airing.  Third and fourth is about what was at stake getting the show on the air.  And the 5th is about how I was wrong on the creative freedom that JMS had on B5.  Aside from the first sentence and one bold place where I say NO WAY IN HELL, I don't see any emotional involvement at all.  I was just trying to convey clearly my opinion, nothing more.  Go read my message again.  I don't see it.  I think the Internet plays games on how we perceive things.  Sorry if it came out too strong, but I again assure you there was no emotions involved and did not write it with the intention of conveying any emotions.  About the argument, I'm disagreeing with you that B5 would be better today or in a perfect world.  That's the whole point.  That's why I think it's an insult to JMS.  I believe that restrictions and obstacles actually help a show.  I think a show like that today would end up with a waterworld version of B5.  There are things in the show I did not like to be sure.  I did not like how Patricia Tallman could not come to an agreement and was left out of the show in the first several seasons.  I like her character a lot.  I don't think this would be any different today.  It happened with other actors too like Sinclair.  Today, would the show even get past season 1?  Certainly not on FOX.  WB and UPN don't exist.  It's the CW now and that's a difficult channel to get anything going.  In a perfect world, sure.  But we can't realistically use that as an argument when the facts on the ground don't allow for it in any time period.  Would leaving out the episodic parts help?  Maybe.  But hindsight isn't always 20/20.  I do believe it would have been better if he were given the 5 seasons he originally wanted instead of wrapping everything up at the end of the fourth after which he was told that another season was granted by TNT giving us the season 5 that we have.  I don't argue that.  But at the same time, we're not there yet.  All in all, aside from certain technical aspects and logistics, I don't think B5 would be better today.  I keep thinking of the moon landing.  For JMS, there was a personal vested interest in seeing it succeed.  It was the first 5 year sci-fi arc at a time when Trek was king.  We haven't gone to the moon since the 60's.  Could we do it better today?  Maybe.  But the way it was done was totally badass if you've ever looked at how ridiculously primitive everything was.  Every single bit of the ROM for the computers were actually woven by hand.  They had push buttons and switches that could cause a fire if it sparked.  I could go on and on.  All of that is something that would never be recreated today.  I really do believe that the time in which B5 was produced made it the show it was.  I don't think the show would be better at all today.  I think it would be a completely different show not comparable to the original.  Apologies for the length.  Wanted to try and be extra clear.  edit: There's another quick point I'd like to make.  Things are never the same as when you're actually there the first time.  Is the Trek reboot better than the original?  A lot of people sure think so.  But most of those people weren't around during the first original run.  Neither was I, but I was around for the movies.  The Wrath of Khan is still my favourite trek movie.  I also like First Contact.  Could the original series have been done better?  Maybe.  But the time and place when and where it was produced was the catalyst that enabled everything that come later.  When you say B5 could have been done better, to me, you're ignoring what made the show what it is.  As proof, need we look further than Star Wars?"

babylon5,dw7je,mpierre,1 point,Fri Oct 29 23:34:48 2010 UTC,"Not off hand.  This was mid to end of 90's after all.  However, just to give you an idea.  JMS and the execs couldn't agree on the characters direction of Crusade.  This is after the existing episodes were shot, but before any of them aired.  JMS decided to hold his ground.  The execs decided the show JMS was doing wasn't what they wanted (TnA in space), so they stopped the funding.  The show was cancelled before it even aired.  http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Crusade  Here's some more notes on that at lurker's guide.  http://www.ntua.gr/lurk/guide/113.html  And the quality of the B5 movies after the series ended was because of low budget.  WB wanted more movies, but with the same budget.  JMS said no way because it would hurt the B5 ""franchise"" more than anything else.  He did those in the hopes that a successful DVD would mean a bigger budget for the next one.  Didn't happen.  He said he'd only write another B5 story if it was made into a full featured film with an appropriate budget.  It'll never happen.  Plus, there are critical actors who are no longer with us.  Even so, I think JMS could pull it off.  edit: I have to stand corrected on the episodic stuff.  It was season 1 and 5 of B5.  JMS basically had creative freedom in seasons 2 through 4.  These are the best seasons.  It seems it really was JMS' decision to start off on a lower key at the start of seasons.  And really, considering the amount of sci-fi shows that have lasted 5 years, I'm not in a position to blame him.  Here's a nice interview you may want to read.  There are other sections where he talks about other stuff he's done.  http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035906p1.html"
babylon5,dw7je,xauriel,2,Sat Oct 30 05:42:08 2010 UTC,"Unfortunate consequence of a lack of thorough planning.   I am not sure. JMS on a few occasions said it was voluntary.  If you want a crescendo of interest over 5 seasons, you have 2 choices :  You have a constant crescendo, so that each episode is better than the previous ones.  By the time you reach Z'ha'dum, it has to be the best of 66 episodes, and the next season premiere needs to top those 66 episodes.  The 4th season finale thus needs to top 88 episodes, etc...  The other option is to build smaller arcs which are in themselves crescendos.  So, in Season 4, you have :  4.01 < 4.02 < 4.03 < 4.04 < 4.05 < 4.06 > 4.07  You see that reduction post episode 6 ? That's to help setup the next arc. You use a more emotional and less intense episode.  Now, if you factor in the previous season :  3.20 < 3.21 < 3.22 >>> 4.01 < 4.02 < 4.03 < 4.04 < 4.05 < 4.06  So yeah, you have a big reduction between 3.22 and 4.01  If you watch them in order, you feel it strongly.  But in reality, there was close to 5 months in pause between them so you don't feel it that much."
babylon5,dw7je,xauriel,1 point,Thu Oct 28 12:16:07 2010 UTC,"Perhaps so.  I wouldn't necessarily say that every episode has to be better than the last.  I feel it would be possible to start out each season on a strong note, while not necessarily having to 'top' the finale.  This is where devices like ending the season on a cliffhanger to maintain tension come in handy; it's handled skillfully in modern continuous-plot series like Lost, but B5 is right on the transition line between episodic and continuous series, and JMS is in uncharted territory here and working out some of these issues on the fly.  You make a good point about there being much more lede time between seasons originally than we give ourselves here; personally I'm having difficulty deciding whether that would mollify the problem or exacerbate it."
babylon5,dw7je,alsace81,3,Thu Oct 28 15:45:41 2010 UTC,"""Shadow Dancing"":   The combat scenes were well done, but honestly it got a bit old after a while.  I get it.  They're fighting.  And having nothing but Franklin's big climactic psychological struggles to cut away to doesn't help matters.  Especially since Franklin is a huge douchebag, even when he's lying bleeding to death on the floor. Seriously, Doctor?  You just barge in and yell at a couple of downbelow thugs, and then try to reason with them?  What the hell did you think was going to happen?  Getting knifed and left for dead was about the best outcome to expect from that kind of malarkey! I was also pretty unimpressed with the Minbari 'marriage custom'.  To this point, I don't think there has been any real sociological differentiation between Minbari males and females presented; I had hoped that it was a complete non-issue.  I mean, what, don't Minbari husbands get to see their bride's 'true face' before marrying them?  Not to mention, it just plain sounds retarded. Again with the not telling the damn fleet admiral how his equipment works!  Maybe you wouldn't have lost quite so many ships if Sheridan wasn't standing around staring in awe at the Minbari command centre! God, am I happy that Doctor Franklin's little after-school special is over.  I've had about all the uplifting drivel I can take. WTF is with the snowglobe?  That seems like a pretty odd, out-of-character thing for Sheridan to have in his quarters.   ""Z'Ha'Dum"":   Beautiful.  I can think of very few ways to improve on this episode.  The way so many plot points have led inevitably to this conclusion.  The way Old Delenn's attempt to change the past ended up directly causing what she was trying to prevent.  The way each decision leads inevitably to the next.  Ending, once again, with a host of questions unanswered.  This really is B5 at its best. Undetectable fusion bombs, though.  How very convenient.  Yeah. Again, we see how Sheridan's obsession with Anna is essentially pathological.  She's pretty obviously not the woman he married, and he's still willing to hear her out; and again, he takes his suppressed anger out on Delenn, the closest target.  The idea that just maybe following Old Delenn's warning was what caused the Fall of Centauri in the first place is quite frankly a thin reed to base the decision to essentially walk into your own suicide on.  I'm pretty sure that at this point, Sheridan was still clinging to the faint hope that he could get his wife back. I found the 'Shadow Philosophy' very intriguing, and it actually appeals to me quite a bit as a philosophy.  There's just one problem: it's based on a fundamental misunderstanding of evolution.  Greater complexity comes only with greater organization and cooperation.  When there's nothing but conflict and disaster, all you get is the Red Queen Hypothesis: running forever just to stay in the same place.   ""The Hour of the Wolf"":   And of course the season begins with a full episode's worth of housekeeping.  There are a few things to like in this episode - the whole 'the Emperor is insane' bit, the fulfillment of the next sequence of Londo's prophecy, Radiaoctive Morden, and a fairly well-drawn portrait of some of the characters dealing with their grief - but not much. I know it was completely inappropriate, but seeing Morden picking flakes of skin off and 'distributing' them in Londo's quarters nearly made me laugh out loud.  And at the end of the scene, the lingering shot of Morden's skin flakes blowing in teh breeze nearly set me off again.  Other than that, though, a great scene; super-creepy. So Zach Allen sees the door of Garibaldi's quarters open.  He goes in.  He sees G'Kar standing there, wearing Garibaldi's hat.  And he, for some reason, lowers his gun and relaxes.  Personally, I think I'd be more freaked out by this, not less. I absolutely hated the Chamberlain character, right up until his last scene after Cartagia's big reveal, at which point I absolutely loved him. Wait, ""We can send the White Star""?  The White Star just got blown up by thermonuclear bombs!  Did they just designate a new ship to be the White Star?  Did someone get a bit mixed up?   ""Whatever Happened to Mr. Garibaldi?"":   A slow starter, but I really liked this episode by the end.  There was a remarkable amount of significant plot development going on in this episode, and it was accomplished efficiently without feeling rushed or squeezed.  I think Londo and G'Kar's scene in the dungeon cell was one of the best I've seen in the series so far. Just in case you missed that season premiere and last season's finale, here's a recap of what's going on courtesy of Doctor Stephen Franklin, who is still kind of a douchebag - for the sake of medicine! - despite no longer being a workaholic junkie.  Seriously, something tells me that showing that video to Delenn did not have quite the effect that Franklin was going for.  A xeno-surgical genius he may be, but a psychiatrist he's not. I'm confused about the ship G'Kar is traveling on.  Is it a Centauri ship carrying almost entirely human passengers, or a human ship that for some reason is crawling with Centauri guards?  Why does it all look like downbelow, and have markets and bars and shit?  And why the hell are there lightning storms going on inside the ship?  Did I miss something? I've only seen a few scenes worth of Lorien, and already he's starting to piss me off.  Nothing like a first one for mountains of cryptic pseudo-mystical bullshit.  Oh, and if you're a multi-million-year-old godlike energy being who can appear in whatever form he pleases, why would you appear as a goat-faced wizard with a tiara? I like the way the Shadows are actually starting to be developed now as a real race real culture, not just the monster under the bed.  I mean, they make fucking great monsters under the bed, but the idea that they have an actual philosophy of life is really appealing. And of course, with everything going on here, we still don't get an answer to the title.  Typical."
babylon5,dw7je,xauriel,3,Wed Oct 27 07:36:06 2010 UTC,"In defense of those CG space combat scenes, we've come a long way since the early 90s. Computer animation was a welcome novelty for television sci-fi audiences back when those scenes were fresh, sort of a fan service for nerds. They have lost a little of that oomph in the age of Avatar, but I think still stand proudly as efforts of early pioneers.  The whole Franklin addiction subplot was strange. It's interesting as a Vorlon parallel of the alcoholic Garibaldi subplot, but it could have been done better...  Maybe the snow globe symbolizes the Shadows' own beliefs about life: both can become stagnant and are only interesting when regularly shaken up. It might foreshadow Sheridan's intent to use just such a strategy against the Shadows spoiler. All in all though, it does seem a pretty ridiculous choice of decor for someone of Sheridan's stature. Perhaps it's a very rare snow globe made from an egg of the extinct translucent Spoo or something."
babylon5,dw7je,Vorlath,1 point,Wed Oct 27 15:33:34 2010 UTC,"I actually agree about B5's CG holding up pretty well, in general.  I have liked most of the battle scenes so far very much, and I'm not quite sure what it was that turned me off these ones.  Maybe they were too unfocused, or having to occasionally cut away and watch Doctor Franklin being a complete dick to himself killed the momentum, but something just didn't quite take for me."

I mean, what, don't Minbari husbands get to see their bride's 'true face' before marrying them?   I wonder if Delenn's depiction of the rituals is full and complete.  There may well be other rituals that give the man an equivalent choice that Delenn doesn't want or expect Sheridan to perform.  I also wonder how the Minbari handle same-sex couples.....   Again with the not telling the damn fleet admiral how his equipment works! Maybe you wouldn't have lost quite so many ships if Sheridan wasn't standing around staring in awe at the Minbari command centre!   That bit was so full of stupid that it made my eyes burn.  Let's start with the fact that Sheridan has zero, zlich, nada fleet command experience.  He's a fairly decent tactician and ship captain, but fleet command is a completely different kettle of fish entirely. The gulf between the roles is like the difference between being a street cop and the chief of police.  No one goes from one to the other without years of training and experience.  You'd expect utterly catastrophic losses from the skill mismatch alone.  Which is pretty much what they got.  The ideal person for the job would be someone who had done large fleet battles from a Minbari CIC--someone who knew how to run the equipment and knew how to fight on a fleet scale.  That would probably be someone like Neroon, or possibly Delenn herself, depending on how far Satai training creeps into military command and how involved she was with the sharp end of the E-M war.  Even using a Minbari fleet commander would be fraught with difficulties, however, because a commander needs to understand the capabilities of his/her assets to use them effectively.  A White Star can do very different things from a Sharlin, both of which are very, very different (hint: reactionless drive) from a G'Quon or a League self-propelled target.  A commander who isn't well aware of the strengths and weaknesses of all unit types under his/her control will not be able to use them well.  Because a fleet of this diversity had never been put together before, there's no one with the off-the-shelf experience to run this fleet and months of exercises would have been required to bring someone (or preferably several people) up to the level of being able to use it effectively.  Follow-on canon explains away the issues with Sheridan running this battle by saying he was supported by technomage deus ex machina.  When even the writers realize they have to retcon god into the story to make the plot work, there's a big problem somewhere...."

babylon5,dw7je,Vorlath,1 point,Mon Oct 25 19:04:36 2010 UTC,"Shadow Dancing   Whoever says the CGI looks dated on B5 is an idiot. Although they stand their ground, they took heavy losses.  A war of attrition is a sure way to lose.  Plus, the Shadows are very difficult to get in one spot.  This is not going well for the home team even if the Shadows ran this time.  Not only that, this is the first real attack on the Shadows.  Retaliation is sure to come as they point out. B5 is certain to be destroyed at this point.  It's too much of a threat.  We can now see that the future Ivanova clip from B5 being destroyed is going to be soon unless something is done. And oh yeah, walkabout has reached its destination.   Z'Ha'Dum   Undetectable warheads by the Gaim?  Wonder what those could be used for? We again see JMS' view on time.  Sheridan believes he can change the future.  Since Delenn tells him not to go, he believes that he didn't and that this causes disaster for the Centauri and others.  And since he's alive (on future Centauri Prime) when Kosh says he'll die if he goes to Z'Ha'Dum, then the only way to change things for the better is to go to Z'Ha'Dum.  In effect, we think we can change the past or future, but our actions result in the same thing.  I'm not a big fan of this worldview, but it's JMS' concept and it makes for interesting TV (B4, Valen and such). I thought Sheridan went a little overboard on the angry rant.  How was Delenn supposed to know if Anna was alive? Morden sends a message to Londo to leave the station.  Awww... how sweet.  He cares for Londo. So the station isn't destroyed and Ivanova doesn't send that distress call.  Here we have kind of a paradox.  If Ivanova doesn't send the distress call, then where did that come from?  Alternate universe?  We also see something that changed from that other possible future.  What was the cause?  I think we're supposed to assume it's Sheridan going to Z'Ha'Dum.  But what if it was Kosh dying after the Vorlons got involved.  Maybe Sheridan goes to Z'Ha'Dum no matter what, but in the other future, Kosh protects him.  In that future, B5 is destroyed.   So what do you think happens in the other future?   Sheridan stays home? Kosh saves Sheridan at Z'Ha'Dum?   Seems that either way, no explosion at Z'Ha'Dum is what changes things.  I forget, but did Kosh die before they went to B4 the last time?  If so, that could rule out Kosh dying being one of the possibilities.  The Hour of the Wolf   WOW!!!  I don't know how people can think that this season started off low key. Morden is back as a shadow of his former self. hehehe The Centauri Republic is led by a madman. The Shadows arrive to Centauri Prime just as Londo had foreseen way back in the first season.  That scene blows me away every time.  I know of no other show that could pull off something like that. Delenn is pissed. The Vorlons are plotting something. G'Kar is concerned about Garibaldi's disappearance. The league treaty is no longer in force. Now Londo and Cotto are plotting an assassination.  That's just awesome.  This has got to be one of my favourite, but most painful, subplots. Great start to a new season.   Whatever Happened to Mr. Garibaldi?   Really liked this episode.  I didn't like it when I originally watched it a long time ago.  The whole tick-tock thing was annoying.  But I actually listened to the message.  It's a good one.  Stop trying to avoid and fear death and instead find something to live for. The G'Kar thing was kind of stupid, but it does set up a fascinating subplot.  These are the things that can only be done when characters are established and nuances of relationships can be brought out. The title kind of betrays his name.  It wasn't just about Garibaldi, but about finding one's self."
babylon5,dw7je,xauriel,2,Wed Oct 27 05:28:15 2010 UTC,"Although they stand their ground, they took heavy losses. A war of attrition is a sure way to lose.   That would depend on the relative size of the alliance and shadow fleets and their respective ship manufacturing rates.  The Shadows have been defrosting ships stored from the last war and every kill of a newly available ship has been considered a very big deal. This suggests that the Shadows' ship manufacturing rate is negligible to nil.  In other words, the Shadows can't make up their losses.  We know the worker caste has been building White Stars at a crash project pace and we can likely assume that the rest of the alliance is  building ships as quickly as they can.  In other words, the alliance can make up its losses.  It just takes time.  Strategically, the Shadows will eventually be defeated by superior numbers unless they ramp up their own manufacturing capacity (N.B. they can't do this readily because their bioships need time to grow) or wipe out the alliance very quickly before the alliance's production advantage gives them the numerical upper hand.  The challenge for the Alliance is holding on long enough--protecting their command centers, logistics and manufacturing sites--for their strategic advantage to bite.  This might not be possible, but if the alliance can get over the hump, then the Shadows will eventually find themselves with their backs to the wall.  At which point they'll pull out the WMDs and sterilize the galaxy, but that's a separate issue.  The Shadows are actually in a situation very similar to that of the Japanese at the start of WWII: they have to knock out the enemy quickly because they will lose very, very badly in the face of industrial attrition warfare.  It's also worth mentioning that Valen's victory is proof that it's possible to fight the Shadows in a stand-up fight and survive.   In effect, we think we can change the past or future, but our actions result in the same thing.   Basically JMS is cutting an end run around some of the more obvious problems with temporal paradoxes by arguing that free will does not exist.  Once Sheridan flashed forward to the hell future, the next 18 years were frozen in place.  Everything--from the movements of every molecule in a gas cloud to the thoughts in every sentient being's head--became a frozen history to be played out like a script.  Nothing can change because that future, once it has been exposed, must happen because it became the past.  I can't say I find that any more of a satisfying philosophy than you do.   I thought Sheridan went a little overboard on the angry rant. How was Delenn supposed to know if Anna was alive?   Well, as the scriptwriter's stand-in, she does know everything. :)  Sheridan isn't hugely rational at the best of times, and especially not with regard to his wife, but the basic issue is again that all of the characters have the emotional maturity of teenagers.  Drunk and very heavily armed teenagers.   So the station isn't destroyed and Ivanova doesn't send that distress call. Here we have kind of a paradox.   The word of JMS is that B5 would have been destroyed if B4 hadn't been sent back in time or if Sheridan hadn't gone to ZHD.  Ivanova's distress call, however, couldn't have come from anywhere because the timeline is immutable.  Once Sheridan saw the hell future, both B4's return to the past and his trip to ZHD were frozen in history, and, as a result, so was the station's survival against both of these threats.  Since the station survived, there was no need to send a distress call.  The arse-pull answer, of course, is that the distress call came from an alternate universe."
babylon5,dw7je,vacant-cranium,1 point,Wed Oct 27 08:38:36 2010 UTC,"No, Sheridan's alliance is doomed.  They are LOSING.  It's over.  B5 is about to be destroyed.  The Shadows haven't just got their own ships.  They have the Centauri and plenty of other ships.  They are not losing their own ships either.  How one could think that they wouldn't be building new ships is beyond me.  Yes, they're defrosting old ships.  Are you suggesting they would leave them there now that they're needed?   The challenge for the Alliance is holding on long enough   They can't.  It's game over.  B5 is about to be destroyed.   The Shadows are actually in a situation very similar to that of the Japanese at the start of WWII: they have to knock out the enemy quickly because they will lose very, very badly in the face of industrial attrition warfare.   No, that's Sheridan's alliance.  They are being bombed continuously.  Planets all over the galaxy are being taken over.  The Narn have fallen.  The Centauri own much of the local region of the galaxy with countless planets in that territory.  Earth is under shadow control.  The league was at one point warring against each other.  The shadows have destroyed countless planets in one sector of space where they were going in for the final kill until Sheridan stopped them.  But now, it's payback time.  The entire series is all about how Sheridan and his forces can't do anything to stop the death spiral.   It's also worth mentioning that Valen's victory is proof that it's possible to fight the Shadows in a stand-up fight and survive.   Valen arrived after the Vorlons had already engaged the Shadows.  The war was already well beyond the point it is now.  The whole point of that story was to emphasize a central station of operation, B4.  B5 is about to be destroyed.  Do I need to repeat that?  If B5 gets destroyed, it's the same situation as 1000 years ago before Valen arrived.  Only this time, no one will deliver a brand new station after the Shadows destroy B5.  edit:  I just want to make it clear that the B4 episodes showed us point blank that when the Shadows destroy your central station of operations, you're losing the war.  That's about to happen here.  The Shadows are on the verge of victory.  I'm afraid your point actually works against you.   Basically JMS is cutting an end run around some of the more obvious problems with temporal paradoxes by arguing that free will does not exist.   Actually, he does believe in free will.  It's just that whatever we're gonna decide to do, we're gonna decide to do.   Nothing can change because that future, once it has been exposed, must happen because it became the past.  I can't say I find that any more of a satisfying philosophy than you do.   Yeah, I'm not a big fan of it. But with the future, JMS seems to be more relaxed in his interpretation.  But Sheridan's leap into the future apparently happens exactly as it did.   Sheridan isn't hugely rational at the best of times, and especially not with regard to his wife, but the basic issue is again that all of the characters have the emotional maturity of teenagers.   I think that's going a bit far.  We already knew Sheridan was touchy about anything to do with his wife.  But he's broken away from Earth and everything he's believed in.  His career on Earth is down the toilet no matter what happens.  He's been in the middle of several wars, or close to them.  With the Narn, he had to stand by helpless.  He's had assassination attempts on his life.  People have tried to blow up the station.  He's dealing with ancient races that just toss him around like a rag doll.  I could go on and I could do the same on all the characters.  Just take Londo.  Was his revenge on Refa unjustified?  His rage was justified though maybe not the target.  But that's B5.  I think their reactions are often understated.  I think most people would be in an insane asylum by now, or in therapy for years.  The only overacting I didn't like in this respect was Sheridan any time his wife was mentioned.  The last part of your comment about the time is what I was getting at.  I think JMS is more open to different possible futures.  Though Sheridan's leap forward is still questionable as being locked in.  JMS specifically says that he wouldn't be able to change that future."

Everything--from the movements of every molecule in a gas cloud to the thoughts in every sentient being's head--became a frozen history to be played out like a script.   I'd say it's more likely that this happened at the moment of the Big Bang.   Ivanova's distress call, however, couldn't have come from anywhere   Well, since it happened it must have come from somewhere.  Maybe there's an insurmountable difference in philosophy here, but I see it as more productive to try and imagine a framework in which what did happen could happen, rather than going on continually about how it couldn't.

Only Firefly had the potential, in my mind, to equal it... but alas.  I need to watch the entire series again. I'm so glad I bought the DVDs a few years ago."
babylon5,dsps8,vicegrip,2,Tue Oct 19 05:24:18 2010 UTC,"I'd say that having a 5-year arc was really unprecedented in TV (and especially in SciFi TV) at that time. I can't really remember any other TV series that you literally could not watch its episodes out of order. Most of them really had a ""Monster-of-the-week"" theme, and everything got reset at the end of the episode. B5 did have character development, and not confined to end-of-the-season episodes, as it happens in most TV series, even today. It's easy to think now that having an overall arc is standard (see Fringe, Alias, Battlestar Galactica, Dollhouse), but it's not as common, and it's not so intense.  Yes, the monologues were used too often, yes, the CGI has aged (not that much, though), yes, the whole story was a bit too compressed (5 years for so many world-changing events? WWII had less changing events, and, with the rise of Hitler to power, it took more than 15 years, not the 3 years it took from going from President Santiago [good] to President Clark [evil] to President Luchenko [good])  Still, I've watched the whole series a few years ago, and I still was extremely moved (i.e. cried :)) at the end."

But no show other than Babylon 5 ever had a whole plan setup prior to filming the first episode, and no other show managed to follow it.  JMS was something new, something never done before on Television, and he did the best he could.  Could have J.J. Abrhams done better ? Most likely. But he wasn't there then..."

I've watched most of the supposed ""best series ever"" shows. Yes, The Wire is impressive, in spite of a hideous second season (which about 10% of Wire fans rate as the best one). I enjoyed The Sopranos too, even though as black as it was it still looked at ""The Family"" through incredibly rose-tinted glasses. The Shield had some amazing moments, even though there's a moment in the pilot episode which completely mis-sells the show.  There is a reason this show still has loyal fans (and it's own subreddit). It's really good.  TL:DR - Don't say ""you only like Babylon 5 because you've only ever watched rubbish shows."""
babylon5,dsbrf,Tartantyco,5,Sun Oct 17 08:39:36 2010 UTC,"""War Without End"":   Absolutely, without question, a high point of the series.  Classic B5: tying up in a perfect knot one of the major loose ends, while of course spinning off a half dozen others, not to mention concluding plot lines that had barely even been mentioned.  When I first watched these episodes, I was enthralled by the scenes with Emperor Londo, how different everything was than how I had been assuming it was going; and Sinclair's 'transformation' into the Prophet Valen completely blew me away.  It's amazing, given how choppy some of the plot development has been and the amount of changes that have taken place in the intervening 2 seasons, how perfectly this story bookends Babylon Squared. It's interesting to see Sheridan and Sinclair side by side.  Since they fulfilled the same archetypal place in the plot structure there's a tendency to see them as similar characters, and in many ways they are, but watching them interact does point up a lot of the differences in character. And, of course, Zathras: probably the best 'tertiary' character in the entire series, played with perfect pitch by veteran Tim Choate.  Of course, he appears in Babylon Squared, but it's only here that we see the character really developed.  I love the long-suffering sighs - ""They never listen to Zathras"" - while everyone treats him as essentially a retard, just because he constantly refers to himself in the third person. It's interesting, the view of temporal causality that is developed in this series.  In Star Trek most time paradoxes involve causal agents attempting to change the past, whereas in B5 reverse-causality events have already happened, and thus are in a meaningful sense not 'changes' but part of the normal timeline.  The past is set - but with the implication that causal agents could still potentially change the past by not acting.  People take great care not to 'change the past' - except for Old Delenn, who seems to have no compunction about sharing at least strong hints about future events with Young Sheridan - but when they do attempt to deliberately alter what they know to be coming, it never seems to work. It's also interesting that, for all of its mysticism and religious overtones, almost everything that happens in this series is quite clearly based in naturalistic causality (provided you can accept time travel and psi powers as natural phenomena, but it's not as if those aren't well-established sci-fi conceits by now.)  There's really no need whatsoever to invoke theological concepts to explain prophecy, messianic figures, or the religious experiences of the characters.  Even the soul is treated as something that can be scanned, measured, captured. Delenn: ""John, I have rarely asked anything of you.""  Yeah, right. Going forward from here, I remember almost nothing about the plot.   ""Walkabout"":   Bah, more housekeeping.  Hell, even the big battle scene is housekeeping!  And how disappointing, after Doctor Franklin's fairly deep musings on the search for personal identity, that all he was really looking for was a dying woman to shag. Wait, so the Station Commander just went for an unscheduled, unescorted EVA without telling his second in command?  That really doesn't seem like Sheridan. Wait, New Kosh's encounter suit looks nothing like Old Kosh.  He's just supposed to make like he's the same Vorlon?  And nobody's going to notice this? Wait, the War Council is a democracy now?  Captain Sheridan's staff can just override his decisions with a majority vote?  I'm pretty sure that counts as mutiny. It's 90's night at the Downbelow Dive Jazz Bar!  Romance in this series is always so damn awkward and forced, and the music makes it even worse (totally not my style).  I do like the way they set Dying Girl up as a total junkie, then completely pulled the rug out, but everything else about this episode ranged from meh to craptastic.   ""Grey 17 is Missing"":   Minbari power struggles are seriously pathetic. I actually like the Grey 17 cult quite a lot, because it's the perfect symbol of the mystical bugwah that this series runs on taken to its logical extreme:  everything about this amazing universe that your perfect god created is corrupt and evil, so make yourself holier by living in shit and feeding yourself to the sacrificial beast.  That being said, I find it implausible that a sealed-off level with a bunch of crazies and a goddamn predatory alien living on it could have gone undetected for 5 whole years.  Come to that, I'm amazed that the Zarg survived that long on nothing but the occasional human sacrifice.  Maybe that explains why Garibaldi could take it down with a couple of revolver rounds. Also, that makeshift 'steam revolver' is some serious bamboo-diamond-cannon-grade bullshit.  I'm not big up on firearms physics, but I have trouble believing that stuffing a few rounds of charged ammunition into some random tube and steaming them would actually make them shoot out like a gun.  He could have just made the cultists give him back his damn PPG.   ""And the Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place"":   I liked this one, for the most part; it's a nice little political intrigue of the kind that I've been missing a bit lately, especially now that the command staff no longer have to dance around EarthGov and the B5 Council is essentially defunct.  I have some serious doubts that G'Kar would be so willing to do a deal with Londo, even for what he got; but maybe his 'enlightenment' has mellowed him out enough, if not to forgive, then at least to forget. I don't see why this episode needed a voice-over recap when none of the rest get them.  And the 'Z day' thing just ticks me off.  Have a little respect for my intelligence!  I don't need to be told exactly what's coming! I had hoped I'd seen the last of Brother Theo, and his buddy is just as annoying if not more so.  If I wanted advice on my work responsibilities and romantic relationships, the last person I would go to is a priest. Typical Centauri.  A high-ranking minister and courtier arrive on the station, go into their quarters and what's teh first thing they unpack?  The liquor, of course. Why is Delenn so cheesed off about Sheridan trying to 'think like' the Shadows?  It's one of the fundamental principles of military theory - ""Know Thy Enemy""! Apparently, the Muslim and the Buddhist don't get to have dinner with Sheridan.  Typical.  That's some nice ecumenicism you got going on there. I actually really like the fact that the liberal use of telepathic mind-rape has all but eliminated torture scenes in this series.  Yes, there was Sebastian, but his purpose was never to extract information - it was ultimately just part of the Vorlons' mind game.  Interrogative torture scenes in popular fiction piss me off because they support the myth that torture is an effective means of extracting reliable information from people.  The one story in Star Trek: The Next Generation where Picard is captured and tortured by a Cardassian was one of my favourites because it made the point so perfectly that the only thing torture is ultimately good for is breaking people's wills.  I guess sidestepping the issue completely is the next best thing. So wait a second.  Didn't Londo outright promise to capture G'Kar?  Shouldn't the minister be at least wondering when that's going to happen? Poor Na'Toth.  She had such potential as a character - in fact, she started off as a stronger character than either Vir or Lennier - and now, after a season with nary a mention of her, she gets momentarily resurrected as an unseed bait-and-switch.  Sad. The scene with all the White Star class ships is pretty impressive, and it's nice to see Blondie and Delenn finally get some action, but it was completely spoiled for me by the fact that Delenn ought to have told the general in charcge of her little crusade exactly how many ships were in the works and exactly when they would be ready - and he just acts all happy about it, like a big goof.  He should be having a fit that he wasn't infomed about this."
babylon5,dsbrf,xauriel,2,Tue Oct 19 09:19:46 2010 UTC,"JMS has a weird view of time.  It is locked into place.  There is no changing what has already happened.  There was a whole discussion on this, but ultimately, JMS himself has said that past events would always work out to what has already happened even if you tried to change it.  I think JMS believes the future is locked in as well.  But the characters believe they can change it."
babylon5,dsbrf,Vorlath,1 point,Tue Oct 19 14:56:02 2010 UTC,"The past is set - but with the implication that causal agents could still potentially change the past by not acting.   I found the distinction unsupportable.  Not sending B4 to before (phrasing intentional) would have had huge implications for the timeline, but so would have sending back B4 in the company of a few hundred modern Sharlin cruisers and the plans to make more.  It's easy to argue that abstract information--such as older Delenn's warnings to Sheridan--can't change the past because the recipient will always misinterpret the warnings to cause the event they're trying to avoid, but it's much harder to apply this level of utter fatalism to concrete objects deliberately sent into the past to change history.  I personally found WWE to be extremely depressing--and even more so as more of the arc unfolded--because it turned the series from something that had until this point claimed to be about the power of hope into a tale of fate and futility.  If the only reward for fighting the Shadows is another eighteen years of war and the only 'rewards' for Sheridan and Delenn are a security situation so bad that they are unable to protect their own son (which for any parent is a horrible fate) and personally getting tortured in a Centauri prison, then why bother?  What's the damn point of any of this at all?  Tell Morden what you want, let the Shadows do their damage, play their game, and then pick up the pieces later when they recede, because making the hard choices seems to produce a far, far worse fate.  And no, Deconstruction does not change my opinion in any way whatsoever.   Going forward from here, I remember almost nothing about the plot.   I hate to say it, but you're probably better off not remembering because, frankly, it's all down hill from here."

I don't think I agree.  We see prophecies, even before this episode, of B5 going up in flames, and being overrun by aliens.  We only learn now that those aliens were the Shadows.  But that never happens.  Never.  So, over the course of the series, we've seen prophecies that are played out, and ones that aren't.  As Vir said, some currents you can fight, and some you can't.  Sorry for all the spoiler tags.  Kind of necessary when talking about prophecies :)."
babylon5,dsbrf,keithjr,2,Tue Oct 19 19:16:23 2010 UTC,"OK, let's work this through.  (I've spent a few days thinking about this so bear with me.)  The view of causality being presented is so determined as to be almost fatalistic.  Past events are determined by the decisions being made right now, which are determined by past events.  Sheridan would have come up with a better plan, if he'd had enough advance warning.  Delenn would have given him more advance warning, if she'd had more to go on than cryptic prophecies.  Valen would have given better instructions, if he hadn't been so enamored of fatalist, mystical Minbari bullshit.  (Honestly, I think your 'send 100 heavy cruisers into the past' scenario borders on naive, considering what a production it was just to send one space station.)  Each actor could have changed things, but they wouldn't, so they didn't.  The only sticking point is Alternate Universe Ivanova's message, which opens the possibility that things potentially can be different from how they are.  As far as I can see, there are only a few possible explanations for this:   Strong Form Many-Worlds Theory.  Every possible outcome occurs in one alternate reality or another, so there's no coherent reason to see any possible set of events as being any more the 'real world' narrative than any other. The 'real' universe is the one with the highest probability.  The vast majority of events are fixed and immutable, but every once in a while things are such a close call that it could be reasonably said somebody faces a non-determined choice.  Sheridan's decision as to whether or not to send the White Star back to B4 was such a moment.  The probabilities were so evenly matched that at that moment, it was equally possible that he did and did not decide to do what had already been done, with all the causal implications of both choices being in a sense 'real'. Wugga wugga freewill destiny wickety woo.   Hopefully you'll forgive me if I choose to see things in light of the second option.   And no, Deconstruction does not change my opinion in any way whatsoever.   Bollocks.  Deconstruction can do anything!  ;)"

babylon5,dsbrf,Vorlath,1 point,Wed Oct 20 14:51:28 2010 UTC,"I'm not going to bother Fisking G17IM because it's too much like shooting fish in a barrel Jamie Hyneman style, but let's rip the guts out of this turkey.  The basic premise of the arc plot is that the Warrior Caste is not prepared to accept Delenn's promotion to Entil'zha and apparent rise to defacto head of the Minbari Federation for the duration of the Shadow war.  Naturally, the best idea the Warrior Caste has to prevent the unmitigated disaster of putting the one Minbari who has the best track record of dealing with Shadow threat into a position to deal with it is to send Neroon to Babylon 5 to beat poor, defenseless, Delenn to death with a steel pipe.  And that, dear reader, is how we're supposed to realize that Neroon is evil.  JMS is nothing if not subtle.  How Neroon--a person who is far more prepared to kill for his cause than die for it--was supposed to escape from a station controlled by Delenn's very devoted followers after killing her was mercifully left was left as an exercise for the viewer not to think about.  I somehow doubt, however, any attempt to escape Sheridan, Lennier, the Rangers, station security, and the entire Religious Caste would have proven particularly fruitful.  His last moments, I suspect, would have been very painful.  Note the last entity in the above list that would have an interest in avenging Delenn's hypothetical death.  Given the Religious Caste's reaction to the loss of Dukhat, killing the leader many of them regard as the second coming of Valen would certainly not promote peace and harmony between the Warrior and Religious Castes.  The Warrior Caste is very likely to know this.  Which brings me to my main point: the real story in G17IM is not that the Warrior Caste is challenging Delenn's rise to Entil'Zha, it's that the Warrior Caste is so enraged at the Religious Caste that the warriors are prepared to plunge Minbar into a civil war while the Shadows are active, with the very likely end result that the Shadows exploit the situation to wipe out the Minbari (or help EA enslave them) and then move on to do whatever they want to the rest of the galaxy.    If you're Delenn and you see this situation unfolding in front of you, the first, last, and only thing to cross your mind should be the Aderonto equivalent of 'oh fucking shit.'  Stopping Neroon from killing you is the least of your problems:  the fate of the entire Shadow war effort depends on you and Neroon walking out of this alive and establishing a truce, because if he kills you or vice versa, one caste will unleash hell on the other precisely when your people need to devote all your resources to fighting the Shadows.  What you need to do is convince the Warrior Caste leadership that your species needs to hang together because the alternative almost certainly ends with each of you being hung separately.  Ironically, if we assume Delenn figures this out, then how she handles Neroon is perhaps one of the most brilliant bits of leadership she ever pulls off.  By sacrificing Marcus, she de-escalates the crisis by creating a way out for both of them that doesn't end with a civil war.  Marcus gets a few broken bones, but Neroon grudgingly accepts Delenn's role, and the cracks are papered over for a little while longer.  Knowing Neroon's psychology well enough to pull off a deescalation when confronted with a near catastrophe is the mark of a very good leader more than worthy of the reputation we're repeatedly told Delenn has but very seldom see her act in a way that justifies it.  Unfortunately, the script as written provides no indication whatsoever that either Neroon or Delenn recognize the logical consequences of his assassination plan as a potential game-ending disaster for the Minbari and the Shadow war.  So, instead of a bit of utter brilliance that demonstrates what Delenn's really made of, we have a shitty little episode where Delenn treats Sheridan like dirt, he returns the favor, and two men use suspiciously phallic weapons to fight over a woman's honor.  Oh, and by the way, Garibaldi falls out of an elevator.  It's no wonder people hate this episode."
babylon5,dsbrf,keithjr,2,Tue Oct 19 08:12:56 2010 UTC,"No, stopping Naroon from killing her is first on her mind, even though it's the least important. In fact, her first thought is to reveal it, their equivalent of calling the police, but then she realises that it's not safe.  Naroon's motivation is clear - he wants to stop the growing schism from developing into a civil war, although if he can find no way to do that, he will start it and get the war over quickly and decisively, so that they can face the shadows."

What makes you think he had any intention of escaping?    In Season 2, a detained Minbari warrior killed himself, for the sake of honor.  He was the captain of a warship, having assumed command after his commanding officer killed himself, for the sake of honor.  Clearly they have a method of dealing with hopeless situations.  Neroon is willing to give up his life if he thinks the cause is worthy.  We see this in the future, in the wheel of fire    edit: I also think you're extrapolating a bit about the Religious Caste's response to Delenn's death.  The death of Dukhat was extraordinary because it was done by a alien race presumably in cold blood.  We don't have any information about how this society would react to an assassination from within.  We also do not know how popular Delenn really is.  She has the Rangers and some of her caste behind her, but she was a pariah in the Gray Council before her expulsion.  Hell, even one of Lenier's clanmates called her a ""freak"" to her face.  Yikes.    Also, kind of a tangential question here, but does the Warrior Caste think the Shadows are a real threat?

babylon5,dsbrf,vacant-cranium,1 point,Tue Oct 19 19:09:54 2010 UTC,"We don't have any information about how this society would react to an assassination from within.   To some extent I'm pulling at the setting to create a scenario where it makes even the slightest bit of sense for defacto leadership succession within the oldest young race to be decided by a Klingon-style honor duel.  Pushing back, IMO, just makes the episode look worse.  Granted, we don't know how the RC would react to an internal assassination, but I don't think they'd take it lying down.  Going into Jihad mode seems unlikely but I'd expect some retaliation, and once that happens, there's a real risk of the situation spiraling out of control.  The RC doing nothing doesn't seem likely because it would be equivalent to painting a bullseye on their leaders' heads and saying 'shoot here.'  National leaders have to draw a bright line under assassinations because if they don't, they personally might be next in the event that somebody else out there gets pissed off at their policies.  I'm basing my estimates of Delenn's popularity on the fact both the RC and worker caste members of the Grey Council backed her, and not the Warrior Caste, in Severed Dreams.  I'd expect that a lot of Minbari regard her as a freak--which is quite literally true--but from all appearances they're willing to overlook her odd life choices because of the Shadow threat.   Also, kind of a tangential question here, but does the Warrior Caste think the Shadows are a real threat?   It's not really clear.  Very little of the WC's motivations were ever explored in the main series beyond painting them as roadblocks for Delenn to get rid of.  Leaving the WC unexplained meant abandoning a lot of potential for strange bedfellows moments that could have been extremely interesting.  Possibilities like Shadow infiltration of the WC leadership, for instance.  It's also very interesting that the WC were more prepared to accept Sinclair than Delenn as Entil'zha.  Perhaps Sinclair was more acceptable to them because, as a human, he would have had very little effect on the inter-caste balance of power.  It would have been creative to run with this and have Neroon say that they'd the WC wouldn't tolerate Delenn as Entil'zha but that they would tolerate Sheridan (or some other human) as a compromise solution.  This, however, would have taken the episode in a completely different direction, particularly if Delenn kept her usual vow of silence and refused to pass the offer along....  I fear, however, that we're both over analyzing the situation far beyond what's supportable by the depth of JMS' writing.  The most likely backstory for the WC's views is that they oppose Delenn because they're simply Irredeemably Evil<tm> villains for her to crush, Mary Sue style.  I would have dearly liked to see the Minbari political situation handled in far greater depth, even at the expense of the other races screen time.  Fascist dictatorships (EA) and imperial monarchies (the Centuari) are a dime a dozen in fiction, but the Minbari caste-based theocratic oligarchy is something unique that had the potential to produce a lot of good drama if only JMS had been bothered to grow the species beyond the Klingon Viking honor duel motif towards something fitting for a culture that's been spacefaring for over a thousand years."

Well, we know there have been very strong tensions between the Warrior and Religious Castes since the Battle of the Line.  Delenn was largely responsible for starting the war with her tie-breaking vote.  Presumably the warriors handled the actual fighting (and dying).  Then, the Gray Council inexplicably ended the war.  The WC leaders found out later that the surrender was based on spiritual reasons.  And they were pissed.    If the warriors don't believe in prophecy, then they would certainly hold Delenn responsible for all of this, and not consider the Shadows a cataclysmic threat.     I would have dearly liked to see the Minbari political situation handled in far greater depth, even at the expense of the other races screen time.   I do agree that these are issues worth exploring, but the Minbari are a very alien race.  B5 is accessible to its audience because it exudes allegory.  Almost all of the aliens appear and act very human.  Dwelling on such a different culture from our own certainly would have been interesting from a fiction-building perspective, but it wouldn't have been as compelling of a narrative."
babylon5,dsbrf,xauriel,1 point,Wed Oct 20 14:50:53 2010 UTC,"Well, we know there have been very strong tensions between the Warrior and Religious Castes since the Battle of the Line   You need some spoiler tags on the rest of that comment.  I agree that it makes a lot of sense if you creatively interpret the backstory.  The WC has a very good reason to hate Delenn personally and to doubt her judgment.  If I was in their place, I would too.  What I'm not sure about is if JMS had any of this in mind at the time the first three seasons were written--the tealeaves in the lurkers guide suggests he was at this point pinning the blame for the E-M war on the WC and not Delenn.  Further, if the WC hated Delenn personally for her decision then we should have seen at least some hints--or preferably outright derision-- from Neroon et el.  You'd expect the WC to overtly criticize Delenn not only for her faith in prophecy but also because she's dangerously unstable and has a very bad track record in deciding who to fight.   If the warriors don't believe in prophecy, then they would certainly hold Delenn responsible for all of this, and not consider the Shadows a cataclysmic threat.   They don't need to dismiss prophecy to hold her responsible for the E-M war because, factually speaking, a large part of the blame does fall on her shoulders.  As far as their belief in prophecy goes, it's definitely unfortunate that no one bothered to explain the Sinclair/Valen connection to the WC as soon as he was sent back in time....  Keeping the whole thing under the rug tends to suggest that the motive didn't exist even in JMS' mind because we can only draw firm conclusions about the WC's motives on the basis of what we actually see.   Dwelling on such a different culture from our own certainly would have been interesting from a fiction-building perspective, but it wouldn't have been as compelling of a narrative.   From a storytelling perspective, the Minbari are nothing more than a bunch of humans who happen to have odd politics and an unusual culture.  There is very, very little in Minbari culture that is any more removed from the western cultural context experience than any number of real-world human societies in the past or present. It's no less possible to make the Minbari story compelling than it's possible to make a story set in feudal Japan or ancient China compelling.  It just requires more skill than JMS can provide.  Not making the effort, however, reduces the storytelling character of the species to little more than a one-dimensional machine that generates plot tokens (a love interest, heavily armed ships, some dubious philosophy) on demand."
babylon5,dsbrf,Vorlath,1 point,Wed Oct 20 16:48:51 2010 UTC,"I didn't want to spoil the spirit of my macro level critique of G17IM with petty sniping, so I've listed my minor nits here:   Neroon is upset that Delenn is taking control of the Rangers in part because, in his view, the Religious Caste has no business fighting wars.  The only problem with this is that Severed Dreams established that 2/3rds of the Minbari fleet is controlled by the Worker and Religious castes.  The Rangers are a rounding error compared to the Minbari Federation's mainline forces.  Neroon's whining about his house being on fire when his city is burning to the ground. Delenn doesn't tell Sheridan about Neroon on the grounds that the Minbari have no business being on B5 if they can't handle their problems internally.  She then orders Marcus--rather notable for his hair and lack of antlers--to get beaten up to persuade Neroon that she's the right person to be Entil'Zha.  I could accept this if the human Rangers were considered legally Minbari (for instance, if they hold Minbari passports), but everything else in the series defines Minbari identity in terms of genetics.  Using Marcus shouldn't be acceptable given the stated need to keep non-Minbari out of Minbari political problems. Unfortunately, nearly every act of semantics that can be used to justify including Marcus within the circle of people considered Minbari for Minbari political purposes also applies to Sheridan and the rest of the station command crew because they're essentially Rangers as well, in practice if not the letter of the law. If the station crew are acceptable Minbari proxies, then simply arresting Neroon until the ceremony is over is a completely workable option, given the implication that the completion of the ceremony (""once it is done, it cannot be undone"") takes assassination off the table. Marcus, Lennier and Delenn would have had some tough questions to answer after Marcus went to medlab.  ""He fell down"" wouldn't quite cut it.  Delenn would have clammed up when confronted by Sheridan, but that's a scene we really needed to see for foreshadowing if nothing else. Why did the Earth-Minbari war effect Delenn's father enough that he lost the will to live given that most Minbari alive then couldn't give a damn about humanity?  What did he know that no one else did?  My hunch is that the real story is that Delenn told him about her culpability and the knowledge that his daughter was, even if only momentarily, a genocidal monster, broke his heart in whatever sense the phrase actually means. Delenn was only in her 20s during the E-M war (It's bullshit, but it's canon bullshit), meaning that her father was almost certainly not old by Minbari standards.  He wouldn't have died of old age, nor do people literally drop dead from broken hearts.  Was he a war casualty, should 'it broke his heart' be taken as a euphemism for suicide, was it a mistranslation of 'heart attack,' or is something else going on here?  Was her father perhaps actually Dukhat (very unlikely, but possible if she was raised by someone else)? Having one parent leave for a religious order, ('great honor' or not) the other die young, (likely as a direct result of your own actions) and having your mentor die in your arms is going to lead to Abandonment Issues<tm>. Cue foreshadowing. How did Neroon get past the guard detail that would have been in place outside the ceremony room?  If he evaded them, then they should have been called on the carpet for incompetence.  If he fought his way though them, then they should have been called on the carpet for failing to raise an alarm and Neroon should have been arrested for assault.  Except for Marcus, no one human knows who he is, so there's no obvious issue with legal diplomatic immunity.  Cue an awkward scene with Delenn telling Sheridan to let him go, and Sheridan wondering what the hell she's up to and how much she really trusts him.   10.  Sheridan and Delenn's relationship has advanced very close to its final configuration. Certainly, they get physically closer in the future, and a little closer emotionally, but in this episode they have reached their long-term position of being in love with being together, despite demonstrating virtually no respect for each other, having very little interpersonal trust, and not being credibly in love with each other.  As a result, you get the sweet little scene where Delenn talks about her family and cuddles with Sheridan--enjoying the act of being together--juxtaposed in the same episode with Delenn lacking the basic respect to tell him about Neroon and Sheridan lacking the basic concern to even bother to ask if she's alright when Neroon walks up to Delenn with the apparent intent to kill her. While Delenn has offered up her life in sacrifice for his at least three times so far, Sheridan cares so little about her safety and wellbeing that the first person he whines to after Neroon breaks into the ceremony--and the dialog makes it clear he didn't speak to Delenn off camera--is Garibaldi. Soulmates these two aren't."
babylon5,dsbrf,xauriel,1 point,Tue Oct 19 09:19:45 2010 UTC,"She then orders Marcus   You seem to have missed the part where Delenn doesn't order Marcus to do anything.  Lennier told Marcus about Neroon, and he made it quite clear that he felt he was disobeying Delenn by doing so.   Why did the Earth-Minbari war effect Delenn's father   Maybe because he's just that solid that he actually cares about his people committing genocide?  It's not as if 'the Minbari' are some monolith that all feel exactly the same about any given thing.  You have to credit them with some individuality.   nor do people literally drop dead from broken hearts   Actually, they do."
babylon5,dsbrf,Vorlath,1 point,Mon Oct 25 06:11:47 2010 UTC,"War Without End(Part 2)   ""Never use this"" hahaha Ivanova pretty much says what JMS had planned.  That no matter what they try, they can't change anything.  That's really the only thing I don't like about the whole B4 thing.  But still, it's a great two parter that fits in with the earlier B4 ep as well as the rest of the series. So G'Kar kills Londo.  And he has an eye patch.  I know what causes the eye patch.  But didn't he get a replacement?  So G'Kar dies too?  I thought he and Lyta went away.  He came back, but I find it a weak point in the story for him to get captured again. I was SOOOO expecting Sinclair to say to Sheridan, ""So, what are your intentions with my great, great, great, great... granddaughter?"" I still wish we knew more about what Delenn meant about not going to Z'ha'dum.  We know the past can't be changed.  That would imply that from Delenn's POV in the cell, that past, our present, cannot be changed either.  So I suppose a case can be made that she experienced everything that we see later in the series and not some alternate future. I wonder... Zathras studied the great machine.  Did the great machine contain info on himself from 1000 years ago?  That's how he knew he had a destiny?  tsk, tsk, tsk...  No one listens to Zathras.   Walkabout   I like half of this ep.  The Stephen Franklin stuff, not so much though I agree it's an important part of dealing with adversity. Lyta is great.  I wish she was in the series earlier. I like how Garibaldi is getting in people's faces.  Never thought about it before, but I wonder if he would have talked to G'Kar that way if he hadn't had to deal with Franklin just before. They let the Shadows get away.  I forget all the details that come later, but it would seem to me that this is not good for the war council.  The shadows now know that an alliance has been built and that they know of the weakness of the Shadow ships. I always wonder where are the ships being built?  I know the Minbari are building some.  But the Drazi would be major ship builders too if I'm not mistaken.  Seems like a lack of coordination and resources required to build a fleet.  And technology.  I understand the need to not have certain technology fall into enemy hands, but you'd think there'd be more than just the Minbari, and even then it's a difficult situation.   Grey 17 Is Missing   First time I watched this eons ago, I thought it was cool that a section of the station was missing or had been left unnoticed.  But then the horror set in as I watched what can be described as a plotline that can only be enjoyed while absorbing copious amounts of mind altering substances. The rest of the ep was ok.  Humans will fight for Delenn, but not for Neroon.  Marcus was willing to die the noble cause.  I wonder what would have happened if either of them had a PPG.  Suppose Neroon died at the hands of Marcus, would Lennier be indirectly responsible for killing another Minbari?  It seems that Neroon did not want to go through with it.  No way he'd let anyone slow him down if he was really committed.  He also talked to Delenn first. It's funny how arrogant the warrior caste is.  They ""let"" the worker and religious castes build the new warships and instruct the rangers, but now that things are moving along, the warrior caste wants to take over.  FUUUUU!!! I'm guessing the higher echelons of the warrior caste and Neroon himself knew about Sinclair being Valen.  So they waited until after he's gone to move in.  I do like that Sinclair had experience training the Rangers before going back.  There's at least some continuity there though it leaves circular timelines of who thought up the concept of rangers first?   And The Rock Cried Out, No Hiding Place   Am I the only one who like Brother Theo?  That guy cracks me up. Probably my favourite sci-fi episode of all time. When I first watched this series, I hated Refa instantly.  Everything he did pissed me off.  You knew it was building to a confrontation especially after both poison incidents.  But the original run had a break just before the last four episodes of the season.  So this ep took forever to come.  But it was ever so sweet when it did.  And twisted!  My goodness, the way it worked out was beyond belief. Today, I have so much respect for the writing and the actor behind the Refa character.  Same with Vir and Londo.  Using each character's personalities to their full extent like that is rarely seen. So they roll out all the white stars at once?  I guess the production line concept isn't popular with the Minbari."

babylon5,dpl9z,Tartantyco,3,Mon Oct 11 06:05:04 2010 UTC,"""A Late Delivery From Avalon"":   And yet again, let's take a break from the most terrible war in a thousand years to watch Doctor Franklin break a crazy man - for the sake of medicine! - and Garibaldi argue with a postman about a box of cheese.  Oh, and also a couple scenes of plot advancement thrown in as an afterthought.  As with the episode about the Holy Grail, the sole saving grace here is Michael York's awesome performance as King Arthur.  But honestly, what's the point?  Ultimately, I think I would have been happier with this episode if it had been King Arthur.  At least that way it would have been in some way related to the main arc.  This plot would have flown a lot better back in the first season, when we still cared about stuff like the psychological health of the guy who started the Earth-Minbari War.  And what is it with the Arthurian mythos?  I mean sure, I can see the metaphor, but to devote two whole episodes, in separate seasons, to the theme of a noble lunatic living out specifically Arthurian fantasies?  Come on, JMS, I'm getting tired of this nonsense. Marcus Cole's comments about theodicy in the first scene more or less perfectly echo my own thoughts on the subject.  I'd be much less happy if I thought my life did have a purpose, since the only purpose that leaps readily to mind is sadistic amusement.  I'm starting to warm up to Marcus a bit more.  He does the whole 'educated rogue' thing very well. I like the bits with G'Kar and King Arthur a lot, but does it really make sense for the most politically savvy of the Kha'Ri to set a crazy guy up in a sensitive position amongst his people who are fighting for their lives based on a brawl and a night of drinking?   ""Ship of Tears"":   This is a very mature episode, and one that uses structure well to hide the amount of housekeeping that has to be done.  The complete about-face in Bester's character and his relationship with Sheridan & Co. was actually pretty well handled, developed logically and fairly smooth, though I would have appreciated a bit more buildup to what is a pretty significant event in the overall plot arc.  The scene between Delenn and G'Kar was really moving; this reckoning has been a long time coming, and I liked that it was handled quickly and with a minimum of drama, but did not sacrifice psychological realism for the characters to get it over with.  That takes some skill.  I also really liked the reveal on the new war room set; it was subtly done, with the emphasis more on the long-overdue complete inclusion of G'Kar in the war council, rather than 'look we has a shiny'. I assume that the new Star Furies' much-remarked atmospheric capability is going to be strongly leaned on as a tactical device.  Hell, at least this time around they're actually letting us know about it before we see it used. Though I like the idea of Bester moving to the status of enemy-of-my-enemy, I'm not sure I was comfortable with just how quickly the inner circle let him in, just because he didn't immediately scan Ivanova.  For instance, how could they know his little jaunt wasn't a still a trap?  And should they really have been so quick to let one of their arch enemies on board the White Star?  I mean, most of their opponents don't even know that ship exists; one would think it's a tactical advantage they'd be trying a bit harder to protect. It's good to know that Garibaldi has actually been reading the Book of G'Quan - though I wouldn't have pegged him for a 'learns alien languages in order to critically study ancient religious texts' kind of guy; that would seem to be a bit Delenn's forte.  In any case, I find it unrealistic that Garibaldi would have figured out the 'Shadows hate telepaths' thing where G'Kar and a hundred generatrions of Narns never suspected.  It's hardly coded in prophetic riddle; the message is pretty plain. Big things to come!  Squee!   ""Interludes and Examinations"":   Pretty heavy stuff.  The subplot with Doctor Franklin was handled surprisingly well, compared to the previous very-special-episode treatment of his addiction.  I'm still not super happy with the way Kosh reacted to Sheridan's browbeating; I tend to expect a bit more of Sufficiently Advanced Aliens than temper tantrums.  But hey, fear of death can do strange things to people.  I'm still not quite sure whether Kosh knew that his death was inevitable or whether he was still holding out hope that he could survive.  His death and funeral were an emotional moment for me.  I'm also a bit choked that Adira's total contribution to the series was to serve as a character foil for Londo's return to the dark side, and that she didn't get even a minute of face time in this episode (although I suppose the actress might just have not been available or wanted to do it).  But the final scene with Londo was amazing.  He's on a very dark road now. Morden has a strange power over people.  He walks the station freely even though Garibaldi must be on the lookout for him (obviously he has agents among the B5 crew, but Garibaldi is a canny loach).  More than just that, people are a little too quick to believe him - the merchant in the Zocolo, Londo believing him about Refa poisoning Adira, even G'Kar and Londo being willing to open up to him as far back as the ""What do you want?"" days.  Is this something the Shadows do for him?  And why wasn't Sheridan taken in the last time the two crossed paths? If I were Sheridan, I'd be pretty choked that Kosh used the image of my father as a mask.  Maybe it's just me. I'm going to hold off on the two-parter and watch both episodes back to back next week."
babylon5,dpl9z,xauriel,2,Thu Oct 14 06:58:45 2010 UTC,"But honestly, what's the point? ... Come on, JMS, I'm getting tired of this nonsense.   Agreed.  The series was very heavily loaded with irrelevant filler that served very little purpose besides expositing on just how clever JMS thought he was.  If all the irrelevant fill was cut, the series would have been much better for it because the relevant material could have been approached in much greater depth.  Just because you can work an argument about cheese--or a guy who thinks he's King Aurthur--into a scifi series doesn't mean you should.  The point behind writing fiction is to entertain, not to prove your ability to write clever dialog, or to prove your ability to write cute stand-alone scenes that have no connection to anything else, all while using hopes of seeing a plot resolved as a lure to force your cleverness down the or viewer's (or reader's) throat."
babylon5,dpl9z,vacant-cranium,2,Thu Oct 14 21:50:09 2010 UTC,"The scene between Delenn and G'Kar was really moving; this reckoning has been a long time coming, and I liked that it was handled quickly and with a minimum of drama, but did not sacrifice psychological realism for the characters to get it over with.   From a plot perspective, certainly.  From a character perspective, what I took away from it is that Delenn is utterly devoid of the kind of emotional self-control that would be required of someone in her position.  Granted B5 isn't The West Wing and taking liberties with the limits of professional behavior is expected, but it's hard to deny that JMS stuck his head in the sand about the utter shipload of baggage that's associated with writing female characters who fall apart emotionally at inappropriate times.  As far as G'Kar goes, his confession that he would have killed Delenn for allowing his people to be conquered largely just continues the established template that the B5 universe is mostly populated by surly teenagers who have been the victims of high level lead exposure during childhood.  In other words, a guy who was that well placed in the Narn government shouldn't have enough of an impulse control problem to believe that provoking the third largest power in the galaxy to agree with the Centauri and Shadows (!) that the only good Narn was a dead Narn would help his people in any way.  Like so much of B5, what we have in the Delenn-G'Kar scene is a well written, well acted, very emotional, scene between two characters who don't credibly belong in the positions the script says they hold.  JMS does setting, character, and ploy well.  What he doesn't do is make all three connect into a cohesive whole.   And would they really have been so quick to let one of their arch enemies on board the White Star?   Well, they did, didn't they? :)  Sheridan is far too trusting of humans he really shouldn't trust, especially as Bester could have stolen the WS himself without much trouble by mind raping the crew into doing whatever he wanted.   I find it unrealistic that Garibaldi would have figured out the 'Shadows hate telepaths' thing where G'Kar and a hundred generatrions of Narns never suspected.   I agree.  This is but one example of many where the plot hammers home a quasi-colonialist message that humans are superior to the various bumpy-headed savages--excuse me--alien races.  The Drazi couldn't get themselves together without Ivanova showing them the way.  The Minbari couldn't get themselves together in the face of a fight to extinction without Sinclair and his descendants.  Million year old First Ones are shown as being stupid enough to fall for simple psychological games at human hands.  The Shadows and Vorlons couldn't conclude their conflict without human help.  And now, the Narn can't figure out the Book of G'Quan without Garibaldi, of all people.  Spare me while I choose not to take up the White Man's Burden."
babylon5,dpl9z,vacant-cranium,1 point,Fri Oct 15 22:16:46 2010 UTC,"I strongly disagree about the G'Kar-Delenn scene.  It's not unrealistic for people to have emotions, even people of high rank.  And Delenn and G'Kar especially have been pushed farther past their comfort zones than any other character in the series.  Hell, Delenn is practically a different species now!  If that wouldn't upset your emotional balance I don't know what would.  And Narn culture clearly incorporates a lot of respect for raw emotion.  Not to mention G'Kar's world has been bombed completely to shit.  I think we'd all have a little trouble with self control in these kind of circumstances.  I notice you don't complain about Ivanova's little temper tantrums or the Doctor's constant dickishness, etc.  This is the kind of thing that makes characters people instead of stereotypes.   a quasi-colonialist message that humans are superior to the various bumpy-headed savages--excuse me--alien races.   I've noticed that none of the alien powers seems to have an even marginally democratic government.  The Minbari are a caste theocracy, the Centauri 'Republic' is actually a monarchy, and the Narns seem pretty tribal; I have no idea how the Kha'Ri is selected but I strongly doubt it's through public elections.  The Drazi Green-and-Purple system seems like the closest thing to an alien democracy we've seen so far."

A Late Delivery From Avalon  This episode seems to start out as if it's going to be about mysticism and unanswerable questions, and ends up grounded in stark realism with a mix of I-almost-caused-the-apocalypse PTSD.  Franklin and Macrus disagree about medical ethics, in a manner that fits both characters.  And this time Franklin turns out right for once.    We've learned a little bit more about the Earth-Minbari War, specifically how few humans made it out of the Battle of the Line.  It's still surprising to me that relations between the two worlds are so cozy a mere decade or so later.  But then, Homeguard does exist.  It also makes me think, through the series, we have been seeing the Minbari in a very idealized light.  But their history involves an act of fanatical barbarism and near genocide.  Kind of a fierce dichotomy.    The politics is kind of throwaway.  Yay, new defense treaty, but nothing too dramatic."
babylon5,dpl9z,vacant-cranium,2,Mon Oct 11 14:41:57 2010 UTC,"It's still surprising to me that relations between the two worlds are so cozy a mere decade or so later.   I wouldn't call EA-Minbari relations cozy at this point.  Earth's ambassador to the Minbari Federation essentially defected, the religious caste has defacto annexed a small part of EA territory and EA sent irregulars to kill Delenn and any other senior Minbari they could get their hands on.  All of this is in addition to the fact that EA has voluntarily aligned itself with the Shadows: the Minbari Federation's only permanent enemy.  I wouldn't call that cozy.  It's definitely surprising that they cooperated at all in earlier years to the point that the current state of affairs is actually a deterioration in relations, however.   It also makes me think, through the series, we have been seeing the Minbari in a very idealized light.   Yes.  Much (although certainly not all) of what we see of the Minbari is essentially told through Delenn's POV.  It is definitely a highly idealized view of what she wishes her people were, not what they actually are.  .  That said, 20,000 dead at the Battle of the Line--and the 250,000 dead in the entire war--is utterly trivial compared to war losses in the 20th and 21st centuries.  For comparison, around sixty million people died in WWII.  Even the extended US-Iraq war (1991-present) has been more deadly than the E-M war has been depicted. The Minbari habit of killing civilians and routinely torturing prisoners constitute major war crimes in their own right, of course, but the way the Battle of the Line has been made out to be worse than Stalingrad (etc) speaks from a severe lack of perspective.  Incidentally, several bits of JMS-speak backstory given on the Lurkers Guide about this episode were contradicted by later canon.  There's clearly some retconning in later episodes compared to the line of events explained here."
babylon5,dpl9z,kraetos,1 point,Mon Oct 11 22:41:19 2010 UTC,"That said, 20,000 dead at the Battle of the Line--and the 250,000 dead in the entire war--is utterly trivial compared to war losses in the 20th and 21st centuries. For comparison, around sixty million people died in WWII. Even the extended US-Iraq war (1991-present) has been more deadly than the E-M war has been depicted.    Combined military casualties from both Gulf Wars for both NATO and Iraqi Security forces is a little less than 20,000. The Battle of the Line—just the Battle of the Line—was more costly than the United States last three wars combined.  Korean War + Vietnam + Gulf I & II + War in Afghanistan all put together is around 100,000, not even half as bad as the EM war was for EarthForce. 250,000 dead soldiers is a lot of dead soldiers.  82 million died in WWII. 45 million Allied civilians, 15 million allied soldiers, 8 million axis soldiers, 4 million axis civilians.  But you can't compare WWII casualties to EM war casualties just like that, for several reasons:   As is mentioned in ""In The Beginning,"" the Minbari didn't kill any Earth civilians during the EM war. The Axis went out of their way to do the opposite. WWII was fought mostly on land with inexperienced ground pounders leading the charge. The EM war was fought in space with ships. Fewer soldiers, more equipment is going to mean fewer casualties. The Hyperion class, the backbone of EarthForce during the EM war, only has a crew compliment of 350. 350 per ship, 250,000 dead means about 700 Hyperions lost. The total ship loss number is probably higher, though, since the Hyperion was one of Earth's larger ship classes."

Ship of Tears   Nothing like Bester to make things interesting. I've seen this many times, but I don't quite recall how Delenn tells G'Kar.  Thought it'd be more intense, but it did not disappoint. Bester sits in Sheridan's chair!!!  Classic. Come to think of it, how come Psy-corps doesn't have titles other than psy-cop or p ratings? It's funny how much they reveal and you don't really notice. How many psy-corps insignia does Bester carry around?  He put a new one on right away. So... Vorlons create telepaths, but while they can defend against the Shadows, doesn't this also give the Shadows resources to control their ships? I like those blue and gray flying saucers at the beginning.   Interludes and Examinations   Mr. Morden's been a busy boy. ""UP YOURS!""  hahahaha! Really cool fight. There's just so much spoilerific stuff in this ep that I'm all twisted inside for not being able to talk about it. I don't understand why they let Morden on the station though.  B5 broke away from Earth.  There's no pretense about who Morden works for.  He's dealt with numerous people.  The threat is an all out attack on what Sheridan is trying to build.  But would kicking Morden off the station trigger that right now?  Maybe, but kicking Morden off the station because of what happened to Sheridan's wife seems like an all too plausible scenario now that B5 has broken away if we are to believe their previous encounter.  I sometimes think the name of the show gets in the way of logistics.  The rangers being in different places makes sense.  Organizing a war in the same location where your enemy roams freely does not.  Morden isn't blind and neither is Kosh or Sheridan.  Plus, Sheridan knows that there are Shadows with Morden.  Is it that if Sheridan kicks Morden off the station, Kosh would have been killed earlier?  I don't know... it just seems like an odd situation, especially considering how an open attack on the Shadows blows away any hint of ignorance.   War Without End Pt. 1   HAHAHA Minbari like to make their passengers dizzy before lifting off. The old footage was cool. This is just a fun episode all around. The only thing I don't like is how JMS thinks about time.  But that's a whole other topic."

I don't think it'd be too hard for the Shadows to create telepaths if they really needed them.  If they don't need them, then the Vorlons bringing telepaths to different worlds would be a good thing for the great war.  But it could cause havoc to those societies.  This is what was originally supposed to be Season 5.  Instead, we got ""that guy I hate"" from Season 4.  Hey, that would make sense.  If the Shadow ships have strong telepaths, does this mean it's more difficult to block them?  But ships guided by non-telepaths would have to leave like it did in Ship of Tears."

Narns as security was a nice twist.  Funny how G'Kar went from prisoner to warden. Majel Barrett-Roddenberry as Lady Morella was really cool.  I still remember the prophecy when I first heard it.  The second part took me by surprise.   Severed Dreams   One of the most badass episodes ever. Delenn has one of the best lines I can remember. The Narns fighting alongside the humans on the station.  I could go on about what kind of message and what it means for them, but the scenes do that just fine. Consequences of battle where the people aren't just empty faces.  They are people that they know first hand. This is what B5 is all about right here.   Ceremonies of Light and Dark   ep to transition into the new uniforms and breakaway from Earth Dome. Supposed to bring some connection to the characters.  I guess it did in a way. Don't like the crazy of the month episodes, but this was more about the leftover Nightwatch people. Something you almost forget by the end of the ep is how Londo and Refa are now both fighting for power.   Sic Transit Vir   ""... and by the time you get to five, you're !@#$#@!$""  - Vir Enjoyed this one, but not much to add."
babylon5,dmif6,Vorlath,3,Tue Oct 5 05:01:36 2010 UTC,"""Point of No Return"":   Another one of my all-time favorites.  It's about time the counter-cabal gave the fascists a good hard kick in the 'nads, but at the same time Sheridan realizes he's running out of shilly-shallying little avoidance tactics to get out of standing openly against Clarke.  I was especially happy this time around that Zack ended up making the right choice, as I didn't quite catch the buildup his character went through when I was first watching.  This episode also has some beautiful uses of contrast; the scene where Sheridan is declaring martial law as the Nightwatch is completely failing to enforce it, and the one where Nightwatch and the counter-cabal are both heading for the showdown in the docking bay, dozens of heavily armed police vs. four people with nothing but brains and determination.  The scene where the prophetess tells Londo and Vir that they will both be emperor, and the closing scene with Londo and Vir trying to get a handle on what just happened.  Beautifully done overall. Londo doesn't have a very solid understanding of diplomacy.  It's no wonder he was assigned to a joke embassy on a jinxed installation.  Come to that, it's no wonder the Empire fell to the state it was in if this is the widely followed practice. Also, I love how polite and reasonable Vir is even when he's having a screaming fit. I honestly liked Ambassador G'Kar a lot morre than I like The Prophet G'Kar.  That's exactly what we need: yet another character who constantly spouts meaningless pseudo-mystical crap. And speaking of G'Kar, WTF is that expression on his face right after he says 'I have and idea' to Ivanova?   ""Severed Dreams"":   Another absolute beauty, one of those episodes that completely sums up the spirit of the show.  It describes brilliantly just how fast the slide from propaganda and intimidation into pure tyranny can be.  This one really shows off the skill that went into pacing the overall plot arc (for all its choppiness and occasional lack of thorough development); a few climactic moments make it seem like more happened in this episode than actually did, while leaving plenty of room for lots of crunchy combat scenes and even a few moments of character development.  The bit in the ISN studio was a particularly nice touch, given the way ISN has practically been an arm of Minipax for the last season.  Definitely one of the best episodes of the series. This is the longest space combat sequence we've had so far, and again, brilliant direction; there's a lot of furious action, without the problems that for instance BSG has with so much going on so fast that you can't actually understand what's supposed to be happening tactically.  I found the course of the battle quite easy to follow. Good to see Delenn finally grow a pair, or some head spikes or whatever.  That's the Delenn I loved as a character in 1st season!  The one who marches in and tells people the fuck off when she has to! I was sad to see General Hague go.  He was a solid character.   ""Ceremonies of Light and Dark"":   I felt this was another shaky one.  The plot threads didn't really seem to weave together very well; each one felt like a distraction from the others.  Was it just me, or did all of Marcus Cole's little 'character moments' seem incredibly forced?  Maybe I just haven't seen enough of him (and haven't been super impressed with what I saw BTW) for it to seem like his development has a strong enough basis.  On the other hand, the 'rebirth ceremony' scene at the end was beautiful; every person's revelation stemming perfectly and organically from their established character.  Almost enough to redeem the entire episode based on that one scene. Delenn's comments about prophecy in the opening scene show rare insight for her on religious matters.  On teh other hand, Valen actually knew what he was talking about in his prophecy; you'd think he could have been a bit clearer. What is it with people discussing extremely sensitive information in crowded public places?  This time it's Londo shouting about Centauri troop movements, playing a hologram of Morden, and poisoning a man right out on the Zocolo!  Seriously, Londo?  You couldn't have done this in your quarters, where you usually hold your secret political discussions? The whole thing with the 'artificial personality'?  Yeah, so not funny.  This episode has a bit of a problem with inappropriately timed humourous moments, too.  The bit where psycho boy sings Them Bones (completely off key might I add) nearly ruined what was otherwise an extremely nice performance for me.  And the thing with super-beard swinging his drink at Marcus and hitting that other guy was right in the middle of a very tense and emotional moment for Marcus.  Poor choices. And yet more pseudo-spiritual psychobabble from Delenn.  I thought the scene between Londo and Delenn was very nicely done, but I was surprised to see G'Kar turn her down so flat.  I would have thought he would be a bit more on the same wavelength.  I guess Narns will be Narns. I absolutely loved the moment when Lennier finally loses control.  ""We may look like you, but we are not you.  Never forget that.""  It's great how much of a badass Lennier gets to be every once in a while. Just seeing bumper shots of B5 with those Minbari cruisers gliding around it was quite inspiring, a bit surprisingly so in fact.  They're no longer 'all alone in the night'. I like the new uniforms, but one would think that Sheridan & Co. would want a bit of input into what their uniform was going to be.  I think it would have been cool for them to all get Ranger uniforms instead.  I bet Ivanova could totally rock a half-cape.   ""Sic Transit Vir"":   OK, did I miss something?  What the hell happened with the tied-up Narn? I started out really not liking this episode, what with all the awkward, poorly written romance; but the third act blew me right out of the water.  I was totally blindsided.  The Centauri, of course, are in the end stages of a process that Earth Alliance is just now beginning, giving opportunities to comment on the full range of fascist behaviour and attitudes.  Who would have thought that bubble-headed Lyndisty was a cold-blooded genocidal maniac?  The expression on her face as she talks about 'culling' the most aggressive Narns almost makes the rest of the episode worthwhile. Almost.  God, all that syrupy gunk is just nauseating!  I really wish the writers could have found a better way to make their point.  And, again, the pacing between Delenn and Sheridan is really off kilter.  This is stuff taht should have been happeing back in season 2, this awkward-first-date-first-kiss-bla-bla.  This kind of thing is what was missing from the early development between them, part of why things seemed to be moving so fast.  Now that we're in territory where their relationship should be much more firmly established, it feels excruciatingly slow."

One second we see Vir holding a knife, paralyzed in fear thinking, 'How the hell am I going to tell her no and that she's completely insane?' The next scene, the whole episode is pretty much over. We all know what Vir would do, but couldn't they have done more with it? Honestly, this is one of the worst B5 episodes from this season.

babylon5,dmif6,eatpreyhate,3,Mon Jan 3 19:21:47 2011 UTC,"Point of No Return   I would expect Vir to know about Lady Morella speaking in third person. That just seems like exposition. Save the eye that does not see - the one Londo wears from Signs and Portents? Seems rather too obvious, and implausible. The one who is already dead might be Morden, but that again is implausible. Surrender to your greatest fear seems fairly straightforward, but probably isn't. You will be emperor/you will also be emperor was handled well. My expectation for such scenes is that the characters will fail to grasp what's obvious to the audience.   Severed Dreams   Absolutely amazing episode. Also the most pivotal since Chrysalis. Once again, nothing is the same any more. I'm no space tactician, but I would have put the Alexander and the Churchill further away from B5. Hitchcock zoom! Delenn gets to be badass. Succeeds admirably.   Ceremonies of Light and Dark   This is the midpoint of the show. We knew Lennier could fight, but he's also really strong. Is that true of Minbari in general? Romance subthread(s?) will probably start to kick off now. I don't immediately like the new uniforms, but maybe they'll grow on me.   Sic Transit Vir   Some of the funniest scenes I remember from the show. And on the other hand, a thoroughly chilling view of Centauri attitudes. Lyndistey in particuar gets some beautiful lines, which just happen to be describing atrocities that she's witnessed. Londo is considered passé at the Centaurum. They try not to lie to themselves about their greatness. That probably makes them much more dangerous. The university term's started, so I may fall behind soon."
babylon5,dmif6,philh,2,Sat Oct 9 00:57:00 2010 UTC,"Severed Dreams  Remember Delenn's comment when she breaks the Grey Council that the religious and worker castes control 2/3rds of the Minbari fleet.  It's not significant to the plot, but it is significant to a plot hole a little later in the season.  One wonders when Delenn found the time to learn to fly the White Star, but by now we all know that Minbari warships are easy enough to operate that they can be used militarily by anyone even if they have no experience in type whatsoever. :)  Ceremonies of Light and Dark  Let's imagine you're Earth Alliance.  Not so long ago, your species was almost completely wiped out after one of your captains accidentally killed the Minbari leader. Is sending a bunch of state-backed terrorists to kill the most senior Minbari you can get your hands on, especially one regarded by some of her people as the second coming, really the brightest move you can make to get Babylon 5 back under your control?  Let me think about that for a moment.  NO.  This episode underscores that JMS really did not understand the political scope of what he was writing.  Using irregulars to attack foreign leaders is an act of war.  Period.  Merely making the attempt is ample justification for the Minbari to turn Earthdome into a radioactive crater.  JMS wanted his hostage taking (and Delenn's damsel in distress moment for season 3) and that's what he wrote, but there is no way this plot survives suspension of disbelief unless EA is either suicidal or strong enough to believe it will survive an onslaught of enraged Minbari determined to get the genocide right this time.  Neither of the latter arguments are supported in canon, which leaves remaining the conclusion that JMS simply didn't know what he was writing about."

The EA does believe that they are strong enough to take on the Minbari, because they believe that the Shadows will back them in the event the second Earth-Minbari war flares up. They also (correctly) believe that the Shadows will utterly dominate the Minbari.  This is basically the point of everything that's been happening since halfway through season 1. The Shadows are running around, getting their fingers in everything, telling all the younger races ""go ahead, start a war you can't finish. We'll help you out.""  The Shadows are trying to sow chaos. They're trying to get the younger races to turn on each other. Earth-Minbari war part 2 is at the top of the Shadows' priority list.

We can assume there are other politicians with that level of self-delusion.  And Clark's rise was largely enabled by embedding the Political Office in the military in complicated ways, and empowered by an underlying current of xenophobia.    So even if EA didn't plan to use plausible deniability regarding the actions of isolated extremists, they still have orders coming from people who might not have a strong grasp of what another interstellar war would look like.  edit: it's also possible Boggs was acting in isolation.

One of the things I really like about the series is that, although B5 has massive influence in shaping events, JMS doesn't paint it to be some lone, unique bulwark that is the sole instigator of events. Mars Colony secedes before B5, as does Proxima III and Orion VII, Mars will continue to have a sizable impact on future events in the series and eventually be a major player in events that take place outside of the scope and timeline of B5.

Human before the creation of Babylon 5 is a lot like 20th Century USA, with it's participation in the Dilgar war.  But for the 1st season of Babylon 5 the 20th Century USA never really supported the UN or other mediation platform.  However, Babylon 5 was almost left alone, so if you imagine Sinclair as the UN ambassador trying to make peace but without the support of the Earth, yeah, it fits.  Of course, Clark's Earth Alliance is more like Nazi Germany.   Minbari: Japan (caste system may point to India)   I personally always saw the Minbari as India. Old cities, a rigid caste system. Deep spiritual connections.  But not today's India. The India of the past, when it was a great power.   Narn: Africa (not a country, I know, you get the idea)   Yes. Imagine many of the African countries banding together in the mid 1950s and forming an alliance to get back at the colonial powers and you have the Narn.

Victorian England fits a lot because it was the start of a slow fall which resulted in a vast empire in decline but still strong on its own territory.  Rome on the other hand, didn't even really survive as an entity per se.  But Rome before the fall sounds a lot like Centauri Prime of the past.   League of Nonaligned Worlds: NATO, or just Eastern Europe   Neither. In both cases (NATO and Eastern Europe), you have a unifying force (either the USA or Russia) which is a major power.  The way I saw them is at the 10 non-permanent member of the UN security council.  You have the 5 permanent members, the USA, France, UK, China, Russia, which make the decision because they each have a veto, and the 10 other members who are almost bystanders, never able to get ahead because of the 2 years term limit.  On B5, they eliminated the veto to a simple vote, but gave the LNA a single vote as a whole (which isn't obvious in the series but clearly explained by JMS).  So, you have 6 votes on the B5 council: the 5 major powers and the LNA as a whole.  BTW: Great thread !"

babylon5,djwaf,Tartantyco,3,Tue Sep 28 08:03:16 2010 UTC,"""Voices of Authority:""   Watching this episode gave me the shivers.  It's fashionable these days for entertainment TV, especially sci-fi, to treat issues like terrorism, torture, and the trading of freedom for security; but it's actually been quite some time since I saw such a bang-on treatment of the kind of propaganda and information warfare used by those who attempt to subvert democracy.  This could have been written 5 years ago rather than 15, back when the most urgent political issue of the day was where the President's dick had been.  It honestly makes me a little mad to see how clear the path ahead was before we even started walking it My one major issue with this episode (other than the fact that the actress playing Musante isn't very good) is that she was more than a bit too forthright about her agenda, from the newspeaky conversation in the restaurant to her speech to the night watch letting the purge out of the bag to her clumsy attempt at seducing Sheridan.  I would have been much happier to see the character established over a series of episodes and bring these things out with a little more subtlety.  I feel like I'm being slapped across the face with the plot arc and I don't like it. I don't see anything wrong with Zack's uniform.  Zack has been having to grow a lot as a character lately, and Jeff Conaway is not quite up to the challenge, but he's giving it his best.  This episode is a real turning point for Zack. This is a very good episode for Bruce Boxleitner to show of his acting skills.  Musante talks a lot, but Sheridan is the one really communicating in their scenes; he uses his eyes and facial expression to pretty good effect as he gets more and more angry and dismayed by what he's hearing.  Again, the character of Musante could have been a great foil for Sheridan had she been introduced earlier and allowed to develop a bit (not to mention played by a more competent actress).  OK, I'll stop now. I like the way G'Kar remains a major force in the series, even getting some very nice political scenes in an episode in which he has nothing whatsoever to do with the primary plot or subplot. Good to know Draal has been doing something down on Epsilon III beyond pulling his pud (or whatever it is Minbari pull).  One would think he might have invited his allies to do something with the immensely powerful macguffin he has at his disposal before now; the whole 'see-anything-anywhere-plus-have-all-the-knowledge-of-the-cosmos-at-your-disposal' function might have come in handy on a few occasions. At first I was annoyed at the representation of Ivanova's head trip , but it was more with Draal's pseudo-mystical narration than the concept itself.  It was actually a fairly good representation of trying to access information and technological capabilities far beyond our own limited range. I'm actually quite surprised that Sheridan didn't get more pissed off when Musante tried to seduce him, considering how strongly he feels for his dead wife.  One would think he would find it a bit disrespectful, especially considering his active dislike of the character.  I suppose he understands that it's just part of the political game and nothing personal. Once again, I absolutely frackin' love the ship designs in this series.  The First One ship is brilliant, and stands up just as well under extended scrutiny as in the brief flash from Mind War (jeez, I had to go and look up what episode it was even!)   A perfect visual representation of the product of an intelligence beyond our comprehension.  Which is why I found the ease with which Ivanova manipulated the First One using reverse psychology to be frankly a bit insulting.  It nearly ruined an absolutely beautiful moment for me."

Sure, she was over the top, but when the political atmosphere is so tilted in one direction, you'd be surprised what people do.  On B5, things haven't progressed that far yet.  So she seems like fish out of water.  But back home, the water's just fine.  I just checked and JMS says that he took her political statements directly from real life political statements.  I never understood the jacket thing.  I think it was a running joke that he didn't really know where he fits in.  Ivanova using reverse psychology always bothered me in a way.  But JMS pretty much confirms my thoughts on this.  It's not the reverse psychology that matters.  It's the fact that Ivanova would dare to antagonize a far more powerful race.  We're basically ants to them.  Yet, here is an ant that won't be pushed aside even though she can get destroyed in a second and trying to piss them off at the same time."
babylon5,djwaf,Vorlath,1 point,Wed Sep 29 09:22:48 2010 UTC,"I really dislike Musante's delivery; she has a serious problem with emphasis.  It's not the writing per se I disliked - more the fact that these issues could have been spun out over a few episodes, rather than all shoved into one.  Musante struck me as being a bit too honest and forthright for someone whose domain is propaganda and spin control - would she really have just came out and told the whole B5 Nightwatch contingent about the upcoming purge?  What makes her think they can be trusted?  Would she have been so open about matters at home with Sheridan when, from her perspective, he's at best a dumb jarhead with no understanding of image politics?  And, as funny as the seduction scene was, I feel like it could have been stronger played seriously.  She could have been a much stronger character if she'd entered the picture 3 or 4 episodes ago.  As for Ivanova, I won't question the word of JMS, but to me the scene gave no indication that the First One changed his mind just because Ivanova stood up to him.  If that was the intention, it would have been much more effective to just have her throw one of her patented Ivanova tantrums and call the First One out.  The scene read very strongly to me as if Ivanova's quite trite and pathetic little attempt at reverse psychology actually worked on a being with a mind so advanced that we are like ants to it."
babylon5,djwaf,xauriel,1 point,Thu Sep 30 06:53:48 2010 UTC,"JMS already explained how he took her political statements directly from real life.  So you can argue against history all you want, but JMS likes to go against conventional TV wisdom and actually put in more realistic scenes when possible.   And I believe Marcus told Ivanova: ""They're bigger than we are.""  Sure, it looked like Ivanova was using reverse psychology... but I don't think it's wise rejecting alternate possibilities considering the advanced nature of the First Ones.  Just because something looked like it worked doesn't mean it did."
babylon5,djwaf,Vorlath,1 point,Thu Sep 30 12:38:38 2010 UTC,"Once again, in re. Musante's statements, I am not arguing that what was written was unrealistic, only how it was presented.  I thought that the statements themselves were perfect.  It's the context that bothers me.  The statements might have been from real history, but that particular character making them to those particular other characters in that exact situation did not actually happen.  There's no need to be insulting about this; I'm perfectly capable of reading what you've written."
babylon5,djwaf,xauriel,1 point,Thu Sep 30 13:56:25 2010 UTC,"From JMS repeated here from Lurker's guide.   The one comment that I find most interesting, repeated here a few times, is that they didn't buy the Nightwitch (as some have dubbed her) because in her address to the Nightwatch, she was not exactly what you might call subtle, and thus nobody'd believe her, and see her for what she was.   I find it interesting because we always think we're smarter than that, when history proves exactly the opposite. The Big Lie, spoken not just openly, but loudly, firmly and with conviction, has been one of the most successful tactics in history. When Hitler and Goebbels stood before a crowd and blamed jews for destroying society, circulated pamphlets with ugly cariacatures, indicated that they weren't really human (this in actual newsreels provided to the medical profession members charged with eliminating ""mental defectives and jews"")...when Joseph McCarthy stood up in front of the nation waving a list of names of commies in the state department, the military, congress, showbiz, and the sciences...the public didn't suddenly wake up, hear the voice of the fanatic, and say, ""Hey, this guy's nuts!""   They bought it. Because they were primed to believe it. Because they wanted to believe it. Because they were afraid not to believe it. No, she wasn't subtle. Because there's a time for subtlety, and there's a time to perform grandly for your hand-picked audience and go for the Big Lie. If she were addressing a larger audience, she might softpedal her message. To the Nightwatch, she's got to hammer them, just as the Hitler Youth were hammered, as the Anti-Communist Youth meetings were hammered about the Red Peril, as Croatian or Serbian soldiers were hammered about the need to rape women of the other ""race"" to make the resultant babies more ethnically pure...which happened.   Most of her dialogue was paraphrased from actual speeches given over the decades, or longer, by fanatical leaders to their followers. There's bits of Hitler, of Goerring, of Goebbels...bits of McCarthy, bits of Stalin, bits of Pat Buchanan and Rep. Dornan.   Because people fell for it. It did work.   It does work.   And it will continue to work...for as long as people think that THEY would NEVER fall for such a thing....   And sorry if you thought I was being insulting.  I hope JMS' response covers the presentation issues."
babylon5,djwaf,Vorlath,1 point,Thu Sep 30 18:25:47 2010 UTC,"Fair enough; but what I was actually talking about, which I may not have made clear, was that I didn't feel there was enough build-up.  I didn't feel like the Nightwatch had been prepared enough, either on-screen or implicitly, to receive that level of harangue.  I didn't feel that a serious political operative would come out and say things so explicitly to someone who was clearly hostile to her cause within half a day of meeting him.  I'm not 'arguing with history'; I thought I was clear enough in my original post as well as subsequent ones that I think the writing here is a brilliant presentation of the way these things play out in real life.  This is purely a matter of literary structure, as well as the delivery of the actress which could have been significantly better IMO.  I think we've started talking at cross purposes again.  To re-iterate, I did not have a problem with the content of the writing.  I just felt that the delivery of the same content could have been better timed."
babylon5,djwaf,xauriel,2,Thu Sep 30 18:41:13 2010 UTC,"I'm ok with differing opinion (timing and such).  But you really don't think there was enough build-up with respect to Nightwatch?  I find that amazing.  Although she wasn't there more than an episode and I thought she did a remarkable job, I don't think I could have watched much more of that character.  I remember watching B5 on a weekly basis with a long delay after the first four episodes of the season which made certain issues seem to last for a lot longer than the pace we're watching them at here.  So the whole Nightwatch thing seemed to drag on forever.  I can assure you that in its original run, the Nightwatch thing was so drawn out that everyone was complaining about it by this point.  For me, the Nightwatch thing went WAY too far and wasted far too much air time.  It's actually the part about the show I hate the most.  I think it was done correctly.  I just don't like the plot lines."
babylon5,djwaf,Vorlath,1 point,Thu Sep 30 21:33:45 2010 UTC,"Really?  I don't remember it quite clearly from my first run, but I would love to see more of the Nightwatch actually getting subverted.  I want to see more of the process by which the cabal is taking Earth Alliance under; it really seems a bit abrupt, how Clarke got into power and suddenly bang!  Fascism!  Especially since they're going the political route instead of bringing in the heavy muscle right away.  Part of it is just a consequence of the way the episodic structure is working itself out; instead of plot arcs that are unrolled smoothly over several episodes, the writers have had to jam a lot of the buildup into the cracks between other plots and then do whole episodes where major plot points are introduced and resolved in the same episode.  I've grown used to shows that pace things a lot more smoothly.  This episode in particularly just bothered me, especially since it's a really consequential one in terms of just how much the balance of power seems to have shifted within the Earth government."
babylon5,djwaf,xauriel,1 point,Thu Sep 30 21:54:20 2010 UTC,"Only Sheridan might want to subvert Nightwatch.  It's not his style.  Nightwatch, a division of the political arm of government, the Ministry of Peace, was started by Clark.  I hope you don't believe that she was there to subvert Nigthwatch.  She was there to assist Nightwatch with its original plan.  Also, I REALLY have a hard time with your suggestion that anything is sudden.  Clark has been President for close to two years now.  He became President at the end of Season 1 when Delenn looked much different and Sinclair was still station commander.  This is also when the Shadows first helped Londo.  Since then, the Centauri have been able to completely take over the Narn homeworld.  Clark had plenty of time to institute far reaching changes in the same time.  And for a series that is planned on a 5 year basis, 2 years is a VERY long time indeed.  Nightwatch was first mentioned a full 11 episodes ago from Voices of Authority (not counting that one).  Once the Ministry of Peace was created, things should have escalated a lot quicker.  It's well known that fascist takeovers advance quite rapidly once their actions become overt where they can openly create such a department.  Yet it still took a full 11 episodes.  And there's still more to come now that martial law has been declared.  edit: Wanted to add that Morden arranged for Clark to be President (no longer a spoiler, YAY).  Clark's agenda was clear from his POV right from the beginning."
babylon5,djwaf,Vorlath,1 point,Thu Sep 30 22:24:17 2010 UTC,"""Dust to Dust"":   I like this episode a lot.  It's low key, but it's seriously focused, and a major turning point in 2 distinct ways: not only G'Kar's little meeting with Kosh (which is an absolutely amazing scene), but also significant in that this is the first time Sheridan & Co. have openly defied a representative of the Psi Corps conspiracy.  Granted their choice was between killing Bester, fronting to him, or risking their whole counterconspiracy being exposed; but as of this moment, there's no more dancing and flirting around the fact that the B5 command staff are simply not cooperating with the revolution. Once again, I absolutely love Bester.  He's just such an insincere, unrepentant snake, and Walter Koenig clearly relishes chewing the scenery.  I look forward to every moment he's on screen.  ""I'm here to save your butts!"" The little 'sound bomb' that Garibaldi uses to immobilize the drug dealers would have come in handy in so many previous episodes.   ""Exogenesis"":   Sigh, and yet again the main plot arc gets shoved aside; dribs and drabs of character development shoved into the cracks between yet another damn iteration of the Puppet Masters trope (though one with a little originality at least).  Bye bye, throughline, we'll see you next week. Hooray for Lt. Corwin!  Joshua Cox seems like one of the more under-utilized actors in the series; he does a hell of a lot with what little he gets (probably a major reason he's graduated from Guy Who Occasionally Acknowledges A Superior Officer's Commands to a slightly more active role).  The way his eyes bug out when he thinks Ivanova is coming on to him is absolutely priceless. What's up with the Doctor's crocheted surgery gown? Marcus Cole seems to do a whole lot of talking very loudly about very secret stuff in very crowded places. ""Hey, look!  Unidentified alien goo hanging off a hole in the wall!  I think I'll poke it!"" I have a total hard-on fro Marcus Coles's magic staff.   ""Messages from Earth"":   Another hugely pivotal episode, which makes me wish it had been foreshadowed a bit more.  The whole 'Garibaldi saw a Shadow ship on Mars' thing would have been nice to have at least been alluded to before this episode.  Beyond that, I really don't have much to say about this episode.  Hard choices to be made; taking an action that seems absolutely necessary provokes something almost worse (though it would have been something in any case).  Good character development for pretty much everyone involved; one great scene with The Prophet G'Kar, giving a taste of exactly how much his experience has changed him.  The bits with Zack and the Nightwatch were beautifully handled. It's interesting to watch Marcus Cole's character development, as he is the first major character who isn't part of an established hierarchy (Earthforce, Psi Corps, or an alien foreign ministry).  Several of the other characters are ceasing to be bound by their social role and having to develop new paths for themselves, but Marcus is a wild card from day one. Sheridan is going to be running out of tactical Hail Marys to pull out of his ass sooner or later.  I hope he finds some way to actually take out a Shadow ship, fast."
babylon5,djwaf,xauriel,3,Thu Sep 30 06:39:03 2010 UTC,"Voices of Authority   Minipax gets ever more chilling. Zack is a great character - he doesn't like what he's doing, but he feels like he has no choice. Garibaldi isn't exactly helping him, either. He mirrors Londo, in a way. He still hasn't gone dark, so maybe he won't. Finding that video seems rather out-of-the-blue. Like a deus ex machina that doesn't actually quite solve things. Musanti is good at what she does. The first ones speak English. Have they been watching? Did they just access the ship's files to work out how to translate? Did the Vorlons piss them off by acting exactly like they've continued to act throughout the show? I could totally believe that. They may be nothing like humans, or any other race we know about - but they're still easy to manipulate by playing off their pride.   Dust to Dust   Ivanova is willing to commit murder even when there's an alternative. There's no way she'd get away with it, so she'd be sacrificing herself, which doesn't seem prudent when the forces of light are so small. On the other hand, Franklin and Sheridan don't seem willing to commit murder even when there isn't an alternative, which is perhaps even less prudent. (If Delenn hadn't found an alternative, perhaps Sheridan could have been convinced that Bester just had to be killed. I don't think Franklin could, though.) Why would the psi corps have to dissect Control? I'm taking that line to be pure antagonism. Why did Bester suspect G'Kar? Just because the Narn need weapons right now? JMS has said that Laurel Takashima was originally intended to be the host for Control, who presumably caused Sinclair's transport tube to break down in The Gathering and then erased the records. If so, that implicates the psi corps in the plot to kill Kosh, which also had Narn involvement. This feels very tenuous, though. (Besides, maybe Garibaldi suspected G'Kar first, and Bester was just more eager to move on him.)   Exogenesis   A nice twist on the alien parasite theme. Garibaldi seems unusually dismissive. Ivanova is unusually dense: it should have been obvious to her that Corwin misinterpreted her invitation and lied to save face. She also should have been more subtle than to kick him out so soon.   Messages from Earth   Was that guy using nunchucks? I'm not sure whether that's awesome or stupid. ""You're a loose cannon."" ""Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom."" Bastard. The Shadows have been working with Earth for at least seven years. Now the implication is that Earth is trying to betray the Shadows by taking one of their ships. But I suspect the Shadows know exactly what's going on. (This also supports the theory about the psi corps plotting to kill Kosh.) Morden has only been working for the Shadows for three years. Did they have another human ambassador prior to that? The ships on Mars and Ganymede imply that the Shadows were near Earth during the last war. But they didn't use it as a base like the Narn homeworld. Apparently the Minbari follow the Calvin's dad school of shipbuilding. Sheridan is still unwilling to make hard decisions, but Delenn offers a way out again."
babylon5,djwaf,philh,1 point,Wed Sep 29 18:13:07 2010 UTC,"I think the Psi Corps just likes dissecting people. It makes sense that the Doctor would be so strongly against killing, especially as his character has been established as being willing to do more or less anything to save lives.  Sheridan, OTOH, is just being played up as 'golden boy', Mister Pure and Honourable (despite his demonstrated willingness to throw civil rights out the window). Not only are the Narns the ones most desperate for weapons at the moment, especially something like Dust that could be most effectively harnessed by an urban guerilla force; Narns have no telepaths, making a drug that stimulates telepathic abilities of particular interest to them."
babylon5,djwaf,xauriel,2,Thu Sep 30 07:03:44 2010 UTC,"Voices of Authority   Fun episode.  Always enjoyed this one. I like the political advisor in a weird way. Ivanova had some good lines in this one. Garibaldi is going to learn Narn?  I suppose learning an alien language takes what?  1, maybe 2 days.   Dust to Dust   Bester! VIR!!! ""where he went nutz"" is now a medical term.  I like this show! ""Londo: Why don't you eliminate the entire Narn homeworld while you're at it?  Morden:  One thing at at time, Ambassador. One thing at a time."" I still say the Shadows wanted Narn destroyed more than the Centauri's did. The Psy-corps developed dust and they're on the station so that the Narns don't obtain it.  Clear connection to the shadows I would say.   Exogenesis   Bland episode. Marcus and the newly promoted Lieutenant were funny.   Messages from Earth   Earth under martial law.  Ministry of Peace getting nosy about Sheridan and the Chief. Why did Sheridan bring Delenn on the White Star? So Earth wants Shadow technology.  Can't really blame them after the Minbari war. I didn't really buy the part about Garibaldi having seen one of these things.  It's kinda out of the blue. And the psy-corps is involved. More and more, my theory about the Shadows wanting to destroy Narn is being confirmed."

babylon5,djwaf,pleen,2,Tue Sep 28 18:14:17 2010 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen it more times than I can count.  But I've only now noticed the true link between the Shadows and the Narn.  I'm being extremely careful about not revealing anything that hasn't already been shown.  So my analysis may not be as elaborate as I'd like since I don't want to risk spoiling it for anyone.    I do have some spoiler tags in earlier discussions that are no longer spoilers.  For example, I talked earlier about how Kosh has spoken to different people in their minds.  Sheridan was one of them.  He knew  about Ivanova's latent telepathic abilities.  And now he's spoken to G'Kar.  These are no longer spoilers.  But my new theory now says that G'Kar may have been more important than what actually happened if Sheridan had not shown up.  I could talk more about this, but it'd be a spoiler at this point.  What I can say is that I believe that the elder races had a front man to fight their cold war.  The Shadows eliminated the Vorlon's front man, G'Kar (in his capacity to do much).  Look at 1000 years ago, and you will see a parallel.  BTW, what does your gf say about the show?  Personally, I'm still amazed that I'm discovering new things after watching it so often."

I'm still not sold on this interpretation, but I love having this conversation, because it forces me to think about aspects of the plot I took for granted.    The Shadows eliminated the Vorlon's front man, G'Kar   The Vorlon's ""front man"" is, and has always been, Delenn.  Remember the allusion to the bombing of Coventry?  Narn fell largely due to the fact that Kosh and Delenn did not want to tip their hands.  They were perfectly willing to sacrifice G'Kar's world in the process, and played coy when he came back from Z'ha'dum, speaking of ancient enemies.    This still leaves the question, why did Kosh touch G'Kar (providing him with a life-changing epiphany)?  It could be that as much as the Shadows feed on war, the Vorlon want peace.  It could have also been guilt, or pity, since we know Kosh is exceptionally compassionate among his kind..   I could talk more about this, but it'd be a spoiler at this point.   As could I, but I suppose we'll have to let this conversation evolve naturally."
babylon5,djwaf,keithjr,1 point,Wed Sep 29 16:40:36 2010 UTC,"I completely agree that Delenn is the ""front man"".  Or at least one of the primary people the Vorlons are speaking to, as they have many people they're helping/manipulating.  But what's really going to bake your noodle is suppose B4 never went to the past, Valen would never have existed and since Delenn is a descendant of Valen, then she would not have existed either.  Who's the front man in that alternate reality both in the past and in the present?  I'm not saying that G'Kar would have necessarily been the one the Vorlons would have chosen.  In fact, the whole Narn history would likely have been different, so everything is speculation.  G'Quan says that the Shadows settled on their world 1000 years ago.  Perhaps they would not have done so if B4 had not gone back and Narn would have telepaths today. But it seems to me that the Shadows were still operating on their original gameplan.  Knowing what they now know with the Valen prophecies, the Vorlons could have leaked false information and let Narn fall.  Heck, the original Centauri attack 100 years ago could have been backed by a few shadows.  Nothing is certain, but if the Vorlons have been visiting other worlds, I'm sure the Shadows weren't completely dormant either. We know that the Vorlons are responsible for creating the telepathic gene.  However, they never went back to Narn in 1000 years to re-institute it.  Why?  Coventry indeed."

Especially when they smile. Looks like they took out Na'Toth from the credits. She was barely even in season two. When the warrior caste find out that a top-secret high-tech Minbari/Vorlon ship named the White Star has been given to the guy who destroyed the Black Star, they're not going to be happy. It's capable of really tight manoeuvring. That must take an awful lot of power. Sheridan has quite an eclectic personal army. The Rangers, Draal, B5 itself, and now a flagship. Plus everyone in the War Council (except maybe Marcus) has power/influence in their own right. Sheridan seems to be taking the conspiracy of light and broadening its horizons, to fight against the shadows as well as EA facism. Turns out the two are related. I always wondered why Morden didn't talk to Sinclair in Signs and Portents. Turns out he had access to someone more important. That makes a lot of sense. I don't get the title.   Convictions   Nothing special. I would have liked some main arc. Some good scenes with Londo and Londo/G'Kar. Face-recognition software is implied to be implausibly useless.   A Day in the Strife   Two episodes with credible threats to the station's existence. Makes you wonder how it survived this long. Translation software is shown to be implausibly good. Even if Franklin is too stubborn to see/admit that he has a problem, his staff should notice. I would also expect that there's protocol for it.   Passing through Gethsamane   Continued failure to understand that a personality is the person. Edward was not Charlie, so he had nothing to atone for. However, I felt it was better handled than in Divided Loyalties. Maybe that's just because it came from the other side. Instead of I don't care that I'm about to kill someone I like, it was I don't feel good that someone I hate is already dead. Which is entirely believable when there's someone else inhabiting their body; it's not them, but you feel the same way to look at them. ""Where did you learn a move like that?"" Apparently Sheridan isn't very good at chess. Nor are Ivanova or Edward. Valen came 1000 years ago and brought peace to the Minbari. Wasn't that around the time of the last Shadow war? Did he form the GC just in time that they could be an effective force for good? And if he wasn't born of Minbari, did the Vorlons have something to do with him? Was Kosh inhabiting Lyta? Why did she want the area to be clear when she returned? That didn't look like Bay 13, so whose ship did she use?"
babylon5,dg7w3,philh,2,Mon Sep 20 22:40:00 2010 UTC,"I don't get the title.   I think it has to do with the Rangers in general.  Marcus arrives at Babylon 5 through acts of courage and self sacrifice.  You can also say that the B5 staff's rebellion is done out of a sense of honor, but that's a stretch.   I love the scenes with Londo and G'Kar.  You get a newfound sense of the depth of G'Kar's hatred.  He's perfectly willing to die if, in doing so, Londo dies as well.  And he can just laugh through it.  Kind of scary.     Even if Franklin is too stubborn to see/admit that he has a problem, his staff should notice. I would also expect that there's protocol for it.   Since it hasn't interfered with his work, its actually likely they haven't been clued in yet.  He was in a real bind in this episode and an outside observer could play it off as stress.  The fact that he has now openly lied about his stim usage, and got away with it, implies he can hide it well."

A fairly good start for Season 3. It just occurred to me that B5 is about the only TV serial I can bring to mind that changed its intro sequence every season, specifically to reflect the ongoing development of the series plot arc.  (BSG did this to an extent, but not in the same directly narrative fashion.)  It was a good idea but ultimately I'm not sure how well it flies.  The intro functions as both an entry point for new viewers and a sort of ritual, a way of getting the brain back in the imaginative space laid out by the series mythology.  The constant changing of the intro's narrative and music cue might have contributed to B5's less-than-optimal viewership.  (Also, the narrative for this season's intro is pretty lame compared to the previous 2.) One wonders exactly how Londo thought he was going to be able to just walk away from Morden and his associates.  He's politically savvy enough that he should have known that wouldn't fly. Minbari may not 'lie', but they sure can spin the truth. That's right, take some drinks to not look suspicious in a downbelow dive bar, then just leave them sitting on the table.  Nothing suspicious going on here, no way, no how. It's nice to know that Delenn can fight if she needs to. Wait a sec, I thought the Rangers were this super-secret organization.  Apparently, not only do the Shadows already know all about them, so do alien governments like the Drazi, who have 'agreements' with Sinclair and whoever else is in the ranger 'high command'.  Meanwhile, practically nobody knows anything about the Shadows.  So what incentive exactly would the Drazi and whoever else have to let an alien paramilitary force train in their territory?  Somebody isn't quite thinking this through.  Once again, the Rangers should have been developed a lot more in season 2. I know Sheridan feels an obligation to help the Rangers; but flying into a combat situation with no intelligence, an untested ship that you don't even know the capabilities of, and a crew of priest-academics who don't even speak the same language as you?  Any military commander worth his stars would have a fit!  For that matter, how realistic is it for Ivanova to learn how to operate weapons systems based on two kinds of completely alien technology in a few hours in hyperspace?  She must be a real prodigy. I was super-unimpressed with Marcus Cole's origin story.  Using the whole 'dead brother' thing in an attempt to buy the character immediate sympathy is amazingly cheap, and wasn't even done very skillfully; they should at least have saved it for an episode where there wasn't quite as much going on. And of course, the inevitable: Morden and a Psi Cop having a nice long chat.  Good to know what page we're on.   ""Convictions"":   The writers of this episode went to a whole lot of trouble to put Lennier in a coma and G'Kar and Londo in an elevator.  I was more than a little disappointed, after all of the dwelling on the political aspects of terrorism, that the bomber turned out to be a plain old everyday case of Gone Postal.  I would have at least appreciated an Anarchist or a Racist or a Religious Fanatic or something.  Postals don't plant bombs - even if the act is premeditated, they want the personal touch.  And, as entertaining as the whole business was, I would have liked to see something get resolved between G'Kar and Londo.  I mean, static character entrenchment is all well and good, but I feel like G'Kar and Londo's character arcs deserve a bit more than 'I hate I kill'.  It was nice to see Londo display a bit of compassion, though I felt that scene fell a little flat as well. I gotta say, I just love the Drazi.  They're like children. Aren't there already an order of monks living in Downbelow?  I have a lot more respect for the singing monks who've been scraping alms for at least the last season than for the self-satisfied self-appointed 'teachers' who show up the second an angel appears and expect to be treated like honoured guests. Once again, how quickly Sheridan suspends civil rights when he feels the need.  you'll notice that the alien being hassled in the montage behind blondie's little 'do whatever you have to' speech was saying 'I have diplpomatic' something - immunity?  credentials?  Not a person whose bag should be casually snaffled through, at any rate.  Then again, it was 1996; they didn't have quite the same political climate we do now.  Truth be told, it's a relief to see something where terrorism and civil liberties don't always have to be such a big fracking deal. Yeah, Minbari sure don't lie.  Lennier is getting corrupted by his exposure to alien heathenism. Wait a sec - why, exactly, was Londo disembarking from a Minbari vessel? Why is it that writers on a series like this can put absolute gut-busting scenes into their script, but try to write a plain old lightbulb joke and it comes out perfectly flat? And you're going to put highly recognized experts in a half-dozen scientific fields to work as video surveillance clerks.  Classy.  Doesn't Earthforce Security have any kind of established procedure for dealing with things like this?  Half the time Garibaldi is flying on pure gut instinct.  I would have thought 'review the surveillance footage' would be something you do as a matter of routine.   ""A Day in the Strife"":   An interesting little experimental piece, kind of like a bunch of mini-episodes stitched together; and each of the subplots is fairly well executed (except for Doctor Franklin's awkward little after-school special).  A character piece for Londo; a meditation on the ethics of resistance and collaboration; a fun exercise in game theory with the 'berserker' probe; and, of course, Sheridan gets his badass moment during a negotiation with a transport industry lobby group of all things. Wait a second - just what was that trouble-maker doing at a meeting with the transport guild?  Does he seem like the type who would have a financial interest in how quickly cargo was clearing customs?  Heh, IMDB even lists the character as 'Troublemaker' in the cast credits.  That's funny. After a few nice touches of empathy, Londo is back to being a complete asshole.  ""I didn't get a good look at Narn, the last time I was in the area.""  You frackin' douche.  And that scene with Londo and Delenn is perfectly played.  Poor Vir.  Poor Londo. I feel kind of irrationally stupid for not recognizing Ta'Lon in his first scene.  (The phrase, 'they all look alike' occurs to me.  But the prosthetics are well done enough that many recurring Narn characters are not at all difficult to tell apart.)  Also, very nice performance by Stephen Macht as Ambassador Quisling, I mean Na'Far.  I always felt that collaborators get a bit of a raw deal in terms of public opinion, as many of them really are just trying to do what they can to help people; and we all love the romantic image of the underground resistance, but in many cases the only difference they end up making is to get themselves and those they care about dead.  I suspect that a lot of people who believe that they would hold out to the bitter end under occupation would in reality end up compromising. I'm wondering why the crew didn't bother to bring in the dozens of well-recognized experts in multiple scientific disciplines who just arrived on the station to work on the probe's questions.  Do we even ever see those monks again, or were they just there to act pretentious and look at some video footage? Looks like Garibaldi's diet has been long forgotten.  Ugh, those scenes with Franklin are just so saccharine and trite.  And, honestly, is the Doctor really acting like that much more of a douchebag - for the sake of medicine! - than he usually does? Not to harp on this particular point, but again, minor characters getting their due: a couple of nice moments with David Corwin in this episode. You'd think, if they were expecting the probe to produce a nuclear explosion, they would have closed the blast doors on the C&C observation window."
babylon5,dg7w3,xauriel,2,Wed Sep 22 08:31:51 2010 UTC,"Wait a sec, I thought the Rangers were this super-secret organization.

Somebody isn't quite thinking this through. Once again, the Rangers should have been developed a lot more in season 2.   I don't think this as far fetched as you do, but I do agree that a lot is left unknown to the viewer.  There are plenty of things the Rangers (and the Minbari government) could offer in exchange for a small piece of land on an insignificant colony.  Maybe only a handful of Drazi even know.  Just another one of those behind-closed-doors, top-secret dealings we should come to expect from the League.    Also, keep in mind Marcus escapes the colony via a Drazi Ranger sacrificing himself.  So whatever relationship Sinclair has with the Drazi must be pretty swell.  But then again, the complaint that these questions remain unanswered is a valid one."

He's politically savvy enough that he should have known that wouldn't fly.   I feel like he didn't think he would, at least at first. Morden surprised him by being so acquiescant. He still did some fishing for catches (neither of us owes the other anything), but eventually he just got lulled into a false sense of security.   Wait a sec - why, exactly, was Londo disembarking from a Minbari vessel?   I believe they mentioned there was a Centauri vessel disembarking at the same time."
babylon5,dg7w3,philh,1 point,Wed Sep 22 16:34:06 2010 UTC,"(Apparently, my maunderings are getting too long for Reddit to handle.  Guess I'd better start splitting my posts up.)  ""Passing Through Gethsemane"":   Well, this functions well enough as a psychological episode, but for a philosophical one it fell somewhat flat.  Concerns that the mindwipe treatment might not work quite well enough, and concerns about 'justice' versus 'vengeance', and all that bugwah about souls and sin and absolution, rather bypass the fundamental point here: 'death of personality' is tantamount to death, period.  Worse, even; death, after all is just death.  Mindwipe is quite decidedly not more humane than execution; it is significantly less humane, both to the perpetrator and to the victims (as demonstrated by the fact that they would go to such lengths to track him down and carry out their natural right of vengeance).  It realistically amounts to psychiatric enslavement, the destruction of one person and the creation of a new one built to social specification, deprived permanently of self-determination, of freedom of thought - especially if fragments of memory remain to be potentially dredged up by alien telepaths; I think the ultimate plot actually undermines the seeming thesis that the new person is in some essential way 'the same as' the old one, as it took considerable intervention both psychological and telepathic to bring even these fragments to the surface, and Brother Edward remained in essence the same person as he was built to be, with an extra helping of psychiatric torture thrown in.  The fact that it seems so perfectly natural for a mind-wiped criminal to become a Catholic monk also confirms my perception that the perfect religious persona is one that has been completely deprived of their own personality, their own self-interest, and remade into a blind utility-maximizing device.  And, of course, in the end the cycle of violation is continued.  No, I'm with Garibaldi on this one; an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth may leave us all blind and toothless, but at least it does not leave us shambling husks that people talk about as if they were human beings. And Friar Douchebag continues to irritate me more every time he opens his mouth.  Please tell me he gets to go away after this episode. Yay, Lyta's back!  I always liked her better than Talia, anyway; she doen't have that 'wilting rose, scared kitten' quality that Talia did when faced with practically any challenging situation.  Of course that may have something to do with how thoroughly she's been mind-raped by the Vorlons. The little lesson on Minbari theology was actually quite interesting.  That sounds suspiciously like the central thesis of God's Debris by Scott Adams.  Not so bad, as unprovable suppositions about irrational concepts go.  Plus, our first taste of the Legend of Valen!  Nice how they slipped it in as a throwaway joke.  Subtle. And again, Sinclair shows his willingness to completely disregard basic human rights when he feels it's justified.  Not only is he philosophically confused about basic questions of personal identity; he's happy to have Lyta mind-rape information out of that Centauri guy.  We've spent the whole series being told how vile this kind of behaviour is, but Sheridan really really needs to know where the lynchin's gonna be! By the end of the episode, Ivanova and Lyta are acting quite a bit chummier than I would have expected.  I mean, sure, she's not Psi Corps anymore, but surely the fact that she's a possibly-brainwashed agent of an alien government who once brain-raped you and essentially killed someone you were becoming emotionally close to would lead to a bit more standoffishness from a woman who is notorious for hating telepaths?"
babylon5,dg7w3,xauriel,1 point,Sat Sep 25 06:02:14 2010 UTC,"Matters of Honor   Introduction to Marcus and the White Star.  Also, we are made aware of the bonehead maneuver. Overall, very entertaining episode. I've watched the entire B5 series countless times and I never caught on to the meaning of Morden's statement at the end.  Unfortunately, I forget exactly how much has been revealed about the Shadows on Narn from 1000 years ago so far in the series.  But we now find out that the Narns were a threat to the Shadows.  The whole reason that the Shadows helped the Centauri's was to destroy Narn.  I always thought it was just to remove those two races from the coming war.  But it goes deeper than that.  The Shadows basically executed a cold war against the Narns so that the Shadows would not be revealed out in the open.  One could say that the Vorlons are doing the same.  At the end of the last season, I was wondering why the Shadows would be so agreeable to destroy the supply depot when it was just a matter of time before Narn fell.  Now we know why.  Well, we don't know the exact reason, but we do know that the Shadows wanted Narn destroyed more than even the Centauri's wanted it.  It's funny the parallel between Narn and the Centauri.  1000 years ago, the Shadows settled on Narn.  In the near future as seen by Londo's dream, the Shadows will settle on Centauri prime.  Both will end up destroying the Shadows.  And both planets will/have suffer(ed).   Convictions   The G'Kar and Londo scenes were my favourite the first time I watched this series. Aside from that, crazy person episode of the week.   A Day In The Strife   Londo being a complete asshole.  G'Kar willing to give himself up for the sake of the others. Sheridan looking generally PO'd overall (aside from when he had a drink with the Narn bodyguard). The ops guy in C&C was funny this ep. I know we haven't met any other races for real, but does it really make sense in such a universe as B5 to have a race that would send probes out like that?  One that is REALLY advanced could disable the thing, find out who and where it was sent from and go kick some ass.  Ok, maybe such an advanced civilization would be more charitable, but they could certainly cause trouble for them.  Other civilizations may be able to do the same and really be in for some retribution. Dunno, it kept me busy, but not sure I'd call this a good episode. Those probes reminded me of the Soul Hunter ships.  Could it be them?  It'd make some amount of sense.   Passing Through Gethsemane   LYTA!!!  OH YEAH! Interesting take on a real topic that could come up in the future.  I thought the actor that played brother Edward did an excellent job.  I like Theo too. I never picked up on the question if he could wait for the inevitable.  He waited.  But this was his new personality.  He wanted to have some kind of connection, or validation, of a higher power that this new personality was somehow worthy. The ending was very well done.  Sheridan stepped back when ""Brother Malcolm"" reached out his hand.  Quite the powerful message that letting go is tough."
babylon5,dg7w3,Vorlath,1 point,Fri Sep 24 03:38:42 2010 UTC,"I never caught on to the meaning of Morden's statement at the end.   What statement are you referring to?  I don't have the episodes in front of me right now.  At any rate, you've got me thinking about the Shadows and the Narn in a completely new light.  I'm still not sure I'm sold on it, though.    When he first arrived on B5, Morden approached G'Kar just as he approached the others.  He was looking for somebody who had something to prove, and wasn't going to ask questions.  He came close to getting this from G'Kar, his thirst for vengeance was so acute.  But when the question turned to his personal ambitions, beyond revenge, G'Kar cared only about the safety of his people.  Londo wanted the Centauri at the top of the galaxy.  Morden chose Londo.    If the Shadows were actually afraid of the Narn, Morden would have gone straight to Londo and nobody else.  Hell, he would have tried to infiltrate the royal court sooner than he did.  We know, at this point, they already infiltrated Earth.    So no, I don't think I agree.  Morden didn't choose the help ""the Centauri.""  He chose to help Londo, because the aims he had didn't end with the fall of a single world.  He thought Londo would keep making war with the rest of the galaxy.  When Londo lost his nerve, Morden turned to Refa."
babylon5,dg7w3,keithjr,1 point,Fri Sep 24 18:17:21 2010 UTC,"But it works both ways.  The Shadows allying themselves with the Narns would also have hidden the threat to the Shadows.  That's the beauty of it.   Morden didn't choose to help ""the Centauri."" He chose to help Londo, because the aims he had didn't end with the fall of a single world. He thought Londo would keep making war with the rest of the galaxy. When Londo lost his nerve, Morden turned to Refa.   I agree with this.  But think of the hatred G'Kar had for the Centauri.  The Narns wouldn't have been content on just destroying the Centauri.  They would have ensured that no one would ever dare think the idea of attacking them ever again.  An entire civilization that has been beaten down and you give them that amount of power will surely be misused.  So yes, Morden did pick Londo.  He chose the best option.  If it were any other Narn, I think Morden would have had a tough decision.  Morden could have accomplished his goals either way.   Senator: It's all here.  But I don't have much to go on.  A little from the Narn.  Morden: Yes, well.  That's to be expected.  But I think we've neutralized that problem. Nothing else then?  Senator: Not that I can see.  The ship's a complete mystery to all of them.    Morden: Good!  My associates will be very happy to hear that.  There's no need to rush things.  Your government can dismiss this as an isolated incident.     So the direct message here is that Morden and the Shadows don't want anyone to know who they are.  Only the Narns have documented stories about those ships.  But there's an underlying theme.  Morden is talking about a ""problem"" (edit: with a Psy-cop sitting next to him).  It had to be dealt with.  There's something more than just knowledge of the existence of the Shadow ships.   G'Kar: They came to our world over a 1000 of your years ago.  Long before we went to the stars ourselves.  They set up a base on one of our southern continents.  They took little interest in us.  G'Quan believed they were engaged in a war far outside our own world. ...  G'Kar: This ship and your ship are the same.  I tried to warn the others that the ancient enemy was returning.  But no one listened.  Perhaps now they will.     We know that the Narns drove them away.  How did they do that?  The narns know!"

Morden actually gives both Londo and G'Kar what they wanted.  Londo wanted the greatness of the Centauri Republic to be restored, and G'Kar wanted revenge and for the Centauri to be ravaged and utterly destroyed.  Both of them get their wish.  I wouldn't be surprised if the territory Morden 'gives' the Centauri is pretty much the same as at the height of their empire - ""I want it all back the way it was.""  Again, this is what i love about B5; the smallest, subtlest things can be very important to watch out for."

babylon5,de215,IH8DwnvoteComplainrs,6,Wed Sep 15 06:17:29 2010 UTC,Watch the series in order.  ALL THE EPS including Sleeping in Light.  Moving that last ep is ridiculous.  Try to watch the movies afterward.  In the Beginning is actually really good.  So don't watch it before midway through season 4 as it contains lots of spoilers.

babylon5,de215,plbogen,3,Wed Sep 15 23:40:56 2010 UTC,"So in a nutshell, he says:   The Gathering Seasons 1-3 Season 4 up through 4x07 Thirdspace The rest of season 4 In The Beginning Season 5 except for the last episode River of Souls Legend of the Rangers A Call to Arms Crusade Sleeping in Light   It's an interesting viewing order, but it's overly thorough. The Gathering is unnecessary. Thirdspace is almost entirely self-contained, it can be watched pretty much any time after 3x11. In The Beginning is by far the best of the movies, and should be watched. It can be watched spoiler free any time after 4x09.  That's where I begin to take issue with this viewing order. I say, watch season 5, and forget about basically everything else. River of Souls, Legend of the Rangers, A Call To Arms, and Crusade are all optional. I wouldn't watch all of those before watching Sleeping in Light, even if it's chronologically correct.  ACtoA is actually pretty entertaining and Crusade has a few good episodes, so you can watch it if you want. But I wouldn't watch them before finishing the series proper.  River of Souls is pretty meh, IMO. Legend of the Rangers is terribad, it's only redeeming quality is G'kar as a guest star.  Basically, this is the most comprehensive, chronologically correct viewing order possible. It is not, IMO, the ideal viewing order.   FWIW, when recommending B5 to others, I usually go the other way: I trim, rather than be all-inclusive. Most of season 1 can be skipped, and there are a few S2 episodes worth skipping as well. Seasons 3 and 4 can be watched in their entirety (except for Grey 17 is Missing), and then about a third of Season 5 (the Byron eps) can be skipped as well. The only movie I recommend is ITB."

babylon5,de215,kraetos,2,Wed Sep 15 18:56:44 2010 UTC,The Telepath War should have been a cataclysmic world altering event. And in the show it just seemed so non-notable nothing.

That's the way I interpreted it though.  I actually liked the Byron/telepath episodes for the most part, but I can see why some people wouldn't. It did seem to be a little too small in scope, given what a large issue it was tackling in the B5 universe. Always remember though, when criticizing season 5, that JMS' hand was forced in many things since the higher ups were jerking him around about whether there was even going to BE a season 5. He thought the show was done, and then suddenly he had to start writing again because it wasn't. That's also why the finale of season 4 was so poor compared to the other season finales."

I think you're doing a disservice though if you recommend to people to skip big chunks of the series, even if it is in seasons 1 and 5. I mean there's an episode here and there like ""Infection"" or ""A View From The Gallery"" that are just eye rolling pointless, but even though 1 and 5 are the ""lesser seasons"" they still have important character development and setting development for the Babylon 5 universe.  So that's my take on it. Watch seasons 1-5 and then watch In The Beginning, Thirdspace, and River of Souls. That's the core of B5."
