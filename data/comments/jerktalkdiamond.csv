jerktalkdiamond,3dp6f2,NinetoFiveHero,3,Sat Jul 18 03:08:40 2015 UTC,I remember when my eyes took in this light differently It felt like I could see a beautiful tapestry Hanging over my eyelids imagining that I was a visionary exploring my own reality  I don't remember that carpet looking that way The sway The deep colored gray The way my feet felt sinking into its lush foliage all out for display  My dog seems strange to me right now Nothing bad Not any different More so because I'm wondering if he knows why I'm here wondering why he's here  I try to wrap my head around things but my head still remains hard with a shell that protects this weird organ That's reacting to this plant that grew in a shoe box from Oregon  When I close my eyes the world becomes make believe with flashing bright patterns and sound that's matching to the flicker of the candle in the Lantern  This world is exciting but fleeting Am I tripping or am I now finally just seeing?

Massage the area with oil or moisturiser. get tweezers and pull it out. to prevent them make sure skin is nicely lubed up before shaving. Heat grill to high and grill the bacon for 10 mins, turning halfway, until crisp. Cool for a few mins. Meanwhile, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line a baking sheet with parchment. Sift the flour and ½ tsp salt into a bowl, add the butter, then rub in to the texture of fine breadcrumbs. Cut the bacon into small pieces and add to the bowl with a third of the cheese. Mix the milk, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce in a jug. Pour into the bacon mixture, stirring briefly, to make a soft dough. Flour the work surface, turn the dough onto it and shape into an 18cm round. Brush with milk, then cut into 8 wedges with a large knife. Arrange the wedges on the baking sheet and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for 20-30 mins or until risen and golden brown, and serve warm (or cool on a wire rack, and store in an airtight container). Warm the bacon cakes through in a low oven (140C/120C fan/gas 1) if you’ve made them in advance.   Voila, your ingrown hair should be sorted."

jerktalkdiamond,3d5juh,ned_vanderton,2,Tue Jul 14 12:27:11 2015 UTC,"I propose a sitcom two young men from very different backgrounds, one from a wealthy family who has had the benefit of a private education to nurture his amazing intellect, and his best friend, a very clever young man from an impoverished family forced to work in the mines from an early age, discover a magic lamp with a teenaged female genie, who gets them into all kinds of slapstick and unpredictable adventures.

jerktalkdiamond,3d5juh,ned_vanderton,2,Tue Jul 14 12:38:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I made a mistake. 'génie mineur' cannot mean 'underage miner'. That would be 'mineur mineur'.  So please read this before pitching the idea to FX.  We could keep the same idea but retitle it ""Génie Génie*, Mineur Mineur, et Génie Mineur"".  Maybe GG (Génie Génie, the protagonist) loses his wealth if he uses a kitchen sink and MM (Mineur Mineur, the comic of the show) loses his mining ability if he uses a bathroom sink. This could lead to hilarious situation where MM tries to was his dirty coal hands but forgets which room he's in because of the dangerous vapors of the mine.  At the end of every episode, GM (General Motors, the sponsor of the show) warns the reader of the difference between éviers and robinets.  We could go further and call Génie Génie ""Eugène"", Mineur Mineur ""Norton"". The various sinks also have names: the évier is Kevin and the robinet is Robin.

jerktalkdiamond,3cwr3a,ned_vanderton,3,Sat Jul 11 14:18:53 2015 UTC,I didn't read the article this time. Is it really salty?
jerktalkdiamond,3cwr3a,numberonepaofan,2,Sat Jul 11 14:54:00 2015 UTC,"*nods respectfully*  Edit: salty and pretentious. While also implying some dumb things (e.g. you're not a le Real Nerd™ if you don't conform to my idea of one / dae ). It also over-analyzes some stupid shit that's not even worth talking about... Really depends what kind of voice you associate with it when reading. It does use a lot of swear words for no other reason besides either being mad or edgy.  Edit 2: clarity  Edit 3: best part!   The model above looks like she has the choice to have lots of sex. She's probably not a nerd. Not fair? Well neither is being born attractive. Let the nerds have something. Not everyone was born with good looks or enough power & wealth to compensate. If you have to tell people you're a nerd, chances are you're not. Nerds don't have to advertise their status. We know. Being a nerd is a byproduct of losing yourself in what you do, often at the expense of friends, family and hygiene. Until or unless you've paid your dues, you haven't earned the right—or reason—to call yourself a nerd. Being a nerd isn't graceful or glorious. It's a life born out of obsessive dedication to a craft, discipline or collecting some stupid shit that only you care about.  If you think geeks are so sexy or cool, bang one. Go to any university and find a computer or physics lab at 2AM and take your pick. Until then, go commit cultural fraud someplace else, and take your phony ""I fucking love science"" group with you.   Still, YMMV. Plus I guess now I'm the one over-analyzes things for no reason. Hurray.  Edit 4: almost forgot /r/lewrongfacebookpage   Any time I see people on Facebook simultaneously liking ""iCarly, One Direction"" and ""The Pauly D Project"" while also liking fucking loving science, it raises some red flags."

I hope you realize how stupid this sounds, and how much it degrades your reputability despite having a diagnosed brother.   once upon a time, it was normal for people to ""ramble"" about music theory or free markets. in fact, those were both good discussion points for all but the stupid and poor in the era before TV. we as a progressive culture have attacked these ""oppressive"" and ""boring"" qualities. your father's generation was the first generation which totally turned off their ability to question the norm, discuss rationally things which aren't PC   Cultural marxism feminism blah. If you want to blame anything for cultural decline, blame interconnectivity. That is far more plausible than progressives planning how to feminize the boys or whatever it is you're thinking.  I don't disagree that people care about dumb shit, talk about dumb shit, and lead pointless lives. That it is not a product of some plot. People are just stupid.   as an example, my brother was diagnosed as being on the spectrum when he was 16. his life went downhill so fast after the diagnosis that he had to move out from mom's and move in with dad. his ""aspbergers"" disappeared very quickly and he learned to play guitar and juggle within 6 months, two things that his diagnosis had told him he would never be able to do. he is now totally normal, just a person who read as a teen and able to discuss things as an adult (unlike most brainwashed, PC adults today)   Clearly this is a much longer story than you had space to write, I'm keeping that in mind. Your brother's case sounds very odd, people do not usually rapidly manifest the traits at an age like 16. You're born autistic, it is often clear by early schooling - presuming the school and the parents know what to look for, which they often don't. And you don't typically stop manifesting all at once either, there's something missing here. Maybe something troubled him, something that even he wasn't totally aware of, I can only conjecture. What is know is that people don't just become and then stop being autistic in a switch like manner.  In addition, you've got this idea that diagnosis is a death sentence. He wasn't diagnosed, and maybe he could learn things - then he's diagnosed and BAM it's not gonna happen. As he demonstrated, people adapt and pull through. The diagnosis is not an unclimbable wall, it is just pointing out and labeling a barrier that was already there. I'm glad that he's able to function, people care too much about fitting in or being normal and not enough about just being able to get by and be happy."

It convinces them that they are helpless victims of Fish people so they might as well not even try to fix their problems or improve their communities. It takes away accountability and power for Squids to improve their lives. People love it though, because it means they don't have to accept responsibility for their lot in life."

Irony is the use of words expressing something other than their literal intention. So by saying somebody misused the word 'irony', you're essentially saying they didn't use the literal meaning of the word irony, and thus you're missing the fact that they were being ironic (according to the definition I gave). Of course, your missing the irony while correcting someone for their misunderstanding of irony is ironic.

jerktalkdiamond,3bi49d,UnluckyLuke,5,Mon Jun 29 13:51:50 2015 UTC,"wow where to start with this thread.  you my friend are a victim of the tragedy of the commons culture. you live in a ""progressive"" society where dissent from the religion of progressivism and statism is totally disallowed. rather than burning the witches, we diagnose them with ""aspbergers"" which just means we can ignore everything these people have to say.  once upon a time, it was normal for people to ""ramble"" about music theory or free markets. in fact, those were both good discussion points for all but the stupid and poor in the era before TV. we as a progressive culture have attacked these ""oppressive"" and ""boring"" qualities. your father's generation was the first generation which totally turned off their ability to question the norm, discuss rationally things which aren't PC  as an example, my brother was diagnosed as being on the spectrum when he was 16. his life went downhill so fast after the diagnosis that he had to move out from mom's and move in with dad. his ""aspbergers"" disappeared very quickly and he learned to play guitar and juggle within 6 months, two things that his diagnosis had told him he would never be able to do. he is now totally normal, just a person who read as a teen and able to discuss things as an adult (unlike most brainwashed, PC adults today)"

Anyway we meet his neighbors and his neighbors are Southern Christian and when they found out he was gay, they were really rude about it, up to the point of calling him an abomination, so he pulls me inside and says what they said to him, I turn around and lets piss him off by pretending were a couple and saying and doing kinky shit (""Babe don't come in here I'm changing"",""Why wouldn't be the first time ive seen you naked"" and he started to rub my shoulders in an extremely sexual way in front of them and look on their faces was priceless so we finish getting the smaller stuff moved in.we went to bed at eleven and the bed was the biggest thing we were able to move in so we shared a bed(no we didn't do anything sexual) so he looks at me and says ""we should piss them off one more time"" I'm like ""how "". He said I should scream something sexual. So at the top of my lungs I scream "" Squeal little piggy, I'm your daddy now!"" We laughed for forty fucking minutes at that shit. 10 years later and we're still fucking savages"

jerktalkdiamond,3ampr6,swiley1983,2,Mon Jun 22 04:06:41 2015 UTC,"9 years ago .....a person named Jerry got dared to sleep in a house that  was believed to be haunted. The next day his friends waited for him  outside the house....They had to go inside and search for him. They went through every room but the attic. He wasn't suppose to sleep in the attic. He was suppose to sleep in the living  room they went to the attic. They found Jerry's corpse and they left  because they got scared. But that night all died because of their  friend. He killed them all for making him sleep in the house if you  don't send this to 11 comments you will die tonight by Jerry.Example 1: a man named stewart read this and didnt believe it. He shut off his  computer and went through his day . That night while he was in bed he  heard something out his door. He got up to look his dead now. Example  2:a girl named Haley read this in the morning and she got scared but  didn't send it . She wanted to know if it was true. She went to school ( she was only 13 years old) and that night she died. If you dont post  this to 11 comments tonight Jerry will 'visit' you and he isn't fake.  Apparently if you copy and paste this to 11 comments in the next ten  minutes you will have the best day of your life tomorrow. You will  either get kissed or asked out, if you brake this chain you will see a  little dead girl in your room tonight. In the next 53 minutes someone  will say I love you or I'm Sorry"

jerktalkdiamond,3altaz,totesnot1bubneb,5,Sun Jun 21 14:04:59 2015 UTC,"When Walt was a child, he devoted most of his time to injuring small animals. Imagine sid from toy Story, but with animals. He had a burlap sack full of bizarre tools he would use to implement this pain. A magnifying glass, kebab skewers, an old door knob tied to a candy necklace. Just weird stuff. Anyway, he would go to local parks and capture animals, ""mostly mice and rabbits because they had a pretentious look about them,"" he was quoted as saying. Once he had them in his second burlap sack he would take them to his father's garage's garage (he came from a wealthy family) and impose his will on the poor creatures. One of his favorite things to do was pet the rabbit and feed it carrots, like really befriend it, make it think he loved it, and then out if nowhere pet the mouse and feed it cheese in front of the rabbit, and totally ignore him to make him jealous, I mean just really fucking disgusting stuff. His parents would cry from the house ""Walt, you need to come inside for dinner!"" and he would often respond sarcastically, ""din'her I hardley know her!"" to which his parents would laugh. Anyways, one day when he was twelve he got the biggest haul of his life from the park; a three pound rabbit and an enormous mouse. He put them in the burlap sack, brought them back to the garage's garage, emptied his wares on the table and went to work. I mean he put some serious time into making this rabbit jealous. He had over seven pounds of cheese to feed this mouse, and three copies of flowers for algernon to read to him. He was about midway through the first copy when he realized there was something strange going on with the mouse. Whenever he would touch his nose the mouse would instantly fall asleep, but if he touched his ear the mouse would stand on one leg. He thought this was really weird and wanted to experiment. If he touched his left ear, the mouse would stand on its left leg. If he touched his right ear the mouse would stand on its right leg. Poor Walt thought that if he touched both ears at the same time the mouse would be able to fly. He tried this, and of course the mouse wasn't able to take flight. Walt thought maybe the mouse couldn't see him touching his ears, so he crafted a black earhat (now synonymous with Disney world) to wear for his experiments. It turned out that it wasn't actually a mouse, but a small child. Now you may be thinking ""Okay so he threw a small child into a sack and force-fed him cheese for several hours and continually read him the same book, big deal."" well the child was lactose intolerant and began relieving himself all over the garage's garage. To the point that it would have taken several hours to clean. Remember his parents came from money, and when they saw the mess they didn't feel like cleaning it and told Walt ""it was up to him, this is now your garage. This is Walt Disney world."" you may be wondering why his parents wouldn't just pay someone to clean it? They didn't believe in maids, and often associated them with the likes of the easter bunny, despite being presented with very damming evidence. A strange family, really."

Even if he doesn't notice me now, I will always love him with more than what my heart had to offer. After I started living my life up to loving GH and needing him in my life, Then my sister found out, she started teasing me saying that ""he will never love you, go out with you, or even marry you, so stop trying"". I was in tears. But I just knew that it could come true, and that I just want to say i love you sooooo sooo soooooo much! You are my inspiration, my everything, my reason I'm still here today. GH, if you ever read this thank you so much for me still being alive today, without you I would be in heaven, I love you so much. I need you, Live your dreams GH.

But now you can get Young Ones DVD's on amazon.de so I guess everything worked itself out. I'll send my piece of the wall back with a bucket of cement so they can get started.

You will really hate me if you read this, just warning you. Basically I hate my wifes 11 year old son and always have. I dont even call him my step son. She is his mistake and I want nothing to do with him. I exclude him from our family in every way you can imagine- we go for a walk he doesnt come, dont have any pictures of him, he eats dinner in his room while we are at the table, dont talk to him except to say hes doing something wrong. I truly hate him in the sense that i wish he would die. hes fat and ugly. its almost like a rejection of his genes. I hate his giant ears that stick out. I hate his lisp. I hate his big belly, fat ass, and boy boobs. he looks like a monkey. i hate his squeaky voice that never shuts up. hes not smart at all either, has ADD and constantly talks. Theres a thousand reasons I hate him. they are all just judgments and I dont know how to rid myself of them. I dont want to think these thoughts. divorce is inevitable if not. I just dont know how to look at him and not see a failure, a mistake, a reject, a fat, clumsy, stupid, ugly idiot. I hate myself too for thinking these thoughts. I dont know what to do but every time I try to connect with him he gets shrouded by this hateful judgment. I can literally feel them in my brain, like the rotten neurons or something. I have to either accept him exactly as he is or get divorced and the whole mess that follows. Has anyone dealt with anything similar? I've gone to therapy, didnt help. Its like I involuntarily hate him, and would rather not but can't stop."

At the time, there was a novelty account in cj, /u/GEM_OR_NOT_GEM. Some guy decided to parody this account and made /u/DIAMOND_OR_NOT_DIAMO. This guy is diamo.  At the time, there was this sub, /u/jerktalk. Some guy decided to parody this sub and made /u/jerktalkdiamond. This guy wasn't diamo.  Jtd was private. Whenever somebody made a comment, anywhere on Reddit, which included the word 'diamond', there was a 33% chance they'd become an approved submitter.  I am assuming that because of diamo's novelty account nature, he used the word diamond a lot. His account is deleted, but if you take a look at /u/GEM_OR_NOT_GEM, all of his comments include the word 'GEM'. So diamo become an approved submitter of jtd.  Since then, the admins have asked jtd to stop using the diamond bot because of spam. Now it's public. As for diamo, his second account was /u/Ian32 and his current account is.../u/FrenchFagsCantQueue. I'm not sure if he viva'd or got sb'd.  I am assuming that a lot of people didn't know who diamo was for some reason, so 'who is diamo' became a sort of inside joke.

jerktalkdiamond,37ymbs,NinetoFiveHero,6,Sun May 31 22:55:35 2015 UTC,"Come to terms with the fact that the way you, an adult, are thinking and behaving towards a child, can become abusive if it isn't already. You have power over him being older and his stepfather and your thoughts and actions have impact. Children are able to detect these subtle indications better than people think, whether one tries to hide it well or not, and that can affect how he behaves around you. How he acts around and towards you can be a reaction to how you display yourself towards him, and so it cycles.  Have you been mentally evaluated by another therapist or a psychiatrist? It sounds as if you may have intrusive thoughts, especially if you don't mean to have them like you say. Cognitive therapy could be a starting point to look into.  It's possible that you may be projecting as well. Were you anything like him as a child? Or made to be hateful of or afraid to become someone like him as a child? Or perhaps conditioned to not be all the things you think he is? For example, parents that push their kids to be athletic out of fear that the child will become fat will overlap onto the child's mindset and may cause the child to react negatively to children who are fat, as if they aren't trying as hard as they are. Do you project your own insecurities onto him in such a way? If so, it may be good to start there and resolve these ingrained issues that you may have. Question why you hate fat people, people you deem ""stupid"" (whether they are disabled or not), ugliness, failure, etc. When you start to unpack this kind of thinking, your perspective on him, others, and yourself may change.  EDIT: The way you loop thoughts about all the negative things you see in him over and over only encourages you to become less and less empathetic towards him, thinking of him as only a thing to hate instead of a person with feelings and thoughts he may not be able to effectively express due to age, disability, self-consciousness, or abuse. Especially towards someone overtly or covertly hostile to him. Be conscious that these hateful thoughts will happen and that you cannot always stop them, but you can be aware of them when they happen and challenge them."
jerktalkdiamond,37ymbs,ned_vanderton,4,Sun May 31 15:14:35 2015 UTC,You're right. I hate you. You are treating this child like he isn't human and are raising him to be a nonproductive member of society. Divorce his mom. I hope he gets therapy.

Son ok, bastante sexy supongo, a menudo fapeo a ellos cuando mi conección internet no funciona. De repente, no recibí nada más fotos (ni PMs tampóco). Despues aprendé que unos chicos más viejos forzó que diámo desnuda por webcam. Por esto fue bulliado, y se suicidó."

jerktalkdiamond,37caxd,UnluckyLuke,2,Tue May 26 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's a shorter rendering of my lost message:  Is Seinfeld really a 5 on that scale? That would mean that it supports roughly the same strength of continuity as Community and Parks and Rec.  I probably will try Seinfeld at some point, like some time down the road. For one season, at first. However, considering it has sociopaths as its main characters, I may not be able to watch it all the way through. I can't seem to stick with a show if I don't care about the people in it. I dropped Family Guy and American Dad for similar reasons, among others (like the zero (or, as TVTropes would say, 'Negative' continuity thing, and that they never change in essense - which, again, are not bad things, but stuff like that is just not my cup of tee right now). Does any character dev. happen in Seinfeld?  Archer is a special case for me... The mc's are awful people - but there is, arguably, at least trace amounts of character development and it has a mildly strong continuity.  On a related note: I beep-booped the first season of Always Sunny in the past couple of days, and it was pretty funny but also kinda depressing. There is no notable progress between episodes so far (I'm sick of using the word continuity, so progress it is)... Is there any character development ahead at all? I wouldn't expect.  Also, I'm trying Arrested Dev next; wish me luck!"
jerktalkdiamond,37caxd,TrollaBot,2,Tue May 26 23:39:22 2015 UTC,"Is Seinfeld really a 5 on that scale? That would mean that it supports roughly the same strength of continuity as Community    Well what's Community's continuity?  Relationships lasting several episodes (Slater, Vaughn, or Jeff-Britta and Annie). Seinfeld has that to a lesser extent.  Main characters disappearing? Willow's Simpsons has that but it's a 0.  Story arcs? Not really  Mild change of setting every year? Seinfeld doesn't have that because the setting they chose don't require that.   I  considering it has sociopaths as its main characters, I may not be able to watch it all the way through. I can't seem to stick with a show if I don't care about the people in it.    That last sentence is a quote from Seinfeld!  The characters aren't sociopath. They're selfish. But believe me they're relatable as they go through a bunch of common everyday situations and give them a name.   Does any character dev. happen in Seinfeld   I would have to say no. I can probably name three story arcs tho.   Is there any character development ahead at all? I wouldn't expect. (IASIP)   Yes. They become worse and worse people. Their flaws (there's a big one for each character) become bigger. They address this in The Gang misses the boat   Also, I'm trying Arrested Dev next; wish me luck!   Good luck!"

In my experience, reactiongifs doesn't like reposts at all (which is fine). My posts are always downvoted immediately.  The most ""profitable ones"" are the aww-types. I mean animals are really cute!  One thing I've also noticed is that people who call me out as a reposter often say ""I don't mind the repost but you didn't even bother changing the title. Lazy fuck"". I respect their opinions but I don't get why they want me to change a title which was good enough last time. However I always try to change it if the first OP said something like ""my dog did this"" or ""I saw this"" cause I don't want to lie."

jerktalkdiamond,36knip,ned_vanderton,2,Wed May 20 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"The mystery of ULTRAFRENCH is both simple and divine. French is mostly French. But English is also mostly French. Québecois either birthed ULTRAFRENCH or developed alongside it (I don't do historical linguistics, and it's still an open question). We all know Québecois is just English speakers trying to speak French, so it just ends up sounding like your Freshman French class. But in ULTRAFRENCH a separate phenomenon occurred. ULTRAFRENCH was, in the beginning, entirely conventional French while also borrowing at least half of itself from English. So by a conservative estimate (since English is 3/4ths French), ULTRAFRENCH is at least 125% French."

But we never got paid for any of the work we did, so that did not really make sense, it was just a mean thing to say."

Seems to me it's not all that different from episodecalendar, although it does seem to have a much bigger social aspect to it.  Edit: apparently I can't just import my data from Episodecalendar, I'd have to do it manually. I guess I'm sticking to EC for now."

jerktalkdiamond,3677kq,awall621,5,Sat May 16 20:55:05 2015 UTC,"Speaking of which, what do people have against the gaming industry?  Nothing, actually. The whole ""Valve = bad"" thing is a meme, not in the funny picture on the internet sense, but for many Steam users, it has become an essential part of their cultural capital. I can guarantee you that most people who share this ""fuck Gaben"" mindset do it only because everyone else does it, and not because he's actually hurting their personal experience in gaming. Most of these guys know about Rockstar's decision to ban mods and that's about it. Hell, Rockstar released their GTAV PC port a month ago, so it's not like they're a major moving force in the gaming industry. Nowdays they're not even the edgy, cool, gritty game studio they used to be, they're pretty much portrayed in the media as cocky douchebags, and they have more influence on celebrity-gossip journalism than video games.  The people who go out of their way to show how much they hate paid mods aren't expressing their genuine distaste, they're are using the internet as an echo chamber. By doing so, they aim to achieve the following: Belonging to a community. It feels nice and warm inside when people agree with you, so, they post this kind of content, because there will be guaranteed positive feedback.  Feeling unique. As this ""generation of video games is fucked"", they become the victims, the outcasts, the misunderstood snowflakes. It's a comfortable position to be in, because all your moaning and whining is automatically validated.  Feeling superior. You know, they are victims and outcasts only because they have a clearly better approach and preferences when it comes to video games. In their skewed worldview, free modding are the ultimate defining factor of a game's potential and value, so they automatically assume that they are superior in every sense.  It's not about Gaben or Valve's customers anymore, it's about themselves. Look, how much better I am than... whoever they imagine the ""norm""."

The 4 color theorem state that you can always color a map with 4 colors so that no two same-colored regions are juxtaposed. This map uses 7 colors yet some states have the same color as their neighbors. This is just bad cartography.

jerktalkdiamond,35xxhg,no_turn_unstoned,3,Thu May 14 13:17:34 2015 UTC,"Straight to Hell (film):       Straight to Hell is a 1987 independent action-comedy film directed by Alex Cox, and starring Sy Richardson, Joe Strummer (frontman of The Clash), Dick Rude, and Courtney Love. The film also features cameos by Dennis Hopper, Grace Jones, Elvis Costello, and Jim Jarmusch. Band members of The Pogues, Amazulu, and The Circle Jerks are also featured in the film. The film's title is based on The Clash's 1982 song of the same name.  The film has been called a parody of Spaghetti Westerns,  and focuses on a gang of criminals who become stranded in the desert, where they stumble upon a surreal Western town full of coffee-addicted killers. The film is based on Giulio Questi's Spaghetti Western film, Django, Kill! (If You Live, Shoot!) (1967), which Cox was given permission to adapt.   Straight to Hell received few positive reviews upon release, and was not a commercial success, although it later gained something of a cult film status.  A soundtrack was also released. On 14 December 2010, an extended cut of the film, titled Straight to Hell Returns, was released on DVD, featuring additional footage and digitally enhanced picture quality.  This version of the film, under the collaboration of Alex Cox, was also screened at several cinemas as part of a midnight movie theatrical run.

jerktalkdiamond,35dxf7,itmustbemitch,2,Sat May 9 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"Macklemore flipped on his flashlight, illuminating the dark hallways of Le Gay Thrift Store. He reclined in his computer chair, kicking his feet up onto the desk. The phone rang, static briefly cloaking Phone Guy’s voice.  “Hello? Hellooo? I’m assuming you’ve picked up...You know you’re the third guy to accept this job, uh, on account of the other guys who took up the ad in the paper...A-Anyways-” he clears his throat. “I’ve left everything you need to know in the filing cabinet on your left by the desk. I-If you got any questions, give me a ring, alright?” The phone beeps twice before falling silent once more.  “Shit, the pay was only ninety-nine cents.” Macklemore muttered to himself. He flipped up his laptop screen, the room being bathed in a dim blue glow. His eyes scanned over the various camera emplacements, the whirring of gears and gyros humming into the microphone. The rooms of the establishment were properly emptied and set for tomorrow’s entourage of merriment from children and adults alike. The camera spun around sluggishly, Macklemore taking in every detail of the dining hall. He switched over to the stage area, the animatronics motionless. Macklemore cringed at their sight, slightly startled by the souless eyes each posessed. It felt like they were staring right through him, and it made him a bit paranoid.  “I’m sure these things’ll stay put until morning.” Macklemore reassured himself. He closed his laptop, unscrewing the cap to his Gatorade™ Fruit Punch™ Thirst Revitalisor™. The bottle nearly reached his lips before he stayed his hand.  Macklemore slowly flipped open the lid to his laptop, hesitantly checking on the stage once more.  The rabbit moved.  Macklemore had to double take before closing the computer in a frantic rush. Muffled footsteps could be heard down the left hallway leading to his security room. He rushed to the door controls and slapped his hand onto the button. The heavy metal door whooshed shut with a hard thunk. He snickered aloud, clapping his hands. Macklemore plopped back down onto his chair, taking a large swig from his Gator-AIDS™ drink.  “I’m hella happy these fuckin’ doors work! It ain’t costin’ me shit!” he exclaimed. A sudden banging arose from the opposite side of the door, and Macklemore flinched. He impulsively threw his bottle of juice at the door, the open container splashing across the face of the barricade.  “M-Muh drink…” he stuttered. The room became eerily silent once more. He crept up from his chair, hesitantly making his way to the door.  “I’m pickin’ the lock!” a voice called from beyond. The heavy metal door rose back into it’s open position, a fancily dressed man standing in the doorway. A pistol was pointed at his forehead and he panicked.  “Get down on the ground!” the suit clad man shouted. Macklemore was confused, his hands shaking. The stranger rushed into the room with a police baton in hand, beating him profusely. “I said get DOWN!” he continued to yell.  Macklemoney threw his arms over his head to lessen the blows to his well being, feeling his radius and ulna cracking under the repeated strikes. He knelt down in fetal position, still being struck continuously.  “I’m pickin’ the lock!” Wolf said aloud. He flipped Minglemorgy over onto his back, bruises covering his face and arms. Wolf held a lock pick and screwdriver in his hands, hovering over his belt. He stuffed the screwdriver under his belt, unbuckling the straps with unearthly ease. Macklemingle started sobbing, tears streaming down his cheeks as he was flipped over once more with his bum in the air. The professional bank robber yanked down Minglemongles work pants, uzipping his own pants. Wolf thrust his hips forward, penetrating Macklemore’s exposed bum. Macklemore yelled out in pain, squeezing his eyes shut to hide the pain. Wolf forcefully pumped his hips into Macklemore, grunting and groaning audibly. “Keep drilling, you piece of shit!” he yelled in his thick foreign accent.  Wolf stopped abruptly, pointing to the open doorway. Ryan Lewis stood in the open portal with his authentic Freddy Fazbear head on and a lit marijuana meme bong in his hand.  “Damn, that’s a cold ass honkey.” he simply said."

She doesn't respond with anything meaningful for a reason and she's not interested in you. Who am I? The man whom she is in love with. She already told me not to worry, she's not interested in you. Sorry I bothered you kid. I've dated her since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my woman or being inappropriate I don't care if you snap her occasionally. Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me. We are in love and we're making love tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with my woman you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best she's ever had, only man she's ever loved and the only man who could truly satisfy her physically. You will never have her. And she loves me. I don't have any problems with you if you are over my woman and realize you will never be with or touch her again. I apologize for coming off as a dick, just me and kenna are really deep in love and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man she used to date before me is snap chatting her.... We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask friend. If you try to talk to her any way but as a brother, or you try to see her at all, if she tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict brother like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem. I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the woman who I love and whom is in love with me. That entire summer she was with me. She left kyle for me. She's been with me ever since, she even loved me and made love to me before she EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please her. She didn't have strong feelings for you at all. And she immediately ended shit with you for me once she knew I loved her too. So get any ideas of the past out of your head. None of this truth should bug you if you're over her but I'm just making sure. I hate when my baby's friends have ill intentions and she thinks they are just friends and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all. If I can trust you to not stress me and my baby or fuck with our love tell me. I will leave you alone and apologize. But if you aren't over her and you're tryna ""get some"" or you're tryna get back in her life, it's NOT HAPPENING. She said you were nothing to her, and the sex was bad anyway haha. You're small and weak and she said it all felt wrong after being with me. She's been with me ever since. We're in love. And tomorrow me and her will be together in my room making love alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a man or tell me our love doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple. So??? What is it? You are after my woman then huh?! Tell me the fucking truth man. Don't you dare be disrespectful and gross enough to bring it up, but if if you ask her about anything she shared with me about your weak ass, she may be nice and lie to you, or she may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm her soullmate and her boyfriend of the past two years almost. And she tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my kenna. I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make moves with my woman. And i respect you as a guy in the service. I'm sure you're an ok dude. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my kenna but a brother like friend. I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it. Find a nice classy woman where you are stationed, marry her.... But back off of mine. You will never even compare to me in her eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and kenna's love. It's our lives man. It's really not cool.... Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in the service. Sorry to bring your day down with my crazy bullshit but. Me and kenna are head over heels.... I can't help but be crazy about her. I love her with all of my heart and I will protect her from her untrustworthy fake friends. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your head so I'm questioning a lot right now. Just know I'm never gonna hurt her, I'm always going to have her back, I'd give my life for her without hesitation, and I will protect her from anything, everything, and anyone. She is the love of my life. I fully intend to marry and give kenna my children. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is. I just moved back and me and her miss eachother so badly and we are FINALLY go to see eachother tomorrow and make love for the first time since halloween.... I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good dude. Just protective of the woman who holds my heart. And who's heart I hold and must protect. I hope you can understand. She promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that she's not interested:""/ I wish I knew before I embarrassingly went off on you. I'm so sorry man. I'm sorry. Please don't mention this to my baby:/ I'm really embarrassed and while she will understand, I just feel like an ass for attacking you when you have nothing with my kenna and no intention to. Good bye brother. I hope you find your one true love someday. It'll make you crazy, trust me, but you'll find her one day. I found mine when I was really young. And it's my kenna :)"

I don’t have much time, he said. I looked him in the eye again. There could be no doubt about it: he had the eyes of my idol. And his reply: I don’t have much time. How many doors it opened! How many paths were suddenly cleared, revealed to me!  “I don’t have much time, I have to haul corpses. I don’t have much time, I have to breathe, eat, drink, sleep. I don’t have much time, I have to keep the gears meshing. I don’t have much time, I’m busy living. I don’t have much time, I’m busy dying. As you can imagine, there were no more questions. I helped him open the locker. I wanted to help him slide the corpse in, but my clumsiness was such that the sheet slipped and then I saw the face of the corpse and I closed my eyes and bowed my head and let him work in peace.  “When my friend came out he watched me from the door in silence. Everything all right? he asked. I couldn’t answer, or didn’t know how to answer. Maybe I said: everything’s wrong. But that wasn’t what I meant to say.”"
jerktalkdiamond,34trsy,puripurihakase,2,Mon May 4 19:19:08 2015 UTC,rivetting  tell me more
jerktalkdiamond,34trsy,puripurihakase,2,Mon May 4 19:21:06 2015 UTC,"“I was a writer,” said the old man.  “But I gave it up. This typewriter was a gift from my father. An affectionate and cultured man who lived to the age of ninety-three. An essentially good man. A man who believed in progress, it goes without saying. My poor father. He believed in progress and of course he believed in the intrinsic goodness of human beings. I too believe in the intrinsic goodness of human beings, but it means nothing. In their hearts, killers are good, as we Germans have reason to know. So what? I might spend a night drinking with a killer, and as the two of us watch the sun come up, perhaps we’ll burst into song or hum some Beethoven. So what? The killer might weep on my shoulder. Naturally. Being a killer isn’t easy, as you and I well know. It isn’t easy at all. It requires purity and will, will and purity. Crystalline purity and steel-hard will. And I myself might even weep on the killer’s shoulder and whisper sweet words to him, words like ‘brother,’ ‘friend,’ ‘comrade in misfortune.’ At this moment the killer is good, because he’s intrinsically good, and I’m an idiot, because I’m intrinsically an idiot, and we’re both sentimental, because our culture tends inexorably toward sentimentality. But when the performance is over and I’m alone, the killer will open the window of my room and come tiptoeing in like a nurse and slit my throat, bleed me dry.  “My poor father. I was a writer, I was a writer, but my indolent, voracious brain gnawed at my own entrails. Vulture of my Prometheus self or Prometheus of my vulture self, one day I understood that I might go so far as to publish excellent articles in magazines and newspapers, and even books that weren’t unworthy of the paper on which they were printed. But I also understood that I would never manage to create anything like a masterpiece. You may say that literature doesn’t consist solely of masterpieces, but rather is populated by so-called minor works. I believed that, too. Literature is a vast forest and the masterpieces are the lakes, the towering trees or strange trees, the lovely, eloquent flowers, the hidden caves, but a forest is also made up of ordinary trees, patches of grass, puddles, clinging vines, mushrooms, and little wild-flowers. I was wrong. There’s actually no such thing as a minor work. I mean: the author of the minor work isn’t Mr. X or Mr. Y. Mr. X and Mr. Y do exist, there’s no question about that, and they struggle and toil and publish in newspapers and magazines and sometimes they even come out with a book that isn’t unworthy of the paper it’s printed on, but those books or articles, if you pay close attention, are not written by them.  “Every minor work has a secret author and every secret author is, by definition, a writer of masterpieces. Who writes the minor work? A minor writer, or so it appears. The poor man’s wife can testify to that, she’s seen him sitting at the table, bent over the blank pages, restless in his chair, his pen racing over the paper. The evidence would seem to be incontrovertible. But what she’s seen is only the outside. The shell of literature. A semblance,” said the old man to Archimboldi and Archimboldi thought of Ansky. “The person who really writes the minor work is a secret writer who accepts only the dictates of a masterpiece.  “Our good craftsman writes. He’s absorbed in what takes shape well or badly on the page. His wife, though he doesn’t know it, is watching him. It really is he who’s writing. But if his wife had X-ray vision she would see that instead of being present at an exercise of literary creation, she’s witnessing a session of hypnosis. There’s nothing inside the man who sits there writing. Nothing of himself, I mean. How much better off the poor man would be if he devoted himself to reading. Reading is pleasure and happiness to be alive or sadness to be alive and above all it’s knowledge and questions. Writing, meanwhile, is almost always empty. There’s nothing in the guts of the man who sits there writing. Nothing, I mean to say, that his wife, at a given moment, might recognize. He writes like someone taking dictation. His novel or book of poems, decent, adequate, arises not from an exercise of style or will, as the poor unfortunate believes, but as the result of an exercise of concealment. There must be many books, many lovely pines, to shield from hungry eyes the book that really matters, the wretched cave of our misfortune, the magic flower of winter!  “Excuse the metaphors. Sometimes, in my excitement, I wax romantic. But listen. Every work that isn’t a masterpiece is, in a sense, a part of a vast camouflage. You’ve been a soldier, I imagine, and you know what I mean. Every book that isn’t a masterpiece is cannon fodder, a slogging foot soldier, a piece to be sacrificed, since in multiple ways it mimics the design of the masterpiece. When I came to this realization, I gave up writing. Still, my mind didn’t stop working. In fact, it worked better when I wasn’t writing. I asked myself: why does a masterpiece need to be hidden? what strange forces wreath it in secrecy and mystery?  “By now I knew it was pointless to write. Or that it was worth it only if one was prepared to write a masterpiece. Most writers are deluded or playing. Perhaps delusion and play are the same thing, two sides of the same coin. The truth is we never stop being children, terrible children covered in sores and knotty veins and tumors and age spots, but ultimately children, in other words we never stop clinging to life because we are life. One might also say: we’re theater, we’re music. By the same token, few are the writers who give up. We play at believing ourselves immortal. We delude ourselves in the appraisal of our own works and in our perpetual misappraisal of the works of others. See you at the Nobel, writers say, as one might say: see you in hell.  “Once I saw an American gangster movie. In one scene a detective kills a crook and before he fires the fatal shot he says: see you in hell. He’s playing. The detective is playing and he’s deluded. The crook, who meets his gaze and curses him just before he dies, is also playing and deluded, although his fields of play and delusion have been reduced to almost zero, since in the next shot he’s going to die. The director of the film is also playing. So is the scriptwriter. See you at the Nobel. We’ll go down in history. We have the gratitude of the German people. A heroic battle remembered for generations to come. An immortal love. A name inscribed in marble. The time of the Muses. Even a phrase as seemingly innocent as echoes of Greek prose is all play and delusion.  “Play and delusion are the blindfold and spur of minor writers. Also: the promise of their future happiness. A forest that grows at a vertiginous rate, a forest no one can fence in, not even the academies, in fact, the academies make sure it flourishes unhindered, as do boosters and universities (breeding grounds for the shameless) and government institutions and patrons and cultural associations and declaimers of poetry— all aid the forest to grow and hide what must be hidden, all aid the forest to reproduce what must be reproduced, since the process is inevitable, though no one ever sees what exactly is being reproduced, what is being tamely mirrored back.  “Plagiarism, you say? Yes, plagiarism, in the sense that all minor works, all works from the pen of a minor writer, can be nothing but plagiarism of some masterpiece. The small difference is that here we’re talking about sanctioned plagiarism. Plagiarism as camouflage as some wood and canvas scenery as a charade that leads us, likely as not, into the void.  “In a word: experience is best. I won’t say you can’t get experience by hanging around libraries, but libraries are second to experience. Experience is the mother of science, it is often said. When I was young and I still thought I would make a career in the world of letters, I met a great writer. A great writer who had probably written a single masterpiece, although in my judgment everything he had written was a masterpiece.  “I won’t tell you his name. It’ll do you no good to learn it, nor do you need to know it for the purposes of this story. Suffice it to say that he was German and one day he came to Cologne to give a few lectures. Of course, I didn’t miss a single one of the three he gave at the university. At the last lecture I got a seat in the front row, and rather than listen (the truth is he repeated things he’d already said in the first and second lectures), I spent the time observing him in detail, his hands, for example, bony and energetic, his old man’s neck, like the neck of a turkey or a plucked rooster, his faintly Slavic cheekbones, his lifeless lips, lips that one could slash with a knife and from which one could be sure not a single drop of blood would fall, his gray temples like a stormy sea, and especially his eyes, deep eyes that at the slightest tilt of his head seemed at times like two endless tunnels, two abandoned tunnels on the verge of collapse.  “Of course, once the lecture was over he was mobbed by local worthies and I wasn’t even able to shake his hand and tell him how much I admired him. Time went by. The writer died, and, as one might expect, I continued to read and reread him. The day came when I decided to give up literature. I gave it up. This was in no way traumatic but rather liberating. Between you and me, I’ll confess that it was like losing my virginity. What a relief to give up literature, to give up writing and simply read!"

I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%. When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer! Gomenasai, my name is Ken-Sama. Anyway, wish me luck in Japan!"

jerktalkdiamond,33zzis,ned_vanderton,3,Mon Apr 27 20:36:10 2015 UTC,Korosu and Oppai. Those are the only words that matter.
jerktalkdiamond,33zzis,NKLhaxor,2,Mon Apr 27 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"Watashi = I or me. The 'wa' is a particle which is similar to the word 'is' or 'am'. Watashiwa is more like saying, ""I am"" or ""I is"".  Boku = The same as watashi, only masculine. Watashi is unisex, but only a guy would use boku really. ""You"" would be 'kimi' but it is really informal and should only be used with a really close friend, like a boyfriend/ girlfriend.   Shinen = I'm not really sure what this means, but the dictionary form of the verb for 'to die' is 'shinu'.  Hay (should be romanized as 'hai') = Affirmative. If someone uses something that sounds like 'hai' as a greeting, they are likely just using the English greeting, ""Hi"".  Hentai = Literally means 'strange' or 'weird'.   Senpai (NOT sempai) = Student who is older than you or of a higher rank. Sensei would be closer to master, but it literally means 'teacher'.  In addition to these things, half your words are spelled (romanized) wrong and if you tried to pronounce them like you have them spelled, you'd sound like an autismo. :^)  Source: わたしはにほんごをちょっとはなします。"
jerktalkdiamond,33zzis,Mega_Toast,2,Tue Apr 28 03:44:14 2015 UTC,"rused :^)  also  >'wa' is a particle which is similar to the word 'is' or 'am'. Watashiwa is more like saying, ""I am"" or ""I is"".  this is wrong as shit m8  tho your post might be pasta too. idk."
jerktalkdiamond,33zzis,Mega_Toast,2,Tue Apr 28 03:47:42 2015 UTC,lek xD
jerktalkdiamond,33zzis,Mega_Toast,2,Tue Apr 28 03:54:39 2015 UTC,"It's not wrong. It's a topic marker. You would use 'wa' in a sentence like;   わたしはにほんごをはなします。   I speak Japanese.   わたしはげんきです。   I am feeling good. (I am fine)  Therefore, without a topic behind it, the phrase 'watashiwa' can simple be translated as 'I am'.  Of course, that is not to say that it always is similar to 'I am'.   ナイントファイヴォさんはばかです。   Literally translates to 'Ninetofivehero is stupid."" but in the right context, such as if I were saying it directly to you, it could be translated as 'You are stupid."""
jerktalkdiamond,33zzis,Mega_Toast,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:00:23 2015 UTC,"> It's not wrong [that it translates to ""to be""]  >It's a topic marker  Pick one.  A topic marker is a topic marker, it marks the topic. It doesn't translate to ""to be"". ""To be"" in your second and third sentences is です.  I don't understand how you can think both ""wa is a particle which is similar to the word is or am"" and ""it's a topic marker"" at the same time. They're very different things.  The only way I could see anyone coming to that conclusion is if they saw something like ""gohan-wa atsui"", having it translated ""The food is hot"" and assuming it was done word-for-word, when in reality it's just a zero copula and the topic marker is, y'know, marking the topic."

jerktalkdiamond,33mwiu,memedad-transcriber,6,Thu Apr 23 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"Dude you need to quit fucking snap chatting mckenna. Stop. She doesn't respond with anything meaningful for a reason and she's not interested in you. Who am I? The man whom she is in love with. She already told me not to worry, she's not interested in you. Sorry I bothered you kid. I've dated her since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my woman or being inappropriate I don't care if you snap her occasionally. Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me. We are in love and we're making love tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with my woman you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best she's ever had, only man she's ever loved and the only man who could truly satisfy her physically. You will never have her. And she loves me. I don't have any problems with you if you are over my woman and realize you will never be with or touch her again. I apologize for coming off as a dick, just me and kenna are really deep in love and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man she used to date before me is snap chatting her.... We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask friend. If you try to talk to her any way but as a brother, or you try to see her at all, if she tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict brother like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem. I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the woman who I love and whom is in love with me. That entire summer she was with me. She left kyle for me. She's been with me ever since, she even loved me and made love to me before she EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please her. She didn't have strong feelings for you at all. And she immediately ended shit with you for me once she knew I loved her too. So get any ideas of the past out of your head. None of this truth should bug you if you're over her but I'm just making sure. I hate when my baby's friends have ill intentions and she thinks they are just friends and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all. If I can trust you to not stress me and my baby or fuck with our love tell me. I will leave you alone and apologize. But if you aren't over her and you're tryna ""get some"" or you're tryna get back in her life, it's NOT HAPPENING. She said you were nothing to her, and the sex was bad anyway haha. You're small and weak and she said it all felt wrong after being with me. She's been with me ever since. We're in love. And tomorrow me and her will be together in my room making love alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a man or tell me our love doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple. So??? What is it? You are after my woman then huh?! Tell me the fucking truth man. Don't you dare be disrespectful and gross enough to bring it up, but if if you ask her about anything she shared with me about your weak ass, she may be nice and lie to you, or she may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm her soullmate and her boyfriend of the past two years almost. And she tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my kenna. I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make moves with my woman. And i respect you as a guy in the service. I'm sure you're an ok dude. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my kenna but a brother like friend. I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it. Find a nice classy woman where you are stationed, marry her.... But back off of mine. You will never even compare to me in her eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and kenna's love. It's our lives man. It's really not cool.... Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in the service. Sorry to bring your day down with my crazy bullshit but. Me and kenna are head over heels.... I can't help but be crazy about her. I love her with all of my heart and I will protect her from her untrustworthy fake friends. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your head so I'm questioning a lot right now. Just know I'm never gonna hurt her, I'm always going to have her back, I'd give my life for her without hesitation, and I will protect her from anything, everything, and anyone. She is the love of my life. I fully intend to marry and give kenna my children. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is. I just moved back and me and her miss eachother so badly and we are FINALLY go to see eachother tomorrow and make love for the first time since halloween.... I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good dude. Just protective of the woman who holds my heart. And who's heart I hold and must protect. I hope you can understand. She promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that she's not interested:""/ I wish I knew before I embarrassingly went off on you. I'm so sorry man. I'm sorry. Please don't mention this to my baby:/ I'm really embarrassed and while she will understand, I just feel like an ass for attacking you when you have nothing with my kenna and no intention to. Good bye brother. I hope you find your one true love someday. It'll make you crazy, trust me, but you'll find her one day. I found mine when I was really young. And it's my kenna :)"

Those are memes that arent going to like being put in a cell with other mainstream memes like ""Bad luck Brian"" or ""Racist bear"".  I wonder how Putin even found out about them.

jerktalkdiamond,326yr7,PBMadCat,6,Sat Apr 11 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"I always do this: I approach a girl in a bus and put a ruler into her hand - Hold it - I say. That's when she opens her mouth widely and examines me with a look as if she was wondering whether I want to eat her father. And than I, leaning against the window, I tell her - I'm Andrzej. - What the fuck? - she asks. Grip the ruler tightly and measure 22 centimetres - with a nonchalant smile under my nose I look away from her frightened face in search of the pines blinking outside the window and the fields of wheat, shining like gold. I frown my brows for 7 seconds, to look like a dangerous and sexy American actor. Then I look deep, deep into her eyes. Now, she understands it all. With a touch of excitement and a hint of lust she asks - Is that how long your penis is? And just then I answer - no, baby - I take a step towards the door - That's how long my foot is. Then I leave, as I have approached her 34 and a half second before the bus stop, as always. I descend slowly down the stairs, without looking back. I put my hands inside the pockets of my expensive, gay coat and walk away, whistling. I know it, she runs to the window, just to look at me the one last time. The mysterious profile of the disappearing traveller makes her body spasm with lust. Homo viator, she thinks. She doesn't know that I drop my gay coat behind the corner, the pockets which are filled to the brim with rulers. After arriving home she masturbates with one of them, the only thing she has to remind herself of me. One day she shines ultraviolet light upon it , discovering a number, written in ancient latin, of course. She deciphers it and calls, and that's the number to my pedophile friend. They arrange a meeting and the girl gets raped. My pedophile friend brings her antlers, which I hang in the special spot of my basement. Then I take out another ruler from the container and leave the room. It's time to start the hunt. I fuck a dog while it shits. Yes, this is me. The Rulerman, one of the surviving crewmen of the Greek tanker Lotus."
jerktalkdiamond,325lmd,dustinyo_,7,Fri Apr 10 19:44:53 2015 UTC,"I came out to my family that I'm into anal vore. First of all let it be known that I created a new account just to open this thread. I'm pretty well known around here and some of you may recognize who I am from the way I write, and that's fine. But I don't want any possible embarrassment this thread may cause me to carry on to my true identity on here, or affect the way others see me.  So basically, what happened is I decided to tell my family and close friends that I'm into Anal Vore by having a ""coming-out"" party. I don't think it went very well and that's why I'm here.  Let me elaborate.  I'm a male in my early 20's. If you were to ask me who I am, the 1st thing I would instantly say is ""I am an anal vore fanatic"". It's who I am. It's my identity. Anal vore is my life, and it felt important enough for me to tell my friends and family. I decided the best way to tell them would be to have an anal vore ""coming-out party"", though I didn't tell them that the party was going to be about anal vore ahead of time. I'm not stupid. I knew they would look it up in Google and see a bunch of stupid things and criticisms by trolls about it, so I decided that to make the best impression of anal vore I would have to present it to them myself.  I ordered pizzas and planned a lot of fun activities we could do that would explain to my friends and family what anal vore is.  It started when they came in through the door. I gave everyone a sealed envelope and told them not to open it until I said so. When everyone had arrived (grandparents, aunts and uncles, my parents, 3 of my cousins, and a couple non-family friends), I announced what the purpose of the part was and had them open the envelopes. I had commissioned a popular artist that I really like to draw sketches of each of my family members/friends anal voring me, and I printed these pictures out and put them in the envelope (he agreed to do the sketches for $5/each BTW so it wasn't too expensive for me). Everyone kinda laughed and a couple of them were confused when I explained (my grandpa got kind of mad at me though). I basically explained to them that I'm into anal vore and what it is. I don't think they took it very well though because they joked a lot about it (they kept asking if I was serious or if I was joking). A couple people (my parents and grandparents mostly) seemed upset though, unfortunately.  The next part of the party was I hooked up my laptop to my TV with an HDMI cable and I started showing them my favorite anal vore pictures on Ekas portal and other pictures that I had saved on my computer. This is where the party kind of took a turn for the worse. One of my uncles got really mad and started calling me names (I don't want to repeat them here) but my aunt defended me. We argued for a bit and most of my family left at that point...I kept showing them the anal vore pictures I liked on Ekas portal but they started leaving and only my cousins and close friends chose to remain and look at the pictures with me. What did I do wrong? Is this basically something that only younger people enjoy? Because I'm pretty sure my grandparents hated anal vore (I still love them though even if we can't see eye to eye on this subject that's extremely important to me).  Anyways the next part of the party that I had planned for so long and was expecting to be a bit hit was a kind of interactive anal-vore reading game. I had printed out one of my favorite anal vore stories from Eka's and I wanted to pass around the story and we would all read a part aloud, but that didn't really go as planned. One of my cousins said they thought it was ""creepy""...? I tried to convince her that it'd be cool but no one wanted to do it. I had to read the story myself but when they started talking to each other about things NOT related to anal vore I kind of gave up  :(   The party kind of fizzled out. We just watched TV for a bit, I kept talking about anal vore a bit (but not as much as I wanted) and after the party was over everyone (the people who were left at the end, anyway) finally left.  Did I do anything wrong? Should I try to do the party again, because I think they may have interpreted my interest wrong? It's really important for me and I want them to know, but how can I communicate my love of anal vore to my family members who are specifically picky about such issues  >.> , such as my uncle who was intollerant of me? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

jerktalkdiamond,325lmd,gargamak,5,Fri Apr 10 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"So just a little disclaimer.. this might seem a bit gross to you, I mean, I feel gross about myself just writing this out.  I went to my straight friends house yesterday. His parents were at work and he had been home for a few hours alone. We went into his bedroom, and he went back downstairs to let the dog out into the garden or something.  I noticed at his desk that there was a crumpled tissue in the bin and my first reaction was to inspect it. It was exactly what I thought it was... a tissue filled with my friends cum, and it was still warm. Now, my friend is quite the good looking fellow, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a crush on him. Holding his cum in my hands made me incredibly horny.. just thinking that a few minutes ago he was cumming into this tissue made me so horny that without much thought I licked it and tried to get as much of it as I could into my mouth.  I have no idea what I was thinking. I'd never tried cum, so perhaps it was the thought of tasting it, or perhaps I was just overwhelmed with my feelings towards my friend. Regardless, I feel weird about it and feel slightly gross. I didn't regret it at the time, I mean.. I kinda liked it, but now I just feel weird about it."
