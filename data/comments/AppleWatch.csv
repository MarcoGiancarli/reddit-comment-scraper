AppleWatch,3e3mxa,the_Ex_Lurker,3,Tue Jul 21 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. So far, it isn't a toggle. And I don't believe it's a glitch because there's now orange in the stopwatch, timer, alarm, calendar, and sunrise complications.  I should point out, however, that these complications are still single-color in the Modular watch face."
AppleWatch,3e3mxa,TBoneTheOriginal,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:18:12 2015 UTC,I've only seen it colorized on Utility face. It isn't only the activity complication. The rest of the icons on Utility face are colorized too.

AppleWatch,3e3mxa,nostrademons,3,Tue Jul 21 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"Considering it just came out, it is hard to say right now. I would just wait unless you have development you are planning to do with it, or you are installing it on a watch that you do not depend on for daily use."

AppleWatch,3e3mxa,az116,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"Extremely buggy. The first hour after install it didn't work beyond a single wrist raise, then the screen wouldn't respond at all and it required force reboot. It eventually started working beyond that, but it doesn't seem to be much better than the last beta. A few fixes, but still not great.   Added a jaggy fade-in on wrist raise, which is maybe the worst part. Sometimes it gets stuck halfway through the fade and the screen stays partially lit."

I shower with mine after my workout sessions. I used to take it off and remove my strap to clean them with dish soap but I found just keeping the watch on in the shower is much faster and easier.
AppleWatch,3e39i2,taniabrunette,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:20 2015 UTC,How is your apple watch sustaining since you shower with it?. I am afraid of doing so. Since i think it would be damage even tho is water resistant
AppleWatch,3e39i2,rangosh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:04 2015 UTC,I've been wearing it in the shower for a month and there's no damage whatsoever. I too was afraid to leave it on in the shower but then read that Tim Cook showers with his so I figured it was safe. I was reassured even more last week when someone put theirs to the test in the ocean and it was proven that the watch can be submerged under one meter of water.

AppleWatch,3e27bg,FearAndSickness,9,Tue Jul 21 11:39:50 2015 UTC,"There is no ""target audience"", the beauty about the iPad (and every single other Apple product) is that the user makes it his or her own out of the box.   That is what most people/critics do not understand about the Apple Watch (or Apple's way of thinking in general). People are always looking at their products as if it were meant to solve a specific problem, or to have a one-hit feature use. The most important role for the Watch is what the user defines it as. Some people find the notifications to be the most important role. Others prefer its tight integration with health/fitness. Others like it for it's timekeeping/complications. Hell, users might want it just because of the way it looks. Overall, the whole point of the technology is to enrich/enhance a user's life in their own personal way. To some, it may do just that. If not, then they have the freedom not to use it at all, which is totally fine. But just because the Watch doesn't fit into one's daily life, does not mean that it will not be helpful to another's."

AppleWatch,3e2mnn,collenbyer,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:37 2015 UTC,"Not an Apple Watch owner - but almost was. Spent an age trying to decided if I should splash out on one, but couldn't justify the price vs features - so opted for the other extreme, cheap. So I got a Misfit Flash. Similar design values as the Apple Watch, but minimalist. The app is great and it's done a lot for me.   I'll be upgrading to a watch when there are a few more features and it's a bit of a smoother experience. But in terms of tracking activity the Misfit is great."
AppleWatch,3e2mnn,alexandjef,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:06 2015 UTC,"My primary reason for getting one was for activity tracking, and it's worked out very well. The heart rate monitor seems accurate, as does step count.   The integration with iOS is what puts it over the top for me. I had an MS band before, and aside from it being uncomfortable as hell, the limited notifications and interactions with my phone sort of annoyed me. The apple watch gives me everything the band did (well, except sleep tracking I guess) and does so much more."
AppleWatch,3e2mnn,maulla,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:30 2015 UTC,"I've got an Apple Watch, but never owned a fitness band. I'm in the gym 5 days/week, all lifting.I do love the heart rate monitor, but having the ability to see other data such as flights climbed, steps taken, walking and running distance, etc. on the Health app of my iPhone is just great.  The Apple Watch's ""Activity"" feature is overall very helpful not only for fitness but for overall health. It'll remind you to stand up hourly (if you haven't within that particular hour), and allow you not only to track calories/activity during your workouts, but to also track calories burned throughout the rest of your day. I could go on and on, but to me it seems like there are a lot of features for health/fitness on the Apple Watch that most fitness bands just can't replicate."
AppleWatch,3e2mnn,tutah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:40 2015 UTC,"You have some good points. Decisions, decisions..."
AppleWatch,3e2mnn,maeganw12,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:04 2015 UTC,"I use my watch for activity tracking. I never had a dedicated fitness tracker though. I try to fill my activity circle everyday.   It's fairly simple to use for cardio. I always use the dedicated workout app along with Nike+ Running. I only use the Nike app cause I want to see how many total miles I've used on my shoes and keep a record of the routes I've run. The heart rate, according to other people and the treadmill when I run inside, is very accurate. If I'm running with my phone, which I always do, then my distance is usually pretty matched. I think the most it's ever been off is by .01 miles. I've only had issues with my distance when I've been running/walking out of the country and my phone is on the public beta of iOS9, so I don't blame the watch completely. The estimated calorie count is also something that I really like.   I've also done lifting with it and that's hit and miss. I'm not usually doing that for calorie burn, so I just start an ""other"" workout in the app and let the time run while I'm lifting. The purpose for doing this is so that I can fill more of the exercise circle and get the few calories burned added for the day.  I also like being able to control my music from my wrist while I'm working out. I don't have to fiddle with my phone at all. If I do get an important call that I can't miss, usually my mom, it won't interrupt my workout. I can just pause my workout on my wrist and answer the call on my watch, which then goes through the headphone I'm wearing. I don't have to take the phone off my arm to answer, which is wonderful."
AppleWatch,3e2mnn,maeganw12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"thanks for your response. i really just think that being an iphone owner that there isn't much of any other option for a smartwatch. not only that, it practically doubles the features of another fitness band that i would probably spend approximately 200 dollars on. it's a tough decision."
AppleWatch,3e2mnn,1st_thing_on_my_mind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"If you want a smartwatch that doubles as a fitness tracker, then no there isn't. I have a Pebble Steel and a Pebble Time (I backed the kick started before I wanted and got an Apple Watch), and I enjoy being able to interact with my notifications. That's what I wanted out of my Pebbles but couldn't get.  I would say get it! I have the SS and love it. I almost got the SGS but after going to a try on appointment switched to the SS. I realized that having a harder screen was nice cause my Pebble had some scratches on them, and I didn't want that to happen as easily."
AppleWatch,3e2mnn,sidious911,2,Tue Jul 21 20:08:31 2015 UTC,"I work out with my watch every day. Swim twice a week, box 3 times a week, do home dumbbells 3 times a week and lift at the gym twice a week. No issues with its usage. I also did a HRM comparison both for boxing and swimming and it was spot on with my Polar chest strap and watch.   I used one of the original fitbits for a while and then switched to the BT HRM with my phone before getting the apple watch. So far this is the most convenient without losing the level of accuracy I was used to. Plus having the daily goals helps me to get up since I work at a desk job."
AppleWatch,3e2mnn,kungfujohnny,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:59 2015 UTC,"I picked up the watch because it covered many use cases for me, Classy looking accessory, Fitness tracker, Golf GPS watch, plus general connection to the phone to help filter out notifications and spend less time with my head in a phone when I don't really need to.  The fitness stuff is great, it has motivated me to be a lot more active because I feel compelled to fill the 3 rings every day. Before I was going to the gym 2 maybe 3 times a week, but other days could be very inactive, now I find myself at the gym more, and off days are getting more activity doing a hike or run to get some activity in.  The stand info is really beneficial as someone who works at a desk all day. All the activity info can be synced into apps like MyFitnessPal so all my activity is automatically factored in. Some say the accuracy of the watch isn't quite on point as some other fitness trackers, but for me, I'm not worried about every single calorie, or if my distance wasn't down to the meter.  The watch is quite durable, and I do not worry too much about it, I'm obviously still a little cautious when doing things that I don't just rub it against a wall or smash it on something, but no where near worried. AppleCare+ will also help you keep peace of mind! Water with the watch is no worry either.  As for size, the slight difference in price shouldn't be your determining factor, you should buy the watch that fits you properly and looks right. Some people are in the middle where a 38 or 42 will look ok, others a 42 looks massive on them, or a 38 looks way too small. The 42 also has a slightly better battery simply because of the larger casing.  Apple does has a 14 day return policy (at least here in North America). I originally picked up mine with the notion that I may return it, but I quickly fell in love with it! Checkout your local return policy, and try it out, if you are not enjoying it, return it before your two weeks is up. Schedule an appointment if you have a local Apple Store, go try some on, see what fits.  Feel free to ask if you have any more questions :)"
AppleWatch,3e2mnn,kungfujohnny,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:16 2015 UTC,I was recently trying to make the same decision. I decided that although it's not the best fitness tracker it fit several other needs I had. I'm so glad I purchased it!

Make sure you get apple care on it though, it's well made but I haven't worn a watch for a while and expect I'll probably ding it or drop it at some point."
AppleWatch,3e2mnn,bristolengineer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:06 2015 UTC,I replaced my Garmin GPS watch and chest strap with the Apple Watch.  I do weights twice a week and cardio twice a week (one elliptical and one 2 hr outdoor bike ride).  I've tested the AW against the heart rate and calorie burn as measured on the Garmin and they were very close..within about 50 calories over the 2 hr outdoor ride.  Close enough that I now leave the Garmin at home.

This way I can still check the time with a flick of the wrist, and the dim red text will be barely visible (I also try to hide it just in case) and will also be able to see a little red dot in case I did in fact miss something.  Not an ""easy"" setup, but truthfully takes about twenty seconds so I'm not too upset about it."
AppleWatch,3e360u,marinojesse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:02 2015 UTC,You could also have this watch face already added and ready to go.  That would save a bit of time.
AppleWatch,3e360u,nicholas818,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"Oh I do, I keep it saved for those reasons exactly. It honestly takes no time at all and it's a good measure for me because it's hard for me to forget if I did a multistep process, but I frequently forget if I've turned my phone off before movies because it's so quick to do.  And no I'm not calling multistep processes a feature, but a benefit for my brain haha"
AppleWatch,3e360u,marinojesse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:25 2015 UTC,Man...that is quite the process for just a movie. What a pain in the ass.  That and who really needs to check the time in a movie? I just put the screen brightness to low and put it in silent mode. I'm not waving my arms around during movies so I very rarely turns on.
AppleWatch,3e360u,KittenSwagger,2,Tue Jul 21 19:37:53 2015 UTC,"Man...that is quite the process for just a movie. What a pain in the ass.   As /u/nicholas818 said, one could have the watch face set up already as a custom face and then it's just a couple taps."
AppleWatch,3e360u,waterskier2007,2,Tue Jul 21 19:50:17 2015 UTC,"I noticed this same issue when I first went to a movie with my watch, trying to eat popcorn without pissing everyone off. Figures that was the first day I had my Apple Watch so I hadn't had much time to play with it yet.  So far movies are the only time I've wanted this ability accessible. I just go into Settings > General > Activate On Wrist Raise, and set Wrist Raise to 'Off'.  This will stop the watch from lighting up when you are moving your arm around. Also mute the watch from your settings glance so any notifications don't make any noise. You can also just turn on Do Not Disturb to stop haptic feedback as well. With this setup you can still tap the screen with your finger to turn it on if you want to see the Time or what a haptic feedback tap was for."

AppleWatch,3dzicy,avisiongrotesque,4,Mon Jul 20 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"That was quite beautiful and I feel similarly. But have you noticed how differently people react to you looking at your watch than at your iPhone? I think we have all grown so accustomed to everyone looking down at their phones that we generally keep talking when they do. It's almost not rude anymore. But when I look at my watch, it's as if I have said to someone's face, I don't have time for you."
AppleWatch,3dzicy,Krypto_74,2,Tue Jul 21 06:27:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely! That was one of the first points of feedback I received from colleagues. This may sound silly, but if I touch my watch with my other hand, people tend to remember that I have a smartwatch on and that I'm not being rude."

One thing to keep in mind is that those machines typically include resting calories in their total burn, where the workouts/activity app will separate that and show total burn at the end of the workout. you will still have a somewhat sizable difference between the two numbers, but I think that most people chalk it up to the machines not being accurate."
AppleWatch,3e2x6m,maulla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:02 2015 UTC,the machine estimates have been known to be dramatically innacurate unless you use a chest strap. I would go with apple watch over a machines estimate.

AppleWatch,3e2s45,Firewall84,4,Tue Jul 21 14:51:45 2015 UTC,"Why would you want these things out of curiosity?  I love that my watch doesn't go off when I'm already going to see my phone go off while I'm using it. This is something that currently bugs me with my iPhone/iPad/Mac, everything likes to go off.  Also, why would you want your watch to light up for a notification if you are not looking at the watch, who is the watch lighting up for?  I'm not sure of the OS2 features, but just curious as to why someone would want this, these two things I personally think Apple did really well with the watch"
AppleWatch,3e2s45,sidious911,2,Tue Jul 21 14:56:35 2015 UTC,"For the always vibrating, just because my phone is on doesn't mean I'm looking at it or interacting with it (or want to). For example I might be using the phone for navigation, watching a video, or on a phone call. Or it could be the delay between setting the phone on my desk before the screen times out.  For the other issue, I'm frequently where I can see my watch face easily but the screen isn't on. For example, right now I'm typing and my watch just tapped me. To see the notification I have to stop typing and flick my wrist because the screen is off. This is even more annoying in that having the watch also disables the iPhone screen from lighting up on notifications. So even though my iPhone is on my desk where I can see the screen it also won't tell me anything about the notification unless I stop what I'm doing. To me that's a step backwards in convenience which isn't really the reason I bought a smart watch."
AppleWatch,3e2s45,s0init,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:14 2015 UTC,My watch still gives notifications when I'm on my phone. I have to put it into airplane mode.

AppleWatch,3e2s45,redisant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:55 2015 UTC,"My watch does notifications if I'm actively talking on the phone too.

As far as things not launching, is your phone using ios9 public beta? At least for me, performance with the watch and data has changed a bit.

The second version of the Watch software is good for display and for controlling. It is already with developers, and it is expected to be ready for users in September.  Google Maps with the limited control would be disappointing.  Google Weather and Google News are exactly right for mostly-display applications, and they run great on Watch."

Like you said they include ear buds and ear hooks of a bunch of different sizes. It may take a while to find the perfect combination but eventually after playing around with them for a little they always stay secure in my ears, even when running.  As for the wire I had the same problem, until I used the little clip they included. You can use it to attach the wire to the back of your shirt so it doesn't bounce around at all, which makes them even more stable in your ears.  I've had them for months now and I love them, except I had one annoying issue. The left earbud stopped working out of the blue from what I am assuming to be sweat from running. It's the only thing I could think of. Fortunately I bought them from Amazon and I was able to ship them back for a full refund, and eventually I repurchased them."

AppleWatch,3dyebx,nocto7,6,Mon Jul 20 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"I walked in there yesterday. I asked how much stock they had in store. I was amazed to find they had every model with every size with every band except for the edition.   I then asked, what are the chances that I could pay to upgrade my watch if my current watch is out of the 14 day return policy but in perfect condition. The employee said that they are eager to do so especially if it is an upgrade (he even made it sound like you could switch out a model of an equivalent model). The only requirement is that I had to have the full packaging, charger, etc or I would have to pay $70 extra or so for the exchange. You also must have the email receipt from your first watch.  I handed him my old watch after reseting, he pulled out an apple watch with milanese loop. He entered the transaction as a return of the old watch and purchasing the new one. I paid the difference and was out the door. So easy."

I was planning on purchasing the ML band and asked how it would look on my AWS. The specialist made a face that said, ""ehhh"" but actually said ""it's decent, some people like it."" And then smiled. I then asked if she could show me on my AWS - afterwards I asked if they had any in stock and if it would be possible to pay for an upgrade. She spoke to the manager and I'm happy to say I'm now on my sofa at home with my new SS with ML. She did explain that it wasn't normal, but as usual, they went above and beyond normal customer service.  edit: I also want to say that i was already planning to purchase the ML band this weekend; however, due to an ongoing illness I wasn't able to go (I have good days and bad). Tonight, I would have purchased the band regardless, so I don't want to come across as someone that was trying to waste the friendly specialist's time.

I suspect that Apple, at least for the next few years, will stay with the  same thickness and increase battery size and life in the AW. That would be my preference.

AppleWatch,3dyme1,williagh,2,Tue Jul 21 12:08:52 2015 UTC,I feel the same way... the 6+ is so slippery with its rounded sides that I ended up getting an Apple case for it so its already thicker than normal and the size w/ case is perfect... if that was extra battery the 6+ would last ages on a single charge and we wouldn't have that annoying camera hump.

However, if you're doing a major activity like long distance hiking, it can drain in less than a day.  This probably effects very few people, but I run into it from time to time.

AppleWatch,3dyme1,mredofcourse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:17 2015 UTC,Loinger battery life would allow for sleep tracking though. If you could get 3-4 days from it then you could wear it 3-5 nights a week to bed.
AppleWatch,3dyme1,ryanmercer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:31:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I wouldn't want longer battery life, but it's one of the lowest priorities, just above ""being thinner"".  As far as sleep tracking, I'm really not interested in it unless I can do it consistently.  I'd hate to track for 3 days and then on the 4 day wake up and not have enough battery life and it takes twice as long to recharge for example.  Further complicating matters is that it really currently isn't that great of a sleep monitor.  Nobody really makes what could be done today, but hopefully someone will soon.  What could be done is a sleep monitor that measures O2, pulse, peripheral perfusion, noise, body temp and movement while wearing both writing it to HealthKit and providing alerts when O2 goes to low.  Something like this could be fairly inexpensive (about $100) and be a dedicated sleep tracker.  There are many fitness trackers that advertise sleep tracking, but all some of them do is measure movement while a few add in maybe pulse and maybe noise.  Likewise there are O2 sensors, but they either don't do sleep tracking, or they are really expensive and don't offload interactivity or results via BlueTooth.  Currently I measure my sleep with a cheap WiThings Fitness Band and compare it to the results from my SleepNumber mattress.  But honestly, if you aren't measuring any of the other things, it's probably more accurate to do it manually - meaning look at what time it is when you go to bed, what time it is when you wake up and then manually enter how much of the time into the Health app (minus any disruptions)."
AppleWatch,3dyme1,mredofcourse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"Further complicating matters is that it really currently isn't that great of a sleep monitor   Because the battery life isn't there to make it practical, which is why we need more battery not a thinner watch."
AppleWatch,3dyme1,ryanmercer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:37 2015 UTC,"Read the rest of what I wrote.  Even with a hypothetical infinite battery life, the Apple Watch would suck as a sleep monitor.  It lacks the other sensors.  If it had the other sensors and the same battery life, I'd be fine with it as a sleep tracker.  I'd just charge it when I ate breakfast and took a shower."

AppleWatch,3dyme1,williagh,2,Tue Jul 21 00:53:13 2015 UTC,"I've also worn watches for years and don't think the Apple Watch is particularly big at all.

AppleWatch,3dyme1,abdowatch,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:28 2015 UTC,I think it could do with being just a tad thinner.
AppleWatch,3dyme1,ShezaEU,2,Mon Jul 20 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"As an average-sized woman with 145mm wrists, I don't hate the thickness of the Apple Watch, but thinner would be better for me. I've come to accept the ""huge"" 38mm screen and no longer wish it smaller. But thinner, yes. If you look at women's watches, even the currently trendy huge face ones (even bigger than AW) are thin."

AppleWatch,3e12t0,WinterCharm,4,Tue Jul 21 03:31:39 2015 UTC,"I think it looks good... more like a watch and less like a gadget... Ive seen a few people with smaller wrists get the 42mm and it ends up looking like a gadget strapped to their wrist. Though at your wrist size you might be able to pull it off, I would just goto the Apple Store if you're close and try one on."
AppleWatch,3e12t0,weezerrock007,3,Tue Jul 21 13:15:56 2015 UTC,"There is another subreddit posting on here about a similar situation and they referenced a watch designer. Something about putting a credit card lengthwise on your wrist. If its slightly credit card width is slightly smaller, about the same or slightly bigger you could wear either size. If the credit card is bigger than the wrist, then you would wear the 38mm. If your wrist is bigger, then wear the 42mm"
AppleWatch,3e12t0,Tech_fan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:52:50 2015 UTC,"For me, the credit card was the same size as my wrist, so I guess either one works...   Im just so torn and wonder if anyone thinks my watch looks too small, and if I I should upgrade."
AppleWatch,3e12t0,Daavid1,5,Tue Jul 21 04:03:56 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think it looks great, and this picture even made me pretty relieved. I''ve ordered the exact same size and band but the Sport, and got the same wrist size (Same as a credit card). I personly want the watch band to go around my wrist, not just around 2/4 of it if you know what I mean.  I think it looks great :)"
AppleWatch,3e12t0,Tech_fan,2,Tue Jul 21 07:44:53 2015 UTC,"For me, the credit card was about the same size and I wear the 42mm. I thought the 38mm looked too small. Statistically speaking, Apple sells close to 70 some odd percent of the 42mm and the remainder goes to the 38mm. Also, bigger watches are the in style thing. Also, people say that the battery life is better on the 42mm because its bigger.   So, IMO I say go with the 42mm."

AppleWatch,3e12t0,ShezaEU,2,Tue Jul 21 08:28:00 2015 UTC,I am in exactly the same position as you (albeit with a SGS). Our wrists look quite similar in size as well. I am going back to the Apple Store before the return window is up to try out the 42 after originally being persuaded by the Apple Store guy and some friends that the 38 is right for me. It's not that I don't like the look of the 38 on me (nor you - looks ok) it's just annoying that you can often only fit 2-3 words per line on the smaller screen.
AppleWatch,3e12t0,immortals,2,Tue Jul 21 07:41:21 2015 UTC,I would. The 42mm feels like just the right size for me.
AppleWatch,3e12t0,wheeze_the_juice,2,Tue Jul 21 03:36:24 2015 UTC,"doesn't matter. get what you want that fits your taste.   some people prefer smaller face watches. other prefer bigger ones. personally, i have small wrists, yet i went for the 42mm. i don't think it looks too big at all. i like it. thats all that matters to me.  and you should feel the same way. go try on a 42mm and do what you think looks/feels better. thats the whole point of a watch. it's personal/taste and fashion. it's beyond technology where 'specs' trump over anything else."
AppleWatch,3e12t0,ripple024,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"It does matter.  The 42mm has a superior battery and at the end of the day, it doesn't look that much bigger than the 38 (although you can feel the difference when you wear it)."
AppleWatch,3e12t0,burlow44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:51 2015 UTC,"I would keep that size. People with big watches do it for a fashion statement and for the most part looks ok, but definitely noticeable and obvious what they are doing."

But I also think the larger one wouldn't look bad either.  If you plan on tricking your watch out with a lot of straps and like the fashion aspect of it, I would stay with the smaller size so the straps you invest in are actually visible to you. Personally, I think the 38 looks good on you."
AppleWatch,3e12t0,pointblank87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:29 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look ""bad"" but I would go 42mm if the extra cash isn't gunna hurt your wallet."

The down side: Sweat.  Sweat has made my leather loop band smell bad and I really wish I could find a way to clean it safely.  I assume there's an oil I could use or something but I fear damaging the band.  No visual issue at all but I don't wear it regularly for exercise so I don't know if time would affect it.    I admit I've avoided the band since noticing the scent from it. Not sure the best resolution.  TLDR: While comfortable and not a problem during exercise, it may start to smell due to sweat."

If I go down one more notch then the watch can literally slide up, down, and around my wrist. I guess some of us have sensitive skins. I wish there was a way the heart rate sensor could have been made to not concave out so it would be a bit more comfortable to wear and wouldn't leave a mark on me but the mark goes away in around a half an hour max for me so it's NBD"

Does anyone in the Reddit community happen to have any helpful tips on how to solve this issue?  Could this be a hardware failure or defective unit that I would need to get replaced?
AppleWatch,3dzuoe,1st_thing_on_my_mind,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"its a common thread around here. The exercise ring is based upon movement. Speed is usually above 10mph on a bike and faster than 18min/mile pace. Also, its not guaranteed that it will move if you using one of the exercise selections if you dont make those numbers. If you choose other for a workout it will log it and some people just use it that way.  For me as a big guy my ring doesnt move until I am working very hard. I end up using ""Other"" for boxing, high intensity superset weights and swimming so thats where it tends to fill up for me.  Just gotta get moving more."

AppleWatch,3dz1jk,SgtWaffleStomp,3,Mon Jul 20 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"I'm almost sure that this is the best way, but if anyone would like to correct me, feel free.  To keep all of your fitness and health data, you need to setup your new iPhone from a backup from the old iPhone, so make sure you've backed up your iPhone on either iTunes or iCloud. Before you back it up however, go to Watch.app>My Watch>Apple Watch>Unpair Apple Watch. This should save the settings, layout, and all the acquired health data from your watch, and will include that in the next backup. Once you backup, and texture from the new one, you should be good to then pair the watch with the new phone.  Again, this is my a guess but I do know that ""Unpairing"" the Apple Watch vs. just resetting all content and settings actually keeps the content and settings."
AppleWatch,3dz1jk,marinojesse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:04 2015 UTC,The only thing to add to this is to make sure it's an encrypted backup since otherwise it won't backup your health data.

AppleWatch,3dv8hn,SammyG852,2,Sun Jul 19 21:23:11 2015 UTC,I'm looking for a good fitness tracker for my apple watch. What have you been using?
AppleWatch,3dv8hn,SammyG852,2,Mon Jul 20 02:06:37 2015 UTC,"MyFitnessPal, and the default apps so far.  I have fitlist for strength training, but it's only ok."
AppleWatch,3dv8hn,1st_thing_on_my_mind,2,Mon Jul 20 02:36:51 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll check out My Fitness Pal
AppleWatch,3dv8hn,maulla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:46:14 2015 UTC,This is my combo too. I like fit list but the watch app is inconsistent. It worked great the other night at the gym. No errors. Then last night I did Dumbbells at home and it crashed every time. But the phone app is good.
AppleWatch,3dv8hn,metalhaze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"Congrats man, but a 35lb change in a months time to go from slightly overweight to no longer overweight is a little scary to me. Your calorie burn is obviously very high, I just hope you aren't starving yourself."

This sounds horribly unhealthy and it's pretty much a waste of time. Do higher intensity work in shorter periods of time for best results. Length of time doesn't matter when it comes to losing weight. Intensity matters more. 30 minutes of intense cardio is all you really need in any given day to get healthy results. You can't keep this up for the rest of your life....You need to develop long term solutions. Not quick fixes.   I've lost 35lbs   In what timeframe? This could also be dangerous depending on how fast you lost this amount of weight.   1500-2500 calories a day   Total Calories or Active Calories? If these are your active calories then I hope you are eating enough food to replace the energy you are using. Also how much water are you drinking everyday?  I am glad you decided to take your health more seriously after running it into the ground but going from zero to 110% isn't the healthy way to do it.

Dropping weight is about calories in vs calories out.  Initially I didn't have the stamina to do more intense workouts.  I'm building my way there and burning the necessary calories over the longer term in the mean time.   In what timeframe? This could also be dangerous depending on how fast you lost this amount of weight.   Month and a half.

AppleWatch,3dybvd,andrewbasso,8,Mon Jul 20 15:10:07 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan personally. My advice is to study how Apple does a great job of making the transition seamless and try and mimmic that.
AppleWatch,3dybvd,abdowatch,3,Mon Jul 20 16:08:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. The watch to adapter and adapter to band relationship is very important. Especially in 3rd party bands. If that doesn't look nice then the material used and fit of the band almost become a far secondary.   Get the adapter right. The rest should be fluid. Simple.  Personally without knowing which band was which I chose the last in line for those reasons. It looked finished, and I got really excited because of course I'd pay $99 for that band! But alas..."

Controlling a music app on the watch is identical to controlling it from the ""Control Centre"" thing you usually swipe up to view on your iPhone.   You get play/pause/next/back and volume. It's responsive and quick, but not very in depth. No artwork. No browsing playlists.   Basically, if you can control your music app from that control centre thing, you can control it on the watch!  Here's hoping native apps on watch help solve this."

AppleWatch,3dw346,ShezaEU,3,Mon Jul 20 02:09:57 2015 UTC,"In addition you can get an app called 'Joy' for Spotify that lets you browse and play your playlists on the watch, and even ask for music using your voice. It's a bit hit and miss but it's cool when it does work. After you've told it to start playing a playlist or whatever, the rest is controllable by the slightly more convenient Music glance, as described by /u/retrodog."
AppleWatch,3dwdya,afrosheen,7,Mon Jul 20 02:18:14 2015 UTC,"Part of this just won't happen because it's comparing a specialty, dedicated device to a generalist device but as for the rest:  The live monitoring, graphing and or alarms of heart rates will have to come with watchOS 2 in September. The current API makes you wait until the data are in HealthKit before grabbing them and doesn't allow third party apps direct access to the watch hardware.

AppleWatch,3dwdya,brandonballinger,5,Mon Jul 20 23:58:29 2015 UTC,"This is really useful!  I'm working on an app (cardiogr.am) which graphs heart rate, and we'd like to get better at heart rate analytics. It sounds to me like the most useful things are:   Calibration at the beginning, to set goals that are matched to your level of fitness During a run or workout, show heart rate zones For weightlifting—just the graph or is there something more to it? Tracking resting heart rate over time, so that you can see changes.   Does that cover it?"
AppleWatch,3dwdya,Georgeasaurus,4,Mon Jul 20 03:36:03 2015 UTC,Just wanted to say thanks for your work man. I'm beta testing and loving it so far.

AppleWatch,3dwdya,1st_thing_on_my_mind,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yes!! That's 90% of it.    For weightlifting, the watch realizes, upon finishing the set that the heart rate is going down from its peak level and would then show a dotted line of where the heart rate should be on the graph to start the next set and when it reaches that level, it will notify the user to start the next set.  It wasn't crucial for me as I got into a rhythm, but it did definitely help at the beginning when I first started out.    But yeah, you've covered it.  The goals would be in three categories to be met by the end of the week, Monday through Sunday.  One would be burning the specific number of calories to your fitness level and whether you're trying to maximize or maintain your fitness level.  The second would be meeting the target duration in the cumulative duration of your exercise sessions for the week.  The third would be exercising in the specific heart zones for the length that the program has set.   And that would be the gamut."
AppleWatch,3dwdya,williagh,6,Mon Jul 20 23:56:35 2015 UTC,You are comparing a complete fitness watch with specific software to a smart watch that covers large amounts of information and only one aspect is fitness. I dont think they missed an opportunity at all.

AppleWatch,3dwd1o,ryanmercer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:34:38 2015 UTC,Havent noticed in two months. Maybe wearing it very tight might cause it to stretch.
AppleWatch,3dwd1o,williagh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:00:22 2015 UTC,"yes, just a little bit though. still fits well enough."
AppleWatch,3dwd1o,maulla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:07:25 2015 UTC,Yes. mine has definitely stretched out a bit. The other day I noticed I could just about rotate the watch all the way around my wrist.
AppleWatch,3dwd1o,jayplemons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:59 2015 UTC,I alternate between third and fourth depending on the time of day.

AppleWatch,3duoad,J0403,2,Sun Jul 19 17:27:39 2015 UTC,"I finish most days with 30-60% battery life, average around 35-40, that's with a bad signal at work all day, then consistent use after work.  I'm nervous about native apps on OS2 changing this, I don't mind charging every night."
AppleWatch,3duoad,Marino4K,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:36:49 2015 UTC,"Native apps will definitely change this, but as you see you have room to spare and will still only need to charge every night"

AppleWatch,3duoad,Deedubau,2,Sun Jul 19 17:38:16 2015 UTC,I regularly have 50-60% still by the end of the day. I will gladly give up some battery for better performance
AppleWatch,3duoad,burlow44,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:45:28 2015 UTC,I'd hope that it improves because running apps remotely over Bluetooth seems quite inefficient.

AppleWatch,3dva3a,naughty_ottsel,4,Sun Jul 19 20:32:02 2015 UTC,Did you leave your phone in the hotel room as well?  Would Apple Pay work without the phone?
AppleWatch,3dva3a,nicholas818,5,Sun Jul 19 21:46:08 2015 UTC,My phone was on me. But I believe it will work without the phone. The watch and the phone have different device numbers. (this has caused issues on Transport For London Contactless)  From what I understand of physical (I imagine to a certain extent in app as well but still requires an online connection) all that is transferred in the NFC connection is the Device number. All querying about what card should be charged etc is done via the seller. There is no need for an Internet connection at time of payment
AppleWatch,3dva3a,nicholas818,3,Sun Jul 19 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes sense.  Just a device number and some sort of offline generator for security codes, no need for an Internet connection."
AppleWatch,3dva3a,nicholas818,2,Sun Jul 19 21:56:31 2015 UTC,I think the security code may even come from the reader to create the transaction number. But I don't know. Think there was a white paper on this... Will have to find it :)
AppleWatch,3dva3a,Krazerxz,4,Sun Jul 19 21:59:36 2015 UTC,"the Secure Element provides your Device Account Number and a transaction-specific dynamic security code. This information is sent along with additional information needed to complete the transaction to the store’s point of sale terminal. Neither Apple nor your device sends your credit or debit card number. Before they approve the payment, your bank or payment network can verify your payment information by checking the dynamic security code to make sure it’s unique and that it’s tied to your device.

AppleWatch,3dva3a,Slobotic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:07:39 2015 UTC,Knew there must have been a white paper on it. Thanks :)
AppleWatch,3dva3a,kirklennon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:25:08 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this - and it can't require Internet.

AppleWatch,3dv80c,joebobber,4,Sun Jul 19 20:13:59 2015 UTC,What size is the watch and strap?  I thought SGS meant Space grey sport?
AppleWatch,3dv80c,walt_disnae,2,Sun Jul 19 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"You're right, I keep thinking the regular aluminum sport is grey.   It's a 44, the adapters I use look fine with a 22mm or 24mm strap. This strap is a 24."
AppleWatch,3dv80c,WubWubDropIt,2,Mon Jul 20 02:40:46 2015 UTC,That is an olive strap? It looks more silver.  Could you post some more pictures?  I was just about to pull the trigger on it tonight.
AppleWatch,3dv80c,gettingzen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:52:51 2015 UTC,"If it helps any, I posted a similar combination last week with photos:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/3d4q17/14_army_green_nylon_band_details_links_in_comments/  Not sure which strap the OP is using, but it does look more grey to me too.

AppleWatch,3dw2yz,fadetowhite,3,Mon Jul 20 00:39:37 2015 UTC,I wonder why Dark Sky isn't available in Canada. It gives Canadian weather.
AppleWatch,3dw2yz,williagh,2,Mon Jul 20 01:00:48 2015 UTC,"It gives the weather all over the world. The same company owns Forecast.io. The reason, I think, they only have Dark Sky for the U.S. is due to the weather predictions for exams, that it will rain in 5 minutes etc."
AppleWatch,3dw2yz,pacli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:21:46 2015 UTC,I used it in Ireland recently and I think it gave precise predictions. The same in Italy a few months ago. I think.
AppleWatch,3dw2yz,williagh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:17:06 2015 UTC,Weird. Just searched it on the App Store and it's not available.
AppleWatch,3dw2yz,SurrenderToReason,2,Mon Jul 20 02:40:10 2015 UTC,"Check for WeatherNerd, it uses Dark Sky's technology and has a better UI, IMO."
AppleWatch,3dw2yz,Berzerker7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:43:55 2015 UTC,"Just checked it out, I'll take Dark Sky's UI..."
AppleWatch,3dw2yz,RobSenner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:23:46 2015 UTC,I think it's because of the high cost of weather data in Canada.
AppleWatch,3dw2yz,williagh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:03:51 2015 UTC,"Really. That is interesting. But, Dark Sky does report the Canadian weather. I can look up any place."

AppleWatch,3dw2yz,Marino4K,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:24:44 2015 UTC,Hmm that's a big difference!   The apps I've tried are usually within 1 degree (Celsius) so it's not so bad.
AppleWatch,3dvii8,sharp44mag,3,Sun Jul 19 21:43:16 2015 UTC,"Nope. Outside of the return window, especially this far out, they cannot change it for another. Your best bet would be to sell it on your own and buy the new one after."
AppleWatch,3dvii8,xnickitynickx,-3,Sun Jul 19 21:54:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, for an upgrade they usually honor it if it is in good condition with receipt."

AppleWatch,3dvii8,Berzerker7,2,Sun Jul 19 23:27:36 2015 UTC,No they don't usually. Maybe if you were less than 30 days but this is way out so the odds are against it.  Then again if it's not scratched yet it never hurts to ask. A manager might take pity
AppleWatch,3dvii8,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:55:27 2015 UTC,guess I was right guys
AppleWatch,3dvii8,chiefarab,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:55 2015 UTC,"I'd try them. I'd say it's 50/50, given how they're treating watch customers so far.   However, you have a good chance of getting most of your money back if you sell it. I'd do it quickly though. Supply is getting better and better. Knock $40 off retail and I'd say you'll make a sale."

AppleWatch,3dvii8,Suicide_Run,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:03:36 2015 UTC,"I would call the local Apple store and ask to speak to the store manager. You might have a case considering they were not in stock in the Apple store for awhile and if you returned it back to Apple, you would have to ship the product back to them, then they would refund the money back to the credit card and then you could reorder and have it shipped to you. IMO that is a long time to wait for another watch."
AppleWatch,3dvii8,Tech_fan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:23:12 2015 UTC,"I just tried to do this last week after purchasing the sport in June. After 14 days they won't do anything, so I ended up purchasing the SS in store and selling my sport online."
AppleWatch,3dvii8,saintcourtney,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:58:38 2015 UTC,How much did you get for the sport? Did you eBay it?
AppleWatch,3dvii8,-AdamTheGreat-,2,Mon Jul 20 12:05:14 2015 UTC,"I'm using eBay but it hasn't sold yet. I had a listing before hand and the winning bid was $345 (that's including Apple Care, so about $55 off) but they were international and I wasn't planning on shipping international. Most are going for around that price range. I might try Craigslist."
AppleWatch,3dvii8,saintcourtney,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"You should see if there are any Facebook garage sale pages in your area. My wife is a member of one and it worked out better than Craigslist. It was a bit safer imo, especially if selling a high dollar item."

AppleWatch,3duqnn,drhouse11,3,Sun Jul 19 17:47:32 2015 UTC,I would say 38MM just because you will look fine with it and save a little bit of money that you can put towards a new band or accessories!
AppleWatch,3duqnn,jaconphil,3,Sun Jul 19 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"the only band I would want are the leather loops, and they don't even have a 38!"
AppleWatch,3duqnn,omgnotanotherone,5,Sun Jul 19 18:14:52 2015 UTC,then keep the 42; easy as that!
AppleWatch,3duqnn,geeeeh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:19:51 2015 UTC,I feel the pain...hoping (assuming) they'll come out with more band options over time.
AppleWatch,3duqnn,guildymaster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"Have you seen the reviews on this sub of the third-party 38mm leather loop bands? They look almost exactly like Apple's LL and are just as comfortable, according to what I've seen here."
AppleWatch,3duqnn,Deedubau,2,Sun Jul 19 19:51:44 2015 UTC,I have small wrists and went with 42mm because of the slightly better battery life (don't know how much better) and bigger screen.
AppleWatch,3duqnn,MrsWizardOfKoz,2,Sun Jul 19 18:07:36 2015 UTC,I switched from a pebble steel to the Apple watch sport. I originally intended to by the 38mm but after trying it on it was oddly uncomfortable in size compared to my pebble.  I've had the 42mm for a month now and I definitely think it was worth the extra $50.
AppleWatch,3duqnn,princerafael,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:45:40 2015 UTC,Do you happen to know your wrist siZe?
AppleWatch,3duqnn,MrsWizardOfKoz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:52:20 2015 UTC,Mine is 155m and I'm happy with my 42mm choice. Believe me it's gonna pay off over time
AppleWatch,3duqnn,WhereAreTheBears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:57:48 2015 UTC,The top of my wrist where my watch sits measures 2 inches.
AppleWatch,3duqnn,i4NDR3W,2,Sun Jul 19 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"It looks fine if that's what you're worried about. In my opinion though the 38 would probably look better. Source: my wrists are the same size and I found the 38 to fit and look better, and the battery life is not enough of an incentive to go with the bigger size. It's a preference thing more than anything."
AppleWatch,3duqnn,LoveExperimentation,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:57:17 2015 UTC,"I think it looks fine. Not too big and definitely not too small. The 38mm would probably be better on you, but the 42mm doesn't look bad. It's up to you."
AppleWatch,3duqnn,LoveExperimentation,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:58:02 2015 UTC,I would say it's less about the size of your wrists and more about the size of your finger.   42mm just allows for better touch accuracy when selecting apps.  I think the 38mm is just too small unless you have extremely small fingers.
AppleWatch,3duqnn,williagh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:11:37 2015 UTC,"I did notice that when using the 38, thank you. I guess my goal of posting this is..can I pull of the 42? :)"
AppleWatch,3duqnn,Karefree2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"Then yeah, absolutely. Big faced watches are very common. Check a fashion mag and you'll see them abundantly."
AppleWatch,3duqnn,Un-Limited,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:18:13 2015 UTC,Battery life is better with the 42.
AppleWatch,3duqnn,Berzerker7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:55 2015 UTC,"You could go either way, aesthetically; sounds like what you want is the 42. Go for it!"

I watch a youtube video where the guy linked vectors of the real sizes of the apple watch, that you could print out and cut, then place on your wrist. 😀"
AppleWatch,3duqnn,MacroFlash,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:32:29 2015 UTC,"I think the 42mm is a perfect fit for you. A good way to measure is if the lugs or edges of the watch meet the horizons of your wrist. Yours are barely under that size, and it makes it fit perfectly."
AppleWatch,3duqnn,Eriamjh1138,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:35:51 2015 UTC,"I have pretty small (but flat) wrists which seems to also apply to you. The sport band always looks silly because the rigidity of the band keeps it very far from my wrist unless I synch it down unreasonably tight. But, using any other band it looks just fine to me.  I have a 42mm Space Grey just like your pictures."
AppleWatch,3duqnn,WinterCharm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:16 2015 UTC,"It comes down to style and preference really. The 42mm doesn't look bad on you. I have small wrists for a dude, and my favorite watch prior was a 36mm, and when I tried on the 38mm stainless steel it was almost the exact same weight and feel. My 38 easily goes a day and half, but I could see the 42's increased battery life and screen size being a good enough reason to snag it. I stuck with the 38 because it felt like a watch I would wear regardless."
AppleWatch,3duqnn,Tech_fan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:57:01 2015 UTC,The 42 is surprisingly small compared to every other smart watch out there.  That's what I got.  173mm wrist here.
AppleWatch,3duqnn,ShezaEU,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:16:02 2015 UTC,"Hey! I posted a while ago because I was stuck in the same exact boat you were stuck in.

Your wrist size is right around where you can wear either size comfortably. What you'll want to get heavily depends on what you think will be best for you! :D   For a more toned down ""regular watch"" look, go with the 38mm. For a more ""smartwatch"" look, go with the 42mm."
AppleWatch,3duqnn,dkk8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:18:34 2015 UTC,"Big watches are the in fashion. It looks ok to me. The size difference is only 4 mm which is not a lot but, if it bugs you then go with the 38. If you look at the market representation, supposedly 70 some odd percent is 42mm and the remainder is the 38mm"
AppleWatch,3duqnn,ryanmercer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"I have 165mm wrists and was convinced by a friend and the Apple Store rep to go with the 38. I spent two days regretting that decision, gawping at how damn small the 38 is and wishing I went for the 42 I initially wanted.  I'm going to the store next week to be 100% sure of my choice before the 14 day return window is up, but more recently I have begun to appreciate that the 38 does look like the right size for my wrist. Literally my only concern is the screen size for text and, to a lesser extent, the battery life.  I would say if you want the 42 because of the screen, battery and genuine Leather Loop support, then keep it. But the 38 might look better."
AppleWatch,3duqnn,Marino4K,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:30:06 2015 UTC,"My opinion and preference but I got the 38mm because it looks more like a watch I'd wear on a regular basis. I wear a suit on a regular basis and while the 42 has more function, the 42 seemed a bit gadgety. Best thing to do is go in to the Apple Store wearing what you wear most often and try it on with that. The 42 looks better with a short sleeve but with long sleeve button ups I think the 38 looks more professional. Just my 2 cents."
AppleWatch,3duqnn,EVRYEDGE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:56:41 2015 UTC,I don't know what MM my wrists are but honestly I think the 42 is still too small. I'm curious to see if I like the size of the Rufus Cuff when it ships.
AppleWatch,3duqnn,iRichi3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:12:16 2015 UTC,42mm has a slightly better battery and the extra screen size is nice.

I've ordered adapters advertised as space grey sport from two different retailers, and both were just a matte black colour which were far too dark to be a proper SGS match.

Long story short, I'm looking for SGS adapters as well."

AppleWatch,3dtpjo,LordofPancakes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:15:10 2015 UTC,When did you order it? Just wondering if the seller may have better parts now. Now I'm a little concerned :/
AppleWatch,3dtpjo,SafariNZ,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:17:43 2015 UTC,It was about two weeks ago when I received it. It was a different seller on eBay however the product photos shown for the seller here are exactly the same down to the person's hand in the photo. Maybe my experience came down to variation in the production process if the quality control is sloppy.
AppleWatch,3dwe8e,FriggenChiggen,2,Mon Jul 20 02:20:56 2015 UTC,"Way to go!   My first perfect week too! My current calorie goal is 390, but I killed it three times this week with over 500. Afraid to see my new goal tomorrow, but man does it feel great to get all those awards!"

AppleWatch,3dwe8e,1st_thing_on_my_mind,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:33:38 2015 UTC,Right on. I just did my first perfect week as well. Wondering how you came to 400 calories being your target? I kept mine at 650 and having changed it because I dont know what a good number would be. I am thinking it should be higher?
AppleWatch,3dwe8e,1st_thing_on_my_mind,2,Mon Jul 20 03:49:43 2015 UTC,"Well for my suggestions for activity, light was 380, moderate was around 700 and most active was way up there. I hadn't been very active before the watch (video game junky), so I kept the goal low to begin. Since then, I've started running a lot, so I may have to up my goal in future weeks, make myself work that much harder. Basically gonna increase my goal bit by bit until I feel it's at a perfect spot!"
AppleWatch,3dud90,cjthelesser,4,Sun Jul 19 15:48:56 2015 UTC,Don't worry. You'll be back :)

AppleWatch,3dud90,_f0xx,4,Mon Jul 20 01:27:55 2015 UTC,It took me about two weeks to begin fully realizing its potential
AppleWatch,3dud90,Marino4K,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:31:52 2015 UTC,What would you say the full potential is? I'm interested in how people use their watches. :)
AppleWatch,3dud90,MawsonAntarctica,2,Sun Jul 19 18:44:49 2015 UTC,I use my watch as a watch. The fact that my face isn't always staring into my phone is the biggest plus. I'm now noticing more of the things around me.
AppleWatch,3dud90,Krypto_74,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:22:11 2015 UTC,"The notifications alone, let alone weatrher and fitness make it worth it, for me anyway"
AppleWatch,3dud90,Patagia,2,Mon Jul 20 12:07:47 2015 UTC,"I get that. I think once devs make apps for and integrate into the watch better you might come back. I'm looking forward to the new stuff! Honestly if they market right, i wouldn't be surprised if there's an Apple Sport Watch Christmas present rush."
AppleWatch,3dud90,Tech_fan,2,Sun Jul 19 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt I'll be back! Maybe once I get more into fitness I'll get one again. watchOS 2 looks promising, I can only imagine what the future holds!"
AppleWatch,3dud90,nidku53,2,Sun Jul 19 18:46:07 2015 UTC,What was your reason for returning it? I've had mine for 11 days and I'm in love with it.
AppleWatch,3dud90,Peckerpenis,3,Sun Jul 19 16:21:30 2015 UTC,"Like I mentioned before, I returned it because I was just using it as a watch. I rarely used apps, the only ones I did use were the timer and weather ones. I'm not exactly the most fit guy ever, so the fitness apps were just there. My job isn't the kind of job where I can stop and reply to messages via dictation, so there goes that.   All in all I loved the experience of it. I haven't given up on it. I think it's an amazing piece of technology and I will most likely be purchasing one again sometime in the future... But just not now. Don't really need it at the moment. Maybe once I become a bit more active (I want to start biking and exercising) I'll bite the bullet it again. That Space Black one keeps calling my name lol."
AppleWatch,3dud90,Peckerpenis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"In the same boat as you for similar reasons. I'm returning mine tomorrow and if I miss it after a week I'll pick another one up. Otherwise I'm going to wait until OS2 comes out (or Gen2 depending on how far out that is). While I love the watch and it has a ton of potential, there's just too many small bugs and incomplete features that irritate me."
AppleWatch,3dud90,Peckerpenis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"Its interesting because the initial reviews were skeptical about the overall potential of the product and some predicted it to be a flop. Now the reviews that I am reading all state that their Apple watch is a must have and Apple scored a homerun. This information is all based on what i have read recently within the last 2-3 weeks as opposed to what I have read back in April/May.   Also, you are pretty much right on track. I have worn smartwatches for the last 2 years. I have done the apps, etc.. and IMO it becomes more of an extension to your cell phone for notifications. That way, when you are in meetings and such, taking the phone out of your pocket attracts attention verses looking at your wrist."
AppleWatch,3dud90,Veeoh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:34:52 2015 UTC,"I honestly tell you that I mostly use it's as a watch. I don't care about workout feature too much because I do it a little a day just to walk indoor on a treadmill. Still it's tracking my activity on background and gather data to my iPhone it's interesting and I have fun to look it change next time. The benefit are there when I was in situation that can't pick an iPhone I still receive a call from my wrist, Sometime I control Music player on iPhone (that connect to car audio) from my wrist while drive a car. One more thing, Pay for a beautiful Watch that you love is not too much, May be you waste more money on something you not ever use it much. But for a watch that you can wear everyday I think worth it if you like it."
AppleWatch,3dw8tp,Bass_Cannon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look too bad to me, any chance you could just consider it a badge of honour to remember your hike by?"

I think the cases ruin the watch's look, but when doing something like hiking, it might be worth it for preventing future damage.  For the chip you currently have, you could use up one of your AppleCare ""accidental damage"" incidents (which costs $70).  I'm sure there's a cheaper option, but this might be worth it if you acquire some additional damage.  Edit: Assuming you have AppleCare+"
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,Tobar26th,6,Sun Jul 19 21:04:55 2015 UTC,You're basically polishing it with your skin.  It happens.
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,Eriamjh1138,3,Sun Jul 19 22:14:59 2015 UTC,"It's normal, those areas are just oils and friction rubbing it shiny, nothing to majorly worried about.  If you start seeing WEARING and TEARING of the material - like a roughness, then you can assume it is losing its integrity and give them a call...  Past that, it just looks like polishing with oils from our skin.  (I have the black sports band)"
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,dr3i_,3,Sun Jul 19 23:01:58 2015 UTC,"this has happened with every one. i have had 3 black sport bands; all do it  it will keep on happening, regardless of what they choose to help you with. i ended up just buying a leather loop and a green sports band, still have the black for when i want it."
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,omgnotanotherone,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:55:11 2015 UTC,Yes got mine within a couple of days. Let me know what they say.
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,ShezaEU,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"I have to say the AppleCare chat rep was very understanding but said that as I bought it retail a different Department dealt with such things, it's not a major issue to wait but I'm intrigued what they'll offer. Told they may offer replacement, refund or something else altogether. Guess we'll see eh? Will keep you all up to date with my results."
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,ShezaEU,2,Sun Jul 19 21:29:56 2015 UTC,I don't see how they can offer a replacement - it'll happen again within a few days. I'd advise you sell the replacement on if you get one. Unless they say it's a special fixed one or they tell you why it's happening & how to stop it.
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,ShezaEU,0,Sun Jul 19 22:05:28 2015 UTC,I suppose it depends how they see it. If they try and pass it off as a defective single one of if they acknowledge it as being 'a thing'. It'll be interesting to see their response. The black looks awesome but little bits of (non visible) deterioration are concerning so early on.  I'd think little of it but I change the size of the strap day to day depending on heat (my wrists are bang between two notches so heat makes one unconfortable and the other two loose) so occasionally the rubbing will show but not always.
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,reverendrichardwayne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:08:24 2015 UTC,Likewise with the two notches - but the marks only show up on the inside. I'm annoyed but it's understandable for me.
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,poortographer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:28:17 2015 UTC,"I spent about 30 mins on the phone with them and explained the problem and asked that they replace it with a white band outside of warranty and they agreed to it. So there is hope. I have the SS and I'm using both the white and green with it as sports bands now and neither of them have the problems the black did.   Edit: outside of the 14 day return window, I meant."
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,relatedartists,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:30:03 2015 UTC,I've had mine since shipping launch day. Lots of wear (shiny rub marks) on the inside of the band.... I really don't care because you never see them. It's even less concerning than not using a case with your iPhone and getting marks on the back of it.
AppleWatch,3dvdy1,relatedartists,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:28:01 2015 UTC,I've got this same issue and as everyone else is saying I'm tending to agree it's normal. But I would be very curious to know what the rep does and says about it so please do report what happens!
AppleWatch,3dvs92,roflomgwtfbbq,2,Sun Jul 19 23:06:09 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that breastfeeding would raise your resting calories only (NOT your active calories, or Move ring). What does the activity app currently say your resting and active calories burned are? I would compare that to a TDEE calculator for a breastfeeding woman of your height and weight."
AppleWatch,3dvs92,Berkshire0629,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, and resting calories are not quite what the Activity stuff is looking at. I think you're on to something though."
AppleWatch,3dvs92,Techsupportvictim,2,Mon Jul 20 02:41:20 2015 UTC,I would look for an app that will let you log the calories and feeds into Health
AppleWatch,3dvs92,Berzerker7,2,Mon Jul 20 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"Calories burned comes from a combination of your health information + heart rate, comparing against standard information from sources like the Mayo Clinic, WHO, etc.  If it's not something that increases your heart rate, then it can't really track it.  That being said, watchOS 2 will enable third-party apps to tap into the activity tracking, so perhaps an app in the future will be able to solve your issue."
AppleWatch,3dvs92,WinterCharm,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:25:58 2015 UTC,Makes sense that without an increased heart rate the watch can't track it.
AppleWatch,3dvs92,ratbastid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there's any way to measure that right now. It's certainly not something I've seen any third party applications for.  I'm not a doctor yet, so I can't exactly say how many calories may be used for breastfeeding, and milk production, although that's certainly a great question.  Thing is, even if we knew that information, aside from ""time spent breastfeeding"" there's really no other way to measure it, so I don't think it'd be terribly accurate - and I still don't have any idea how much it'd matter in your TDEE.   Edit: looking at this information, it appears that breastfeeding means you should add about 300-500 calories to what you need to take in. Damn, that's way more than I'd have guessed! https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/breastfeeding/conditioninfo/Pages/dga.aspx  I hope that helps you, and I hope apple adds something about it to the watch... :P  Send them some feedback, as this is an idea I haven't heard before, but it's certainly an interesting and useful idea.  http://www.apple.com/feedback/watch.html"
AppleWatch,3dvs92,WinterCharm,3,Sun Jul 19 23:26:45 2015 UTC,"Thing is, even if we knew that information, aside from ""time spent breastfeeding"" there's really no other way to measure it, so I don't think it'd be terribly accurate - and I still don't have any idea how much it'd matter in your TDEE.   Different women produce different milk volumes at different times--it's different across women, different during different stages of child development. For instance, when the kid is having a growth spurt, mom actually produces more milk. The hormonal biofeedback between mothers and babies is a really fascinating thing.  What's more my kid would eat until she was full, and then ""comfort nurse"", which isn't really nutritional, just very soothing for a baby.  So yes, you're absolutely right that merely clocking on-the-boob time isn't a good measure of the caloric facts of breastfeeding.  People who really Want to Know actually use a breast pump, measure the volume, and bottle-feed the baby. That's also done for kids who aren't gaining weight properly, so parents and docs can really know the kid is being fed enough."
AppleWatch,3dvs92,ratbastid,3,Mon Jul 20 13:49:52 2015 UTC,"Yes it's more than I thought too. My baby was just born Tuesday and holy shit am I hungry/thirsty when he is done nursing. I'm not used to being this hungry and want to make sure I'm taking in the necessary calories without going overboard. I think what I need is something more along the lines of My Fitness Pal, which should report data into Health IIRC, and then let my Watch add more data to get a complete picture.  Feedback to Apple is a great idea!! This may be something they'll consider tackling since they are adding reproductive health stats to all the software updates this fall - kind of related."
AppleWatch,3dvs92,WinterCharm,2,Mon Jul 20 02:46:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah! :D   Also, you should technically be able to use the ""other"" workout on your apple watch as a pretty decent substitute!

AppleWatch,3dtk61,princerafael,5,Sun Jul 19 09:05:27 2015 UTC,"No idea if this helps, but I worked for Apple in the UK from 2010-2014, and financing basically changes everything.  In your situation, the only solution – at least when I was working there – would be cancelling the finance agreement (within 14 days of purchase), returning the Watch you have and purchasing the new one with a fresh transaction. If you can't pay the full amount of the new Watch you want with cash, then you can use the cash you have as a deposit to lower the amount you finance.  The original purchaser would be the only person who can cancel the finance agreement, though.  Of course, I could be entirely wrong or this information could be useless to you – finance procedures differ from country to country depending on provider (it was Barclays in the UK) and it's been over a year since I worked at Apple, so this may all have changed."

Save you money today and buy the watch that you'll use for the next few years next year."

The large consensus is not every year, and even if it is every year, the watch just came out 3 months ago. You still have at least 9 months before the next one gets released.  Personally, I have the SS w/ ML (along with the LB and a couple sport bands) and I absolutely love it. Extremely happy I didn't go with the Sport model."

AppleWatch,3dt75y,mplsatom,2,Sun Jul 19 05:35:46 2015 UTC,"I returned my aluminum for a SS, so yes you can.   In terms of upgrades, I don't buy the ""it'll be obsolete in a year"" spiel. I think that it's much more likely to be a granular device. Unlike, say, a smartphone, it isn't a necessity and it doesn't face fierce competition from other manufacturers. I'd guess that first of all, we won't see a second gen before April 2016, and I think even then it will be an upgrade of internals only - longer battery life for example. I think Apple is going to treat this like a fashion product in terms of upgrades. That is, when Burberry bring out a new bag design it stays around for decades, however, the styling and options for that bag differ by season and other styles of bags are released alongside it. I believe that in 2 years we may well see new editions (colored metals, platinum, tungsten, titanium, different colored digital crowns, etc.) of the apple watch but that will ship alongside the original classic design. That's how you turn your accessory into an icon rather than a fleeting style.   I think the focus on expensive bands is what really gives this strategy away. The margins on them are clearly much higher than on the watch itself which leads me to believe that it's much more likely that we'll see dozens of new beautiful band designs in the future rather than dozens of new watch designs.   So really I think you're safe to invest right now. I highly doubt Apple is going to put this on the same upgrade cycle as an ordinary tech product. There will be upgrades but I think they're keenly aware that this isn't the type of thing people will willingly upgrade every 1/2 years. So to create long term value for the consumer they will probably hold off on an ""Apple watch air"" in 9 months time."

It's not like the world is going to end. And just a piece of advice for OP, if you want to sell your watch in pristine condition buy apple care plus and right before you sell it/ run out of apple care+ just break the damn thing and get a new one from apple.

AppleWatch,3dt2dq,FluorescentTurban,2,Sun Jul 19 04:36:03 2015 UTC,"It uses an accelerometer to measure acceleration. Your watch accelerates in one direction, then the other for every step. As long as you are moving your watch back and forth in a relatively even manner it should have no problem. Obviously if you are moving in a more complex pattern it will not be as accurate, but I think you will find it is pretty good in most normal situations."

AppleWatch,3dtf71,ShezaEU,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:06:45 2015 UTC,"Just sell the thing and save up for a new one. I know there's usually a bad stigma when it comes to buying extended warranties at electronics stores, but as you probably know by now Applecare is worth it, at least on the watches. On computers it's not really gonna leave the desk but when I'm out an around I can't just tell myself to never fall down and bump into things and the protection is totally worth it for me."

AppleWatch,3ds9al,RockyRaccoonM5,2,Sat Jul 18 23:43:28 2015 UTC,"its a design marvel, the clasp folds into the same thickness as the band, the band is customizable without the need for tools, the gradual curves that frame the watch, i think its worth it, it isn't an easy thing to design and make, and it keeps it special"
AppleWatch,3ds9al,Darekbarquero,-3,Sun Jul 19 04:06:58 2015 UTC,"That kind of clasp has been around for awhile. Any hidden clasp or luxury watch has a similarly profile. Is it innovative for a smart watch? Yes. But in terms of being special in the watch world, far from it."

This is like people who go out and get the Otterbox Defender for their phone. Unless you work in construction or something you don't need this kind of accessory, just be careful."

AppleWatch,3dscsr,Yeats,4,Sun Jul 19 00:15:16 2015 UTC,It all comes down to how much extra cash you have and how you want that watch to look. You might be better served buying a better phone next time. You might not.   Don't do something because your neighbors do. Do something because it makes you happy- even if it simultaneously makes your neighbors happy.

AppleWatch,3dsnkm,Wheelscartog,2,Sun Jul 19 01:58:33 2015 UTC,"Very true. I pre-ordered a AWS with white band, but decided against it for a SGS at the last minute. Luckily they had one last one without a reserve sticker on it and I was on my way."
AppleWatch,3dsnkm,Krypto_74,6,Sun Jul 19 11:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can, but honestly the reserving process was actually pretty cool. Walking in, having someone there to help you set it up (even if you don't need help), in and out in five minutes, such a good experience. Plus, reserving it isn't really a commitment by you, but a commitment by them that they'll have yours there for you."
AppleWatch,3dsnkm,Ctrl_Alt_Abstergo,2,Sun Jul 19 02:43:23 2015 UTC,"I really liked this too. As a true Apple fan, I knew I wanted one for months, and had watched all the unboxing videos that I could stomach, so I knew what it was capable of and how to do it. But, having the Apple rep walk me through it was lots of fun and that encounter convinced my friend who never even wanted a watch before that she needed one just because of the customer service you get."
AppleWatch,3dsnkm,Krypto_74,2,Sun Jul 19 11:47:54 2015 UTC,"The preorder experience was pretty awesome for the most part. The only part I didn't like was when I went to the watch at the setup table the employee told me I didn't have to stick around while the watch was setting up my content and installing apps, and this was after I asked him if it was ok if I stuck around to have my watch setup the first time. I just wanted to leave the store with the watch all prepared!"
AppleWatch,3dsnkm,Deedubau,4,Sun Jul 19 16:00:16 2015 UTC,"Yes. I did on Saturday.     Edit: they seriously over-did it with the packaging, I thought. The box is huge."

AppleWatch,3dsnkm,alosec_,3,Sun Jul 19 02:33:33 2015 UTC,The only difference between reserving and going in store is you're def gonna get the watch you want since it's already set aside when it's reserved. After you check in for your reservation the process is exactly the same as if you walk in.
AppleWatch,3dsnkm,OGErrlChef,2,Sun Jul 19 12:36:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, but just make the appointment. Even if you can't keep it. It could save you a big headache."

AppleWatch,3dsnkm,mplsatom,2,Sun Jul 19 05:13:03 2015 UTC,Yes and the reservation process at my local store was pointless because nobody was there to greet me and I looked like a mug for 15 minutes trying to find someone (everyone was seemingly very busy).
AppleWatch,3dsnkm,ShezaEU,2,Sun Jul 19 09:52:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, here locally. We can't even reserve some anymore. Went in, purchased and had a personal setup session. Depends on local availability and conditions, I guess."
AppleWatch,3dsnkm,drdissector,2,Sun Jul 19 10:22:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't reserve, I bought one and I got the same experience all the users above are describing.... Don't know if I'm a one off or if that's just apple protocol"
AppleWatch,3dply3,smpx,10,Sat Jul 18 05:40:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you know that technically, there's no such thing.      Apple doesn't really want us writing pure apps for the watch – they want us to think of it as an extension of the phone. And the limitations in Interface Builder reflect that.    Want to put an object at specific coordinates? There's no direct way to do it. Want to animate something going across the screen? Well, you can put it in a group, make the group right-justified, and modify the width of the group over time...    Or you can create every possible frame and switch to it... see what I'm getting at?    That said, I'm writing a game in which all of the graphics and classes are in the WatchKit folder, so everything happens locally. It's extremely limiting, but there's still plenty you can do. It's kind of like writing for those old LCD platforms.    If you want anything more complicated than that, the computation (and rendering) has to be done on the phone and sent to the watch. Which is fine, but it doesn't have the frame rates that you'd want for some kinds of applications."
AppleWatch,3dply3,Zthulu,4,Sat Jul 18 13:55:09 2015 UTC,"From what I understand all the logic for the ""watch app"" is on the watch rather than on the phone. But they are still expected to be an extension with the phone. A lot of the heavy lifting will still need to be on the phone. But certain libraries and classes are on the watchOS like you can make an NSURLSession on the watch and make URL calls"
AppleWatch,3dply3,naughty_ottsel,2,Sat Jul 18 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"You can just extend InterfaceController or add classes inside the WatchKit Extension folder, and you can put graphics directly into the watch extension, so you can do plenty right on the watch.    It's just not how it was designed, though. It's more of a philosophy thing than a hard limit, but you'll run into problems quickly if you try to do too much – both in Interface Builder, and in lots of Swift functionality that just hasn't been ported to WatchKit."
AppleWatch,3dply3,Zthulu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:39:47 2015 UTC,First WatchKit doesn't need to be ported over to Swift. Swift is built to interop with Objective-C. There is no need for it to be ported.  Second if you read the transition guide for watchOS 2 https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppleWatch2TransitionGuide/index.html  The extension runs on the watch. Using available system technologies on the watch the watch app can run without the phone being in range. However technologies not available in the SDK must use the phone.
AppleWatch,3dply3,naughty_ottsel,3,Sat Jul 18 17:05:10 2015 UTC,I've been trying to get around the fact that the watch only has a number of frameworks. My app is dependent on Firebase at the moment. I could do a hybrid thing where the phone does some of the lifting but its been limiting.
AppleWatch,3dply3,oklarican,2,Sat Jul 18 18:20:59 2015 UTC,"WatchOS is still pretty limited at the moment, especially in terms of customizing views. I'm finding the build process still a bit buggy (thanks, Xcode). Once the beta kinks have been fixed, it should be fine for simple ""download this data and display it in a table"" type apps."
AppleWatch,3dply3,chriswaco,2,Sat Jul 18 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"I am. It's the same as it was before, but now there are nicer libraries to deal with data between the watch and the phone, and you have access to all the APIs for the digital crown, accelerometer, microphone, video, etc.  I agree with the others, though, about UI design. It's not the same whatsoever to design with watch interface controllers as it with phone view controllers and it's not intuitive. I feel boxed in by what I can do, but that will change over time with iterations to libraries and hardware."

AppleWatch,3drrki,ShezaEU,-1,Sun Jul 19 10:01:56 2015 UTC,What is $200 dollars in the long run?
AppleWatch,3drrki,tangoshukudai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:12:36 2015 UTC,Except with Apple it's never really the long run is it - this first gen product will be obsolete soon. It'll perhaps be two years - like the jump from a iPhone 5 to an iPhone 6 - but then we will need to upgrade for the latest Watch OS to function. It's money I don't have.
AppleWatch,3drrki,ShezaEU,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:12:25 2015 UTC,"iPhone 4s is still a nice iPhone for many many people and it is almost 4 years old, and it will be continually updated for at least iOS 9.  Also if you sold your apple product each year you could recoup 80-90% of the value.  Also why don't you have an extra $200?"
AppleWatch,3drrki,tangoshukudai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:23:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about 80-90% of the value. I think if I sold my iPhone 6 right now I wouldn't get £500 for it, which slightly more than 80% of the amount it cost me. Another issue is scratches and stuff lowering the value - I get that on the SS you won't scratch the screen but you can get dings and marks right?  The reason I don't have $200 to spare (besides the additional fact that my dream watch combo would be the £600 SS with ML and thus cost an additional $400 if converted) is because I'm a student. I know, I shouldn't be buying an Apple Watch anyway, but when you're a geeky fan boy like me, what can you do?"
AppleWatch,3drrki,ShezaEU,-3,Sun Jul 19 14:29:55 2015 UTC,"Are you including tax in your estimate?  Because here in the US, we can sell apple products a year out easily for 90-80% of the cost (minus tax).  Also what does having a student have to do with why you are broke?  Don't you have a part time job?"
AppleWatch,3drrki,tangoshukudai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:51:20 2015 UTC,"No because I don't think we do tax when it comes to second hand sales. In fairness there is one going on eBay with 20 bids at £500 with 2 hours left, which is surprising, but it's in better condition than mine I reckon."
AppleWatch,3drrki,ShezaEU,0,Sun Jul 19 14:53:59 2015 UTC,That is why we take care of our stuff.
AppleWatch,3drrki,tangoshukudai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:00:50 2015 UTC,"I do take care of my stuff. I just didn't get a screen protector on it - and I doubt you have one on your lovely SS watch.  My iPhone has been in a case since Day 1 for all the good that's done it, there are still marks on the casing, inexplicably, and despite only putting the phone in a trouser / short / whatever pocket - completely devoid of any other objects - it still managed to accumulate a number of scratches to the screen. Gorilla Glass or Ion-X or whatever is, quite frankly, complete bollocks. How YouTube review channels can attack iPhone screens with keys and a knife and have it come away free from scratches is beyond me."
AppleWatch,3drrki,ShezaEU,0,Sun Jul 19 16:53:41 2015 UTC,Have you asked Apple if they'd be prepared to replace the screen with sapphire at your cost?

Since it's not metal, the swelling of your wrists won't bother you nearly as much since the material can slightly expand to account for it.

A few of my favorite apps are: • Workout (very easy to use & accurate) • Feedly (Displays more articles than any other app IMO) • Yahoo Weather (Visual A+, nice setup) • The Score (my personal favorite app to keep up to date with news & scores.

That said, I do have a Sports Band and it's slightly better for working out than the Link bracelet but not by much.   So far, it looks flawless, no dings or scratch. I've worn watches every day for 5-6 years now so I'm not really bumping it into walls and door frames anymore like when I first started wearing a watch every day.

You'd add data to the app, I suppose via the share sheet or simple copy and paste, and then these tidbits of data would be viewable on the watch?  It could be done, I suppose."
AppleWatch,3dqmrt,ShezaEU,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:58:10 2015 UTC,Exactly.   Purpose is to give me quick reference back to information I'll want to glance at regularly.   Would even be better if I could set a specific document to be a glance.  Makes it very quick to look at.

AppleWatch,3dqmrt,marinojesse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:55:24 2015 UTC,"It's not that I couldn't do it with Evernote.  I could do it with email. I could do it with the message app.  It's similar to the purpose of having a documents folder.  Very quick access to a small number of documents I refer to very often.   But I don't want to have to search for these particular documents everytime I load the app.  I want these right there when it loads.  Now, if Evernote (or this ficticious Apple watch app) would let me pin a particular note to the home screen and all I had to do was click that to pull up that particular note, that would be nice...  But spare me loading times pulling it from the server.  These particular notes I want very local an quick/easy to look at quickly..  Faster than unlocking my phone."

The glass feels nicer, the watch itself is shinier. I tried it and ultimately, I prefer it without.    If I fuck it up, that's what AC+ is for."

AppleWatch,3dnlfe,thezez,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:40:24 2015 UTC,Aftermarket Blue Classic Buckle I love the band. Wore it for 3 days and one screw in the adapter got loose. When I took it off it fell and I lost it. Luckily I also have a WatchShoppe set of adapters that came with 2 extra screws. I replaced it and made sure all were tight. If anything I'll check them every few days since I wear the sports band when I sleep and st work.

If your professors get shitty about your watch lighting up or buzzing, they need to remember where the responsibility in their job vs your job lies. It's not their job to make you pay attention.

As for normal classes treat it like you would a cell phone. I wouldn't expect any professor to confiscate it without warning or reason.

Primarily, people say the length is too long (similar to the ""large"" size of the apple brand one, but with no other options), the connectors do not fit snugly, there are gaps between the watch and the band where the connectors fit, magnets are not as strong as the original LL, and the leather starts to wear down and deteriorate very quickly.  Though the one OP linked to does not have any reviews at all, I have a feeling most of these 3rd party leather loops are all made by the same big manufacturer churning these out by the thousands and reselling to smaller distributors through markets like Alibaba.

Right now I am at 28 laps in 30 minutes. Im a slow swimmer. So from the watch I get an overall calorie count and time and then I count the laps using the tiles and a water cup and get overall distance.   Now if you want stroke distance, stroke efficiencty, etc, you would need a true swimmers watch. They are very specific and have specific software. I am not sure the sampling rate of the watch, including any distance markers is accurate enough to figure those things out.

AppleWatch,3dq3zt,RancidMeat2112,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:39:57 2015 UTC,"Not a necessity. However, it is pretty cool if you're into Apple products. I get a ton of text messages during work that I don't necessarily have to respond to, so it's been pretty convenient for that, but really, its not that hard taking the phone out of the pocket..."
AppleWatch,3dq3zt,nycsemaj,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:29:15 2015 UTC,Depends on your interests and your resources. If fitness tracking is important to you. Yes. If the cost is a real reach. Probably not.   I have one and would not give it back even if they asked and payed a bonus. (Well . . . how big a bonus?)
AppleWatch,3dq3zt,williagh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:10:58 2015 UTC,It is a personal device. And therefore a personal financial decision. People can tell you if it was worth it for them. But only you can decide what's worth your money.   I hope you at least try it out because the return policies are very good.
AppleWatch,3dq3zt,Yeats,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the Apple Watch is a hit or miss. I got mine because my friend had one and I thought it was pretty cool. Also, when he let me wear it I liked the experience I had playing with it. After a few days of me going back and forth on it I decided to go pick one up since I knew I had 14 days with it until I couldn't get a refund.  After playing with it for a few hours and managing to get it all set up I was in love with it! Sending those little drawling and taps to my friend was pretty awesome! Also, I loved being able to see text messages right on my wrist and the fitness tracker was pretty cool and it actually encouraged me to be more active!   Unfortunately, after a few days things started to go down hill... I started to notice all the little bugs it had and that it was so slow in some cases it would have been quicker just to pull out my phone. Additionally when I started to think about how much I spent on it ($426 and it was the 42mm sport in Space Grey) it was pretty painful for me to think about how many hours I worked just to get that money. That ultimately led me to return it a couple days later. For me it just doesn't do enough to justify spending that much money.   All in all, you need to pick one up for yourself and try it out and see if it does enough for you to be worth your money.   Pros:  -Neat idea  -I like seeing text messages on my wrist -Lots of potential  -Amazing build quality -Beautiful display   Cons:  -Ugly design (reminds me of a cheap kiddie digital watch)  -Battery life was eh IMO -Didn't bring enough to the table  -The price tag is absolutely ludicrous (this reason is what ultimately made me return it)  -Slow in some cases (But will be fixed in the next update)"
AppleWatch,3dq3zt,Burthurt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:16:30 2015 UTC,"Benefits:  - Notifications  - Quick weather check - Distance tracking and music playback during workout (not for everyone)  - Looks dope as fuck  - Conversation starter (can be good or bad)  Something else of note is that the watch is of extremely high build quality. With that said, it's certainly overpriced.   The drawbacks:  - Expensive  - Gotta charge every night  - No GPS for workout tracking or Maps without phone  - Conversation starter (can be good or bad)   I personally love it. I've owned mine for 3 days and I'm already leaning towards keeping it after my two week return window."
AppleWatch,3dq3zt,alosec_,0,Sat Jul 18 12:55:20 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question requires the answer to these questions.   During an average week, how many kilometers do you walk?  If you do not know the answer to question 1, is that because you have a principled objection to tracking your fitness? Where is your iPhone 6+ when it is not in your hand? If a video maker needed to film a masked person take an iPhone out of his pocket and put it back one thousand times, would you be willing to perform this, uncredited, for €2.00? On your iPhone 6+, have you marked some of your contacts as Favorites? On your iPhone 6+, do you know what the Do Not Disturb feature does? Have you assigned specific ringtones to any of your contacts so that you can tell who is calling or texting without looking? Do your days differ significantly from each other? That is, do you have meetings and appointments with different people at different times, or is every day ""Wake up. Eat. Work. Eat. Relax. Sleep."" ? Do you behave better when you think someone is watching? Usually, in order to buy something which is scarce, you must pay more in either money or effort than most people are willing to pay. A good can be scarce, and yet not be flawless. When you pay a high price so that you can own a scarce, flawed, item, do the flaws make you so angry that you regret the purchase and wish that you had waited until either a less-flawed version of the item was available or the scarcity-premium had reduced?"

When it isn't working it will measure 60-80 bpm when it was previously measuring 130-140. Or it will just say ""Measuring...""  I actually flipped my watch around so the crown wouldn't press against my glove which would lift the watch off my wrist slightly and mess up the heart rate monitor.  Some days it is fine, but I have it as tight as I can make it, and I have to keep it in place up away from my hand which can be difficult when I get sweaty.   I think the road vibrations can affect it. If I hold it up and look at it, it will eventually get a good reading, but that's not very useful when you're on the road."

The strap is really good quality. I bought each separately. These are on a 42mm Space Gray Sport.  The Stouch adaptors are great. They fit in snug and evenly. The color isn't an exact match with the space gray but I can live with that.   The olive strap from Clockwork Synergy is great quality. It isn't made for an Apple Watch per se, but it fits great on the adaptor. It takes up all of the adaptor bar so you don't get the sliding from left to right that you get on most of the third party bands you find online.  I also included an image of my inspiration.

If you're worried about what others think, I'd say it's a non-issue considering most left-handed people wear it that way. If you're worried about comfort I'd say within a couple of weeks of daily wear it'll start feeling natural.

AppleWatch,3diu8t,KittenSwagger,6,Thu Jul 16 19:17:00 2015 UTC,"I'm going to throw out a negative review on these for your consideration.  Firstly, at the price point, there's little risk in trying them out for yourself. I did and I tried the other cheap bluetooth pair that's been circulating (QY7). I returned the Mpow Cheeta and the QY7 pair I destroyed in the wash by accident. Compared to the $400 watch I am wearing, $20 some was nothing to try out a pair of headphones.  I found both pairs sub-par for virtually the same reasons. The sound wasn't very good, but I can deal with that since I was only really using them for running in. The QY7 had slightly better sound, but the overall convenience outweighs the sound quality for me. There wasn't very much bass and, IMO, there's no comparison to the EarPods. The EarPods blow them away. I'm not an audiophile, though.  I had sporadic connection issues with both pairs. I ran around my block a few times with the Mpow Cheetahs and left my phone at home. For some reason, whenever I got near my house as I was rounding a lap, the earbuds lost connection completely. I had to reconnect them via bluetooth. I don't know if this is common for bluetooth devices or not and it could be a glitch with the watch in general. Sometimes both pairs would just unpair for seemingly no reason, but not often enough to be a deal breaker for me.  The REAL deal breaker for both pairs were that they wouldn't stay in my ears for anything. I tried all the ear cushion sizes (and for the QY7, I tried every combo of ear cushion and plastic support thing I could)) to no avail. I got the Cheetahs second because I thought they would wrap around my ear and provide more support. They don't really. The wire that connects the L and R earbuds is stiff, so it does hug closer to your head, which is nice, but the actual earbuds don't wrap around and hold onto your ears. Periodically during my run they would pop out of my ears and almost fall off. If they didn't pop all the way out, one would get loose and make the sound off.  For what it's worth, I do have this issue often, though I don't with the EarPods. I prefer regular headphones that cover the ears because of this, but I've never has as bad an issue as I did with these. I just wanted to give a little perspective from someone who returned the Mpow Cheetahs (and would have the QY7s if I didn't break them)."
AppleWatch,3diu8t,DangerBrigade,2,Thu Jul 16 19:48:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up. Have you found any headphones that don't cut out when you're streaming music from your watch alone? My wireless headphones do the same thing now even after getting a replacement watch.

After about 3 months the battery barely lasts 20 minutes now. It loses the bluetooth connection ALL THE TIME which is super frustrating while you're working out.

Sound quality isn't as great as the ear pods, but it's still decent. Like most others here, I got them for exercise and mowing the lawn without fear of wires getting tangled/ripped. Works great for what I want them to do, for the price.   9/10 stars"

AppleWatch,3diu8t,sidious911,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:34:16 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, I use these for the gym, work great. Battery life is good, they are comfortable, and they stay firmly in place without anything tossing around. No need to take them off regardless of the exercise you are doing.  I've heard better sound before but they are nowhere near terrible sounding, especially for the price point."
AppleWatch,3diu8t,KittenSwagger,2,Thu Jul 16 17:42:18 2015 UTC,I actually think the pair i have sounds great. They have some surprising bass and loudness to them for how small/cheap they are.
AppleWatch,3diu8t,sidious911,2,Thu Jul 16 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"That is what I mean, they don't compare to many other Bluetooth head sets out there in sound, but many of them exceed $100 if not more. For their price point they are bang on, I never listen to them and think they sound bad."

AppleWatch,3diu8t,burlow44,3,Thu Jul 16 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"No they don't, but they stay on your head and in your ears no matter what you're doing. So its worth it in that regard."
AppleWatch,3diu8t,KittenSwagger,2,Thu Jul 16 20:07:51 2015 UTC,I think better.

AppleWatch,3dna9w,catsnstuffz,3,Fri Jul 17 17:54:28 2015 UTC,I totally agree! Milanese just wasn't my style so that's why i went with this one.

AppleWatch,3dkvor,HardcoreObsessive,2,Fri Jul 17 05:48:24 2015 UTC,Leather loop is ribbed thus it does not come lose once the magnets are clicked in place.
AppleWatch,3dkvor,ianfann,2,Fri Jul 17 06:05:28 2015 UTC,Sometimes it readjusts itself but nothing compared to my Milanese loop. It's a different feel. The way the Milanese clasps isn't the same as the Loop. The loop is more comfortable for me.

I'm fairly sure that even at partner companies, these payments are currently just being processed as contactless card payments, hence the £20 limit. Contactless transactions will occasionally ask you to insert your card and put in your PIN just to make sure it's really you using the card.  Hopefully once the terminals are updated with the proper Apple Pay software, they'll be clever enough to recognise that you have in fact authorised the payment either through your fingerprint on your iPhone or your passcode on your Apple Watch."

It's cool that the watch can connect via peer-to-peer wifi, but I think you'll find that you'll need it so rarely that it's not worth the loss of wifi speed on your phone. But to answer your question, no. They're completely different signals so regardless if you were previously connected to your phone on a 2.4ghz wifi connection your watch will no longer be able to connect via wifi as soon as you switch it over to the 5ghz signal."

AppleWatch,3djo9v,urge55,3,Fri Jul 17 00:45:41 2015 UTC,"I spent some time testing this a few days ago, this what I found on watchOS 1.0.1.   The Watch will connect to any networks your phone knows about that are on 2.4 GHz. (Unless it's configured by a profile)  If your phone has remembered connections to a 2.4 GHz and a 5 GHz network, the watch can connect to the 2.4 GHz while the phone connects to 5 GHz. If these Wi-Fi networks are on the same network the watch and phone can communicate.   If you want your phone to prefer the 5 GHz network you should name the networks so that it's first alphabetically.   So, if you have a 5GHZ network named 'A1' and a 2.4GHZ networked named 'A2' and your phone can connect to both - the phone will automatically connect to 'A1' while the watch connects to 'A2'.  I would assume the same works for watchOS 2."
AppleWatch,3djo9v,xshareddx,2,Fri Jul 17 05:01:37 2015 UTC,Most networks if you're using the same router for 2.4 and 5 it doesn't matter if you're connected to different ones for devices to communicate
AppleWatch,3djo9v,-AdamTheGreat-,2,Fri Jul 17 07:18:27 2015 UTC,"Here's what I found:  If your router has different SSIDs for the 2.4 and 5GHz, then you have to add your iPhone to both SSIDs. This will allow the watch to ""know"" the 2.4GHz SSID.  I have the same SSID for both 2.4 and 5GHz. There are some mixed opinions on this. Some say it is better, some say it is worse. I know in most of our enterprise environments we use the same SSID for both frequencies and let the router decide based on signal strength."

You can install OS 2 through the iPhone if you are on iOS 9 developer beta and register the watch as a developer device. As for getting into DFU mode and downgrading, there's really no way for any user/developer to get into it, Apple has a service if you call AppleCare where you can send in the watch and they will downgrade it for you probably using the diagnostic port, but it's unknown how they go about it."

The cost will be lower (or you will get more bang for the buck), it will be faster, have solid apps, have better integration, etc, etc, etc.  It is just like the original iPhone, it had huge hype but the numbers were low until the 3G hit (and the world adopted it) same with the iPad too."
AppleWatch,3dhu7a,tangoshukudai,0,Thu Jul 16 13:41:47 2015 UTC,"I know in the case of the first iPhone, it was the simple fact that it wasn't available on Verizon and I was on contract that I didn't get one. I'm sure it was the case for others, too. So I don't necessarily agree with that comparison.  I think perhaps more accurate would be the iPad. I was one of the people that said, ""Well, it's a gigantic iPod touch ... why do I need one?""  Fast forward today, and they are ubiquitous.   I gave the Apple Watch a whirl for about two weeks. I thought it was a cool product. I went into it not expecting a whole lot. The only thing that bothered me immensely was the price. I still do think it's incredibly overpriced, and I probably wouldn't look into buying one again unless it came down."
AppleWatch,3dhu7a,nextgeneric,4,Thu Jul 16 14:32:41 2015 UTC,"Genuinely curious, why do you feel that the watch is overpriced? It starts at $350. When you consider the incredible amount of technology that's been miniaturized onto such a small device (processor, heart rate monitor, retina display, motion sensors, wifi, bluetooth, ability to make phone calls, etc.) I really think it's an actual bargain. You can still walk into any number of stores and buy watches for that price (quartz ones even) that literally do nothing but tell the time, and possibly the date. That's it. Even the stainless steel models do far more than their competitors at the same price. You have to remember that this is a whole different category too when you're dealing with precious metals. It's not just a gadget, it's a piece of jewelry as well."
AppleWatch,3dhu7a,arrozconguandu,3,Thu Jul 16 18:43:51 2015 UTC,I agree. Overpriced? Compared to what?   I think the comparison some make it to the phone which price is opaque to many people who essentially buy it on time (from the phone company).
AppleWatch,3dhu7a,williagh,0,Fri Jul 17 00:44:26 2015 UTC,"It doesn't feel timeless. It's quality and build does not, in my opinion, compare to something like a traditional watch - many of which are built so intricately and have impressive internal mechanisms.   I'm not knocking AAPL's I.D., but to me personally it just simply feels like a circuit board in a case (which I didn't really come to appreciate in my two weeks with it). The software, while it wasn't terribly bothersome, felt unpolished and inconsistent.  It's certainly cool that they've packed all this tech into a smart watch. I just realized in my 2 weeks with it the product is not for me. It's not something I can honestly say is a good investment. I can pull out my phone quickly to do a majority that can be done with the watch. Many close friends who purchased one had the same thing to say and have returned theirs.

Keep your steampunk wind-up watch, I prefer up-to-date connectivity. At the price, there's nothing even in the same league.   Actually, a better comparison would be cars and bikes. ""I think $1,000 for a car is ridiculously overpriced - for that money I could get a fully functional ""classic"" bicycle that does essentially the same thing."" But it would be a crappy bike with approximately 0 of the features that the car has. Sure, you wouldn't need to charge it as often, but you can't really use it in the same way, either."

I had a LG G watch for a while, and it killed me to lose it when I went back to the iPhone. My only consolation was the apple watch that was coming soon.  Got it day one, and I gotta say, I'm not impressed.  If I could switch back without losing all the integration I have with my other apple products, I'd do it in a second."

Let the device marinate for a bit and lets see how much it grows and gets better with software updates.  I agree. People aren't giving it a chance to prove itself.

But seriously, as they're intending to make a big splash with the launch of the new watch OS in the Fall, and they still haven't passed through a holiday season with the existing hardware... I'd guess it as ""extremely unlikely"" that they'll announce new hardware already. Logistically speaking, that would just lead more cautious people to wait on buying the watch, resulting in fewer people buying the first apple watch then upgrading to the second later. Not good business practice."
AppleWatch,3dmd6l,jelbee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:47:22 2015 UTC,"That's what I've been thinking they announced it in September but it wasn't until the year after that the apple watch was ""announced"" and subsequently released.

AppleWatch,3dmd6l,jelbee,2,Fri Jul 17 13:54:42 2015 UTC,"I'm saying the current watch is the flagship device because it's the only one that exists right now.   Watch OS2 will improve the current watch, and hopefully drive more sales to saturate the market more heavily with the first apple watch before they even think about announcing/releasing the second one.  You'll get different answers from different people, but... in my opinion, if you're really interested in the watch, and are wondering if you should wait for the second one... I'd be prepared to wait the better part of a year."

AppleWatch,3dmd6l,beckerola,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:32 2015 UTC,"Its all just speculation at the moment. The answer will change depending on who you speak to. Nobody outside of Apple really knows.  I personally don't think they intend to release a new watch every year. I don't believe they can't expect the same upgrade rate for a watch as they do for a phone. Was the watch is perceived and used varies wildly from that of a phone, and this changes how often people would be prepared to buy a new one. Furthermore, the apple watch is one of the most expensive products they make (counting the edition in this case). Many celebrities have bought it, and its almost a status symbol for those who do have it. Asking these people to change their watch <6 months after it was released in some countries (assuming September/October launch) would not put them at a favourable light with some of their most prized customers, as well everyone else who would have basically just received their watch by the time the new one comes out.  Of course, I am perfectly capable of being wrong here. I wouldn't put money on it.  That being said, you can already think of what you might want from a watch, and if the current generation has these things. Rumours suggest ideas such as a camera on it (I'm not sure about this one tbh), maybe a circular screen (it would fit with the UI), more powerful processor, and maybe a bit thinner. On that last point, its more a matter of taste. Some people like thicker watches.  Since nobody knows, when I decided to make the leap and buy this generation of Apple watch, I merely asked myself two questions: would I be very disappointed if I bought the watch now, and a new one came out in October with these new features? Can I wait another year without the watch if it doesn't come out?"
AppleWatch,3dmd6l,Ohsneezeme,2,Fri Jul 17 14:03:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply, your point about changing watches every year does seem to go against what a watch is about so Apple may address this"
AppleWatch,3dmd6l,omgnotanotherone,2,Fri Jul 17 14:16:24 2015 UTC,"Thats mostly my thinking. Then again I'm thinking from the perspective of a consumer and not a business.   Theres also the problem of a high adoption rate. I don't know how many apple watches they sold, but it seems like a lot. Unlike phone whereby someone can change from an andriod to an iphone at will, the apple watch requires a compatible iPhone, and so its easy to determine how big the market is. If people are not willing to upgrade a watch every year, then releasing Apple Watch 2 in October would only address the market that currently owns a compatible iPhone, and still wants an apple watch. I don't think thats many people..."
AppleWatch,3dmd6l,Hynil,2,Fri Jul 17 14:20:54 2015 UTC,"considering how recently orders have been fulfilled for the the current watch, I don't think an update to the hardware will come until later next year. They've only been available to buy in-store for a couple of weeks (in the UK)."

Here is a link to the Beats Updater software needed to update them"

AppleWatch,3dh53f,metalhaze,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:29:15 2015 UTC,There are better ways to accomplish this.  You can use IFTTT to turn on/off lights automatically if you are the only resident n the home when you come and go. If you share the household you can install life360 on everyone's mobile device to track location and then combine that with IFTTT to turn off all lights when the last person leaves and on when the first person arrives.
AppleWatch,3dh53f,HeathenCyclist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:54:00 2015 UTC,"Wait, I thought one of the selling points of companies integrating into HomeKit was to allow you to do this without this complicated work around that you created.  Does HomeKit also only work on local wifi? I thought you could control things outside of your home network.   I understand that Phillips Hue probably hasn't integrated with HomeKit yet so this is a good solution for right now, but I don't think you will need this solution anymore in the near future.  Also, why not just use IFTTT to set up a geofence around your home and then just have it automatically turn the lights on when you enter the geofence instead of having to manually initiate it every time?  I mean i guess battery life could be a concern but I am trying to think of a more automated way of handling it that doesn't require user interaction at all."

AppleWatch,3dj3xt,n9b6,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:37:42 2015 UTC,You will probably notice the micro scratches easier but you can just polish them out. You can have a jeweler rebrush it for you.

Mechanical watches have been an obsession for me as long as I can remember, and I had dreamed about owning a skeletonized Royal Oak since I was probably 14. I’ve collected many watches, from novelty to high-end Swiss ones, and the thought of having a modern-day watch that worked seamlessly with my iPhone had me ready to completely just go bonkers.

You, my friends, need to meet me after the break to find out."
AppleWatch,3dffnd,Shitragecomics,2,Wed Jul 15 21:12:02 2015 UTC,"Great review. It's nice to hear a perspective from someone who uses the Edition on a daily basis. Don't see too many of those.  I, for one, really love what Apple did with the different versions. You can get the Edition, which is very much supposed to be a luxury item and piece of jewelry, or you can get the standard version, which will be great for most people, or you can get the (relatively) affordable Sport. Yet, at the end of the day, they're all the same. You can get that same luxury feel and only spend $350 for almost the same product. I really hope Apple continues this model, because I think it's a great way for them to put a Watch on the wrist of almost anyone who wants one."

It's incredibly one-sided with hardly any criticism, and it's not like BGR is a paragon of integrity.   It is nice to see someone appreciate the watch as a watch though. Not sure why so many traditional watch enthusiasts have written it off so quickly."
AppleWatch,3dhijn,iPhone-Jailbreak,6,Thu Jul 16 09:05:07 2015 UTC,DO NOT DO THIS
AppleWatch,3dhijn,ragingtonberry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:12 2015 UTC,To make it look shiny like the black stainless steel model you mean?
AppleWatch,3dhijn,petrainr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:10:02 2015 UTC,Yea
AppleWatch,3dhijn,petrainr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:44:31 2015 UTC,"Probably not a good idea. I have seen people use polish on the stainless steel model, but the watch has some coatings on it that help protect it. Any attempt at polishing it would remove that and your watch wouldn't stand much of chance against the elements. You could try getting a shiny black case for it. (Not ideal, I know) Or cringes shiny clear nail polish? But I have no idea what that would actually look like."
AppleWatch,3dhijn,rofloma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:47:10 2015 UTC,"I had the same idea, but then talked to a guy that does anything concerning surfaces for a living.  He told me, that the aluminum is anodized, which is used to make the material more durable (less prone to scratching, dings, discoloring, oxidizing).  If you polish it, the watch will look strange really soon.  Selling it some day might be quite hard then as well.  So if you really don't like the ""matte"" look, bite the bullet and get the stainless steel one. It will look better than anything you can do to polish + you get the sapphire glass screen."
AppleWatch,3dhijn,calvarez,0,Fri Jul 17 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"This applies to the silver model, not black.  You didn't say which one you had...  A Dremel, polishing wheel, and polishing compound will do it.  I know you can polish the stainless model and won't hurt the sapphire, however I have no idea whether the Ion-x glass can be damaged by polishing compound.  If you're really careful it shouldn't matter.  The ceramic back will be fine.  NOTE:  The aluminum is anodized to give it a protective finish (clear coat).  If you polish it, this will be removed.  Then if you get certain chemicals on it, like salt water, it will discolor."
AppleWatch,3dhijn,Shitragecomics,2,Thu Jul 16 18:19:23 2015 UTC,"This applies to the silver model, not black.  You didn't say which one you had...   He did, he said SGS which is Space Grey Sport."
AppleWatch,3dhijn,calvarez,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"Jesus how did I totally miss that.  Anyway, no, you cannot polish it.  Any polishing would remove the microscopic black coating.  You'd turn it into plain silver aluminum (shiny).  To make it glossy you'd need a coating."

AppleWatch,3dgftp,inz_,3,Thu Jul 16 22:56:45 2015 UTC,I think it depends how damaged it is. If it's somehow in a million pieces then no. But with a shattered screen it will cost you 329 dollars. They have to send it out for repairs and I'm not sure if they send you back the same one or actually repair that and send the same one back to you.

AppleWatch,3dgftp,naokuvi,7,Thu Jul 16 04:58:47 2015 UTC,"I hope they can find it! As a fellow 20 year old who saved up money like crazy for my SS classic buckle I would be devastated. If you find it you can try going to the apple store and explain your story being honest and just being upfront about how you saved up a lot of money from work with the watch. If the screen is just cracked u can get the screen repaired rather than get the whole unit replaced. If you had this watch for 1 month I believe youre still eligible for apple care (i think no guaruntees). You can try buying Apple Care for the watch for the watch online or over the phone and then go to the store and get it replaced for $80 and the price of apple care vs. replacing the screen/the whole unit.   I heard about the modern buckle band being easy to take off due to the buckle relying on a magnetic mechanism. I think for any Apple Watch user, the safe bet if you want to take it to theme parks is to use the sports band. Debating whether to take my watch on my summer Six Flags trip...hopefully my sports band can survive Mr. Freeze...though after hearing your story i'll probably opt to leave my watch out of this and use a mechanical one lol."
AppleWatch,3dgftp,jchandonait,4,Thu Jul 16 02:45:35 2015 UTC,I do have a sports band but the amusement park was a spur-of-the-moment celebratory thing so I didn't have time to go home and switch out the bands :l
AppleWatch,3dgftp,ryanmercer,5,Thu Jul 16 02:48:08 2015 UTC,Do you think if you'd been wearing the sports band it would have fallen off?  I'm heading to Six Flags this weekend and am now anxious to bring my watch. (38 MM with the sports band)
AppleWatch,3dgftp,HeathenCyclist,5,Thu Jul 16 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP but i think the sports band would have helped. The modern buckle relies on a magnetic mechanism to clasp together the buckle itself this way you dont have excess band running off the sides for a more seamless design. The sports band relies on the classic watch band system of clicking in the notch and tucking excess bands under something. With this I think the sports band will stay better put with all the bumpiness of the roller coaster. I think I'm just going to leave my watch at home for six flags day though. While I would trust my sports band with milder rides and theme parks like Disney, Six flags is pretty high thrill. Plus being anal i would prob end up taking it off for any water rides as well."
AppleWatch,3dgftp,Rockinwaggy,4,Thu Jul 16 03:07:43 2015 UTC,I would have had full confidence in my sports band to do the job.  I've learned my lesson.  Modern buckle is more of a casual design AND purpose. Sports band would have been perfect.
AppleWatch,3dgftp,SomeRandomProducer,3,Thu Jul 16 03:25:51 2015 UTC,"I recently went to Hershey Park with my Apple Watch Sport. We went on all of the roller coasters including Fahrenheit and everything was fine. Finally we went to the final boss, Storm Runner. My watch was absolutely fine, but when I got off and looked in my bag, no phone. I accidentally took it on the ride and it fell out of my pocket. Moral of the story is that your watch will be fine but don't neglect thought about the location of your phone."

I was furiously hand-sawing and hatcheting a tree that came down in a storm Monday morning for about 2 hours monday and my watch didn't budge with the sports band. If it can take that, I don't see a roller coaster taking it out."
AppleWatch,3dgftp,Shitragecomics,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:24:38 2015 UTC,"The modern buckle relies on a magnetic mechanism to clasp together the buckle itself    No, it doesn't. The magnets merely guide the clasp into place to make it easier to close. It's held in place quite securely until you squeeze the buttons on both sides of the clasp - then it pops open.   The ML and link bands are designed to prevent the watch falling off if the clasp opens. A solid investment, IMO."
AppleWatch,3dgftp,naokuvi,3,Thu Jul 16 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"Doubt it. The sports band is pretty locked down, and designed to be so. I imagine it's pretty difficult to unlatch without trying."

Unluckily my boyfriend lost his keys on the Banshee the same day...losing stuff at theme parks sucks especially when it prevents you from driving home when you live 3 hours away. I hope they find your watch though! If it is the stainless steel it might be found easier because it'll shine when they point any flashlight at it, the worker explained that almost all keys are found because of that."
AppleWatch,3dgftp,ryanmercer,5,Thu Jul 16 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"The Apple Care + is available for 60 days after purchase, but it requires either you take it into a retail store for inspection or a remote program that runs some diagnostics of you buy the AC+ over the phone.  At least, that's what Apple's website says. For me, I bought it about 4 days after buying the watch and over the phone they just asked whether or not it was already damaged, no diagnostic program.  I think they just don't want people buying AC+ on broken devices.  BTW, replacing the screen without + is $270 I believe."
AppleWatch,3dgftp,iPhone-Jailbreak,2,Thu Jul 16 03:57:15 2015 UTC,Yup I bought AC+ on my phone and they just asked me if there were cracks on the phone. I don't think they ran a diagnostic program for me either but I don't think they can detect cosmetic damages using this program. If OP finds his watch and the internal hardware still work find and all it is is cosmetic damages (I heard these watches can take a beating) then maybe he can try buying apple care over the phone and getting it replaced in the store.

AppleWatch,3de97t,Suicide_Run,4,Wed Jul 15 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"What is not considered:  The Navy's testing of rubber was with strips of rubber submerged in seawater.  The Apple Watch has gaps in it where saltwater can get trapped.  This creates the ""impracticably long time periods"" spoken of by the Navy in their testing.  It allows the rubber components to remain in residual contact with salt water, which breaks them down through a reciprocation of friction and seepage.  The Apple Watch is not made from magical components that are somehow different from those in sports watches that use the same rubber seals which also break down and fail after repeated contact with salt water."

AppleWatch,3de97t,Alexio247,2,Wed Jul 15 22:08:12 2015 UTC,"I lived in Hawaii where stuff that doesn't even touch the water starts corroding after enough time.   Any equipment you take in the water has to be rinsed off or soaked in fresh water to prevent corrosion. Given that you do that, there really aren't any issues.  As is recommended in the article, as it was a consideration, you need to rinse/soak the watch in fresh water after you finish swimming.   Obviously if you don't take care to remove any leftover salt water, you very well might see corrosion.   Edit: Also, your understanding of the testing done by the navy seems to be inaccurate. I just looked at the actual paper and the testing and conclusions do not match your intepretation above.   Are you saying that you think liquid seawater will get trapped for hundreds of hours on the watch? Because I don't see how or why that would be the case at all."
AppleWatch,3de97t,faustkenny,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:49:44 2015 UTC,I posted this on another thread  (Yet another Ripley's believe it or not; WaterProof.)  After using your watch in salt water you should soak it in distilled water for about 5 minutes. Move the watch around in the soaking container to make sure that the distilled water will reached every little nook and cranny so it can dissolve any salt that might be lingering there - of coarse the key here is using distilled water.  https://youtu.be/DxlMpu2uccI?t=2m30s  with this treatment perhaps the watch will last longer after being exposed to saltwater

That's simply not true. 1m of water resistance REALLY means that the watch can withstand the pressure of 1m of water. When you introduce factors like movement through water (swimming) you find that the amount of pressure on the watch is much greater. This is why it is not recommended for watches with 10 or even 30m of water resistance to be worn while swimming. Watches should definitely not be worn while showering, as hot steam and pressurized water can destroy the watertight seals. This author's watch may be fine right now, but it's only a matter of time before his watch breaks prematurely."

AppleWatch,3dg3mz,naokuvi,0,Thu Jul 16 13:14:12 2015 UTC,Everyone has their own opinion on the clashing metals but in my opinion the Milanese Loop clashes way too much with the SGS. It's more obvious when your whole band is made out of a silvery stainless steel and your watch itself is dark grey aluminum. I don't think the classic buckle looks pretty bad though. Since the only SS element is the clasp and the connectors it doesnt stand out that much and the black leather will definitely go well with the grey. There are also third party black SS link bands I saw on amazon. I never ordered any since I got the SS watch but when I was originally going to get the SGS i was seriously considering them.

AppleWatch,3decz5,Thizzlebot,4,Wed Jul 15 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"Same here. I use my phone much less but the battery drains about 1/3 quicker. Which is weird because I had a fitbit before so bluetooth was still always on. Its not my phone battery because it started the day I got my watch, and forgot it one day and battery was back to normal."
AppleWatch,3decz5,hawaiizach,2,Wed Jul 15 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"By the way, have you tried going into your iPhone’s app switcher and sliding up any apps that are on your phone (including the Apple Watch app)? I know it helps me if I kill those apps: the rogue one is eliminated and battery consumption goes back to normal. Never been able to track down the culprit though, and the problem starts again. I suspect occasionally there’s a bug in the communication and something keeps repeating obsessively in the background.  Also, I have “Resume Previous Activity” enabled so that every app can act as a watchface. For a while I thought this might have been using a lot more battery, but I don’t think so any more."
AppleWatch,3decz5,jnd-au,7,Thu Jul 16 13:16:08 2015 UTC,My iPhone lasts longer because I'm using the screen less due to the watch.
AppleWatch,3decz5,MawsonAntarctica,4,Wed Jul 15 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"The bluetooth technology used by the watch / phone will have nearly no direct impact on battery life for being on.   Have you tried doing a full power down, and back up of both devices together? My watch was getting pretty terrible battery life, but after doing this it resolved my problems, and I've read the same about people having issues with phone battery.   On the iPhone go to Settings -> General -> Usage -> Battery Usage and see if Usage and Standby are the same as they are in the tweet below.  If your iPhone is experiencing this issue, you will also likely see the Apple Watch App listed as the highest battery usage on your iPhone.   The above suggests the phone is having issues going into stand by mode, but the resolution for this is a restart of both devices, if not contact Apple about it.  I've noticed no different in battery drain at all since I've received my Apple Watch."
AppleWatch,3decz5,sidious911,2,Wed Jul 15 18:28:45 2015 UTC,"I hear most people, at the end of the day, have ~30% battery left on the watch and a nearly drained iPhone. Hopefully watchOS 2, with native watch apps, will take some strain off the phone and balance those numbers a bit."

Compared to purchasing tickets and feeding them in and out of the turnstiles using the watch to tap in and out like you would with an oyster card was fucking joyous.

AppleWatch,3ddmly,bristoltwit,5,Wed Jul 15 15:18:00 2015 UTC,It does. I weigh 140lbs and a four mile run has me burning around 350 calories. I have friends that weigh more than I do and they burn over a thousand calories just walking throughout the day.
AppleWatch,3ddmly,falconkorea9,2,Wed Jul 15 13:48:26 2015 UTC,"I probably have a quicker pace than most ...   This is the key.  It says directly on Apple's website for Apple Watch:   Any activity performed at the level of a brisk walk or above is considered exercise.   A leisurely stroll will not count as exercise, even if you walk for 2 hours.  You'll still burn calories, but it will not fill the exercise ring because it's not a ""brisk walk.""  Your weight or BMI has nothing to do with the middle exercise ring.  Only the speed of your walk matters."
AppleWatch,3ddmly,otterstew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:42 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely the correct answer to the green ring.  Moving on the the red ring in case anyone is curious...  The outer (red) ring on the other hand is impacted by your weight and what kind of shape you're in.  I was out of shape when I got the Apple Watch.  I've been working out every day since then.    Hikes that I go on end up burning fewer and fewer calories.  My resting calories go down as well.  Even doing 30 minutes on a treadmill at the same exact speed is resulting in fewer calories.  That move goal is constantly ""moving"".  Meaning hitting 600 active calories used to be fairly easy, but now it's taking much longer to hit that goal.  The same effect can be seen in the discrepancy between burned calories shown on an exercise machine's digital display versus your Apple Watch.  You mind find that the machine under counts your calories burned when you're out of shape, and over counts your calories burned when you're in shape.    Your Apple Watch will be more accurate."

My definition of a brisk walk during an outdoor walk will get me about half the time (a 20 minute outdoor walk will give me about 10 minutes of ""Activity""). I have to walk at around maximum walking speed for it to count. Heart rate needs to get up into the 130s or so."

AppleWatch,3dg059,D1sneyRicky,0,Thu Jul 16 01:39:34 2015 UTC,I think it is on purpose. So you have to think about it for a second and don't just blindly hit ok. That notification is meant for you to stand and more be around.

I agree with what your saying kitten. Truthfully I've got hundreds of different straps some going up to $450 but the $120 price is definitely cheap. Taking into consideration the work that goes into the strap. They even acknowledge that since each strap is made by hand their might be some slight deviation from what is displayed on the image on their site. To add to his point though yeah there's other straps for $25 but there's just no style or sense of value to me. Other than the fact that they probably come out of a sweatshop in China"
AppleWatch,3dcoca,kraiz,0,Wed Jul 15 21:22:38 2015 UTC,"Or more accurately, for $25 you get $25 worth of leather.  For $150 you get $40 worth of leather.

The majority of people buying an Apple Watch Edition probably do it by telling their assistant ""Get me the new Apple Watch"" and it's done.

AppleWatch,3dc5el,cdelphiki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:30:57 2015 UTC,"Do you go to the workout app before you exercise or do you jump straight into your workout without touching the watch?  I workout daily and never get close to filling all the circles.  For example, I rowed on the erg for 5000 meters (20 minutes), and the watch says I put in 3 minutes of exercise.  I'll do yoga for an hour and the watch will only count a few minutes.  I feel like the watch should be able to detect when my heart rate jumps up rather than me turning on the workout app."

I've also been walking 15+ miles per day lately.  Yesterday it logged 263 minutes of exercise.  Only about 30 minutes of that was with the exercise app when I went for a run."
AppleWatch,3dc5el,az116,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:17:56 2015 UTC,"My daily 30 minutes of exercise consists of fast walking 2.5 miles in the morning before work.  Before I start, I launch the workout app and start an outdoor walk exercise.  It keeps the last caloric goal so I usually either keep it at that goal or increase it a bit.  If I don't walk fast enough, sometimes I only get 28 or 29 minutes out of 30 which sucks but 9 times out of 10 when that happens, it really wasn't that brisk of a walk if I'm being honest with myself.  So to answer your question, yes, I launch the workout app every single day to get my 30+ minutes.  Any my move goal is set at 610 calories currently."

AppleWatch,3dafdj,drh0usemd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:30:46 2015 UTC,As a side note in the U.K. you should go through the company you purchased the phone from. Can get into a bickering match with many companies about iPhones (usually when outside of warranty) but at the same time they will always want you to send the phone off. One thing I like about Apple Stores if you are close to one is that you can go in and get it sorted. There is other options than having to send the phone in and waiting weeks for it to be returned m

I work at Best Buy and anytime anyone has a problem I will tell them to just take it to Apple and they will get them taken care of.. Yet I still hear so many stories and people complaining saying they had one bad experience 4 years ago and apple sucks bc they have shit customer service and all of their products are over priced and break really easy.

AppleWatch,3dacwf,geeeeh,8,Tue Jul 14 22:16:09 2015 UTC,"Because they're not marketing it as a smartwatch, and they don't want the gadgety cachet that goes with an iDevice. They want it to appeal across all social circles as something that can legitimately replace a watch as a fashion accessory."
AppleWatch,3dacwf,ShezaEU,2,Wed Jul 15 04:07:24 2015 UTC,"Reading the article, it makes a bit of sense really. That's not what the product is called, but it's the term that Apple pays Google in AdWords to catch people who are incorrectly typing the name.  So Apple are, in a way, pretending their product is actually called an iWatch, so as to catch people when they search on Google for it. This company is out to get money, I think that much is obvious, but if they actually had a good product called iWatch, then you can imagine how upset they would be if Apple buried them under Google AdWords."

AppleWatch,3dbsn8,wutitswes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:37:05 2015 UTC,Disabling airplane mode on one device will not disable airplane mode on the other because in airplane mode the devices do not have any way of communicating to the other device.  THis is because bluetooth and wifi are disabled by default in airplane mode.
AppleWatch,3d9arf,JBlake9009,2,Tue Jul 14 14:39:00 2015 UTC,I got this in brown (same branding and everything). It looked great but it wore out SO quickly.  Took less than 2 weeks of light use for the leather around the adaptors to rip on all sides. It actually looks worse in person than in the picture.  I'm still using the adaptors with a regular fossil band though. http://i.imgur.com/BDEg6Cl.jpg
AppleWatch,3d9arf,Franks_and_Beens,2,Tue Jul 14 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"you get what you pay for I guess, right? At least you didn't spend 50 dollars on something that's not even worth a few bucks. I've seen and been tempted to buy all these leather loop clones for 50 bucks but Now I'm only gonna stick with Apple branded or ""Made for Apple Watch"" 3rd party bands, which aren't out yet but follow these strict guidelines.   https://developer.apple.com/watch/bands/Band-Design-Guidelines-for-Apple-Watch.pdf"
AppleWatch,3d9arf,Deedubau,2,Tue Jul 14 18:36:20 2015 UTC,Have any companies released any information/intent to start producing bands following these guidelines? Like Griffin or other large iAccessory companies?
AppleWatch,3d9arf,7470,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"not that I'm aware of. I'm worried that people would rather buy these cheap breakable apple bands they are posting all over this thread for their 350+ dollar apple watches rather than spending a little more to buy quality ones Apple branded, or not. If it's anything like Made for iPod/iphone then 10 percent of the profits are required to go to apple for meeting the guidelines."
AppleWatch,3d9arf,Deedubau,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:44:40 2015 UTC,"I'm looking to pick up a cheap band for the time being but as soon as some high quality third party bands hit the market I'll be picking some up. As beautiful as Apple's bands are, some a a bit expensive."
AppleWatch,3d9arf,7470,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:50:16 2015 UTC,"I""m sure there are high quality bands on the market from established watch band makers, but those will definitely cost 50 plus dollars.

AppleWatch,3d9arf,Deedubau,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:55:17 2015 UTC,"And I agree, they are the only ones I've seen that are of decent quality and actually look good on the watch. But I can see Griffin and other iAccessory makers releasing some pretty good bands for around $30-$40."
AppleWatch,3d9arf,7470,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:55:50 2015 UTC,"I totally agree this band wasn't quality but I wouldn't expect it to be. Without the adaptors this ""genuine leather"" (feels more like vinyl) wouldn't be worth $5. But I also don't buy that Apple is the only one that can make decent leather. I would take a good adaptor and a solid $50 regular watch band over any day.   Cant wait for the certified 3rd party bands to start coming out with some new options. Right now it feels like overpriced 1st party bands and cheap Chinese knockoffs with not much in between."

AppleWatch,3dadrg,KittenSwagger,2,Tue Jul 14 20:32:15 2015 UTC,I was eyeing that JETech band. I have a few cases and such from them and they have some decent quality to them. Thank you!

AppleWatch,3dadrg,KittenSwagger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:55:57 2015 UTC,My wrists are in between so hopefully it doesn't pose a problem. They shipped quickly right? I noticed some bands take a few weeks and one band said 1-4 months.

AppleWatch,3d9vty,chygga,4,Tue Jul 14 17:55:09 2015 UTC,"Same problem here!  RunKeeper disagree with my apple watch by as much as 10%.... what's interesting is that it's not consistently one more than the other... Sometimes I'll look down and Apple Watch will say I've run 1 mile, and RunKeeper will say I've run 1.08 miles. ...... I'll look down a few minutes later and RunKeeper will say I've run 2 miles, and Apple Watch will say 2.11 or something.  Very strange, since they're sharing the same GPS."
AppleWatch,3d9vty,brianshell,2,Tue Jul 14 18:35:07 2015 UTC,I know that one of the common troubleshooting steps is to verify that the 'motion calibration and distance' system location service is enabled while doing your calibration runs. do you have that on?
AppleWatch,3d9vty,maulla,0,Wed Jul 15 01:24:51 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to figure this out as well, and I'll share what I've found. It appears that, even when carrying a phone with you, the app doesn't constantly use gps for tracking distance. Instead all it does is check in with the gps to confirm the distance it's calculating using the accelerometer in the watch. What this means is that as long as you're running in a straight line, or a route with very little switchbacks and right turns it should be pretty accurate. Once you start turning often the accuracy goes way down. Only thing I can think of that might help would be to do a few nice long straight runs with your phone to try and calibrate the accelerometer as much as possible, then the watch will hopefully be pretty accurate  no matter the route since it will be using your arm motion for distance. Haven't tried this yet, but in theory it should work."
AppleWatch,3d9vty,seannymurrs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:46:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that kind of makes sense.  I recently tried resetting the watch to restart calibration from scratch, and at that point, I still had the GPS issues, so it logged a few entirely unrealistic 4:30 miles.  I think that calibration data might still be having an effect.  I'll see if it improves over time."

AppleWatch,3d9fnz,6spdvtec,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"Personally, if you know what you are talking about an looking for it shouldn't be an issue. Ask the buyer to meet up, and check the thing out thoroughly. Also ask him for the serial number, you can look it up online. If it's stolen you will be able the see that. Most of the time when you go into an Apple Store now a days you don't even need a big ass ""receipt"" the serial number acts as one.   He may not have a receipt because it was emailed and lost, so just check the thing out. It's worth the savings if it's lightly used. I wouldn't be too worried just make sure you check it out."

AppleWatch,3dcg1u,ShezaEU,2,Wed Jul 15 10:24:56 2015 UTC,Pretty much what others say. You can see who is calling before you pull out your phone. First thing I used it for was to look at an email while my phone was on the charger while at work. Then it came in handy to silence phone calls I got while talking to my boss. You get hey Siri all day vs just when your phone is charging. my phone fell down my car seat last night I used the chime button to find it. Hmm WHat else? Its just a neat little thing and if you have the money and your bills are paid to hell WHat every one else thinks lol. Oh and it does make u more conscious of your cardio.
AppleWatch,3dcg1u,williagh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:09:01 2015 UTC,"The people that get the most use out of the watch will be those that have busy lives and are often out of the house. If I stay at home all day, I have my computer, iPhone and iPad at my fingertips for anything I need.   But if I'm out an about, I can control music on my phone without getting it out of my pocket, answer calls (with Caller ID!), make calls, receive and reply to texts etc... it's very handy if you are out and about.  Now if you are a busy person on top of that, then you can have constant reminders, easy location services, requesting an Uber in seconds, a view of your calendar events, etc throughout the day.  I'm not a busy person and right now I'm on a long holiday so I don't go out much either. I just like technology, and still haven't decided if I'll keep my watch.

The notifications have put me back in control of my email and being able to get walking directions on my wrist is brilliant but it's the motivation to be more active that's the key for me.  It's not an essential but it is very nice to have and I would hate to be without mine now. I wear it all day, every day (great to be able to change the look with a change of band)."

Before that I had the regular watches and wore those everyday.  The watch is also mainly a notification device or an extension of your cell phone. That transition is especially hard for people as they compare it to watch and then they rationalize whether the product is worth the price or not.

AppleWatch,3d7z79,snowmonkey_ltc,2,Tue Jul 14 10:18:54 2015 UTC,How do you view your recent transaction if you are using Pay exclusively on an Watch?  Because I have an iPhone 5s I don't have any cards in passbook/wallet so I can't see them there.   There is nothing under the wallet setting within the Watch app on the iPhone that shows recent transactions.   The passbook app on the Watch doesn't show any transaction history.   I have just used my watch to tap in and out of the London tube. It worked amazingly but I have no fucking idea how much it cost me.

AppleWatch,3d7z79,JMH71,3,Tue Jul 14 09:51:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, because the 5S doesn't allow you to use your phone to pay, only your watch so you add your card in the Apple Watch app on the phone.  If you have a 6 though you can use your phone or your watch to pay and the card needs adding to each separately (i.e. in two different phone apps)."
AppleWatch,3d7z79,nocto7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:56:45 2015 UTC,Yeah. You are absolutely right. Just figured that out.
AppleWatch,3d7z79,toridoki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:00:54 2015 UTC,"Got mine all set up (Natwest & Santander - no bloody Barclays though, harrumph).  So, apparently, you can use Apple Pay on your watch without having the phone nearby.  Can someone explain to me how this works, i.e., how does it know you have the money on that card without any kind of data/wi-fi signal?"
AppleWatch,3d7z79,xiikar,2,Tue Jul 14 09:05:49 2015 UTC,"The money isn't on the card, it's in your account. Your debit/credit cards don't have data/wifi either :)"
AppleWatch,3d7z79,gee1973,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:23:59 2015 UTC,I knew it was a silly question!
AppleWatch,3d7z79,TVPaulD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:34:19 2015 UTC,"No expert but I imagine it would be similar to purchasing something on a plane with no signal.  It'll ask for the payment, it'll allow it through, but if you've no money, you'll be in trouble with the bank and probably the merchant."
AppleWatch,3d7z79,danielaberdeen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:14:52 2015 UTC,"The check for available cash will be on the merchant side of things won't it? Your watch no more needs a wifi connection than your card does.   In addition, they won't take certain types of cards on planes - like pre-paid debit cards - because there is no way to get the money if the card actually turns out to be empty. I'd guess you can't add those sorts of cards to Apple Pay either."

AppleWatch,3da3zw,heatup631,2,Tue Jul 14 19:44:05 2015 UTC,The shorter cord one is $29. The longer cord one that comes with the watch is 2M and is $39. $35 is $5 off.
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,5t3alth,2,Tue Jul 14 17:20:08 2015 UTC,It's disappointing that it's not an on the spot repair/replace like it is with other devices.  I had no idea.  Thanks for the post.

AppleWatch,3d9xa9,Deedubau,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:17:26 2015 UTC,How did you drop your watch? I upgraded to SS (with applecare) because I'm always bumping into things and I do drop my phone on occasion but I'm really hoping I won't drop my watch since I don't exactly hold it above the ground often.
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,Deedubau,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not one to drop my devices, but when I shower I hang my watch on the end of a towel rack so I can still access audio/podcast controls. I went to take it off the rack after I got dressed and just fumbled it. It fell face down onto the tile. I don't anticipate another drop any time soon, but I feel reassured having Apple Care."
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,pointblank87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:18:23 2015 UTC,But now you only have 1 more accidental replacement left for the next 2 years :(
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,Berzerker7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:26:19 2015 UTC,Yep.  So I hope I don't ruin it two more times in that timeframe.  Shouldn't be a problem.
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,pointblank87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:38:25 2015 UTC,Wait so you paid for AppleCare... but still had to pay an extra $79 to get a new watch?
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,backfire103,2,Tue Jul 14 18:24:59 2015 UTC,"That's how AppleCare works.  If you don't have it, screen replacements are $329 and only hardware/software defects are covered under the standard warranty.  With AppleCare, you pay $69 for the protection and get 2 claims for any reason, at all, no questions asked, for $79 each.  iPhone ApplCare is the same. $99 for the plan, $99 per claim, 2 max, over 2 years."
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,pointblank87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:39:26 2015 UTC,Ah... I see. But the iPhone one sounds like a rip off. You're essentially paying them $99 for the ability to pay them another $99 if something goes wrong. If I remember correctly... a cracked screen was only like $100-$200. So what's the point?
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,calvarez,2,Tue Jul 14 19:25:21 2015 UTC,Apple Care is way worth it. First they will do express replacement for free so you don't have to set foot in a Apple Store (which is a huge positive for me) and they also tend to be waaaaaay more leinent on what is considered damage and what is considered a defect.
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,pointblank87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:25:58 2015 UTC,Good to hear you've had a positive experience with Apple Care.
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,calvarez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:40:33 2015 UTC,I fell into a spa with the phone in my pocket.  Replacement for a water-damaged phone is 100% of the phone cost ($750 for the model I had).  Instead it was $100 for the claim and $100 for the Applecare itself.
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,pointblank87,2,Tue Jul 14 19:39:26 2015 UTC,Oh snap! Definitely worth it for water damage then. But if you just crack your screen it's pretty much pointless to have bought.
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,calvarez,2,Tue Jul 14 20:08:22 2015 UTC,"I've never broken a screen, so I don't know, but I had been told that they are over $200.  I have no idea if that's accurate though.  On a side note, I recently learned that my homeowner's insurance has zero deductible for most small electronics.  Free iPad after submerging my Jeep in a river with the iPad inside of it.  I know, me and water and electronics..."

AppleWatch,3d9xa9,KittenSwagger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:43:52 2015 UTC,Not really a rip off when you keep in mind that an iPhone is not $200 like many people think. But costs ~$800.
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,pointblank87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:38:16 2015 UTC,Last time I saw someone get a screen replacement it was about $100. Maybe they changed it though... I dunno.
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,cmbf4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:00:36 2015 UTC,I have replaced my 5s's screen myself; cost about $90 and was deffinetly not the quality screen that came with the phone. A local phone repair shop in my city wanted $175. Verizon's insurance that i paid for required me to pay a $180 deductible and they overnight shipped me a new phone. That was the best deal for me...that and it came with a new lighting cable and wall charger so...bonus.
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,pointblank87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:20:19 2015 UTC,lol ya I wouldn't trust a third party screen. That's awesome you got some extra stuff!
AppleWatch,3d9xa9,pointblank87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:40:06 2015 UTC,"but if you have liquid damage, it will cost you more than 79$ (with Applecare+ to replace a whole phone). just a thought here.  AppleCare+ saves people's asses. jus saying."

I work in an office and exercise in a gym. I take it off when going to do something outside (eg. mowing lawn) and when I go play tennis.  Not happy with the strap though, every day use seems to be killing the plastic strap and it seems to be wearing off a little as some parts feel smoother and others have a lot more grip to them (probably a little wear)"
AppleWatch,3d8cf8,xiikar,3,Tue Jul 14 09:39:29 2015 UTC,"There's really no way to truly fix this short of replacing the device. In either of the dark-colored Apple Watch flavors, you're dealing with colors applied to only a thin surface layer. Once you scratch it, it's gone.  I guess you could apply a touch up of some sort, but I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up looking worse since touch up painting is never perfect."

I read somewhere that it was due to replacing the Taptic engine prior to the launch.  Some people use a .3mm sharpie, but that will eventually rub off.  If it is brand new, I suggest bringing it back and getting a replacement.  I actually wrote an email to Tim Cook regarding this problem, and got a call from a member of his team. They told me that the right people got the feedback (whatever that's worth).  TL:DR - It is common with some SGS, if it is new return it."

AppleWatch,3d6z0u,AzureMagelet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:20:22 2015 UTC,My husband works at an apple sore and wore a demo with that band and he's obsessed. He says its so amazingly comfortable.

AppleWatch,3d6g9m,Richard_bender,4,Mon Jul 13 22:12:31 2015 UTC,"Out of all the leather bands I researched, I liked this one the best but the price point threw me off... I don't know about $130. Also I ordered some sikai adapters and they fit horrible... The ones you have don't seem to fit just THAT great but at least you could get the posts screwed back in. That's more than I could say.   Quality rating on the leather? Do you feel you should have paid more or less for this?"
AppleWatch,3d6g9m,Richard_bender,4,Mon Jul 13 23:03:00 2015 UTC,"The one thing that I noticed was how thin and pliable the leather felt.  It's not a bad thing, as I didn't like how thick and stiff some of the other leather straps I've seen appeared.  It also did not add much weight (feels about as light as the sport band).  I like the fine grain on the leather.  The stitching seems to be tight.  The buckle felt like plastic, but that's probably more of the coating (I've read that the hardware is aluminum).  Speaking of hardware, the connecting hardware is more of a black than a space grey, so the color will not match perfectly, but it's a lot better than trying to match a strap made for the regular AWS.  This strap is pricey, but I feel that this strap was worth it."

AppleWatch,3d7ln9,chiefarab,2,Tue Jul 14 04:38:34 2015 UTC,"Nope! If you leave your phone at home and go somewhere that has a known wifi network that you have connected to previously, the watch will automatically connect."
AppleWatch,3d7ln9,Berzerker7,5,Tue Jul 14 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"Kind of, your phone still needs to be on and accessible over the Internet. If you turn your phone off, even if the watch is connected to WiFi, it won't be able to make calls over cellular, just facetime audio and iMessage."

AppleWatch,3d7ln9,Krypto_74,2,Tue Jul 14 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"I think people are talking about college campuses, where the same wifi band (or several bands) are literally on every square inch of campus. As long as your phone and watch are on the same wifi I'm guessing you can make calls. This wouldn't be the case if you left you phone at your house and then went to a coffee shop with totally different wifi access. But, it sounds like OS2 adds iMessage and FaceTime audio calls on any wifi, basically freeing you from actually needing your phone (other than the initial set up at that location of course."
AppleWatch,3d7ln9,Zurevu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:43:54 2015 UTC,"Wait, so the watch has a wifi antenna even though you can't use it without OS 2?"

AppleWatch,3daws6,VaBullsFan,2,Tue Jul 14 21:20:44 2015 UTC,not bad for the price it’s much lighter feeling than the original band and it’s almost like i’m not even wearing it the connector does slide a bit but doesn’t come out so if you get one and it does that don’t be alarmed
AppleWatch,3daws6,iPUNCH,7,Tue Jul 14 21:22:30 2015 UTC,I see that it didn't come with punctuation.
AppleWatch,3d5laz,taniabrunette,26,Mon Jul 13 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"My first disappointment with this was before I even received it. While placing my pre-order I was under the impression that I would have a stainless steel option for the loops that hold the band together and that it would be sized to fit me. I was told I would be contacted later on for my size selection. I assumed it would be for the length of the band as well as the width. A month goes by and I finally get my email asking for the preference between matte silver or matte black for the band's hardware. I emailed them asking why a stainless steel option wasn't available since every model they were showcasing the bands on was a stainless steel watch. I never got an answer and settled for matte silver not knowing how it would look like on my stainless steel watch. I must say it doesn't look as bad as I originally thought it would. But I was also left with no SM/LG options for the length and after putting it on today I realize this was a big waste of 70$ as the watch band is too big for me. It's ok for wearing during the day, although the extra length from the band sticks out so much it looks bad. It doesn't hold the watch in place well enough for me to exercise with. The whole reason I have this watch is to monitor my training sessions. I would not recommend Casetify for anyone who is a petite person. I should also mention that the material used for this strap feels cheap for something that cost the same thing as the apple sports band. I should have just settled for a different sports band instead of a printed one. Lesson learned for the future.."

AppleWatch,3d5laz,7470,3,Mon Jul 13 19:44:21 2015 UTC,You need to email them with the reasons why you are not satisfied and they will determine wether you can get a refund. This must be done within 10 days of receiving your strap. All packaging and shipping costs are on the customer. I'm going to email them tonight and see what happens. I emailed them twice before receiving my strap and got no where with them so I'm assuming it will be the same for a refund.

AppleWatch,3d5laz,kr0n1k,4,Tue Jul 14 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"Hate to say but that band looks so cheap, especially for the price you paid for it :( What I don't understand is why no 3rd party makers use Apple's style of band where it gets looped into your wrist. I've never cared for the old school style watch bands and it's the main reason why I won't be buying any 3rd party bands anytime soon. For me I'll gladly pay for the closed loop sport bands or even Apple's official leather ones because I love the feel, fit and magnet enclosure on them. They do a good job of making the bands feel like it was made for you, vs you need to adjust for those crappy cheap bands."
AppleWatch,3d5laz,Deedubau,2,Mon Jul 13 21:22:30 2015 UTC,"I think they probably can't print on an apple style band because they aren't ""standard"" and don't fit in their printer. They also can't seem to print to the edge so it would look silly even if they used an apple sport style band.   My boyfriend's company all got apple watches as a bonus and several got these casetify bands and were disappointed. The common complaint was that it looked like shitty inkjet and there was visible banding in the printed area."
AppleWatch,3d5laz,kr0n1k,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:06:40 2015 UTC,I know it's a free gift and you should be thankful but I would've been disappointed too. Apple spends years to design and engineer this beautiful product and 3rd party bands like this destroy the look. The first thing I would do is go to the nearest Apple store and buy a band or 2 from it.
AppleWatch,3d5laz,rudidit09,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:49:17 2015 UTC,I live a 16 hour drive away from the nearest Apple store so I've never seen or felt any of the straps other my sport band. The reason I went for the Casetify band was that it wasn't expensive. I really want the milanese loop but I want to try it on first since I'm afraid my wrist is too small for it. Luckily I'll have the chance to visit an Apple store next month and I plan on trying out my options then. I don't think i'll be buying 3rd party bands for a long time.
AppleWatch,3d5laz,jousta,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"The milanese loop is probably my favorite looking band, I just wish it didn't loosen up a little during the day. I would imagine all the apple ones are much better made than the 3rd party clones you get for 1/3rd of the price because apple has a set of guidelines they and any official ""made for apple watch"" partner must follow so it lasts.  https://developer.apple.com/watch/bands/Band-Design-Guidelines-for-Apple-Watch.pdf"
AppleWatch,3d5laz,intulor,-1,Tue Jul 14 00:14:06 2015 UTC,"You do realize that Apple gives you a 14 day return policy when ordering online, and they don't need a specific reason why you're returning it. Just that it's still in its original condition and send all the packaging back.  I'd order from Apple and if the band isn't what you expect send it back. I personally love the Leather Loops!"
AppleWatch,3d5laz,gotnull,0,Mon Jul 13 23:54:07 2015 UTC,"Well there are only about 5 or 6 different band types, if you can't look at a picture and decide that it's something you like I don't know. Although you did order that caseify band so maybe I'm wrong. You don't need to order every band. Remember you just paid for that $70 monstrosity that you may not be able to send back.   P.S.

There is also the issue that they would need to make all the colours to give people a choice and if they don't have a big enough market for the 38mm LL its just not worth their time and money?

AppleWatch,3d4q17,gettingzen,3,Mon Jul 13 14:40:13 2015 UTC,That is the best looking nylon band I've seen.
AppleWatch,3d4q17,sneagan,2,Mon Jul 13 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"I ordered a couple different bands and I was going to wait until they all came in to post photos, but I saw someone post about the monowear nylon band and thought there might be interest in my alternative version.  $13.97 Band: http://www.amazon.com/Italian-Design-Canvas-Military-Replacement/dp/B00D6TTMHE  $14.99 Adaptor: http://www.amazon.com/LUVVITT®-Stainless-ADAPTER-Adaptor-Comparable/dp/B00V9P7ZSA/  So together you're looking at $30 versus $60 for the monowear version. Not bad!  The photos on amazon make the band look like a hunter green, but it's more of a muted dark olive, and less yellow than the monowear version. (Even my photos make it look more hunter green than it is, I took these at work under sub-optimal conditions.)    I prefer the hardware on this band to the monowear, the metal loops for the excess strap are squared off rather than rounded. The hardware looks a little more substantial looking.  This is a pretty long strap. I'm wearing it on the third hole in (i.e. third tightest setting), and while I'm female, I have a pretty average wrist. I wear the small sport strap on the 2nd or 3rd loosest setting. Someone with a tiny wrist may find that this strap is too long to fit securely.  My sport strap is more comfortable, but this is certainly wearable. It's definitely stiff, but a few minutes spent bending in back and forth loosened it up considerably. It's leather backed, so it's thicker and sturdier than you'd expect. The monowear version is just nylon. The adaptors seem pretty solid/secure right now. My boyfriend has been waiting forever for his Click adaptors to arrive, and I think he's kind of jealous.  Also, photos are of a 38mm aluminum sport, if anyone cares. I have two ebay sport strap knock-offs on the way, and a leather strap from amazon. I'll post those too if there's interest.    EDIT:  Looks like the monowear-style band is also on amazon for $18 + shipping if you prefer that style/color: http://www.amazon.com/Desert-Khaki-Piece-3-ring-Replacement/dp/B00LERBZ34/  You would need to buy the adaptor with this to make it work."

AppleWatch,3d4q17,barktreep,2,Mon Jul 13 17:36:18 2015 UTC,I just switched to that watch face to look for myself. The dots kinda blink and the anti-aliasing Apple is using creates a slight green tint. You can see the same tint on the bottom of the numbers of you look closely.
AppleWatch,3d4q17,jousta,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"The "":"" blinks. The picture is too overexposed, so the green letters look white, but the mid-blink "":"" was darkened and so it was properly exposed, and came out green.   Edit: or is the watch face actually white? Or maybe black and blue?"
AppleWatch,3d4q17,m0x,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"The watch face was set to green. The : does blink and I think it was a combo of a slow shutter (causing the green numbers to bleed into white) and the : flashing that created the effect. The photo did get overexposed because I set focus on the mostly black watch face. I adjusted the curves to get the color of the band closer to reality, and I noticed the weird 2-toned face when I was editing but didn't bother to fix it.  Didn't realize it would be more interesting than the watch band!"

I've only had it since Saturday, I expect it will loosen up and get more comfortable as it breaks in."

Now it's more like 10-20 if I'm lucky.  It is a beta though. A lot of diagnostic tools and such running. If you're thinking of upgrading, I'd suggest you wait for beta 4 at least if you can because the beta is still broken in many ways: one of them is that Siri takes a minute to activate sometimes. Not metaphorically takes a minute, no, actually a fucking minute before it starts processing speech, and you'd better hope she heard you right because the person waiting for your reply probably doesn't remember you anymore by the time shit gets sent."

AppleWatch,3d8746,1st_thing_on_my_mind,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:49:23 2015 UTC,"The reason it works great on the cardio is that your HR is steady, either up or down or constant. It doesnt generally jump all over the place. With weight lifting it does that. HR monitors during lifting have generally been concidered innacurate and the minus 1/3 rule usually comes into play. Take the total calorie burn according to the HRM and minus 1/3 for what some consider a more accurate reading.  Now as far as the watch not getting a reading at times, I have had no issue with that, whether it be during boxing, walking, biking, swimming or weight lifting. The reader always works fine. But I am also not on the beta."

AppleWatch,3d25d3,saltysloops,-6,Mon Jul 13 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"When you pay for an Apple product twice as much as you'd pay for a nearly identical product from another brand, you expect significantly higher reliability. In reality, Apple is not even #1 and the failure rate of hardware products is between 15%-20% for major brands. For example, when you pay nearly $2000 for a laptop, you expect it to last its money's worth compared to a laptop with almost identical specs for half the price. The same goes for all Apple products. But since we don't live in an ideal world, it's okay to pay twice as much for the same crap, right? Right?  I don't know which logic you're using (if you're using any) but I'd quality as ""crap"" anything that has a 1% failure rate. In essence, we're all buying crap and we hope it will last long enough; if it does, we're happy, if it doesn't we get it replaced for ""free"" and, on top of that ""free"" (mind the quotes!) Apple adds more bullshit taxes. Where do you think the term ""Apple tax"" comes from?  I really didn't expect to see anything like this submission on the Apple Watch; I had a bad opinion about Apple, but this just made it much worse. It's fucking glue, people, glue! For $400 they couldn't even be bothered to use proper glue. Are you fucking kidding me? Glue!"

I don't have enough apps to warrant that, so it's not really a concern for me right now.  Force-push is currently not used on the app selection screen (just kinda causes the UI to 'bounce' a bit). Hopefully they can use force-push for reorient for when I'm running a lot more apps and would find that operation useful."

AppleWatch,3d4kxq,Chandleabra,6,Mon Jul 13 13:57:34 2015 UTC,"Since Apple Music came out with iOS 8.4 and there hasn't been a watchOS update since then, I would wager you'll see better Apple Music integration with iOS 9 and watchOS 2."
AppleWatch,3d5szu,wannabe_ee,2,Mon Jul 13 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"make sure the box and serial on the back of the watch match up.  Make sure that you look up warranty info using the serial number on apples website.  Make sure that you can pair the watch to your phone and that everything works as described (digital crown, speakerphone, HR sensor, etc).  No way to really know if its stolen.  If they have the Box and esp the receipt I would think there a good chance it isn't.  However since the watch can be wiped since there is no activation lock which is coming out on Watch OS 2 there isn't any real security.  Source: I just bought a SS steal watch used on CL"
AppleWatch,3d5szu,MotoMD,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:32:01 2015 UTC,The seller claims he threw away the box. Does my warranty transfer when I add the device with the serial number. How much did you get it for? You can PM me if needed.
AppleWatch,3d5szu,nephyxx,4,Mon Jul 13 22:12:01 2015 UTC,With no box and no receipt it's probably stolen. The packaging is so nice that I can't imagine someone taking the watch out and tossing the rest in the garbage.
AppleWatch,3d5szu,kovalevskaya,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:19:35 2015 UTC,Agreed.  The box is hefty and pretty.  Just too nice to toss.

Pretty nerve-wracking since a lot of people on craigslist claim that they're ""gifts"" that they opened, but didn't like. Those stories just seem a little fishy to me.  The watch value is also dramatically decreasing, more than I thought it would, so that's definitely a welcomed, but worrisome surprise."
AppleWatch,3d5szu,NeonShogun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:51:07 2015 UTC,"Eh, I wouldn't worry about the value. Now that supply is becoming plentiful (with the exception of the SB), its value will be depreciating over time. Not even Apple is immune to that."

I mean they looked PERFECT together. Classic buckle also nice, but the Milanese didn't quite click for me on the SGS. Can't narrow down one reason, even though the band is really nice, but the high polish of the band and connectors kind of clashes with the matte finish of the SGS."

AppleWatch,3d44nr,burtonownz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:02:37 2015 UTC,There are various threads here and on apple support about this. The short story is that it only counts as exercise if you hit a certain pace while walking. Can you take a screenshot of the stats for your walk?
AppleWatch,3d44nr,maulla,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:40:43 2015 UTC,"You're saying that if I tell the watch to record an ""Outdoor Walk"" and clock 2 hours, the watch will decide which of that to keep based on a pace?   Edit: I'm seeing the other posts regarding it only recording activity once your heart rate hits a certain threshold. It's disappointing that the fact that I recorded a very long walk ""disappears"" though--it would be nice to be notified that x minutes of my total walk counted toward the activity ring."
AppleWatch,3d44nr,leontes,2,Mon Jul 13 11:47:41 2015 UTC,Go to your activity app on your iPhone. Click on the day in question. Scroll down to the workouts - click the arrow next to your workout - you will see the data you are looking for.

Just be nice and I'm sure they will help you out. Right now they're looking to keep people happy and isolate manufacturing issues. You may help thousands of people, but even if not you may have a better weekend.   Personally my black sports band needs to be exchanged. When I have time I will setup the replacement. I know it's something they had issues with early on and I've given them time to adjust the process for better coating. I also have a Milanese loop which looks great still. I hope yours is more isolated and not something I'll have to be dealing with in a few weeks.   Overall I'm still extremely happy with the ᴡᴀᴛᴄʜ."

I'm a USian, so I also double-hit/Apple Pay with it.  I get the design concept, but I only communicate like this with a small number of people, so it's just not as useful for me as Apple intended - but it sounds like for a lot of people, it's almost dead weight...

My least favourite issue lately is on OS2 Beta 3 (I know, it's a beta) but I use Watch Siri for timers when cooking food but she often runs to zero then doesn't tap at all, just get the Timer Done screen when I raise my wrist, not knowing how long she's been silently trying to tell me.

AppleWatch,3d1zh2,sujins,3,Mon Jul 13 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"Heart rate is an indicator of the efficiency of your circulatory system; the lower your heart rate, the more efficient your body is at moving blood around.  Ideally, you should be able to see a long term trend where your heart rate decreases while doing a set amount of exercise, but I haven't found an app that lets you compare this data easily. As an example; I'd like to see my average heart rate during a 4 mile run at ~7:30 pace, from January to Today. If I'm doing it right, my average heart rate should decline from January to July, as my body becomes more efficient at that particular exercise.  As it is right now in the Health app, it's not super useful, but it's still kind of interesting?"
AppleWatch,3d1zh2,emseearr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:12:05 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it uses your resting heart rate in the calorie calculations, too - to figure when you're actually working in comparison, for starters.  Otherwise it's kinda useless because it's so patchy."
AppleWatch,3d1zh2,HeathenCyclist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:47:17 2015 UTC,"I think it is interesting. The resting heart rate, I think, is an indication of general fitness.

AppleWatch,3d1zh2,williagh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"Right now, not much is being done with those background heart rates.  If you want to graph it, you can try cardiogr.am (disclosure: I'm one of the developers). In addition to your graph, Cardiogram will calculate your resting heart rate each day, which is an indicator of your overall cardiac health. Generally, resting heart rate is 60-100, lower is better, and exercising will tend to ""remodel"" your heart to make it pump more efficiently and lower your resting heart rate.  In theory, there are lots more applications than that to healthcare—but there's a little more scientific research that has to happen first. As of today, if you showed the average doctor your HealthKit data, they wouldn't really know where to start!"

You can see my best attempt yet here.http://imgur.com/7OTQY3Z  It gives me piece of mind that if I happen to brush up against something.  Have replaced the  protector three times in month and a half, mostly due to inaccurate original placement and the eventual accumulation of dust.

AppleWatch,3d1xcv,Tech_fan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:32:13 2015 UTC,I purchased a clear case for mine that offers a small bumper around the edges of the watch. It's a Spigen. Seems to work well. I have hit the watch against things periodically and without it the watch would be messed up.   In the past I had screen protectors on my first smart watch. Hated the feel and the look so I never bought another.
AppleWatch,3czjn0,nicholas818,15,Sun Jul 12 05:13:01 2015 UTC,4 is the best. IMO.
AppleWatch,3czjn0,BrownsFanZ,5,Sun Jul 12 05:24:53 2015 UTC,"I like that one too.  It's what I went for with the first one, but there were just too many models.

I find that sometimes when I install a new app and it hasn't synced or is stuck on the black loading screen - a nice soft reset usually resolves it for me.

I've talked about this before, but Apple wants the Watch to be as much a fashion accessory as a piece of wearable technology. Typically, high end watches are released annually or seasonally and all function the same, allowing purchasers of high-end watches to swap them out occasionally without losing functionality.  To that end, I predict that every year we'll get a redesign on every model but the Sport, a new line of Sport bands, a couple of new high end bands, and a major software update that improves performance and opens up more APIs to developers.  The Watch is a technical wonder, built with the highest level of proficiency that Apple has demonstrated to date. I suspect it was designed to not be tampered with too much for a very long time."

Regardless, first stop doing anything you suspect could be causing it, and see a doctor, not people who deal with technology.   If the doctor/testing traces the cause to be the watch (or you have a more substantive ""link""), then maybe talk to Apple - but first and foremost this is an issue about your health, so FFS, see a healthcare expert."

AppleWatch,3cy4c7,advillious,4,Sun Jul 12 04:53:00 2015 UTC,"Yup the watch learns the same wifi networks you have saved on your phone, at least in theory. In practice, I've had to forget my network at home and re-add it for my watch to learn it"
AppleWatch,3cy4c7,elie195,2,Sun Jul 12 05:05:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Someone said sometimes you have to reboot the watch to get it to sync, but you have to connect via phone first for you watch to connect."

Obviously, that alone isn't going to tip you over your data cap unless you were already close (you didn't even give us any idea how much it increased, BTW) but it might also be asking your phone to refresh calendars etc more often now, depending on all sorts of things, including your complications.   And let's not forget that it's an extra device, with extra apps to download etc. and if you back up to the cloud, it gets backed up there too. And those animated emoji are way bigger than a text message, if you've been having fun sending them.   Tl;dr it probably increases data usage to some extent (it sure can't reduce it) but we can't tell if that's your problem because you haven't given any info.

At this point anyone can get an ᴡᴀᴛᴄʜ within a reasonable amount of time. There is no reason to buy off of CR or some other website anymore unless the watch isn't available in your country. And even then....  With apple's return policies and buying experience I'd say you missed the gate. Don't confuse what normally happens (with any product) with apple somehow failing on the watch. Also keep in mind anyone claiming to have ""numbers"" is speculating. Apple has not and will not give out numbers. So this whole 90% decline thing is conjecture.   Also I'm sorry you were downvoted.

AppleWatch,3cy3ia,actkms,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:42:08 2015 UTC,I have the silver aluminium sport with a white sport band and have added a Milanese loop and black sport band. The black band is great for making the watch less obvious. The Milanese loop makes it smarter and less like a sports watch.  I was really tempted by the classic buckle too; the contrast between the matt aluminium and shiny fixings on the strap works well in my opinion. I also think the blue leather loop looks great with my watch.  Third-party options will be cheaper but the Apple straps I've tried with the silver sport watch have looked great and the quality is excellent.
AppleWatch,3cy3ia,EllNell,2,Sat Jul 11 23:39:27 2015 UTC,Would you go for the classic buckle or the Milanese? I want to also wear this option to class and Im worried milanese might be TOO fancy

AppleWatch,3cuow1,Deedubau,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:02:49 2015 UTC,Unfortunately no. The Apple Watch doesn't have its own SIM card for cellular data so theres no way it can make a call without being in proximity for your iPhone. If you workout at the gym then u can leave your iPhone in a locker and your Apple Watch should still receive notifications and u can make calls. Once Facetime Audio becomes a feature you can use wi-fi to make a call if u had already connected to that network before with a phone but without the ability to use cellular data you won't be able to make phone calls.
AppleWatch,3cuow1,nidku53,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:06:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, I agree that the SS looks the best with all the bands. I intially got the space grey aluminum one with the black band and then realized how ugly (imo) it looks with most of the other band colors. I decided to swap it out for the silver one sport white one and got 3 other bands with it now. I decided against the ss one because I heard it's heavier and I like the lightweight feel of mine, easier to shatter (i drop things a lot), And for the extra 200 dollars + 20 dollars extra for the Applecare over the sport one I figure I've spent enough money and think aluminum one already looks great with most bands. If I were to ever go to professional events though on an occasional basis then I think the ss one compliments those better."

AppleWatch,3cuow1,Red_Huevos,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:54:08 2015 UTC,"Somebody’s procrastinating. ;)  My take on the watch is that: 1) It’s a remote for your iPhone (including managing notifications). 2) It’s a fitness tracker. 3) It’s a piece of jewellery. And you need all three of those things to appeal to you to have it be worth it.  I think that makes it a more niche device than people first thought. But if you do need all of the above, it’s a very convenient and nice thing to have.  And just to chime in on the stainless vs aluminum debate, the ceramic back on the stainless is incomparably more durable than the aluminium's composite back."
AppleWatch,3cuow1,Deedubau,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"Great use summary! I think this is the perfect way to tell someone how great it is. As a student my friends are always asking me what's so great about it and what it does. Usually I don't have one specific thing to tell them about because it's so helpful across the board. It helps me with small things all day long and I think that if you're expecting anything more of t you're going to be disappointed especially if you're not very active.   I've found that the more active you are, whether that's working out or just being busy and on the go, the more helpful the watch is. It's made for the traveling business person and on the go college students at the same time. I think the way you described it as an accessory to the phone is perfect because if you sit down and try to just play with it you're not going to find much to do."
AppleWatch,3cuow1,pointblank87,2,Sat Jul 11 00:32:12 2015 UTC,Exactly! Its hard to sell it to people who ask me about it without going into detail about my everyday use. On paper it sounds like $350+ for something that does everything your iPhone does. I just try to remind them that the original iPad technically did everything the iPhone does on paper as well. The watch is a very great complement to the iPhone and it has its own niche of things that it does very well!

AppleWatch,3cu73m,avbird,7,Fri Jul 10 23:27:33 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm reading wrong. But there's only sapphire crystal display on the Stainless steel models OR IonX glass on the sport.

I was hoping there was some workaround (in either the stable or beta OS versions) since I have to decide whether or not to return the watch this week. Apple's own Health app doesn't seem to sync with Apple's own Activity app and that seems like a huge oversight in and of itself that they could quickly fix in one of the betas.  Right now it's looking like my best bet is to return the watch now and give it another shot in the Fall when the new OS updates release.... although at that point I may as well wait for Gen2.  I downloaded the public iOS 9 beta, and it doesn't fully support it. Manually added activities via the health app will show up as bars in the Activity app (they're grayed out), but they won't propagate to the move/exercise rings."

AppleWatch,3cu9p2,oo7plasma,6,Sat Jul 11 00:33:32 2015 UTC,Seriously. And I'm not even trying to be cynical. Apple is a tech fashion company and if they released computerized shoelaces people would not mock you.

AppleWatch,3cu9p2,trade605,2,Sun Jul 12 22:14:53 2015 UTC,"I think I have, but I notice what people wear on their wrists a lot more now that I have a watch. It might be that the number of people wearing smartwatches hasn't actually gone up that much, and you're just noticing it more now."

AppleWatch,3cxnxt,PressCrapToContinue,11,Sat Jul 11 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"They don't support beta software, because that software isn't fully functional. It's not ready for public release and YOU agreed to those terms when you signed up for the beta.   Public Beta releases are to help them find bugs and such. The way that works, is you personally submit feedback to the engineers who design the software, and they fix it in the next beta release. If beta releases were supported, there'd be ""millions"" of people like yourself flooding in the stores trying to get help with incomplete software that isn't fully functional. That's why it's called ""beta"".  That's just a waste of time for the company, and would cause everyone who needed help with their fully functional software to be pushed to the side and not get help in a timely manner. You could have set there with that Genius all night, troubleshooting, and you'd likely still be stuck with your problem.   Not really fair to blame Apple when you didn't  read the terms of service.   Glad they got you fixed up, though."
AppleWatch,3cxnxt,nitrojuga,4,Sat Jul 11 19:56:00 2015 UTC,Very well said. Users of mine are always asking to put beta apple software on our machines and they don't realize this.

I think I like how it doesn't taper, too.  Either way, it's nice to see these kinds of shots when you're trying to find a band. For regular watches, you can Google up just about any combination of watch and strap, but that's hard to do with the Apple watch."

AppleWatch,3cr5r5,bearsaresweet,0,Sat Jul 11 17:57:27 2015 UTC,Just trying to be helpful - it looks like there's a bit of motion blur. You may want to use a faster shutter speed to prevent that in future.
AppleWatch,3cr5r5,redditor9000,2,Fri Jul 10 10:13:47 2015 UTC,you're right! honestly the watch and phone were almost done before I decided to take the picture so I was moving quickly. but I do need to learn more about this thing
AppleWatch,3cr5r5,ASAPasPossibIe,2,Fri Jul 10 14:03:07 2015 UTC,"Haha I understand wanting to take the photo before the opportunity passes.  In future you might want to use the shutter priority mode. This lets you select a minimum shutter speed and the camera will handle the rest of the exposure.  A good rule of thumb is to select a shutter speed equal to the 35mm equivalent focal length of your camera/lens. eg if you are using a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera, aim to keep the shutter speed at or  faster than 1/35th of a second."

I'm not near either a Watch charger or bluetooth headphones to try out what happens if I sync one of these streaming-only playlists.  I guess it would be one of these 3 things: 1. The sync doesn't happen because it can't find any of the songs physically on the phone. 2. It makes the songs available offline first then syncs to the Watch 3. The least likely, but the option I would like the most, is it adds the song info to the Watch, and then streams over the Watch's wifi when you go to listen later."

Although I am not really worried about make believe internet points it does seem that the Watch subreddit isn't keen on opinion against the majority, especially where the aesthetics of the Watch are concerned.  Isn't the whole point of the Apple wearable the fact that it can be configured according to personal taste?  Why is it then that so many people are aggrieved when someone has a personal preference that may differ from their own?  I do wonder if for some ridiculous reason people are taking offence when someone expresses an opinion that differs from their own and down voting as a result.  Why you would be offended by something like that seems absurd, and (not that I personally care) somewhat in contradiction to normal reddiquette."

AppleWatch,3cttpl,Wheelscartog,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:34:45 2015 UTC,"Alright, take a look at this screenshot. His Apple Watch Sport 42mm has been on for 1 day and 11 hours, with a usage time of 3 hours and 36 minutes. At the moment of taking the screenshot, his battery was at 18%. So that means that he can use his watch for two full days without charging.  Now my question is... how? I can get around 15 to 19 hours out of my Watch, with minimal usage (Just checking time sometimes, and seeing notifications, around once or twice an hour).  What surprises me even more is that low usage he has. After two full days, his Watch has a usage of 3 hours and 36 minutes, while I got that same usage after 15 hours. He doesn't seem to use his watch more or less than mee, just checking notifications sometimes, and checking the time.  So, how is this possible? The main difference is that I got a 38mm, and he has a 42mm, but that shouldn't make such a big difference in battery life, right? I'm especially wondering how it's possible that my usage time is the same as his in 15 hours stand-by, while it takes him 35 hours in stand-by, and I am definitely not using my watch with screen on for 3 hours. So how can I decrease that usage time?  I hope someone has some suggestions, because I want that battery life as him, would be a dream coming true, right?"
AppleWatch,3cttpl,Nick51705,2,Fri Jul 10 18:50:06 2015 UTC,There won't be just one aspect of it. Part of the reason is the 42 has a 20% larger battery. Maybe too he has an exceptional battery - they're not all absolutely identical. Maybe he has fewer apps using location services?
AppleWatch,3cttpl,Deedubau,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:06:50 2015 UTC,"Well, he uses mostly the same as me, except for some news app he uses and I don't.  But what do you mean they are not identical. They have given the battery the same amount of mAh, so that shouldn't make any sense."
AppleWatch,3cttpl,Wheelscartog,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"Don't know where you get that they have the same mAh, but Apple has stated that the 42mm gets better battery life. If they do have the same mAh, maybe the 42 is more energy efficient?"
AppleWatch,3cttpl,Wheelscartog,2,Fri Jul 10 19:17:03 2015 UTC,Apple Watch battery performance claims are based on test results from the 38mm Apple Watch. A 42mm Apple Watch typically experiences longer battery life.  https://www.apple.com/watch/battery.html
AppleWatch,3cttpl,scarlac,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:19:36 2015 UTC,"Yes. I meant that all the 42mm watches have the same mAh, and I know people with a 42mm one, and does last only 15-19 hours as well.  Of course the 42mm has more mAh battery than the 38mm, but it doesn't make too much difference. And the thing here is that his watch has less usage time, so a wild guess is that there is something that keeps my watch out of standby for longer periods."
AppleWatch,3cttpl,scarlac,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:19:44 2015 UTC,"Some will be fractionally better than others but all should be at least at spec.

AppleWatch,3cttpl,scarlac,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:35:53 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is... if my battery life is 15 hours now, what will it be in 1-2 years.

AppleWatch,3cul20,txw7007,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:02:50 2015 UTC,So there is a public beta for the watch software?
AppleWatch,3cul20,Sequacious,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:40:44 2015 UTC,I'm not sure as I'm on the developer one. I'm just assuming Apple would make the WatchOS available with the iOS as they go hand in hand with each other and when there are public beta's the 3rd is always the one to go public. However I could be completely wrong.
AppleWatch,3cul20,i-Phoner,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:43:24 2015 UTC,I tried to look for a public beta release for one. Looks like no public beta as of yet. Would you mind letting me download it through your dev acct? How does that work?
AppleWatch,3cul20,Sequacious,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"I'd need to give you my login details for that and I'm not that comfortable with that, sorry. The way it works is that an iPhone is registered for the developer beta, then using that iPhone the user needs to log into their account to download a WatchOS certificate directly to the watch through the phone. I could register your iPhone no problem but all that does is enable you to get developer betas of iOS 9 which is now pointless because of the public one."

AppleWatch,3cvtfs,Steve2828,2,Sat Jul 11 17:48:55 2015 UTC,That's right - it's not paint - It's anodized - which causes an oxide layer to build up on the surface (and can contain dyes that color it).

AppleWatch,3ctfij,iGoalie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"Do you know if WatchOS 2.0 changes this?  The fact that the glance only pull data from the phone when activated spoils the experience.  Isn't the entire point of glances to present the user with immediate and up-to-date information?  Having to wait, sometimes a frustratingly long period of time, for the Watch to acquire the updated info when the Glance is activated completely breaks this.  I really hope there is some periodic background refreshing of glance data happening in WatchOS 2.0."
AppleWatch,3ctfij,sicjoke,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"Once the watch is able to run apps natively it will improve the speed, I haven't looked into Watch2.0 to see what types of network abilities it will have but the speed will should be much faster."
AppleWatch,3ctfij,iGoalie,2,Fri Jul 10 18:53:59 2015 UTC,"Watch 2.0 won't use change this, as glances are meant to be sort of ""on-load"" widgets, but things will be faster.  Now: Glance contacts Watch, polls for information, receives information, then displays it.  2.0: Glance polls Apple Watch app for information, receives information, then displays it.  The native app capabilities will improve this whole transfer-handshake process immensely, so the experience won't suffer. In my mind, if it was the 1-2 seconds I anticipate it will be with 2.0, then it refreshing as I look at it is a good thing because  I know its the latest data. Background processes are not optimal with the current battery/cpu and while some are necessary, you'd kill your battery with the constant cpu cycles that multiple glances would require.   I'm using ios9b3 and watchos2b3. 1&2 were rocky but 3 is almost smooth as 1.x, and the glances are behavign way better.   My glances are: Bible, Fantastical, Cloud Magic (email), Twitterific, Dark Sky, Music, Settings. All load really quick but on the betas when they stop, a quick hard reset fixes it."

I'll slap it on the charger to turn it on in the morning just so it doesn't lose its charge while it's booting up, that'll keep it constant.  If I really tried, I could probably squeeze out a 5th day with a couple hours of reserve power towards the end of day 5.  I've been off the charger almost 3 hours and am at 95%. Charged it last night to 100%, but I hadn't charged it since Sunday, the 5th. 2 out of the 4 days this week, I was out until 9-10PM. Ended last night with around 7%.

AppleWatch,3ctqww,Priext,3,Fri Jul 10 18:30:11 2015 UTC,if it's anything like the iPhone updates then they would probably just re use the same design for the next one with a bigger battery and faster chip and save money for a redesign every other cycle.
AppleWatch,3ctqww,Ncoder17,2,Fri Jul 10 18:32:00 2015 UTC,"But if you look at it from the standpoint of every first gen. Apple product to the 2nd gen., it's a huge jump with a changed exterior and new processors inside. Take the iPad to the iPad 2 for example."

I can't really think of anything that would actually enhance the watch except for a little more battery life and a little more speed when loading apps. It sounds like both may be addressed with watchOS 2. I don't need or want a camera, I don't need or want a full standalone watch (because then my carrier will probably want to charge me for a second data plan), and while GPS would be a nice feature, I'm usually pretty aware of where I am and have a phone with much larger maps if I need to find my way.   Also, it kinda depends on what Gazelle and similar resellers do. If they start accepting previous generation watches for cash, then I might consider an earlier upgrade. If there's a big enough market that a reseller company would offer something, then I might consider Gazelle or even Craigslist."

If they have and we are going to see new hardware next year I for one will be adopting the same upgrade ethos as I do for my phone and skipping a year (in iPhone terms sticking with the 's' variants).  Cost and incremental improvements in hardware are primary factors in this but is not withstanding the amount of shit my wife would give me if I were to drop nearly 400 quid a year on a smart watch!

My watch randomly reboots, battery doesn't last me half a day, haptics don't work most of the time, I haven't been able to use Siri since I got it, and the UI is sooo choppy and slow. All of that together makes it kind of useless day to day.   It will only be working better than 1.1 in September.  Although I haven't had the beta 3 for very long, it does seem slightly more stable (less reboots is all) except that my alarm didn't ring this morning :( if l were you, I would wait and see how people feel about the next beta if you REALLY can't wait.

AppleWatch,3cqol8,marlow2689,2,Fri Jul 10 04:59:31 2015 UTC,I see some benefit in tracking how long I slept. With HealthKit you can pair that data with all the other health metrics. Or see that you don't sleep as long as you think you do.

AppleWatch,3cqol8,latca,3,Fri Jul 10 07:35:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, I tired it out for the first night. For my initial impressions I can't say that I'm impressed with the performance of Sleep Pulse.  Foremost the time in bed and the time it said I fell asleep was registered as the same, even though I estimate that I didn't fall asleep for at least 15 minutes after starting the app.  It also registered that I woke up only after I selected wake up on the watch app.  For this first use, the save button didn't show up on my watch after opening the app in the morning even though this was what was instructed in the tutorial.  Though after going through the sync issues tutorial, I used the force touch menu to manually record the wake up time and then had to exit and start the app again,  after a few seconds it started syncing.  Going thorough my pulse record it remained pretty consistent throughout the night. It did have a sharp drop at around the time I estimate I fell asleep but the app didn't register that time in HealthKit, it just used the time I pressed the sleep button on the watch app.   The app notes the time you went to bed and what time you started the app, and uses that time frame to analyze the heart rate that your watch takes through the night (even if you didn't start the app).   The app doesn't have a indicator besides the graph of your heart rate on how well or poorly that nights sleep was like the other iPhone apps I've tried.  It would be nice if it broke down the information more to indicate the times you were in light sleep, deep sleep, rem sleep or woke up during the night instead of the user having to analyze the generated graph themselves.    I am going to test it again today and compare the graph with one generated on a traditional motion based sleep analysis app."

AppleWatch,3co9rl,gee1973,4,Thu Jul 9 14:39:18 2015 UTC,"We went to the Apple store and they let us try on every color.  I honestly didn't like any of them except for black and I already had the black sports band.  I've been happy with this band ever since (in almost every regard, see below).  I'd REALLY LOVE a PRODUCT (RED) version of this strap, even though I know it would likely get dirty quickly (I had the red leather iPhone 6+ case and it got so bad I replaced it with the silicon one.)  My only complaint about this band in general is that it sometimes ""adjusts"" as the leather bends and slides against itself. It doesn't ever get loose or anything but when it does it, it feels almost exactly like the haptic feedback.  For the first day or two I kept looking at my watch thinking it was trying to notify me haha.  I finally had to turn on prominent haptic feedback so I would stop looking at my watch for false notifications lol  Edit: So apparently there are aftermarket red ones on ebay like the ones you linked.  I just ordered one and we'll see how it goes, haha. Thanks!"

AppleWatch,3co57j,Berke80,26,Thu Jul 9 12:39:57 2015 UTC,"Hi fellow AW users,  I was among the ones who placed their preorders on the first day 4/10, and I've been waiting for more than 80 days for my Apple Watch to arrive. I'm located outside the States, but I do have family in NJ.   During my awaiting, I found out that my testicular cancer from last year has relapsed and and now lurking in my lymph nodes. After many scans and tests, my doctors directed me to start radiotherapy.   Now, originally my sister was going to visit me in mid-August, so I had prepared myself to wait until then to meet my new wrist companion. But by chance and good spirits, we realized a friend of mine was flying in and my sister sent my watch to my friend. And voila! With good coincidence, after the turmoils of doctor visits and CT and PET/CT scans, my SBSS watch arrived on the first day of my radiotherapy!   They say morale and positive spirits are big helps in figthing cancer. The resolution of this 80+ days of anticipation has been a great boost in my psyche.   We all find solace in specific hobbies and distractions and my leisurely pursuits have always been techology and gadgets. I've started my therapy with my watch, and I will always remember it as a companion to help me get through the next three weeks, and afterwards as a reminder to keep living healthier and fitter.   I'm now on my 4th day, and it's going fine so far."

The Watch app (and the Notification Center widget on the phone) allows you to select either pre-created or custom ""scenes"" (specific lighting color/on-off settings) to activate at a single tap.

AppleWatch,3crsph,falconkorea9,0,Fri Jul 10 06:51:54 2015 UTC,"Extremely doubtful.  The new iOS and WatchOS updates from this week make both the watch and phone more stable and greatly improve battery life.  If you've already upgraded to Watch OS 2, you may as well stick with it."
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,AncientApple,6,Fri Jul 10 02:23:04 2015 UTC,"I had Pebble v1 and have now given it to a mate. It looks like a toy when compared to Apple Watch. Pluses for me with Watch are tight iOS integration, great display and the professional look and feel of the device. The single Pebble positive was battery life which I hope will improve with Watch OS2+. Not that it's a big deal for me as I have two charging pucks and have developed a routine."
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,Wheelscartog,3,Fri Jul 10 02:53:41 2015 UTC,"I was a Kickstarter Pebble backer both for OG and Time. I have a Pebble Steel as well. I have gone through all the iterations of Pebble and without getting into specifics, I will say as and iOS user, Apple Watch integrates so much better from a baseline functionality perspective.  AW beats Pebble in most, if not all categories in my book. Look and feel, integration, interface, etc.  For the short time I had the Pebble Time, I liked the speed of the watch, but the color contrast really bothered me. Also, within a couple days of getting my Time, it easily scratched the surface of the glass and bezel.  I sold my OG and my Time. Still have my Steel (my favorite of the Pebbles) but it will probably get sold too.  The battery on the pebble is great; the watchfaces were fun (although I found myself playing with new watchfaces just to satisfy my want for the watch to do more). When I made the decision to switch to AW, it was based on the fact that I didn't feel like trying to make an effort to make the smartwatch work with iOS if it was going to struggle. None of those issues occurred with AW.  It was about the fact that the devices were designed to work together that makes it a no brainer for iOS users.  I really liked what pebble did for smart watches and feel bad as ""Champion"" Kickstarter backer to jump ship to AW, but AW just works better with iOS. Looks much better doing it too.  Note- this reply was tapped out while still half asleep, so excuse the semi-coherence of my thoughts."
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,yos9,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:03:13 2015 UTC,Half asleep or not thank you for your opinion. I don't think I'll be getting another Pebble watch for the simple fact that it just doesn't pair well with iOS. The number one feature that I so badly want on the PW is REPLYING! The fact that I cannot reply to a message or any notification right from my watch is so infuriating! And I do understand that it is Apple who was preventing Pebble from accessing such feature.   As for design and comfort. I only got to wear the AW once and that was for a quick moment. But man was it memorable. My OG PW seriously doesn't even compare to the comfort and formality the AW has while sitting on my wrist. With the PW I can always indefinitely tell it's there. With the AW -- Even for that quick moment -- I could tell that I will eventually forget that I'm even wearing it. And I believe that this is the most important design of a watch!     I think if I do go for the AW that I will end up selling my PW. Really no need for it at that point.
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,ptoothpick,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:12:04 2015 UTC,Really well thought out. I had a pebble steel that I sold for a 42 SS but lately I've wished that I didn't sell the Steel... Sometimes I miss the simplicity of the steel--I find that outside of work I don't want to be walking around with such an expensive watch on.
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,zindaret,2,Sun Jul 12 10:09:39 2015 UTC,"I've used Pebble since original kickstarter, then I upgraded to the steel. I didn't get the Pebble Time since I wanted to try the AW.    After using the AW for a few weeks I can honestly say that there is only one thing that the pebble is better at: Always on display. It does bother me that I have to raise my arm and not just look down on it. In every other aspect, the AW is superior.  Battery is no problem since I don't want to wear a watch while sleeping anyway, so I might as well charge it."
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,SuperCODPlayer1996,2,Fri Jul 10 13:33:21 2015 UTC,"I went from the pebble steel to the apple watch, and have to say i'm very impressed. For me the OG pebble looked too odd, not something i would wear personally but the functionality i thought was amazing at the time. When the pebble steel was announced it looked good and was still just as functional so i got it. Honestly going from the pebble steel to the apple watch has been nothing but positive for me, it does everything i want with the added apple polish. In my opinion it looks much better, works albeit a little slower but not noticeable at all, and has more functionality that the pebble for me. I personally use the fitness aspects, notifications are much smoother and can instantly reply with the apple watch, and the music app is amazing. With the addition of apple music you can ask siri to play any song and she will, or shuffle an album. All in all i would say if your happy with your pebble and just plainly want an upgraded version of it, go with the apple watch. Haven't looked back yet."
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,s0init,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:38:15 2015 UTC,"Awesome! See this makes me want to get it even more. Everything that you explained just makes it seem so worth it. But my only hesitation is the yearly upgrade. No one knows if Apple will stall the AW refresh, and albeit they probably won't. That could get very expensive too."
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,yawut,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:42:16 2015 UTC,"I have an OG Pebble, and haven't used it since I got my Apple Watch 2 weeks ago (mainly because I'm on holiday and forgot the charger haha) but I have really enjoyed using it and I feel it helps me out a lot! Especially with tasks and calendar events! It helps me organise myself a lot better and I just love having my main apps such as 1Password on it for ease of access.  Though, I do enjoy custom watchfaces on my Pebble."
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,Deedubau,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:38:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't worn my First gen Pebble since I got the  Watch. It only took a couple days to realize I wouldn't be using it again and unpaired it from my phone. I'll probably be giving it away soon.  I really appreciate the flexibility of Pebble's ecosystem and the battery life was great, but it was time to upgrade."
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,srochelle12,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:01:12 2015 UTC,This is exactly how I feel now. I've only had it for about 5 months now and I'm already getting kind of tired of it. Only because the AW does what the PW does only 100x better.
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,williagh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:16:40 2015 UTC,"I never really switched to an apple because I only used the pebble for a couple of weeks and decided that even though the faces were cool, the watch was ugly and didn't care for charging that thing every 3-5 days. The Apple watch is awesome because it has a premium feel and look to it. The Sports version is even nicer than the Pebble steel watch! For me the best thing about it is how convenient it feels to quickly view notifications on the fly without needing to grab your phone every time to check them now. I was worried that the not always on screen was going to bother me because I like watches that always show the time, but the time shows up so fast that it's a non issue. Plus I probably wouldn't want the lcd always lit up anyways."
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,nidku53,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:31:13 2015 UTC,"It plays very well with the iPhone, whereas the pebble was always incredibly spotty. Pebble allowed me to read texts (sometimes) very quickly in a discreet way (although the vibration murdered my arm every notification) and let me check stocks and the weather, but there was never any moment when I absolutely HAD to know the weather immediately. With the apple watch, I can respond to texts, and apps are much more useful, although at this point somewhat limited. Definitely a big jump up. However, even getting the sport model, I couldn't come to terms with how much the AWS costed as I wore it, and ended up returning it. I'm going to try the 38mm model to see if the size was too big for me before, but the price never sat right for me."
AppleWatch,3cr2hu,Nicenightforawalk01,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:00:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. The price is up there only because it is an Apple product.

AppleWatch,3cm7ew,vswr,5,Thu Jul 9 03:28:22 2015 UTC,I just looked at the bottom of my watch.
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,guildymaster,5,Thu Jul 9 03:27:41 2015 UTC,Can you share your super secret recipe to getting it shiny again?
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,guildymaster,6,Thu Jul 9 01:27:29 2015 UTC,"Sure!  Materials:   I used Cape Cod polish cloths. (be aware there are only 2 polish cloths in this pack, you may want to pick up a couple) Bought a bunch of microfiber cloths as well. (they're fairly big, you don't need that many, I just needed a bunch anyway) Latex Gloves   Took one cloth as my surface (yellow one as in the picture), then got another one ready for a wipe down. Got my gloves on and a cloth out of the sack and just rubbed it on areas that had scratches and along the parts of the steel. The cloth turning black is due to the reaction with the surface layer of steel. Once you give it a good scrubbin' then wipe it down with the other microfiber cloth and it should be super shiny-like.  Edit: I'll also say this for added clarification: Getting some on the screen and ceramic back should have almost no impact the materials. It's meant for metal polishing, but won't actually chemically react with the sapphire, ceramic, or oleophobic coating. Obviously if you sit there for minutes/hours while rubbing on the screen, it'll probably remove the oleophobic coating, but just keep in mind that your skin oil does this over time anyway. Just wipe it down with a wet cloth after you're done and you should be completely fine.  I let it sit for a couple hours as well."
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,guildymaster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:20:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! Will it damage the screen if I accidentally wipe it with the polish cloth? What about the back side with sensors?"
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,sosb,2,Thu Jul 9 02:56:37 2015 UTC,"Nope. Stuff only reacts with metals, Sapphire/glass and ceramic on the back doesn't get affected by it."
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,sicjoke,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:04:02 2015 UTC,Woohoo! Thanks for sharing :)
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,sicjoke,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:09:00 2015 UTC,The answer in the Amazon Customer Questions & Answers is wrong?   No. This is only for the metal. If you use it in the crystal it will leave a haze. It will also remove any anti reflective coating on the crystal.
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,sicjoke,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:30:54 2015 UTC,"Probably for regular watches, which don't have oleophobic coatings. Metal polish is lipophobic and hydrophobic, so it's extremely difficult to remove to even get to the screen itself. Also, I doubt it will do anything if you just get some on there, rather than actually attempt to remove scratches similar to using it on metal. It's borderline impossible to not get any on the glass. I'm sure it'll be fine. Mine is still fine after two polishes."
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,colinstalter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:56:38 2015 UTC,Whilst the face material won't be impacted are you sure the polish won't fuck up the oleophobic coating?
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,mybeachisbetter,0,Thu Jul 9 11:43:12 2015 UTC,"I'm sure if you vigorously try to rub it off or leave it for hours it might remove the coating, but getting some on the screen and wiping it off with water when you're done should have little to no effect on it.   Also, looking more into it, the coating is chemically similar to teflon, and teflon is specifically used in paint coatings so the paint doesn't get removed when polishing. I highly doubt it'll do anything bad."
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,pibroch,0,Thu Jul 9 12:10:10 2015 UTC,As long as you are happy. I managed to absolutely wreak the coating of an iPhone by cleaning the screen with some dodgy polish and would hate for anyone to do the same to the watch.
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,KittenSwagger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:29:54 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why you'd try and clean your screen with polish in the first place though lol.
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,KittenSwagger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:48:42 2015 UTC,I didn't. It got on the screen and through the action of wiping it off I fucked the coating.

I tried using the liquid stuff you can find at most hardware stores, but it just didn't turn out as well as it did with this stuff. Just tear off a little chunk, polish for a few mins, buff with a microfiber cloth....good as new."
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,bonestamp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:49:31 2015 UTC,The problem I have with that is the material can have little fibers come off and get stuck in some of the places around the watch. These cloths are just towelettes soaked in the polishing solution without the mess that can come from cotton soaked polish.
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,ryanmercer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:51:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't had any problems with resude or material coming off. But I can see that concern. I guess, whatever you choose to polish it; it's all the same. Some just more work than other.  I prefer the pre-soaked wadding because it is your best bang for your buck. At $8 a can, this will last a LONG time"
AppleWatch,3cm7ew,catsnstuffz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:54:14 2015 UTC,My only worry about using any sort of polish would be getting it under the Digital Crown where it might harden and affect its functionality.

I lack the motivation to workout or be more active, but having this watch be an asshole with its telling me to move more is starting to help."
AppleWatch,3copru,loveontherun1,5,Thu Jul 9 15:54:29 2015 UTC,"I was like you back in April. I was 20 lbs overweight, no motivation or desire to work out or lose weight.  Then the Apple Watch came into my life and suddenly it is bossing me around to be more active, I wanted to fill in the circles so I started moving more, but I was still not quite fully commited. I slowly realized how sedentary I am when I set my goal at 200 active calories and I barely hit it with my normal day to day activities.  Then one particular hot day in May I brought out this pair of denim shorts that I wore last to a summer festival last year, tried them on and it doesn't fit me anymore. The next day I downloaded MyFitnessPal, went out and bought a pair of running shoes and swore to myself that by the first week of July (this year's summer festival) I will fit in those shorts again!   Because calorie counting is so easy with the AW and MyFitnessPal I figured that's the easiest way to lose weight.  I made some quick calculations on how much I usually eat and set up a goal for myself to have a calorie deficit of 750 everyday which translates to 5,250 net calories in a week, which translates to 1.5 lbs loss per week.  I originally set my move goal to 400, adjusted  it to 500 after 3 weeks, then just this week adjusted it to 600. I've hit it everyday since.  I go running during my lunch hour for around 1.5 -2 miles, for at least 3 times a week, and do a 30 minute workout DVD (combination of cardio, strength and abs) in the evenings everyday.   It's been 6 weeks and I lost 10 lbs (more than my goal of 9 lbs by now) . I am halfway there and I'll get there.   And yes, I wore that pair of shorts last Friday to the festival, it fits me perfectly now and I was even able to tuck my shirt in.   :)"

The Remote app is brilliant for controlling your Apple TV if you place the app somewhere easy to swipe to on the app layout screen (mine's at the top by itself).  The text replies are funny, especially the emoji. Move the crown up and down to lose hours seeing what comes up.  Siri is most useful to me as a raise my wrist to say ""hey siri set a timer for 10 minutes"" then i go and chill while my dinner cooks.  Don't take calls on it. Just don't."

AppleWatch,3cp2h1,Joshoon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:59:08 2015 UTC,during exercises it doesn't match 1.0.1 but with regular use its almost the same. (during exercises it also fails to show a constant HR measurement)

AppleWatch,3cp2h1,Joshoon,2,Thu Jul 9 18:34:47 2015 UTC,"Beta 3 is much better than Beta 2. I can confirm choppy animations, though.  Battery life seems to be the same as with 1.0.1, from what I've been seeing with my own typical usage. (With Beta 2 the battery drained within four to six hours.)  Something I have noticed (with I believe all the betas so far?) is that timer alarms don't work reliably.  The timer itself works fine, and the notification shows up when it completes, but there is quite often no sound.  Which makes setting the timer kind of useless.  Restarting the watch seems to fix this for a while.  ""Hey, Siri"" seems to only work about 10% of the time for me in Beta 3.  I mainly use that to set timers, though, so until the timer alert sounds are fixed, this doesn't really matter much to me.  Bottom line: Beta 3 is way better than Beta 2 and Beta 1.  But 1.0.1 is still better."
AppleWatch,3cp2h1,dave_two_point_oh,2,Thu Jul 9 21:59:40 2015 UTC,"Nice explanation. Thanks :) I installed the beta, battery seems to drain faster, 11% in 2 hours, but sometimes it sticks longer on a specific number of battery percentage, just like now.  We'll see how it goes. For now, I am not suffering from weird bugs or anything."
AppleWatch,3cp2h1,Joshoon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:52:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm; what was your typical battery drain rate on 1.0.1?  I've been running the watchOS 2 betas since the first one came out a bit over a month ago, so I guess I just don't accurately recall what battery life used to be like.  On watchOS 2 beta 2, it was terrible, though -- about 20% drain per hour.  Right now on beta 3, I'm at 76% exactly five hours after taking it off the charger (at 100%)."
AppleWatch,3cp2h1,dave_two_point_oh,2,Fri Jul 10 21:54:35 2015 UTC,"On watchOS 1.0.1 I could make it just through the day, 15-19 hours maybe. watchOS 2 is a little bit less, but not too much. Got it off charger at 11:00 AM, and got in power reserve mode 45 minutes ago around 11:15PM."

AppleWatch,3cp2h1,AustinStanleyy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:48:39 2015 UTC,After beta watch updates.. Do a shut down n a hard reset to build cache. Shut down and restart your phone and you should be good.   I leave at 9am and work until 6-7 and tonight after beta 3 it was at 60%. Haptic's been back so I've been getting all of my notifications & i usually got home with 20% on beta 1 & 2. This is def a more solid beta release & Apple usually begins battery optimizations & code tightening on beta 3 and up.

And honestly, the first generation of iPhone was the same way. I remember not seeing it anywhere for awhile, until the 3G came out, it was everywhere after that.  The problem is, now that Apple has a watch, it's convenient to bash wearables, because Android isn't fashionable to bash. It's the underdog, and Apple is the giant steel monolith that traps you in it's walled garden with promises it definitely can't keep. It's easy to reap karma bashing Apple -- look at the biased article posted in /r/Technology the other day that claimed that Apple is now selling 10% of the watches it did at launch per week now. That article was claimed to have used fuzzy data -- I didn't look into it. Either way, thousands of ""lol apple"" comments ensued, some more thoughtful than others, but it was an endless stream of negativity.  Now, I know wearables are polarizing, and Apple doesn't make it easy with their self-aggrandizing and insistence on trying to focus on the fashion aspect of it rather than treating it like it is -- a nerdy computer watch. Most people who buy watches as investments are laughing at this thing, and not without merit. It's likely to be obsolete eventually, which wouldn't be a huge deal if it didn't have price points above $500.  The thing about it all is, though -- Apple can afford to do this. They have piles of fucking cash. And why not? Android Wear still doesn't work with iPhone. Pebble is great if that's what you like, but I personally wore an LG G Watch before the Apple Watch came out, even with my iPhone. I like wearables, and Apple is going to want to capitalize on that potential business. If the company has the spare capital to fund this enterprise, why the hell not?  This article touches on the software aspect as well... early reviews are just that. Early. While it would have been nice if the 1.0 had native apps, Apple often doesn't roll that way. This should be a surprise to nobody that's paid attention. From the iPhone, to iPad, to the MacBook Air. Every one of them have pretty much tested the waters and v2.0 came out with the Big New Feature Everyone Had To Have.  Personally, for me, does the watch fall short in a few ways? Yes. I want to be able to customize watch faces even further. For me personally, though... I walked out of the house the other day without my Watch. I was looking at my bare wrist all day, doing the flip so the screen would pop on (which, it has never ever failed to do so, despite what reviews have stated) and disappointed every time. I never found myself regretting that I'd forgotten my G Watch."
AppleWatch,3crmg9,pibroch,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:51:36 2015 UTC,"Odd that they would say it's failing since as far as my area is concerned, Apple stores are constantly sold out of them and the shipping time on the Canadian Apple site still say ships within 5-7 business days. I'm sure if it was failing, it would say ships in 1-2 days since there would presumably be plenty of stock.   Either way, I don't care. Smart watches aren't necessarily everyone's thing; up until a week ago I thought the same thing. Now I won't leave the house without it."

As far as I can tell, none of the glance layout options third party apps can choose from line up 100% to the on-watch battery glance.  It's a pain but that's the closest I could get it. I even had to replace the percent label with images of each number 1-100 rather than just using a text label, since Interface Builder applies extra top/bottom spacing to text labels.  Hopefully in future versions of WatchOS we'll get proper layout tools rather than the simple and limited version we have right now."

AppleWatch,3cjpt8,emgirgis95,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:31:58 2015 UTC,"Simply beautiful.   Have you thought about adding notifications when the battery gets low? I tried another app that claimed to do it, but it never worked even once, and was total crapware - yours has taken its place, thanks!"
AppleWatch,3cjpt8,Maxim_Voltage,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:12:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks :)  That would be pretty nice, but I don't think it would be possible with the current SDK.   It would require the app to be running in the background constantly waiting for battery change notifications and iOS doesn't support that kind of backgrounding."
AppleWatch,3cjpt8,1_or_2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:47:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Is it possible to add a battery check to some other periodic wake-up code, or does that API call simply not work in the background?  It seems the other app might have similar issues, despite claiming it can notify you - I've never had a single notification from it, even in the foreground.   Keep up the good work; I love your app already!"
AppleWatch,3cjpt8,1_or_2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"No, iOS only allows apps to run in the background either for short, finite-length tasks (such as continuing to post a Facebook message if you close the app during upload) or for a few specific cases such as playing music or providing navigation.  The only way to periodically wake the app up and run some code is for periodically fetching new data from the network.   Perhaps in future versions of iOS this will change, but we're stuck with these limitations for now unfortunately.  Thanks :)"
AppleWatch,3cjpt8,Ke7een,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:55:04 2015 UTC,"Would it be possible to insert the battery check into a periodic network check? I know I have other apps that notify when new podcasts are available, for example - could you code a periodic fake URL check and trigger a notification if the battery is low as part of the logic in that module?  (I don't know how limited those background API calls are, or whether the system will execute arbitrary code - but it must, if you can ping based on updated podcasts..?)  Just an idea for you to explore if possible... ;-)  I really should just sign up for a dev account... ;-/"

Figured why not? So I used my Prime account and ordered it.   Got it today and have to say, this is a lot smaller than I was expecting. The rubber on the resting area and bottom make it so nothing slips, which is nice. However, becuase the cable just rests in the groove, when you take your watch off the stand....the cable comes with it (magnets tend to do that).  Is it worth the $1 i spent? YES.

AppleWatch,3cohno,chetoflep,29,Thu Jul 9 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"Part of it is, adjust your expectations. It is a watch that does more, not a smartphone that does less.   You can quickly see messages and emails, and the ones that require little action can be handled immediately. Messages can be handled with canned replies or emojis or voice replies, which is especially nice if you're driving or your hands are full.  Quicker and more convenient access to small bits of information. Calendar, weather, and maybe your Instagram feed and news headlines if you've got a short amount of time to kill and don't want to get your phone out.  Dictate notes with evernote. Haven't tried that yet but may come in handy.  Monitor your health. The stand reminders make you get up, and the activity app can be like an accountability partner. You don't want to let it down.  Control music while walking or driving.  For me the watch means I can put my phone in my bag or just leave it laying around. I am a lot less glued to it.   Oh and one of the biggest things for me. Before I kept my phone on silent. I hate it when it makes noise or vibrates. So I would keep looking at it checking for notifications. Now I never do that, I know I'll get a nice discreet tap on the wrist when I have one so my notifications are off my mind.  Plus I have the link bracelet model, so for me it is about $400 of tech and $600 of jewelry which I am totally into. I've always wanted a nice watch, and now I can get one that feels like a piece of the future?  Which brings me to my last point. A significant part of the appeal is participating in a new form of technology. The nerdier aspect of the whole thing. Having an Apple watch not just for its function but also for the more romantic experience of taking another step from the caves to the stars.  Ok that's all I can think of. Just don't try to find the killer app that glues you to your watch. You'll know you're using it right when you find that you're looking at screens less, not more, despite the fact that your have added a screen to your life.  Whether this stuff is worth it will depend on your lifestyle and personality. I say if it leaves you ambivalent after a week or two, return it, don't sweat it. It isn't for everyone.  Edit: My first reddit gold thank you! Also, upon further reflection I think I agree with the commenters below, using the watch while driving is probably not safe."

Not a smart phone that does less."

I've been looking around at various solutions in this space, such as the Fitbit Surge, and found the Apple Watch well priced for the large set of integrations and features.  A FitBit Surge is $299, only $50-$100 cheaper than the sport, and the FitBit doesn't integrate with all my fitness apps, and is instead locked into the proprietary system.  The final verdict is still out for me, but for me it isn't a smart phone, or smart watch, but a piece of fitness tech which will help me get and stay healthier through heart monitoring, exercise, and standing goals for the day."
AppleWatch,3cohno,krystopher,2,Thu Jul 9 21:11:38 2015 UTC,At first I felt a bit unimpressed as well but that was because I couldn't find anything to do with the watch.

It was about two weeks without the watch and it just felt like more of a hassle taking out my phone every single time my phone buzzes especially since I work where a lot of my employees will text me and what not. Now I know when it's just a unimportant email or an important text message.
AppleWatch,3cohno,jmnugent,2,Thu Jul 9 21:19:02 2015 UTC,"Rambling comment since I was in a similar situation.  TL;DR wife bought it as an early bday gift and I sadly returned it.  I wore it for 10 days, before deciding to return it. It was a surprise and it took a LOT of courage to tell her I wanted to return it.  I found myself being overly worried about scratching it, and adjusted my walking and the way I held my wrist. I did love the sit/stand reminders, but when I went out to run with Nike+ I ended up taking the phone with me.  I didn't know you weren't supposed to shower with it (officially), and did try answering a call in the shower but if there's a droplet in the speaker you won't hear anything. I know people swim with it and there's a swim app but after reading the official Apple stance I wouldn't let it get wet anymore.  I wanted to use it as a fitness tracker but if you are working out with weights, machines, and cables at the gym (not running or cardio) then it becomes a liability, and as of now there's no official ""weightlifting"" tracking method.  I will tell you in my naive opinion who this is for. Like the positive comments in this thread it's for people who HATE missing a notification or phone call, and I did find it useful when I couldn't find my phone while donating blood that it must be in the same room with me as the AW is still connected.  Try it, wear it, and be honest with yourself and fiancee. I wanted to buy it as a gift too before receiving it. I read the other comments and agree, but found that it was a very minor enhancement to my smart phone, and the first Apple product I did not put a case or screen protector on.  Final story from my rambling the day I decided to return it when I was putting my laptop bag on I gently brushed it with the strap, and put some small scratches on the screen. Apple Store rep was not concerned, and echoed my comments on his AW experience.  This was the space grey 42 mm Sport.  I wish you clarity of mind, and may your fiancee support either decision you make!!!  When I finally approached her with my decision to return it I had such a sad sullen face that at first she thought I wanted a divorce!

I had been using an Amazon Echo in my house as an assistant and it's been great, completely hands free, and the watch is very comparable except that it requires me to raise my wrist and it's always with me.  I like that it tracks my activity and pushes me to be more active.  I like that I can quickly glance at the time, weather, my calendar, etc at any time.

AppleWatch,3ckk68,z6joker9,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"So far I haven't had the greatest successes with the update. It was a miracle getting it to install to begin with, but once I finally did (after 1.5 hours approximately - on gigabit internet with 802.11ac wifi) I found it still incredibly buggy. My battery life drained 5% in an incredibly short period of time.  I did notice that previously I was hanging on installing apps and the entire device would freeze, this seemed fix in this iteration. iMessages still weren't working at all and it permanently showed that I was near a Walgreens when I was not and wanted me to use my loyalty card. All in all, seemed pretty wonky. I decided in light of that, since the previous Beta was so c0rrupt that I would start over fresh and wipe and not restore a backup.   The wipe process looked to succeed, however upon finishing, it just sat at a black screen and never rebooted, and I had to hard reboot it (both buttons). Upon restarting, it presented me with pairing, which I attempted. It started out smoothly, but upon finishing the iPhone portion, the watch reverted back to the language selection to restart the pairing process, and the phone still said it was syncing. I then canceled out of the phone portion and tried to pair again, and it hung on verifying my Apple ID.  Finally I rebooted both devices and the pairing process was successful. Upon completion, iMessage worked successfully and the overall behavior/performance was a lot better. Unsure of battery life currently, not enough time to tell. Seems better than the ultra fast drain from before though.  Just wanted to report my findings to everyone in case this is helpful.  TLDR; if you are having funny behavior after installing the update, wipe and setup as a new watch. This process might be wonky and take a few tries, but life is a lot better afterwards."

AppleWatch,3cm6sz,kr0n1k,3,Thu Jul 9 00:09:29 2015 UTC,Apple should allow us to change standing goals and move goals. Many days I simply do not have time to exercise 30 minutes.
AppleWatch,3cm6sz,guildymaster,2,Thu Jul 9 00:13:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree seeing the green ring only partially filled each day really is a damper. Also it'd be nice to set when your day starts and not go by midnight as some peoples schedule is different.

AppleWatch,3cm6sz,guildymaster,2,Thu Jul 9 09:46:47 2015 UTC,Could not agree with this more...but for different reasons.  A recent JAMA article suggested that 450 minutes of exercise per week is optimal (in their study this reduced the risk of mortality by 39%).  The 30 minutes a day/210 minutes per week that Apple is using doesn't allow the watch to be as 'personal' as I'd like it to be.

AppleWatch,3cm6sz,EVRYEDGE,2,Thu Jul 9 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks!   ... those who exercised a little, not meeting the recommendations but doing something, lowered their risk of premature death by 20 percent.  Those who met the guidelines precisely, completing 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise, enjoyed greater longevity benefits and 31 percent less risk of dying during the 14-year period compared with those who never exercised.  The sweet spot for exercise benefits, however, came among those who tripled the recommended level of exercise, working out moderately, mostly by walking, for 450 minutes per week, or a little more than an hour per day. Those people were 39 percent less likely to die prematurely than people who never exercised.  At that point, the benefits plateaued, the researchers found ...   I'm going to guess that the additional benefit in going from 150 -> 210 is a larger part of the 8% (31-39%) mortality reduction than going from 210 -> 450 minutes. Especially if you take a guess at the corresponding data point ""exercised a little"" gaining you 20 of those % points (maybe 75 minutes?) - the graph clearly levels out more the further you go along it.   210 might also be just where the angle of the graph is such that diminishing returns combine with the actual likelihood of ""the majority/average person"" seeing it as an achievable goal that can apply to them, to be the ""sweet spot"" in reality for the whole population.   Of course, seeing the graph with the actual difference between 20%, 150, 210 & 450 minutes would clear this up, but it's the internet so fuck you, I'd rather argue with a stranger until they cough up the facts I'm after. /jk  Does make you think about the decision making process that Apple surely went through.  Going to go look for that graph and post a link if I find one. :-)  * edit for tl;dr: 300% effort for a 125% result is seriously pushing the wall of diminishing returns. ;-P"

AppleWatch,3cjuvl,jousta,6,Wed Jul 8 13:59:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with this premise of the article:   Take Slice data with a grain of salt   That goes both ways for arguing either side (sales are high, or sales are low). Until Apple releases actual sales figures, all of these numbers are estimations based upon extremely sketchy and unreliable sources, and certainly, everyone needs to stop quoting them as fact on both sides.  The one thing to take away IMHO independent of these estimates, is that since Apple is not yet releasing sales figures, as they often love to do; and didn't do a major retail release which again, they love to do - that they are trying to shield themselves from at least the perception of bad sales, even if they're not actually bad.  And that perception, is important here.  Because this is the ""first post Jobs product"".  And if they appear to have designed something underwhelming in sales as this first ""AJ"" (after Jobs) product, it would be a very bad look for investors and marketing.   And that to me, at least suggests, that sales are not as good as they hoped they would be, regardless of what they actually are.  After all, if sales exceeded their expectations and would be undeniably considered ""good"", then they would have nothing to hide and I'm sure they would have released sales figures by now."
AppleWatch,3cjuvl,Protonus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:37:52 2015 UTC,"they are trying to shield themselves from at least the perception of bad sales, even if they're not actually bad.   Agreed. All figures are estimates. No sense dumping on Apple if figures are not actually bad."

Mine actually started peeling when I was on a plane, nowhere near any dubious substances or anything.   For the record, I'm sure that 90% of the issues are with the black strap only, which is what I have (as well as almost everyone here citing a problem).

Actually my iPhones when they get that warm (from say the sun) will give me the sad iPhone too hot logo but the watch is getting that warm every night. From 10pm to 4:45am it's being charged from usually 60%+, I know it's not taking nearly 7 hours to charge 40% and is just maintaining that temp for probably the bulk of the time... that can't possibly be good on the hardware."

AppleWatch,3cjere,bjbyrne,0,Wed Jul 8 19:12:27 2015 UTC,That's because all of the third party bands we seem to be looking at over and over are designed to be cheap first.

I don't know the price point on the one you have either, but if it's above $50 I would probably still go for and recommend Apple's own, just because of the over-all look, feel and usability. But hey, that's just my opinion."
AppleWatch,3cjere,Turner82,0,Wed Jul 8 11:59:57 2015 UTC,"$30USD.  It looks like a 22mm strap.   I found that the Apple milanese didn't retain it's shape on my wrist. I also found it got loose over time.  In this case, because the spare length runs on the inside of the band, it gives the watch a fuller look on skinner wrists. The clasp does not move a millimetre."

I don't know if it's because I have smaller wrists, but I really love the size of Apple's.

AppleWatch,3cn1ml,M555G,8,Thu Jul 9 04:27:34 2015 UTC,"I'd give mine an 8/10. It exceeds expectations on some things, but on others it fell flat. Watch faces and their customization are disappointing. Third party apps suck, so much so that I don't even try to use them any more. [It's worth mentioning that both of these issues will be fixed with Watch OS 2]  Everything else is superb. Fitness features are great, and music controls and other ""remote control"" features are amazing, and what I probably get the most mileage out of.   Build quality is astounding. I have the Space Gray Sport, and it certainly does not feel like a bottom-of-the-line model. It's a premium device and feel, no matter what you get. I had a bit of self-fighting on whether I should spring for the Stainless Steel, but I'm glad I didn't. The sport models feel luxurious as it is.  Siri and messages on the watch shine. When I'm at home, my main texting habits are almost purely on the watch, as I find dictation on it to be worlds ahead of on the iPhone. Phone calls seem nice, but I don't get lots of calls, so I haven't gotten a lot of time to test it out. FaceTime audio on the watch will be nice when it rolls around in Autumn.  Everything else is sort of insignificant. If you have any other questions, I'd be happy to answer though.  Overall, I recommend buying the sport model, and only the sport model. See if you like it, then when generation 2 rolls around in a couple years or so, that's when you'd spring for the more expensive one. Trust me, it's not as much of a downgrade as people I've met seem to think."
AppleWatch,3cn1ml,LoserOtakuNerd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:15:58 2015 UTC,"I've had my Space Gray Sport for three weeks as of tomorrow, and this review says everything that needs saying except for this:  Coming to Apple Watch from a Pebble Steel, I had some battery anxiety. Turns out it was completely unwarranted. I wear my watch for 16 hours every day, walk 3-5 miles with fitness tracking turned on (with one busy day covering 9 miles of walking), and the Watch has never been below 35% battery remaining at the end of every day. Battery endurance is such a non-issue that I don't even have the battery complication on any of my watchfaces anymore.  8 of 10"
AppleWatch,3cn1ml,Valthonis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:02:17 2015 UTC,Great information. But what about the size of the watch? Is it worth waiting for maybe AppleWatch 2 as in a more slimmer watch...or is the current sizes good enough
AppleWatch,3cn1ml,LoserOtakuNerd,2,Thu Jul 9 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have the 38mm, and what I find is that after wearing it for about 10 minutes, it disappears. You never really notice that it's there, until you use it, of course. Ergo, no, the size is nothing to worry about. If you get the 42mm then it may be a slightly different story, but I have large wrists and the 38mm is my choice in size."
AppleWatch,3cn1ml,Valthonis,3,Thu Jul 9 16:58:31 2015 UTC,"I after my try-on appointment at the Apple Store a month ago, I've noticed that there is very little difference between the 42mm and 38mm models. They're very close to each other in size. If you're considering getting one and are even remotely close to an Apple Store, I strongly suggest scheduling a try-on appointment. Apple have used enormous computer renders of the Watch in their marketing images that give the incorrect impression that Apple Watch is larger than it really is."

Transit, more customization, more Watch apps, etc etc.  I will say that the Watch surprises me all the time. The battery life is way better than they advertise (probably why you don't hear complaints about it often), Siri works surprisingly well, and Apple Pay with your Watch is not only cool, but feels like you're living in the future.  Glances. I didn't think I'd use these, but they're amazing and have actually helped me out.  The only thing truly missing is more Siri commands when in the interface."
AppleWatch,3cn1ml,suave_historian,2,Thu Jul 9 09:49:34 2015 UTC,"I give it a 9, as a person who has never used a ""high-tech"" watch before but who has used Apple products for about a decade. I have been using mine for two days and I already miss it when I haven't got it on for whatever reason. It extends and expands the use of the phone beyond what I expected, and it's very user-friendly if you have used Apple products before, taking maybe five or ten minutes of fiddling to feel comfortable and organic when using the watch. I showed mine to my frugal mum and she bought herself one the same day. I'd highly recommend getting one; everything is just so damn convenient now."
AppleWatch,3cn1ml,SanguisTargaris,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:05:47 2015 UTC,Probably an 8 out of 10. Love it but the speaker sucks and is pretty much unusable.

I have to admit it was an impulse buy (expensive one, partly excused in my mind as a self birthday present :P ) and didn't think I would enjoy it that much, I have been watchless for 15 years or so now and wasn't sure I was going to tolerate the band in my wrist, or find it useful enough to do so.  But the device is quite good actually, as others have said battery is better than advertised (if properly cycled at least one time) for example yesterday I put it on around 7:20am, did twenty minutes of ""walk"" activity, then one hour of ""other"" (padel tennis) and I put it to charge at 1:00am with 20% left.  It helps you excercise for sure, but the jury is still out if it will continue to do so in the long run or lazyness will be more powerful. And it definitely helps you with the constant iphone checking and distractions.  I'm pretty happy with it, I would say 8, not more because even though battery is better than advertised, for a watch the ideal battery life would be weeks/months, not hours..."

AppleWatch,3cn1ml,swiftfoxsoftware,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:17:50 2015 UTC,"Hardware 10/10 - I have the SS and it has the best build quality of any Apple product I have used. The water resistance makes it feel like something more than a normal gadget. The bands are excellent and the band swapping is incredibly fast and easy (And no tiny parts to drop and lose.) The crown feels amazing and the haptic feedback is great.  Software 6/10 - The ideas are there and good - complications and notifications are awesome (Other than the ""2 unread notifications"" grouping which is dumb), glances are a good idea (but need to be preloaded when I start using the watch, not after I am looking at them.), and apps just suck right now (Sometimes they load immediately and are great, but the other half of the time you are sitting with a loading spinner and you might as well have taken out your phone.)  A lot of the software issues will be fixed with OS 2, but there is still a lot missing from there. Gotta leave room for OS 3."
AppleWatch,3cn1ml,Burthurt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:51:34 2015 UTC,"I'd say I'm about a 5. IMO there just isn't enough the Apple Watch has to offer to make it worth spending so much of your money. Personally, I have the 42mm Sport Space Grey so I spent close to 430 dollars on it (including tax) and that is just an absurd amount of money for this device. I think I am going to return mine and maybe buy back in when the second of third gen comes out."
AppleWatch,3cn1ml,MawsonAntarctica,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:18:41 2015 UTC,"This is my third day with a 42mm aluminum sport (green band but trading in for black) and so far I'm digging it. It's definitely something I don't use all day like my phone... and it shouldn't. Notifications are great and I've been playing with remote camera trigger apps for self portraits. I'd give it a 7 right now because functionality is limited, BUT I'm expecting more will be possible in September!   Biggest gripe, I can't get Siri to play Beats1 radio, but that seems like it'll be taken care of soon."
AppleWatch,3cn1ml,smootie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"8/10.  It's changed the way I interact with my phone.  I used to check my phone all the time for messages and emails because I always have my ringer off as to not disturb others.  The watch has ""freed"" me from my phone, which is now almost always in my bag.  I feel more fully engaged when I'm doing things or talking to people because there's no anxiety about missing an important notification or reminder.  On the other hand, I know someone who tells anyone who will listen that they shouldn't get the Apple Watch because it's awful.  For example, he wants to be able to read/compose emails on the watch - basically use it as a replacement for his phone.  I really don't think the Apple Watch was meant to do that, but if that's your expectation then you shouldn't get the watch."
AppleWatch,3cn1ml,Tech_fan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:02:32 2015 UTC,Coming from Android Wear and Tizen would be a 10/10. The watch has tons of potential.

AppleWatch,3chts3,Yeats,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:37:59 2015 UTC,"Any workout tracking?    No, because the tracking is horribly unreliable.

I have not stood up or moved my arm more than a few inches at a time in that hour yet 81 calories (I'm assuming they mean kcals which means it's absolutely wrong, unelss it actually means a calorie not a kcal like most Americans call calories) and .26 miles tracked..."

If just looking at it is not your main goal, it's not for you.   Oh, you get to poke it and talk to it occasionally, too, if that's your thing. And it is shiny, if that helps.

AppleWatch,3cmxo4,falconkorea9,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:51:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Now that you have it, set up your watch notifications to filter out what you don't want, and you can even disable ""show on lock screen"" for the others on your phone so incoming messages only show on your watch, for example.   And search the App Store for ""watch"". Check out reminders nano and ""charge"" (by a redditor) to watch your phone battery.   And prepare to have your shit more organised if yo use calendars and reminders etc - give Siri info to work with and she is amazingly prescient.   Enjoy!"
AppleWatch,3cmxo4,txw7007,2,Sat Jul 11 06:09:37 2015 UTC,Filling those rings can be addicting. I didn't work out for years prior to purchasing the watch but now I run five times a week!
AppleWatch,3cmxo4,neow_neow,2,Thu Jul 9 05:23:43 2015 UTC,This was me! I've never worked out or anything like that but seeing those rings and those reminders that you get from the Activity app just makes you want to get up and get moving.
AppleWatch,3cmxo4,donovanh,2,Thu Jul 9 13:47:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm like you as well where I'm lazy and don't work out. But I really like it where it motivates you to move around to reach your move goal and to stand up every hour by alerting you. Another great thing is when I work, I don't need to look at my phone for notification since the watch shows everything. I also like where you can just pick up calls from your watch instead of your phone (like 007 agent).   There are so many more that I can mention but I'm just letting you know the watch is worth it! Another thing I can suggest is that you can try it out. Apple does have a 2-week return policy so you can always return if you don't like it with no restocking fee. It'll take a couple of days to get used to the watch but it's really amazing!"
AppleWatch,3cmxo4,xxfoxtail,2,Thu Jul 9 08:30:25 2015 UTC,"It takes some of light quick interactions that you'd normally do on your phone and moves them to your wrist.  I like that I don't have to check my phone obsessively any more to see if I have messages (it's always on silent) and instead I know that since I've not been tapped on the wrist, there's nothing to check. Having said that I do find the fitness tracking addictive and love how the watch looks."

AppleWatch,3cko6f,burlow44,2,Wed Jul 8 17:52:33 2015 UTC,Not to mention more versatility with the apps on the phone. On the watch it's more meant for quick glances and updates and it will be 100x more useful when they will be able to instantly load on Watch OS 2 through native apps.

AppleWatch,3cko6f,BlottoOtter,5,Wed Jul 8 19:05:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's a reflection of the fact that, at least for now, the app experience on the Watch sucks.

The horrible third-party app experience seems very un-Apple and has been the only real negative with the Watch experience.   Then there's the the fact that 90% of the apps available for the Watch don't make sense as a Watch app. Who wants to look at Instagram or read a Twitter feed on a screen the size of a postage stamp? In an effort to cash in on the novelty or add another bullet-point feature, too many app developers went on a mad dash to create a Watch equivalent to every iPhone app without even considering whether the app made for a good experience on the Watch.   Hopefully the situation will improve when the new OS arrives, and as developers both learn how to make good apps for the wrist and realize that some apps just aren't meant for the wrist."

This makes alot of the apple watch experience quite awkward.  Though, I used to own a pebble and felt the same way.

Hopefully the situation will improve when the new OS arrives, and as developers both learn how to make good apps for the wrist and realize that some apps just aren't meant for the wrist.   But why should I be excited for additional features if the original features arent optimized?  Doesn't this send a signal saying ""We have bugs but why fix them when we can implement more features"" (which in-turn will likely introduce more bugs.  I suppose more features bring more buyers bring more developers bring a better experience.....theoretically  EDIT: by 'additional features' i meant Os2"
AppleWatch,3cko6f,digiplay,2,Wed Jul 8 19:13:31 2015 UTC,"Regarding your last point, the fundamental change in OS 2 for third-party apps is that they'll be able to run natively on the Watch, as opposed to the current situation in 1.0 where they actually run on the phone and get beamed over to the watch. (This is why third-party apps are so much worse than the official Apple apps - Apple apps actually live and run on your watch, whereas other apps are constantly shuttling back and forth between your phone and watch.) Independent of all the new features in 2.0, I'm hoping this change will fix a lot of the issues with apps running so poorly."

AppleWatch,3ci5he,WinterCharm,5,Wed Jul 8 04:43:14 2015 UTC,Apple Watch 'collapsing sales' report actually shows Apple is crushing smartwatch sector
AppleWatch,3ci5he,jousta,5,Wed Jul 8 13:20:24 2015 UTC,I agree. I love mine and it's only gonna get better over time :)
AppleWatch,3ci5he,Deedubau,4,Wed Jul 8 02:34:31 2015 UTC,"What I find hilarious is that people just look at the sales numbers, not the actual figures. Lets not forget that whilst this isn't official figures, Apple usually reports actual figures sold, not figures shipped.  The article I read said that < 2000 AWE had been sold. If that is 2000 AWE at $10,000, that is a revenue of $20,000,000. Let's go with a nice cost figure of each AWE costing $1000 to make. That is a profit of $18,000,000.  I would like to see any other wearable manufacturer make that much profit from all versions of their product sold. Let alone a tiny fraction.  Just doing quick sums based on this article.  I have made assumptions that in the last 11 weeks since launch. Apple has sold 20,000 watches 4 days in a week and 10,000 the rest of the week. Working out at 1,210,000 watches sold after the launch week.  Add in 1.5 million sold in launch week, that is 2,710,000 watches sold in less that 3 months.  Based on these figures revenue per watch looks like: Sport: $567,474,000 Normal: $595,116,000 Edition: $20,000,000  All together total Watch Revenue for 3 months is: $1,182,590,000  Almost $1.2billion in 12 weeks! 12 weeks found here from 8th July  Of course these numbers aren't correct, but if it's some indication, it's not something to scoff at. And doing a quick search for Apple's profit margins (39.9%) we can look at profits for the Apple Watch so far being around $471,853,410  The pebble time raised $20 million from it's kickstarter campaign (A month long) Splitting the profit by 3, Apple made $157,284,470 in estimated pure profit for a month. I don't think the Apple Watch has anything to worry about."

AppleWatch,3clu9v,Deedubau,2,Thu Jul 9 00:18:11 2015 UTC,Oh I absolutely agree- I'd gladly buy one for my wife in rose gold were I able. I don't know that op is a millionaire. All I knew from the context of the post before me is that he was a 19 year old with $15000 that he wanted to invest.

AppleWatch,3cg8l0,MadeWithaMac,3,Fri Jul 10 04:00:09 2015 UTC,"I think the error (if it is one) is that Notifications don't scroll horizontally, the way Glances do - it would be more consistent to swipe ""in"" to open each and ""out"" to close them. I'n fact, I think the horizontal scroll is underused. For instance, it's not readily apparent that in most (all?) places where there's text-and-arrow in the upper-left indicating the user can return to a previous state, swiping to the right does the same thing as tapping the text-and-arrow.  As for the ""Launcher,"" I'm not sure what you're referring to, but if it's the Apps view - that scrolls in all four directions, to accommodate the number of apps you have installed on your device. How could it not...?"

I'm not disagreeing with you however I'd like to point out that the notifications being swiped from top down is consistent with the iPhone of which the watch is an extension.

AppleWatch,3cg8l0,Dog51848RS,2,Tue Jul 7 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"That's very true, thanks for reminding me. The ""consistency"" I was thinking about was on the Watch itself, where one ""pull down overlay"" scrolls horizontally (Glances) and one vertically (Notifications)...  To be honest, I've found the UX on the Watch to be so different from iOS that I tend to overlook that gestures are being ""ported"" over..."
AppleWatch,3cg8l0,Dog51848RS,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"I may not have been clear on that, but I'm strictly referring to horizontal navigation, not swiping horizontally to take action. The latter is a good pattern in my opinion.  As for the launcher/apps view: how much time does it take you to launch an app (just clicking it, not including time within the app) compared to your phone? Is muscle memory possible on the watch? Is zooming the apps useful to you?"
AppleWatch,3cg8l0,cadari,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"TBH, I didn't even know I could zoom with the Digital Crown, so I guess it's not very important to me. I simply positioned the apps I need to be in near the Watch app. I don't think it's harder to use than  iOS, it's just different."
AppleWatch,3cg8l0,cadari,2,Tue Jul 7 21:33:28 2015 UTC,Do you feel it is intuitive how you navigate between apps? Could you do it without focusing intently on the watch?
AppleWatch,3cg8l0,HeathenCyclist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:42:29 2015 UTC,"No, but you can't do it on iOS without looking either, so I'm not sure what the point is... I'm not one for dozens of semi-useful apps on my Watch. The five or six I use semi-regularly? Yeah, I associate the color of the icon with the apps and I tend to pick them out quickly - at least, quickly enough that I don't think this area is particularly problematic."

AppleWatch,3ch9o8,Warrior_Scribe,2,Tue Jul 7 22:23:25 2015 UTC,4.5 hours of yard work. I'm not entirely sure how many calories one would normally burn doing this kind of work. I also drank a gallon of water during this period.

Other than that it's pretty cool."
AppleWatch,3ch9o8,TacoKingBean,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:13:13 2015 UTC,Sounds good. Do you recommend it then? 1-10?
AppleWatch,3ch9o8,Deedubau,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, for me probably an 8 or 9.  For my everyday life: 9 For landscaping: 7  I REALLY like the watch, but it does begin to seem pretty useless pretty quickly. Normally I work from home at a computer (the landscaping is just a summer, part part time side job in the mornings) so being reminded to move and being told approximately how many calories I'm burning throughout the day has helped me a lot.  As a landscaper, though, you're probably working out a LOT several days a week. So it might be cool to keep track of that, but I'm sure you're pretty fit as is, so maybe some of the non-fitness features would be cool for you. I honestly don't know how accurate the actual calorie count is from a day of landscaping, since you have to use the ""other"" workout mode and I've heard it uses stats from a brisk walk. You might burn more, or less, but one ""other"" mode surely isn't enough to accurately calculate calories burned for a wide array of possible workouts.  The features I like for landscaping are: handsfree texting, music controls, weather alerts, and telling time. But, honestly, most of that stuff I could probably do without and I take the watch off sometimes when I'm worried about getting it too dirty. I'm gonna get AppleCare+ so it won't be as big of a deal if something stops working. It would be awesome if I could find a decent pair of bluetooth headphones to stay in my ears, then I'd just leave the phone in the car or nearby in a plastic bag or something instead of in my sweat-soaked pockets.  Hope that wasn't too long for you."

I like Strava for the mapping and also the data it shows you. You can be ""competitive"" against people you follow and everyone else in your area that also uses Strava. There are ""Segments"" where it will tell you how you did on that particular stretch compared to others and also shows you have you've stacked up against yourself in the past. If you're good enough, you can also become ""King"" or ""Queen"" of that segment (KOM/QOM). It's just very motivating.

AppleWatch,3cglur,Certs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:46:49 2015 UTC,"I was actually so excited about being able to reserve one to pick up about 10 days ago that I didn't even pay attention and knew there was a space grey color! This color looks bit more stylish and maybe even a little flashy to me, and the space grey looked a bit more plain."

AppleWatch,3cglur,Krypto_74,2,Tue Jul 7 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like how the lighter look matches better with all the other band colors! I was gonna see if I could sell/trade the white band for a black sport, but I actually like it a lot.  Seeing the space grey color on all the other bands don't look that great imho.

AppleWatch,3cglur,Krypto_74,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:59:15 2015 UTC,Which one did you order?
AppleWatch,3cglur,Krypto_74,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:00:08 2015 UTC,"SGS, but I have to admit I liked the look of the aluminum with the white band. I've seen others using third party bands with their SGS and I've been wondering how much better/different they would look with the aluminum model instead."
AppleWatch,3cglur,TacoKingBean,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:02:17 2015 UTC,"http://mixyourwatch.com/  This site and seeing it at the Apple store made me change my mind on the color and I'm even sure you could get plenty of third party alternatives that look and feel good that cost a fraction of what Apple charges for their bands. I'm still 100 percent happy with Apple's leather loop band, but if I were to able to find one at a cell phone kiosk that looks and feels just as good for 1/3 or maybe even half the priced then I would probably buy that in a heartbeat and return the Apple one."
AppleWatch,3cglur,Trayscragg15,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:23:25 2015 UTC,"I have to say, right now anyway, that I like the look of the aluminum and black sports bad and the black leather loop. The colors a matte and distinct looking, and still classy. I believe I'd have to buy a black sports band separately, correct? Or so they let you mix up the colors on AWS?"
AppleWatch,3cglur,Twicey,2,Wed Jul 8 03:09:04 2015 UTC,"aluminum    That is correct. I bought the black sports band for 49 dollars and was planning to sell my white one, but I actually like the white one a lot. Before I left the store I found out they had the leather loop so I just had to exchange the black sports band for that. I still plan on getting the black sports band at some point in the future though. I feel like the white one would draw too much attention which I don't really want."
AppleWatch,3ce62c,Deedubau,6,Tue Jul 7 05:22:50 2015 UTC,These were all official apple faces?
AppleWatch,3ce62c,relatedartists,18,Tue Jul 7 09:30:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, Steve Jobs made an offhand mention during the reveal that one of Apple's board members wanted to wear his as a watch. After it was released the number of watch band accessories skyrocketed. Apple went all-in on the nano watch with a software update adding a stack of clock faces, the units sold really well then Apple cancelled it in 2012.  When they replaced it with something with no clip, no watch functionality and zero compatibility with previous accessories I knew they were making a watch."

AppleWatch,3ce62c,bonestamp,17,Wed Jul 8 02:32:17 2015 UTC,"I don't care how many watch faces apple makes, I'm not going to be satisfied until developers can create their own. Android wear has had that feature for over a year and Apple Watch will be at least 2 years without it. It's insane!"
AppleWatch,3ce62c,Prsop2000,6,Tue Jul 7 07:10:52 2015 UTC,"I am still a firm believer that this will not happen. If you look at Android Wear, for every amazingly designed watch face there are 100 absolute shit ones.  You can change your theme and overall appearance with Android phones too and cannot with the iPhone.  I'm expecting that we won't see an official ""make your own"" face market but that much like iOS jailbreaking to change the appearance of your phone, you'll have to do the same for your watch.  I do want to be wrong though as I have a handful of ideas for watch faces I would love to see and officially supported!"
AppleWatch,3ce62c,bonestamp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"I am still a firm believer that this will not happen.   I agree with you here, which is why it makes me so angry.   If you look at Android Wear, for every amazingly designed watch face there are 100 absolute shit ones.   It's true, but the difference is that Apple is in a unique situation where they can decide which ones make it to the store.  That said, I don't think Apple has the balls to turn down the number of watch faces that they'd have to in order to maintain quality. We know this because all apps are supposed to meet the style guide and there are thousands of approved apps that don't match the style guide.  They're probably also concerned about design/patent infringement, especially after they got burned a few years ago with their own clock icon design being a ripoff of Mondaine's swiss railway clock design. Of course, this potential problem isn't unique to watch faces and they've got ways they can deal with any app that violates a law.  Anyways, I'm hoping it's just an api/architecture problem they need to solve before they'll allow custom watch faces... but it's likely they'll never allow them. :("
AppleWatch,3ce62c,Prsop2000,2,Tue Jul 7 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"Another angle is battery life. If someone makes a watch face that somehow sucks battery life like a madman, you know they will go running to Apple to complain or it will cause consumers to blame the device for the issue.  I've had three friends abandon iOS in favor of Android because of battery life, even after I showed them that the issue was not with the device. People don't know enough to troubleshoot their devices... they blame the device manufacturer."
AppleWatch,3ce62c,bonestamp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"Another angle is battery life.   I totally agree, I was including that in the api/architecture problem... maybe the way it's built right now is not convenient for conserving cpu cycles and there would be major battery issues if they unleashed it right now."
AppleWatch,3ce62c,intulor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:37:29 2015 UTC,"Odd.  Every time I've picked up an android phone over the past few years, trying to make the switch, poor battery life is one of the things that always pushed me back to iphones."

AppleWatch,3ce62c,bonestamp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:57:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think there will be too many really really bad looking ones that will diminish the perceived quality of the apple watch. Apple is pushing this as a legitimate fashion piece in addition to it being wearable technology, so I feel that in order to make sure they keep that image they should keep this garden walled and design faces that aesthetically fits the watch. Just my opinion though, a lot of the android wear faces look like complete garbage."
AppleWatch,3ce62c,red1284,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:53:42 2015 UTC,"Ya, I agree it probably won't happen. But if they really wanted to do it and maintain quality, they could set very strict style guides and then not approve watch faces that look like shit. Even if they pissed off a bunch of developers, they'll make far more people happy by offering more watch faces and of course they'll have more revenue too.   It would be pretty cool if they created a virtual watch market where you could buy new watch faces from the store where even high end watch makers could offer brand name designs. They could even offer limited release designs like they do with real watches (only 50 downloads for example). Then, users could even trade/sell each other these limited release watch faces (apple could charge a fee for this even, kind of like p2p transactions on ebay).   Apple has the opportunity to do something really unique here... and possibly make a decent amount of revenue. Lets hope they have a vision for making really great watch faces available, however they do it."
AppleWatch,3ce62c,LosingMyEdge7,2,Tue Jul 7 16:22:33 2015 UTC,"When you put it that way, a watch face market, that sounds like a pretty cool idea!"
AppleWatch,3ce62c,Caidynelkadri,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:01:31 2015 UTC,I agree. Most of the Pebble third party faces looked like crap but I didn't care because there were a few ones I loved among them.
AppleWatch,3ce62c,burtilicious,4,Tue Jul 7 19:37:05 2015 UTC,I had no idea Apple had wearable iPods. Mindblown. Apple Watch does seem like the next logical step now. Now we just need them to be more independent of the iPhone.
AppleWatch,3ce62c,Qtard,7,Tue Jul 7 06:43:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was done on purpose, but for all we know Apple could've been one step ahead of the game and predicted that people would make bands for them. This was the precursor to the Apple watches and they were so huge that some of the Apple stores sold bands for them. I remember seeing a Genius Bar staff wear one and thought it was so cool, but so huge at the same time.  https://www.google.com/search?q=ipod+nano+watch+strap&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS614US614&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=XHabVcr4KdP4yQTdg5foCQ&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&biw=1083&bih=927#imgrc=zXMT2zImi6ZmKM%3A"

Years later I was looking for news on the Apple Watch, before there was one, and I found one of the watch adapters for around $15 and pulled the trigger. It was a fun novelty but ultimately not very useful or fashionable as I don't think it was compatible with blutooth headsets and you really dont want to move around with a cord attached to your wrist for music. Definitely worth the small amount of money it took to convert it from one of the more useful iPods into a multifaced novelty watch though."

Getting used to pressing the home button to see the time was easy.  My son now uses it as a watch/ipod and it's still got pretty decent battery life. Used as a watch only it easily gets a few days before needing a charge but only because the battery is getting on a bit. Used to get a week easy when it was new.

In fact, Samsung gave the cold shoulder to Google on this, and Android Wear manufacturers don't stand a chance, because they don't have the same capacity as Apple for designing a truly good looking watch, and a full metal case, like any good watch.  Until Samsung comes up with something that >25 year olds would put their money on, that combines the tech and the sex, it's a sad market for everyone else.  And when Samsung comes, they won't be letting Android in, and fall on the same game, with difficult market differentiation...  So Google has to pay someone to spread the word that Apple Watch sucks.

AppleWatch,3ci0f5,harvey73,2,Wed Jul 8 01:43:33 2015 UTC,From what I've read online someone tested jumping in a pool and it still worked. What I want to know is if I spend hours in the pool multiple times per week will it be ok. That way I can control my radio without getting out of the pool when a shitty song comes on.
AppleWatch,3ci0f5,bzr,2,Wed Jul 8 01:55:18 2015 UTC,This might help.  http://www.macrumors.com/2015/05/11/apple-watch-swim-workout-test/  I still havent tested it but might soon.
AppleWatch,3ci0f5,1st_thing_on_my_mind,2,Wed Jul 8 03:30:51 2015 UTC,I was swimming with my SGS last sunday in a lake. No problem so far. I even used google maps in the middle of the lake (iphone was on the boat) :)
AppleWatch,3ci0f5,joetom01,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:05:21 2015 UTC,I have spent an entire day at a water park with mine on. The only issue is when water gets in the speaker but using an air-duster to blow out the water fixes that.
AppleWatch,3ci0f5,FredTx92,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:13:29 2015 UTC,I'd be very careful blowing water out of the speaker or mic holes with an air duster. The air could force water into the watch. It's probably better to use a towel to wick the water out.
AppleWatch,3ci0f5,dcommins,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:46:23 2015 UTC,"The apple watch is rated IPX7. The number 7 in this code means:  ""Protected from immersion in liquids between 15 centimeters and 1 meter in depth.""  And:  ""Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion).""  To me it sounds like it could be used while swimming, but Apple has this information at the bottom of the apple watch website:  ""Apple Watch is splash and water resistant but not waterproof. You can, for example, wear and use Apple Watch during exercise, in the rain, and while washing your hands, but submerging Apple Watch is not recommended. Apple Watch has a water resistance rating of IPX7 under IEC standard 60529.""  I'm guessing the disclaimer is to cover their own backs in case of water damage due to swimming, but I'm not to keen on testing it myself. :P"

You guys are too friggin literal. My point is that if you put the apple watch next to ANY other device out there and then turn the devices on it's clear to spot the superior device.  Am I right???  That's what I thought. Check out the Samsung next time you're out. That's gotta be the runner up and it's terrible.   All just my opinion though it appears millions agree with me."
AppleWatch,3cefpy,Bull-in-China-Shop,3,Thu Jul 9 17:53:07 2015 UTC,Samsung would be the runner up? Not even close. Moto 360 or the LG Urbane.  Now think again....  Edit: Seriously just looking at those too you can say that one is years ahead?

Don't know why you can't!  I don't play music on mine but I do control music in my car sometimes, works a treat.  I use hey siri much more on my watch then I ever did on my phone, works brilliantly for me.  It is very waterproof - there is even a swimming app now.  I have handsfree in my car already but have used the watch for calls loads of times when my phone is charging upstairs, in a quiet room its fine.  You mention the pebble a lot ...(like a pebble) well Apple haven't lied to us about the product (like pebble) nor do they get screen tearing (like pebble) nor did they release a plastic time model then when their loyal fans had bought it launch a metal version...like pebble did.

While this isn't recommended, it shows that you should be fine with day-to-day use. The speaker isn't the best, I'll give you that.  But other smartwatches (like the Pebble) don't even have one. All of your other complaints are fixable with software.  Tell Apple.   Edit: clarified water resistance"

AppleWatch,3cfwi4,lolzter97,5,Tue Jul 7 16:28:39 2015 UTC,"As /u/bizzenwoof writes, Watch estimates that your body uses 1998 calories simply to maintain a temperature consistent with its biochemistry, and a pulse to distribute the sugars and wash out the urea.  My sorry carcase requires 2604 calories daily."
AppleWatch,3cfwi4,Unbathed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"Resting calories are based on your weight, age, height, and gender and they are the calories you use when breathing, sitting, etc. Things you do all the time that you don't usually think about using calories"
AppleWatch,3cfwi4,bizzenwoof,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and to put some more details on it...  Your resting calories can only change if your weight changes.  What could be confusing about this is that many apps and charts give you a ""basic caloric usage"" rating that's based on your resting calories plus some guess based on you saying that you're ""active"" or ""inactive"" or some other description of your daily activity.  That's because they can't actually measure the activity.  The watch uses a pure metabolic resting rate then measures your actual activity accurately."
AppleWatch,3cfwi4,calvarez,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and to add MORE: Apple's ""resting calories"" estimates are WAY too high. Calculate your Base Metabolic Rate and compare it to what Apple uses. You'll be surprised!"
AppleWatch,3cfwi4,krisjoseph,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:01:39 2015 UTC,"Then why is my resting calorie graph different every day when my weight doesn't change? It actually seems to mirror my active calories to some extent - the higher the active, the lower the resting."
AppleWatch,3cfwi4,HeathenCyclist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:34:14 2015 UTC,"When you are active, you are not resting.  So there is less resting time to show.  The calories are the cumulative of what you'd burn resting plus what you burn moving."
AppleWatch,3cfwi4,calvarez,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:41:17 2015 UTC,Which contradicts your assertion that resting calories are fixed by weight and that what OP is experiencing is normal...?
AppleWatch,3cfwi4,HeathenCyclist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:49:12 2015 UTC,Not at all.  Resting calories are calculated while resting.  The resting calories per minute are based on weight and gender.  How many minutes you spend resting is up to you.
AppleWatch,3cgq89,LoveOneAnother77,3,Tue Jul 7 19:53:50 2015 UTC,Why not just buy it new from Apple?

AppleWatch,3cgq89,Spades1412,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:58:02 2015 UTC,I suppose. Didn't think of it that way. Figured anyone selling on CL would at lease want their money back on the watch. I was able to pick mine up at an Apple store last week and see that all the Sport models are available at all the Apple Stores near me. Seems like Apple is catching up with demand.
AppleWatch,3cgq89,Deedubau,2,Tue Jul 7 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"Are you really looking to save that much money? I'd just get the cheapest version and try it out for 14 days then get a cheap band if you want to customize it in the future. Like any piece of technology, there could a number things that could go wrong with the Apple Watch that you wouldn't notice until after buying and using it."
AppleWatch,3cgq89,BeagleIL,2,Tue Jul 7 20:02:45 2015 UTC,"All the local police stations near where I live have made it known that they are more than willing to ""support"" cragslist transactions for you.

AppleWatch,3cgq89,Yeats,0,Tue Jul 7 20:20:44 2015 UTC,"That's very kind of your local police; however, I'm not afraid of being robbed, I'm afraid that there's something sketchy about the watch itself- like it was stolen and I would have trouble with the warranty, etc."
AppleWatch,3cgq89,agentdax5,2,Tue Jul 7 20:29:19 2015 UTC,Then you need to buy from apple. They have a great return policy. You are asking questions that lead you to one solution: buy from apple.
AppleWatch,3cgq89,ParadoxPenis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:10:13 2015 UTC,I bought mine on CL. It was all legit. $375 for a 42mm sport with blue band and addition black band. Was a great deal and mint condition. You have to be patient and a good deal will come your way.  But if there are no good deals I would just buy from Apple new.
AppleWatch,3cgq89,intulor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:56:06 2015 UTC,I bought mine on Craigslist as I found one in mint condition and they didn't have them in stock at the apple store. I paid same price I would have paid at the store. Everything worked out perfectly.

My FitBit had nice scratches and bumps on it from where it was banged in cabinets or against walls etc. I'm hoping the Apple Watch's higher price tag will have me paying more attention to what I'm doing with my hands.

I went to the Sport version and it seems more appropriate to the current state of things.

Furthermore, Apple can't make a smartwatch with better GPS functionality than GPS watches, nor can they compete with GPS watches on price.  My personal feeling is that anyone who really benefits from a GPS watch for a couple hours a day or every other day should just go ahead and get one. I really don't think Apple is going to address this area of functioning in the very near future. At the same time, I don't expect anyone else to make a GPS watch that has great smartwatch functions either."

AppleWatch,3cj55z,Yeats,5,Wed Jul 8 09:42:23 2015 UTC,No offense but that's a pretty ridiculous comparison. Of course they're going to feel different. One is a super premium watch. The other is the foot in the door.   I see no problems. Did you go to a retail store for a try on? They'll definitely be able to weed out what you want very quickly. I was never pressured to get the sport because it was cheaper. I thought any interest in the SS was met with more encouraging.

AppleWatch,3cj55z,FredTx92,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:21:50 2015 UTC,Do you think it's because of the weight difference?
AppleWatch,3cfk5g,SpierDorado,2,Tue Jul 7 14:59:55 2015 UTC,It bases your calorie burn on your heart rate.  It could be accurate depending on what type of weight lifting you are doing and how much actual work you are putting in.
AppleWatch,3cfk5g,someguyinnc,2,Tue Jul 7 15:01:51 2015 UTC,"I've been using 'Other' too while lifting weights to make sure it counts towards my exercise goal.  I just did a quick Google search and found this:   According to this exercise list from Harvard Medical School, a general 30-minute strength training session burns an average of 90 calories (180 calories per hour) for a 125-pound person, 112 calories (224 calories per hour) for a 155-pound person and 133 calories (266 calories per hour) for a 185-pound person.   I did a 31 minute 'other' workout yesterday lifting weights and it tracked it at 170 calories burned, and I'm 185 pounds. So possibly it over estimates the calories slightly, or heart rate plays into this?"
AppleWatch,3cfk5g,sidious911,2,Tue Jul 7 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"I want to know what your doing to burn that much but I'd say yes. I usually burn 100+ on days I deadlift, 80-90 on squats days and 50-60 on bench says. I'm not on your level but I trust the watch'a calculations."
AppleWatch,3cfk5g,TehRedSex,2,Tue Jul 7 16:43:54 2015 UTC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/362wsx/the_watchs_heart_rate_during_weight_lifting/  TL;DR No, the heart rate monitor is not accurate during weight lifting, and it will not give you an accurate calorie count.  EDIT: From Human Physiology By Gillian Pocock, page 431, emphasis mine   During walking or running, the leg muscles must alternately contract and relax. When they contract, their blood vessels are compressed and this drastically reduces their blood flow. Conversley, during relaxation, the blood vessels are not compressed and blood flow is restored. So in rhythmic exercise, blood flow to individual muscles will show periodic surges...In contrast, during static exercies such as weight lifting the contracted muscles have little blood flow as their blood vessels are compressed and they must rely on oxygen stored in their myoglobin and on anaerobic metabolishm to maintain their contraction.    I take that to mean that Apple's heart-rate algorithm is probably tuned for rhythmic-like exercises (walking, running, cycling, elliptical, rower...basically all of the currently supported exercises) and not for static exercises like lifting. The fact that I consistently get really low heart-rate readings (48-55) after a set (and wildy inaccurate ones during) is probably due to the constricted blood flow that occurs during lifting."
AppleWatch,3cfk5g,dfritter4,2,Tue Jul 7 15:49:35 2015 UTC,"This has been kind of general knowledge based on other HRM readings. One of the rules people follow is to cut the reading by at least 1/3 if not 1/2. But i gotta say, I did a 40 min dumbbell workout with higher reps and very short rest periods and I was breathing and sweating like I was doing a cardio workout. Watch said something like 450cal, I figure it was closer to 300."
AppleWatch,3cfk5g,1st_thing_on_my_mind,5,Tue Jul 7 16:12:07 2015 UTC,"I think high-reps and short rest is going to look far more consistent to the heart rate algorithm than a set of 10-15 plus a minute of rest. I think for your case it would be far more accuate.  The problem I constantly see while lifting is that it often far under estimates my heart-rate. After a set, it'll say my heart rate is 48, which is far lower than my resting heart rate so it's clearly incorrect.  I think the rapidly changing nature of one's blood pressure/flow during lifting throws the algorithm off, which looks for consistency. If it takes 10 seconds to read my heart rate, and a set of 10 lifts only takes 10-15 seconds followed by a minute or so of rest, I don't think it's going to be very accuate. Hopefully this is something they can improve in a future release, with either a more advanced algorithm specifically for lifting or additional sensors."

I've included some photos of that too. The band has a nice patina, but I might give it a polish soon.   Question for everyone: the band is 18mm while the Lessentec lugs are 20mm, so I've had to cut 1mm-wide spacers from stripped wire casing to make it fit.

AppleWatch,3cdk6f,gitgat,3,Tue Jul 7 07:57:05 2015 UTC,I bought a black leather loop for my SGS last week at the Apple Store in the UWS of NYC. They had the sport ones on display but I wanted to try it on. They were really helpful and even let me put a few different bands from the try on table on my personal watch. I wasn't sure which leather band I wanted. Then they got it from the back for me.

AppleWatch,3cb488,aussiescientist,3,Tue Jul 7 00:29:41 2015 UTC,I think it might have a lot to do with people matching the color of the watchface to the color of their band. It seems it snaps to the colors of the available sport bands.

AppleWatch,3ccu1l,hansorg,3,Mon Jul 6 22:31:54 2015 UTC,Heart rate doesn't affect your exercise ring unless you have a workout going in the workout app.  Since the 1.0.1 update the watch only measures resting heart rate.  If your moving around then it doesn't check it anymore.
AppleWatch,3ccu1l,generik777,2,Tue Jul 7 07:12:46 2015 UTC,"Track your exercising and fill your exercise circle when you're doing anything active by using the Workout app. I log walks, treadmill/elliptical, biking, etc using the app, and things like tennis using the Other activity on the list. You'll easily fill up your exercise ring. (Without using the Workout app, your watch will periodically check your heartrate, every 5-10 minutes, but when you're in a workout, it continuously monitors your heartrate, so you'll get better data too.)  For the record, it can get a little tedious to always need to delve into the app and ""start"" a workout of whatever I'm doing--and even more frustrating when I forget to track an activity--but thankfully the upcoming watchOS 2 update with an upgraded Siri that will let me just say ""Start an elliptical workout."" and have it start tracking will be great."
AppleWatch,3ccu1l,doublsh0t,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:20:19 2015 UTC,"I've been logging hour-long ""outdoor walks"", but my average heart rate during those is typically in the 130 range and doesn't seem to be moving the green ring at all. Shall I assume you still have to average a certain chart-related heart rate to get the green ring to move? Just logging a ""workout"" for a certain amount of time doesn't move the green ring on its own?"
AppleWatch,3ccu1l,1st_thing_on_my_mind,2,Tue Jul 7 14:09:51 2015 UTC,"only the ""other"" workout will log to the green ring. Also HR doesnt play into it."

AppleWatch,3ccu1l,1st_thing_on_my_mind,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:04:23 2015 UTC,of course you cant start an activity and sit on the couch. Each day at work I am able to do a 1/2 mile on my break. Heart rate gets into the high 140s and low 150s. Green ring never moves.

AppleWatch,3ccu1l,1st_thing_on_my_mind,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:06:38 2015 UTC,From everything I have seen its the pace and not the HR that matters. Same with going up the stairs because your arms would be swinging. I just swung my arm fast back and forth for a minute and it gave me a minute of exercise on the green ring. HR did not get above 100.
AppleWatch,3ccu1l,someguyinnc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:17 2015 UTC,What is your normal resting heart rate?  I thought if it got into the high 70's it counted it as exercise. On my walk my avg BPM was 91.
AppleWatch,3ccu1l,HeathenCyclist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"It can't be just the pace because without starting a workout, cycling doesn't add to the green ring until and unless the watch notices you're actually working hard - after it does, it calculates calories higher and both red and green rings go up.  If you start a workout, it knows straight away and keeps track more frequently/accurately. When your heart rate drops, the red bars drop but the green ring doesn't, even if you're stationary.   In my experience short rides get missed for this reason, and the longer the ride, the closer the rings/graphs match reality, if you don't use the workout app.   So it's not just pace - the watch clearly uses elevated heart rate to add to the rings when it notices."
AppleWatch,3ccu1l,Unbathed,4,Wed Jul 8 04:31:03 2015 UTC,There is no way to adjust the heart rate directly.  There is a way to calibrate in order to improve Workout and Activity Accuracy.  Are you walking briskly? Watch records exercise minutes for me when I maintain a pace of 14 to 17.2 minutes per mile.
AppleWatch,3ccu1l,Unbathed,3,Mon Jul 6 23:03:48 2015 UTC,Ok. Maybe I'm not low enough. I'm usually around 18 minutes per mile. I guess I just need to step my game up :-)
AppleWatch,3ccu1l,Unbathed,3,Tue Jul 7 00:01:13 2015 UTC,"Here's an essay on the health-impact of pace, which refers to studies which, one may conjecture, also influence Apple's Exercise ring system."
AppleWatch,3ccu1l,Unbathed,2,Tue Jul 7 02:38:34 2015 UTC,18 mph is almost there. Does an open space suitable for a twenty minute calibration session come to mind?  And of course it never hurts to Reboot Your Watch.

I run 5 miles a day, generally, and none of it is getting counted as a workout because I'm doing it with my Garmin watch and not my Apple watch.   Frustratingly, Strava does sync the workout to my Health data on my phone, so the log is even in there, but it's ignored completely by the watch Workout app.  Minimally they need to get it tied in to Strava or Runkeeper, perhaps in WatchOS2.  The native workout app is just too minimal, and my stainless watch and link band are inappropriate for working out.  I need a better solution before the rings are meaningful for me."

It's been a huuuuge motivator for me.  In fact, yesterday being Sunday I slept in to 11am - this meant I had to hit my stand goal nearly every hour left in the day.

At about 80-100 calories per mile on the treadmill, it would take at least 30 miles to get my 400% achievement - that's more than a marathon, and not something that is in my future.

Before I had the watch I checked my phone every time I got a new message, despite only a small fraction of them actually being important at the time. Same goes for notifications. Sure, part of that can be solved by weeding out the less-then-useful notifications (which I did after getting the watch anyway) but I don't worry about my phone anymore. I don't pull it out constantly ""just in case"" I missed something. If something important comes to my phone, it gets pushed to the watch. Otherwise it goes to the phone and I check it when I have time.   tl;dr - Phone is still important, but I don't pull it out all the time."
AppleWatch,3cexbz,dersma,3,Tue Jul 7 11:22:58 2015 UTC,There are a few design choices which seem pretty bad to me. Firstly the gratuitous logo on the closure that seems like a total afterthought. It's as though they sourced a band from China and just slapped a logo on it. It's also placed in a spot where the closure opens and splits the logo in two. I think this is an example of how making an indiegogo campaign shot with creamy bokeh ridden pics and showing lots of technical drawings doesn't make it an Apple product.

AppleWatch,3cdgf4,habalajan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:09:57 2015 UTC,It's a few days drive across Europe. It's also (something) below €20 in my instance as my work covers for most expenses if I match this travel with a business trip.

AppleWatch,3casph,ohsureyoudo,21,Mon Jul 6 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"This doesn't seem like the best idea. The continued impact of your hand hitting the water can likely induce pressures greater than those at rest at 1 meter depth (max the watch is rated for). The watch may be fine for a couple swims but I would not be surprised at all if the thing didn't survive a few dozen workouts. Also, the crown and side button are taking the brunt of the impact with each stroke.  I would would be way more comfortable doing this with some sort of bumper case that shields the crown, side button, and mics from the impact of each stroke."

AppleWatch,3casph,colinstalter,6,Mon Jul 6 15:28:59 2015 UTC,"This happens in every thread and it's so annoying... I enjoy the watch, but it's silly to pretend that it's designed for swimming. It's possible that the watch will withstand years of swimming, but Apple absolutely does not recommend it or guarantee it won't break.   That said, I'm pretty sure that even one of those Spigen bumpers that covers the buttons and mic/speaker holes will be sufficient to protect the watch when swimming laps."

AppleWatch,3casph,colinstalter,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:55:32 2015 UTC,Exactly. There are some great swim tracking devices out there. Although it would be nice to have an all in one device like the apple watch work for swimming too.

I wore the Apple Watch for a bike ride this weekend but also snapped my 910xt onto my handlebars so I could see speed / distance etc.  I've already stopped using the Garmin for short runs (1hr-ish) though -- it's nice to lighten up, as the 910xt is HUGE on my tiny wrists. I also used to wear a Mio Link wrist heart rate monitor next to it -- I'm enjoying the Apple Watch since HR is built in. :)  Fingers crossed that the next Apple Watch model will be waterproof and have a LONG battery life so I can use it for 8hr runs or long swims!"

AppleWatch,3casph,gertrudeblythe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:18:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use this for a few reasons. One being that you can't tell what lap you're on while you're swimming (I generally check my watch during flip turns), because they say the screen goes to sleep while you're swimming. Also, what can you do with the data you collect? Does it pair to the Activity app? He doesn't say. It most likely doesn't sync to Strava yet, either. And does it read pace per 100 meters? He doesn't say.   Also, there are watches out there that already detect things like what stroke you're doing, and there are features where you can tell it if you're doing a drill or kick set. And not to mention gps tracking for open water swimming.  So it's basically an after the fact lap counter, as well as heart rate monitor. Let's just face it - the first edition Apple watch isn't meant for swimming."

Additionally, whilst the reminder glance summary shows no reminders (all zeros) when I launch the actual watch app the text that says ""there are no reminders for X"" under each section has disappeared on the pages that should have reminders on them.

That appears to assume an absence of competition. Clearly another insurer could notice this $40/month increase in profit, and offer the policy at a lower price.  The savings to the economy-as-a-whole, the savings which are not ""taken from another person,"" are the reduced consumption of medical services by a healthier population.

I do tend to move my arms a bit while driving - adjusting the air conditioning, moving my seat with the various adjustment buttons and levers etc.  Another situation where the Apple Watch hardware and algorithms for activity did not behave as I would like was while skiing at an altitude of 11,000 to 12,500 ft over Memorial Day weekend.  For the entire day at A Basin ski area I was not credited with any move calories or exercise minutes even though,  in addition to riding lifts and skiing downhill (activities which I did not expect to yield move calories or exercise minutes), I walked a considerable distance to and from the parking area multiple times and climbed multiple times in my skis from the top of one lift to the top of the ridge.  On this occasion, my watch was covered by multiple layers of ski clothing (it was relatively cold for the end of May).  When I got back to my lodging at perhaps 8,000 ft, I walked around  town and readily earned appropriate calories and exercise minutes (from brisk walking).  So my recommendation would be that the watch cannot be relied upon to record activity while climbing Mt Everest.  😎"
AppleWatch,3cb9pf,trashonclybourn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:50:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I closely monitored my steps and calorie burn on my 25 mile (35ish minute) commute this morning.  I gained 14 active calories and 26 steps. Thats not bad at all considering I tend to hold the wheel with my watch wearing hand.  Various calculators online show that a 30 minute drive will burn ~70-100 calories for an averaged size male. Based on this, I think that the calculations on the watch could be pretty accurate. The only thing that makes me a bit hesitant is that it is adding steps at the same time. I'd be interested to see if it still counted active calories burnt based on movement even if no steps were registered during the drive."

But the nature of the beast here is that green light LED heart rate monitors worn on the wrist don't do a great job for resistance training-type exercises.  When you're lying on your back doing a benchpress, the blood isn't flowing up your arm in the same capacity as it would if you were out running with your arms by your side.

I did a walk with my girlfriend last night, mostly brisk walking, but couple slow downs here and there. After a 40 minute walk, tracked in the workout app, it only registered 26 minutes on the ring.

AppleWatch,3cb56m,nicholas818,2,Mon Jul 6 18:00:15 2015 UTC,Absolutely. One of the main reasons I use my calendar.
AppleWatch,3cb56m,8bitMotherFucker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:54:19 2015 UTC,Do you have a consistent work schedule? If no would you still do it if you usually had the same schedule every week?
AppleWatch,3cb56m,8bitMotherFucker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:55:25 2015 UTC,"I work the same 7p-7a shift 99% of the time, but my days rotate. If I just worked 9-5 Mon-Fri, then no, I probably wouldn't."

We authenticate to their servers with a certificate and then the app lets you see your mail and your calendar. It also triggers iOS notifications - which pass thru to the watch. So no, I don't add my work events to my personal calendar, but my Watch does give me the 15 minute warning on next events, which is useful."

AppleWatch,3cb56m,calvarez,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:58:52 2015 UTC,yup I agree. I'll never care for checking email on this thing but I'll probably start putting  my entire work schedule on my calendar for this.

AppleWatch,3c8sop,gary_keith,3,Mon Jul 6 08:19:52 2015 UTC,"If you can't feel it with prominent enabled, check your settings. Play around with the intensity level and volume. You should feel a tap for every notch you adjust your volume and when you adjust the haptic strength. If you still can't feel it, power cycle the watch and test. Make sure your band is tight around your wrist as well. If you're still having issues, take it to Apple and they'll take care of it."
AppleWatch,3c8sop,jtjdt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:47:06 2015 UTC,Thanks. I've done all that and more so it's time to visit the Apple Store.
AppleWatch,3c8sop,gary_keith,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:07:48 2015 UTC,prominent haptic just feels weird:/ but thats really the best solution
AppleWatch,3c8sop,catsnstuffz,2,Mon Jul 6 06:48:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I got mine I was skeptical about the strength so I turned on prominent haptics.

You can call Fossil and order any strap form their lineup of watches for about $25, even if it's not listed for sale individually on their site. Swapped out the buckle to an unbranded one.

AppleWatch,3c9bqf,Qtard,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:01:52 2015 UTC,"I did this with one of mine - it's a bit tricky but can be done. You have to push the lever and the closer side of the bar out as far as possible (perhaps with a tool of some sort, or screwdriver) and then try and get the closer side of the bar out through the lever hole, along with the lever and the rest of the bar. If you do it correctly, you shouldn't damage the leather or stretch the hole (much).   If there's a better way to this, please share - but this is the best way (though far from easy) I've found to remove the Fossil bar."

AppleWatch,3c7tx6,catsnstuffz,3,Sun Jul 5 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"This might crush you, but TV show interviews are basically scripted. The celebrities decide what questions are asked, and have pre made answers. That is why everyone who is interviewed conveniently have interesting stories tee'd up by relevant questions. They are on these shows to drum up publicity and part of the deal is that there is a very very low chance of it going wrong because it is scripted.  If you watch David letterman interview (I think) Lindsay Lohan, he goes off script and starts asking her real questions. She then mentions how the questions were not in the pre-interview.  Anyways, this doesn't seem to be widely known so I thought I would share.  Edit: alright, baffled by the down votes. Everyone go back to believing talk shows aren't scripted."

I can tell you there are not a ton of resources available and they usually have to replace the device on the spot. Just don't be an a-hole and stick to the story of ""It just stopped working yesterday"" and it will be replaced. The not being an a-hole is important because there is a small percentage of ""out of warranty customer happiness"" swaps that can happen with manager approval.

He would get a different Genius everytime and would scream and yell and make a scene when we refused replacement (all the notes for every appointment immediately pulled up when we put the serial number in the computer). He would then scream and yell at each assistant manager and even the store manager. He would refuse to leave without a replacement device.

This level of water resist is what folks think of as water ""proof"" since you can swim with it, shower with it, snorkel with it, even dive to up to 30 M with it.

It'll be at least another nine before a new model comes out more than likely, and even then Apple hasn't announced their release model, so there might be two years between watch models rather than one."
AppleWatch,3cce6l,Tatortotts,4,Mon Jul 6 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand why people think that a release cycle of over 1 year is going to be a legitimate thing. This is bleeding edge technology. If they do not update it every year, it is going to fall behind very quickly. There are a ton of improvements that can be made and even devices that have mature and long life cycles update on a yearly bases (such as laptops)."
AppleWatch,3cce6l,afrobat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:38:13 2015 UTC,Fall behind what though? It's the best ios smart watch on the market and probably always will be because it's 1st party.
AppleWatch,3cce6l,Babies4Breakfast,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"Even if there was no competition, that does not really give any reason not to have more frequent updates. In addition, there is certainly competition and will increasingly face more and more competition within the next few years. Android Wear is a pretty major competitior with a large user base. In addition, there is not much that is inherently limiting third parties from creating better smart watches for the iPhone right now.   While you may think of it as an accessory right now, if the product is to be actually successful, it needs to be viewed as more than just that considering its expense relative to the device it is required to be paired with. As such, there is quite a lot of incentive, in addition to the regular reasons, to update and improve their hardware. This is even more the case considering this is a first generation where the customer already knows of many ways in which the product could be improved."
AppleWatch,3cce6l,afrobat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:28:54 2015 UTC,I disagree. Apple went towards the quality and luxury markets. They are treating it more as a fashion statement and jewelry than a computer on your wrist. Very different marketing approach compared to any other product. This is where people are getting the impression that this will not be a every year new update.
AppleWatch,3cce6l,donaldkuser,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:08:41 2015 UTC,This is not a phone. This is a very different marketplace we are speaking of here and it needs to be handled as such.   There is also a different customer experience even in regards to purchasing (no subsidies).  Apple could easily kill repeat buyers if they are not careful here.
AppleWatch,3cce6l,IMDeus_21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:20:13 2015 UTC,"The phone isn't the only piece of technology that gets updated every year. Pretty much every single major tech product gets an update every year. Apple's iPad and Mac line-ups included.   Like every other product, something being updated does not mean that you have to buy it. One does not necessarily buy a new mac every year despite there being faster processors and GPUs each year. One does not necessarily buy a new iPad with each successive generation either despite the added hardware features and faster processors. Just because there are subsidies for the iPhone does not mean you have to buy a new one every 2 years and many people do not, it just makes it easier to do so. Even with the standard phone subsidy schedule, one is missing out an entire generation of iPhone by purchasing every 2 years instead of 1."
AppleWatch,3cce6l,afrobat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:12:49 2015 UTC,"Still, laptops, iPads are truly capable devices. This piece of technology has crossed that line from something you can't live without. iPhone\iPad, Mac, those are all capable of providing what people need from day to day. I love my watch but if it breaks...It'll be the last thing I replace, it's an accessory. Accessory does not define the other products."
AppleWatch,3cce6l,IMDeus_21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, so let's run with what you are saying and classify the Apple Watch differently from those other devices, labeling it as an Accessory. What characteristic of the Apple Watch accessory affects the watch negatively when it is updated each year as opposed to, say, every other year? That is, if Apple could improve its watch's hardware year over year, why would it be beneficial to forego these improvements?   Why would the Apple Watch being the last thing you replace make it so that yearly improvements are a negative? If it were to break, would you not want a more capable device when you eventually go to replace it?  The rate at which hardware is updated is mostly limited by the rate with which the technology is capable of improving, not due to it being an accessory versus a ""truly capable device"". If the technology that CAN be implemented within the Apple Watch were to improve faster than the Apple Watch updates to incorporate these new technologies, it would just mean that the hardware will become obsolete quicker relative to the competition."
AppleWatch,3cce6l,afrobat,0,Tue Jul 7 19:41:34 2015 UTC,I am thinking this is spot on. I really can't see them releasing a new watch every year. Think of all the delays and how much time/effort went into these watches. I really doubt they are able to get a more advanced watch out in an even shorter time.

I see the potential of the platform but it's so far away from being useable at this stage, (in terms of speed of apps, particularly 3rd party) and will be improved so quickly that it's hard to justify buy in at this stage. Especially the $1000+ models.   Apple spend so much time and effort making people want to update their devices, and they are good at it. I already feel that way about my phone - although less and less - and I really don't want to feel like I have to upgrade my watch every year as well.  The 3rd or 4th one will probably have built in GPS so you can be untethered from your phone for more things, and hopefully the speed of the device should be up to scratch by then, and updates wi be more incremental."

AppleWatch,3c9fad,jaysire,2,Mon Jul 6 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"They are most likely talking about the apple curated playlists. If you press the ""+"" button next to, let's say, the ""Jazz A-list"" playlist designed by Apple, it will show up as a playlist in ""your music"", but you will not see it on your apple watch.   The only way I've found is to copy all songs into a separate custom playlist of your own and then tell it to sync to your apple watch (actually taking up space from transfering the songs to your apple watch).  What people would like to do and what they will certainly receive in future updates, is a way to just play any list you've subscribed to in apple music from your apple watch.  I don't like the quality of bluetooth audio, so it's unlikely I will spring for a bt headset to replace my sennheiser momentums (although, there is a bt version of them at about 350€, so maybe one day). This means I'd like to use the apple watch as a glorified iphone remote for apple music. Right now it's pretty useless for that, since it can't start playlists, can't search the store and if I tell it to play jazz,  it plays one song and then stops."

I'd be willing to bet that we will still see the same square screen and 2 buttons / scroll wheel. However, I also think we will see better hardware (smoother performance), better battery life and a thinner housing.   At the end of the day, getting one will be your choice but in my experience, it's just not worth it. Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic product and it works great for what it is. However, IMO it's not worth its high price. Apple either needs to lower the price by at least $100 or give us enough features to justify the $400 price tag.   As it stands now, I will be returning mine but I certainly hope to get another one in the future. I'll say it again, Apple has made a great smart watch! but for me, it was a poor value.

If you’re into fitness, the apple watch as it is now may be useful, but nowhere near as useful as it will be in the future. Also, no matter what people say, this is a first generation product.

AppleWatch,3c8zsj,harvey73,2,Mon Jul 6 00:46:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of reviews will tell you the same thing, but the watch doesn't bring much to the table. It's an extension of your iPhone, and doesn't do much of anything the iPhone doesn't already do. It just makes little things simpler. I've had mine over a month. I use it to check the time, get a quick glance at the weather, and use the timer for breaks and such at work.  It's pretty limited without being paired to an iPhone. For runs, it'll do your workout stuff, and can play a bit of music into some Bluetooth headphones. That's about all you'll be doing without your phone, as the majority of apps are pulling data from the iPhone each time they're accessed.   It's a luxury, but nothing more. I'd buy it again, now that the novelty has worn off as well. Just buy it, and if you don't like it, Apple has a 14 day, no questions asked return policy."
AppleWatch,3c8zsj,nitrojuga,2,Mon Jul 6 02:41:58 2015 UTC,"The Apple watch is useful for what it is. At the end of the day, it's just a watch that connects to your phone. It prevents me from having to take my phone out of my pocket so often but it is not and it never will be a full replacement for your phone. I can't answer your 2nd question sense I haven't ran with just the watch yet but I can tell you that the functionality of the watch is very very limited when it is out of range of your phone.   Overall the Apple watch is a great little device. However, it is truly overpriced. You will have to make your own choice on how valuable your money is but for me, I cannot justify the high $400 price tag for what it is. I will be returning mine tomorrow. However, if apple ever lowered the price, I would buy another one in a snap."

AppleWatch,3c8zsj,EVRYEDGE,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:46:17 2015 UTC,"It's super useful as a watch, as silly as that sounds, but it's true.  I like the ability to switch watch faces so that M-F I have the modular face with a timer for my lunches, move goals, the date right on my wrist without waking my phone.  Then, on the weekends, I switch to the Utility as I don't need to know the time to-the-minute, and use less complications.  It's like owning two watches in one, IMO.  Second, I was in the market for some type of fitness tracker and decided to wait it out until the watch.  So, I don't know anything about the competitors but can attest that the watch has been truly amazing at motivating me to be healthier - and that's the whole point people are wearing these, right?  Last, I will speculate that we are either at the early stages of wearables becoming mainstream or they will fail.  I think it's the former, and that we will see some pretty amazing ideas come from these little computers.  (Sorry I can't help on the second question)"
AppleWatch,3c8zsj,hscsusiq,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"The main question for us was whether $400 was a Big buy or not, compared to the convenience of having a phone extension on our wrist. I said yes, Hubby (92yo) said no, he liked his flip phone. I got 2 watches. He is in love with his... I like mine, too, but see it as a perk, not a necessity. He loves the large numbers on the watch and Siri phone calls, since he's legally blind. Apple sells hardware that they update regularly, has a good User Interface and Ecosystem. They manage the software so that I usually don't have to worry about it. I gave up on PCs years ago in the DOS age, and, though I've tried Microsoft regularly, I just get frustrated. Android is better, but Apple has the best UI."
AppleWatch,3c8zsj,bizzenwoof,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:03:47 2015 UTC,"1: I absolutely love my Apple Watch. It makes it so much easier to do things on my phone and in a more discreet way. I am in high school and got one for my birthday and I use it so much at school. We aren't supposed to have our phones out and with the watch I don't need to. I get my texts on it, emails, etc, and all without anyone even knowing what I'm getting. Now the price. The price of $400 for a Fitbit on steroids is amazing. Even though it seems high you have to remember all that it can do. The 7000 series aluminum is enough to make it expensive anyway because of the process it takes to make it. So in short, get the watch and I promise you won't regret it. You may not know what you'll use it for at first but it has so many features that you will know by the first week.   2: I don't run myself however I have walked from places and counted it as a workout and I play tennis so I use the ""other"" workout and the watch is extremely accurate. Just as much as a gps watch or a Fitbit. Even before you calibrate it, it is very precise.    Hope I helped! I really love the watch and you will to! ⌚️"

AppleWatch,3c7iht,avbird,9,Sun Jul 5 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"I have a space gray sport and I can say that after a month I do not see a single scratch anywhere (including the screen and around the case).  Now I am probably not as active as you are, but I think the IonX glass and the aluminum hold up really well.  I have even heard debates that say IonX glass actually holds up better than the sapphire.  I have no idea who is correct, however."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,thehauntedmattress,2,Sun Jul 5 16:57:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the IonX glass has more impact resistance. The hardness that makes the sapphire crystal so difficult to scratch also makes it more brittle. I think with a watch scratch resistance is more important.   The IonX also performs better in direct sunlight and looks less washed out as sapphire is more reflective."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,Fireman2085,5,Mon Jul 6 05:09:15 2015 UTC,"I work as a full time firefighter, and then I work in construction on my off days. The sport has held up well, but I do notice little scratches on the glass, I'm guessing from wiping the screen off with my shirt. The scratches aren't visible except for in direct sunlight. Also, I sweat profusely with the watch on, but it seems to combat moisture very well. I can't stand to see the little scratches that are 10 times more visible to me than to others, so much that I'm contemplating returning it for the SS. Also, I've noticed that the sport band is not holding up really well, as it looks like the coating is peeling off of the band. Don't get me wrong, I love this watch. I just feel that it isn't as durable as the prices suggest it should be."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,Fireman2085,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:22:21 2015 UTC,Agreed- the price is a bit steep especially considering the advantages and disadvantages of both. There are still disadvantages to the higher end SS model and I feel like at this price point they should be fewer.
AppleWatch,3c7iht,Karefree2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:11:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I really want to love this product, but I would then have to love small imperfections in my $400+ watch."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,Karefree2,3,Tue Jul 7 00:55:40 2015 UTC,"I bought the sport figuring I'd best just ""dip my toe in"" since it's a first gen product and quite expensive to boot. But then once I started using it, I realized just how much I love it, and started to worry about scratching the screen. I know the sport's ionX glass is more shatter resistant than the sapphire screen, but in my lifestyle (desk job, my workouts are mostly the elliptical machine or walking) I'm much more likely to scratch a screen klutzily banging a door jam or counter than to shatter one. So, purely for the scratch-resistance, I decided to upgrade to the Apple Watch.  And then I put it on, and oh, how much more beautiful that stainless steel is!  The aluminum sport certainly looks more than fine, it looks very much in fact like my beautiful iPhone. But - the stainless steel looks less like a gadget and more like jewelry. It certainly suits my taste and my style much better, in a way that really took me by surprise. I didn't think I needed shiny until I tried the shiny. :)  So for me, stainless was the way to go. However, if finances allowed only for the sport, that would have been totally fine. Though I would probably use a screen protector in that case."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,intulor,2,Sun Jul 5 19:10:58 2015 UTC,Exactly the case for me. I am so much more likely to bang my wrist into a car door or scuff it on a railing than I am to do anything that could flat out shatter it. You never know though.   And agreed about the looks- the SS is much more like jewelry. My only hold up is that I'll get the SS and then still want to upgrade in less than a year! But it seems like a lot of people who went with the sport ended up upgrading now.
AppleWatch,3c7iht,cmbf4,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:16:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, and for the ""you never know"" I did get AppleCare+. :)  Of course I may very well be upgrading to version 2 in a year or two, but ultimately I decided I wanted to really REALLY enjoy the watch while I had it, regardless of how long that was. Not that I wasn't enjoying the sport, but I'm enjoying the stainless steel that much more. Not only the peace of mind that comes with a sapphire face over glass, but ... ""Jewelry on my wrist"" is definitely more ""my look"" than ""Gadget on my wrist."" :)  Ultimately, you've gotten a lot of good input here, but only you can decide for you ... good luck, you're putting a lot of thought into the decision and I'm sure you'll very much enjoy whatever you choose! There is no ""wrong"" and you do get 14 days to decide if what you choose is right for YOU."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,lunaticc,3,Mon Jul 6 13:32:00 2015 UTC,"I would go for the SS with sapphire.  I don't live an active life style, but my previous watches were scratched all to hell working office jobs, just with incidental bumps.  It got to the point where I would turn the face to the bottom of my wrist to avoid it, but Apple says the sensors won't work properly if you do this and from anecdotal evidence online, it makes it harder to activate the watch face through gesture."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,skateboardern,2,Sun Jul 5 17:00:15 2015 UTC,"i was like you before- was so dilemma between these both faces... but I glad i got sports aluminum....  it has been more than a month and half- no scratch and again- I work at retail place, a lot of moving requirements yet havent hit my watch.. I got myself applecare+ though! but heres the point:  stainless steel is nice for any kind of bands that aluminum may wont look great - i dont really mind, I am ok with add leather loop (3rd party cos i got 38mm) and i own 2 Stainless steel fossil watches which I'd never rid of them.    If you care about face itself, you may want to get something that it looks good on you but otherwise- spend less on the first generation and go for alumnium, and if you dont like, you can always return and get stainless steel... otherwise- visit nearby apple store and try it on :)"

AppleWatch,3c7iht,PearlDrummer,2,Sun Jul 5 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"I had a sport, scratched it in a week, said fuck it, sold it, and bought a stainless steel. For me, the Extra $150-250 was worth me not having to worry about scratching the screen after every accidental contact. It's such a gorgeous device, they get noticed regardless.   When I had the sport the comments were like ""Oh is that an apple watch? That's awesome."" now it's more ""that's a gorgeous watch, what is it? Oh it's an apple watch? That's amazing."""
AppleWatch,3c7iht,octopusslover,2,Sun Jul 5 19:28:22 2015 UTC,I rock a sport right now but if the next one has a good enough update... I'll sell it and switch to a stainless. I think the Sport is a nice first gen. I like the stainless look more... but that's a high price point for a first gen watch. I only have a very very minor scuff on the glass and it's not even on the face. It's on the edge of the glass where you can't see it unless you look for it in sunlight. The aluminum has held up very well so far. I'm quite active and haven't had any issues so far. You can always start with the Sport and see if you  really want to switch to the stainless within the 2 week return policy period.
AppleWatch,3c7iht,girlcockboycockEIEIO,2,Sun Jul 5 21:26:42 2015 UTC,If you care about looks alone go for stainless steel. It has the most options as far as extra bands you could want. Personally I got the silver aluminum sport and would like to upgrade to stainless steel just because I like the weight of it better.

AppleWatch,3c7iht,retroredditrobot,3,Sun Jul 5 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even consider a sport, tbh.  It's a watch and I want it to look as good as possible.  The SS handles this dually, both because it genuinely looks better by itself and also because you can use real/non-sport bands to make it look even nicer, without a tacky mismatch of finishes.  People who bought the Sport will get all defensive and likely down vote, but there is only one answer."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,HardcoreObsessive,3,Sun Jul 5 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"I agree mostly with this. However, I would say the leather loop bands work well with the sport gray. I myself own the SGS in 42mm and have a black sport band and a black leather loop.   I would not pair my SGS with a Milanese or Steel band but then again, I feel like if you want those bands your only choice is to get a SS."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,Wrigenfield,-1,Sun Jul 5 19:37:05 2015 UTC,"If you opt for the white aluminum, instead of the space gray sport, you're really open for a lot more options of third-party bands that will actually look good."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,falconkorea9,3,Mon Jul 6 07:53:32 2015 UTC,"I bought the sport space grey, I was cautious about spending more to go for the SS version in case I didn't like it compared to existing watches. The Sport has held up well but I'm always conscious of a watch on my wrist and take care not to damage it. I don't have any damage on my sport but the Stainless Steel one should be arriving on Monday.   I love the watch so much I want the one made out of nicer materials, I'd be quite sad if I damaged my apple watch so I wanted to upgrade to the SS model. I'll sell my sport on Ebay. There's nothing wrong with the sport, it may be more durable finish wise than the SS given that the SS apparently shows scratches fairly easily going on reports I've read, but I'm really nervous about getting the ion-x glass scratched and will feel more comfortable when I have the SS and Sapphire on my wrist."
AppleWatch,3c7iht,Tech_fan,2,Sun Jul 5 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"I have the SS and am glad that I spent the extra money. For something that I wear everyday including to work, I find it looks much nicer, especially with a suit!"

AppleWatch,3c7iht,keremy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:47:53 2015 UTC,I workout 7 days a week and have banged my sport against walls and elliptical as well. It has held up well. I also have a clear case on mine that protects the edges and back. If you get the SS a case might be something to avoid. I heard that dirt and dust gets in between the case and watch and acts like an abrasion.   The SS looks sharp and I go back and forth between the sport and SS. I have bought a couple bands for my Sport as well which helps to accessorize.   Something to contemplate....I read on a website that 71% buy the 42mm. The 42mm IMO is not that big compared to the 38. After all it's only a 4mm difference. Also bands like the leather loop won't work with the 38mm.

AppleWatch,3c818z,ibrownied,8,Sun Jul 5 19:39:34 2015 UTC,I just wanted to say thanks for using proper grammar.  The way many people type on Reddit makes me think English is no longer being taught in schools.

AppleWatch,3c818z,sosb,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:13:47 2015 UTC,I guess you mean with Siri? If it frustrates you that much just alter what you’re saying. “You are” instead of “you’re” and “also” instead to “too”.
AppleWatch,3c818z,sosb,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:48:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the problem is that with too/to there/they're/their they all basically sound the same, and most of the time she fucks up on the dictation."
AppleWatch,3c818z,sicjoke,3,Sun Jul 5 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, which is why I suggested you alter the way you speak as it seems to frustrate you so much. However you posed it as a problem with the watch, when your issue is with Siri."

AppleWatch,3c818z,sicjoke,2,Sun Jul 5 19:58:55 2015 UTC,You say it at the end of wherever you'd like to place it. It's weird saying exclamation point out loud but you get used to it!
AppleWatch,3c818z,bonneville2004,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:04:24 2015 UTC,"Odd, I have been trying that but it wasn't working."

AppleWatch,3c818z,auviewer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"An example of grammar is your use of the word 'that' in your main sentence.  You have used it correctly but some would use 'which' and whilst not an issue with Siri, it does get my goat."

AppleWatch,3c4dda,andyhenault,2,Mon Jul 6 17:08:27 2015 UTC,we are now able to know precipitation down to the minute (while not exactly the very second). Pretty amazing prediction c   Eh. I've had it for a few weeks now and it's not very accurate. Several times it's told me drizzle or something starting soon when it's been pouring for hours and continued to pour.
AppleWatch,3c4dda,johnthepaptest,2,Sun Jul 5 12:24:23 2015 UTC,Hoverboard.
AppleWatch,3c4dda,Galp_Nation,2,Sun Jul 5 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"I had to uninstall Dark Sky from my iPhone because it was depleting the battery twice as fast. It's a neat feature, but unless you like having to recharge your iPhone mid-day, knowing the exact second the rain will start and stop isn't ready for prime time.  Besides, it wasn't nearly as accurate as people claim. It kept telling me ""Drizzle starting"" when there wasn't a cloud in the bright, sunny sky."
AppleWatch,3c4dda,InsaneNinja,5,Sat Jul 4 21:45:51 2015 UTC,Dark Sky has used 1% of my battery in the past 7 days.  That's with notification frequency turned all the way up and I gave them permission to use the barometer in my phone.
AppleWatch,3c4dda,HeathenCyclist,3,Sun Jul 5 15:49:56 2015 UTC,"Huh.  I only use Dark Sky on my Apple Watch and am typically impressed by its accuracy. I also don't have any issues with insufficient battery. Not that I doubt your experience, but this has certainly been mine."
AppleWatch,3c4dda,InsaneNinja,2,Sat Jul 4 22:03:46 2015 UTC,"He probably had active notifications on, which means the app keeps constant track of his location, to send local notifications before it rains."

AppleWatch,3c4dda,brentajones,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:25:53 2015 UTC,The accuracy is the main selling point. Using the widget is good. Active notifications are not something that you need when you were sitting inside. This is something you're only supposed to turn on sparingly. Such as if you're outside with your iPad at the beach.
AppleWatch,3c4dda,8eightmph,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:30:22 2015 UTC,"But doesn't it need to run in the background for the crowd-sourcing to provide that level of accuracy?  If everyone turns it off, the accuracy isn't there."
AppleWatch,3c4dda,ryanmercer,3,Sat Jul 4 23:36:14 2015 UTC,I didn't know it used crowd sourcing. I figured it just uses typical radar data and your specific location to determine when you'll experience a specific state of precipitation.
AppleWatch,3c4dda,liberals_guzzle_piss,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:50:04 2015 UTC,"I think it primarily uses radar data. There are user reports of the weather, but my understanding was that they'd use those to improve their forecasting from radar data, not to tell other folks in your area or nearby that it was raining or whatever.

Typically, I only leave my house during the weekdays to go to work (and stay out after a few hours with coworkers, if that), so I'm checking on it to see if I'm losing 20%, 25%, 33%, to get an idea of how many days it'll be until I have to charge it. Most of the time, I can get 4 workdays (10-12 hours) out of it, which is really impressive and better than most Android Wear watches."

I think the hardest part is to get the app running in the background and apple allowing the dev to run processes in the background as well as use the sensor information.  I think SleepCycle has been wanting to do this since the watch was announced but can't with software limitations."
AppleWatch,3c3q09,liquid5170,2,Sun Jul 5 13:57:56 2015 UTC,I do this too. Also the alarm from the watch is so much more pleasant than any of my audio alarms from my phone.

AppleWatch,3c4ivm,BrandonRawks,2,Sat Jul 4 20:20:17 2015 UTC,Actually there is.  Encrypted backups retain activity tracking (I believe iCloud backups do as well).  The way around it is to make sure you take one of these backups right before restoring the phone.

Rebooting didn't work for me, but unpairing and re-pairing (in the watch app, not just turning off Bluetooth) fixed it. It'll take a little bit to do as it clears the watch during unpairing and does all the same pairing steps it did the first time, but you shouldn't lose anything, I believe it  restores from a backup? Either way, doing that fixed it for me, and hasn't been an issue since."

AppleWatch,3c556q,geeeeh,2,Sun Jul 5 01:01:53 2015 UTC,It has to do with having flash on. If you have flash on it only takes one shot. If not then it takes multiple.

AppleWatch,3c1cjn,Tastybread,5,Sat Jul 4 00:53:59 2015 UTC,"Plus Siri is just not fast enough for me anymore.  I hate having to focus on my watch to confirm a text was dictated correctly.  I said it before in an old submission, but we should have the option of a countdown-timer when using siri texts.  I should be able to say ""Hey siri tell john I'll be there in 30 minutes"", get a tap telling me it's been received, another tap telling me a 5 second countdown timer has started till it's sent (adjustable timer in settings).  This allows me to glance when siri is done working and creating the text, and allows me to CANCEL the text if it doesn't look good.    As of now we have to look down and stare at the fucking thing while it loads up, then hit a TINY box on the bottom right to send it, BUT you have to wait for the TINY box to turn fully blue or it won't click.  I've started pulling out my phone again for sending texts :("

Apps will get a huge improvement when Watch OS 2 comes out in a couple months and allows for native 3rd party apps. The reason they're so slow now is because they have to load from your phone.   And my battery life being good is only because I'm too afraid to use my watch more extensively than just glancing at it from time to time.   That's not true. I use my watch all day every day and I always have enough juice to get through the day. Don't be afraid to push the limits and see what your watch can really take. So what if it dies, then you'll know what the actual limit is, and your phone still works, so it's not like you'll be stranded."
AppleWatch,3c1cjn,johnthepaptest,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:55:09 2015 UTC,Come on. I love my watch but the battery is absolutely a weak point. When I first had it I couldn't stop fiddling with it which resulted in having it die well before my days were over. Having to put the watch into power save mode while I'm out with friends makes it practically useless. It's a disappointing crutch of the device.
AppleWatch,3c1cjn,Tastybread,4,Sat Jul 4 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"Your results seem at odds with mine and with most others who have the watch.

It will get scratched, it might get dented, and that's okay. The watch is as much a fashion product as it is a gadget, and it seems silly to cover your well-designed, beautiful fashion products with cheap, ugly pieces of plastic."
AppleWatch,3c4xh9,demonic_hampster,2,Sun Jul 5 01:54:54 2015 UTC,I like to use my watch. It has some scratches already. What's the point of one day having outdated tech that is in pristine condition? I bought it for the functionality and it'd be silly to let fear of tarnishing it prevent me front enjoying it.
AppleWatch,3c4xh9,z6joker9,2,Sat Jul 4 21:14:55 2015 UTC,Really? For real? This needed to be asked?
AppleWatch,3c4xh9,ibrownied,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"Is it Stainless Steel? If so, you could probably take some metal polish and buff it out. I would keep wearing it."

AppleWatch,3c38wh,IGotEm,2,Sat Jul 4 13:22:16 2015 UTC,"Quality is fantastic, similar to a Casio Edifice watch I have also. Order it from Amazon, £30 and it took about a week to arrive. Would highly recommend it although the tool that came with it isn't great for removing links so I just did it myself using a thin tool."

AppleWatch,3c5eia,macbookvirgin,2,Sat Jul 4 23:34:10 2015 UTC,Apple bands do not do this. Third party bands do. And I hate it.

AppleWatch,3c0ngm,Deedubau,0,Fri Jul 3 20:39:16 2015 UTC,I'm sure anyone who spent the money on it loves theirs but if you look on amazon you can at apple watch docks that look just as nice for less or even half this price.
AppleWatch,3c0ngm,bauertime,2,Fri Jul 3 22:49:18 2015 UTC,I love mine. I have the black version.

AppleWatch,3c093z,kewlfocus,3,Fri Jul 3 22:46:42 2015 UTC,How're you liking it quality wise? I've been on the fence but haven't made the plunge.
AppleWatch,3c093z,_f0xx,3,Fri Jul 3 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"The band is excellent, a lot more comfortable than the sport band, in my opinion. I was leery about the price tag of the band, but after trying it on, it feels like a premium product and I am very happy with it. I also feel like I have greater control over the tightness of the band, more so than with the sport band.  As for the watch itself, the Ion-X glass and aluminum body, in the two and a half weeks i've had it, have proven to be pretty durable. I've bumped into things. I've had dogs knock their claws into it. It still looks brand new."
AppleWatch,3c093z,Tluu89,2,Fri Jul 3 16:40:10 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, just got my band last night. Was on the fence about exchanging my sgs for the steel Apple watch, but after wearing it, I'm perfectly happy."
AppleWatch,3c093z,superjew1492,2,Fri Jul 3 18:12:16 2015 UTC,Yup I also agree the price at first scared me. But once you feel it in person you can feel the quality and it's worth every penny.

AppleWatch,3c093z,paulk355,3,Fri Jul 3 21:52:10 2015 UTC,I was thinking about doing the same but was turned off by the stainless steal loop at the end of the band. Can someone take a photo that shows how it looks on the wrist along with the aluminum body?  Thanks.

AppleWatch,3c3g3j,ssigrist,4,Sat Jul 4 11:42:08 2015 UTC,Used it to read the model number from the television - sort of used it as an upside down periscope rather than lift the TV and turn it around. Only time I've used it.
AppleWatch,3c3g3j,sionnach,3,Sat Jul 4 12:10:31 2015 UTC,duct tape my phone to my bumper....boom back up camera.
AppleWatch,3c3g3j,Dmw_,2,Sun Jul 5 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"My phone case is folio-style, so it can stand up on its own. I used the camera app once to take a picture of all of my friends and me whilst at a vineyard by setting it on the ground about 10ft away. It was pretty cool!"
AppleWatch,3c3g3j,TheyCallMeKP,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:00:52 2015 UTC,Quick and easy makeshift baby monitor for a few minutes. Now I use the Home by Withings.
AppleWatch,3c3g3j,CUNextThurs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:05:55 2015 UTC,Used it to take group photos to make sure everyone was in the shot.
AppleWatch,3c3g3j,IGotEm,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:17:41 2015 UTC,"Group selfie shot. Used it last night at a bar where it was pretty dark, so we needed flash. Pulled out the phone, opened the watch and boom. Perfect shot."
AppleWatch,3c3g3j,TheCarpetIsGreener,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:34:13 2015 UTC,"Literally just used it ten minutes ago to take a group 7/4 photo. Propped the phone on a shelf, hit the 3-second timer on the watch, and voila.  Perfectly framed shot, and no one left out."
AppleWatch,3c3g3j,geeeeh,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:54:17 2015 UTC,"Used it when I was running some wires through the wall, easier than taking a video, watching it, then figuring out where to push the wires."

AppleWatch,3c3g3j,RobSenner,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:00:24 2015 UTC,My rescue dog is terrified of cameras.  I've tried for 7 years to get good photos of her.  Not a problem now as the iPhone sits inconspicuously in the background and I can use the watch to get some lovely photos of us together.
AppleWatch,3c3g3j,ned78,-1,Sat Jul 11 12:28:12 2015 UTC,upskirts at the mall? :P
AppleWatch,3c2ogg,Rosydoodles,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:58:50 2015 UTC,"Aybe watch the apple videos showing the main features of the watch. I don’t use many third party apps so I can’t really comment on that. Th dodocase watch stand is my favourite, but at an overpriced $100 I am planing on just making my own"
AppleWatch,3c2ogg,BMANN2,2,Sat Jul 4 05:42:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I have actually watched the Apple videos, but I'll go and investigate the Dodocase stand, if I really like it then maybe I can get my Dad who is a carpenter to help me make something similar."
AppleWatch,3c2ogg,BMANN2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:11:30 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/ioynSkh  I asked my grandfather to make me one and got this today from him. It looks great I think (ignoring my ugly made in 1 minute Lego stand) and when my cousin cuts me a peice of steel to put at the bottom it will be great.
