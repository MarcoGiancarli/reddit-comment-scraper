She refuses to cooperate with me sometimes. She is hard to work with.      Plus, she has someone at 12am and later at midnight throwing walks at her window. Don't know who the perpetrator is but at 3am he will throw rocks at my girlfriend's window. Called the police and couldn't do anything about it.      Don't know if the hacker is the same person as the person throwing rocks at the window. The hacker also sends lyrics of from an old 1930 song ""I am following you. Where ever you gooo."" It has been sent to my girlfriend's email and my voicemail.      So this is not just a computer thing. It's beyond that.      Girlfriend spoke to police about the hacker and police said they cannot do anything yet because not enough evidence and because the hacker did not threaten us or physically hurt us. He is harassing us and don't know how that does not warrant action by the police.     Girlriend even had to take her phone to Verizon for investigation.

findareddit,3e4nn2,NearlyBaked,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:23:31 2015 UTC,"Well, if I were you I would try my best to get evidence against the person(s) harrasing you. Set up cameras outside your house to catch the rock thrower, change your phone numbers or if that's not something you'd want to do then try to use their harrasing calls as evidence. If you have any of the malware or anything they used to hack into your gf phone and Facebook then try sending that over to /r/reverseengineering to see if they can decrypt the source and maybe find the attackers IP or where the malware's data is being sent. Gather all the evidence you can off of your ""infected"" devices then wipe them to remove any malware that may be on them. Best thing to do after you get evidence is to make it harder for them to harrass you. Protect your devices so they won't be able to get into them and then block all paths that they can harrass you with like blacklisting their phone calls etc.   Finding their identity will be the best way to stop them, do you know anyone that you or your gf have pissed off? An ex? Someone that either of you have rejected that may want revenge? An angry neighbor?"

If you do have some reason to suspect your computer was compromised (maybe you downloaded something sketchy), there are steps you can take. A simple one would be running a malware scan (MalwareBytes is free and useful for this). Depending on how sophisticated the attacker is, though, it might not be wiped out with that and you may need to even wipe your hard drive.

findareddit,3dyynm,kitty-committee,3,Tue Jul 21 00:35:26 2015 UTC,Naw. I'm not sexually attracted to people but I like people around. The bigger and closer my pack is the better. It also works out so the other partners can bang and I can chill.
findareddit,3dyynm,kitty-committee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:35 2015 UTC,I gotcha. You keep doing you.
findareddit,3dyynm,JawnF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:29:49 2015 UTC,Serious question. How do you deal with intimacy being asexual? Do you feel your other partners are more close to each other due to sex?
findareddit,3dyynm,babydall1267,2,Tue Jul 21 04:04:05 2015 UTC,"When you have sexual partners it can feel like that at times. That they are closer cause they enjoy sharing that moment. But as long at the other parties understand that you need a different type of extra attention, it fills that need and eases worries.  Plus I still enjoy cuddling and dealing out territory marking (bites, hickeys) so knowing people are mine through a simple type of intimacy is still possible."

Seriously OP, STFU. OP already said waaaay too much as it sits. Speak with a attorney, only. Nobody else. And pray you and your friend don't have to learn the hard way why you must STFU."
