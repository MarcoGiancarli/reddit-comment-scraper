According to Corporal Buell of the ISP Fort Wayne Post at 2:02 p.m. Saturday, July 18, an email was sent to area law enforcement agencies with information on a suspect to ""Investigate for terrorist threats - threats of copy cat of Chattanooga ...,"" according to the email, which was posted to Facebook by the spouse of a recipient.  Nineteen-year-old Tanner Lee Harrington, who is listed as living in Fort Wayne according to his Facebook profile, was wanted for questioning by police for allegedly making terrorists threats. According to Buell, Harrington, a member of the Indiana of the Indiana National Guard, was initially reported as a missing person. Buell said Harrington's family stated he left a note in Arabic that it was believed stated he would commit an act similar to the attack on Chattanooga. The translation of the note has been determined, by the FBI according to Buell, to not make that direct statement. ""The FBI did say the information was written in Arabic, but it did not translate to that statement,"" Buell said.  As of 8 p.m. Saturday, Buell informed The Leader Enterprise that Harrington and his vehicle had been found. ""Right now they have found the car and him in Tennessee,"" he said. ""It looks like it is a kid that didn't want to show up for drill. ""This was initially investigated as a terrorist threat; however, the FBI has found that to be unfounded. It is being entered as a missing person in possession of a stolen vehicle charge."" The investigation into the incident is ongoing.

Images,3cnh8g,autowikibot,9,Thu Jul 9 08:06:21 2015 UTC,"1953 Iranian coup d'état:       The 1953 Iranian coup d'état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup, was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mosaddegh on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name 'Operation Boot') and the United States (under the name __TPAJAX* Project_).      Mossadegh had sought to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), a British corporation (now BP) and to change the terms of the company's access to Iranian petroleum reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament (Majlis) voted to nationalize the assets of the company and expel their representatives from the country.    Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad-Rezā Shāh Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran (Persian for an Iranian king),  to rule the country more firmly as monarch. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power until his own overthrow in February 1979.     In August 2013, 60 years after, the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) admitted that it was involved in both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda.   The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out ""under CIA direction"" and ""as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government.""   Iran's oil had been discovered and later controlled by the British-owned AIOC.  Popular discontent with the AIOC began in the late 1940s: a large segment of Iran's public and a number of politicians saw the company as exploitative and a central tool of continued British imperialism in Iran.   Despite Mosaddegh's popular support, the AIOC was unwilling to allow Iranian authorities to audit the company accounts or to renegotiate the terms of its access to Iranian petroleum. In 1951, Iran's petroleum industry was nationalized with near-unanimous support of the Majlis in a bill introduced by Mossadegh who led the Iranian nationalist party, the National Front. In response, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically.  Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott  while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government.  With a change to more conservative governments in both Britain and the United States, Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup.  Classified documents show that British intelligence officials played a pivotal role in initiating and planning the coup, and that the AIOC contributed $25,000 towards the expense of bribing officials.   Britain and the US selected General Zahedi to be the prime minister of a government that was to replace Mosaddegh's. Subsequently, a royal decree dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing Zahedi was drawn up by the coup plotters and signed by the Shah. The CIA had successfully pressured the weak monarch to participate in the coup, while bribing street thugs, clergy, politicians and Iranian army officers to take part in a propaganda campaign against Mosaddegh and his government.  At first the coup appeared to be a failure when, on the night of 15–16 August, Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri was arrested while attempting to arrest Mosaddegh. The Shah fled the country the next day. On 19 August, a pro-Shah mob paid by the CIA marched on Mosaddegh's residence.  According to the CIA's declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-Shah riots on 19 August. Other CIA-paid men were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks, and took over the streets of the city.  Between 300  and 800 people were killed because of the conflict.  Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah's military court. On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life.    Other Mosaddegh supporters were imprisoned, and several received the death penalty.   After the coup, the Shah ruled as an monarch for the next 26 years   while modernizing the country using oil revenues, until he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution in 1979.    The tangible benefits the United States reaped from overthrowing Iran's elected government included a share of Iran's oil wealth  [clarification needed] and ensuring the Iranian nation remained under the control of an allied dictator. Washington continually supplied arms to the increasingly unpopular Shah and the CIA-trained SAVAK, his repressive secret police force;  however by the 1979 revolution, his increasingly independent policies resulted in his effective abandonment by his American allies, hastening his downfall.  The coup is widely believed to have significantly contributed to anti-American and anti-British sentiment in Iran and in the Middle East. The 1979 revolution deposed the Shah and replaced the pro-Western monarchy with a largely anti-Western authoritarian theocracy.

Images,3b7ag5,WarriorBeard6,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:09:14 2015 UTC,"Stingrays are usually very docile and even playful like puppies.  About the only danger they ever pose is if you accidentally stepped on them.   I've been diving all over the Caribbean and never had any worry about them being curious.  The only real hazard a stingray ever presents is if they're accidentally stepped on.   They bury themselves into the sand to avoid detection with only their eyes visible and will sometimes hold still until the last second.     On one of my trips to Ambergris Caye, Belize my girlfriend and I were walking the beach and a fisherman was cutting and cleaning his fish on a wooden bench about five feet off the beach in the water.  You could wade out to ankle/calf deep water and stand near the fisherman as he tossed out the guts of his days catch.  There were a dozen large stingrays that would glide over your feet back and forth brushing against you waiting for the scraps.    Also many cruise lines and resorts have 'shark/ray encounters' which are just nurse sharks and stingrays that come in.   Rays in captivity may have their barb clipped but the 'wild' (habituated) rays are just resident freeloaders that like easy meals and are accustomed to people in their environment.  They're not clipped and rarely do you hear of an injury unless some dumbass reaches for a tail instead of just letting them glide around or over you."

Images,3aywy6,PostNationalism,4,Wed Jun 24 16:47:49 2015 UTC,"Notice the date o the quote.  1919.  Right after The Great War.  It was a period of time where people were disillusioned about their governments for the first time.  The scale of the First World War was bigger and more horriffic than anything that had come before it, and governments sent an entire generation of young men into the meat grinder.  Why?  Because they said so.  WW I had no ""good vs evil"" archetypes to it. Nobody was the good guy, nobody was the bad guy.  Officers ordered soldiers over the top to die in a storm of lead and poison gas in No Man's Land.  And they shot you if you didn't for ""cowardice"".  They went to war over national honor.  Is it worth coming home maimed, crippled?  Is it wort it to see your buddy bleed out next to you from shrapnel?  Is it worth national honor to spend four years making due with less and less at the home-front - to the point where your family is the thinnest you've ever seen anyone?  The First World War was hugely disillusioning to everyone.  It saw governments collapse under the strain of war.  And then afterwards, the people in power just carved up colonies and other empires and took the spoils like they always did.  The Ottoman Empire became what is now commonly called the Middle East.    Tzarist Russia collapsed and the Bolsheviks took over.  Germany ""didn't loose"" but was still forced to suffer huge reparations.  Even people at the time knew that the treaties at the end of the conflict weren't a solution, but just a temporary solution.  So yeah, cynicism and disillusion/disappointment with government were new and edgy things in 1919.  But common."

Images,3aj9kt,qbak,15,Sun Jun 21 01:05:43 2015 UTC,"Before we get further into this discussion, I'd like to say, up front, I'm not the one downvoting you.  While I don't think we'll change each other's position on the matter, I do welcome discussions with those that have views that are not the same as mine; I don't think downvoting encourages that type of back and forth.  So... with that...  I wouldn't say I have a love for guns.  I've owned a firearm for a few weeks, now.  I've been shooting four times in my entire life; all of them within the past few weeks.  While the hobby is actually fun/exciting (no bullshit...), it also makes me nervous, still.  The idea of it still causes me to stop and slow my rate of thinking; I respect my pistol more than the new circular saw my wife just got me for Father's Day, and that damn man tool intimidates me.  (Seriously, the thing is big and awesome, and I'm so in over my head with it...)  As I've said, I've only owned for a few weeks, however, I've been a vocal supporter of the 2A for a bit more than 20 years.  And here's why:  As a nation, America was born thanks to an armed, civilian populace willing to stand up to a government that did not hold truly represent it; in fact, that government was using the populace as an investment property rather than treating them like people.  Our nation's westward expansion was only possible because self-reliant people were able to defend themselves against both ill-meaning people and angry nature.  People were able to stake claims and take care of themselves thanks to the same tool.  However, at the core of the 2A isn't the right to self-defense (although, that is implicitly covered) and it isn't the right to hunt (again, implicitly covered) -- the core of the 2A is that America can only exist in its true and proper form if the government realizes the population it governs allow it.  The 2A puts into writing a right that our nation's founders understood already existed; that a people governed have the right to take up arms and take back their government when the need arises.  Thousands of men faced the best army in the world with beliefs like this in their heart.  We do them a great disservice every time we give up just a small portion of any of our rights, whether it be the 2A, the 1st, or the 4th.  TL;DR: I very recently got into shooting.  The 2A isn't just about a hobby, it is about the freedoms and rights that make America what it is."

Aside from that, I don't think about it. I don't see a reason to get another one, let alone a whole fucking arsenal. I think it's crazy that I was able to purchase a weapon capable of killing a large number of people in a short amount of time at the age of 18. I think it's crazy that I don't require a license to own this weapon,and I would be completely okay with being required to register this weapon. I feel like some people love guns way too much.

Yes, it's capable of being used as a weapon, but that is not their intended purpose. Guns are designed for the specific purpose of killing. But if you want to use the car analogy, then I propose we apply the same regulations to guns that we do with cars. Everyone who owns are uses one requires a license. They are required to pass a test to prove they know how to use it. They are required to renew their license every few years. If they move to a different state, then they are required to register for a new license in that state, and they are required to purchase insurance in case they accidentally hurt someone while operating it."

Images,3aj9kt,__pizza__,2,Sun Jun 21 17:16:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, that is exactly what was meant.    Not only had America just overthrown British rule with civilians armed with the normal tools of war for the time, there were plenty of more advanced guns than the musket already in existence.    The Belton Flintlock was offered to the Continental Congress in 1777 and could fire ""16 or 20"" balls in as little as 5 seconds.  The Girardoni air rifle was designed around 1779 and had a high-capacity magazine that could be fired in about 30 seconds.  (Bonus fact: Thomas Jefferson gave these to the Lewis and Clark Expedition.)  The Puckle gun was an early machine gun, really.  It was invented in 1718 and was capable of firing 11 rounds before reloading.  Even pepperbox revolvers were already popular around the time of ratification.  Letters of Marque were issued by President Madison in 1812 for private vessels to attack British ships.  These vessels were already armed with naval cannons that were privately purchased."
Images,3aj9kt,BanditMcDougal,-2,Sun Jun 21 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"Lol sorry, no. 2A says you can own firearms. Does not tell you which ones you can own and by what standards you must meet. We decide that. 2A does not dictate complete freedom to military hardware , nor should it.  Though frankly, I'm not sure why I care what 2A says, I think it's sortof obsolete anyway.

The Belton Flintlock was offered to the Continental Congress in 1777 and could fire ""16 or 20"" balls in as little as 5 seconds.  The Girardoni air rifle was designed around 1779 and had a high-capacity magazine that could be fired in about 30 seconds.  (Bonus fact: Thomas Jefferson gave these to the Lewis and Clark Expedition.)  The Puckle gun was an early machine gun, really.  It was invented in 1718 and was capable of firing 11 rounds before reloading.  Even pepperbox revolvers were already popular around the time of ratification.  Your argument supposes the founding fathers never anticipated weapon advancement of any kind; that they saw the musket as the military weapon of choice for... well, really forever.  The 2A does cover naval artillery, as well.  Letters of Marque were issued by President Madison in 1812 for private vessels to attack British ships.  These vessels were already armed with naval cannons that were privately purchased."

Mostly socioeconomic and mental health issues, which are both closely tied to gun violence and just violence in general. If we were to ban guns we'd end up in the same position as China and we'd have mass stabbings/beatings/arsons instead. Guns don't kill people, the mentally ill and disenfranchised kill people. How can we help them to feel like they don't need to kill or engage in other violent and antisocial behaviors? That's the question we should be asking. How can we help each other to live happy, healthy lives where no one ever needs to use a gun for anything more than putting holes in paper?"

Large swathes of our society still see mental health issues as taboo which prevents a lot of people seeking help and treatment. We will never be able to effectively treat all mental health problems anyway but the fact that people here can't readily get access to guns means that we only very rarely have mass murders of innocent civilians.

Gun control has had almost nothing to do with any of that because most of the gun control legislation that has been enacted happened well after the decline started.  The media, however, is capable of reacting faster and faster to violent happenings, therefore we actually see more of them, even though the trend has fallen, because fear sells newspapers."

It'll just mean they are the ones still getting guns, not law abiding citizens that don't go around being crazy.    Only if you obtusely think that ""gun regulations"" only entail barriers to purchase and not stricter punishment for misuse or illegal acquisition. Fact is, there are a ton of sensible gun laws that could be enforced, that are also 2nd amendment friendly, but the rubes and fear mongers can't be bothered to hear any of it because declining gun sales are an affront to a major political lobby and ideology in this country.   Aside from all of this, the Imperfect Solution Fallacy states that it is not logical to assert that a flawed solution is as bad as no solution at all. To say that any further gun regulations would never work because of any remote possible effect on responsible gun owners is in fact a logically flawed argument. Almost every major shooting since Columbine has been done with legally acquired guns.

I don't want to shoot anyone. I could, if I absolutely had to, I think, but I don't know for certain, and I don't want to find out. If cops could be wherever trouble was GOING to be, they could end violence with their presence in most cases. But they can't.  So I carry a gun. If someone attacked me, I can't get my phone out fast enough to dial 911, talk to a dispatcher, and wait for the police before I get hurt and/or killed.

Your response to the ""taking guns away"" statement presumed that, either OP meant ""from everyone"", or that no regulatory middle ground exists between everyone having access to guns and no one having access to guns."
Images,3aj9kt,kurlythemonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:59:48 2015 UTC,"I did presumed from everyone. Any other implication seems irrational. If not from everyone, then who do you ""take guns away"" from? Is there a selected group of people that legally own guns that should not legally own them? How is this group of people selected to own or not to own them? Is there another way to take away guns that do not include a ""ban"" of some kind?  You are splitting hairs here."
Images,3aj9kt,EricSchC1fr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"I did presumed from everyone.   Well, literally no one else made you look at this like an absolutist. Why are you criticizing others for looking at this issue in a less binary fashion than you are?   Any other implication seems irrational.    Not really. Every other right is legally conditional, based on who's exercising it, where and when. Yelling ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater isn't protected by the 1st Amendment. Private property used in a crime isn't protected under the 4th Amendment. There's no new trials for prisoners committing crimes while in jail, despite what the 6th Amendment says.  For the same reasons those rights are sometimes restricted, there's no logical reason under the sun that guns should be available to everyone, all of the time. Gun ownership is just about the only right that is conditionalized arbitrarily by state government laws that do not consistently consider user statistics, probability studies and personal review of each buyer/user. The fact that, in some states, an ex-criminal on probation can more easily purchase a gun from a gun show or private seller than they can vote, is not a logical exposition of human rights.   If not from everyone, then who do you ""take guns away"" from? Is there a selected group of people that legally own guns that should not legally own them? How is this group of people selected to own or not to own them? Is there another way to take away guns that do not include a ""ban"" of some kind?    I'm sure you realize these are questions that cannot be definitively answered by me or the average redditor, with only a basic understanding of Constitutional Law. Having said that, standardizing certain components of gun regulations, like background checks, strict penalties for use of a gun in a crime, strict penalties for providing/selling a gun in absence of a background check, strict penalties for providing/selling a gun to a criminal or persons with mental health history, etc., can do a lot to mitigate criminal use without affecting gun owners who play by the rules. Surely, legal experts can think of this issue in a more comprehensive and fair manner than I can, off the top of my head. However, it is not proponents of fair and minimally-invasive regulations that throw a temper tantrum and shut down any open, honest and logical discussion at first mention of the word ""regulations"", when several reputable polls show most Americans in favor of nationally standardizing such common sense regulations. Its only water-carriers for the NRA and the under-informed who are looking at gun regulation as an all or nothing proposition, and it simply does not have to be that way at all.   You are splitting hairs here.   I absolutely am, and with good reason. Don't be afraid of a little nuance, here. In order to effectively and fairly govern 300 million people, hair-splitting is more than a little necessary, most of the time."

The damage that a single airplane can cause once it is hijacked with a shoebomb is far greater than your average idiot with a gun.    Please, what statistics? More Americans die from gun deaths in any one year since 2001 than all acts of terrorism in every year since 2001.    Meanwhile the odds of being targeted by a messed up shooter are astronomically small compared to the risk of encountering a security threat on an airplane.   This can't possibly be true without my first stat is incorrect, and it isn't. Additionally, acts of terrorism with guns in the U.S. far outnumber acts of terrorism with bombs or vehicles in the U.S. by an insanely wide margin."

That is correct but you can not at all just look at someone and say oh arrest him he looks mentally ill. There would be bus loads of people going to prison every single day if that were the case.  The only thing we can do is take away the tools that they use to do these things.  Inmates in prison are not allowed to have shoe laces because they may hang themselves with them. This applies to everybody. They do not send everybody to a shrink day in and day out to see who should get laces and who shouldnt they just take the laces away. Problem solved.

They literally have the same safety precautions for bombs and guns.  That is a piss poor example for trying to push regulations.
