philadelphia,3e47kn,vampiricrogu3,11,Tue Jul 21 20:48:19 2015 UTC,Philadelphia's crumbling infastructure is going to create an interesting time in the years to come... Think of how old this city is: many of the lines laid down must be going on 100 or 100+ years old. I wonder how they plan on handling it. I've seen so many sinkholes and water main issues over the past few years.
philadelphia,3e47kn,P64,3,Tue Jul 21 22:15:25 2015 UTC,"I wonder how they plan on handling it   The plan is to replace 1% per year at current funding levels. So by the time they are done, the stuff they put in today will be 100 years old.  40% of all water coming out of the water plants never reaches the faucets. It goes into the ground because of all the leaks. This is spread out between everyone's water bill of course."
philadelphia,3e47kn,MoniMoniMoni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:54 2015 UTC,Part of my job involves looking at old utility maps. A lot of the sewer maps are from the mid-1800's.

philadelphia,3e2pr4,jimmyandjanie,6,Tue Jul 21 14:37:25 2015 UTC,"Is it a big deal, no, is it still frustrating, and a part of a larger lack of customer service appreciation on Septa's behalf, yes.  You shouldn't have to complain, it's a valid point and Septa should have altered the price."
philadelphia,3e2pr4,reefdogg7,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:26 2015 UTC,"Yes they most definitely  should modify the rate. Septa is going to make a guaranteed $3.5mil of non refundable money in two days.

philadelphia,3e376r,puskas14,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:48 2015 UTC,"The real issue here outside the bigger social implications is this isn't a private, non-religious school. It accepts both a smaller tuition than a private boys or girls school and also government money.   If this were a school like Haverford Boys where it's all tuition-based, they could basically do whatever they want. But this administration here can't have it both ways.   Apparently the school knew for a long time she was gay and no one really cared. It's upsetting that some parents can suddenly get a teacher who was pretty well respected it seems fired."
philadelphia,3e376r,lardbiscuits,0,Tue Jul 21 20:46:13 2015 UTC,"This is on the school for hiring the teacher in the first place, if they knew they would hold her to a higher standard than all of the other teachers who routinely violate Catholic teaching.  This is on the teacher for having the audacity to think that her choices would not present a conflict of interest for any administration hiring her as a Catholic theology teacher. Theology of the body is literally the first thing you hear about when you try to get married in a Catholic Church."

Do you disagree with my definition of ""cult""? it's not mine, complain to Merriam Webster if you think it should mean something else.  Or do you disagree with the ""strange and sinister"" ...now I'll grant you that strange is a matter of perspective, but sinister is easily backed up by factual review of history."
philadelphia,3dy9ay,kitcat_kittycat,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:50 2015 UTC,"Here is a slightly more in-depth explanation of cults. The issue with your definition is that you're picking and choosing whatever you want from Christianity to define it as a cult. As I said, you are making the assertion that 2.4 billion people think exactly the same way, believe exactly the same things, and are all part of a cult. Who is the charismatic leader dictating beliefs to all these people, by the way? If a fundamental aspect of a cult is to tear you away from non-cult members, what do you make of Christians who are friends, lovers, family, even married to people from other religions, agnostics, and atheists?  If cults seek to impose absolute control over its members, what do you make of the fact that there are approximately fifteen million Protestant denominations because they're constantly disagreeing with each other and constantly splitting off to go do their own thing?  Christianity means a lot of extremely different things to many people. Some Christians think the Earth is only 6000 years old and was literally created in 6, 24-hour days. Others take the view that a ""day"" is relative, an infinite being has no concept of time, and point out the order of creation roughly follows the pattern of the Big Bang and evolution and see God as someone who set the process off. Both people would say they're Christians. When you have diametrically opposed opinions like that you are not anywhere approaching a cult.   As for ""strange and sinister""--yes, strange and sinister shit has happened in the name of Christianity. But you can't use what inquisitors in Spain did in the Middle Ages and to define Quaker Abolitionists in the US in the pre-Civil War period. You can't claim that a gay Episcopalian bishop in New Hampshire is responsible for an Eastern Orthodox congregation in Ukraine who expels a gay member. It's patently ridiculous. Strange and sinister shit has happened in the name of religion, science, nationality, race, a whole host of things.   There are absolutely individual Christian groups, whole congregations and even some denominations who on their own classify as cults. Any group focused around a strong central belief system with a charismatic, manipulative leader can head towards cult status, though religion in general does make it easier to establish. That's one of the reasons if you type in ""What is a cult"" you'll get a whole bunch of results from religious organizations (many of them Christian, actually) listing the warning signs of a cult.   I'm going to guess that you or someone you know has had a personal, very bad experience with some Christians who were small-minded, conservative assholes. Now you're using the beliefs of those Christians to define all Christians. Hey, the guys you encountered may very well be a cult. But defining all Christians as a cult based on your personal experience with that one group makes about as much sense as claiming all men are cheats because you have a guy friend who cheated once, or all people with black hair like carrots because a friend of yours with black hair likes carrots."
philadelphia,3dy9ay,phillyXX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:07:25 2015 UTC,"I like how you change and alter the definition of a cult so it fits other groups not yours. The article you linked to is someone's idea of a cult., what I gave you was the actual definition. No bad experiences here, so no need to delve into my motivations as I'll share them with you: As a logical thinking person in 2015 it saddens me to see people who still believe fairy tales from the Dark Ages. I believe individually people are smarter than that, but that in a group that intelligence falls away to ignorance and superstition and it's long past time we evolve beyond that. Fortunately the trend is in that direction, but it is excruciatingly slow."
philadelphia,3dy9ay,kitcat_kittycat,0,Tue Jul 21 14:35:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't change the definition, I gave you a link to a more thorough academic overview of how cults are identified. It includes links and references to people who have actually studied cults for a living. I'm gonna guess you're being purposely obtuse with your claim that Merriam-Webster is the end-all, be-all of cult identification. I mean, if we are are limiting ourselves to Merriam-Webster definitions, then a person who lives alone in a house is not actually living in a house because a house is ""a structure or building where a family lives"" or ""a shelter where animals are kept"".  Not to mention you're getting Christinanity to fit that definition of a cult by picking and choosing only the denominations and parts of history that fit it into that box. Disingenuous much?  As I've already explained, Christianity is an incredibly diverse religion and pretty loosely defined if the disagreements between its followers are any indication. Lumping everyone who identifies as Christian into ""cult"" requires a particular level of oversimplification that can only be employed by a person who is not so much interested in a nuanced discussion as they are at winning an perceived argument. You're too emotional about this issue to really discuss it rationally so I'm bowing out."

Their texts make themselves kind of look like idiots through the entire chronicle. Yea, self-indulgent scammers of the millennium there! The christian story is like a fucking textbook on sincerity and self-sacrifice. It takes some Fox News level willful ignorance to make that false equivalency. Can you name one organization with an even starker contrast between the founders of scientology and christianity? Whether you believe the teachings or not you'd be hard pressed to find a group of people more selfless and non-interested in wealth accumulation than them (the buddha is another less dramatic example). But it's much easier to not actually think for yourself about it and just jump on the Reddit religion overkill bandwagon.

I based my statement off of the fact that we have no PROOF that some sort of devine hand wrote the bible. That would mean that some dude wrote it and guess what, dudes have been tellin stories since time began.... I'm not saying that all servants of a religion are scumbags or scam artists because some people are just genuinely good, without having to be forced by a religion. But lets instead look at all the people that are preyed upon by people in positions of power within any religion. At the end of the day religion is an organization that is full of members that will believe anything if they feel that prize at the end is worth it enough. That is prime territory for those in the position of power to take advantage of their ""herd"". So yeah, I think religion is a scam. You buy into the idea that being a faithful servant is your ticket into a paradise we don't know exists. If being a good person is important to you, just be good... Do we always need the threat of our boss looking over our shoulder to do a good job? Millions flock to religion for salvation... often times the money that is offered up or labor that is donated is from the fellow congregation not the leaders coffers. For all they we might as well just be nice to each other and offer our help on the side and save a little money not lining big religions pockets."

Scientology is designed from the beginning to take from others.  Religions all offer something.  Even at the top religions the leaders believe in what they preach for the most part.

He should be publicly hanged though, for the economic damage he caused over the decades."

philadelphia,3dymka,RobPeterPayPaul,10,Mon Jul 20 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"If there a single recording or text message from Dougherty ordering or authorizing these tactics, I would less likely to think that you are a crazy man for saying that.   Authorizing? He is not some mob Godfather figure here, he himself was convicted of the charge of arson, among many other things.   Former Philadelphia Ironworkers Local 401 boss Joseph Dougherty was sentenced on Monday to serve 19 years in prison and pay $558,000 in restitution, six months after a federal jury found the 73-year-old guilty of a racketeering, conspiracy, multiple counts of arson and extortion.   You clearly didn't read a single word of the article, or know anything about the case.   FBI agents gained access to cellphone records and text messages and tapped the phones of the union's Northeast Philadelphia headquarters, as well as the cellphones of high-level union ""business agents"". ""It was a union that was run through criminal activity, that's how it was operated,"" Livermore said following the verdict. ""On a weekly basis, if not a daily basis, they talked about committing crimes, committing extortion, things of that nature."""
philadelphia,3dymka,MoniMoniMoni,-9,Mon Jul 20 18:20:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, he was convicted based on the testimony of other people, all of whom have long standing grudges against him. The FBI agent uses the term ""they"" but he actually doesn't have any physical evidence against Dougherty. It was the business agents doing the arson and running the extortion, and those business agents were rivals of Dougherty's.   Your quotes don't actually show any evidence of Dougherty's involvement."
philadelphia,3dymka,RobPeterPayPaul,8,Mon Jul 20 19:57:17 2015 UTC,"I guess we now know which r/Philly member is a union member.  They caught the thug red handed. Dougherty is a dinosaur that didn't understand that TXTs are not anonymous. Plenty of hard evidence of his involvement and mastermind role.   Sarina Rose, a vice president at Post Bros. Apartments, endured almost siege-like conditions as her company resisted ironworker threats while building the Goldtex Apartments at 12th and Wood Streets, just north of Chinatown. Union members stood outside the construction site berating employees, blocking trucks, and vandalizing property. After work, tradesmen snapped photos of her children, ages 8 and 11, at their bus stop in Abington. They trailed her at weekend sporting events. One union leader loudly cursed at her in front of a packed restaurant and mimicked shooting her."
philadelphia,3dymka,MoniMoniMoni,-7,Mon Jul 20 20:43:30 2015 UTC,"Again, not specifically related to Dougherty and the hard evidence is of the business agents involvement.  I'm not saying Dougherty is innocent, what I am saying is that his sentence compared to that of the business agents that were actually ordered the vast majority of this stuff is absurd.   I don't know if Dougherty knew and approved of this, but the evidence at the trial seems to suggest that he was not involved in the day to day business of extorting and harassing people. In fact, the lead people doing the extorting and harassing where two business agents with ambitions to dethrone him as boss. These people, when the Feds came calling, provided nearly all of the evidence against him. You don't have to be a union member (I'm not) to see how that's a little bit fishy."
philadelphia,3dymka,RobPeterPayPaul,6,Mon Jul 20 21:02:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Dougherty knew and approved of this   The jury heard the witnesses, listened to wire taps and phone texts. They found him guilty of being the mastermind behind the whole operation, beyond any reasonable doubt. It's not a question of him being lightly involved, he was the mastermind, the leader, and personally threatened non-union people on tape."
philadelphia,3dymka,MoniMoniMoni,-5,Mon Jul 20 22:47:44 2015 UTC,"Juries are wrong sometimes. They trusted the testimony of people who confessed to arson, extortion, and worse. There is only one tape of Joe Doc, and the threat there was not explicit.   A lot of the time, juries reject these type of arguments. That was certainly the case in the mafia trial of Joe Ligambi and the trial of the six police officers accused of selling drugs.   As I said before, the word of the guys who were actual certified members of THUGS is what got Dougherty convicted. Saying he should be publicly hanged is a bit much for me."
philadelphia,3dymka,RobPeterPayPaul,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. Very stiff sentence considering there is no hard evidence linking him to the crime. Dougherty is an old man, this seems to be a bit much."

Dizengoff delivers via Caviar; meals there are pretty healthy and balanced, should have fairly broad appeal, $9 to $11. (Of course, if you want something less healthy, FedNuts delivers, too.)  If you are looking to take people out, you've got tons of options in Chinatown. Sakura Mandarin, Nan Zhou, Dim Sum Garden, Red Kings II if people like spicy stuff - all good choices, all on the same block, all very easy to keep in your price range, especially because you'll likely be eating family-style at any of them.  In South Philly, maybe Blue Corn or Plaza Garibaldi (Mexican), Nam Phuong or Lee's Cafe (both Vietnamese, the latter is a sandwich shop downstairs with only like 2 seats but there's a dining room and more extensive menu upstairs). Lots of other places near Nam Phuong too if Southeast Asian appeals...

The used to keep the cars in various garages because they didn't have a place to keep them all together. He would do tours by appointment and take you all over the city to the garages.  I like the museum, but ultimately, you pay to see a rich guy's toy collection. And if you go on the demonstration days, you pay to watch him play with them.   If he did community outreach, had a clinic to teach kids from the nearby neighborhoods how to work on cars, appreciate them, etc., I would be more inclined to go often. But ultimately, you're paying admission to see one dude's  ~$100M worth of cars you'll never have a chance of owning or driving."

philadelphia,3dyo5m,fetamorphasis,2,Tue Jul 21 00:19:39 2015 UTC,My thought has always been that it probably doesn't matter much where on the east coast it's released.

philadelphia,3dyje1,zebrade,12,Mon Jul 20 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"So if you look around the station, like near the teller, you will find kiosk machines that sell tokens (not all stations have them). The minimum purchase is two tokens or $3.60. The teller must have been messing with you.  You can also buy tokens in stores such as some pharmacies, grocers, and convenient stores. You don't pay cash while on the train unless it's regional rail or if it's the weekend night train (I don't know how that train works exactly.) You pay cash to the teller. The barriers to the BSL train only accepts passes and tokens, never cash, and remember that if you're going from BSL to the Market Frankford Line and vice versa, you don't have to pay again."

philadelphia,3dyje1,get-off-my-jawn,3,Mon Jul 20 17:52:28 2015 UTC,"First, the person in the booth was lying to you for one reason or another.  Second, not all booths sell tokens. Some stations will have two booths, one will be open the entire time the station is open. This is the booth that does NOT sell tokens or give change. The other booth will probably close at 6, and may sell tokens, and give change for token sales, but not for fares. You can usually identify that booth, because they'll have an piece of paper with token prices taped in the window and it will be the one that has no one in it when you need to get tokens quickly. AFAIK, there's no official signage indicating which is which."

philadelphia,3dxypy,catjuggler,-2,Mon Jul 20 14:26:57 2015 UTC,"All of SEPTA's pass pricing are based on 5 days of commuting. Using it for 6 or 7 is a courtesy they extend to customers that use it.  Example: A single Zone 2 ticket is $3.75 at the ticket window. For a monthly pass, it's $135, which is $15 in savings if you only use it for 1 round trip 5 days a week. If you use it more, you're riding on SEPTA's dime.  Why would SEPTA refund money you're actually saving?  EDIT: Zone 2 ticket is actually $4.75/trip"
philadelphia,3dxypy,unctracc,5,Mon Jul 20 14:45:16 2015 UTC,"All of SEPTA's pass pricing are based on 5 days of commuting. Using it for 6 or 7 is a courtesy they extend to customers that use it.   Is there a source for this or is it just something you're making up?  There is more use to SEPTA than commuting.  They price based on commuting for marketing reasons and because it is helpful to them to sell passes rather than taking so many individual tickets.  Also, you are forgetting that you can buy tickets in packs of 10 for a discount already.  Additionally, the weekly transpass does not pay for itself in 10 trips alone, so that logic is flawed."
philadelphia,3dxypy,catjuggler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"Source: their webiste  I know that is specifically for city riders (not RR) because the fares are different to calculate for a round trip.  But, really, the math isn't hard and you're being dense.  RR fare schedule Zone 2: $4.75/trip = $190/month for 1 round trip/day $55 savings Zone 3: $5.75 = $230/month for 1 round trip/day $67 savings Zone 4: $6.50 = $260/month for 1 round trip/day $69 saving  EDIT: These are for 1 round trip/day for 5 days (typical work week).  EDIT 2:     Also, you are forgetting that you can buy tickets in packs of 10 for a discount already. Additionally, the weekly transpass does not pay for itself in 10 trips alone, so that logic is flawed.   The 10 trip pack saves $2.50 for Zone 2 ($45 compared to $47.50), a weekly Zone 2 is $36.50, which is $11 in savings.  I don't understand your argument."
philadelphia,3dxypy,unctracc,5,Mon Jul 20 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not being dense- I'm saying that it may work out as ""well, I need 5 days of train riding, so I might as well end up with 2 days for free"" is not the same as SEPTA saying ""your weekly pass is for the work week, but because we're nice we'll let you use it on the weekend too.""  And as I said, the weekly transpass (the one for just staying within the city) does not pay for itself in 10 rides.  A ride is 2.25 and the pass is 24/week.  Also, I don't see why it would matter if it pays for itself relative to individual passes already.  If someone told you they would give you 10 apples for $5 when they usually cost 75c each and you planned your budget and meals around that, would you not be annoyed if they said ""actually, this month we're selling 2 of your apples to someone else, but we're still going to charge you $5. We're also still going to call it a 10 apple pack, you just don't get two of them."""
philadelphia,3dxypy,catjuggler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"The city passes are valid the weekend the Pope is here. And, SEPTA clearly lays out what's cost effective for those riders on their website based on cash fare, tokes, and transfers."

philadelphia,3dxypy,unctracc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure of how Septa sets the prices for their passes, but the weekly transpass ($24) is a fantastic deal for someone who doesn't really venture outside of the city during the week and visits friends in the suburbs on weekends. You're basically paying for four one-way train rides that you can use on Saturday and Sunday, and getting the city transit for free for the whole week."

I don't know why I was downvoted above, because it says  that right on their website. If you take 2 (or more) vehicles EACH way, it saves money to buy a weekly (more if you buy a monthly) - for transpasses (not trailpasses). Still, trailpasses are a savings for anyone using it M-F.  I don't know many people that have a transpass for city travel & then use it regularly on the weekend for Regional. I used to a few times here & there, but not all that often."

Your train,"" to which PATCO regulars added, ""You're late for work.""  Also, don't cut it close when making your train. Because of the one-way nature of the commute, PATCO riders have no notion of courtesy. Riders leaving the trains crowd the poorly designed fare gates, and take the stairways wall to wall.

You just submit your statement and evidence and then a few weeks later you get your judgement in the mail. I just got out of one of these by pointing out that I live two doors from a corner store(people drop trash as they leave the store) and that the ticket came while I was at work so i never had a chance to clean the litter before I got the ticket. I would also report it to 311 so they can actually send someone to clean it.

In the time it took me to run inside my first floor apt and back outside, 2 men were already wheeling it down the street and around the corner and a third was running an extension cord out of their house to plug it in and see if it worked. Literally all within the span of 2 minutes. I caught up with them and they were immediately on the defensive, but then I gave them the remote and got a round of high fives."

It took me a month to do all of Regional Rail, end-to-end, granted I wanted to film all of it so I waited for good weather and was only on during the daytime. You can get all of 69th Street (minus busses) and subway and el in one day easily, especially now with the 24-hour service on the weekend. Trolleys and busses are where you should expect to spend the most time. Summer is also the worst time to try the trolleys as it's when SEPTA likes to do rail work... but that could make for some good opportunities if you want to see how the network runs when diverted.  With regards to passes, keep in mind Regional Rail has its own pass. A weekly pass for everything else is $24, or the cost of two one-day Indie Passes."

philadelphia,3dvf6k,AnAmericanPrayer,14,Mon Jul 20 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"I used to swim here all the time before I moved out of the area. On a typical day the people who frequent this spot, despite their skin color and 'prison' tattoos are just people looking to beat the heat. Of the dozens of times I've been there, I've never had a problem with anyone. Beyond that, they do some crazy shit off those rocks into the water. On more then one occasion I've seen a few brave individuals ascend the aqueduct bridge that runs over the swimming hole. I've been up there and it looks like a glass of water from that height. While it's a fun and refreshing spot on a hot day the danger is palpable.  A couple years ago I went with a friend on the Fourth of July. He brought a long a friend of his, a heavy set Asian girl, whom I had just met that day. There is one side that you jump from which requires no skill and little effort. You simply walk up to he edge and plunge into the water, which is ice cold btw. We'll call this the novice side. Opposite that is another small 'cliff'. This side requires a running start, as you have to clear a rocky ledge to wind up in the water safely, on what are often slippery rocks that make up a precarious runway. Well, the Asian girl decides she wants to try to jump from the 'technical' side. I watched with horrified astonishment as she prepared herself, our mutual friend making half hearted attempts to talk her out of it. I knew in my heart that it was not possible for this to end well, but I also knew she was going to try, I did not want to inject doubt into her mind. I just met her that day. Who am I to tell this girl what she can and cannot do?   She got a running start and managed to avoid slipping as she approached the edge. The dozen or so people there fell completely silent in anticipation of an outcome no one could definitively imagine. Her fatal mistake came when she tried to use the solid rock ledge as if it were a spring board and not an immovable slab of earth. Approaching the edge she jumped, once, twice, and over. Everyone watched helplessly as it was immediately obvious that she had not jumped nearly far enough and would certainly not clear the jagged rocks below. There was a dull and unsettling thud as her legs smashed into the ledge below, and she tumbled into the icy water. My friend who was waiting in the pool below, in anticipation of just such an occurrence, took her hastily to more shallow water. There we discovered she had obviously shattered her ankle, as it was apparent that the bones beneath the skin were completely decimated and the foot hung limply by the dermis.   Witnessing a rescue effort in a place like this, it becomes immediately apparent why there is a redundancy of no swimming signs, and makes you wonder why they are not more strictly enforced. Getting this girl out of there required the efforts of no less than 7 various rescue vehicles, and took at least an hour from the time 911 was dialed to the time she was loaded into the ambulance. After assessing the situation a 'bucket' was brought down to carry her the 1/4-1/2 mile up the bank to Livezy Ln. Had this been a head trauma, there would be little chance of survival. I haven't been back since."

The Philadelphia Department of Public Health states that swimming and wading is not permitted due to risks of drowning, injury from submerged objects, strong currents, and other hazards. In the past, swimmers at Devil’s Pool have drowned or suffered a permanent disability.  Swimming in Philadelphia creeks and rivers is also a serious health hazard. About 90% of the flow in the Wissahickon contains wastewater (treated sewage). People and animals risk bacterial and viral disease by swimming or wading in the Wissahickon Creek.

What I can give you, is a recommendation based on a similar situation.   I use Foreign Fix Auto in S. Philly for all of my repair needs, and found myself in a similar situation with an old Jeep. Had a small hole/leak in the exhaust pipe, other shops wanted me to replace the whole system for about $800.   The guys at Foreign cut out the section with the leak, welded in a new section of pipe, charged me $75, and I passed inspection.   So, if you're looking for a reliable shop that you can be honest with and say ""I'm just looking to get this passed"", Foreign Fix Auto will help you to do the most simple and necessary repairs."

Here's the venue's FAQ page: http://festivalpierphilly.com/faqs/  If you're worried about sightlines or being up close, I'm short (for a dude) and my advice is: when you walk in you'll be stage right (stage right being the right side of the stage as a performer looking out into the audience). Don't immediately just try going to the stage. Do a giant loop so that you go around the entire crowd to get to the other side of the stage. I usually have pretty good luck getting damn close without too much trouble.   If you wanna be further back, head to the sound booth in the center of it all. There's usually a vendor to stage left and so there aren't really people in front of you for a good 20 feet so you'll be able to see pretty well."

When I was there a couple weekends ago they had a bottled water fill station to the right of the stage - not sure if that's a permanent fixture or not. Also a recent ""improvement' was to fill a lot of the venue with sand, so that it didn't seem so much like ""Festival Parking Lot"" - neat, but plan your footwear accordingly.   Food lines can suck and the selections are not great. Eating before isn't a bad idea. MFL is very close and safe, a little dingy right when you get off at Spring Garden stop.

philadelphia,3dyq3k,sensible_human,3,Mon Jul 20 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"In my experience, Philly streets are the best I've experienced in a major city. The reason for that is that they are narrow. Narrow streets force cars to drive more slowly, and they also mean it doesn't take long to cross the street. Also, because the streets are narrow, intersections are more frequent. This all makes our city incredibly walkable and dense, as well as makes our streets very safe for people walking and biking."

philadelphia,3dyq3k,sensible_human,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:21 2015 UTC,"I find Philly is easier to drive than a lot of other major cities, too. Since most streets are one lane, that controls traffic levels (more lanes invites more traffic). You don't have to cut across lanes to make a turn. And since the city is so dense, hardly anything is far away.   That being said, I really couldn't care less how easy it is to drive in Philly. I would prefer it to be more difficult!

philadelphia,3dtrhp,rubiredd,5,Sun Jul 19 12:44:10 2015 UTC,"I went through an Italian phrasebook with my grandmother once when I was planning to visit Italy, and she kept telling me the book was wrong. It is interesting how much the dialects have diverged."
philadelphia,3dtrhp,jimmyrocks,5,Sun Jul 19 13:06:01 2015 UTC,"My aunt says that there is ""Italian"", which everyone learns in school, and then different dialects for each area, which are spoken at home.  She says the really old people don't even know the standard Italian a lot of times, and that the dialects of say Milan and Sicily are so different as to be mutually incomprehensible.  Plus because the dialects aren't really standardized, they've probably changed a lot since the bulk of Italian immigrants came here."
philadelphia,3dtrhp,rubiredd,4,Sun Jul 19 13:21:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not a historian, but I believe modern italian is based on the Tuscan dialect and it has only been taught across all of italy since the 1920s. So the immigrants from southern italy would have not had much exposure to it."
philadelphia,3dtrhp,jimmyrocks,3,Sun Jul 19 13:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yes it is Tuscan, and it was actually because of Dante's Inferno hundreds of years ago, the book was so popular, coupled with the dominance of florence, it standardized florentine dialect across all of Italy.  Standard Italian has been taught for some time, but something like 90% of Italians are technically classified as bilingual because dialects are considered distinct languages.  Today they are bilingual speaking dialect at home, and Italian professionally.  The older generations who never had exposure to people outside their home/town only speak dialect and likely learned English more than standard italian."
philadelphia,3dtrhp,aliph,2,Sun Jul 19 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"It was probably even more recently than that, like the 50s or 60s.   Actually early television is what helped spread a uniform Italian dialect. There needed to be something that everyone would understand."

Because there's a lot of different bars depending on your area, I usually make my way over to Cooperage every Thursday night for weekly /r/philadelphia meetups and an extended happy hour they give us.  I live over in UC, and I like the Local 44 because they have a big tap list. I'm not certain if Copa Banana counts as a bar, but they have awesome margarita deals and the best spanish fries around. Cavanaugh's off 39th has alright food, but a poor tap list. Lots of bottles to carry out though, it's an okay eat-in sports bar. The City Tap House on Walnut between 39th and 40th is awesome, they have a great tap list, pizzas, drinks, quizzo, and chicken & waffles that're worth the carbs. Also, their 10 Spice Wings are amazing.  Also, Bobby's Burger Palace is right next to City Tap House, and they have amazing burgers and adult milkshakes. I have yet to try Distrito though, they're some sort of fusion tex-mex spot that's more for show than for tell.

philadelphia,3dq9at,Liesmith,3,Sat Jul 18 16:06:41 2015 UTC,If you have to rent from a commercial kitchen it's not a cottage thing. The whole point of cottage business is that they are run out of your home. It's legal to do that in PA but Philly apparently has strict rules on top of that making it hard to do. Particularly zoning I hear is very strict.
philadelphia,3dq9at,Liesmith,2,Sat Jul 18 16:58:41 2015 UTC,Ah. Hmm...I think there are some like BBQ sauce and maybe jerky people in r/entrepreneur or r/startup that have successfully started stuff that might be of some help.

philadelphia,3dq9at,catjuggler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:28 2015 UTC,To run something out of your home? You're correct in your assumption. It is very expensive to start a food business renting out commercial space. If your product can be made out of your home you save lots of money operating the business from there as well.
philadelphia,3dq9at,singe-ruse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:21 2015 UTC,It doesn't have to be expensive to rent out a commercial space to make a batch.
philadelphia,3dq9at,nerolt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:16 2015 UTC,It just depends on your margins. I'm starting off roasting in small quantities until I build an audience. I'm trying to structure it so I don't loose money even at a small scale. If I'm paying $100/ roasting session and I do that four times a month that's a lot more expensive then my kitchen which is free.   For instance the Philly Enterprise Center rents out their kitchen for culinary enterprises. It's $100/ year and then $30/ hour. That a lot of money if you're just starting out!
philadelphia,3dq9at,Mister__Crowley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:31 2015 UTC,Yes but you're really paying for the convenience of not having to deal with the health dept etc. Most home kitchens would not pass the health code. It really comes down to the cost of renting a commercial kitchen vs the cost of remodeling your home to meet code.
philadelphia,3dq9at,superfunatparties,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:45 2015 UTC,"True - but the cost of convenience is one my tiny business can not afford right now. Trying to keep it lean.

philadelphia,3dq9at,nerolt,3,Tue Jul 21 14:55:37 2015 UTC,"Whatever you've read before is correct. I don't know specifics, but the city zoning board is never happy with someone running a commercial business out of their home, unless there's serious tax money involved. It's certainly ""doable"", but it's going to involve a lot of paperwork/bureaucracy that may still eventually lead to the city saying ""No.""  You might actually be better off buying a truck or cart and licensing that instead."

philadelphia,3dsaxk,SteveWynn,5,Sun Jul 19 14:13:14 2015 UTC,Because based on statistics and personal experience prodomanatly black neighborhoods in Philadelphia suffer from gang violence and drug addiction issues.. Also I volunteered at the horse stable near chamonix mansion and that's what's the kids there talked about... Any community building in poor neighborhoods have positive outcomes. I'm not late I'm from Philly and riding horses beats finding ducky spots when bullets start flying.

I worked for a Live Action Role Playing camp that did it summer sessions at chamonix and because it was right next door I got involved with the stables for a short time. I loved it but totally don't trust horses so I decided it was best to stick with larping. The kids at the stable always talked about their older family members and how they were involved with shady shit. Also as a larper it was mad cool to have them dress up with us and play the parts of knights and such (from a far of course because the horses also didn't trust us)

philadelphia,3diwu3,IndianaPwn3s,11,Tue Jul 21 05:03:22 2015 UTC,There are so many streets that are in awful condition and it seems the city's new hobby is to tear up streets that are fine in order to make them equal to the crappy streets. I guess it's cheaper to ruin the few nice streets for a more uniform look. Like N 20th through spring garden and Francisville... they just tore it up and haven't repaved
philadelphia,3diwu3,TheTwoOneFive,8,Thu Jul 16 21:51:22 2015 UTC,"Repaving comes through about 3-4 weeks after the tearup, not entirely sure why it happens that way, but if they tore it up it should be repaved by this time next month."
philadelphia,3diwu3,jhc1415,2,Fri Jul 17 13:22:56 2015 UTC,Why not tear it up right before you pave it? Some of these roads are straight up dangerous now. The manholes are sticking out. I'm wondering how many people have gotten flat tires or bent rims because of it.
philadelphia,3diwu3,Jawn_Valjorts,16,Thu Jul 16 17:26:36 2015 UTC,All the utilities and companies that have services running underground have to come out and inspect the manholes before they repave the streets.

philadelphia,3diwu3,Mimehunter,4,Thu Jul 16 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"No, that's basically true - you have different crews doing the work. You contract one to tear up these roads on these days, and contract another to pave them on others. That's of course extremely simplified - there's a ton of coordination that goes into it. But yes, it all basically falls down to cost and time.  (used to be a roadway inspector for the state)"
philadelphia,3diwu3,catjuggler,2,Fri Jul 17 05:48:13 2015 UTC,They probably have shitty project managers who can't arrange people effectively in multiple departments on multiple jobs.
philadelphia,3diwu3,Jawn_Valjorts,8,Thu Jul 16 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"Nope, that's exactly not why it happens. it's because they have to call in PECO, PGW, PDW, Comcast, Verizon, and probably a few other independent entities to check the manholes before they repave."
philadelphia,3diwu3,Mimehunter,0,Thu Jul 16 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"That's one-calls job - but yes, someone has to check with them"
philadelphia,3diwu3,Jawn_Valjorts,4,Thu Jul 16 18:07:53 2015 UTC,One-call just marks where utility lines are for future construction. The individual utilities have to inspect their own manholes during the repaving process to make sure they weren't damaged or don't need replacing before the streets are repaved.
philadelphia,3diwu3,Mimehunter,3,Thu Jul 16 18:32:48 2015 UTC,Don't they make contact too to inform them of the need for inspection? (been a while since I've worked in the industry)

Most of the popups you see around the city are in the name of PHS (Philadelphia Horticultural Society) but use the liquor license of nearby restaurants.   What beers do they serve?    Varies by location. They tend to lean towards lighter more summer-y beers, but some locations have a quite large selection.   Do you pay to enter?    Depends. Some charge an entrance fee, some suggest a donation, some are completely free.   Can you bring your own    Nope. Very illegal.   or is there a gated entrance and guard?

philadelphia,3dkzn2,SteveWynn,4,Fri Jul 17 12:08:15 2015 UTC,"No he's not. And here's why:  Kenyetta Jonson is only supporting anti-gentrification efforts and being slow on the zoning variances to keep the area classified as ""blighted"" by PA's criteria for how funding and grant money is funneled for said blighted area. Point Breeze is blighted in two ways: Business Disvestment and Real Estate Disvestment.  It's clear that Point Breeze is not blighted in the real estate divestment, but if that was to audited and reassesed as non-blighted would also mean less money from the various blight reversal programs. He, Claudia, and TnT are all in cahoots together and controlling where tax-payer money is going. Claudia has her hands in the zoning and the public RCO angle, KEnyetta is the council insider, and TnT stir up the uneducated local population to rally a vocal minority to appeal and hold up all efforts to improve the area.  The zoning variances needed for Point Breeze's commercial corridor revitalization can be accomplished, but they need to have the Councilman to have true interest in making Point Breeze into a nice, updated areas with amenities, business, and real estate that would grow the tax-base and create associations who would actually produce results.  That's why Ori was such a threat to Kenyetta's and his associates scheme. Look at where the money does and does not go and to whom and whom not it goes. You'll see dubious activity for sure."

So I guess we should take this as a punishment that if you collapse buildings in particular then that lot will be taken off the market?  It's also not a good park, when the residential tower gets built beside it are they going to include it in their brochure ?

It works to create a sense of belonging with the consumer. You see the ad and have this ""Hey, I'm here. doing that thing that they advertise is good. I'm doing/having that good thing. I'm making good choices""  It's self validation, that you are choosing a good product which rubs off on the brand/store/product."

Molten lead was poured through screens at the top of the tower; the coarseness of the screen determined the size of the shot. As the pellets of hot lead fell, they cooled and hardened into pellets and finally cooled in vats of water at the base of the tower. The shot then was screened, polished, sorted, and packed in the main building.""  http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SP-Shot-Tower.jpg  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparks_Shot_Tower  http://www.workshopoftheworld.com/south_phila/sparks.html"

philadelphia,3dkzkn,SteampunkOtter,6,Fri Jul 17 03:01:13 2015 UTC,"For those of you reporting vastly worse speeds than advertised, I hate to be that guy, but it may likely not be Comcast but:  A) Your router and how you set it up and/or B) Your perception of the results from a speedtest  Protips: For A)    Always check your speed with an ethernet cable directly out of the modem. This will help rule out the ISP as the culprit. If your speed is as advertised directly out of the modem then it is a wifi/router issue. Login to your router via routerlogin.net for Netgear  or ""192.168.1.1"" for linksys. Make sure to change your 2.4ghz channel to anything but 1, 6, or 11. (use a wifi analyzer app via your play store to see all wifi channels in range of you, choose the channel with the least amount of competition). Additionally if your router supports 5ghz band then definitely use that since it has less competition for bandwidth and provides faster speeds.  Move your router, this will effect the signal strength. A wifi analyzer app (there is one simply called 'Wifi Analyzer' which is free and pretty nice) can tell you the signal strength. Other 2.4ghz devices, such as radios, baby monitors, antenna, other wifi routers can cause disruptions among each other. Use an N-Series or A/C series router. Make sure it is dual band 2.4ghz and 5ghz. 5ghz is the future! Put wifi hungry devices on the 5ghz band and then internet browsing and phones on the 2.4ghz band. Check the QoS setting and any multimedia settings under that tab. You typically want to use these because they will allow multimedia such as games, netflix and other streaming apps to reserve bandwidth priority. You can even add apps, MAC addresses of your devices to the priority list and gain extra bandwidth.* Make sure you have a password on your router, sometimes people dont and that allows others to tap in and use your bandwidth. Power cycle the router and modem, sometimes when a device leaves range it creates a discrepancy in the router that may give other devices issues.   For B) If you are using a multimedia setting that prioritizes multimedia then your speedtest.net result, which may not receive multimedia priority, may vary because it isn't necessarily being prioritized as would your streaming apps or games. It could be that the low number reflects the partitioned bandwidth that your router is set to prioritize and you may in fact be getting that '105' but you are perceiving the results incorrectly.*   And lastly, if you have a few people running 2-3 devices on your router then it may create a serious drain on the bandwidth, which will also mess with your results.  I have the blast package from Comcast clocking in at 105mbps down/ 10mbps up. Out of the modem we clock 120mbps down. So I can not really fault Comcast when my speedtest is reporting 40-50mbps with 4 roommates, 5 phones, 5 laptops, xbox running hbo go, and 2 gaming PCs. If I adjust my settings to not prioritize apps then I get about 90mbps from my wifi.  Just google this stuff and quit blaming the ISP so much"

philadelphia,3dkzkn,Slugged,2,Fri Jul 17 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to add that if you're having trouble getting the speeds you pay for Google the model number of your modem to make sure it can handle the speeds. Not all modems can handle 105mbps. When I upgraded my speed the modem Comcast had given me couldn't handle those speeds, so I returned it and bought one on Amazon. Which brings me to my next point: buy your own modem. Seriously, it'll pay for itself in 6 months."

Using comcast, whatever their top package was.  Had to buy my own modem though. They apparently don't have dual band modems, even though they'll give you a modem and claim it's the right one. The ones they had weren't capable of going one third of the speed I'm currently getting.  As for this speed in general, it's kind of a waste of cash. I don't play video games, so while I feel pretty boss torrenting, there's no need for it. It's definitely over the point where it's the speed of whatever server I'm requesting is what determines the delay, which is out of my hands.  I'd go with something economical unless you plan to game or torrent constantly."

The first and plainest need of these people is a recognition of their actual status and by this I mean their status as Jews.... Refusal to recognize the Jews as such has the effect, in this situation, of closing one's eyes to their former and more barbaric persecution.   Earl G. Harrison in his Intergovernmental Commission on Refugees report to Harry Truman, 1945  if they are not given a homeland to call safe in a world that mostly still distrusts them, then they really don't have anything. this mission has been co-opted by US imperial interests in the Muslim world but the mission is still of moral importance."

The proposal never allows the Palestinians to control their own borders, doesn't give them full water rights. The settlement of Ariel is built on top of the Palestinian aquifer. They don't control their own airspace. They don't get to raise an army. No Israeli who's been prime minister during the peace process has ever supported giving the Palestinians any substantial part of East Jerusalem. No one in the current Israeli government does. And the Israelis want the Jordan Valley as well, which is where all the arable land is in the West Bank.   So it's finished. There never will be two states. There never has been a proposal for it. There never has been a real peace process. And in my opinion, the peace process ended when the right-wing terrorist Stern gang assassinated Count Folke Bernadotte in Jerusalem, who was dispatched by the United Nations during the Nakba, during Israel's project of ethnic cleansing in 1948, to try to prevent the Palestinian refugees from leaving and bring those who had left back. His assassination ensured that that would never happen. And since then, there's never been a proposal to bring them back in order to preserve Israel's ethnocracy. They can't do that. In fact, the peace process is an effort to consolidate the exclusion of millions of Palestinians from not just their ancestral homeland, but from a place where they have legal titles and where they hold property.”  Max Blumenthal"

Your time is valuable, and walking for 3 hours starting at 3am to 30th street is just a waste of fucking time/sleep/resources.  Think about the sleep you'll lose, and also think about the money you'll ""save"" by walking it.    Instead of taking a $10 cab at a decent hour of the morning with plenty of rest on your side, You've essentially decided to value your life at $3.33 per hour + fatigue & sleepiness instead.

There is the cost of food also. It takes energy to walk long distances. A lot of energy.  It takes about 10 calories of energy to put 1 calories of food into your mouth.

The Department of Licenses and Inspections is a cesspool of incompetence, ignorance, indifference, and bureaucratic bullshit.  We frequently have to wait 30+ days beyond the deadline for any communication, much less a decision.  Many plan examiners simply do not answer their phone or email, ever.   Do you have your examiner's name?  If not, call L&I and ask them for it.  After that, email and call the examiner directly.  I wouldn't expect a response before 3 emails and calls.  You should also be prepared for the possibility that no one at L&I will have any knowledge of your project, as if your application had simply disappeared into thin air. Most employees at L&I hold the belief that fulfilling the most basic requirements of their jobs is an excruciating burden, and they will not be pleasant with you.

Did you apply for zoning and building permits at the same time?  If you only applied for a building permit, maybe they are waiting for the zoning permit.

philadelphia,3ddsu7,hskelly,13,Wed Jul 15 14:13:51 2015 UTC,"When you change your electricity supplier, PECO will still be your contact for power outages, service issues and emergencies.  PECO will still distribute the power to you, and PECO will still be the company you pay every month.  When you change to an alternative supplier, you are choosing which company generates your electricity.  It is nice because there are now choices and some competition that can save people a bit of money.  On the flip side, it is bad because it is one more thing that people have to keep tabs on and it opens the door for some of these electricity suppliers to take advantage of the consumer.  Within the last four years, I've made complaints to the PA Utility Commission about 5 different companies.  Two for my personal account and three for my business.  I highly suggest you shop around.  If you see a good rate, go for it.  Just make sure you document everything.  Keep copies of any contracts, agreements, confirmation pages, correspondence, etc.  Keep tabs on your rates monthly and ensure you are getting what you agreed to.  If there are any additional fees on your bill that you did not agree to, contact the company immediately.  If they fail to take action, file a complaint with PECO and with the PA Utility Commission.  If you have a contract length, pay attention to when this is ending and set an alert to remind you to shop around for new rates a few months before this expires.  If you can not find a better rate than what PECO is offering (this is always written in the ""Message Center"" section of your bill), switch back to using PECO as your supplier.  The customer charge and distribution charge will not change, as these come from PECO.  The generation plus transmission charges are what is in question here.  So, on your current bill, $0.005 plus $0.077 = $0.082 dollars, or 8.2 cents per kWh.  If you choose another supplier, the rate of those two lines will change (and likely be merged into one line item).  I suggest you start at [PA Power Switch](www.papowerswitch.com) to look at what your options are.  Put your zip code into the box and hit ""Go"".  Then, click ""see full results"".  You'll be met with a list of different suppliers.  Some will be offering fixed rates, some will offer variable rates.  Be very careful with variable rates!  They will normally quote you an unbelievably low introductory rate.  Then, a few months later, they will start to slam you with much higher rates.  I've had this experience a few times, and have talked to friends and family who has also had this issue.  Last winter, a family member of mine received a few bills that were nearly two times PECOs rate after receiving two months of very low introductory rates.  This is my personal opinion, but I do not believe that a variable rate is a smart decision to make, as you have no control over what they will charge you from month to month.  You could argue that PECOs rates are variable, but they also don't gouge their customers.  They also only change their rates every three months and give you a heads-up on what your rate is going to be.  My advice would be to go with a fixed rate plan that beats PECOs rate.  I normally try to lock into a 12-month term, but go with what you are comfortable with.  I've gone with 6-month terms before, I've gone with 18-month terms.  Take a look at any early cancellation fees (would be applied if you decided to switch to another provider before your term is up).  I've never cancelled early, but if electricity rates drop significantly and I am stuck in a contract for another year, it could be worth it to cancel early and pay that fee.  This would be rare, as rates would have to drop very low very quickly.  Ensure you look into any monthly fees that the company wants to charge you, as I've seen a few in the past that have tried to slip a $5.95 monthly fee into their contract.  I normally avoid the companies that charge a monthly fee, but if you want to see if it is worth it, do the math.  Take your average kWh (just estimate it) and multiply it by PECOs rate.  Then, take the price that the third party company is offering you and do the same.  Then, add in any monthly fees from the third party supplier.  Compare these two numbers.  I normally find that even with a lower kWh rate offered, a monthly fee will normally make their plan more expensive than staying with PECO.  When you have decided on a third party supplier, go to that company's website and sign up.  Remember to read and save any documentation they give you.  Don't just click ""I Agree"" without viewing and saving the PDF with your contract terms.  Make sure the contract terms match the rates of the PA Power Switch website, including fixed vs variable, contract length, cancellation fee, monthly fee.  I live in the suburbs, so I am not sure if people in Philadelphia can do the following yet.  If you have natural gas service at your home, head on over to [PA Gas Switch](www.pagasswitch.com) and do the same thing for them.  If you can find good fixed rate that beat's your gas company, go for it.  If not, stay with them."

But in the year I spent working on solutions for an inflated monthly electric bill, I found some legitimate money savers.  Long story short, unplug EVERYTHING you can.  Microwave, washer/dryer, cell phone chargers, you name it.  I kept literally everything in my house unplugged besides my refrigerator and power strip with TV/modem/cable box hooked up.  Once I started this habit I found it impossible to go back.  You'd be shocked to see how much electricity some seemingly benign things require."

philadelphia,3ddsu7,jgur88,3,Wed Jul 15 19:17:34 2015 UTC,"Lived in a house that was broken into two units.  I lived on the bottom floor which had the basement, and contained the water heaters for both units.  At some point, the upstairs neighbors moved out and the place was empty for three months.  In that time my electric bill dropped DRAMATICALLY.  I'm talking on average $75 plus a month.  I need to mention that this was my first apartment living alone, and my first experience dealing with PECO.  So $100 and up a month for more than five years seemed normal to me, as I didn't know any better.  So anyhow, when I saw the free fall that was my monthly bill, and then it shoot back up when new tenants moved in, I requested a service check with PECO.  As it happened, the upstairs water heater was electric and had been plugged into my box for the entirety of my stay.  Service was immediately placed in the name of the property owner, and PECO estimated I was owed - by the landlord - anywhere from $4000-$7000 in backed overpayment.  How I got the money back is another story for another day."

philadelphia,3d9nyo,minnick27,2,Tue Jul 14 20:55:15 2015 UTC,They wouldn't rip it with a hydrant wrench.  They'd use a fireman's axe. Much more effective.

philadelphia,3d9nyo,dj_blueshift,8,Tue Jul 14 17:21:40 2015 UTC,constant fresh cooling water   Umm no. It is stale unsanitary water.  That's why you sometimes see the PFD flushing the system. The water does not move in those pipes sometimes for more than a year.
philadelphia,3d9nyo,drxdrg08,20,Tue Jul 14 17:45:15 2015 UTC,Not in that neighborhood.  The hydrants are open on every corner on just about every hot day.  By this time of year that water is fresh
philadelphia,3d9nyo,silastitus,14,Tue Jul 14 18:01:54 2015 UTC,"No you are totally wrong for so many reasons. Water just doesn't go stale in the pipes when that location is in the middle of an entire distribution system. Flushing dead ends of the system is to remove stale water which is not the case here. Primarily, flushing is to remove the small amount of materials that collect in the pipes over the course of the year. PWD produces 250 million gallons of water per day. With that amount of production there has to be enough usage for high turnover rates in the pipes. Go down to page 17. High water age contributes to the production of disinfectant by products (see here for more information) and you can see that water age does not appear to have any significant effect on disinfectant byproducts, chlorine residual, or bacteria presence.   In summary, the water in your pipes is used by everyone around you and it should not be going ""stale."" Not moving for more than year is wrong. It likely is completely new water every few minutes.   If you want more information, I'd be happy to answer any questions I can."
philadelphia,3d9nyo,ii386,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:46:39 2015 UTC,Should I still run my water for 10-20 seconds before drinking it?
philadelphia,3d9nyo,Prancemaster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:30:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, but only if the tap hasn't been used in a few hours. This is due to the potential for lead and copper leaching into the water. The longer the water sits in contact with premise plumbing, the more leeching occurs. PWD does use anti-corrosion measures but it is still a good idea.   Edit: to be clear, you should flush as long as it takes for the water temp to stabilize, which may be longer than 20 seconds. This ensures the water is coming from the main"
philadelphia,3d9nyo,ii386,5,Wed Jul 15 16:16:28 2015 UTC,"I meant fresh as in the pool water is constantly ""freshened"" by the inflow of more water from the hydrant."

philadelphia,3d97ly,phillybeardo,6,Tue Jul 14 17:45:55 2015 UTC,I went to a school around there. Bullet holes in the windows when we moved into the new building. 10/10 would live in hood again.
philadelphia,3d97ly,IndianaPwn3s,2,Tue Jul 14 16:32:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, Haddonfield.  I went to Hebrew school a few blocks north of there (60th and Vine) when I was a kid. From about 94-97. Definitely is the hood now, not too sure if there ever was a ""heyday"" for this particular area."
philadelphia,3d97ly,BKachur,3,Wed Jul 15 08:10:39 2015 UTC,Did the El cause this hood or was the hood ok for awhile while the el was there?  All this elevated transportation makes for so many blocks that no one wants to live on
philadelphia,3d97ly,GroJLart,3,Tue Jul 14 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"The old chicken or the egg eh?   I think the El was the nail in the coffin, the neighborhood wasn't the greatest from what I've heard but no one wants to life next to/underneath a loud ass train at all hours so it devaluated the housing and drove out anyone with money, thus turning it into the hood."
philadelphia,3d97ly,acesilver1,8,Tue Jul 14 17:46:12 2015 UTC,"About 90% of the construction surrounding the EL in that area was built there BECAUSE OF the El. Before the El, there was a small little village of country estates around 61st/Larchwood but that's about it. I believe one of the houses still stands at 61s/Cedar.   The rest was shanty towns etc before John McClatchy (developer of all the housing around 61s-63rd st and D.F. McConnell (king of the ""Modern Porch House"", the ones you see all over West Philly with the single bay window and porch) built up all those blocks because of the promise and the construction of the EL, claiming you could get to your job in what we now call Center City in 15 minutes.   The area was seen as a serene a country-like alternative to the harsh factory smokestacks and tightly-packed Mark III and IV rowhouses in North and South Philly. It was a pretty nice neighborhood-- lots of civic engagement-- they even tried to ban alcoholic establishments and dance halls from opening west of 50th st, stuff like that. The school at 52nd/Pine was seen as one of the best in the district and the Misercordia Hospital (now Mercy) was seen as a great facility. Both are now shitty.   It all started going to shit when there became such a thing as interstate highways, suburbs, and the new Airlite hoods in the Northeast- the housing became functionally obsolete but it held out pretty long after other hoods-- didn't get Type D status from mortgage lenders until a whole generation after North and South Philly. Even after that it lasted a pretty long time as a Polish/Jewish lower middle class area- much of the housing stock is owned by the families that lived there at that time, collecting rent from the current generation of residents.  Cartoonist R. Crumb grew up there, Mayor Nutter grew up at 55th/Larchwood.  Nowadays, the area has a lot of crime at night but is more or less pretty safe during the day-- the small blocks between the major streets are where all the crime happens. They call DeLancey St ""D-Block"" over there. There are gangs centered around 56th and 61st Sts."
philadelphia,3d97ly,repptar92,3,Wed Jul 15 23:41:05 2015 UTC,"Never understood why they didn't keep it underground for its entire track. Surely it could have been possible, right?"
philadelphia,3d97ly,MrHorseWithNoName,7,Tue Jul 14 17:57:28 2015 UTC,Raised track is much cheaper
philadelphia,3d97ly,repptar92,4,Tue Jul 14 19:22:26 2015 UTC,And the fact that much of the city outside of Center City is built on filled in creek beds.
philadelphia,3d97ly,MrHorseWithNoName,5,Wed Jul 15 00:16:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, from my knowledge of my hometown's subway in DC, the most important consideration as far as medium into which you are building is the depth of the bedrock. The subway must be built into bedrock, and DC's bedrock can be much further from the ground. As a result, a couple of our stations are 100' or more underground. Philly's bedrock is close to the surface in much of the city, which enables the shallow stations as well as the construction of skyscrapers, a trait Philly shares with midtown and downtown Manhattan. This is just my layman's understanding, hopefully I am not delusional."
philadelphia,3d97ly,GroJLart,2,Wed Jul 15 00:57:34 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I was going by anecdotal knowledge because of a large amount of neighborhoods in Philly slowly sinking.
philadelphia,3d97ly,grumpyglinch,2,Wed Jul 15 02:20:11 2015 UTC,You are partially correct. The El went above ground starting at 23rd st until about 1953 and then was buried up to 43rd or so. They meant to bury the whole thing but a large buried creek at 45th or 46th was in the way and the expense was seen as too great-- especially to serve a neighborhood that was beginning to decline.
philadelphia,3d97ly,gibbons_iyf,5,Wed Jul 15 23:44:25 2015 UTC,"Your kidding right?  You do know why its called The El?  As in ELEVATED.  It was all above ground until the made the subway for the part running through center city.  That neighborhood was nice for a long time after the train.  The downfall was economic, not the noise from the choo choo."

philadelphia,3dc4y3,dozendeadroses,8,Wed Jul 15 03:46:08 2015 UTC,Calling 311 on your brand new neighbors.  This is why Philly hates us suburban immigrants  Try talking to them first. You're going to live next to them for a while
philadelphia,3dc4y3,sensible_human,6,Wed Jul 15 10:04:53 2015 UTC,"Putting an unauthorized trash can outside is illegal. Calling 311 is exactly what you are supposed to do.  Also, 311 is anonymous, so OP doesn't have to worry about retaliation from the neighbors, who seem to be nonexistent and may not notice the trash can is missing anyway."
philadelphia,3dc4y3,dozendeadroses,2,Wed Jul 15 14:28:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah. So the trashcan that has been there for 3 years gets a call the week the new neighbors move in.  The entire block could hear about the asshole that called the city on the poor old lady. $50 fine. Cool.  Or you could be an adult and knock on the door.  Oh yeah and maybe the street has a trash problem? Maybe all that trash would be on the ground otherwise. Work with the neighbors. Get a nicer can with a lid, away from the door. Take turns changing the bag with your new friends. Good job"
philadelphia,3dc4y3,sensible_human,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:03:51 2015 UTC,"You can't get a public city trash can that way though. You have to call 311 if you want the city to install a trash can regardless.  I think doing exactly what you're supposed to do in this situation (call 311 anonymously) is what the city wants and expects you to do and is the best way to avoid confrontation. Besides, it's a big city, not a suburb - the ""new neighbors"" could be thousands of different people.  And again, it seems like the neighbors aren't even there. If it's been neglected for years, it's time to get the city to do its duty. Removing the trash can is the city's responsibility in the first place.   Work with the neighbors. Get a nicer can with a lid, away from the door. Take turns changing the bag with your new friends. Good job   You can do this but you still have to go through the city to get it approved. In that case you need to have a block captain and the block captain has to agree to maintain it, and the city has to know it exists."

These include police brutality and criminal-justice reform.   What?   It was March 6, 1990, when she sat in a Center City courtroom and heard a judge - future District Attorney Lynne Abraham - say that her son Kerry Marshall would spend the rest of his life in prison, with no chance of parole, for the murder he was convicted of carrying out when he was 17. Since then, Vickers' eldest son died at age 33 of complications from drug abuse, while her third son is currently imprisoned for what she described as drug-related offenses.   Seems like the problem is not police brutality, but her sons using drugs, selling drugs, and murdering people."

These are factors that you seem to ignore because you think there's America, where whites live, and then blacks are on the outliers, when that's not the case.  A married family unit is not uncommon in Black culture, but there are some Americans, regardless of race/ethnicity, who have opted out of marriage. Applying this to sub-saharan African culture does not apply because these are vastly different groups of people. Not to mention that African cultures have a vast array of religions, both colonial and traditional.  If you are trying to apply white Christian values as a foundation to your argument, you're a joke."

The guy murdered someone, and for that reason alone he deserves to be in prison, but unless he spent a good bit of time planning it... no parole and life at 17 is fucked up. Back in the 1990's people wanted this no-bullshit, once-and-done kind of justice. But now we're realizing that prisons are now incubators for better criminals and if we really want things to get better, we need make sure they're not locked away forever and, instead, get actual help.  Just as importantly, if you have a brother in jail for murder who will never be freed, you might get messed up, too, when you see your entire family start to fall apart from it.   Mind you, none of this excuses the actual decisions people make, but its still messed up and puts it into some context.  TL:DR; We need to do more where we help people get back into society instead of locking them away forever, or we're going to have a bigger problem."

Even with super present parents who don't have to work multiple jobs your parents are only with you for a few hours a day of your adolescent life. Meanwhile all of your friends are dropping out of school, and found a way to make money pretty quickly. It's high risk but the alternative is to stay in school and work towards... what, maybe being a janitor, working at McDonald's? In those schools if you aren't the valedictorian good luck trying to go to college.   Sure anyone could just not commit a crime, but can you really say that there is nothing we can do as a society to improve the situation? And nothing about our current society that causes young black men to disproportionately end up with ruined lives?"

How do you change their way of thinking?   And if you think that janitorial jobs at McDonalds are the only jobs for poor people, I've got news for you. I grew up in Frankford, with my Grandmother and my 2 aunts. We all lived in the same house, with my aunts' children. We got welfare, my grandmother's Social Security and the pension from my deceased grandfather and WIC. My father and mother were basically MIA (my mother left when I was 4, my father, well, that's another story altogether). My freshman year at Frankford started with over 1000 students. The graduating class was a little over 300.   I'm proof that you can come from a poor family and make a living on your own WITHOUT having to be a janitor at McDonalds. But you have to WORK. I knew my grades weren't good enough to get me into a decent college with a scholarship. I made the choice to join the Business Academy in Frankford, which ended up getting me a job working for Corestates Bank when I was 16. It was a menial gopher job, but it got my foot in the door."

I know it's expensive but there are methods to pay for it.

philadelphia,3d8w7l,InfinitelyThirsting,-6,Tue Jul 14 13:49:07 2015 UTC,"This has a lot to do with why I think family values are extremely important still. And I'm not talking about marriage should be between one man and one woman. I'm talking about a child needing two parents, man and woman, man and man, woman and woman, idc, but there needs to be two in order to support the family and stop this from happening. A lot of times, the fathers walk out, that is a black man putting himself before the family, or even worse, the father ends up in jail for a drug charge, which I agree, it's stupid.  This is an unfortunate truth, especially in Philadelphia, but you don't need to have extracurriculars in school in order to do them. There are many things you can do you the community that a college would value the same, if not more, than extracurriculars. Volunteer after school at a homeless shelter or community center, get a part-time job for after school. All of these things are recognized by colleges. This has two great outcomes: colleges will see what you're doing and it'll help you get admitted and also you're helping your community by being active. This part, I agree, is wrong. A marijuana charge when someone is a teenager shouldn't have an effect on them for the rest of their life. Society is getting there, but not fast enough. The attitude is changing and hopefully we see that effect sooner rather than later.   I'm not making excuses for the way things are, it is unfair, but sitting there complaining about it isn't changing anything. Not by you, I mean by people that are put into these situations, regardless of race.

philadelphia,3daiiy,De4con,5,Wed Jul 15 15:09:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's me. And if you can show me how to pop a wheelie on a scooter I'll eat my hat."

philadelphia,3daiiy,De4con,4,Wed Jul 15 15:28:17 2015 UTC,"I commute to University City on a scooter from Fishtown. I think it's great fun, but parking can be tricky and you won't want to ride in the winter or in the rain. The very first time I rode my scooter to work I got a $75 ticket for parking it next to a bike rack. There are a couple spots around that seem pretty safe for free parking and a couple spots for metered scooter parking, but don't get the idea that parking will be easy for you with a scooter. Parking in CC is a pain in the ass too. Rain sucks. I'm perfectly happy to ride my bike in the rain, but I don't feel safe on my scooter. Those big metal plates that the city uses to cover holes in the streets during construction get very slick and you never know when you're going to encounter one.   So... if you work or go to school at Penn, you can park your scooter in front of the archeology museum for free and walk from there. If you have a bunch of friends scattered around South Philly and you like the idea of being able to zip around down there, parking in front of row homes, it'll be good for that, and it's always fun to offer rides to friends who don't mind clutching you while fearing for their lives.  If you want a convenient and cheap way to commute year-round, a scooter isn't very good for that. Ride your bike when the weather's nice and pay for Septa when it's not."
philadelphia,3daiiy,blue_delicious,2,Tue Jul 14 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"I got a $75 ticket for parking it next to a bike rack   Also on that note, please don't ride your scooter in any bike lanes.  It's not safe for anyone.  Not saying you would, but some people seem to get confused about it."

Look into getting spot at a covered garage near where your commute takes you, should cost no more than $125 per month.

I had never been to Ippolito's before and it was fantastic overall. But I honestly didn't care for these. They were way too greasy and I got almost no fish taste. The sauce was absolutely great though.   The best thing is that they have a special right now - $3 for a fried oyster Po Boy. It was incredible. I paid less than $4.50 for an oyster po boy, more crispy fish jawns than I could possibly eat, and a drink."
philadelphia,3d939g,jglusk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:49:21 2015 UTC,"I have yet to get a greasy one; the belly cut (which they are using) is more fat than anything - resulting in a really tasty item.

White June 24, 2013  “Consumers love freebies. But the companies handing out complimentary donuts, comic books, ice cream, pancakes, and Slurpees love giveaways even more. On the surface, freebies look like obvious money losers. But when handled wisely, giveaways are all but guaranteed to boost sales.”  “Last week, Procter & Gamble hosted an enormous giveaway in New York City. Throughout Manhattan, company representatives handed out more than 40,000 products from P&G brands such as Gillette, Duracell, Scope, Febreze, Pampers, and Cover Girl. Simply getting these products into the hands of consumers is something of a success: After all, every person who tries out one of these products has the potential of becoming a lifelong customer.”"

They are up and running in Collegeville [link]. I hear at work that they won't open a new store unless they own the land and the undeveloped land around it.   [KOP Wegman's map]. That big red box was zoned agricultural and was a golf course in the 90s, but Wegman's bought some or all of that land, and almost all of it is currently under construction. I would imagine the Walmart to the east of Wegman's to go as its a pretty shitty location and could be another office park or retail. Blue box is an office tower.

philadelphia,3d8ndz,funkyted,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I bet a some issues could be solved if septa parking lots considered the parking patterns of reverse commuters. The numbers just don't add up right now, but if I could keep a car at the Norristown parking garage at a cheaper monthly rate (and/or without buying a trail pass, since I don't commute 5 days a week, more like 3), I would totally do it, and they would save a parking space for the regular commuter in the lot."
philadelphia,3d8ndz,AKraiderfan,4,Tue Jul 14 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing. If your reverse commute is so horrendous, then do something about it. Move, change jobs, telecommute, ride a bicycle, know alternates, whatever. Don't blame the city's recent growth and its pretty-decent rail system because they can't get you door to door in 30 minutes. You cannot complain about the traffic when you are the traffic.   I can see the benefits of corporate shuttles, definitely. It is mesmerizing to watch car-after-car pour into the same office complex exactly at the same time. Offer one free shot on a corporate shuttle, and it will be an instant hit.  I'm a reverse commuter. Hour each way in the car, hour +10 mins on a bicycle."
philadelphia,3d8ndz,jgur88,10,Tue Jul 14 12:52:07 2015 UTC,"I think your view is a little short-sighted. You don't know everyone's situation and if a small investment in SEPTA and other transit projects would pay off big time by making both Philly a more attractive place to live and the suburbs a more attractive place to work then everyone wins.  So you can bike to work and don't have a last mile problem, congratulations!"
philadelphia,3d8ndz,funkyted,2,Tue Jul 14 14:13:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure a small investment in SEPTA could result in a large payoff anywhere in the system, or it would be implemented by now.

philadelphia,3d8ndz,jgur88,2,Tue Jul 14 14:16:58 2015 UTC,"By other transit projects, I mean other investments made by groups outside of SEPTA, like commuter shuttles mentioned in the article.  If an employee looks online and finds no solution to their last mile problem maybe they won't take that job. Or maybe they won't mention to their boss or coworkers their interest in being able to take public transit, or more likely their boss or coworkers won't have any idea of the possibility.  If there was a formal, affordable, organized system in place in different areas maybe more people would be more apt to use them and become reverse commuters. And I'm talking about commuter shuttles, ride and park systems, reverse commute express trains, etc. More people using public transit would be good for the area for many reasons."

philadelphia,3d8ndz,jgur88,3,Tue Jul 14 14:30:57 2015 UTC,"YES YES YES!  I've been living this for a decade. I live in the city because I want to for various reasons and because my husband works here as well. But my job doesn't really exist in the city (pharma belt), so I've had a minimum of an hour commute one way. I lucked out for a while initially with just an hour on septa a decade ago, but then I was moved further west making it 1:40 by septa (mostly from the ""last mile"" problem and the lack of express trains for reverse commuters). I gave in and got a car, which brought it down to an hour one way on a good day, on 76. I've moved around a bit and found 95 n in the morning to be surprisingly okay. Now I'm back to commuting by septa to a work site that has its own non-septa shuttle bus. 1:30 one-way, but at least in 2015 there are smart phones, kindles, and tethering."
philadelphia,3d8ndz,catjuggler,2,Tue Jul 14 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing. If your reverse commute is so horrendous, then do something about it.   If you have people with good jobs living in the city why would they want to give them a reason to move out?  It's not like this is one person complaining about this. It's a lot of people and eventually as the young professionals get older they will do something about it and move out of the city at a large rate. This is a very real problem that the city should make moves to solve sooner rather than later."

There were two city wage tax payers, now there's just one. So city officials should have incentive to prevent a reverse commute from becoming entirely miserable."

On Inauguration Day, federal authorities were authorized to jam signals at some locations in downtown Washington, according to current and former federal officials. The Secret Service and other officials declined to provide specific details, some of which are classified.  Jamming has been approved in the past for major events, ranging from State of the Union addresses to visits by certain foreign dignitaries, according to a federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about the subject.  After transit bombings in Europe, the Department of Homeland Security reached an agreement in 2006 under the National Communications System with cellphone companies to voluntarily shut down service under certain circumstances, which could disable signals for areas ranging from a tunnel to an entire metropolitan region, a DHS official said.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/31/AR2009013101548.html  especially considering the last point about transit being a natural target, if the Secret Service is calling the shots for SEPTA operations, why would it be nutty to think they might deploy such technology during this event? im not saying that they will or wont or should or shouldnt. from their perspective, it would be negligent to fail to at least consider it."
philadelphia,3d61v1,DeadEndRadio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:47:42 2015 UTC,Yeah it's not super tinfoil hat. Cell phone jamming done at large events to prevent remote triggering of bombs and such.

philadelphia,3d46n2,Mister__Crowley,23,Mon Jul 13 20:08:45 2015 UTC,"From the Inquirer article in May on the acquittal: http://articles.philly.com/2015-05-16/news/62192693_1_federal-corruption-trial-perry-betts-six-narcotics-officers  ...""Lawyers for the indicted officers ... accused prosecutors of gullibility in basing their case solely on the word of drug suspects and former Officer Jeffrey Walker.  Walker, who pleaded guilty in a separate corruption case last year, testified against his former squad mates, implicating them in dozens of crimes during three days on the witness stand this month.  He admitted he had stolen thousands of dollars over his career, and in at least 15 cases had offered perjured testimony in court that had sent innocent men to prison. And he maintained that Liciardello and his other indicted former colleagues were just as bad.  Walker's testimony formed the backbone of the government's case. After his arrest in 2013, he flagged several drug investigations in which he alleged that the squad had committed crimes.  Federal authorities included those cases in which the drug suspects' recollections independently matched Walker's in their indictment against Liciardello and his codefendants.  Jurors declined to explain their decision as they were escorted from the courthouse. But alternate juror Tim Hummell, who sat through the trial but did not participate in deliberations, said he didn't believe the government had offered enough evidence to convict.  ""These guys have a tough job,"" said Hummell, 54, of Harleysville. ""The prosecutors were just nitpicking on paperwork.""  Of Walker, he added: ""It was hard to believe a word he said, because of all the lying."""
philadelphia,3d46n2,joaofava,27,Mon Jul 13 13:18:01 2015 UTC,"And because of these charges hundreds of drug convictions were overturned.  So if the officers are truly innocent, now we have a number of drug traffickers and dealers back on the street.  If the officers are truly guilty, now we have corrupt cops back on the street.  Either way it's lose-lose for the residents of Philadelphia."

The problem is that they would be embroiled in a lengthy and astronomically expensive court case with the FOP, funded by tax payers, and they would rather take the short-term public heat and reinstate these criminals than drag out a battle and take the long heat.

In a system that's already flooded with cases, and swamped ADA's, it's easier to just drop the years worth of drug convictions. It's a part of a larger shift occuring whereas drug possession, in specific, is becoming the type of crime that this city, and seemingly other major cities, are approaching with less zeal than in previous years.  Most obvious example is seen in the slow decriminalization of marijuana, as well as pushing a more rehabilitative spin, like taking classes, around the possession of harder stuff."

Also, in criminal court you have to be proven guilty ""beyond a reasonable doubt"", whereas in civil court you're usually under a ""substantial certainty"" standard- which is more 50-50. You can be acquitted of a crime but have your firing affirmed under the same evidence- then the jury's (if you consider the jury as the ""voice of the public"" even when it's different people) just saying ""we're certain enough that you can be fired but not certain enough that you'll be sent to jail.""  Also there's the part where 450 possible drug dealers are back on the streets, and those responsible may be getting their jobs back and a nice pile of taxpayer cheese to make up for the inconvenience."

Also   Benefit of doubt to the drug dealers   Possible drug dealers. Remember, some of these guys had their convictions reversed on the basis that the cops planted evidence.   Just because someone wasn't convicted doesn't mean something didn't happen. It means a group of people decided we didn't know enough to justify punishing them, that's it.  And I'm calling them possible drug dealers despite that their convictions were overturned, aren't I?

I def. see the value in people trading commute time for a liveable urban community - not everybody's choice but a viable choice.  In crude economic terms alone, someone like this is building equity that doesn't depend on her job. If the job disappears, her community is still there, and whatever networks she's built; and because it's central she's positioned to get to all sorts of other jobs and keep the whole thing going.   For some people, living in a mcvillage near the office park is the right move. But banking on Fishtown or someplace like it isn't just stoopit hipsturizzum. It's a time-honored strategy: invest in density."

It oversimplifies the finances quite a bit, and thus seriously underestimates the value of commuting. For example, MMM doesn't count the dollars-and-cents costs of being forced to move if you change jobs or your job changes. Nor does he consider more subtle cost-of-living calculations - e.g. people swap longer commutes for bigger space/better schools & services all the time.

philadelphia,3d60jo,admodieus,7,Tue Jul 14 14:11:02 2015 UTC,"I think there are a number of factors that play into this:   As mentioned in other comments, the amount of taxes placed on businesses within the city is massive. And even when businesses do locate ""inside the city"", it's at the Navy Yard....which isn't served by public transit either, and has hundreds of yards of surface parking.  The amount of millennials who want to live in the city but don't have a job there. I know too many people who work out in Collegeville or Valley Forge but choose to live in Northern Liberties or South Philly because they want that urban lifestyle. A happy medium would be something like Conshohocken or even Roxborough, where you have rail access into the city but also save yourself some amount of miles of sitting in traffic.  The number of people who move into the city yet don't want to give up car culture. I have a number of friends who have moved into Philly after college elsewhere (Penn State is the biggest one, but also Maryland, Pittsburgh, and West Virginia) who keep a car despite being fortunate enough to work in Center City. When it comes time to get around for social events, their first preference is to use said car instead of public transit. This just adds to the congestion for people who have no choice but to drive to/from their jobs because public transit isn't available.    There's no quick fix - house purchases are a long-term investment and they commonly outlast one's tenure at a single employer these days. The solution will have to be scraped together piecemeal across a variety of initiatives - more employees pushing for work-from-home/flexible arrangements, modest improvements to public transit (BSL to Navy Yard, NHSL to KOP and VF), and a re-balancing of the job market between the suburbs and the city. I already see the first and third ones happening, with many young people leaving jobs that force them to endure I-76 five days a week."
philadelphia,3d60jo,thefrozendivide,6,Mon Jul 13 22:33:10 2015 UTC,"I have to commute out of the city for work.95s to 476. No traffic, door to door is 27min, but my average time to and from work in rush hour every day is over an hour. The city needs to make it more viable for businesses to open IN the city. If the city were more business friendly this kind of traffic wouldn't be an issue, but the fact that SO many businesses and a lot of higher paying jobs are outside of the city (typically west), people have to commute out. For me, the public transit option is even longer than the drive and a major pain in the ass.  I've said this so many times before over the years, but we have a SERIOUS lack of abundant, high-paying, diverse businesses in the city. The taxes and greed keep a lot of big business and high paying jobs OUT of the city (obviously barring a few key sectors). I have to commute out of the city for this exact reason as I'm sure a lot of people do. My company which is not small mind you, they desperately wanted to have an office IN Philly but just couldn't swallow the pill of all of the city taxes and bullshit it takes to open up shop. We as a city are an extremely unfriendly city to establish businesses in. Sadly, just like a lot of other forward thinking, well paying jobs, my office was forced to opened west of the city just outside of Philadelphia county. Sad, but the business privilege tax, or whatever they call it now, is not talked about enough. I'd kill to have a short commute on the fucking subway. The traffic is fucking brutal."

Okay so her company moved further out- how close could they have been before? When she decided to buy/rent in Fishtown, she had to have been aware that these little close-knit River Ward neighborhoods were built to house blue collar workers at a time when there were lots of industrial jobs a short bus/trolley/walk away. Just because Fishtown got hot doesn't mean that suddenly it's well postioned as a place for everyone to call home. if you work in the Western/Northwestern Suburbs but you can't imagine living anywhere unhip as KOP, Norristown, Bridgeport, Main Line , etc etc- well then guess what? You are the opposite and yet the same as the millions of Americans who a generation or two ago moved out of the city for a quieter life outside it only to sit in traffic every day to get to work. Eat all the locally grown shit you want from your overpriced CSA and buy anything with ""sustainable"" on the label, it doesn't matter. You're still living the same energy-intensive American lifestyle of choice as everyone who's ever picked a house based on school district, picked an apartment based on nightlife, or neighborhood based on ""vibe"". That's fine! That's all our privilege. Those of us who went to college and haven't started a family yet- we should have all of our favorite things, right?

I'm sure there is a point someone could make about the gentrification of formerly working class areas, blah blah- all I was pointing out is that is that if you have the money to live in a section of a rebounding American city that has the restaurants, bars, parks, grocery stores, and shops that all fit your ideal city life and yet you pay for this lifestyle with a job requiring you spend the equivalent of an extra work day per week in your car...well maybe that's a little nuts."

Looking around online I see some data entry etc. jobs for $13 hour so maybe it's a big assumption I can get one of those.

I think you could meet all your basic needs for around 1k/month if you keep your budget tight and expenses really low. You really need to figure out your bills and come up with a budget. Cost of living in Philly is pretty low for an east coast city, but you'll want at least a little beer money and not eat Ramen every day. I'd go over to /r/personalfinance to really get into the details.   Just a word of advice. Be very careful with unpaid internships. A lot of companies churn through interns and use them as free unpaid labor for low level jobs that don't increase your skills or job experience.  Make absolutely sure they are keeping up their end of the bargain and you are going to be learning new skills that are marketable. Don't let them suck you into cold calling, or basic office/clerical work as your primary duty."

Three, the block captain has to collect bags of trash as they fill, store them somewhere, and set them out on the curb for collection day. That's right: the city doesn't do special collections for public trash cans on residential blocks.   These rules are as asinine as spending $4,600 on a mechanical trashcan.

It's got like 6 months worth of decayed chicken juices coating the inside. I really should clean it but its outside anyway and cleaning it would involve spending time with my face near it.
philadelphia,3d0jsu,Bryology,2,Mon Jul 13 00:43:34 2015 UTC,Let the dogs lick it clean?  I have considered going raw diet for my dogs but the chicken aspect has been hard for me to accept. I know I'd never eat that.
philadelphia,3d0jsu,rubiredd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:46:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, you can get premade patties of raw frozen food for your dogs but its WAY more expensive.  Plus with the chicken they are crunching up the whole bones so it cleans their teeth.  You just have to give them some kind of vegetable once a week or so; my dogs like carrots and red cabbage for some reason.  And you don't have to let it rot; you can give it to them frozen it just takes much longer for them to eat it that way.  I highly recommend the Fine Fare dog diet!  My pitbull was almost bald when I got her and now she has a coat again.  But definitely feed them outside because they like to hold that shit down with their paws and gnaw on it.  Ew, not what you want on your kitchen floor.  Edit to say: 10 lbs of Fine Fare chicken quarters feeds my 45lb pitbull and 11lb dachshund/chihuahua for a week.  That's cheaper than most dogfood and it's way, way better for them.  I cut the drumsticks off the chicken quarters and the little guy gets one of those every day, the pitbull gets the rest of the quarter.  Pretty much every dog in the universe loves raw chicken, but by the end of the week when its getting stinky they are ecstatic about it."

Pawn shop owners are the scum of the earth and will gladly forget to tell you that they received your stolen property last night and that they didn't actually do their job and inspect serial numbers.  Case in point, my mom had jewelry stolen by a scumbag heroin addict. Heroin addict  pawns her jewelry at 69th street. A week or so later when everyone figures out where her things were pawned the pawn shop owner claims to never have received said stolen property, but then figured out he may have sold it but he ""was above boards"". When the police were called to retrieve his security camera footage it was mysteriously deleted.  Don't trust pawn shops. Go in there and get your stolen tools back this morning."

All the beds would need redone and new ties with welded rail, geometry, ditching, all new catanary poles and wiring, signaling grade crossings etc. Not to mention a station and parking facilities.

The other issues they had is that when SEPTA was formed CONRAIL actually ran the regional rail service. When SEPTA did take over, there were a ton of growing pains, and a management that did not want to deal with Diesel EMUs.   The long and short was that SEPTA was given a Regional Rail system that is regulated by the FRA and were completely unfamiliar with the operations of a Railroad."
philadelphia,3cyce8,Mister__Crowley,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:17:55 2015 UTC,"That line was electrified all the way to Norristown as part of the PRR's Schuylkill Branch. It was considered redundant since it ran, in some cases only a few yards away, from the Reading's main line up the river. PRR had already truncated passenger service back to the city limits before Conrail took over. Having multiple private rail operators meant a lot of competing, but technically redundant lines were built. Although in hindsight SEPTA/Conrail probably kept the wrong line. The PRR's was much better built: higher above the river's flood stage and straighter. The Reading side has more curves, floods more often since its closer to the river, and has several bottlenecks like the Black Rock Tunnel.   The real issue to me is that SEPTA wasted money on a new Ivy Ridge Station on that line and then promptly abandoned it almost as soon as it opened.   Edit: Also, by Diesel EMUs I think you mean DMU or RDCs. EMU stands for ""electric multiple unit"". Sorry for the nitpick."

Governor Thornburgh basically told SEPTA to go screw and that PENNDOT funds would never go towards statewide passenger rail like it does with NJT or MBTA. This meant SEPTA basically had to cut back their diesel service to within the metro counties, and that also meant losing their Diesel shops in Reading. Not removing blame from SEPTA leadership at the time, who never had the desire to fight for retaining that service to begin with."

philadelphia,3cyce8,dangerzone2,4,Sat Jul 11 23:52:46 2015 UTC,"Wasn't worth the money to keep it open I guess. Tracks are still there. When you head south on route 1 and go under the bridge, that's the old tracks. There's an old rail car in West Chester that came down to Morton when they dedicated the rebuilt shelter. I've walked along the tracks many times. It's like it's just waiting for the train."

philadelphia,3cyce8,ccommack,5,Sun Jul 12 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"Basically it was running on rails last replaced in 1917, and wooden ties that were so rotten they had a hard time keeping the gauge, with no money to replace them.  The line was electrified, so it ran after the CCCT opened, but it was crumbling to dust in the last years.  Honestly, they were lucky they didn't have a fatal accident before it got shut down."
philadelphia,3cyce8,SmurfyJones,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:36:09 2015 UTC,"short version is after they built the tunnels between market east and suburban they needed to electrify the whole system at a time when they were broke. and the tracks were pretty crap and have gotten worse since, so you basically need to rebuild the whole thing."
philadelphia,3cyce8,EdBacon,3,Sun Jul 12 03:24:58 2015 UTC,"West Chester was fully electrified. That line was abandoned after the diesel service was cut in the early 80s, and had to do with poor track conditions. SEPTA didn't have the money so they asked Chester County which they wanted more: expanded service to Exton along the Main Line, or maintenance of the West Chester Branch. The county chose to expand Exton Station instead since its a shorter ride downtown. Unfortunately for West Chester service it was highly infrequent, underutilized (only a few hundred people used it past Media/Elwyn in the 80s) and consisted of a single winding track which necessitated reduced speeds and added more time to the journey.   Now that Chester County has added so many more people and jobs it makes sense to have rail transit there, but at the time SEPTA couldn't even afford to maintain the system they inherited, let alone expand service in anticipation of future growth. Sadly I don't think you'll see service restored to West Chester for many decades, if at all. A full restoration would require a total rebuild of the grades, bridges, track, and electric which was torn out ten years ago, and you'd probably realign curves and remove grade crossings to bring it up to modern standards. Given the amount of NIMBYism you'd encounter, and the cost, I just don't see it ever getting done =/"

It's the only reason the new train lines are being built here right now. It's partially bullshit because 2/3 or so goes toward highways, not bike or train, but it's still doing good.  Taxes are never popular, but I wonder if something similar could be implemented to expand on Philly's public transit in meaningful ways. It would be nice to see some expansion there!"

Philly has maybe 3 million with jobs dispersed through the suburbs. They're not comparable at all. Of course SEPTA service is going to be smaller and spread thinner. The regional rail service is pretty good though all things considered, when it is on time.   The city also dedicates much less funding to public transit than do other comparable cities like DC. The local share of SEPTA's budget is approximately 10% whereas DC metro gets something like 40% of their funding from the city. So yeah they're going to build up the system faster, there is more money dedicated to it, and they're not dealing with turn of the century infrastructure."

If it's during the day, there's not much you can do besides noise-cancelling head phones.  At night, introduce as much white noise as possible.  Use the fan setting on your A/C or run a window fan.  I even listen to white noise on my phone via headphones to sleep, or wear the foam ear plugs.  Also, have you ever seen an audiologist or neurologist?  There are some treatments for tinnitus out there that may help you."
philadelphia,3cymq8,SmurfyJones,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:25:20 2015 UTC,"i haven't done any research as far as audiologist, etc goes. i was seeing a therapist for a bit, but she had never heard of it, nor did my doctor or my father (who is a doctor also), so i think i just got kind of defeated which, i know, isn't the best way to deal with any problem.  the block party deal usually happens all day during the weekends in summer. it's not every weekend that i can hear them (sometimes they're just far enough away), but at least once a month it happens that i can't go anywhere in my house to relieve myself of the noise. if it's a decent crowd, it ends by 8 or 8:30 pm, but sometimes they go til past 10. but on the regular, my misophonia resides 24/7 with daily noises being triggers. i work in a kitchen so wearing headphones would not be wise so i've learned to deal with those work-specific noises that trigger me.  i'm definitely more bothered by triggers once i'm in my home, where i should feel safe and comforted, which is why i think i respond more to the noises i encounter when i'm at home. so when the block party hits just around the corner from my house, i really freak out. i know i have a specific condition and it would be stupid to call the police on people having fun, but that rationale doesn't take away from my emotional response. i haven't yet found ear plugs that work for me/make me feel as though the noise is fully blocked. if you have any recommendations, i would love to hear them. thank you for your genuine response :)"
philadelphia,3cymq8,okjkay,3,Sun Jul 12 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I get what you're saying.  I have a little bit of background in working with people with tinnitus which is super similar so here's what I know:  You need to avoid silence at all costs.  The problem is that your fight-or-flight system is responding to relatively normal amounts of auditory stimulation that wouldn't bother most people.  The more your fight-or-flight system responds, the better you get at hearing your own triggers because now your brain is listening for them.  If you live in silence (under 40 dB) then you're going to hear EVERYTHING.  If you live in a home filled with white noise (over 40 dB), you won't hear as much external noise and your brain will start to adapt to a new threshold of sound loudness. Then, if you can exposure yourself to your specific triggers in small but increasing doses, it should help alleviate the stress you feel associated with them.    With tinnitus I would never suggest you wear foam plugs, but for you it might be helpful.  Foam plugs (just the blue or orange ones you can buy at CVS) are great as long as you wear them correctly (you have to squeeze them into your ear canal and let them expand).  But again, I'd really only suggest that for when you're sleeping because you really want to avoid silence during your day-to-day life.   Also, if you ever want to get in touch with an audiologist you can start on this website.  Hyperacusis is devastating but fortunately it's also manageable with treatment."

Can't speak for much outside of the city, but Philly is a pretty young city and it's easy to find bars/restaurants catering to your crowd. It's also really easy to get around, especially from the suburbs. Your rent seems managable, and you won't pay anything crazy for utilities-- maybe if you have central air, but whatever.  Buildings in Philly are also generally older than ones in AZ, not sure if that makes a differences but some amenities might be an adjustment (laundromat, etc)  Welcome and have fun!"

philadelphia,3cy8vt,wavyguy215,25,Sat Jul 11 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"Plenty of people get off through the back door, usually if it's crowded.   Personally I like going through the front door if it's sparsely populated by the end because I like telling the driver to have a nice day."
philadelphia,3cy8vt,Green_Go5,4,Sat Jul 11 21:51:45 2015 UTC,"Same here, if it's not too crowded I like to get off at the front just to say ""Thank you."" I know SEPTA drivers don't get a ton of positive feedback (and have to deal with a lot of crap), so I hope I can brighten their day a little."
philadelphia,3cy8vt,cachinnate,7,Sun Jul 12 15:32:50 2015 UTC,About 50% of the time the back door is blocked externally by street side parked vehicles! That only gives a back door exiting bus rider barely thirteen to twenty four inches of clearance between the bus and the parked car! Unless you are super slim slender and skinny; you ain't fitting out the back door!
philadelphia,3cy8vt,murphysfriend,7,Sun Jul 12 10:58:21 2015 UTC,"Despite policy and signs, drivers prefer it for reasons which were once explained to me but I don't remember."
philadelphia,3cy8vt,SmurfyJones,15,Sat Jul 11 21:50:57 2015 UTC,Part of the reason drivers prefer it is because some people like to skip out on paying by getting on at the back door. So they normally only open the back when someone yells for them to do so.
philadelphia,3cy8vt,DPayne22,4,Sat Jul 11 22:00:03 2015 UTC,"So, ""the stupidest thing [you've] ever seen"" was not in your country ""with a lot of public transportation"" where they, ""berate anyone dumb enough to get off the bus via the front door,"" but instead where Americans sometimes exit through the front of a bus?"
philadelphia,3cy8vt,6NippleCharlie,2,Sun Jul 12 01:06:30 2015 UTC,"Also to be fair on most buses the signage isn't clear. Sure there are Exit through the backdoor signs but every bus I've been on has an Exit Here sign next to the front door, so I usually just exit via which ever door is closest to where I'm at."
philadelphia,3cy8vt,eapocalypse,3,Sat Jul 11 23:46:08 2015 UTC,I think it's the same for me.  I use whichever exit I'm closest to and also the least agonizing route.  Sometimes there is a huge ass stroller (aren't you suppose to fold these anyway like nobody ever does?) or a big person blocking the exit which then I'll use other exit.
philadelphia,3cy8vt,Xineus,2,Sun Jul 12 01:37:12 2015 UTC,because its crowded? because the angry schoolkid/thugs/drunks are back there? because i hate yelling 'back door' ?
philadelphia,3cy8vt,miltonstreet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:05:34 2015 UTC,"OP, are you from Ottawa by any chance?  I used to live there and know that it is policy that you exit by the back door.  Ottawa Bus drivers and passengers get angry at people exiting by the front. Buses there also have sensors that allow passengers to open the back door themselves rather than have to ask the driver to open the door.  For whatever reason, it's doesn't seem to be SEPTA policy that passengers exit by the back door."

philadelphia,3cy8vt,jnachod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:06:07 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, the bus drivers are busy doing who know what to look at the rear mirror to see someone standing by the door to let them out. Usually I exit out the front because by the time I get to my stop, there are a few people left."
philadelphia,3cy8vt,Lithium718,-1,Tue Jul 14 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"I think its because the people are idiots, but that's my gut reaction. Plus, it doesn't make sense to get off at the front 95% of the time.  If you get off at the front, most of the time you're holding up the people trying to get off and it's insanely inefficient. Someone had the comment about ""people not paying by leaving out the back"", but you always pay the second you get on at the front. That's only an issue at incredibly crowded stops and, even then, some places have a SEPTA employee who checks to make sure the people getting on at the back pay their fares.  Say your hellos and nice days at the front, take a seat, and leave by the back. Are you near the end of the line or a place where no one is going to get on? Fine, go out the front. Are you handicapped or old? Out the front you go.  TL:DR; Exiting from the front is only for old people and the handicapped."

Cosby is basically in the OJ Simpson category for me, there is enough circumstantial logic/evidence to deduce he very likely did it, even though he may never be convicted.  Not just ~30 women have come out, but many of them with moderate notoriety and nothing to really gain, all of them tied to Cosby over long periods of time with no direct relation to each other...it would have to be one of the biggest conspiracies ever at this point.  I don't usually like jumping to conclusions before there is a trial, but this is one of the few times it's logical to do so.   Just like the Paterno statue, you can't erase history.

philadelphia,3cpug2,HueyS_Philly,6,Thu Jul 9 21:36:47 2015 UTC,This seems like a result of city officials leaning on L and I about the beer gardens mainly because longtime point breeze residents see it as a symbol of unwanted gentrification.   Article: http://billypenn.com/2015/06/05/why-point-breeze-residents-are-fighting-a-pop-up-beer-garden/
philadelphia,3cpug2,Phila_Spector,9,Thu Jul 9 22:36:36 2015 UTC,"The shutdown of the Point Breeze beer garden had nothing to do with gentrification. Ori Feibush's butt buddy Chris Sawyer admitted he made at least one complaint to 311 to have it shut down, then he triumphantly blogged about it, making his way around to comment on other sites and take credit. The Point Breeze situation has everything to do with the butthurt Ori supporters taking revenge on John Longacre for supporting Kenyatta Johnson in the primary."

I reckon that dude asking 16k/night would take 10-12k in a heartbeat at this point.

Why?  I've been to Vatican City on Easter Sunday, arguably the biggest day of the year for the city.  It didn't cost me five USD figures to get there and stay.  The Pope is there most days of the year.  If people want to pilgrimage to see the Pope, they can.    I don't think there has to be a line, at all.  You want to charge well under market rate?  Fine, you'll have no problem finding a taker.  If somebody somewhere is willing to pay $16K to stay within spitting distance, it's not gouging.  Gouging would be a situation where the entire city of Philadelphia collectively decided that all houses cost $16K, and that's the minimum price that can be paid.    Lansdowne   Oh.  OK.  I see what the confusion is here.  The line that separates ""reasonable"" from ""gouging"" is somewhere between the Parkway and Delaware County.

philadelphia,3cphjj,unctracc,8,Thu Jul 9 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"Your friend has no idea what she's talking about. We have DMVs and you can do all your paperwork through them.  You're coming to a large city, you'll find a mechanic that will pass your car (even if it shouldn't).  You're to surrender your out-of-state license within 60 days and apply for a PA licence  Vehicle title & registration applications are to be done within 20 days of residency  You need a valid PA ID to title & register, so you'll need to do that part ASAP before trying to do the title work. Also, there's nothing that says you need to have the car re-inspected in PA to register & title it. You may want to specifically ask when you go to switch your license.   EDIT: if you happen to have AAA, they will probably do most, if not all, of this for you"

My NY inspection goes until October.
philadelphia,3cphjj,GottheOrangeJuice,4,Thu Jul 9 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"In PA, you change over your registration (and license) before getting an inspection. Your car must be registered in PA to get an inspection. What your friend was probably talking about is an Auto Tags place, which offers some common services, such as switching valid out-of-state licenses to in-state, titling, and registration. DMVs also exist but Auto Tag places tend to be faster and more conveniently located. Simply get the required forms from the PA Dept of Transportation website and bring a check."

Edit: Also, in conjunction to /u/unctracc's helpful comment, I was able to get the new license, title, and registration all done at the same time FWIW"
philadelphia,3cphjj,RelaxErin,4,Thu Jul 9 19:54:16 2015 UTC,"the auto tag places are a weird thing, but basically you pay them a bitof money to fill out the forms correctly and exepdite the process.. you don't need to use them, but they're probably worth the small added expense."

philadelphia,3cphjj,elltim92,2,Thu Jul 9 19:46:08 2015 UTC,"If you have AAA, they can do all the title and registration stuff for you.  I had no problem registering or getting inspected my 10 year old car.  By using AAA I had everything done that day and walked out with my new license plate.  Switching your license is a pretty painless procedure at any PennDOT, you just have to get your photo taken and they'll print you out a temp license on the spot."
philadelphia,3cphjj,elltim92,2,Thu Jul 9 20:35:45 2015 UTC,"PA inspection can be rough, but it's dependent on the mechanic. Some people will fry you for anything on the books, other shops will see the absence of a check engine light and sign off on it.   When you get into town, talk to your neighbors (with older more beat up, or modified vehicles ideally) about what shop they use. They'll be in the know about what shops are tougher to get by on.  Realistically, at 6 years old (You're driving an '09 I'm guessing) unless you've put some serious abuse and/or modification into the car, you'll be fine. The only thing that I'd  expect them to hassle you for are tires or brakes. Check them yourself before, or have a friend who knows a bit about cars take a look at them, to know what to expect.  If you put up the neighborhood you're moving to, someone may be able to chime in with some recommendations for good shops.  Also: I'm pretty sure every state in the union has a DMV of some form."

I think they only ask for a $10 optional donation anyway and they get a couple of delicious food trucks to park outside for the day."

Base the rest of Saturday on what time you get. You can see the Mint from here (don't go in), as well as Ben Franklin's grave.  Liberty Bell is hit or miss depending on crowds - it can be viewed through a window toward the south of the building. If you have time, hit the Philosophical Society's Museum (free, next to Independence Hall) if you like Jefferson and Science.  If you're going down to the Curtis Center, you might want to flip Franklin Sq., minigolf, etc. for Washington Sq. and head to South Street for the Magic Gardens and a steak from Jim's.  Franklin Court ($5) is a good addition if you're into history. It's got a good 2-3 hours of content.  Up to you, but I'd say take the El ($2.25 cash, $1.80 token) from 5th or 2nd to Girard and wander around there. It's an ugly (as in walking along/under/around freeways) walk from Old City to Fishtown (it's my walk home from work).  If you end up going to Fishtown / Penn Treaty, skip Penn's Landing. If you end up doing Franklin Sq. / Elfreth's Alley, do Penn's Landing and skip Fishtown / Penn Treaty.  Finally, plan on spending double what you allotted on food."

philadelphia,3cmo7u,Bryology,3,Thu Jul 9 12:30:34 2015 UTC,"New construction gets the abatement, not new residents. I can move from my 120 year old house to a newly built 'townhouse' aka rowhome and still get the abatement."

philadelphia,3cmo7u,RobPeterPayPaul,2,Fri Jul 10 04:36:40 2015 UTC,"The tax rate here is incredibly low. Even if your home goes from being assessed at $50k to $250k with LOOP and other programs, the increase is quite manageable.   I would also note that TnT are the leaders of the anti-development folks, and both of them use lies to get people more upset and make the idea of an equitable compromise impossible."

philadelphia,3cmo7u,Phila_Spector,2,Thu Jul 9 11:46:47 2015 UTC,"Oh this is definitely the result of Longacre backing Kenyatta, but not in the way you're suggesting. Ori Feibush's lackey Chris Sawyer made the 311 complaints and has been gloating about it all over the internet and his garbage vendetta blog. This is revenge for supporting Kenyatta.  It's funny that Sawyer was nowhere to be found when Ori's warehouse was sitting half collapsed into Woodstock Street for 6 months, leading to the roof blowing off and more walls collapsing onto 20th St. in the big storm a couple of weeks ago. Of course that was also somehow everyone else's fault, and not the owner who left it rotting mid-demolition with predictable consequences."
philadelphia,3cmo7u,RobPeterPayPaul,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:42:16 2015 UTC,It's a combination of the response Harris got at the meeting and the call from Sawyer (who is more like an ally than a lackey of Feibush).
philadelphia,3cmo7u,RobPeterPayPaul,0,Fri Jul 10 13:29:08 2015 UTC,"Ally implies similar status. For all the hate that Ori inspires, he has at least done something concrete and positive in this city. Chris Sawyer is a nobody. He's a loudmouth with a blog who moved his trolling from a dead message board to facebook groups for neighborhoods he doesn't live in. He hitched his wagon to Ori during the run up to the primary to try to give himself some exposure, but he'll be a blip in the general election for sheriff, and not because his ideas aren't good (they are), but because he's just a dick."
philadelphia,3cmo7u,eapocalypse,2,Sat Jul 11 01:46:32 2015 UTC,"That's not really fair. Sawyer existed before Ori did, and he's done actual work, he was one of the biggest reasons the city was shamed into finally going after the millions of dollars in taxes owed."
philadelphia,3cmo7u,Slugged,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:31:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, he's probably older than Ori. The only person that gives Sawyer any credit for anything is himself, on his own blog. He briefly got some news for his crusade on bandit signs. The city has been getting shamed over tax collection for ages by actual journalists in actual publications with journalistic integrity. I think that has a little more to do with it. I've wasted enough thought on this douche as it is, and I'm sure every mention of his name stokes his internet boner, so I'm done."

philadelphia,3cln5x,jhc1415,-10,Thu Jul 9 03:29:50 2015 UTC,"How often do you see CNN reporting on this? The reason it's always biased is that the only people that care enough to report on any particular incident of police brutality are the ones that pay attention to police brutality. The reason is that there's a whole lot of police brutality, and if every incident was reported by CNN there wouldn't be time for anything else.

Since executive and legislative elections would not be held until the following year, the public voiced its displeasure by narrowly granting retention to Justice Sandra Shultz Newman and denying retention to Justice Nigro. Nigro received strong support from southeastern Pennsylvania and his native Philadelphia, but met strong opposition in southwestern and southcentral Pennsylvania where anger over the pay raise was greatest.  The public blamed Nigro, specifically, for voting to raise his own salary during a midnight session of the legislature. Nigro has since been presiding over Real Estate Tax Appeals in The City at a salary of $70,000 for what the Philadelphia Inquirer calls a ""Part Time job"".http://articles.philly.com/2009-05-03/news/25274221_1_board-member-judges-newest-member     Relevant: Pennsylvania state elections, 2005 | Nigro | Supreme Court of Pennsylvania | 2005 Pennsylvania General Assembly pay raise controversy   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

It is typical for the person being snapped out of a doldrum to be upset that you've pointed out they are at a much lower level of awareness than you are. It is probably a predator-prey psychology thing long since ingrained into our consciousness.   The other school of thought when passing a clueless snowflake is to say nothing, and let your jet stream do the talking. Like that scene in Top Gun where they buzz the tower.   Fear is a strong motivator. For those who ignore the rules of the trail - mainly keeping right and removing one's self from the trail when stopping - being scared shitless by a stealth high speed pass is an enlightening experience.   Pay attention on the trail, as there are consequences for failing to do so. Just like when using a highway, intersection, or really any other part of waking life.

The key is whether the vehicle's primary purpose is transportation of passengers for compensation.  See http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/75/00.038.009.000..HTM,  (b)  Exception.--This section does not prohibit possession or consumption by any of the following: (1)  A passenger in the passenger area of a motor vehicle designed, maintained or used primarily for the lawful transportation of persons for compensation. This paragraph includes buses, taxis and limousines.   So, under this definition it would be legal to drink in the car of a full-time UberX driver, since it would be their car's primary use, but only outside of Philly where UberX is legal.  It also seems someone who bought a used taxi and used it personally could let their passengers drink because of the word ""or"" in ""designed, maintained or used primarily for the lawful transportation"", ie. any one of the three are sufficient."

philadelphia,3ckxnu,shyduck,7,Fri Jul 10 14:33:30 2015 UTC,I totally get why Bruno is stepping away. I think he's been around too long and is too professional to deal with the current state of the show and WIP. It's gotta be exhausting.
philadelphia,3ckxnu,kirbs2001,3,Wed Jul 8 20:02:39 2015 UTC,I have wondered for the last couple months why Bruno was even on that show. Bruno was the consummate professional and he was always bailing Josh out. Why he choose to lend his name and time to that show is beyond me.
philadelphia,3ckxnu,RoswellSpaceman,3,Wed Jul 8 22:42:09 2015 UTC,"He walked away from The Fanatic last June, and was out of a job for 6 months. There's only one other major sports station in this city, and he wanted to stay in Philly. So he had no choice but to go to WIP and take whatever time slot and co-host they offered.  Unfortunately, he got paired with a guy (Josh Innes) that's the polar opposite of him, and it never really worked from day 1. He's saying that he didn't leave because of Innes, but that seems to be the case IMO. He never really seemed comfortable partaking in Innes's ""Bitchanelli"" smear campaign."
philadelphia,3ckxnu,PlasticSky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:38:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's a combination of that and the corporate direction of the show. I don't think it was purely Josh though he was probably exhausting. WIP was getting rocked in ratings so they had to push something different. Josh pulls in listeners and that brings in more sponsors. Since their show started and hit #1 there's been way more promotional things and live reads. Longer commercial breaks and more frequent ones too I've noticed. But it's because Josh draws people, conflict or not. I suspect Tony only felt like tolerating so much at this point anyway, and instead of continuing to tolerate corporate politics and social drama he stepped down which I think is a wise decision."
philadelphia,3ckxnu,m-torr,9,Thu Jul 9 03:09:27 2015 UTC,I really hope Josh was let go. He's such a chode. Edit: Josh is back on the air...god damn it.

That said, I wouldn't listen to the show without Tony. Josh needed someone to bring some semblance of balance and bring him back to Earth. Tony provided a great counterpoint to Josh's ranting and silliness, and frankly knew sports better than Josh. The show doesn't work without Tony Bruno. You can see how much the show needs Tony when others fill in. I don't mind Jody Mac but he clearly was too out of his element to properly fill in."

philadelphia,3ckxnu,rane56,13,Wed Jul 8 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"I don't respect the way he goes about being ""entertaining."" Same reason I don't respect reality TV and other garbage media forms. I think you can be entertaining and a good radio host, and not be a whiny, sore loser, bitch. Even in sports talk radio.  I have nothing against people who like him or people who listen to him. Whatever. You like what you like. I just don't like him."
philadelphia,3ckxnu,TripleSkeet,12,Wed Jul 8 19:19:03 2015 UTC,"At first I thought the guy was a breath of fresh air.  After listening for awhile, it became clear he's just trying too damn hard to be ""one of us"".  By one of us, I mean a Philadelphia sports fan.  Innes has this notion of what he thinks we are and tries to mimic what he thinks our attytude is.  He has no actual in-depth information about the teams and brushes off callers if they want to talk about anything that is beyond his superficial knowledge of our sports teams.    This has nothing about being a home town good old boy.  It's when you don't have the knowledge to be on sports radio in this town, it becomes very clear, very fast, that the wannabe emperor has no clothes.  Innes has proven himself to be another shock jock who is trying to create controversy instead of good talk radio."
philadelphia,3ckxnu,Whattheha,-1,Wed Jul 8 19:55:00 2015 UTC,"I wholly disagree with you, respectfully of course.   He knows more about sports teams than i do, he knows facts stats ect and has used them when needed...  If you meant insider info about our home teams, well he's not been here long enough to get insider info...  He does lean towards the entertainment side of radio more than sports talk, but when in a dead sports zone like we are now i can't expect nor want someone yammering on about the Phillies sucking or who's the starting qb next year (for the thousandth time)...   I don't see him trying to be ""one of us"" at all, if anything he goes out of his way to make sure the listener knows he's not from here, but does like it here... He mimics some catch phrases and the like, but i wouldn't come close to phrasing it the way you did. Lets assume he is though, why is that a bad thing exactly?  Lets say he does want to be a ""Philly kid"", why is that wrong?"
philadelphia,3ckxnu,Rockyrambo,4,Wed Jul 8 20:04:35 2015 UTC,"He's trying too damn hard to pretend to be something he's not.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt when I first tuned in.  Honestly, I sort of liked the guy at first.    But it comes down to more than simple ""entertainment"".  Eskin has his schtick which included insulting the callers, telling them they were morons and all kinds of things.  But you know the difference?  Eskin is the real damn deal.  Like him or not, the guy has connections with our teams.  He's an actual reporter who does the leg work.  He asks the tough questions.  He talks about topics that are important to us fans.  He also threw in plenty of off-sports topics that engaged the listener.  I remember calling in years ago trying to guess Jamie Lee Curtis' bra size.  (I was right.. 34C)  :)      I'm also tired of the guys who think we want to hear faux controversial topics just to get callers to get all riled up and call in.  Sure, it works in the short-term, but you need to develop and grow your audience.  Innes has no loyalty from us, the listeners.  He has no respect for any opinions he doesn't want to hear.  Press him for any type of knowledge that goes beyond what you'll hear on ESPN and he's completely lost.  He becomes abusive and abrasive along with being downright offensive... just for the point of being offensive.  I'm sorry, but the listener wants more than that.  As u/DocShaeball420 put it, if he wants this type of entertainment, he'll listen to Howard Stern.    I don't expect him to be ""one of us"".  I want him to be who he is.  If he's brash and loud, good.  But one thing that is unforgivable is not having the knowledge to talk about more than cursory sports topics. He mentioned Bruno not being prepared today during his self-serving diatribe.  That was priceless.  Bruno could go on the air without any preparation and talk sports for days.  Innes, when it comes down to it, is simply a pretender."
philadelphia,3ckxnu,Whattheha,-1,Wed Jul 8 20:27:38 2015 UTC,"I'd ask you to give an example but i can't give one of my own.  He has enough knowledge of sports to have had multiple shows in multiple city's, whether for ratings or his sports knowledge is i guess an unknown.    It seems to come down to you just not liking him.  I don't mind him, i like him, i think he's done wonders for sports talk in this city.    I'm sitting here listening to him, he didn't say Bruno was unprepared as in he doesn't know his sports, he said they didn't prepare for the show sometimes... As in what they were going to talk about, guests and the like... But you don't like him so you hear what you want.  Just like you don't hear him with credible sports facts...  Eskin has those contacts because he's been in the sports world for something like 40 years, Josh is 30 years old... Kind of an unfair comparison..."
philadelphia,3ckxnu,IdleRhymer,3,Wed Jul 8 20:45:00 2015 UTC,I would say in all honesty i dont think he knows more sports than I do. And Im not some kind of guru in any way. Just because he got a job doing sports talk doesnt mean he knows more than everyone listening. phil from Mt. airy used to be just a caller for Christs sake.
philadelphia,3ckxnu,rane56,5,Thu Jul 9 05:38:44 2015 UTC,"IMHO (and many others), he's managed to degrade the quality of our sports talk in this city in a very short amount of time. I could care less if he's 30 years old.  He managed to get this job.  As a Philadelphia sports fan, I expect him to be able to talk about our teams.  If WIP hired him to create controversy, they got it.    You seem to be supporting him because you do like him.  I guess you could also say that we all hear what we want to hear.  We can agree to disagree about him.  But in all sincerity, I gave him an honest listen for some time.  It became incredibly clear after a while that Innes isn't going to cut it with those of us who expect more than superficial conversation about our sports teams."

philadelphia,3ckxnu,Whattheha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:07:20 2015 UTC,"I don't either per se, but you have to admit that when the sports landscape is slow he often times will take contrarian viewpoints that he knows will get some kind of a rise out of the audience.   For instance, just yesterday he was acting like all of the Philly sports fan base was up in arms because Chase Utley got benched and I tend to think that people are more apathetic than anything regarding the Phils. Yes, it's sad the way it's playing out with Chase, but nobody started cursing and throwing things because he got benched...that's my point with him.  Another thing he KNOWS gets under people's skin is his borderline perverted love for LeBron. I don't know if he actually loves LeBron as much as it seems like, but when the Flyers are out and the Sixers suck, he knows that verbally licking LeBron's butthole will cause people to call in to argue with him so it's his go to during basketball season. I actually like watching LeBron, but with LeBron...Mikey Miss is like that guy you know who loves a certain band soooo much that it makes you start to resent that band."
philadelphia,3ckxnu,rane56,-1,Thu Jul 9 05:41:54 2015 UTC,"I get that, but there is literally nothing to talk about in sports right now... I get that you don't like them, but there is something to say about Cataldi and Innes being number one in their respective markets.  The old sports only radio is gone my friend, welcome to the new world...  When you talk only sports when no sports are going on you loose listeners, if you can bridge the gap with whatever to keep people listening your going to rise through the ranks and gain traction.    The other thing with this, there is another radio show you can listen to in town that does do sports all the time... But again its hard to listen to the same sports topic all freaking day... But that's just me, i tend to like my sports mixed in with other shit to keep it entertaining..."

philadelphia,3ckxnu,DocShadeball420,5,Wed Jul 8 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"I know you meant Philly sports.    Where to start... Utley, Phil's ownership, Okafor, upcoming training camp, Phils series with the Dodgers, new Flyers coach, even silly things like a judge using Iverson's practice rant in his ruling against the redskins, the upcoming NFL season, competition in the NFC east along with analyzing the other teams, Cesar Hernandez, Ruben Amaro, Halladay being pulled over twice in the same day by the same cop (funny as anything), Richaun Holmes, Biddle's AAA debut tonight, Jackson's quote that he's an Eagles killer, just to name a few things."
philadelphia,3ckxnu,rane56,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"I guess my point was, he does talk about those things, but he's not the type to go on about for his entire show.

The same thing happened on a grander scale with TMZSPN, which is truly sad, especially with how much of a pathetic joke that network is now.   I may be old school, but that's great by me, rather that and have integrity than an A.D.D. riddled nitwit who needs some clown to make bad sexual innuendo and drug jokes to keep me entertained."
philadelphia,3ckxnu,PlasticSky,-1,Thu Jul 9 18:04:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the complements!    I have to disagree with you, his show is number one in the target demographic specifically because he doesn't do all sports all the time.  That's not what he was brought to the station for, he's there to entertain through sports, not to talk sports constantly.  The shows that do get repetitive, esp when only one of our teams is in season...   P.S. I think you need some anger management... You've got some built up hostility there."

Without Tony his show might not hang on to that #1 spot for long because actual sports fans (unlike you) get tired of schtick all the time. Like when Missanelli came in...people hated Eskin and he gave them an alternative, then Eskin leaves and Missanelli starts loving him some him so when someone else comes in, of course they get that bump for a while, because people were tired of Missanelli being so arrogant and condescending...but without Bruno, Innes won't be long for the #1 spot because he's really only a semi-talented troll who has a very narrow sports intellect with regards to Philly and it's fan base.   But you go on ahead and keep coming back with empty retorts like ""he's #1"" and ""you're angry."" Maybe if you try hard enough this discussion can devolve into who gets the last word in before the other one gives up, like the vast majority of Reddit debates do."

Anyway, Innes got to that spot without Bruno... His ratings at the night slot got him to the afternoon spot... It's not like he just showed up in the afternoon, he was on the station for a few months or more before his current spot.   I'm not going to debate what will happen in the future, we will have to see if he stays number one.    Facts are not empty retorts, they are the truth, he's number one in the market for some reason...  May i ask what you brought to the table?  You're giving a hypothetical and comparing different shows hoping to string together similar outcomes...

I didn't devolve the conversation by pointing out that you are part of the lowest common denominator, because if you find a guy continuously trying to troll callers and race bait, while not allowing actual discussion to go on to be entertaining...then saying you obviously do have a low IQ and pointing out you're on the low end of the intellectual totem pole is not ""name calling,"" it's actually bringing facts to the table.   I'm terribly sorry you don't agree with my opinion...which is where this whole thing started (I gave my opinion and it made you feel butthurt).  But if you don't like it or agree with it, that's great for you...I'm thrilled! Okay lil buddy...now go ahead and re-word everything I just said and throw it back at me as though it's your own response...go on, you can do it!"
philadelphia,3ckxnu,omni-nihilist,5,Thu Jul 9 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"I don't find him entertaining and people who support him seem to find him hilarious.   He very obviously race baits and it's not fun to listen to. He will troll callers often. Not just once in a while but very often if he's in a crabby mood or some caller is being kind of a moron. He mistreats callers and handles their content poorly.   Several months ago I heard Flyers Rob, a regular caller, call and talk about potential Flyers coaches he thinks would work. I thought FINALLY a Flyers discussion. Josh cut him off to talk about the end slices of a loaf of bread being lonely. He ranted about that for 2 minutes then hung up on Flyers Rob. That was enough for me not to turn the radio back on.   There was a slow news week a few weeks back so instead of coming up with some engaging topic relating either to the city or the teams, he ranted for days about Caitlin Jenner during multiple segments.  He'll dedicate hours to ranting about how much Missanelli sucks. Good god I do not care.   He will give bad callers 5-7 minutes of radio time while he messes with them and callers with good sports topics he gives 20 seconds to say one thing then he says ""thanks for the call"" and hangs up.   Then the 5 o'clock hour degrades into a circlejerk of ""Josh isn't Philly enough"" and ""Josh is a breath of fresh air and great.""   I don't care if he's from the city or not. Although it doesn't help that he has no associations and sentiments about any previous teams or players. When he's really into a sports topic it can be very interesting and engaging. But what he brings to the table in sports talk is more sports opinion and gossip and it's not enough for me so I've been turning off WIP far more when the afternoon show is on.   I don't hate Josh but I haven't found him that entertaining, it's dumbed down sports talk. I don't dislike Josh or WIP but I have grown indifferent to their content at this point."

A lot of people can spot a phony when they see (or in this case hear) one. And this guy is a big a phony as they come. Hes the kind of guy that would talk shit if he was behind a keyboard or had twenty guys behind him, but if he was by himself would be as wouldnt open his mouth. That shit with Sur Schilling is a perfect example. Dont get me wrong, shes awful and it was funny what he was doing, but the reason why just screamed petulant child trying to show how edgy he can be. I wouldve been much more impressed if he did that out of the blue on a regular day. Plus he knows dick about Philly sports and loves to tell the fans here they are wrong for how they feel. Reminds me of the guys that told us how great McNabb was and how we shouldve appreciated him more and were going to regret him going to Washington, then were in shock when he finished the season on the bench. Even though the fans in this city that actually know football saw it coming from a mile away."
philadelphia,3ckxnu,baconcatsliberal,0,Thu Jul 9 03:28:15 2015 UTC,"I listen to him. I really like his show, he just kinda looses track sometimes. Specifically when someone calls in bashing the show, he stays on the subject of ""why my show is good, and doesn't suck"" for at least an hour. I don't need to know why your show doesn't suck, I listen, I know it doesn't suck. Its funny when he does it for a couple mins but it just gets really annoying most of the time. ... Ultimately I wish he would just let it go when people bash him and just move the fuck on."

If you look at this map, http://www.philaliving.com/philly-neighborhoods/ , the gayborhood is in washington square. Any of the surrounding neighborhoods would fit your request though, with Northern Liberties/Fairmount being the northernmost you probably want to look. If you want to walk everywhere, I wouldn't look much further south than the Graduate Hospital/Bella Vista line, esp if your bf is at Drexel. But with that said, its easy to get around using buses/trains/bikes.   I moved here  few years ago and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed living here. I think you guys will be too!!!"

And before you whine, yes, I am aware that actual gay people sometimes might call it the Gayborhood and that the phrase is so ubiquitous as to not be all that stigmatized.   Point being, times change, the neighborhood itself changed, and the new name reflects that."

philadelphia,3ck92l,Bryology,-2,Thu Jul 9 04:34:39 2015 UTC,"I see how you took that away from what I wrote. But I also tried to point out that it is not a highly stigmatized (read offensive) name.   ""Village"" already has the connotation of an area that celebrates alternative culture. So with the new name you get the positive connotations of the old name, without the negative ones.   Which name would you rather present to a prospective employer as your old neighborhood while interviewing for a new job in another state? Probably the new name."

There is the one off idiot, but that's even in San Francisco."
philadelphia,3ck92l,elltim92,5,Thu Jul 9 12:51:47 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has said, anywhere in Center City is great, but most neighborhoods will be fine for you as well.    I'd personally recommend South Philadelphia - I'd even recommend it over center city.  It's an area of the city that's growing exponentially, and has a lot of great neighbors and businesses.  East Passyunk especially has tons of bars, stores, and restaurants and has tons of gay residents.  There are more fun diversions and a LOT more diversity here now than in other areas of the city.  (Cambodian, Indonesian, Mexican, Vietnamese, all with amazing and usually inexpensive stores and restaurants to try!)  Point Breeze (where I live) is pretty gay-friendly, but might be intimidating for someone who isn't from the East Coast - it's definitely more budget-friendly than Center City or East Passyunk (my mortgage is almost a third of what you're willing to pay in rent), but there are definitely rougher patches than in the other neighborhoods.  As for accessibility from any part of South Philly, just stay reasonably close to the subway and your bf will have an easy commute to Drexel with a free transfer from the subway to the el, or a variety of buses depending on exactly where you live.  University City and Powelton Village (which are both on the eastern edge of West Philadelphia - are both very gay-friendly.  They cater to students but would be fine places to live.  These would be closest to school for the bf.  Fishtown/Kensington, even as far as Port Richmond (I assume you'll google the neighborhood names) have their own burgeoning culture, and the new residents are very gay-friendly, but the old-school neighbors are some of the nastiest in the entire city to gays and non-whites, as well as to anyone more economically advantaged than themselves.    Honestly, there are relatively few places in Philly where being gay would be a problem, I'd pick the neighborhood based on accessibility and what kind of lifestyle you're looking for (are you homebodies who want a big yard?  Then West Philly; are you more into nightlife?  Then South Philly or Center City, etc)"
philadelphia,3ck92l,danbiking,3,Wed Jul 8 18:04:39 2015 UTC,"As a former Drexel student, I would hate to live in south Philly and have to commute to Drexel. Maybe after his BF graduates."
philadelphia,3ck92l,lolaliveshere,2,Wed Jul 8 20:18:40 2015 UTC,I second this. For some reason the transfer to the EL makes it not worth it? Even though they run pretty frequently a transfer adds a little bit more time and thought to your commute.

There may be a few old folks in South Philly that wouldn't like it, but you won't hear from them. With the boyfriend going to Drexel, and liking ""Urban Living"" just shoot for Center City (including gayborhood) or University City.

Does your boyfriend like to bike or at least not mind biking to class? If so, go for a place closer to center city so you're closer to the cultural hub. If not, try to go closer to drexel or at least close to a trolley. You'll find plenty of nice places all around the city for 1600/mo"

I pay in the $2k+/month region for a luxe 1 bed + office apartment that is two blocks from the gay bars. I saunter outside my building and I have the region's best restaurants a few blocks away (Amis, Vetri, Veg, Morimoto, Sbraga to name a few), great bars, etc. Shopping is a less than 10 minute walk to Rittenhouse for stores like Vince, Barneys, Theory, Diesel, etc.  You will be walkable to almost everything if you live inside this square: north of Bainbridge St, south of Market St, east of about 20th St, and west of Front St (Delaware River).

There's a neighborhood called the Gayborhood and is the hotspot for nightlife, both gay and straight. They just painted these crosswalks for the summer but don't get hyped up, cause they already look like shit. There are tons of pride festivals, kink shows, drag shows, etc. whatever you favor. We also have a very extensive gay legal/advocacy network, including the Mazzoni Center. I work in the Gayborhood, and it's arguably one of the nicest areas of Philly and definitely one of the faster growing in terms of new restaurants and clubs. It's pricey around here though $2k would get you a very nice 2-bedroom though for sure. Parking would be another beast. I live in Fishtown where $2.5k gets me a 4-bed/4-bath with garage and backyard right near the El. Plenty of on-street parking available. I'd recommend this for you if you want to have some walkability and be close to the subway to get into Center City. Else, anywhere really in Center City would be open to you."

It is a very accepting neighborhood as others have already mentioned here.  It boasts beautiful Victorian/Italianate architecture, mature tree lined streets, trolly cars, and amenities surpassed only by Center City (but for a lot less money).  Two of the ritziest highrise apartments are there (3601 Market, finishing construction soon, has one-bedrooms around $1800-2000 with quartz countertops, subzero appliances, rooftop pool, etc).  3737 Chestnut , also under construction, is similar in amenities.  The victorian mansions would be on the edge of Drexel's campus in Powelton Village, as well as Spruce to Baltimore from 40th - 47th.

It's not in the gayborhood, but it is only a short walk away when you feel like being immersed. My address in Rittenhouse has a 100/100 walk score, so you should be good walking everywhere you need.  The whole Center City area is pretty liberal, I'd have no problems walking down the street holding hands with my boyfriend, but he's a little more reserved than me.  Probably wouldn't walk down the street like that in North Philly though. Stick with Center City (I recommend Rittenhouse Square area), and you'll find our city a very welcoming place.  I sure have.  Feel free to PM with any questions. Edit: Rittenhouse is also a very walkable distance to Drexel. Just graduated from there myself, walked it plenty of times."

Sometimes (while it seems ass-backwards) a truck with a delivery going x number of miles away is the one that'll be in the area of your delivery soonest. So rather than wait an extra few days for a truck to be going straight to where you need it to go, they put it on another truck that'll be passing by there on its route."

Now I can't say exactly why this happened, especially since the Horsham hub does not typically deliver to Philadelphia. It looks really fucking odd, but I have an idea.  The Oregon Ave facility misloaded onto a truck going to Harrisburg. It may have been caught there, but misloaded again and got sent to NJ, who was like ""wtf m8"" and sent it to Horshan (since we get NJ packages a lot). Horsham got it, and we decided to just drive it down to you because we get shit done here.  Alternatively, the tracking system just got fucked."

It is important to know what your bike is. Are you riding a beater to the trail just to run, or are you thinking about locking up a $1000+ machine to continue your workout? If I were to do what you want to do, I wouldn't worry about locking up a commuter bike. If you do have any sort of value to or on your bike (Garmin, PowerTap, carbon wheels, etc), I would keep it locked in your SUV. I've seen people cutting expensive hubs out of wheels locked in the city personally. I guess a good rule of thumb for myself would be if it is a carbon or titanium frame, never lock it up longer than 5 minutes. If it is aluminum or steel, just consider the risk.   Risk of theft at all three of those locations is minimal, but still I wouldn't lock up my carbon bikes there."

philadelphia,3cfblm,skyecaptain,70,Tue Jul 7 13:50:20 2015 UTC,"You saw this coming: Professional Graphic Designer here!  So, I've done a few logos in the past, and because its only me, I tend to charge on a fairly low-end, or about 4 times more than what PWD paid back when they had an art student do this back in 1987.   The insane amount of work and effort that goes into a good logo is nuts, and considering the fact this was for a government agency, the price makes sense. If you're dealing with one client one-on-one, it can be either easy or a nightmare. When you're dealing with more than one person, it's already bad. When you're dealing with a team, it's going to be rough. When you're dealing with a department and their politics, it's hell. It also means that its going to be a month before you get to do anything solid.  Along with that, you also have to deal with the work you have to put aside for this job. You may have to turn down other clients, and that goes into the price. You're also not getting any cash back once that logo goes out, so it's a work-for-hire job.   You're assigned the job of deciding what the brand and logo is for a large company, a logo that may be around for over 25 years. You're going to invest a ton of time, money, and effort into working with a city agency that may have slow turnarounds all while keeping your lease, your employees, and everything else going.   Here's the other thing: What does the new logo include? For me, I can do a logo, but I also try to do the branding package as well which explains how to use the logo and proper use, which, if not done, ruins the logo and all the time and effort that went into it. They may not have designed the stationary, but they most likely decided how the logo should be applied to it. Same with all the signage, billing, website, etc...  There is an added plus: They used a local design agency, and that's always good. In this case, LevLane is located in the Wanamaker Building. The money is basically going to go back into the local economy, and fast.  Additionally, this is all part of a $300k re-branding using multiple agencies. I just saw they spent a good chunk for ""Design and Communications"", which may go into redoing their website.  So $65k for a logo sounds like a lot, and for most people and small companies it is. But for a large agency or company, that's just about standard.  EDIT: WOW! Thanks for all the responses and the gild! I'll also say this: I'm currently an out-of-work designer, so if anyone from an agency sees this and needs a designer, feel free to drop me a line."

Sometimes the designer is so skilled, they'll come up with an awesome, innovative design that makes it through with just a few tweaks. Other times the client beats the idea to a pulp, and after the 14th round, it's bland and boring.  Smaller companies, you appeal to a single person's sense of creativity. For larger companies, you appeal to the approval process, which is seldom forgiving."

philadelphia,3cfblm,my02,2,Tue Jul 7 18:03:21 2015 UTC,"The amount of money in these transactions doesn't bother me so much when the budget is in line with the scale of the business or client. What does is that many of these logos and branding reworks are either extremely basic or are ugly. Seriously, look at that JCPenney rebrand.  Besides general business management, I also handle most of my company's web presence and co-designed the logo. I can't draw at all. I'm terrible at it, despite taking several years worth of arts classes in school. But, I can throw some shapes together in photoshop and add some simple typography. These things seem to make up the vast majority of these expensive new logos that make the news. This first hand experience makes me very skeptical of these huge price tags on amateur looking work.  I'm not disputing that a true artist deserves a good payday when he or she has to deal with dozens of hours of bureacracy and back and forth. But, it's really sad to see these basic types of logos and branding and then try to see people justify the cost. This isn't something like where if you choose the amateur a bridge or building may fall down. So, pro level artists, designers, and firms genuinely have to make a better product, not merely ""get it done despite the bureacracy.""  Hell, you could go on Fiverr or various websites where artists compete to make a logo and spend a tiny amount. You may have to pay a bit more to get the high res files. You may have to pay someone to organize it onto letterheads or your website. Most of them may be awful, but I suspect that many, many of them are going to look as good or better than these professional works that make the news. It's not going to be $60k, 100k, 350k that we see time and time again.  I also completely understand that sometimes clients choose ugly. They do. I've seen it. But, there needs to be some actual quality difference if you're charging tens of thousands of dollars. It needs to stand on its own and not make others think, ""yeah, I can get Joe's kid to make something like that."" Whoever is in charge of that decision at PWD may not have known that, but that's that's the reality in today's world. When such a plain and simple logo comes out maybe it should be priced accordingly, especially when taxpayers are paying for it."

A: because there are industries built around this type of work, its standard practice!  i totally get that these activities are the lifeblood of many people and firms and large parts of the local economy. but lets not fool ourselves into thinking these are anything other than a dressed-up version of a white-collar jobs program."
philadelphia,3cfblm,RedHotBeef,5,Tue Jul 7 17:38:56 2015 UTC,"What you're seeing is a very common trait of creative industries. A successful idea can be the result of a considerable amount of research, testing, editing, and repeat from a team of experienced experts, or it could be conceived mostly in whole from thin air from someone not at all experienced or previously successful in that field. Some hit songs are written by people paid thousands of dollars to write it, others are written by high school kids after school.  It's impossible to know for certain whether or not a creative idea will be successful (or marketable) before it is presented in earnest. People who are experienced and successful in a given creative field are more likely to create or successfully recognize successful and marketable ideas in that field. That's the point of specialization.   If a company/organization does not feel confident creating their own successful marketing materials and design, they are looking to buy that service from an expert in that field who can provide them two big things: confidence and liability. Thus that market is grown.  Yes grown. Not magically appeared with a bunch of empty dress shirts to be filled with white necks, but cultivated over time as successful and unsuccessful marketing activities separate individuals and firms who can create and recognize potentially successful and marketable ideas from individuals and firms who cannot.   As the experience, renown, and value of a given firm's marketing activity increases, so too can their rates, as long as there remains demand at that price point. And when your potential client pool reaches the likes of multinational corporations and governmental agencies, there exists exceptional ability for high asks to be met.   Hope this helps!"

philadelphia,3cfblm,markskull,2,Tue Jul 7 20:52:45 2015 UTC,"I'll give you the short version:  Essentially, there isn't.   A student came up with the Nike ""swoosh"" logo. They had a design contest with kids for the current American flag. When I was in college, I actually did design work for Megadeth.  The difference between me then and me now? Bills, time, realizing what I'm worth, and a lot of knowledge and understanding about design.   While the design by everyone (myself included) were picked by their respective companies, they still had to hire another designer to clean it up and make it perfect. So while PWD paid $250 for their original logo, I wouldn't be shocked if they wound up shelling out a bit more money to clean it up and make it professional.  TL:DR; The difference is that a college student may come up with an awesome idea, but a professional designer still needs to clean it up and make it print-ready. You save money since you don't have to pay a professional to come up with all the ideas."
philadelphia,3cfblm,thegrumpyhypnotist,2,Tue Jul 7 21:29:58 2015 UTC,"So while PWD paid $250 for their original logo, I wouldn't be shocked if they wound up shelling out a bit more money to clean it up and make it professional.   certainly a possibility, along with the general possibility that the article is designed to induce outrage among the commoners, as usual, by providing a selective version of reality that fits the easy dollar-figure comparison lede. so either this article provides another example about the crumminess of ""journalism"" these days, or is in fact an accurate depiction... either way, the end-goal of pageviews driven by indignation is achieved, everybody wins!"

philadelphia,3cfblm,exileonmainst,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"it's the reddit ""designer"" circlejerk. happens frequently here. a post will ridicule the absurd cost of a logo or something, and the art degree having, design-apologists will rush to defend why it's perfectly justified and why it's evil to let someone do it for free (even though there are tons of people who are willing and able to do it for free).   design firms get away with charging these fees because huge corporations with tons of revenue think in terms of millions and not hundreds. of course $60k is a rip, but to a company with billions, it's not worth arguing about. what gets me is the design crowd rushing in to defend the idea that it's worth it, when people can provide it for free.  also, even if you think designs are ""worth it"" because they will increase revenue or something... this is the water department. if you live in philly and want water, you literally have no other choice. they are the only provider and you have to accept their rates and terms. what is the point in them having a nice fancy logo created by some design firm?"
philadelphia,3cfblm,thegrumpyhypnotist,-2,Tue Jul 7 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"yup, you nailed it, this dynamic is very apparent, and pretty funny in the context of a municipal entity. the weird thing is, its no problem for people to want to get paid as much as possible, no need to go thru mental hoops justifying the farcical idea that a $60k logo is better than a $250 logo (remember we are talking strictly about the logo as described in the article, not the related marketing services, which cost even more)... in fact the value provided to the parties involved, simply in terms of CYA, would make the whole thing sensible, although still questionable in terms of public benefit, but who cares about them.  meaning: if someone in the dept. went nuts and decided to just go the Fiverr route and ended up with a mediocre logo, then surely they'd get so much crap dumped on them from their higher-ups, who would wonder why they didn't go the standard route and spend enough (its safer to choose IBM). it is the classic agency problem appropriately applied to a public agency. the absurdity is found in the attempts to justify it.  ps. in no way am i downplaying the importance of marketing or branding or logos. there used to be a place called ""pikkles plus"" that had the most hideous clockwork-orange type font as their logo, im sure they were good b/c they were around for years before going out of business, but i refused to step foot in the place because of that font.. just puzzled by the applicability of this sort of thing in the PWD public utility scenario."

It's insane that I have staff handling paper bills and mailing out checks every month for dozens of properties instead of being able to manage it online.

I regularly have several hundred dollar bills because they change account numbers for new meters and don't transfer past payments over or other completely unexplained phenomena. They've sent a couple bills for several thousand dollars because they decided all of the sudden that old satisfied water liens from the prior owner still existed. I can't worry about having them autodeduct that and then have to fight to get it back.   PWD has gotten very sophisticated with how they manage storm water on new development projects and they've rolled out major infrastructure like the Venice Island detention basin, so it's clear they have some intelligent, forward thinking people working there. There is just no excuse for their retail side to remain so antiquated."

I just don't get why everyone is up in arms about a cheap logo redesign when PWD has a 100 year turnover for fixing pipes. I actually work for the Water Dept, $62k isn't even a drop in the bucket.   And before you ask: ""Well it's a public utility why did they need a new logo""? Plenty of other utilities do this. In 2010, DC WASA changed to DC Water with a new logo."
philadelphia,3cfblm,envriogis,0,Tue Jul 7 17:55:08 2015 UTC,Just because other utilities have done it does not mean it's a good way to spend money.

philadelphia,3cfblm,redwoodser,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"As I said, I work in the Water Dept. $62K is barely enough for conceptual planning for main replacement.  And yeah, it may seem questionable as to why they updated the logo, but other utilities are doing it. PWD does more than just advertise to water customers in Philadelphia. They publish papers, have people speak at conferences, and are generally being mentioned (for better or for worse) around the nation and the world. So they want to have a modern looking logo to go with the press."

Adventure to Santa was their replacement for waiting in line for Santa.  They would send 8 kids and their families into this little ""adventure"" at a time.  First room was pre-story, second room was a buffer room for waiting for people to get out of the third room, third room was a 4D ride, fourth room you went into to play games on touch screens, and then they sent kids one by one to see Santa in the fifth room.  It was nice and immersive for little kids but I wouldn't have paid more than the inflated cost of the pictures and merchandise.  But it was really nice and magical experience because it gave kids family time with Santa and his elves without hundreds of peering eyes.  It would also be extremely nice for those with young kids that will get distracted by all the noise so you don't have second guessing about dropping $50-100 on pictures, another $35 on a stuffed animal and movie related to the experience, plus $25 on a nice picture frame.  As for something similar to it but for no real reason and costing $50 per person before merch and pictures?  Hell no."

Then after all that, it's not your EV spot; its legal for any EV to park there (although any decent charger can be set to require an authorization code, so at least they won't be skimming your juice for free as well).

philadelphia,3chpyj,ViperRT10Matt,3,Wed Jul 8 00:32:42 2015 UTC,"For some it's economically worthwhile when you take into account the cost of a parking space.  Instead of paying ~$200/month for a parking space, one pays a one time lump sum plus the yearly fee that ends up paying off in under 2 years.  Also, depending on neighborhoods, houses with garages cost thousands more.  A dedicated EV spot is a good compromise to no garage."

philadelphia,3chpyj,CyberianSun,-2,Wed Jul 8 03:46:27 2015 UTC,"They are also a massive strain on the current grid architecture, and do not actually reduce carbon emissions here in the north east as you are just trading one source of carbon emissions for another."
philadelphia,3chpyj,ViperRT10Matt,2,Wed Jul 8 12:49:22 2015 UTC,"Not remotely true. They charge primarily at night when there's shittons of excess grid capacity.  In the worst case scenario, EVs run on 100% coal end up being about equal emissions-wise with an average car.  However coal only accounts for 1/3 of our area's generation. The rest is much cleaner nat gas and exponentially cleaner nuclear. Even with battery manufacture accounted for, EVs run far cleaner in our area than even the best gasoline cars."

If you penalize electrics for the creation and transmission of their ""fuel"" but then only take into account tailpipe emissions on the gasoline side, the study immediately loses any credibility.  Here's a more comprehensive study that has not been completely debunked (and still errs on being conservative):  http://cleantechnica.com/2014/09/19/electric-cars-greener-course-getting-greener-every-day/"

philadelphia,3chpyj,CyberianSun,0,Wed Jul 8 18:40:27 2015 UTC,I do still think EVs are an inherently flawed technology and is a bit of a dead end though. By its very nature an EV is an energy storage unit rather than an energy generation unit that an ICE (internal combustion engine) I honestly think hydrogen fuel cells or that synthetic fuel that Audi is developing are going to be the true future.

British food had a bad reputation in the 70s & 80s because it was, safe to say, not very good. Nowadays, modern London  has some fantastic, Michelin-starred restaurants serving modern British cuisine. Yes - Britain isn't known for food in the same way France or Italy is. But that doesn't mean it's garbage. Just because something isn't exceptional doesn't relegate it to being awful.   As an aside, I used to be a part owner of a restaurant in Islington, London.

An unelected monster, as it has done for centuries, is playing with the world, torturing some, and plundering others, or both.  The West, in a final act of arrogance, has somehow confused itself with its own concept of God. It has decided that it has the full right to shape the planet, to punish and to reward, to destroy and rebuild as it wishes.  This horrible wave of terror unleashed against our planet, is justified by an increasingly meaningless but fanatically defended dogma, symbolized by a box (made of card or wood, usually), and masses of people sticking pieces of paper into the opening on the top of that box.  This is the altar of Western ideological fundamentalism. This is a supreme idiocy that cannot be questioned, as it guarantees the status quo for ruling elites and business interests, an absurdity that justifies all crimes, all lies and all madness.”  “As Noam Chomsky pointed out:  Americans may be encouraged to vote, but not to participate more meaningfully in the political arena. Essentially the election is a method of marginalizing the population. A huge propaganda campaign is mounted to get people to focus on these personalized quadrennial extravaganzas and to think, “That’s politics.” But it isn’t. “  http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/05/23/down-with-western-democracy/"

It is very likely that George Washington had defensive positions in that area and that there was some serious fighting back in 1777.   You probably noticed that the river is deep there. It was deep back then and the British knew that too. They also knew that Washington had the bridge at Chadds Ford defended. So they walked several miles up stream past where the east and the west branch of the brandywine converge. With the help of some loyalist locals as guides they crossed the river where it is knee deep and attacked Washington's north flank.   To conceal their plan a regiment of British soldiers did march directly on Chadds Ford. Washington assumed those were the complete forces of the enemy so he did not reposition his troops until it was too late.   The British marched on to Philadelphia, which was the capital of the nation at the time, and Washington spent the winter in Valley Forge.   There is a cemetery up the hill from the river on the grounds of a Quaker Meeting house where some of the dead from the battle were buried.  They are still there today.  Edit: grammar"

I wouldn't bother looking in North Liberties (everything is over priced at this point anyway).  In regards to finding a lively/social location, Fishtown is a good starting point - its adjacent to Northern Liberties (which is has plenty to do) and Fishtown has it's own fun things going on.  Manyunk has a good social scene, but A) its mostly college kids, B) it might as well be a suburb because of its geographic location in relation to the ""downtown"" area, and C) all the shitty things that come with item A.    You may want to look in the area around Spring Garden St. between 13th and 7th, and Girard and Callowhill.

He interrupted a regular caller who was discussing potential Flyers coaches and Josh talked over him about the two loneliest things in the world must be the end slice of a loaf of bread. Then he hung up on him.   And I think it was the day after the NBA draft, Josh trolled for 2+ hours. I tried tuning in and he was still going.   I think compared to other hosts like Glen & Ray who bring up compelling topics that I find Josh to be lacking. I don't like the race baiting at all either.

What a mistake not keeping them together. I always thought they should be the morning show.  I don't listen to WIP aside from the off chance I listen to Innes and Bruno, solely because I enjoy Bruno.

I prefer 97.5's morning show over Angelo and the Snooze Team, but I'll take Josh and Bruno over Mikey ""Victor Cruz is over"" Miss any day. Didinger and Macnow's show on weekend mornings is the best pairing in the town, though, and the only place you'll find consistent, intelligent sports discussion."
philadelphia,3cghrp,Mister__Crowley,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:46:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed about Glen and Ray.  Actually a buddy of mine would refer to Anthony & Rob's show as the Afternoon Echo Chamber.   Josh not being from here is a double-edge sword. He can offer fresh perspective which is sorely needed, but he can't reminisce or relate to anything that's happened with the teams. Can't apply any fond memories yet, and it's even harder for him to do now since most of the teams are below par."
philadelphia,3cghrp,ChandlerMc,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:33:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I'm not really interested in reminiscing about the pasts of teams. Outside of a handful of championships, each team has had prolonged periods where they are not good or barely a contender."

philadelphia,3cghrp,DocShadeball420,6,Wed Jul 8 21:58:54 2015 UTC,I liked Innes at first. Thought he was kinda funny and different. But now he just sounds desperate and sad. His days here are numbered.
philadelphia,3cghrp,brk1,2,Tue Jul 7 20:01:14 2015 UTC,"GET OFF MY LAWN, that's my thoughts.   He's hilarious, and he's been a pretty quick learn of the sports atmosphere here.   Race baiting? Are you kidding me? He was making the same ""jingle footed"" joke that half of the message boards were making. He was also one of the first people to actually call out Chase Utley on his shitty play while Howard was getting blasted, and stayed away from the race angle until a caller mentioned it.   And that's not even getting into the sad fact that hearing about the teams is fucking depressing at this point. It's a slow news period for football, the Phillies are shitty AND boring, sure we get to see Okafor now but that only just happened, and the NHL pretty never gets mentioned.   And like he mentions all the time...if you want to talk sports, then call up and talk sports. It's not like WIP is taking calls from fucking Einstein anyway."
philadelphia,3cghrp,DocShadeball420,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:28:50 2015 UTC,"See I guess I simply don't find his brand of humor hilarious. Far from it. I dislike the trolling segments but as someone else pointed out in this thread that some callers are moronic enough that it warrants them being mocked. But I prefer less mocking and more picking apart arguments.   I still think he's an intelligent guy and far more calculated than he lets on. And when he really is deeply involved in a sports topic it's interesting. But I think I dislike other topics he brings up. He ranted about Stephen A. Smith a ton when that news was over and tired. He ranted about Caitlin Jenner for days and I just didn't care. Not that I was opposed to it. I was indifferent. It wasn't an interesting topic in the slightest to me so I'd turn off the radio or go to another station. And he does kind of suck with callers, though he has improved.   And come on, he is a race baiter. He brings up racially charged topics every chance he gets."

I prefer guys who provide more substance than polarizing opinions and rabble-rousing contrarians (like Missanelli).  Since 97.5 brought in Anthony in the AM (who can be annoying, but is LIGHT YEARS better to listen to than that skeez Cataldi) and Rob Ellis mid-day (who I enjoy listening to because he's smart and not trying to be Skip Bayless), I've been listening to 97.5 a lot more and enjoying it more...since Mike and Mike were okay but it was nationally focused and John and Sean were about the worst pairing in the history of radio"

The Phillies are awful and most fans would rather stick their heads in the sand for the next few years, Sixers and Flyers are off and Iggles won't be worth discussing until August.  WIP isn't ESPN radio either and being the homer city that we are, nobody's going to want to hear about the Royals or Cardinals, and certainly not soccer (men's or women's) or Wimbledon tennis.  I listened to a trolling bit last week and found it to be hilarious.  I guess it could get old if they pull it out all of the time though.  My dial is pretty much stuck on WHYY all day but I'll try and give WIP  more listening time in the office.  They seem to be #1 in their demo right now, so I guess they have that going for them."

And what you think about her is not the fucking point. You just assumed that I was defending her because your piece of shit brain drew some conclusions wrong. Well fuck you and your conclusions wrong.  What is the point is whether one person or many in the neighborhood with Blackwells help and the help of the D.A. and maybe even the Mayors people can stop the shit that’s been going on in that house for a long fucking time. I have no idea what’s been done thus far.  Telling the op to get rid of Blackwell is a delusional and childish response to a very serious and disturbing situation.  As someone wrote on the internet not too long ago  “anonymous Says: April 16th, 2015 at 11:40 am” “plain attacking her won’t help and calls for her to be replaced don’t seem reality-based either. The last time she had a challenger on the ballot she got something like 94% of the vote.” The op could give a fuck if you hate Blackwell.  I don’t give a fuck if you hate Blackwell. In fact nobody gives a fuck if you hate Blackwell. And you don’t even know if I hate Blackwell because it’s none of your fucking business. You’re just being an opportunistic reactionary piece of naysayer shit, which is exactly what I said many hours ago. And fuck you again."

The market is flooded with bootcamp grads with 3 months experience who are expecting a 6 figure salary based on their Twitter and Reddit clones. Pick a language, make a project of your own (or two), and be able to talk about it eloquently. You'll be better off than 99% of bootcamp grads.  If you want to get your feet wet in front end dev and/or Rails, check out The Odin Project. Philly's got such a huge and inclusive tech scene that you'll be able to find your way in no time, you just need something to show for it."

philadelphia,3cctfv,gphil,2,Tue Jul 7 14:34:50 2015 UTC,"I am a software engineer / entrepreneur who's been around for a bit, and have experience recruiting and hiring software engineers.  I'd say the answer to this is really specific to one's situation. Do you have a college degree? Do you have significant experience in a business domain? What do your savings look like? How much do you want to make post-bootcamp? You don't need to answer these questions publicly, but they will all affect this decision.  We're researching the possibility of hiring boot camp grads, but we haven't seen enough of them yet to know if we would hire one. To date, I have only hired recent college grads and experienced programmers.   FWIW the market rate does seem to be lower for bootcamp grads than those who have CS degrees, and much lower than for experienced programmers (obviously.) However I (and many others) rate experience over formal education so this may only matter earlier in your career. Actual shipped products that you can point to in a portfolio are the most valuable thing you can have in terms of getting an engineering job IMO. If you want to advance within the field to more of a management position, many firms will want to see at least a college degree if not an MBA."

I'd really hate to go to college. I would hope to do my own thing one day + I feel like the cost of tuition would be a serious hinderance on that.

The best way to learn how to program is to figure out how to solve a real problem you have. Free resources on the internet are sufficient for this if you put the effort in.  I recommend you figure out how to automate some tedious aspects of the research/analytics you are doing now using your programming language of choice (don't ask for permission, just do it, you will be more efficient at your job in the long run.) Then down the road you can point to this automation as bona fide programming experience, which is very valuable."

I've found that beginning Javascript 4th edition and rubytutorial.org have been really useful for me as a beginner.

Did you make your website in CIS 0835? You can almost throw that experience out the window; class is a joke.  I'd definitely start with HTML and CSS, it's easy to get the hang of.  Afterwards Javascript + jQuery.   If you want to be a front end developer you should really just master skills relating to HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.   Despite /u/porkchameleon 's distaste for Javascript frameworks they are a huge subject and you can do all sorts of cool things with them. jQuery makes pages function wonderfully and then once you're more acquainted AngularJS + node.js can take you more in depth than just front end.    I'm learning ruby + rails for backend right now but am considering taking a full javascript approach   Also, just like everything else the more experience you have the more it will make sense. I really like Javascript in comparison to Java or C# because there is a lot more instant gratification. You can make something a lot more simply in JavaScript + jQuery with some CSS than you can trying to build an Android app.   Oh, one other thing: Check out all of the different programmer meetups in Philly. They have a lot of speakers come in, seems like a lot of members. I'm definitely going to join PhillyJS"

philadelphia,3cctfv,mayor_of_bridesburg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:08:28 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Stallman coined the ""Free as in freedom not free as in beer""  Nothing stops you from selling GPL licensed sotware. You are just bound by the copyleft(e.g. you have to ""pay forward' you can't benefit from GPL software without opening your source for inspection) This always seemed largely reasonable for me otherwise its like buying a car with the hood welded shut.  Taking a ""never"" approach might be a bit hamfisted. There are always places where its applicable. Even Microsoft has released a few 10,000s of lines of driver code under GPL."

philadelphia,3cctfv,mayor_of_bridesburg,0,Tue Jul 7 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean.  http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html  excerpt:  “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software” to show we do not mean it is gratis."
philadelphia,3cctfv,nsfyn55,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"I am not nuanced on the gpl , but I prefer mit. Each version has more restrictions . They are bad right ?"
philadelphia,3cctfv,mayor_of_bridesburg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:47:43 2015 UTC,MIT is a GPL compatible license. I've never really looked that closely at it but it appears to refer to a suite of licenses that extend GPL minus the copyleft.   They are bad right ?   Bad is a relative term. Depends on what your ideological stance is.
philadelphia,3cctfv,mayor_of_bridesburg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:01 2015 UTC,Gpl is long. It's free speech. When someone takes a half finished project I  write I want it to be free. Who cares about attibution and naming
philadelphia,3cctfv,mayor_of_bridesburg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"Long? I'm confused again. I don't see anything about ""attribution"" in GPL resources except that it doesn't impinge on compatibility if your license(in this case your flavor of MIT) requires it."

You are calling children at play animals simply because you feel that they are inconveniencing you. These youth programs do a lot for children in the city, especially in the summer. You probably don't care because, these aren't your kids, but they will be your problem when these programs disappear because of people like you and these kids are left to their own devices. Also, 911 is not there for you to make someone get a pool out of the street in a situation like this. You should be charged for making erroneous calls.   my kids get plenty of exposures to other cultures. when it is safe and not a band influence   What? So, I guess your culture is just fine because it's always good, but other cultures are always sketchy, unless proven otherwise. I don't even understand how the parent comment's response warranted that response."

philadelphia,3cd0zz,HauntedBeepers,3,Mon Jul 6 23:25:56 2015 UTC,See this earlier thread which goes over it pretty well.  The TL;DR is a corporate desire to sell in the suburbs and to sell gasoline in the suburbs coupled with a disinclination to continue to pay rents or leasing fees on a lot they didn't own.

philadelphia,3cd0zz,furiousxgeorge,2,Tue Jul 7 02:14:19 2015 UTC,"Despite the flagship wawa being built, wawa clearly is moving away from the city stores.   Even in the suburbs wawa is changing. I really hate their new business model. In the past they would build within communities, away from shopping centers/major highways. Then the super wawas started to pop up on major highways with the gas stations. Now they're closing many of the smaller wawas within communities. All new wawas are built on major intersections. It's more of a pain driving into a high traffic area just to get coffee. I don't understand why they would abandon what made them famous. I understand they want to maximize profits, but if the small stores still make money (and they're always packed, so they must), why close them?"

These neighborhood changes don't happen over night. They take YEARS.   You are going to raise bigoted children. You want your neighbors to keep their kids off the street so you can the run of the block. This is not the way city living works. You have moved into an established community, where families are living in the same homes their parents were raised in, maybe their grandparents too, and you want them to change.   Your neighbors aren't racist, they just think you're an asshole. That's my guess. Now everyone here is going to think the same thing.   I bet you moved into a flipped row home, or maybe new construction? Either way, here's some news for you: you got ripped off. Kenzo is a cash grab right now and any asshole with a pick up truck and hammer is getting in on it. They are making a killing off of dumb sheltered yuppies like you.   Now, something constructive:   If you truly believe that you are doing a great job raising your children, then you need to trust them to make good decisions and do the right thing. Shuttering everyone else on the block on their homes is not how communities grow and get better."

Same applies to the homophobes who are so against gays for non religious reasons.  Generally in my experience are projecting their own fight with homophobic temptation.  So they are all proud they can fight the urge to bang another dude, and think gays are gross and weak. But in reality they are fighting urges the rest of us don't even have.   Hence their fixation on the issue."

Let it dry over the course of many days or maybe a week and if it maintains its shape and does not warp at all or downwards you are fine fine. If so, prime the drywall if it’s a little discolored and paint your color. Sometimes if it’s warped from a bit from water you can with screws and some force applied on it, again after it's very dry, make the drywall find its original shape, ie flat, but this works only if your screws find wood to sink into, and do not all pop through the uncooperative drywall when the force and screws do their thing. For that job you might need a stud finder, unless there are some markings  in the drywall that indicate where the previous row of screws or nails were located, which is a small hand held battery operated device that is placed on the wall or ceiling and moved across the surface until it beeps when it finds wood immediately behind  drywall."

It says that PATCO stops at 8th and Market and I should pick up BSL there and take it to Germantown Ave and Erie Ave, where I get on the 23 bus.   Why doesn't it suggest 11th and Locust like what you've outlined? I'd much rather only have to hop on 2 vehicles than 3"
philadelphia,3ca0k8,x3leggeddawg,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:10:36 2015 UTC,BSL runs on broad street. That's between 15th and 13th streets. Patco drops you off at 15th. Why Google tells you to walk from 8th is kinda silly.
philadelphia,3ca0k8,okjkay,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:34:28 2015 UTC,"But if i can take the 23 right from 11th and Lotus, there's no need to get on BSL, right?"

The meme is relevant when people claim a person who was found on the wrong side of the law is a good person despite their legal trouble. When it is discovered that the person was a piece of shit based on historical revelation/social media, the echo of ""He didn't do anything"" rings because it is brazen. It is still racist because of the gross exaggeration of afro-american creole, but it isn't exactly coming out of left field.  No one was defending this guy, and no one would, because they slashed someone's throat. For fuck's sake.  Every time a black person makes the news for violent/dumb crime, the chorus of ""dindu nuffin"" roars across the memesphere.

It's obviously not the best part of the city, but I've never felt uncomfortable parking on the street or walking at all.  The venue inside is pretty cool. Good sight lines with a lot of variety. If you get there early and find out the opening band sucks, fuck it, there's a bar/lounge area behind the back bar you can hang out.  Upstairs is cool too if it's open. They don't open it for every show. Depends on ticket sales. Same thing with the stage, actually. They can move it back to accommodate more people or move it forward if the show didn't sell as well, which is kind of cool.  I generally enjoy my experience there. One show the sound was off and shitty but everyone has their off nights I guess."

Hopefully they will consider their own families while out on patrol or responding to a call, since we know some of the violent bully cops can't consider the lives of those they serve.

With your ridiculously simplistic & erroneous understanding of how unions work....it sounds like you're still there.   Public unions aren't good for anyone. They protect bad employees and hurt the community.    Unions don't ""protect bad employees"".  They protect all employees by ensuring management sticks to the contract.  You sound like the kind of person who thinks that all defense attorneys do is get criminals off the hook.  Until the day comes when you need one.  What you probably don't understand, is that most people....public union employees included.....don't like that asshole at work either.  The union's job is to ensure that management plays by the rules.  What you mistakenly see as ""protecting a bad employee""....is actually a failure on management's part.  Every public workplace has disciplinary procedures.  If the policy for action requires ""A, B, & C""....management can't just skip right to C.  So, yeah...while everybody knows ""Dave"" is a fuckup and would love to see him gone...we still have a vested interest in ensuring that the proper procedure is followed.  And it's not just big ticket issues like termination.  Management regularly tries to do things that it can't contractually do.....simply because it either makes their job easier, or they just don't want to do it that way.   ""We're running over budget on overtime....I'm going to give you comp time instead.""  BZZT!  No you're not.  ""I want a note form your doctor explaining exactly why you called out sick.""  Nope, you're not entitled to that.....you're only entitled to a note from my doctor that says I was unable to go to work.  Unions are not perfect...and not all unions are created equal.  However, if you're going to chide someone for having a high school mentality....don't display one yourself."

The commute from there you explained in 4 really sound ideal! Is Phoenixville too far out of the way? What about Norris/East Norris -- doesn't seem too far off route of my commute?  I noticed the Schuylkill River Trail, I def love to run -- I need to invest in a bike immediately after moving.

Revived, rebranded and rebooted, The Philadelphia Evening Post has re-emerged as a free vintage themed magazine in the city of Brotherly Love that shares the stories of Philadelphians throughout many generations.  This bi-monthly publication is dedicated to the preservation of Philly’s history, its heydays, and its current revitalization. From the birth of the nation to the present day, we thrive on readers feeling a sense of nostalgia and community with our magazine as we hope to portray the big city as a close-knit hometown.  We honor the history of our city by providing unique, personal perspectives, stories and memories through photos and writing, hoping to become a vital part of the Philadelphia community.  The Post seeks to uplift and inspire, making people proud of the city they’re from, live, work and visit. With a history as unique and rich as ours, this publication can’t help but attract everyone – from the millennials who swoon over Philly’s “cool factor” to the generations who made it cool in the first place. The Post bridges any generation gap.  It’s our responsibility to captivate readers with engaging narratives about the past, present, and future of the city, but the magazine wouldn’t be complete without the perspectives of our readers who share their own accounts of “what once was” in the city of Brotherly Love, thus encouraging photo and story submissions.  With its distinguished look alone, The Philadelphia Evening Post differs from daily and weekly publications because each issue is made to last. Published every two months, just six times a year, The Post is, by nature, designed as a keepsake for readers to hold onto and collect long after they’ve flipped through its pages. Why is that important? As each issue lingers weeks, even years after its been published – so do the ads.  Supported solely by ad revenue, our advertisers are our family. Without them, we don’t exist. It’s our job to make sure those businesses benefit from our presence in their community. That’s why we encourage our readers to shop, eat, and play local.  The Philadelphia Evening Post is exclusively distributed to establishments that advertise with us in addition to being spread thin throughout the city’s coffee shops, cafes, libraries and schools. Aside from publishing quality work, serving the community is one of the magazine’s top priorities. From volunteer work to supporting the efforts of nonprofits, The Post and its staff strive to be a positive influence on Philadelphia."""

philadelphia,3c1l5x,uint_8,15,Fri Jul 3 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"Be confident. Take up the whole lane if you have to; in Center City you'll be riding comparably fast to traffic. Don't ride on the sidewalks, and don't go through red lights.  Try to find a path with a bike lane, even if its a slightly longer trip. Trust me, your trip will be a lot less stressful and you won't have to deal with drivers on your tail. Spruce and Pine are great bike lanes to get across the city. Bike around the city late at night or in the morning. You'll get to learn the ins-and-outs of the city, and its super fun. Here's a map of Philly's bike lanes http://bicyclecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bike-Map-2014_reduced.pdf  Watch out for people opening their doors if you're riding alongside parked vehicles. People will often not look and almost knock you off your bike. I know it sounds stupid, but a bell on your horn can be super useful at alerting people to your presence.  Get a u-lock as well as something to lock up your tire. If you don't lock up your front tire, it will likely get stolen. And wear a god damn helmet! That's the best piece of advice I can give."

philadelphia,3c1l5x,_idgie,3,Sat Jul 4 13:13:48 2015 UTC,I may be insane but I love using Bainridge to cut across the city. It doesn't have a bike land but it's has fewer cars than the other streets and is mostly stop signs all the way. Get a mirror on your helmet or handle bars and if you see a car I let them pass at the next block. I take this Wednesday nights to get comic books and it's always so easy and very few cars. Lombard back is great because it is two lanes and you can use the whole right lane without causing much problem for drivers.

philadelphia,3c1l5x,twizz71,5,Sat Jul 4 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"As a fellow central-Virginian (Charlottesville), welcome to Philly! When I lived there last summer bicycle was my primary means of transport, and I too was a little nervous about biking in a big city. Don't be!  1) City Center (well really everywhere between Spring and South) is incredibly conducive to bicycling. Except for Market (where speeds are a little faster) the street lights are timed for a car driving ~20 mph, which while slightly inconvenient to motorists, is idyllic for city bicycle commuting. You'll find that across blocks you will consistently hit all greens and regularly pass cars that get stuck at lights. Because of this light pattern, cars also drive at speeds that are not very intimidating.  2) Your route is going to depend a bit on personal preference. Nearly every east-west road in this section will be relatively easy to bike on except Spring (car speeds are too fast and the route is ugly anyways) and JFK blvd (again the speed). Google maps recommends bikers shoot down either Race or Pine to go from Old City to Drexel. I would strongly recommend a south-of-City Hall route like Walnut, Spruce, or Pine. Do Walnut if you want the hybrid of tall buildings and historical architecture, and Spruce/Pine (or even Lombard if you want to go a further block south) for a more intimate, less trafficked, higher tree cover route. As a totally different alternative you can also shoot down Market. That will put you right through the center of the city, which is bad only insofar as you eventually have to circle around City Hall. But Market is a great street if your prefer urban scenery, and the higher speeds of cars shouldn't deter you--bicyclists get their own car sized lane that is just for them, right turners, and busses. Also less of a chance of dooring on Market.  3) Be assertive. You have a right to the road and to a lane. Hand signaling is very important in conveying to drivers your intentions, and I found that 99/100 drivers respected my movements.  4) As long as you are safe about it, lane splitting is a great and important way to maintain your safety for preparing to enter intersections.  5) I would discourage blowing through red lights, but the one-way grid system and high visibility at most intersections should give you the ability to (cautiously) roll through some intersections at some times of the day. Ditto for stop signs. I know this is a controversial claim with some people and you should recognize that this is illegal, but I'll go to bat for Idaho Stop any day of the week.  6) On the flip side, don't bike on sidewalks. Seriously. They are for pedestrians and there's just no reason to.  7) Don't salmon and bike against traffic. The one-way grid means sometimes you'll need to travel the extra block to get going in the right direction. Go the extra block. Salmoning is the best way to kill yourself and even if you don't harm yourself you are still causing major stress to drivers and damaging the reputation of the cycling community.  8) Bike helmets are optional but I'd recommend it.  9) Bicycle security. This one is a doozy. Always lock your bike with a medium thickness U-bar. Always (when possible) loop this U-bar through your frame AND front tire. You should also travel with a cable lock that you loop around your back tire and through the U-Bar. If you don't break your bike down very often, go to a shop and get them to properly secure your seat and your front tire by swapping out the easy-remove bolts for anti-theft ones. Be aware of what you lock your bike to; there are decoy sign posts that can actually be lifted out of the ground. Don't leave your bike out overnight, and never, ever leave it somewhere for multiple days.  All of this sounds really dramatic but I've never seen a place where thieves are as talented, aggressive, and quick as Philly. I one time didn't lock my front tire as I loaded groceries into my apartment in the late afternoon, came back to my bike and found it gone. They are that good.  Philly is an absolutely amazing city and I miss it dearly. Have a great time and enjoy everything it has to offer!  Side note: your route is really easy to take by SEPTA. Obviously I'm a huge proponent of bicycling, but that's also a great, cheap, and easy alternative"
philadelphia,3c1l5x,kyleg5,2,Sat Jul 4 13:53:38 2015 UTC,"Idaho stop:       The Idaho stop is the common name for a law that allows cyclists to treat a stop sign as a yield sign, and a red light as a stop sign. It first became law in Idaho in 1982, but has not been adopted elsewhere.  A limited form of the law called ""Stop as Yield"", that deals only with stop signs, has expanded to parts of Colorado and been considered in several other states. Advocates argue that current law criminalizes normal cycling behavior, and that the Idaho stop makes cycling easier and safer and places the focus where it should be: on yielding the right-of-way.  Opponents think it is less safe because it violates the principles of vehicular cycling and makes cyclists less predictable.

So, if you have a bike with knobby tires, get Mr tuffy strips to line the inside of the tire.  If you have slick tires, get both Mr tuffy strips AND tire savers, which are a really old school device that really works.  The only place that sells them in the city that I know of is Via Bike, at 9th and south streets.  They are cheap and Curtis will show you how to attach them.

It is not an enormous savings, but it's usually 10-20%, which can add up if you need a lot of work. Also, if a major procedure you need is one of the ones they need for their year-end tests, you will get it for free (and may even be able to haggle a bit to get them to throw you $ ""for your time""--when it comes to the tests, they need you and will throw you a little cash to make sure you're there). And, honestly, their work is on par and often better than many seasoned dentists. They pay a lot more attention, have a lot more oversight, etc."

That being said,it's not without it's horror stories-I had a tooth that needed a root canal. Another student used me for his root canal final, was a total asshole to me, didn't numb me effectively,and as my regular dentist found out later,filled my tooth with gauze instead of amalgam. When the teacher and my regular student found the gauze,they were pretty embarrassed,  but the student who did it had already graduated so they couldn't do much to him"

Dentistry is healthcare profiteering and therefore the costs are inflated. If you pay off the care credit within in the time frame (I think it's 18 months) it is interest free.

I have to go to two different stores to buy liquor and beer in PA. If I go to a grocery store, I can only buy a 12 pack. If you try to buy two they will ask you to go to your car first and come back, Just recently, they allowed beer distributors to sell 12 packs themselves, previously you had to buy 24 packs, even if what they were selling only came in 12 packs. This is really more on beer but some of these laws are absurd and likely hurt beer sales, which includes craft beer sales.   If I want Liquor, I have to go to a state run store, and I myself couldn't open up a store and sell it in PA. And a lack of competition(all other things equal) generally means higher prices and/or lower quality products, so it's not hard to see how actual competition as opposed to a state run chain could lower prices and increase the availability of it.  And honestly, the only reason they probably still have the state stores is because of the revenue they gain which helps them stay in office, and because the union workers* who work for it don't want to lose their job.   And I couldn't* care less about a union that uses fear mongering (from a commercial against privatization, ""It only takes a little bit of greed to kill a child,"") to keep their jobs."

Quality is completely dependent upon the many different brands they sell.   so it's not hard to see how actual competition as opposed to a state run chain could lower prices   It might not be as clear cut as that. The PLCB is one of the largest alcohol buying powers in the country. Only 7 or so purchase more.

And I would find it ironic if that was the intended goal of state sponsored liquor stores.    Quality is completely dependent upon the many different brands they sell.   Yep, which is why that was a general statement about monopolies rather then the particular's of the PA liquor industry.    It might not be as clear cut as that   I'm not really trying to say it's clear cut. But it's unlikely that private businesses couldn't provide the same/similar or even better level of service(for lack of better word) in the long run.

The PA stores that sell beer (whatever they're called here- weird they only sell beer) would have a hard time keeping up. The most interesting thing about it was that no one ever had the amount of stock of beer available Until the laws were relaxed.

philadelphia,3bvsby,NeuralAgent,4,Fri Jul 3 00:19:39 2015 UTC,"It honestly confuses me why there are such restrictions on alcohol purchases here.   It started out because at the time that FDR repealed prohibition, we had a pro-prohibition Governor, who decided that if alcohol couldn't be illegal he was going to make it as damn close to illegal as he possibly could. It's been maintained since because sales are run by the PLCB through the state stores, so it's both a direct revenue stream for the state and you've got unionized state employees to deal with.   Most normal folks have wanted it changed for a while, our politicians are just obnoxiously slow to catch up.

Are you positive that the sign was the only indication that parking was prohibited?  I can't attest to your likelihood of success in winning your claim, but that's the route I would take.  Make sure you document where you were towed (picture of sign, curb cut, etc.).  As far as damage to your car - you signed the waiver without inspecting your car, so you might be out of luck.  You can always try to argue that the towing company damaged your car, however, that's a matter of he said / she said.  It'll be up to the judge to choose who he/she believes.

I guarantee the towing company will say ""we didn't damage OP's car.""  So it becomes a he said // she said situation.  The fact OP signed the waiver only weakens his attempt to prove that the towing company did, in fact, damage his car.  Was it signed under duress?  Who knows.  That's something for OP to argue convincingly in court and the towing company could fight back on and have the judge decide.  Point is, this isn't about enforcement of the waiver - it's about OP having enough evidence to prove that the towing company actually damaged OP's car.  My point, which I didn't explain that well, was that"
philadelphia,3bvrtl,filladellfea,2,Thu Jul 2 23:37:01 2015 UTC,I did pay to have my car released and signed the receipt waiving them of responsibility of damage. The damage is small and didn't notice it until I got to work. What steps should I take here?   Take them to small claims court.
philadelphia,3bvrtl,KFCConspiracy,-3,Thu Jul 2 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"You looked for a loophole, thought you found one and then did what you wanted to do.  They didn't pay attention to the code re what size signs should be, put whatever sign up and then did what they wanted to do.  Sounds like it worked out worse for you.  The sign may not have met code but you were aware of it.  You CHOSE to ignore it because of some detail you found after researching it, while looking for a way around the law.  You got what you deserved.  Hope you learn your lesson."

They won't deny towing your car - but I guarantee they will deny the tow (whether justified or not) resulted in damage to your car.  The fact that the tow may have not have been justified doesn't prevent the towing company from saying the damage to your car resulted from something you or a third party did, not them.  Did they refuse to let you inspect your car before you could sign the waiver?  If so, you could argue that - but again - that's a matter of he said / she said.  Good luck resolving this."

Agyrol is synonymous with its chemical mild silver protein, manufactured in the chemical industry to pharmaceutical grade only, using denatured pharmaceutical-grade protein for ophthalmic application and elemental silver to produce the silver protein molecule. While employed with Mulford & Co. (which became Merck & Co.), the American physician Dr. Albert Coombs Barnes recruited chemist Dr. Herman Hille in Germany. They returned to the United States and left Mulford together to launch Argyrol, developed and commercialized by Barnes as Prevention Technology for use on mucous membranes to resolve local infections in mucous-membrane-lined organs, most widely publicized for its value to resolve gonorrhea infections and to prevent gonorrheal blindness and other pathogenic infections to the eyes of newborn infants.

philadelphia,3bwou1,das_unglaubliche,0,Fri Jul 3 16:28:10 2015 UTC,"If the leak is not from negligence, I don’t understand how you can be held responsible for it. What do the words on the lease say about damage and the various causes for it. Are there shit windows near the leak? Was the ceiling the ""source"" of a drip? Could water drip down the wall without you knowing? Can you offer to repair it yourself? A belt sander, 50 bucks, and a gallon of urethane, 25 is all you probably need.   The landlord is just fucking you over because he or she can, so far. But that battle is not the war.

philadelphia,3bwou1,surfnsound,0,Fri Jul 3 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"Well, OP stated that:   a maintenance worker told me he noticed damage to the floors while showing the apartment  it was likely occurring on a weeks-months time frame  this was the source of the damage   (in regards to the leaking toilet)  To me it sounds like negligence, if someone can briefly walk through with a potential tenant and notice the damage, that's something OP could have seen and reported.  OP do you think it's fair to at least pay a portion of the damages since you didn't care for the apartment enough to see that a toilet was leaking and causing damage for months? It may not be $1000 worth of damage but if I were in this situation I'd probably expect to be held partially liable.  If you think it really isn't your fault at all you can just take them to small claims court, no lawyer required, and if the judge agrees, you'll be off the hook and get your money back."

OP stated that, after the maintenance person pointed out the damage, they checked sinks/toilet/etc and found no leaks, but the toilet began leaking a few days later.  The implication I'm getting is that the damage was caused by something else, possibly something that happened before OP moved in, and the landlord is just blaming it on that so he can keep the deposit."

philadelphia,3bx6hd,lalakay,10,Thu Jul 2 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"Currently living pretty close to Center City and commuting to Wilmington every day. Definitely try to resist the temptation to live closer to work in Wilmington/DelCo. It's all a cesspool and you can have a life in Philly in spite of your 2 1/2 hour daily round trip commute. For instance:  I leave the house at 7:30, bike and catch the Wilmington Regional Rail (express train) out of University City at  7:45. If SEPTA is on time I get into Wilmington at 8:28, hop on a DART (Delaware's bus fleet) to Rodney Square and I'm in my cubicle by 8:40.   In the afternoon I leave my office at 4:22, catch the Rodney Square DART to get a 4:44 SEPTA train back to Philly. I'm back at University City around 5:40, and I'm home by 5:50.   Yes, you have that math right, I spend about 2.5 hours of my life commuting every day, on a GOOD DAY. If SEPTA is late, cancelled, I miss a DART bus, or a train stalls on the track because they often have to let Amtrak's pass, that number climbs pretty steeply. I routinely sit at the Wilmington Amtrak with no idea when a DART bus is going to come scoop me up. About twice a year some Delco idiot jumps in front of an Amtrak and I get stuck in Wilmington for 2+ hours.   That said, you can sleep, catch up on work, or just zone out and do whatever the fuck you want instead of having to drive. I play in a touring band and do legal work on the side and the shitty commute doesn't slow me down. I also wouldn't trade Philly for Wilmington, it's an awful city with virtually no redeeming qualities.   If you are working a 9-5, buy a Zone 3 trailpass ($163/month). There's a weird loophole where the Zone 4 is only required if you are commuting WLM>PHL in the morning.

Wilmington/Newark trains can be picked up at either of the center city, 30th street and University City stations.  The tax situation may not be that bad due to a recent supreme court ruling.

I was offered rooms for rent by coworkers when I worked down there, but would rather have commuted than lived there.

But you're also citing numbers that are in regards to the US as a whole- looking at Philadelphia specifically paints a wholly different picture.   In the US, the starkest difference in spending on schools between wealthy and poor districts is in Pennsylvania, and one of the poorest is Philadelphia.   Continuing to underfund or cut further funds from the district will only pour fuel on the fire. Schools that can't afford to fix simple maintenance issues also can't afford necessities, like nurses, books, supplies, etc.  Throwing the money at, or diverting it to, charter schools won't help the district either- they end up costing the district more per student.  And the teacher's union? Thugs? Are you confusing them with the SRC and/or Bill Green? Or the Republicans in the state legislature who have pushed for cutting funds to the district and also for more charters (including wanting 27 new charters greenlit in February)?"

philadelphia,3bwd43,nugget9k,0,Fri Jul 10 16:45:30 2015 UTC,"What a stupid list. The author was too much of a coward to include the Rocky statue, which isn't even art. It's a movie prop."
philadelphia,3but7y,jennynyc,5,Thu Jul 2 09:30:33 2015 UTC,"My first reaction to reading this is ""S. 4th has always been hot in queen village with rents reflecting that. FlyingKite needs to get a FuckingKlue.""   But then I read on and saw just what sort of ""hot"" they meant. The whole ""facelift"" they are gushing about can be summed up by the London-transplant owner of a boutique specializing hip designer shoes who brags about the street's increasing similarity to Williamsburg Brooklyn. I made it the second use of the word ""curated"" in referring the expensive shit these new stores carry before blood actually shot out of my eyes.  Everyone in this article who refers to this transition as a wonderful funky ""mix of old and new"" is deluded, a liar, or both. This isn't some grassroots revitalization or whatever euphemism people in the gentrification business like to use, it's hollowing out the heart of a community that was vulnerable and wearing its fucking corpse as decoration to play the role of an eclectic, Jane Jacobsian streetscape to play host to ""brooklynish"" boutiques and bars with draft wine.  Fabric Row doesnt even have all the socioeconomic baggage of Point Breeze- it was fairly nice to begin with. I'm all for opening up new shops when the market can't sustain existing businesses but what's planned for, and already happening to this neighborhood, is full-scale push by developers from a decent mid-income enclave to some upscale new-urban playground for transplants seeking the fancy bullshit they enjoyed in whatever dipshitville they last got priced out of themselves."

philadelphia,3brqmg,Rivster79,3,Wed Jul 1 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"The word Jazz actually derives from Jism and Jazz. In some African language, (I forget which), they are the same. Also, Funky derives from the sweat from sex that is different from the sweat from working supposedly. It probably contains more oxytocin which helps form bonds between humans and apes alike.

philadelphia,3brqmg,Beart8o,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:04:04 2015 UTC,"It isn't really the font. The font itself is awesome and actually reads well.  It's the designer, or most likely, the client who said, ""You know what would be cool? A guy playing the trumpet! Do you have any graphics like that?"" They sat around, picked out one that looked like an ""A"", called it a day.... and they just messed up.  The guys on a ladder, but because of how thin that ladder is and how skinny the clip art is, it doesn't read.  Damn."
