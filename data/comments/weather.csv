weather,3e2tc5,kairon156,5,Tue Jul 21 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"It's most likely connected to a strengthening of the negative Arctic Oscillation.  This is a pattern in the jet stream that allows large weather patterns to form, and (especially recently) remain in place over a long period of time.  If you think of the jet stream like a string encircling the northern hemisphere, a strong negative AO is like having a large standing wave (big ripples) on the string.  The jet stream acts as a boundary between the cold arctic air and the warm tropical air, so when the standing wave dips you get a large mass of cold air.  Since it's a wave, you'll see areas far to the east and west of you having the opposite types of weather (see Greenland and BC).  From the Wikipedia article (emphasis added):   ""In the positive phase, higher pressure at midlatitudes drives ocean storms farther north, and changes in the circulation pattern bring wetter weather to Alaska, Scotland and Scandinavia, as well as drier conditions to the western United States and the Mediterranean. In the positive phase, frigid winter air does not extend as far into the middle of North America as it would during the negative phase of the oscillation. This keeps much of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains warmer than normal, but leaves Greenland and Newfoundland colder than usual. Weather patterns in the negative phase are in general ""opposite"" to those of the positive phase."""
weather,3e2tc5,hbarSquared,3,Tue Jul 21 17:18:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thorough explanation and helpful link.  This might explain why much of western Canada is on fire. It would be nice if this effects our future summers by giving them a nice average temp of 20C. :)
weather,3e2tc5,BananApocalypse,3,Tue Jul 21 18:01:09 2015 UTC,"First of all, last summer was historically hot. In St. John's we typically average July mean temperatures of 20.1 deg C (source). However this July we have barely reached 20 C, and the average temperature has only been 12.9 C (source). Summers like this are uncommon, but not overly rare either. 2011 was similar.  I found an interesting article you might like: http://www.cbc.ca/news/multimedia/how-this-year-s-bitterly-cold-july-is-ending-a-hot-streak-1.3160183  This summer is cold compared to the past 15 years, but if you look at temperatures from 1942 to the mid-90's, it doesn't look too out of place.

Many of the homes and apartments built before 2000 do not have air conditioning, and people in those homes are really suffering.   I'm not an expert, but it seems when one coast line experiences a different weather pattern than the norm, the opposite coast line experiences the same in reverse.   Last winter, the east coast of the U.S. was buried under a ton of snow, and here in the Pacific Northwest, we had no snow at all, and rarely a day below 40F (4.4C).  We're experiencing a strong El Nino event this summer on the Pacific coast, so we are being told to expect a milder winter, but a more active hurricane season. I don't know how that will affect the Atlantic coast though."

If you have data on your phone, use it to keep up with active weather as you're traveling. There are still dead areas as far as coverage goes, so be looking ahead and be looking as you're traveling for dark clouds rolling up and such.   The maps on smartphones are handy for checking for alternate routes (drive at right angles etc.) or to see if maybe there's a town you want to stop in. It doesn't have to form a tornado to be dangerous to drive in; wind, water, and decreased visibility can make things dangerous on their own. Hail too. You can also look up local radio bands to keep up with what's going on.

Its trajectory shifts slightly toward center screen as it illuminates, seeming to suggest it isn't heavy. But it's still moving very fast, especially if it's as far away as that storm.  It's unclear whether or not it originated from the storm. While it's visible crossing the storm in the foreground, you can't see it emerge, though I suppose it could have traveled upward first.    EDIT (1): In VLC, I circled each time I saw the object (1-10 frames) up to it illuminating (frame 10).  Question marks denote levels of uncertainty, since certain areas of the video become darker and brighter at random. Note, it may have been traveling straight, but slight shakiness makes it hard to tell. Uncertain whether the object was behind or in front of foreground clouds.  EDIT (2): Video quality doesn't appear good enough to tell for certain if it passed behind the trees or dimmed in front, but I think behind is more believable.

The Phoenix radar actually is blocked to the south by a mountain, creating the V shaped hole in the ground clutter. The reason there is some reflectivity showing up in this application in the blocked area is because this is a composite image, made of multiple scans from 0.5 degrees and above. So while the 0.5 scan is being blocked to the south, other scans higher in altitude are clearing the block/mountain/whatever AND the ground clutter while picking up the storms, resulting in this radar image."

Anyone know exactly what those requirements would have been?"
weather,3ddzmy,driftless,8,Wed Jul 15 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"What it boiled down to (we lost our home in that tornado):  If you have insurance, FEMA would allow you to take a disaster loan. Yes, a LOAN for assistance.   If you didn't have insurance, you had two choices: take no help, or apply for the loan, and if you're income is below a certain amount, it would be a months-long wait for a grant. It was bullshit.   We were fortunate enough to have many family, friends, and our insurance to help us recover. FEMA was a joke, the Red Cross did help us with free food from their trucks during the week while salvaging. (The Salisbury steaks were DELICIOUS) Local medics gave us free tetanus shots, churches from around the region came with labor help, water, cooling towels, more food, and an ear to listen to us. Other groups had stations with cleaning supplies, gloves, batteries, gift cards to Walmart, Target, Walgreens, etc., toilet paper... It was amazing to see so many people help.   Up to a year after, we were still being invited to local places for food, water, toys, and right before Christmas a gentleman from New York got a list of the affected and donated $1000 to each family via gift credit card. Kevin Durant held a basketball camp that was free to the affected kids, and Blake Griffin held a fun day called Smile Moore for the families as well. We got a few free t-shirts, shorts and socks from that.   The help from FEMA was a joke, Red Cross was ok, but the most help came in the form of supplies, labor, and just the events that took our minds off of the losses."

Then, verify that a FEMA SAR team has verified the coordinates of your home as being destroyed or unfit to live in. If yes, you get a reloadable debit card with what you need for right now and a claim filed for later.  If no, they find out why you need assistance. Your neighborhood not destroyed but you can't get to it? A voucher for a hotel and $200 on a gas card.  It should really just be ""what do you need?"" You need four tickets on Southwest to fly to Seattle to stay with your Sister? Done. Next! You need a hotel 3 towns over and gas money? Done. Next.

weather,3ddzmy,GringodelRio,2,Thu Jul 16 06:03:26 2015 UTC,"As someone who volunteered for several years with the Disaster Action Teams of the American Red Cross, the stories I hear about the Red Cross piss me off. We were able to go to the scene of a fire or flood, and start issuing assistance right there. Vouchers for hotels, money on a debit card for food and clothing. An hour or two depending on the number of people. I remember going through and doing those assessments of people's homes. I had shirts that had what I called ""fire jizz"" stains on them, water from burned out buildings that always stank of smoke and would never come out.  I also operated on some of the ERVs as well (emergency response vehicles), and all those do is hand out gatorade, food, sometimes cleaning supplies.  But I do know that the ARC hands out direct assistance. I don't know each chapter's plans for a mass event like this, but in Arizona the largest we dealt with was an entire apartment complex, four buildings over 30 units, gone. And it took four hours to complete, but the assessments were done for each building, and then ID's were matched to each building, and people were given assistance based on the grade of the building which came from the worst-hit unit on the section of the building. If one half of a building was fine but smoke damaged, it got a 5/10 for example (habitable, usable, just not for a while), the occupant got enough to cover hotel for a few days and food/laundry assistance. 0/10 was ""gone"". They got more assistance and follow up assistance. Right there.  So any time I hear about chapters not doing what they should be doing I'm both pissed and perplexed. Although I have a feeling it has more to do with how things operate than actual malice. Big event? You have to go to the ARC shelter for assistance. They aren't coming to you. Most areas have at best 10 volunteers active on a DAT team at any given time. You got to meet them half way. They don't have the resources to go to each home. So when I read about people saying they never got much from the Red Cross, I ask ""Where were you?"" When they say ""home"", I say ""that's why.""  As far as donations, The Red Cross needs to do better about informing people that all donations go to the general fund, not to the specific emergency they want to donate to. Which may sound sucky to some people, but what they don't realize is that's how it should work. If it costs the Red Cross $2 million to aid X town who had a tornado, and they get $8 million in donations, they can't just start cutting $20,000 checks to people. Especially when a house fire in BFE Montana or a windstorm in Oregon causes people there to require assistance. The ARC needs to do better on informing people of this, but people should really stop expecting it to be otherwise."

weather,3dbt5h,iTim314,4,Wed Jul 15 14:03:36 2015 UTC,This was taken over Reno Co. Kansas on 7/13/15. Preliminary report from NWS classified it as EF-3
weather,3dbt5h,Mrs_Brisby,3,Wed Jul 15 07:44:32 2015 UTC,WE MUST GET CLOSER
weather,3dbt5h,apiratewithadd,8,Wed Jul 15 10:24:56 2015 UTC,"Thats what was so great about that tornado. It was hardly moving, and everyone was off work to take photos of it like this."
weather,3dbt5h,Dude_man79,2,Wed Jul 15 11:36:19 2015 UTC,It also travelled southwest like that Jarrell Texas tornado
weather,3dbt5h,apiratewithadd,2,Wed Jul 15 13:44:21 2015 UTC,A tornado traveling SW?  I wonder if it rotated clockwise?
weather,3dbt5h,Albiz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:03:29 2015 UTC,it was still a cyclonic tornado.
weather,3deqry,i_hate_the_yankees,12,Wed Jul 15 18:20:32 2015 UTC,My best guess is this is creating a shadow and so those really whispy clouds aren't lit up.  here's a mountain doing it
weather,3deqry,budgiebum,5,Wed Jul 15 18:23:14 2015 UTC,that was also my thought. Wasn't sure if I was missing something. Thank you! cool shot on that mountain too.
weather,3deqry,murm87,2,Wed Jul 15 18:33:32 2015 UTC,Isn't that Rainier?
weather,3de4gs,account_information,11,Wed Jul 15 15:42:39 2015 UTC,"TWC, now more than ever, chases the almighty dollar and has discovered that phrasing and presenting stories to be as extreme as possible means more eyes. Additionally, stories about destructive/bad weather inherently get more viewers, much like how local news shows tend to focus on crimes instead of positive stories. I think their main bias is towards sensationalism; I don't know that they're all that biased in any other meaningful way, though I don't watch a ton of TWC and therefore could be wrong.  It's not great, but I have bigger issues with TWC, such as when they show reality programming, especially during severe weather, or that they've made their website a haven of clickbait, non-weather related content, or their silly winter storm naming that's opposed by many non-TWC meteorologists.  They also have shown some signs of turning the ship around a little, such as their agreement with DirecTV to reduce the quantity of reality programming and shows that are actually about weather like WX Geeks."
weather,3de4gs,mesocyclonic4,3,Wed Jul 15 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"its clicks bro. there might be a political agenda, but the money agenda is much more straightforward. remember that TWC is ultimately owned by NBC Universal."
weather,3de4gs,waltc97,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:51:52 2015 UTC,"If you are just talking about numbers, 11 Tropical Cyclones in Nine Weeks is a record. I agree that they get a little click-baity and I don't like the format of the website, but they actually don't broadcast all of the extreme weather events happening now. If they did it would look like the Apocalypse Channel."
weather,3de4gs,TheKolbrin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"National sites cover an entire nation, so yes, extreme weather coverage is generally going to be a lot of bad news. TWC's competition can also be included in this discussion."

weather,3dcwmi,Faraday_Rage,2,Wed Jul 15 07:47:39 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt any models have a Dolores as a Hurricane 200 mi off the coast of California.  Even with above average water temps, the water will not support a hurricane north of about 23-24 deg N.  Once it gets 200 mi SW of San Diego, the water is around 70 deg F so it wouldn't even be a tropical anything really.  Check out the latest NWS San Diego discussion for details on the potential moisture.  It looks like there is the potential for isolated showers and t-storms this weekend from the remnants of Dolores."
weather,3dcwmi,rex_llama,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:24:33 2015 UTC,ERGI is the model that has it there
weather,3dcwmi,lightning10000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:34:54 2015 UTC,Well it is complex. Todays models do show it combining with a monsoonal wave. That would help to bring rain and thunderstorms to the coastal and valley locations if it pans out.   One thing I would keep an eye on is even if water vales hit 2+ inches in the air if their is no trigger or lack of sunlight it might just be a very light rain event at best.
weather,3d9epg,Mindspiked,9,Tue Jul 14 15:09:28 2015 UTC,When flooding like this starts I think people don't realize they're in trouble until it's too late to leave.
weather,3d9epg,Vehudur,2,Tue Jul 14 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"That's the problem when people don't respect watches, warnings, forecasts, or what it's doing outside.  Too many people have a ""oh, it will stop raining/go down any minute now"" attitude. People look at me weird when I look outside and if the street is getting saturated and radar shows it's not going away in the next few minutes we're getting in the car and heading for the nearest hilltop with what we have on ourselves. Because I'd rather be on a hill top with my wallet, keys, and family than in my house recording this kind of shit going ""we're next!"""
weather,3d9epg,GringodelRio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:27:23 2015 UTC,If your house is in an area where flooding like this is likely I think that's a good idea.
weather,3d9epg,Vehudur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:40:19 2015 UTC,"Even if it's not an area where it's likely or has happened, if the streets start looking more like creeks, it's time to move. Best case scenario, you take a road trip and sit in your car eating Cheetos for a while."
weather,3d9epg,GringodelRio,2,Fri Jul 17 01:07:48 2015 UTC,"I would've gotten TF out of there long before the waters got that high. Jeez, people."
weather,3d9epg,iTim314,13,Tue Jul 14 16:07:02 2015 UTC,"If you've never been in a flash flood, you just can't imagine how fast the water rises.  Your brain literally can't comprehend the danger."
weather,3d9epg,the_eluder,3,Tue Jul 14 16:38:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. About 4 years ago there was a devastating flood in my hometown. I was just driving along, minding my business when water came from all sides moving crazy fast. There was no warning,  and no one expected it to flood as bad as it did."
weather,3d9epg,booofedoof,2,Tue Jul 14 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"I was camping with my family as a teenager near Jack's Fork River, and we were roughly 400 yards from the bank of the river in a campground.  I had noticed some high water marks in the campground on trees and a restroom building, but I hadn't really thought about it as being a threat (again, I was a teenager).  We went to bed around 9 PM, and sometime in the night, a light rain passed through, which didn't bother my brother and I in our tent...but what woke us up was that we realized we must have pitched our tent in a spot where water collects...which of course we knew enough about camping (we went literally hundreds of times as kids) that we always put our tent on a raised area.  I crawled out of the tent first and realized the river was flowing through the campground.   The water was only about ankle deep at that point, and we got my parents (asleep in the camper van) to pull up camp and move back about a half mile, after waking several other nearby campers as well.  Turns out the water only got about a foot deep in camp, but looking at the old high water marks in the camp, you could see that in past floods it had been 6 feet deep through where we were.    Flash floods kill more people in the US than tornadoes, lightning, and hurricanes combined.  Every one of those people, like us, either were oblivious to the danger or failed to take note of obvious danger signs."
weather,3d9epg,rabidsnowman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:23:53 2015 UTC,"I really have to ask how people miss that shit. It's one thing if there aren't obvious signs, but...in my town, I live far enough away from the river that even if it flooded it wouldn't make it to us. We'd get some minor flooding on the roads, but nothing bad. I wouldn't move closer to the river if you paid me."
weather,3d9epg,ghostfox1_gfaqs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:07:03 2015 UTC,"That's what everyone in Eastern NC thought after Hurricane Floyd.  Water levels rose so fast, and to heights that haven't been seen in decades, if not more.  When I left for work, water was in a stream near my house.  When I returned 4 hours later water was lapping at the front door of my house.  The streams that were normally a few feet wide and a couple of inches deep were not 20 and 30 feet deep and 1/4 of a mile wide."
weather,3d9epg,the_eluder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:10:33 2015 UTC,"There's a difference when it's been decades, and there aren't any signs of massive flooding. I'll say this, my town hasn't flooded badly for 100 years, because they built flood gates. But it's gotten close a few times. And we've gotten more rain in the first week of this month than we usually see the whole month."
weather,3d9epg,ghostfox1_gfaqs,4,Tue Jul 14 22:14:45 2015 UTC,It's called a flash flood for a reason man.
weather,3d9epg,twattymcgee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:51:35 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how the residents are? Did they make it?
weather,3d9epg,QuacksMeUp,6,Wed Jul 15 01:07:26 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of debris in the fast-moving water, and unknown submerged hazards.  I'd be ready to abandon, but probably sit it out until it's the last option."
weather,3d9epg,irishjihad,3,Tue Jul 14 16:13:41 2015 UTC,Literally the opposite of what you should do.
weather,3d9epg,tcpip4lyfe,3,Tue Jul 14 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"Your chances are better in your house until it is being carried away.    That said, not everyone in this world is fit enough to fight a strong current, walking or swimming.  If you're infirm or elderly, you stand virtually no chance of walking out of even knee deep fast moving water."
