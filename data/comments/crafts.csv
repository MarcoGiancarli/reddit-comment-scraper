crafts,3e35sf,DianeBcurious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:35 2015 UTC,Really good miniature and detail skills with the polymer clay.  Did you add the onlays before or after the background was hardened?  You should post this to /r/polymerclay too.
crafts,3e35sf,DianeBcurious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much! All the detail work was made on top  of the raw clay :) I once tried to add them to the hardened base, but they didn't stick."
crafts,3e35sf,DianeBcurious,2,Tue Jul 21 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"They'll stick better to hardened clay if you apply some liquid polymer clay to the surface first, then let it have a chance to be absorbed a bit.  Will create an excellent bond too. (If you want a tackier surface, try some PVA glue thinned down a bit with water then allowed to dry at least a bit, or often even a coat of clear polyurethane.) It's great to do on top of raw polymer clay though of course! when possible.  (Did you see where I added that you should post this to /r/polymerclay too?)"
crafts,3e35sf,needathneed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"It's a nice idea as well! But now I'm used to just bake it all together :) I applied a thin coat of Fimo varnish, but I'll try the polyurethane one for a glossier look.  (Yes I did, I'll do a cross-post soon. Thank you for your suggestion!)"
crafts,3e35sf,BlueSprite714,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"Btw, I didn't mean using the polyurethane as a clear finish, but as a somewhat-stickable base for adding raw clay on hardened clay.   Most clear polyurethanes look and behave better than the only clear finish that the Fimo manufacturers currently make.  However, Fimo's (manufactured by Eberhard Faber back then) old ""spirit-based"" or alcohol-based clear finish was the best one ever (though really expensive compared to polyurethane).       Polyurethane comes in gloss, satin or matte here.  Not sure what you have there.  The favorite here is the brand called Varathane (now manufactured by Rustoleum) because of it's added ""interpenetrating factor. It's matte is really-really matte though.  For the caned tile, you could always sand-and-buff though to get as high a gloss as you wanted.  Do you ever do that technique?"

Those tiles you mentioned were achieved by transfering ink from matte photography paper to the polymer clay. I did that because Portuguese Tile (Azulejo) is a bit blurry around the edges and along with a glossy finish it made for a nice replica."

crafts,3e1hzt,jaimekj,3,Tue Jul 21 15:31:25 2015 UTC,Sure! It really easy. The sand is basically made from equal parts sand and dry milk. You just mix it together and you get sand that dissolves.
crafts,3e1hzt,LemonBomb,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:25 2015 UTC,That's awesome.  I'm going to give it a try!
crafts,3e1hzt,bigbootywoes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:05 2015 UTC,"Cool! Just another tip: if you find that the consistency seems to thin or un-sand like, just add more salt. Salt with large chunks is good to use as well (like sea salt) because it simulates the rocks found in real sand. You could do a combination of sea salt and table salt for a good effect. But remember to add the dry milk too because that is what helps it dissolve."

crafts,3e0l43,DianeBcurious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:19 2015 UTC,"Beautiful map and nice wood underneath. Should look great.   If you do use Mod Podge, particularly since this would be used for a tabletop you might want to add at least one coat of polyurethane on top (probably the gloss version, but satin if you want). Polyurethane is much tougher and harder than Mod Podge (or any PVA glue diluted with water--same thing), so it would be less prone to later scratching or cloudiness from moisture absorption.  It's used that way all the time too.    Since this is an ""aged"" map already, you may not care about further yellowing from exposure to too much UV light.  But if you do, be sure and get a polyurethane with ""UV protection."""

Also, kits are fairly cheap on eBay if you want to try building your own. I have zero construction experience, but built a kit off of eBay with just wood glue and it was fairly easy.

You can also just paint the walls if you want something easier than wallpaper, and they even sell battery operated lighting if you don't want to install wires.

Also, I don't think i'll necessarily need to get it onto paper, I just need the effect to take a picture of so it would work better if the whole effect was in the water and I could capture it like that.

Oil paint is what you want since it will ""resist"" the water and make the swirly patterns. But if you want bubbly, i'd suggest soap and water color paints. like a thin film of soap and add/swirl the blue color in to make it all bubbly but add the swirls. More research comes up with this seems pretty cool too. Edit: it's probably only oil, water color paint, and glitter with water."

So you may want to look at different leathers and decide what you like and then color match to that. I made an all leather plague doctor mask last year and used a reddish brown color with hints of black to make it look aged.  If you're considering covering it with leather but are concerned about cost, check out thrift stores for leather skirts, jackets, and large purses. They are usually pretty cheap and thin leather."

I would say RIT did work really well but I came out with a light tan color, so I tried bleach and that really damaged the fabric. So your best bet would be RIT and you might have better luck if you are stripping it to dye it a different color. Unfortunately in my case there is no white dye."

There are lots of YouTube videos about it so I'm sure you could find one where someone color-removes.  But, when you get to the coloring part, may I suggest: Don't forget to wet the fabric first before dyeing, and make sure the fabric isn't folded up on itself and is totally submerged. I forgot to wet mine and dipped while the fabric was accordion-folded (I thought it'd make straighter lines), and it came out kind of marble-y, almost tie-dye. Just thought I'd mention that so you can get the most even, rich color.  Good luck!"

crafts,3d4wfi,AnimeF,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:30:09 2015 UTC,I'd guess it is flammable only when curing.
crafts,3d4wfi,netl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"I believe it is not.    The MSDS for Goop (and E6000--same thing basically) says that the vapors are flammable before curing/drying, but says nothing about after drying except that it's best temp range would be up to 150 F (that may be only the temperature before it begins to soften though, not burn).  I also found the following answer on amazon.com for one Goop product after someone there had asked your same question:   ""I just went and tested on a dried piece (of glue). Where there was a little tiny string of glue (you know how you get those little hair-like stringers) it burned off, but it didn't flame out. The bigger places that were glued did not react.""  I've never had a problem with it myself after drying (nor ever heard of a problem) though I haven't intentionally put it right in a flame."
crafts,3d4wfi,DianeBcurious,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the suprising thing is that was my question on Amazon.  Also I called the manufacturer and the confirmed that after it cures its no longer flammable."

crafts,3d24i2,Khallthas,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:24:18 2015 UTC,Do you know what kind of paint she prefers working with? Oil? Acrylic? Watercolor?
crafts,3d24i2,writerlib,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I think.. acrylic?  She wants to paint on some small canvases and paper."
crafts,3d24i2,peptidemel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:39:20 2015 UTC,Walmart has a nice selection of small kits.  Apple Barrel is good. Also sold there.
crafts,3d24i2,iovita2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"Apple Barrel is a pretty novice friendly paint brand in my opinion, it should work pretty well if your girlfriend is just looking to paint in her spare time as a hobby or something.   I have 2 oz bottles and they last at least a couple of weeks (though it depends on how much she paints). For sets, unfortunately it seems that the amount of paint goes down significantly, but the student grade ones I know of are the Reeves and the Liquitex Basics. I believe that as you get higher in quality the brands tend to sell individually rather than in sets, so the cost adds up.  Depending on how dedicated she is into painting, if I was buying these I'd splurge on a good artist/student grade set with ROYGBV + White + Black, and then get Apple Barrel/cheaper brands for the special colors in between that are harder to mix."
crafts,3d24i2,iovita2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:23:21 2015 UTC,"I was at Wal-Mart today actually looking at the Apple Barrel paint they had, but I don't know what type to buy.  They had Matte, Gloss and Multi-Surface Satin. The Matte is only 50 cents per 2oz bottle, but are the others necessarily 'better?'  She would mainly be doing simple sketches on paper.  What is the difference between the 3?"
crafts,3d24i2,inventorjoe,3,Mon Jul 13 03:33:51 2015 UTC,"I believe the paints are essentially the same, it's just how the paint looks when it's dry. Basically, matte paints reflect no light and have a smoother (almost dull) look, satin is the middle ground in which it keeps the same look as it does when it's wet, and gloss reflects the most light, giving a shiny finish.   If it's just paper I'd recommend getting the matte paints, just because it's what acrylics are typically, and I personally tend to only use the glossy paints for special things, plus it's hard to know beforehand what she'll be doing that'll require it."
crafts,3d24i2,multiverse4,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:27:02 2015 UTC,"Amazon has lots of paint sets at varying prices. I'd recommend checking them out and they'll have reviews for everything to help you out.   That said, my favorite place is dickblick for paints. I did a ton of research back when I started painting and found them to be highly recommended by artists. Not sure how much you want to pay, you could do something like: http://www.dickblick.com/items/00711-1049/ where it has all the primary colors so she could mix whatever color she wants. It's a lot of paint so it would last a while. If you do the math it ends up being about 33 cents an oz + whatever shipping ends up (sometimes they have coupon codes for extra % off though).  Now I've gone and made myself want to buy some paint (most of my tubes are either empty or pretty old and dried), I might take my own advice on that set, lol.  *bonus advice, ice trays are great for mixing colors and holding it while you paint, and once it dries, you can peel them off as opposed to disposable items or more expensive palettes :)"

crafts,3d366e,SolipsistMisanthrope,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:50:50 2015 UTC,When I make collages I use a glue stick to stick everything onto a poster board and then I put clear contact paper over it to make it stay. I make sure to use a little extra contact paper over each side and also cut the corners all the way to the board so the contact paper can make smooth sides on the back of the poster too. I've been making collages for quite a while and I found this to be the best way to keep them together! Good luck!

crafts,3cucqx,thechuu,3,Sat Jul 11 03:46:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I am totally in love with art nouveau, and it is the major source of inspiration for my jewelry pieces. Shrink plastic is a flat material that you can sand and color using inks or, in my case, colored pencils; you can then cut out your design and all you have to do is stick it in the oven at 330F for somewhere between 1 and 2 minutes, and the polymer will shrink 2-fold but by doing so will also thicken and harden. Afterwards you can use jump rings, wire, glue, chain, what have you to assemble the pieces into interesting designs, or you can reproduce already existing pieces.   Let me know if you would like more details on the makings of a particular piece :)"

Also do you have issues with the shrinky dinks not shrinking proportionally? I had 2 pieces I wanted to layer over one another, but after putting it through the oven, the pieces didn't match up anymore :/"
crafts,3cucqx,blackjadex,6,Fri Jul 10 22:22:41 2015 UTC,"Hello!  I do use an Xacto knife, but it does take a while and my fingers hurt a bit afterwards. It's not necessarily difficult to control but you have to push through the plastic, so it takes more force than if cutting paper. I also use regular scissors for non-complicated shapes, usually the outside of the pieces. The shrink plastic definitely does not shrink isotropically sometimes (or maybe it was that one sheet), I have a couple of ""lopsided"" things... but I usually leave them the oven for a while so they reach equillibrium and poke them with pliers while they're still soft if I see some irregularities.  Hope that helps!"
crafts,3cucqx,_feathers,5,Fri Jul 10 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in saving your hands and have it in your budget, I used a hobby plotter to cut Shrinky Dinks. It was several years ago - the Silhouette SD -  and I annihilated the blade and the monograms were too thin to hold up but it was a lot of fun. The new Silhouette Cameo says that it can cut chipboard so I'm thinking of trying it again. I've also gotten an aftermarket blade holder and just replace the blades which I get on eBay so it's much cheaper if I ruin another blade."

crafts,3cucqx,elizafallingup,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"Another thing about shrinking - if you are using cardboard or some rough surface the plastic may be ""catching"" onto it and this may cause non-symmetric shrinking as it tries to drag the surface with it. I pre-heat the cardboard with the oven and once they have shrunk I poke the pieces a bit to unstick them from the surface, and then I put them into the oven again to equillibrate."

It's another to show your interest by getting a little creative yourself.  A few ideas are you could create the craft box yourself. Even if you aren't good with building things, you could buy one and design it, paint it in her favorite color, do something to show you spent time and not just money.  If you have no creative bone in your body (which I highly doubt based on this request) a crafting class would be a great idea. Research online and see if you can find a studio that gives classes (For both of you to attend). I know of a few in my area that do pottery (which is tons of fun). If you think she'd be more into painting, check groupon or local studies for wine and painting events, which have become quite popular. Good Luck, I'm sure she will love whatever you do!"

I took pictures of the process, because it did work well and fusible vinyl is $6/yard (at walmart) while I paid $2 for a giant clear vinyl table cloth and $1 for the fusible hemming web. The advice I would give if someone wanted to do the same is to make sure there are not any bubbles in the cotton since you're only sealing the edges if you choose to use the narrow webbing."

And no matter what happens, she should try to find a way of continuing to make quilts, etc!  It might be good to specify though that she's wanting a long arm quilting machine and not a regular sewing machine, and that she'd like to create a full-time job from doing long-arm quilting for others and teaching others how to use long-arm machines. (Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to actually make a living by creating quilts, even for those who do high-quality artistic quilts that sell for lots-of-money, although making smaller pieced and quilted items could perhaps get her a modest living as long as she's willing to do the same thing over and over, all day every day, and then be a good business person, marketing her stuff well, etc...and especially if she lives in an area or situation where her bills aren't too high.  Teaching, and even publishing her own quilting patterns, etc, would give much more bang for the buck, and also not be as soul-crushing.  Although she could do all of the above, or she could supplement another income or part-time job with those things and make it work.)"

On my ""test mug"", I painted, baked, hand washed, ran through dishwasher, re-painted, re-baked, washed and washed and washed again, etc... several times. Basically, I painted and baked on it about 3 or 4 separate times while using it frequently as my coffee mug (and appropriately washing it) for about the last three months. It has held up like nobody's business. Zero flaking or fading.   Again, though, these were Sharpie oil paint makers. Not regular Sharpies.

That means, put the mug on the cookie sheet into the cold oven, turn the oven to 350°, after it comes fully up to temp set the timer for 30 minutes, after 30 minutes turn the oven off and let the oven, mug, & cookie sheet all cool down together.   Here's one of my finished mugs where I used a lot of blue. I also baked this one, washed it, and then went back later and added the red, gold, & silver accents and re-baked it: http://imgur.com/mNdwYww  There was another mug I did with a big red heart on it. My bf tried it first and messed something up, so I had to do it again with a fresh mug, and we noticed the red on his mug had turned a really weird dark, purpley magenta. On my mug the red stayed a nice bright red. We suspect that he didn't let the paint pen fully dry before he baked it, so maybe make sure to do that.

crafts,3c83oh,fancysidewalk,2,Mon Jul 6 01:46:17 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a clear water-based polyurethane (hardware store, bare wood sealing aisle) since it's the toughest clear sealer. A favorite brand of polymer clayers is ""Varathane"" (water-based, gloss), now manufactured by Rustoleum, since it's even better.  (Note that some polyurethanes will also have UV protection like the one above, which will prevent yellowing from too much sunlight, etc.)   To keep any sealer on a slick surface like glass where it has nothing much to adhere to, it's best to apply it ""around corners"" or even all the way around a dimensional item, and in that case it will grip better or even form a complete shell.  As for your resin problem, the easiest solution would be if you're just using the wrong kind of resin--a common problem. So the two main types of resin used for art/craft are epoxy resin and polyester resin. The polyester type will often stay sticky on the surface because it's intended to do that, and it's either used in between layers of fiberglass cloth where it helps the next layer stick, or it's used for casts (made in deeper molds) where the back/under side of the cast won't matter much. Polyester resins won't cure thoroughly in the presence of air, so various materials or techniques have to be used to prevent that tackiness when desired. The epoxy type of resin will cure thoroughly in the presence of air or without air.  It's most often used as a coating, or for relatively shallow casts in molds or as shallow toppings in permanent cells.  (There is one tweaked epoxy that will do deep molds but it has a few problems in warmer weather.  And epoxy glues are basically epoxy resin, just thicker, tho some cure clearer than others.)  The most common brand of polyester resin is Castin' Craft Polyester Casting Resin, and common brands of epoxy resin are Envirotex Lite, Ultra-Glo, and various others. There's much more info on the various types and brands of ""resin"" in some of my previous answers over at YahooAnswers, etc, and those will be listed in the links to my previous answer here at Reddit too if you want to check them out: https://www.reddit.com/r/crafts/comments/3ab6qa/what_clear_filler_can_i_use_to_level_off_salt/ (ignore the first paragraph)"

crafts,3c61tp,termeric0,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:57:39 2015 UTC,"What I did was take a 3 gallon bucket of warm water and floated some enamel paint on top of the water. I used those model paints Testers.  layed down the red and let it sit for a minute or two, this allows the paint to spread. Then I used a eye dropper and dropped the other colors ontop of the red. You can do allkinds of random patters.  Once you have done that you take a toothpick or something pointy and just slowly swirl it around till you are happy with the way it looks.   Then slowly dip the gun into the water, the paint will slowly stick tho the gun. If you check YouTube there are tons of videos on how to do this. I actually thought it might be hard, but its pretty easy once you see it done.  Plus make sure you lightly sand the whole gun, it helps the paint stick. I used 220 grit snad paper and sanded every surface."

That sounds like more work to me though."
crafts,3c4auk,DianeBcurious,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:10:16 2015 UTC,"Still not understanding exactly what you're wanting to do.  Would it be something like one of these? https://www.google.com/search?q=fishing+swivel+bead+bracelet http://www.bjcraftsupplies.com/pattern/jewelry-swivel-bracelet-blue.asp  Most of those just use beads that are small enough and have holes wide enough to go onto the wires of the fishing swivels and negotiate any curves or bends.  Sometimes those parts of the wires can be unbent temporarily too.  I don't think any of the beads actually come in two parts though. (And btw, those are mostly small to medium-sized beads, not the larger ""pony"" beads.)  Not sure what you meant by this too, if it's still important: but the hook won't come ""off""  As for making (larger) beads ""in place"" from polymer clay, you could do that since metal and wire is totally fine being baked with the clay.  But it would be hard to get those beads really round while actually on the wire, although you could cool the clay or even partly bake it (or rewarm it after baking) to firm it up or make it a bit softer to thread onto the wire."

Then take more card stock and cut it into 1 in by 1 in squares, make 4-6 stacks of 5 squares or however tall you want them to be and glue them behind the logo on the canvas making the logo float above the crayon art. That way the crayon can melt naturally behind the logo. This will make the front of the canvas more fragile though so you'd have to store carefully."

crafts,3bvinv,CoolDryPlace,4,Thu Jul 2 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"I did some cow skull carving in high school. That has been quite some time ago now, but I remember a few things:  One, the process smells.  Start with a dry, anthill-cleaned, sun bleached skull or you're in for a horror show. With a fully prepped skull, the carving will smell like burning bone, which is kind of like burning hair, but makes us recoil from an even deeper, more primitive part of our mind (so, worse. It smells worse). Eye protection for flying bits and a face mask with a drop or two of peppermint oil should get you through it. I actually like cinnamon, but you have to be careful with that stuff. Go easy on the peppermint oil for that matter. But use something, and do this in a well ventilated area.   When it's being carved, bone shares (good and bad) qualities of wood, plastic, and tile. So it cuts fairly uniformly except when it cracks, flakes, splits, and burns. Diamond bits work the best, but with their fine grit they can get gummed up, so use a belt sander dressing tool (like a giant eraser) to keep refreshing the cutting head."
crafts,3bvinv,PtolemyShadow,2,Thu Jul 2 19:35:01 2015 UTC,"/u/cooldryplace is right, it does smell, but after doing it for an hour or so, it didn't really bother me.

I have not worked with polymer clay before, but I've been wanting to try it.  I'm not real talented when it comes to making anything from scratch (drawing, sculpting, painting…) so I kind of figured the clay might not be my wheelhouse."

I find it to be one of the easiest artistic mediums to work with because it's so versatile and pliable! You just need to have an understanding of shapes and then the sculpting skill just comes with practice and time. :)"

There are also jewelry conventions/showcase (not really sure what it's called) where you can rent a space and sell there. I helped a friend's mother sell jewelry at a jewelry showcase. It was lots of fun! Or you can just see if a local place will allow you to put up a few pieces with your contact info. You can sell. And it will be successful!! :)

I've asked my therapist what she though was up with this, and she thinks there may be some correlation to a traumatic brain injury I had several years ago.  She says creative phenomenon and new-found ""abilities"" have been well documented in other patient cases.  I don't know if this is what happened to me, and really, I don't care.  What I do know is this started out of nowhere, the ideas just keep coming, and I seem to be able to put them together.   No matter how, I really dig it. :)"

crafts,3bmecc,bitch_is_cray_cray,2,Tue Jun 30 11:47:03 2015 UTC,I would try to find a fake peice of chicken. Check toy stores for kitchen sets or play food. You could try taking it to a florist and have them make you a corsage with it. The one in the picture looks like just baby's breath which shouldn't be too expensive. For DIY stores such as michaels or AC more sell braclet type things that you can add flowers too and build corsages around.
crafts,3bmecc,yesimlegit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:03:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'll see if I can get a fake piece of chicken (hopefully one that's not too small!). I was hoping I wouldn't have to spend too much (being that it's all a joke and all that), but the florist will be my emergency option! I think the nearest thing we have to a Michael's Craft store (not too sure what AC is) is Spotlight, so I'll have to either go in or give 'em a call. Fingers crossed the DIY bit will be easy if I get my hand on the bracelet type things you're talking about! Thanks for the advice!"

I would definitely suggest the fusible vinyl as well as an option if you just want them to wipe clean; I used it on another project and it's really simple and works really well!"
crafts,3blvwf,randomstonerfromaus,2,Tue Jun 30 07:28:20 2015 UTC,"There could be various ways to do this and various mediums you could use, but some of the choices would be restricted by the level of detail you want to create (as well as the various sizes you've mentioned).    You might consider polymer clay though (be careful of brand/line for some uses though), or even perhaps some of the higher-quality air-dry clays, and you could use those materials for both the terrain/landscape and the bridge. Air-dry clays won't take quite as much detail and will also need to be sealed, and are generally painted to create color. Polymer clays will take a lot of detail, and are capable of creating ""faux"" materials on their own sometimes with special techniques (or they can also be painted, or just highlighted and/or antiqued with paint, etc).  Some of the materials that polymer clay can be made to look like are concrete, rock, metal, wood, and many more.  This page at my site has info on using polymer clay and/or other materials to create diorama objects and materials like stone, terrain, etc: http://glassattic.com/polymer/houses_structures_gingerbread.htm (scroll or jump down to the subcategory called  Scenery, Landscaping, etc or on Rock/Stone) And this page will have more on making faux rock: http://glassattic.com/polymer/Faux--many.htm (click on Rock and on Sand) Or check out the ""texturing"" technique often used for polymer clay.  In your case, you could create your bridge or landscape, etc, then texture it with fine or rough things (from sandpaper to rocks, toughie pads, toothbrushes, etc, etc) to give it a more textured surface.  After baking the clay, you can than ""antique"" the textured areas (often with acrylic paint) to give them more visual depth, dimensionality and realism, and/or you can ""highlight"" them to add different colors to just the upper areas of the texture: http://glassattic.com/polymer/texturing.htm  If you used only polymer clay for the bridge, you might need permanent armatures inside the clay at various points, or you might not since this would be pretty small.  Or you could use another material, etc, with the clay even as an armature, for example putting a stiff ""road"" on top of the bridge.  https://www.google.com/images?q=polymer+clay+diorama https://www.google.com/search?q=polymer+clay+diorama  You could also make the ground from other materials, as in lots of military and game themed dioramas: https://www.google.com/images?q=terrain+diorama https://www.google.com/images?q=diorama+terrarium https://www.google.com/images?q=war+diorama https://www.google.com/images?q=diorama+game+of+thrones+games   And this site has lots of good stuff about using polystyrene foams (both kinds) for making terrain, gaming, and other categories: http://gallery.hotwirefoamfactory.com/modeling/miniature-gaming-terrain http://gallery.hotwirefoamfactory.com/modeling/model-railroads  If you want to use ps foam, you don't need to use hot tools though.  You can just use serrated knives, and other tools.  You can read more about using ps foams here : http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100325153349AA9Aq4W (look for my user name, Diane B., in any YahooAnswers questions) http://mgilbert.net/Foam.html http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100528155312AA493kG"
crafts,3blvwf,DianeBcurious,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:24:39 2015 UTC,"Thankyou so much for all the tips and further reading.    One thought I had after reading all of that was making a foam model, covering it in a thin layer of clay so that I can texture it, then removing the foam and filling the hole left with something a lot stronger, maybe plaster or a lightweight cement. Im thinking this because I dont have much experience with craft but the experience I do have ive found it easier to work in a subtractive fashion rather than starting with nothing and building up. Do you think something like that could work? Thanks again :)    Edit: After a little more reading, Another option I found is making the model in foam, Then creating a plaster mould, I can then use the mould to make the model in whatever material I want. I think I may go down this road as it is essentially an easier version of what I just said."

crafts,3bix8z,kystar,2,Mon Jun 29 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"Visit /r/CrossStitch and have a look at the FAQs to begin with.  I always recommend that people buy a small kit from a craft store or online for their first cross stitch - it means you get all your supplies in one bundle and can focus on the technique first. Once you've got the basics down, the world is your oyster! Etsy is awesome for buying patterns and kits with more modern designs. Or you could even start designing your own!  Good luck and don't be shy to ask questions at /r/CrossStitch."

crafts,3bix8z,Emlily91,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, didn't notice this before I posted my comment about cross stitching. I'm sure you got it in your inbox.  If you have no idea about cross stitching you should buy a kit. Like I said some can be expensive but you can sometimes find them on clearance. They usually have a decent variety at craft stores like Michael's.   Cross stitching kits have a pattern, material, a needle, and all the floss you'll need. If you buy a kit you'll need to buy a hoop. Make sure it's small enough for the material in the kit.  A couple of things of note that I didn't know when I first started cross stitching:  When they give you the floss, which is a bunch of the threads twirled together to make a thicker thread, they intend you to only take one or two of the threads to stitch with. Not all 6.  Another thing, most people thread their needle differently than I do. Most put their needle only about 3 inches down the thread and keep their thumb holding the thread in place. I find that hard so I put the needle in the middle of the thread and secure both ends in place. When I do that though I have to use half the recommended amount of thread. If it calls for two threads and I want to secure both ends I just put one thread on the needle.  That probably sounds confusing but if you buy one of the kits and try it out then it will make more sense.  OH! one last thing. In addition to the kit and hoop you will also need a small pair of scissors for cutting thread and a pen or highlighter to mark off on the patter where you've already stitched. I like using a high lighter better, personally."

crafts,3bfmww,the_itsb,22,Mon Jun 29 04:34:45 2015 UTC,This was in Northern Arizona in January of this year. Temperatures in the teens. One mistake I initially made was tossing the balloons outside in the snow to freeze; the snow insulated the balloons and they didn't freeze solid. They need to be isolated and preferably off the ground (I ended up clearing the snow off a couple of chaise lounge chairs and setting them up there).

crafts,3bef69,flopenden,8,Sun Jun 28 13:29:17 2015 UTC,"I agree.  If you want fine detail and real smoothness in a clay, you'd probably want ""polymer clay.""  It comes in many colors, including a number of flesh tones (by different brands), some with a lot of translucence in them for realism. (And you won't need a kiln, just a home oven.)  (If you want to stay with an air-dry clay, check out the high-quality ""LaDoll"" clay that's also used for sculpting.  It comes in 3 versions, described in this review: http://newclaynews.blogspot.com/2012/06/meet-new-clay-ladoll.html )  Polymer clay is different than most other ""clays"" in several ways, but for sculpting in particular (it can do many other things as well), it can be shaped using a single color like most other kinds of clay then just be painted over when hardened, but more often colored clays are used for most parts of the sculpts (flesh colors for skin, other colors for clothing, etc) though sometimes paints or washes are used for lips and cheeks, sometimes eyes as well.    Here are pics of some of anime figures that polymer clayers have created, though these aren't as complex or realistic as many other polymer clay figures: https://www.google.com/images?q=polymer+clay+anime And here are pics of more complex/realistic polymer clay sculpts:  https://www.google.com/images?q=polymer+clay+sculpting  Polymer clay is a different medium though than air-dry clays including pottery/ceramic clays which are fired in a kiln, and than epoxy clays and plasticine-type clays (those are the major types of ""clay""). And since it's a different medium, it has some ""rules"" that will be different from the other types of clays so you would have to learn about those to use polymer clay well.  There are loads of sculptors who have though, from those who make simple and/or cartoon figures to those to make highly realistic figures. You might also be interested in my answer to this question over at Yahooanswers about the various kinds of ""clay"" for sculpting purposes: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20121017130942AA3HGxt (I'm Diane B. there)  Since many of those who sculpt with their polymer clay have come from sculpting with other clays/mediums, they often have their own groups and use their polymer clay only in that way, so it can be good to hook up with some of those groups too. You could google things like polymer clay groups forums sculpting ...or polymer clay groups forums dolls ...or polymer clay groups forums anime, etc, to find them.      You can also find lots of info about sculpting with polymer clay on the sculpting-related pages of my polymer clay encyclopedia website, and also on some of the other pages that often have figures and other sculpted items (e.g., Christmas, Halloween/Etc, Kids-Beginners, etc). http://glassattic.com/polymer/sculpture.htm http://glassattic.com/polymer/sculpting_body_and_tools.htm http://glassattic.com/polymer/heads_masks.htm http://glassattic.com/polymer/miniatures.htm and perhaps: http://glassattic.com/polymer/houses_structures_gingerbread.htm  Depending on the size and shape of the polymer clay figures you'd be making, you might also need permanent armatures inside the clay (generally inside any parts that are thicker than 1 1/4"" to prevent possible cracking during baking, and also inside any thin or projecting parts for rigidity and strength).  The Armatures-Permanent page at my site will have info about that: http://glassattic.com/polymer/armatures-perm.htm And there will be more relating to armatures and figures on the Sculpting page linked to above, down under the Websites category for the particular type of sculpt you want.     There's also the issue of joining and/or bonding pieces of clay, and that will sometimes be different for polymer clay than the clay you were using.  You can read about that on the Glues-Diluent page of my site (category ""Some Bonding Techniques"") or most are listed in my previous YA answer here too: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20150204075208AAnrB2Q   Polymer clay also comes in various brands and sometimes lines under those brands which all have their own characteristics.  You'd have to choose the characteristics you wanted for each sculpt or part, although most clayers will avoid the weaker ones when possible.  One of those weaker ones when thin after baking would be SuperSculpey which is the translucent-flesh color clay under the Sculpey/Polyform brand (often used because it comes in bulk and is easily available at local stores), but in order to get the most strength from it they'll bake it a long time till it browns (then use a white primer over it, and finally acrylic paint most often as the colored paint and generally in two coats--the better quality acrylic paints are preferred but any will do).   Polymer clay needs to be baked/heated long enough to polymerize it all the way to the center, but not be hot enough to darken or burn it in most situations.  The usual temperature for curing polymer clay is around 275 F for 10-45 minutes depending on thickness, and that can easily be done in a home oven or even a toaster oven.  There are definitely guidelines about baking polymer clay you should know though since you'd be working with a very different medium than air-dry clay. You can read lots of info about baking polymer clay in my answer to this previous question over at YahooAnswers, or you can just go to the Baking page at my site: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111224000037AAQSEfC http://glassattic.com/polymer/baking.htm (Btw, polymer clay ""cures rather than ""dries"" because it's oil-based rather than water-based like air-dry clays...that also means it won't start hardening while being worked with like air-dry clays, a great bonus)."

crafts,3bef69,lsp2005,3,Sun Jun 28 14:42:14 2015 UTC,No personal experience. My brother's gf uses Fimo. No need for a kiln. You can bake it in the over on low temp with the door ajar. And the details are up to you. You can find it at any craft store like Michael's (US) and they have a lot of colors.
crafts,3bef69,eldiab10,2,Sun Jun 28 14:36:46 2015 UTC,"I suggest polymer clay such as sculpey or fimo, it's very easy to use, vibrant, doesn't shatter easily (much more sturdy than clay, and easier to use in jewelry or key chains), is baked at a low temp, and can be combined with a myriad of special effect mixers, lacquers, etc. Very versatile and easy to use, also not that expensive either. And you can smooth/polish it easily since its basically almost plastic."

It will be used on stage for dancing, so it's important that I am able to see and breathe through it.  Unfortunately, I dance as if I'm alerting others to a fire and the horns dip down too low for that, so it's going to be interesting to see if it lasts the night.  Things I learned the hard way:  Don't put masking tape over paper mache, they absorb paint differently.  Use a mask when spray painting, I now have white nose hairs. Pipe cleaners don't absorb paint at all.  Inset sunglasses sounds like a great idea, but it's painful when you're trying to get your forehead past the nose holds.  I have removed the sunglasses now and will just put them on before putting on the mask.  The Dollar Tree is freaking amazing for craft supplies.

I used the ultrahold and hand-stitched the perimeter with regular thread for a finished look, mainly because it was wayyy too hard to machine stitch around an applique on a tiny baby onesie.

crafts,3b5izi,animuseternal,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"Of course it do! Lol Www.etsy.com/shop/shoesplatter  I just opened the shop so it's still got a few kinks to be worked out but the basics are simple. You purchase a shoe, then I get the shoes you want and I start painting them. Then you pay for the artwork and I ship them! So basically you pay for the shoes and the art seperately.   All I have is vans listings up at the moment but if you have another show in mind, I would of course be willing to look into that as well. It just needs to be leather or suede for me to paint it.   And, if you already have your own shoes or would rather buy the shoes yourself and ship them to me, we can also do that. I haven't set up a po box just yet but I will very soon."

crafts,3b5izi,animuseternal,16,Fri Jun 26 18:01:41 2015 UTC,"Budai is not the Buddha; he is Maitreya Bodhisattva. And we (Buddhists) put reminders of practice up everywhere, whether it's Budai or the Buddha or another bodhisattva or symbols.  I do find it peculiar that a Buddhist figure is being presented with a Hindu word (the Tibetan version would've been better... but even then, Budai is specifically a Chinese embodiment of Maitreya, so the Tibetan version would look dramatically different and closer to your stereotypical depiction of a bodhisattva).  The feet are considered dirty and we're not allowed to point our feet in the direction of a Buddha or bodhisattva, so I don't think Buddhists would ever wear this to begin with.  I'm not really offended or anything to that effect--I don't really care either way, and I think most Buddhists wouldn't care, but yes... it is disrespectful."
crafts,3b5izi,bleedscarlet,2,Fri Jun 26 15:07:20 2015 UTC,Thank you for a thoughtful and level-headed explanation. It makes a lot of sense.
crafts,3b5izi,better_with_butter,6,Fri Jun 26 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"""Not allowed,"" by whom?   Weird question. It's a cultural thing, like holding the door open for someone behind you. Less ""not allowed"" by a ""whom"" and more ""You're kind of a dick if you do this.""   How would you know a Buddha or bodhisattva (non-statue) if you saw one :)   Also a weird question, but I imagine this is just a non-sequitur and you're curious about... something...? I dunno, can you be more specific?  The next Buddha will be Maitreya Bodhisattva, but it won't happen for another few thousand years, long after Siddhartha Gautama's Buddhahood has been completely forgotten. So we're not gonna see a Buddha for a long long time.  As for bodhisattvas that are just regular people, you could argue that every sentient being you come across is a bodhisattva.  If you mean a bodhisattva like Maitreya, or like the Dalai Lama, who fall under a class of bodhisattvas called 'mahasattvas', I would ask you why you would need to know in the first place. It's a really peculiar distinction to make and bodhisattvas are essentially just people.  If you're just asking about how you know someone is enlightened ('arhants' are enlightened persons, and may or may not be bodhisattvas), I would again ask why it matters."
crafts,3b5izi,kgilr7,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:09:37 2015 UTC,I think they were wondering how you would know if you saw one so that you could avoiding pointing your feet towards them? That's my guess anyway.   we're not allowed to point our feet in the direction of a Buddha or bodhisattva
crafts,3b5izi,M3rlino,2,Fri Jun 26 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see that after the clarification. It doesn't apply to lay people.. it's about not pointing your feet at Buddha statues, bodhisattva statues, or monks/nuns.  It's also just about having the decency to not sit like a slob in public."
crafts,3b5izi,Hypocriticalvermin,2,Fri Jun 26 16:35:34 2015 UTC,"That particular rule has to do with temple conduct and is specifically about not having your feet directed at statues and at monastics; it shouldn't be a consideration with fellow members of the laity. Sorry if I was unclear on that.   why point your shoes at anyone?   I mean, this is just a cultural thing. Seriously. Don't be a dick about it. Even if you disregard the religious element, it's just considered sloppy/lazy to sit on the ground with your legs in front of you. Fold them underneath you or cross your legs. It's just like not having your elbows on the table when you eat or not putting your feet up on someone else's dashboard when you're riding shotgun.   Then again, why create rules that create opportunities for division and offense, which breed dukkha?   In every culture, there are things that are considered rude and things that are considered polite. It's about having some manners and I don't see why we're talking about this unless you're just purposefully trolling me."
crafts,3b5izi,emcorn,2,Fri Jun 26 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"Again, it has less to do with Buddhism and more to do with a country's cultural views on what is polite and what is rude.

However, it seems simply obvious to me to be merely a cultural artifact of what is considered 'good manners,' so the line of questioning seemed rather bizarre in light of that."

You can find all of these items at any craft store.  Spray a thin coat of adhesive roughly where you want the streaks, carefully sprinkle the flecks over, and spray clear coat over it.

If it were me, I would cut most of it, but skip a bit of the black lines so that it remains a solid, albeit floppy, piece.  Once you get it stuck down, you could lightly cut the rest of the lines out to make it a solid, etched line.

crafts,3av4cb,Mixels,2,Tue Jun 23 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"I have a KNK Maxx Air and have been very happy with it. It's common competition is the Silver Bullet cutter. Either will easily do vinyl and the other materials you mentioned... But they are expensive at around $1,000.   The KNK Zing should handle vinyl well too, but lacks the power to do things like leather.   http://knkusa.com/product/knk-zing-air-2/  KNK seems to have good customer service and edged out the Silver Bullet on that basis for me. KNK cutters also come with software called Make The Cut which is popular and has an active user base. (It will import SVG no problem.)  Once you get your cutter, the cheapest vinyl I have found is at craftvinyl.com.   If glass etching is your thing, look into an ""air eraser,"" which is like a tiny sandblaster. I have gotten great results from the chemical methods but the blaster is probably better for high volume work.   Good luck and have fun... I love my cutter. I'm a sticker making, t shirt designing, glass etching fool now.   Oh, budget for a t shirt heat press, too. ;)"
crafts,3av4cb,StargateCommand,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:43:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the KnK suggestion! I did some reading, and the KnK Zing Air looks like a great cutter. It can engrave too with the right bit, right?  So far in my research I'm at a bit of a toss-up between the eClips 2 and the KnK Zing Air (which is more versatile but almost twice the price of the eClips 2). Have you used the eClips before by chance? I've be interested to hear your thoughts on it as compared to the KnK Zing.  Air eraser engraving is something I'd like to eventually get into. For now, I'm sticking with the acid method because a cutter + compressor purchase is just too much right now. But eventually I'd love to get into it! Do you mind if I ask what compressor you use?  o.O at the t-shirt press. ;P One step at a time! :)"
crafts,3av4cb,StargateCommand,2,Wed Jun 24 02:41:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about the eClips 2, unfortunately. I can say that in the various forums I browse it just hasn't come up, whatever that means. I did a quick search and it seems pretty modest. It may be OK for vinyl but probably not engraving etc. Before you can make a decision you probably need to really figure out if you'll use features like engraving, because it makes a big price difference, as you saw.   One thing to keep in mind... ""engraving"" on these machines really means ""scratching."" Here is an example:  http://teamknk.com/engraving-a-dog-tag-on-a-knk/  (You can get anodized aluminum blank tags on Etsy, they look great when engraved this way.)  As you can see, you are just scoring a fine line. The engraving tip doesn't rotate and it won't mill out material. It's still quite useful, but you're not going to make something that looks like it came out of a CNC carving machine.   I don't have an air eraser myself, but I have read posts from many happy users. Seems like you can get one for about $100, but I don't etch enough yet to make it worthwhile.   T-shirt press... If you get interested in shirts at all, you will quickly come to want one. It is very hard to apply heat-transfer vinyl with a hand iron. You need to hit a pretty narrow temperature target. Once you have one, though... With that and a cutter, you are a t-shirt factory, if you want to be!"
crafts,3av4cb,StargateCommand,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:18:34 2015 UTC,"Very cool, thanks for the advice!  I think I'll give the eClips 2 a go because I'm unsure at this point how much future interest I'll have in the limited engraving functionality you talk about. From what I've seen of the air eraser method using aluminum oxide, it seems like an air eraser can also work to ""engrave"" many surfaces. I'll try it when I work up the expendable income for a compressor, then, if that doesn't work out, consider an upgrade to the eClips.  Part of the reason for this decision is I found a killer deal on a new eClips 2--$200 shipped, from scrapbook.com. Can't beat that with a stick! And the reviews I've read seem to all come from happy users. If it doesn't work for at least paper and vinyl, I'll have solid grounds to return it anyway.  I originally got started on this idea with acid method glass etching in mind, but the possibilities seem very broad, even with just cutting capability for thinner materials. Thanks for your tips! You've given me some great ideas on things I can accomplish even just being able to cut vinyl! I'm really looking forward to seeing what this machine can do."
crafts,3av4cb,StargateCommand,2,Wed Jun 24 19:21:45 2015 UTC,"$200 is awesome, congrats! Hit up craftvinyl for some supplies and you'll be set for a while.   In my (limited) experience the cheapest sort of non-permanent vinyl is good enough for etch mask. You can even find vinyl on Amazon, but I think craftvinyl is cheaper. Find a brand that works well before you stock up... be sure to check cuts with fine details, you don't want anything lifting off the glass, it all has to stay down nice and tight.   When you acid etch it will take some experimentation to find how long the etch needs to sit for a good result. It varies by type of glass, too. I found I got much better, more even results by using the applicator brush to stir the goop around once or twice during the waiting time."

crafts,3atja4,eewwee,2,Tue Jun 23 13:06:17 2015 UTC,Spirit gum. If you can't get to a costume shop then try eyelash adhesive from the beauty section.   Re-stickable is tough on faces due to oil and sweat.
crafts,3atja4,nixiedust,2,Tue Jun 23 14:03:20 2015 UTC,"Everything else mentioned in this thread would work, but I wanted to second the spirit gum suggestion. I've used it for exactly this. It doesn't stay sticky, so it's not 'restickable' in that sense, but I have reapplied spirit gum to foam pieces, right over dried spirit gum, so I can reuse them. I wipe them with isoprophol alcohol before reapplying to keep things clean, but it works just fine without it. If you build up enough layer of spirit gum (after about 10-12 uses) you can carefully peel it off, just like with regular prosthetics.  Liquid latex could work too, but I find that spirit gum is easier to work with. It dies much faster and it has a stronger hold. I usually use liquid latex if I need to blend seams or it something needs a little flex in the adhesive. Be sure to test patch first though! It's possible to have a spirit gum allergy, and for a small percentage of the population you can have a strange chemical reaction on your skin, where its not an allergy, but it just never fully dries. If you know for certain the latex doesn't irritate your skin, I'd bring it as a back up."

It allows you to easily create your own custom wallpaper, so that the main image you choose would be pixelated and the pixels are replaced by smaller photos.  The result is that you can see the main image from far, and as you comes closer the smaller images appear.  Here are some examples: http://imgur.com/a/7VXoh  Creating your mosaic wallpaper is very simple: 1. Choose your main image (upload directly or choose from Facebook or Dropbox). 2. Choose the final dimension (From 2x2m up to 8x3m), frame the image as you want it. 3. Upload the small images. 4. And that's it. You can then see a preview on the web page. And you can decide to either purchase the print, or only the high resolution image to print it yourself.    Do not hesitate if you have any questions!"

That should work. And if you want something just like resin that's non toxic, there's a mod podge product that's just like the resin. Can't remember the name right now"
crafts,3agy4z,DianeBcurious,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:39:12 2015 UTC,"The most common material would probably be epoxy resin, and for this tiny amount you could just use an epoxy glue from any hardware store. Resins, including epoxy resins, come in two parts which cure after they've been mixed together (and epoxy glue will cure much faster than regular epoxy resins).  One very clear-setting epoxy glue is Devcon's 2 Ton 30 min setting one, if that matters. You can read much more about using resins in my answer to this previous question at YahooAnswers (I'm Diane B. there): http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091115185640AAXBfZF and on this page at my site: http://glassattic.com/polymer/other_materials.htm for coloring resins if you want, see my answer here: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140118071238AAOocua  There are lots of other ways to create water and other liquids though, and to give them color. Check out my previous answer here about that: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20121106170119AAVza0G (Diane B.) And also check out the page at my site listed above, but look especially under the Faux Water subcategory (under the Epoxy Resins category).   Or you could also just try creating the wet effect with something else shiny...for example painting the inside of the cup brown then giving the paint a few coats of gloss finish (any kind, including clear fingernail polish).    OOPS, just noticed you want to make a large cup...I was assuming a miniature cup so using the glue wouldn't probably be an option and you'd have to buy regular epoxy resin...or even tweaked East Cast epoxy resin for this use. Or in fact, you could even use a ""floral setting resin"" if you don't mind a bit of dust gathering on the resin since it has a bit softer surface (that's the artificial water stuff that's often used to hold artificial flowers in correct positions inside clear vases...it's even safer and less fiddly than regular epoxy resin).  Resin would be a little heavy if it completely filled a life-size cup, but you could cheat and put the resin only on the top for example. So you might fill the cup with scrunched plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then pour the resin over it (that might create too many bubbles in the resin though because of all the little trapped air pockets). Or you could put in a filler, then put something like an upside down metal or plastic cap on top, then use a release on the inside of the cup, the cap, etc, with something like cooking oil, or you could drape waxed paper inside the top of the cup (though you'd perhaps see wrinkles in the resin later), then pour in the resin.  Let it set, then remove from the cup and glue it back in place (without or with the filler still in place)."

crafts,3ab6qa,Tashaskyes,3,Thu Jun 18 18:02:45 2015 UTC,"I would make a paper collar that sits up a little higher than the highest point on your coaster and tape it around the edges. Make sure your coaster is spotlessly clean and dry before using the epoxy. Let the epoxy fill the mold and self-level, so leave it on something flat. Let it dry for at least a day, then take the paper off. You may need to buff or lightly sand with 1000 to 1600 grit the edges to get all the residual paper off."
crafts,3ab6qa,Anne314,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:26:59 2015 UTC,Epoxy would be ideal since it's clear but you'd have to have a mold of the coasters or create an edging for the epoxy to stay in the grooves & stay level. You could use polymer clay (unbaked) to create a lip for the epoxy to sit atop. Remember to allow the epoxy to dry and harden befor you use it.  The only other thing you could use is polyurethane. Find something that wont melt the salt dough or wont run the paint?
crafts,3ab6qa,str4wberryp0undcak3,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:01:31 2015 UTC,"I hope you'll have enough time to thoroughly dry your salt dough pieces since that would be necessary before using any of the options below. (oops, I see that your question was posted 2 days ago, so you wouldn't have time to do most of the things I've written below if you hadn't dried the salt dough for 24 hrs, and resin can take 24 hrs or longer, but I'll leave my answer up in case you want to make more in the future, etc... Or next time you could use polymer clay for the coaster and at least speed up that part--see below**).  Epoxy resin would probably be the best if the impression is deeper than 1/8 - 1/4"".  You could use polyurethane but you'd have to use lots of layers, drying between each, or take a chance that just pouring it in and letting dry would give a clear enough result.  There are various kinds of epoxy resin though, and also you'd want to think about how you were going to cover/seal the outer higher parts of the coasters (all areas of air-dry clay must be sealed of course, especially when in contact with moisture later). For that second issue, the easiest thing would be to simply fill the impression with resin, then brush on more resin or just a gloss polyurethane from the hardware store to cover everything else (covering the cured resin with polyurethane is fine too). If that upper surface isn't high enough for you, just add a few more coats of polyurethane. ...Or you could try putting the item on a sheet of waxed paper (which acts as a release), then pouring the mixed resin into the impression but allowing it to overflow over the upper areas and also down the sides of the coaster (later use polyurethane or more resin to coat the underside once that's set).  ...Or better, put the coaster on top of a small jar (or anything that's narrower at the top than the bottom of the coaster) to elevate the coaster over the waxed paper.  That way, you can wick off the resin overflow as it drips off the sides.  As for the types of epoxy resin, you could just use regular epoxy resin (brands like Envirotex Lite, etc), or you could perhaps use the tweaked epoxy resin called Easy Cast.  If it's subjected to very much heat after curing, its surface can become a bit soft...don't know if that would happen for your use though. There's more about the kinds of epoxy resins, etc, in my previous answers here (look for Diane B.): http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091115185640AAXBfZF Easy Cast info/instructions, many of which apply to other epoxy resins: http://www.sculpt.com/technotes/Tech_Sheets/TECH_SHEET_EasyCast.pdf using resins in permanent cells and also in temporary molds. etc: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100521191232AACynOx  Btw I wouldn't use Mod Podge or any other PVA glue-based finish.  They will dry clear and glossy, but if wet things sit on them very long, some moisture will be absorbed creating temporary cloudy-white areas and they may also develop dents from the weight of things sitting on them very long (worse if they're also warm).   ** see my answers (Diane B.) here: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101211033832AAdQzSz http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090512071301AA9bnlg"

Spray paint shouldn't need that, but many of the other types may.  If it is easy for you to remove and replace the leaves, I would think that spray paint would be ideal.  Good coverage with no streaks, but it takes. a few minutes to get the technique right.  Practice on a scrap piece of cardboard or something until you get the hang of it.

crafts,3a8ivv,Fluffypillow0,2,Thu Jun 18 01:53:25 2015 UTC,"I suggest industrial strength hook and loop tape (Velcro) to hold the panels together while they hang. Glue the pictures on to panels of masonite board and cover with a good spray on sealer/protectant. Then attach the Velcro (it has adhesive on it) in at least two spots so the panels stay together. As for hanging it, just go to the hardware store and pick something. Of course you'll have to get hanging hardware for each panel. I'd probably paint the Masonite white before gluing the pictures on it, or at least use a couple coats of white primer."

crafts,3a6f5p,paintballer2112,3,Wed Jun 17 16:21:53 2015 UTC,"I can give you some tips from experience framing things in shadow boxes.  I'd recommend using actual glass, which will probably be lighter and cheaper (you can use a thin sheet same as for picture frames.  If you buy, salvage, or thrift thicker wood frames, you can build a box to fit it. Just make sure your hinges will hold the weight of the frame/glass and have enough wood to ""bite.""  For the wood, you should seal or paint the wood with something that won't off-gas and discolor your artifacts.  For the depth of the shadow box, you want the fabric to be completely clearing the glass (not touching the glass anywhere). Otherwise you will have a mold problem.  Use something light but stiff, like a colored foam-core board, and sew the artifacts to the board in many key places. You can use a good sewing thread or monofilament. This protects the artifacts by distributing the weight, and keeps them from shifting. It should also be removable. Knots can be taped down to the back of the board. Don't use any adhesives inside as they always fail (in my experience). Sewing in items and accent pieces is more reliable.   If you use a simple magnetic cabinet hinge, you can easily open the shadow box to dust and clean the glass. And change the artifact display as desired."
crafts,3a6f5p,kilamumster,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:25:13 2015 UTC,This is really good and informative advice. Thanks for sharing! I'd have never thought to sew the artifacts to the board.

crafts,3a6f5p,multiverse4,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"I would suggest buying an existing framing box (these aren't going to be any more expensive than trying to buy wood and plexi glass to make it). If you really want to make your own, 1)make the back wood or something else that isn't the plexi-glass; it'll make it easier to attach things and 2)plexi-glass is a COLOSSAL pain in the ass to saw (tends to shatter unless you're good at what you do), so avoid cutting it and try to find a piece you can buy in the size you want.

crafts,3a3y5h,YourWretchedness,3,Wed Jun 17 01:13:33 2015 UTC,"Most all regular resins take 24 hrs or more to harden, depending on humidity, temperature, etc.  There might be some that cure with special UV light, but those often don't work as well as purchasers would like.   If you want a resin that cures faster than regular resins though (resins don't actually dry to harden) once the two parts are mixed together and if your items need only small amounts of resin, you might want to check out 2-part epoxy glues.  They're the same thing as epoxy resin, but a bit thicker and sold especially for their adhesive properties. One of those epoxy glues that cures clearer than most brands/versions is Devcon's 2 Ton, 30 min setting (or something like that).  A friend of mine experimented with a bunch of different brands before discovering it. (The longer the setting time btw, the stronger the bond if that's a consideration and 30 min is pretty long for epoxy glues.)    I assume you're using resin for thin applications or coats, but if you're wanting to make things that are thicker than about 1/8"" inch and you don't want to have to do layers to get more thickness, you'd want to use a polyester resin rather than an epoxy resin since it can do that although it has problems of its own. (You could also use the in-between, tweaked epoxy resin called Easy Cast, but in warm/hot conditions it can become a bit soft on the surface also flex if its freestanding and thin.)    If you want to read more about the differences between epoxy and polyester resins, how to use both, brands, etc, check out some of my previous answers over at YahooAnswers (my username there is Diane B.): types & basics: http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091115185640AAXBfZF using resins in permanent ""cells ""and also in molds, etc: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100521191232AACynOx releases and molds especially + places to buy: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100206091500AA7eXFv coloring resins: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140118071238AAOocua"

crafts,39x7aw,harlemroulette,3,Mon Jun 15 15:27:38 2015 UTC,"Depending on what kind of light you're using I would suggest some kind of diffuser. If you have light stands with a space to attach an umbrella, that would work to spread the light out more as well as soften it so the necklace is more evenly illuminated. If you don't I've improvised before with sheer white fabric or even a sheet of printer paper taped to my camera's flash - this won't do much to distribute the light but it will definitely soften it and make the shine less harsh.  You may find something helpful in this link; they discuss softboxes which I think may also work for you.

crafts,39x7aw,harlemroulette,2,Mon Jun 15 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"Same here re: shaky hands. I would go to a thrift store and get a sheer curtain for a dollar or two and experiment with it around the necklace in different positions to see how it affects the light. Also if light is reflected onto it as opposed to shined directly on it, it will soften up a lot, so maybe experiment with a mirror as well - angle it so it catches the light and bounces it onto the necklace.  Holding the camera close to your body with your arms tucked in at your sides can also do wonders for shaky hands, though this does limit your shooting angles."

crafts,39rxf3,DamiesEmm,9,Sun Jun 14 04:10:20 2015 UTC,How did you do this? And why was it better than the other times?
crafts,39rxf3,insunnydale,7,Sun Jun 14 05:51:21 2015 UTC,Arseiam beat me to posting my comment on my previous thread.  This was different probably because I used masking tape to get crisp edges then used a varnish instead of modpodge for my finish. I was also really careful about applying the varnish without as many brush strokes showing in the final piece.
crafts,39rxf3,insunnydale,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:12:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! What kind of varnish did you use?
crafts,39rxf3,arseiam,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:11:10 2015 UTC,DuraClear Satin Varnish from the paint section at Jo-ann's. I always want to fiddle with the varnish and try to smooth it out but that causes more strokes to show than it prevents. xD

crafts,39rxf3,BlueSprite714,5,Sun Jun 14 05:58:57 2015 UTC,link to post about how I did it  Only difference is I used masking tape to get the edges where I wanted them and then used the rough side of the sponge to get the edges to look a bit worn. Also satin varnish instead of gloss modpodge.

crafts,39jq3f,addocd,9,Fri Jun 12 16:34:16 2015 UTC,"I HIGHLY recommend Dimensional Magic as a resin substitute. I did a lot of reading about Resin and found that it can actually be a toxic process, requiring face masks to block fumes in some cases. I just do crafts for fun, I'm not looking for safety hazards haha. My favorite aspect is that if you mess up or don't like how something turned out you can just soak the item in water and peel it right back up and try again. The video posted above is actually one of the first videos I ever watched about the product! You can get it at Wal-Mart and all the craft stores. I've found so many unconventional uses for it. I decorated my phone case with it using some paper cut outs and jewels about 3 years ago and it's still in great shape, so it definitely stands the test of time, too."

crafts,39jq3f,AislinKageno,3,Fri Jun 12 16:10:38 2015 UTC,"Yay! I use Mod Podge products for all the things I work on. I glued down the paper with Mod Podge Matte, then I put another layer on top of the paper to seal it in  (sometimes I use a gloss if I want the brush strokes to show). When using certain kinds of paper (like printer paper for example), the paper has a tendency to absorb the Dimensional Magic and either look splotchy or just darken the printed image, so I always recommend sealing the paper with a Mod Podge coat and letting it dry before adding the dimensional magic. Since I'm using calendar paper, it has a high gloss coat which really makes it pop once the mod podge sets."

I have used it under Diamond Glaze many times.  I was never able to find it in an actual store, but I ordered it from amazon and I also saw it online in several specialty shops.  It's $7 on amazon for 1 oz, but you use so little, it will probably last you years."

crafts,39jice,silverdae,7,Sat Jun 13 13:46:27 2015 UTC,"Unfinished Wood Placards (fairly obvious but I figured I'd make my list comprehensive) Photoshop/Lightroom for editing images Photos printed with a LASER printer. (inkjet won't work with this method) Simply Acrylic Matt Medium (no typos that's how they spelled it) 2"" Foam Brush Hard plastic Squeegee Kitchen Sponge ModPodge (Glossy)   I edited the pictures in lightroom and then cropped and scaled them as close as I could to the size of the placard I would be using. With the scalloped edged placard I measures it's widest point vertically and horizontally to be sure I was as close to the perfect size/shape as possible.  Then I printed them with my color laser printer on regular copy paper. InkJets don't work for this due to their water soluble ink just running, smearing, or bleeding out of the wood when you get to the peel off step.  Once printed I lay the images face up over the wood and held up to my desk light to get a feel for the placement of the images on the placards. Once I decided on proper placement I used my finger to bend the paper over the edge of the placard to cause a bent trace line I could follow to cut out the images as close to perfectly as possible. I then cut out the images, the scalloped edged one was a pain in the butt just so you know....  Next I covered my desk as much as I could with scrap paper and applied the Matt Medium to the printed side of the image, I basically put a blob in the middle and painted outwards with my foam brush to try and get as much coverage with as little waste as possible.   Once I had my picture coated I very carefully placed it image and matt medium side down making sure to align with my edges as best I could so the images would be fairly crisp at the edges, and not attach to the beveled sections of the wood.  Next I took my plastic squeegee  and slid it across the paper to push out bubbles and any excess matt medium, if any of the matt medium comes out then wipe it up with a scrap of paper because it will be much harder to remove if it is dry. Once it was flat I waited for a loooong time. (as in ran all my errands and such, probably 3-5 hours... more wont hurt if you want to err on the side of caution)  Now the fun/tedious part. Paper removal! I used a regular kitchen sponge (the sponge side not the scrubby side) to get the paper really damp, not quite soaked but enough you can see the wood grain through it. Then I squeezed out as much water from the sponge as I could to use it for rubbing the paper. It works faster than finger tips but is more gentle than a towel. The reason it can take a while and be tedious is you have to let it partially dry every now and them to see where any paper bits are left on the wood. You want to get as much off as possible unless you want a literally fuzzy looking transfer.  Once you have all the paper off and are happy with the transfer you seal it with whatever sealant you want. I used modpodge on these, but used an actual satin varnish on another project today. Both worked great but I prefer the look of the varnish personally.  And as an aside I pretty much followed this tutorial: link  I hope this was helpful xD"

I would have used spray adhesive for the inside pages just so it doesn't wrinkle as much. If you don't get what i'm saying just watch the video and it will make more sense. The way he does it makes it easy to customize and adjust for various sized paper and such.Link

It depends on how handy you are with fine motor skills, but I concur with /u/hunteqthemighty. Coptic stitch or even Japanese stab binding is great for this kind of thing. I would recommend getting some nicer paper, however.   If you have time, go get them printed at a print shop on some nice paper. They should have samples. You can play with color and texture this way. You can find some nice cover material at an art store (mat boards work well), or even find a nice piece of wood that you can drill for the cover, depending on how in-depth you want to make this thing.  Sealemon on Youtube has great bookbinding videos.  Coptic stitch  Japanese stab binding"

crafts,399738,WeavesByNightAndDay,3,Wed Jun 10 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"Scrimshaw:       Scrimshaw is the name given to scrollwork, engravings, and carvings done in bone or ivory. Typically it refers to the handiwork created by whalers made from the byproducts of harvesting marine mammals. It is most commonly made out of the bones and teeth of sperm whales, the baleen of other whales, and the tusks of walruses. It takes the form of elaborate engravings in the form of pictures and lettering on the surface of the bone or tooth, with the engraving highlighted using a pigment, or, less often, small sculptures made from the same material. However the latter really fall into the categories of ivory carving, for all carved teeth and tusks, or bone carving. The making of scrimshaw began on whaling ships between 1745 to 1759 on the Pacific Ocean, and survived until the ban on commercial whaling. The practice survives as a hobby and as a trade for commercial artisans. A maker of scrimshaw is known as a scrimshander.  The etymology is uncertain, but there have been several proposals.

I have done nothing but share my opinion of what appears to me to be a funny and silly, albeit unintentional, double meaning. If you can't handle a dissenting opinion or any criticism whatsoever without leaping into passive-aggressive tirades and acting smug and superior, then you need to really reassess some things.

I'm reading the thread because I'm curious about what others think, and I feel it's important to clarify that I don't find the design offensive, especially since you've been using the claim that I'm offended to dismiss any legitimate criticism I may have.   If you're so bored and unconcerned you can just like... move on? I'm not bored at all, because the more reasonable I am, the angrier you seem to get, and it's actually hilarious.

crafts,397wph,l97,2,Tue Jun 9 22:08:33 2015 UTC,"There is a technique of stencil painting with contact paper.  If you print out your design and tape it to the contact paper, you can use an exacto knife to cut out your design.  Remove the backing paper and put your contact paper on your project. Make sure that you put something (piece of scrap cardboard) inside the shirt to protect the other layer. Find fabric paint that cures without heat.  Use a sponge brush to evenly apply paint.  After the paint completely dries you can remove the contact paper and do another shirt."

crafts,38y4zm,xcemma,2,Sun Jun 7 21:00:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, you'd be surprised the variety of thicknesses that will go through a typewriter.  Your card stock will come out curled sometimes (or all the time), but it can be flattened after if you put it under a heavy weight immediately.  Or failing that, you can sandwich it between some other paper and iron it flat.  If anything, most of my problems were usually with running super thin papers through it.  I was forever creating tiny creases in the middle of the sheets.    As for ideas, what kind of typwriter do you have?  You might be able to dig up some other cool cartridges for a variety of fonts and ding-bat type stuff.      You can create interesting imagery by layering the lettering.  This one is super goofy, being Prince Charles and all, but it has the added bonus of instructions on how to make it.  I'm sure you could find more patterns online.  Do a couple to learn a few layering tricks which you can then apply in other ways - one of the more obvious being decorative edging.    As I said before, you'd be amazed at what will go through a typewriter just fine, but when you're having trouble (ie, say you want to type on something like a piece of ribbon), consider layering the item on different types of substrates to help it through the rollers.  Don't be afraid of it.  You'll have some waste here and there, but you'll learn bunches once you start challenging the limits of the machine.    I used to play with my typewriter on my lunch hour at work.  :)  p.s.  Make sure to keep the rollers clean, and always look at them first for minor dirt or alignment problems if you are having consistency issues in your work."

That's what I do with my stuff like that, though I do save a stack of newspapers for emergencies--making fires, cooking, etc.  There are lots of other things you can do with leftover newspapers and magazines though. For example, you could do papier mache, or make papier mache ""clay,"" or make paper pulp to use for fancy homemade papers.  Loads of possibilities there.    Here are many more though: https://www.google.com/images?q=newspaper+crafts https://www.google.com/search?q=newspaper+crafts https://www.google.com/images?q=recycled+magazine+crafts+for+kids https://www.google.com/images?q=how+to+make+magazine+crafts  You might also be able to donate some of your piles to a local teacher (kindergarten to high school) for papier mache, paper mache ""clay,"" or specific projects they might do using newspaper or magazines. (One thing that kids really like is rolling newspaper sheets on the diagonal over a dowel, securing the end tip with gluestick, then using the long newspaper tubes after removing dowels to build freeform or other structures along with masking tape to connect the tubes.)  You'll be continuing to get newspapers and magazines forever though, so only recycling will keep your house from looking like a hoarder's, unfortunately. Another option would be to just start reading your newspapers and magazines online (most have e-editions), or to even stop taking some of them."

Sometimes I combine the plaster with glue and ripped up toilet paper if I'm trying to really smooth out an area, but sometimes the toilet paper can cause more problems than it's worth."
crafts,38qbse,HairyPits,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:58:10 2015 UTC,"The product called ""Celluclay"" is basically ground up papier mache (the water is added at home to make it claylike).  Or you can buy Celluclay already mixed with water.  Those would be available at most hobby stores and art supply stores.  Or just make paper pulp yourself: https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+make+paper+pulp+blender  You can  use almost any other clay-like substance you want on papier mache though.  Some will be much finer or smoother than others, some you can make at home where others are purchased, some will shrink while drying (anything water-based) where some won't shrink but will require brief oven-baking (polymer clay) or won't shrink but will begin curing once the two parts are mixed together (epoxy-like clays...ApoxieSculpt, Fixit, etc).   Some of the purchased air-dry clays have finer-ground bits in them than others, and that would also go for any other material you mixed with water, PVA glue, or whatever to make it into a shapable material.  One of the finest with the least shrinkage would be something like LaDoll.  Other cheaper ones with various amounts of shrinkage would be Creative Paperclay, Crayola Air Dry Clay, Model Magic, etc.   There's also something you can make called ""papier mache paste"" or clay.  There are various recipes for it. Here are some: http://familycrafts.about.com/cs/papermache/a/blpmpastes.htm ...or use dryer lint, etc, mixed with the glue to make others  You should definitely also check out the work of other papier-machers and many will also have tutorials. Dan Reeder is one possibility I think you'd like, though he's mostly having to start all over again online after technical problems and most of his beginner videos are gone; you can still see his process in any of the videos he has though. He most often uses balls/etc of newspaper held in shape with masking tape, then adds layers of flat newspaper with his hand and a flour-water mixture, then lets dry (often removing the interior scrunched aluminum foil that's dry to make the piece lighter, etc), and covers with masking tape...finally does a layer of ""cloth mache"" (pieces of cotton bedsheets soaked in Elmer's Glue All) to cover all and add new parts, and adds some premade polymer clay pieces along the way; finally paints: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLY-cpuLpEE Oh, or start with part 1 of this video for more explanation, some different ways, and more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt33q82JTmc  You might also be interested in my previous answer at YA about the various ways that papier mache can be done, etc: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110120014300AAfGvNG and here: http://www.make-craft-projects.com/paper-mache.html  As for smoothing if you don't just use outermost materials that are fine grain, sanding is one option.  Start with the largest grit you'd need to remove the upper areas, then use finer grits as you get smoother and smoother.  Some people also use rasps or knives at various points.  For smoothing the clay-like materials, you might get some hints about doing that from the pages at my site about how to smooth polymer clay since some techniques could be similar: http://glassattic.com/polymer/sculpture.htm (click on Fingerprints, Smoothing) http://glassattic.com/polymer/sanding_tumbling.htm (click on Smoothing Before Sanding)"

crafts,38qf04,skyleaper,2,Sat Jun 6 04:25:30 2015 UTC,"That sounds interesting and I think there would be quite a lot of people who would be keen to buy these. It would definitely be a conversation starter!   I think your best bet is going to be ""pickling"" them in tiny jars of formaldehyde/formalin. Resin preservation sounds good in theory but bacteria would exist inside the fetus and would continue to break down the organic material since the resin wouldn't be able to actually enter the tissues of the rat to seal them off. You'll just end up with an encapsulated bubble of rot.   Preserving in formaldehyde solution would be really cheap and would work perfectly. You can also buy tiny little craft jars that look like apothecary or science equipment. You'd just need to seal them extremely well. There are loads of guides around the internet on how to go about this. There are also several other liquid preservatives available that you could experiment with too.  Good luck! Don't worry about anyone who thinks it's gross or weird. While I wouldn't wear something like this myself, I think it's a really cool concept and there are always going to be people with greatly varying tastes."
crafts,38qf04,Lets_play_numberwang,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! About how long do you think I should submerge them in the preservative for?  Edit: nvm, i'm stupid. Do you think I could inject them with resin?"
crafts,38qf04,starslightsailor,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:11:10 2015 UTC,"Bio student here - If you want to preserve them in formalin, submerge the specimen in a large amount of formalin (Like a 1:20 ratio) for at least 72 hours, maybe longer.  It could maybe then be possible to cover them in resin as the tissue is preserved and immortalised already so it wouldn't putrefy inside the resin. However, I'm not sure how missible the resin and formalin would be, so there might be an issue there, it might be easier to keep them in sealed formalin jars.  However formalin doesn't preserve colour and gross structure the best. Plastination is better for preserving the gross anatomy and keeping it most visibly in tact. Plastination is similar to what you want to do with resin. However it does require a vacuum so might not be the easiest thing to do.  Not exactly my thing but it's certainly a unique concept, I suppose?"
crafts,38qf04,6NippleCharlie,2,Sat Jun 6 02:38:32 2015 UTC,I'm sure you can find the material they use to preserve organs and what not. Tiny jars with a preserved rat fetus inside a strange liquid would be rad.
crafts,38qf04,UndeadKitten,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:38:30 2015 UTC,"I'd buy one and wear it with pride!  I did make some tiny foetuses out of polymer clay and sunk them in resin, they looked really cool, I did 3 human ones and 2 mythical creatures. It was pretty tough getting the detail on that tiny. They did look quite realistic though especially if you tint the resin amniotic fluid pink.   I'd say if they are real ones, then pickling would be the best way as others have suggested and seal up the tops good and proper.   I have done a little bit of home taxidermy/pickling (A friend of mine donated some rabbit foetuses to me (he eats off the land and had accidentally shot a rabbit who was pregnant) Waste not, want not I say!! :)  EDIT: punctuation"

Drywall is covered in paper and even though it is often textured, the mud doesn't completely cover it. People primer walls & then paint detail over that all the time. Weight, flexibility/cracking and moisture marking of the paper not covered is what you'd need to test for, I think."

crafts,389ekn,NurseAmy,6,Wed Jun 3 01:26:43 2015 UTC,"Very cool!  Would like to see a better staining substance used on it but totally great anyway.  It's only missing the toilet paper, or stack of newspaper to use instead...lol.  I love dioramas and handmade miniatures.  Btw, if you want air-dry clays to last well and be impervious to moisture damage or even critters, just seal them (all over, even down in holes, etc) with a permanent sealer.  The cheapest permanent clear sealer would be Elmers Glue All, etc, thinned down a bit with water, or just Mod Podge instead. Or use a clear polyurethane if you have one.  The PVA glue will dry a bit glossy, but you can tone that down by ""sanding"" it a bit with steel wool or various scrub sponges or with an abrasive powder like Comet; then buff a little to remove any dusty stuff. Or just use polymer clay (Premo, Kato Polyclay, Fimo, Sculpey, etc) instead of an air-dry clay like salt dough, then bake it in an oven since polymer clay is naturally waterproof and never needs sealing. However, if your mound-base would be thicker than 1 1/4"" in any part, use a permanent armature inside the polymer clay so it could be thinner than that--something like a tightly-scrunched wad of aluminum foil.)"
crafts,389ekn,MrHiym,3,Tue Jun 2 20:16:36 2015 UTC,Thanks! I totally sealed that thing! I put 3 layers of an acrylic sealant on it. Salt dough is just not a very sturdy material. I am going to make a small shadowbox diorama for this eventually.

crafts,3883ht,dromedarian,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"I would suggest crochet or cross stitch.   Crochet is my go to thing, but it takes a little more patience to learn. The ""how"" is easy, it just takes practice to get good tension and stuff. Fortunately it's very mindless, just repetitive motion, so you'll easily be able to concentrate on talking with people while you do it. Lap or baby blankets are great for beginners because after just one small blanket, you've mastered crochet. You tube and gifs are great for teaching yourself.   Cross stitch is far easier to learn, and you can get a 97 cent kit from wal mart to see if you like it. I suggest a you tube video to learn with the kit, because the directions that come with it can be confusing. The down side to cross stitch is it's not as compact as crochet. Crochet is easy to keep in your bag and just set your stuff down when you need to quickly focus on something else. You don't have to dig out your other supplies often (scissors, yarn needle, etc) and the yarn all stays together in your craft bag as you use it. Cross stitch has a lot of bits lying around, mostly a dozen or more thread colors. My current big project has 75 colors, and a simpler one I have going uses 35."
crafts,3883ht,annfro,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:11:35 2015 UTC,crochet or knitting is great because it is easy to multi-task when you are doing them. You just have to keep count in your head.
crafts,3883ht,WhipStitchDesigns,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:24:41 2015 UTC,I would totally second cross stitch. It's super easy to hide under a desk if a supervisor walks by too!
crafts,3883ht,DianeBcurious,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:52:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with small crochet or knitting projects.  Cross stitch is easy and small to hide, but you might have to hold it closer to your face and really pay attention so could be harder to quickly put away and you might not want to use the kinds that have separate patterns to follow, and they can have too many threads to keep up with. Hand embroidery and ribbon embroidery can really pass the time too, and can be done in a very small hoop or without a hoop (on clothing or regular fabric), but again you wouldn't want to use too many thread colors at the same time and have to keep cutting and switching.  You could do other hand-crafts though if kept small like some kinds of ""beading,"" kumihimo, wirework, etc. And you could even focus on making things for other occasions (xmas, Halloween, etc) or for something at home or things you could finish at home.  Another thing could actually be clay btw if you made small things and if you used polymer clay since it will never harden so no worries about it drying out.  You could make all kinds of beads and miniatures, for example, and need only your hands, or perhaps something like a toothpick. (You'd need to put the clay onto/into something non-porous though when not using it for awhile since it's oil-based and could leach out some of its oil, and you might want something to put the finished items in that would keep them apart and protected depending on their shapes --e.g., most beads wouldn't need much protection-- but I can see easy ways to do that.)  How much time do you have to hide things though?--2 seconds or 30 seconds? And how much space do you have for hiding them and where would they be hidden?  For example, do the crafts/items need to be hidden under something right on your desk, or would you need to open a drawer or put something near your feet, etc?  (The best thing would be to find another job though!)"

crafts,38811y,kystar,2,Tue Jun 2 16:35:50 2015 UTC,"Well, you can shave it off with an exacto blade or chisel after putting a stencil on to correct your handwriting issue, then add a little bit of leather dye into the depression to give a contrast as it ages. Paint doesn't hold well on leather, so that's out.  To get more omph out of a stamp without catching the frame, you could either dampen the leather with warm water, or heat the stamp so it makes more of an impression. From what a leatherworking friend of mine told me, both together work great."
crafts,38811y,kystar,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks, that's really helpful!  What do you mean by ""putting a stencil on""?  I hadn't thought of trying stenciling -- can you do that with pyrography?  I was imagining writing the numbers freehand but that might make more sense."
crafts,38811y,kystar,3,Tue Jun 2 18:39:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry, didn't realize that wasn't a phrase everyone used!  ""Putting a stencil on"" refers to pre-marking the area to be carved or burned by tracing a stencil and filling in the area with a removable, but visible medium, like chalk or pencil. That way, the stencil isn't damaged by the tool being used, but the visual style of a stencil is preserved. Once you have the area marked, you can come back with your tool and make the permanent marks.   For fonts and stuff that aren't available as a stencil, you can use graphite transfer paper to get the image/letters/numbers onto the piece to be worked, simply by printing it out, then tracing over it with the graphite transfer sheet in between the paper and the crafting piece. Carbon copy is what is used to be called."

crafts,3885rk,BikiniKillTodd,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"Those were my first two thoughts too, collage (maybe in a frame) or a resin tabletop.  Do you want to have each pass shown in its entirety though?  That would make the space required fairly large for 200-300 pieces.  Or could just some of them show, e.g., overlapped or pieces cut out, etc?  You could also decoupage something like the side of a cabinet or bookcase, or the fronts of drawers with the passes.  That wouldn't involve resin like the tabletop would, but instead thinned-down PVA glue (or Mod Podge), topped with a coat of clear polyurethane for best protection.  If some of the passes are thick though, you'll need a lot of layers of Mod Podge (or try to peel any apart if possible), and if any of the passes are porous paper you'd want to seal them first unless your surface is white.  You could also turn them into ""books"" or even ""pads"" with PVA glue or padding compound.   Or do some kind of scrapbook.  Or you could photocopy them and do something with the photocopy/photocopies. You could also transfer images of them onto cotton fabric and use the fabric to make your own totebags, lapquilts, etc."

It may be one person or a class of 10 (you'd charge more per person for fewer people, of course).

crafts,380h4r,rizzobeth,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:31:04 2015 UTC,thank you!   Didn't take too long! I did the nailing one weekend and the string another day. It was first time experimenting with string art so that took up a little extra time. I think the most challenging part was figuring how i wanted the string to look. I had tried embroidery floss but in gray first but it kept unraveling on me so i took that off and got hemp cord string but in gray which was much stronger (which is what you see here). Overall i would do it again but i think i would add more nails! to get more detail of the tower when i string! I saved my template so i am going to give it another go!

crafts,37rv3q,BeurredeTortue,2,Sat May 30 11:24:58 2015 UTC,"Have you ever tried paying for an hour or so at quilt stores to use their long arm quilting machines, then zip that quilting right on in any pattern you want (or just meandering squiggles/etc)? I'm with you about the quilting after piecing (and also sandwiching which isn't my favorite thing to do either).  I can't hand quilt with hand problems (and not sure I'd want to), but machine quilting even a 4x6' lap quilt is just not easy to do on a regular home sewing machine!  So I've also thought about renting time on those long arms now that it seems to be available (I think shop owners help get the quilt set up and show how to move the arm, etc)."
crafts,37rv3q,DianeBcurious,2,Sat May 30 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"I'll have to look and see if there are any quilt shops in my area that offer this.  I know one of the ladies I work with does the piecing then pays someone to quilt it for her, but I'm pretty sure that's out of my price range."
crafts,37rv3q,BeurredeTortue,2,Sat May 30 18:31:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the people who are paid to hand-quilt charge quite a lot (understandably).  That's why the recent proliferation of long arm machines has been so great.  Many quilters who own them have even begun machine-quilting other people's quilts in their homes to make money (much cheaper than hand-quilting), and I've been surprised by how many quilters now own them just for their personal use!  If you can't find long arms you could use in your area, you might ask local quilt shops or quilt guilds in your area for names of those who own them and might do the long arm quilting for a fee. And btw, that's one reason I often tie my quilts, especially the lap-size ones!"

crafts,37pu5m,RogueCoon,8,Fri May 29 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"I made a similar gift for a group of friends when one of us got married and moved away from the area; I chose ~175 photos I had taken of us over a 5 year period, cut the backgrounds out, and layered the photos chronologically from oldest to newest, top to bottom, in the outline of the state we lived in.  http://imgur.com/HClwDac  I had it printed at 24""x36"" and framed for each of us. Not really feasible for most people since it took me at least 100+ hours over the course of months in Photoshop to cut out all the image backgrounds. You might be able to do something similar with rougher-cut images in way less time that would actually have its own charm (instead of doing what I did with magnetic lasso, you could cut out images using the polygonal lasso tool much quicker, leaving obvious cuts around the people, which would look more like a traditional, physical collage of cut-up printed photos).  Zazzle.com does very nice poster prints for reasonable money. I'd recommend semi-gloss over matte simply because the poster I made came out a little duller than I wanted on completely matte paper."

Then I finish them with either beads or a drop feather in the center. The bottom drops are the last thing, I tie them on and then add beads and feathers.   These are all made with wild turkey or goose feathers. I try to avoid feathers from crafts stores because I've never liked the neon colored feathers, I much perfer the natural colors in the turkey feathers. It's hard to source the wild feathers however, because I have to get them from friends that hunt and often time they are a little rough with them before they get the feathers to me."

I stretch the yarn one space and tie it off again, do this all the way around until you get back to where you started.  Then start on the enter weaving.  Tying off to every line you make and you eventually make it to the center where you can't make any more loops."

I imagine if I were to use a dremel, then I would have to make a wooden contraption that allowed me to place the dremel down solidly and horizontally, and then be able to place the plug down on an appropriately sized holding circle on the contraption and just spin it safely around til the whole thing is filed. But making that contraption might be out of my capability."
crafts,37ifia,lick_spoons,2,Wed May 27 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"You're planning doing this as a business, so you might want to approach this from a mass production standpoint. Holding things with your hands and filing them individually by hand is not realistic. You need to design a jig. Any time you want to make a hundred+ of something, a jig will always save you time/money in the long run. I can't tell you what said jig would look like because I've not done what you're doing, but if you're serious about making money off of this, it's worth figuring out how to minimize the time spent on each plug, right off the bat.   I personally would build something that allowed me to do more than one at the same time. I'm imagining putting 20+ plugs onto a shaft spun by a motor (this could be a drill or whatever). Then there's some sort of abrasive set of teeth on a stationary bar which fit into each groove. You spin it for a minute, get the grinding done, switch to a finer sanding toothed bar, and then down to a polisher.   Or, as the other fellow pointed out, you could use a lathe. Take a cylinder of wood or metal or whatever, carve out your channels (possibly with a similar toothed bar as above) and then cut in into pieces to get you plugs (some sanding required). Same process, but here you tarting with a solid shaft and cutting it up. Probably cheaper and less fiddley in the long rin than buying individual little wheels and doing them one by one.  If jig making and welding and machining  not your comfort zone, I would talk to a machinist. They love problem solving and can build anything. And are generally great people to know. It will be worth whatever you have to pay, just to be able to avoid making these things one at a time."
crafts,37ifia,YESmynameisYes,1 point,Thu May 28 04:14:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I actually cut the little individual pieces using an industrial laser cutting/etching machine. It sounds like you inspected pretty closely so I assume that you noticed that the plug is made of 3 circles of wood glued together. This material is useful because it has a white face on it so I can etch images onto that face with the laser etcher. Part of the spark of interest if the detail I can put onto a plug.  So cutting the plugs from a cylinder would bring complications and limits into that part of things. Do you know though, if I'd be able to get little rubber grabbers to just grab the plugs firmly on the lathe and just spin it so I can use the same hand file that I've been using on it? I'm pretty unfamiliar with a lathe, but it looks like in every video I'm seeing, the lathe's little grabbers are literally inside the object that its spinning."

Perhaps the sprays other posters have mentioned work better.  Good luck!! Make sure to post pics once you're done! :)"

crafts,37gw83,akisej,1 point,Wed May 27 15:24:37 2015 UTC,"I can't find a picture - drat - but what about a sort of organizer basket? You could cover them on the outside with cute shelf paper or fabric, and then fill with those pretty washed pebbles to hold makeup brushes or maybe pens. Without the stones, you could just use them to organize stuff on a shelf so it would still look cute because of the covering.  I recall seeing a blog post once where someone took a wooden fruit box, covered it with pretty wall paper, and added a mirror in the bottom. Then they covered some plastic containers and some tin cans with shelf liner and added some bows and such to decorate them to match with the wall paper. The mirror and containers were arranged so that hair ties, pins, bows, etc went in the containers sitting below the mirror. Sorry no picture, but it was cute. I think those might be the wrong size for that, though."

crafts,37a8vb,duckies_wild,2,Tue May 26 13:31:37 2015 UTC,I couldn't find a tutorial that was exactly like this one but I can describe the method. I actually took a little workshop to do this. I covered peg board with grey fabric and looked at this picture for inspiration. Bicycle cross stitch . I changed it up a little. Some people did have to pre poke the fabric but that would depend on your fabric/yarn choice.   If I did it again I'd probably spring for an actual stretched canvas as the finished product looks nicer as well as buy yarn specifically for it (i just used what was at the workshop).

crafts,37aawx,Anne314,1 point,Tue May 26 14:02:58 2015 UTC,I've been making things for many years & do a lot of work with decoupage mediums on a variety of surfaces including furniture. The Polycrylic mentioned above is what I use as well & it works like charm!
crafts,37aawx,Ismelllikecannabis,2,Wed May 27 11:58:42 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, most clear sealers are affected by moisture even after they ""dry,"" and also in some cases even after they ""cure"" which can take a week or longer. Some will absorb moisture and become cloudy in color until they dry out again, but all will soften if exposed to too much moisture too long and then they will become somewhat sticky.  They'll be sticky in places where they aren't getting much air circulation, especially touching other things and if those things are porous (paper, etc), they'll likely stick worse.  The German product you mentioned seems to be more than just a clear sealer.  It's a ""dimensional"" sealer intended for creating dimensional lines, shapes, coverage, etc, above the normal sealed surface (see below). It's probably the same as some of the ""gel mediums"" sold by Golden or Liquitex in the U.S.: http://www.goldenpaints.com/products/medium-gels-pastes/gel http://www.dickblick.com/products/liquitex-gel-mediums (""modeling/molding pastes"" are similar, I think, but they're opaque)  So are you particularly wanting to create dimensionality in your clear sealer?    If not, and you just want a good clear sealer for decoupaged items, thinned-down PVA glue (""permanent white glue,"" ""craft glue,"" etc) is the most often used (or a product that's already thinned down and sold as a ""decoupage medium"" like Mod Podge, Royal Coat, etc).  Those will dry clear and glossy but won't be as tough against moisture absorption and scratching as adding a coat of clear polyurethane on top of the dried glue/decoupage medium. Polyurethane comes in gloss, satin and matte versions, and also in water-based and non-water-based versions (you probably want gloss, water-based). It can even be heated a bit (say 200-250 F for 10-20 min) in a home oven to harden/toughen it even more if you want. Again, you'd want to let it cure for up to a week before putting it in situations with little air-circulation, too much humidity, or too much cold, etc, for best results down the line. You can buy polyurethanes at hardware and home improvement stores in the aisles for sealing bare wood.  (I like Rustoleum's Varathane but other brands will work too.)    These are descriptions I found for your product (Google-translated):  ""For great 3-D effects in decoupage. Transparent water-based paint for decoupage. The paint is applied directly fed from the bottle on the glued and dried napkins motif. Is particularly suitable for highlighting individual excerpts of the subject, resulting in a plastic effect, appears after drying transparent.""  ""Transparent water-based paint leads to 3-D effects in decoupage. Is simply applied out of the bottle at the attached motif napkins. Individual points can thus be highlighted. With Hobby Line acrylic paints to color.""  ""Hobbyline POTCH Plus 3-D effect 80ml... Transparent water-based paint leads to 3-D effects in decoupage.... is simply applied out of the bottle at the attached motif napkins. Individual points can be highlighted so. colored with acrylic paints."""

crafts,37aawx,DianeBcurious,1 point,Tue May 26 05:30:15 2015 UTC,It needs to be sealed. Most of those things have a cure time too where they won't harden completely for like 60 to 90 days

It may be worth calling a chain store to see if they have an associate available who could help with any questions you have. It's also worth nothing that the instructors at Michael's (can't speak for Joann's) are essentially independent contractors. The ""tuition"" for the classes pretty much goes straight to them, so you're supporting the teachers rather than the company.

They are under a buck so buy a dozen in various colors. Read the label to know what colors you are buying.  Get a large canvas. Some paint brushes (assuming she doesn't already have some). Get some ink transfer paper,put it on the canvas tape the picture over it and trace all the lines of the picture.  Remove everything and BAM! Cheaply made paint by number kid that you hand made."

Just one way would be to bead a flat turtle shape --the front and back side as one piece-- later folded over then sewn together, and stuffed with something like polyester stuffing; or perhaps it's made in two or more separate parts then sewn together before stuffing. Some of the smaller ones are all small beads sewn around each other to create the dimensionality. And some may be bead-woven around something else (a larger bead, or any fairly rigid 3D shape).

crafts,36lipo,meext,1 point,Fri May 22 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"What kind of 3M adhesive are you using? You might have best luck with their mounting spray since it's intended for permanent adhesion of paper. The only thing other than that I can think you might be doing is not letting the underlying adhesive dry thoroughly enough. When adhesives are under several layers of paper they can take well upwards of 24 hours to dry and a solid week to properly ""cure"". Give it as long as you can before using the clear coat, and if it's okay for the specific product you're using, multiple layers of clear coat might help too. Between the materials of them and the inevitable wear and tear, attaching anything to a car is difficult at best though."

crafts,36dylf,CraftCrib,7,Mon May 18 17:05:30 2015 UTC,Cute! I think using E6000 glue instead would hold better and have less chance of leaking through. Although it does take longer to dry. You could also thread a jump ring onto the wire to hang as a necklace!

crafts,36f87t,Cronamash,6,Mon May 18 22:41:57 2015 UTC,Maybe a very light coating (brushed on) of e-6000 glue? Be sure that it is completely dried before closing the fan. I use this glue on many craft projects.

crafts,36f87t,smallstrangegod,2,Tue May 19 01:09:53 2015 UTC,It's a pretty strong hold once it's cured. I can't say 100% sure because I've only used it for crafts (I made huge roger rabbit feet with it once and I've fixed things in the house) I bought mine at my grocery store in the craft section. I think they sell it at hardware stores as well. They might even have a version to use on fabric. Lemme go check....
crafts,36f87t,meghalady,3,Tue May 19 03:02:28 2015 UTC,E-6000 should work for something like this. I've been seeing it pop up more and more at craft and hobby shops.
crafts,36f87t,smallstrangegod,2,Tue May 19 05:50:02 2015 UTC,"Fabric one if fabric on fabric so scratch that. But I would say if you use a brush and put on a thin layer it would adhere to the plastic even though it's mesh.  I would say modpodge is another possibility but I'm not sure of it's strength. I've only used modpodge for paper machè type crafts.  Gorilla glue is another option, that I have no experience with.  E-6000 is available on amazon too. You could test it with gluing some plastic silverware to some t-shirt rags and once its cured see how easy it is to rip it off. Give it time to cure though. It would suck if the fan dried shut."

crafts,367x5v,chalkchick0,4,Sun May 17 03:37:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting suggestion! I'll definitely bring it up to my boss. However she wanted it to look a little less pirate-y. We're a museum that mostly has stuff from the pioneering days to WWII era items, and it's all artifacts from the local area. The museum is situated in the prairies, nowhere near where pirates would be. So I guess that's her reasoning behind not wanting a pirate-y treasure chest (However personally I think that kids love pirates and don't really care that it's not geographically correct lol). But, she's the boss I guess. Haha. To kind of follow her idea, I was going to just transfer pictures of road maps of the area onto the sides and front of the box."

Don't know how much flexing you need though.  You could add things here and there on the bracelet though so you wouldn't have large expanses to cover (and not much flexing).  If those ""rubber"" bracelets are silicone though, like many, almost nothing sticks well to silicone including glues.  You could try other kinds of ways to attach things to silicone though like wire-wrapping or thread-wrapping, making holes then attaching with brads, wires, etc."

Amazon has a pretty good variety at very reasonable prices, that's where I get mine from, and I buy a lot of rhinestones. I will mention I personally don't pay the extra for the higher quality Swarovski, and I use e6000 so I don't buy the hotfix kind, so those variables may change you results. But if you want lots of rhinestones for not a lot of money, Amazon."

Since feathers, fur, and hair are all made of keratin, there's no reason the dye shouldn't work.  I would also guess that dye for hair is going to be more gentle than most dyes, since it's designed to be used around living skin and growing hair.  You may need to dye it a couple of times to assure even coverage, but since they're already white, you have a good starting place. Good luck!"

crafts,35j776,the_ckime,3,Sun May 10 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"I don't actually think Etsy is worth bothering with, personally. I tried running an etsy shop. Their policies are very limiting, their fees can stack quickly. I was listing jewelry but they wanted to tack the full listing price per item in a multi-item list. So, you bead three necklaces the same just because that's how much you have. No matter how you list them (Together or separate) you are still paying (at the time) $0.40 per necklace. One relative was telling me how you have to make sure you're always on that front page crawler to get exposure, so you're listing things multiple times a day, and instead of waiting for the listing to end, if you're limited in stock, you should cancel it and relist to bump it back to the front if it doesn't sell quickly enough, which means stacking fees again. Add to that the fact that they opened up in like 2011 to ""manufacturing partnerships"" or whatever they're calling allowing commercial manufacturing places to list, and now they're flooded with cheap Asian knock-off ""crafts"" stores.   In my opinion, you're better off putting the toe in the water at a farmer's market, craft show, or maybe even a flea market before going through the hassle of an Etsy shop."
crafts,35j776,kystar,2,Mon May 11 17:24:59 2015 UTC,"If you're in an oversaturated market like jewelry, then yeah, etsy won't be worth it for you unless you have some incredibly specific or unique selling point. I found my own niche that doesn't really have quality products, and I like to think that I have a lot of potential on Etsy once I have enough variety."
crafts,35j776,sneaky_dragon,3,Mon May 11 21:26:08 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for etsy since I don't use it (it's not the best for the kind of art I do), but I can provide some insight to pricing art. When you begin to price your work, take into account what you spend on materials (pots, paints, sealers, etc) and start with that. You can figure out generally how much a single piece costs to produce with this information.  On top of that, I know etsy charges to post items, so add that to your material cost, and then figure out about how much it costs to ship one piece (you can take a boxed up, ready to ship piece to the post office and ask them). All of these expenses make the lowest you can charge to break even. To make a profit, I generally figure out how long it takes me to finish a piece and how much I would like to make an hour. This number can be added directly to your material cost and then you have your price. However, you also should take into account the quality of your work. You need to take a serious and objective look at how a finished piece looks (this can be difficult and might hurt, but is necessary). Do not go any lower than your material cost, but you might have to change your profit. Since you seem to be just starting out, and are essentially a newcomer to the market, you will probably have to price your work lower (therefore making less per hour) than someone with a more established clientele. I hope what I say makes sense!"

At that point, as long as the cost to make your products is small and you're doing it more as a hobby then I personally see no reason not to.  I have an etsy shop that I have put minimal effort into and I get about two or three orders a month.  For me, it couldn't be any more perfect.  If you have any questions feel free to PM me and make sure to check out /r/etsy  But overall? I don't see what it can hurt"

Just play Epona's song in front of any cow, and it will give you some LonLon Milk (as long as  you are carrying an empty bottle.)

crafts,35ig4m,Tenshi_girl,1 point,Sun May 10 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"How solid does it need to be? Would a really thick jelly, like cold tea thickened with twice as much agar as needed, do?"

crafts,35ig4m,timbervibe,1 point,Sun May 10 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"No, but who actually needs to see through it?  Unless you're in a very intimate setting, no one off stage would be able to tell one way or another.  I'm assuming this is supposed to be on the cheap? If not, there is a type of wax 'glaze' used for specialty candles. I've never worked with ur before. Last candle option, you can get candle gel.  It's pretty much like jello, and it won't fall out if you turn it upside down (maybe after a long while).  Probably get it at a big box craft store. It is transparent."

Castin' Craft also makes two-part epoxy resin, which I don't recommend. I like the polyester much more. The dyes are kept right alongside the resin and molds."

crafts,35gdp1,Stellaaaaa,1 point,Sun May 10 02:25:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, heavier snips will be good. Otherwise you'll ruin your regular ones. Try making an arrangement flat on a table first to see what looks good. And/or ask a friend to hold the stems as if in a vase as you arrange them to get a sense of how tall you want it over all, and to compare the stem heights. Keep in mind that it's ok to be conservative and snip 2x to get it right. This prep work is just to build the image in your head of what you want and the confidence to do it. We're pretty good at eyeballing so many things!"

After I started the pattern, I did a quick google search and discovered that someone did add a Hawkeye to theirs, which I wish I had done!    I don't know how to link to it since the image seems to be broken, but if you want to see the version that includes Hawkeye, it should be one of the first few results if you image search ""Avengers cross stitch sprite.""
