Terraria,3e2q0y,spincrus,40,Tue Jul 21 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"Creator's Notes:  The Sephirot in the very center is a teleportation hub. (Look up a pic of the Sephirot if you want to know what I'm talking about in the next paragraph!)  Keter takes you to a sky grinder arena/skyrail station. Binah and Chokhmah lead to a greenhouse and item-storage/crafting, respectively (both of which are still under progress); the others lead to various biomes. Gevurah takes you to the Dungeon, Hesed takes you to the jungle, Hod takes you to a crimson-tundra, Netzah takes you to a hallow-underground-desert, Tiferet teleports you to the spawn, Yesod teleports you to an underground mushroom biome, and Malchut teleports you to the underworld.  The glass is multicolored stained glass, painted with deep purple. Multicolored stained glass has a neat visual effect where it changes hues in the day, resulting in rainbow lighting which obviously can't be captured in a screenshot.   In theory, the entire place is accessible to a character fresh out of the gate- well, as soon as you clamber onto the lower wings. The internals are built so that you can technically get to all the NPCs just with baseline jumping, but the teleporter hub probably isn't usable for new characters.  All the lights are painted white! Not for brightness or anything. I just like how it looks.   All the crystal blocks have Amethyst Gemspark Walls behind them. They glow at night. Crystals ought to glow at night, right?  (I got lazy with the upper wings! I've got to go in and hammer out all the kinks like I did with the bottom ones.)"
Terraria,3e2q0y,Sir_Cuitry,7,Tue Jul 21 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"Can you give some background on the choice of names? I looked up Sephirot, and it's from Kabbalah? Are the other names and design features also references?"
Terraria,3e2q0y,v-23,11,Tue Jul 21 15:24:12 2015 UTC,"I decided to build a Sephirot in the upper half of this mostly because I thought it'd be cool. Originally, the design was just the lower half; I added the tower and upper half as an expansion and figured that putting in a design based on a theological/esoteric concept about connecting earth to heaven would be cool. (I also thought that making a complicated design like that- all straight lines- would be challenging and fun to do in Terraria.)  I'm not a jewish person myself, so hopefully I'm not misrepresenting any of this, but the impression I've gotten of the Sephirot is that the topmost 'node', Keter, represents divinity and godliness while the bottom 'node', Malchut, represents the material world. The other nodes represent how divinity is represented in the world, through behaviors like charity, kindness, awe, and love (which are associated with various intermediate nodes).   As for the other design features, I have to admit that there's no meaning in any of them. I just put stuff in that I thought looked consistent and cool! The name of the build is a bad pun on the Sephirot, though. Zephyr = Sefer = Sefer Yetzirah, which is the book from which this whole concept is sourced, I believe."

Terraria,3e2q0y,KaiserYoshi,7,Tue Jul 21 17:12:27 2015 UTC,"http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Crystal_Block  LONG RAMBLING INCOMING.  Honestly, my building technique is algorithmic, in a sense. When I set out to build something super fancy like this, I generally come up with three mental archetypes for materials (which I'm making up names for right now since they've always been nameless in my mind): Core, Trim, and Filler.  The Core is the gimmick the place is built around. Here, that'd be the spherical crystals, which glow.  The Trim is what supports the Core- which in this case is the gold stuff. Golden filigree on the walls, golden framing supporting purple crystal windows, gold circlets around spherical crystals.  Finally, the Filler is what the majority of the structure is made of. Here, that's the clouds and marble, with a bit of Krampus Horn Wallpaper and Pearlstone for decorations.  Put them together, and you get a sort of mental model of the 'architectural style' of the place. For the Zephyr Tower, its summary might go something like...  ""An angelic tower, suspended by a mantle of white cloud wings. The structure focuses on the vertical, but avoids simple rectangles in favor of arches (noticeable in the sides of the tower and the two decorative marble thingies on the outside of the bottom half), and uses blocky thick marble walls and platforms. Inside, spherical crystal blocks act as attention-grabbers for the eye, with complicated multicolored stained-glass windows painted purple framed by gold brick wall as windows that let natural light in. The windows should be shaped in organic ways, reminiscent of butterfly wings where space allows.""  Like, yeah, that sounds like a mouthful- but if you internalize it, it's not that much! Pretty much every single component of the tower follows this rule, from a macro level to the micro level.  The trick is to use each material consistently. Once you've established a place in the hierarchy where you're using that material, stick to it! In the Zephyr Pillar, the crystal blocks were only ever used in the core role- no crystal roofs or walls; that job was left to the marble stuff.  Other things to keep in mind are the 'directionality' of of your build on all levels- structural and textural. Marble is textureless, mostly, so it works wherever. Pearlstone is a very 'horizontally' textured material, so I mostly used it as a horizontal material. On the micro-level, material textures tell your eyes what's important, while on the macro-level, structural silhouettes tell your eyes where to go. The reason why the 'feathered wing' aesthetic is so poignant is because all the feathers point towards one place. When a bird's wings are fully deployed, it acts almost as a radiant halo, with all the feathers pointed at the central object of importance, creating a strong sense of directionality which is used in the Zephyr Tower to tell you 'hey, dude, see this cool looking sephirot thing, you should focus on that'.  And color schemes are important to keep in mind too- a concept which extends towards visual art in general. Purple and gold go together well, and subconsciously imply the tropes of 'glory', 'importance', and 'regality' to the viewer, which fits the theme of the design. The white marble stuff implies 'purity' and helps contrast with the core-trim stuff that I want to be visually important. Imagine if I built this thing in, I dunno, mythril brick and orange gemspark brick! It might still look good, but its design elements wouldn't be as cohesive at all! What would mint green and orange even imply, thematically? I can't think of anything, myself.  okay wow i think i just dumped out my entire hat of building tricks. hopefully it was helpful and not boring!"

My next post will probably be the final version of the town, and that's when I'll include more details about the town.

Terraria,3e2fyb,Ixula,2,Tue Jul 21 14:12:55 2015 UTC,"As much as I want to see the lunatic cultist finally give loot, it feels more like a Moon Lord drop. The Demon Heart lets you use another accessory and drops from the WoF, who is the gateway boss to Hardmode. It kinda feels like this Lunar Heart, which also lets you use another accessory, should drop from the Moon Lord, the endgame boss. Although, it would be more practical to give it to you before the Moon Lord. To let you prep for him."
Terraria,3e2fyb,JesusIsDaft,3,Tue Jul 21 14:18:59 2015 UTC,"Considering that you can only make the end game armor sets after beating the Moonlord, I find that the Lunar heart can work as a drop from the Moonlord."
Terraria,3e2fyb,DawnOfXChaos,0,Tue Jul 21 15:57:36 2015 UTC,"Plantera maybe, since she is another gateway boss, and you should definitely have wings by then, but still have enough content for the extra slot to be meaningful."
Terraria,3e2fyb,Sabetheli,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Whether it comes from a boss or now, I would love a separate slot for wings, to balance it out. They're too important to not have, but sometimes, the accessory slot is needed for something else."

Terraria,3e2fyb,Lovurr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:10 2015 UTC,I would love this. I'd also like a boots slot because it's extremely annoying having two of my slots taken up by accessories that pretty much help me move around better.
Terraria,3e2fyb,TheBeifongGuy,-4,Tue Jul 21 16:16:42 2015 UTC,"We should just have a wings slot. Not that I have a problem with it being earned like this, but it should exist for all players.   Under no circumstances will I support this idea if it's intended to be another ""Expert Only"" slot. There's no good reason the WoF slot needs to be Expert only in the first place, and this has an even more narrow focus."
Terraria,3e2fyb,seriouslees,4,Tue Jul 21 15:13:43 2015 UTC,"There's no good reason the WoF slot needs to be Expert only in the first place   normal has no use for it.  expert everything is tougher. normal would get op.

Terraria,3e2fyb,pseudonarne,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:23 2015 UTC,"It's not about the need for it, it's about having earned the reward and being able to use the things you've earned.  By the same logic, the Moon Lord shouldn't have any drops at all. Since he is the toughest content in the game, and you just beat him, you don't need any of the loot he drops. But guess what, he still drops it, you still earned it, and you get full use of it to use wherever you want, whether it's ""needed"" or not."

Terraria,3e2fyb,seriouslees,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:11:10 2015 UTC,"we have enough slots.     to fix wings being obsolete I just think mounts should never have allowed us to use any tool/weapon from their back in the first place(except maybe with a later game saddle accessory, so its balanced vs wings)  and would like to see them return to that.  instead limit us to the mount's 1.3 granted abilities(if it even has a combat one.  slime's goomba stomp, unicorn's charge, scutlix's lasers ect. like the drill mount.)   limited weaponry as the price for such mobility without an accessory slot. you want that mobility with weapons and tools? use wings."

Terraria,3e1o2i,illithidbane,19,Tue Jul 21 13:26:25 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the humorously misinterpreted ""wings slot next to your mount slot"" thread, which was not a post about a dedicated accessory slot for your wings, but many people thought it was, and that's such a great idea.  From that thread also came the idea for a dedicated boots slot as well, which I also really goddamn want."
Terraria,3e1o2i,DoomZero755,4,Tue Jul 21 15:27:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about that one. The pet / light pet slots are just convenience, but don't really add more power. The minecart is really minor. The mount could be used on your toolbar anyway. Ditto the hook. None of these actually give you anything new, just save you some toolbar space and hassle. Adding actual passive benefit accessory slots seems OP.   I'd really like having another level of combination of boots, since they are thematically appropriate (all movement enhancing, all boots) and there's a precedent (Lightning>Frostspark), but I don't see a need for a dozen more accessory slots for Boots, Wings, Rings, Shields, Balloons, Diving, Gloves, Fishing, etc."
Terraria,3e1o2i,illithidbane,6,Tue Jul 21 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"From my perspective, it seems that wings and boots are something that basically every player uses, unless you make the switch to a UFO (and I won't). Hell, even the developer sets come with wings. And the ones that give us dyes come with 4 dyes. The fact that they are both necessary and taking up an accessory slot, in my opinion, essentially removes one slot's worth of customization for your character. There are so many wacky accessories that I'd like to try out, but because I always use wings, boots, and the ankh shield, I only get two accessory slots which actually change my playstyle.  I don't really think that rings, shields, balloons, diving stuff, gloves, fishing stuff, etc, are at all standard enough to warrant an accessory slot. If your concern is that people are going to ask for those accessory slots, I really think you've misplaced your concern.    Adding actual passive benefit accessory slots seems OP.   I'd much rather be OP than be bored with my choices.   Besides, it seems that there's already the potential for players to be OP in that way anyway. If the UFO provides all the speed and aerial ability that a player needs, then they will remove both their boots and their wings and fill their with other accessories instead and feel no loss. So players already have the ability to retain the movement capabilities of wings and boots while packing their accessory slots with combat accessories.   All I'm really asking for is the ability to mix up my playstyle a little bit. I want to make the game more interesting, instead of the same ""wings, boots, shield and two other items"" game that I play. It gets too samey when you only get two slots to mix things up with.  (And with the Celestial Shell, that might even fall to just one slot. But that one's not so necessary in my eyes.)"
Terraria,3e1o2i,DoomZero755,4,Tue Jul 21 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Or, you know. Something that people had never considered.  Just add a wing slot, and remove the ability to reforge them (Or get bonuses from the modifiers) if they are in that slot. Bam, no unintended bonus and its basically another option to a mount.  Because fuck mounts."
Terraria,3e1o2i,Kiita-Ninetails,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:26 2015 UTC,"... My thought process after reading that was ""wait a second though that seems ba-... no, no that's a really smart idea! That would make them just like hooks!""  If they do this, though, they would need to add vanity slots for hooks and other stuff.   But yes, I completely support that idea. Make a wing slot and convert wings into something slightly less than an accessory.  (though I'm not sure how I feel about mounts. I guess I generally don't use them much, but I wouldn't say I'm against them. Though I do think I'd prefer wings over mounts.)"
Terraria,3e1o2i,DoomZero755,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"Oh I just dislike mounts from a vanity perspective, most of them are ugly. We need a big cat mount or something. Or a dragon."

Terraria,3e1o2i,Wrulfy,13,Tue Jul 21 07:21:19 2015 UTC,"I think the only cheese available at this point is purely tanking the moon lord with all defense available, all regen possible and a dozen of heart statues. But at that point it would be easier to just do a classic duke fishron solo: asphalt bridge and chlorophyte bullets. Like the guy who did a flawless run agains moon lord, but with space for flaws"
Terraria,3e1o2i,Gorfoo,5,Tue Jul 21 14:21:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's possible to cheese on repeat runs if you have the last prism. If done right you can set up statues to fire it indefinetely, and can basically instakill it IIRC."

Terraria,3e1o2i,Wrulfy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"as far I know, is that they only spawn a max amount of hearts per spot, and that all of them have their own 10 seconds cooldown, so I guess if they are wired to different systems, they could provide more hearts (if you keep no hearts unpicked)"

Terraria,3e1o2i,Tw1gs,4,Tue Jul 21 18:13:27 2015 UTC,What does it mean to cheese the Moon Lord? Or how ever you you use the words Cheese and Moon Lord in a sentence.
Terraria,3e1o2i,ryecurious,7,Tue Jul 21 14:55:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure about the etymology of ""cheese"" in this context, but essentially it means to kill the Moon Lord in a very cheap/glitchy/possbly broken way. For instance, the method of ""cheesing"" the Moon Lord that was just patched out was to stand on spikes, giving yourself immunity from Moon Lords attacks. Clearly the immunity mechanic wasn't intended to replace serious final boss attack damage with a constant 1 damage every second or so, so it qualifies as ""cheesing"" because its exploiting a mechanic in a way that was never intended by the developer, breaking other mechanics in the process."
Terraria,3e1o2i,Tw1gs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:43 2015 UTC,Oh wow. Thanks :)
Terraria,3e1o2i,andrej88,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:49 2015 UTC,"It basically means using a tactic where you exploit a game mechanic to limit/prevent taking damage from the Moon Lord's attacks, while still being able to attack him in peace. For example, one ""cheese tactic"" involved grappling onto a spike. The spike constantly damages you, and since you are invulnerable to attacks for a brief moment after taking damage, you essentially only take damage from the (weak) spike and are immune to damage from the (much stronger) moon lord."
Terraria,3e1o2i,Tw1gs,3,Tue Jul 21 15:22:58 2015 UTC,Thanks :)
Terraria,3e1o2i,Rynxx,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:02 2015 UTC,"Origin is from StarCraft: http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Cheese   During a broadcast game on September 16, 2009, OGN commentator Um Jae Kyung (엄재경) briefly discussed the difference between a bunker rush and a ""cheese"" rush. According to his explanation, the term ""cheese"" originated from the word ""cheater's"" (words in Korean are sometimes shortened by the middle syllables, so 치터즈 [chi tuh zu] would become 치즈 [chi zu]).   The strategy is characterized by, as opposed to a simple bunker rush, a practically unbeatable combination of most of the Terran's SCVs and a very quickly assembled group of marines. Because both Protoss and Zerg basic units are unranged, SCVs can effectively prevent the ranged marines from being destroyed by obstructing the path between the units, giving the marines a tremendous (and thus unfair) edge. The usage of the term ""cheese"" has expanded to include most ""all-in"" strategies which involve a great sacrifice of economy, though some StarCraft communities use the term even more loosely to include mid-game strategies.   Others have adequately described what cheese means in the context of non-RTS games. An unfair exploit that relies on a single unconventional gimmick and (for PvP) incredibly easy to counter if the strategy is known beforehand."

Build auto-speed adjustment: walk only as fast as you build Timers sized 2-3 so a delay can be built-in Summoner weapons with large knockback and/or passive effects. Maybe a minion weapon that functions similarly to the Flying Knife Crowd-sourced enemy AI for expert mode Minions to build or dig for you. Option to auto repeat Non-auto attack weapons but with not-perfect(small randomizations) timing. Wireless transmitters/receivers. Cycling Teleporters Upgrading armor and weapons. Boss drops items to increase the damage for specific item types to the appropriate level for that point in the game. Town Portal. Teleport back to your spawn but be able to return right where you were 1 time. Better bucket management. Chest transfer/swap Expert/veteran pickaxe items that allow you to replay the game and be limited to mining the appropriate ores at each point in the game but the pickaxe will be fast like an endgame pickaxe.

Terraria,3e0l5d,CorbecJayne,4,Tue Jul 21 07:18:34 2015 UTC,Let's compare.  How much damage does a boulder (beign squashed)?
Terraria,3e0l5d,PokemonGod777,5,Tue Jul 21 13:38:25 2015 UTC,"Boulders do 60-150 damage per hit, average 105, 190/105=1.8 The Terrarian does about 1.8 times as much damage as a boulder with the diameter of an average human. Assuming a larger boulder diameter increases the damage that boulder would do by the same amount in real life, a hit to the face of the Terrarian real-life Yo-Yo does as much damage as getting hit by a spherical rock boulder with a diameter of 3.1m.  That's also about as much as a sniper rifle shot to the head (185 dmg)  Edit: Also, the average stone density is 2550 kg/m3, so the weight of a stone sphere like that would be about 40 tonnes ((4/3) * π * (1.55m)3 * 2550kg/m3 = ca. 40t). Such a boulder would drop on your head with a force of about 390kN (40000kg * 9.81m/s2). That's about 2kN * 190dmg, so we can assume that 1dmg = 2000N.  Those same 390kN are also the force of a hit to the face with the Terrarian. Not sure where it gets that sort of force? Don't get all mathematical on me, it's obviously magic!"

Terraria,3e0axj,RhysticStudy,5,Tue Jul 21 09:31:13 2015 UTC,"Hey! I love everything you made, well done! Just wanted to offer one suggestion for convenience (if you still even need it). I do a similar setup in my mushroom farm, but I use dart traps to shoot down each row and break them. So run in, flip a switch, and collect everything! Alternately, more expensive but faster, use actuators on all of the supporting mushroom blocks, and toggle them off. All the mushrooms will fall to the bottom!  That last technique also works well for a crystal farm! XD"

Terraria,3dzouq,halloni,10,Tue Jul 21 11:35:13 2015 UTC,I made a post with this idea a couple weeks ago.  But to offset the people who'd argue about negating the teleporter and making it overpowered I combined it with the idea that giving a npc [*love potion] would convert them to your team. Then the wormhole would still work the same. When a npc died they'd revert and you'd need to give the love potion again.

I built his house in the jungle, and due to  unforeseen circumstances, he's right near where one of the pillars spawns and so dies numerous whenever I fight the pillars.

You get teleporters after defeating your first hardmode boss, so why on earth would you disallow teleporting to NPC's before then? This game already does progression-based invalidation heavily, and Teleporters are complete upgrades to such potions, remind me again why this is an issue? :\"
Terraria,3dzouq,Kosba2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:15 2015 UTC,For long range teleportation you need to lay wires across the whole distance (which isn't cheap and takes time) or you can just build a room there and order an npc to life in it. Though the npc could die and it isn't infinite use.
Terraria,3dzouq,Telinary,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:00 2015 UTC,"Placing wires is ungodly easy now, especially with the +20 to range meaning you can place half-way to the end of the screen for most people. Combine that with the Smart-Placement Functionality and placing is no longer an issue, it's limitation is how fast you can move around. As for the money side... Well... I dunno how it is on normal mode, probably slightly tougher since gold coins and such are less common.... but on Expert Mode, it's a rollercoaster of having 1-10 platinum, all the time. The only reason it's not surpassing those numbers is because I always find something new to reforge mercilessly... I picked up 4 stacks of wires entirely on whim earlier, just so I could have them if my npc's died or something. Eugh, all that to basically say, wiring is much more simple/affordable than you give it credit. But it definitely requires at least a plat or two for insurance."

If you are with your friend where you died, and you wormhole back to him, doesn't dying in multiplayer make in inconsequential? There are so many things in this game, like the magic mirror, that would seem overpowered in so many other games, but in this game it's not. Also, it doesn't follow the ""teleport to other person"" concept, you are right. But you could travel to the X marking your last death, npc's, players..

Terraria,3dzouq,spyrohh,4,Tue Jul 21 13:26:48 2015 UTC,"Teleporting to your friend in multiplayer, regardless of if they are where you just died, is the main point of the potion in the first place.  Teleporting to your death spot in either, though, removes all consequences of death. No ""awh man I have to go all the way back"", no ""oh nooo my gear"" for mediumcore characters, no lost money at all unless a mob manages to run off with it or there's lava. Just a few seconds of waiting to respawn and then right back to it.  I wouldn't rage about it if it got added, but it does seem like a bad idea."

Terraria,3dzouq,Nematrec,20,Tue Jul 21 00:51:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that is tedious and takes effort to wire each teleporter together.  Yes, very useful in the long run, but not enough to make players want to spend their time doing it on a singleplayer world."
Terraria,3dzouq,nerfcrazy5,-3,Mon Jul 20 23:54:55 2015 UTC,"There is no teleporter limit, but there is a wire limit."
Terraria,3dzouq,GolldenFalcon,8,Tue Jul 21 02:27:06 2015 UTC,Theres only a wire limit on console and mobile versions.
Terraria,3dzouq,TriWeeklyHero,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected then.  It's still a pain in the ass to put 4k wire down. Not as much so now with all the 1.3 stuff, but it's not fun."
Terraria,3dzouq,GolldenFalcon,2,Tue Jul 21 03:00:20 2015 UTC,It's also expensive as fuck compared to fishing for wormhole potions.
Terraria,3dzouq,dbag127,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:17:06 2015 UTC,Smart cursor helps a lot. As do minecart+tracks and the stopwatch.  You get up to a certain speed that lets you place wire without going so fast as to eventually pass out of range of the wire.
Terraria,3dzouq,Nematrec,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"It's still unenjoyable. And with your logic I'd have to actually make a whole minecart track, AND place the wire."
Terraria,3dzouq,GolldenFalcon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:13 2015 UTC,I made the minecart track for my skybridge which I use to collect fallen stars and strange plants. If you go slow enough that you don't out run the placement of blocks you can just hold down left click while you watch youtube videos. A vast improvement over my 1.2.3 experience with making the teleporters.
Terraria,3dzouq,Nematrec,-36,Tue Jul 21 19:18:59 2015 UTC,The NPCs that you have to rescue will eventually move up to available housing.  For creative housing? shrugs The potion was just not designed for that. It's meant for players. Not exactly the game's fault that people want their NPCs to be miles apart in separate parts of the universe.
Terraria,3dzouq,flamedance58,17,Mon Jul 20 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"The potion was just not designed for that.   No, it wasn't. That is pretty obvious.   It's meant for players.   If it is meant only for multiplayer, then it flat out shouldn't spawn except on servers. And yet, it spawns in single player. I'm never going to use them. They are useless to me.   Are you suggesting that this item which is useless in single player and yet spawns anyway should not only continue to appear in single player worlds, but should also continue to have zero purpose within them?"
Terraria,3dzouq,BCProgramming,10,Tue Jul 21 00:22:53 2015 UTC,"http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Wormhole_Potion  According to the wiki, they only spawn in multiplayer. I do have some of them in my singleplayer world, but I'm fairly certain I got them while playing with friends and hosting my single player world online. Might that be what happened on your end? That, or the wiki's inaccurate - that definitely happens.  Either way, I agree they should have a singleplayer purpose."
Terraria,3dzouq,DarkoHexar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:37 2015 UTC,Maybe it's a bug then because I get them on my singleplayer world all the time. Never used it for multiplayer. Ever.

I believe it has something to do with how Terraria calculates piercing damage, as there's something like 10 invincibility frames for the enemy upon being hit by one of these sources. So you could have a boss fight where you're aiming your Last Prism at an enemy and you're only seeing numbers in the 100-200s pop up because your Dragon is the only thing dealing damage."

Terraria,3dz5qz,Jakkor,75,Mon Jul 20 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"It seems like they made it more effective the more you summon   The Stardust Dragon change is complicated and involved a few things, so bear with me.     Prefixes weren't working with the Stardust Dragon correctly. So your ""Ruthless"" Stardust Dragon staff wasn't dealing Ruthless damage, just normal. This is one of the things that was fixed.   It was seen that the Stardust Dragon Staff was performing VERY well at ""1 minion count"" use, possibly too well. As a result, its base damage was decreased.   However, the scaling wherein ""each additional minion"" increases the power of the weapon has been increased. This means that a higher minion count investment is more rewarding than it was before (each minion increase should show a proportionally higher increase in damage than before this version)     The above was made with the consideration of the new prefix damage issue included; by my rough estimates, if you are using a good prefix on your staff, you should expect a SLIGHT decrease in performance on a 1-minion count Dragon compared to the previous versions (in other words, a Dragon being used by a non-Summoner) but by 2 or 3 minion count, the overall damage should come out about the same. Above 3 minion count, you should be seeing an improvement in Stardust Dragon damage compared to previous versions."
Terraria,3dz5qz,Strange_Plz,7,Tue Jul 21 01:40:19 2015 UTC,That's odd. I'm not sure I would consider that in line with the other summons as the notes said. They seem so much weaker with many summons. (In comparison to the dragon with many summons)  Thank you for the clarification though! That's actually great news.
Terraria,3dz5qz,Infinite-Choices,6,Tue Jul 21 01:51:16 2015 UTC,Perhaps they made it align with the fact that minions are usually nothing more than complementary damage with only one of the out.  But we still have the Optic Staff so...
Terraria,3dz5qz,IlikeJG,42,Tue Jul 21 01:59:48 2015 UTC,unless they buff the armor sets i don't see me ever playing a summoner again.

Terraria,3dz5qz,gamingdude295,23,Mon Jul 20 22:22:08 2015 UTC,The dragon is actually stronger now for a summoner. It's only nerfed for the low summon count of non-summoners.

Terraria,3dz5qz,Leoneri,50,Mon Jul 20 18:50:26 2015 UTC,"Already done the fight properly a few times. It's a sandbox game, it really ought to be up to the player (imo). The fight is so long and tedious, like the solar pillars, that I probably won't be doing it again.  I don't even know if I've seen someone solo expert Moon Lord without cheese or a gigantic arena made in TEdit."
Terraria,3dz5qz,rinsed_dota,17,Mon Jul 20 19:06:16 2015 UTC,"I've killed moon lord in solo expert without an arena or cheesing it. It's possible, and honestly not even that hard. Though I can't disagree with you about the fight being long and tedious (at least after farming him countless times to get all of the items)."
Terraria,3dz5qz,Kosba2,49,Mon Jul 20 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if the eyes didn't close so often and for so long (extending a fight through invulnerability is kinda meh), I'd feel much better about the fight."

Terraria,3dz5qz,mouseasw,5,Mon Jul 20 21:34:11 2015 UTC,Imagine how slow the fight would be if he had IFrames like the player did.
Terraria,3dz5qz,Leoneri,17,Tue Jul 21 01:18:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My biggest problem is his eye on his head, it only opens when it shoots the giant death laser, and since I focus more on just surviving than dishing out insane amounts of damage I tend to dodge the laser more so than focus fire the eye."
Terraria,3dz5qz,ArchMichael7,7,Mon Jul 20 19:24:17 2015 UTC,"I hate that part as well. Every time I've fought him, his hands were dead while the head still have half health or more. The core goes down fastest simply because I only have to deal with one target, and no invulnerability.  Anyway, I recommend you use a homing weapon like Razorblade Typhoon (which I also highly recommend for the pillars' minions), then you don't need to aim while dodging."
Terraria,3dz5qz,Lolmuhhhhhhh,2,Mon Jul 20 22:31:45 2015 UTC,What was your setup for fighting him?
Terraria,3dz5qz,setzuyo,4,Mon Jul 20 19:37:27 2015 UTC,"With the SDMG, wings, and a platform not even 300 spaces long, I've soloed him a bunch of times pretty easily.  The FIRST time I killed him....it was a nightmare but ultimately wings and an asphalt skybridge with a second layer above got the job done after about 6 tries.  I used the Vortex Beater, Vortex Armor (I think that's the right one, the ranged one) and got lucky on a few dodges."
Terraria,3dz5qz,vengfulr3ap3r,7,Mon Jul 20 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"My brother and I killed him normally once, and are now cheesing him for the items. I want my meowmere :("

It's not like the only way to beat he Moon Lord is to cheese him, I'm pretty sure I could beat him if  prepared myself, but I don't.   I want to cheese the Moon Lord, I'm not playing Terraria for the epic boss fights, and I'm pretty sure a lot of people share that opinion with me."
Terraria,3dz5qz,theklocko,11,Mon Jul 20 19:01:08 2015 UTC,"My choices were ""cheese it"" and ride back and forth in my mine cart while firing at the boss with the vortex beater and chlorophyte bullets. You think they'd be happy I chose the option that allows me to enjoy the artwork behind him instead of the one that keeps him off screen at all times.  Besides that. Im with you. I'd rather cheese it. If we are to the point we can fight the moon lord, chances are we're at the very end of end game. What's the point in making us work harder to achieve the last few items worth getting? I get they want to make it epic, but that late in the game.. what's the point?"
Terraria,3dz5qz,Robotic_Muffin,3,Mon Jul 20 19:11:01 2015 UTC,The only problem is that we have to fight him a few dozen times to get all the drops. If I have to farm an epic boss to get loot then don't make it more of a chore than it already is.
Terraria,3dz5qz,-quoth,3,Tue Jul 21 03:23:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get you. It does become kind of a chore. The fight is awesome and epic the first two or three times, but after that it's kind of boring."

This set up couldn't do him in one trek across the world though, so use a hammer to change the ends of the railway into bouncers to send you into the other direction instantly as you reach the end  It's a really just a fight of keeping yourself alive as your subpar damage slowly wittles him down. The worst that can happen is him keeping his head hitbox closed constantly  Other wise, good luck with the attempts!"
Terraria,3dz5qz,Vertixio,3,Mon Jul 20 20:04:54 2015 UTC,Why did you use an avenger emblem over a ranger emblem?

Terraria,3dz5qz,UnicornStarORG,8,Tue Jul 21 00:09:34 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'd say it's borderline cheesy, not like teleporting around and healing with the nurse, rinse, repeat, but still not as legit as kicking his ass in an arena."
Terraria,3dz5qz,Dee_Jay_Eye,4,Mon Jul 20 22:26:06 2015 UTC,One could argue the very fact of using an arena is cheesing.  Cheese is subjective.

Terraria,3dz5qz,sir_finnigan_iii,5,Mon Jul 20 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"Cheese refers to a cheap shot or some sort or a cheap tactic. Hiding behind walls and using something that makes it so you can get to them while they CAN'T get to you would be considered cheap or cheese-y.  In this case they're talking about abusing the iframes after you get hit to ignore most of his attacks either by using flame blocks, weak enemies, or spikes.  Edit: Fixed a word."

Terraria,3dz5qz,runetrantor,12,Mon Jul 20 20:46:35 2015 UTC,They should buff the armor bonuses so that people that want to be a summoner can. I'm sure the nerf is for people that are using it to increase dps with other armor sets.
Terraria,3dz5qz,seriouslees,8,Mon Jul 20 23:26:17 2015 UTC,"Aw, that kind of sucks. It still has such a great perk of being able to travel through walls that I still almost don't want to give it up for the stardust cell."

In reality, the 'worst' thing about cheesing is that we get the achievement still.

People have been using spikes to take low damage so that moon lord can't hit them, because the spikes put them on damage cooldown. They made spikes s separate cooldown, so people used lava. Now it seems the moon lord has his own cooldown so he avoids being unable to hit you based on other sources of damage."
Terraria,3dz5qz,Telinary,7,Mon Jul 20 19:20:44 2015 UTC,Apparently someone (multiple people) tested it and lava still works.
Terraria,3dz5qz,Microdragon153,9,Mon Jul 20 22:06:42 2015 UTC,"There was a method to ""cheese"" (cheap + easy I think) the final boss using other sources of damage (spikes/lava) to avoid the bosses damage.  The Dev's didn't like this approach so now the bosses damage has it's own immunity (you can take boss damage and lava damage at the same time) so people can't cheese it that way anymore.  Hence:   They put the cheese in a fire (they took away the cheese), cuz that this is useless now (now we have to find a new way to cheese him)"
Terraria,3dz5qz,_______butts_______,3,Mon Jul 20 19:20:05 2015 UTC,When you get hit you can't be damaged again for a short time. So an old way you can cheese basically any boss (except the moon lord now) is to ensure that you constantly take low amounts of damage so that all damage of the boss happens during the invulnerability frames.

It would be nice if having the Tabi equipped would enhance the Solar Flare armor's dash a bit, maybe making it faster, or making the dash a bit longer. Or making you dash so fast your character transforms into a speed line and reappears on the other side of the enemy all anime-style.  That'd be great."
Terraria,3dz5qz,Detrian,3,Tue Jul 21 03:06:30 2015 UTC,The final boss' attacks now use their own cooldown for immunity due to how naughty some of our players have been.   DAMMIT. Now I ACTUALLY have to learn how to fight this asshat...
Terraria,3dz5qz,bobsizzlack,2,Tue Jul 21 04:42:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know how I feel about the boss cool-down immunity. On one hand, it is the final boss as of 1.3, and it should be hard. But on the other hand, I think you should be able to glitch/exploit in your own single player game. Especially since farming luminite is so tedious, but that's probably the point."

Terraria,3dz5qz,draanexle,4,Mon Jul 20 20:24:36 2015 UTC,Why nerf the dragon? Summoner is such a weak class already....
Terraria,3dz5qz,Derised,13,Mon Jul 20 22:57:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, they only nerfed the level 1 form. With more than 4 summoned, it's actually more powerful now."
Terraria,3dz5qz,DaffydNC,3,Tue Jul 21 02:58:05 2015 UTC,I wonder what made them decide to nerf the dragon. Was it too good?
Terraria,3dz5qz,draanexle,5,Mon Jul 20 22:16:43 2015 UTC,"It was just bugged apparently. From what I've read, it wasn't working with modifier damage bonuses(which they fixed) and wasn't scaling properly. Now it scales properly/better, and prefixes work, so with more than 4 summons it actually does more damage than before."
Terraria,3dz5qz,MushroomDynamo,7,Tue Jul 21 02:59:20 2015 UTC,They just don't like summoners apparently... You cannot control your pets and now they do less damage?   Give us a staff that (while in your hand) increases the pet damage by 50%.
Terraria,3dz5qz,Derised,4,Mon Jul 20 22:21:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know what I want now.  A staff that lets you command your pet to collect loot from where your mouse is, sort of how you can use those magic missile staffs.  Could have some better version which can go through walls/blocks etc later on."

Terraria,3e0wyv,Koalasonfire,7,Tue Jul 21 02:46:29 2015 UTC,The corruption has almost encased the hallowed. So there is a little bit of room for it expand but not much. He had no idea what the hallow is after playing for 20 hours in hardmode since it's not on the surface.
Terraria,3e0wyv,Koalasonfire,3,Tue Jul 21 02:51:43 2015 UTC,Oh I see.  You should let him know how to quarantine and make a surface biome.
Terraria,3e0wyv,LolAlterations,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:27 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what is the V?"
Terraria,3e0wyv,Koalasonfire,4,Tue Jul 21 06:32:32 2015 UTC,"When you kill the wall, a v pattern generates in your world, starting from the center, to the surface. 1/2 corruption, 1/2 hallow."
Terraria,3e0wyv,c0mandr,6,Tue Jul 21 06:36:54 2015 UTC,Looks like he smashed every altar he could find....
Terraria,3e0wyv,Yoshikeeper,10,Tue Jul 21 03:49:08 2015 UTC,"Just checked on tedit, 25 altars smashed.... yepp looks like it."
Terraria,3e0wyv,Naruto49,4,Tue Jul 21 04:54:29 2015 UTC,Wait is there something wrong with smashing all the alters?
Terraria,3e0wyv,Momorules99,12,Tue Jul 21 07:09:48 2015 UTC,Each altar smashed releases another pocket of corruption into the world.
Terraria,3e0wyv,VeriFunni,3,Tue Jul 21 07:14:58 2015 UTC,"Well it can also spawn Hallow instead. And it isn't a pocket, it is a single block changed."
Terraria,3e0wyv,infernon_,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:20 2015 UTC,Which will soon expand into a pocket. Doesn't really make much of a difference.
Terraria,3e0wyv,Omfg12333,10,Tue Jul 21 15:44:32 2015 UTC,Breaking an altar has a chance to corrupt one random block in the world.
Terraria,3e0wyv,Yoshikeeper,5,Tue Jul 21 07:15:39 2015 UTC,"Each altar smashed puts another block of crimson/corrupted in the world, so it spreads MUCH faster than if you smashed just 3. Also each altar smashed gives less ore than the ones before, so it's not really worth smashing a bunch for more ore to spawn."
Terraria,3e0wyv,iDeconstructor,12,Tue Jul 21 07:15:59 2015 UTC,Oh god!
Terraria,3e0wyv,CptBlackBird,3,Tue Jul 21 07:17:53 2015 UTC,"In the future, smash around 6."

Terraria,3e0wyv,PM_ME_CAKE,5,Tue Jul 21 09:22:41 2015 UTC,"Fishing crates are ridiculous. I spent about as much time fishing them up as I normally would altarsmashing and mining; I skipped straight to full Titanium armor with Adamantite tools, with a huge chunk of Adamantite left over.

Terraria,3e0wyv,jahannan,4,Tue Jul 21 09:32:38 2015 UTC,this is why jungle should be able to fuse  with the light/dark biomes  like everything else   not be immune to hallow and destroyed by corruption with a cancer mechanic to chlorophyte to reclaim any dirt into mud.
Terraria,3e0wyv,_Jogger_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"This is what happened on my expert playthrough. I wound up spreading the hallow to either side of the jungle and I'm just going to let the hallow and crimson battle it out on that side of the map, hopefully resulting in something useful for me.  Meanwhile, the crimson I got from smashing altars wound up landing on a sky island... so not everything is entirely grim."
Terraria,3e0wyv,Kazenovagamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:59:20 2015 UTC,I didnt get a surface hollow in my small world either. :/
Terraria,3e0wyv,Jimeee,3,Tue Jul 21 07:33:25 2015 UTC,"Neither did I, the V went right where the snow biome was so while I got a small few pink ice blocks, I didn't have a hallow surface for hallow mobs so I had to make my own by placing grass above the snow and planting hallow seeds."
Terraria,3e0wyv,The14thNoah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:57:21 2015 UTC,Same for me. I didn't get any surface Hallow. My jungle is too big and too many corruption pits all over my world.

Terraria,3e0wyv,zenthr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"Okay... newbie question. (More like had-the-game-for-a-year-and-never-beat-WOF but you get the idea.)  Does the initial V not affect certain biomes? I know that a line of each pops up when you go into hardmode - and that most people rush out to halt it - but is there a chance it'll do nothing at all? I've always worried about taking the plunge, but I'm starting to wonder if it's okay to leave it. I'll just leave the altars for a side world. I know about crates, and I know that the spread slows after beating Plantera.  In short, is halting the corruption/crimson/hallow as hard as it sounds?"
Terraria,3e0wyv,Emenemson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"I know for instance that the Hallow cannot convert mud blocks at all, hence very little Hallow here. The Corruption/Crimson can, but slowly. Worse, it does this by converting the mud to dirt, pretty much eternally diminishing your jungles and mushroom biomes.  I'm not sure about snow/ice.  I don't know what happens if the Corruption/Crimson side goes through the jungle. I don't know that I want to know..."

Healing is not an inherently good or evil property.   holy water hallowfies land, it's HOLY   Holy of what? Holy only means it is associated with a deity not necessarily a good one, you could probably call the moonlord a deity if you wanted (is very powerful and has worshipers).   mobs are affiliated with the forces of LIGHT, the game introduces them as the forces of LIGHT and DARKNESS   Again what makes an infestation of light any better than a infestation of darkness? Neither are inherently good things.   a bunch of noobs were just gored by a unicorn at some point, and cried ""wahhh look at my guts spewed all over the ground, this unicorn was trying to kill me, it must be evil!""\   Dangerous and violent are either evil or at the very least neutral.   and who were you to interfere with their crusade? could you control the dark forces you unleashed by killing the wall?    yes   they watched as these fools killed the guardian, then dug trenches everywhere in a panic, as if this was somehow going to stem the tide.   but it very much did stem the tide. then with the power of the contaminator i purged every last spec of the corruption from my world. Then I removed the evils of the Hallow as well.  Just because something fights against evil does not mean it is opposite evil (and example for those familiar with most DnD settings, devils and Demons fight against each other constantly because Devils embody Lawful Evil and Tyranny while Demons Embody Chaotic Evil and Anarchy, to a devil the chaotic evil demons are just as much their enemies as a lawful good paladin).  Also the mechanical bosses are made from hallowed metal.  I'm probably taking this far more seriously than I should but just wanted to put in my 2 coppers."

However, part way through our sand-mining, we see a message pop up on our screen: ""Mercer has been slain"".  We rush to where we last saw him but there's no trace. My friend runs down a nearby pit and declares that he's found the deceased's orphaned hat. We ponder the reason to his untimely demise but eventually lay it down to random happenstance. We get back to building houses.   Some time later another travelling merchant comes by. We make the obvious ""Maybe he's come looking for his friend lol"" banter and have a good chuckle.   ""Aphraim has been slain""   We start to get worried. We go and check again and once more find the token hat. There is a beast and he is hungry.

Here's a few things you can do to make more attractive houses:    Pick a block you want for walls and outline a shape, any shape but a box, it really doesn't matter.  Pick A DIFFERENT block and make some sort of roof, could do slopes, curved, flat, have fun with it. Pick yet again A DIFFERENT wall than the previous 2, you could mix in some of their complementary walls if you wanna do a 2 tone effect, the more variation the better.  Fill it all in. Now that you have the basic building done put some rooms, don't just grid off the inside then you're back to having squares again, don't make all the vertical and horizontal surfaces meet up, you could use stairs and such to have them meet. I'll usually go back and thicken up walls and floors where I find it looks better, maybe switch out for a different floor material, go around and find where it looks good to hammer some blocks and make things look more fluid, all the little details, add windows and pick some furnishing.  When you add furniture don't just make them all bedrooms, or all tables and chairs.  Make a bedroom, put a bathroom joining it, make a kitchen, put a dining room next to it, and so on."

First pic has sunken floors, and the vertical lines don't match up from floor to floor, doors are all at different places, although symmetrical.  Second image, although boxy, is still offset, think like stacking bricks.  The door in the center of the house could of easily lined up with the wall above it, so I moved it over to keep it interesting, same with the walls on the right.  Lastly with my little spaceship, the room in the center is purposefully straight like that for the design.  So I raised the floor up top, and lowered the ceiling down below.  This got rid of what would otherwise look like 2 lines just going across.  Also the doors don't all line up, if you entered the bottom you've got to zigzag your way up to the top.  Hope this helps."

You will still create dissatisfying homes at first but your mind will begin to record shapes it finds attractive.  So that as you continue to build you will instinctively design more interesting concepts.  Making it feel natural and original because you taught yourself what you like.

Terraria,3dye5z,I_give_karma_to_men,31,Tue Jul 21 00:32:06 2015 UTC,Wings are honestly more akin to the grappling hook then a true accessory. In endgame especially you shouldn't have to sacrifice an accessory slot just to be able to dodge bosses.
Terraria,3dye5z,Voldemort_5,10,Mon Jul 20 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you should. If you can just load up on accessories because all your movement accessories get their own slot, then boss battles become significantly easier than they should be. As it is, you can put a stack of archery, gravity, heartreach, iron skin, regen, mana, greater health, and a ton of other potions in your inventory, as well as a toolbar full of weapons, and still have most of your inventory left for the ~5 drops you're bound to get from the boss. In addition, you can have 5 accessories, a grappling hook, two regular pets, a minecart, and a mount. This isn't bad or anything, but why, pray tell, do you need more?"
Terraria,3dye5z,I_give_karma_to_men,19,Mon Jul 20 20:26:14 2015 UTC,"It's not so much a matter of needing more as it is a matter of things making sense. When it comes to accessories, they're generally things like emblems, bundles of balloons, and other things that don't fit in with the equipment slots. Wings on the other hand, are the odd one out. Like armor and grappling hooks, they actually have a very defined (and long) progression. While you might swap around things like emblems, bundle of balloons, and ninja gear, for the most once you get them wings will never leave your accessories slot. For all intents and purposes they are a gear item.  I dunno, maybe I'm just a scrub, but I really don't think making wings a gear item and being able to hold one more accessory would somehow be this groundbreaking thing that would suddenly make expert mode boss fights trivial."
Terraria,3dye5z,DoomZero755,9,Mon Jul 20 21:34:01 2015 UTC,"why, pray tell, do you need more?   I wouldn't say you need more, but rather... as a player, I would personally want more.  Like /u/I_give_karma_to_men said, ""once you get them, wings will never leave your accessories slot."" The first thing I do when I get to hardmode is buy Leaf Wings. And as soon as I do, I've basically lost an inventory slot (unless I was previously using a lucky horseshoe type item). Wings are such a staple that every single developer set has their own (except Aaron's set, which is a shame because I like his. He left the team though.). We even get 4 dyes from the Skiphs and Loki sets. But I don't mean to just repeat that argument.  From my perspective, accessories are useful because they're creative. Accessories do so much that I'd like to use more. Instead, by the time I reach the end-game, in pretty much every version that's had them, my accessories slots have always had wings, a set of boots, and the ankh shield. That leaves only two slots for innovation, because I can't imagine removing any of those three. I'd like to customize my playstyle so much more than that. I'd like to have a bunch of accessories. I can't say for sure if that would make the game easier, but even if it is easier, I would enjoy it more that way. Customization, in my eyes, comes way before difficulty.  The dude above us that got downvoted to hell was suggesting that a dedicated boot slot would be a terrible idea, but I am such a huge fan of that idea. I'd love to have a set of accessory slots dedicated to mobility. A wings slot and a boots slot would be such a wonderful gift. (And if they're feeling super generous, perhaps they could make a new pair of boots which combines the frostspark boots with the lava waders.)"
Terraria,3dye5z,Voldemort_5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:05 2015 UTC,"I guess the problem is mostly prioritizing certain playstyles. Generally speaking, Terraria is mostly about the boss battles and progression. Meanwhile, others like to build, which is perfectly fine - if I was good at it, I would. But trying to find a middle between those two is pretty hard."

Terraria,3dye5z,VoluptuousMeat,6,Mon Jul 20 19:31:59 2015 UTC,"i see it more as vortex booster offers more maneuverability than ufo, but it takes up an accessory slot so its a nice tradeoff that the player can decide. if we cant attack from mounts, it just forces us to use wings again"

Terraria,3dye5z,Surpex,2,Mon Jul 20 23:33:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, but for that I use the paladins shield."
Terraria,3dye5z,DoomZero755,5,Mon Jul 20 23:36:10 2015 UTC,"What makes the ankh shield obsolete?   I've had it for so long that I don't actually know what end-game enemies inflict debuffs. But I'm fairly certain that the ankh shield's many debuff immunities are kind of a big deal? And, to my knowledge, no other item gives so many debuff immunities.  You mentioned in another comment that you get knockback immunity from the paladin's shield, which I can understand, but I still think the ankh charm's contributions are valuable."
Terraria,3dye5z,Surpex,3,Tue Jul 21 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"Well, for my game, I got the ankh shield/charm after I had beetle armor, a Terrablade, full Warding loadout, and all of the biome weapons. At the time, that was the best armor you could get. So by that point I was no longer spelunking, and no longer found myself in the situation where I would need the protection from the debuffs. In addition, I could usually kill anything that caused the debuffs before that could actually hit me with it, or before it actually became important to avoid them. So for me, I had no need for it."
Terraria,3dye5z,Chaoss780,4,Tue Jul 21 00:55:18 2015 UTC,Very interesting. I've always grinded an ankh shield the second I hit hard mode after opening fishing crates.
Terraria,3dye5z,DoomZero755,3,Tue Jul 21 02:16:36 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Hmm. I guess I can see your point. Maybe it doesn't have much use in the end-game, but I'm sure it's still a useful item if you can get it before them."

Terraria,3dye5z,arrrghzi,4,Mon Jul 20 21:40:43 2015 UTC,"Indeed.

Terraria,3dye5z,The_Dark_Conqueror,17,Mon Jul 20 23:02:07 2015 UTC,"i would be more than fine with not using an accessory slot on wings, having them like mounts and hooks."
Terraria,3dye5z,pseudonarne,7,Mon Jul 20 18:49:23 2015 UTC,I'd much rather see mounts go back to not allowing us to use any tool/weapon from their back(except with a saddle accessory)    limit us to the mount's abilities(slime's goombastomp and scutlix's lasers for example).  limited weaponry as the price for mobility without an accessory slot.   that way wings don't end up obsolete and mounts are imo more interesting
Terraria,3dye5z,Sebroz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"Wings are mostly obsolete during boss fights due to mine cart arenas, there's little reason to not make them akin to the grappling hook and having their own dedicated slot."

(or just make saddle work on it too. i like that better) (but at least carts have the balancing effect of prelaying the rails, they don't really replace wings like mounts)"
Terraria,3dye5z,Aldubrius,4,Mon Jul 20 20:15:56 2015 UTC,"...How would that change anything? You would still use it over wings, but with the added annoyance of a different, still mandatory, accessory."

Terraria,3dz637,DrMobius0,9,Mon Jul 20 23:27:18 2015 UTC,"I discussed with someone else in another thread before, if desert gets its own chest, and if throwing damage type ever gets expanded to a full class, it'd be great if desert would either be a throwing damage drop or one of the chests would be changed to become a throwing drop, with the new chest making up for it(Vampire Knives becoming Throwing damage like regular knives and the desert chest getting either a thrower or melee weapon depending on what the evil in the world is).  Right now the biome chests have a nice theme going, with one dungeon containing exactly one biome weapon for each class(melee technically has 2 weapons, but only one can appear in a dungeon). Expanding throwing type would keep that, while also evolving the damage type to be more than a mere earlygame gimmick.  Though, underground deserts should be expanded some more before people are forced to grind it. Lamias and Ghouls need some drops, a Queen Bee-ish miniboss certainly wouldn't hurt, could even upgrade the pyramid to be a big, guaranteed structure, similar to how dungeon and temple work, but for another stage of the game(or perhaps an alternative lategame path apart from Plantera->Golem->Lunar Event?).

Terraria,3e3tg2,kkklan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:09 2015 UTC,There was actually a guy in the front page of this sub who made a fake biome for each quest except ocean biome. The only way to speed it up is using a sundial every seven in-game days (it skips the rest of the day but has a cooldown of a week) to my knowledge.
Terraria,3e3tg2,Iceman8k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:32 2015 UTC,"The fastest method is to create a new world, quickly travel to one of the oceans, find the angler, and do his quest. If you have an enchanted sundial, you can do it a second time in the same world. Since fishing quest counts are recorded to the character, not the world, you can progress without waiting for the next day in your main world.  This is only really feasible once you've got decent mobility accessories and a nice pickaxe to dig to the cavern layer quickly. A bottomless water bucket is a plus."
Terraria,3e3tg2,hiccup251,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"I've heard that you can switch worlds to speed it up some. The fishing history is saved on your character, not world, so you can create a new Small world, run to the side for an ocean, find the Angler, check for quest, use a Piggy Bank / Safe to pull out a spare you had, then turn it in and quit and delete the world. Repeat.  Note that you can get spare fish to speed things up. You cannot catch another quest fish while one is in your inventory, but a Piggy Bank can take care of that. Fish, bank, fish, bank, fish. Turn in one, have two more for when quests repeat. I have a dozen spare quest types in my Safe right now so I can check my Angler without having to re-fish the quests.  Also, you can use the Sundial to speed up things occasionally. If you're still doing actual mining most of the time, you can turn in, sundial, turn in again. Then go back to mines / bosses / farming / building for a while.  Barring that... ~shhhh~ Some people speak of rumored cheats that speed up the flow of time.   But yes. It's slow. It's meant to be a long-term journey."
Terraria,3e3tg2,illithidbane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:37 2015 UTC,"Something that will save time is to catch 6 quest fish at a time instead of catching one and bringing it back to finish the quest. The way to do it is to throw out the quest fish every time you pick one up, and you will eventually catch multiple. Once you've caught 6, put 5 in a container (You can only pick up 1 at a time, possibly 3 at a time by putting one in trash slot and holding one in your cursor, letting another get in to you inventory) and bring one back to the Angler. A recommended container is your piggy bank, so you don't have to haul all the fish back. Put another container close to the Angler so you can pick up a fish right away if he needs one you've caught."

Terraria,3dzttv,dbag127,3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:24 2015 UTC,"This is literally the only thing it skips. I've never understood why people even use anything besides Titanium/Adamantium armor in early hardmode. Smash three altars, have a stack of spelunker pots, get enough of the first two ores to make the anvil and make one of the armor sets just to keep from dying quite so easy, then go back and get enough of the last tier.  I don't understand how people feel fishing breaks this mechanic. The main difference is you get murdered less in exchange for taking more time and patience. And in return you also don't get more corruption/crimson."

Meanwhile I have all 3 sets for Cobalt and Mithril on my mannequins with 50 bars in my chests and still tons everywhere that I don't mine because I don't need it.  And that's with Spelunker Potions.

Terraria,3dywpr,GolldenFalcon,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:08 2015 UTC,I am in a small world. But I'll make a new one cuz hardmode. Is expert mode better for spawns?
Terraria,3dywpr,supersonic159,2,Tue Jul 21 02:48:24 2015 UTC,"dont think so. just make a normal world, use battle potion, hold a water candle and place one, and let your dragon/minions do the job"

Terraria,3e3kbo,IvoryValor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:48 2015 UTC,my recomendations get a magic quiver and a sniper scope to switchout with your boots during bossfights get luminite bullets and arrows and the endless bullets/arrows also celestial shell
Terraria,3e3kbo,aleq5000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"You'll want to replace one or both of your movement accessories for additional combat stats (destroyer emblem and sniper scope) and use a mount to get around instead. Most people use the UFO mount, but the Scutlix is good too. Replace your Ankh Shield with a Celestial Shell once you have the materials to make one, unless you really feel like you need to knockback immunity. It doesn't protect against most endgame debuffs anyway. A Worm Scarf is also a good choice.   Holy arrows are generally a better choice than Ichor, and Crystal bullets are much stronger than Chlorophyte if you don't have much trouble aiming."
Terraria,3e3kbo,hiccup251,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"Really, a mount, huh...? Ugh. Well, the closest I got is the unicorn mount. I went with ichor for defense down, but I guess that probably doesn't matter end game, and I kinda do have issues aiming in the thick of things, but I'll give it a go.  EDIT: Also, Why Celestial Shell? It's the same thing as the Celly Stone, and the werewolf buff at night only helps Melee, really."
Terraria,3e3kbo,hiccup251,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:49 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of preference, of course, but using a mount for mobility instead of accessories undoubtedly increases your dps/survivability. Nothing wrong with not using one if you don't like how it looks or feels.   Ichor ammo is outclassed endgame as an exclusive ammunition, but if you're willing to take up a bunch of inventory space it can still be used to boost your dps considerably (especially when paired with crystal/holy ammo due to the multiple low-damage additional hits). If you sort your ammo into stacks of ~60 for S.M.D.G. and ~25 for Phantasm, then alternate them with a few shots of ichor ammo, you can maintain the ichor debuff without losing the higher dps of the other ammo. It's somewhat tedious, but a useful method nonetheless."

Terraria,3e2a5j,MonthOLDpickle,5,Tue Jul 21 12:23:12 2015 UTC,My problem with the crafting window is not being able to craft from that window. You have to select the item. Than go back over to the vertical one to actually craft. It's rather unintuitive and I can't think of a reason they did it like that. It should just be called a viewing window :|
Terraria,3e2a5j,rizzo891,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"You make the point I'd also like to state. The available crafting options 'view' should be the actual crafting menu. I find it counter-intuitive to move away from the first scroll menu to see a better view of options, just to go back to the previous scrolling menu and craft something.   It doesn't slow me down or seem tedious all in all, but to be able to just pull items from the secondary menu would be awesome.   I'm not even sure the scrolling menu should even be in the game, considering the massive number of options there are."
Terraria,3e2a5j,Kordsmeier,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:54 2015 UTC,Exactly. To me the vertical scrolling one seems like a relic from when Terraria had few crafting options. Now that there is so many its just tedious. Like you said it really doesn't take alot of time. It just doesn't make sense.
Terraria,3e2a5j,rizzo891,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:36 2015 UTC,I hope the can make this change and I'm sure  other players would agree it'd just be simpler.
Terraria,3e2a5j,Kordsmeier,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"OH MY GOD YES! This is my BIGGEST gripe about the game. Not lack of accessory slots, not why X and Y item aren't fused, not odd stack caps (though those are fairly big), not the seemingly overly frequent Blood Moons, not even friggin' Medusas, but the god. damn. Crafting window not just giving my damn item when I click it but rather forcing me to click the item again to craft it. ARGH."

Clicking that will open what looks like an inventory in the middle of the screen. That is everything you can craft with your current items on hand and nearby crafting stations. Clicking an item will cause the ""crafting wheel"" on the left edge to jump to that item immediately, with no scrolling.

You can post a shot from camera mode and people might be able to spot the light for you if you haven't found one before.  If you have star fury you can use it to reveal all/most of the darkness in the jungle through walls.  The more you reveal the easier it is to spot.

Terraria,3e0lnl,SilverDeoxys563,4,Tue Jul 21 02:39:18 2015 UTC,"Anecdote: What happens when you take out the cooldowns and make costs trivial enough to pay over and over?  I played on a modded minecraft server where one guy on the server was a vampire. You see, the perks of being a vampire was becoming nigh unkillable, but with the downside of dying almost instantly in the sun. So whenever he wanted to go out exploring, he'd do a blood magic ritual that summons rain to block out the sun. At this point, he can pay the cost to summon rain at any time, no matter how often.  The constant rain on the server drove pretty much every non-vampire insane. So I spent upwards of an entire day grinding for an item that can banish the rain. The cost to banish the rain was pretty steep, but it could be recharged with a circle magic ritual that's easy to keep running.  What ensued was about 10 minutes of me banishing the rain, him bringing it back, then me banishing it again and him summoning it back again. Eventually, we came to a truce and I agreed to help set up the ritual to cure him of vampirism and the server hasn't seen rain ever since."

He's hard but predictable. Do this till you get a daedalus. The illuminated hook is useful too. Then farm pixies and unicorns till you get a solid stack of holy arrows. You will utterly melt face. As for twins, build an asphalt track about 600 blocks long, and run back and forth pelting him with daedalus. Skeleton prime,  you can basically do the same thing. Aim for a piercing weapon to hit multiple parts at once and make sure you kill them before 430 am. If you are unable, you need to raise your dps. Also roll warding on all accessories, go to an ice biome and farm there till you get Amarok. Easy as hell to get and strong as shit early hard mode."

Terraria,3e2kh1,Booona,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"Can the same thing be said about Expert Hardmode? I had tons of fun on pre-hardmode with Expert, and I was pretty excited about starting Hardmode. After playing a couple hours and getting shredded by a couple bosses, I started to realize that obtaining  better armor is just about useless. Was able to make a full set of Adamantite which boosted my total armor by 30 points, but I didn't notice a bit of difference."
Terraria,3e2kh1,Chrom_Of_Ylisse,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't personally played through Expert Hardmode but I have read up on it.  First, you may already know this but defense affects damage taken more in expert mode. For example, if you have 60 defense in Normal mode, incoming damage is reduced by 30 points. If you have 60 defense in Expert, incoming damage is reduced by 45 points. This is helpful but due to increased damage in Expert mode, doesn't help as much as it could. Better armor will definitely help though, but you will still die pretty easily.  Second, due to increased money drops in Expert, I would recommend using some of it to reforge accessories. Each Warding accessory will provide 4 defense, which will reduce incoming damage by 3. If you have all your accessories set to Warding, incoming damage will be reduced by 18 (counting the Demon Heart slot). This is huge.  Thirdly, to answer the original question. Weapon progression in Expert will be similar to normal mode. The Daedalus Stormbow is certainly still useful against the Destroyer, and the rest of my comment above still applies. The difference is that you will have to play much more defensively. Get good accessories, work on the patterns to avoid the bosses, and build a good arena. Preparation is huge in Expert mode!  If you have any further questions feel free to ask.  Edit: If you are able to kill Ice Golems, I would recommend doing that to get Frost Armor. It provides a buff to melee and ranged damage and applies a frostburn effect to attacks of those types. I think the Destroyer is immune to Frostburn though, and you will have to gather more Adamantite to craft it with."

The Twins flattened me in an arena setting the first few times I tried with 8+ buffs (this was on Expert). Did it with a gravitation potion first try with no other buffs. Just get a Meteor Staff and Golden Shower/something that can hit them when they're out of the meteor staff's range. Proceed to run away from them as far as possible without them despawning--the gravitation makes outrunning them MUCH easier.    Once you've got Souls of Sight, make a Magical Harp and the Destroyer is toast."

Terraria,3dxw1h,Echowhisker,25,Mon Jul 20 16:09:26 2015 UTC,THey should make the carts pieces a random drop from the mechs and have expert items that are better than the cart pieces. each boss has a chance to drop their piece.

Terraria,3dxw1h,PokemonGod777,16,Tue Jul 21 06:41:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think adding weapons as expert drops is a good idea. See how few of the existing (Shield of Cthulhu, Royal Gel, Bone Glove and Spore Sack) deal any damage, and most of them doesn't do damage directly. The Bone Glove is a joke and idk about Spore Sac but it isn't directly a weapon and encourages you to change your playstyle a bit. The slime mount and SoC aren't really there to deal damage but enhance the gameplay. Oh and the mechanical cart isn't really there to deal damage either, but to decrease the waiting time on the tracks and make certain arena strategies viable. IMO the expert drops aren't there to decrease the challenge but to make it more fun and satisfying. If the bosses drop free weapons on expert the player immediately gets a tool to deal with the next boss. This would probably kill the progression aspect of the game. But what if the weapons weren't powerful enough to deal with the next boss? They most likely would be useless and outclassed. That's how I look at it."
Terraria,3dxw1h,Skwiwel,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:16 2015 UTC,"I agree that adding weapons might lower the difficulty of Expert mode, but what if there was a way to get expert mode weapons off of the mech bosses AFTER you've defeated all of them?

Terraria,3dxw1h,Chum42,3,Mon Jul 20 17:47:58 2015 UTC,I don't really think there should be an expert item other than the mechanical cart. It's a nice addition overall imo. The bosses already offer their loot and this is enough. The people that want it changed are likely just playing the game for x time and looking for new things. The expert mode should be a challenge in the first place. I don't think there is a reason to not just make a new normal mode weapon crafted from existing loot. Normal mode would benefit and expert would still be harder relative to normal. Also making new craftable things could make the expert harder since you would need to beat the bosses more times which is often not easy.

Skeletron Prime - Lancegun (yay for the Monster Hunter reference to the Gunlance): a Melee-damage Spear that will throw bombs (like the Skeletron's arm) every time you thrust it.

Terraria,3dxw1h,IamChaoz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:38 2015 UTC,"I might suggest the Twins drop a magic or ranged weapon that alternates between a laser shot and a flame-thrower (to combine their two attacks).  Probe Controller sounds ""ok"", but the Oculus Staff already fills the role of a summon that shoots lasers and rushes enemies, so it'd be kind of redundant (moreover, would this be a summon or magic? Cuz repeatedly having to summon suiciding minions would get a bit tiresome).  I could actually see Destroyer dropping the minecart in full rather than just a part of it.  Handcannon sounds interesting, and why not use Cannonballs as ammo?  Then again, I'd probably say giving AI-Arms (or something) akin to Dr. Octopus would be just as good, with up to 4 arms possible and a 5th head.  Similar to the Stardust Dragon, subsequent casts of the summon would give you more arms, chosen randomly between a laser arm, a grenade arm, or the two melee/close range arms.  Then on the 5th cast you get a Head follower that spin-attacks at nearby enemies.  Each arm would take a minion slot, and the head too, so you'd need to be using some of the minion count boosting buffs/armor/accessories to make the most of it.  Mecha-Brain if ever implemented - Phaser Incantation ;  costs 50 mana to use, provides the Phasing buff for 10 sec.  While Phasing is active you can move horizontally through solid blocks, jump upwards through blocks, and downward similarly to wooden platforms through blocks.  Makes you immune to Suffocation while active.  After the 10 sec passes you get the Attenuation debuff, which deals damage to you similar to using Rod of Dischord too rapidly if you use Phaser again too quickly."

Read it again, you'll see what I mean.    Handcannon sounds interesting, and why not use Cannonballs as ammo?   Because Cannonballs do 300 damage. Soooooo would be pretty OP on a mid-game weapon.

The best you can get is an 86.944% chance to not consume ammo, by using the ammo box, a Vortex Beater, an Ammo Reservation Potion, a Vortex Breastplate and a Chlorophyte Helmet.  Edit: Actually, that info was taken directly from the wiki, but my own math shows an 87.2% chance instead.  In any case, it's right around there."

Terraria,3e2ecn,Ktesedale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"The wiki doesn't say it uses both the potion and box, though. They provide different buffs, so that's double the buff (box is a 10m buff with a different icon from potion's 7m buff). Or do they technically count as one buff but with different icons?  The character editor I use for my hacked character shows them as two seperate buffs, not sure if they act as two 20%s though."
Terraria,3e2ecn,Ktesedale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:43:01 2015 UTC,"The math (or at least my math) uses both potion and box.  They are different buffs, anyway.  So the way you figure this out is to multiply the chance to consume ammo together, then subtract it from one.  So you have the following chances to CONSUME ammo: 80% from the box, potion, and helmet, 75% from the breastplate, and 33% from the gun.  So that's 4/5 * 4/5 * 4/5 * 3/4 * 1/3, or 0.128.  That's a 12.8% chance to consume ammo, or an 87.2% not to.  I'm not sure how the original person did the math, but as far as I know my math, that's how I did it.

Terraria,3e2e37,paco1342,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:17 2015 UTC,"I would say give it a try, work on mobility for your ducking and dodging. Once you get the goblin tinkerer save up that money to reforge accessories for the warding prefix (+4 defense). Once you hit hardmode farm black recluses for the fangs to make a spider queen staff. It's pretty much a turret. It doesn't move, lasts for 1 minute, shoots at nearby enemies and, importantly, doesn't count towards the minion cap. If it's a play style you enjoy, then you can find a way to make it work. Warding accessories and mobility will be your biggest allies, and make sure that the warrior with you is aware of you at all times so they can swoop in to knock enemies away. They may consider going for things that grant higher knockback to help keep mobs away from you as much as possible. I would also suggest that you keep a backup weapon that auto swings very fast with high knockback, like a falcon blade or cutlass, just to keep enemies off of you, not necessarily for damage.   All of these tips are from a person who is in no way an expert or pro, nor do I regularly play summons. Just some thoughts, I hope they help!"

Then you switch tiki armor summon one more and finally switch to warding of the +minion accessories and defense accessories for the summon damage accessories.  I don't like the dragon for most situations.  Clearing pillars cells would be much faster/more responsive, which is what you need to keep you safe.  Maybe for moonlord dragon is better so you can hide.  For pillars you don't need the dragon off screen killing something when 6 things are swarming you.   I would only use pygmy necklace if you are doing only summoner damage otherwise use necromantic scroll and papyrus scarab as your +minion accessories.

The server will approach 4:30 am and suddenly be back 3 am or even 11:30 pm. I believe is has something to do with Steam Servers and lag with aussies while in america and the fact that each time it happens is after I raise the priority of terraria in Task manager.  Also when this lag is happening, some enemies will get glitch where they will start approaching us, get damaged, and suddenly reappear where they started moving and start coming at us again only for it to repeat.  I really don't think commands are even possible on steam servers, even more when I am the one hosting and I never put in a command"
Terraria,3dyhc3,vidyagams,2,Mon Jul 20 19:27:56 2015 UTC,"It's plausible actually. The server determines the in-game time, but it doesn't send it constantly to clients. So the client may think it's a different time than the server, and if the server CPU is bogged down then it will run slower than the client. Typically you'll often see mobs move then suddenly teleport back an inch or two.  This allows you to kill more mobs than usual in events. From the server's perspective it's just like you're moving around super fast with super-fast weapons."
Terraria,3dyhc3,sylvester334,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:41:09 2015 UTC,Yup. Been there only without the server lag. Sold 120 of each trophy when I was done with the final wave.
Terraria,3dyhc3,sylvester334,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:20 2015 UTC,I'm surprised the server only rolled the time back twice. When I ran a server with a a couple friends it was lagging so badly the time kept getting rolled back from 2 am to 10 pm until I had to restart world in single player.
Terraria,3dyhc3,Jokerzrus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:53 2015 UTC,See this lag made me more salty than most because we would have gotten out of the event deathless if all our buffs hadn't run out and I hadn't run out of bullets. We lost like 6 plat due to my Gf dying and the mobs picking it up

Terraria,3dzxhb,Chrisspray,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:00 2015 UTC,Very nice. I specially like the lighting =) You have made real effort with the background walls as well looks good.
Terraria,3dzxhb,Silicium_Avatara,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:21:38 2015 UTC,"Noice. To spice up the roof you can hammer them out and put platforms on the side and hammer them to stairs. The hammer really does magical things for houses.  For the two guard towers, instead of filling the roofs with wood, put another room up there for variety. Variety is key after all. Maybe put a little fire up there with living fire blocks for some lighthouse thing look. Don't guards use spot lights or something?  For the dungeon basement, noice lighting. But it is a bit too repetitive. Maybe cut out the center and make a neat lava fountain/shine to match the outside. I think iron doors would look better than block actuators because it looks like you can't access the npcs.  Better yet, you should make use of the surface and make your base wider. Make a bunch of houses on the left and right of you caste so it would be like a vassal state or something. You got a main caste already and some guard towers, so all you need is big ass gates on the left and right and a lots of houses around. You could put a moat of lava (water is for dorks)."

Terraria,3dzxhb,PieruEater,-10,Tue Jul 21 13:47:18 2015 UTC,"Looks like shit.    Theres no theme and the materials used dont go well together. palm wood with the castle walls looks out of place. The red lava light with the blue from the rooms doesnt work well. Windows in a medieval castle of stone looks strange.  The shape of the whole thing and the various parts are odd and looks almost random. the palm wood roofs on the towers are too clunky and plain looking (that torch on top doesnt exactly help the build either). The palm room on top of the main structure seems more like just a big misshapen create than anything else (no clear distinction between roof and wall and floor). The lava square is to square and simple. Also the lava isnt very fitting with the build.  Very poor decoration/detailing. The top palm room has too symmetrical decoration and too little decoration. The rest of the main building has no decoration at all just a bunch of trophys and armour stands which looks WAAAY too symmetrical, simple and boring. The various crafting platforms are just jammed into a room together which makes it look really simple and like you've rushed it just to get it done. The housing for the NPCs are a bit too simple for my taste, a tad bit more decoration and variation would do it. Again the palm wood torches are a catastrophy if you ask me, completely out of place.    The build is okay-ish as a whole but score poorly once u break it down. Theres no theme to it and it seems you've put little thought into what you actually want this to be. I do like the NPC homes, they look cold and a bit spooky, very dungeon like. Also, if u want to use symmetry, make sure the build is proportionate ( the towers should be a good bit taller than the main build and should be closer to the main building). And never use symmetry when decorating with furniture.   In this case the sum of it all is greater than the sum of the parts. The different aspects of the build varies from 1/10-3/10, with the exception of the NPC homes, which look good. All together, I cant give this build any higher than a 4/10 still."
Terraria,3dzxhb,jegji,5,Tue Jul 21 01:12:10 2015 UTC,Your opinion is factually wrong
Terraria,3dzxhb,Chum42,-4,Tue Jul 21 01:26:49 2015 UTC,care to explain?
Terraria,3dzxhb,jegji,4,Tue Jul 21 01:39:27 2015 UTC,"1.There is a theme to it, it is a castle, with a dungeon basement. that's enough of a theme to carry it to at least passable. The windows do look a bit odd, but adding a wooden border to them would improve it a lot. As for the blue/red, ever heard of contrast?  2.I'm not seeing the ""random"" of the shape. Its two towers and a large central building, with a dungeon under all of it. The little details like the small balconies on the tower add visual interest and a bit of noise to an otherwise boring straight line. And honestly the roof house does not look like some kind of creature, I have seen way more misshapen structures than that. Also, the lava serves function, rather than form.  3.The decoration is fine. Simplicity is not badness, and given the shape of the structure it would make sense he would leave a bit of white noise. I'm seeing a good application of rest and detail, the condensed stuff is right in the middle drawing the eyes to the center and letting you notice the trophies and statues easily. As for the torches, at the least they are consistent with the other palm wood.  I don't like rating, so I'm not going to comment on your numbers.  As an aside, claiming in the very first sentence that it ""Looks like shit"" then going on to explain why it isn't really that bad is kind of a dickhole thing to do."

Terraria,3e2dq7,Peutros,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:50 2015 UTC,not that you can anymore   I had to look this up. Damnit.  On the other hand...
Terraria,3e2dq7,Peutros,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:40 2015 UTC,"Sure, here is an unfailable strategy that i like to call the moonlord race, build a linear railtrack that goes from the far east of your world to the far west and make sure that you have the mechanical bosses minecart.  Now, if you have a few heart statues you are going to want to use them, but since you wont be able to stop while using the minecart you are going to want to craft a few Pressure plate tracks, those activate when you step on them with the minecart, making it possible to connect a few heart statues to a section of your track but be carefull as you are going to be travelling really fast and the hearts might take a few seconds to drop, to avoid missing the hearts make sure that the pressure plate track is a bit distant from the statues. Now for items your going to want to have a Vortex beater with A LOT OF chlorophyte bullets, i dont know if you know but chlorophyte bullets chase the enemy making it easy to hit the moonlord at the insane speed that you will be travelling, make sure to have at least 2 stacks of chlorophyte bullets. A problem that you may have is not knowing if you are hitting its core or not, as the core can only be hitted when it is open, for that you are going to want to have the DPS Meter, an item that shows your currently DPS, that way when the core is open, if you are shooting, the number on the DPS meter will change, if the core is closed then the number will not change saving you some ammo. For armor make sure to get the full Bettle armor with the Bettle SHELL, as survivability is far more important in this boss. For accesories the only really essential acessorie is the Philosopher's Stone, as it reduces the time that it takes to be able to drink potions, by the way make sure to have at least a stack of the Super Healing Potion, since you have already defeated the celestial towers before, this should not be a problem, other accesories would include ANYTHING that can increase your defense the most, make sure that all those accesories have the Warding modifier. Now to the gameplay, AS SOON AS you have defeated the last celestial tower tp home with the magical mirror and get ready, you might want to get a few buffs before starting like the ammo box buff to reduce your ammo usage, just make sure that you do this FAST as you only have around one minute before the moonlord spawns, when you are ready get to the minetracks, it doesnt really matter where you start the race just make sure to be on the minecart before it spawns. Now for the hard part, get to full speed as soon as it spawns and start shooting, you do not need to hold down the A or D keys if you are at the highest speed, now, the first thing you will notice is that as soon as you get kinda far from the boss it will teleport to you, dont worry about that, as you will be going too fast to this be able to cause any damage to you, have in mind that as he teleports you wont be able to cause damage to it, the only thing you REALLY have to worry about is its Death ray, that is the ONLY attack that should really hit you hard if you are using this strategy, it should hit you around 120 damage(i guess), if you were already damaged for whatever reason or you were not being able to heal fast enough to tank this attack use your potions but do not waste them, MIND YOUR HEALING. Theres a good part that you might want to take note, that is, if you are going at maximum speed and he uses his Death ray you ""might"" not be hitted by it at all, i guess that if he teleports and uses his Ray theres a chance that it might bug, i dont really know why it happens, the point is if you are too much damaged, GO AT FULL SPEED, going a bit slower will help you deal more damage. Sooooo that shoudl be it, i have never failed using this strategy yet but have in mind that i dont know if some kind of patching have happened to stop this strategy from working, if i remind of something else i will edit this. Good luck."
Terraria,3e2dq7,justanotherhoers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:59 2015 UTC,"wow, i wrote much more than i expected, lol, heres a TL;DR  Build a railtrack from the east to the west of your world and get the fastest minecart you can, use chlorophyte bullets to hit him and make sure to have as much defense as you can, when he spawns just ride the cart from the east to the west or west to east while shooting him."
Terraria,3e2dq7,Kordsmeier,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"""I used to be an adventurer like you. . ."" -Nameless Skyrim guards  To relate to the preface: I used to have difficulties with the Moon Lord as well.  But then I found the glory of the mechanical minecart.  The setup is simple: melee tank gear (beetle4dayz), warding accessories (absolutely and completely optional, but you may be wanting them more than not), a decent ranged weapon, the mechanical cart (obviously), a yoyo that has infinite stay (duration that it stays on your one click.. I'm bad with my words today), and a whole lot of dirt/minecart tracks.  I simply set up a huge bridge across the sky with a layer of tracks with a layer of dirt five blocks above (bridge is across the top portion of the sky.  If you let the yoyo drag far enough behind you and bring your mouse up as you're driving your cart, it will clip through the top layer of dirt, allowing you to mash on his top eye.  Also, if you're going fast enough, he cannot catch up to you, giving you plenty of time to heal.    tl;dr: Yoyos, minecarts, and lots and lots of dirt."

Terraria,3dzfmc,baddsybk,18,Mon Jul 20 19:52:09 2015 UTC,More defense would be great but they also need at least one more armor between spider armor and post plantera armors. Even if it's just a hallow or chlorophyte helm for summoners
Terraria,3dzfmc,aviatorzack,7,Mon Jul 20 20:37:27 2015 UTC,"They need a summoner specific weapon, or a small buff to their magic damage and mana usage. As it is right now, they have either mediocre physical abilities, or mediocre magic abilities with a little bit more damage from minions. Their armor is completely horrid and they're just all around in a bad spot right now.  They should give full summoner armor another +2(maybe) minions, along with a small buff to magic damage/crit %, a small buff to physical damage/crit %, as well as +armor. That way you could still play the class how you wanted to, physical or magic, and leverage mainly your minions."

Terraria,3dzfmc,Grimsley,11,Tue Jul 21 18:32:43 2015 UTC,"Expert?  What are you using to dodge the moon lords attacks?  If you want to only/mostly do summoner damage then you probably want to look at each attack the moon lord does and decide how you want to block/dodge it.     You can fly/minecart around. You can get the rod of discord (teleport to cursor staff). You can put up some walls and try to make an arena that works.  Standing in an open arena of platforms is probably not going to do it.    Hopefully you read up on the class and know they keep the damage they summon with, so you do a little min/max to summon them with spooky armor and max damage accessories and switch to tiki armor + defense accessories after you summon.    I personally think melee lends itself well as a hybrid as giving up 2-3 slots to the +summon items is not a big deal.  You can still get a lot of damage and defense from celestial stone, shell, and sun/moon ring balancing out the weakness of the class."
Terraria,3dzfmc,Lord_Peppe,4,Mon Jul 20 20:25:50 2015 UTC,I use the hover board to dodge his attacks ATM.

Thank you for taking your time to help :D
Terraria,3dzfmc,Lord_Peppe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:54:23 2015 UTC,I don't recall what I was summoning cells at before the final armor.  In final armor it was 193 and ~9-10 cells depending potion or not.  Usually not since I am lazy.  The should be a section on the wiki about summoning for max damage.  Spooky is only 8% less damage so you should be summoning 6 cells in the 170+ range and then swap to tiki for a 7th at slightly less damage on the final summon and more defense for you.    Then swap 4 slots for defense/hybrids class you want to be.  Should be in the 70-80 armor range.
Terraria,3dzfmc,Superarces,4,Tue Jul 21 07:53:07 2015 UTC,"I've always considered summoner the ""for when you're building or mindlessly caving"" class when you really don't want to bother with killing the enemies yourself. In actual combat, a ranger can do anything that a summoner can, but better, and with more options and defense.  I think the only things that really need to be changed with summoner is that the player needs a way to somewhat control the minions, and the minions need to do more damage. And I mean a lot more damage. If you're going to be that squishy, you better deal enough damage to make up for it.  I'm all for them being that squishy though, you don't really need to focus on attacking since your minion is doing that for you, and you're just adding damage."
Terraria,3dzfmc,DrMobius0,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I love summoner! It's probably my favourite class in the game. But the lack of damage and uber squishy ruins it for me.

I played as summoner on my current playthrough and only succeeded because I used the spike cheese before it was patched.

Then I'll probably do 1 Stardust Cell minion, and then the rest Dragon. Possibly one of the UFOs in there as well, or 2 Stardust Cells depending on how quickly the one ends up stacking his dots.  Edit: Quickly should be replaced with if he doesn't stack them fast enough I'll add in a second Stardust Cell. And then I'll probably just be dodging around on my UFO using the teleport staff to avoid his brain eye laser, and spamming bubbles with Flairon."
Terraria,3dzfmc,Deeepsix,2,Tue Jul 21 07:06:43 2015 UTC,"I posted a similar question over on the thread for ""Questions that don't deserve a full post"" about this:  Here.  My basic argument starts out with ""Why does the summoner only have a Summoner emblem when all other classes' emblems upgrade several times into an endgame item?"" Which then led into most summoner accessories are base items (I.E. items that are not crafted from anything).   A Usual melee/tank build for accessories might be Ankh Shield, Paladin Shield, Celestial Shell, Star Veil, Fire Gauntlet, (Wings/Frostspark Boots/Yoyo bag). Why put a new class in the game when most items used by said class are base items, or items with 1 upgrade to them? A usual summoner build would look like (the one i'm using too) Pygmy Necklace, Necromantic Scroll, Papyrus Beetle, Ankh Shield, Celestial Shell, (Vortex Booster).  I find it disappointing that all other classes accessories buffs/stats are from the equivalent of 20-25 items and summoners get 8-10 (Not counting Ankh Shield in either of those numbers, since that's just some OP bullshit that everyone should be using)  My final point was that the Stardust Armor's set bonus is horribly lacking. The CC only works on slow mobs, whereas everything late-game is very fast, especially when you're essentially fighting boss after boss after invade after boss come late-game. It deals no damage, nor as a summoner should you be standing in one spot for any duration of a fight, making you have to redeploy the Guardian every 2 seconds. It's more work to continue to deploy it over and over again for the payoff it brings. It's a complete waste of a set bonus. I wish i could just turn it off so i don't have to have it walk behind me everywhere, obstructing view when I'm building or fighting."
Terraria,3dzfmc,vybr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:47 2015 UTC,Oh sorry I didn't see this post. I just needed to rant after dying to the moon Lord.... A lot. Now that I've read what you posted I do agree summoners only have basic accessories and it's all about the minions. And the problem with more minions is you need to be toe to toe with the boss for them to do damage which means you stand more chance to being floored before the minions do enough damage.

Sometimes, while the Stardust Dragon is out, the Prism is simply unable to do any damage to the Moon Lord and that ends up unnecessarily delaying the kill by several seconds. Other users have experienced this issue, as well."

Terraria,3dxqse,bigcatpants,4,Mon Jul 20 19:36:50 2015 UTC,This is exactly it.

Terraria,3dxqse,GolldenFalcon,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:13 2015 UTC,What setup are you using in order to get that kind of DPS against moon lord? Takes me ages to manage to kill the eye on his head because it closes for like 30 seconds at a time.
Terraria,3dxqse,JebusMcAzn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:37:03 2015 UTC,"Full Nebula with all the damage buffs should give you more than enough DPS to take out his top eye before it can close (not immediately, but when he opens his eye again about 10 seconds after you summon him). My accessories are mostly damaging - I think I'm using Destroyer Emblem / Sorcerer Emblem / Celestial Stone / Celestial Shell / Celestial Cuffs, all reforged to Lucky, although Warding is fine as well and you can afford a Star Veil in there. I'm also using a Skeleton engine to keep my buffs up without moving and to constantly collect mana stars, so I never have to drink a potion."

Terraria,3dxqse,JebusMcAzn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, basically you have a few Skeleton statues (I use 3) somewhere below you on wooden platforms. The statues are wired up to a 1 second timer so the Skeletons continuously spawn as you or your summons kill them. Skeletons drop mana stars, so you never run out of mana, and also provide Nebula powerups so you don't have to move around collecting them."
Terraria,3dxqse,LaFolie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:55 2015 UTC,"The reason why the Stardust dragon causes that is because it does piercing damage and that give enemy a moment of invincibility. Since the dragon attacks so fast, it blocks out most attacks.  The dragon doesn't have an attack animation, it just floats over enemies. If there wasn't a invincibility for enemies, everything would just die instantly the moment it touched the dragon because the game registers attacks as fast as the ticks of the game."
Terraria,3dxqse,PeteTheLich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:12:46 2015 UTC,I dont think thats what he means   Monsters can only be attacked X times a second just like players (I dont remember the exact frequency) I think having max minions + a spell shouldnt hit that cap
Terraria,3dxqse,Sentinel_P,16,Tue Jul 21 00:47:15 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Enemies have invincibility frames just like the player, only much smaller. It's completely possible for your minions to deal such rapid damage that your own attacks will fail to connect. This is mainly for the slime and spider minions due to how they attack."
Terraria,3dxqse,Katchenz,13,Mon Jul 20 16:13:22 2015 UTC,It's also very bad if you're using a Stardust Dragon. You can lose a ton of your weapons DPS that way. Easiest way to test is against Planters or the Golem. This is the main reason I don't use melee pets often
Terraria,3dxqse,hiccup251,7,Mon Jul 20 16:29:40 2015 UTC,"This is a bit simplified. Not every hit an enemy takes will grant invincibility, but many sources are classified as ""piercing."" These initiate a 1/6th second invulnerability to further piercing damage for the enemy hit. As an example, the Stardust Dragon deals piercing damage. While it's hitting an enemy, projectiles fired from the Terrarian will have no effect, but you can still hit the enemy with the yo-yo itself because it is not classified as piercing damage.   You could hit an enemy with 1000 wooden arrows at the same time and it would take damage from all of them, but 1000 jester arrows would only hit once (unless the arrows remained within the hitbox for more than 1/6th second). It's important to consider piercing damage when trying to maximize single-target dps."
Terraria,3dxqse,PieruEater,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:07:14 2015 UTC,"Then all it would take to fix it for the dragon would be to make his damage non-piercing ? It wouldn't change the dragon's DPS since he's not a projectile anyway, right ?"
Terraria,3dxqse,hiccup251,4,Mon Jul 20 19:39:07 2015 UTC,"Minions are essentially projectiles with minion-like AI, but that's just semantics. Unfortunately, reclassifying the Stardust Dragon without making some pretty specific changes to its hit detection would break the game - the only thing keeping it from dealing damage every frame is the invincibility brought about by the piercing damage, so it would hit 10x as often as it does now. It would have to be changed to issue damage in 1/6 sec pulses, which would make its hit detection feel unresponsive (and would probably take a decent amount of work)."
Terraria,3dxqse,Honor_Bound,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"The spider minions do this I learned. When they are all swarming a mob, it's impossible for ME to damage the mob since they are hitting him so much."
Terraria,3dxqse,BionicAbeLincoln,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:34:27 2015 UTC,"The subject you're looking for is ""pierce"" damage.  I don't know much about pierce damage except that a target can only be taking pierce damage from so many sources at once.  For example, I noticed that fighting with my Solar Eruption barely got any hits in when I had summoned my Stardust Dragon, but when I summoned only Stardust Cells they didn't interfere.  So if you plan on not relying on many sources of pierce damage, then go ahead and summon a big dragon since he won't be interfering with you. Otherwise, try other summons or weapons.  Also, keep in mind many traps deal pierce damage as well."
Terraria,3dxqse,MasterSaturday,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:29 2015 UTC,"The only thing to keep in mind is that sometimes minions, if they're attacking quickly enough, can block you from registering a hit.  For example, if you have a slime staff and your baby slime is wailing on an enemy nonstop, your giant sword might just pass right through it.  It is sometimes better not to have a minion out because of this."
Terraria,3dxqse,PatatasFritas42,23,Tue Jul 21 03:57:11 2015 UTC,Would it be viable to use suspicious looking eyes in hard-mode when in another boss fight as a kind of heal by eating up the hearts EOC drops?

Terraria,3dxqse,scholarTD,3,Mon Jul 20 17:42:35 2015 UTC,You say that but I made a afk grinder in pre hardmode underground snow biome and let it sit for nearly 2 days and no metal detector or nymph banner. Then I made one in my  hardmode world and got the banner and a couple metal detectors in a relatively short timeframe. I believe I let the grinder run for like 6-8 hours.
Terraria,3dxqse,BigOmega,3,Mon Jul 20 18:43:01 2015 UTC,"An AFK grinder might not work because the Nymph spawns as a lost girl and then starts moving when you approach it. So any that spawn won't attack you if you're AFK. Although apparently if you find one and get close enough for it to attack, they will all spawn as nymphs from then on and skip the lost girl phase."
Terraria,3dxqse,schoolmonkey,3,Mon Jul 20 19:06:57 2015 UTC,"I made an afk grinder and it worked. I can also tell you with a reasonable degree of certainty that they never skip the lost girl phase. What you have to do is make a grinder that has the ability to kill the bats, clear the trash mobs, and agro the nymph.  Mine was essentially a very small box floating in a large empty room. The floor is there they spawn, slightly out of sight. Small lava layer in center below box, maybe 10 or 20 blocks wide, nothing specific just big enough, but enemies won't spawn on lava. Use a tempest staff, (I used an optic staff too, worked well as long as you have at least 2 sets of twins) to kill the bats but wont get stuck on/inside your box. Then use dart traps on 5s timers to agro the lost girls into the lava. Remember a water candle on a table and one in hand for maximum spawn rates."

Terraria,3dxqse,seriouslees,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:08 2015 UTC,First time i beat him i had a pretty tall tower that allowed him to burrow up and down through it and the mushroom spear that i got from having the truffle NPC in a surface mushroom house.  Wrecked him pretty damn quick.  Had a starveil as well to reduce the amount of damage i'd take from him passing through me so rapidly by reducing the amount of time i was vulnerable.  Spears pierce through his segments so if you can get a good spear and hit many segments at once you can do a ton of damage real fast.  And the mushroom spear is the best spear thats easily obtainable without beating bosses last i checked.

Also, make sure to use an helmet that actually fits the weapon you want to use.  From the fact that you're trying to beat the destroyer with a Crimson Rod, I'm gonna assume you're new here. One of the best ways to defeat the Destroyer is to use the Golden Shower. It's a magic crafted with Ichor which drops from Ichor Stickers in Underground Crimson and a Spell Tome sold by the Wizard. It shoots a piercing stream of Ichor which inflicts a debuff that reduces defense by 20 (the mech bosses are not affected, however). All piercing weapons are very effective against the Destroyer because they can hit a ton of segments of it at once, dealing a ton of damage. When you get it, the Destroyer should be a piece of cake.

Why isn't there one for the class for Summoner?  Edit: Also, I find it a bit discouraging to play the Summoner class because you normally have to be a little closer to bosses and mobs than mages or rangers to be dealing the large amounts of damage that comes with the class, but all of the accessories that a summoner would use are the first stage or second stage (Summoners Emblem, Pygmy Necklace, Necromantic Scroll, Papyrus Scarab, Celestial Shell(this is an outlier), whereas if you go melee/tank, an average build might be Ankh Shield, Celestial Shell, Molten Gauntlet, Yo-yo Bag, Star Veil. (I'm leaving the 6th slot for expert mode out, since that's normally dedicated to wings or Frostspark boots).   All in all, i think the summoner class has awesome weapons, but no real way to prioritize. All other classes have varying ways they can build and specialize, whereas Summoning is lacking in the accessory field. Any thoughts?"
Terraria,3dxqse,mynameis_caL,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:26 2015 UTC,"Summoner is kind of underrepresented as a class. It was added at a later date than the others and never really got the tools it needed to completely hold its own. That being said, the summoner's emblem is still a very good tool since summons not benefit from critical hit chance, so the raw damage is what's most important."
Terraria,3dxqse,OptionThirteen,2,Mon Jul 20 22:59:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah but i can guarantee that most people playing expert mode will want two of their six accessory slots devoted to a pair of wings and frostspark boots for overall playing. Based on the arena setup, you can PROBABLY forgo one of those, and if you're cheesing the fight, then both. What i dislike about the summoner class (and I really enjoy it, even with this as a huge disadvantage, I still play it over the others), is that Necromantic Scroll, Pygmy Necklace, and Summoner's Emblem are all base accessories, yet they are all essentially mandatory for the class, whereas you look at Melee for example, ""mandatory"" items are Star Veil, Ankh Shield, Celestial Shell, etc. They're all upgrades of upgrades at the very least. There are players out there getting stats/buffs from the equivalent of 20-25 items, depending on their accessories, whereas I'm here with 8.   I know i shouldn't expect much since I do know it's a much newer class compared to the other three, but it just feels lacking.  Edit: Also, looking at luminite armor sets, Stardust Armor seems to have the most lacking of a set bonus. The CC it provides on CC-able enemies is useful, as it keeps them in one spot if they have average or low movement speed, but it does pitiful amounts of damage, and it's in a passive state when on top of you, so you not only have to remember to deploy it, but stay within view of it so it doesn't snap back to you. For all boss fights i've done, i've just neglected to deploy it since it doesn't do anything and I'd have to redeploy it every 5 seconds anyways due to how much i'm moving around. It should at least damage enemies if they're on top of you to provide some benefit, no matter how trivial."

Terraria,3dxqse,AlmostKevinSpacey,2,Tue Jul 21 10:30:10 2015 UTC,"Sweet post, I got couple of questions   I am currently wearing turtle armor and playing on expert mode, ready to fight Plantera (there was a bug so I got turtle armor w/o knowing it, but ignore that), my accesories are harpy wings, charm of myths, moon shell, ankh shield, fire gauntlet and star veil, all reforged to warding. I killed all 3 mechanical bosses.    Weapons I use are legendary excalibur, Godly Shadowflame knife (primary wep, I use it in like 95% of situations), godly dao of pow, unreal flamethrower and unreal chlorophyte shotbow (im planning to use shotbow for the plantera with holy arrows). I am using all the potions I can and I even got the healing NPC constantly get spawned with queen statue, I am getting assisted with 3 other people, but somehow plantera always manages to beat the shit outta me, I try to dodge and everything, but I always end teleporting home with 50 hp.. So I got 2 questions, what should I use against plantera and golem, is beetle armor worth making and is my build currently good or bad, what should I change and for which weapons in future should I be going, also which ranged weapon shoud I use cause I need some ranged?   What's better, warding or menacing and in which cases?   Thanks for reading all this :D"
Terraria,3dxqse,LaFolie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:52:21 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that health scales with additional players in Expert, so by having 3 other people, Plantera gets MUCH harder. I used Fetid with Turtle armor and all Warding in normal mode, I'm not sure if that would still be practical.  I typically use warding in Melee classes and Menacing in ranged/magic."
Terraria,3dxqse,495Snivy495,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:13:20 2015 UTC,"I just defeated Plantera as a melee in expert mode recently and it was probably hands down the hardest fight I've done.  I rolled with turtle chest/pants and the chlorophyte mask. You dont get the return damage of turtle armour, but you get more defense and damage stats which I found more useful. Once you get beetle armour you can fully transition.  I made a jungle arena underground that spanned maybe 2+ screens sideways and had some spaced out platforms. Key items were the Blessed Apple mount, Shield of Cthulhu and the Terrablade. I'd basically just sprint up to one end of the arena on the unicorn while shooting back at Plantera. Once I got the end, I'd jump up to the next platform, turn around, demount and use the shield sprint effect and quickly remount. This way I'd never lose sprint momentum on the unicorn from having to change direction. Basically rinse and repeat this for awhile while chugging an occasional potion if I ever took a few hits."
Terraria,3dxqse,schoolmonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:54 2015 UTC,"Shotbow + holy arrows is very effective against her. Just make a large enough arena to kill her in. Dodge in circles for the first part of the fight, then just run straight away for the second part. Try to get a Magic Quiver btw, it really helps with the arrow damage."
Terraria,3dxqse,RedFlameGamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:23:03 2015 UTC,"Good arena is a base. Make sure you're killing Plantera in underground as on surface, she gains multiple stats. Campfires, heart lanterns, honey pool... My guess would be Megashark as main weapon. Set a few teleporters from edge of your arena to other edge. Also it needs to get used to, but Shield of Cthulu is completely awesome accessory for dodging, which I used for basically everything until I got a ninja set (after Golem I believe)  If you'll still have problem, I can screenshot you the arena I used when I get home. If you're dying, warding all the way.  Oh and maybe consider getting Frozen Turtle Shell. Extremely good if you're dying quickly (but extremely annoying to farm) and possibly Worm Scarf."
Terraria,3dxqse,LaFolie,2,Tue Jul 21 11:33:01 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to determine where is the best place to build a base in Hardmode. Should I make it in a snow biome, make it floating off the ground so enemies can't reach it as easy, or something else? Any suggestions for biomes and locations?"
Terraria,3dxqse,TheatreLife,3,Tue Jul 21 00:21:02 2015 UTC,I personally prefer just building it directly above the starting point (center of map). The neutral forest spawns the weakest enemies and you can rest easy knowing that half your base won't be contaminated by the Corruption/Hallow V. Building it 7+ blocks off the ground is always a good idea.
Terraria,3dxqse,francis_0000a,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:20:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think biome selection really matters because you are going to be traveling all over the world for a various reason.  However base design does matter somewhat. Putting the base off from the ground is a good idea so zombies and others can't easily flood your house. I did the same and made my house floating and I noticed that npcs on the first floor of any house would die the fastest even with the space. So put your npcs on second floor and above.  Some people like to put their bases underground but I think wraiths would be an issue since they go through blocks.  Honestly, you don't need to concerned about the defenses of your base because if npcs die they respawn the next day. You wouldn't be fighting bosses in your house since you got an arena for that. I worry more about how my base looks then how it functions haha.  http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:Bases"

It will save you from a large chunk of damage allowing you actually make it back to full health if you can evade well. I personally found the cthululu dash accessory to be really helpful too.  I just beat it on expert for the first time today (never having encountered the lunarevents) and it was pretty rewarding, but a LOT more difficult than the wiki led me to believe. At first, I tried my standard platform stages with heart lanterns and a general circle pattern (melee only so far). I used all enhancing combat potions and the stardust dragon rod. Beetle armour, all warding accessories. But it didn't work, never even got to the core. His damage is just insane and his attacks become unavoidable.   I then tried just a platform line across the map, just wasn't fast enough. (Maybe asphalt will work there?)  On my third attempt I made a 999(maybe only need 300-400) long minecart track with bumpers at each end as well as one boost track by each bumper (may not even be necessary). Using the mechanical minecart, speed was excellent. Just below the track I ran platforms with heart lanterns and statues(6). Close enough so that the heart reach potion brings them to you in the cart.   Once that's prep'd you just bost everything immediately after the last altar is destroyed or about 30s after you consume the summon item.   I really recommend a summoning potion and bewitching altar(whichever one you find in the dungeon) so that the stardust dragon summon is 3 segments.  Using this method I went from a ridiculous struggle to get him to 30%hp before I basically die instantly, to killing him without falling under 250hp.  There is still a lot is dodging(jumping while in cart) and the rod of discord is 100% needed to avoid beams and generally bad situations/movement.  I wish you luck man. It seemed hopeless to me at first, being new to all of this, but just took a few methods and learning his cycle of attacks."

Terraria,3dwvwv,nkorslund,30,Mon Jul 20 05:25:36 2015 UTC,Pink slime blocks do cause you to bounce a bit when you jump on them.  I would like to see some super bouncy blocks though.  A functioning trampoline system would be so much fun!
Terraria,3dwvwv,Nimbal,9,Mon Jul 20 05:27:55 2015 UTC,A supercharged bouncy block that actually increases your bounce speed (maybe up to a set maximum) would be really fun.

Terraria,3dwvwv,Impudenter,4,Mon Jul 20 10:37:03 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping pink slime blocks would completely convert your falling velocity into upward velocity, but the bounce height seems to cap out at a certain point, and then it just decays until you come to a stop.  What I'm really saying is that I'd like pink slime blocks to act like the blue gel from Portal 2.  (And if it did, things would get weird, considering that frozen slime blocks, which are blue, act like Portal 2's orange gel. Oh well, they can still be painted the right colors I guess.)  edit: Forget that last part. Frozen Slime Blocks have nothing to do with acceleration. They don't increase your speed at all, so the true ""orange gel"" in this case would be Asphalt. So that last point has mostly fallen apart."
Terraria,3dwvwv,Skogz,2,Mon Jul 20 13:59:55 2015 UTC,"The bouncy blocks we currently have were sort of disappointing. I mean, the icy slime blocks let us keep all of our velocity, so it would just make sense if the bouncy blocks would allow us to keep all of our jump height. In my opinion."

Terraria,3dx0wq,MonthOLDpickle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:47 2015 UTC,"Upon further research, I learned that the reason for a shared pool is so I don't have to make a 300 unit pool for each biome to retain maximum fishing effectiveness.

Fun fact: Negative dye does weird but awesome things with the Familiar Wig and hair dye. I only ever tested this with the Time hair dye, but I think what happened was it inverted the brightness of my original hair while the Time hair dye colored it the usual way, so it had the same color as before but the outline was brighter than the rest of the hair, and that looked super rad.  Unfortunately, because two of the four endgame armors change their brightness depending on how many pieces are visible, using familiar hair with either the solar flare armor or the stardust armor will rather drastically reduce the coolness of their appearance."

Terraria,3e22tw,UnluckyLuke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:08:57 2015 UTC,"Here are my suggestions:   Get the Vortex Beater or Phantasm instead. The Unreal modifier is a must. Change your helmet accordingly.  Craft Super Healing Potions Get a UFO Flying Mount and get rid of boots and wings. You just got two free accessory slots! Celestial Stone, Celestial Shell, Ranger Emblem, Sniper Scope, Avenger Emblem is a better combination IMO Since you're having trouble, I suggest reforging all your accessories to Warding. That'll give you a lot of extra defense. Use buff potions! But be warned, you can only have 22 buffs and debuffs active. So either don't use too many potions, or disable your pet, etc. Add heart lanterns, campfires, and maybe sunflowers to your arena. A heart statue farm is very useful. You can use the Rod of Discord to avoid the Moon Lord's death ray   Tell me if you have any questions! All of this might not be necessarily doable without farming the Wall of Flesh or something, but they're all steps in the right direction"

Terraria,3e1hr0,GeekyMeerkat,2,Tue Jul 21 06:01:20 2015 UTC,"The monsters spawn in a fixed position in relation to the player, the resolution that you use does not change or influence it.  Build the houses so that when you stand in one house the adjacent NPC housing can be just seen on the edge of each side of the screen (for 1920x1080 resolution).  You can also use sunflowers, pink candles and calming potions to suppress spawning.  The most drastic option would me to place walls everywhere and fill in the caves below the ground surface, so that there are no valid spawn locations."
Terraria,3e1hr0,thisisbleep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:18:29 2015 UTC,"This raises an interesting question... what if I was to just create a large world, and build this safe flat land really thin but 50 or so blocks up from the surface? If there was just open air below the village wouldn't monsters not be able to spawn or would I start to get out of the forest biome and into the sky biome at that point?"
Terraria,3e1hr0,thisisbleep,2,Tue Jul 21 06:33:18 2015 UTC,The mobs could still spawn on the dirt bridge that you build up in the air and if you go too high up you risk getting harpies which are worse because they do not need to spawn on blocks (do cannot be stopped spawning).

Terraria,3e1xh3,Anton_ergo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:34:02 2015 UTC,"the extreme momentum is only possible because of portals; and no I haven't really fiddled with it much beyond using it as a means to drop down a hellavator quicker (especially at end-game when you've probably stopped using the slime mount in favor of the unicorn, ufo, or drill containment unit).  edit:  I should clarify, portals themselves will despawn after you pass a certain distance from them, but that doesn't end the increased velocity.  So, short of using two perfectly placed portals in the direction you are falling to launch yourself back up, up to a potential height of wherever you fell from (or more likely, wherever the converted 153 speed would get effected by gravity, slowing you down most likely much lower than where you originally fell from)."

Here's my beef with mediumcore: yeah, I get that there's the extra challenge of having to get your stuff back, but the problem is persistence.  I don't always have the luxury of being able to leave Terraria running until I can get my stuff back. My proposed solution is simple: death chests. Just create a chest next to the tombstone that has all the dropped stuff in it. I don't really understand the logic in penalizing players who don't have the time/ability to leave Terraria on until they can recover their stuff.  Death chests would also give you more reason to come back to the game after a devastating loss. Having to find all your stuff provides a lot of motivation.  Alternatively, the player should just lose their stuff immediately, so that those who have the ability to leave Terraria running are equally screwed.

We either got bored or something else, but we stopped playing. 2-3 Weeks ago I saw some Yrimir videos in my Subbox so i decided to check what's new about the game and after I saw some of the expert bosses I got really hyped and decided to buy the game and made a friend of mine play it with me as well. We're currently on the Lunar event for the 2nd time, struggling to kill the Moon Lord and so far I've had A LOT OF FUN! And no, we're not some professional players that don't die.

So far (we haven't gotten to WOF yet) we have been able to come up with a new strategy after every fight so we did not lose to the bosses more than once.

Terraria,3dwg9v,ProfessorSpike,4,Mon Jul 20 07:08:04 2015 UTC,"I played relatively recently and they're dirt cheap now, like 75k."

Terraria,3dwg9v,AlmostKevinSpacey,3,Mon Jul 20 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, I farmed the dungeon below the legends guild for days to afford one. According to the wiki, they're about 75,300 gold."
Terraria,3dwg9v,Fatdisgustingslob,2,Mon Jul 20 14:34:05 2015 UTC,and 75k is literally nothing.  You can easily make 10-20m an hour.

Terraria,3dwg9v,Reverissa,13,Mon Jul 20 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"Wow. Talk about a blast from the past. I created my current username for Runescape, like... some years ago. More than five but less than ten, I guess? I dunno, I can't find my old account anymore so it's probably been deleted.  I remember participating in the 2007 christmas event with the snowglobe which allowed players to fill their inventory with snow balls which they could throw at other users during any time of the year, which was awesome and probably could be used to show off like a jackass to people who did not participate in an event from nearly 8 years ago.  So I guess if I was around for that, my character was probably made in 2007, and therefore my username was also created then. Wow. Approximately eight years with this username. Huh.  edit: I REMEMBER THE GRAND EXCHANGE. I mean, like, I remember it was added when I was playing. I just looked it up and it was added around the end of November 2007. So, that doesn't really help me narrow it down, but uhh... reaffirms my previously made conclusion. Some time in 2007. Probably during the fall."

Terraria,3e1h3f,zenongreat,3,Tue Jul 21 05:55:11 2015 UTC,or like this; http://imgur.com/a/cXK6H  :D
Terraria,3e1h3f,dresden_88,2,Tue Jul 21 06:44:51 2015 UTC,"You can do it pretty easily with a well-designed arena. Mine is basically a very, very long box with teleporters and pressure plates at either end so I can run in one direction indefinitely. It's around 600 blocks long and five blocks tall on the inside - the length isn't really important as long as it's at least 300 or so, but it does need to to that tall so you can ride the unicorn mount and replace the boots with another damage or defense accessory. Place campfires and heart lanterns every 96 blocks.  You will also want to make a Solar Eruption (costs 18 Solar Fragments). Reforge it to Godly if you can. It hits through blocks and has way, way more damage and range than the Death Sickle. After you beat ML a few times, you can incorporate the Terrarian and Star Wrath into this setup to make the job go even smoother.  Just run in one direction and whale on him with the Eruption. The solid blocks will prevent the head's big death laser from hitting you. If you can match his speed, then most of his other attacks will miss. You can do the body parts in any order you want, but killing the head first seems to be a tiny bit easier than killing the hands first. If you need to switch directions during the fight, the easiest time to do it is right after you go through a teleporter.  If you're still having trouble, you can station the Nurse in a house at one edge of the arena, and quickly hit her up right after you teleport.  Good luck!"
Terraria,3e1h3f,KaiserYoshi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:23:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely give this setup a try - the really important part, imo, is the overhead blocks to prevent being hit by his head laser + Solar Eruption.    Also, make sure you're using potions, because you don't mention those - I highly suggest the lifeforce one that increases your max health to 600, and the other typical boss ones - regeneration, ironskin, endurance, food for the well-fed buff, and wrath.  I'd also suggest stationing heart statues along the path."
Terraria,3e1h3f,Ktesedale,3,Tue Jul 21 06:44:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, Yrimir. Admittedly on an earlier version, but still. Both Normal and Expert mode."
Terraria,3e1h3f,sumogypsyfish,2,Tue Jul 21 09:28:12 2015 UTC,"This what I beat him with. Granted the arena I set up was made to block most of his attacks. Cant remember the modifiers or the combination of accessories I used the first time but it was similar to this. Got the idea from here    Gear Beetle Armor Legendary/Godly Solar Eruption Ruthless Frost Hydra Ruthless Dragon Staff Warding Ahnk Shield Warding Star Veil Warding Celestial Stone Menacing Avenger Emblem Menacing Firey Gauntlet     Enclosed Arena House with the following Heart Lanterns Star in a bottle Honey Campfire Sunflowers Bewitching Table Crystal Ball 3 Heart/Star statues wired to 1 second timers. Just about every buff potion/imbuement I could use.   Basically just stay in your arena house and use the solar eruption to his his hands and head down to low health, not to kill. Then take out the head and then the 2 hands as close as possible. Then go for the chest. The main attacks that will deal damage will be the eyes hitting you through walls and his health steal. The buffs and heart statues will keep you alive. Then you more or less cheese him out by hitting him through the walls with the solar eruption and let your two summons chip for a little extra.

Terraria,3e1g3x,thisisbleep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:01:36 2015 UTC,You could always use TShock to force the spawn if you are unable to move it.  Keep the ground level the same when you destroy the dungeon and there is a chance that they will just spawn there anyway. I haven't tested it myself but other people have managed to fix the spawning when they got the ground level to match the original dungeon.

Still not quite as fast as Shroomite Claws but not far from it. A mandible sword that can fire a sand ball when attacking every second or so, like the antlions do. Hits an enemy/wall, drops some sand on the ground after doing damage. An Antlion charger mount.

Terraria,3e09vd,theklocko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:12 2015 UTC,"Even if the tiles aren't infected with Corruption/Crimson, I thought you still ran into issues if you are too close to the biome.  The wiki says:   If a House is located near Corruption or Crimson, it may become uninhabitable. If these spread near an occupied House, the NPC living there may move out and wander the area until a new House becomes available.   Edit: There's nothing else apparently (to me, anyway - I'm not an expert) wrong with the house... so just trying to help think of possible reasons!"
Terraria,3e09vd,divine_right,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:40:53 2015 UTC,Corruption or Crimson within a 45 tile radius contributes to a rating score which must be under 250 to be suitable for housing. You need to remove the crimson.

Terraria,3dzvu2,8oz_of_sweet_heroin,6,Mon Jul 20 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"Only thing you really need is a path to hell/lava layer where you fight wall of flesh.  That area will not change after you kill wall of flesh.  Some additional things to prepare for:  Usually step one after killing wall is check where the surface hallow/corruption is and block it from getting to your NPCs.  Hallow is not bad, but you don't want corruption/crimson near the npcs.    Step two break 3+ alters.  It will be harder to get to them then pre-hardmode, so if you are worried you can dig a safe tunnel to them, before hard mode so you can break them without having to face the upgraded monsters head on.  If you are not good at moving around with just a grapple and rocket boots then you might move/create a mini jungle biome for the witch doctor and save up 2 platinum.  He can sell you your first wings.  Next go back down to hell and check the ceiling/transition area for the new ores.   I usually just get enough for the picks to upgrade to the third teir, but it will depend on your world which 3 ores you got.  Generally any one of the three with set bonuses: palladium, orchalcum, and titanium are  better than any tier of the other 3.   Depending on your class you may upgrade to hard mode weapons from the ores, drops, other crafting.  Then I would fight wall of flesh for a while.  You don't use up his emblems as much, but it is still nice to have a lot of them.  After you kill a mech boss this lava/hell area gets difficult again, so now is the time to farm for guide dolls and wall of flesh drops."
Terraria,3dzvu2,Lord_Peppe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:27 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar position as OP, about to move into hardmode for the first time.  As far as keeping your base safe from corruption/hallow, am I good if I've dug out a three column wide tunnel below and around my base? Basically, I'm sitting atop a giant 'u' shaped tunnel now, but I don't know if I've left myself enough room to expand outwards if I need to."
Terraria,3dzvu2,BeezyBaby42,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"Usually if you built around spawn your house will ok.  The issue with the corruption/crimson getting close is NPCs won't move in, so separating your house from the ground will keep the house safe if it is made of corruptible blocks, but you may need to protect the grass within a screen or two of your base -- just uncorruptable blocks 4-5 wide down ~3 blocks (wood works), so you can be confident if the corruption starts anywhere past that at least your internal patch of grass will be safe.   No matter what if it gets all messed up there is a tool you can buy after the first mech boss that can cleanse ~40-60 blocks at a time."
Terraria,3dzvu2,Lord_Peppe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:53:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I read about the Clentaninator and started wondering if I was freaking out over nothing. I'll expand my tunnel a little bit for peace of mind as well."

Do you recommend droppin any of these weapons and selectively choosing a specific class or continue with what I have.  Also another thing, I'm not sure if I mis heard but when you break an altar crimson block is randomly placed somewhere in the world which can cause it to spread. I'm not sure if that's correct or if that was the hollow"
Terraria,3dzvu2,XytronicDeeX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:30 2015 UTC,"Normal or expert mode?  Anything works in normal just give yourself a path to walk/run backward.  I usually build a walkway out of ash blocks.  ~800 for normal 2000+ for expert.    Beenades are the easiest, but your other list should all work well.  Instead of mini-shark rangers usually use the hellstone + gun (pheonix blaster if i recall).  Medusa at the start might be interesting to clear the hungries, but scythe is strong enough on its own anyway.  The class sets at that point are usually the difference between a few defense and %15 damage.  In expert I would go for some warding accessories and make sure you have some form of hermes boots.  In normal go with whatever you have.  yes, breaking alters will spawn a tiny patch of hallow and crimson/corruption in the world.  It has never really bothered me, but technically you don't have to break any.  If you care about a world enough you can go back later and use the cleansing gun to cleanse 40-60 blocks at a time.   To avoid the random blocks, you could fish for crates in normal and open them in hard mode.  The crates will randomly have ore of all types in them.  I personally don't think the time sink of that is worth it outside of hardcore."

Terraria,3dyjot,Illogical_Blox,4,Mon Jul 20 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"I am also fond of building small fortresses on the borders between biomes, particularly to protect pure areas. Here are some things I like to build into my border forts:   Make it block the spread of corruption. It's sitting on top of corruptable stone. As soon as you hit hardmode the corruption will spread right past it. The most thorough way of doing this is to dig a 3-wide hellevator all the way down right below your bulwark. Make a two-stage gate. So you have to pass through two doors for extra defense against a foul, corrupt creature following you through.  Heart lantern, star in a bottle, honey reservoir, and a sunflower for extra buffs Place to hang banners to further weaken corrupt enemies that would challenge your fortress Active defenses. Dart traps in normal mode, Lizhard traps in hard mode. Alternatively rain lava on threats with a pump system.  Add a spawn point (safe room with bed). A couple weapon racks to show off the spoils of your campaigns into the corruption. Actuate walls with player-only pressure pads so that nothing can open the fortress except you. Add node to minecart or teleporter network."

I feel that what the devs are essentially saying with this latest handful of updates is ""sure, we want the player's creativity to be an important part of the game... as long as it fits within our vision for where that can go.""    I think they're a bit too proud of the Moon Lord and can't stand the idea of him being ""solved"" like literally every other boss in the game.  The issue with that, in my opinion, is that having consistent, methodical strats available for every boss is important to how the game has been played from day one - i.e., farming, speedruns, and other self-imposed challenges.  I love much of 1.3, but the way endgame has been handled (and rehandled in patches since) is probably the single most flawed part of the game right now."

Terraria,3e1acx,zenongreat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:30:24 2015 UTC,Perhaps when you zoom by on the minecart you miss a few stars and they fall off the platform to the bottom of your arena.   I know if you are just on the edge of their magnetic radius and you zoom oast an item it'll just fly in the direction you were going and fall.

I've been able to collect 30 or so in my time playing, making it fairly easy to get out of dodge when needed.  This makes it much easier to do cavern exploring on hardcore mode in an expert world, and makes it so people who don't want to save-quit have an easier way out."

Terraria,3dyyk1,Wrulfy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'd add, somewhere between 4 and 6, is to find an enchanted sword or arkhalis. The shrines tend to spawn pretty close to the surface and rather commonly. They both have great damage and light and really help, as offense can be the best defense.  My other issue would be the absolute lack of life crystals you'd have before going to the desert. I always scuttle around at least a bit in the upper depths to get up to 200 before going to any challenging underground biome. Of course, once you can explore comfortably down there, you'll find them much more easily due to the connectedness of the caverns, but those first five are critical for doubling your survivability."
Terraria,3dyyk1,Eoje,3,Mon Jul 20 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"Enchanted Sword, Arkhalis, Ice Blade, and Starfury are all great early-game swords if you can find one.  Practice avoidance during the early game. You're going to get hit hard by everything. Also, if you have 200 health and 10 armor, Eye of Cthulhu can spawn on its own, so only cross that threshold if you feel confident."
Terraria,3dyyk1,Eoje,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"Starfury's a bit harder to find (requiring gravity potions, meteor armor, or large construction projects) and Ice Blade requires a little underground exploration at a point where you don't have enough speed to counteract the irritating slow that ice water gives you, making dodging rather tough.   The shrines, though many may deem them luck-based, are rather easy to find if you know what to look for. Just tunneling one screen under the surface across a forest biome will give you one more often than not, and they're available instantly- their least puny defender is the occasional giant worm.  And yes, I agree- staying at 180 can be a good idea if you're scared. :)"

First, the stair version - less space for storage, but it duplicates faster.  Wiring.  Second, the ledge method - more compact, more storage, and looks better, imo.  Slightly slower to duplicate.  Wiring (had to show it on lava, the water gen area has a ton of wires from teleporters going through it).  Both are the same idea - outlet pumps on the top, making the liquid fall over some sort of block, which duplicates the liquid.  It then falls to the bottom, where an inlet pump sends it back up to the top, all on a 1 sec timer."

Drop that one potion and I think you'll be better off.  Also, the 45% from the beetle armor is not constant. Most of the time you'll be at 97% - 45% = 52% damage reduction AT HALF HP. Still nothing to scoff at but not nearly as fancy as you're suggesting here."

As much as I am a tank/HP/defense lover myself, you quickly realize that a full 100% tank is barely even a viable build for multiplayer as mob aggro is strange most of the time. Especially bosses, where it's most important.  This type of build would be fantastic for cheesing bosses, but for the majority of the game, you'd need to substitute a large amount of damage mitigation for something that would be comfortably workable, i.e., more damage."

It's better to go full movement and practice the dodging.  It's the best you can get in Terraria, it's just not worth the damage tradeoff, in my opinion. I'd rather kill them before they get to me but still have an average/acceptable level of defense for when they inevitably do get to me."
Terraria,3dzwo1,Lord_Peppe,3,Mon Jul 20 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"Frozen Turtle Shell, Worm Scarf, and endurance potion stack additively = 25+17+10 = 52%  Turtle armor applies after the 'endurance' category (so multiplicative) ~= 75.4%, 67.6%, or  59.8% damage reduction depending on stack amount.  Armor reduces damage by a flat amount first then % reduction is applied.   Still good, but turtle shell probably not worth it's slot. I'd personally rather have celestial stone, which stacks with the shell."
Terraria,3dzwo1,Mista-Smegheneghan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"Is it right that damage reduction is additive and not multiplicative? I find it difficult to believe that there'd be a way to give yourself a nigh-impenetrable defence for three hits and then still gives you a major damage reduction for a majority of the time. I know that Ammo Reduction (or chance to not use ammo) is multiplicative, since you could take a bunch of reduction-chance items and buffs and theoretically give you a guaranteed chance to never use ammo. I'd need to do experiments with the maths, since I know that the Wiki's still going over the data. Ah! I know one way you could test this - find a detonator and TNT, and set it off. They do an average of 2000 damage, and I know that with 120-ish defence and the full Beetle buff, I only took 800 points of damage from it. I forget if I had any other add-ons, but basically I was tanky, and I STILL died to the Detonator.  Even so, I found it tremendously funny to have enough defence to take chip damage from lava of all things, without the Obsidian Rose."

You can do it with normal grass, but jungle has better bait. And it doesn't have to be in the jungle.  Anyways, dig pits on each side of this ""pole"", probably 5 wide, and put barriers up on the edges, so bait cannot escape.  Stand on the grass with the boots on so flowers/background plants grow. Get a yoyo, aim down, and let it rip, and you should get plenty of bait flying out of the grass.  If you don't have the boots, just make rows of jungle grass and break them when they are tall.

If you are playing through legitimately then you need to plan the battle and think about your playstyle. In normal mode you can beat any boss with a basic arena and minimal planning, Expert mode is meant to be the opposite, and maybe it isn't for you, as you said yourself you aren't a great player yet.  That said with the queen bee the best strategy is to use spike balls in a wooden platform arena, and to dash through her with the shield of Cthulhu when she dashes at you.  Skeletron is easiest in a large arena when you have accessories like Cloud in a Balloon, bundle of balloons, and frog legs, as you can easily dodge and kite him with a little practice, for the WoF I use Hermes boots and a Megashark/space gun and rarely do I have trouble if I have a good bridge.

Terraria,3dyymz,mayainverse,5,Mon Jul 20 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"Mage is capable of rather extreme DPS in nearly any situation; Last Prism, Lunar Flare, and Razorblade Typhoon are all great examples of mage's ability to overwhelm. Last Prism, with no damage buffs at all, is easily capable of pushing 50k DPS against a line of 10 target dummies, and over 6k to a single/isolated target dummy. Lunar Flare is capable of similar results on a vertical path. All while, Razorblade Typhoon maintains high usage flexibility in a blend of projectile speed, mobility/maneuverability, fair mana cost (negligible with nebula armor), crowd control (it bounces from target to target, doing chunks of damage), and ""unlimited"" pierce rate (eats segmented mobs alive), and when used with Spectre armor (lifesteal) it becomes an amazing ""tanking"" weapon, making it an ideal ""go-to"" weapon.  this is all just a wizard's opinion of course, you're welcome to form your own opinion :p"

Cyberpunk is more like futurism with advanced technology (mostly computer or A.I. technology and cybernetic implants and things like that) that's set in dystopian, criminal, or low class settings.   It can be hard to define but you know it when you see it. Some well know examples of things that are usually considered Cyberpunk are the Matrix films and the Deus Ex video game series."

Thankfully, it's possible to slightly get around the lack of paint support by painting one of the block you want painted, saving the world, then using tedit to copy and paste that block into the shapes you want. It won't show the paint in the editor, but when you enter the world, the paint will be there.   Actually, funny thing, if you paint a block and then use tedit to put a different block in its place (but not by pasting), the paint will be applied to the new block instead of being erased. It must have something to do with the way paint data is stored. If I had to guess, I'd say it's a separate layer. That would explain why painted ice can get corrupted and still hold the same paint."
Terraria,3dvwre,Deadeyez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"You get exponential very quickly, yes.  And just to bump up that exponent a little more...  I'd say even more useful than ""each tile / wall with each paint"" would be, in my opinion, each tile with every wall.  Often the best way to spruce up a build is to avoid using the same material for the bricks and the background.  Then go another layer: the walls, floor, and ceiling / roof should be different materials too, right?  Better show all possible combinations of three different tiles with a background wall.  But hang on - large rooms could really use a break in the solid background: I wonder what two background walls would complement each other ...  I count 135 backgrounds and 105 tiles.  That's 14 thousand combinations.  Allow for different flooring and you've got about 1.5 million combos.  Allow for different roofs, 156 million.  Mix in a second background, 21 billion.  Then multiply each of those by the number of paint colors...  That's a lot of worlds.  Might need a bigger hard drive :)"

The crates alone is worth it as it saves you time in hunting down HM ore. Save all the crates you get during pre-HM and open them during HM to acquire the new ore. If you have enough, you can even bypass breaking altars.  You could also get pets, tools, and weapons from fishing.  http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Fishing#Usable_Items  Some fish you catch are ingredients for potions.

Terraria,3e0h1q,TwistedBOLT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:31:33 2015 UTC,How do you have Magnet Sphere pre-mech?  If that is not a typo just use that.  It out damages anything you have and you don't need to aim.    Same for magical harp... it is post mech.  If you have it you can use it to kill destroyer.
Terraria,3e0h1q,Lord_Peppe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:23 2015 UTC,I play on this expert world and I used to play on a normal world with a friend who hosted the server but because he can't play anymore I can't use that map. The problem with the sphere is that if I run in 1 direction with my platform that weapon is useless because the bosses just rung though it and taking only a few ticks of damage. Now that I think about it I never really tried spamming it...
Terraria,3e0h1q,Lilpu55yberekt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:39:44 2015 UTC,"For the destroyer let it chase you parallel to the platform. Jump up to a platform directly above it and fire the magnet sphere down it's length towards it's head, or fire the harp towards its tail.  I haven't tested it but with lightning boots you might be able to straight up outrun the destroyer, especially if you are on an asphalt bridge. If you can outrun him the get him to chase you parallel and just fire the Magnetsphere and the Harp down it's length, you should be able to kill pretty quickly.  For Skeletron prime and the Twins you should Kite them while using the Magical harp and throwing out a magnet sphere whenever your previous one expires. If possible try and Kite them into the magnet sphere projectile to damage them more."

Terraria,3e0gat,kerrrsmack,3,Tue Jul 21 00:25:22 2015 UTC,"First off, this game is compared to minecraft very often. And while sure, they do have some similarities, they aren't anywhere close to each other as to what the games are about.  When it comes to terraria, the main objective, is well, whatever you want it to be. you can make awesome builds as some show in this sub, you can dig around and gather, you can fight hoards of enemies and numerous bosses, you can gather pets and mounts and other goodies of that nature.   I personally play it for the adventuring and fighting. I like the combat system of terraria, even if it is a little simple at times, but there is so much diversity it's insane. Working my way up to the big bad bosses of the game is enjoyable, and taking them down even more so. But, this is just me, it doesn't mean it's something you'd enjoy.  When it comes to the difficulty of the game, if you're new you may not know everything there is about this game and that can certainly make it harder. If you don't know how to fight a certain boss or at the very least prep for them, then you may not be able to beat them initially. The game gets even harder when you go into expert mode, in which even veteran players could struggle with (some of those fights are hard, such as expert skeletron).  When it comes to figuring out what you need to do to get started, there are some excellent walkthroughs and guides, as well as a plethora of videos on youtube (some recommended channels if you're curious include yrmir, gullofdoom and chippygaming). Also never be afraid to ask any questions, no matter how silly, there will always be someone who'd be happy to help."

Terraria,3e0gat,origamania,3,Tue Jul 21 00:46:34 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The start is a little slow as you progress through the ore tiers.  Then progression is more through boss fights.  Then back to some ore tiers, and then bosses / hard enemies.    You can build at any point and if you make some rooms in your house NPC's will move in and sell you things that might help you.    Digging helps you reach caves to explore and eventually down to the final layer of the map.  World height changes based on the size you pick... think it is ~1200, ~1800, ~2400 from top of sky to bottom of hell.  You can craft awsome loot, you find awsome loot, you can combine some of them.    Expert mode is hard.  Normal is easy by comparison."

Have you ever wanted to SORT your inventory by name, or id, or even type? Have you ever thought ""Gee, I wish there was a way to automatically trash all of this stuff like dirt that ill never want""? Well you're in luck. I've got just the mod for you.  Features:     Sort your inventory just how you want it. It will sort items by their type (Melee Weapon, Ranged Weapon, Potion, etc) in whatever order you choose. The default key is Z. Allow auto-trashing when you sort, or even whenever you pick up an item, if you so choose. You can specify what items the mod will do this with and then you will never have to worry about those items again(Unless you remove them from the list of course). (Enable automatic trashing with Shift + Z, disable the same way). Quicker stacking - Allows you to quick stack by simply hitting the hotkey (C by default). If you aren't in a chest it does quick stack to all nearby chests. Hotbar Swapping - With the touch of a button(X by default) you can easily swap the top row of your hotbar with the bottom row of your inventory. An option in the config allows you to cycle your hotbars instead, if you please. (Top hotbar goes to bottom row of the inventory, the rest of the rows go up by 1 row. Essentially giving you 5 easy to use hotbars.). Easy to manage configuration - The mod saves your sorting orders and other config in 2 files in your Documents/My Games/Terraria folder (IE Config.json, and Sorting Order.json), that you can very easily edit, or you can use the included application which can be launched in game(Left alt + o) to manage everything with a very easy to understand ui. No matter how you do it, the configuration can be reloaded on-the-fly by hitting left-shift and o.

Well, the melee bonus you're getting from the helmet is rather useless then, yes? similarly, your demon wings are giving you a melee speed increase, which, again, is not helping you. you have split your character between summoning, ranged, and melee, and in hardmode, that simply won't fly unless you are one of those players that is just very, very good at 2d platformer combat. As far as accessories go, your shackle and your obsidian shield aren't really doing you any favours WRT combat either - switch them out for something that increases damage, mobility, or defense.  see if you can craft the orichalcum (or better) helmet that gives ranged bonuses, and try to find some accessories that further boost ranged damage. also, watch some youtube videos of people defeating the various hardmode bosses - check their tactics, their combat style, do they fly in tight circles to stay in range? do they kite the boss across long platform runs? what gear are they using? are they supplementing with other items like molotovs? etc. etc."

Terraria,3dzb92,ScottP480,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to go small, goldfish -> fishtank, grinding lower level bosses will net you some platinums.  If you have a Slime Staff (or Statue) and lucky coin, you can build an ocean grinder for 25 platinum per hour with Spooky Armor. This is an auto-AFK farm. There are many builds on Youtube with this type of farm. HappyDays has a really simple build.  If you have a Skeleton Statue and a few flame traps (dart traps will also do), you can build an auto truffle worm farm. While this auto farm is designed to farm truffle worms automagically, you can also use it to farm loot and gold dropped by cavern layer mobs. ZeroGravitas has a guide (and sample map on Youtube) map on Youtube that you can study. There are many other types of automated hoic and trap powered farms that can be used to farm loot and gold, but most of them require way too many traps to function."
Terraria,3e05zn,iarefluffy,3,Mon Jul 20 23:02:49 2015 UTC,"Look for a spot in the hell area that does not have any towers.   Stuff tends to spawn in the towers and get stuck.  Ideally you would not see any towers on your minimap (as a rough guide at default zoom mobs can spawn just a little less than the minimap).    I like a flat area, but you may want some strategic walls for you to hide behind.  After you find a good spot between towers you also want to make sure no places to spawn above you.  If there is you may need to dig a path for whatever spawns to fall down to you.    Below your fighting path you may need to break blocks till it is solid lava or no space to spawn, so things spawn only on a path that can reach you.  Then you just kill things as they get on screen and you should get a lot more of each type.  Water candles from the dungeon increase spawns, one placed and holding one as your active item gives max benefit."

A lot of people say they're overpowered, as it takes the player 2-3 seconds to fire a fully charged shot, yet a Skeleton can do that in under a second. They're impossible to fight in water as the arrow knockback is more than the distance your character can swim, and Skeletons also have 'panic mode', which doubles their already hard to avoid firing speed up close. Consider that they do around 2 and a half hearts of damage and then add that to their 0.5 second firing speed makes them near impossible to melee without atleast chainmail."

Also use lava instead of dart traps as it will kill faster.  demize's ocean grinder should still work fine in 1.3.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad1Nu9pdWfk  If you're still in pre-HM, just farm EoC for money and you should be able to get at least 5 gold per kill + demonite ore to sell.

Terraria,3dzvgf,Thenaga,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:12 2015 UTC,"Seeing as there are no weapons that deal ""summoner"" damage, we are forced to improvise.  The piranha gun feels like a summoner themed weapon so I say yes! I personally like the Scourge of the Corrupter more, but to each their own."
Terraria,3dzvgf,BarkLicker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:09:41 2015 UTC,Piranha gun is ranged weapon and I would not consider it summoner weapon.
Terraria,3dzvgf,gnomoretears,2,Mon Jul 20 21:47:12 2015 UTC,"What would you consider a ""summoner weapon"" other than the minion staves?"
Terraria,3dzvgf,iSeven,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:53:00 2015 UTC,Terraria is a sandbox game so my rules only apply to my single player world. If you consider piranha gun as a summoner weapon then by all means use it.  To me a summoner class does damage using summons/minions so I would play a summoner as one that summons minions (using weapons classed as summoner weapon).  http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Summon_weapons  Some people like yrimir considers crimson and nimbus rods to be summoner weapons and he's used it in his summoner playthrough.
Terraria,3dzvgf,gnomoretears,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:19 2015 UTC,"I only ask because there's only so much you can do once you've summoned your minions, so most people use a second weapon, sometimes known as a ""secondary"" to add some more damage instead of sitting around letting their summons do everything."
Terraria,3dzvgf,iSeven,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:00 2015 UTC,"Plus, with the Stardust Dragon nerf, your minions will need all the help they can get."
Terraria,3dzvgf,SilverDeoxys563,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:06:54 2015 UTC,It was only nerfed for when you have a few segments.  When you have like 4+ it's back to normal damage.  Probably to make it less appealing to non-summoners.
Terraria,3dzvgf,TealHighwind,2,Tue Jul 21 05:48:43 2015 UTC,"I recommend magic weapons as your secondary. I main Mage with secondary summons/turrets. On my summoner I concentrate gear on summons while having magic as my secondary. Nothing is stopping you from doing the same with range as a secondary. Less damage, sure, but better than sitting around hoping your summons will take care of you."
Terraria,3dzvgf,-PM-ME-YOU-SMILING-,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:19:42 2015 UTC,"Like I said it's a sandbox game and unlike other games with character class, Terraria classes are not restricted to any specific type of weapons.  Piranha gun though a ranged weapon I can see the justification of treating it as a summoner weapon as it seems to shoot summoned ammo. It's fair game if you have no problem with it IMO."
Terraria,3dzvgf,gnomoretears,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"Not for high end, when some better ranged weapons comes, but for progress to farm hardmode dungeon, jungle piramid should work fine. Also imho it should be tetriary weapon, 1st just summons prefight, secondary stacionary minions, like frost hydra, moonlazor or discodiamond, and after that piranha or much better - some aoe bow, like stormbow or phantasm with endless quiver or ranged-melee weapon, like nyan-mere, starwrath, skyfury or seedler."
Terraria,3dzvat,DankTeddyBear,3,Mon Jul 20 21:42:01 2015 UTC,The first tier (Cobalt / Palladium) requires a Molten Pickaxe (crafted from Hellstone) or a Reaver Shark (fished from Ocean) to mine. The next tier requires a pick made out of the previous-tier hardmode ore; likewise for the last tier.

Terraria,3dzrln,twiz__,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:47 2015 UTC,"These kinds of statues will only spawn hearts/stars when there aren't too many already nearby.

Terraria,3dyvcd,thisisbleep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:48:58 2015 UTC,Verifying hasn't helped at all.  I get no error when I try to run the game. I get the loading icon on my mouse for about 30 seconds and then it goes away. I've also had open my task manager with the process tab open. When I watch this I see the Terraria.exe thinking for that time frame that the computer is loading then it is removed for active processes.  I can only think that something is interfering with the start up process of the application which stops Terraria from making any actual progress on launch. I might just hold out until Windows 10 comes out so I can work with a fresh set of updates. I am simply just exhausted on trying to figure this out the past few weeks.  Thanks for the help though! And help is good help at this point.

Terraria,3dy0lr,SoSweetAndTasty,3,Mon Jul 20 14:15:23 2015 UTC,This happens to me to. Either it is a bug or more likely there are a few hearts somewhere. The easiest fix for you would be to craft the summoning item using the fragments and then summoning him after a relog.

Like first eye of cthulu fight I did not have mana potions and can't shoot my staff anymore.  I kite around a bit picking up mana from the ground and getting some more shots in.   Eventually eye is a few shots from death and so am i.  No mana and no time to wait.  Switch to my backup boomerang and it ends up doing the last hit.

Terraria,3dzgr3,Xenokkah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:14 2015 UTC,"A.L.D.M.  A.L.D.M., or Automatic Lovecraftian Defense Mechanism, is a mechanical version of the Brain of Cthulhu. The music that plays during the encounter is the Martian Madness music. The boss boasts 20000 health (40000 on expert) and 30 defense, with contact damage of 30 (60 expert) in the first phase and 75 (90 expert) in the second. This boss has a chance of spawning on any night during hardmode before it has been defeated, heralded by the message ""Your head begins to throb..."" A.L.D.M. can only be summoned at night, and if day breaks before the boss is destroyed, it will immediately float away and despawn.  The first phase is very alike to the normal Brain of Cthulhu's fight. A.L.D.M., instead of simply being invincible, is surrounded by a forcefield that is very similar in appearance to the pillars' shields. Creepers are replaced with 20-30 Eyebots, which are mechanical eyes floating on jets. These Eyebots have no ranged attack, but do 40 contact damage (same on Expert) and have 300 max life (400 on Expert).  Upon death, the eyebots will drop 1-2 hallowed bars and 1-2 souls of dawn. In the first phase, the A.L.D.M. will function almost identically to the normal Brain of Cthulhu's first phase, teleporting  around and sending out its Eyebots to kill the player. In Expert, it also has a small mounted tesla cannon that will fire lightning bolts at nearby players. Shortly after all Eyebots are destroyed, the forcefield will rupture, inflicting nearby players with the Electrified debuff on Expert mode, and enter the second phase.  In the second phase, A.L.D.M.'s core will be exposed, a large mash of circuits, wires, and machinery. The boss will rapidly charge the player and is highly resistant to knockback. Being struck has a 50% chance to inflict the Electrified debuff on the player. As A.L.D.M. takes damage, it gains knockback resistance. At 25% health, A.L.D.M. will no longer take knockback. In Expert mode, the tesla turret continues to fire lightning bolts at nearby players. Throwing any water (holy, unholy, or blood) at A.L.D.M. during the second phase will do massive damage (500-1000) to the exposed electronics.  Upon death, A.L.D.M. will drop 5-10 hallowed bars and 5-10 souls of dawn, as well as a boss-specific drop. These drops can be found in the New Items section.    Fishing   Fishing Gear: 1 angler's earring, 1 high-test fishing line, and 1 tackle box at a tinkerer's workbench   Combines the effects of all of its components.   Lucky Angler's Hat: 1 angler's hat and 1 fishing gear crafted by hand   Combines the effects of the angler's hat and fishing gear. Resembles a normal angler's hat with hooks and lures around it.   Luminite Fishing Rod: 10 luminite bars, 2 of each fragment, and 3 truffle worms at an ancient manipulator   100% fishing power. Only way to catch lunar fish. Can fish in lava, but will only produce normal lava fish if not in a meteorite biome.  Lunar fish can only be found in a meteorite biome whilst fishing with a luminite rod.   Meteor Fish: Most common. Can be deconstructed at an anvil for 2-3 meteorite. Sunfish: Can be deconstructed at an ancient manipulator for 1 solar fragment. Resembles a miniature crawltipede. Starfish: Can be deconstructed at an ancient manipulator for 1 stardust fragment. Resembles a miniature flow invader. Xenofish: Can be deconstructed at an ancient manipulator for 1 vortex fragment. Resembles a miniature alien queen. Nebula Fish: Can be deconstructed at an ancient maniuplator for 1 nebula fragment. Resembles a miniature brain suckler. Moonfish: 1/50 chance per catch. Can be deconstructed at an ancient manipulator for 10-20 luminite. Resembles a miniature Moon Lord.   In addition, these fish can all be cooked into Heavenly Soup, providing an hour of Well Fed.    Theoretical Changelog   All monoliths now provide a 15% damage boost to the pillar they best represent as long as all viewers can see the monolith. Monoliths cannot stack, and turning one on will turn off all nearby ones. The Flying Dutchman now has 25000 health after all cannons are destroyed and is guaranteed to drop two new items upon death as well as 10-30 gold coins. The gravity globe now provides immunity to the Distortion debuff. Additionally, it can switch gravity even when not on a solid surface. Finally, it will negate all falling damage. The Hive Pack now affects the minions summoned by the Hornet Staff. Bosses will no longer pick up money in Expert mode. Enemies who are holding money in Expert mode will no longer despawn until after a 10-minute delay. Plantera's Bulb now has a unique icon on the map, similar to NPCs and pillars. The guide now offers tips about the Solar Eclipse, Lunar Events, and impending doom. Bee armor now has an additional effect to the set bonus - small swarms of bees will congregate around you and attack things you hit. The damage of these bees is affected by summoning damage modifiers. One can now choose between Crimson and Corruption at world start. Copper, iron, silver, and gold will generate in Normal worlds. Tin, lead, tungsten, and platinum will generate in Expert worlds. Crate and extractinator drops remain unaffected, as do hardmode ores. After defeating the Golem, a message will display in chat: ""The veil between worlds grows thin at the dungeon..."" Boss trophies now function similarly to banners, granting 20 more defense and 15% increased damage against the boss the trophy is from. The Cell Phone now plays a dialing sound when used rather than the magic mirror's sound. Fully grown plants not in bloom will enter bloom when the dryad's blessing reaches them and revert to normal growth after it fades. The mouse's thick edges can now be toggled and manipulated from the options menu. In multiplayer, you can now 'ping' a section of the map/minimap by alt-clicking it. This will play a sound and graphic on the map to all members of the same party before disappearing. You can now uncraft rope coils into their component rope by hand. Pressure plate explosive traps have been fully replaced with detonator traps. When the wearer of a Shield of Cthulhu takes damage that is less than 25% of their maximum health, they receive no knockback. Mechanical bosses have some new mechanics and drops in Expert mode. The mechanical cart pieces are no longer dropped and it must be crafted. Boss encounters will now show a health bar at the top of the screen. Skeletron Prime's arms are not counted as bosses. A mechanical Brain of Cthulhu, A.L.D.M., has been added, along with boss-specific drops. Many accessories can now be combined. The luminite fishing rod has been added, along with some new fish that can only be caught in a meteorite biome with the luminite rod. A Blood-Drenched Tablet can be crafted at an altar to summon a blood moon. The Flying Dutchman is now counted as a proper boss and has specific drops. An Ominous Skull can now be crafted to summon the dungeon guardian if Skeletron has been defeated. It is now possible to convert crimson seeds to corruption seeds (and vice versa) using polymorphic solution at an altar. Googly eyes have been added. The Daybreak now does throwing damage. Beetle husks no longer drop from the Golem boss and instead drop in groups of 5-10 from Derplings. Beetle armor is now focused around throwing weapons and is crafted with chlorophyte armor. The Sandstorm in a Bottle and Magic Carpet now spawn naturally in underground desert chests, as well as some unique loot. Crate loot is now determined immediately after being caught. Crates caught before this change will have loot determined when opened, similar to the old fashion. Hardmode throwing armor and weapons have been added."
Terraria,3duko0,itchylol742,65,Sun Jul 19 16:57:02 2015 UTC,"This is something 1.2 introduced, especially with regard to the weapons dropped by enemies in the dungeon (not to mention the Biome Keys), and to a ridiculous degree, the Pumpkin/Frost Moon events. It's unfortunate that Terraria took this grind-heavy approach to weapon progression, but due to the way world generation works, there isn't too much else they could do. I suppose they could add in more dynamically-generated ores (like the 3 hardmode ones, plus chlorophyte), but then even when I'm going for Titanium, I get impatient and just chug all the Spelunker Potions I've been holding onto.  Interestingly, 1.1 did it kind of differently: of course, there were still weapons to be made from Cobalt/Mythril/Adamantite, but there were also weapons to be made from Soul of Light/Night drops, which while more uncommon than they should have been (~1/7th chance I think), at least has an element of progress. That is, you can have something like 18 Souls and be excited that you're only two Souls away from crafting the item you want. Contrast this to the more prevalent design post-1.1, where things drop as themselves and there isn't that same sense of anticipation. For instance, there's no 1/10th of an Uzi/Magnet Sphere/Biome Key, so anticipation has been replaced with a dull grind, because you could get that item on your first kill, or your 1,347th."
Terraria,3duko0,94067,24,Sun Jul 19 17:18:09 2015 UTC,"It's still possible to have crafting without adding new ores. Instead of having a random chance drop from enemies, they could just have a guaranteed drop, and you need a specific number of them to craft an item. For example, having a skeleton sniper drop sniper parts and needing 10 of those to make a sniper rifle instead of just having a random drop. What I'm talking about is more about removing RNG from the loot system rather than using ores for progression."
Terraria,3duko0,Loyal2NES,45,Sun Jul 19 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"Frost Golems drop Frost Cores, used with Adam/Titan to make Frost Armor. Why more things don't do this I don't know."

Terraria,3duko0,Crov,2,Mon Jul 20 03:33:52 2015 UTC,"You get knives from the Crimson dungeon chests at a 100% chance but the key to open them is only a .04 (1/2500) chance to drop from creatures in the Crimson biome. You can't use them pre-plantera, either, the keys won't open the chests. On top of that you have to find the chest in the dungeon. So it might take a bit."
Terraria,3duko0,SoftwareShogun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:00:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I know about the keys. That is also what annoys me. There are these cool weapons but you can only really get them by setting up a farm and waiting hours and hours. I have gotten a hallow key mild(pre-1.3) and a Ice key randomly.
Terraria,3duko0,SilverDeoxys563,97,Mon Jul 20 04:08:00 2015 UTC,"The Moon Lord drops Luminite, which is still crafting.  The Pillars drop Fragments, which are used with an Ancient Manipulator as a crafting station to make the endgame weapons.  To an extent, though, you're right. Most of the weapons (except the Vortex weapons) I'm using are drops. Didn't notice."
Terraria,3duko0,DoomZero755,32,Sun Jul 19 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"The Pillars drop Fragments, which are used with an Ancient Manipulator as a crafting station to make the endgame weapons.   No, uhh, those aren't the endgame weapons that OP was talking about. Maybe it's less noticeable for rangers, but for mages, the problem is super evident.  The final boss drops for mages are far superior to the nebula weapons. The Nebula Blaze is somewhat useful, but I don't even carry the Nebula Arcanum. The Last Prism basically destroys everything that I have a direct line of sight to, while the Lunar Flare can hit anything I don't have a direct line of sight to. Meanwhile the Nebula Blaze is crazy inaccurate, costs high mana, and rarely one-hit kills an enemy.  The Pillars might drop fragments which make the second-best weapons, but if you want the absolute best weapons (for mages), you have to farm the Moon Lord.  So, in regards to OP's suggestion, I fully agree with them. RNG weapon drops are annoying and I would greatly prefer crafting materials.

Terraria,3duko0,jc191,9,Mon Jul 20 00:18:22 2015 UTC,"The binomial formula.  It's worth noting also that, despite being downvoted, the expected number of axes recieved after 200 plantera kills is 1, as u/Xantoxu points out."
Terraria,3duko0,TeamFluff,-2,Mon Jul 20 00:48:35 2015 UTC,"How do you define ""expected number of axes""? It's only expected after 200 kills if you subscribe to the gambler's fallacy."
Terraria,3duko0,Tetragen,6,Mon Jul 20 01:53:24 2015 UTC,"Averages and lots and lots of statistics. Killing Plantera gives you a 1 in 200 chance, but that doesn't mean it's guaranteed to give it to you in 200. I got mine in around 15, but some people might (theoretically) never get it, even after 400+.  To get said numbers basically you have a bunch of really dedicated people fight Plantera, Skeletons, Eye of Cthulhu, etc. a set LARGE number of times and gather up the results. In Plantera's case the Axe dropped an average of 1 out of every 200 kills, even if one person go it after 1 kill and someone else got it after 1000 kills.  Edit: This is how I understand it, I'm not a statistician though."
Terraria,3duko0,fernsauce,3,Mon Jul 20 03:21:00 2015 UTC,"Expectation is a statistical term. If you repeated this experiment a lot, and counted up how many axes you got and divided it by the number of times you killed 200 Planteras, it would come out to (approximately) 1. The average 'yield' of killing 200 Planteras is thus one axe.  Of course, you can kill Plantera any number of times and still not get an item. The expectation isn't that relevant here, since nobody is farming multiple axes, they just want to get one, so what matters is the distribution of how long it takes to get your axe."
Terraria,3duko0,UnluckyLuke,0,Mon Jul 20 07:32:04 2015 UTC,Then maybe don't subscribe to a fallacy
Terraria,3duko0,Dawnofdusk,4,Mon Jul 20 09:30:58 2015 UTC,"Pretend you roll 200 dice, each die with 200 sides. If we want only 1 die to show 200, the probability is 1/200 (probability on the first die to show 200) times 199/200 (probability of not showing 200 for the second die) times 199/200 (probability of not 200 for the third die) times 199/200, etc. 199 more times. This accounts for the rest of the 199 dice (first die shows 200, the rest show anything else).  1/200 * (199/200)199  The answer to this is 0.0018 or 0.18%. Definitely not equal to 36%. This is because we calculated the odds of getting 200 on the first die roll, and then any other number on every other die roll. In reality we don't care which die gets 200, just that only one of them does. Thus, multiply this answer by 200 because there are 200 possible combinations that would satisfy us (that is, 1st dice is 200 rest are not, 2nd dice is 200 rest are not... up until 200th dice is 200 rest are not).  1/200 * (199/200)199 * 200= about 0.36 or 36% (actually it's more like 37% when you round)  For any arbitrary number n it's more complicated, but the idea is the same.  (1/200)n * (199/200)200-n * 200 choose n"

Terraria,3duko0,Kirudra,2,Mon Jul 20 00:01:49 2015 UTC,Could you explain to me how you got your numbers? Took a stats class a few years ago but forgot everything haha.
Terraria,3duko0,TeamFluff,4,Sun Jul 19 23:55:08 2015 UTC,"Sure. First, to be more exact, I should say:   '1 in 200' odds maths down to a 50% chance of getting at least one in 139 kills. The probability of getting at least one in 200 kills is 63.3%   It's easiest to think about from the losing side, as explained here. This leads to a general equation of p=1-(1-c)n, where p is the probability for the event to happen at least once, c is the chance for the event to happen, and n is the number of attempts.  If you want to do it the other way (find how many attempts are necessary for a certain percentage), you can flip it around. I'd write it out, but it requires a log with a non-standard base, so it'd look weird. I don't think LaTeX is enabled on the Terraria subreddit."
Terraria,3duko0,Kirudra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:56 2015 UTC,Yep i remember it all now. Thanks! I kept thinking (1/200)200 and that's just an abysmally low number. Forgot you go the other way. :P
Terraria,3duko0,biomatter,2,Mon Jul 20 01:28:36 2015 UTC,"The way I've taught myself is that you can do the odds against the drop (199/200) to the power of the number of times you've ran the event (in this case Plantera kills) to figure out what the chance of you NOT getting one was. So (199/200)200 = 0.36, so the chance of NOT getting one in 200 boss kills is 36%.  Edit: The Story Continues: To go the other way, let's say you want to know how many times you'd have to kill him to have a 75% chance of getting the drop. We have to use logs (which I still don't really understand, but they're a way to remove exponentiation I guess) in the form of log(base event chance)%SearchingFor. Ok, sorry about that, words are hard, but it works out to log(0.25) / log(199/200). I use '0.25' because again, we are searching for odds against this event happening. It comes out to roughly 277 Plantera kills to have a 75% of getting the Axe.  If anyone else sees this, please double check my math, and if you have a more eloquent way of explaining it please chime in! I'm not mathy-mathy."
Terraria,3duko0,Dawnofdusk,4,Mon Jul 20 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"To add on, the reason you use logs like that is because you want to solve the equation (199/200)x = 0.25. x is the number of times you have to defeat Plantera to have a 25% chance of not getting The Axe (thus a 75% chance of getting at least one). Because log is the inverse of exponents, take the log of both sides (you can use whatever base log we'll just use base 10 which is just log).   log( (199/200)x ) = log(0.25).   Log rules tells us that log( ab ) is equivalent to b*log(a) so this equation simplifies to x*log(199/200)=log(0.25). Divide both sides by log(199/200) and you get x = log(0.25) / log(199/200). Plug that in to your calculator (unless you can evaluate logs in your head...) and you get ~75%."
Terraria,3duko0,biomatter,3,Mon Jul 20 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Yeah yeah yeah. I found logs when I was asking myself how to solve for x when x was an exponent. That's exactly the formula I was trying to deconstruct last week. I figured it out, but not without some mystery. Thanks for solving the rest of that work - Wolfram wouldn't give me more info without a subscription >_> I use the program 'Eigenmath' to do complex math on my computer, FYI. Nifty program. And your whole equation evaluates to 276.565 (Plantera kills required for 75% drop chance)."
Terraria,3duko0,Kirudra,3,Mon Jul 20 01:23:27 2015 UTC,Thanks all for your explanation. It's all coming back to me. Forgot that you have to go backwards. Logs are a thing of the past for me haha.

I must have gotten incredibly lucky then, just got the axe last night when I accidentally broke a bulb transforming my jungle into the mushroom biome, to make finding truffle worms easier...  I actually prefer the Stardust Cell staff to the dragon. The Dragon does better damage, but I've found the cells are a much better support summon, as they tend to not like to travel too far away from you, actively slow anything on screen down, and consistently apply additional DPS to whatever you're targeting.  I also really love the Phantasm with full Shroomite and the magic quiver (haven't beaten the lunar boss yet, working on that), I thought it was less than stellar at first, but as soon as I started actually hitting things that didn't die instantly to a volley, man, the secondary triggered rush of homing mini arrows quickly makes it insane when you can keep on target."

Terraria,3duko0,IllogicalMind,-2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"Why would the Endgame weapons be craft without being drop? I mean, you already beat the game. You have proven to be the best and overcome the Moon Lord, you can beat it as much times as you need to get all the Weapons. But in order to defeat him, you NEED to craft your go-to weapons before fighting him."
Terraria,3duko0,DoomZero755,8,Sun Jul 19 23:37:35 2015 UTC,"You have proven to be the best and overcome the Moon Lord, you can beat it as much times as you need to get all the Weapons   That's pretty flawed logic actually. I mean, consider the following scenario: A player fights the Moon Lord, barely surviving and dodging a fatal blow on more than one occasion, finally beating the boss only for it to drop a weapon belonging to one of the three classes they did not specialize in. With nine weapons, two for each class plus an extra melee weapon, you only have a 22%/33% chance of actually becoming more powerful after that fight.   I mean, the armor is a huge boost in power, so for the first few fights, you're making progress anyway, because you'll be able to craft your class's armor and the weapons don't necessarily need to belong to your class. Once you've got the armor (which would probably take two moon lord kills), then the playing field will even out. But that really doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to farm for the weapons with any sort of ease. Once you have the weapons you want, then you can farm the Moon Lord more easily, but if you have usable weapons, you wouldn't really need to farm the fight except for completionism (which is something I ended up doing, actually).  I dunno. I feel like the case I'm presenting isn't as strong as I'd like it to be, so I'll switch tracks a little.  Basically, I don't think any drops should be left up to RNG, except for the number of materials that are dropped. When you introduce RNG, there are winners and losers for an entirely non-skill based reason. Some people ""win"" because they get exactly what they want without having to farm, while some people ""lose"" because they have to farm endlessly in order to get what they want, and there's nothing skill-based about it. You're saying ""it's okay for things to be RNG-based drop from the Moon Lord because you've already beaten the game by that point and you can do it again"", but I feel like that's only a justification (and for only one particular boss's loot anyway), and it doesn't really give a good reason. If there was a compelling reason for RNG-based loot, then I probably wouldn't be so frustrated by it, but I don't see it so I'm just frustrated."
Terraria,3duko0,IllogicalMind,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:37:22 2015 UTC,"Well I have 3 armors and the accessories for them don't really change much (aside from Emblems and the class upgrades for Avenger's Emblem), so if I get the ""wrong"" weapon I'll just use it with my other armor. If people farm for Rod of Discord, they can farm for the 3 post-Golem armors. Or at least two. For example I made the Spectre armor (it was lots of fun grinding Ectoplasms at the Dungeon) but since I was struggling with it, I crafted the Shroomite armor (which I'm used to it naturally). Since I wanted to try the Daybreak weapon I crafted (it came Godly, lucky!) I went to the jungle to get the missing Turtle Shell (I had two already). The later happened today, like, 3 hours ago. And if you get the materials to make the armor, I think that's a start. I don't think you're supposed to beat the boss with low HP, and if you do, you already know its tricks and you should know how to dodge its attacks. At least this was how I beat the Lunatic Cultist for the first time, after dying two times."

On the one hand you could get lucky and drop it, but you will always feel in control knowing ""in x kills I can just craft this so it's no biggie."""
Terraria,3duko0,Fitmit_12,10,Sun Jul 19 21:55:23 2015 UTC,"I can understand dealing with the Moon lord just to get a certain drop. It took me about 30 kills to get all the items, and the last kill was the Meowmere. I got quite a bit of Star wraths, and they were good with some of the pillars because I didn't have the Prism/Terrarian. But there's so many different items, how would a few crafting materials be used to make all these unique items? I guess something like Moon lord fragments where a certain number can make any of the weapons.   I've played games where grinding is just what makes the game, and I have time for that, but then again, some people probably don't. Considering that you need to spend about 5 - 10 minutes for each pillar if you only have pre-Moon lord weapons, it is a struggle trying to kill them. And with 1.3.0.5, you can get enough fragments to make 2 sigils, thank god(Moon Lord?) for that.  In the end, if you don't get what you want, you could always make something neat out of Luminite bricks :P"

Terraria,3duko0,tlh053,7,Sun Jul 19 20:09:19 2015 UTC,"I think the best solution would be a combination of both.    For example, let's say the boss had 10 items it could occasionally drop plus a guaranteed drop of a random amount of crafting material between certain values.    Then that crafting material could be used to craft the drops that you don't get. Though I think vanity items like trophies and masks should probably always stay as rare drops.   And I also think that making sure you have to farm the boss 3-4 times per item wouldn't be too bad either  Keep it guaranteed after a certain amount of kills while also leaving in the option of getting really lucky with your drops.    Although I will say that I don't really care for them to change it now after the fact.  I'm just saying this now for future reference.  Maybe Terraria 2 or otherworld or something."

Terraria,3duko0,SasparillaTango,12,Sun Jul 19 22:21:50 2015 UTC,"Probably MMO-itis.  RNG gives you more reason to farm a boss.  ""I really want X so I'll keep killing the same boss to get it.""

Terraria,3duko0,DoomZero755,6,Mon Jul 20 08:13:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I got the terrarian on my first moon lord bag, never saw it again, and had so much frustration trying to get the rainbow crystal staff and star wrath, I'm pretty sure I have about 10 meowmeres sitting around. I mean I wish more weapons were craftable too after transitioning to hardmode, I like the feeling of crafting a new weapon, like I remember when I first crafted my megashark."
Terraria,3duko0,biomatter,20,Sun Jul 19 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"OP, I agree so much. I'm so glad somebody made a post about this, because it's something that's been burning in my mind since the addition of Plantera. I mentioned this in another post in this thread but I'll say it again just to make my point in this post. Back in 1.2.4, the drop chance for The Axe (also known as the current best Hamaxe) was ""1 in 200"", meaning ""if you fight Plantera 200 times, and you are as lucky as the average person, you should get one of The Axe."" I used tEdit to place 200 plantera bulbs all in one spot, and then fought Plantera 200 times in a row. That's not even counting the times I fought it before then. In 200 (+ maybe 20 natural plantera kills), I never once got The Axe. So then I used an inventory editor to give myself The Axe. I don't consider myself a cheater. I put in the same amount of effort as the average player and I still didn't have an item that, on average, players should have by then.  So, I agree, it's incredibly frustrating that there are so many RNG-based loot drops. It's not the right answer to ""how do we make this weapon hard to obtain?"" I'm certain there are people out there who obtained The Axe on their very first Plantera kill, without even knowing what it was. To those people, assuming they never look up the weapon and hear about the trouble so many other people go through, the weapon isn't even rare. They just see it as a really cool item. And that's fucked up. RNG-based loot drops forces some people go through massive trouble to get an item while their friends might get it on the first try.  What bothers me the most is that the devs knew that RNG drops were not a good idea because they changed the banner system. If you beat an enemy 50 times, you get its banner. That removes the chance from it. Now you know exactly how much effort it takes to get a banner, and if you have the tally counter, you know exactly how far along you are. So, why didn't they apply this to everything? Why didn't they make every rare drop follow this formula? The Axe now drops with a 1 in 50 chance after beating Plantera. But why not make it guaranteed to drop after the 50th kill? If the average player fights Plantera 50 times in a row and gets one The Axe, just make it guaranteed to drop after the 50th kill. That way everybody takes the same amount of time to get it, and there are no assholes saying ""I got it on my first kill. It wasn't that hard."" Like, fuck you. I aaaaaaaain't havin' that shit."
Terraria,3duko0,DoomZero755,3,Sun Jul 19 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"I know people mentioned it further up, but I just want to reiterate - a 1/200 drop rate means in 200 kills you only have a 63% of getting it. That's weaker than winning two coin flips, so it isn't that crazy. I still agree with the message, though :)"
Terraria,3duko0,biomatter,4,Mon Jul 20 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, I saw that post, yes.  Except, I think it supports my point even further? I mean, it certainly explains why I didn't get The Axe after 200 kills, but it also means that the average amount of kills required for The Axe is actually more than 200. And that's total BS. I mean, they did improve the drop rate, but it still shouldn't be that way."
Terraria,3duko0,DoomZero755,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:40:41 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah, I know what you mean. Pre-buff it took 277 kills to have a 75% - and you could STILL lose two coin flips and not get it.... :P"
Terraria,3duko0,pickten,0,Mon Jul 20 00:43:22 2015 UTC,"it took 277 kills to have a 75%   *shakes head*  this game sometimes...  Well, at least that particular item's drop chance has been buffed.  And then there's the Pirate Invasion's loot..."
Terraria,3duko0,nswa22,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:55:45 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned elsewhere, the average amount is still 200. (well 50 but whatever) Each kill, your expected number of Axes is 0.005, so the average number of kills until the expected value is one (i.e. the expected number of kills you need) is 1/0.005=200. This may sound like BS, but this is correct math.  Doesn't excuse the low chance, but still."

Terraria,3duko0,cheekiestNandos,2,Mon Jul 20 17:36:22 2015 UTC,"I knew they increased the drop chance for it and I got it on my second Plantera kill in a new world, but I thought it was around 10%, not only 2%."
Terraria,3duko0,chunes,4,Sun Jul 19 21:22:43 2015 UTC,"In game theory RNG drops emulate a way of obtaining content without actually having to add a clever way to obtain it. I'm not calling the devs lazy as it's a staple to certain game genres but I have to agree with OP on this one, it's not the part of the game I enjoyed playing.  For boss trophies, fine I like that incentive but not for game progressing gear."
Terraria,3duko0,MushroomDynamo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:15:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. I had a lot of fun recently gathering the materials to craft a rainbow rod.

Just recently I've started a new expert world with my buddy and preparing for bosses then fighting them is soo much fun.  But I feel like there should be something that adds more replayabillity to terraria, perhaps a New-game+ option? How would this work:  You start new game with your current items, but on new-game plus they're as weak as your starting weapons would be because of how powerfull enemies are now. To make this more enjoyable, each time you pass the game and unlock the New game ++ enemies are EVEN harder, so you have to come up with new strategies each time you playthru. (Of course everything on new-game plus scales accordingly to how powerful monsters are. i.e a copper sword would do like ~70 damage)  This would be really cool, you could put a leaderboard and see who reached the highest new-game plus.  Because as of right now, I really don't care about the moon-lord drops. Why? Because they wont be used at all."
Terraria,3duko0,flamedance58,3,Mon Jul 20 02:04:03 2015 UTC,"Whenever I see ""Rare drop from..."" I just stop worrying about it. I just hate grinding so much I won't even try."
Terraria,3duko0,Nekro-Byte,2,Mon Jul 20 00:44:42 2015 UTC,"I personally don't mind one way or the other since in my opinion getting a specific drop I wanted sooner or later doesn't mean anything as once you have it you're then in the position of ""now what"" regardless, but I will say that I agree with your idea to an extent.  I think the next logical progression in your weaponry should be a mix of both RNG and crafting, but I feel that anything considered by the developers to be ""optional"" should remain as they are. Example: Mixed system for main weapons on Moon Lord, but something like ""The Axe"" from Plantera is 100% RNG as it isn't a necessary drop and is purely optional to your playthrough. Slime Staff remains 100% RNG (Since you're not intended to be a Summoner until later in the game, just like you're not intended to be a Gunner until later in the game), etc.  This way people can craft what they need, but still have something random out there that's nice when it finally pops up, especially if it's better than what you could craft at the time - which is something I think some people don't realize is important to have in a game as well. I noticed some people think it's a bad thing, but it really isn't at all. Having a rare drop be better than what you can get at that ""tier"" is the point of it being a rare drop. It's a nice treat if you're lucky enough to stumble across it. The only time it's bad is when that rare drop is the only actual upgrade to what you're supposed to be using. (Not pointing this at anybody in particular by the way, just noticed some people seem to think having a rare drop be better than what is craftable at that point is inherently bad)"
Terraria,3duko0,flamedance58,2,Mon Jul 20 03:28:20 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the World of RNG! Most games, especially RPGs, and others have a lot of RNG. Though it's annoying it's better to get used to it since it's such a common thing."
Terraria,3duko0,Nekro-Byte,2,Mon Jul 20 03:42:40 2015 UTC,"Except most games allow you to buy or craft the majority of weapons, armors, etc. with only a handful of equipment that are genuinely rare and require farming or some obscure method to obtain them. There are simply too many items in Terraria for so many to have a low drop chance. All that does is artificially extend the game's lifespan; which for a primarily single-player experience makes very little sense."
Terraria,3duko0,flamedance58,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:39:38 2015 UTC,Well terraria imo is more of a cooptional game. Where you play solo and/or with friends.  Either way the game is pretty much 99% done development so the RNG we got isn't going anywhere.
Terraria,3duko0,Nekro-Byte,0,Mon Jul 20 08:24:54 2015 UTC,"cooptional   Is that supposed to be a new word? Or did you misspell ""cooperative""? Anyway, the addition of major content patches might be done but altering the drop rates isn't something that would take much effort or time."
Terraria,3duko0,Judge_Hellboy,2,Mon Jul 20 11:04:35 2015 UTC,"You were raising the idea of making more things craftable so I was thinking you meant just pulling 'em from drop tables period and making them craftable. My mistake on that.  ""Cooptional"" is a term that was coined by TotalBiscuit for the podcast he does. He explained once that the term to him means it's where you can play co-op or y'know not. Sorta like in games like Battleblock Theatre where you can help or screw over the other players."
Terraria,3duko0,chunes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:10:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it still wouldn't take much time or effort to make them craftable unless they decide to add new items that you have to acquire in order to craft them. It would be nice but honestly, I would settle for drop rates that are not so abysmal for the average weapon, accessory, etc.     Ah, well, I don't watch or listen to TotalBiscuit but that seems like a bit of a silly term to use to describe Terraria since if you're playing with others, your only choice is to assist them. I suppose you could grief them or stand around and mooch off boss kills but that's not exactly ""co-optional' gameplay."
Terraria,3duko0,Dudeguy2121ICW,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:27 2015 UTC,"Well in the case of the Moon Lord all items obtained from him are not needed for progression.  You've killed him, progression has ended.  Now you get efficient with farming him till you get the random item you want.  Though some underlying system to protect against bad RNG would be nice.  If game kept track of how many times you killed a boss, say every 10 kills it could force drop something it hasn't yet. (Would change based on enemy and rarity of item.)"
Terraria,3duko0,Zerosiz,2,Mon Jul 20 03:54:42 2015 UTC,"Anyone else remember when the devs introduced RNG to weapon damage? There was a huge uproar, and I'm not sure it was misplaced. RNG has crept into more aspects of the game ever since."

Terraria,3duko0,Legoblockhead,2,Mon Jul 20 08:48:54 2015 UTC,"RNG really does make the game less rewarding. The end game weapons should've had huge crafting recipes like the Terra blade or the Drill Containment Unit. Better yet, they do that with the weapons from the pillars and have them require items that drop from all the monsters in those pillar biomes, similar to unicorn horns and pixie dust. This would make them more of biomes than things in your way of killing moon lord."

Terraria,3dzddx,Badger_Janzen,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:40 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's why you should go there after going to the jungle and the dungeon    one gear that would make it easier would be meteor armor + space gun, it's one of the best pre-hardmode combo"
Terraria,3dzddx,Amer_Faizan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:46 2015 UTC,Try the underground jungle. Look for a beehive and fight the queen bee a couple times. Have you found any meteorite?
Terraria,3dygiq,Grai_M,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:42 2015 UTC,"If you would like to stay where you are, you could surround your base in a sort of barrier of wood blocks, 4 wide to keep the spread from reaching you. Or since your base looks like it already reaches up kinda high, you could probably make a sweet sky base. It would be right there and easy to move your stuff."
Terraria,3dygiq,Amazin_Raisin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:23 2015 UTC,"Being off the ground is a great idea since the wraiths can't fly upwards (and they're kind of super annoying). 7 or so blocks off the ground (you can still put walls if you want it to look like a supported structure).   As mentioned by Amazin_Raisin, you can put up barriers to prevent biomes from spreading, but the Hallow will not cause your NPCs to move out so in this case it only matters for aesthetics and deadliness. Your base is very basic (pun!) though, so it might be a good time to move to a new and fancier location. For inspiration, there's a more or less continuous stream of screenshots submitted to this sub, so look around for ideas maybe. o:"

Terraria,3dxw2m,thalinox,2,Mon Jul 20 14:10:24 2015 UTC,The idea of actuated single blocks infront of doors is a good idea but sometimes it's good they can move around. I find that it's better if the NPCs are on the same or several floors with just doors seperating them all. Why? So that in situations where they have to fight they can all move around and help eachother fight off mobs that go through walls or teleport in. Otherwise your NPCs are forced to fight solo and might end up dying anyways.

Don't worry about dying, if you're concerned about losing money then put it in a chest. The safest way to move is restricting yourself to the forest surface and raiding the chests you find there then exploring the caves in the same area for ore and more chests avoiding going too deep (music changes as you go deeper underground)."
Terraria,3dz5o2,BusybeeZZB,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:21:59 2015 UTC,"Here is a walkthrough on the wiki.  In my opinion, this is what I would do: Go find some caves underground, and mine the ores. You can use them to upgrade your gear (better weapons and armor).  If you want a more in depth guide, I'd be happy to provide it for you (just pm me) but for now that should be your next step I'd say."
Terraria,3dz5o2,pulchernator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:40 2015 UTC,"Git gud.    Fight some stuff and raid some surface chests. Then go deeper. You will need to make some armor weapons and tools from mining, but you will find a lot of unique items. Once you find items that help you get around it gets easier and more fun.

Terraria,3dufs9,BarkLicker,5,Sun Jul 19 16:23:05 2015 UTC,Would this be better than the asphalt block?
Terraria,3dufs9,Spankinator92,7,Sun Jul 19 18:18:01 2015 UTC,"MUCH better. Asphalt block only brings you to a speed of 53 mph, but using the portal gun brings you to 179 mph. That's a difference of approximately loads.  And, of course, frozen slime blocks only preserve your speed, so once you reach top speed (whether from running on asphalt or falling with a portal gun), you should move onto frozen slime blocks.  edit: I kinda wish sloped frozen slime blocks converted your vertical momentum into horizontal momentum. That would be really neat. Like, you wouldn't even need to use portals, you could just hold the portal gun and fall onto a sloped frozen slime block and you'd have speed for days. *sigh* Yep. That'd be cool."
Terraria,3dufs9,jwapplephobia,4,Sun Jul 19 19:55:42 2015 UTC,"Asphalt max speed is influenced by your speed bonuses, I tried with every possible bonus (sunflower, quick accessories, food, potions) and the cap speed seems to be 85 mph."

Terraria,3dusth,janitorforilluminati,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:35 2015 UTC,"Basically, yeah. But I didn't dig until the very end, because of the water. I didn't want to 'flood' the hell, so once I started seeing the hell background I stopped digging. I also built very small houses and placed a bed on each, so that I could teleport back home without having to climb all the way back up."
Terraria,3dusth,Nematrec,15,Sun Jul 19 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"You can't flood hell, I'm not 100% familiar with the mechanics but I've dug massive lakes into hell and they disappear. I don't think water can exist in hell."
Terraria,3dusth,OverlandObject,18,Sun Jul 19 21:06:15 2015 UTC,Yeah it's not possible anymore.  I recently got back into terraria after a long break and tried to flood hell and the water just seemed to evaporate over time.
Terraria,3dusth,PwmEsq,5,Sun Jul 19 21:14:25 2015 UTC,"Water can exist in hell, but it basically evaporates very quickly. As in, if you create a pool, you can watch the water level continue to drop until the water simply disappears. But it exists long enough to create obsidian walkways on the lava below you so you don't fall in and die. I flood parts of hell I plan to make my WoF arena so incase I get knocked off the bridge I'm building, I don't fall in the lava and die."
Terraria,3dusth,TangledAxile,5,Mon Jul 20 00:22:30 2015 UTC,"If you create a large enough body of water (larger than the oceans) and then use dynamite to flood caves below, you can break the water physics simulation. It'll eventually just say, fuck this, and all the water will mysteriously vanish. Or so you think. So I thought. Then I went to hell. It turns out, it just stalls the physics, and calculates the end result. For me, because I had opened a pathway to it, that was half of hell flooded with bodies of water. They were static, non-evaporating. I had to force them to evaporate by disturbing them."

Terraria,3dv65a,PwmEsq,8,Sun Jul 19 21:57:54 2015 UTC,The real painful part is how both of them do about half the damage of the equivalent magic and ranged weapons.
Terraria,3dv65a,Derised,5,Mon Jul 20 00:37:22 2015 UTC,"I still go melee in expert mode, I'm just not good enough to survive otherwise. One way to think of it is that balancing after moon lord doesn't matter there isn't anything else to fight. Also the nebula blaze imo isn't that great id prefer the eruption over it."
Terraria,3dv65a,PwmEsq,2,Mon Jul 20 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"I love and hate nebula blaze, it's one of the only real single target spells and has decent damage, but still really doesn't deal enough to counter Razorblade Typhoon. I guess you could count in the fact that it's super blast is double damage and chance to critical is quad damage, but... 20% chance on top of (my average) 28% chance?

Terraria,3dv65a,PhantokTheFencer,7,Mon Jul 20 11:38:50 2015 UTC,The DoT seems rather overvalued. It should have an explosion effect like Solar Eruption (possibly scaling with how many spears are impaled in the target?)
Terraria,3dv65a,Deoxysprime,5,Sun Jul 19 22:44:35 2015 UTC,That would be great. More times you hit it the more damage you do. Gives it an edge to solar eruption in boss fights.

Terraria,3dv65a,pooppick,4,Mon Jul 20 12:31:53 2015 UTC,It is useful for single target dot damage that stacks.
Terraria,3dv65a,PwmEsq,8,Sun Jul 19 20:21:56 2015 UTC,Stacks to about 100 damage 8 times per second meaning the eruption still does more to single target

Terraria,3dv65a,PwmEsq,4,Mon Jul 20 07:22:36 2015 UTC,My suggestion was that it needs an effect like the north pole which I want it to rain fire letting it keep its dps
Terraria,3dv65a,Tetragen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"I dunno, seems to defeat the purpose of it's single target thing, might as well just use the Eruption anyway then. Perhaps some kind of increasing DoT? Such as increasing the total DoT damage by the number of spears.  Ex: Each spear gives +10% more to the total DoT damage meaning you end with +70% total damage over time. Should give something around 1,300 DoT damage to a single target."
Terraria,3dv65a,PwmEsq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:08:11 2015 UTC,I'm not saying get rid of single target this is just some low damage effects per se so it isn't so bland as a final weapon I mean it's the same as the low level javelins in though but with no ammo and more dots
Terraria,3dv65a,Slurrpin,4,Mon Jul 20 10:35:50 2015 UTC,"Reduce the range, reduce the base damage, reduce the DoT per spear, increase the number of spears that can stack significantly pers target, only allow spears to stack on a limited number of targets before fading (Switch targets, spears start dropping), allow the weapon to do increased damage with successive spear hits. Would reward single target focus and successive hits to the same targets. Eruption is an unparalleled skirmish and exploration tool. Make the Daybreak a boss killer."

Without yoyo bag, 6.8-9k.  (using destroyer emblem & fire gauntlet with full solar gear, godly prefix terrarian)."

Terraria,3dv65a,danjo3197,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:24 2015 UTC,"Someone should compare Daybreak to the North pole, the North Pole may potentially be able to out dps it if the snowflakes are lined up right"
Terraria,3dv65a,Fenriradra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:12:57 2015 UTC,"Eruption depends on how close/far you are from it.  Closer to it = more hits per swing.  As opposed to max range where you'll get maybe 1 or 2 hits.  Single target dummy standing on top of it I can maintain 3000-3200.  Max range I can maybe get around 1200-1300. (this not including the extra ticks of 25 it applies but doesn't stack).  Daybreak in the same exact gear, the DPS meter reads out 1100-1200 consistently, but it doesn't seem to factor in the extra 800/sec from full stacks of the debuff.  Moral of the story:  Eruption is great for multiple targets, and situationally great for targets you will stay close to.  Daybreak is better for any targets you'll be fighting consistently from a distance.  As the majority of bosses you'll be trying to maintain a moderate distance from any way, and their limited amount of targets, it's big advantage only comes then from being able to pierce blocks - Daybreak should be able to kill the thing faster."
Terraria,3dv65a,H0lley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:25 2015 UTC,"has almost the same reach as daybreak   absolutely not true. Daybreak has a much greater reach, which can for example be used to damage bosses while keeping a save distance. however, it will most definitely be replaced with better weapons you get from the Moon Lord, while nothing can replace the Solar Eruption's block piercing ability."

This is NOT OFFICIAL, and is just me telling a story of what could have happened (in my world, anyway).  -GAMEPLAY SPOILERS MAY BE IN THE TEXT BELOW-  The story goes as follows... There are four champions, representing the four classes and four final tier armorsets.   Jona: The Dragonwrath mystic (Summoner)  Erica: The Nebula Magus (Mage)  Bradley: The Chrono Marksman (Ranger)  Raybrandt: The Sunfire Paladin (Warrior)   All four scoured the land, defending the land from evil, slaying the vicious hordes of darkness, returning to the hall for respite and debauchery..  Unfortunately, they ultimately fail to defeat the ultimate evil, the moon lord. The player, with an unknown past or future, then spawns within the land, with noone but the player to hold back the forces that were once kept in check.

The way you explained your strategy makes it sound like you are mostly fighting by moving vertically, which normally wouldn't cause you to go far enough from the ocean to enrage him, but perhaps you weren't aware of this change. Honestly, to me it was quite natural to move pretty far from the ocean when fighting him, for the sake of dodging his attacks and whatnot, but now the space you can use is more limited. Perhaps your difficulties are due to unintentionally enraging him, because I assume he becomes much harder to defeat in that state (I have not tried myself)."

The basic ""arena"" setup i went with that made life nice and easy, was a single ""super platform"" (very long platform) that spanned from the coast, all the way to the edge of the world, up over the water. Then, scattered a bit (25+ tiles apart) i'd put down a heart statue, a star statue, a campfire, and a heart lantern. the statues were all connected to a single 1 second timer using just 1 wire colour. when i'd reach the low point in the flying circle, i'd fly by a pile of hearts and fill my health in large chunks. for best results, use a heartreach potion with this to get longer pickup range on the hearts."

I seem to have trouble replicating the colors of the wood and walls being engulfed by the slime, even though I think I tried all the shades of blue."
Terraria,3dt62k,MidialaSTARLA,2,Mon Jul 20 04:49:01 2015 UTC,"It was Sky Blue paint for the dynasty wood, and Deep Sky Blue paint for the walls and roof tiles. Then pink on the furniture for contrast.  Fun fact: regular Sky Blue paint on dynasty walls is barely noticeable, and Deep Sky Blue paint on dynasty wood makes it look green."

My character's room has a blob of that stuff so he can literally bounce back into action after using his Magic Mirror.

Terraria,3dt62k,Giggapuff,3,Sun Jul 19 09:27:29 2015 UTC,Have you tried putting the cloak lower in the slots than the wings? The accessory closer to the bottom is the one that displays when they conflict with each other.

Terraria,3dxuow,tennissocks,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:21:24 2015 UTC,Well creation often involves decoration. I'll add an edit.
Terraria,3dxuow,TheCastleMan,3,Mon Jul 20 14:35:53 2015 UTC,"Drop a glowstick at your feet. If water is giving you trouble you need to build sideways and drain it in a pit. Large bodies of water can be drained if you first build dirt walls for your hellevator and then drain the interior. Marble biomes need to be walled off, too, or the medusa will kill you. Lava can easily be mined through if your shaft is full of water. You need the proper pickaxe for that, though."
Terraria,3dxuow,Z3R0gravitas,2,Mon Jul 20 12:56:07 2015 UTC,When I have the available materials (money + gel) I use sticky bombs. I'll dig a 3 wide hole by hand for a couple blocks then drop a rope in the middle. I'll then start dropping sticky bombs directly beneath my feet. This allows for a (mostly) uniform shaft down to however low I wanna go/have enough bombs for.
Terraria,3dxuow,TheAtlanticGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:15 2015 UTC,I've got like 10 stacks of 99 sticky bombs. They are my preferred method of jungle mining. Especially if I see something with a lot of nasty around it.

I'm pretty sure there's more options, but not entirely sure what they are.  ETA: Spears can also be handy against the spiders with their knockback and the way you can aim them out of small gaps, but yoyos have better reach."
Terraria,3dylmn,Mister_Bruhh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:07 2015 UTC,haven't defeated my first boss yet and definitely pre hardmode. I did a lot of exploring on the surface world and found 1 sky island. Entire surface is explored.

Terraria,3dylmn,Mister_Bruhh,2,Mon Jul 20 16:43:17 2015 UTC,I would recommend opening 1 block and using a yoyo to hit them over and over. It'll be a while but it'll work

Terraria,3dykml,peach_venture,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I tried beenades. Problem is that they're good but you need a lot of them and farming the queen bee is quite irritating in expert mode in my opinion. She takes longer to kill for me than Skeletron for whatever reason.
Terraria,3dykml,Chaisz3r0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:28 2015 UTC,I built an arena in the surface jungle. Just a couple of platforms. 100 blocks wide or so. I like buffing up with ironskin and endurance potion. Also the obligatory campfire and heart lantern. Assisted by a fire imp she's not too bad. Lots of dodging still.

Terraria,3dykml,Danielhrz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:54 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. But that still requires bees wax. I assume if I go on one of my old hallowed world's there will be a lot of it but I'd rather keep this character clean.
Terraria,3dykml,Danielhrz,2,Mon Jul 20 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"I think the general strategy in expert mode is building a bridge across hell with campfires and heart lanterns. I built mine out of ice, since you get the speed boost with Frostspark boots... anyway, you either throw Beenades with the Hive pack equipped, or you build a railway across hell, and fire the Bee's Knees or Water Bolt behind you, while being just out of range of the hungry, but not too far.  These work best with Magic and Ranged; If you're using Melee, you're going to have to use Flails and Yo-Yos most of the time."

I would suggest getting that before attempting the lunar event with a ranger.  Also, try doing the vortex pillar since that gives the ranger gear.

It's amazing in boss fights and the Pumpkin/Frost moon, but not great against general mobs. You may have more luck switching to a different setup - try the bullet headpiece with a Megashark/Chain Gun and Chlorophyte Bullets for the easiest time, although the Snowman Cannon and Stynger are also very powerful options that will likely prove more useful than the Tsunami.  Once you take down the Vortex Pillar, you can go ahead and craft a Phantasm for much faster arrows and higher all-around DPS. The Phantasm + Holy Arrows also melt the Moon Lord."

Make a platinum pickaxe or go fishing in the ocean for a rare but excellent pick. Dive into the corruption chasms with either a good pickaxe (platinum is actually insufficient) or liberal amounts of purification powder (requires beating EoC). You could also try going for jungle stuff but it might be a little painful.  Hopefully these are helpful without being too spoiler. Walkthrough link should have you covered for more thorough stuff."

You should also focus on mining more. Platinum is probably just hidden out of sight, and you can find good loot in abandoned houses. If you come to a machine called an ""Extractinator"", bring it to your home and start collecting Silt and Slush. You can pass these through the machine and get ores, gems and even a special item.  Try fishing in the ocean too, and complete quests for the angler. When your fishing keel goes up, you get better loot, and in the ocean, you can get a rare fish that acts as a pickaxe. It's the best one ""pre-hard mode""."

If you kill the eye the goblin invasion can happen for free as well -- or you can spend some time in the outer third of the map and get the materials to force one.  Goblin invasion is the more important thing because it unlocks the tinkerer, so you can change the enchant on all your accessories.  You have to go find him fairly deep on a large map.

Once they get an idea and map it all out they stick with it. If the artist suddenly had inspiration to draw a whole set of armour and wings with a beetle theme then he probably just rolled with it. Then the game designers just stuck it in where it would fit with existing ideas / elements. In terms of logic you could say that the reason the Golem has such high defence is because he is actual coated in beetle shell under the initial Lizhard brick layer?"
Terraria,3dtrih,10kingsam,46,Sun Jul 19 12:30:13 2015 UTC,"The idea that makes the most sense to me is that the lihzahrd people leave regular Derpling sacrifices to the Golem. He roasts them with his lasers (hardening the shells like clay in a fire) then cracks them open, eats the insides and keeps the shells around for some reason. Or maybe he cooks and eats them whole, and the way the shells react in his digestive system makes them extra-tough? I'm having too much fun thinking about this."
Terraria,3dtrih,Eslur,35,Sun Jul 19 13:19:22 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be more logical if the Lihzahrds ate the derplings and gave the husks as a gift to their god. The golem is mechanical, it doesn't have to eat."

Not at all,” said the young witchdoctor, who knew this one. “It might look like that to the uninitiated, but, as you say, the true derplidity goes straight to Golem. He, of course, eats the essence of the derplings. We priests eat the mere earthy shell, which, believe me, turns to dust and ashes in our mouths.”  “That would explain why the smell of fried derpling is always better than the actual meat, then?

Terraria,3dtrih,Maruhai,16,Mon Jul 20 01:14:18 2015 UTC,It should be Lizhard armor let's be real here
Terraria,3dtrih,IllogicalMind,2,Sun Jul 19 15:36:23 2015 UTC,"Actually yes. The turtle armor getting the Beetle Shell set effect (because turtles are sturdy, hence the high defence) while the Derplings would give the Beetle Scale Mail set effect (and the whole armor). Then if you'd kill Golem, it would drop Lizhard bars or something which could be fused to Chlorophyte bars to make the Lizhard armor aka the Melee version of Shroomite and Spectre armors."
Terraria,3dtrih,ThyFluffyOne,13,Mon Jul 20 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late to the party but I would like to add to OP's point. Way back when, jungle armor was nonexistent. Instead, their was cobalt armor. It had the exact same stats that jungle armor has now, but was removed due to this exact issue; the armor thematically did not fit the biome. First of all it dropped from creatures in the biome, you couldn't craft it. I believe it was the only armor set that did this. Sure it might make some sense, with the jungle monsters consuming fallen adventurers, but it was still odd. Secondly, it looked badass, but it's art was not fitting of something from the jungle. So, they removed it, and replaced it with a new, thematically correct armor set with the same stats. Personally, I feel that is what they should do in this case. OP makes a very good point in that there should instead be some sort of lihzarhd armor, fitting the indestructible theme.  TL;DR: This happened in the past with cobalt armor being removed and replaced with jungle armor, which had the same stats but fit the biome better."

Terraria,3dtrih,MasterSaturday,3,Sun Jul 19 17:54:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough if that's the way you interpret it, but for me it seems like too much of a jarring leap from Aztec-esque temples to beetle shells"
Terraria,3dtrih,pseudonarne,2,Sun Jul 19 21:52:59 2015 UTC,"inb4 beetle boss  No but seriously, who wouldn't like additional bosses? We could leave golem where he is - being a key to unlocking the cultists and progressing game. There, we could have another minibiome made out of indestructible blocks´- indestructible for pickaxes with less power than picksaw (200% smh). Once you've defeated golem and acquired picksaw, you'd be able to break in and kick some ass in that minibiome (we could even have that so called minibiome in underground desert, as some users mentioned - it could be very much of a scarab themed boss in desert - who then drops beetle husks (or even better, remove beetle husks from game and replace / recolor them with scarab shells, what could have same textures, yet different color. That scarab armor could be the near-endgame throwing class, which I've found people to be very tend of..  Ugh, sorry, had an inspiration boost.. Happens sometimes."

So, if I were to build underground biomes, let's say to the left and right of my hellevator - I would put like 25-30 spaces between each biome and my hellevator walls.  This would give me over the 50 block separation, correct?  Then I suppose the best way would be to have a surface version of each, and then ONE sky.  Keeping the sky separate would probably be the most optimal for fishing quests and hunting for specific fish, I imagine.  So I would have 6 underground fishing spots, 6 surface spots, plus 1 sky and 1 ocean.  That would be all of them, correct?"

I'm actually working on a short guide about it, but basically, you put a group of blocks that are one short of enough to change the biome, then just lay down one block depending on what you want to fish.  So you put in 199 Corruption blocks, and 79 jungle blocks, and 299 Ice blocks.  Then if you want to fish in the Corruption, you just put down one single block and the biome will change.  Same for jungle/ice/crimson.  Hallow has to be kept away from Corruption/Crimson, but works on the same principle - you need 100 Hallow blocks to change a biome."

If they don't count, that would be amazing.  You could place all the blocks, but actuate them all off.  Then whenever you wanted to fish from a certain one, you would just flick a switch, actuate that particular block into existence, and there ya go.  When you're done, turn it back off."

Terraria,3dxrap,DragonV2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:12:15 2015 UTC,"If you want to be safe, dig a 3 wide tunnel around your base. The speed of spread is dependent on how much terrain is affected. After you beat the wall of flesh, a 'V' shape of hallow and crimson/corruption pierce the map. This V can be wide or thin. A containment box can be seen on the wiki page: http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/terraria.gamepedia.com/8/8c/Contained_Corruption_and_Hallow_World.png  If you smash altars, random blocks in the world will get converted to corruption/crimson which increase the spread.   All in all, I wouldn't worry too much about the spread. Just make sure your jungle biome is safe."

Terraria,3dxrap,thisisbleep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:50:59 2015 UTC,"You might want to read this: http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:Containing_the_Hallow/Corruption  For demonstrative purposes, here's a world my wife and I have been playing in for probably hundreds of hours by now: http://i.gyazo.com/562f66832977e2eefa48927bbb73ab8f.png We contained the original crimson sites with wide tunnels, then hit hardmode. A while in, we went around the big V with more wide tunnels. Later still, we made an underground skybridge equivalent to see if we could spot any of the patches that had spawned from breaking altars, and dug borders for them too. After yet another period of time of us doing all sorts of shenanigans, I randomly noticed that the original crimson strip had been spreading outside its quarantine and I'm still not entirely sure how/where that happened, but I reigned it in again (actually, I still haven't reigned the left side in; needa remember to do that). Lastly, I recently got a map viewer and it revealed that big clump of crimson and hallow over under the dungeon that neither of us knew about because we'd never been to that part of the map.  Even with all that, the world really isn't that tainted. Conclusion: Containment is feasible, though clean-up can be a pain."

Terraria,3dxkq5,Vulturewreak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:13:22 2015 UTC,"There are 5 classes of Pre-hard mode armor. You have summoner, melee, caster, archer and thrower.   The best(and only) summoner's gear would be the Bee set. Hornet staff and Imp staff are the two best summoning weapons, both being fairly close in power. Most people favor the Hornet staff.  The caster sets are identicle: Jungle Armor and Ancient Cobalt Armor. They are interchangeable with one being crafted and one being found. The meteor set is different and most players only use it for use with the Space Gun - which is more than enough to handle most of pre-hardmode even on expert. There are numerous useful spells, but Water Book will carry you through all of the pre-hm bosses with ease.  Archer only has one pre-hardmode armor set and it comes from the dungeon. Necro Armor is the only choice. Hellwing and The Bee's Knees are IMO the best pre-hm ranged weapons. The Bee's Knees is significantly better on Expert. The Star Cannon shouldn't be overlooked, though.  Throwing is new to this most recent patch as pre-hard mode alternatives. The new Fossil Gear is your best bet for throwing. Not much to say about this set. Throwing is significantly better on Expert mode thanks to Skeletron's weapon.  Melee, the final set, has two paths to go, but both use Molten Armor as their final set in the pre-hm world. The Yo-yo option is certainly powerful, but requires a bit more work to find everything you need. Cascade, a low drop-rate yo-yo, is the best pre-hm yoyo. Valor is likely the yo-yo you'll use, though. Night's Edge is the best sword, for most purposes."

And I've been throwing characters together in Terraria that I try and get to look like Touhou characters. So far I've made Utsuho (along with the Subterranean Sun), a pale-looking Yuuka, PC-98 and Alt-Colour Marisa, Hata no Kokoro in an ugly sweater, a knock-off Orin, and sorta-maybe Kogasa - that last one I never really used outside of event maps. Another friend made Reimu with an oversized bow and originally a Pharaoh's Robe, though I think that got replaced with a Kimono, but I don't have that picture on hand :S  Right now I'm doing an Expert Ranger run with a Nitori at the helm. And so far, I'm being pummelled by unlimited goblins."

Terraria,3dx2nw,Momorules99,2,Mon Jul 20 06:33:08 2015 UTC,"Don't make rectangles. Experiment, use elements that you like from someone else's build then add your own touch to it. You can google things like making circles for terraria/minecraft (google minecraft circles), aesthetically pleasing arches, Fibonacci sequences, golden ratios. Sometimes, it's good to just write or draw down an idea using pen paper or notepad. For example, this was my first house. I had stacks of wooden rectangles, then I tried making it a little better on the right side. A week ago, I decided I wanted to build something better, so I created a very hilarious mock up of what I wanted to build.  I planned out how much spacing I would need, improvise many things along the way and now live in what was once a sketch.  Also, paint is your best friend! Even deep paint and light paint has different effects. The hammer is also very essential for making your builds look less blocky by rounding edges. If you haven't learned, wiring is also extremely useful, as you can use actuators in many many ways.   Try out all the different kinds of wood as well! Different wood creates different furniture which look drastically different in style. Best of all, you can paint them to match whatever color scheme you choose! This post was extremely useful to me. Don't use torches all the time t0o! Candles are my new love, they look fantastic and not only that, but the peace candles have a very beautiful flickering effect!"
Terraria,3dx2nw,en2nui,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:48:43 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty new to this Minecraft/Terraria stuff but I would say avoid making all your rectangle the same shape.  Maybe instead of 3 horizontal ones you put in 3 vertical ones on top.  Mix the shapes and design up but keep some kind of symmetry.  This si my big project I'm working on (been playing about 2 weeks).  Essentially I have all rectangles but I broke them up into different shapes and sizes.    Also, I just found this out a few days ago, but using the hammer will shape a block so you can make all kinds of neat stuff.  So tonight I made some towers I'm really stoked about.  I just divided one dome in half, made as cool as a design I could, and then repeated 3 times.  I think this best shows the power of using the hammer and just trial and error.  (I didn't have a plan or design I just banged away and then learned more trying to repeat what I had just done)."

Show him the wiki, tell him it's intentional so it's not too unfair for the player as there's a lot of valuable resources that would be corrupted if the devs didn't add unconvertable blocks.   Also tell him that you're not cheating, just playing your way and the game is evolved around the players endless ideas. If you wanna make hellevators, fucking do it and be proud. If you wanna let the world burn, do it. Don't let your friend tell you how to play a sandbox game.   Personally, I'm gonna make some containment biomes and let all hell lose.

Terraria,3dwdos,hipsterdill,4,Mon Jul 20 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"I believe it is intentional. The developers wouldn't want the corruption/crimson/hallow to convert people's bases into different blocks, so wood cannot be converted.

Terraria,3dx84m,ArkiusAzure,3,Mon Jul 20 07:47:57 2015 UTC,"I started doing the same thing recently.  Things I have so far include:   A main base building, where all my npcs live, all crafting stations, and a lot of storage, with each chest labeled.  A tiny arena for cheesing the Moon Lord (lava held by bubbles sold from the party girl, honey on the floor, heart lanterns, camp fires, and three heart statues). An ocean mob spawner that allows for key farming, as well making money. (Spawns a bunch of mobs, I equip the lucky coin + the slime staff and generate 25+ plat an hour) Infinite liquid generators for water, lava, and honey. A sky rail, for easy transportation. A glowing mushroom farm with actuators for easy access to all of the mushrooms.   Some things I'm missing/have been lazy on are herb farms, because they can be a pain in the ass and I have them in other worlds. I still need to make an arena for Duke Fishron. I don't think arenas for other bosses are necessary.  I also haven't found chlorophyte farms to be necessary. The DCU mount makes getting any ore rather trivial."

A teleporter hub (or alternate methods of quick travel, eg hoiks or rails or asphalt, etc).  All types of fishing pools.  A safe box to afk invasions in.  A farm with all crops.  If you're into collecting, set up things like an art museum, an armory and a tool display.  You need 22 houses to be able to house all NPCs including Santa, but one should ideally be in a jungle biome and one in a mushroom biome. Arguably Santa's does not need to be anywhere near your NPC hoard, either, as his house will be empty most of the year."

Terraria,3dx788,OmegaQ13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:34:58 2015 UTC,Going into the dungeon with a waterbolt and farming for the staves there is a good idea (those spawn pre planters right?) Also waterbolt and jungle armor as well as meteor armor/ space gun are pretty good at least until you can get a crystal storm or something.
Terraria,3dx788,rizzo891,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:47:21 2015 UTC,"Restarted yesterday for mage play through.  Like any class play through it has its peaks and valleys.  Space gun for free makes pre hard mode a cakewalk.  I don't know how the new mimic/goblin invasion weapons work on mech, but poison staff used to be step one after wall of flesh and is strong against destroyer.  Metoer staff looks like a good match for the other two."
Terraria,3dx788,Lord_Peppe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:00:52 2015 UTC,"Yes! It's very possible.   Because you're doing a mage playthrough you'll have less survivability so make sure you always have a good arena and plenty of potions.  As for gear, Adamantite/Titanium is the best armor you can get before you kill any of the mechanical bosses. A mana flower is borderline necessary, and get a meteor staff ASAP! The staff should be useful through to plantaria/golem.  If you need it, you can make chlorophyte armor before Plantaria. The Specter armor from the dungeon (which you can make after you defeat Golem) is basically what you use until you can make the lunar stuff.  I'm not sure what is needed to have the martian probe spawn, but the event does happen, several good magic weapons can drop from the boss.  After killing the lunatic, the nebula pillar is what you need to make the new magic weapons and amor.  So I guess before you fight the final boss, your best weapons will be the Nebula ones and the Martian ones.  If anybody else has better information than I do, feel free to correct me. I only went through all of this yesterday, so I'm only sharing what I know."
Terraria,3dx788,Xostbext,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:03:30 2015 UTC,"The martian Probe is a rare enemy that cannot spawn near the center of the world. It only spawns after Golem has been defeated.

Terraria,3dx71w,Endrothem,2,Mon Jul 20 07:32:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe the granite so close to it is interfering? I'd try a different spot.  Also sonar potions will help, at least you'll see when you hook one."
Terraria,3dx71w,vidyagams,2,Mon Jul 20 07:41:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for your suggestion. I finally got it after 1 minute of your answer. I did have to change location and just use a sonar potion. :D

A mage casts spells, uses magic weapons that shoot, and spells and magic weapons are ranged, right? So it would make sense if most mage weapons were ranged. Spectre Staff, Razorpine, Bee Gun, Inferno Fork etc. But ranger stays very distinctive to itself I would say."

Hmm a item made from the emblems would work."
Terraria,3dw5xf,_tastyghost_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:45:02 2015 UTC,i made [SUGGESTION] of this
Terraria,3dw5xf,_tastyghost_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:50:01 2015 UTC,"I like the grapple idea as a primarily melee component. It would have to be called something else to distinguish it from the utility grapples (perhaps leashing?)   The way I see this working is that all armors would have different ""weight"" properties that would affect how much it weighs down your character (this could also affect knockback, so that end game melee armors would negate it from most sources without the cobalt/obsidian/ankh shield.) The beginning armors would obviously be lighter, and they would incrementally increase with each tier. The order of heaviest to lightest by class would be:   Melee > Ranged > Throwing > Summoner > Mage  With that established, different mobs and bosses would have different weights to them as well, and whomever has the lesser weight is the one that can be dragged by the leashing; the greater the disparity in weight, the more you/the mob gets pulled around. At a certain point, weak enough mobs can be ""hulk smashed"" like ""puny gods"" (Avengers joke for the uninitiated) - this would work in the way of fall damage to the player or mob. Obviously, bosses would have a great weight compared to the armor tier before them and can drag even melee characters around quite a bit when fighting them for the first time, but you would still be able to slow them down this way. Within a tier or two though, you should be able to turn the tables on them and drag them around.  There could also be different leashing grapples that allow different lengths of leash, and different weights (of their own - in addition to your armor weight; perhaps a resistance stat as well.) This could also lead to weighted modifiers, and accessories made specifically for weight. Obviously this would be less useful to classes other than melee for solo play due to lower weight in their armors, but this would be excellent for multiplayer. The melee user would still be in danger of direct attack, as the leashing would only provide so much control over closely weighted (or outclassing) targets, and they could always come straight at you (with some resistance of course.)  Edit: A word.  Edit 2: To delve into the resistance stat more - it would be the force of the leash that keeps the target at a distance (the end of the leash,) this would also be affected by weight. Early game leashes will have little or no resistance, and would get more as you get closer to hardmode. An endgame leash should be able to slow down the movement of the Moon Lord a bit (and Duke Fishron a bit more,) but most everything else could be kept largely at bay. Perhaps these endgame leashes could also target multiple mobs as well (though this would give you less leverage to move them - again factoring in weight.. Did I mention weight is involved?)"
Terraria,3dw5xf,BananaOnTheJob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:11 2015 UTC,"A simple starting selection would be nice, say melee you start with a bit more health, and say 5 perm armor. Magic you start with extra mana and a weak magic weapon. Ranged you start with a weak bow, arrows, and a range buff. Classes can be changed later in the game with a item or npc perhaps? Hmm a item made from the emblems would work."

Terraria,3dvmfz,SsgtGimli,3,Sun Jul 19 22:16:39 2015 UTC,Don't worry about the corruption/crimson/hallow when you get into hardmode. Later on in the game there's something you can purchase from an NPC that is basically a gun that changes biomes and it makes it really easy to get rid of biomes/replace them. (The corruption/crimson/hallow spread also spreads very slowly after killing a certain boss in the jungle.)
Terraria,3dvmfz,KillaJoke,3,Sun Jul 19 22:42:09 2015 UTC,"That's the gun I was talking about in the post. Me and my friends are way to underly equipped to take out any enemies and have no real direction on where to progress, making it nigh on impossible for us to be able to take on and defeat one of the mechanical bosses for the NPC to spawn. If we just allow the corruption to spread to our houses the rooms become invalid too which means we will lose most of the useful NPCs"
Terraria,3dvmfz,KillaJoke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:47:41 2015 UTC,"You guys just have to play it really cautiously when in expert mode. Break as many altars as you can and then run, and when mining for ores just hide and pick off enemies when the come. Look up Holy Arrows and the Daedalus Stormbow on the wiki and get both of those to fight mech bosses."
Terraria,3dvmfz,KillaJoke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:50:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I have a question however. Every time an altar is smashed another crimson block will spawn randomly in the world encouraging the spread of corruption. Are you saying to just allow the corruption go ham over all of our houses and just try to race to the mechanical bosses
Terraria,3dvmfz,Jabbatrios,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:52:47 2015 UTC,"If the corruption/crimson is literally on your house, then you have an issue and I would advise just mining out the blocks around it and/or getting holy water to stop it. If it's just spreading in general, then I wouldn't worry about it because by the time it becomes an issue you should have the tools to fight it."
Terraria,3dvmfz,LautaJaska,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:10:31 2015 UTC,It's not spread that far to my house right now but my friends house is long gone before we have really taken any new items with hardmode. Thanks :)
Terraria,3dvmfz,LautaJaska,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:19:59 2015 UTC,"You can build a floating  npc tower or dig a moat and fill it with bricks. Bricks can't be corrupted I believe. I think you need it to be three to five blocks thick to cut off corruption. Also be warry of walls as those count for spread to apparently.  Also over your journey you'll probably have saved up plenty of grass seed's for biomes. If not, I'd recomend that you get as many of them as you can so you can regrow your land, or artificially kick start your own minny biomes. Also I believe the Dryad npc sells purifying powder which is a weaker way to clean up corruption.   In terms of direction when you're starting out, use the hammer you had to smash demon altars to spawn the metals you need for hardmode, or go fishing and cross your finger for loot. Be warned the first option will randomly place hallow in the world to purify the world. Thus fishing will allow you to contain your spread more but it's a lil bit less action packed.  Once you have some armor and a handy weapon pick one of the mechanical bosses. Skeletron prime and the destroyed are the easier bosses to deal with in my opinion. I also would recommend if you can manage to farm of souls of light and make hallow mimic's for the Daedalus bow. It's a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge help against the mechanical bosses."

Terraria,3dwsgl,DrowningEmbers,3,Mon Jul 20 04:35:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely double check your teleporter and switches - that's the most common place to mess up, right at the ends!  The wire has to actually hit one of the teleporter's three blocks - not just hover over it - and the switch has to be hit by that same wire.  If both those are okay, start testing it at various places along the wire path.  There might be a gap somewhere you went to fast.  Go to the halfway point, and check to see if it works from both directions.  If it doesn't work from one of them, go halfway between that and check again, to narrow it down."
Terraria,3dwsgl,Ktesedale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:37:55 2015 UTC,"Have you wired it correctly? The same wire needs to go from the switch to the teleporter and then to the other teleporter and switch.  If that still is not working you might have a gap in the wiring or the wire limit has been exceeded (I am not sure if the limit has been removed for consoles yet, PC is unlimited)."
Terraria,3dwsgl,thisisbleep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:15:35 2015 UTC,"Ok I think the limit is the problem.  I cut part of the wire and made one and put a new telporter and wired it closer to one of them.

Terraria,3dwsgl,thisisbleep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:05:57 2015 UTC,"Teleporters are 3 blocks wide, so you can keep the same wire, just make one cut and put the teleporter centred on the gap so one wire is on the left and the other is on the right (without them touching each other.

Gem Robes (Made of silk and gems, they're pretty useful before you have Meteor Armor or Jungle Armor) Band of Starpower (Found in Shadow Orbs) Vilethorn (Found in Shadow Orbs) Water Bolt (Found mixed in with books in the Dungeon, sometimes there is one close to the surface so you might not have to beat Skeletron to find it.)   Meteor and Jungle armor are better alternatives but they as readily available as some of the other things I listed. Gems can be tedious to hunt for sometimes though."
Terraria,3dvgrc,Deoxysprime,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"Early Prehard  Armor  For early armor, any armor will do. But if you want something mage-specific, you have two good choices.   The simplest choice is the Gypsy Robe and Magic Hat, which are sold by the Traveling Merchant. Together, you'll get increased magic damage, magic crit, and a set bonus that I'll get to in a moment. Alternatively, you can get a gem robe. Each tier grants you progressively more mana, and the higher tiers also grant more defense.  Now here's the interesting thing. Robes, both the Gypsy Robe and any variety of gem robe, can be combine with the Wizard Hat (dropped by the rare enemy, Tim, down in the cavern level) or the Magic Hat to get alternative set bonuses. The Wizard Hat's set bonus grants you +10 magic crit, while the Magic Hat's grants +60 mana. You can use any leg armor along with a robe and hat and still benefit's from these set bonuses.  Weapons  For magic weapons, there's not much early stuff. You can try to get a Wand of Sparking from a surface chest. And while that's a decent start, you'll want to get a gem staff asap. They do good damage and can pierce multiple times. It will be your primary weapon for a while.  Getting gems requires some luck, but there are some things you can do. After you've explored a bit, you'll probably come across a Spelunker potion or two. Try speeding through the area's you've already cleared with a spelunker potion. The more area you've cleared prior, the more likely you are locate some gems before your potion runs out. Of course, you could always craft your own Spelunker potions, but getting the required Moon Glow would require a trip to the jungle, which can be dangerous at this point.  Alternatively, if you're lucky enough to run into a skeleton merchant when he's selling Spelunker Glowsticks (any time during a full moon) or Magic Lanturn (night of a full moon), snag 'em. They're also helpful for highlighting gems and ores.  If you find a marble mini-biome, slaying Medusas gives you small chance to claim a Medusa Head, which is a *fantastic *early game weapon. Since it can hit all nearby enemies in your line of sight, it is especially useful against the multi-segmented Eater of Souls and Brain of Cuthulu.   With robes dawned and a gem staff, you should be able to subdue the Eye of Cuthulu.  Accesories  There's not much for mage-specific accessories at this stage of the game. But check in with the Traveling Merchant. If he's selling the celestial magnet, snag it if you have the cash. Being able to draw in stars from a distance will be valuable later own, and this accessory can be combined with the mid-prehard mode Magic Cuffs.  Also, pick up any Band of Regenerations you see. You'll going to want a more than one for crafting purposes, especially if you're on a corrupted world.  Feeling Brave?  If you're feeling brave, you could step things up early by going down into the crimson/corruption, destroying two of the breakables, and seeing if you can get some meteor gear early.  Mid Prehard  Armor  For armor, have two options: Meteorite and Jungle.  Meteorite is definitely the fan favorite. It's available early (just need to shatter one orb), raises your magic attack, and allows for infinite space gun spam. It's a winner. But jungle has its good points too. It boosts your mana by +80, which doesn't sound all that useful at first. But combined with some Arcane prefixed accessories, you can have some insane spamability with some of the more powerful late prehard mode weapons.  Weapons  For weapons, the vile thorn and crimson rods are both available as soon as you start exploring the crimson/corruption.   Next, craft yourself a space gun, which should find a permanent home in your hot keys. It's a great all-around weapon that can be useful against every pre-hard mode boss when combined with the meteor armor.   Finally, you should snag a Bee Gun from the Queen Bee, which is overall useful a  Accessories  If you're in a world with the corruption, definitely try to get a Band of Starpower. Better yet, get two. This will allow you to craft and equip both a Band of Mana Regeneration and a pair of magic cuffs, which will help keep you supplied with mana.  While exploring the jungle, keep plenty of inventory slots open. If you're lucky, you'll pick up a nature's gift, which can decrease your mana consumption. You can use it to craft a mana flower, which decrease mana consumption further and allows you to auto-drink mana potions. Careful with this item, since its easy to consume mana potions even when you don't intend to. I like to keep this item in the vanity slot until I need it.  And finally, there's the hive pack dropped by the expert mode queen bee, like you need another reason to use the bee gun.  Late Prehard  Armor  At this point, you already have the best pre-hardmode mage armor.  Weapons  The Book of Skulls, which is rarely dropped by Skeletron, is a great if you can get it. Excellent damage and piercing, and it can juggle enemies. It's strong enough to get you through early hard mode.  Don't forget to check the bookshelves for a Water Bolt book. It's another excellent weapon, and a very effective one to use against the Wall of Flesh. Even more so if you're using the all-in approach to your mana total.  Finally, there's the Demon Scythe, which is dropped by demons in the underworld. Another excellent mage weapon that can also serve you through early hardmode. I definately recommend getting one before defeating the Wall of Flesh.  There are other magic weapons available at this stage, but these are the most useful in my opinion.  Accessories  Nothing here that you didn't already have access to.  Well, technically, there's one. The Clothier Voodoo Doll, which can be obtained from dungeon enemies, will allow you to murder the Clothier when equipped and resummon Skeletron, which can be useful if you want another attempt at the Book of Skulls. You horrible, horrible monster."

Terraria,3dwko0,SilverDeoxys563,3,Mon Jul 20 03:29:42 2015 UTC,It would be really cool if there was an accessory which let you switch off which grappling hook you could use. So one would go then other and so forth and so on.
Terraria,3dwko0,CrashmanX,3,Mon Jul 20 03:41:39 2015 UTC,"Here's to do it:     Step 0.) The hook you're using must be able to support more than one hook at a time. The slime hook, and regular hook will not work for this. You must have some sort of storage near you when you do this.  Step 1.) Use the hook. In this example, I'll be using the Plantera hook and the anti gravity hook.   Step 2.) Access the storage device. Hover over the hook you want to use and right click it.    Step 3.) Use your grappling hook key(in my case it's ""e"" and by default it's ""e"") and volia you should have two different grappling hooks."
Terraria,3dwko0,CrashmanX,2,Mon Jul 20 03:29:18 2015 UTC,"Oh the way I did it was using a hook to it's max, then equipping a different hook that would normally have less hooks than the previous."

Its nothing more than a grind if you would add levels, i set up my slime farm and level to 99 or so.  For me Terraria is pretty unique due to this special progress system where you get rewarded and grow stronger the more you explore rather than just grinding the same monsters all over again."

Terraria,3dxv1c,BananaOnTheJob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:04:38 2015 UTC,"uhh, that's not how it works. have you even played expert mode? all boss drop item chances are doubled.  for example, an item from plantera with 11% droprate in normal will have 22% droprate in expert. expert doesn't mean grinding.  also, you never ""hit"" expert mode, it's an optional gamemode for experienced players that offers increased enemy difficulty for better droprates, faster money earning and unique expert items.  and no, I would hate an RPG system. it's just not meant for Terraria, I'd rather explore to find my items rather than grinding with the goal of ""leveling up"" (which defeats the purpose of trying to eliminate grind)  also when the hell do you even need to grind? if you kill a boss a few times you never have to fight it again unless you're going for trophy.  your entire argument is flawed."

Terraria,3dwi5q,Krystallios,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:00:57 2015 UTC,either is fine  i would also recommend grinding for a rod of discord. put <gun> in slot 1 (or 0 if you're left handed) and rod in slot 2 (or 9 if you're left handed) and use that to evade his laz0r attacks

Terraria,3dwi5q,orangedonut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:47:18 2015 UTC,Full stardust armor with minions will protect you well. My farm is just a huge hollowed out place underground and I got my rod after 800 chaos elementals. Which took around 3 days? RNG not on my side.
Terraria,3dwi5q,flamedance58,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:55:52 2015 UTC,Do note the OP is having trouble killing the Moonlord period. So suggesting the Stardust Armor is a tad moot.
Terraria,3dwi5q,CrashmanX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:20:05 2015 UTC,I know that. I'm just saying stardust is good for afk farming in general.  Not about killing moonlord.

Terraria,3dwi5q,Ktesedale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:06 2015 UTC,I grappled in honey floating above ground with one stardust dragon and the rest are cells. They can take care of the occasional hallowed mimic fine as well.
Terraria,3dqvsg,Fleshpoundd,35,Sat Jul 18 16:11:42 2015 UTC,"Very impressive, especially the on-reaction switches to the rod of discord to avoid the death rays. You made a very difficult fight look easy."
Terraria,3dqvsg,hiccup251,113,Sat Jul 18 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"Well, this was a fight and a half.  Initially, I planned to do this in a UFO mount, but the added mobility as well as the extra accessory slots you can use for damage increase made that far too easy. (and very boring)   I also tried doing it the way you see in the video but without the rod of discord. And while it is definitely possible to pull off, I figured this was good enough for now. I’ll let someone else one-up me in that regard :)   Also, in reality using no damage accessories instead of no armor would be more difficult. The shroomite set (best pre moonlord range gear) gives a total of 25% crit chance and 28% damage increase. (set effect would not be a factor) While the stats of the damage accessories I used add up to 63% more damage and 18% crit. But hey, no armor seems more impressive at first glance, right? :)  Anyway, this is my first video ever so I hope there aren’t any quality issues. As stated in the video description however, I just uploaded the raw footage because of my inexperience. I hope I have set enough rules on this challenge to ensure few people will complain that I used some cheesy tactic."
Terraria,3dqvsg,TheGuyAboveIsGreat,71,Sat Jul 18 16:13:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you should not worry about what people think. You killed the moon lord without armour/buffs in EXPERT mode!

Terraria,3dqvsg,_Skuzzzy,11,Sat Jul 18 17:31:02 2015 UTC,I wanna know how long that arena took to setup.  While its an impressive fight taking the time to set that arena up seems far more impressive IMO.  Dont think i could subject myself to all that time.
Terraria,3dqvsg,_Fast_,41,Sat Jul 18 17:38:58 2015 UTC,Created a large world and then proceeded to place the arena in TEdit. I personally see no problems with that as the end result is exactly the same as making it ingame. I just saved myself a lot of hours of preparation.
Terraria,3dqvsg,_Skuzzzy,23,Sat Jul 18 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely not cheating at all, I would hope you wouldn't waste your time setting all that stuff up"
Terraria,3dqvsg,aget61695,3,Sat Jul 18 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how people on this sub don't class this as cheating?  You're using an external program to create an arena that greatly decreases the difficulty of the boss fight. Yes, it takes a long time to set up if you do it in game, but isn't that the point? It takes a long time but the benefit is huge. Removing the effort it takes to setup the arena is flat out cheating.  If the whole point in the video is to show that beating the Moon Lord with no buffs/100 hp etc. is possible then I understand prepping in TEdit, but if this was someone's main world and they used an external program to do anything in it, then yes it's cheating."
Terraria,3dqvsg,AmethystZhou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:34:03 2015 UTC,"It's because making the arena is trivial, it takes no skill. We all care about the skill associated with beating the moon lord in this fashion.  People don't consider it cheating because they care about the technical skill rather than the mindless determination it would take to create a large arena like this.  Anyone on this sub given the right amount of time can create that arena, I'd say very few can fight the moon lord under the conditions he did."

To be honest, the Moon Lord is pretty easy (a lot easier than Fishron on expert, that's for damn fucking sure), it just takes a long time, even longer on Expert Mode."
Terraria,3dqvsg,msr0685,5,Sun Jul 19 09:44:07 2015 UTC,"IMHO, Fishron was cake with the cosmic car keys, chain gun, shroomite armor, and chlorophyte bullets. I even upgraded the gun to an unreal vortex beater and the same strategy wouldn't make it through the first phase of the moon lord...  The laser beam was the biggest hurdle to that strategy working for the moon lord."
Terraria,3dqvsg,Davoness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:48:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's cause I did it with friends, but the third phase of Expert Fishron is virtually impossible without post-Moon Lord gear, he does too much damage and is too tanky for any gear before that. He just teleports to you and damages you in the third phase, you die very quickly, nothing in the game is fast enough to out run his third phase."
Terraria,3dqvsg,msr0685,3,Sun Jul 19 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"No, third phase is actually pretty easy, the secret is you don't run away from him, you stay in one place and jump to evade his attack, do not attempt to run away. Same goes to the final form of saucer from mars, don't do anything but run left-right from his attack and shoot. Also true with Bee, but she is pretty doable anyway."
Terraria,3dqvsg,lod77,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:49:54 2015 UTC,"Just tried it, Fishron kills you even faster if you don't run away. There's also the Cthulhunados that he spawns which complicate that."

Terraria,3dqvsg,msr0685,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:54:37 2015 UTC,"I tanked him with full warding accessories, a Daybreak, lifeforce, regen, and endurance potions, beetle armor, and lots of greater healing potions and teleporting back to the nurse. Once you get him in a pattern, and as long as you keep an eye on your health, it's not all that bad."
Terraria,3dqvsg,Boondoge,5,Sun Jul 19 16:01:36 2015 UTC,"What added mobility in the UFO mount? I find that it moves very slowly compared to wings, or am I missing some turbo setting somewhere?   I think the hardest to recreate (and thus the most likely to get complaints about) from that vid would be the arena, which would take hours to manually place, but I don't really think it'd be that much harder with one row of platforms instead of what you had. (Idea for a next video? :p)  Impressive dodging with the discord rod by the way. Also for mobile ranger fights, shroomite armor with chlorophyte helmet is more efficient than full shroomite if you're not using the set bonus.  No complaints about video quality by the way, it was plenty good."
Terraria,3dqvsg,BigOmega,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:44:11 2015 UTC,"UFO mount is pretty fast, but it starts slowly, so you just try to fly in the same direction or, if you use last magic armor, in a circle. Mounts are great because you don't need boots and wings anymore, so you can use free slots for damage or defence."
Terraria,3dqvsg,Mooterconkey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:14:39 2015 UTC,Sick mechanics brah! Is it even possible to cheese the moonlord though?
Terraria,3dqvsg,Fuzati,3,Sun Jul 19 06:43:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. On mobile so I don't have a link but I saw a video of a guy standing on a lava bubble using obsidian rose/star crossed necklace/health regen lamps and pots. Obby rose reduces lava damage to rapid ticks of 1 damage (in expert), cross necklace takes those rapid ticks and makes you invincible, regen items keep you healthy through the constant damage. With that you literally just stand in one place and kill him as you please."

Terraria,3dqvsg,someonetookjacob,3,Sun Jul 19 06:14:22 2015 UTC,No love for summoner :(
Terraria,3dqvsg,Driecg36,3,Sun Jul 19 11:04:30 2015 UTC,"Meh, summoner is so bad it still barely even qualifies as class right now. They still need a way of actively contributing to fights and helping minions out with abilities and direct weapons that scale with minion damage(or minion count). Summoning long-ass dragons and then dodging until the enemy falls over dead shouldn't be all there is to the class. Using only summons is a gimmick and self-imposed challenge(Yrimir's Hagrid is a great example for that), and if you use a gun or magic you're pretty much a different flavour of mage/ranger that sacrifices damage and durability for some extra homing projectiles(you can use melee as well, but then you're stuck using short to midranged weapons with the shittiest defenses in the game period, even though the summons' greatest perk is the ability to automatically home on foes far away)."
Terraria,3dqvsg,Driecg36,9,Sun Jul 19 09:44:50 2015 UTC,Hmm. No mount? Now lets see it without wings.  (but seriously very impressive!)

Terraria,3dqvsg,ousire,11,Sat Jul 18 23:24:50 2015 UTC,"Very nice.  Although, I  think constructing that arena would take about 2 years..."
Terraria,3dqvsg,Pathosphere,5,Sun Jul 19 00:33:45 2015 UTC,"eh, it wouldn't be that hard.  hardest part is definitely collecting all the iron/lead you would need to make the tracks.  With a builder potion, brick layer, and a minecart, you can cruise along at something like 16 miles per hour laying down a continuous line.  That means 12 minutes for a full map bridge on a large world, though I think he used less than a third of the map.  the verticals would be harder, but if you were doing that by hand you'd probably use the various different ropes, since those are pretty easy to collect in bulk."
Terraria,3dqvsg,msr0685,5,Sat Jul 18 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"Ropes can't be hooked though, minecart rails are afaik the only type of block with those specific properties. Still, a platform bridge with vertical ropes would work fine I think, just need to hold down to fall through, and it'll slow you down a bit, but ultimately doable I think."
Terraria,3dqvsg,NightFantom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:39:03 2015 UTC,Wouldn't platforms work? Why use minecart tracks specifically?
Terraria,3dqvsg,msr0685,9,Sun Jul 19 00:16:56 2015 UTC,"Because you can fall through tracks without slowing down but you can still hookshot to them like platforms.  When falling, you always get stuck for a half a second on regular platforms."
Terraria,3dqvsg,NightFantom,2,Sun Jul 19 03:12:37 2015 UTC,"Well… You can sort of achieve same result with platforms if you place them as stairs, and since 1.3 added ability to do so with smart cursor, I would say that holding down to fall through stairs in the battle is easier than mining required amount of iron."
Terraria,3dqvsg,turtlethememe,2,Sun Jul 19 03:51:09 2015 UTC,"Oh right, I noticed something like that recently but haven't been able to pin it down, what's exactly going on with platform stairs and falling through them?"
Terraria,3dqvsg,iGyman,2,Sun Jul 19 06:57:51 2015 UTC,"If you hold ""down"" while falling on stairs you won't stop and fly right through them like there is no stairs at all.You stop for a second if you fall on platforms."

Terraria,3dqvsg,Pathosphere,4,Sat Jul 18 18:47:50 2015 UTC,Probably since the wall climbing wouldn't be useful and the evasion ability would defeat the purpose of the fight if he got lucky and dodged a hit.

Terraria,3dqvsg,mr-dogshit,2,Sat Jul 18 20:54:27 2015 UTC,Another (totally impractical way since it probably forces you to stop for a moment and is too slow) would be greating a shield with the Ice Rod

Terraria,3dwfgw,gnomoretears,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:57 2015 UTC,Dig a 5 block trench all around it so it's totally isolated. Do note you'll want crimson  areas for fishing and for drops.
Terraria,3dx1e0,AvengeTC,6,Mon Jul 20 06:16:50 2015 UTC,"We do not know, you will just have to wait if you want a sale price, but it is likely that there will be a sale when the Mac and Linux ports are released (latest ETA was the end of this month).  Terraria is easily worth $10 though."
Terraria,3dx1e0,thisisbleep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:18:40 2015 UTC,"This. It's well worth your $10.  Also, you can add the Enhanced Steam extension on chrome and you can look back through history of when it's been on sale. It'll give you somewhat of an idea when, historically, it's been on sale. It's also a great add-on for steam on browser in general."

Terraria,3dx1e0,InsaneKuma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:34:43 2015 UTC,Terraria usually goes below $3 whenever there is a steam sale. When that sale is I don't really know.
Terraria,3dx1e0,Potato_Gunman3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:29:17 2015 UTC,I got mine for $2.50 and it has the most hours of all my games AND is the cheapest one I have. Concentration of value is what this game is. I think OP should get it regardless as this game has literal hundreds of hours of value.
Terraria,3dx1e0,Suicidalsquid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:49 2015 UTC,I'm currently 50+ hours into my 4th playthrough with maybe a total of 200+ hours played. I paid $10 and received 4 copies. Since I paid there have been multiple free content patches.   I'd have been happy if I'd paid $200 for that value. I think you'll find the same if you splashed on the current price.
Terraria,3dwf4g,spyrohh,7,Mon Jul 20 02:28:46 2015 UTC,"IMO it's subjective. Terraria is a sandbox game that means for a single player world, your own rules apply.  That said, the ability to go from one world to another using a single character is built into the game itself. From that perspective, the devs has intended for that to happen so IMO not cheating."
Terraria,3dwf4g,gnomoretears,4,Mon Jul 20 02:32:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's cheating at all to be honest. There are a lot of things that different worlds simply don't have. Crimson/Corruption, different hardmode dungeon enemies, maybe you ran out of pearls/hearts to break and didn't get an item you wanted or not enough metorites spawned. I feel that making multiple worlds is pretty much a requirement tbh."
Terraria,3dwf4g,MrPopTarted,3,Mon Jul 20 02:35:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. It never hurts to have at least 2 worlds, one crimson one corruption."
Terraria,3dwf4g,theklocko,4,Mon Jul 20 02:54:24 2015 UTC,Not cheating at all. If it was then our characters would be locked to the first world they entered 😛
Terraria,3dwf4g,flamedance58,2,Mon Jul 20 03:00:24 2015 UTC,In expert if you make a small world I almost feel like you need an extra medium/large world just to get proper gear without fishing.
Terraria,3dwf4g,rizzo891,2,Mon Jul 20 02:54:59 2015 UTC,I have a world called tree farm. You can imagine what I did there. All them trees in my mp world are too short and they grow too slowly.

Terraria,3dwf4g,vidyagams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:52:27 2015 UTC,"You can play the game however you want.  To get the bundle of baloons though, good luck getting them all in one world. I go through a few just to get a sandstorm in a bottle most of the time.   I have a few other worlds, ones just an arena to fight invasions/events."
Terraria,3dwf4g,AlexIsAnAI,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:01:23 2015 UTC,"It is definitely not cheating. If he says otherwise, corrupt/crimson his world and watch his opinions change! >:D"

Terraria,3dwf4g,GodleyX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:19:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly you can't really get everything in a single world anyways. Already with 1 world you don't have access to either crimson or corruption. And with so few floating islands, good luck getting all the balloons you might need. Or even finding a pyramid with a sandstorm in a bottle. Or in my case, Realizing after you get to post golem, that one of the drops you needed from the dungeon at this point is impossible to get because your dungeon did not spawn with the slab background. It's sadly kind of a must."

Terraria,3drvyl,Incoherrant,14,Sat Jul 18 22:51:38 2015 UTC,"Pink slime blocks (painted purple), arcane rune walls (possibly painted to tone down the yellow) or purple rain wallpaper, ebonstone bricks? Maybe some loose amethysts. That's off the top of my head, not sure how nice these would actually look together. o:"
Terraria,3drvyl,Incoherrant,14,Sat Jul 18 23:10:54 2015 UTC,"Updated!  I used the rune walls like you said and painted them pink, since purple looked a bit too off-shade.  I'm actually kinda happy with what I got, despite lacking pink slime blocks... once I get some, I might try to make another and see how it looks."
Terraria,3drvyl,Incoherrant,5,Sat Jul 18 23:59:40 2015 UTC,"Nice work, I like it! :D May I suggest doing some sort of hammered blocks on the top thing for a more dynamic shape? Ie http://i.gyazo.com/78a4f106bad41355051806ba26d5740c.png"

Terraria,3drvyl,Nekro-Byte,6,Sun Jul 19 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"It's super frustrating that the Solar Flare armor is super... dull (?) when you equip only a part of it in your vanity slot. If I could have it at full brightness when wearing it for vanity, it would be super awesome. But, instead, it seems to be an all-or-nothing type deal. Either you wear every piece together or you wear none of them.  For example, I'd really like to wear the Solar Flare breastplate as vanity. But it's way too dull unless I equip more of them. So instead I'm sticking with Loki's breastplate. Screenshot of what I'm talking about.  Though, to be fair, there are some sets where the Solar Flare Breastplate's dimness isn't a bad thing. Grim dye makes it look really neat. And on some sets I think full brightness wouldn't help it. Living flame dye looks really bad as-is, and I don't think a change in brightness would change that.  It's just, I dunno. It forced me to look for other vanity items, and I've found a better look, but I wish I could've just used it anyway. This same effect occurs with the Stardust set and I think it's a huge hindrance to vanity customization for people who want to use only a few pieces of the set. Especially people who use something like Familiar Hair to hide their helmet but otherwise let their armor show. Those people will have to settle for dull looking armor."
Terraria,3drvyl,danjo3197,5,Sun Jul 19 02:19:46 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. Stardust helmet looks silly when it has the dim ""lighting"" but looks great when in a full set."
Terraria,3drvyl,Vingdoloras,3,Sat Jul 18 22:17:01 2015 UTC,I wish there were more types of mannequins. The wood looks pretty bad (not that it stands out that much) in colorful builds like this.

Terraria,3dwbx7,runetrantor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:00:45 2015 UTC,"You have to clear the lunar event. To do so, you kill surrounding enemies, lowering the shields, then killing the pillar."

O.o  PLEASE tell me each pillar keeps track of how many I kill and how much I damage the pillar, and it's not a 'die and you have to restart' ...  This mess is most certainly not conductive for the madmen that chose hardcore players."
Terraria,3dwbx7,flamedance58,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:13:58 2015 UTC,Each one requires 100 50 kills to take the shield down.  Then you have to destroy the thing itself. For the solar one stay on the ground as the worms that come are really powerful and their weak spot is their tail.  Other than  doing the whole thing and then just dying to the moon lord you can't stop the event otherwise.
Terraria,3dwbx7,Ktesedale,2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"100 kills, not 50, and 150 kills in expert."
Terraria,3dwbx7,Ktesedale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:59:12 2015 UTC,For the solar one... using the hook or standing on platforms count as 'flying'?
Terraria,3dwbx7,Physonium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:23:30 2015 UTC,"Standing on platforms doesn't count as flying (as long as the platform hasn't been hammered in to stairs), but I think using the hook does count."

Terraria,3dwbx7,Ktesedale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:27:10 2015 UTC,"The pillars' health, or the kill count needed to lower the shield?  Because someone did mention I have to kill them (And lower the shield) without logging off the world, or else it resets."
Terraria,3dwbx7,Ktesedale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:22:35 2015 UTC,"Kill count lowers shield, then you kill the pillar."
Terraria,3dwbx7,Ktesedale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:58:44 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is to go right to where the background changes for the pillar.  Lure a couple of enemies away at a time, into the normal background, making sure you have a campfire, heart crystal, and are using potions.  After you've killed 100 enemies, the shield will come down (as long as you don't log out during this time) and you can attack the pillar.  There are a couple of small tricks - keep your feet on the floor for the orange (Solar) pillar, and don't use any projectiles at that one - they can bounce them back.  For the purple (Nebula) one, I suggest some sort of homing weapon - they teleport.  Also, keep moving, because there's an attack that homes in on you and is quite annoying to avoid.  (It looks like a small ball of lightning.)  Blue and green are more straightforward, imo."
Terraria,3dwbx7,mostlyjoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:03:03 2015 UTC,"So I have to kill a 100 enemies and destroy the pillar in one sitting?  Would dying reset anything, like the pillar's health?  Sword beams count as projectiles?  Because the Green pillar is basically floating on top of my Jungle outpost, which has a teleporter to my home base, so I can go in fast and repeatedly, but I cant ensure depleting the pillar's life in one respawn, like at all."
Terraria,3dwbx7,orangedonut,2,Mon Jul 20 04:18:52 2015 UTC,"You do have to do it in one sitting, but I'm pretty sure dying won't reset anything.  Only logging out will mess it up.  (As will logging out after you've killed the last pillar and before the boss spawns - if you don't want to fight him, you can log out before he shows up and you'd have to start over at the cultists again, but won't die to him if you're not ready.)  Some of the sword beams count as projectiles - I'm not sure which ones do and which do not.  (Aside from one of the drops from the boss, Meowmere, which definitely counts.)  Which sword do you have?"
Terraria,3dwbc7,Jizztwizzlers,2,Mon Jul 20 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"That's potentially incredibly annoying, though I agree this game could really use more environment sounds, like the tick tock of grandfather clocks."
Terraria,3dwbc7,HewlettPackardPleb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but I'd assume the sound would be adjusted for actual in-game use."

Terraria,3dw5i3,duckfeet55,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:33 2015 UTC,"It's definitely possible to do this with the gear you have. I personally used the Megashark with crystal bullets, Frost armor, and a pair of wings. Against such a big target it's easy to focus on dodging. A full set of combat potions, along with heart statues/campfire/heart lantern make the fight much easier.   If that's not enough, he becomes even easier with full spectre gear (hood) and an Inferno Fork, if you're willing to farm for one. The Leaf Blower works, and the Magnet Sphere is useful as well.   Try to fly in arcs over the body in both stages, as it makes dodging the line attacks easy. Your only major worries are being cornered and being hit by the bouncing flames, since those are harder to keep track of. In the second form, the lasers become the big threat. Keep moving and you should be fine."

When you spawn him shoot his first fist, once it's broken, jump to the other hand and break that one. Then, you can shoot his head and jump over him while doing so, once his head is broken you can jump over him the same way you were doing before, and you will be fine. Hope I helped! :)"

Terraria,3dw5i3,theothersteve7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:30:41 2015 UTC,"Jump over him, constantly, from one side to the other.  Make sure you have a Heart Lantern and a Bonfire.  Consider getting a Charm of Myths, Worm Scarf, and Ice Shell.  If you're still stuck, get Turtle Armor.  With those weapons, I'd choose the yoyo; I personally killed him with a megashark in turtle armor.  I thought Plantera was much harder than Golem personally."
Terraria,3dvevp,404House,2,Sun Jul 19 21:12:56 2015 UTC,"Mages, stacking % damage, nebula armor and last prism in aoe situations will do the most damage, probably."
Terraria,3dvevp,Physonium,2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:32 2015 UTC,"The answer depends on the situation. It will be different depending on the number of enemies, and the accuracy. Last prism against a line of enemies will be the most dps, but that isn't very practical. SDMG with chlorophyte bullets could be the most damage against hard to hit single target enemies. One of those 2 is probably the best answer."
Terraria,3dvevp,bluebowser31,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:16:34 2015 UTC,sdmg single target dps is pretty good but with absolutely useless survivability as the ranger class has no built in regen or lifesteal which is needed to tank and kill a boss. Also vortex armor to be truly effective needs to be stealthed so only the vortex booster will be your form of movement

They rain stars down for each of the Tsunamis 5 arrows and absolutely wreck shit.  A simple heart statue, ammo box, honey, and heart lantern let me keep my health and ammo just fine.  I used shroomite armor and basically just stood still the whole battle. I used to use beetle+vampire knives since otherwise my health would just disappear, but with the Tsunami the damage is so high that I'd be killing mourning woods fast enough to drop hearts to keep me alive.  I also used your basic potions, and the archery potion definitely helped I'm sure.  For my accessories, I took into account the fact that I wouldn't be moving much inside my trap temple, so I opted out of wings and boots and instead used: warding flesh knuckles (defense boost), menacing magic quiver (high arrow speed, bonus damage, less ammo usage), menacing rifle scope (damage and crit boost), menacing ranger emblem (MOAR DAMAGE!), and a star veil (more stars like the holy arrows and keeps me from taking so many hits).  With this gear I just stood there and at one time had something like 5 pumpkings and 5 mourning woods going at me at once, and the lowest I ever got was around 300hp.   Would totally recommend."

Terraria,3drnd6,Kazuja,7,Sat Jul 18 22:51:50 2015 UTC,"It seems weird they haven't made throwing a full-fledged class when they added it. There's so many thrown weapons across the different classes, yet only shurikens, some knives and standard javelins are classified as such. Boomerangs are technically thrown weapons, and melee isn't exactly reliant on them anymore, with yoyos and projectile swords everywhere. Magic Dagger is a knife that's thrown, and it's not like mages would miss those with like 20 different spells to choose from with different strengths and utilities in Hardmode. Melee would cry a little about Vamp Knives being reclassified, but the constant nerfs to lifesteal(including, but not limited to the final boss outright disabling the mechanic) seem to suggest that giving the tankiest class such ridiculous self-sustain was kind of wack anyway, and they'd still have one other biome chest reward to use in the Scourge of the Corrupter(with perhaps a desert biome chest being introduced that covers thrower in corruption/melee in crimson worlds? I don't know, they seem to be working on expanding the desert, would fit right in there. Wouldn't make me feel quite as bad about killing all those Lamias at least. Isn't really necessary though).  Though, I do think that the set bonus you propose for the set should be something different. Throwing weapons right now seem very midrange, and like half of them got a very thief/ninja theme going on. Perhaps something that aids mobility or increases damage the more you move around close to the enemy without getting hit? It would help separate them from rangers at the very least: Ranger armor right now seems to envision rangers as long-range turrets with ridiculous damage potential if they get time and space to stealth, so having throwers be projectile users that acquire and draw damage from staying mobile and evasive, but still in the middle of the battle would make for a nice contrast, despite both classes being very similar weapon-wise. It'd still be better than homing capabilities for every weapon while wearing the set. Seems like the kind of thing only a certain weapon/ammo type should have. That Dusk and Dawn weapon you suggest for example could have an auto-sticking target projectile for example, detaching on too long ranges and increasing dps the closer you get(as the boomerangs have less distance to travel and return back to you quicker. Basically how boomerangs work right now).  Not sure about explosive class though. Pretty much all of the sources are either already summarized into the ranged class, could easily be integrated into the throwing class or are placed and really have not much of a business being boosted by any class. Both Event Horizon and Singularity Spike could easily pass as thrower weapons with and explosive component, in fact they could be gloves that use grenades and knives as ammunition, respectively. Kinda similar to what Skeletron drops in Expert, except, you know, actually powerful and useful. Blackhole-themed thrower weapons would even fit into the space-y theming the very endgame has with its weapons, making them perfect for being thrower's final tier."
Terraria,3drnd6,Kazuja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:49:04 2015 UTC,"The things that I tried to make special about these two classes is that Explosive has Croud control, and Throwing can deal a lot of damage in a short window of time. Explosive wouldn't be that good for bossing because of low damage, so their defense would be second to melee. It probably would be a good idea to put the throwing set effect into dusk and dawn, and just make a new one, not sure what it could be though. Didn't even think about the desert biome chest, that's a great idea, it could also use bones for ammo since it's in the dungeon. Either that or sand."
Terraria,3drnd6,Tetragen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"Mage already provides plenty Crowd Control and utility though, while still being great at bosses with the right spells(keeping the class from being cripplingly overspecialised, as beating bosses is an integral part of progression and making a class inherently bad at boss fighting would be frustrating). Making Thrower just about lots of dps would also make them too similar to Ranger, as Rangers already own the dps shtick with their silly lolfocusfire arrow spam shenanigans, guns that might as well shoot solid iron fists instead of bullets at the enemy and homing rocket barrages that should really be fired out of a tiny rocket-laden mecha rather than a puny rocket launcher. Dealing lots of damage is certainly something the class should do, however, the question to how high damage is achieved is very important as well, and is key to making throwing unique as damage type and playstyle.   Hence I'm saying that Explosives might as well stay more like a component of other classes and that Throwing should be about moving and evading a lot, as this is a nice way to give the class an identity separate from standard Ranger."
Terraria,3drnd6,daddy1973,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:15:32 2015 UTC,"I guess the only problem I'd point out is that Magic is mainly Status/CC, almost every spell either does puncture/multihit/aoe or does a status effect, so what would make using explosives better or at least why use it vs magic?  Edit: Not to say your ideas are bad, I love more classes and playstyles to be available, we just need some separation between them."
Terraria,3drnd6,Kazuja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:16:18 2015 UTC,"Mage here, I would definitely miss the magic dagger. That's one of the best magic weapons before plantera."
Terraria,3drnd6,Lightningbro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:28:41 2015 UTC,"You're not necessarily reliant on the spell though. Even early into Hardmode you're able to obtain a variety of different projectile types that can replace a magical knife for both normal mobs and bosses. In fact, the new Shadowflame Hex Doll does comparable damage, is just as if not even more mana efficient than the knife, can be obtained in a rather easy invasion(Goblin Hardmode. The mob that drops it is pretty much the only mob that can even harm you when you got to this point already, and they're more or less rare enemies, preventing you from getting swarmed by them), has a faster(but somewhat more unpredictable) projectile and even inflicts a nice DoT to boot. Once you defeat the mechanical bosses, chances are that the weapons that are unlocked through those will quickly replace the knife later down the line.  Every weapon would be missed by someone of that class, but I'd say that magic dagger is very replaceable for the average mage."
Terraria,3drnd6,superlink305,12,Sun Jul 19 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"While you art is amateur (No offence) your concepts are awesome, it doesn't make much sense to me either that the Daybreak is a melee weapon, and not an infinite use thrown weapon.

Glowing mushrooms really add up and you can use them to upgrade your lesser healing/mana potions.   As for Expert mode...it is hard. Better drop percentages but you aren't killing as much either.  Best feature is the unique drops/loot and treasure bags for killing a boss where you can get some cool stuff.  And even if you are going Softcore Expert, never carry a lot of gold.

Terraria,3duxlk,Buckybomb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:32 2015 UTC,"I was a summoner. The best strategy for me was to use use the stardust dragon and the phantasm (assuming you've attempted the lunar events which makes it HILARIOUSLY easy) and wooden platforms across the water. I had spooky armor with all my accessories set to warding and an ironskin, regen, summoners and swiftness potions on. That way I could get awesome DPS with my phantasm but let my dragon do lotsa damage to him.  Also, Phantasm with Ichor arrows makes the fight ridiculously easy. Especially when he's transforming into his final form at about ~8000 health. You'll tell when he's transforming when he stays still for 5 seconds.

I think a good way to deal with the canopy kinda getting blobby would be to a) make it more circular than ovoid and b) have more holes in it, where you can see the sky through?   Also, I'm assuming that's all leaf backwall painted pink, you could add some forground leaf blocks (also pink) to vary it up a bit - say, clumps around foreground branches.  In general, you might want to redo the branch system. you've got GREAT looking roots for your tree, gives a good sense of depth to it, but the canopy is less so. If you start with making a really good looking branch system, then fill in with foreground and background blossoms (which can totally go 'over' the branches in places iykwim), I think it's going to look fantastic!

Under the lava one i have an actuator to purge the tank so i can edit wiring without burning and destroying items.  timers   honey is on a 5s timer. lava is on a 5s timer (3s is fine but i've found that it's pretty dependant on the design. water is on a 1s timer.   how to improve   make is less ugly than mine. hide them away so they cannot be seen when you walk on the floor put a inlet pump inside each tank and wire it to a outlet pump in a place where you have smaller tanks so you can mine the mixtures (obsi, honey block, crispy honey) without having to crawl under those massive tanks."
Terraria,3dugt8,Ktesedale,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:00:20 2015 UTC,"I've done two different versions, and both have worked in 1.3.  First, the stair version - less space for storage, but it duplicates faster.  Wiring.  Second, the ledge method - more compact, and looks better, imo.  Slightly slower to duplicate.  Wiring (had to show it on lava, the water gen area has a ton of wires from teleporters going through it).  Both are the same idea - outlet pumps on the top, making the liquid fall over some sort of block, which duplicates the liquid.  It then falls to the bottom, where an inlet pump sends it back up to the top, all on a 1 sec timer."

Only thing that you may wish to reconsider is the 4 blocks of glass you placed on each side as part of the wall of the upper level. Even with the modern lanterns outside the ground floor doors, those 4 glass blocks seem out of place and do not match anything. They do well to break up the wood would could get boring, but maybe choose a different block? Just my two cents. Love the build."
Terraria,3ds46i,Guriinwoodo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was actually trying to give it a ""windowed"" look. I could also do 6 blocks of glass (remove the wood in between each 2 blocks), but like it is it turned out a tad bit better. I could try and go for a different kind of wood or such, but I only chose the glass since it looked more.. real? I'll give the other blocks a shot! Thanks!"

Terraria,3ds46i,Coctor,2,Sun Jul 19 03:04:51 2015 UTC,Do fences work as valid walls for housing? I often see wooden fences used as windows for dynasty type houses and it suits them well and easily colored depending on the color theme. Though I guess you're trying to come up with something different which would be great as I like seeing people use different blocks creatively.
Terraria,3ds46i,TheBeifongGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:56:38 2015 UTC,"They do work! If you want any proof, in my comment where I mentioned the tree house I made (and posted the link to the reddit post), search my last comment in the post, you'll see that three rooms have Wooden Fences acting as windows, and it is valid housing. I usually either go for glass or fences as windows, rarely do I leave it open. Glasses for formal spaces, and fences as more rustic or structural spaces, as seen above."

Terraria,3ds46i,iSekirei,2,Sun Jul 19 01:30:12 2015 UTC,I think Coctor means it's asymmetrical; you should add another lantern on the other side.

Terraria,3ds46i,countchocula86,2,Sun Jul 19 20:43:11 2015 UTC,Oh right; I see it now! Looks great!
Terraria,3ds46i,countchocula86,2,Sun Jul 19 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for some real criticism I can give you some.  First thing that comes to mind is the palm wood dead center of the building. It looks more like wasted space. I'd either empty it, extend your house by a few blocks and make that into a nicer (bigger) storage room or remove it altogether. Looks a bit out of place too.  The interior is also very scarcely decorated. There are plenty of furnishings you can choose from that include, but are not limited to, a bookshelf, lamp, sofa/couch, and piano. You can add paintings too.  Now, don't get me wrong, it's a nice looking house, but it's just a tad bit empty in my eyes.  This is all personal opinion so don't take offense to this. I was merely giving you your desired criticism."
Terraria,3ds46i,countchocula86,2,Sat Jul 18 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"First off, thanks for participating!   As to the furnishing, the typical Han Dynasty homes actually were very empty, and as you said, ""scarcely decorated"", it was only until the fusion with western concepts that they began turning into more densely packed homes.  The palm wood center serves as a break point between floors, and a way to place the lowest roof line (han dynasty homes have more than one layer of roof). The texture and color also resemble the filling they typically used.  I really did not search for any great -utility- in this house, as I have a bigger and more functional base elsewhere."
Terraria,3ds46i,____float,2,Sun Jul 19 01:28:43 2015 UTC,"I was looking more at how aesthetically pleasing the build was as a whole, versus historical accuracy. But at least now I know what you were aiming for.  I tend to furnish my builds with as much decoration as possible. Generally to give off the feel that it's a vibrant living space for my NPC's and a place a traveler may wish to stay at rather than pass by without second thought. So, I hope this gives you an idea where my point of view was coming from.  But anyways, lovely build and ultimately as long as you're happy with it, that's all that matters really. :)"

Terraria,3duaws,AspiringPRMajor,3,Sun Jul 19 16:36:26 2015 UTC,Kill the hands. As soon as you kill one he starts shooting skulls so make sure you kill them evenly. Once they are gone you can attack his head.  Dodge the skulls (either minecart or blocks over your head) Dodge his head (RUN!)  Kill his head. He goes down fairly easily. Definitely recommend either meteor gun or yoyo.
Terraria,3duaws,joshywantsyou,0,Sun Jul 19 15:51:42 2015 UTC,would it be possible with waterbolt? i dont like using meteor gun or yoyo's :/
Terraria,3duaws,AspiringPRMajor,4,Sun Jul 19 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"Possible? Probably but good luck  I usually love the waterbolt but in expert I've used it maybe three times, it just doesn't do enough damage from my experience. Last time I played which was quite a while before 1.3 and expert mode I would just fight the queen bee inside the hive and just waterbolt everywhere. Tried doing the same thing in expert a few times before I ended up building an above ground arena and used the slime mount for the quick vertical movement to dodge the bee's dashes.   I ended up beating her a couple times to farm with (if I remember my armor correctly) a full molten set, the molten bow with hellfire arrows and the slime mount. Make sure you're taking your potions too.   I beat the Skeletron first try with the same setup, just different mount and arena"
Terraria,3duaws,Beastly_Bubby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:07:18 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but it would require an arena where the bolts could come and hit him again. His second form shoots skulls which are pretty fast and, in an arena, might be difficult to dodge. EoC shield would be a must.   I'd recommend a diamond or amber staff as well. Bee gun set-up possibly. Might take a bit of practice but it's totally doable."
Terraria,3duaws,PM_ME_YOUR_A_CUP5,2,Sun Jul 19 17:15:11 2015 UTC,"QUEEN BEE  I used the fossil armor and the fossil throwing knives since they can hit the adds she spawns. The only accessories I recommend are the worm scarf and any double jump accessory. I opened up the hive a bit because the one I found was small. Make some platforms and make sure you have a heart lantern and a campfire for that increased life regen. I didn't have any buffs except for well fed. She starts off by charging you. So double jump up a platform and for the next charge, drop down a platform. When she shoots her stingers at you just serpentine and dodge as best you can. And when she sits still and shoots little bees at you is the best time to attack.  SKELETRON  A lot simpler to explain. I used Molten Armor for extra defense and used ""The Bee's Knees"". Super easy. I used my sky rail and kited him across my whole world shooting him with bees and he dies. Dodge the skulls as best as you can and that's it.  I also used this same loadout to beat the wall of flesh. One last thing, if you think your platform is long enough to kite WoF, make it longer"

Terraria,3dvqzu,DrYoshiyahu,6,Sun Jul 19 22:55:24 2015 UTC,I didn't want to break any altars so I just fished. Fishing can get you all the hardmode ores rather quickly. Skip right to full titanium armor. It is so amazing and by breaking no altars you don't have to worry about spreading biomes and random pirate invasions (which you can still manually spawn with pirate maps) I never broke one and I feel great about my choice.
Terraria,3dvqzu,falloffcliffman,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:07 2015 UTC,"since the birth of fishing, i haven't had to break altars ever (this actually helps contain the evil biome spread a bit believe it or not). just stockpile a massive amount of crates before going into hardmode and you'll be able to make a full set of hardmode gear with ease (if you got enough crates)"
Terraria,3dvqzu,dresden_88,2,Sun Jul 19 23:35:46 2015 UTC,"Personally I break 6. There are diminishing returns when breaking altars. You could probably get by on 3 alone. Be careful though... for some very odd reason, when I was clentaminating the corruption chasms later, some altars were being destroyed as I cleansed the stone under them. I'm not sure why. Around 5 more altars were broken for me. Has anyone else had this happen to them?"

Terraria,3du913,Birblicious,2,Sun Jul 19 15:07:10 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your world is corruption.  You might want to quickly run over to a crimson world, and acquire the vampire knives.  Other than that, build an arena in the ocean. I was having serious problems with the Duke until I learned that if you leave the ocean biome he becomes much more difficult. So build a platform about 100 blocks wide. Campfire, heart lantern, and maybe a small pool of honey.   Use a Nimbus rod, beetle armor, and a seedler. And your best summon. If you have them: destroyer emblem, warrior emblem, and fire gauntlet. Warding prefix if you can.  Really the key to killing the duke is dodging the sharknados, the Sharks, and duke himself. His movements are somewhat predictable. You should be able to dodge most of his movements with Leaf wings or beetle wings. The hard part is when he enrages at the end, becomes invisible, and moves very quickly. The trick is to DPS him as quickly as possible, and healing through his attacks. It's difficult to dodge him at this point.  It took me maybe 5 tries to beat him even with all those items above, and vampire knives. Just need to learn his attack patterns and improve your dodging."

Terraria,3du913,iron_mike_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:29:27 2015 UTC,"Stay in the Ocean biome. He is harder if drawn out from it.   I used an asphalt road that stretches across the ocean and beach with fires and heart lanterns. I used titanium armor  (for the shadow dodge buff) with megashark and cryp bullets. You could use cryp or shomite armor too. The homing bullets help so much. I used leaf wings and frost boots. And the master ninja gear (these are key Imo) I use the dash a lot to help dodge DF charge attacks. And the Dodge from the gear helps so much.   Key is dodging him. Be faster. His attacks become predictable, just learn his movements. Dash will help you dodge him so much. In his second phase, you can actually determine where the sharknados will spawn. He shoots a blue ball and once it hits you, the sharknados will spawn there. So make sure to get them to spawn at the end of your roads that way there not in they middle of your road messing shit up.   You're going to die a lot. Just learn his movements and the fight will be easy. Once you get the typhoon. You can farm him with that and spectre gear (hood) for life steal. Easy."

Terraria,3dvkdx,KillaJoke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"So I was out and about trying to clean up the corruption on the left side of my map with the jungle. However a martian probe was in a cave I was working on after getting a refill on fuel for cleaning.  It turned red and then the message popped up.   I rushed back to base trying to gather the best gear I could,then  flying to my arena, but it was of no use. No matter what I threw at them, no matter how tanky I though beetle armor was for me, and how powerful the chainsaw I got off of the solar event was, I was clearly outmatched.  No matter how many times I died the event wasn't ending, it continue'd to show the percentage at my home. I kept throwing myself at it over and over again trying diffrent build's I could think of on the fly, but then I noticed the boss couldn't shoot through blocks... So I went down to my shroomite house where aliens fell in the lake and got trapped leaving only the boss to deal with.  I sat inside the house plinking away with the Daedalus bow, but it was taking forever and a day as it kept moving back and fourth. Eventually I tried running through anything I could control and shoot out the door... And then I remembered I had picked up the piranha gun yesterday.   I would peek my head out the door when it shot rockets to fire my piranha at the saucer and scored a hit. Holding the left button for dear life and cowering indoors... I continued through the night, but man oh man I think I'm under-geared or just not ready for this level of the game in expert mode mentally. =/   If it weren't for that gun I would have been screwed."
Terraria,3dvkdx,Shonoun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:09:55 2015 UTC,Piranha gun is way slower than stormbow IMO. I ended up yoyo cheesing because I wasn't ready either xP

Terraria,3dsxes,PwmEsq,13,Sun Jul 19 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"The discount card I agree with. It's similar to the other accessories that function in the inventory like the GPS and such. Doesn't affect combat, just a convenience item. The other two, though...gold ring could really go either way, it's such a minor thing that it hardly matters. The lucky coin should definitely force you to sacrifice an accessory slot though. The benefits from it definitely warrant it."
Terraria,3dsxes,rynnamin,2,Sun Jul 19 03:55:09 2015 UTC,"Ya that's why I put the edit in, as I thought about it more its just a pain if its going to be like that when its only purpose is for swapping out for a second."

Terraria,3dvfo5,Quantum-Wizard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:28:43 2015 UTC,"it would be nice, but would require a lot more data to do so. but also would generate a huge amount of bugs and problems  on your way to pick up your dropped items, what if you pick up another item along the way and takes up a space what algorithm would determine which items dont get picked up and what new order is made?  also what if your playing online and 4 players die together, how would it determine which items get picked up would it only be your items? i can imagine this being full of bugs.  i think organization would be to taxing and would also remove a part of the game that didn't need to be removed, sure it is annoying but i believe that is the point.  like why not have all the caves already illuminated, its so annoying to keep placing torches.   or why not have the map completely visible at the beginning of the game since it takes way to long to explore the whole place etc.  it is an interesting concept but i find they may not think of making that change."

Terraria,3dvbn0,6e6f7420612063,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:01 2015 UTC,"There is no need to make a new world. The Cultists are always capable of spawning, regardless of modifications made to the Dungeon entrance. Even the nonexistence of the Dungeon (by artificially destroying it) won't prevent them from spawning.  It takes time for them to respawn. Wait for about an in-game day at the most and check again. Ensure the Dungeon entrance is off-screen and relatively far away from where you are. If it doesn't fix the problem, you may have encountered a game-breaking bug or the world hasn't received the flag for defeating Golem for some reason.  Speaking of which, have you double-checked that you met the prerequisites?  It is also possible for inadequate flooring to cause the issue. If the floor beneath them is not absolutely smooth, it will most likely cause an issue and prevent them from spawning. I'm unsure if entities occupying the floor get in the way or not, but I assume they don't."
Terraria,3dvbn0,OneMargin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:57:21 2015 UTC,"If you remake the flooring around the area correctly you can get them to spawn again naturally. However removing even 1 layer of flooring can keep them from spawning, so have fun testing for the correct height."

Let's say a large world has a 1 in 5 chance of having one (but I'm making that up). There are 3 possible items (counting the vanity set as one item). Each of these has a 1 in 2 chance, so 1 in 4.

Terraria,3dv7z7,r3dp,2,Mon Jul 20 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"You know how enemies will occaisionally drop hearts and stars (I think this depends on how much health or mana you lost) when killed?  I flipped the switch and the 1 second timer started the slime spawner where slimes were continuously killed by the lava they spawned on (there's a small pool surrounding the statue). When this happened they (the slimes) would often start dropping hearts (at a much lower rate than a normal heart statue) after dying. Plus I could also get lots of stars at the same time (more than hearts).   Every time I was badly damaged and or depleted of mana, I could race up the stairs and collect the fallen hearts and stars that were collected inside the box where the slimes were being killed.   This ensured I got an extra heart supply when my potion cool down was still in effect.   Its actually super useful for mage builds and you could fire from a weapon like the the demon scythe and if you stood close enough or visited the shelter/mob farm enough you would almost never have to worry about needing a mana potion ever.

At least, that's how I see things. Getting Silt works the same way because you'd need a LOT of it in order to make significant progress, as 1 silt only gives you 1 ore.

Terraria,3dv54t,Braedoktor,2,Sun Jul 19 19:49:24 2015 UTC,"I read from the comments you are fighting her underground. I highly suggest creating the Abeemination and fighting her at the surface jungle, with an arena. This allows you to see exactly where she is charging from and allows you more room for dodging and feels less claustrophobic (in my case). Also, I suggest using multiple layers of platforms for your arena and cover the middle one with spiky balls. This is so if you stand on the middle layer of platforms, she will charge at you straight through the spiky balls, taking a fair amount of damage. It also helps kill the smaller bees she spawns which charge at you, if you stand under the covered platform. It took me several failed attempts to realise this fight is a DPS race - as long as you can avoid her charges and bees, whilst constantly damaging her, you will be successful. Hope this helps and good luck to you both :P"

Terraria,3dvoiy,tirso12,3,Sun Jul 19 22:37:35 2015 UTC,"So many people in this sub doesn't seem to understand drop rates. A 1% drop rate does not mean a guaranteed drop if you kill 100 mobs.  AFAIK the calculation is done for every mob you kill and not cumulative. So everytime you kill Golem, there is a 12.5% chance to get the eye but it doesn't mean you're guaranteed the item drop if you kill 8 Golems.  You can kill Golem a 1000x and never get the eye or kill him once and do. That's how luck works sometimes.  (EDIT) Also RNGesus requires the sacrifice of a first born."
Terraria,3dvoiy,gnomoretears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:40:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if there really is a 12.5% chance of getting the eye of the golem, then that means there's an 87.5% chance not to get the eye. If 3 of us killed the golem about 15 times, then that's 45 treasure bags. .87545 is a .2% chance of us not receiving an eye of the golem after all this time. So either we're very unlucky, or the drop rate is not actually 12.5%."
Terraria,3dvoiy,gnomoretears,3,Mon Jul 20 00:00:02 2015 UTC,You still fail to understand that it's not a guaranteed drop. The only guaranteed drop is 100% drop rate.  I have a 1 in 6 chances of rolling a six with a dice but it doesn't mean I'm guaranteed to roll a six in six throws.  You can get the eye on the first kill but that doesn't make the drop rate 100% and you cannot get it in 100 kills but doesn't make the drop rate 0%.
Terraria,3dvoiy,gnomoretears,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"Obviously it's not a guaranteed drop, but it's still suspiciously low.

If you hold shift while your cursor is over some dirt, for example, it will automatically take your pickaxe out, and you can hold left click to mine without having to manually select your pickaxe. Works with torches, glowsticks, and axes. Also, once you've started using the pickaxe, you can let go of shift and it'll keep using the pick until you let go of left mouse button.

Terraria,3dtumt,HomoTerrariensis,4,Sun Jul 19 12:12:43 2015 UTC,"As for me:   no hotkeys for useful actions, like using magic mirror or rod of discord inventory still filling with rubbish quickly - especially there's no option to disable banner drops no way to lock your money in the piggy bank - it's still too easy to take it out by accident   I consider all these minor, it doesn't feel like it's anything game breaking. Of them all, I think that hotkeys would be the most important for me. Getting flooded by unneeded stuff is a big problem, but nothing that'd make me dead; only problem is that I might miss some items when collecting loot."
Terraria,3dtumt,JesusIsDaft,2,Sun Jul 19 12:18:59 2015 UTC,"My biggest concern has to be with class equality (Not balance).  Melee and Magic are pretty solid. My main issue is with Summoner and Range. Summoners get boned by the lack of Crits and the poor AI of minions. Frankly, I think the minion AI doesn't even need to change that much. Simply add a minion that can target multiple enemies at range, and it would mostly fix the problem. Damage and function can be balanced later, but right now they're just too rigid. The Stardust Guardian deals abysmal damage, and his use is extremely limited, other than utility-wise. Rangers have the issue of being boring. The newest set they've been given is a mild improvement over the old one, with the same ability. It's not very impressive. The SDMG is also visually unappealing compared to the Last Prism or Star Wrath. I need not state why. Furthermore, both of these classes have no form of healing. This has always bugged me, since protracted combat necessitates some kind of natural healing. Summoners could be expanded upon by having Support minions that only defend and heal, for example, while Rangers could gain life regen while in stealth. Neither of those would be too difficult to add into the game, and would make a huge impact on their respective classes. It feels weird having two classes that can only DPS, when they're already far outweighed by the Mage and his obscene Last Prism DPS. If you can't beat them, at least try something else."

Terraria,3dtumt,Danboy24112000,2,Sun Jul 19 13:39:55 2015 UTC,"Oh YES! It annoys me it's more efficient to store ores. But not only ingots, all the stack limits need reconsideration - with current amounts of content, it's hard to store lots of things stackable to below 100 - like seeds, plants, stars, etc. I tend to accumulate masses of those."
Terraria,3dtumt,pseudonarne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:59:44 2015 UTC,Maybe it should stack up to 150 or 200. Seems reasonable.

Because you have to not revive damage for a certain amount of time for your health to start regenerating of you had for example something like a frostbite debuff that continuously damaged you your health wouldn't ever regenerate until that debuff went away.

It told my the pirate invasion started and it appeared for 1 second and 1 pirate spawned into my trap then it disappeared! As soon as I went back to my main house in middle of world the invasion started back up(it was 5 minutes later atleast). Do you know why?
Terraria,3durik,Zartania,2,Sun Jul 19 23:33:46 2015 UTC,"An invasion will only happen/progress when you're near an NPC.  So if you build an arena for one, you need to have an NPC in a house nearby - a screen or two away at most.  On one hand, it's good because it means you can run away if needed.

Terraria,3dupk3,Vertixio,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:38:17 2015 UTC,"If you are fine with cheesing him, run a minecart track across the entire map with bumpers on either side, use the mechanical cart, buff up and just drive away from him while attacking with a seeking attack.  Put on a worm scarf, charm of myths and ninja gear, other accessories are whatever. This way most of his attacks will miss and you will have enough time for the potion cooldown to go away before you take too much damage.  Done that several times with shroomite armor and snowman cannon and has not failed me yet."
Terraria,3dupk3,ScM_5argan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"If i'll try doing that with magic weapons, is it better to use hood or mask?"
Terraria,3dupk3,ScM_5argan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:03:39 2015 UTC,"I dont quite remember whether or not his tether can catch up with the minecart but I think it can so you would probably be better off with the mask. Since you are going to use mage armor your defense will be lower than for my ranger so you will probably want to have warding on all of your accessories for the times his eye laser hits you (sometimes it does, sometimes it misses). I had lucky on mine but iirc shroomite armor has a higher defense rating than the spectre mask set."

Terraria,3dun9a,NightFantom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:30:23 2015 UTC,"Is the bug where it doesnt spawn when the cultists are at the dungeon fixed?   Technically it was intended, as the probe shouldn't spawn during an event. The cultists being at the dungeon is an event, thus the probe didn't spawn.

There is a chance that the Hallow could have spread through the Jungle (in fact, there was a thread on it just a day or so ago), and so could ave virtually not appeared at all. You could download a program like TEdit to view your map and see whether or not there's any Hallow.

If you're willing to do  the mech bosses in expert, you can get a mechanical cart. Build a big enough skyrail, and you can pretty much kite him around.

In theory, it should work as almost any class (Summoner wouldn't be able to, his minions would be constantly lagging behind).

Terraria,3ds6pm,Kirudra,6,Sun Jul 19 00:03:21 2015 UTC,"I actually like it this way. Here's my experience with ultra mega rare items:  Played one time from scratch; found the master sword (or whatever the name is). That was awesome.  Played another time from scratch. Jungle biome key out of the blue. Hell yeah!  Played this last time at 1.3. No biome keys! But I found my very first teleport rod thingy.  So every time I played again from scratch, I got a new ultra rare goody randomly that I'd never seen before. It's awesome all this time after I played from 1.1, seeing new things still that surprise me.  I really like the sensation of an old game still delivering new, fun experiences :)"
Terraria,3ds6pm,BurningCactusRage,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:07:47 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really good point. If there wasn't a wiki and I didn't know about most of the content, I'd have a lot more fun discovering it."
Terraria,3ds6pm,OldManInternetz,2,Sun Jul 19 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree. Theoretically, you could be farming for any item with less than 100% drop chance and it never drops. Or you could be farming a slime staff and 30 biome keys end up dropping. Rng is rng and that's what terraria and most other widely successful progression games are. It's simply boring to be given something. If you just got the key after 2500 kills, then people would set up afk farms to get the key. And that's boring."
Terraria,3ds6pm,Koalasonfire,2,Sun Jul 19 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"What makes your ""afk"" farms any different than when you do it otherwise? If the chance is 1/2500 instead of after killing 2500 enemies, you won't do it any differently. You'll still be farming in the exact same way, except you have no clue as to when you'll actually get anything. And it isn't as if you were just given it, you just killed 2500 enemies! What more do you need?   The only thing that RNG drops like this introduce is deviation. Most players will get their key around 2500 kills, but it produces cases like these where bad luck wastes your time. And that's boring."
Terraria,3ds6pm,Dizi4,2,Sun Jul 19 16:54:19 2015 UTC,Exactly. The idea that you may never get what you're looking for no matter what you do is much more of a deterrent than a definite reward after a certain amount of work.
Terraria,3ds6pm,itchylol742,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:31:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think the prospect of getting the key before 2500 kills is what makes it interesting. Just being given the key after 2500 may stop some players from even bothering (because they could have gotten it in a few hundred before, and the items they give aren't even that great)."
Terraria,3ds6pm,qwertycanary,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:55:34 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree, but the fact that vampire knives are damn near required for melee (And the other weapons are simply a bit helpful) makes me agree."

Terraria,3dt3zn,Suji_Rodah,7,Sun Jul 19 04:55:28 2015 UTC,"Phantasm is arguably the best bow in the game. Not only is it fun, but if you aim well, literally thousands of laser homing arrows will fire as well!  Vortex Beater isn't as good as the S.D.M.G., but it can still pack a serious punch provided you're using the right bullets.  There are now two items that make the Ranger class significantly less stressful: the Endless Quiver and the Endless Musket Pouch. Each can be crafted using 4 stacks of either 999 Wooden Arrows or 999 Musket Balls at a Crystal Ball (who knew a Magic item could have use beyond Magic crafting?!). It's a good idea to keep these in your inventory in case you run out of ammo, because that sucks when it happens.  That said, Phantasm really should come first, because even with Wooden arrows, IT STILL DOES TONS OF DAMAGE. JUST SAYING. O:"

Terraria,3dt3zn,SilverDeoxys563,6,Sun Jul 19 05:04:23 2015 UTC,"Also, the Vortex Beater fires a homing exploding bullet every 8 or so rounds, and it also seems to be spread out like a shotgun, so Chlorophyte bullets might still be a good idea to use with it.  Tsunami is apparently still good though, dunno how, but I sure do love my Phantasm. It's... phantastic!  someone please slap me for that one"
Terraria,3dt3zn,SilverDeoxys563,2,Sun Jul 19 05:09:45 2015 UTC,Just did the other two events with the Phantasm and love it.

You can try surrounding yourself with blocks to avoid the lasers that do 150 damage, even with max armor, but you'll still get barraged by the 3 INVINCIBLE True Eyes of Cthulhu that do 80 damage per attack when constantly ramming into you every 10 seconds, regardless of any blocks in the way.

Terraria,3dt3zn,TealHighwind,2,Sun Jul 19 06:44:00 2015 UTC,"I loved the phantasm. Then the nerf happened. They then said they fixed it afterwards, but it gets nowhere near the DPS it did before the nerf. I used it with holy arrows against Moon Lord and it does less DPS than the Vortex Beater with chloro bullets.  IMO Vortex with chloro is your best bet. Aim one way, then run the other until you run into the end of the map. Even better, make a railway, and have it bounce you back at the end of the track, and literally just keep shooting towards the Moon Lord until he dies, which depending on your setup, could take a while."
Terraria,3dt3zn,GolldenFalcon,2,Sun Jul 19 05:52:03 2015 UTC,"They buffed it up from underpowered status.  When they changed it the first time, ot was to fix a bug, but that bug was where the power came from.  Then they lowered the damage but increased the firerate by a large margin to compensate, bringing it to Vortex Beater levels of power.  It sits right where it should be, not as a ridiculous death stream, but not as a pitiful death stream.  Just a death stream."

If you dodge well and use a rod of discord to avoid his lazer you'll do fine. I recommend using the Vortex Beater (crafted with 18 vortex fragments) and chlorophite bullets. Good luck :)

Terraria,3dthvx,GammaGamer54,4,Sun Jul 19 08:24:32 2015 UTC,"I guess one of the main things is that you need to be able to dodge his attacks rather than tank them out. Personally I decided to create a big circle of minecart tracks so I would rotate around Plantera, so that it would stay in the middle and so that I would dodge its stingers.   Also, if you use this technique make sure there is no floor on the bottom, so that when Plantera drops the spike ball things you wont be affected as much by them (They bounce and can hit multiple times).   Also, wrath potions can be pretty nice if you have a corrupted world, and a few heart lanterns and campfires could help very slightly.  Thats my 2 cents, take it or leave it if you like :D"

With these two combined you could face-tank Plantera and kill it outright.  If you don't want to go through all of that effort then I'd reccomend using a minecart loop to kite the boss, using either your shotbow or a Daedelus Stormbow loaded with the holy arrows (make sure you've made space above your arena if you want to use the latter) to output more consistent damage.  Whilst you were correct about it's projectiles going through blocks, after Plantera transforms, it's arms and head will have a much higher amount of creepers attached, which would make the arena you have currently very poor as these creepers along with the boss itself will greatly limit your space."

Terraria,3dv7m2,Riisso,4,Sun Jul 19 20:50:06 2015 UTC,"Tedit is the program you want, and can do exactly what you're asking for. However, it's not been released for Terraria 1.3 yet, so it won't work with your world.  There is an experimental build of Tedit for 1.3 floating around, so you could look into that.  All that to say - is it cheating? Sure, just like an inv editor is cheating. That being said, I did the same thing when I got unlucky with two crimson pits right in the middle of my jungle...and then the HM stripe went into it as well. Sometimes when playing single player, the QoL is just worth more than the grinding...but that's just my opinion. I've played the game enough that wrestling with bad corruption/crimson/hallow generation just isn't worth it."
Terraria,3dv7m2,Waffolani,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:54:30 2015 UTC,How do you purify corruption with it? I downloaded Tedit for 1.3 and I can't see any settings anywhere that do anything to help.
Terraria,3dv7m2,Waffolani,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"Check the wiki for the 1.2.4 build.  It's got all of the information you would need.  As for purifying corruption, you'll most likely want to use the brush tool combined with a mask.  The brick type on the top is what you want to place there, and then one below the mask setting is the brick that will be replaced. So if you want to replace all ebonstone/crimstone with just stone blocks, set the top brick to stone block, set the mask to ""edit matching"", and set the bottom brick to ebonstone/crimstone.  Rinse/repeat for any other bricks you want to replace.  Note:  if you don't set the mask to ""edit matching"", it will just replace whatever your brush is doing to the top brick and will just ignore whatever your ""mask"" brick is."

Start with building boxlike structures but embellish them with extra towers, a proper roof, balconies etc. I like to make it so it looks like each room in a house has a function and make it look like an NPC could actually live there, but also to decorate according to each individual NPC. So for instance, the guide might have lots of bookshelves and items on display because he has to look stuff up for you, the Dryad has lots of terraria (plural of terrarium) and pots scattered about, because she looks after hurt critters and grows plants and the Nurse has lots of beds, stools (for waiting patients) and little surfaces with (medicine) bottles and books.

If I were you, I'd take one of the many great images you can find in this reddit, basically copy the structure, and (believe me you), you'll end up learning how to make the style. Literally, do it -THE SAME-. Afterwords, change it to your taste, wherever you like. Expand it, double it, whatever! However, try to start off with something small!  I don't know if this is apropriate or will actually help, but here's a small Dynasty house I made. Quick and simple, you just need the materials. But you can make it with any group of block types!

Most of the really nice builds you see require hours of work and planning. I consider my bases as a cross between aesthetics and utilitarianism, so they don't look super great but they have decorations and are easy to move through.

Terraria,3ds901,Deoxysprime,0,Sun Jul 19 07:46:18 2015 UTC,My general rule of thumb while I'm progressing is:   Primary weapon Pickaxe More weapons More weapons More weapons More weapons Magic Mirror/Recall Potion/Cell Phone Torches Platforms Blocks   At endgame most of my characters just have their bars littered with combat stuff. Here's my mage as of today:  http://i.imgur.com/LAWd4De.jpg

Terraria,3ds901,MistaCheez,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:08:04 2015 UTC,"I have a reason for all of my weapons.   Last Prism does maximum damage per second if I have the mana and accuracy to support it. Nebula Blaze has homing and hits enemies off screen easily. It's a solid choice for Moon Lord because I can more easily avoid his attacks using a long range weapon. Nebula Arcanum is less useful now that I have Last Prism, I could probably drop it. I used to use it to clear out large packs of enemies. Razorblade Typhoon is my go to mana-efficient spell. Sometimes I don't use Mana Flower and then if I'm low on mana I usually swap to this so I don't have to manually drink a mana potion and get Mana Sickness. Toxic Flask is there for fun. It kinda fits my character's theme even if it isn't the best weapon. That said, I don't use it much. It's handy for hitting through small walls though. Nimbus Staff sits in one place and does damage for me. I put it somewhere it can do damage without me worrying about it. I only have to cast it once in a while. Rainbow Gun is fantastic for clearing out huge amounts of ground based enemies. Just press the button once and it does respectable damage over a long period of time. Portal Gun helps me do mobility things.   9 and 0. Summons  You could be fine with two weapons. I just like having options and ways to maximize my damage output."

Beat Queen Bee 6 times, twice for every hive I found along the way, and got a full set of Ancient Cobalt + an extra leggings + 3 bezoars from all the hornets.

Plenty of each of the ores and bars, accessories, around 5 platinum in total from the crates + selling what I didn't need. It was great.   I went from Molten to full Titanium armor at the start of hardmode, with an Adamantine drill to help me out with my initial quarantining as well. I'll probably still break some altars eventually, but not as many as I would have without fishing."

Terraria,3dosjb,R3ven,11,Sat Jul 18 03:56:29 2015 UTC,How do I even
Terraria,3dosjb,WoodenGearSolid,2,Sat Jul 18 08:48:00 2015 UTC,That sounds like an awful lot of extra work. Isnt easier to just start hardmode?
Terraria,3dosjb,WoodenGearSolid,25,Sat Jul 18 01:25:09 2015 UTC,"Crates can give you all three tiers of hardmode ores and bars, meaning you can jump immediately to Adamantite / Titanium gear as soon as you kill the wall of flesh."
Terraria,3dosjb,Daevotion,12,Sat Jul 18 01:30:35 2015 UTC,Well yeah but that means you have to spend all that time fishing. I think i might have gotten 15 or twenty crates. I figured that was enough. I had enough to make some mid level armor an anvil and almost enough for a titanium forge. I'm just giving you my thoughts on it. Dont let me keep you from playing your way.
Terraria,3dosjb,DoomZero755,9,Sat Jul 18 01:34:35 2015 UTC,Just fish underground so you get armored cavefish. Stock up them endurance potions.

Terraria,3dosjb,Zechnophobe,3,Sat Jul 18 20:12:40 2015 UTC,"I had the same plan. I had ~120 wooden crates and corresponding number of iron and golden crates. I didn't have enough for Adamantite nor Titanium armor. But I made second best armor easily. And Titanium Sword was very welcomed weapon.  After you break all those crates, you'll have nice amount of gold and all the Master Baits you'll ever need."
Terraria,3dosjb,Zechnophobe,2,Sat Jul 18 08:15:36 2015 UTC,"So it's faster, except for the part where you spent 10 hours fishing with shitty bait? Hardmode ore isn't THAT hard to get."

Terraria,3dosjb,Sinroy,12,Sat Jul 18 01:36:40 2015 UTC,"The bigger thing is it means you don't need to break altars, which makes containing the spread of crimson/corruption/hallow much easier to deal with as you only have the initial V to deal with."
Terraria,3dosjb,blessedhellfire,4,Sat Jul 18 01:34:38 2015 UTC,"The crates also give you a huge cash boost, drop a lot of items to sell for more cash, and drop tons of potions. It's a pretty nice boost if you have saved up a couple hundred crates to open as soon as you hit hardmode."

Terraria,3dosjb,eienshi09,3,Sat Jul 18 04:18:33 2015 UTC,On my first world I found 4 or 5. On the one I'm playing with my friend we took quite a while to find one.
Terraria,3dosjb,forgotmypasswordzzz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:35:31 2015 UTC,Water-walking boots for me.
Terraria,3dosjb,eienshi09,12,Sun Jul 19 15:28:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've accumulated so many grasshoppers and worms (which turn into Enchanted Nightcrawlers) just running around with a Golden Bug Net even sans Flower Boots. They help but not as much as a Golden Bug Net. Just do missions every day and use the bait he gives along with whatever you catch just walking around. Keep an eye out for new moons where Fireflies spawn more often. If you have the full Angler set, earring, super line, and a Fishing and Crate Potion, you can get 15+ crates per potion period with a 300+ tile lake.  Good luck and godspeed, friend. May the bites be with you."
Terraria,3dosjb,BarkMark,8,Sat Jul 18 02:22:08 2015 UTC,"2 wide jungle block+pit around it+flower boots+yoyo=endless bait.  The boots regrow plants without you moving so you just aim a yoyo at the ground and it constantly breaks whatever plant is in your block while most (90%) bait either jumps or squirms out to the sides of the pit and falls into it to be collected.  Jungle bait is at worst like 15% bait and i think 40% at best, had nearly 200 bait in like 5 minutes just sitting there and yoyoing the ground with the boots on."
Terraria,3dosjb,forgotmypasswordzzz,8,Sat Jul 18 02:41:41 2015 UTC,"Fair to say, could that be made more efficient by subbing the yoyo for the Golden Bug Net?"
Terraria,3dosjb,eienshi09,3,Sat Jul 18 03:52:27 2015 UTC,The yoyo is constantly breaking the grass whereas the Golden Bug Net would only break it every swing.
Terraria,3dosjb,forgotmypasswordzzz,2,Sat Jul 18 10:17:28 2015 UTC,"Indeed, yoyo surpasses the golden net easily.  I think the yoyo tries to attack every single frame so most enemies get hitstunned out of taking damage constantly cuz the yoyo will bonk off, but the grass doesnt deal with that.  So it breaks like 30 grass a second or some shit.  I could be wrong though, but it seems to make sense."
Terraria,3dosjb,moonra_zk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:25:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm building my pit wrong but I seem to kill the bait more often than not... Could you provide an ""ideal"" pit for this tactic?"
Terraria,3dosjb,ThePrettySwellGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:31:44 2015 UTC,"I think my platform was 2 blocks wide with a 3 block gap to either side of it, and then it went down 3 blocks so i could walk underneath.  I also reinforced the walls of the pit and made them 2 blocks thick because i was noticing my bait sometimes glitch into them when they'd fly out and when it was 1 block thick it'd go through the block and fall outta the sky."
Terraria,3dosjb,IlIllIlllIllIlI,4,Sun Jul 19 13:43:46 2015 UTC,"Also, try to get a early Water Candle and put it in your house once a few NPCs have spawned. Since mobs can't spawn there, it'll raise the amount of critter spawns.  Just don't forget to remove it on Blood Moons/Invasions."

Had heard about some of the new items but could not get them to drop after searching for hours.  Seems the world I'd loaded was gen'd ages ago and apparently whatever it was generated with would not spawn items like the radar or the tally counter.  Had to gen a new world and go hunting to get them.  The worlds that were still on my system look like they were all gen'd after the last world wipe... had one I'd spent the time to recreate the Going Merry in a decently sized lake that is now gone. :(

Terraria,3dosjb,PewPewMeoww,3,Sat Jul 18 04:05:18 2015 UTC,Sonar potions ended my need for bait and my quest for flower boots. So glad I discovered them before I spent too much time in the jungle. The ingredients are very easy to acquire...I'm not sure if expert mode will change that but it probably beats looking for boots that may not even be on your map.

The NPCs were a few stories up. What I did was place a water candle that I could always see, and jump up to the base where I could see the NPCs but not the ground. After about 5-10s, I would jump down and there would be 1-5 worms crawling around. I ended up getting 70-something worms during one rain phase.  I think the main points were to be to keep the NPCs in sight which reduces monster spawns/increases critters, and having the ground just out of sight so that stuff would spawn into that nearby void.

Terraria,3drxls,earthtotem11,7,Sat Jul 18 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"This is my gardening farm.  Each row has only one type of plant, in the appropriate planter box.  I only harvest flowers that are in bloom, which means they yield seed, so the farm is sustainable. I keep chests in a row beneath the farm, where one chest is for the plant, and another for the seed for that plant. These pairs exist for every plant.   In the picture you can see some daybloom and some blinkroot that are ready for harvest, as well as one shiverthorn.  Flowers that are in bloom tend to take on a brighter appearance. The blooming blinkroot gets yellow flowers on the dark green background, the daybloom get a yellow flower at the top, and the shiverthorn is the blue one, whereas the others on it's row are either not in bloom, or not freshly seeded, and thus nearly invisible.  Meanwhile you can see two different stages of fireblossom (just above daybloom). Some being slightly longer than the others. These will be ready for harvest when the right conditions have been met - namely in the few hours before sunset. The shorter ones will not bloom yet, as they're not in their adult stage.  So basically - harvest ripe flowers, use the seeds they drop to maintain a healthy farm, and I prefer long rows of the same kind of plant, to be able to move left and right with a pickaxe to harvest the ripe plants, then I toggle auto targeting with CTRL and use the seed to replant in the empty spots. Note: This only works as intended if all the other planter boxes nearby are in use, or else you'll be planting the seed in any planter box with free space, which is not ideal.

It gives you more drops from blooming herbs and only lets you harvest if it's blooming. Harvesting when blooming is how you get seeds back to plant more.

Its the single corrupt block randomly placed when you break a Demon/crimson alter. With enough hellivators you can stem the tide and when you have broken all the alters you need to break you can then use green solution to clear everything. But it takes a LOT of money and a LOT of patience."

The design is something to be scared of when you start a new game, those pits are so abyssally deep it's almost not worth trying to jump over and it feels daunting.

If you respawned instantly then bosses would be incredibly easy as someone will always be alive during the fight to keep it going (altho this can depend on the boss).  Altho I totally agree when it comes to any situation outside of that. I find it hard to justify making the player wait 15 sec when you are just doing core things.

Most of the time I spent running back and forth in my arena, throwing spikey balls for the hands to go through. It takes them down in nearly the same pace so when one falls the other will follow shortly. For the head I concentrated on dodging the homing skulls. When the head comes spinning at you you can cover him in bullets. But don't get too close or you won't be able to dodge the skulls when he starts shooting again. Star cannon might work well too for that stage.  Hope I could help. For the trapping: Just stay away. If you get trapped you might be able to grapple out.  EDIT: Armored, not guarding"

Summon destroyer and watch him die in a minute or two.    You might kill him twice and with his souls make a megashark as melee/yoyo is going to have a tough time with twins/prime without a good ranged attack option.

Use that with crystal bullets or stormbow with holy arrows for the other two.  Now that you can't fish for a seedler, melee is tough in starter hardmode. But if you want to stick with melee, do what pepe said, but use souls of night instead, and make a corrupt/crimson mimic (be sure to fight it in the right biome). Then farm the mimics till you get what you need.  Crimson will give you a super fast, short range weapon (Fetid bagnakhs) and corruption will give you a fast, longer range one (Chain guillotines). I don't know if bagnakhs are good against anything but destroyer (Require tanking, even for him) but the guillotines seem like they could do the job.  And be sure to use the witch doctor's imbuing station. If you have crimson, the ichor vials can give you great damage (But destroyer is immune to most debuffs, sadly).

Terraria,3dpxs0,screwtehbilly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:16:51 2015 UTC,It needs to be kinda close to the ground if it is too high up it will count as the skybiome so they wont spawn.

Terraria,3dt7ex,vidyagams,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:12:21 2015 UTC,Something like that. But if you read again he does say that he actually did it without having the NPC houses implemented which means he had more space before than he does now.  So I'm really confused.

Terraria,3ds7zs,Koalasonfire,3,Sat Jul 18 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how early you are. I count ""early"" as pre-mech bosses. The Crystal Vile Shard only does 19 damage, and isn't worth getting at all. Assuming you're in Softcore, you could just try running around the Underground Ice biome killing Icy Mermen to obtain the Frost Staff, an incredibly powerful weapon that is viable until mid-hardmode. You could also try to get your hands on a Key of Night, made with 15 Souls of Night (be careful while farming these) at a workbench. You place the key into an empty chest and it will consume the key and spawn a Crimson Mimic, that has a chance to drop the Life Drain. Don't underestimate Crimson Mimics, they can jump screen-lengths and catch flying players so make sure you are good at dodging (they have 3,500 life and 90 damage). Also, the Golden Shower is a great weapon. Use it to lower a boss's defence, then attack it with your main weapon."

Terraria,3dopns,H0lley,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:38:08 2015 UTC,"pretty much, yes. it's the underground desert."
Terraria,3dopns,c0mandr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:30:03 2015 UTC,Cool dungeon though...
Terraria,3dopns,NEWVACHE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:30:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, in fact you have a shit ton of tiny piece of hallow scattered in your jungle. To be honest, I doubt your jungle will survive... :/"
Terraria,3dopns,I_like_your_unit,0,Sun Jul 19 02:09:15 2015 UTC,What the hell. My world is EXACTLY the same.

Terraria,3dopns,pseudonarne,0,Sat Jul 18 08:10:15 2015 UTC,"we need a hallowable/corrupt jungle...not this ""hallow has no effect and corruption destroys it but its ok because clorophyte now works like jungle cancer so it'll grow back"" thing  then this wouldn't be a problem, and neither would getting a corruption stripe through the center"
Terraria,3dopns,Explaorer,-1,Sat Jul 18 13:03:55 2015 UTC,CLEANSE IT WHILE YOU CAN :D Then make a contained artificial hallowed biome
Terraria,3drx2i,Koalasonfire,5,Sat Jul 18 21:39:10 2015 UTC,No. The jellyfish you can catch is completely different than the enemy jellyfish.      Side tip- The bait jellyfish have a low bait power but a high sell value. Even though you can use them it's better to just sell.
Terraria,3drx2i,Sentinel_P,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:51:38 2015 UTC,Might I suggest lightning bugs.  They're everywhere.
Terraria,3drx2i,MasterSaturday,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:26:28 2015 UTC,"the angler gives me more bait than I could ever consume  http://insane.li/uploads/snipped/55aafb6cbbcbd.png  so after completing a couple of quests, I don't see a point in farming insects etc."
Terraria,3drx2i,H0lley,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"Besides the angler and lightning bugs, can I suggest combining the flower boots + a piece of jungle grass + a yoyo?  Build a box around where you're standing so that they don't run away, stand in one place on the grass, use the yoyo where you're standing, and you can get a ton of bait in minutes.  The grass regrows as you stand there, cutting it instantly with the yoyo."
Terraria,3drx2i,Ktesedale,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:09 2015 UTC,Take this up another notch with the golden bug net from angler quests. Break grass and catch bait in one swing!
Terraria,3drx2i,heffroncm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:39:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, I suggest against using the golden bug net.  It's way slower than a yoyo at breaking the grass.  While using a yoyo does require you to go catch the bugs every minute or so, you're breaking the grass much, much faster and you save that much time and more."
Terraria,3drbwq,masterbunnyfu,2,Sat Jul 18 18:33:46 2015 UTC,Well we can't all come and go by bubble!
Terraria,3drbwq,laserBlade,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:51:09 2015 UTC,filling?
Terraria,3drbwq,pseudonarne,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:05:17 2015 UTC,"You can place liquids directly inside a bubble block, as opposed to surrounded by.  (But it doesn't survive exiting the world.)"
