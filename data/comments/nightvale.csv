nightvale,3e2y17,quackdamnyou,5,Tue Jul 21 21:59:13 2015 UTC,"And now, Letters from the listeners.  Dear Hateful Sludge,  Thanks for your letter. Allow me to me the first to tell you, you're not alone. Hateful sludge is a real problem this time of year, what with upcoming alignment.  Ooo! Before I forget, A reminder to everyone that this weekend is the Annual High School Play and Tribute to Maui the Time Shifter. Attendance is mandatory, except for those who have successfully participated in the ritualized slaying of a sin-eater in the past 12 months. Make sure to send in a copy of your punched sin-eater card to the Sheriff's Secret Police.  You might want to come anyways because I hear Night Vale High School's new Art Teacher, David Cronenberg, has whipped up an original, never been seen play called, 'The King In Yellow'. Should be a Hum-Dinger!  Back to your hateful sludge problem.  As we all know, hateful sludge is the physical manifestation of all the sins that no longer can be contained within your frail human form. You can expect for this Sludge to continue to manifest until you take the following corrective measures:   Molt - Now, I'm sure that you tried the obvious first, but it never hurts to start at the beginning. Just to be sure, even if you have already molted, do it again. Maybe you didn't do it the right the first time. Feed a single potato chip to a cat - Again, I'm sure you tried this, but did you use an Oven Baked Lays Original chip? The cat in question, Was it a Russian Blue properly cross bred with a Siamese so that it's harsh vocalizations were pleasing to Maui the Time Shifter? You may have skipped this step, what with the high fatality rate of this remedy, but you really can't move on to more extreme solutions until you've tried the basics. Seek a professional - If you are still having problems, then clearly you have been learning too much forbidden knowledge. You awful, awful person. I'm afraid you've gone past ritualized cleansing and appeasement and need to seek the help of a professional. Such a professional will surely betray your trust and report you to the Hooded Figures for the standing reward. So if you're a Do-it-yourself Handyman, or if you have run out of internal organs that can be harvested without perishing, you might try the following:      Pretend to be someone else - Since the Hateful Sludge cannot see, this is fairly easy to do. Just talk loudly about how you are now leaving and never coming back, then stomp away. Return some time later and speak in a different voice. Ask everyone to loudly refer to you by a new name that begins with an ""M"". Hateful sludge finds words that begin with an ""M"" quite pleasing. However, any slip up, and the Hateful Sludge will redouble it's efforts. It may, in fact, make an alliance with the mildew festering in your shower grout. So while this has been known to work. I really cannot recommend it. Salt - You might not actually have Hateful Sludge, but Demonic Effluent. It's a common mistake, for demonic effluent is actually quite rare. Sprinkle the offending substance with salt. If it reacts by releasing a screech that triggers memories of crimes you never committed, you got Effluent. This is easy to fix. Just search your home until you find your mephistophelian house guest. Usually he'll be hiding under a couch cushion or in your pillow case. When you find him, just look stern and waggle a finger in a disapproving fashion while saying, ""Okay. You got me. You got me good."" Your cloven-footed friend will then look sheepish and leave. Mint Enzyme Cleaner - This stuff is amazing. It's got live bacterial cultures that break down offending organic material and physical manifestations of sin and leaves a pine fresh scent behind in the process. Remember to alternate between spraying the enzyme and distilled water between scrubbing. It will take several days, but between enzyme and elbow grease, you should be able to clean up most minor outbreaks. Paint Your House Black - When all else fails, paint your entire house black, or replace your aluminum siding with any of the new patterns available from the new Jackson Pollock collection. It's a last resort, but if you are going to continue to be a wretched miscreant that is truly unworthy of love, and you are on a budget, painting is the way to go. May I suggest you call up some friends and make a day of it. Make sure to offer your friends something to eat. May I suggest the new Ancient Grains Pizza from Big Rico's.   Because nobody makes a slice like Big Rico's.  No One.  This has been, letters from the listeners."

nightvale,3dsz15,Lady_Groudon,3,Sun Jul 19 04:00:08 2015 UTC,"this is my very first fanfic ever so if you could read it that would make me happy and i would appreciate comments very much.  Content Warning:  This fic is about Kevin so use your imagination.   Okay. First off, I'm a blunt, insensitive jerk. However, I'm a highly productive, constructive jerk. So I'll be tearing this apart, but not without recommendations for how to put it back together. Your instructions we're to comment, after all. So if you were hoping for someone to give you a thumbs up and say, ""kewl!"" you posted to the wrong place, brother.  Tone: It's not WTNV. However, you didn't try coming across as a Fancast or an imitation of WTNV, so it doesn't have to be. WTNV has a writing style that includes Dada Moments. Reversal of Expectations, and Implied Horror. They tend to leave more up to the imagination. For example: ""It blinked three eyes at me."" Vs ""It eyes blinked. All of them."" One is accurate and descriptive. One says the same thing, but IMPLIES the existence of more then one eye. We say BOTH for two eyes and ALL is reserved for more then two. I'm not saying that you are writing it wrong. I'm addressing that you are writing a fanfic about a universe with an established tone and your tone doesn't match it. That's okay, just realize that you are going to have to work up hill. You can, in fact, use this to your advantage. The audience has an expectation, so you can subvert that.  That said, the tone you've chosen is much more… Revealing. The horror is right out there in the open. You slide back into the shadows a bit, about halfway through, but then the light is back on, shining bright. It's right out there. Horror is not as scary out in the open. Still, that isn't good or bad. It just is.  Goal: I usually start at the end. Where do I wish to bring my reader? Then I go to the beginning. I write. I stop. I review. Can I get to my ending? Yes? Continue. No? Write a new ending. Go back to start. Start all over. Yes, a great deal of material winds up on the cutting room floor, but I find it's much more powerful that way. I stay on target. The extra unused material I save for another day.  What's your goal here? I'm not clear about that. That said, the story could be part of a larger picture. This reads more of a prolog then a stand alone. Something you read to get you in the mood before you get to the real story. That part before you see the title screen and the movie really starts.  You need to look at your goal. Where you want to take the reader. Because you aren't guiding me. You are grabbing my hand and PULLING me through this story. Again, not bad. Not good. Just an observation. Is that what you wish to do? You alone can answer these questions.  Repetition: I try to avoid using the same word twice in any given chapter or section. Don't be afraid to use the Thesaurus feature available on the internet. That said, avoid Thesaurus Bukkake. Repeating a word is fine, but I usually do that to drive a point home. Not everything needs an adverb or adjective, but sprinkling a few odd balls can help you reinforce a tone you are trying to establish. You repeat some words without a clear point, and leave other words ""dry"" that are missed opportunities to establish tone. Again, is this you point? Where are you taking me?      What is it like having an eye sewn shut?   Good opening. However, this is my main problem with the story and where you trip at the finish line. ""What is it LIKE…"" You don't really answer the question. You describe it. You describe the effects. You describe HOW. You describe the why, and the process. But the LIKE. You never really describe the LIKE. What is it LIKE?  Now, as I said, in a larger framework, you could come back to the question later. In a stand alone, I am left at the end wondering what it's LIKE. Examples:  ""My third eye is shut forever. It is suffocating. It's like having your skin crawling with a thousand stinging wasps who leave your skin purplish and bloated, yet strangely numb. It's like have a six course meal at a posh bistro, after my tongue has been shot up with Novocain. Blinding doesn't even come close. Blinding is nothing compared to this.""  ""Everything was a rainbow with a million shades of vibrancies. Now I live in a world illustrated by a six year old with a beat up box of 16 crayolas.""  Consider adding the ""LIKE"", or saving the answering of this question for the epilog.   ""Until next time, Desert Bluffs.""  His voice was shaking, but he forced it under control.  ""Until next time.""   Thank you for avoiding the word ""SAID"". Mostly.  ""His voice was shaking, but he forced it under control.""  ""BUT"" - Avoid this word unless you seek to invalidate everything you just said. ""I like you, BUT you're nice"" vs ""I like you. You're nice"" See the difference? So, did you mean that his voice was shaking then it stopped? Which doesn't sound right for this part of the story. Did he suddenly screw his courage to the sticking place?  Sounds like you want: ""*His voice was shaking AS he forced it under control"" or better still, ""His voice shook from the effort to maintain decorum.""   Failed.  He had failed.  He knew that now, and he knew it because he could see StrexCorp’s people all over Desert Bluffs, and he could hear his neighbors screaming.  And because he could see a group of people, all smartly dressed in practical business casual, in the doorway of his studio, the door still bent and discarded where it had fallen as they took it off its hinges.   Now here you are establishing his ability to see with his third eye. I assume. Unless he has cameras everywhere, he's seeing all of this SOMEHOW. So an excellent opportunity to show what he's lost when he gets his eye sewn shut.   He had put a sign on it that said ""Please do not disturb!""  Maybe he ought to have looked up how barricades worked.   And a shout out to Old Oak Doors.   He clicked the button on the microphone into the OFF position; the ON AIR sign flickered out.   Ehhh…  See, here's where it's a bit dry.  ""His thumb hovered over the button on the side of his mike. With a flick, the ON AIR sight sputtered as if struggling before it went dark. The omnipresent hum of the equipment ceased as it died.""  Same thing, different flavor. ""Out"" should be used for loss by leaving/departure. ""Dying/Sputter/Dark"" is more for loss by an END. One implies it exists somewhere else now. The other means it exists nowhere. Again, your goal?   ""Kevin,"" said the person at the forefront of the group from StrexCorp, a woman, with a very large and important-looking name badge that said ""Lauren.""  ""You’re being very…uncooperative.""   Confusing use of quotes. We can figure out who's talking without the said. Save ""said"" for when you don't need to describe the character and nothing is happening. Said is only for when you want the reader to pay attention to what the character is saying ONLY.  ""Kevin…"" A large and impressive name badge that read 'Lauren' was being worn by a less then impressive woman who spoke for the flock of StrexCorp employees before him, ""You’re being very…uncooperative.""  However, I always thought she was one to say ""Difficult"" more then ""Uncooperative""   Kevin crossed his arms.  He continued to watch the last remnants of the rebellion fizzling out across town.   ""I’m afraid so, Miss Lauren,"" was his response.   A clinical description. You write what he did with no context/tone. ""Kevin Crossed His Arms"" Vs ""Kevin defiantly crossed his arms with a confidence he did not feel."" Again, your mission statement is about what it's LIKE, not what it IS. Get your Metaphor On!  Again, we establish he has a form of second sight.  ""was his response""? He stopped responding? Maybe, ""he responded""?   She clucked her tongue disapprovingly.  ""This won’t do, you know.  Productivity has dipped almost to record lows since you started your, erm…broadcast.""   Good. Describing how she's clucking her tongue is good.  ""You know"" should have a question mark or be removed. Is she asking him something or making a statement?"
nightvale,3dsz15,Captnq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:50:33 2015 UTC,"""Good.""  He had to make an effort to keep himself from flinching as he saw StrexCorp agents breaking down the door to his own apartment. His girlfriend was long gone, of course, but he had no idea where she had gone.   Uhhhh…  Kevin has Second sight thanks to his third eye. Continuity issue. Why can't he see his girlfriend?   ""Why don’t we fix this, hm?  It’s not too late.  We can find a way to get your productivity back up!""   ""Fix"" implies it's broken. Broken is bad. StrexCorp is positive! They don’t fix. They CORRECT!   Kevin was about to yell that they would have to physically drag him out of his studio before he would agree to anything they planned, but the protest died in his throat when he saw they intended to do just that—and worse.   ""Saw""? You are implying that his second sight can see into the future. Perhaps ""realized"" would be a better choice.  ""- And worse"" is a sledge hammer at this point. Ditch it.   The next few minutes passed as a series of impressions more than a logical sequence of memories:  Violence, his fist connecting with someone’s jaw—not Lauren’s, unfortunately—the sensation of being held down, dragged, Lauren’s grating and sunny voice saying not to worry, we’ll get your productivity back up, don’t worry, Desert Bluffs will be up and running again in no time, and you can even have your radio show back—   If you're doing stream of consciousness. Just do it. Disjointed. Needs smoothing.   A needle in his eye, his third eye, white hot pain blotting out his mind, erasing the images he was seeing of Desert Bluffs, breaking his link to the people, warping the voice he had used to coordinate the rebellion.   A needle in the eye is bad. The sudden reveal that it's his third eye is lost. Just make it, ""The needle entered his third eye. White, hot pain blotted out…""  Link? I dunno if that's the right word up to this point, because it REALLY drives home the question, why can't he see his girlfriend? The Radio station is the link. The third eye is more remote viewing up until this point. You're mixing your mythologies. Adding powers. Feature creep.  ""...searing away his images of Desert Bluff."" Stop. Leave it there. And use ""searing"" because is sounds like ""seer"", which is what he is.   Someone was screaming. Whoever it was must be in terrible pain.  Someone was screaming very close to him.  More pain next. All he could see was blood.  His teeth ached.   Okay, one sentence he's having a disconnect, the next he's over it?  Okay. Teeth reference. Good. Good.   Silence, buzzing of fluorescent lights.   Trivial information is good to toss in during SoC.   Shaking, he grabbed onto the corner of some piece of furniture—a desk, he thought—and pulled himself up.  The vision of his third eye—his mental mural of Desert Bluffs—was gone, replaced by a visage of gore, viscera, pulsing organs, slimy membranes, soft, spongy tissue expanding and contracting in death throes—   A bit of a sledgehammer.  I'd throw in a smell. Not a bad smell. Like the faint smell of vanilla. Again, a shout out to Episode Glow Cloud. Vanilla is the smell of memories being erased.   He screamed again, and this time he knew it was himself screaming.  All he could see was blood.   So he has having a fugue state, came out of it, then came out of it again?  And no, he can see gore, viscera, Blah blah. Not just blood. Why the sudden change from a cornucopia of innards to just blood?   The vision in his other two eyes began to clear up after a few moments, but it was dim, and he had to wince, as though there were a very bright light source dissolving all the shapes in the room.   You need to be more clear about this being the Smiling God.   He couldn’t open his eye.  When he tried, he was rewarded with the sensation of his eyelid pulling against something keeping it in place, and a shrieking, stabbing pain washing over him, the blood in his mind’s eye pulsing in rhythm with it.   Which eye? HIS eye? Which HIS eye?  We know he's trying. Don’t tell us twice. ""*He couldn't open his eye. He was…"" Extra words are extra work for your reader. It's a story, not a marathon.   He was blind. No, not blind.  His shin banged on the table, and he fell again, the white-hot-lit room spinning as he did so, and he felt his jaw crack against the floor, and was it possible for teeth to hurt this badly, his teeth hurt—   ""He's blind. No, Not Blind."" … and? The rest of this paragraph has no connection to the first two sentences. HOW is he not blind? Back to my original point about your lack of explaining what it is LIKE.  ARG! The rest of the paragraph is good, then you trip. Go on about the TEETH! Explain the TEETH. Why does Kevin love TEETH? Why do they call it tooth paste if you brush more then one tooth? It should be called TEETHpaste!   All he could see was blood, and he heard screaming faintly, not his own this time, and not with his audible hearing:  it was the death rattle of the town of Desert Bluffs, and his third eye was dying with it.   Again, all he can see is blood. But he wasn't blind a moment ago. Then his vision cleared. So, to recap, He can see:  Desert Bluffs, White light, blood, Fleshy Bits, Blood, Cleared up, White light, Blind, Not Blind, Back to blood.  Nice metaphors, but you are being redundant and it's a strange order to have things in. Why back to seeing only blood now? Now, if he was already tearing an intern into little bits and playing hopscotch in her ribcage, I'd understand, but he doesn't do that for three more sentences.    Everything hurt, and his vision was filled with blood, and he was starting to panic, because he couldn’t see, he couldn’t get the pain to stop.   Maybe he could be blinded by pain instead of blood at this point?   ""Kevin?"" He felt a hand on his arm.   You need to make me care about that hand. I don't give a rats ass about this hand. Make me love this hand. Make me want to protect this hand.  ""He felt a hand touch his shoulder like a concerned lover or over protective mother.""  Now I care. And it implies he's about to kill his girlfriend. Maybe you could add that part. Brianna is his girlfriend. you bring up a girlfriend then forget about her. Don't mention something you aren't going to use.  She's Chekhov's Girlfriend. You gotta kill her off. Kevin needs to do it.   He lashed out instinctively, felt his hand tear into someone, hard, felt a warm, sticky, substance rolling down his arm, heard an exclamation of pain, the thump of a body falling to the floor, and his own hands tearing into someone of their own accord with strength he had not known he possessed, feeling hot and wet organs sliding past his skin, hearing himself making a moan, feeling the pain receding.   Nice description, but I don't care.  If you make Brianna his girlfriend, make sure to mention sometime near the beginning that for some reason his girlfriend is hidden from his second sight.   His vision began to clear.  He looked down.  He was elbow-deep in intern Brianna, her face frozen in a look of shock.   Why? Time? The pain only goes away when he rummages around inside someone's chest cavity? I'm not sure if you understand your own internal consistency here.   The blood all over him finally matched what he saw in his third eye, and the pain was dimming, and his teeth hurt, but he couldn’t pull them out, so he pulled Brianna’s out instead, and that made him feel a little better too.   I get how you're trying to tie it together now, but you either need to go Blood (like, nothing but blood), or save the blood-vision towards the end. If you go nothing but blood, you lose out on the opportunity for TEETH! Teeeeeeeeth. Say it with me in a long drawn out hiss.  teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeth  Good. Gooooooood. You're coming along nicely. The teeth love you. The teeth are your friend. You have so… many friends. In your mouth. Each and every tooth loves you. But individually, a tooth is nothing if it doesn't have a tooth to come down hard against.  That's why we come down so hard on you. Because alone, you are but a single tooth. But together, we can bite. We can sink ourselves into warm, soft, yielding flesh. Imperfect flesh. Tear the imperfection away. Use it to become stronger. We all want to be stronger… don't we? You're Desert Bluff's Central Incisor. You are the front tooth of the community. We need you. We are the Teeth of the Smiling God!  TEAR THAT FLESH AWAY!  CONSUME THE IMPERFECTION!!!  We will CHEW our WAY to a BETTER DAY!!!  Uhh… Err… Sorry. Where was I?"
nightvale,3dsz15,Captnq,2,Sun Jul 19 08:50:59 2015 UTC,"And when he was done, he curled up under his desk, fetal-style, and wept, because the pain had started to come back as soon as he had finished dismembering the intern.   I don't know if you want the pain coming back as soon as he finished. It has longer term implications. It's pointless.   ""Kevin?""  He looked up, mistily, and saw Lauren in the door, her hand on the knob.  ""Are you feeling…like you’ve reached your full potential?""   Why would she care how he felt?  ""Have you reached your full potential?""  NO FEELINGS. It's StrexCorp.   He looked back down at the bloody handprints all over his pants, the puddle of blood on the floor, and remained silent.   Handprints? Like… Making a Hand Turkey? The blood would be smeared. A blood puddle? It's… just not working for me? Especially since he's under a desk. Maybe a trail of blood, leading up to his blood smeared suit?  Althought making hand turkey's out of blood would be creepy.   ""Are you going to be a good member of the StrexCorp family this time?   ""This time"" implies he wasn't a good member of StrexCorp at some point. That's bad. He was always a Good member. ALWAYS.   ""Are you a Good Member of StrexCorp?"" Done.   The only sound was the buzzing of the fluorescent lights.   See? Another opportunity to tell me what it's LIKE and you pass it up.   ""Kevin, your show is scheduled to start in 20 minutes, you know.""   Who's talking, by the way? Lauren? Smiling God? Kevin's Fractured Psyche? Brianna's Corpse? Now that last one would be creepy. If the dead intern was talking to him. Like, if Kevin had a dead intern in his head, always helping him out… A smiling Intern…   He had just finished his show, hadn’t he?  His mind was beginning to fade, lost in fog.  It felt like there was a floodlight shining directly into his brain.  The room was beginning to swim in brightness again.   Okay, he's in a fog, but it’s a bright fog? I'm really lost in how his various states of mind work. Your lightning is lacking internal consistency. What's your narrative point?   His show, right. He had…  Didn’t he have something to say to Desert Bluffs?  He couldn’t remember.  He didn’t know what Desert Bluffs needed to hear, because he couldn’t see them.   I dunno... Can't put a finger on it. It's... meh.   Oh.  He found some instructions on his desk.  They were under Brianna’s intestines, but they were mostly still readable, and he felt like he could manage to do that at least. He couldn’t start the show late, after all, not even if he was sick.   Meh. Maybe instead the light filling his mind lets him know what he has to say? Or Brianna hallucination lets him know the instructions are under her intestines. And hey, maybe you should bring those along to the booth? They might help brighten up the place.  Along with her teeth.  Ooooohhhh… Yes. Teeth.   Sick…  Was that it?  Yes, he felt sick, but he couldn’t remember why…   Uh, why does he feel sick? Little fuzzy on that.   The squish of organs under his shoes was oddly comforting, and he found himself beginning to muster back some of his old cheer.  He had to push a hand out of the way so he could roll his chair back over to the desk.   Push? Uhh… Wait. He's under the desk, He's standing and clearing Brianna off his desk, now he needs to push a severed hand out of the way so he can roll a chair? Did he get on his hands and knees to push a hand?  Maybe ""kick"" instead?   He flicked the button on the microphone to ON, and he managed to suppress the tremor in his voice as he began.  ""Good afternoon, Desert Bluffs.  We have a new sponsor today, as I’m sure you’re aware…""   Why Suppressing Tremor?  Not a new sponsor. New management.   No one in the new version of Desert Bluffs was ever quite sure what had happened to Kevin.  He sounded much the same as ever on the radio, except that it took him a while to build himself back up to how cheerful he had been before the StrexCorp takeover.  Most of them knew, silently, that it was punishment for leading the citizens’ rebellion against Strex, and that it was to ensure it didn’t happen again.  It had the intended effect.  Those interested in rebelling came to Kevin the same as they had before, except this time they didn’t come back out again.  And slowly the memory of peace faded, and everyone began to think that maybe, the walls of the radio studio were supposed to have been red all along…   Actually, being cheerful should be almost automatic. Building himself up implies that he's fighting it. Smiling God basically crushes you without mercy.  Why would anyone trust Kevin with his Third Eye sewn shut?  Memory of Peace? No no no. everything is peaceful NOW. It was so much worse before. Now everyone is aligned perfectly. True, some times in order to get teeth to line up properly you need to use braces. So some people need to have brackets welded onto them. Anyone can put in their place with enough hooks and archwire! So trust me, things are so much more peaceful now. Don't you think?  Trick Question!  A good tooth doesn't think."

nightvale,3dq9iq,12hatch,4,Sat Jul 18 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"This is my rant:  Dude you have no idea. It feels so good to finally see person to recognize this. The show sadly drops in quality a little around episode 20 but it's still is listenable. It sort of goes on for a while then in episode 49, the big ""event episode"" it doesn't so much take a nosedive then to crash into the ground and piss on its corpse.  I gave up listening somewhere in the fifties. it becomes very cringy. Everything that made Night Vale great is completely erased from the writing. All the clever, humourous, creepy lines and stories becomes becomes tiresome memes, pandering to lowest dumbest portion of the fanbase. No new jokes are written, everything is a reference to the earlier episodes, when the show was good. As if mentioning something equals to a joke.  The narrative itself becomes a character drama worthy of soap operas. They become infinitely annoying and smug, and the writers only but scream at you LOOK HOW PROGRESSIVE AND INCLUSIVE WE ARE. WE ARE NOT A SEXIST OR A RACIST GET IT WE ARE SO GREAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND ALL THE HOMOSEXUAL INNUENDO IN THE SCRIPT JUST TO MAKE SURE WE WILL REMOVE ALL SUBTLE WRITING TECHNIQUES AND IMPLIED HUMOUR  i really shouldn't care but welcome to night vale was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD when it begun. I don't know what happened but surely the creators must have understood all the elements that made it great.  But what the fuck do i know? the podcast is more popular than it has ever been and the fans are more obnoxious as well. Maybe they've pulled that teenage tumblr demographic. That would explain a lot.  (If you disagree, fucking fite me irl m80)  P.S: listen to SAYER if you want something in the spirit of the early WtNV. It's quite good."
nightvale,3dq9iq,TheSoundOfHerWings,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:47 2015 UTC,"I recommend you watch Episode 67 - [Best Of?]  It take a little break from the character drama and goes back to its roots a little bit.  That said, it goes right back to character drama after that in the next episode."
nightvale,3dq9iq,LvLupXD,2,Tue Jul 21 06:58:35 2015 UTC,"I honestly think if Old Oak Doors hadn't been done in a live setting, it would have been much better.  It seems like they've figured that out too, since they've been keeping the live shows separate ever since.  As for the more linear story elements, I think it was probably necessary to keep the podcast alive.  While the crazy randomness of the first 20 or so episodes was wonderful, people likely would have lost interest if there was no overarching plot to hold their interest.  This being said, my qualms are with the content of the stories; I enjoyed the desert otherworld well enough, since it fit with the theme of the mysterious town where weird things happen.  The recent arch however, I felt was subpar.  As you say, it felt like a soap opera that happened to take place in Night Vale, and the broadcast turned into Cecil's Blog rather than Night Vale Community Radio.  This flies in the face of a lot of stuff, including Cecil's own words in episode 16: ""Well, hey, I don’t like to talk too much about my personal life here. This is your community news station, not Cecil’s Personal Life Station, right?""  I do also agree that since around episode 20 the writing in general has only gotten worse.  They don't really seem to spend any time on new gags, and as you say most jokes are references to old ones, which have pretty much been exhausted at this point.  I'm still crossing my fingers for some new episodes in the spirit of the old ones, but aside from [Best Of?] there hasn't really been anything to indicate that they're still capable of cranking out the quality like that.  I would second listening to SAYER as well as Kakos Industries.  I'm not that far into SAYER yet, but I can say that I'm just about caught up on Kakos, and they've managed to maintain their tone and style through the 35 episodes that are out right now."
nightvale,3dq9iq,aroes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:18 2015 UTC,An overarching plot would have still been possible simply through news reporting. You've articulated the problem perfectly when you say it turned from being NIGHT VALE community radio to CECIL's personal audio diary.  Ahh... How upsetting...

nightvale,3dq9iq,foxy1604,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"It's mostly because the first 20 episodes were so heavy in introductions to characters (all of which are hilarious, like glow cloud) and episodes were mostly 'story of the day' and had little continuity.   That format was enjoyable, but I don't think it'd survive 80 episodes of it. It's now a lot more about over-arching plots with periodic episodes with little continuity. Maybe it's less distilled in its 'night-valey-ness' but we also don't have 500 characters and the jokes have a lot more building up to them this way, I think."

Only one publisher will get my book/movie references?

nightvale,3cx0bn,Captnq,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:43:46 2015 UTC,"Hrmm... Not bad.  Here. Tossed up a few ideas to help you round things out. Simply saying ""The others don't matter"" is just being lazy. The devil is in the details and so is being a DM. Don't take my choices at face value, but change them to fit your campaign's specific needs.    Aries - Today is a great day to be upbeat and show off that magnetic personality! Literally. For some reason every electron in your body is now pointing in the exact same direction and you are attracting Ferris metals. Great time for finding metal on the beach! Bad time for entering water deep enough to drown in. I would be concerned about the toaster. Like. Now. DUCK!  Taurus - You are in no mood for chit-chat and anyone who wastes your time with silly gossip will be told to keep quiet. You are beginning the process of turning into a librarian. Soon every sound above a whisper will sound like nails on a chalkboard. Your bones will twist and contort. You will crave unnatural things. You can avoid this if you but find the book that you read containing the librarian curse. Expose it to anything from the Learning Channel involving Honey Boo Boo. No matter how much it begs for mercy, be strong until the book completely burns away. Since this will happen to any book exposed to such nonsense, you must be sure you got the cursed book. You might want to do it to every book you own. Just to be safe.  Gemini - Normally you're the one who gets stuck with all the weird duality crap, but today you're off the hook. Find a Capricorn. Point at him. Laugh. Remind him about what happen last week when you begged him for help and he abandoned you in your time of need. Good day for kicking Capricorn while he's down.  Cancer - Today is going to be a good day. That's all it says. The day, will be good. Just the day mind you. As soon as the sun sets, however. Ohhhh... when the sun sets... <<deep chuckle>> When the day ends... oh. I am counting the minutes, Cancer. The Seconds. Every tick is scrumptious pain. Every moment brings us closer. That moment when your good day... your very good day. One might even say, the last perfect day. That oh-so undeserved GOOD day... Enjoy it. Because it's hands off until... well... you know.  Leo - We all have aspects of our personality that we usually do our best to hide or ignore. Everyone has negative qualities, but not you. You are simply perfect and awesome in every way. It's a great day to walk around and remind people just how awesome you are and how everyone's lives are a little better, just knowing you. Try standing in the middle of the street, shouting it for everyone to hear. They'll thank you for it. There is no down side.  Virgo - You did not arrive at your present position by chance: it is all part of the grand design. And part of that grand design is knowing when to help others move to a position of greater responsibility. Keep an eye out for underlings who show personal initiative. Today would be a good day to promote someone from a position of unimportance to a job more befitting someone of their talent.  Libra - “Seeking justice for imbalances in the world and concerned with relationships and appearances.” That’s what Wikipedia says about you, Libra. Well don't worry about appearance, for soon your face with become contorted with rage as you are filled with an overwhelming desire for vengeance. Your ability to judge what others call a ""proportional response"" have gone right out the window. Speaking of, when was the last time you saw that very expensive parakeet you bought? The one you saw your neighbor's cat eying last week? Might want to go looking for it. Take a weapon. I heard the owner of that cat is hanging out in the middle of the street bragging about something.  Scorpio - Life sucks. Everything Sucks. Everyone Sucks. Anyone who walks around smug about their perfect, flawless lives needs to experience the joys of being on the receiving end of vehicular manslaughter. Trust me, they have it coming. You'll be doing everyone a favor. After all, life is nothing more then a meaningless series of accidents and nothing we do matters. How would anyone know it was intentional anyways?  Sagittarius - Sales are sagging at the newspaper you work at. Know how you get stuck all the time writing stupid horoscopes that nobody cares about? Not only is today a good day to take a camera and hang out on street corners looking for horrible auto accidents, but there's a good chance you'll finally get that promotion and get out of this elephant graveyard of a department where careers go to die! If things don't work out, buy a shotgun. Saw off the barrel. It's too long for what you'll need it for.  Capricorn - <<even>> Capricorn, there is generally a list of traits which describes each sign flawlessly, leaving no room for doubt. There are always some good… and some bad. <<lighter>> You have been known to be responsible, patient, ambitious, resourceful, and loyal. Today, you will be none of those things. Instead, today you will only embody the negative qualities associated with your sign. <<darker>> Good luck as you flounder through the day, dictatorial, conceited, inhibited, distrusting, and unimaginative. Your color scheme will become inverted. Everyone will think you are using your left hand when you know it's your right. Every single word in the world will seem to be a mirror image of itself, but nobody else will have any problem reading. Your doctor will think your heart is on the wrong side of your chest. But you'll know. You'll know the truth. It's not YOU who has gone mad, but the rest of the WORLD. <<lighter>> Enjoy your time away!  Aquarius - What’s done is done and cannot be undone, so forget the past and think only of the future. The choices you make this weekend will influence your life for years to come. Just because someone has strange fetishes is no reason to finalize that divorce. Your Ex is about to get a promotion and get a real job and stop being a joke, so you might want to give him a second chance. If you go on that long weekend with your lawyer, everyone will think you're a Jezebel.  Pisces - If you go out with that woman who you were helping through her divorce, there's a good chance someone might blow his brains out in your bathroom while you are gone for the weekend. Do you really want a tortured soul haunting your home? Think about what it will do to the resale value.    As you can see, I added in the other horoscopes you didn't use and made a little on going story about a worker who writes horoscopes trying to get promoted by manipulating people to kill each other in a public fashion while also trying to save his failing marriage. Slightly funny, but down right creepy. Basically, Night Vale."
nightvale,3cx0bn,Captnq,2,Sun Jul 12 06:46:26 2015 UTC,"It actually wasn't being lazy, it was intentional. It's a one-shot rather than a full campaign, and I don't want my own narration to take too much focus away from the players. I'm doing little snippets of it throughout. I was afraid that sitting there reading for fifteen minutes would get too boring for the players, so I was only doing horoscopes for the players in the group. Besides, I don't like to be too rigid as a GM, either, so I tend to have pretty free-form stories. I don't want to constrain it too much to a linear story, either.  That being said, I had still considered writing the others for fun and I'm loving your additions!"
nightvale,3cx0bn,Captnq,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:08:39 2015 UTC,AH.  I forgot. One of the perks of working nights staring at sleeping people is that you have a great deal of time to write and access to a printer. Not everyone basically has unlimited access to office supplies. I do a great deal of handouts.
nightvale,3cx0bn,Captnq,2,Sun Jul 12 19:38:02 2015 UTC,"Nice, nice. What do you find it adds to your GMing style? I've never really used handouts, but I could definitely see how they'd help. My style has always been to develop a pretty detailed world and then throw the players in a sandbox with a vague idea of where I want the story to go, but I try to improv a lot and let them tell me what they want to see from the game."

Also, lots of glow bracelets and necklaces. This one was definitely more involved as far as costume pieces go, but I already owned the corset so I just built the idea around that.  I bought the pants on Etsy in the spring. They do run a bit large/loose in the waist (they kept falling down, and I didn't think to get suspenders) so I'd order a size down if you buy them."

What is it?"" and he had just said to me that he was my age and I felt so old. I asked my dad if he had heard that song and he said he didn't recognize it.

nightvale,3c41cg,Captnq,-2,Sat Jul 4 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"Anything more then a year old is no longer a spoiler.  Seriously?  Are you REALLY asking people to post spoiler alerts for information that was released Sept 1st 2013? This is a serious question. I would actually like to know at what point information is no longer ""spoiler"" for you. I am genuinely curious."
nightvale,3c41cg,VisiblyRetarded,3,Sun Jul 5 00:42:34 2015 UTC,"SPOILER BELOW  In the most recent episode (70A), Kevin renames the Desert Otherworld that Carlos has been trapped in with the Masked Army to Desert Bluffs, because that's Kevin's home now.  Please get off your high horse."
nightvale,3c41cg,z500,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:02:37 2015 UTC,I had no idea. Hadn't gotten there yet. Spoiled.
nightvale,3c41cg,Captnq,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"Then that shouldn't have been a reply to z500, it should have been directed at GiovanH. Although, I never would have made that leap myself.  And Veracity is never a sin."
nightvale,3c41cg,VisiblyRetarded,2,Sun Jul 5 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"They both gave details. Just because you didn't make that conclusion, doesn't mean no one else would. Three others have, clearly.   Veracity is never a sin   No, but being arrogant and pedantic is."
nightvale,3c41cg,GuesssWho9,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:47:55 2015 UTC,"Quite.  Or New Desert Bluffs, at least."
nightvale,3c1r86,GuesssWho9,8,Fri Jul 3 23:28:25 2015 UTC,I'm frightened just from reading the plot summary.
nightvale,3c1r86,Murwiz,4,Sat Jul 4 02:30:54 2015 UTC,"It's not that violent, just mind-bending."
nightvale,3c1r86,Andyman117,2,Sat Jul 4 03:19:55 2015 UTC,"Just like a good episode.  Or alternatively, a good SCP"
nightvale,3c1r86,devancheque,7,Sat Jul 4 07:59:30 2015 UTC,"I remember watching this because it often came up in the WtNV fandom, but honestly, it didn't feel all that similar. It was more like one of the darker Doctor Who episodes. An intriguing outlandish mystery with a conflicted charismatic man at the helm of the story. Definitely a must watch and one of my favorite horror movies ever, but doesn't have a lot of resemblance with WtNV apart from the setting, in my opinion."
nightvale,3c1r86,mrstrangecharm,5,Sat Jul 4 11:10:07 2015 UTC,Love this movie. Its got a very cool idea.
nightvale,3c1r86,CitizenWolfie,2,Sat Jul 4 02:06:48 2015 UTC,"It's really rather philosophical, isn't it?"
nightvale,3c1r86,ShroudofTuring,7,Sat Jul 4 03:20:27 2015 UTC,"I saw Pontypool before I'd heard of WTNV.  As such, in my head Cecil always looks like a slightly younger version of the main dude in the film."
nightvale,3c1r86,CitizenWolfie,3,Sat Jul 4 07:52:27 2015 UTC,"Stephen McHattie looks essentially the same now as he did thirty years ago, only ever so slightly craggier."
nightvale,3c1r86,ShroudofTuring,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:55:25 2015 UTC,I've only seen him in that film so I have no basis for comparison but craggy is a great look for him.
nightvale,3c1r86,Sabuleon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:29:26 2015 UTC,It is. He could make a movie that's two hours of him just repeating 'Pontypool' or 'Tactical Bacon!' and it'd be captivating.
nightvale,3c1r86,MediumSizedDipper,7,Sat Jul 4 22:15:47 2015 UTC,It has a nice extra spin for Canadians aware of the language debate... evilgrin
nightvale,3c1r86,Utopian_Pigeon,3,Sat Jul 4 05:36:34 2015 UTC,"This is probably one of my favorite movies. As someone who grew up in and around radio stations, hearing a catastrophe happen from within your broadcast booth but being unable to leave the station, only able to report... It gives me chills. Plus, the way everything works out in this movie, and the ending... hnng."
nightvale,3bzueu,ColumnMissing,54,Fri Jul 3 14:19:39 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, this sub going dark won't be a huge deal for them. It's the mega subs, like strexcorp, that need to go dark!"
nightvale,3bzueu,Austin-117,23,Fri Jul 3 16:08:18 2015 UTC,Everyone at Strex Corp is at the mandated company picnic.
nightvale,3bzueu,blueheeler,11,Fri Jul 3 17:05:33 2015 UTC,Forever.
nightvale,3bzueu,fishbiscuit13,10,Fri Jul 3 20:01:42 2015 UTC,Doppelgangers? Kill em!
nightvale,3bzueu,Ctri,14,Fri Jul 3 15:17:20 2015 UTC,They could be you! They could be me! They could even be- BLAM
nightvale,3bzueu,RangerSix,2,Fri Jul 3 16:40:04 2015 UTC,Ooh now I really want pl_nightvale or something like that in tf2
nightvale,3bzueu,Tacticalbowtie,3,Sat Jul 4 05:26:39 2015 UTC,"Ohh, whole map would be a mirror and you would fight copies (ie same guns and cosmetics)"
nightvale,3bzueu,J_tt,16,Sat Jul 4 10:46:30 2015 UTC,This cheered my heart.
nightvale,3bzueu,Aayin,5,Fri Jul 3 15:00:14 2015 UTC,Love this :P no need for smaller subs to go dark. Only to bring up the issue
nightvale,3bzueu,thedeadlinger,7,Fri Jul 3 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"We may take you back for reprogramming rehabilitation, but nothing with dopplegangers. That shit is just completely creepy. With their endless smiles and...ugh. Plus they're a pain if they're in the sun too long, their faces melt and their chips get all fried. Remember that serial killer last summer? Yeah, you don't. For good reason. Let's keep it that way :)  [OOC wise - no talk on closing the sub. I agree with what major subs are doing, since moderation tools are the worst plus lack of communication. But closing us won't make a difference, so we'll stay open for now.]"
