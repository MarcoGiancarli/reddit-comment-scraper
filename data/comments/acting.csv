acting,3e4hr1,BootsOnYoCouch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:28:45 2015 UTC,I was intrigued by this. I've never seen an actor with business cards. Not sure how I feel about it. Seems like promotional postcards could serve the same purpose.
acting,3e4hr1,Pennwisedom,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:20:21 2015 UTC,Really? Everyone here has them. I need to get into gear and get some for myself. They're even good for networking with other actors. It's so much less awkward to make a quick connection when you give someone a card (and get one in return) than when you ask them if they mind writing their info in your notebook.
acting,3e49ni,misstheground1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:22 2015 UTC,I don't have a lot of experience hopping around from place to place doing work. But the extra work I have done has mostly been booked through online resources. Several of which did not require an agent to book through. However I assume these sorts of sites vary from location to location.
acting,3e49ni,Pilka214,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:59:24 2015 UTC,Sure. Central casting is where you need to go to get in the system. I think they have a signup thing once or twice a week. Then you'll probably want to pay an agency for a month... You certainly won't get more than one or two gigs a week because even being a full-time extra takes some time and commitment though... I dunno. Its not hard to get started with background work.

Regular classes might be tough because most likely, you'd be paired with a scene partner and there would be a rehearsal requirement. Why don't you look at places nearby? Austin has a film market, and UT at Austin has a good theatre department. You could see who the film acting players are there, or check to see if the faculty at the university teaches classes outside the school (or has suggestions)."
acting,3e4fqo,PepperLofton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:34 2015 UTC,"This essentially.  Yeah, you'd be commuting for a two hour class, flying back and forth... and you've got a scene partner you're going to need to rehearse with.  Commuting from Dallas doesn't seem practical."

But don't let me convince you either way. If you can truly travel freely, manage the load and last minute rehearsal/class rescheduling, then go for it.

So you'd need to be here at least 4 days."

You are going to see enough Brando on any best of movie list - On the Waterfront, The Godfather, etc.  Last Tango in Paris is weird to watch. It was controversial when it came out but I had a hard time watching it when I was younger out of sheer boredom.   Honestly, if you are in your 20s, you are going to have a hard time watching those movies. They are good - but old. There have been so many great performances just in the last 20 years.  What I would recommend is going down the best actor/actress Oscars list and work your way backwards. Start with the latest movies. Also I think this is good because you can see what is considered to be good acting now - as opposed to 50 years ago. Times have changed."

Sophie's Choice, The Devil Wears Prada, The Iron Lady, all fantastic performances. I'd watch The Theory of Everything Eddie Redmayne is on the path to becoming one of greats. Watch Angels In America for Jeffery Wright's performance. Whiplash for Miles Teller and JK Simmons performances. There's been a huge shift in acting styles from the 40s-50s until now, keep up with what's happening in today's scene."

You have to take this list with a grain of salt because the acting style was pretty different for the time in some of these films.  If you're looking to study actors on their craft you should watch people like Al Pacino in films like ""Scarface"" or ""Scent of  Woman"". Surprised they didn't have The Deer Hunter on this list too (unless I missed it). Try and watch actors that have appeared on Inside the Actor's Studio. Their work is usually fantastic. Just my opinion."

This works for me and my voice can get pretty bassy and deep, think more along the lines of Batman the animated series / Kevin Conroy than the Christian Bale Batman which is more ""throaty"". That's pretty much his lowest tone and even though his voice is deep and bassy normally, it's not AS deep as when he relaxes it.  To do the gravely Bats, you have to again relax but sort of vibrate your throat, like when you're about to clear your throat , sort of. If you lower your voice , push the air forward and say ""I"" you can get an idea of what I'm talking about. Do it in an empty room because it's pretty funny to hear and you'll get stares.  If you do the gravely Batman exclusively with your throat/vocal chords, you're going to wreck your throat apart and it will be raw and sore but it's hard to avoid it either way.  Good people to check out for ideas would be John Dimmaggio (Jake the Dog, Bender), , Kevin Conroy (BATMAN), David Hayter (Solid Snake) and Kevin Michael Richardson (Cleveland Brown, Groot).

acting,3dys6g,FARTHINGfeels,11,Mon Jul 20 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"Alright, as a union member, let me give you the whole lecture on why you shouldn't take non-union work.  It's not just about the fact that you're breaking rules or that you might get caught, it's that every time you cross that line you're actively hurting the union's power to collectively bargain and, therefore, hurting your fellow professionals.  Your union card isn't something you take because it gives your status, and it's not a signal that you're in the club.  When you join a union you are committing a political act.  You have chosen to identify yourself with a group that has certain contractual and professional standards set up.  The only reason this group is effective is because each and every member refuses to work for less or under a contact that has not been negotiated and bonded by their union.  When people do what you describe, it gives producers the idea that they can keep on snagging union members and paying/providing less than they are worth.  When an employer pays your contract, he's not just paying you.  Dues are collected, he's paying into your pension, maybe your 401(k), and the general health trust.  When you take non-union work, all of this money that is collected is no longer available to the common good.  So if your response is ""well, that doesn't really matter, I don't care"" then you absolutely should not be in AEA or SAG-AFTRA.  If your answer is you do care, then don't take non-union work.  Your card is a promise, not a reward."

They were a small business who would put nearly all their ad money their money into digital broadcast, like pre-rolls, and could not afford the $15k to license it for 8 weeks (I had 12+actors. It was a group therapy skit). However, they could afford to pay the actors about half (and I had already paid them on the day as well).   Almost all the actors need the exposure. Not many actors don't. However, two were scared of losing their pensions so they said no. SAG is very good at scaring their talent. Hence this posting.   The result is the spot is not licensed. It will not run. 10 actors who need the exposure will not get it. SAG makes nothing. Everyone lost.   More and more commercial productions are trying to go non-union. Many new non-union commercial prod co's are popping up and some doing very well. The business is changing drastically.   I would encourage all actors to go Fi-Core. That way you can play both sides and actually work.   SAG's one-size-fits-all pricing structure is not realistic in the current and ever-evolving state of production. Rates should be based on production budgets IMO."

He'll even make commercials don't, are people scrambling for Flo or the Verizon guy? The things that do give exposure don't ask you to do things like this anyway.  And even then, unless their plan was to run it on major networks I doubt it would've cost that much. Which of course brings up the point that if they can't pay actors, how are they going to afford the ad buys? Because I'm sure networks don't do it for free either."
acting,3dys6g,Pennwisedom,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"Fi-Core actors are seen by some in the industry as scabs, people willfully doing union busting work for personal gain.  I'm not sure I feel the same way, but it's important to note a few things about going Financial Core: You cannot represent yourself as SAG/AFTRA on headshots, resumes, and publicity materials, you cannot take advantage of member benefits, and your paychecks will not be reflected in pensions, health, or 401(k) plans.  Going financial core is a tough call for some people to make, but I'm of the opinion that you either join the union or you leave the union.  That's a choice that you have to make and determine what is best for you, your family, your career, and your fellow members.  Edited: I hate it when I mess up punctuation or spelling."
acting,3dys6g,TomBombomb,2,Mon Jul 20 23:04:00 2015 UTC,Let's not forget in most sections of the industry non union pay is just pathetic.
acting,3dys6g,Pennwisedom,3,Mon Jul 20 23:12:30 2015 UTC,i've seen non-union breakdowns listing a $250 buyout for a regional commercial... which is downright criminal as far as I'm concerned.

acting,3dwhi6,Pennwisedom,2,Mon Jul 20 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"This. My strategy is to write two ""wins"" on the back of the postcard. Keeps it short, positive and non-desperate. Can be as simple as, hey I was in a thing and did this awesome hike in canyon x last week!"

acting,3dwhi6,Pennwisedom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:05:59 2015 UTC,Postcards are generally just made of your headshot
acting,3dwhi6,Pennwisedom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, where can I get those? I'll check the website where I ordered my headshots from. I'm from Toronto."
acting,3dwhi6,username12321,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:20:58 2015 UTC,"Probably the place your got them from can do them, or two you where. I don't know how stuff works in Canada"
acting,3dwhi6,db_333,2,Mon Jul 20 21:41:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure this is practiced much anymore, with the huge shift to digital. I usually send emails to casting directors I'm close with letting them know what I'm up to. And very infrequently (when there's real news to share).   This may not be the case in LA or Toronto. I live in NYC"
