One thing she says:   “Along the way, there are some very aggressive implied promises being made to the community — in comments to mods, quotes from board members — and they’re going have some pretty big challenges in meeting those implied promises.”   Reading between the lines, it sounds like they want to get a lot of tools and changes for reddit out the door quickly and put pressure her to make it happen.  I work at a place that expect miracles and would not be surprised if they demanded too much in an unrealistic time frame.  Especially from someone that has only been in the position for two months.   Then again maybe it is all on her, perhaps she was underqualified for the position.  Like I said, not enough information to come to an opinion yet."

'Directly' responsible or not, she owned the systemic failures at Reddit for months and months, and did not mitigate or remedy the failures, which is why she needed the heave ho.

TechNewsToday,3d6pv1,Mange-Tout,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:47:21 2015 UTC,"The aircraft would survive the impact depending on where it hits. An engine strike would depend on the engine type. A front inlet set up like the TPE 331 may cause loss of the engine due to Ingestion, where the same strike to a PT-6 style engine would just cause damage to the prop, metal prop no immediate problem, a composite prop would depend on the strike area. A strike to a turbo fan could cause a thrown blade and loss of the engine. A strike to a recipe engine would again be a prop concern,same thing for helicopters. A fuselage strike would depend on the size and relativistic speeds.  Skin thickness of non composite airframes leading edges are between. 032 and. 041 2024t6 or 6061 t3 as a generalization. Where leading edges of smaller spotter planes could be as thin as. 024. So damage should be minor but could cause a fuel leak or damage to a flight control. A strike to a window would depend on design, glass or plastic, pressurized or not. Source, 20 year aircraft mechanic in both GA and commercial."

TechNewsToday,3cwv4p,stonechitlin,5,Sat Jul 11 23:56:42 2015 UTC,"Our genetic code is composed of four different molecules, called nucleotides:  Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T).   These four molecules are what geneticists call the four letters of the genetic alphabet: A, G, C and T. Adenine can bond with Thymine, and Cytosine can bond with Guanine. Thus, a long genetic chain has a ""mirror"" chain, and together, they form the entire genetic chain molecule that is DNA.  Example:  A - T C - G G - C T - A A - T A - T A - T    DNA is kept in the nucleus of all our cells, in the form of chromosomes, and is used to manufacture proteins that our cells need to survive, reproduce, and do their work.  So scientists have been searching for a pair of synthetic molecules that can not only bond with each other, but can appear in a genetic sequence without adding instability to the genetic chain; that is, without breaking when a sequence of the same molecule appears in the chain.  And they finally found (invented) them; they called them P and Z, which I assume, are the initials for their long names.   So, the above DNA sequence would be like this with the new ""letters"" of the genetic alphabet inserted at arbitrary points:  A - T C - G P - Z G - C T - A Z - P A - T A - T A - T    This means that we finally can use a new pair of molecules to create new proteins that have never been seen before in a living organism."

Researchers started with a random library of DNA strands constructed from the expanded alphabet and then selected the strands that were able to bind to liver cancer cells but not to other cells. Of the 12 successful binders, the best had Zs and Ps in their sequences, while the weakest did not.   But wait, there's more!   Benner wants to expand his genetic alphabet even further, which could enhance its functional repertoire. He’s working on creating a 10- or 12-letter system and plans to move the new alphabet into living cells. Benner’s and others’ synthetic molecules have already proved useful in medical and biotech applications, such as diagnostic tests for HIV and other diseases. Indeed, Benner’s work helped to found the burgeoning field of synthetic biology, which seeks to build new life, in addition to forming useful tools from molecular parts.

My point is it doesn't matter who he did it to. The punishment should be the same and should fit the crime. I don't have an opinion on if 2 years is reasonable or not but I don't think his target should matter when considered by a judge."

The impact of a shooting in a hospital killing 5 doctors is greater than shooting 5 workers in a postal office. But the crime and punishment should be the same for each.

A print head that can resolve to a couple microns is probably possible (maybe using one of these gears) but may not be faster than milling and assembling."

Some of the real industrial printers are getting pretty insane, and when you're working with more rigid materials (metals, carbon composite etc) the ability to be precise is even easier. Essentially since you're printing in layers, you can create all of the layer for 1 part, and all of the layer for the other part at the same height off the build platform with a slight delay (or none at all in some cases) and they can be touching or as close to touching as possible at the fidelity of the print head."
TechNewsToday,3cerru,beautify,3,Wed Jul 8 14:02:52 2015 UTC,The final product would obviously not be in plastic. I think you could use this type of gear ratio in like telescope tracking engines and like electron microscope engines(where you would need some serious smooth movements).

This wasn't just a website where people commented it was a community, to many it still is.  But as with Digg it didn't happen all at once. The 'feel' of the place changed. Kevin Rose took a lot of money and a lot of smart people started telling him the site needed to grow, to become a 'real' news site. No more cats and shitposts.   So they changed. Internally the moved away from what made them Digg and started to make it easier for big users and news outlets to get the front page and harder for small users with an interesting story on a blog to hit the front page.  As Kevin became focused on being a 'real' company, he forgot what made Digg. The community was EVERYTHING. When he didn't look after it and took it for granted it left. There wasn't a huge site changing event (unless you count V3) just people drifted away, by the end there wasn't anyone left who cared enough to even get upset.   TLDR: Digg died when it was focused on money and becomeing more grown up rather than looking after the community. Reddit is now doing the same thing."

Eventually I heard Digg shut down and I got all nostalgic because I couldn't even remember the last time I had been there.   Diggs brightest day was also the start of the end. The code incident. The heat an passion around that whole event was amazing. But it also signalled to the money guys how dangerous the community could be. It was then that the plans to 'manage' the community began. I believe TheFappening was the brightest and yet darkest moment for the Reddit Community and Reddit as a whole. Now the will 'manage' the community and kill the passion  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSQIoXf294E You see this a lot with MMOs to begin with the players rage at the developers, post on blogs and forums, comment on podcasts, make youtube videos etc. But over time the passion, the love goes out of them and they drift to other games.

Transparency: We understand reddit needs money to help keep its services up and running.

To do that she needs to kill off anything that will bring about negative publicity in the future and harm the implementation of a commercial strategy to monetize the vast amount of traffic flowing through the site.  Pao wants to see targeted ads on each subreddit. Reddit lends itself to very easy targeting of ads which makes each user very valuable.  The risk is though that the darker side of reddit will cause embarrassment and make potential advertisers wary of being associated with Reddit. So Pao must kill this side of Reddit.  Jailbait, hell no (yes I know it was already gone). Fappening - That caused all sorts of hassle so change the rules to make sure it can't happen again. Fatpeople hate - That will upset sponsors so its gone.  Over the next few months Any racist, sexist or any other sort of 'ist' subs will be killed off. From Paos perspective this isn't much of a loss as those subreddits couldn't be easily monetized anyway.

I think its time to hit Reddit where it hurts, money.  Don't buy Gold.  Turn on Adblock.  Message the admins  Maybe they will respond better to this method.

Purpose of Test:   The aim of the test was to demonstrate the ability of the F-35 to fly to the edge of its restricted test limits without exceeding them. The test scenario was apparently successful as it allowed the aircraft be cleared for greater agility in future tests.  “Pilots really like maneuverability, and the fact that the aircraft recovers so well from a departure allows us to say [to the designers of the flight control system laws], ‘you don’t have to clamp down so tight’.”"

And that includes teaching them to be responsible and good citizens. It is possible for a kid to get in (big) trouble online, and a good parent will do everything possible to make sure it doesn't happen. Best way, of course, is education. Teach the kid how to be a good internet citizen, and not put themselves into situations where others can prey on them. If the child isn't willing to be educated, then the next level is monitoring. This is the big brother thing. The last option is to stop being an enabler. If it was drug addiction then you would stop providing them money and stuff. If it's internet problems then you cut off the internet, take away cell phones, etc.    It is strict, but strict is not a bad thing, unless you're the child that isn't willing to listen. As a parent, I'm only as strict as I need to be. If the kid shows responsibility and stuff in an area then I can pretty much give a free reign. If they can't even do that, then I have to reign them in so they aren't a danger to themselves or others.
