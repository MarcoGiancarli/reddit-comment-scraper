DMT,3e36ck,Foolishghoul,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:22 2015 UTC,"I have thought for years this could be the new pathway for the synthesis of many recreational drugs. And once Pandora's box opens up it would be impossible to shut. One could sell these bacterium on the dark net, and supply would skyrocket as manufacturing would be as simple as setting up a few petri dishes. Obviously dmt isn't the only applicable drug either, I don't see any reason why this couldn't be done with mescaline, thc, morphine, psilocibin, ergotamine, etc. Looks like you have really put this through its paces theoretically, please report back if you ever actually complete it!"
DMT,3e36ck,holycactimartyr,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:29 2015 UTC,"I don't see any problem with any of the other drugs as well. If they can be produced by some funghi, catus or whatever, and the biosynthesis is known, it could be replicated in modified organisms as well. I guess that would drive down the price! And perhaps also the availability. DMT is perhaps one of the easiest drugs to make this way?? Its just two enzymes.   It is important that the gene is small if one wish to be able to buy it from an online shop. There is a limit to how large chains of DNA that can be synthesized. It was because of that limit that I selected the proteins from the house mouse, instead of for example humans - our AAAD/INMT-enzymes are longer. The ability to manufacture DNA increases exponentially over time, just like computing power, but faster.. So I guess this will not be an issue in the near future.  It is illegal to buy synthetic genes in the European Union, unless you have a certificate. It is quite expensive and difficult to get a certificiate. Doing this without buying the synthesized genes requires real dedication and a lot of money.  In the USA, it is totally unregulated. Anyone can buy plasmids there."

DMT,3e45ao,Demty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:35:08 2015 UTC,I've tried almost every way. But prefer a glass pipe (or bub)with a metal screen or two and a thin ash bed followed by a mound of d. Holding the flame just right takes practice. Lighter needs to be close but not roasting it. Flame needs to be on it so it vapes but don't cherry it. If it lights up gently blow it out and continue vaping it off the screen the flame needs to be on it while filling up the pipe if it's lights up like a candle it's too hot. Hold them hits in LONG. Weed burns too hot supposedly but some people swear by the sandwich method. If you do sandwich break up the herb mega fine for the top layer.

DMT,3e3p5d,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"I think a rig is the most effective way.  The volcano can only reach a certain temperature, and the hot air doesn't contain that much energy (compared to a hot nail).  What i'm trying to say is that a rig can evaporate sufficient amounts pretty fast. The volcano would just need a bigger bag (and therefore more hits)"
DMT,3e2i7g,Mestonman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"I would advise you to clear out the room you are going to smoke in, as the more empty the room I found out actually creates a much more powerful experience, also preferably sit in the center of the room facing a window or balcony.  Try to meditate or relax in your own way the days beforehand, have a light meal an hour before, go to the restroom and possibly have some spiritual/influential reading ready for after the session.  To actually smoke it right, this is exactly how you do it.  Get oregano (the cooking herb) and pour about half a bowl into the glass.  Then however much DMT you are aiming for in a FLAT circle, no pile, you want a clean flat circle.  If you have no tool to measure I found that a circle the diameter of a small marble works (smaller than a dime, bigger than a pea).  Then put a 2mm layer of oregano on top of that.  To burn it correctly you must NOT BURN the DMT.  People fuck this up allll the time. You are letting the cherry of the top layer of oregano passively burn the DMT.  So don't let the flame get to close to the oregano (don't use butane).  Take a full hit of the nasty stuff, hold it in forever as you will go into the trip and naturally breath it out, if you don't hold it in you will not get the hit.  Make sure you are in a good mental space and have a few days to a month to process this shit, it is really really powerful (and I've done psychedelics in the high two digits)."

Happy tripping, oh and finally, make sure to keep the bong safe, as you will almost always move around (but be temporarily blind of the physical reality around you). So either smoke it in the corner, leave the bong there and quickly go back to the center of the room, or have a sitter. Do not use DMT alone if you are inexperience with hallucinogens, actually don't do it at all if your lsd, psilocybin, and salvia experiences only range in the 0-20 range (total of all three).  Don't use it during a tough week at work or uni, or when you have recently argued with a close friend/family/SO.  Turn your phone off (not just silent, as technology becomes a kill joy for a lot of people during their trip) before the adventure, close thee door if people are home, don't lock it however in case of an injury.  After this trip, I found out drinking a cup of water and showering or swimming is bloody fricken amazing, it really resets your entire thinking process and washes away any residue anxiety.  Cheers!"

DMT,3e1og4,sozket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:30:40 2015 UTC,"Hold the flame of the lighter roughly a half inch above the bowl, when you inhale you want to see the flame bend closer towards the bowl but never come in contact with the herb, just like smoking kief or melting hash into a bowl, this will vaporize the dmt, keep the flame over the bowl until it has a decent cherry rolling. and yes you can get it all in one go, it's actually encouraged!"

DMT,3e19ir,sorryhonestly,8,Tue Jul 21 04:35:00 2015 UTC,"I would recommend not doing anything that substantially alters your consciousness for at least a few days before you journey somewhere deep. Drugs can really shake and twist your intentions, and having strongly felt intentions before doing any drug, or really doing anything, is the most important aspect of making decisions, especially like doing potent psychedelics. The more respect you have for yourself, the more likely you are to be respected by aspects of yourself that you do not know of.   Edit: I really recommend going at least two weeks without doing drugs or eating shitty food before tripping. The longer you have to stabilize and to build healthy momentum and rhythm, the more likely you are to benefit from an experience. I would even recommend treating cannabis like any other psychedelic; if you do it too frequently without good intentions, then you can really lose your rhythm and build and exacerbate bad habits. Eating well, exercising, staying away from screens as much as possible, and questioning and killing your habits are paramount for development. The more good you invest into your life, the more good it will return to you. Your life is simply a conversation that you're having with yourself, and nothing speaks louder than honest intentions that are followed through. At least this is what I've experienced through my own extensive (and incomplete) travels through foolishness."

DMT,3dx4si,smokinjoe65,4,Mon Jul 20 12:15:08 2015 UTC,"The afterglow of DMT is one of the best things you can experience. I have not done LSD (yet) but I've done DMT several times. It's a very harmonious, calming sensation. You feel at peace with yourself, and at peace with the surrounding world. You feel that you have a definite place in this world, and that your role in your place is irreplaceable. After DMT I always feel a nostalgic ""longing"" for something, something which I can not describe. I have not done LSD so I can not compare with DMT, but many people who have done both say that DMT is not comparable to anything. Nothing can prepare you for DMT, and nothing will. If / when you decide to take DMT it will be a huge leap to the unknown, no matter what and how much experiences you may have with other substances. DMT is extremely intense, and it can be very scary.

DMT,3dx4si,sanic123,4,Mon Jul 20 13:13:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, DMT gives you a high/after-glow.  Both of those substances can be scary. Is DMT more likely to be scary than LSD? I'm not an expert on this, I've only done low doses of DMT. I haven't had a complete break-through. Personally, it wasn't scary at all. The set and the setting were good and I felt overall positive. I was familiar with the psychedelic experience and had read a lot about DMT.  Intense it is, yes. I'd say that LSD is more of a rough experience. You have to take what it gives you. It can be quite a roller coaster sometimes. DMT is intense but when it's over, it's over and you can feel pretty straigth-headed soon. With LSD, I usually have to get a good night's sleep before getting my usual ""clarity"" back.  I've read that people can have very overwhelming (not quite in the positive sense) experiences on higher doses of DMT. Even though you'll probably find something good in those experiences afterwards as well, I wouldn't aim for them at first. If you're afraid that it's going to be scary, perhaps you could start by trying low doses first? That can't possibly hurt."

So many other people take visionary doses frequently yet seem to live pretty stable lives.  I'm really, really bored with everyday reality."
DMT,3dvwsp,ineedmymedicine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:00 2015 UTC,"i struggle with fear as well, but mushrooms have almost in a sense allowed me to deal with fear in a more positive way. I find doses 2 grams and under to be significantly more controllable. 2.5g or higher typically makes things interesting. It took several difficult experiences and a few positive experiences before i felt i began to gain a ""slight"" familiarity of the more intense territory. My conclusion came to be that no matter how confident you may be with your own mind, the nature of the mushroom is intrinsically distorting of the senses at all levels. This is why every trip is new and so unpredictable."

DMT,3dx5tg,FredZeplin,3,Mon Jul 20 07:39:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed but technically the MAOI allows the DMT to be absorbed in the stomach with out being destroyed by the enzyme monoamine oxidase; the DMT is always active unless destroyed.

DMT,3dx8vb,wellitsbouttime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:59:33 2015 UTC,Ergot alkaloids are used in synthesizing LSA which is a precursor to synthesizing LSD.
DMT,3dx8vb,steezyneezy,2,Mon Jul 20 14:03:51 2015 UTC,"Ergot contains lysergic acid amines, those are the 'starting point' for the manufacture of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide).  Does not contain LSD.  Some people have made ergot wine, that is hallucinogenic however I would never drink it since you can get Saint Anthony's fire and gangrene from ergot.   Edit:  I should add that most modern LSD manufacture does not use ergot directly for the starting point, instead Ergotamine (a pharmaceutical used to treat migraines) is the starting point for most modern synthesis.  Ergot was used in the early days of LSD production, but it is notoriously hard to produce in large quantities and the right strain has to be used because most strains do not have high enough lysergic alkaloids to be practical for mass production, plus it is a nasty fungus that can cause ergotism resulting in gangrene, vasoconstriction and/or neurological sickness resulting in seizures and death."

DMT,3dvi63,sozket,3,Mon Jul 20 03:10:48 2015 UTC,"It depends on how quickly you can process an experience.

DMT,3dvi63,smokinjoe65,2,Mon Jul 20 13:58:13 2015 UTC,"Never more than once a month imo. Upon first time use you may think that you could do it every day/week although this does not come without immense psychological pressure. I have heard stories about people smoking endogenous DMT up to 5 times a week. After the 11th time things got extremely hairy. SWIM would attempt to make entity contact which at first seemed to be the most life changing thing someone could do. Although he was warned that he was coming to often. That warning turned into a command to not return. That command then eventually turned into a cosmic blast within ones head in which these entities had catapulted SWIM into realms as far away possible to themselves which ended in a extremely traumatic experience.  What I and many people had learned from this story- To value you DMT voyages with up most care and caution  Give yourself adequate time to reflect on your experience rather than trying to get back to the same place you were in a short period of time.  Never underestimate the power that DMT withholds.  If you wish to enter the Divine  realm frequently, rather than ingesting the chemical let your body synthesis it itself with the help of transcendental meditation. (Trust me, the breakthroughs possible when practicing deep meditation are as vivid if not more than a DMT flash. Also they are much more controllable and if you like 'natural')  Prepare yourself and don't just go all out because you have acquired a substantially large amount of the substance. Your body and mind need time to contemplate what you have just experienced.  The worst thing you can do is ruin the divinity of your experience due to frequent use."
DMT,3dvi63,shalooph,2,Mon Jul 20 01:35:57 2015 UTC,"I'm confused over a few points... (not arguing here, just clarifying). Endogenous DMT is naturally occurring, as in already in our bodies. You can't smoke it. Did you mean freebase? Also, when you say people shouldn't do it too often, understand that not every experience is intended to be a breakthrough experience. There's no set time line for these experiences and some can integrate the lessons quicker and more fully than others.  As a side note, I don't know if I subscribe to the claim that these states can be reached through TM. You may be able to achieve dreamlike states, but traveling through freestanding realities with entity interaction isn't something reported from reputable practicuoners of TM (actually, they say quite the contrary)."
DMT,3dvacm,desigrlbkny,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:34:24 2015 UTC,"I would advise 2-3 grams of ACRB for your first time. Why are you using shredded? Powdered is better. The longer you boil, the more alkaloids will be dissolved in the liquid. Once you do three boils, you can reduce the liquid as well so that you don't have to drink so much volume. You should end up with somewhere between a shot glass and a coffee mug, volume-wise. Drink your rue tea about half an hour before taking the ACRB tea. Be sure you have a trip sitter who can calm you down. You will more than likely vomit for at least 20 minutes. This is normal. It will pass. Don't freak out, just let it happen.   Good luck!

I don't think they're ""evil"" just like it don't think angels are ""good"". Pleasant vs unpleasant, and the wrathful are the masters of pain and unpleasant times. I imagine the being you encountered has been named many times, but ultimately is Destruction. I think really there is only one entity-love, which we know as two forms: life, creation, existence, light  and death, destruction, the void, and death. Without one we would not have the other. I do think the wrath comes from love because I think all energy is love but it's the toughest love ever conceived. Love doesn't have to play nice. It sounds like it drilled in the concept that any pain on this plane is nothing, and you need not worry about your mundane troubles...  The Tibetan book of the dead would be a good read for you. I swear to you that book describes hyperspace and all its inhabitants and mechanics (to an extent obviously). It actually goes in depth into the wrathful deities and it sounds like you encountered the head honcho soul eater who is pretty much in charge of making the whole thing work... it's been a while since I've read it but it is certainly described close to how you describe it. Gnawing and gnashing of your soul type stuff.   Just remember there would be no light without a darkness with w7hich to reference.

DMT,3do2eu,reptilee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:19:35 2015 UTC,"Once, not a woman, but women. Interestingly enough it was the first time I took DMT while on ketamine. I was only on about 100mg of ket, and took probably 30-40mg of DMT. It started out as the familiar humming and visual morphing into a fractalled world, but suddenly took a weird turn. (Yea, yea... ""weird"" really doesn't mean much when the context is a DMT trip).  Suddenly everything went quiet. Not only physically quiet, but it was like someone turned off my sense of sound and channeled those vibrations into a more visually and mentally rich experience.   I don't know if other people get this, but some drugs are ""loud"" and others ""quiet"" to me. Psychedelics are generally ""loud"" for me. I don't often have aural hallucinations just from a tryptamine or phenethylamine, but sounds are amplified, enriched, and sprayed across my brain to enjoy along with the rest of the experience.  Other drugs are ""quiet"". Deliriants and dissociatives are two examples. Interestingly enough, while I can't actually handle even therapeutic doses of DPH (Benadryl) any more, any amount of it will completely wipe away my minor tinnitus (played drums too much without earplugs). A dissociative like ketamine, MXE, or DXM will do something similar, but more on a mental level. It's like all the background noise of your brain, every little blip that goes off in your subconscious mind that doesn't make its way to working memory, but is still ""felt"" somehow becomes completely ignored. Even actual environmental sounds are stripped down.  Sorry to wordily describe my trip experiences, but it ties into the reason this trip was so interesting. Normally DMT is LOUD. Not in a bad way, at all. But when you take even 10mg, it's going to take your senses and it's going to make itself known to all of them.  This time though, the sound was killed, and instead of traveling to another dimension, I went right into a small (small relative to the places DMT normally brings you) empty void space. It was mostly black, but there was environmental visual noise stemming from what I'm assuming are the insides of my eyelids, since I had no idea if I had eyes open or closed during this. But each small field of visuals outlines and gave detail to the figure of a woman... There were about 4-5 of them, and they were unmistakably entities (Sorry in advance to those who I know won't like this word. Replace with ""Jung archetypes"" or ""subconscious manifestations"" or even ""ravings of some guy who smelled some horse tranquilizers then smoked an eyeballed amount of one the most powerful psychedelics in the universe."") The thing is though, most (all but this trip) of my DMT experiences have yielded masculine entities. The only other time I've experienced a distinctly feminine presence on DMT is when I took breakthrough doses of salvia and DMT at the same time, but that was a case of two opposing forces, one masculine and one feminine, battling for the right to show me some crazy shit. They also weren't as playful or impish as most of the minor entities I normally experience... they were just women dancing, made of fractals and swaying in the psychedelic breeze. They let me into their space (if it was theirs and they weren't merely passing through like me) and let me do my own sort of dance through the experience. But they weren't there to help me, hinder me, or influence me... they were just there.  I wish I could give more detail to the experience itself but I've tried to recreate it multiple times without the same type of success. DMT plus a dissociative is always a good combo, but nothing like that first experience. I put two powerful drugs into my body, drugs that can and will force everything in your subconscious mind into an experience of one kind or another.  That day, though? My mind just wanted to dance. Nothing more, nothing less. Was mind blowing to have a DMT experience that was just so exceptionally CLEAR from start to finish. Instead of being blasted with the entire universe through an amp turned up to 11, I was occupied with only one thing at a time, and was lucky enough to experience a sort of megacharged flow state for the whole 15 minutes (DMT with a disso normally stretches the noticeable effects of DMT a decent amount)."
DMT,3do2eu,Saghloqh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:24:56 2015 UTC,"Wow great response man, I like your pioneering spirit in combining all of these wonderful drugs, especially your ketamine story. I've never done K before, but many report a less collective ""quiet"" aura to it. McKenna said that it was like he was in an empty office building alone by himself.  That idea of opposing forces is classic Jung. The struggle between the anima and the animus, life and death, good and evil. Idk why the subconscious has to reduce everything to binary terms.  Btw, how did you get tinnitus? I'm a musician myself and that scares the shit out of me."
DMT,3do2eu,Saghloqh,2,Sat Jul 18 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"As to the tinnitus bit, I just had a drum kit and played percussion/drums often in our school bands. It was just a 5 year period where I was sitting in my small room with a drum kit available to wail on. It's very minor tinnitus that's covered up by any sort of environmental noise luckily, and if I'd just worn a set of earphones every once in a while while playing more loudly I doubt it'd be there at all"

Depending on how warm your naphtha is, the amount of varying compounds pulled will change. Cooler naphtha will pull mostly DMT but requires more pulls, and hotter naphtha  (or any solvent) won't be as discriminating when it comes to absorbing compounds, but you can get most of your DMT in ~3 pulls.   I do a re-x with fresh naphtha every time, regardless of initial quality. I never use zinc. http://imgur.com/zEvnjEv http://imgur.com/fX2eSkj  None if it is yellow. That's just my kitchen light.

DMT,3dlpke,AnonUnicorn,2,Fri Jul 17 07:51:51 2015 UTC,"1) If people talk shit about it, odds are they've never done it or they were going into it thinking its no big deal. 2) A breakthrough is where you end up in an alternate place that looks and feels more real than this reality. It won't necessarily be ""space"" and you may or may not see entities. 3) Nobody can answer this, really. It's up to you. 4) not familiar with meth pipes or oil pipes 5) Be somewhere comfortable where you can flop back, like a bed or couch. You most likely won't be able to sit upright very easily if you do it right. 6) I always play calm music or nature sounds, no lyrics. To each their own. 7) Only you can know this.

There was however a warning about sitting on a dock and almost falling in during the experience but thankfully the trips sitters kept that from happening.  I did try sitting near a frozen lake and it was pretty cool but not a great launch due to poor extraction so I would not say it was the best ever."
DMT,3dlpke,cetaphillotion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:24 2015 UTC,"For #1, while both LSD and DMT are hallucinogens, DMT is much more intense, a ""bad trip"" on DMT will be unimaginatively worse than LSD. Chemically the drug will make you hallucinate more vividly and feel pain more vividly.    There have been trips on DMT where you meet a powerful entity that changed your life for the better. And where people have met a powerful entity that they could only describe as pure evil, and have given them pain that they only could describe, as greater than death itself, something more than the body should be able to handle.    My favorite bad trip you can find on /r/drugs where a guy talks about from beginning to end his trip that he was destroyed atom by atom by pure evil.    It's definitely something you should try if you are interested in it, it will definitely be an experience that you will remember. However everybody experiences it differently, not much ways to prepare, other than physical safety. It has inspired and changed the views of several people before, but again, effects everyone differently.    I would only recommend doing N, N-Dimethyltryptamine not 5-MeO DMT because they both have varied effects and N, N-DMT has been the most successful for people.    Words will never really explain what can happen on DMT, but this guy did a damn good job at trying  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-TZKiJW1UQ    Edit: Just for your future knowledge, DMT was found naturally found in the pineal gland being released.  While you sleep, most people of course look toward dreaming, which naturally gets to be very realistic in your mind at the time, and just like psychedelics can end badly. That is why since we figured out DMT is found naturally in the pineal gland, researchers believe that it is what makes us dream    Obviously the amounts in our body that are released are generally low, even in lucid more realistic dreams, such low amounts do not compare to the amount you will be experiencing within the small time frame. So if you've ever had a lucid dream, that is technically the closest to a DMT trip chemically you will achieve, but it still will not prepare you for the hallucinations you will experience.    Edit: Since our body has such a small defined amount of DMT inside of it, is the reason we reach base levels so quickly after so much DMT is put into our body and mind. This is the reason that DMT only lasts 10-15 minutes, yet also like dreams, you tend to lose sense of time, dreams you can have days and weeks occur to you, in hours.    DMT is fascinating to most people, same for me, it allows your brain to do what it does normally, amplified by a shit ton, nothing not natural except the amount taken and it is quickly reduced and used, everything you hallucinate or ""dream"" when you break through will be stuff your body wants to see, or needs to see, depending on how your body takes it"

It's not like weed; you really want to take the biggest hits possible in the short time span that you have before coming up really hard. At least get off two hits, and if you're ambitious, go for a third. It's also really important to come in with a super clear head. Don't be drunk (obviously) or heavily caffeinated. I like to meditate beforehand. Take it seriously.  Have you ever listened to Terence McKenna's talks about DMT? Really worth checking out; you can search for ""Terence McKenna DMT"" on youtube.

DMT,3dheke,Dmtvape,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:11:31 2015 UTC,Its not going to do anything thing to you that you dont want it to on some level of your consciousness. It can be a profound experience for some and others its a quick trip to reset and re-energize their mind.
DMT,3dheke,ComptonCrusader,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:53:11 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... interesting. A good friend of mine got into psychedelics and they clearly exacerbated some sort of latent mental disorder or something. He went from being a normal kid to a paranoid, under the radar (like literally, he lives in the woods alone) vegan. I guess I just wanted reassurance that something of this magnitude wouldn't happen to me. His entire identity changed completely through using psychedelics."
DMT,3di65m,_Open_Thinker_,4,Thu Jul 16 13:49:42 2015 UTC,"It's primary effects last closer to 8 minutes. It's true that it can dramatically effect the illusion of time but in most cases it's minor, such as confusion as to the order of events. Some people have reported to experience entire lifetimes go by but that is rare and one naturally questions their interpretation of this phenomenon until one has experienced it oneself."
DMT,3di65m,stochastic42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:02:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah. A friend of mine said he experienced an entire life time through marriage, children and death and it really weirded me out for awhile. I could see his hands shaking as he was telling me about this. That being said I don't think he had the right mindset for the experience (Just looking for a crazy trip). I plan to start slow in the right set and setting and have a positive outlook on the experience so hopefully I won't have the same fate."
DMT,3di65m,smokinjoe65,2,Thu Jul 16 14:10:15 2015 UTC,"Conjecture on my part, but he was probably just going through brief ""memories"" of an alternate life with associated emotions. The loss of time, from my experience, is due to how rapid the experiences are. Entire events go by each second and go in sequence, which can give the idea that you were in hyperspace for hours or days. This is based off of ~70 breakthrough experiences, snorted and vaped.  You don't really have to worry. DMT may snatch you up, rattle you and make you wish you'd never done it while you're there, but it always sets you down gently and happily, in my experience."
DMT,3di65m,smokinjoe65,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:49:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't disagree with that explanation. I don't think he like actually lived a ""lifetime"" of experiences but more experienced the idea of a lifetime with his life. We were also drinking so maybe (probably) there was a bit of an exaggeration in explaining the magnitude of his experience.   But 70 breakthrough experiences, that's incredible. Thanks for the advice. Makes me feel more comfortable with this upcoming journey."

DMT,3di65m,DranoTheCat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:19:56 2015 UTC,I do agree with that approach but in a way preparing for DMT feels a bit like rotating a dice so the 6 is facing up before you roll it.
DMT,3dhdc2,SmexyMillz,2,Thu Jul 16 07:47:22 2015 UTC,"honestly you might be okay considering there is no exposed heating coil. The problem with using DMT in some vapes is that if it is in crystal form it will often just melt through the heating element (like the tray in MFLB) which doesn't necessarily screw up the vape, just makes it permanently taste like crap. You could also load the DMT on top of a little bud which might make any vaped crystal just sit on ABV rather than any heating elements."
DMT,3dhdc2,shane4077,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:10:23 2015 UTC,"I use my Arizer solo for DMT. In the bowl where you load weed, I just put a torn off piece of a cotton ball, push it down just a bit, and put my dose of DMT on that. I turned it to level 3 heat setting, and once it's heated I hold the vape upside down and insert the stem (because the powder would all just fall into the chamber and burn otherwise) and give it about 5-10 seconds for the heat to transfer. Then I just hit it smoothly and deeply as if I were vaping weed. A bong or some type of chamber would be ideal to pull in a bigger hit, but I make do without one. The cotton ball essentially works as a wick, and I just reuse it because I never burn the DMT and then I have a little bit extra each time I reload the bowl.  Note that DMT leaves a funky smell and taste and you'll likely want to use a different stem for this and weed if that bothers you. I prefer to, and if you're smoking with friends later you definitely should. Wouldn't want someone unprepared to hit DMT resin, ha-ha"

DMT,3dh89g,DranoTheCat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:39:27 2015 UTC,"yes.  cut-n-paste from a previous comment on this sub:  I'd had lots of good experience using music to direct the experience with other psychdelic tools, so it seemed to make sense to do the same with DMT. So I loaded up the stereo, then loaded up the pipe, and pressed play before taking the hit. of course, once it kicked in, I was oblivious. In front of my eyes stood a spiral staircase, just one, full rotation of it, starting from the ground and disappearing those few steps up. and at the bottom of the staircase was a little girl, maybe 3 years old. She had in one hand the handle of her tricycle, and on her opposite shoulder was a large car tyre. She had something else in her fingers (I forget). As she was trying to climb the spiral staircase, she would lose her grip on the tricycle, or struggle with the tire, or drop whatever else it was she had in her hand. So although she kept taking steps, her load meant she kept returning to pick up what she was trying to take with her. And that was it. I stared for ages, confused at this one scene, wondering why it wasnt progressing. This wasn't the kind of experience I'd had before. What was it about? And I sat and stared. And she fumbled and stumbled. Until eventually I slapped my forehead, coming down with the clear message: you won't get high with all that baggage."

My second breakthrough was to some shpongle song with chanting (not divine moments of truth)   For me at least, music becomes more than just sound, and blankets me for my trip (literally wraps itself around me) however, everyone is different."
DMT,3dfkb1,UndeadAura,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:13:23 2015 UTC,"But is it possible to actually ""listen to the song"" ? I've never smoked DMT, but have heard before that during a breakthrough you feel completely disconnected from your surroundings, so I figured that listening to music would be impossible. Am I wrong?"
DMT,3dfkb1,IMG_9999,2,Wed Jul 15 23:24:24 2015 UTC,Not at all. However it definitely adds to it!
DMT,3dfkb1,UndeadAura,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:41:14 2015 UTC,"You'll hear ""sounds"" from the song, most likely. Sometimes, parts will be crystal clear but more often than not you'll be too stimulated by other things to actually pat attention to music. Pick a strong track, however, and it may make your experience less than enjoyable. I listened to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata 3rd movement played by 24 pianists and it was too powerful and depressing during the trip. It made me want to cry, which made me more sad because I brought sadness to such a happy place. The entities have a weird way of taking care of you and making you feel comfortable, however."
DMT,3dfkb1,smokinjoe65,2,Thu Jul 16 01:14:33 2015 UTC,"For me the music was everything. We listened to a 6 minute tribal type song, and I believe it totally dictated the trip. I heard a flute being played and for a second I saw a very old man playing the flute off in the distance. When the song ended it broke off my trip instantly and we just replayed it. Kind of a bad idea but the trip continued. The next time I do DMT I'm going to listen to a dubstep mix because I love dubstep, see how that affects me."
DMT,3dfkb1,clockman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:22:35 2015 UTC,Well I know that in Ayahuasca ceremonies shamanic guides play music while you're journeying. So I imagine it must play some role in mood control and pacification.

The trips are quite different and noticeably longer, and the time warp effect is more noticeable to me. You don't need crazy high doses to break through, I've found (20+ snorted trips). My breakthrough dose was ~55mg but I usually stayed around 45-50 for the headspace. It's all about how easy it is to lose yourself in the experience.   To answer your question, I don't think most people are as dedicated as others in using DMT as a tool for self exploration. The pain is too big an obstacle. For those of us who can work through the discomfort, the benefits far outweigh the cost. Not putting down people who can't stand the pain... to each their own. Sometimes it is a big obstacle."
DMT,3dcoi3,desigrlbkny,3,Wed Jul 15 08:20:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely, on all levels. With over 10 snorts, 10 vapes and 10 smoking i found that snorting was my favourite ride out of any drug tried and i learnt more from that than any other DMT trip or drug alike. I think its more so the after glow for 10 mins after the breakthrough, you still have the DMT feel but have a connection to reality, therefore you can make conscious connections about problems facing yourself etc. Greatly increased my self esteem through snorting DMT."
DMT,3dcoi3,pguigli,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:12:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it certainly seems like you need a bit more to breakthrough if you snort it:  https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/2zt38j/snorting_dmt/  I find anything above 70mg sufficient when using it on my oil rig.  I think my threshold is higher than most, who I think are able to breakthrough at lower inhaled levels.  So almost twice as much seems to be needed if you snort.  I guess if the trip is twice as long, and you don't mind nose pain :/   I'd rather just dab it."

The anxiety going into the trip when snorting it is decreased a lot for myself, give it a try it might be worth your while."

Mokes are pretty harsh though. I prefer weed only, or even better, ash rather than fresh herb. When you use ash you can be sure that all you're getting is DMT and thus you get the pure experience."

It's extremely common in Oregon, called a mulch bowl. If you have the weed to use, they will get you much higher than mokes.   As far as DMT goes, you could but I would just use layers of ash if you're trying to smoke it."
DMT,3d9e01,co77778,2,Tue Jul 14 15:03:50 2015 UTC,What you experienced was an out of body experience lucid dreaming is very different.
DMT,3d9e01,youfuckingslaves,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree that they are very different.  In fact I would argue that they are somewhat similar.    I'm a frequent lucid dreamer.  However, to my chagrin, I've only had what I would consider a mid-level DMT trip.  In my own experience, there are definitely many similar aspects."
DMT,3d9e01,Alex_801,0,Thu Jul 16 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"They are different, but both could be highly connected with DMT, because both exist at different levels in what some call the astral plane."
DMT,3d9e01,Luxjur,2,Tue Jul 14 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"a DMT trip, just without all the amazing stuff   ...a dream..."
DMT,3d9e01,RedSteppa,2,Tue Jul 14 15:24:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I didn't make myself clear :p I'm not saying I had a DMT trip, but this dream made me wonder if it could be possible to go to hyperspace through lucid dreaming. Who says it's a DMT exclusive experience?"
DMT,3d9e01,Demty,3,Tue Jul 14 15:31:56 2015 UTC,I think it is possible. Your experience sounds like a light trip. I'm interested in these states but am unable to attain. With meditation and practice I believe it is totally possible to break into higher states of mind. But for me meditating bores me. I'll take the red pill please.
DMT,3d9e01,RedSteppa,2,Tue Jul 14 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I feel you, I suck at meditating. I have the patience of an ant. But I think the main ingredient in this is focus. If you can precisely focus your mind's frequency to match another reality, you can go there by will. Some people, like buddhist munks, can supposedly do this. It's been scientifically measured that they can control the frequency of their brainwaves.  You just gotta get a feel for it, really. That's why I think starting out with lucid dreaming is a good idea. When you've made it easy to lucid dream and go out of your body, then you can move on to maybe even doing it while you're awake, just by relaxing and feeling your way there. Our minds might have less limits than we impose upon them."
DMT,3d9e01,Arbiter1233,2,Tue Jul 14 16:08:30 2015 UTC,"Nobody says this. But as far as we know a DMT experience occurs, when DMT-Molecules are consumed and bind to receptors. ...I may be jumping to conclusions here, but I'd say: No DMT involved = No DMT experience. Simple as that."
DMT,3d9e01,RedSteppa,2,Tue Jul 14 16:11:24 2015 UTC,"We dont know what specifically creates the consciousness part of living, and i think therefore, we cant say specifically whether its a chemical reaction, or what i personally believe, is a change in brainwave patterns, if these states of mind are possible thru meditation, i dont see why it isnt possible from lucid dreaming if you could match the Brainwaves? All just speculation..."
DMT,3d9e01,KrAzYkArL18769,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:28:01 2015 UTC,Your answer has no relation to DMT trips. DMT trips occur when one ingests DMT. That's what we KNOW. The rest are far fetched claims.
DMT,3d9e01,RedSteppa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:33:18 2015 UTC,"umm the pineal gland produces DMT, so it's definitely possible  that's the reason why it's so quickly processed, the body is already familiar with it  we are all holding"
DMT,3d9e01,KrAzYkArL18769,0,Wed Jul 15 04:03:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but there is no evidence that DMT is produced in the human pineal gland."
DMT,3d9e01,RedSteppa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:21:11 2015 UTC,"Apologies, I should say that the pineal gland is our best guess at where endogenous DMT is being manufactured (it contains all the necessary building blocks) but nevertheless, DMT is produced within our bodies somewhere. So it's not entirely impossible to have a mild DMT trip without actually intaking it."
DMT,3d9e01,iannoypeople,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:24:15 2015 UTC,"How much DMT would be needed for a mild trip? Are we aware that it only has been found in trace ammounts in humans? Can trace ammounts produce a trip?  Endogenous DMT was investigated in the 1960s and 1970s and it was proposed that DMT was involved in psychosis and schizophrenia. This hypothesis developed from comparisons of the blood and urine of schizophrenic and control subjects. However, much of this research proved inconclusive and conventional thinking has since held that trace levels of DMT, and other endogenous psychoactive tryptamines, are insignificant metabolic byproducts."

DMT,3d9e01,DranoTheCat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:22:42 2015 UTC,As far as I know there there sadly is no evidence that would turn this from a believe into a fact.   It's also believed that DMT enables one to talk to elves and fairies living on the astral plane of another dimension.

By that definition, I lucid dream every night. I actually have trouble waking up for work in the mornings because I need to go back to sleep to finish the story of whatever is happening in my dreams. I never end up getting a good night's sleep because I have vivid dreams every night because my brain is hyper active, the kind you get if you fall asleep with a nicotine patch, if anyone knows what I mean. I blame the ADHD.   Not fun after the millionth time.  Unless that's not what lucid dreaming is at all...."

DMT,3d9e01,Alex_801,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:07:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly.  I didn't know it was weird until my boyfriend told me he sleeps completely blank every night and wakes up feeling refreshed.  I think it might be genetic because my father has similar, intense dreams.   The worst part is that the dreams are actually more intense than any session of therapy because I'm learning things about my subconscious desires that I would actually rather ignore tbh. My dad doesn't share too many of his dream details either so I imagine it's the same for him.  The only times I sleep restfully are the times I'm blackout drunk, which again, are not often because it takes a lot of drinking in a short span of time to get me there."

DMT,3daoek,homeboymike,2,Tue Jul 14 20:23:13 2015 UTC,"With 200mg you have about 4 50mg doses, that means you have 4 times to learn and get better. You should slowly inhale and try to form a nice size vapor pool inside the machine, and inhale when it's a large enough dose for you to hold comfortably for 20 seconds. While you're holding your hit in you can stop the lighter and sit. Exhale, and do it again if you're physically able.   Spice is incredibly easy to extract, with many teks that are low smell, and food safe. I highly recommend you look into this so you have your own steady supply to experiment and learn with. Perhaps even share with people you're close to."

DMT,3daoek,mtttp,2,Tue Jul 14 22:05:22 2015 UTC,"I kind of slightly tilt it so its not straight up and down. hold the lighter an inch or two away and suck just hard enough to get the flame to bend. Slow and steady dont suck harder. No, dont move the flame closer. If you see vapor you know its getting hot enough. You want to heat it just enough to vaporize it, you dont want to burn it. 3.Hold all hits in as long as possible. Once you get enough you probably wont realize your blowing out that last hit.   And if it were me i would just throw it all in at once and just take hits as needed.

DMT,3d8uj6,spuncookie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:09 2015 UTC,"You can't extract changa. What is called changa is a smoking blend made of DMT, harmalas and a carrier herb. Making changa per definition involves infusing a herb with DMT and harmalas."
DMT,3d8uj6,RedSteppa,0,Tue Jul 14 13:30:21 2015 UTC,"yes... and I'm wondering if there's a way around.  let's say you start with chacruna, which would be a dmt source and herb carrier as well.  you could extract and infuse, obviously... but if you could ""extract"" it just enough to get a similar product, without going a full extraction-infusion circle..."
DMT,3d8uj6,dmtpsychonaut,2,Tue Jul 14 13:38:30 2015 UTC,"The trouble is that DMT is not very concentrated in the plant matter. I'm sure if you smoked enough raw plant matter, you'd get an effect but it would be so harsh and filled with other random compounds that it would not be in any way desirable.   For example, MHRB has a DMT content of about 3%. So to get a breakthrough dose, you would need to smoke at least a gram of bark, all at once, holding each hit in for 10 seconds, before the brief tolerance set in. Chaliponga has an even lower percentage of DMT in it. You can see how this is just not feasible.   As far as ""partially extracting"" it goes, it seems like you don't have a good grasp on the process. Starting an extraction and stopping part-way through will leave you with a nasty, basic mess. Totally unsmokable. It's the nature of the beast, you have to go through the process to achieve the results you desire. There really aren't any shortcuts, at least the way you are thinking."
DMT,3d8uj6,dmtpsychonaut,0,Tue Jul 14 14:25:40 2015 UTC,"hence the usage of quotes...  this process should actually be ""extacting"" other potentially harmful compounds so the product is richer with dmt as a consequence.  it also heavily depends on a source..."
DMT,3d8uj6,dmtpsychonaut,2,Tue Jul 14 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"Then I believe the answer you're looking for is no, it doesn't work that way."
DMT,3d8uj6,RedSteppa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"thank you.  a question though.  chacruna & chaliponga are a pain in the ass to extract. so would it make more sense to do something to this effect with them?  mimosa or acacia, it would be pointless, but with phalaris and chac. chali. it might be more viable?  when reading extraction teks for phalaris i noticed that the end product is not freebase, but greenish gue.. the problem beeing harmful gramine.  so maybe i thought, there was a way to do something similar with chacruna or chaliponga...  I'm ready to take no for an answer, as i already did, just thinking out loud really.  taking dmt from a plant might be harder than taking most of the other stuff -leaving you with higher dmt content.    one last question man, i promise :)  ""is it so, that in your opinion, chacruna or chaliponga, can not be modified to be smoked (and working), without extracting freebase first?"""
DMT,3d8uj6,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:14:34 2015 UTC,"I think you would find that it is a much bigger pain in the ass to extract all the other junk.  As far as your second question, yes that is my opinion. I'm by no means an expert, but it seems to me that you are much better off going the traditional route."
DMT,3d8uj6,RedSteppa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"but if you could ""extract"" it just enough   I don't get this. Do we extract or not? And if we do, why not doing it right?"

I still have some but you really need to space out your trips to recover from them.  Half an ounce of shrooms? That's insane.

I was just so amazed by the complexity of the hallucinations that I thought I lost it. The presence of my parents may was thought to be comforting, but it came over more like disappointment for me experimenting with this drug. I checked my steel mesh and it looks like I haven't used up half of the load I melted in, which may makes up for another adventure into the depths of my psyche tonight, but I habe to admit that I'm quite anxious. Also I got a slight headachr afterwards. Is this normal?"

DMT,3d1lik,externvoid,3,Mon Jul 13 00:24:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe we define a 'breakthrough' differently. I just consider it a breakthrough when I break into this idiosyncratic 'DMT reality' and if I am utterly astonished when I return to waking reality. I have had the experience of going beyond the alien circus and crazy entities to somewhere beyond recognition, which I cannot even recall. This was a far more powerful, titanic and 'divine' experience, but I don't necessarily regard that as the only breakthrough I've had for that reason.  This report isn't based on a specific experience. I was just able to remember a lot of the experience when stoned, so decided to write it down while I could remember. I usually smoke around 40mg in a bong layered between parsley. If I smoke it properly, it's plenty. And I might not even finish it."

I've smoked dmt five times, two of those times with reddish stuff. It was only with the jungle spice that I saw an entity.  I was also on LSD four of those times, so that might effect it."
DMT,3d0tv4,nethodsod,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:15:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah it definitely had a different feel to it, the visions were very vivid, and they weren't purely visual, I felt my body was morphing into the shapes I was seeing, or being may be a more accurate way to explain it. But I've never really seen or communited with an entity (desite doing it while candy flipping and with nitrous), would love to read your experience if you care to share."
DMT,3d0tv4,nethodsod,2,Sun Jul 12 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"I wrote something up right after I smoked, and I also drew the beast...  Here it is!   It wasn't angry. It just looked at me and thought ""I could eat that."" I wasn't thinking at the time. There wasn't really any thought in me. It was pure experience of closed eye patterns, patterns following their obvious and necessary combinatoric pathways to collesce into what we know as organic forms that we see in life. Then even the empatho-cognitive elements of the mind join in, and bestow upon the seen an animism. The form becomes alive.  I did the only thing I could do. I didn't have any ability to choose my actions, they were already chosen by the structuring of my isntincts, my self-wired heuristic thinking. Then as the forms grew together, began to move, not out of the necessary patterns, but out of a mind alone from mine. With eyes that look, and toungues that taste. Tongues that taste me upon the air. With a not quite snarl, and not quite smile. It knows it could eat me.  I stood up. Oddly dissociated from the discomfort. I calmly moved to sit down on the floor. I meditated for a few breaths and look around at a sickly colored room, so distantly near to that other places with heads looking in all directions.  I gave the most heartfelt yet broken performance of the second waltz sentimentale et noble of maurice ravel. My mind was gone from the beast. It had to be, clear its mind and focus entirely on something else, and then return to the beast.   I drew it multiple times, sitting, observing from the center of a spherical room with a single large dimple rising up from the bottom, a dimple upon which the beast perched.  I am struck with feelings that this beast is not an enemy, that would, could be... not friends, but allies, hunting brothers. I don't know what it would have to offer, or what I would have to offer, nor that I want to. Thinks this cat that curiosity killed.  It feels like it may have something to teach me, but that it would be beyond human, and just life. It would be a purely lived experience and not a cognitive one. There would be cognition many distant levels above, that guide and comprehend, but pay little attention to what is happening here.  I am also struck that following this beast could easily be a path to madness. If one is lead to experience not human, then, during that way of experiencing, one cannot righlty be called a sane human. A dog isn't a sane human either. Though I think I'd like to keep my species.   I made a few attempts to draw it right then, just before writing, but of course nothing could really capture its essence.  http://imgur.com/a/i9lQN  The fourth time I smoked DMT while on LSD, I came across a much more pleasant creature. But this was only a week after the trip described above, and I became hesitant about losing my humanity. so I exited the breakthrough and played music and sculpted for awhile.  The next time I get my hands on DMT, I plan on actually attempting communication."

I used to smoke about 20mg of jungle spice with 50mg of dmt (yellow-orange) and i could blast off on 50mg alone but the jungle spice took it to another level   Jimjam also kicks ass (red full spectrum dmt) i made changa with some and it was the weirdest trip ive ever had.

DMT,3d0m34,all_hail_sithis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:53:10 2015 UTC,"Idk where to start here so this might turn into a ramble but here we go. First off I noticed that you seem to be very self aware and reflective, so I think DMT will suit you well and teach you a lot. You were cautious enough to ask for more info before just yolo-ing it, so all in all I don't think you have to much to fear, except for the raw intensity. Nothing can prepare your for that. You might just die from sheer astonishment. The best mentor you could learn from would probably be Terrnece McKenna, here is a great video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VavdCpewQbA ~10 mins (short and sweet) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9WPoRB0-uM ~1 hr 20 mins (kinda long winded but worth it if you have time) It doesn't really matter where you take it since you wont be in your body for the trip. As long as you feel safe and don't hit your head as you leave your body you will be fine. Side note it smells awful and is like smoking mothballs. Regarding dosage, the first video addresses this pretty well. Basically you have to ignore your desire to look around the room to analyze the effects after the first and second hit. You have to just keep smoking until you literally just pass out. After two good rips you will feel weird as all hell, but if you want to break through you have to take one more hero hit. As for how to ingest DMT I hear the machine is the best option: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5LRvGR-eX8 Also last and final word of advice, BE SOBER! (At least for the first few times) She doesn't like it if you come drunk (never tried just what I've read) Good luck!"

DMT,3cwsry,tartanSwirls,13,Sat Jul 11 19:30:27 2015 UTC,here  is a story of a blind person's experience :)

DMT,3cwsry,supercerealyouguys,2,Mon Jul 13 06:40:30 2015 UTC,"My uneducated response is that it depends on how they are blind. If they are blind from retina/eye malformities, they can still visually hallucinate. If they are blind because of malformations in the parts of the brain responsible for vision, they tend not to be able to."
DMT,3cwsry,Allternator,2,Sun Jul 12 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"I think the results will vary depending on what kind of blindness we're dealing with. If the person is blind because of issues with the eyes or the optic nerves, I'm quite sure they will still experience visuals since the part of the brain that handles vision is still intact. For the same reason, many blind people can still visually dream and hallucinate.  If the blindness is due to a damaged visual cortex, however, it's a while different story since the brain wouldn't be physically able to process visual information in the same way - the visuals might be impared, inexistent or perhaps of an entirely different nature all together; perhaps synesthetic, so that the person can ""hear"" the visuals or otherwise experience them via their other senses.  Edit: grammar"
DMT,3cwsry,Paragonswift,5,Sun Jul 12 21:43:05 2015 UTC,I don't think they were implying to just throw some random blind person into it. I would imagine at least one blind person has tried or wanted to try DMT which in no way would be disrespectful.

The dmt trip at high doses is not just an alteration of ""normal"" reality. Everything I've ever seen on dmt is completely alien to me, nothing really looks vaguely familiar to objects in our world. So therefor I've come to the conclusion myself that it is indeed another reality or the deep space of your mind. Or both! ;) anyways I hope this have you some insight.

DMT,3cwgio,BaseTwelve,2,Sat Jul 11 23:59:48 2015 UTC,"I know it's weird but I mean stuff like focusing on my meditation practice, building out a social life that I'm happy with (I'm somewhat of a loner), doing more self-introspection with other psychedelics, and just gaining more life experience.   That doesn't sound weird at all. That sounds like several very clear and specific goals. From my reading here, a lot of people get caught up in the language of ""breakthrough"" but that often means that you're expecting something from the experience while downplaying your own role and preparedness for such an experience.  It sounds like you've been given a gift of understanding regarding where you are on your path. There's great wisdom in knowing what you are ready for, and where you need more time and practice. I would trust the experience you had and not worry so much about whether it was a ""breakthrough"" or not. There was a lesson there, regardless. You have plenty to do, and as you said, there is plenty to learn from other psychedelics on your path back to DMT."

DMT,3cxg2v,besttek,3,Sat Jul 11 17:17:19 2015 UTC,No problem with that at all. If there's anything left it will still be there when you get back to it. After 2-3 pulls however and we're talking a minimum amount to be retrieved assuming you did good in those first few pulls.
DMT,3cxg2v,Dcomplex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:28:00 2015 UTC,3 pulls is enough. After you dry out your stuff if you have enough I say dump the goo. Never good to leave that soup laying around too long but if you must a cool dry dark place is best. I found if leaving any excess nap in the soup will discolor it and your next pull will have more impurities. You can always reuse the nap from the freezer after you freeze precip.
DMT,3cxg2v,Demty,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:17:23 2015 UTC,"You could do the last pull with another solvent, xylene, and get an even more out there experience it pulls dmt and other hallucinagens that are not known (speculated but not conclusively known). It's called jungle spice or dark DMT. It's got a distinct different trip, might be worth a shot. Can be bought at Ace or other hardware stores. Good luck!"

DMT,3ctdv3,RedSteppa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:37:58 2015 UTC,I've been smoking it for a few months now weekly and this was the first time that it was overwhelming/negative.

DMT,3ctdv3,ArmouredRat,2,Fri Jul 10 18:19:02 2015 UTC,"the overwhelmingness, from my experience, is the moment of the onset of the 'true' dmt experience. It's at that time you'd probably do well to 'let go' as they say, and become completely dissolved into the experience. To me the overwhelmingness is like the doorway to the breakthrough. If you can get through the door, glory and horrors await on the other side unlike anything you could imagine."
DMT,3ctdv3,Xavon,3,Fri Jul 10 18:39:29 2015 UTC,"With 15+ DMT trips on my belt, I agree with this completely. If you never felt overwhelmed before, the chances are that you haven't been smoking very high doses.   The real DMT trips begin when you let go from this world. You won't remember this place exists or that you even have a body. If you haven't seen it yet or been there, you have a lot to look forwards to. Good luck!"
DMT,3ctdv3,munkomanko,2,Fri Jul 10 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"Like /u/Xavon said down below, the truly deep DMT experiences occur when you are completely overwhelmed, to the point of abandoning your physical body"

DMT,3cp2t6,calson29,32,Thu Jul 9 17:07:33 2015 UTC,DMT made me completely stop  social media stalking and getting depressed over my ex... it was so weird and unintended but the day after the trip i finally decided to just go out to a bar... my luck was on point and the first girl i decided to talk to had an instant connection and i finally got some new poontang. DMT the ultimate wingman
DMT,3cp2t6,meet_THEM_do_DMT,11,Thu Jul 9 18:50:16 2015 UTC,DMT is remarkably good at helping people see their addictions for what they are.

DMT,3cp2t6,WS_Beast,6,Thu Jul 9 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"I've honestly had some really bad experiences on LSD. I thought it was the dosage at first. But even on small doses my mind would wander to dark places. I've vowed to never take LSD again. I have not tried DMT since the bad LSD trips. On a DMT trip one time I was positioned looking at a single tree in a back yard. Once it hit me I noticed the branches turning into Asian faces. There was nothing symmetric about the faces. They seemed to be looking off in different directions. Once I moved past these faces I noticed in the middle of the tree branches there was a Buddha-like figure sitting in the lotus positron. Although this didn't really change my thoughts on religion, it made me wonder why I saw what I did."

To this day I still know most of the major secrets of the cosmos, no matter what I do to try and pretend to myself I don't.  I'm, like, the worst omnipotent being ever.  Anyways, that thing you see is the thing that supposed to keep you from crossing over the abyss.  Ignore it if you want.  It can't do shit to you if you don't give it any power, and it only exists to make you mess up your own journey out of fear and misdirection.

DMT,3cr35e,belac9001,3,Fri Jul 10 02:28:28 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. DMT is completely different to mushrooms, for me anyway, and an entirely different experience. There really isn't  anything I've tried that I could compare it to. Don't get me wrong, it is intense but the experience is worth it."

Worst case, you have a wierd trip and lose your shit for a couple of minutes, but ... you can try again~   It's fun to explore, and the first time I got caught in a dmt loop I was more than a little bit scared, but it's actually really fun the second time."
DMT,3cr35e,mackthetemp,5,Fri Jul 10 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"It's funny how you start to enjoy ""bad"" DMT trips after you've experienced a few :) Letting go is crucial, like you said, which is a skill learned most easily with DMT."

DMT,3cr35e,mackthetemp,3,Fri Jul 10 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"The more you struggle to gain control, the worse your trip will be and you learn this lesson rather quickly. I guess you could say that it teaches you to let go using negative reinforcement .  If you're smoking a breakthrough dose of dmt, worst case you have a bad trip that you'll be out of in a short time and you try again. Even if your trip goes in a horrible direction and you deal with it poorly you will be fine in an hour. The same cannot be said for other psychedelics."
DMT,3cr35e,gnovos,2,Fri Jul 10 17:47:39 2015 UTC,So completely different.
DMT,3cr35e,mqduck,2,Fri Jul 10 05:53:14 2015 UTC,"If you're worried, just take a small hit of DMT to start off with. I find a small amount of DMT less stressful and more ""recreational"" than other psychedellics. The duration is so short, you can just work your way up from there within the space of a single afternoon."

DMT,3cr35e,mqduck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:24:16 2015 UTC,"I mixed LSA and DMT once. Psychedellics are normally a pretty anxiety-inducing experience for me, and this LSA trip was no exception. But not only did the DMT not add to that problem, every time I hit the DMT-charged vaporizer my LSA-induced anxiety melted away in favor of a euphoric giddiness. Coming down off the DMT was slowly stressful (because the LSA stress came back), redosing was calming and blissful. It was the opposite of what I'd come to expect from psychedellics."
DMT,3cr35e,trippyhippiechick910,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:38:10 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a wonderful dmt experience :) I've never tried LSA, but I am prone to bad anxiety with mushrooms and occasionally on LSD so maybe I should stay away from that."
DMT,3cr35e,mqduck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:56:26 2015 UTC,"LSA is almost entirely like LSD. It's supposedly a bit less visual, but I didn't notice even that difference. In any case, mushrooms are far less anxiety inducing for me than LSA or LSD. So this all is yet more evidence that the effects of psychedellics vary drastically from person to person (and trip to trip). From the sound of it, I wouldn't suspect LSA to be something you should specifically stay away from. You should probably expect more or less the same experience you get with LSD.  EDIT: Also, the visuals were so great! It caused strong open eye visuals like I'd never experience before. The ends of everything I looked at, especially natural objects (vegetation and such) spiraled into fractally wonderfulness. It was like if every plant you looked as was doing this but animated in real time."
DMT,3cr35e,trippyhippiechick910,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:01:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that! You're so right, it does vary greatly between people. I am definitely going to consider it if I can get ahold of some. Those visuals sound wonderful!"
DMT,3cr35e,mqduck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:05:51 2015 UTC,"Quite wonderful! But just in case it wasn't clear, I was describing visuals brought on by LSA and DMT together, not LSA alone. By itself, LSA is basically just LSD. The main difference for me is that with LSA I can actually go to sleep later than night."

I didn't really see reality warping and walking around with galaxies and fractals on the walls. Eyes closed. More like a visual dream.  Try the rue out by itself a few days before. So you know when it peaks and to get used to the awful taste. My only other big tip. Just let the purge come. So much better.  I have a trip report I posted. The one right before was my setup. I had a mason jar. Bag o rags from lowes. Fresh lemon. Root bark and syrian  rue.
DMT,3coya6,djwonderful,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:57:33 2015 UTC,"hey hey thanks so much.   I keep hearing about the purge, a little nervous about it.

DMT,3coya6,dmtpsychonaut,2,Fri Jul 10 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"Below is how I prepared mine a while back:   I did 3-4g Syrian rue boiled 3 times and strained in water with a dash of lemon juice. Make sure you crush or grind the rue well, they're tough seeds. An industrial strength coffee grinder will do the trick or what I did was smash all the seeds with pliers. That took a while but was effective. For the ACRB, I used... I can't really remember the exact amount. Maybe 6g? Anyway, I prepared this in the same way as the rue tea: boiled 3 times in water with a dash of lemon juice. Drink the rue tea first and wait for effects to kick in. The drink the ACRB tea (yuck) and make sure you have a good place to purge once you start to feel the nausea start. You can boil the tea with an egg to reduce nausea but I haven't tried that myself. The nausea wasn't super bad for me, but I definitely purged for about 20 minutes. As always, be sure you know about any dangerous food/medicine combinations. MAOIs can be deadly if you aren't careful. Let us know how it goes!   The first time, I literally only drank one gulp of the acacia brew (after taking the Syrian rue) and that was enough for a 4 hour journey. When the purge happens you may think you fucked up and are going to die. It will pass. Make sure your boyfriend knows this and can calm you down if necessary. Don't overdo it: this is powerful, powerful stuff. There was someone who posted a couple weeks ago about freaking out and calling an ambulance for himself so really go easy and feel it out the first time. Good luck and happy travels!"

You need a carb cap for one of your domeless nails. Go ahead and weigh out 70mg of dmt (yes 70mg i have a feeling you aren't fucking around, that will literally guarantee an immersive break through). So anyway load about that fine herb inside of the carb cap. Try not to lose any through the hole. Put it aside. Start like fucking prepping your lungs to hold in the biggest hit of your life. Heat the nail up, pretty much red hot. Pause, let that bitch cool down. Like i usually will take 30 seconds doing some breathing exercise type shit, and mentally be like (here we go, here we go, its time). Carefully dump the dmt on the nail while carbing the nail at the same exact time. Like a perfectly executed COVER/DUMP at once. While your doing this start inhaling as soon as a little dmt gets on the nail. PULL SLOWLY AT FIRST. Fill the rig up, use the biggest fucking one you got. Then gun it full lung strength as you proceed to REMOVE THE CARB (WHILE SIMELTANSLY TAPPING IT TO GET WHATEVERS LEFT. Inhale as much as possibly, the whole hit is always possible to get.

DMT,3cos3k,RedSteppa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"I kept everything just in case. Unfortunately I didn't take any pictures. I will take pictures of the results when I pull the dishes from my freezer tonight.   On a side note, I'm really enjoying this learning experience. I've never tried dmt, but I want my first experience to be from something I made."

DMT,3clodo,dmtpsychonaut,2,Wed Jul 8 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"Were the leaves infused with DMT only or a maoi also? If the fist is the case it wouldn't be called changa, as changa also contains a maoi.  Nevertheless enhanced leaf (that's what dmt infused leaf is generally called) is a great method!"
DMT,3clvyt,jthammons1796,4,Wed Jul 8 22:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not in a party or group atmosphere and probably not at breakthrough doses."
DMT,3clvyt,samwhiskey,2,Wed Jul 8 22:44:30 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think you get the most out of it in a calm environment. If your friends are quiet and respectful and you don't mind opening yourself up to the experience in front of others, it's a great recreational compound. If it's loud and everyone's drunk, probably not the best idea. I enjoy it best alone... I don't like ""performing"" for others when I blast off. I need privacy."
DMT,3clvyt,smokinjoe65,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:08:18 2015 UTC,"I tried it for the first time last night, and I couldn't agree with this more. The group was way to big, to many people messing with me, but none the less I loved it. I think I could have broke through had it been calmer. It was a mind blowing experience and I can't wait to do it again."
DMT,3clvyt,auto180sx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:43:03 2015 UTC,"Anything you do in your free time is by definition recreational. That said I consider DMT's purpose to be healing, in a very broad sense. What others consider it to be for is their business I don't judge."

DMT,3clvyt,LA-shroomer,-3,Thu Jul 9 02:48:42 2015 UTC,"Considering it has no therapeutic purpose, and therefore can not be abused as a prescription drug, I could only conclude that it is a truly recreational drug."
DMT,3clvyt,NorthCat1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:23:06 2015 UTC,...no recognized therapeutic purpose...   I personally find it to be therapeutic and fun!
DMT,3clvyt,dmtpsychonaut,-1,Thu Jul 9 11:57:20 2015 UTC,"I would really stress not calling it therapeutic, only insofar as that is misleading.  I love and use recreational drugs, but I strongly advise against the non-prescribed use of prescription drugs, for various societal reasons, and it's important for those two distinct families of drugs to remain distinct   Sorry about getting intense, this is just a somewhat important political issue for me."
DMT,3clvyt,NorthCat1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:27:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah no worries, I get you. I definitely wouldn't describe it to anyone as a therapeutic drug but I do think that if studies were allowed to be conducted with DMT, somebody would find a therapeutic use for it."
DMT,3clvyt,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:57:27 2015 UTC,It certainly has some fantastic potential and is (probably) looked upon by many with an undue stigma associated with it.

DMT,3clz3m,mulderwasondrugs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:08:17 2015 UTC,"In my experience with cybs tek, orange naphtha means it has collected a lot of fats and your final product will be gooey. You can recrystallize the goo though, in order to get a better product.   See if you can find a different vessel to pull from. I've found that a Voss water bottle works really well. You could also get a magnum bottle of wine or handle of liquor (something with a screw top obviously). The narrow neck will make it much easier to pull 50mL off of the top. The other option is to purchase a separatory funnel.  As far as leaving the jar for 16 hours, that is absolutely fine. Safe travels!  Edit: I'm assuming you are working with ACRB, correct?"
DMT,3clz3m,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:34:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply  I assumed as much, does this mean the entire mixture will be turn out orange or just this current pull? Yeah, a wine bottle would be perfect actually. It seems as though it would take a lot of practice to get it nailed down to a tee  No, working with MHRB"
DMT,3clz3m,Demty,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:46:41 2015 UTC,Depending on your method of agitation and heat during extraction it will determine the color. I've had yellowish orange nap but still great product. Years and years ago I would have the same issue but still produced excellent squishy.
DMT,3clz3m,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:38:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm. My experience has been with acacia, which is a lot fattier than mimosa. Maybe it won't be gooey for you, I'm not sure...   Let me know how it turns out for you!"
DMT,3clz3m,Demty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:52:52 2015 UTC,Next time try using 75-100 ml of nap so you can pull it. You may need to evap half of the clear nap you pull but when working with such small amounts you might have to. Instead of shaking try rolling and swirling. Seems like when using MHRB less agitation is okay compared to AC. Pull out that yellow as good as you can before doing a second pull. Pull it all out into a clean jar and it's fine if you get black too. Key is to pull out your first pull entirely to another jar that likely with contain the orange nap and lots of goo. Let that jar settle and you'll be able to pour off clean orange nap into a second clean jar leaving goo behind in the jar you basted into. Throw that clear orange nap sealed in the freezer and leave it for a day or two. Likely get some goodies stuck on the bottom. If it doesn't dry to powder you'll need to work a little harder or start from scratch. For MHRB you really should take a peek at lazymans.
DMT,3clz3m,tartanSwirls,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:25:56 2015 UTC,"Cheers, I think that might do the trick.  Initially did look at lazymans, the yield put me off though, correct me if I'm wrong but 500g of MHRB only yeilds 1g?"
DMT,3clz3m,Demty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:04:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure off the top of my head but you should get a few grams at least. A buddy of mine reckons he's had about 7g out of 250g of mhrb, apparently quite a bit more than expected, but he hasn't kept track."
DMT,3ckbci,LewisOnDXM,2,Wed Jul 8 16:05:13 2015 UTC,Alright friend here ha go. I wasted a ton of dmt by touching the flame directly to it. You want to hold the lighter flame about 2 inches below the dmt. It vaporizes at a low temp so you absolutely do not want to burn it. Just heat it up gradually until you have a massive hit and then go for it. Rinse repeat. You might want a buddy close by to take the pipe and/or help you heat it up as it becomes physically impossible for you to light it. Best of luck!
DMT,3ckbci,ysl51,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:06:02 2015 UTC,Thanks!
DMT,3cjy90,Sickofbeingscared,2,Wed Jul 8 14:27:05 2015 UTC,"Hey mate. Touching story.  It might indeed help you to sort some of your feelings out. Nevertheless my advice would be...don't rush it. Incrase the dose slightly. If you tried 15mg the last time...maybe go for 20mg, then 25mg etc.   Try to calm your mind before going in. Load your device (what ever you are using), get everything ready, make yourself comfortable. And then...just sit. Sit and focus on your intention. Do this a few minutes. When you feel calm and (more or less) ready...dive in.  And besides all the strange emotions and body sensations you might feel...you ALWAYS WILL come back fine.   You might want to read this text as it's one of the best in this sub...imho."
DMT,3cjy90,RedSteppa,2,Wed Jul 8 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the kind words. I will just take it slow. I'm in a good mental state. I mean those are everyday thoughts. I feel good and excited about learning what is has to show me. I just get nervous and fight it. As I am so stubborn.   I'm scarred. I need healing. There is no changing my thoughts....yet. I'm hoping this will ...no fuck that, I know this will help me."
DMT,3cjy90,RedSteppa,3,Wed Jul 8 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"Hehehe...one thing: Don't try to force your trip in a certain direction. I'm pretty sure DMT might give you what you need (which may be different from what you want)...if you let it do it's thing. Don't try to take control of the trip (this probably won't work with higher doses), but instead let everything go and just try to observe. To observe what the molecule has to show you. Lessons may be learned then. :)  I can absolutly understand your nervousness. Especially if these are your first times working with this molecule. This might settle a bit for further trips but probably never will completely fade. At least it didn't for me...in nearly 3 years of use.   When you realize that you fight against it, when coming up...focus on your intention. Focus on that you WANT to do and this focus on why you do this and then just lean back and lay your fate in the hands of the molecule. It WILL take care of you in a nice warm and loving way, IF you just let it. I'm sure.  Also...it's a perfectly normal reaction that one fights a bit against it. So quickly so many unknown/unfamilar sensations come up and the body might want to react to this unknown rush. This is normal. It's the fear of the unknown I guess. You and DMT just need to get to know each other better...the better you get to know each other, the less fear there will be.  I wish you all the best for this awesome journey into your own mind my friend.   And tell us how was mate! We'd love to read your report.   Love and light for you!"
DMT,3cjy90,RedSteppa,2,Wed Jul 8 15:45:30 2015 UTC,This made me smile. I can't wait til I am at the level of comfort you guys are at. I will take your advice and really try to let go. Focus on the intention and let it ride.  I know I am trying to analyze everything because like you said I am so new to this.  I will give you a report my good man.

DMT,3cjc8e,forestofbonsai,2,Wed Jul 8 11:13:18 2015 UTC,"I've used bigass Mason jars with positive results. Also those Voss water bottles are pretty good, they're only 800mL though so not much better than what you've got. You could also get a magnum-sized wine bottle or a handle of liquor (1.5L and 1.75L respectively)."
DMT,3cjc8e,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:18:08 2015 UTC,Go to Michaels they used to have 1500 ml mason jars. Any large arts and craft stores work. Preferably one with a sealable top. A wide mouth 1 gallon jar I saw at Walmart would be excellent! Stores in US btw.
DMT,3cfndo,lichtgestalten,3,Tue Jul 7 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"Hallo ;)  I'd say...give it some time. Don't rush things. If you are able to feel comfortable with the thought of using a VERY strong hallucinogen then you could give it a go. Maybe even extract it yourself. This will aid to a good mindset/relationship with this substance.   I don't think that the trip will ""replay"" that night. But yes, it certainly IS intense."
DMT,3cfndo,RedSteppa,2,Tue Jul 7 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer!  i have read that sub-breakthrough doses are kind of ""unconfortables""... is that true?"

DMT,3cfndo,smokinjoe65,2,Tue Jul 7 20:03:32 2015 UTC,thank you for your point of view mate
DMT,3cfndo,smokinjoe65,3,Tue Jul 7 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"DMT won't make you replay past events/trips, in my experience. It's very unpredictable in how it carries you through a trip. If you go in with a clear, happy mind it will treat you well and you'll have a wonderful experience. Even if you're worried about it beforehand, you probably won't remember the fear once you break thtough. I've had less than ideal DMT trips but they always bring you back gently. Mind you, on sub-breakthrough doses I used to explore memories and dreams, but I had a good amount of control over where my mind wandered (only during sub-breakthrough doses)."
DMT,3cfndo,globaldu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:37:32 2015 UTC,"thank you man!!   DMT won't make you replay past events/trips,   nice to see some ""clear"" info <3,   should aim for a low dosage or breakthough for the very first time? are sub-breakthrough doses hard to deal (i read a lot about sub-breakthrough doses, and most ppl say that are unconfortables)?"
DMT,3cfndo,Cosmonaut15,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:25:16 2015 UTC,I used to snort solely for the ability to linger in sub-breakthrough head spaces. It was great for exploring memories and dreams I wanted to go through again. Shoot for a breakthrough dose and go from there. I have a feeling you'll be able to figure out what you want out of it all at that point.

DMT,3ceui9,EarlyPinning,2,Tue Jul 7 10:45:43 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience in my first two tries. The first try i was very nervous, the second, not so much.  I got a big bodyload, and my body felt strange. Paranoia creeped up, and i started thinking ""i didn't extract DMT, this is filled with toxic impurities, that's why this feels so strange"".  As another one mentioned, the effects are exponential with the dose. Increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg, is going to do a lot more than double the effect, keep that in mind.  I'm not gonna advice you to go all in, just because you don't have enough left for 2 ""big trips"" , that choice is yours to make. Remember, it's not the end of the world to ""waste"" a little (especially, if it helps with your later trips). No haste, there will always be a another time."

My SO and I have used this tek and followed it to a T, and we've got some good goo out of it, but we're trying (and failing) to get crystals :( what would you say is the best way to get crystals with this tek? Any crystals we do get just end up melting and we've tried a few things read from nexus and here, but still nothing seems to work. I live in central US and this time of year we have high humidity which I've read can effect it, but any tips? We've only extracted twice, and have had some good experiences but I feel (compared to what I've read of other people's break through's) that we've only hit the tip of the iceberg so far.   Any advice appreciated!"
DMT,3cdlut,smokinjoe65,3,Thu Jul 9 00:43:04 2015 UTC,"Do you have pics you could link? If not, try to snap a few during your next extraction, specifically the freeze precip phase (right out of the freezer and the end result). Are you being careful to avoid pulling basified mix into your pulls? This is the main source of nasty goo that you want to avoid. There are good types of goo, however. Also, are you heating your mix during your pulls? If so, what temp? Heating your solvent readies more bond sites for DMT to attach to, but making it too hot will make your solvent pull other stuff (other alkaloids, mainly, nothing harmful). This is where a lot of goo comes from, from my experience. I heat mine to 120-125Â°F. Also, heating will make your solvent pull in more DMT per pull so you don't need to do 5 pulls. I do 3, usually. But, again, the convenience of fewer pulls means I have to recrystallize to get the little bit of yellow goo out of my product. Feel free to ask any questions. That's why a lot of us linger around this subreddit, to help others on the same path."
DMT,3cdlut,thisismerealname,2,Thu Jul 9 06:55:08 2015 UTC,"I don't currently have any pics, but will take some on the next attempt. The husband has been the main brains behind the operation as he's done more research etc. So I'll tell you what I know from helping him as I've done a lot of the actual pulls vs mixing. When I pull, I will take a big clean chunk w/ a turkey baster (which is not easy it tends to leak out quickly lol), then I just use an eye dropper. If I do pull any base on accident, I'll take whatever I have in the eye dropper and put it in a dapper dish and then use a clean eye dropper for the remainder of the pull, and then pull what's separated from the dapper dish. So I try as hard as possible to not get any base in the dish that goes to the freezer. We do heat the mix using a crock pot and will keep it on low and let it sit in there after adding the solvent and then between mixes with the solvent. We do heat the solvent up before adding it to the mix, it may be that we are getting it too hot, so I'll keep an eye on that next time as well. It just seems like what crystals we do get, end up melting once we pull it from the freezer :/ The best luck we had was when we re-crystallized, we still didn't get any crystals, but the goo we did get was much better than previous pulls.   It may be a couple weeks before we try again, when we do I'll hopefully have a good update with pics of some nice crystals lol. Thanks again for the input!"
DMT,3cdlut,smokinjoe65,3,Thu Jul 9 22:18:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about heating your solvent if you're using a crock pot to heat your mix. When you add your solvent the mix should get it up to temp as you put it into solution. I've tried several styles of mixing my pulls, the worst being the rolling/tilting method. I tilt my vessel like this (http://imgur.com/kC1dugR) and stir at a medium speed in a circular motion to evenly distribute my solvent so it grabs as much DMT as it can. I've done 10 minute mixes with 5 minutes to settle x3 which worked well, but it's just as good to do 5 minute mixes with 5 minutes to settle x4 or 5, then pull. The goal is to thoroughly incorporate your solvent into the mix so it can grab all of the DMT as it moves through the solution to settle at the top. Hope that illustrates it well enough so you can figure out what works best for the two of you."
DMT,3cdlut,thisismerealname,2,Thu Jul 9 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"That does help! We've actually been doing the rolling/tilting style so that could be another issue... we only make the batches 50g ACRB at a time and use a mason jar with the lid, we'll make larger batches once we perfect the tek lol"
DMT,3cdlut,smokinjoe65,2,Fri Jul 10 00:42:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah 100g batches are fairly standard. I do 50g since I get decent yields and it's more than enough for myself (helps that I'm sensitive to it, too... 20mg breakthroughs make a supply last longer :) )"
DMT,3cdlut,CensureBars,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"In the tek linked to, salt is added before basifying. Is this what you mean? I was confused as well because the notes imply the tek can be adapted for ACRB, but then the salt step is there in the directions. So does that mean the tek OP linked IS the tek adapted for ACRB? Sorry if that's confusing."

DMT,3cbajl,Mordred7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:55:20 2015 UTC,Looks like you weren't successful. Should of been covered with crystals that look like salt. You started with at least 100g of powder? People using less than a lb seem to have more difficulty. Go big. All the nap is gone when it all evaporates. The white dots may contain a little d but not enough to form crystals you can smoke. Did you agitate the solution enough? Did you do 3x boils? Did you add enough lye? I suggest adding more lye and use a hot water bath to heat up your goo then try another nap pull a after agitating for longer. Add the nap and shake it or stir vigorously make sure your using gloves and goggles. Then let it sit for an hour and then do the pull. I usually shake/stir for 10-15 minutes let it sit for an hour to separate then pull it. All while it's toasty in a hot water bath.
DMT,3cbajl,Demty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"50g of acrb.  I pretty much did just what the tek says. Dunno what the 3x boils is referring to so probably not. 50g of lye.    I usually shake/stir for 10-15 minutes let it sit for an hour to separate then pull it.   10-15 minutes straight? yeah i definitely didn't do that much. After I added the naptha i rolled it for like 20 secs, once it separated, rolled it again and so on for 3 or 4 repeats.   Appreciate the feedback though, apparently I'm not mixing well enough."
DMT,3cbajl,Demty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:16:06 2015 UTC,I think you went STB. You didn't strain out the solid matter right? For AC it's recommended to A/B the mix meaning do the acid/vinegar boil then sep the liquid from the goo and repeat 3x. It takes forever then you boil the liquid to reduce it.  Check out Joshison's Tek it is excellent for AB extraction with AC and when it cools and you have a cloudy naphtha after the pull you know the goodies are there. Heard you net around 5-10g from 500g.  That Tek you used says to AB if using AC. STB and ATB doesn't work well with AC only MHRB as stated to use in Tek.  Stb works with MHRB... AB extraction for Acacia Confusa... Seems like the general rule for great results.
DMT,3cbajl,Demty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:36:31 2015 UTC,So basically you can't swap out the mimosa for acrb with this tek?
DMT,3cbajl,smokinjoe65,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:38:14 2015 UTC,Your going to want to use an A/B method. I've seen so many posts with your exact problem using stb and AC. Acid/vinegar boil is the way to go. You can't go wrong tossing in a few grams of lye and then trying again with what you already have. It's possible that the solution isn't basified enough to migrate to the non polar solvent.
DMT,3cbajl,Demty,2,Tue Jul 7 03:53:18 2015 UTC,"Cyb's is a ATB tek. When /u/demty is talking about boiling and separating I assume they are referring to chopped bark, where I assume you're using powdered so disregard the boiling. I'd guess you need to stir/separate instead of roll/separate. Do it for a few minutes, settle and sep, repeat x3 or 4. You had good product in your dish but it looks like the excess naphtha redissolved it. Pour off the excess and tip it on its side quick. Here's how I dry mine... http://imgur.com/Htu97mq  Notice on the right dish how the lower portion contains fewer crystal deposits. I do this so that if naphtha drips down the dish, it won't settle in/pass through my good product. BTW, I, too, use 50g of root bark. Going big means more potential for fucking up a lot of root bark powder. Besides, 50g yields plenty for one person... no need to stockpile."

DMT,3cbuhm,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:57:11 2015 UTC,"Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A:       Reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) are a class of drugs which selectively and reversibly inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). They are used clinically in the treatment of depression and dysthymia, though they have not gained widespread market share in the United States. Because of their reversibility and selectivity, RIMAs are safer than the older monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like phenelzine and tranylcypromine.  RIMAs are displaced from MAO-A in the presence of tyramine,  rather than inhibiting its breakdown in the liver as general MAOIs do. Additionally, MAO-B remains free and continues to metabolize tyramine in the stomach, although this is less significant than the liver action. Thus, RIMAs are unlikely to elicit tyramine-mediated hypertensive crisis, and a special diet does not need to be so strictly adhered to.  While safer than general MAOIs, RIMAs still have highly dangerous and sometimes fatal interactions with many common drugs; in particular, they can cause serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis when combined with almost any antidepressant or stimulant, common migraine medications, certain herbs, or even most cold medicines (including decongestants, antihistamines, and cough syrup).

To me, the fact that you've been told it has to be put in water makes it even sketchier, as I've never heard or seen this.

Chew it. You can go on a full vision quest for an hour with a mellow come up but still get to the same intensity which lasts longer, allowing you to fully explore the space.  Here's my detailed post about this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Salvia/comments/3c643f/dont_smoke_salvia_chew_it/"
DMT,3c54we,Luxjur,3,Sun Jul 5 00:36:02 2015 UTC,"This is how the shamans did it. If you want to know the specifics let me know, I'd love to help:) Im in love with this plant."
DMT,3c54we,Luxjur,3,Sun Jul 5 00:37:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks I've never tried salvia, gonna try and get my hands on some now! Never knew you could chew it"
DMT,3c54we,Ronbomb,3,Sun Jul 5 00:58:01 2015 UTC,"you need significantly more, i bought 28 grams on the internet and 2 grams to chew is the minimum for it to be active, 8 is probably more than you'd want, so maybe chew 5 grams? if the leaf is dry, soak it in a bowl of water for a few minutes and then spoon it up in your mouth or make it into a ball and leave it in your mouth for 30 minutes, youll start feeling it after 15 minutes of it being in your mouth probably. And if you do it sitting up or laying down with your eyes closed, youll have a very intense experience assuming you take enough.  PS, try not to swallow too much spit that starts building up after a while, because it is absorbed through the tissue under your tongue and gums, and it mostly destroyed in your stomach.  Have a trancedental vision quest <3"
DMT,3c54we,Luxjur,2,Sun Jul 5 01:10:59 2015 UTC,You dont have to swallow it right? If so how long after chewing do you spit out what you're chewing?
DMT,3c54we,Johndamon77,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:54:38 2015 UTC,"You spit it out if it gets too intense, I personally hold it under my tongue and chew it here and there every few minutes, hold it under my tongue, and swish the saliva around for 30 minutes before spitting it out, which is pretty standard, I also try to keep as much of the saliva in my mouth after spitting it out, and slowly swallow little amounts, because the back of your mouth right before where it swallow absorbs alot more than other parts of the mouth. Each wave of absorption starts coming on in about fifteen minutes. So halfway through the 30 minutes you start feeling some of it. At the 30 spit it out if you're ready:) Maybe start chewing on a second ball/roll if you feel like it.  And then it's up hill for a bit.   Id love to hear your experience if you do it! Ive had lots of fun doing this,  but sometimes if I'm laying down and I haven't slept in a while I fall asleep somewhere during it, which is fun too! But maybe be well rested. Also it makes your dreams very vivid for the following nights.  PS. The taste can be unbearable if its your first time, but you don't taste it once its settled under your tongue or your gums much, its also much less bitter once you soak the leaves in the water beforehand."
DMT,3c54we,Luxjur,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:04:19 2015 UTC,"I would love to know the specifics, I have had nothing but terrifying experiences."
DMT,3c54we,PacificTrashVortex,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:38:07 2015 UTC,Of course! I'm happy to expose people to the full potential of the experience.
DMT,3c54we,Luxjur,2,Sun Jul 5 04:41:43 2015 UTC,"Heres a post I just made explaining this method.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Salvia/comments/3c643f/dont_smoke_salvia_chew_it/   Hope this helps! The method is often called ""quidding"", so you could also find more information on Google."
DMT,3c54we,Luxjur,8,Sun Jul 5 04:43:22 2015 UTC,Salivia divinorum is very intense. But completely different from DMT. Salvia can be pretty harsh. And I don't mean harsh on the throat.
DMT,3c54we,RedSteppa,8,Sat Jul 4 22:17:53 2015 UTC,"DMT is like the best time of your life with the beautiful, gentle, caring girl of your dreams. Salvia is like being butt fucked by a large inmate named Tiny Tim."
DMT,3c54we,PacificTrashVortex,3,Sun Jul 5 04:35:54 2015 UTC,Salvia sucks. Its death in a terrifying way. DMT is death in a good way.
DMT,3c54we,odix,3,Sun Jul 5 02:00:30 2015 UTC,"When the traditional shamans learned that Salvia divinorum was smoked they were appalled! They said that this would make the spirit of Salvia very unhappy!  Some people actually speculate that the TRUE active ingredient in Salvia divinorum breaks down into Salvinorin A & B when the plant is dried, therefore most people who have used Salvia divinorum in the Western World have not had a ""true"" Salvia divinorum experience."
DMT,3c54we,Luxjur,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:10:51 2015 UTC,"It's mostly a sublingual thing, right? And is there some certain way to prepare it? I have yet to try it but when I do I want to get the method right."
DMT,3c54we,chrismatt999,3,Sun Jul 5 07:03:56 2015 UTC,"I have smoked DMT numerous times.  It has at times been healing, spiritual and mind blowing.  Often the experience for me is scary and super intense but I always walk away having received something positive and wanting to return.  DMT on the other hand....  I have chewed Salvia leafs and had a great experience.  An even greater experience was with a salvia tincture taken sublingualy with my wife.  It very empathic with aphrodisiac qualities.    After these positive experiences I smoked a 25x extract. Instantly my view twisted 180 degrees and I was looking up at myself standing in an alley with brownstone buildings on either side (I lived in Manhattan t the time.) and chain linked fence.  I was shaking the hand of a man sharply dressed in a suite. He was pure evil times 1000.  At that point the scene shattered into hundreds of pieces like a broken mirror while at the same time I felt the fractured scene was my ego shattering into hundreds of pieces.  My ego never died, it just fragmented.  It was one of the most terrifying experience of my life with no redeeming value.    A few months after I tried chewing salvia leaf and felt myself returning to an evil head space and had to abort.  I haven't done it since.  YMMV"
DMT,3c54we,PsyAntIst,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:21:10 2015 UTC,How did you abort ?
DMT,3c54we,Pinealforest,2,Sun Jul 5 05:46:31 2015 UTC,The effects from chewing salvia come on slowly.  As I started to feel the efects I didn't like where I thought things were going and simple stopped chewing before things got more intense.
DMT,3c54we,PsyAntIst,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:16:46 2015 UTC,I think he means he stopped doing salvia after this experience.
DMT,3c54we,ThouArtNaught,3,Mon Jul 6 08:14:39 2015 UTC,If you can get an active dose then Salvia can be just as intense with non of the enjoyable effects. Salvia is most like DMTs evil cousin. I've only smoked it though and never chewed it.   Now the extracts are somehow labeled higher xx but they're weaker relative to what we first began exploring with years ago.

DMT,3c54we,Luxjur,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:13:01 2015 UTC,Sounds to me like Dipping a nightmare into an amazing dream. Wouldn't recommend. But it's a neat idea.
DMT,3c5wld,Luxjur,2,Sun Jul 5 03:06:34 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience with LSD before this, where the plants could speak in visible language and had personalities, but it was a terrible experience: they were very crude in their humor and made me feel that I was being laughed at, I don't know if I did something to upset them or the fact that I was was seeing their nature via LSD bothered them, or even more likely that since the species of plants I was surrounded by on my first LSD trip were different and lived in a different environment, they therefore had a different personality, which rubbed me the wrong way and turned the experience into a nightmare. I guess even plants can be mean.  So it could be possible that the DMT experience triggered this feeling of panic and anxiety because it was so similar to my nightmare LSD trip, and I felt like I was back in it. But the plants I communicated with through their own medium did manage to make me feel loved and safe.  Just some background info :)"
DMT,3c5wld,meet_THEM_do_DMT,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:20:08 2015 UTC,"Thats 100% what happened. It wasn't similar to the LSD trip, it most likely was your brain reconstructing similar motifs from its memory. You see that neural network trip picture thing? The brain just runs input through a loop of past experiences."
DMT,3c5wld,smokinjoe65,2,Sun Jul 5 13:10:47 2015 UTC,"Don't keep your eyes open. It makes it more difficult to slip into a breakthrough on an average dose (if that's what you want...). I'm always anxious before my first trip, but once it's underway, the anxiety is gone and I can go into each successive trip without it for the night. It's different for me, though... I use a gvg and only need one hit to blast off."
DMT,3c5wld,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:05:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I usually close my eyes. Im the type of person who trips in silent darkness with my eyes closed, I feel that that gets the most out of the experience, especially for mushrooms! 5 grams like that and you are set.   gvg vapor genie?   Do you usually do a few in  a row?"
DMT,3c5wld,smokinjoe65,2,Sun Jul 5 05:10:37 2015 UTC,"Just finished my third trip of the night, if that's what you mean. If you're referring to hits, it's a 1 hit game 99% of the time.  I'd love to try mushrooms but they're proving difficult to find around here..."
DMT,3c5wld,meet_THEM_do_DMT,2,Sun Jul 5 05:18:31 2015 UTC,"third trip, wow :)  Have you experienced visual language?"
DMT,3c5wld,dmtpsychonaut,2,Sun Jul 5 05:41:35 2015 UTC,"I think so. When I first started concentrating on asking questions while in hyperspace, I found myself in front of a Mayan statue type face that was entertaining me. I wanted to ask about the nature of time but all I could muster was, ""...time?"" As soon as I asked that one word question, ribbons decorated in alien alphabet characters and designs SHOT out of the face's mouth and forced me deeper into the trip. If there is knowledge to be had, either I'm not smart enough to understand it or I'm just not ready to receive it.  I've had many instances where entities would open their mouths and their heads would split open as matter spewed out, decorated in all sorts of designs and colored lights, then this matter turned into a new landscape for me to explore. Very interesting stuff."
DMT,3c5vlb,AsUcanseebythisgraph,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:54:35 2015 UTC,Go small first. Get re acquainted with it. Try 1 hit and put it down for an hour. Once your back to base you'll be way more comfortable. There are scary entities because you are scared. You can't let yourself be down or negative at all or it'll reflect that in your hallucinations. Know you'll be fine. Believe it. You create your experience.
DMT,3c5vlb,Demty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:01:55 2015 UTC,i was with some friends and did a silent trip in another room. It was really amazing- my friend went first and attempted to break through for the 1st time. He had a drawn out trip that he enjoyed berry much. His description of how beautiful it was reminded me why i loved dmt. I blasted off before coming down after 3-4 minutes. I'm almost positive i missed the third hit but i was alone and can't remember. Overall i'm happy with my choice
DMT,3c51eo,Slingblade_Samurai,2,Sat Jul 4 21:19:59 2015 UTC,"*changa  Yep, I find changa much easier to consume and enjoy than freebase.  The thing with base is that it's hit and miss if you're inexperienced, as I am, and I feel like a junky doing it.   With changa you can gravity bong a heroic dose and break through first time, or just put a couple of flakes in a pipe and have a nice level 2 buzz going.   I haven't yet made my own, always bought it from vendors.   My first vendor supplied a nice leaf. It was pleasant and my breakthrough was incredible.   Second vendor supplied me with cheaper changa - Â£20 a gram - and it caused a couple of my friends to gag and foam. Also, the breakthrough was more confusing, messy, less refined. Still good, but there was an edge of confusion to it, which I didn't have on the other gear.   I definitely prefer changa over freebase but I believe quality control is very important."
DMT,3c51eo,globaldu,2,Sun Jul 5 01:32:40 2015 UTC,"I can definitely feel you on the whole junky part man lmao I definitely would rather smoke the leaf as far as overall vibe goes but the free base was fucking INSANE lol I have a hard time breaking anyone else through though its really frustrating, I bought my GVG pipe this weekend and between 4 doses and 3 friends, none of us broke through, super frustrating!  The leaf is pretty awesome and I would most likely do it again but I just really want to get my technique down to break through using free base DMT"
DMT,3c57k6,CensureBars,5,Sat Jul 4 22:19:54 2015 UTC,"A recrystallization is always preferable, in my experience. Lye shouldn't be pulled into your nps but if there is any in your product, it's in trace amounts that won't affect you. Worrying about such small amounts of a chemical is irrational since we run into trace amounts of all kinds of compounds that are harmful in large quantities."
DMT,3c57k6,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:40:13 2015 UTC,"It might be trace amounts, but if you're worried about it you should just do a wash. It's so simple. The amount of effort it takes is so little and you gain so much peace of mind, which is a helpful thing to have when blasting off."
DMT,3c57k6,DelphiEx,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:28:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks to both of you for your responses. My buddy may end up doing the second wash. So just do another nap mix? If nothing separates, is it safe to just freeze it again? Or maybe just pipette out everything but the bottom-most amount of liquid?"
DMT,3c57k6,Demty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:21:54 2015 UTC,If you have impurities they will sink to the bottom if you mix warm nap into your product. Then pour off the clear and leave the goo (if any) as long as your nap is clear and there's no chunks your good. Even if the lye ended up in your product it only burns at 4k degrees or something. Next time when your doing the pull use 2 jars. One to baste into and one to have 100% clean nap. That way you won't be in this predicament. The more you reX the less you'll have.
DMT,3c3dfc,Dmtvape,2,Sat Jul 4 10:59:04 2015 UTC,Awesome technique! I'll have to try this out sometime. I just had one quick question though. ROA? What's this?

DMT,3c3dfc,budstryker,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:26:56 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic news; thanks for this! Curious:  i am assuming it did not dissolve in the juice, but it really doesn't matter as long as you mix it (gently turn upside down a few times?) every so often? I love vaping; would be fun to experiment with different tanks, coils and wattage..... Imagine a .2ohm build at 80w in a dripper! Cheers, everyone - my first post! Happy 4th!!!"
DMT,3c3dfc,samyama,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:47:47 2015 UTC,"I was thinking dripper def, then I started thinking. If this was your way, a tank would actually leave less waste. But all of the gram into only 1ml?"
DMT,3c3dfc,UndeadAura,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:33:23 2015 UTC,All of the gram In 1ml is the only way to get a solution strong enough to get you flying
DMT,3c3dfc,UndeadAura,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:39:12 2015 UTC,I'm thinking I want to do 1gm/10ml. I like the micro dose for the brighter world. Those days feel great!
DMT,3c3dfc,redd0nkulous,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:11:05 2015 UTC,It mixed almost immediately I shook it and then put the bottle in a warm water and it completely dissolved. As did I after smoking it
DMT,3c3dfc,TinkieWinkieBag,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:36:58 2015 UTC,1 GRAM in 1ml? how is that even possible?

DMT,3c3dfc,el_DOOM,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:35:13 2015 UTC,Would I just mix the dmt into the liquid in the tank? I have the same mod. And did you make any special preparations to the spice?
DMT,3c3dfc,Barr_Z,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:23:45 2015 UTC,"i'd probably measure the juice (1ml?) into another vessel or small glass, mix it, and then put into the tank via a dropper or syringe...this is really encouraging; lots of room to experiment as well, with resistance, wattage/voltage, and various tanks.  i'm thinking the new Kanger mini or nano.  pulls much better than the Aspire Naut mini....."
DMT,3c30fd,helloworldalex,5,Sat Jul 4 07:26:23 2015 UTC,So far I haven't cleaned my dot pipes out. I keep two. One for myself and one for friends to use. I've had no issues blasting off without cleaning the pipes
DMT,3c30fd,Thirdeyebjj,2,Sat Jul 4 12:21:16 2015 UTC,Nice. Thanks for the reply.
DMT,3c30fd,smokinjoe65,4,Mon Jul 6 04:03:43 2015 UTC,I feel like the extra stuff in my pipe gives my doses an extra kick... could be my imagination but it doesn't hurt anything anyway... just makes my gvg ugly...
DMT,3bzy62,samanthasecretagent,5,Fri Jul 3 14:52:52 2015 UTC,You get white after recrystallization and yeah white crystals are purer.
DMT,3bzy62,TremomucosaExpulsum,4,Fri Jul 3 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"White may be purer but the tan or yellow is where it's at. White slaps you in the face. Yellow you need to hold your hits in longer. White lasts 5-7 minutes of intense visuals the yellow adds a few minutes to that and the visuals are less crazy. MHRB lazymans for white, ACRB Joshison's for yellow. I prefer the yellow/tan. Hold your hits in for 30 seconds it takes awhile for your lungs to accept them goodies. Nom nom nom."
DMT,3bzy62,Demty,2,Fri Jul 3 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"There most likely won't be a noticeable difference between white or yellow product. When people say they've had different experiences between varying grades of product, they're probably not too experienced with DMT or they've forgotten how different trips from the same batch can be just as unique and different in their personality. Perhaps grades such as jungle spice or other deeply colored batches hold unique characteristics, though."
DMT,3bzy62,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:45:18 2015 UTC,"I feel though like my NMT infested sands alive textured stuff pulled from acrb is better than my white stuff though.  It's much more colorful, seems a lot stronger, more entities... Lasts a full 15 minutes usually longer...  Plus it just feels more...... Human? It's hard to describe..."
DMT,3bzy62,el_DOOM,2,Sun Jul 5 08:27:43 2015 UTC,"Always always re-x! Dissolve the extracted DMT product (whatever form it is in) in 10-20mL hot solvent (Naptha, n-Hexane, IPA), decant the liquid off leaving behind any insoluble matter. Let the solution evaporate slowly (days) and you will be left with pretty crystals. The slower the better when it comes to crystal growing. Now the more times this process is performed the higher the purity of your DMT. However with each re-crystallization you will suffer some yield loss. This will be minor or major depending on how pure or impure the inital DMT was.  This is only if you demand/need/want purity.  For a casual DMT smoker, there is absolutely nothing wrong or inferior with DMT that is yellow crystal, white crystal, orange goo, white goo. Maybe not green goo, though..."
DMT,3bzy62,apathetic_iceberg,3,Sat Jul 4 06:11:24 2015 UTC,I think it has something to do with other alkaloids being present. I think white is the purest but I'm not sure. I'd be interested to hear what others have to say about this.
DMT,3bzy62,skippythegoat,4,Fri Jul 3 15:11:20 2015 UTC,"Pure dmt is transparent, like a piece of quartz. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to make it so pure."

DMT,3bzy62,Luxjur,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"Think of it like weed. Thc is the main known ingredient that gets you high. Dmt is the same way with mhrb. Dmt is main ingredient known to get you high, but there are a handful of helping alkaloids. I always find yellow-orange to be stronger than white, and you'll find reports about red being beyond strong. That red stuff is known as jungle spice, and you can read reports on it shattering people across the universe on various websites. Any other questions feel free to PM me my friend, I'm full of answers."
DMT,3bzy62,Nickyro,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:25:52 2015 UTC,"White is usually pure, unless it tastes like burnt plastic, which means some lye or alcohol or something got in, which is also white. Yello either means heavy impurities, or that the pure crystal simply wasnt stored properly, causing it to oxidize. Exposure to air and that sort of yellowing  process is harmless and as far as I know does not affect potency. So it depends!"

DMT,3bzy62,PhiMinD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yellow has more alkaloids in it. It hasn't been run through a defat process enough times to make it that nice pure white color that straight pure dmt is. It also depends on what tech was used, solvents, bases, plant material etc. It is very hard to get pure white dmt, but ive actually had better, more full trips from the more yellowish powder or crystal."
DMT,3bzy62,LsDmT,0,Fri Jul 3 15:23:21 2015 UTC,It should be as clear or white as possible   https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_crystal1.jpg  Yellow means there is prob lye in it.
DMT,3bzy62,PhiMinD,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:04:29 2015 UTC,Lye isn't yellow thought.  The yellow hue just mean other plant oils are in it.
DMT,3bzy62,Interversity,-4,Fri Jul 3 18:16:29 2015 UTC,Yes but the lye is suspended in the gross matter along with the plant oils.
DMT,3bzy62,PhiMinD,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:21:56 2015 UTC,"Do you have any actual reason to believe this, or are you just assuming?"
DMT,3bzy62,Interversity,-2,Fri Jul 3 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is the process of the most common method of dmt extraction. The dmt is pulled from the lye and plant matter solution using a solvent. If the separation is not proper you will have tinged dmt. If you purify dmt is becomes a clear crystal, go look on erowid.  If your dmt is yellow or red it is not pure."
DMT,3bzy62,GratefullyMe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:51:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks homie, I've extracted grams before, I'm familiar with the process. However you still don't have any evidence to support the claim that the nps collects any lye and that the lye is then transferred into the DMT."
DMT,3bzy62,ChuntasticMcChun,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:22:27 2015 UTC,"Lye doesn't dissolve in solvent, and water does not mix with solvent. So there's no way for solvent to end up in final product short of having water end up mixed with your solvent. And even if it does, lye takes something like 200*+C to melt, let alone burn, so there's basically no way to ingest it short of eating your dmt."
DMT,3bzy62,Demty,0,Sat Jul 4 09:23:54 2015 UTC,"I should add, any ""pure"" chemical is going to be clear or white. This is why I always get a kick out of people bragging how brown their molly is.  However, and I'm not completely sure on this so I'd appreciate if someone more knowlegable could confirm or disprove this, but the presence of any leftover substance that was used to make it shouldn't necessarily mean that it's any less effective than a batch that's white. It's certainly an indicator that it might be less effective, as it certainly indicates the chemical was produced by either someone with a lack of proper equipment or an inexperienced chemist (or both), but it certainly doesn't mean you should avoid purchasing DMT just because it's yellow."
DMT,3bzy62,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:40:54 2015 UTC,Difference is where it's extraction from and the method used. MH = W and AC = yellow :) mystery solved. Both are super amazing white is stronger and yellow is longer. Hail the d!
DMT,3bzy62,GratefullyMe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:30:55 2015 UTC,My AC product is always white.
DMT,3bzy62,Demty,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:48:49 2015 UTC,"Acacia should be white seeing as it should be done with an acid base cook due to higher plant fats, compared to mhrb which can be done stb since it has lower fats and also contains more alkaloids that are helpful with the trip. As far as I know ac lacks these alkaloids, at least at any noticeable amount."
DMT,3bzy62,GratefullyMe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:28:53 2015 UTC,I hear what your saying but I completed an acid boil and got great results using AC. I never recrystalized because the tan I got from the acid boil was great. Although the stb MH definitely gave a white crystalline product without reX. Newbies should do STB with MH.

DMT,3bzy62,Demty,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:58:19 2015 UTC,Just because it uses lye to extract the DMT doesn't mean it's in the plant oils. The lye stays in the aqueous layer below the non-polar solvent. The lye does not get dissolved in the non-polar solvent like the DMT because...well...lye isn't polar.
DMT,3bzy62,RedSteppa,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:47:09 2015 UTC,Lye burns only at insane high temperatures. Don't worry about the lye. Even if you sprinkle lye in a bowl (don't do it) over your weed it won't burn. You probably need a welder to burn lye.

I've also gotten the sensation of walking but I feel that any sense of freedom of motion is a false assumption.  Your orientation here won't reflect on the other side, in my experience.  My come down can be described as floating back into reality and realizing I need to say goodbye. Always peaceful.  Can't comment because my only open eye experience is on the comedown, not in full swing. Music tends to have varying effects for me. I never listen to lyrics, just melodies or nature sounds. I've also listened to Beethoven which was awesome. If the sunlight hits my eyes, the visuals and colors are amazing and bright oranges and yellows.

DMT,3bxby8,lrn2science,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:37:52 2015 UTC,"[Prefacing this with the fact that everything here is purely personal and everyone's preferences and experiences will obviously vary WILDLY.]   Anywhere from 2 to 5 dimensions depending on the experience, as well as plenty of things that were utterly ineffable.  I've felt the ""shot out of a cannon"" feeling before, but the most common feeling for me could be likened to a slow drift, as if floating underwater in an unhurried but strong current whilst stone sober, accompanied by frenetic, clearly psychedelic emotional, visual, and social/interpersonal (not quite the right word; basically the entities I was perceiving were very frantic (but happy!) to interact with me) hallucinations that swirl around my immediate awareness as I'm drifting.  Depends on the dose, I've experienced both POV's matching my actual POV and ones that were radically different (being a random woman in South America going about her day, multi-faceted alien eyes, no recognizable visual input, etc) Usually the comedown from the actual hardcore confusing/engrossing hallucinations is rather quick (~1 minute? Usually   ~45), but is not abrupt. All of my comedowns from ""break through"" experiences have segued smoothly back into reality, usually with the sensation of floating up through a warm fluid and then breaching the surface and being ""reborn"", or something along those lines (I feel like I've sweat everywhere/pissed myself EVERY time). Once you're back in the room you were in initially it's (I believe I'm quoting McKenna here) like a two or three tab acid trip, but you feel very sober and, for me, without exception, fantastic. Physically and emotionally euphoric, grateful to be existing as what I am when I am, you name it -- it's great and always makes up for any unpleasantness that may have happened during the trip (usually just by making their didactic elements easier to see now that I'm not being filled with fractal garbage by an alien tornado and trying not to vomit, or something).  My OE experiences have all included a vastly increased appreciation and perception of certain colors, tracers, and ""frame by frame""/laggy vision (think this). Fractal patterns appear and crawl/swim/breathe everywhere, and, again, depending on dose, it basically just becomes the same past a certain point. Closing my eyes will usually provide a more cohesive narrative and immersive experience on low-med. high doses since (I believe) I can more easily stitch the insane thought processes and feelings together with the CEV's than with a wiggly fractal OE reality.  Again (again), at higher doses it just doesn't matter because you're so gone. But below ""jesus what"" doses, I find low light (just enough to let some red/orange come through my eyelids) to be superior to pitch dark for me, but I have friends who prefer the opposite. Pre-selected music is sometimes nice, but more often than not I get pretty dissociated and pick apart the idea of music produced in a studio and sold, as well as the idea of me needing something like that in order to feel comfortable, etc, and it just ends up feeling bad. Personally, the auditory hallucinations (an infinite chorus of oscillations and tones) I get on DMT are the most fascinating music I've ever heard and listening to/focusing on them always makes me feel better than any music I could have been listening to.    No question is silly!  EDIT: punctuation marks."

DMT,3bvza4,BigNiggasDontPlay,2,Fri Jul 3 01:14:17 2015 UTC,"In my book, the ""strongest psychedelic currently known"" is taken by the infamous Salvia Divinorum.  Any thoughts?"
DMT,3bvza4,iObsidian,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"infamous only in the west. Due to our method. When the traditional shamans learned that Salvia divinorum was smoked they were appalled! They said that this would make the spirit of Salvia very unhappy!  Some people actually speculate that the TRUE active ingredient in Salvia divinorum breaks down into Salvinorin A & B when the plant is dried, therefore most people who have used Salvia divinorum in the Western World have not had a ""true"" Salvia divinorum experience.  The shamans chew it, and it gives you a longer experience, with a less of a 'fuck you rape train running over your brain' feeling, because the come up is gradual, but gets you to the same place, in which you stay for about an hour, giving you enough time to explore the space:) It's much more mellow.  Im in love with this plant, and will probably never smoke it."
DMT,3bvza4,Luxjur,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:49:06 2015 UTC,"I'm very happy you took time to answer my comment.  I really want to explore what this plant has to show me.  Should I grow my own plants? Order online?  Guide me please, you seem very experienced."
DMT,3bvza4,iObsidian,2,Sun Jul 5 03:53:05 2015 UTC,"Of course! I'm happy to expose people to the full potential of the experience which so many are sadly unaware of!  I would grow my own if i could, seems like it would be a nice way to form a richer relationship with the plant right? I order online though, 28 grams for 15$!   So the chewing method goes like this, assuming you buy dry leaves like I did, soak the desired amount (2-8 grams) in water for a few minutes. Spoon them up or roll them into a tube or ball, and put it under your tongue or between your teeth and lips. Chew here and there, agitating the trichomes to create salvia infused saliva (lol). Try not to swallow the liquid forming in your mouth, as the compound is absorbed sublingually (blood vessels under your tongue), your gums, and the mucus membrane at the back of the throat. The compound, once swallowed is mostly destroyed in the stomach, I heard something like 80% of it is wasted. So it's important to keep it all in your mouth.  I hold the leaves in my mouth for 30 minutes. You can spit them out earlier if it starts getting too intense, but if you start with lower doses it won't be anything scary.  After 30 minutes you can spit them out on a plate or whatever, but try and keep the spit in your mouth for full effects, swallowing small amount periodically, allowing it to absorb in your throat's mucus membrane, which is a also a very receptive site! Anyway, each wave of absorption takes about 15 minutes to start coming on, so half way through the 30 minutes you will most likely begin feeling the effects mildly beginning.   It will gradually increase in intensity, with the peak of the experience ending around the one hour mark after you finish chewing the leaves. It also makes your dreams much more vivid for the following nights!  TL;DR   Wash your mouth out with vinegar/alcohol to open up your blood vessels in your mouth Stick the presoaked leaves in your mouth and chew them up very good, keeping all the saliva in your mouth, exposing your blood vessels under your tongue and gums.  Put the leaves in the front of your mouth or under your tongue and kind of use your mouth to rub the leaves against your front gums to really get the salvinorin into your blood stream, and allowing it to get under your tongue too. Keep them in your mouth for no less than 30 minutes DO NOT TAKE THEM OUT (unless you feel it is too strong)   The best way to experience it in my opinion is in silent darkness, laying down or sitting up with your eyes closed. And at small doses, this is often the only way to coax the effects into being. But even at higher doses, the most intense effects happen with your eyes closed, letting Salvia take you wherever she thinks is necessary.  Heres a nifty little SALVIA experiential guide I found:  Level - 1 ""S"" stands for SUBTLE effects. A feeling that ""something"" is happening, although it is difficulty to say just what. Relaxation and increased sensual appreciation may be noted. This mild level is useful for meditation and may facilitate sexual pleasure.  Level - 2 ""A"" stands for ALTERED perception. Colors and textures are more pronounced. Appreciation of music may be enhanced. Space may appear of greater or lesser depth than is usual. But visions do not occur at this level. Thinking becomes less logical, and more playful; short-term memory difficulties may be noted.  Level - 3 ""L"" stands for LIGHT visionary state. Closed-eye visuals (clear imagery with eyes closed: fractal patterns, vine-like and geometric patterns, visions of objects and designs). The imagery is often two dimensional. If open-eyed visual effects occur, these are usually vague and fleeting. At this level, phenomena similar to the hypnagogic phenomena that some people experience at sleep onset occur. At this level, visions are experienced as ""eye candy"" but are not confused with reality.  Level - 4 ""V"" stands for VIVID visionary state. Complex three-dimensional realistic appearing scenes occur. Sometimes voices may be heard. With eyes open, contact with consensual reality will not be entirely lost, but when you close your eyes you may forget about consensus reality and enter completely into a dreamlike scene. Shamanistic journeying to other lands--foreign or imaginary; encounters with beings (entities, spirits) or travels to other ages may occur. You may even live the life of another person. At this level you have entered the shaman's world. Or if you prefer: you are in ""dream time."" With eyes closed, you experience fantasies (dream like happenings with a story line to them). So long as your eyes are closed you may believe they are really occurring. This differs from the ""eye candy"" closed-eye imagery, of level 3.  Level - 5 ""I"" stands for IMMATERIAL existence. At this level one may no longer be aware of having a body. Consciousness remains and some thought processes are still lucid, but one becomes completely involved in inner experience and looses all contact with consensual reality. Individuality may be lost; one experiences merging with God/dess, mind, universal consciousness, or bizarre fusions with other objects--real or imagined (e.g. experiences such as merging with a wall or piece of furniture). At this level it is impossible to function in consensual reality, but unfortunately some people do not remain still but move around in this befuddled state. For this reason a sitter is essential to ensure the safety of someone voyaging to these deep levels. To the person experiencing this the phenomenon may be terrifying or exceedingly pleasant; but to an outside observer the individual may appear confused or disoriented.  Level 6 - ""A"" stands for AMNESIC effects. At this stage, either consciousness is lost, or at least one is unable to later recall what one had experienced. The individual may fall, or remain immobile or thrash around; somnambulistic behavior may occur. Injuries can be sustained without pain being felt; on awakening, the individual will have no recollection of what he/she did, experienced, or said in level 6. People cannot recall what they experience in this very deep trance state. This is not a desirable level, because nothing can latter be recalled of the experience.  Good luck! I'd be happy to hear about your experience or answer any questions :)"

This idea that we get to glimpse a higher dimensional order of things, even if we're just absolutely confounded by the whole experience, just really gets me excited. If I'm being rational, which I certainly try to be, I can tell myself it's just the human brain under the influence of a drug that excites it in such a way as to make us think we're experiencing some sort of hyperdimensional space or whatever you want to call it. But what does that matter, really?  Is it any different from watching a moving performance, like a play, or listening to a powerful piece of music that drives you to tears? The experience is real, regardless of how it's brought about. In the same way that I couldn't, with any real accuracy, recreate or describe my experience of listening to a song; I just don't have the talent, skill, or faculties to address it properly. But it moves me all the same! I'm changed by the experience and when I try to come back to it, I end up changing what I remember because I'm not the same person that I was the first time I ""saw"" it. I think when you experience something new, something ""real"", something that affects you deeply, however it comes about, it's an experience with the novel, the impossible. And that's what's so beautiful about being alive, these fleeting moments with the divine."

My furniture folding into itself, impossibly. Each time this would happen I got my mind blown further and further towards breaking through. It was like forcing me to give up staying out of the breakthrough, and every impossibility blew me a little closer till BANG - I was there, I had to let go. It simply wouldn't fit in this reality with my human understanding of the world, I suppose. It's like oh my god this can't exist until I had to let go of existing :)"
DMT,3bv08q,G03tia,4,Thu Jul 2 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. On my recent trip, on which I did not go so far, I came to a grand space, much grander than any I had seen before, and coming toward me was a great shape, spinning simply on its axis, and just its corners were illuminated as if from nowhere.  As my mind gazed upon it it seemed that there were intricate inscriptions all about its sides, though as 'I' came 'closer' to the object, it appeared to me that they were not inscriptions, yet gears of greater dimension than my own, and this I know for I have studied geometry of upper dimensions.   What gave this away was that the gears not only had the ability to turn around and about each-other in the sense typical to us, but they also had an extra dimension of in/out.  In three dimensions, we have:   Up / Down Foreward / Back Left / Right   Yet in four, there is in and out. This seems like a simple concept, but even after having studied it for many hours on my own, I have come to realize that my mind is simply not built to comprehend such things.  When I saw the geometries locked away in my mind, I found them impossible at first, yes; then my mind asked, 'What is all of this? I don't understand, will you teach me?' And so then it did, and though I do not have deep understanding of such geometries as a result, I do feel that they are at least slightly more intuitive than before.  Now here are some resources for investigating fourth dimensional geometries as mathematical / physical concepts:  http://www.urticator.net/ - This site contains not only a fourth dimensional maze game to whet your appetite for new mathematics, but also a great number of exciting links to check out.  http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/SCIENCE/Science.html  - This is the 'technical section' of the website of my favourite science fiction author, Greg Egan. Don't be fooled by that profession; he is a scholar, and wildly learned at that. Therein are many representations of just such geometries, and you might find his fictional works interesting as well.  https://plus.maths.org/content/richard-elwes - This is one of the first articles I read of the subject (and before I'd even heard of DMT) which piqued my interest.  http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/polytope/ - Here is an interesting article by the University of Illinois on the projection of a fourth dimensional object to three.

It's one of those things that makes the visuals so hard to remember and put into words, and even that explanation doesn't do it justice."
DMT,3bv08q,Level_9_Ganondorf,9,Thu Jul 2 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"Right! It's like having 360 vision, extremely disorientating and bizarre."
DMT,3bv08q,marillmau5,3,Thu Jul 2 14:09:41 2015 UTC,"I've never done DMT but I'm curious about it. What Slurrey and yourself are describing is how I think 'true' 3D is - being able to see all faces of a cube simultaneously - which would only make sense in 4D space, like how a plane can only be fully viewed in 3D space. 3D we can only infer using our binocular 2D vision and use of time to rotate and transform if you get my meaning. I can't see how it's possible to visualise higher dimensions because of how our eyes work, but I'm curious as hell  Would love to have some sort of quale for 'true' 3D and 4D space, if that's what DMT is actually giving, but I'm stuck there as I can't get any."

They looked like the concrescence of linguistic intentionality put through a kind of hyper-dimensional transform into three-dimensional space.  And these little machines offered themselves to me. And I realized when I looked at them that if I could bring just one of these little trinkets back, nothing would ever be quite the same again. And I wondered, Where Am I? And What Is Going On? It occurred to me that these must be holographic viral projections from an autonomous continuum that was somehow intersecting my own, and then I thought a more elegant explaination would be to take it at face value and realize that I had broken into an ecology of souls.  And that somehow I was getting a peek over the other side. Somehow I was finding out that thing that you cheerfully assume you can't find out. But it felt like I was finding out. And it felt.. and then I can't remember what it felt like because the little self-transforming tykes interrupted me and said, ""Don't think about it. Don't think about who we are...  Think about doing what we're doing. Do it! Do it! DO IT NOW!!!""  Terence McKenna on DMT"

DMT,3bv74k,spiritmeetthesoul,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:31:55 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the concepts may be out of your immediate grasp, if you want to take the time to learn I recommend the chemistry section of khan academy. After you feel like you have a good grasp get back.  However if you're looking for the simplified version think of it like this; dissolving root bark or whatever takes the goodies and combines it with your liquid, after straining it out you now have goodies minus the physical plant element. However the goodies are mixed with things that you wouldn't exactly want to smoke, so you dissolve that in chemicals that are a little bit more selective and strain out the excess. You keep getting more and more selective until you have a relatively pure product. Then you evaporate the liquid leaving the dmt :), that you can think of like evaporating salt water simply leaves you with salt; evaporating dmt solution leaves you with dmt :)  Im not exactly a chemist myself but I've taken several courses at uni so if something is just horribly unforgivably wrong I'm sorry.. But this is my understanding :p  Hope this helps!"

DMT,3btqms,iliketotryptamine,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:42:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can ""die"" while on DMT. You might 100% believe you are dead, or dying, but that's really part of the trip because of how powerful it is as a psychedelic. I think if you went into the light you might have seen and felt some things, that may have been too much for you to handle, but ultimately I think you would have returned like clockwork to this world.  I had a similar experience when I did ayahuasca. I thought I died, 100%. I couldn't really remember who I was or what I was, but I was sure that I was never going to leave the place I was in. I was in a lucid dream type world, but eventually left that place to a pure energy/light type place. I then eventually ""remembered"" who I was and what I was doing and returned.  Basically I think that the only way you could ""die"" in that moment is if you were to literally die from a bad reaction to DMT (i'm not even sure if you can die from this) or your heart just happens to give out in the moment, you get hit by a truck/asteroid etc. Which if that happens while you are smoking DMT, that's such a goofy way to die it was probably fate at that point."

DMT,3bq6c8,RedSteppa,2,Sat Jul 4 23:02:12 2015 UTC,"So my question is, if I were to experience death in a dream; whether lucid or not, considering the above information, would my brain release DMT?   Where should it come from?  This whole DMT/Death relation thing has still to be proven.    Since it is a dream, wouldn't the trip just be what you think it is? Or is it possible to actually experience a DMT trip and breakthrough as if it were in waking life?   I'd state the obious....a dream is a dream. A DMT Trip is a DMT trip. No DMT Trip without DMT. Simple as that...in my opinion, of course."
DMT,3bq6c8,smokinjoe65,3,Wed Jul 1 14:28:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with these. When I've dreamed of DMT breakthroughs it was similar but not the same. My mind couldn't reproduce the bizarre nature and detail/intricacies of a real trip, but instead patched a few things together to seem like your typical DMT breakthrough with blurry, plain patterns.   A dream, lucid or not, may seem real but you can see what makes it the illusion that it is. A DMT flash seems more real than waking reality. So, in order of realness, high to low (in my opinion) DMT flash-->reality-->dream state."

Other people will be mildly curious; ""Oh, that's a big fish!"".   Some people, especially kids and people who don't visit the beach as much as others do will say, ""WOW! LOOK AT THAT FISH!""

When the visions got out of hand it was like the insect dude would pull everyone in line. The ""entities"" are still there I guess I just look at them differently as being inside me instead of outside. My beliefs are this- no gods. It's math. It's probability. We evolved from animals and are just that. Very intelligent animals. Because we no longer have to hunt and gather we now have to find other things to keep busy.

DMT,3bmvj5,Psynaut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:19:22 2015 UTC,"We are on the same brain wave lengths man! lol    I have actually given it alot of mature thought to it, part of me feels that the DMT served its purpose for me on the first go round and I am ever so grateful for that experience and could never be replicated. I do understand that was a true gift and do not want to ""spoil"" it per say with expectaions. With that being said YES I will breakthrough again because I ALSO feel that it may have even more to offer, I understand completely that I may never have an experience like that again and I am content with that, I will never expect to have that same trip and I think that is most important. As of right now I honestly don't know what to think, I do know what I was shown and I do know that my conscious had a presence in these places and they were every bit real to me. Yet I also had the thought of ""reincarnation"" in the back of my mind for the past few days too. What provoked that thought is that immediately after ""dying"" I immediately felt my new self connected through the sprouts that were forming from my tears, I am not sure what to expect or to believe in past what I experiences but the whole heaven and god thing is a go in my books :) I am embarrassed to admit I have no idea what that word in this context means (please elaborate I would love to answer) It surpassed what I was anticipating in all honesty, I could only hope or an experience like this once and a lifetime and it is every bit of what I could hope for out of this drug. As far as the realm he describes I couldn't really say in confidence that I was there EXACTLY where he was talking about but I can definitely assure you I was not on ""earth"" I couldnt exactly put a finger on where I was when the trip first began but not of this world! I couldn't navigate freely until I was in ""heaven."" The entities decided when I moved and stopped, very crazy feeling indeed!   NO thank you for reading! I am extremely glad you enjoyed it!"
DMT,3bmvj5,Psynaut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm very interesting. Synchronicity = what you felt with the thunderstorm kund of. It means something very personally significant happens at a precise time that doesnt seem to have a direct cause for happening at that moment, that usually gives you a feeling of some higher power because it couldnt just be coincidence. Also - You have not done mushrooms? I would be curious to see how you relate a very high dose mushroom trip to that of DMT. I personally noticed some similarities between these 'Feelings'  Your dealer and friends sound like some of the awesomest people ever also btw!"
DMT,3bmvj5,tyyx0942,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:25:15 2015 UTC,"During the trip or in real life?  In real life I was almost killed by a stray bullet, I was 3 steps away from my head being in the bullets trajectory path and other than that I was extremely ill the week after my grandmother died and when I was in the bathtub I saw her... I spoke to her, that is what I feel was my first sense of assurance that there is a higher power.  In the trip I can't even begin to try and link the two together, from what you are describing I don't think I could recollect feeling as if an EXACT moment was like that other than the moments I realized that I was being laid down to die and when I realized I was going to ""heaven"" so insane! hopefully that answered the question?"
DMT,3bmvj5,earthmoonsun,2,Tue Jun 30 23:51:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed report. What's your conclusion? Did you learn anything, did it change you as a person? Will it even change your life? Or is it ""only"" an very nice experience?"
DMT,3bmvj5,Pinealforest,2,Wed Jul 1 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"I know what I am about to say sounds exaggerated but I assure you this is what I got from this trip... I always believed in a ""higher power"" to a certain extent, never really knowing 100% if god and heaven were real, I could only hope for them to be real.  I also have been through a lot of grief and tragedy in my short 23 years on this earth, DMT SHOWED me... literally showed me that God is in fact real, and that heaven is really a place that I get to go when I die... and along with me ""dying"" in that trip makes me feel like all of the pain and suffering I endured my life so far died along with me... I feel so rejuvinated and amazingly positive about life itself and what comes after, I do not claim any religion and never have, never will. But that day just showed me... you know? Showed me everything I needed to see to live out this life on earth with the knowledge of what I will be experiencing after. Of course this is a personal trip and my feelings and thoughts will be of my own but I can promise you that it was confirmed to the core of who I am that all of that was an ""experience"" rather than hallucination."
DMT,3bmvj5,unclothing,4,Tue Jun 30 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"DMT SHOWED me... literally showed me that God is in fact real, and that heaven is really a place that I get to go when I die...   You mention in several of your replies that the DMT trip proved to you the existence of God, and yet in your trip report you do not mention any interaction with God, whatsoever.  Could you please share why the trip left you with a deepened belief in a God?  I understand you met beings, felt great love, and went to a loving place where other beings who have passed on were existing, but what about the trip causes you to believe in a Supreme Being, rather than just say, the persistent existence of consciousness, or that love and consciousness are ultimate and transcend life, or some other similar type of universal law other than a Supreme Being pulling all the strings?"
DMT,3bmvj5,GammaCake,2,Tue Jun 30 21:54:12 2015 UTC,"The female entity was god, she showed me EVERYTHING and poured her love into me literally almost too much love to comprehhend. In my previous loose belief in god I did feel as though god is not judgemental in anyway and is the definition of all that is good and all that is love. From the moment I heard her voice for the first time I had a sensation that this is in fact the god i've always believed in... She loved me, laid me down to die, loved my new ""self"" just as equally, she took me to heaven and told me ""you can't stay yet, not yet."" In my own experience no one could ever tell me that was not god or at least the god i've always thought to be out there somewhere. Words cannot describe it honestly.   What solidified my belief even further is that the female entity was calling all the shots, the male entity only became frustrated with me and showed me nothing, while the other entity showed me what I could only hope for, for anyone who has experienced the confirmation of ""god"" in a trip will most likely tell you the same thing (there is no mistaking that was god)  I do understand and fully respect your idea of what that could have been but personally i know... I just know, you know?? haha :)"
DMT,3bmvj5,themafuckinscorpion,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:41:23 2015 UTC,"I respect and appreciate your thoughtful response, but it doesn't answer the question I am considering here.  I understand you to be saying that you think, then, that she was a conscious entity that created the entire universe, and oversees every individual consciousness?  The Ultimate, final authority on all consciousness in the universe?    I have had a similar experience, and after much thought, I concluded that for me, personally, I have know way of knowing it wasn't just a highly evolved being.  For example, if I walk up to a baby bird, pick it up, and hold it, I must seem like an all powerful being... a God.  If a spiritual being, was evolved and powerful enough, to so far overshadow my consciousness, as to seem all powerful, it would seem like a God to me, yet, how would I, as a spiritual baby bird, be able to discern the difference between a highly evolved being, and a Ultimate Creator of all things.  I don't think I could, so I am interested in how you are able to make that distinction?"
DMT,3bmvj5,MarcusDrakus,2,Wed Jul 1 16:17:51 2015 UTC,"I do believe so, this is the part where I cannot find words to explain the certainty of it all.  When I first arrived in the entities ""home"" if you would, it was almos as if the male entity was in training or something, as if he did not know how to show me what he was trying to show me, me and him did not connect at all spiritually and never felt a ""connection"" with him. Then its like the female entity was saying ""okay okay nice try nice try but let me take this one."" from that moment on it was pure love, pure ecstacy, I could almost visualize the love that was being poured into me and the God I had always thought existed is love and acceptance, this female showed me everything and let me feel everything, personally in my mind I just knew it was god, I never asked, never even wondered if it really was, it was just factual at that point in the trip, just amazing man.  That is a very good example, that is a very physical example as well, I am not sure you could ever express the love for a bird the way I felt her express her love to me, nothing visual confirmed it was god, I never saw any kind of form to her just... love."
DMT,3bmvj5,American83,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:50:01 2015 UTC,I appreciate the thoughtful replies.  Thanks.
DMT,3bmvj5,hokksund,2,Wed Jul 1 17:23:44 2015 UTC,Absolutely and thank you for asking!
DMT,3bmvj5,MarcusDrakus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering, did you specifically experience this God as being female or was it more like an entity without a definable gender who merely exposed woman-like traits like love and kindness? Do you think he/she/it might also have other sides than how you experienced her this time? Or was it clear that you saw her in the way she actually was, her complete/pure existence or 'full form' so to say?"
DMT,3bmvj5,InfinitePeas,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:41:17 2015 UTC,"There was definitely no mistaking that it was a female, her voice, the feeling I got when she spoke to me was almost motherly, so trusting and loving, overwhelmingly loving actually lol and this ""entity"" has no physical form, I could not see her or touch her, but she sure could see me and touch me, it was so intense!"

DMT,3bqj3o,RedSteppa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"I am very excited for you to have this experience my good man! Tips would definitely be  1.) Prior to taking off make sure you are in a good place in your mind, meditate maybe 20 min before to clear your mind of all negativity. 2.) Have a sitter there with you if possible just for some reassurance  3.) SMOKE THE WHOLE DOSE if you can :D  4.) Try your hardest to let go of control once you start tripping, it will be extremely odd at first and you will want to be in control but it's best to just let the trip take you where you're meant to go.  Safe travels brother! Please let us all know how it goes!"
DMT,3bqj3o,Slingblade_Samurai,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:28:43 2015 UTC,Didnt break through. Pretty sad but it was nice experience. Cant really describe it. I couldnt hold my hits in long enough and i couldnt see well enough to take multiple hits.   Think i burned it.  Might try a meth pipe instead of the machine next time. THink i yelled at one point in the trip as i fell through this ting
DMT,3bpeg0,throwaybecauseilurk,2,Wed Jul 1 02:13:22 2015 UTC,Guy sounds like an asshole. Done is done. Now just enjoy it. If it's ordinary N-N-DMT you can go solo. Setting of mind is everything with DMT.
DMT,3bpeg0,VerumInInanis,3,Wed Jul 1 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I decided a bit ago it is time. I am going to prepare myself and mind, go to a nice field and enjoy the ride. I don't know if you care for an update, but I will."
DMT,3bpeg0,el_DOOM,2,Wed Jul 1 06:06:28 2015 UTC,"If anything your dmt now has good karma.   You took it from a person who had evil intentions. You probably saved a lot of girls from irreversible trauma.   If you don't want to profit from this stuff you can always give it away. Or you can keep it around to set your mind straight every once in a while when you need it. It's good at that.  The blue lady may be your spirit guide. She will show up when needed to tell you what you need. Mine is a female horned stag.   Good job on stealing the drugs (very rare comment right there)! Remember, where there is drugs, there will always be scumbags."
DMT,3bpeg0,iliketotryptamine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:07:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you kind stranger. :) I can't tell you how great this has made me feel. I never thought of it that way. My mind has been pretty twisted and confused with ""right vs. wrong"" in that scenario. It definitely is too much DMT for me to handle during one life time, so I will hold on to it and give it to those special people that come my way. I plan on easing my mind very shortly and hope it is all worth it.  I am convinced she is too. Nothing is definite though. A little after everything a monk walked up to me and handed me a hindu book and spoke a lot of sense to me. I opened the book and the first thing I see is a woman with blue skin. I was inspired to go to a Hindu temple and it was very inspiring and amazing. Haven't felt peace like that in a long time. I am not a religious person, but I believe there is truth to all religion so it really hit me hard.  Thank you again for your kind words. I will update in the future. I agree, there are always scumbags, and I just happened to fall into a bad bunch."
DMT,3bpeg0,Slingblade_Samurai,2,Wed Jul 1 06:43:19 2015 UTC,You did the right thing. I would personally keep that stash for myself and take it when I feel like it. You don't have to worry about sourcing it anymore if you decide to dry it again.
DMT,3bpeg0,Molestador,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I think I will keep it throughout my life and when I am an old granny I will have some fun, haha and maybe save some for my future kids or grand kids if they're ready because it is a shit ton."

DMT,3bo7hk,Slingblade_Samurai,2,Tue Jun 30 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"A Bic lighter is fine for the gvg. You'll learn that you need to bend the flame into the pipe, but don't pull too hard. Pull hard enough to bend it until you see it start to fill with vapor (pulling too hard will waste your lung capacity) then clear it hard to pull it deep into your lungs. Doing it this way, I consistently break through on one pull of ~20mg while holding it in for less than 10 seconds."
DMT,3bo7hk,smokinjoe65,2,Wed Jul 1 16:00:51 2015 UTC,WHAT?! No way! 20mg?! That is awesomeeee :D this makes me excited man thank you so much for the tip on how to light properly!
DMT,3bo7hk,JustOutOfTheDarkness,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:05:12 2015 UTC,"yes, the GVG is incredibly efficient, I would say 25-30mg is almost always a breakthrough with it."
DMT,3bo7hk,JustOutOfTheDarkness,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:36:25 2015 UTC,That is so fucking awesome thank you for sharing!!!
DMT,3bo7hk,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:19:07 2015 UTC,I find a torch so much better for quick vaporization though and a bit easier. But I think its also the tendency to pull too hard and run out of breath with a Bic that many run into.
DMT,3bo7hk,FarFlungPhoton,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:37:33 2015 UTC,You're right. That's why I always stress pulling just hard enough to bend the flame. Inhaling comes after you've successfully vaporized the dose. I lost my torch lighter :(
DMT,3bo7hk,JustOutOfTheDarkness,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:49:10 2015 UTC,"I'd love to hear how you guys find using the glass VG to be. I greatly enjoy the bronze Sherlock VG for herb. If the glass VG works very well for DMT I might consider picking one up. I really like smoking the enhanced leaf form of DMT, AKA ""Changa"", as it is super easy to do, no different from smoking herb."

DMT,3bop5a,Xeeroy,2,Tue Jun 30 22:21:35 2015 UTC,"I've done DMT twice, though the second time was a microdose of about 5mg. The microdose did not make me break through at all, but I still saw colors, and geometric patterns for a good 3-4 minutes.   It did intensify my weed high for the rest of the night though."
DMT,3bop5a,define_irony,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:12:24 2015 UTC,So it's not like I'm completely missing out then? I mean I get that breaking through is way cooler but it is good to hear that it won't be a complete waste if I don't break through the first time.
DMT,3bop5a,define_irony,2,Tue Jun 30 23:21:08 2015 UTC,"Yea, even a crumb of dmt will still do something as long as you get some of the vapor from it. I used the sandwich method in a gravity bong. Simple and I broke through my first time with 50mg"
DMT,3bop5a,globaldu,2,Wed Jul 1 01:38:36 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, I prefer to not break through... I love the level 2 haze, the feeling of being connected without going to la-la land for 10 minutes... although, once you've done it several times, it becomes really easy to get there, if you want to.   I guess it all depends how much gear you've got... at one time I had 5g of changa that I didn't really want it in my home for months so I was giving it away... rather that doing gravity bong hits we ended up doing little pipe hits that just put us all on a nice level.   It gets a lot easier to break through after you've done it a few times.  So long as you have enough, and you should, just do a teeny tiny hit first to get a feel for it... but make sure you hold it in forever... if you exhale any smoke, you're wasting it.    I don't see the need for anyone to break through on their first hit, unless that's all they've got.   I was buying DMT for Â£20 to Â£50 a gram in the UK so I don't see why anyone would only have 100mg or less to play with on their first go.  I've bought from 3 or 4 different suppliers and each time had exactly the same effect so it was definitely DMT, but I don't know about all the 5meo N stuff, I'm not a chemist, I just know it worked, every time, from every vendor I purchased from."
DMT,3bop5a,globaldu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:54:54 2015 UTC,"I  bought 300 mg of darknets (not my first purchase, l know what I'm doing) I'm pretty sure that should be enough"
DMT,3bntid,dmtpsychonaut,4,Tue Jun 30 18:34:55 2015 UTC,"I am able to find value and truth in most religious or spiritual traditions. Though, so much of the truth is barried in miscommunication.   I do not use any label to describe my personal beliefs, but I tend to most align with the philosophy of Alan Watts.   I believe DMT is an important tool on the belt of the Psychonaut, it is a revealer of the embedded intelligence of the matrix of space-time or a portal of the akashic field."

DMT,3bkmdt,GammaCake,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:10:50 2015 UTC,I think the feeling you're describing is that of witnessing a miracle. It's a very specific feeling that rarely occurs in day to day life without use of psychedelics or other consciousness alterationsl

DMT,3bkoze,nuttyboner,2,Tue Jun 30 00:32:09 2015 UTC,"i've had good luck loading 50 mg in my oil pipe bubbler and hitting it all in one toke.  but it does take practice.  i've been thinking about getting a GVG as well, it's hard to imaging how it could really be that more efficient than the oil burner, as it doesnt seem like i'm wasting any.  but i've heard it really is..."
DMT,3bkoze,supercerealyouguys,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:30:30 2015 UTC,Are you able to easily do one hit breakthroughs now?
DMT,3bkoze,supercerealyouguys,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:10:44 2015 UTC,"fairly reliably.  if i can't get it all in one toke, the second toke is a real challenge, it's hard to see what i'm doing and i've burnt it that way because i'm already high as fuck from the first rip and i can hardly function enough to do the second properly.  i much prefer to get it all in one toke so i can safely put down the pipe and lay down before it starts hitting me too hard.  i think the bubbler style 'meth pipe' is better because it comes into you a little cooler.  i don't use water with it, but there's still a second chamber for the vapor to cool down instead of shooting right into your mouth. the one i'm using now looks like this, i got it from a local ghetto smoke shop for $4."
DMT,3bkoze,smokinjoe65,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:53:48 2015 UTC,"The gvg is pretty much a guaranteed one hit breakthrough on ~25mg when you get your technique down. I have one and no other method sounds viable when I read people's comments about loading 50mg+ into whatever device. Get it if you're serious about DMT use. It's the best investment I've made, right next to my extraction gear."

I'm rather new at dmt, and probably wasted a bunch of it trying to use the pipe.  no breakthrough yet, the first 3 times I tried i got mild closed eye visuals, tried out the soda bottle + tinfoil method today to a super entense close eye visual experience. Kinda like the first time I did mushrooms.  thanks"
DMT,3bkoze,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:20:05 2015 UTC,"I load my 20-30mg onto the 7 screens inside the gvg and replace the ceramic filter piece. Grab the bic, turn the pipe slightly (not too much) so it's easier to bend the flame, light the lighter and clear my lungs, then I draw in slowly just enough to bend the flame and create vapor. I'll do this until the pipe is pretty full (~5 seconds) then remove the lighter and pull hard to force the vapor deep into my lungs. Hold it for 5-10 seconds and hang on :)"

DMT,3biche,iwillnotfapsrs,4,Mon Jun 29 13:43:59 2015 UTC,"Firstly, you want to use a steel or copper scrubber as opposed to steel wool. Steel wool is a bit too fine and will actually burn. Once you have the right material you'll want to carefully heat the scrubber so the DMT melts into it and continue to heat until you see vapor starting to develop. Then take your hit, being careful to only heat as needed to produce vapor without burning the spice. You'll know it is burning if it becomes really harsh on your throat and lungs. After you take a substantial hit, hold it in for as long as you can. Before you exhale, start to heat the scrubber again. Once the vapor starts, breathe out and take your next hit. Repeat as necessary or until you are no longer a part of this dimension. Good luck!"
DMT,3biche,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:04:52 2015 UTC,"Great answer but just to clarify it will already be somewhat harsh, similar to smoking. If you burn it, it will suddenly get extremely harsh. Also instead of a steady vapor a burst of smoke will appear inside the machine."

DMT,3biche,stochastic42,2,Mon Jun 29 23:17:55 2015 UTC,The neck faces down and the DMT goes on top of the steel (inside the bottle essentially) You have to take the steel out to put the DMT on top.  This is a good guide

DMT,3bfcy6,free_the_robots,10,Sun Jun 28 22:16:14 2015 UTC,"Not sure you're body weight but I know girls who take 70mg who weigh less than 140lbs.   The problem isn't that you took too much it's that your using it in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons, and it's letting you know so to speak."
DMT,3bfcy6,stochastic42,3,Sun Jun 28 22:36:37 2015 UTC,"hmm.. yes i think i did get the message to take a break from it.. but i don't feel like i was using it for the wrong reasons or abusing it.  but i do appreciate the sentiment and will have to consider that. as far as dosage is concerned, i think there may be a discrepancy in how they smoke it.  my oil pipe is quite efficient, but i would usually do 50-55mg for a guaranteed breakthrough.  a friend that has a glass vapor genie swears it only takes him 40-45 and was surprised that i do as much as 50.  but this dose i took was unmeasured so it could have been more than 70, i'm not sure.  i'm quite experienced with my personal dosages and i know that what i took the other night was simply too much, and that's why i had a traumatic experience.  I'm 170-180lbs btw."
DMT,3bfcy6,smokinjoe65,3,Sun Jun 28 23:25:56 2015 UTC,"Sensitivity may play a part in it all, but I weigh up 15-30mg in my gvg for strong breakthrough experiences and I weigh 190."
DMT,3bfcy6,stochastic42,2,Mon Jun 29 10:39:06 2015 UTC,"Well obviously right or wrong reasons are subjective. One girl I saw an interview with recently took 68mg IV she looked around 135lbs, she didn't have a bad experience. Sensitivity may vary between individuals but my intuition is that taking a large dose (sub 120mg let's say) is not in itself going to cause a traumatic experience, but instead will cause an extremely intense experience that will be traumatic if you are not prepared for it. Sure you took too big a dose for where you were at at the time, but the way you talk about it seems like you are explaining away the experience rather than learning from it. Most people have a lot of inner work to do, some of them will take mushrooms and be confronted and say 'I hate mushrooms I always have a bad time'. Others will have a tough experience and they will learn from it, not externalize it, and next time they will break-through that space and have a more positive experience.   I could be wrong but that is how it seems to me."
DMT,3bfcy6,stochastic42,2,Mon Jun 29 01:46:51 2015 UTC,"good words. cheers man.  i guess you think you know the molecule and think you are prepared but it always has more to show you.  and sometimes it screams it at you with a bullhorn and punches you in the brain. a tough experience on mushrooms or LSD tends to be more internal and introspective, it show you parts of yourself.  with DMT it can be harder to understand the lessons, it's more external (kind of?) and tends to fade like a dream."
DMT,3bfcy6,dude_with_amnesia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:00:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's so true. It's hard to make sense of. To me integrating a DMT experience is more like integrating an emotion, it's more about being with and accepting the experience. Letting it in as opposed to understanding it."

DMT,3bfcy6,TetrisMcKenna,5,Sun Jun 28 19:54:03 2015 UTC,"it sounds counter intuitive, but in my experience having a little alcohol in my system can be a good thing.  not DRUNK, but a little buzzed.  it seems easier to breakthrough and a little more relaxed and inviting.  ....usually..... but in hindsight maybe i was more drunk than i should have been for this and it contributed to my bad trip.  DMT can be very inconsistent in effects and variables like that make it even more so."
DMT,3bfcy6,TetrisMcKenna,3,Sun Jun 28 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"that's imo more depending on your self and your alcohol ego.

DMT,3bfcy6,RaspberryJam,6,Mon Jun 29 00:02:00 2015 UTC,"An empty void! If you meditate extensively you'll find that emptiness is the underlying nature of all phenomena, the only thing worth identifying with. This is from a Buddhist perspective, of course. I don't know about reincarnation, but the Tibetans believe that after death you're shown a series of visions that determine your rebirth based on your reaction. The first is the clear, empty, white light. And it's said that without proper training and extensive, lifelong meditation, you won't recognise it as yourself, freak out, and thus be reborn again instead of set free."

I tried to call out for help, not verbally but mentally, hoping that there would be something that could help me. Some kind of presence, anything that wasn't part of the void. Nothing.

DMT,3bfcy6,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:26:46 2015 UTC,"The one thing that DMT has done for me is that I can't judge anything, after my breakthrough experience I just literally refuse to generalize almost anything.  But, from my personal experience (as I am basically an alcoholic and drink every day) smoking DMT is not fortuitous even if I haven't had much to drink. I've noticed that the effects either hardly work, or they are very dulled. I have ""broken through"" big time once while drunk but the thing about it was I forgot about the breakthrough for months and then I saw it - it was like the supercollider, super computer consciousness thing. And I remembered that I experienced time completely stop and weaved in and out of the super computer trillions of times and it was fucking chilling once I remembered it, it shook me to the core to be honest; that I was able to ""forget"" that experience for so long and then vividly remember it.  I also think that taking DMT before bed in my personal taste is a bad idea. I only say so because when I have done it before bed - I don't go to bed on time and then it's like going to bed on Christmas Eve when you're 5 and so excited that you'll probably get some toy race track but in reverse.  But, to me this sounds like a real breakthrough and 50-70mg is A LOT to be smoking in my opinion. Breakthrough doses aren't anything to play around with. On my breakthrough doses it was impossible to open my eyes (and they could have been open and I wouldn't have known).  The spice is some serious & bizarre stuff .... obviously you know that after taking it so many times. Personally, and all I am saying here is my own opinion so it's probably not even helpful and not meant to be conceited - but I am hugely positive on sub-breakthroughs or ""threshold doses"" for so many reasons but I think the 25-100mg range is really something that borders on, you know, if you believe if euthanasia should be legal or something very that is of a serious, matter of fact nature - but again just from my personal experience.  I'd add that the breakthrough while not sober was huge - the breakthrough at 4pm completely sober was just a TRILLION times more meaningful and powerful. life-changing. DMT is very sensitive to the dosage and seems to always have a completely different experience- literally completely different depending on technique and dosage - possibly awareness of what potentially could and will happen in the ""subconscious"" - the only place where for me it has some level of consistency is in the 10mg range and I'm all about those, haha ;) I'd like to say one more time that I think ""breakthrough"" doses are extremely serious - you either HAVE to know and dive completely out of this human timeline, or you could probably just grab a more than amazing small dose that is more than sufficient and mysteriously awesome.   Regardless of what you choose, good luck out there :)"

DMT,3bgc8t,Molestador,2,Mon Jun 29 04:57:24 2015 UTC,I don't know the tek but 50g is pretty small batch. I would split it in half and do two batches of 75g if you are going to split it.

DMT,3b7p8s,maxwinterao,9,Fri Jun 26 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"It won't be effective if you just eat it. There's a chemical in your stomach that makes it inactive. Like the other commenter said, you would need an MAOI (Monoamine oxidase inhibitor) which takes the chemical out of the picture so the DMT can be absorbed through the stomach and get to the brain.   IDK if you know much about ayahuasca, but it's basically a really old way of making DMT drinkable and making it effective that way. One plant has the DMT, the other plant has the MAOI, and when they're boiled together to specifications and consumed the user has a drawn out DMT trip.   As for taking crystallized DMT with an MAOI in pill form, I believe the word for that is pharmahuasca, and I'm not terribly familiar with that."

DMT,3b7p8s,supercerealyouguys,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:22:00 2015 UTC,"The amount of DMT it has is not enough to have a significant effect.  Mescaline is potentiated by DAOI's not MAOI's but harmine, the most commonly used MAOI is also a DAOI so chances are your MAOI will, inadvertently, potentiate the mescaline."

DMT,3b8aqa,Atheio,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:25:46 2015 UTC,If you are talking about using isopropyl in place of naphtha/non-polar solvent then thus is not correct and will yield really poor results. But you are right about not needing a freezer. Leave your dish out in the open and blow a fan over it. Should be ready to smoke after a few hours. Only reason to use a freezer is so you can recycle your naphtha afterword or you aren't comfortable with the naphtha fumes being evaporated inside your home.

Take deep slow breaths before, to get a nice long draw and hold it in as long as you can. Dont exhale too soon because you immediately feel the intensity. This is normal. Hold it as long as you can. Youll probably starting breathing heavily because its comforting to hear yourself breathing (confirming youre still alive) but this is only going to distract you from the experience.

Personally I don't treat DMT as some mystical, spiritual, life altering experience... It's like psychonaut Crack if you ask me. Up until you exhale you might be nervous but if you prepare you truly have nothing to worry about.   Eliminate all fears by setting it up fail proof. Find a cozy room, decent lighting, easy going music, air conditioning, have a little bit of food in your stomach, water nearby (preferably with a cap), safe proof the room for a toddler and I don't see why you should fear anything.   As long as you weigh your dose you know you can't over do it.   Eventually you'll be eyeballing large amounts of it and hitting it as you please. Again as you come down. It won't matter where you are. I use to sit I'm my backyard smoking it like a cigarette.. day night whatever. With friends... without. It's all the same.   Maybe set up a camera to see how you act so you can see there isn't much danger of hurting yourself. Be sure to have somewhere safe to set the lighter and pipe though.   Seriously. The DMT takes over and does the work for you. Just give it the proper venue for your first time and you'll be fine. Do it in a spot you're 100% comfortable in and you have nothing to worry about."

Fill those lungs up and hold it in. The longer you do the more of the hit you absorb. I like to count to 30. I also don't take the full hit from the pipe, I stop short of full and finish the breath with fresh air to push all the vapor into my lungs. I also plan to hit the pipe twice or three times in a row. It's hard to get your whole dose in one hit. It's that second one where things really get going.  It's like the first hit is dipping a toe into the pool, the second one is like when you walk into the water and it touches your privates, and the third is like jumping in off the high dive. I also recommend loading more stuff than you intend to smoke. Not that you'll get it all, but I expect you'll find that if you get a real good hit  you can recognize it then you can just put the pipe down and enjoy."
DMT,3b78vi,xandarrr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:39:23 2015 UTC,The idea is that you're heating the glass til it's hot enough to vaporize the chemical... then you roll the chemical over the heated glass and inhale as it vaporizes. Use a torch it's much easier. You won't burn it as long as you don't hold it in one spot.

I sent this to someone else who asked, so il share my method...  You need a carb cap for one of your domeless nails. Go ahead and weigh out 50-70mg of dmt (yes 70mg if you aren't fucking around, that will literally guarantee an immersive break through). So anyway load about that fine herb inside of the carb cap. Try not to lose any through the hole. Put it aside. Start like fucking prepping your lungs to hold in the biggest hit of your life. Heat the nail up, pretty much red hot. Pause, let that bitch cool down. Like i usually will take 30 seconds doing some breathing exercise type shit, and mentally be like (here we go, here we go, its time). Carefully dump the dmt on the nail while carbing the nail at the same exact time. Like a perfectly executed COVER/DUMP at once. While your doing this start inhaling as soon as a little dmt gets on the nail. PULL SLOWLY AT FIRST. Fill the rig up, use the biggest fucking one you got. Then gun it full lung strength as you proceed to REMOVE THE CARB (WHILE SIMELTANSLY TAPPING IT TO GET WHATEVERS LEFT. Inhale as much as possibly, the whole hit is always possible to get. FORGET HOW MUCH IT HURTs. You're trying to break thru, literally hold that bitch in FOREVER. Dont worry about a lil extra smoke in the rig. HOLD THE MOTHER FUCKING HIT IN UNTILL ITS IMPOSSIBLE TOO.

Also consider you may be wrong as people with ASP are notoriously bad self-observers. Also psychology students are notorious for self-diagnosing conditions they may not have.  I have heard a few people describing similar experiences but none of them claimed to be ASP. My one friend who is ASP doesn't use drugs at all. He, like you, had a good upbringing and is really a model citizen.   The obvious thing that comes to mind for me is to try a larger dose.  It's really hard to think that you wouldn't have a breakthrough at a large enough dose.  I don't know if you believe in a soul, or other religious/occult things but as someone who does, it really seems like something is up on a deeper level. I think your condition be it ASP or just habitual lying and relationship dysfunction is probably the symptom of a deeper cause.

The dudes saying ""lying comes naturally to me"" and id say that everybody lies in some manor or fashion, and the fact that he feels guilty enough about it to think he has a disorder, probably means he isn't a sociopath. Ive had similar experiences in my life and i'm pretty sure im not a sociopath (hopefully) and even if I was it really doesn't matter as long as I behave and restrict myself, which everybody no matter how impulsive they are has to do in some fashion."

In the end, no substance will do the work for you but they might help you help yourself; although I've never done it myself I advocate Ayahuasca because it seems less distracting than other psychedelics. It is furthermore done in the context of a ceremony that should provide a solid framework for self-discovery (in addition to the substance itself). If you do LSD recreationally you might get somewhere or you might just have a fun trip and little more. As another user said you might want to consider picking up a meditation practice or an activity that will get you more atuned to your subtle body. I don't know how things work for psychopaths, maybe you'll need to make some adjustements but if you're serious about discovering the nature of the self and develop you will have to do the ground work, some things you cannot cheat."

DMT,3b1i15,MonetaryYuppie,6,Thu Jun 25 05:20:31 2015 UTC,"I feel that certain DMT insights have changed how I feel about our purpose in daily life, if that's kind of what you're referring to. I haven't completely dropped out of the rat race because I do need shelter, food, etc. but the ""high life"" that others hold so near and dear is relatively worthless to me. My sister always tells me, ""you should try harder, get out of your apartment and into a house, work for that better job, blazÃ© blazÃ©..."" but those things mean very little to me. Luckily, I make more than enough to live and play comfortably but I don't strive for excess.   I still mingle with people who hold money and possessions higher than inner growth and it is tiring to sit and listen to them compare their material wealth. I quickly stop judging, however, as I remind myself that it takes all kinds and their happiness may be measured on a different scale."
DMT,3b1i15,smokinjoe65,5,Thu Jun 25 05:50:47 2015 UTC,"leaning away from materialism before hand, realize it's an absurd modern dogmatism afterwards."
DMT,3b1i15,stochastic42,3,Thu Jun 25 07:43:32 2015 UTC,I didn't think much about materialism before smoking DMT. Lots of DMT smoking and then reading about shamanism has shown me that materialism is a modern lie. There's a separate spiritual dimension and a lot more going on on this planet than we're lead to believe.
DMT,3b1i15,hashmon,3,Thu Jun 25 17:30:22 2015 UTC,"I never thought much about it beforehand honestly, I have worked as a professional chef for almost ten years, love food love cooking. I can not eat meat any longer though ever since I first broke through and had intense feelings of being connected to every living being. Money or material objects never played a huge role in my life before hand (obviously being a chef and all LOL) but this has been something that has stuck with me for over a year now. It truly changed me, for what I at least believe is the better."
DMT,3b1i15,MisterB247,2,Thu Jun 25 23:25:03 2015 UTC,"Do you mean materialism as the philosophical position that all phenomena are essentially material? Or accumulating material goods as a life goal, i.e. being materialistic?  I'd say that if you mean the first, my opinion has not changed. You might want to check out a blog post I wrote about this:  http://www.samwoolfe.com/2014/05/is-materialism-really-dogmatic-and.html  I still see no reason to believe that any phenomenon has a non-material basis, even after smoking DMT.  If you mean the second, I would say that I was most definitely non-materialistic before trying DMT, in that I did not view possessing things as a way to be happy. But I think after DMT I place more value on trying to be a happier person and seeking out beauty in the world."

DMT,3az3kf,dmtits,10,Wed Jun 24 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"Relax. DMT resists far hotter temperatures during the extraction process: think about how Ayahuasca is brewed. The thing that can weaken its potency is oxidation from pronged exposure to air. So long as you keep yours vacuum sealed like that, it should be just fine.  Edit: you can easily recrystalise it yourself by dissolving it in a bit of hexane then letting the solvent evaporate completely."

DMT,3b0jnl,TONY_DANZA_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:19:41 2015 UTC,"Are you positive about the time frame? (40 seconds from you finishing inhaling, to you vomiting and not tripping any more?)  I AM NOT A DOCTOR, but are you on any other medications? Possibly an MAOI?  I'm thinking what may have happened was you had a small anxiety attack, which caused the vomiting, and also flooded your brain with adrenaline, which somehow prevented the DMT from making it to the 5-HT receptors in your brain. Maybe it just happened within the time of the blood from your lungs making it to your brain and prevented the DMT from making it to your brain, maybe competitive binding, maybe some other reason. There needs to be significant research done to fully understand how this molecule works so I don't think anyone could offer you an exact reason why this happened. Hopefully this is kind of close though."
DMT,3b0jnl,enigma2050,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:57:00 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not on any medications at the moment.  I am absolutely certain that the whole experience was over in under a minute. I ran through the events with the my sitter, he confirmed it for me. I definitely did feel a big wave of anxiety whilst the whole room turned yellow and I started to feel the effects, until I threw up. 10 or so seconds after I was able to stand up and talk to him, things were still a bit strange but I was functional, and was able to clean up the mess within 3 minutes from when I inhaled. What you are saying seems to be right to me, it offers a good explanation for what happened. I'm going for a much smaller dose next time, to be on the safer side of things. Thinking on it though, I only really felt like vomiting as soon as I smelled the weed, before that I just felt pretty strong anxiety. Any tips on how to cope with that?"
DMT,3b0jnl,canadiancarcass,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:47:59 2015 UTC,"Well I'm figuring that the smell of weed probably spiked your anxiety to the point where you vomited. You said the smell of weed usually makes your stomach churn. That alone means you have a pretty strong physical response to the smell of weed. I'd say for starters, don't have people smoking joints right next to you while you're taking off. For anxiety about tripping in general, be confident in your dosage, and realize that no matter what, everything you're experiencing is only in your mind, and it is not permanent, it will end soon enough. And just observe and enjoy."

Its always been a very mild before so I tried upping my dosage.  It caught me off guard.  To be fair tho, I really thought I was in real trouble.  I never would have called 911 otherwise."
DMT,3axulc,dmtpsychonaut,2,Wed Jun 24 11:29:49 2015 UTC,Can you shed some light on your dosage and preparation? Was it pharmahuasca or acacia tea or capsuled root bark powder or what? It would be helpful for people looking to try oral DMT to know at what level things got too intense for you.

DMT,3axulc,denje,5,Wed Jun 24 13:35:58 2015 UTC,"That seems crazy that EMT's wouldn't know what DMT is.

DMT,3axulc,djwonderful,5,Wed Jun 24 13:55:06 2015 UTC,I went through the EMT training not longer then a year ago and DMT was never specifically mentioned or psychedelics for that matter. The closest we ever came across saying DMT was tryptamines.
DMT,3axulc,bkconn,4,Wed Jun 24 21:02:45 2015 UTC,It wasn't just the EMTs either.  Even the doctor didn't know what it was.  Not a single person I encountered last night had heard of it.

DMT,3axulc,cherok420,3,Wed Jun 24 14:12:36 2015 UTC,"The issue is that a DMT ""overdose"" is just when you have an experience that's too powerful for your comfort and you lose your shit.

DMT,3b063t,COMELY_LIL_KNT_69x,6,Wed Jun 24 22:23:25 2015 UTC,I'd be more interested in what DMT taught straight people about gender fluidity.
DMT,3b063t,Didymos_Black,9,Wed Jun 24 22:36:37 2015 UTC,I have a feeling peoples experiences under DMT regarding gender fluidity are going to be quite slim.
DMT,3b063t,iliketotryptamine,3,Wed Jun 24 23:33:13 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends.  That could be half of the knowledge they receive from a breakthrough.  When I experienced ego death on shrooms, I wasn't male or female, I just existed.  I had no body, I couldn't feel my body at all, I was everything.  Variations on that could see you living the entire life of someone else as the opposite sex, or genderless altogether."
DMT,3b063t,Didymos_Black,4,Thu Jun 25 00:21:07 2015 UTC,"Well, on acid I realized that my conception of sexuality and disgust for sex with men is entirely social. It seemed so completely blasÃ© to think I could make love to any gender whatsoever, it's hard to explain, because I still identify as straight. I just no longer thought it was a big deal either way, if that makes sense.   edit disgust is a rather pejorative word, I would have rather said something else, but I will leave it."
DMT,3b063t,alexispres,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"I understand completely, actually.  It seems like opposite gendered pairing is completely a social construct.    On a government control level, our tax laws either benefit breeding couples or are a detriment to them.  In the US, you get tax breaks for having children (we need cannon fodder).  In China, you get taxed heavily for having more than one child (they need enough resources to feed everyone).  Religion cherishes breeding couples to boost their numbers.  It's not a wonder that homosexuality is looked at negatively by these institutions (I know very little about China's view of it, but it appears to be a don't ask/don't tell kind of thing).  Even that church that the Duggars belong too wants their members to have as many children as humanly possible so that they can just plain breed enough members to be in charge of everything.  Since most wars are not fought on the ground anymore though, it seems stupid to just have the largest numbers to ""win."""
DMT,3b063t,Didymos_Black,2,Thu Jun 25 11:46:02 2015 UTC,"I'm straight, but one time I had a very strange trip where the words on my TV screen arranged themselves to form the words: YOU WANT DICK. It was very clear, no mistaking it. After I came down, I seriously pondered whether that meant I was gay. I came to the conclusion that no, I'm not gay. Mostly because I'm attracted to females. But it was very weird. I think my mind was just fucking with me."
DMT,3b063t,dmtpsychonaut,2,Thu Jun 25 02:52:42 2015 UTC,Everyone wants dick sometimes.  Didn't you ever watch Chasing Amy?
DMT,3b063t,Didymos_Black,2,Thu Jun 25 11:47:01 2015 UTC,I did ayahuasca not too long ago and there was a moment were I can't remember 100% what happened but it trolled the fuck out of me. I just remember Joe Rogan's voice saying something about how you should swallow your own loads because somehow that was the secret to the universe? I don't know thats kind of what  I remember.   I remember something similar on high dose on LSD. I just remember a voice or something telling me to do something absolutely ridiculous to unlock the secrets of the universe. Who the hell knows maybe if I swallowed my own load god would come down from the sky and tell me I won or something haha.  I think its probably just my psyche coming up with ridiculous goofy shit.
DMT,3az85x,hokksund,3,Wed Jun 24 18:09:24 2015 UTC,"Without water for sure! the flame gets fucked up by the pulsing of the water breaking up!  Plus I've found for people that havent had it before through a bong should;  A) have no water, small amount of bud/tobacco in the bottom of the cone piece so it doesn't rip the crystal straight through, then put your dmt on top of that in the center and spread out, now either cover it with weed or ash (straight from the ashtray)  B) Take it as slow as you can, milk it up even if it takes ages, just make sure that the flame isn't touching it, with the bong tilted I like to hold it under so that the heat is just going straight up and in there with the flow you're making! If you do it right you will have 1 rip and you'll start to break through before you even have a chance to put the bong down!  C) you can also have 1 small toke in the middle if the smoke is too much to handle!  D) I've never wrote like this before but im really blazed so whatever, mang.  Safe travels my Homie!"
DMT,3az85x,Tom_Tuck,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"Dang, this sounds like one of the most unpleasant ways to do this. Not only does weed instantly begin to work against the effects of dmt, though in very small amounts it's probably not noticeable to a novice, but adding in stale ash on top and direct flame, which ash or a little weed wouldn't really prevent, you've got a while combination of bad tastes and inefficiency.   The machine build is ideal, or a vapor method. The first can be cheaply made. The second is best.   Thank you for giving advice that worked for you though. It's just not very ideal if alternative methods exist."
DMT,3az85x,EvolutionTheory,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:58:14 2015 UTC,"Ummm how are you getting direct flame on the dmt.. It's covered with weed or ash, plus you don't let the flame touch it, what's so hard about that? I've done it a lot of times with his method and I can break through with 1 hit."
DMT,3az85x,Tom_Tuck,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:37:34 2015 UTC,"My post didn't claim it wouldn't work.  Direct flame is placing the flame onto the bowl. Now in your post I see:   just make sure that the flame isn't touching it, with the bong tilted I like to hold it under so that the heat is just going straight up and in there with the flow you're making!    Which is great. My bad for missing that before!  Typically non-direct flame would be vape. Often herb is used to block the flame so it's not direct but practically speaking it's not blocking anything.   Keep doing what works for you. My point was only the experience may be optimized a bit more than this."
DMT,3az85x,EvolutionTheory,2,Thu Jun 25 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that you said it wouldn't :P. Direct flame would be defined as the flame touching the material youre trying to vape, all you actually want is the hot airs :3  Yeah there are definitely better ways to intake dmt than this method thats for sure, but op was only really asking about this method :P"

When sober I can sometimes, if concentrating hard enough, get quick nanosecond flashes of what hyperspace looks/feels like, but when high it seems that these snapshots are slightly clearer, and I can hold them in my mind's eye for slightly longer.

DMT,3avdts,wally3791,2,Tue Jun 23 20:27:28 2015 UTC,"Let it separate, get a glass container that's easy to scrape with a razor blade. I used a pyrex dish. I recommend a lid so you don't spill naphtha in your freezer and waste spice. Let it sit for 2-3 days without touching it in the coldest part of your freezer. Tada, separate the naphtha back into the jar with the sludge using a coffee filter to catch your DMT. Very simple, don't over think it."
DMT,3avdts,iliketotryptamine,2,Tue Jun 23 20:33:35 2015 UTC,"Would a glass baking dish with cling wrap over the top of it work?  None of my glass baking dishes have lids. After I put the naphtha back into the jar with the sludge, some tek say that you can leave the baking dish out to allow all the residual naphtha to evaporate, which can in turn result in residual spices being left behind.  Also, if I wish to extract further, what should I do?  Add more lye?  Add more naphtha?  Repeat the warming/shaking/separating process again?  Thanks for the help, man!"
DMT,3avdts,iliketotryptamine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:42:31 2015 UTC,"Yes that should work. Just to keep out any dirt/water, and it helps to stop it from spilling. I let it sit and dry for a few hours/day in front of a fan and then scrape everything off. Once you get it off, leave the dish as it is, and repeat the steps again like the first time. Keep doing this until your naphtha doesn't yield anything else. You can either save it for your next extraction or toss it and use fresh next time. No problem, very happy to help. This is very easy and once you get it right the first time you'll be good to go."

At what point does this happen?  When do you let the dish sit and dry for a few hours?  After you put the naphtha back in the jar with the sludge?  Lastly, if you're putting the naphtha back into the jar with the sludge and you want to attempt another extraction, do you put fresh naphtha in there along with your lye?  If so, how much?"
DMT,3avdts,UnkelBewger,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:05:25 2015 UTC,"Once you've let it sit in the freezer to clump up, and when you pour out the Naphtha you will keep the dish and all the DMT you have, and let it sit out so the residual naphtha evaporates. If you want to put fresh naphtha instead of the used, put the same amount you put the first time. Either reuse the original naphtha if you're trying to save money, of you want fresh naphtha put that in. Don't mix the two as that's not needed."

You also want to infuse the lotus, otherwise its just extra material to smoke. Remember that because of the weight of the herbs, you need double the weight to blast off (if your ratio is 1:1). E-leaf will not last as long as changa. The MAOI is what prolongs the experience. If you want your trip extended and aren't on any meds or food that will interact with an MAOI, I would recommend taking harmala extract about half an hour before smoking the e-leaf. That way your partner can still enjoy the e-leaf safely while you enjoy a longer experience."
DMT,3at17q,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:33:48 2015 UTC,I like to add that one doesn't have to care about food interactions IF the maoi is smoked. This of course isn't true for medicamentation or other drug interactions. But food isn't a problem with smoked maois.
DMT,3at17q,RedSteppa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:44:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't know this, thanks for the info!"
DMT,3at17q,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:01:49 2015 UTC,That is because the maoi doesn't come in contact with tha mao in the guts as it would when you eat it.
DMT,3at17q,RedSteppa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:14:53 2015 UTC,Makes sense! Good to know.
DMT,3at17q,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:57:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. Do you think I could I use the e-leaf or Changa in my DaBuddha vape? Im thinking a shorter whip than normal to avoid too much being wasted sticking to the sides. I also figure the whip would be toast after but the tubing is cheap.  So how does e-leaf make it easier to not mess up smoking if you still have to worry about heat? I decided to try this because the sandwich method Ive used is not consistent, if this isnt going to be more consistent then I dont see how its worth it for e-leaf. Changa has some enhanced effect from MAOI so I could see why its worth the trouble.   Is it much more forgiving or just slightly so? I ask because if its not going to vastly simplify the process of smoking/vaping my DMT then Ill just stick to the GVG I have on the way."
DMT,3at17q,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:58:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't see why that vape would not work. I forget what temperature DMT vaporizes at but you can find it online pretty easily.   It's easier to smoke as e-leaf because you just get the bowl cherried and pull. You only use the lighter for a moment so you don't have to worry so much about burning it. I find it to be very consistent and a fully packed bowl will take me on 5 or 6 trips before I have to reload.  If you're getting the GVG though, I've heard it is a really easy, foolproof way to blast off with freebase so you'll probably be good."

DMT,3aof1j,condescending_hindu,3,Mon Jun 22 04:39:11 2015 UTC,I think a sodium carbonate wash then recrystallization with hexane by slow evaping it by leaving it covered most of the time would work well to get it pure enough. When i do that all I'm left with is basically glass shards of pure dmt. From there I'm not sure where to go as I've always been too sketched out to actually inject anything into myself.
DMT,3aof1j,ComptonCrusader,2,Mon Jun 22 04:45:05 2015 UTC,"Well what else is DMT soluble in, as far as something that is safe to inject? From the point of as-pure-as-possible-without-a-lab crystals, you'd just need to solute it in something that is safe to inject.   I mean, Dr. Rick Strassman's experiments with DMT were all injected into the volunteers, so it's definitely possible."
DMT,3aof1j,joshualeet,3,Mon Jun 22 05:04:51 2015 UTC,"Well, saline would work best for dissolving and injecting it. Going along with what i said earlier hexane recrystallization would need to be performed probably several times. Then you would need a sterile syringe and a filter to get all the bacteria and contaminants out of the solution. I also would not try injecting yourself with it, although it seems like you won't try that, just saying. Anyway, i read that a size 27 1/2 gauge needle is best, any bigger and you can damage your veins. Make sure to sterilize with alcohol, use a tourniquet and all that as well, basically just be safe about it. I actually wouldn't be too worried about purity BTW if you wash and recrystallize, a lot of people inject much dumber stuff on a regular basis and survive lol."

DMT,3aof1j,ComptonCrusader,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:20:08 2015 UTC,"Sketchy is an understatement.  Theres a reason injection is so powerful, no matter what your drug of choice is.    How easy do you this procedure is?  what about the cost?  I'm looking to do this as cheaply and easily as possible."
DMT,3aof1j,ComptonCrusader,2,Mon Jun 22 05:02:47 2015 UTC,"I think this procedure is generally more difficult and costly than just using a gvg/machine and getting it all in one hit. It seems like that is your only problem with vaping it, the second or third hit. If cost is your issue you should just make the machine then work on your technique till you can get it all in one hit, that's my real advice, much less painful and scary. Once you have enough money i suggest a gvg, a chore boy copper scrubber disc (Walgreen's)  to load the DMT on to, and a torch lighter (jobon zb-529 or arc torch). Then you will probably never think about other methods lol."
DMT,3aof1j,Interversity,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:33:05 2015 UTC,"I already have all these things, except a torch lighter.  I have gvg, plenty of chore boy copper, and all the supplies needed to do my extraction.  I've spent so much money already trying to make this work.  Thats why cost is such a factor at this point.  Would having a torch type lighter make enough of a difference?  I would certainly agree that I need to get it all in one hit to blast off.    When I'm not on MXE, I kind of hate DMT.  It makes me feel terrible.  As soon as I take a hit, I just want the feeling to stop.  I feel overwhelmed both physically and mentally.  I can't help but to recoil in fear.  I'm fairly certain I could have broken through if not for my fear.  I still want to blast off so badly."
DMT,3aof1j,xeyve,2,Mon Jun 22 05:45:00 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, i always get the fear, it's kinda just part of the dmt experience for most people. But for me the fear melts away instantly when it kicks in and i know there is nothing to fear because i suddenly remember how amazing my previous trips had been. I think you need to take it more so you are more comfortable with it then take a dose that will make you have a breakthrough regardless of whether you are too afraid or not, this may sound bad but most of the fear comes from the drug's potential and not from what it has actually done to me. Try doing 40mg in one hit and try to not break through lol, then try to tell me it wasn't worth the fear going in afterwards. It's a very tricky drug but it is always worth it in my opinion. Also, a torch is very helpful but I've never actually tried it without one so i can't say much on that other than it does not clog the filter over time and the flame is adjustable so you can keep a consistent vape."

DMT,3aofi3,MonetaryYuppie,2,Mon Jun 22 04:44:16 2015 UTC,"â¢ Yes you can dab it, but you do not want to dab it on a ""hot"" Ti nail, you want it to be as cool as possible, but still warm enough to vaporize it.  Do you dab (cannabis oil) frequently? Do you know what ""carb capping"" is? You'll want to do that with the DMT. Basically, heat your nail up evenly, nice and hot, but give it a considerable about of time to cool down. Then dump your dose onto it, and immediately cap the nail (hopefully you have your own carb cap, do some research on this if you're unsure, maybe you have something that you can substitute), but you want to cover the nail up and create an almost-vacuum (carb caps have a tiny hole for airflow) so that what's inside vaporizes at a lower temperature and you're sure to get all of it without inhaling through a fully open nail/dome. I personally prefer using a domeless Ti nail for this, but a nail & dome works as well. Any more questions, feel free to ask.   â¢ Generally, you'll be out of your body for 10-15 minutes, and once you return, you'll have another 15-30 minutes of a trip/comedown/afterglow. Give yourself at least an hour of free time, especially for your first go. You'll definitely not want to have to worry about having any obligations afterward, you'll want to bask and integrate the experience you've just had.   â¢ Music is up to you. Some people like it, some don't. The sounds of DMT are very interesting, but some people feel that having some very light/low music playing can help guide their trip/reground them to reality when necessary. What type of music are you into? If you go the music route, definitely low volume, something familiar.   â¢ I personally wouldn't recommend cannabis beforehand, it's known to dull the psychedelic aspect for some, but some people have no negative effects from it. Cannabis may help you calm down, as it does for many, but there's the other end of the spectrum where it intensifies things, being too into your head before the trip, making you second guess yourself. That is just me, personally. EVERYONE is different.  I recommend being sober for your first DMT experience, you want to go into it with s clear mind and experience DMT as it is completely in and of itself with no other variables and alterations. After this, you're free to experiment to your comfort level.   â¢ What's the worst thing that could happen? I don't know, you understand the world around you isn't as it seems and want to share the stories of your amazing experiences with other people but can't do it without sounding crazy?   But seriously, don't go into it worrying about the worst that could happen. If you've done enough research, you'll see the wide array of positive and difficult experiences with DMT. Rarely are there any catastrophic experiences (I can't recall any off the top of my head), but anything can happen. You are your own person, this chemical will give you a unique experience unlike anyone else's. Of course there will be similarities, but what happens inside your mind and behind your eyelids is completely unique to you.   Good luck on your journey friend, we'll be waiting to meet you on the other side :)"

DMT,3aofi3,joshualeet,2,Mon Jun 22 05:36:25 2015 UTC,"No worries mate! I remember my first time and being ultra curious and having tons of questions. I had people answer them all and I enjoy returning the favor and sharing the knowledge to those who seek it (rather than dive head first into unknown waters. Harm reduction is #1!)  Is your plan to breakthrough? I've dabbed 60mg (.06 grams) and didn't breakthrough. Then I dabbed 60mg again at a later date and shattered reality, haha. I think that has to do with having my nail too hot the first time and wasting a portion of the DMT to heat.   People say breakthrough doses range from 50-100mg, as well as being dependent on quality. Do you know the quality of what you have? Did you get it from someone, off the DNM's, or extract it yourself?"
DMT,3aofi3,joshualeet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:46:08 2015 UTC,"I purchased it from someone who claimed it was from the dark net. It's orange/red (not pure white -__-), and looks sort of clumpy."
DMT,3aofi3,stochastic42,2,Mon Jun 22 05:48:58 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, most people don't come across pure white crystals, unless you're extracting it yourself and are willing to sacrifice a portion of quantity for quality. Multiple recrystallizations strip away impurities, so you lose weight. People that are extracting just to sell are not interested in that for obvious reasons. I'm sure what you have is fine.   You can give it a test run to test potency if you want, or you can just go for it. Surprisingly, tolerance doesn't build very fast, smoked DMT metabolizes very quickly. You can redose again an hour later if you chose to.   You can wait for other opinions, but maybe start with 60-70mg. What's your psychedelic history like? This isn't your first one, yeah?"
DMT,3aofi3,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay. For sure. And as for previous psychedelics, I've done LSD five or so times and 3 grams of shrooms once. I smoke dabs every day though haha"
DMT,3aofi3,tomdavesy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:03:05 2015 UTC,Seems to me like most people report similar experience to myself which is closer to 5-8 minutes out of body.
DMT,3aofi3,tomdavesy,2,Mon Jun 22 22:16:59 2015 UTC,To add onto what joshualeet said about music: I always recommend instrumental tunes if you want to go with music. Lyrics can take on a very strange quality in hyperspace.
DMT,3aofi3,killthehighcourts,2,Mon Jun 22 10:14:08 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks. I was thinking something by Shpongle or Tycho."
DMT,3am1hh,lsdislove,5,Sun Jun 21 15:30:28 2015 UTC,Basically the machine is a crack pipe. Right ?
DMT,3am1hh,odix,3,Mon Jun 22 00:25:29 2015 UTC,I personally hate steel wool. You'll have a much better experience with copper chore boy brillo pads. Burn the copper part off first. Other than that the bottle is perfect.
DMT,3am1hh,Scobufffff,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"B...but sir, they're made of pure copper!"
DMT,3am1hh,ComptonCrusader,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:34:45 2015 UTC,Please tell me you're being sarcastic.
DMT,3am1hh,Scobufffff,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:41:41 2015 UTC,Not unless you were talking about copper coated scrubber. But otherwise i was being serious yeah.
DMT,3am1hh,ComptonCrusader,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:47:04 2015 UTC,Brillo pads work way better than steel wool does for the machine IME
DMT,3am1hh,Scobufffff,2,Mon Jun 22 04:56:59 2015 UTC,If by brillo pads you mean chore boy copper scrubbers i agree. They are easy to shape and i think the fact that they are ribbon shaped increases the surface area and thus holds the liquid better.
DMT,3am1hh,ComptonCrusader,2,Mon Jun 22 05:04:21 2015 UTC,"So, I went to the supermarket yesterday and got this 14cm Madeira wine bottle.   I drilled a 8mm hole on the bottom and added approximately 4-5cm of burned stainless steel scrubber to the neck, moderately packed.  I took a dry puff to test the airflow and I could pull air with a small resistance, it also tasted like metal, so there's that.   I'm posting this so I can verify if i'm good to go, since this is going to be my very first time with DMT.   Thanks, guys :)"

DMT,3am1hh,ZacDaddy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:57:26 2015 UTC,I'd find finer steel wool.
DMT,3am1hh,animalsafari,2,Sun Jun 21 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"Judging from the fine details of the cloth fibers in the pic I'm pretty sure the bottle and wool is smaller in real life, looks fine IMO."
DMT,3am1hh,ZacDaddy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:07:25 2015 UTC,"it looks wide like it came from a scrub brush, not actual steel wool. I tried using that and i had some sprinkle out. Switching to steel wool like this worked much better."
DMT,3am1hh,spicepirate,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:50:43 2015 UTC,"This right here works the best.  OP's is indeed from a scrub brush, I used the same exact type on my first machine then bought real steel wool like /u/Zacdaddy posted and never looked back.  But after saving up and several hundred expeditions later, I now blast off with a GVG which is night  and day in comparison. :)"
DMT,3am1hh,WonkyWarrior,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:30:12 2015 UTC,"I just did DMT for the first time like 20 minutes ago with a machine pretty much just like yours, fucking woah dude I dont think I broke through but I feel fucking great right now, real warm it is awesome."
DMT,3am3ab,blazeit420dude,16,Sun Jun 21 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"DMT is not addictive (although it could be argued psychological addiction happens if you're bent on returning to the higher dimensions) and the bedroom is a prime place to do it. Somewhere calm and comfortable is the best.  There are almost no (I say almost because there are none that I'm aware of but it's better to research that pretty well before use) side effects to speak of and you very likely will not be messed up long term, assuming you don't have a history of psychosis (some people report that psychedelics can set off episodes). That said, for the half an hour after you take it you're going to be pretty messed up so plan for that.  P.S. Regulars to this sub, we want to spread knowledge and have a culture of ""there is no dumb question"" so please don't be sarcastic on serious threads like this. OP is trying to educate himself and it's our job to help."
DMT,3am3ab,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,2,Sun Jun 21 16:43:59 2015 UTC,Watch this documentary.  It's really informative.  Keep in mind though that they were given very specific intravenous doses though. https://youtu.be/ewdWBHh8hY8
DMT,3am3ab,Didymos_Black,2,Mon Jun 22 00:29:35 2015 UTC,I'm on mobile without WiFi right now but am I safe in assuming that's Rick Strassman's clinical trials with DMT? I've been meaning to watch it for a while and I'm currently reading the book
DMT,3am3ab,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,2,Mon Jun 22 03:06:25 2015 UTC,"Bingo!  And I intend to pick up the book at some point, but hearing the subjects' stories first hand puts me in an amazingly positive headspace.  I just want to sit with the shaman and cry, because the feelings he had after his trip, I had."
DMT,3am3ab,Didymos_Black,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"Don't you think it's also his job to like google it before wanting to try a drug? I mean, those are some pretty fucking basic informations."
DMT,3am3ab,xeyve,2,Sun Jun 21 23:17:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's true. But it's not our job to judge how he seeks that information out. If we are his only source we should try and give the most accurate information possible."
DMT,3am3ab,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,2,Mon Jun 22 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"I'm far from against the dissemination of this kind of information. I just don't think that a forum like this one is an appropriate place to ask those question.   You have to build a base of knowledge, something you can stand on for further inquiry, but that require some research.   I don't feel like going on internet forums and just believing whatever we're told is an effective way of truly learning about something. It can be a useful tool for reaching a community of like-minded individuals and a bunch of other things, but it shouldn't be how you learn the basic."
DMT,3am3ab,xeyve,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:24:15 2015 UTC,"I am inclined to agree, but my point stands. Even if it's irresponsible, if we are the only place OP reaches out to for information we should be smart about what we tell him, no matter how silly it is that he hasn't sourced information elsewhere"
DMT,3am3ab,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,3,Mon Jun 22 17:14:47 2015 UTC,Pretty nice spot since you'll feel comfortable and lying in bed. No worries about your body with that.

DMT,3am3ab,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:48:48 2015 UTC,"I did two pretty good puffs I got from from a friend as a pre-buy trial dose and was tripping harder than I ever had or have since. I'm not sure on the dose but we were parked on the side of a house covered in aluminum siding and I witnessed the sole first floor window morph into a crystalline cougar and leap towards me.  Believe me when I tell you this isn't a ""man I tripped so hard I ate bark because I thought it was a cookie"" bullshit type stories. I'm being 100% serious about how hard core my visuals were. If you'd like, I wrote up a trip report I wrote about half an hour afterward (with assorted very minor grammatical and clarity changes made since then, because I was still a little zoinked when I wrote it) that I can send you once I get home. Just PM me and I'll be sure to toss it your way"

DMT,3al71b,RedSteppa,2,Thu Jun 25 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"For me, there's always a sequence of events:   First, I start to feel 'weird' and my heart rate accelerates Then I get the mother of all head rushes Then my vision starts to go wonky, as the room shifts and morphs. This is the launch sequence :) My hearing goes wonky too. I always have an AC or something on, so I never hear the carrier tone. Just part of a sound that 'hangs' and constantly loops on itself as it gets louder. Kind of menacing, actually. It took me a few trips before I realized this was what was scaring the shit out of me I start to forget who I am as I'm sucked into a vortex and away from reality   Sometimes, I come out of the trip and end up getting sucked back in."

As I am used to identifying with my egoic mind I felt quite terrified of my experience at the time, as it was slowly disintegrating. Suddenly I heard a deep echoing laughter. Several seconds later I realized that my body was laughing, that it was me. At the time I was flying through hyperspace and certainly experiencing something physical from there.

I didn't break thru, but it was completely terrifying.  To be fair, I took the sryian rue on a full stomach and I was quite nauseous.  I really thought I was going to puke and or die.

I guess that's a little off topic, but would the 35-45 minutes be as intense as just a 3-5 minute trip? i could see doing that after more use with the drug, it's amazing."

For the life of me though, I can't find sources on which herbs, and for that I apologize  Edit: Just read someone used parsley. I don't think it's super important what you use, the idea is that you don't necessarily want it to interfere with your DMT. Weed will work just fine if that's what you want to do, but any green household herb should be fine too (look up the herb before you use it though, there are probably things in your spice cabinet that would have adverse effects if smoked)"

DMT,3ag75i,SF88E,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:54:07 2015 UTC,Thanks this was very informative. Do you ever feel that it is better in 'the void' or out there? Like you loose grip of this reality to avoid its limitations?
DMT,3ag75i,belsefar,2,Sat Jun 20 14:28:19 2015 UTC,"Its different, I found as it was my first time I was really freaked by the experience, I haven thought about whether I think its better there. To be honest it was so mind blowing you cant make the comparison while your there, and when I came back I was in awe of how DMT took a psychedelic shot gun and just blows my brains out... Its not for the faint hearted... I don't think there are limitations, thinking back to it, I could have just been in the waiting room! what I wrote didn't come close! I did completely loose grip on this reality though.. I can see why people think they are dead on it because of that. But is it better? to be honest, its left me! I'm sure elements of it where better then here.... I guess ill have to have another go and come back to you..."
DMT,3ag75i,belsefar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:41:02 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks. I was thinking maybe more in terms of whether you felt like you lost the will to be in this reality, and instead felt an urge to stay in 'the void' - i.e. under the influence of DMT. This is my biggest concern which keeps me from trying."
DMT,3ag75i,belsefar,2,Mon Jun 22 19:08:35 2015 UTC,"In that case not at all. Its like its added to it. I'll definitely do it again, but its too intense for me to want to stay there; I don't think my heart could take it!  My Guru friend was telling me on the other hand that he made a batch and his mate was just saying more.. more.. and he had to put a stop to it because he didn't feel his friend was getting any thing from it.   For me I got something from it, Its made this reality more beautiful, and I feel more at peace. Although I want to do it again, I'm certainly not bugging him to whip up another batch :)."

DMT,3ai97p,TheUniverseIncarnate,7,Sat Jun 20 13:20:57 2015 UTC,"I understand your view but I disagree, from my experiences and researching those of other it cab be real, the easiest and most probable way to get to know this yourself is to breakthrough with an experienced friend with the intention of having a shared experience.  You may simply disagree with this and that's fine but don't say you know it for sure, the nature of consciousness is still a mystery to science.  That said, do I think all visuals are inherently real? No, but I believe some visuals/states of being could be. After all, we only see so little of the light available to us.  Now I do agree that it's a tool that we shouldn't lose ourselves in, the greatest growth comes from integrating these states in our lives."
DMT,3ai97p,AlwaysBeNice,10,Sat Jun 20 14:04:08 2015 UTC,"I respect you looking out for people, but your claim of it being nothing but a drug and that hyperspace is just in our heads is just as much of a conjecture as the beliefs of people that say ""it's made in the pineal gland and it's released when you die"". Someone could come here and say DMT is how the advanced race of grasshoppers in their back yard communicate with them and be just as right as you.  There is no way for you to know what it is or isn't, so why jump to conclusions? I think you missed the point behind what Mckenna was saying, as well."

DMT,3ai97p,worknman,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"Nah, I think he's right. I've broken through several times (have been out as long as 8 minutes); I've seen some weird shit on DMT, but never any entities and never anyone trying to communicate with me. My own personal opinion (and I do realize it's just an opinion) that your mind is so overwhelmed by what's going on that it shuts down for awhile and throws up a 'light show', because it doesn't know what else to do."

DMT,3ai97p,harder-better-faster,6,Sat Jun 20 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of someone abusing DMT.  The craziest consumer of the stuff uses it 6 times a year.   I suggest you read ""The Doors of Perception"" by Aldous Huxley. He, and many others after him, have a very different take on what psychedelics do for us, in comparison to your ""see and feel what we want to see and feel"" theory.   I've always been skeptical of the spiritual implications of these compounds, but I wouldn't relate people using them to change their perception and form belief systems to ""losing"" themselves.   I don't mind reminding people that these are just chemicals, but I think your missing the significance and usefulness of their effects.   Also you may want to consider the implication of what Molestador said. Making a direct argument is just going to make people defensive. Maybe try Socratic questioning to bring people to the same conclusions without making them angry."
DMT,3ai97p,Virgoth098,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:23:30 2015 UTC,6 times a year? That seems a little low...

DMT,3ai97p,TheHighestEagle,3,Sat Jun 20 19:30:12 2015 UTC,I 100% agree.   I'm sorry you're being down voted so much :(.
DMT,3ai97p,antonideli,9,Sun Jun 21 03:41:30 2015 UTC,"OP no one is losing themselves because of DMT...  it sounds like for whatever reason you just need to explain everything you saw...and the only way you can do that is by saying ""it's all in your mind"".  If it was all ""what we wanted to see and feel"" complete strangers wouldn't be having the exact same experiences.   I get the need to be able to explain things but some things we are just not meant to able to explain while were here."
DMT,3ai97p,giteeng,6,Sat Jun 20 14:28:51 2015 UTC,"I went on a two week dmt binge where I started to ""lose myself"" to DMT. At first it was deep curiosity as to what crazy thing will I see this time? Or maybe this will be the one that makes me believe in God. Point is DMT shows you an experience like an ink blot and you decide for yourself what you see. I've found that meditating on a subject right before a trip acts like a tool to help you gain deeper insight to something. It's kinda like tarot cards. Some people believe the cards predict the future or can cause curses or some other superstition, but when you enter with an open mind and you read the cards you see that the cards don't tell you anything you don't already know, but force you to consider different aspects of your life and how they relate in a way you might not have thought about. So I believe the same goes for DMT. It shows you something and how you interpret it is like the reading of the cards. For instance, if someone holds the belief of there being a God or some other unseen forces, then there is a good chance they will relate what they've seen to some heavenly nature (angels, demons, spirits, ghosts, etc) whereas on the other hand, someone with lots of knowledge on how the brain works and how different chemicals affect certain parts everything we experience might be less likely to think that there is any spiritual connection here."
DMT,3ai97p,infintropy,4,Sat Jun 20 14:50:54 2015 UTC,"noticed that the visuals didn't really consist of anything, no aliens, no gods, no beings, just abstract art, my brain and imagination filled in the rest.   In truth your ENTIRE REALITY is just as you described.  All that you think is real out here is just mostly imagination displaying what it thinks it should from the information coming through your senses.  You are still assuming that the reality you put together with faces and apples through your external aparatus is more real than the ones we put together inwardly."
DMT,3ai97p,Tmckez,3,Sat Jun 20 19:34:12 2015 UTC,"DMT is just a drug, a powerful drug, but just a drug. It doesn't actually open portals to some other universe where aliens/gods talk to you, it may seem that way, but it's only because you are under the influence of a drug.   The neurotransmitters in our brain are just chemicals, too, and your whole perception of reality is generated by them.  DMT and other tryptamine psychedelics have a very close molecule similarity to serotonin:  http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fig-1-Psychedelics.jpg"

It starts out barely noticeable and amplifies until it is all I hear. It also increases in frequency; I would compare it to like when you spin a quarter on a metal surface and the sound it makes as it comes to a stop. Sort of. Except once it gets to that ultimate peak of frequency, everything stops or implodes and I break through. Usually it's about this time that the cyclical, infinite nature of the universe is revealed to me and my mouth hangs agape. I wish I could explain it better, it makes sense in my head but there are so many bits that are just SO difficult to put into words...  I love that cosmic buzz though. It reminds me that we are all connected parts of an amazingly complex and intricate universe. Something so awesome that we can't even... Well I'll just leave it there because I cannot even."

DMT,3afwrh,KiloKebo,5,Fri Jun 19 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"DMT is generally more intense, doesn't last nearly as long, and in my experience the set and setting doesn't affect your experience as significantly as with other psychedelics although it does of course have significant impact still.  DMT may or may not help prepare you for the LSD trip. Nothing can prepare you for DMT."
DMT,3afwrh,stochastic42,3,Fri Jun 19 20:57:27 2015 UTC,"DMT makes you permanently more sensitive to psychedelics. You will probably get more out of your lsd trip if you do DMT first.. Plus if you decide you want to combine the two and dose a little DMT at the end of your acid trip, it will be another new experience and you won't have to be afraid because you have tried DMT before already."

All of my trips since discovering DMT have been on another level."
DMT,3afwrh,Molestador,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:49:21 2015 UTC,"I think that in a very general sense, all psychedelics make you more aware of the effects of psychedelics and perhaps give a better sense of what to expect or how to prepare or navigate certain aspects of trips.

DMT,3afwrh,Didymos_Black,3,Sat Jun 20 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"That's a decision you have to make. While many consider DMT to be a lot more spiritually moving that LSD, it doesn't last nearly as long."
DMT,3afwrh,coke_wizard,2,Fri Jun 19 20:43:02 2015 UTC,"They're different experiences so it doesn't particularly matter. Put a day aside for acid, though. Duration of DMT is much more friendly."
DMT,3afwrh,smokinjoe65,2,Fri Jun 19 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"DMT is far more intense but my own experience with LSD has shown me that the duration is the hard part. It's easy to have a good trip for 3 or 5 hours, it's much harder to keep that level headspace for 12 or 14.  As intense as DMT is, I would say low dose DMT before acid. That said, they are totally different highs and you should research them both extensively."

DMT,3acjpt,munkomanko,7,Fri Jun 19 12:03:18 2015 UTC,"So, my highest dose was around 8g dried (or 70g fresh on another occasion depending on your opinion of the efficacy of fresh vs. dried).  I don't know how I'd feel about using anything aside from cannabis during a shroom trip.  The shroom spirits have indicated to me that the two are paired.  And cannabis caused me to blast off the first time I used it during the peak of a trip and my experience was very similar to what people have described of DMT experiences."
DMT,3acjpt,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,7,Fri Jun 19 02:04:20 2015 UTC,shrooms and DMT are chemically extremely similar - i've read mannny reports describing their synergy
DMT,3acjpt,Didymos_Black,2,Fri Jun 19 03:06:11 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine downing 70g of shrooms, even fresh. I would be scared of that dosage just since I've never been exposed to numbers for fresh shrooms before."
DMT,3acjpt,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,2,Fri Jun 19 08:48:14 2015 UTC,"It was a chore, but I've learned that a little soy sauce, olive oil, red pepper and salt make that many mushrooms a snap.  ALso, I was on cymbalta at the time, so my reaction was somewhat deadened.  Still a helluva trip."

DMT,3acjpt,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,2,Fri Jun 19 20:32:49 2015 UTC,"Before I ate that monster amount, I did the math.  You multiply the gram weight by .075 (some people say .09, but my before and after showed .75 to be accurate) and then you have the dry weight.  So that is 5.25g dry, which is less than 8, but may actually be more potent because they are fresh.  I don't know.  I haven't had two trips the same yet."

DMT,3acjpt,Ilovetoflyhigh,2,Fri Jun 19 12:04:48 2015 UTC,"I have only done DMT once or twice by itself, I almost always drop acid before and smoke when things even out and I just wanna have fun tripping my face off. But, as always, we are not the same person and things will effect us differently so you gotta figure out if you're comfortable going to that extreme. I personally don't do less than an 8th of shrooms when I do them so IMO if you do that and then after an hour or two when the physical side of things subsides and you're just feeling good go ahead and take a hit of the DMT. To concisely answer your question it is fine to do both, but it is a leap and you gotta be prepared for it. It's my understanding that the leaps you take are the things that will have the most profound effects, so if you're at least comfortable with the idea of the leap you'll more than likely come out on the other side very grateful you jumped."
DMT,3acjpt,middlegray,2,Fri Jun 19 04:39:20 2015 UTC,"I find being in the psychedelic mindset (tripping) really helps with the anxieties usually have before dosing DMT. They synergize wonderfully as if they were made for eachother.   I say go for it, however I recommend a smaller than usual dose. It doesn't take much to get the full effect. Also expect the trip to last 15-20 minutes instead of the usual 5-10."

I'm gonna say this meditate before doing it or else you will be sorry. The most intense breakthrough ive had so far. It makes the peak last 3x as long but once your back the shrooms seem like childs play imo.  Definitely worth a try though
DMT,3acjpt,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,4,Fri Jun 19 17:19:39 2015 UTC,"No advice, but wanted to say: if shrooms + acid is called ""hippie flipping""; MDMA/acid ""candy flipping""; shrooms + acid + MDMA is ""Jedi flipping,"" etc., then I propose DMT and acid be called ""galactic flipping,"" and shrooms and DMT be known as ""alien flipping."""
DMT,3acjpt,middlegray,6,Fri Jun 19 03:23:38 2015 UTC,"You, like me, have learned of hippie flipping as shrooms and acid. I regret to inform you that the prevailing meaning of that term refers to shrooms and molly (I believe)."

DMT,3acjpt,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,3,Fri Jun 19 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"Still though, acid is much more closely associated with the hippies of the 1960s than MDMA or MDA. Shrooms and Molly being the ""hippie flipping"" combo just doesn't make sense to me."
DMT,3acjpt,GetBenttt,3,Fri Jun 19 15:24:52 2015 UTC,"Me neither.  Honestly, even hearing these silly names for drug combos makes me cringe a little.  Mostly because kids in highschool would always use them to try and sound cool and impress others.  Not the light I like to see shining on psychedelics."
DMT,3acjpt,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:28:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I use the terms just because it's easier to say ""I candyflipped"" than ""I did acid and MDMA"", and it also emphasizes that the candyflip is more than just the sum of the acid and the MDMA - it takes on its own trip."
DMT,3acjpt,xeyve,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:41:40 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you. I learned it as acid and shrooms and in the frame of reference of hippies that makes way more sense to me. But apparently that's not the widespread definition
DMT,3acjpt,GetBenttt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:46:59 2015 UTC,I'm guessing more based on the Shrooms which seem more hippie like and strange
DMT,3acjpt,middlegray,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:10:09 2015 UTC,My point is that acid is usually associated with the hippies of the 1960s whereas MDMA was not synthesized or used commonly until many years later. The term being used to describe the use of MDMA and shrooms makes zero sense while using it to mean acid and shrooms makes perfect sense.
DMT,3acjpt,Biff_Tannen___,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:15:31 2015 UTC,The term flipping refer to combining MDMA to a psychedelic drug.

DMT,3a926x,i_amnot_anyone,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:21:21 2015 UTC,Which tek did you try? Is the product wasted now?
DMT,3a926x,i_amnot_anyone,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:04:34 2015 UTC,"Tek? We used a slow cooker, some bottles, our pots, and standard bark. It's not ruined after some research we realized we made changa instead. It still works though, I promise. Haha. It's like dmt dabs."
DMT,3a9jej,omega0male,4,Thu Jun 18 08:29:40 2015 UTC,"Im glad you had a great time. I however disagree about HAVING to ""let go"". Get enough dmt in you and you no longer have a choice, it just takes you :)"
DMT,3a9jej,LamboPI,2,Thu Jun 18 08:53:31 2015 UTC,I'll keep that in mind. I do plan on upping the dose next time to be fair.
DMT,3a9jej,LamboPI,3,Thu Jun 18 09:50:26 2015 UTC,Its not so much the dose as the method. If vaped properly 30mg is plenty enough to take you into hyperspace.
DMT,3a9jej,stochastic42,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:02:15 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, I have been struggling with the method. I've tried a good amount of ways now. But I migh try the vaping method next time."
DMT,3a9jej,RedSteppa,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:28:05 2015 UTC,I was thinking the exact same thing haha...  Yeah glad it worked out for you OP.
DMT,3a9skm,pengleberry,2,Thu Jun 18 10:43:51 2015 UTC,Odd... taking any medication that might block the effects? I started out snorting and only needed 50-75mg for a POWERFUL experience.
DMT,3a9skm,smokinjoe65,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:48:14 2015 UTC,"nothing, I have no idea why... I felt a lot of mucous after snorting it, could that have affected it? although I would think that would be the body's natural reaction to that much foreign material in your nose... so disappointed :("
DMT,3a9skm,smokinjoe65,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:20:01 2015 UTC,"When I snorted (it was the only way I used to do it) I learned to not sniffle at all after snorting it in, even if there was a drip. I'd just swallow the drip but I wouldn't sniffle. Working with the discomfort is a big part of snorting DMT successfully. Did you keep your eyes open? Was the discomfort too distracting? With that much I'd say you had to have seen at least some wicked CEVs. Is it possible your stuff is fake, or did you make it?"
DMT,3a9skm,RedSteppa,2,Thu Jun 18 11:37:52 2015 UTC,Do you know if your DMT is good or if it is DMT at all?
DMT,3a9skm,RedSteppa,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:52:54 2015 UTC,100mg should at least do something.
DMT,3a9skm,rulinus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:47:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly all I got was a lethargic feeling, sortof like being stoned, no visuals unless I tried hard to see some thing but that could have been placebo, no idea"
DMT,3a9skm,xeyve,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:18:19 2015 UTC,Why do you snort the spice like a stimulant anyway? Very odd. Vaporising is way to go.

DMT,3a9rqa,stochastic42,2,Tue Jul 7 08:25:38 2015 UTC,Everything in this subreddit is hypothetical anyway... are they going to bust down a few hundred doors to bust some people who may or may not be associated with a harmless compound?
DMT,3a9rqa,sozket,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:47:08 2015 UTC,"I would get MHRB instead of ACRB if you can. You get a much cleaner product, works the same tho."
DMT,3a9rqa,stochastic42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:12:41 2015 UTC,Actually with ACRB you can use CO2 to get rid of all the excess NMT and get pretty pure DMT
DMT,3a7vch,JamesP09,14,Wed Jun 17 22:32:48 2015 UTC,"Dont use benzos or alcohol, DMT is only scary right before takeoff, I got pretty anxious after inhalation, then I thought ""can't get it out now just let it go"" and wham! Hyperspace. Thing is, when youre out there you dont have a body to be scared with, and when you land you feel awesome.  TL;DR: Smoke it, don't worry."
DMT,3a7vch,Fantact,9,Wed Jun 17 22:51:09 2015 UTC,Don't use other substances to calm your nerves. You want to go in clear headed. When you reach hyperspace you'll forget the feelings you had before arriving.
DMT,3a7vch,smokinjoe65,6,Wed Jun 17 23:06:14 2015 UTC,"I strongly recommend against using any other drugs before DMT besides possibly cannabis. Doing it while already tripping on something else can be ok too if you're prepared (shrooms, LSD, mescaline etc.)  There is no anxiety during the trip, as if you break through there's simply no 'you' left to be anxious. It can be annoying before the trip though. I've smoked it dozens of times, broken through probably 30-40 times, and even still I get very very nervous right before. Positive affirmations help ('i'm going to have a great time, and if not it'll be over soon' 'i'm ready and excited to do this' 'i'm going to learn a lot, i want to do this'). Some meditation or deep breathing beforehand can help for sure. And no, being calmed beforehand can only be positive.   Some people like to titrate their first doses (go up in small increments to get used to it). I recommend against this. If you want, I would say that at most you should do ONE sub-breakthrough dose just to get a little feel for it. After that, or even for your first time, I recommend going balls deep. Pack more DMT than you could possibly inhale, then pack a little more (depends on the way you're doing it - oil pipe will need less than gravity bong).   If any of that was unclear or you have questions, please ask. I'm glad to answer anything I can."
DMT,3a7vch,Interversity,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:56:13 2015 UTC,"Why do you recommend only one sub breakthrough dose? And why do you recommend taking so much?  Btw, I love the idea of the affirmations. Definitely going to do that."
DMT,3a7vch,hazytimez,2,Thu Jun 18 15:11:23 2015 UTC,"I believe that sub breakthrough doses are more unpleasant experiences than breakthroughs. I find that not breaking through is almost like not being able to sneeze. The breakthrough feeling of your mind just dissolving into the stars is the goal every time for me. Dosing more than you can possibly ingest is the way to go as it practically ensures a breakthrough if you don't fuck it up hugely. I tend to use a gravity bong for DMT, and if I pack a lot I can take one, maybe two hits and be sure I'm going to be destroyed."
DMT,3a7vch,Interversity,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:30:13 2015 UTC,Very nice! I appreciate the advice and will definitely take it into consideration :)
DMT,3a7vch,hazytimez,4,Thu Jun 18 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"I was verrrry anxious before my first few DMT trips - it's truly only your fear of the unknown; as has been mentioned, once you inhale and begin the journey you will be overwhelmed by far greater and magnificent sensations. You may find your anxiety dispelled for a while, too."
DMT,3a7vch,Rolling_Kimura,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:56:35 2015 UTC,"Starting with a small dose is good because you will be familiar with the sensations and early experiences of a large dose, but other than that it doesn't really prepare you.  Meditating first can help a lot.  If you remember that you aren't going to die (most common cause of anxiety during trip seems to be fear that you are dying or have died) and also that it's only going to last a few minutes you are about as prepared as you can be.  If you want to overcome your fear and anxiety then go into it with confidence and intention to do so. If you are fine with letting anxiety run your life then do not."
DMT,3a7vch,stochastic42,0,Fri Jun 19 08:03:48 2015 UTC,"A little bit of alcohol is fine, you don't want to be noticeably buzzed though, two drinks should be the max, if you smoke weed smoke some weed beforehand, the anxiety of coming up might make you lose it depending on how bad your problem is but in the end the chances of you having a negative experience due to your anxiety are quite slim, just breathe, remember your physical being will not be hurt (if you can remember you physically exist) and relax, let the experience take you, you will be greatly confounded and rewarded"
DMT,3a5hv1,smokinjoe65,20,Wed Jun 17 11:34:49 2015 UTC,"I definitely jive with what you're saying. Personally, I don't ascribe to the whole ""it's just neurons misfiring in your brain"" idea. I think drugs like this tune us in to something more, something we don't (or indeed, can't) understand. I know many people disagree and I respect their opinions. There's no fact to back up my views, just feeling. That cosmic hum that I always get while blasting off and my previous experiences with DMT in particular have made me a pretty firm believer in that other realm as something real and briefly tangible through chemical-brain interactions.  I think you are exactly right that we are not ""programmed"" to be able to process the information we see there fully. We seem to be 3 dimensional creatures thrust into this utterly alien space where the dimensions we are used to are flipped upside down and impossibly twisted in a thousand myriad ways. I believe it is important to experience this and try (as daunting and impossible as it may seem) to understand and remember as much as we can. With enough practice, maybe something incredible will click and while it may not be the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, maybe it will be something that will help me to improve the lives of myself and the people around me.   I'm sure some of you will read this and scoff and write me off as a nutjob, but so be it. I know my views are out there and not supported by any facts whatsoever. It all may be my imagination going wild, but so be it. These ideas inspire me and bring a smile to my face and I hope maybe they do the same for someone else out there :)"
DMT,3a5hv1,dmtpsychonaut,3,Wed Jun 17 15:04:29 2015 UTC,God... what a nut job... :) just kidding. It all boils down to the fact that we create the reality we live in and things that bring us happiness are just as real as anything else in our lives.
DMT,3a5hv1,AlwaysBeNice,3,Wed Jun 17 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"Highly controversial indeed though I agree, I would almost say I know so because of some dream I had.  Either way, the easiest way to test this for yourself is to breakthrough simultaneously with a friend (perhaps with the intention?) of having a shared experience that you then later could confirm with each other."
DMT,3a5hv1,Highassdude,3,Wed Jun 17 19:45:11 2015 UTC,"I think that, like dreaming, there is a part of you that innately knows this place, the beings, the language, etc. Maybe In the same way the subconscious mind feeds us subjectively relevant experiences we subconsciously know we need/want while we dream; DMT and the beings in hyperspace feed us  information. The same language that our subconscious thinks in, the language dna and cells communicate to each other with, the language plants speak, that physics and sacred geometry speaks...I think that's the language DMT communicates to us in. The ego and the conscious mind aren't meant or made to conceive of that unfiltered universal language. Some does seem to get translated though. I credit that to whatever part of our brain that let's us interpret sequential stories and meaning from the chaotic spillage of repressed thoughts and feelings that are dreams. Who knows though? Certainly not me. The entire spiritual/supernatural/entiredimensional phenomena experience could be an irrelevant chemical reaction in our bodies, and a big fat cosmic joke."
DMT,3a5hv1,j4x0l4n73rn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:56:02 2015 UTC,"I have more reservations about certain aspects of what you and many others say than about dimensional communication as a whole. It's very self-centric to assume that any hypothetical dimensional beings we see in hyperspace are communicating at us in the first place. They might not know we're even tuned in. We have no way of knowing if we are tuned into a stream of actual information or just a static channel, like on tvs. Even if we could translate what we experience into a three dimensional message, it would probably still be incomprehensible. They would have a completely different frame of reference from us.   It is a similar dilemma to Wittgenstein's proposal that if a lion could speak, we still wouldn't be able to understand him. Even if a being was speaking directly at me with a message about my life, I could translate the information into our dimension, and THAT information into English, it might turn out something like, ""Shave banana banana banana, riiiiptide! Church bells in defiance, shrimp boat.""  Maybe it'd translate into physical sensation or emotion. The message might be the sense of satisfaction one gets from caring for a pet properly so that it has lived a full life followed swiftly by hunger followed twenty years later by the feeling you used to get when you got in trouble at school and you could feel your stomach drop with fear and guilt followed by the smell of hair burning. Or it would translate most closely into the exact experience of breaking through during a dmt trip."
DMT,3a5hv1,eugenia_loli,2,Wed Jun 17 21:19:37 2015 UTC,"It's very self-centric to assume that any hypothetical dimensional beings we see in hyperspace are communicating at us in the first place.   Actually, a whole lot (if not most) of the DMT reports involving beings I've read, the beings ""expected"" the human to arrive there. Many times, they said so clearly. So if a tripper is ""sensing"" communication, there's possibly some communication going on."
DMT,3a5hv1,RedSteppa,3,Thu Jun 18 00:02:52 2015 UTC,I'd like to hear what you folks have to say about it.   Personally...not too much. But I bet you'll enjoy reading Psychedelic information theory by james kent
DMT,3a5hv1,EvolutionTheory,3,Wed Jun 17 14:20:52 2015 UTC,"Just like within dreams, I believe the visuals within the dmt experience are symbolic.

DMT,3a6qca,sozket,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:50:19 2015 UTC,My first two experiences with DMT was with dabbing it.  I like the method a lot but still find that the best way for me is using an oil burner (meth pipe) to blast off.  However I personally feel a little weird blasting off the with pipe so I actually just purchased a rig for blasting off.
DMT,3a6qca,Thirdeyebjj,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:00:11 2015 UTC,How much spice do you use when dabbing to breakthrough?
DMT,3a6qca,gph0ne,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:24:20 2015 UTC,I've done it that way with good results. It's just a lot of setup for me between heating the nail and dropping the spice on and putting down the rig carefully. I prefer the ease of packing a fat bowl of e-leaf and finishing it over the course of 6-7 trips.

DMT,3a4dzc,tqYAOU3KTz,4,Wed Jun 17 03:30:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, writer of that tek here. To clarify, you add the vinegar to the d-limonene, in order to salt out the DMT, changing it from a freebase to an acetate salt. You then pour off the vinegar once its fully saturated with dmt and not absorbing anymore/changing color, and then add new vinegar until it won't absorb any more dmt/ won't change color anymore. (repeating the process) That should only take 1 or 2 washes.  I'll update the article and fix that error. Thanks for the inquiry!"

DMT,3a4dzc,cocoanatta,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:57:29 2015 UTC,Sorry to disturb you again but I still have a weird issue. Are you sure it's only 150ml of D-limonene? I put 100g of powedered ACRB + 100g Sodium carbonate + 150ml D-Limonene in a jar. But I can't imagine anything could separate after 24 hours. It just looks like mud in there. It's not sufficiently liquid. Do I need to add water or anything?
DMT,3a4dzc,tomdavesy,2,Wed Jul 1 09:55:37 2015 UTC,"Just add more d-limonene, it also has alot to do with the size of your jar in terms of volume. Let me know how everything goes. cheers!"
DMT,3a4dzc,cocoanatta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:19:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. Not familiar with this tek, but many other teks call for a agitation/separation of 4-5 times so maybe this means add more d-limonene, shake/agitate,  then pour off. Sorry if my info is useless I've only used an A/B ACRB extraction with a mini A/B before the last pulls to ensure purity of the product.  Edit: how clear is your vinegar solution Atm? I'm assuming the d-Limonene is polarizing the impurities and the dmt is being converted and staying in its acetate form in the vinegar solution.  Edit 2: on further consideration this seems similar to doing  a mini A/B with the initial naphtha pulls leaving any unwanted impurity in the acid solution suspended in naphtha, except backwards in a way. You're dmt is being suspended in your vinegar solution and you're using the d-limonene to further purify your soution. Interesting tek."
DMT,3a3llc,Strappedforcash,5,Tue Jun 16 23:28:29 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a hypoglycemic episode due to low blood sugar, probably because you hadn't eaten in so long. Not sure if the smoking was related or not, but it may have just complicated things and added to the panic."

DMT,3a21ca,dmtdmtdmt111,5,Tue Jun 16 16:49:04 2015 UTC,"I did this last week actually and literally all you do is make sure you know what you're doing with e cigs, you need to use a rebuildable dripping atomizer running a sub-ohm setup so if you are not familiar with RDA's and especially sub-ohming go familiarize yourself PLEASE! that's the hard part and you can blow your face up  (highly unlikely especially in this application but there is risk involved in this type of e-cig) now on to the part you want to hear,   Use a ratio of 1g/10mL DMT/propylene glycol, just heat and mix one gram of DMT in ten milliliters of PG, that's it, just make sure it dissolves completely, it will, if not add a few drops of everclear, now you've got your juice, you should flavor it though, definitely flavor it because this method makes you taste the full flavor of DMT all over your tongue and mouth, and if any juice gets in your mouth it burns like ever loving shit, those two reasons alone have put this experiment off for me completely, I'll likely re-visit it when I feel like flavoring it, it does get the job done though, I use a Rampage RDA running a three twisted 28g 5 wrap build at .21 ohms, this sits on top of an IPV4 box mod running at 75 watts, so yes the technology has caught up, my mod even has temperature control haha, I have to say this can be an incredibly viable method of inhalation as it is potent enough and it's very very easy to just have to press a button and inhale rather than using a lighter/blowtorch and pipe/bong/meth pipe, the only problem with this is if it spits in your mouth and the flavor, and having to know what you're doing with RDA's and sub-ohming before you do this but probably very rewarding, for me I'll stick to enhanced leaf and the bong though ;p"
DMT,3a21ca,sozket,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"Just a question, why do I need a rebuildable atomizer and need the ohm and RDA knowledge? Could I not just make the liquid, then drip it in my eliquid atomizer?"
DMT,3a21ca,r4cid,2,Tue Jun 16 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"Don't let me stop you from trying because you really could, but it's my understanding that only a rebuildable can produce enough vapor to successfully blast off within a few hits, if you've ever tried to vaporize 50mg in one hit it's a big hit, I own an Aspire Atlantis 2 non-rebuildable tank that produces very good clouds but the way the coil is wicked concerns me about it clogging quickly as the DMT builds up in the wick, I've noticed that even with my regular e-juice the end of the tank isn't very 'fresh' so to speak, all my friends love the e-juice so they'll probably push me to perfecting it, in the meantime go for it yourself! I'm sure there is a tank that you could just fill and go, I'm no expert in either of these subjects, but rebuildables seem the most promising for getting it done fast and effectively"
DMT,3a21ca,sozket,2,Tue Jun 16 21:56:12 2015 UTC,"The knowledge of sub-ohming doesn't need to go farther than the safety concerns, and RDA knowledge is necessary so you can get the project done"

DMT,3a21ca,r4cid,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:27:58 2015 UTC,Jep. To me it didn't really feel different to changa.
DMT,3a21ca,RedSteppa,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:29:16 2015 UTC,Does it NEED to be PG? Or can I mix it in with e-juice used when vaping normally?
DMT,3a21ca,gph0ne,2,Wed Jun 17 03:19:46 2015 UTC,you could probably use normal ejuice but just get a 100% PG blend instead of VG. if you have the option
DMT,3a21ca,D-M-T,2,Wed Jun 17 03:58:22 2015 UTC,I chose PG for infusing drugs because it is a thin liquid that flows quickly
DMT,3a21ca,sozket,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"I use 1g/1ml, that works just fine, 1g/10ml seems quite weak. Just dip the container in hot water to dissolve it completely."

DMT,3a21ca,sozket,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:42:03 2015 UTC,"I used a Nautilus Mini, 2 seven second draws gave me some intense visuals. Those 2 hits were probably around 30-40mg total."
DMT,3a21ca,HandMePsychedelics,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:21:19 2015 UTC,Did the nautilus ever have issues with clogging? Or did it handle the dmt pretty well
DMT,3a21ca,sozket,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:42:17 2015 UTC,Only used it twice after filling it with DMT but it worked just fine both those times. The DMT dissolves completely into a clear liquid and shouldn't cause any problems.
DMT,3a21ca,HandMePsychedelics,0,Sat Jun 20 11:11:49 2015 UTC,I take about 1ml of 96% Ethanol. Dissolve as much DMT in it as possible. It holds A LOT.   Then I fill this in a clearomizer which looks like this  Before starting a session I use 25mg harmine freebase sublingual...wait a few minutes until I can feel the harmine doing it's thing.   Then I can go as deep as I want. Next time I will try this method with low doses during sex. Bet this will be quite an experience.
DMT,3a4cff,gph0ne,2,Wed Jun 17 03:16:43 2015 UTC,"For me the sandwich method works well, so long as you don't burn the DMT. I just use a small plastic bong and sandwich it with layers of parsley. People have said to use a thin layer of parsley, but I use more to make sure I don't put the flame directly on the DMT. Give the top layer a quick lick of the flame and then start inhaling as the parsley burns.  I personally would not smoke DMT without using a mg scale. I don't think I could eyeball the dose I would want and it would be easy to be 10mg off the mark, which can make a lot of difference.  To make a breakthrough more likely, which I have found difficult to do, make sure you finish all the DMT. After the 2nd/3rd hit it may be coming on strong, but so long as you are physically able to, take one last big hit, close your eyes, lie back and exhale. Also, hold the hits in for like 10 seconds. Sometimes I have exhaled too quickly because I want to make sure I finish it all or am afraid of it getting too intense. But hold it in."
DMT,3a4cff,samwoolfe1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:34:44 2015 UTC,"awesome, thanks a ton."
DMT,3a4cff,Thirdeyebjj,2,Wed Jun 17 19:42:53 2015 UTC,Personally for a method recently I've been smoking it out of an oil burner (crack pipe). It's a bit sketchy buying the pipe but I've had great success with this method. There's also a great video on YouTube on how to use this method. As for dosage I haven't used a lot at all for this method and have blasted off every time.
DMT,3a4cff,Abracadankbruh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"1) Absolutely, get this one: http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-GEMINI-20-Portable-MilliGram/dp/B0012TDNAM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1434511487&sr=8-1&keywords=milligram+scale  2) GVG - form a small wad of chore boy copper scrubber (walgreens) into a flat disc small enough to not touch the sides of the glass and not too compact to prevent airflow. Melt the DMT on to the scrubber by heating it first and dropping the DMT on top. Load it and vape like you would herb using a torch lighter, I recommend the Jobon ZB-529 because it has a large but soft clean burning flame and a large tank.  3) I have and always will use my method. 30 mg is my dose, the sandwich method may need more due to pyrolysis."
DMT,3a4cff,tomdavesy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:29:15 2015 UTC,"I'm currently using the sandwhich method with my friend bongy-bong. Works like a charm as I am able to pull and milk huge hits, and take them considerably. It's the only method I have at hand that ensures my experience. I assume one could do this with any herb pipe/device although a bong allows for the biggest hits so anything less would be uncivilized(aka a bowl or small pipe although I'm sure it would work to some degree)"
DMT,3a4cff,tomdavesy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:26:25 2015 UTC,"Do you use bud to sandwich it? If not, what do you use personally?"
DMT,3a4cff,smokinjoe65,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:33:41 2015 UTC,"I use ash from cigarettes, although I've quit recently so typically any ash will do. And bud will work as well but I find you want anything you're sandwiching it with to be at least half burnt to ashes. Helps to cherry the dmt and pseudo vaporize it instead of burning it."
DMT,3a4cff,smokinjoe65,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:16:47 2015 UTC,"GVG is the most fail-proof method, in my opinion. For me, it's always a one hit breakthrough and the efficiency is unrivaled (I've had consistent breakthroughs on 15-20mg). I'd say it's a good investment if you're serious about regular DMT use."

One of these three was a former monastic who had a meditation-induced mystical experience, but the other two â one of whom had absolutely no reaction to DMT â were otherwise ostensibly unremarkable in their background, experiences, and personal characteristics.

DMT,39znuv,EvolutionTheory,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:30:09 2015 UTC,I love dmt on acid. But before you do that I think you need to adjust your method of taking dmt as it is obviously not working and it's not just going to magically start doing so once you are on acid.
DMT,39znuv,only_spoons,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:32:49 2015 UTC,yes man search my post history for a little count on what happened when I did it
DMT,39znuv,RangerRandyFord,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:57:22 2015 UTC,I found that I had an extremely vivid experience when I did DMT on acid.  Took 5 hits of acid about 5 hours before the experience.  You'll find that navigating and remembering the DMT space is a lot easier.
DMT,39znuv,Levo75,0,Thu Jun 25 14:59:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend breaking through on acid. With a strong enough experience (without acid) you'll already be shaken up enough to the point where you dont know if you belong to one reality or the other. I feel that you'd have a terrifying trip having zero experience with DMT. It isn't like other psychedelics.
DMT,39znuv,smokinjoe65,2,Tue Jun 16 02:58:20 2015 UTC,"i have yet to break through still, having immense problems."
DMT,39znuv,deepspace2015,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:59:39 2015 UTC,Gpen works bro.  If your getting vapor out of it and nothing is happening then you've got bum product.  Sometimes the vapor off a gpen isn't even visible when your not hitting hard but it still tears your world up.

DMT,39znuv,TheHighestEagle,0,Tue Jun 16 18:12:28 2015 UTC,fuck man that would be crazy.   wouldn't want to be tripping my first time breaking though. I feel like I only remembered certain things because I made a sober conscious effort to. you could be different though.
DMT,3a0nvb,xdyldo,3,Tue Jun 16 08:34:40 2015 UTC,"This is copied and pasted from an older post by /u/imgodnigga  How To Breakthrough With Your Freebase Pipe  I have seen a lot of questions in this sub asking about a good technique for using a freebase pipe with DMT in order to breakthrough. So, I decided to put some time into this post for all you wonderful people! To the regulars of this sub, feel free to save this post and link this to anyone who asks about it in the future. Here it is! Please read through all of it.  What you need: DMT, freebase pipe, Scale, Bic lighter, and wet rag  -DMT: If you donât know any people that can get you some look into the darknetmarket  -Freebase pipe: This is the cheapest way to reliably breakthrough 100% of the time. If you have trouble obtaining a freebase pipe you can always buy one online. I bought mine from a gas station on the bad part of town by asking for a ârose pedalâ, they are kept behind the counter. Freebase pipes might also be known as a âoil pipeâ or a âmeth/crack pipeâ.  -Scale: Get a scale if you donât already have one. It is easy to put to much in the pipe and either waste or use way to much.  -Bic lighter: You donât need a jet lighter just a regular Bic lighter will work. The only thing a jet lighter will do is heat up the bulb way to fast and burn some. Remember with Bic lighters you donât want to keep the flame going for more than 30 seconds otherwise you will end up burning yourself on the flint piece.  -Wet rag: Keep a wet rage near by to place the pipe on after you are done. This is a good habit to make so that he pipe will cool off faster, none of your DMT is wasted while you are in space, you don't burn yourself, and the pipe wont roll away and spill.  Once you have acquired everything go ahead a prepare for space! Dim lights, put on music, make bedâ¦ What ever you usually do to prepare.  Smoking the DMT  -Go ahead and put whatever amount you are comfortable with the pipe, maybe a pinch extra until you get the right method down. I like using an index card folded in half to funnel the powder into the pipe.  -Now to start heating the bulb. Its gonna take a minute at least to heat it so be patient! Just hover the bulb about an inch above the flame and keep the flame rotating around the bulb. You donât want to keep the flame in one place to long because it will unevenly heat the DMT and end up burning some. While doing this slowly rotating the bulb side to side with which ever hand you are holding it with(like a rolling motion). The idea is to evenly heat the bulb slowly.  -Eventually you will start to notice the DMT turning to a liquid. It should take a solid minute to get it like this. The liquid might be clear or brown depending on the purity of your DMT. You will notice a little vapor escaping through the carb of the pipe. Donât be alarmed this is water vapor the DMT vapor will be a lot more milky looking.  -Once your DMT is all heated up and in liquid form keep heating it up for about 10 seconds more  -Put down the lighter and hit the pipe! You should be able to take one big hit and blast off successfully. If not don't be afraid to take another the pipe will still be hot. Now you got about 15 seconds more seconds in reality to put the pipe down on the wet rag  Congratulations! Youâre in space! Happy travels! :)  For me it took a maybe 2-3 times before I got the method down. Hopefully you can get it on your first try now though.  Source: Myself and experience. I have always used a freebase pipe to breakthrough."
DMT,3a0nvb,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:27:27 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks, just scared I will burn the DMT, also will all the liquid disappear once i have inhaled or what, should there be nothing left in the pipe. And if I don't breakthrough the first time, how long should I wait before trying again?"
DMT,3a0nvb,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:06:16 2015 UTC,"I've personally never used a freebase pipe but you want to inhale the entire dose or as much as you can. As far as tolerance goes, you can try again in as little as half an hour."

Pop some ear buds in, get some relaxing tunes (I don't like lyrics with DMT ) and settle down for 10 or 15 minutes. When you feel calm and your breathing/heartbeat is slow, go for the breakthrough. Just let go completely :) whatever you see or feel, be happy about it and forget yourself and everything around you. It's a beautiful experience.   Good luck, be safe and have fun!"

DMT,39t6dr,sozket,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"I've done it over 100 times, and I'm still anxious as fuck, OP. But DMT is entirely friendly and a zillion times over amazing. If you're not ready for a breakthrough, then you'll have a pleasant milder experience. You'll get whatever you're ready for.  Remember to take HUGE hits and hold them in for like eight to ten seconds.  Meditate a little beforehand. And enjoy it- it's wildly fun."

I went ahead with the plan but unfortunately, I didn't break through again! My first toke was a really big one and things started melting around. I wanted to take one more good toke but I kinda hurried through this and ended up not lighting properly. Nevertheless, I saw chrysanthemum and tripped for a few minutes. It's a little frustrating though. Now I've run out of spice and have to try to extract it!"
DMT,39t6dr,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:02:47 2015 UTC,"Extracting yourself is definitely the way to go. I would recommend getting more root bark than you think you need. My first extraction was from ~250g and I ended up with more than enough to get the swing of things. I've done a couple extractions since then just for fun and to try and perfect the process and I've never come close to running out. And since I have such an excess of product, I can share it freely with any of my friends who express interest. There's few better feelings than giving a friend some spice and the look on their face when you refuse to accept money in return. Well, maybe when they come back from hyperspace and tell you about their experience :) Good luck, fellow traveler!!"

DMT,39sos9,yourmatetom3,2,Sun Jun 14 11:29:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're the guy who's in the video, it was definitely interesting to watch. Watched the ayahuasca video as well. Only qualms I have with it is at one point it was mentioned that western medicine doesn't know what it's doing with cancer and there are better alternatives out there. I think it's a dangerous attitude to have and people have suffered by putting their faith into things that won't work. At least with chemo, even though it's not 100% it's reliably done what it claims to do."
DMT,39sos9,Sansasaslut,2,Mon Jun 15 08:56:41 2015 UTC,"Yea this is me in the video. It was a while ago and I should have worded it better. I should have said that it is not the best option for cancer, and I really don't think chemotherapy (which kills many cells, not just cancer cells) is the best course to take. It could be the stigma attached to illnesses like cancer that contributes to more people's death, e.g., doctors telling their patients that they have 6 months to live, and the patients believing that they're going to die will definitely not help their case, as science has proven many times that a person's expectations and belief systems will affect their reality (i.e the placebo effect). Not saying that everyone with cancer should go to the jungle and drink a psychedelic brew. Sometimes something as simple as a change in mindset and diet can have profound results, but everyone is unique and has different paths they need to take. I stand by what I said about western medicine and their current model of treating mental illness though, and how it fucking sucks big time lol   That being said, this is all just my current point of view. I'm currently studying psychology and want to specialize in mental illness and psychedelics, so I still have A LOT to learn haha  But it's funny how the more knowledge you gain, the more you realize you don't know shit :P  But thanks for giving me feedback, I really appreciate it.

It can be frustrating to perfect the technique, but there are numerous methods to do it right. Check the sticky for other tips, but I recommend turning your spice into e-leaf because it's by far the easiest way I have found to reliably blast off.

You need to learn the proper techniques, both for vaping and for getting the right mindset to dive deeper (even if you think you were fully committed, you were probably distracted).

I just kept hitting it and hitting it until WOOSH! Reality was gone.  Also, to answer your opiate question, I was a habitual opiate user (oxy and heroin) a couple of times I did DMT. In smaller doses I found it muted the effect but DMT is just powerful. The experience wasn't as stunted as when I tried LSD or mushrooms on opiates. I could always break through with DMT."

DMT,39o7me,inhaleexhaleee,5,Sat Jun 13 04:30:17 2015 UTC,"First, I appreciate anyone who respects this wonderful compound. Regarding you wanting to better yourself, there's really only one thing for me to say, and that's the following: don't expect DMT to build you a new house, but be open to it as it provides the necessary tools and materials. I'm not pegging you as a person that thinks a drug will solve their problems, it's just a good thing to keep in mind.   I used to snort my DMT in sub-breakthrough doses for the meditative headspace but I learned that isn't the best way for me to do it. The full breakthrough is where I really learn about myself, my reality and what's important to me (or afterward, rather). It isn't like I come across these great revelations while I'm there, but instead it feels like it's a wild show meant to distract and entertain me while ""they"" work on me behind the scenes (it's a metaphor... I'm not saying the entities do or don't exist). When I come back from the show, the world seems different and I can approach concepts and problems in my life from new angles that I hadn't previously seen.  I say go for the big show... you had the right mindset when you let it take you deeper without too much worry or fear, which is very important. It's tantamount to allowing yourself to die and trusting that you'll be reborn in a short bit. Good luck, be safe and PLEASE don't forget to have fun :)"
DMT,39o7me,smokinjoe65,3,Sat Jun 13 05:35:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I appreciate that :) I think it's just something I'm going to have to do. Im very scared but I won't allow myself to be commanded by this fear.   I liked what you said about letting go and that's something I've been working on getting better at.  I'm hoping DMT can show me more value in letting go, because I can be a pretty obsessive person despite how much of this I have already overcome in this life. I feel if I experience it more fully (which it seems DMT can kind of force you into almost?) then it will be easier for me to live that everyday.   Anyway, I have the house to myself in 2 weeks so I think I'm going to prepare for round 2 and do my best to let go and accept where it brings me."

DMT,39o7me,Levo75,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:17:35 2015 UTC,This is not for you. The DMT realm does seem to have entities that act as bouncers. They keep out the insincere and the misdirected.
DMT,39o7me,malcomte,0,Thu Jun 25 15:31:34 2015 UTC,"Quitting weed has been really difficult for me and I realized I have been using it as a crutch and an escape - I was hoping DMT could help free me of this addiction.    I'm going to be a dick and say you can't get addicted to marijuana. And I'm going to be an even bigger dick, and tell you that addiction is a purely social construct.   DMT telling you that ""it's not for you"" is it telling you that it's not for you. You want to hold on to your flawed perception. DMT isn't a cure, or even a medicine in the Western sense. Psychedelics can only do so much for you if you can't let go. And you're trying to replace one crutch with another.  So why am I saying all of this -- because you don't get it? DMT let you off gentle, and you're still obsessed with weed. Getting high isn't your problem, it's that nagging feeling (that moral imperative) that you have to participate in the death machine. Good for you on getting a job, have you considered how your employment is contributing to the death of our species? Can you comfortably inhabit your hypocrisy and realize that any mask you were, an affect you effect, is merely a ruse? Sitting around smoking weed all day isn't terrible -- trading your life away for slips of paper is fucking terrible (I know, I do it, and I have a fairly ""meaningful"" job even though the end result is killing the planet).   I've been ""addicted"" to things. Cigarettes have been my struggle. In the end, it's always a choice for something you don't need. You use the substance (and the moral, emotional nexus you generate around the idea of the substance) to do the heavy work of existing.   Basically, it's nice to be able to blame a substance for you being a shitbag, when the reality is you are just a shitbag, regardless of your mental state. My suggestion, instead of your life revolving around you compulsion for weed, try getting some hobbies, or a girlfriend (one that gets high and trips even). Or you know, reading novels, something that will let you experience life unmediated (without screens)."
DMT,39o7me,RedSteppa,4,Sat Jun 13 05:45:20 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the feedback. I think you have an interesting perspective on dmt although I'm going to have to disagree with your stance on weed. I am not blaming the weed, but my irresponsibility with it. Yes you can't necessarily equate your self worth with not having a job or being high all day. But if I'm able to have a clearer mind, more connected relationships and more time to find said hobbies feeling freedom from weed, would it not be in my best interest to be without it? And I agree that I'm contributing to the problem of this earth by having a job! Haha. But once again, what would be better? Sitting around begging my parents for money, being homeless on the street, or working in an industry where I help other people and have the life balance to figure out a better direction where maybe one day I could make a bigger difference? I'm a cog in this death machine but how can I truly break free? I feel sometimes the best you can do is be aware and try to make the best decisions you can in the moment. And hopefully I'm someone who can help spread that awareness and better this world through connectivity with others.   Addiction really is what you make it but like you said these things are only distractions from ourself; an excuse. It's just a word with a lot of socially constructed meaning like you said but so what?  If I can live a more fulfilling life and be more connected to myself and others then would this not be in my best interest? It seems a lot of people preaching this type of stuff almost have some sort of ego about it.  I'd rather face myself fully (I guess which is why I'm interested so much in dmt and psychedelics). I do like what you said about being a shit bag too. Although I don't think it's that I'm inherently a shit bag but rather I act as one when I'm that far from myself.   I don't see DMT as another crutch either - I see it as something to help me understand myself myself at a deeper level so I can be more connected and present. I used weed as an escape. And like I said, I think weed is fucking fantastic - but I have see many users deluding themselves in their usage and I think it's important for us all to be aware of why we use these substances, and to make choices in line with our values.   Honestly, I can't help but think how much of your post is you perpetuating your ego with your ideas - I just kind of feel your aim wasn't to help me so much here. Maybe I'm wrong but either way I do appreciate the response."

Sandwhich method felt good too. Wasn't too harsh. tabacco didn't taste too bad. I tasted the DMT, but had no effects.  I'm not sure what happened with the machine and the tinfoil. I might try and get some scrubbers instead of using steel wool, but the machine hurt infintley more than the sandwhich and g-pen.  I'm going to drop some lucy tmr and ask my brian whats up.

And as someone else noted enhanced leaf is incredible as a method of smoking, simply mix up a 1:1 ratio of herb and DMT then slowly drip enough of an appropriate solvent to dissolve the dmt, mix it up once or twice then evaporate your solvent, mixing it up occasionally, make 100% sure all solvent is 100% evaporated or you'll hate yourself for it, just don't give up!

DMT,39iq1k,holycactimartyr,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:25:23 2015 UTC,I held in as much as my lung would let me all times. :(
DMT,39iq1k,doctor-girlfriend,2,Fri Jun 12 04:41:24 2015 UTC,yea that's not really telling though. For some people that is 2 seconds. I've seen people hold it in for 5 and say thats all they could do. You can always hold it in longer.
DMT,39iq1k,cautiouschemist,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:33:49 2015 UTC,Do you still feel lesser effects? And have you tried different sources of product?
DMT,39iq1k,doctor-girlfriend,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:50:30 2015 UTC,"The world feels a bit wavey, but I'm not sure if that's a placebo or actual DMT feelings.   I have a shipment of different product coming in soon. I'm not allowed to source on this sub but the first batch came from a very respectable dealer on reddit."
DMT,39iq1k,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:03:51 2015 UTC,"is that it? you might be one of the few people for whom DMT has no effect. I haven't broken through but at the very least I get some strong visuals for 5-10 minutes, most do. sorry to discourage you like that, but it's very possible it just might not happen for you. not to say that similar substances wouldn't (aya maybe?)"
DMT,39iq1k,pdht23,2,Fri Jun 12 06:11:56 2015 UTC,"I have 200mg coming in soon but i'm remaking the machine. DMT is kind of my end game, you can say. I was always...fixated about the idea of DMT. Like a dog becomes fixated with a squirrel or how gamers get fixated on a video game trailer.  It's just.. I've been kind of building of for it. Weed got me comfortable enough to do intense amounts of edibles. Intense amount of edibles got me comfortable enough to do LSD. After taking LSD, I said to myself I'm ready to do DMT. I was on a spiritual journey prior, but LSD kind of answered my question of what it was like to die, something I was so, so enthralled by the concept of it. And now, with DMT, I kind of want to finish this journey I started. I want to see what's its like to truly step into that world.  It's just mocking me. Whenever I read trip reports, or seeing videos on the DMT experience. I just feel mocked. I want to join this club of people whom I consider friends (psychonauts,you guys are really nice people), but I just feel like you've all gained knowledge and are speaking a different language when it comes to breaking through. I haven't even gotten great visuals. Nothing. Nothing to show for it. Just 60$ in DMT making supplies and 24$ in wasted DMT, and another 17$ coming in soon. Just nothing. Rubbish is  the word."
DMT,39iq1k,hashmon,3,Fri Jun 12 06:21:27 2015 UTC,You. Stop. Breathe.  Your building expectations you'll overwhelm the experience.  Meditate. Clear your mind. Clear it as completely as you can. And patience. Be sure your vaping the dmt not burning it. Burnt dmt still smokes but produces little to no effect
DMT,39iq1k,cautiouschemist,3,Fri Jun 12 13:39:14 2015 UTC,"okay, I know you really wanna do it but I don't tjink you read my comment. it might literally be incompatible with your body. this happens to 1-3% of people, maybe more. this migbt not be you but you should be open to that possibility"

DMT,39k6w7,A_Flukeball_Life,2,Fri Jun 12 08:24:17 2015 UTC,"It didn't turn bad, probably a very small amount oxidized (turned into DMT-oxide) which is very similar to DMT anyhow.  Almost always the case is that you are not smoking it properly. It may be melting and dribbling inside the bowl and re-crystalizing or burning (the smoke will be VERY harsh).  I highly recommend you use a different technique. Buy a cheap crack pipe or something."
DMT,39k6w7,stochastic42,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:49:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. DMT-oxide is actually pretty potent in its own way, which is why I don't clean out my GVG :) I'm also a firm believer that inexperienced dmt users shouldn't adulterate the experience by mixing it with other substances, like weed. Letting it grab you while you're completely baseline and learning to navigate the experience with a clear head will make future trips easier."

DMT,39gcpz,gswitzzz,6,Thu Jun 11 22:07:11 2015 UTC,Watched the first episode last night and that's what brought me to this subreddit.   I had heard of DMT through a friend years ago but had kind of stored that knowledge away.  After watching Sense8 my interest in DMT resurfaced.

DMT,39gcpz,iliketotryptamine,3,Thu Jun 11 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"I saw it a few days ago, really enjoyed the idea, and about crapped myself when they started smoking DMT.

I get my own crazy ass experience in my head."
DMT,39gcpz,cautiouschemist,2,Thu Jun 11 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"yeah I'm enjoying it so far too! Ok thanks that's good to know, just wanted to know if there was any probability behind the concept even though it's a science-fiction-y show. I really want to experience it for myself though"

DMT,39hu95,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"Snorting it will extend the effects somewhat if you don't want to go the MAOI route. You have to up the dosage a little bit and it can be rather uncomfortable on the nose, but it generally lasts longer. Closer to half an hour or so."
DMT,39hu95,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:11:14 2015 UTC,Interesting what dosage would be similar to 5-10mg vaped?
DMT,39hu95,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:33:57 2015 UTC,Maybe 15-30mg? /u/smokinjoe65 can probably help us out here. I've only ever done 50-75mg and it was right around breakthrough dose
DMT,39hu95,tomdavesy,2,Fri Jun 12 20:31:18 2015 UTC,15-30mg would do it. I stuck around 45-50mg for strong visuals without a breakthrough but I think I'm pretty succeptible to psychedelics.
DMT,39hu95,tomdavesy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:28:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your research. These are fun and exciting times! I smoked  anywhere from 5 to 20 milligrams every  day or two for atleast a month. I love the feeling. Never heard microdosing DMT before but silly me for ruling it out. Speaking of micro I just took a little under half a tab, excited to boost my evening with some clarity."
DMT,39hu95,TheReplierBRO,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:40:09 2015 UTC,"Yes indeed! Never heard of a DMT tab though, but yes microdosing it is great, I don't even need to trip to feel an improvement on mood and clarity. It's also great for coming down off of stims and has anxiolytic properties. The only problem is that its too short, redosing poses a bit of inconvenience."
DMT,39hu95,tomdavesy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah Im talkin/takin a piece of LSD. But I feel I'll head into mocrodosing, naturally."

DMT,39eq1x,helloworldalex,2,Thu Jun 11 06:03:18 2015 UTC,"Tolerance isn't an issue. When I do it, I do it in sessions of 3 trips, separated by ~30 minutes. Also, sensitivity most likely won't be dictated by how much DMT is in your brain (we don't even know when exactly the DMT is active during the day, or if it's even a significant amount ).  Some people have a more psychedelic mind that makes breakthrough succeptibility extremely low. I break through on very low doses (15-25mg vaporized, 50mg snorted) but I attribute it to my ability/willingness to dive deeper into the experience and let go more fully."

DMT,39eq1x,dys0n89,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:10:02 2015 UTC,Tolerance won't be an issue. Keep practicing your technique for vaping and ensure the DMT is not leaking through the screens in your pipe.

He mentioned he wanted to try floating with someone else.  I was confused but moved on in the conversation as I didn't want to stop him from sharing anything he could.  It wasn't until later I realized he meant two people floating at the same time in two very different locations and seeing if their consciousness could connect.  He might agree with your theory.

DMT,39dtdp,stochastic42,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:07:17 2015 UTC,What i don't get is;  You put the dmt in the steel wool but how doesn't it fall in the bottle and stays in the wool?
DMT,39cvr2,sircatnips,4,Wed Jun 10 22:29:17 2015 UTC,"Try it again, I suggest a beautiful day secluded in nature. The most important thing is to have a great deal of respect for dmt, it's an extremely powerful experience to put your concioussness through."
DMT,39cvr2,Ronbomb,3,Wed Jun 10 23:11:52 2015 UTC,"As dramatic as it may sound, you can't be afraid of dying. Many times I thought I was dying during my earliest trips, but once I realized ""dying"" wasn't something to be afraid of, it became easier every time to let go and allow the DMT to carry me deeper and deeper. Don't allow thoughts of control and disrespect enter your mind when you think about DMT. It has a strange way of terrifying you and putting you in your place when you lose respect and think you're in control. This isn't like LSD."
DMT,39cvr2,smokinjoe65,2,Thu Jun 11 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"I personally cannot recommend 'dabbing' dmt for beginners as IME it hits way too fast, I've been tripping before the smoke was done entering my lungs before using my dab rig, NOT fun, and you can't compare DMT to LSD much other than DMT makes people want to do LSD, definitely try putting it in with a bowl of herb (sandwich method) and going up slowly, test around at threshold doses before blasting off, so far my ABSOLUTE favorite way to inhale DMT is by mixing up 'changa', which is DMT + MAOI infused into herb but the MAOI is a different subject as well as optional, to make changa you thoroughly mix up your herb and DMT (and MAOI if you have/want it) and then drip high proof alcohol or acetone (make sure your acetone evaporates cleanly leaving no residue by pouring at least one ounce onto a glass surface and letting evaporate, if it does then toss the acetone and find another source) so that everything dissolves, let this evaporate for an hour or so stirring occasionally, after it appears to be dry let it sit for an additional 12+ hours to be sure no solvent remains, nothing quite like heading to space with acetone in the lungs! Happy and safe spice travel!"
DMT,39cvr2,sozket,2,Thu Jun 11 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"I see this is not like r/lsd where everyone sends eachother good and friendly vibes...im not sure how to gain more respect for something i cant grasp ahold of; i realize it has little to no potential for recreational use, and have even tried meditation to calm the nerves. Maybe i will eventually try again, but the feedback from other redditors is telling me to just stick with L for now. Thanks again, to all who helped! May happiness flood your days!"
DMT,39cvr2,stochastic42,2,Thu Jun 11 14:17:46 2015 UTC,"It's not supposed to be that frightening, but it can be. It's not predictable.  I think fear is always rooted in wrong perception, the fearful DMT experiences are an opportunity for me to sort out my perception and i welcome them.  I have read hundreds of DMT reports and it seems that most of them are positive experiences. Personally I would say about 30% of my trips had some element of fear, and certainly the most terrifying experience of my life was a DMT trip but that was also one of the best experiences in retrospect.   There may be places you don't want to go and things you don't want to experience, i don't know. I can't necessarily advise you to keep trying but I can say that one experience is in no way indicative of the next so just because you had a 'bad trip' doesn't mean you will continue to do so."
DMT,39cvr2,RoachPowder,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:30:37 2015 UTC,"If you really like acid, a really enjoyable way to combine the two ime is to smoke one hit of the dmt pipe while on acid. When I tried this, it made the existing LSD patterning mych more floral and intricate and some 3D floating  structures manifested in the room. Some people mighy think I'm blaspheming or something, but there isn't just one ""correct"" way to use DMT."

DMT,39cvr2,GotStomped,0,Thu Jun 11 23:02:03 2015 UTC,"I have taken up to 5 LSD tabs at once before and I have said this before and I will say it again.  LSD is to DMT as Water is to Vodka. Now before you guys start screaming thumbprints etc.. I am talking about 5 hits of LSD versus 1 pharmahuasca dose of 400mg of Harmaline and 150mg of DMT Fumarate ingested. 4hour trip  LSD always just felt synthetic to me, thoughts were not mine, lack of mental control and clarity whereas even in the presence of god I was still me and thinking perfectly on DMT."
DMT,39cvr2,heathenethan,-4,Thu Jun 11 00:46:46 2015 UTC,"I don't want ""D"" to be your ""Thang"" if this is how you talk. I really don't want people to think that DMT users are all idiots. You obviously don't respect DMT, or any drug, enough to be taking them seriously. Re-evaluate your stance and try again when you gain some maturity."
DMT,398xd5,trip_we_me,5,Wed Jun 10 02:44:31 2015 UTC,"Been said before friend; setting and mindset play a large roll in the outcome of the experience. That being said, darker environments can help with unnecessary distractions. It's surely not unheard of having rough/difficult trips. Outside stress and other factors can play a big role in the overall turnout.  Get some sleep and analyze your trip in the morning with a fresh mind."
DMT,398xd5,DreamingLucid,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:21:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm at the point now where I'm fed up with spice. I can never smoke enough to break through and it tastes so foul."

DMT,398xd5,deepspace2015,5,Wed Jun 10 05:05:38 2015 UTC,"maybe the trips are terrifying because you're just buying the shit, doesn't seem you really appreciate what you are dealing with. try putting some more effort into the experience and maybe the outcomes will be a little more in your favor. you get out what you put in and get exactly what you are supposed to.   respect it.  edit : yes harmalas can ground the experience as well as potentiate the tryptamines, i prefer to oral or sublingual harmalas before smoking changa or an enhanced leaf myself.. dmt without harmalas is meh."
DMT,398xd5,xeyve,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:12:58 2015 UTC,"I've read about vapor genie and you should try a micro g pen vape.  Maybe better breakthrough.  About your experience I've been there I know what you mean.  Leaving eyes open makes the world go nuts.  Watching your houseplants turn into beetlejuice sand worms and shit.    After your first terrifying dmt trip you need a new angle to dip back in again.  Me, I ended up being able to go back thanks to mdma and nitrous and shpongle.  Saw the most beautiful things again after that fright fest.  Happy sailing!"

DMT,398xd5,stochastic42,5,Wed Jun 10 04:47:31 2015 UTC,"One time I blasted off when I really should have been studying. The beings were almost shaming me for doing so, the whole trip had a vibe that made me feel ashamed for not doing what I should have been doing instead. I make a habit of smoking in complete silence and darkness so that I have no outside influence, set and setting IS key. Influence can and will come from your mind state at the time also."
DMT,398xd5,smokinjoe65,3,Wed Jun 10 16:35:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I have been shamed by the entities for a similar sin.
DMT,398xd5,AlwaysBeNice,3,Wed Jun 10 05:08:06 2015 UTC,"I never keep my eyes open and, after 50+ breakthrough experiences, I've yet to have one that leaves me shaken. I've had some that were overwhelming but the fear always goes away."
DMT,398xd5,dmtpsychonaut,3,Fri Jun 12 09:34:16 2015 UTC,"I actually think not identifying with thoughts, emotions, body and mind are the key to not experiencing any bad trip or anything bad in general, now I could see people simple disagreeing with this belief about our true identity but I can say that I for example can experience the most horrid nightmares and still be fine during the experience, or even see it as a positive thing when I could transcend or face something that was apparently bothering me at some level still."
DMT,398xd5,Molestador,3,Wed Jun 10 08:49:35 2015 UTC,I like your username :)
DMT,398xd5,RennHuhn,2,Wed Jun 10 10:27:06 2015 UTC,"70mg is a HUGE dose from a GVG. if you are able to take it all in one hit, a much lower dose should be able to give you the full 'out of body' breakthrough experience. it seems like there were a lot of distractions and you simply panicked, which is pretty much what causes all bad trips. try doing half that dose and working your way up 5-10mg at a time until you find your 'breakthrough' dose. it should be a lot lower than 70.  i also recommend trying it in complete darkness and total silence. there is more to having a breakthrough than just smoking a high dose. you need to be in the right mindset and free of distraction."

I would actually trust the DMT-nexus there and wait some time and try again in some weeks/months. Experiencing a hyperslap doesnt sound nice.
DMT,398xd5,samwoolfe1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:24:28 2015 UTC,"It may not be related, but why are you calling DMT ""spice""? Spice is usually referred to synthetical shit that works similar to marijuana, but it is extremely bad both for your mental and physical health. People kill themselves on it regularly, or just do nasty shit to their bodies, like scoping their eyes out with a spoon. If you confuse DMT with spice you're going to have a baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad time."
DMT,398xd5,golergka,2,Wed Jun 10 16:27:46 2015 UTC,"'Spice' is a name commonly used to refer to DMT...might have started on the Nexus?  It's taken from that line from Dune:  ""The spice extends life. The spice expands consciousness. The spice is vital to space travel."""
DMT,398xd5,dmtpsychonaut,2,Wed Jun 10 08:27:23 2015 UTC,"Dune is origin for both usages of word ""spice"" for these drugs, I'm sure. Just make sure you know what kind of ""spice"" you're talking about with person you get it from :)"
DMT,398xd5,golergka,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah for real! I generally only use the term when talking with people who are familiar with it, such as on this sub. When I talk to my friends about it I call it by its proper name."
DMT,398xd5,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:18:46 2015 UTC,"Uhm, but if you assume that someone is familiar with the term, and the person is really talking about other, but similar, drug, you will not even have a clue that he's talking about something different."
DMT,398xd5,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:07:15 2015 UTC,"I mean, this is a DMT forum. It's safe to assume that when people talk about ""vaping spice"" here that they aren't talking about synthetic marijuana or bath salts or paprika. I get what you are saying though.  I wouldn't exactly call them ""similar"" drugs though haha"
DMT,398xd5,golergka,2,Wed Jun 10 11:45:01 2015 UTC,"It's also a common slang term for n,n-DMT."

DMT,398xd5,mkjasldfkj,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:16:48 2015 UTC,"I find the fewer familiar things I have tying my perceptions to this world, the better. Tripping with my eyes open or music on makes me think about how fucked up everything looks or sounds in comparison to how it normally does. When I close my eyes and just float through the space, I'm not comparing the experience to anything and I can simply accept it for what it is."
DMT,398xd5,thoughtrationality,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:24:33 2015 UTC,"my one and only negative dmt experience happened while sitting in a computer chair.  i looked at my GVG and saw a little residue in it, figured id hit it to experience a light, enjoyable trippy effect while lounging in front of my computer (id had tiny doses before that felt like the peak of a light mushroom trip).  anyways, hit the pipe and almost immediately shit got too deep. had the ringing/tone in my ears (that for me, signals the beginning of a blastoff), and everything around me was warping and changing color and getting covered in patterns.  i held onto reality for dear fucking life because i was not in a place where id be safe if i started tripping hard (lots of shit to knock around, also my chair was half busted so the wrong move would cause me to fall off)  i didnt see any scary things per se, but the knowledge that i could lose touch with my body at any moment was frightening in that setting (whereas in my normal tripping setting, that was the goal).  luckily i persevered and never went far enough to completely lose touch....but i learned an important lesson in the process :)"

DMT,398xd5,arsenal1887,0,Wed Jun 10 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"You guys all spend way too much time smoking it. I have smoked it many times, even saw the immaculate, ever divine, awe-inspiring hand of Hamsa floating over me after smoking it. I hate smoking it, its gross sometimes you get stuck in weird dimensions etc.  NOTHING compares to 400 mg of harmaline and 150mg of DMT fumarate I took in pill form. I held the godhead for an hour (excruciatingly difficult like drinking from a firehose), I saw how this place works off of a projection from a massive ancient stonelike computer, the earth is flat you cannot project onto a sphere, sorry kids. What fed the projection was described to me as ""God's blood"" which was living glowing green light with ever changing glowing gold letters that morphed as it floated inside what looked to be a massive glass tube yet I do not think this was the only tube.  I saw how I had always existed and always will, an eternal being.  I was an atheistic, left brained scientist know it all, egotistical fuckhead before I took this, afterwards I actually care. I know NASA is bullshit the earth is flat, I have the ability now to know lies from truth no matter the subject matter or how good the con man is. I am constantly aware of everything and understand everyone around me. My psychic powers of clairsentience has dramatically increased and my life has never been better.   I see butterflies every day (weather permitting) even while travelling every week across the US. This happened before DMT (after reading the free ebook butterflies are free to fly) but it increased after this experience, my wife now sees them daily too (she took some after me). This was over two years ago and at first it was hard coming back to this reality due to all the negativity and hate we see, but it is just a small few that make it $hit for everyone and I think we all know who they are.  I have 0 want to do it again, I got the answers I needed and will wait until I die to go back (there). Now MDMA that is a different story been over a year : ( My wife can see auras and see music on MDMA, although my only power is it makes me a better dancer :/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqIZ68Vl3zc"
DMT,398xd5,youfuckingslaves,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:47:58 2015 UTC,would you recomend this to someone? apparently it shattered your reality so it must be unbelieveable at first. What let you give into these abstract concepts? How do you know it isn't just a dream?
DMT,398xd5,BuriesIt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"I was on the other side in spirit I had to let go of my body and my identity, I had to die to be reborn.

DMT,398xd5,youfuckingslaves,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:38:28 2015 UTC,"right. but isn't it both ways? like, how do you know? You seem very convinced. I'm not trying to mess up with your head, man.

DMT,397y25,tanrisgnar07,3,Tue Jun 9 22:18:21 2015 UTC,"I've had quite a few blast offs and I can't recall ever carrying emotional baggage into hyperspace. I have had trips where things were too overwhelming due to me not relaxing beforehand, but it's very difficult to concentrate on complete sentences, much less complex concepts and emotions, while in hyperspace.   I say go for it... the clarity and bliss you'll feel afterward may even put you in the state of mind you need to fix some of your problems. (NOT saying DMT fixes things... a good state of mind does)"
DMT,397y25,smokinjoe65,2,Tue Jun 9 22:40:42 2015 UTC,"cool cool i appreciate the response, i was hoping to hear something about no extra baggage.  i was hoping all of that wont even matter/make sense to me while im there or something along those lines."
DMT,397y25,smokinjoe65,3,Tue Jun 9 23:29:47 2015 UTC,"My last trip, I wanted to ask questions while I was there, but all I could say, in that place, was ""There was something I wannnnnntttttteeeedddd....."" and ""I can't rememmmmmbbbeeerr...""

Once, I had the capacity to ask a female entity, while she was showing me something, if that was where we go when we die. She stopped what she was doing, turned around and frowned at me, at which point I apologized and she continued the show."

DMT,3943j1,MerLisk116,11,Tue Jun 9 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"I would advise not to flash if you think you have schizophrenia. But I will say, that DMT cured my depression. Everyday is now beautiful. Regardless."
DMT,3943j1,OGNexus,8,Tue Jun 9 11:50:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's difficult to give you advice, since none of us know you personally or the nuances of your circumstances. I won't tell you whether it will be good or bad if you try DMT, but offer you my own experiences and thoughts.  The first time I experienced a breakthrough, I felt pretty depressed. I was at university, smoking weed every day, I was the skinniest and unhealthiest I had ever been (so much so that I was embarrassed to go out in public), and I just felt like I was festering.  I wanted to try DMT because I was curious about its effects. Now whether my depression influenced the trip, it's hard to say. But I experienced the warmest and most loving embraces by motherly entities. They told me that everything was alright, that they loved me and had always been there for me.  So far from exacerbating how terrible I felt with my life at the time, the experience was like a saving grace. I felt the most incredible euphoria and lift in mood after that experience. I believe these anti-depressant effects were short-term, but I have not forgotten the message.  I think it is worth pointing out that DMT carries some mental health risks. A traumatising trip (very unlikely) can be difficult to get over. A very intense trip could also leave one with a sense of derealisation or depersonalisation. These effects could be exacerbated by, or exacerbate, underlying mental health issues.  As others have said, it is the history of schizophrenia which is concerning. Taking psychedelics and smoking weed has been known to trigger an underlying psychosis or schizophrenia in some people. I have witnessed this in a group of people I used to hang out with. They smoked weed regularly and one of them had to be hospitalised for schizophrenia."
DMT,3943j1,samwoolfe1,11,Tue Jun 9 11:24:14 2015 UTC,"I've been diagnosted depressed, anxious, paranoid at times, I relate to your apprehension to try DMT. Without sounding like a complete idiot, you'll never know until you try. From my experience DMT will not cause schizophrenia or paranoia, anxiety, or depression. I think it offers quite the opposite. Complete oneness with nature (if outside and subbreakthrough dose) and with a high dose wherever you are, I sncerely do not think it is going to trigger any mental illness. It might just do the opposite. But I'm just a psychonaut like the rest of us, trying to share. Peace and love."
DMT,3943j1,tomdavesy,5,Tue Jun 9 03:16:59 2015 UTC,"The family history of schizophrenia is the bit that would worry me. Psychedelics have been known to trigger or exacerbate underlying mental illness. Ultimately though, it is your body and you know it better than anyone else. If it is something you want to do and you feel you can handle, nothing anyone on the internet says will make a difference.   I also think this is not the right medium for asking such a question. This is a forum of people who really like this drug so you are getting a VERY skewed set of opinions. There also seem to be a fair few teenagers on this sub who probably shouldn't be giving advice on such matters (idk if anyone who replied is underage, I just have seen a lot of 16 y/o commenters and posters lately). Finally, I doubt many people here are doctors or mental health experts so any advice they give may not be based in a deep understanding of the subject.  This is the sort of thing you should seriously research before coming to a decision, IMO. There is information out there for you. Hell, I would even talk to your therapist or doctor to get some solid medical advice. Doctor/patient confidentiality is a wonderful thing. I love DMT and want to share it with everybody who is interested but in a situation such as this, I would feel incredibly guilty if I gave bad advice and your life was forever altered for the worse as a consequence. Happy travels, friend. I hope you find what you are looking for :)"
DMT,3943j1,dmtpsychonaut,3,Tue Jun 9 08:28:04 2015 UTC,"Take everything with a grain of salt, but I was VERY suicidally depressed the first time I ""broke through"". Like I was thinking about how to kill myself on the way to the guy's apartment I tripped at. BUT, I am very good at compartmentalizing. When I got there I decided mentally I was going to have a good time. I did and it was great. I also have a friend who has schizophrenia who has tripped with me and she didn't have any problems. Brains are complex things though and anecdotes are rarely relevant. You have to decide for yourself whether the risk is worth it."
DMT,3943j1,VolatileLemons,2,Tue Jun 9 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"Imo the depression isnt the problem. Psychedelics give you not just a rather short trip but you can also learn to love live and its possibilities on the long run. your concern about the schizophrenia is more important, as it might turn your trip into bad. If you reach a mindset someday where you wont care about the police or if your trip feels like dying,go for it. Do it on the place where you feel most comfortable and safe,maybe your bed. If you tend to be a lone wolf irl,do it alone."

DMT,3943j1,Iron_Tits,3,Tue Jun 9 09:08:09 2015 UTC,"I suffer from depression and get paranoid after smoking weed, too. And DMT has never been anything but wonderful to me. I think NN DMT is different from other psychedelics in that it doesn't mess with serotonin levels in the brain. When inhaled, and without the use of an MAOI, the body quickly metabolizes it. The trip is short and explosive. Don't expect to stay ""mentally grounded"" during it, though. That feeling of love and connectedness you felt on shrooms is similar to how I feel when coming out of a DMT trip - there's an afterglow, a feeling of wonder and awe. It can linger for a few minutes or a few days. You can probably expect to not remember a lot of details of the trip either. It's very difficult to bank those memories [for me anyway], they just disappear - similar to the way the details of a dream dissipate upon wakening. It's a mind-blowing experience, though - one I think everyone should have...at least once."
DMT,3943j1,LA-shroomer,2,Tue Jun 9 05:59:26 2015 UTC,"I used to get extremely paranoid when smoking weed.  If I heard a car doing burnouts or something, id think it was going to smash through my room......then id get caught smoking weed.  You did shrooms, you can do dmt."

DMT,3943j1,TheHighestEagle,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:39:59 2015 UTC,Weed makes me more paranoid and mentally unstable than any psychedelics and I have similar mental health issues to you. Psychedelics are the best for people with depression and anxiety because they tend to have healing/curing effects on them.
DMT,3943j1,clyde-frog1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:22:21 2015 UTC,"I can speak for Using dmt with Bipolar II or manic depression. For me, it had no effect on my disorder, it didn't trigger mania, didn't send me into a frenzy or anything. Didn't leave me depressed. Nothing like that. But, it's such an intense and unpredictable experience that caution must come first. Don't go for a breakthrough the first time. 30 mg is plenty. Get a taste for it, then if all is well, wait an hour or two and dive in."

DMT,3943j1,stochastic42,0,Fri Jun 12 09:58:19 2015 UTC,I really hope this doesn't get downvoted but DMT has been known to exacerbate paranoia and anxiety problems even after use. I would advise against using it to be honest.

DMT,3943j1,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the standard experience. It's very gentle. I imagine most people who have a problem with it are also doing something darker at the same time, like taking lots of stimulants."
DMT,3943j1,hashmon,0,Wed Jun 10 18:04:16 2015 UTC,"OP, I think you should probably give it a shot. DMT can be extremely intense, but it's also very, very friendly. You'll only go as far as you need to go.  Interesting that you blacked out during a mushroom peak. Not sure what that says, but I'm just saying, it's very doubtful that DMT will get up you in any way, since that's not its nature. Whether you'll benefit a lot from it or truly break through I have no idea."

I take a rip out of the GVG best I can and hold it in for a long while. As soon as I ingest some smoke I feel it coming, I feel the presence of another voice in my head, telling me to get ready. I quickly lie down and get ready to break Einsteins stupid laws of space time and I feel this distinct head space, this distinct feeling of opening up a portal in my head. My eyes are closed and it's like a mild closed eyed visual but also not. Like I can't tell if I'm creating the images in my mind or if I'm ""seeing"" them in my mind? Does that make any sense? Then I had a little out of body experience and started questioning where am I? who am I? who are you? but either can't remember or didn't receive an answer. Then its basically over. My damn awareness returns, I'll open my eyes to check out the visuals, and I'm completely gone from the land I just traveled. The entire thing lasts less than 10 minutes, most noticeable effects are gone within 5.   I read other trip reports and it seems like Demetri has so much more to offer then what I am getting. Is my technique bad or am I being too greedy? I am grateful for what I have seen and I remind my elven friends of this both before and after but, maybe I'm not ready to learn from them yet. Any tips regarding this? Anything I should remind myself of while I'm in the portal? What about meditation beforehand?"

After trying yoga and meditation to calm my nerves before jumping off the cliff that is entry into hyperspace, I might just as well find it similarly as easy to leave behind said crutches as an excuse to dampen othER areas of my life/existence. Thanks er'body for the feedback and safe travels=P"
DMT,393sn1,goathill,2,Wed Jun 10 07:29:57 2015 UTC,"Not a chance. Its my opinion that if you're are too nervous to go to hyperspace without an external relaxing force, you have no business tripping in the first place. Clear your head and fill it with the right intentions.  Diet and excersize.  A healthy body makes a healthy mind. A healthy, clear mind makes for much better experience.  I'm also feel using the aya diet as a guideline is pretty reasonable.  These shamans have been doing this for thousands of years, and none of them gets drunk or uses xamex before an experience.    But hey, you're your own person and I can only give you my best advice from my own experience."
DMT,393sn1,SouljaSlim504,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:19:22 2015 UTC,"Today,  I instead tried meditation albeit nothing crazy, just controlled breathing for 10 mins before jumping off and let me tell you it has been the best exp I've to date. But how it all collapses before I can even get a word in is distinctly very DMT, I find myself grabbing for my phone and I think to myself; this feels flat as fuck in comparison. What if we had geometrical smart devices? That sit nicely in one's palm? Just an aside lol. But yes, as was advised, it truly won't make a difference where ones head is at before taking those hits, because DMT has no regard for this. Light yoga and/or meditation might just induce a dare I say better trip, but I really wish I could remember what that tree person said to me through compassion of the human condition. Heard Greg proops talking about these yage papers or something of the like where William S. Burroughs travels about to experience the vine and what not, had never heard of this publishing althought he is one of my favorite visionaries."

Took two 7 second inhales and held the smoke for 10 sec, tried to take a third but overdid it and coughed it all up immediately. It came on quite strong and although I encountered entities who telepathically told me that everything is going to be alright I didn't break through. I will try to get that third hit tonight and see what happens, if that doesn't do the job I'll try a fourth hit tomorrow which should definitely do the job.  I have heard that the pure DMT vapor is very harsh. Mixed with vanilla e-juice and used with a vaporizer with an adjustable voltage it is easier to control the temperature and the vapor is probably nicer.  Edit: I mixed 250mg of DMT with 0.25ml of e-juice which gave me a total of 0.5ml of vaporizable DMT juice."

I used a 70%/30% PG/VG ratio e-juice with vanilla flavour.  Just tried it for a second time just 30 minutes ago and managed to get three okey hits but I couldn't hold them in for more than 10 sec. You really need leather lungs to get enough to break through, which I don't have unfortunately. So far I've had 2 good trips and looking at how much DMT juice is left in the tank I estimate each trip was around 25mg.  Funny sidenote, I'm actually more scared of wasting DMT by taking too big hits and coughing it all out than I am of the actual DMT experience."

Thanks for the reply fellow psychonaut!"
DMT,39257r,smokinjoe65,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:51:17 2015 UTC,Don't put it on weed. Throw extra screens into the vg and do it alone. It isn't harsh unless you're burning it.

The first 3 times I did it with friends and got very intense wonderful visuals along with the ""glow"" that everyone talks about, I didnt understand what everyone meant by breaking through.  The last time I did it alone and I only did 1 large hit (I did multiple hits on the previous occasions) as soon as I laid back after taking the hit I literally had a moment where I felt the drug said ""got ya!"" and I DEFINITELY ""broke through"".  I experienced something that was nothing short of life shattering.    Do you think the fact that I did it alone made me more relaxed and willing to allow the drug to ""get"" me? :)"

DMT,391zyi,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:58:11 2015 UTC,I use this method.  It is the only way I have tried smoking DMT and I've only done it once but it really worked. It is a lot easier to use an electronic vaporizer than a glass pipe and when you dissolve the DMT into a tasty e-juice the smoke is nicer. You can also more easily control the temperature if you have an adjustable voltage on the battery.

DMT,38sxrv,iLikePsychedelics,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:51:42 2015 UTC,I was so stoked when in the first episode of this show they started talking about spice. Was rather disappointed that it did not come up in any other episodes though =( other than exhaling their hits immediately seemed like they had a pretty firm grasp on what a journey into hyperspace should look like. Great show so far though I binge watched the whole thing in less than 24 hours haha.

Since you're getting enough dmt for one good experience, I recommend putting it all in and just going for it.   Go easy with your heat source. It does not need much in order to vaporize. The smoke will be pleasant and manageable. There is a body high; but work through it, until you can't lift your arms anymore. If you can sit your things down, you can take another hit. When I have backed away too soon, I have always regretted not going further. Just keep saying in your mind, ""This is why I'm here, this is what I want."" Dmt seems to award bravery, at least at the 35-55mg dose level.  Concentrate on your technique, and let the experience happen. Even if you don't 'breakthrough' you can still have a beautiful, otherworldly once in a lifetime experience. Let the plant communicate to you, and enjoy the ride. Good luck with everything!"

The cooler the solvent, the cleaner the product  (but you'll need to do 6 pulls to get everything).  Good luck!"
DMT,38plfi,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:33:36 2015 UTC,Don't ever shake the bottle when there's naphtha in there. Make sure to loosen the cap when in a heat bath if there's naphtha in there as well.
DMT,38plfi,Strappedforcash,2,Sun Jun 7 21:16:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure how it works in a big container but if you shake a 1or 2 l bottle for 2-3 minutes that bottle will either burst or the cap will pop off from the pressure. You can shake the shit out of it if there's not naphtha in there, but once the naptha is added pressure buildup comes into play. Do end over end rolls and don't forget to open the cap every now and then to release pressure.   Â   I use a cybs tek for mimosa and do the same thing for acrb except I do a defat after the acid but before adding the basic solution. I had great results from 1 vendor (1.2g white off white crystals from 50g acrb) pretty shitty results (nasty goo I ended up throwing away) from another vendor, so I chalk it up to bark quality."

DMT,38pb0a,uncooluserid,3,Fri Jun 5 18:34:09 2015 UTC,"I would ditch the two liter bottle. Chances are you are burning the spice beyond actual use. If you apply direct flame to it, it will ruin it and give you the results you are getting. Mild, not very impressive, 'muddy' visuals that aren't really there, and harsh smoke that is really acrid, hot, and painful. You may also be heating the plastic as well, and breathing in small amounts of plastic particulates.  The fact that you did get SOME visuals though means you are not in the small percentage of the population that it does not effect.   My advice would be to get one of these http://www.yocantech.com/wax-oil-vaporizers/ this one seems particularly effective for the molecule we are working with: http://www.yocantech.com/Yocan-EXgo-W1/index.html  So with a wax vape, you'd be able to measure out EXACTLY the amount you want to use, put it in to the heating dish where the wax would go, set the battery to one of the 3 voltages (I would recommend 3v, the heating element won't destroy it if it's higher, but this thing seems to vape any material so fast that a lower temp would be advisable, but with this method it's controllable), and then just press the button in short bursts while breathing in as much as you can/want.  That will turn your remaining 130mg into a solid 2-3 trips.  Once you've decided which to use, I would just search for it on google and order it online. Plenty of online suppliers, oddly the actual company that produces them doesn't sell to individual consumers.  Hope this helps!"
DMT,38pb0a,uncooluserid,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:08:22 2015 UTC,"These visuals vere really, really weak. I coul compare tham to those what you get when you look at a bright light and close eyes tightly but I got the slight OEV too but as I said not really noticable.  Can you tell about those people who are not affected by smoking DMT?  Will order that vaporizer you linked.   I am not applying direct flame on the foil and am keeping regular lighter about one inch away from the spice, still getting really harsh acidic smoke and some brownish stuff left on the foil after vaping."
DMT,38pb0a,uncooluserid,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"the brownish stuff you are getting is what the molecule breaks down into when not properly vaped. From the looks of it you have either a makeshift machine, but you are freebasing the molecule by putting it on the inside of the bottle/top of foil. Then heating the foil with a lighter from a small distance. This is a fairly ineffective means of smoking it, and if you ARE going to use this method, you need larger amounts to get the same bang for your buck because a portion of it is being wasted. Your method is also why it's so harsh. It's getting hot, freebasing it on tin foil gets that shit hot. Too hot = really harsh.   There is a small percentage of the human population that is unaffected by the smoking of DMT. They will not experience any closed or open eyed visuals if they are smoking it. I have tested this with someone who suspected they fell into this category. We had a surefire, fool proof ""works every time"" system using an E-cig pen, and over the course of two weeks he and I had nightly sunset/post sunset sessions in which we effectively went through 2 grams. After roughly two weeks he confessed to me that he didn't experience any visuals at all, and even when he took large doses (Multiple puffs off the pen) he would simply go into a very meditative place.  This percentage of the population seems to still be effected by oral ingestion of DMT with an MAOi, such as ayahuasca. The person I referenced above has had many sittings with aya in which he has reached deep, profound visionary states. This leads me to hypothesize that this small percentage of people has a much more active MAO system in their body, possibly? If your MAO system is much more active than the average person, it could potentially inhibit DMT intake even more than it is already inhibited by regular MAO system in the average individual.  But if you got any visuals at all from the small/burned amounts you have done so far, its a good sign. This stuff has a learning curve to smoking it correctly. Often times it's more a matter of not doing it correctly as opposed to natural immunity."
DMT,38pb0a,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:12:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Just did one more time and got some pressure feeling in my jaw and then in my brains but it was pleasurable. Also got very, very detalized fractals and they were moving like in a tunnel but still not very bright colours. At least I believe I am not im the tolerance group you mentioned. Heh, and I also fucked up by heating thr foil, it became too hot and the paper tape around it started to burn.   Gonna order some more stuff ot maybe I should get some acacia root bark powder and try making my oen DMT powder? I have some lighter fuel but am not sure that it will work. It says that it is naphta product with low boiling point. Also I don't have and don't know where to get NaOH.   Is a price of 300mg of DMT for 24$ good? If I make my own spice, than on average what would it cost for me to make, for example, 1g of spice?"
DMT,38pb0a,uncooluserid,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:07:04 2015 UTC,"yes, that is a fairly decent price for that amount. I typically see 1g go for somewhere between 70-100 in most places on the west coast, unless you have a friend hookup in which case price might be less?   Making your own is definitely an experience in and of itself. I am not well versed in this aspect but getting a full gram takes at least a couple kg of root bark, and it takes experience to perfect your system, so your first time might not be as big a yield as you'd hope. If you do want to do it, you'll have to find all the proper materials listed in one of the techs found on the forums  Also, from the picture you show, the powder you have is pretty white, which leads me to believe it's been recrystalized and purified. This aspect alone might be worth just biting the bullet and picking up from your source again.  Edit: Also, congrats on the tunnel. It definitely works. Welcome to the interdimensional travel club."
DMT,38pb0a,Hallucinagenitals,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:15:25 2015 UTC,"One kg of ACRB should produce around 20g of DMT if done correctly.

I've tried using less than .05 before to save and still blast off but I don't think it works or my method works then. I feel it but I always felt like when I did it the smoking way that I was gone. The only reason why I say I should do more is because the bags have a lot of space therefore less molecule per square inch meaning that each hit won't be as intense from the smoking hits. After thinking about it I think I found my answer. The only way to really feel it is if I inhale the whole bag, otherwise it won't be as intense. There is no way I can do that so taking the easier route would be to add more so each square inch inside the bag is more dense."
DMT,38ltpm,Interversity,3,Sat Jun 6 16:36:07 2015 UTC,DMT smoke is the worst thing ever. Vapor is almost tasty. The difference is pretty significant and vapor is definitely preferable.

DMT,38hghw,RedSteppa,5,Thu Jun 4 06:51:44 2015 UTC,"hey op, what kind of gripe and worry is your wife expressing? fear of safety? fear of addiction? fear of trauma? fear of psychosis?  im married myself and used to be in the same situation...i had never done drugs in my whole life until my wife and i decided to try weed at a friends house a couple of times. that experience opened my mind to the possibility of other substances and i began researching psychedelics. that worried my wife, especially because psychs were something i became deeply interested in -- whereas my wife couldnt care less about them and so my growing interest became a growing concern for her. it was only with a lot of time and patience that she eventually learned that psychs arent going to leave you addicted and strung out in an alley with a needle hanging out of your arm, and instead are harmless when used smartly.  the order of substances in my life was weed->salvia->shrooms->dmt  i smoked weed about 3-4 times before taking the plunge and trying salvia. after my incredible experience with salvia i tried shrooms in a forest with a friend and had just as much of a blast. following that i did salvia a few times again and finally graduated to dmt. but i can say from experience (based on the intensity of my first salvia trip compared to my various dmt trips) that i would have been perfectly fine going from weed straight to dmt (because i was perfectly fine going from weed to salvia, even though that was a huge jump as well).   nothing can prepare you for dmt so there's not really any substance you need to take beforehand. you could take shrooms or lsd but honestly there's no real comparison. that would be a bit like touching the ends of a AA battery with your fingers to prepare you for being struck by lightning. dmt is simply too intense to be compared to ""lesser"" psychs.   if your wife is worried that youre taking too big of a leap, tell her not to worry. dmt is mind blowing but youll be fine afterwards. not to mention that if you take smaller doses of dmt (5-10mg), youll have a pretty mellow trip that youll be able to retain full mental control over. its not until you take a breakthrough dose (20-30mg, when vaped properly with good technique) that you really lose control and blast off. the irony is that not even low doses of dmt can prepare you for a true dmt breakthrough/blastoff....so it's gotta be all or nothing -- take the plunge, or dont. there's no gearing up for it beforehand."
DMT,38hghw,lkj23lk4l4j,4,Thu Jun 4 07:23:16 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to say that I think you should ignore this meme in this subreddit that ""nothing can prepare you for DMT"" and have an intense psychedelic experience on mushrooms or LSD first. A non-dual experience on those WILL prepare you somewhat for what you may encounter while smoking DMT. It's hard to prepare for the speed and suddenness of it, but if you've experienced ego-death once, you won't be completely unable to relate with what happens if you find yourself without a self after DMT."
DMT,38hghw,Bodhinaut,3,Thu Jun 4 12:48:40 2015 UTC,"My total drug use is limited to a 10-strip of LSD and over 50 breakthroughs of DMT.

DMT,38hghw,Drometheu5,2,Thu Jun 4 09:09:07 2015 UTC,"LSD is a great place to start. Tell your wife that unfortunately everything is save enough to warrant investigation.  Sit in a peaceful place, watch youtube to understand how to take it. For the BEST result, cleanse your system of other stimulants such as drink heaps of water but fast for 12 hours before hand. You can start small and awake, and move onwards to breakthou over time, or you can just take as much as you can in 30's and see the after."
DMT,38hghw,lilyspears,2,Thu Jun 4 06:49:36 2015 UTC,"Starting off with dmt is intense. I just read something about taking a few drops of acid before you smoke dmt to make it easier (not my advice, but just to give you an idea).  Wether intensity is what you want or not depends on you, the smoother transition is for example shrooms first... ""smoother"" not ""better"" or ""safer"" tho IMO.  Meditation does help IME. Especially against the potential negative forms these experiences can take."
DMT,38hghw,TheUnknowingOne,2,Thu Jun 4 07:51:54 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the fact that you meditate regularly makes you about as easy as can be. You sound a little older, too. You're probably more ready than most college acid users."
DMT,38hghw,hashmon,2,Fri Jun 5 00:20:32 2015 UTC,I believe mediation is a far better way to prepare for DMT than taking other drugs. Nothing else is like DMT and going into it with a clear mind is the best option. I'd even recommend fasting before hand.
DMT,38hghw,rantan1618,2,Thu Jun 4 17:47:55 2015 UTC,How long?

DMT,38e8da,magnusofspades,3,Wed Jun 3 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"The easiest method I've found is to infuse the DMT onto a smokable herb, creating what is known as DMT Enhanced Leaf. You dissolve the spice Ina little bit of ISO alcohol and then mix in the leaf matter and allow the alcohol to evaporate off. Once your herb is fully dry (I would recommend leaving it for at least a full day once the liquid is gone to be sure all the ISO is evaporated off) you simply load it in a bowl and smoke as you would marijuana. Try to keep it from burning too hot and hold the hits in for 10-15 seconds apiece and you will be touring hyperspace in no time! Good luck and happy travels!"
DMT,38e8da,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:21:47 2015 UTC,Is this how you've done it? I'm thinking about doing this. How much spice would you say?  And what smokeable herb would you recommend?
DMT,38e8da,mjvej4f,3,Wed Jun 3 19:45:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, I swear by this method. Most mixes are a 1:1 ratio of herb to spice. My mix is mullein and caapi leaf. Caapi is an MAOI but it doesn't seem to have any potentiating effect in the small quantities used for enhance leaf so I never worry about adverse food/drug interactions."

DMT,38e8da,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:24:05 2015 UTC,I believe its better to keep the two separate. Weed can cloud the trip and the smoke can be difficult to hold in. Its totally possible though and people have done it.
DMT,38e8da,Lawnboy490,2,Thu Jun 4 18:27:48 2015 UTC,"This may not be the advice your looking for, but when I first tried it, and still my preferred method, I dropped a couple hits of acid and the best way I can explain the reasoning is that when your going to the edges of space/reality/whatever it's best to start off while you're already in space. It's incredibly strange to go from sober to tripping your goddamn balls off then back to it in a matter of minutes. I would do it sober now that I've been there and back a few times but for first times I'd like to say start in that way as long as your doing it smart, as in, you're in a good acid/shroom environment and take a hit of DMT, cuz you're just intensifying what's already going on, whereas going from 0 to 60 can really fuck with you. That being said you are you and your own comfort and shit is what you gotta roll with, but when taking leaps it's generally hard to plan the safest, best way, which is all part of the journey."

DMT,38ahsc,IndyTucknee,4,Tue Jun 2 23:11:49 2015 UTC,"I was smoking DMT at least once a day for two weeks straight. During the beginning of this time I was having crazy colorful intricate pattern visions. People were trying it and loving it. After about a week I noticed I was no longer breaking through but a wildly different possession like feeling came over me. I ended up jumping off the floor, moving erradically, twitching. The trip after that I was with a bunch of friends in a comfortable environment but when I took the hit I didn't get any visuals but I forgot who I was. I remember feeling like my brain had stopped and I could think of nothing and didn't know what to do. The final trip, I sat down, alone, in my familiar room. Meditated before hand wishing desperately to see something. Took the hit, held it in, closed my eyes, and all I saw were very dim patterns and when my eyes were open, everything thing I looked at, the patterns would rotate like 35 degrees until I fixated on them and they stopped. At first I thought the batch went bad but everyone else was still able to get where they needed. I'm taking a break for now. Part of it I think has to do with some minor depression issues and bigger life problems, but I definitely feel I was taking advantage of the substance a little. Taking it too seriously, trying to find something meaningful in it."
DMT,38ahsc,antonideli,0,Tue Jun 2 23:51:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds like maybe your technique is unreliable? Whats your ROA?  First time I got my hands on DMT I had the opposite effect. I had a bunch of trips spread out over a couple weeks, usually doing 3 trips back to back and then waiting a couple days and repeating.   First few sounded a lot like your last one. Ambiguous/dim colors and patterns...very nice effect but nothing groundbreaking. As I improved my technique over that time period the effects became more astounding, until my final trip a couple weeks later was the most powerful experience of my life.   I don't think depression and life issues should affect the intensity of a trip, considering that the intensity of a trip is not up to either your conscious or subconscious mental states, any more than your injuries after getting hit by a bus are up to either.   How'd Bob survive being hit by that truck?  Oh, you know, he's going through some depression right now so it didn't affect him as much as it could have.    A DMT trip is a causal reaction in your brain that you can't think your way out of. It's the result of an uncontrollable chemical reaction and not the result of intention, thought, etc. How you process the trip is a different story, though.  The only way depression could affect a trip is if you're taking medication, and the medication interacted with the DMT, minimizing its effects.   Tolerance can build with frequent DMT use....but it fades extremely rapidly (as in like a....wait an hour between trips kinda thing)."
DMT,38ahsc,Alien_bru,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:36:09 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your wish for visuals might be altering the dmt experience. Get back to the first time when you didn't try anything, that's the spot. I think you've had too much time to contemplate your previous trips, forgetting how tripping works. If you can't see the seperation between body and soul on dmt you're being too active.  First time you didn't really know what to expect, this helps. From what I've read people usually fly off the hardest when they think ""ok ill just do a dose which wont really do anything""."
DMT,38ahsc,TheUnknowingOne,2,Wed Jun 3 05:57:08 2015 UTC,"I too was thinking about this. Basically what you're saying is to let the DMT work his way to the brain, while you are just the silent spectator with no judgement or expectation. I actually tried this approach one time with no success, what I did was just meditate (vipassana meditation) for 15 minutes and then smoke DMT with a calm and controlled mindset. The result didn't change, maybe it's something much more profound, or simply the brain has rewired ifself so that one wouldn't feel the effects anymore, could that be possible?"
DMT,38ahsc,TheUnknowingOne,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:26:12 2015 UTC,"I've had the sensation of me letting go of tension in my eye and OEV's flowing back into my sight. I can imagine that if you are too focussed on the visuals your mind has build some rewiring or even filter for it. If you whip out vipassana meditation I wouldn't know what you're doing wrong, meditation always feels like the final solution to me. If I manage to clear my mind the trip will be great, but the recursive effect of the (still to come) trip on my mind can really fuck this up.  How experienced are you with meditation?"
DMT,38ahsc,Molestador,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:07:28 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm gonna give it a couple more tries in a different environment than the usual (my room, at night, when it's calm), maybe with different external stimuli the brain would be less inclined to follow the same routine/pattern.  I started meditating thanks to Headspace.com a couple years ago, pretty regularly 10-15 minutes a day, the first 5-6 months were REVELATING, they changed me so much and helped me figure out a lot of my inner self. The it gradually went down to a session every once in a while, when I feel particularly stressed or to help me sleep or focus... Or before I smoke DMT :)"

DMT,385wqo,Johndamon77,4,Tue Jun 2 22:19:20 2015 UTC,"It's generally considered best to refrain from most drugs until the early 20's or so, if only for purposes of ensuring proper brain development. That said, I first tried DMT at 18 and I feel like it's only influenced me positively. Theoretically, best to wait until biologically fully grown to maximize harm reduction; practically, a few psychs will likely have less detrimental effect than regular amphetamine/cocaine/opiate/cannabis use would. In certain South American tribes, it's not uncommon for children to be given their first dose of ayahuasca at age 10-12. The effect of psychedelic use on adolescent brain development is certainly something that hasn't been formally studied."
DMT,385wqo,Isoiledmypants,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:13:50 2015 UTC,Pretty sure I've seen l ayahuasca be given to todderls/infants in some documentary.
DMT,385wqo,LSDkiller,3,Tue Jun 2 07:26:19 2015 UTC,"Im 16 and tried dmt a few months ago. I feel like im in a similar boat as you except i had to kick amphetamines not opiates, and i rarely smoke now. But psychedelics seem to offer so much, im not sure how they affect my brain and i dont think its clear how it affects most adults. But ive gained so much experience and motivation from my lsd shrooms and dmt trips that i feel so fortunate to have tried psychedelics at such a young age."
DMT,385wqo,TheAmishChicken,2,Tue Jun 2 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"I am 16 now and got my first blast two days ago, on sunday. ordered 250 mg but ended up wasting almost all of it. i laid like half on weed, but it was too harsh to smoke, so i ended up saying fuck it and put the rest in the bowl and used the ash-sandwich method. worked perfectly, no flame touched the dmt-infused weed and i held the hit, was surprisingly easy. i get a shock feeling and at first i wonder if i smoked acetone or some impurity of the acetone (as i only let the stuff dry for like 6 hours, but there was no acetone smell, too harsh to smoke straight though). since i had no breathing problems and the feeling was relatively psychedelic, i calmed down and enjoyed the trip. wasn't what i expected from the tiny highs i had before."
DMT,385wqo,hashmon,2,Tue Jun 2 10:28:56 2015 UTC,"Im about to turn 16 in about a week. I dont really have a problem with younger people doing drugs obviously, but there are a lot of people who are better off not."
DMT,385wqo,r4cid,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:50:12 2015 UTC,"It's about intellectual maturity, OP. Unless you're insanely exceptional, I doubt you'll break through. But if you think you're ready, go for it."
DMT,385wqo,hashmon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:12:27 2015 UTC,"OP said he had already broken through. Also, breaking through has nothing to do with intellectual maturity. If you inhale enough vapor, you'll breakthrough regardless of intellect or maturity."
DMT,385wqo,r4cid,0,Wed Jun 3 11:42:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that. Tons of people don't breakthrough. You need to be at a certain level of spiritual clarity to get there, it seems."
DMT,385wqo,hashmon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:23:21 2015 UTC,"People who don't breakthrough aren't using the proper technique(ex. Burning, not inhaling enough fast enough, not holding it in long enough, bad product) .   If you can show me a video of someone not ""spiritually prepared"" smoking a couple hundred mgs in one hit or slamming it and not breaking through, feel free to actually argue a concrete point."
DMT,385wqo,r4cid,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:02:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe, man, maybe. But I've known plenty of people to not break through, and there are a lot of reports on it in reddit as well, many if which involved the person just not doing it right mechanically, but in many of them they are doing it right. And certain things block the experience, too, like coffee, for instance, or lots alcohol. My neighbor had a bad experience because he was idiotically drunk at the time.   But fundamentally I do agree with you. It's not hard to break through if you do it right, and the experience is the for anyone to have. For some people it takes a little practice, though."
DMT,385wqo,hashmon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:09:31 2015 UTC,"It undoubtedly takes practice, but I think the mechanical portion makes up like 90% of it working or not."

DMT,385dqw,Chemica1Brain,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:58:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been looking into it and everything. I've tried meditating but I just don't feel as though it suits me. To me, exercising is like my form of meditating."
DMT,385dqw,Chemica1Brain,2,Tue Jun 2 00:09:51 2015 UTC,I guess. But if meditating isnt for you then dmt would be a big leap. Doesnt seem good to do dmt at a time like that. Get your head straight then do dmt. Meditation can help. Maybe give it another try? With no preconcived notions. May take a bit for you to see/feel results. Good luck.
DMT,385dqw,TheUnknowingOne,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:39:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll definitely give it another try. Thanks for replying!"
DMT,385dqw,Splingy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:01:35 2015 UTC,Meditation is not something of the western world and it doesn't come easy to everyone but it has the same effect on all. The physical relaxation gained with meditation is ime greatly beneficial to any psychedelic experience. On top of that the mental relaxation seems the key to some of the most intense experiences.  IME meditation or other mental processes are the only way to really influence trips.
DMT,385dqw,LA-shroomer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:39:24 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this. Also would recommend Advaita Vedanta (in particular Rupert Spira, Francise Lucille and Mooji) as a viable alternative/addition to Buddhism."
DMT,385dqw,LA-shroomer,2,Tue Jun 2 12:42:25 2015 UTC,"Hey friend - depression is serious. But DMT is not the answer. That's not to say you wouldn't probably enjoy it - my experiences have always been positive, beautiful, and deeply profound. But therapy, exercise, medication, and meditation is what's needed for treating depression. Everything feels better when you're not depressed - including DMT. Get yourself better/healthy BEFORE trying it and the experience will be that much more enjoyable. Hope this helps."
DMT,385dqw,LA-shroomer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:36:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding man. Yeah, I definitely want to try DMT at least once in my life but I'm still very scared of it. It's just strange because I really want to do it but if I can't even smoke weed how am I going to handle DMT? I used to love smoking weed but now it makes me all paranoid and anxious. Sigh, oh well. I guess I'll just keep working through this depression."
DMT,385dqw,LA-shroomer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:00:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't smoke weed, either - I get the same reaction from it that you do - I just don't enjoy the way it makes me feel anymore. But you're comparing apples to oranges. DMT is nothing like weed. Also, I think it's important and 100% normal to have a healthy respect for it. I get anxious before smoking it every single time. But something else also happens, every single time - I end up asking myself, ""why was I EVER afraid?"" - because the experience is always so mind-blowingly beautiful and NOT scary. The question usually arises after the apex of the trip, just as the pieces of my ""self"" begin to reassemble and I realize what I've done/where I am.   DMT has always been kind to me - loving, reassuring, fun - and continues to blow my mind. It makes me laugh and shows me the most beautifully absurd things. I almost always come away from it giggling, mesmerized, and in awe of it's visual power. But then, like a dream, the memory of the experience dissolves and fades away.  I think everyone should try it at least once, especially if your curious about it - just don't consider it a treatment for depression. Godspeed, my friend."
DMT,385dqw,TheUnknowingOne,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:47:23 2015 UTC,Hmm fair enough. I know it probably won't 'cure' my issues but do you still think it's useful for looking at my problems from another point of view? I've just read a lot studies about the use of psychedelics in treating anxiety disorders and what not.
DMT,385dqw,gratuitous_algorithm,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:07:28 2015 UTC,"NN DMT isn't an introspective drug in the way that 5MeO DMT, shrooms, ayahuasca, and other psychedelics are - the trip is just too short and explosive.   Interestingly, research is showing the usefulness of ketamine in treating depression.  Have you ever tried mushrooms?"
DMT,385dqw,TheUnknowingOne,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"Nah I haven't. Like I said I'm afraid I may have a bad trip on it, which is sort of why I'm interested in DMT. Perhaps when my issues get better I can proceed. However, you mentioned how you also get anxious/paranoid on weed;so how do mushrooms or LSD affect you?"
DMT,385dqw,LA-shroomer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"I've had some really amazing experiences shrooms, however, the potential for a bad trip is there. Set and setting is, of course, paramount. Also, having a sitter who can be a comfort and reassurance if the trip gets hairy is important - especially until you know how a dose will affect you. Whatever headspace you're in is usually amplified on shrooms so, probably best not to take if you're depressed. However, micro-dosing might be an option worth investigating.   As far as LSD goes - same rules apply.  Are you currently on medication for depression? I've suffered from it in varying degrees my entire life - I know how shitty it can get."
DMT,385dqw,Mobile_Version,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:58:08 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm currently taking fluoxetine 10mg daily(Prozac). It's been marginally good at treating my depression as in it gives me enough motivation to keep my good habits going. But as far as the roots of my depression, it seems to be rooted in the big questions in life. Like what exactly is life? What is consciousness? Is there an afterlife? And for me, having very pessimistic and cynical views on these things sort of really took a toll on my mental health. And it doesn't help that these things are sort of unknowable, so I'm just in a place of uncertainty and not exactly believing in myself and not knowing what the 'correct' way of viewing the world is. I'm just trying my best to really root out the cause of my depression and resolve it rather than have to keep suffering through it."
DMT,385dqw,smokinjoe65,2,Wed Jun 3 04:51:58 2015 UTC,"If you want to get to the root of your depression don't look at us, nor dmt. That is your job, it always will be. Dmt might help you, but if the root scares you that is not something dmt can fix. You need to have ""faith"", instead of feeling like your existence is material see past the charade! Dmt showed me this.  Your emotions are not something you need to physically alter. You don't even have to think to change them. They work autonomously. Through your soul.  Not everyone on earth is as depressed as you because they don't think about what science says. Look at the double slit experiment and biocentrism, perhaps that gives you some perspective into the lies that our understanding of this universe contains but everyone ignores. I've been there. This is not just a giant sandbox. People don't know what this implies about the emptiness of this existence, don't think you do either. Don't read past science. Add it to life instead of seeing it as a subtitude. Don't forget to live. Don't forget to be. Don't forget to feel. Learn to let thoughts be.  Science isn't wrong, it's not the whole picture. Find your own logic. If your logic should contain the dmt-verse or not is your choice :)  Science is a way of understanding the world around you, not meta-explaining it."
DMT,385dqw,LA-shroomer,2,Wed Jun 3 07:58:43 2015 UTC,"I went through this kind of existential crisis when I was younger, and I can tell you that MDMA and shrooms helped pull me out of it. Not sure if you should be expecting a cure through DMT tho, as you'll never get what you expect anyway."
DMT,385dqw,gratuitous_algorithm,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:06:50 2015 UTC,Yeah with DMT you just get what you need.
DMT,385dqw,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:54:46 2015 UTC,"Uncertainty - yeah, that can go either way, huh? For some, uncertainty can excite and invigorate. For others, such as myself [and possibly you], it can cause crippling fear. Proper perspective is everything. Unfortunately, when you're depressed, your perspective is skewed, and things generally feel much more weighty. Normal setbacks, or problems in life, can feel like the end of the world. And just getting to, ""normal,"" to a place where the playing field is level, can feel like such an uphill battle. But it sounds like the prozac is helping.    Have you heard the phrase ""that which you resist, persists""? It implies that our suffering is the result of not being able to accept what ""is"". I have a book recommendation for you. It's as simple as it is profound. It's Cheri Huber's, ""That Which You Are Seeking Is Causing You To Seek."" Check it out if you can.  I know this probably WON'T help much but I think hearing Woody Allen's thoughts on the meaning of life was pretty interesting.  Have you been over to rationalpsychonaut?  Lastly, check out The Entheogenic Evolution - it's a great podcast on the subject of psychedelics. I know that Martin Ball [the host] isn't everyone's cup of tea but he's got great guests and the conversations are always stimulating. A couple of my favorites include his 2-part conversation with James Oroc, the author of The Tryptamine Palace: Part1 and Part2; and his conversation with Olli from Psilohuasca.com  Good stuff."

I don't really connect with that point of view anymore though. I'm just finding that there are so so so many things that we do not know in this world, that to make a conclusion like that is just speculation. But yeah, anyways thanks for all the helpful material!"
DMT,385dqw,smokinjoe65,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:45:38 2015 UTC,"The experience itself should be your reason, not any result of having done it. I'd say steer clear of using it to ""treat"" anything. Having said that, a good experience will leave you with the best feeling of well being and that may bleed into other aspects of your life. Another thing I wouldn't do is roll it into the same ball as other psychedelics. Even though it's far stronger than any other psychedelic (dose for dose) and it snatches one out of reality fairly instantly, it is relatively gentle, and very rarely do real world problems affect trips, unless you go into it with a shitty mindset. You don't really have time to think of your problems. Just go into it gracefully and bravely, anticipating a wonderful experience.   Also, check whether your medication hinders the effects of DMT."

DMT,384v40,LSDkiller,3,Mon Jun 1 21:50:51 2015 UTC,"try the sandwich method!!! but don't let any flame touch the goods and you have to use ash!!! you have to hold the flame far away and suck so that only the hot air touches the crystals, keep sucking until you see smoke in your bong/pipe/smoking device if you've kept the flame far away enough it will only be vapor which is much less harsh than burnt dmt smoke, believe me. itll be surprisingly  easy to hit and hold, the trip comes on pretty much after you've exhaled the first time."
DMT,384v40,Interversity,2,Tue Jun 2 10:31:53 2015 UTC,"Take the time to get your method correct so you vaporize instead of burn. The difference between smoke and vapor is very noticeable - the vapor barely has any heat while the smoke is twice as bad as weed smoke. If you're coughing your lungs out, you're probably burning it."
DMT,384v40,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:58:12 2015 UTC,I've burned it once or twice and you're right... the smoke is noticeably more harsh and is even a bit hotter. Vapor is borderline tasteless and stays relatively cool.
DMT,384v40,Interversity,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:32:22 2015 UTC,I was surprised because I only just burned it recently after several dozen experiences. It was extremely unpleasant and left a horrible taste in my mouth and nose that didn't subside until it was over. I hadn't realized I'd been doing it right so much haha
DMT,384v40,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:37:01 2015 UTC,"Right? Haha :) the gvg makes it super easy, but it can burn if I pull too fast. The best method, for me, is to pull just barely enough to bend the flame until it fills with vapor, then clear it with the rest of my lung power."
DMT,384v40,Molestador,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:35:52 2015 UTC,"take a small hit that will get your cough out of the way, after that it is easier to take a larger hit. try and clear the dose on the second hit and hold it in as long as you can. this technique usually works for my friend with the same issue."
DMT,384v40,scrufdawg,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:50:10 2015 UTC,"What I tell everyone. If there is any harshness to the vapor at all, then you're doing it wrong. A glass vapor genie will be the best money you've ever spent if you're truly looking to comfortably and reliably blast off."
DMT,383ho9,I-PLUG-LSD,2,Mon Jun 1 16:16:08 2015 UTC,I'd go w/ the VG - far more efficient than a grav bong. Grav bong will just be inefficient and waste your dmt anyways. For doses like 7mg-15mg you'll have little to no trouble.  For bigger hits you may need to find a brave friend to hold the pipe as you may black out.

DMT,383ho9,lettis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"I've only done 3 trips to date, 15, 32, 7 in that order - all using the VG. 7 was by far the most enjoyable, 32 caused me to blackout and get stuck in a terrifying thought loop."
DMT,383ho9,mackthetemp,2,Mon Jun 1 17:58:04 2015 UTC,"whats VG? i don't think 15mg would even have any effect, a typical dossage is between 50 and 60mg"
DMT,383ho9,lettis,6,Mon Jun 1 18:13:48 2015 UTC,It all comes down to vaping efficiency. I've heard of people having full on breakthroughs vaping 20mg through a VG (Vapor Genie)
DMT,383ho9,dmtpsychonaut,2,Mon Jun 1 18:16:36 2015 UTC,"Haha you can breakthrough on 18 and that's with the machine. It's just delicate business to smoke it, if you need 50mg for a breakthrough perhaps you're doing something wrong. Your breathing, vaporizing and even mindset greatly affect the trip. Could be tolerance?"
DMT,383ho9,TheUnknowingOne,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"I rarely go above 30mg, with the bulk of my breakthroughs being between 20-25mg. You don't need anywhere near 50-60mg unless you're burning it up in a terribly inefficient device. Hell, I've broken through on 50mg snorted on numerous occasions, which is much less efficient than vaping."
DMT,383ho9,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:28:51 2015 UTC,"Vapor genie. To my knowledge, which is limited and consists of second hand info from a friend who is on dmt nexus, typical breakthrough doses are 30-40mg in the VG and rarely more."
DMT,383ho9,mackthetemp,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:19:25 2015 UTC,"Actually the 1 and only time I broke through was with a grav bong, I got it just right and took 40mg and I blasted off haha, I thought it worked better than any other way I tried"

I also trip on my bed with many blankets around so even if I did drop it, it wouldn't break....but I've always had enough motor control at the beginning of the trip to set it down before I completely lose touch with reality."
DMT,383ho9,Alien_bru,2,Mon Jun 1 17:11:28 2015 UTC,"have you done it before? the effect is pretty instant.  i can't comment on using a glass pipe but using a bong you will generally have a few seconds to put it down but there is also times when you inhale and lose your sense before you can even exhale.   though some people would consider it wasteful to smoke dmt in a joint i would highly recommend it for the first time!  you can smoke dmt with green tea, just cut open a bag and mix about 100mg with enough to roll a joint, its great because you can choose to keep going deeper into the trip or stop if it is to scary and not your kind of thing. You can smoke the whole thing slowly over 10 minutes and you will still have limited motor control."
DMT,383ho9,lettis,2,Mon Jun 1 17:34:46 2015 UTC,"I haven't done it before.  Thanks for the suggestion, I'll have a look into it."
DMT,383ho9,RiverGod,2,Mon Jun 1 18:23:40 2015 UTC,Ideally once you start to feel it you take one more hit then put the pipe down. Its possible to drop the pipe. Once i had to just let the pipe go because it felt like it melted in my hands and i could barely see the table in front of me. Just be carefull what you are doing and itll be fine. Bear in mind i was using the tiny bottle with stainless steel kinda crackpipe setup. Not sure what your setup is

Don't use torches that stay on you'll be fine."
DMT,382idr,d_m_tina,2,Mon Jun 1 11:33:40 2015 UTC,"Tolerance is not really an issue, you can blast off 30 minutes after your last trip without much diminishing of effects. For the changa, you could roll a joint with it but as you said, it would waste quite a bit. I would recommend smoking it out of a normal bowl or bong. Remember you will need more changa than you would freebase in order to break through. Idk what ratio your blend is, but it is usually about 1:1 meaning you will need about 100mg changa to fully break through. I would try 40mg to start with if you want to get a feel for it. Happy travels!  PS I dig your username :)"
DMT,382idr,dmtpsychonaut,2,Mon Jun 1 12:47:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info/advice!  I'll give about 40mg of changa a go for my first attempt- it's a 1:1 blend exactly as you said so that seems to be about 20mg of DMT?

Thankfully overdosing isn't an issue (at least not with the amounts we're talking)  so I guess I'll try 50mg after some practice.

DMT,382idr,LSDkiller,3,Mon Jun 1 14:54:58 2015 UTC,"You don't really got to worry about overdosing on DMT; you'll more than likely fade before you even get close to approaching an overdose.; and yeah like all psychedelics set and setting plays a big role; having a positive and happy mindset, and whatever you do don't fight the DMT just give in, or it will fuck you sideways to hell haha.. Only for 15min or so though"

DMT,380rv2,CurryThighs,9,Mon Jun 1 00:30:34 2015 UTC,"Breakthrough = completely lose touch with reality -- that includes losing touch with all of your natural senses as well....zero awareness of body and surroundings; mind completely taken over by the psychedelic experience.   How you lose touch depends on the chemical, and it's possible to have a breakthrough with many different substances. My breakthroughs on DMT are different than my breakthroughs on salvia, for example. On DMT my sense of awareness is overwhelmed, whereas on salvia it's replaced."
DMT,380rv2,Alien_bru,6,Mon Jun 1 00:39:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, I thought so. This is pretty much what happened on my LSD experience, however, my body remained active. it seemed to be acting out everything my inner mind (that was not aware I even had a body or what 'I' even was) was doing.  For example, I vaguely remember being able to shift from the colour blue to the colour orange. In reality, this was my body moving from a cold area of the room to a warm area (under a blanket). Yet, at the same time, my body's mind was making it's own assumptions and conclusion based on what little sensory information it was receiving."
DMT,380rv2,jonesRG,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:44:02 2015 UTC,Agreed.
DMT,380rv2,Rolling_Kimura,2,Mon Jun 1 04:18:30 2015 UTC,"I like relating ""breaking through"" to out-of-body experiences (OBEs). You've obviously not left the physical space from where you started (and come back to), but your mind knows no difference.   I also think of it as your brain fulfilling its processing capacity. Psychedelics disrupt the normal flow of things and supercharge other areas that aren't normally active. I believe this flood of sensory and subconscious overload causes your brain to fill in the gaps (we can only rely on what our brain processes and tells us). It's similar to a dream world, but plenty of users' experiences align very unlike dreams. Dreams are usually far more non-sensical and it is certainly rare for two individuals to have the same dream while in REM. DMT's message is unmistakeably shared regardless of the user."
DMT,380rv2,nowheretoday,2,Mon Jun 1 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"Initially I thought 'breaking through' was peeling back my mental walls that restrained me from going deep into the DMT trip. A real breakthrough later and I can confidently conclude that it involves sufficient dosage and as Alien_Bru and nowheretoday pointed out, that transition beyond the veil of consciousness where you transcend your physical self  and subsequently operate in that metaphysical space. What ensues, I have found, is not exactly up to you =)  I made a thread the other day on my breakthrough - it was indeed an ego-death and it kicked my ass."
DMT,380rv2,just___no11,7,Wed Jun 3 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"Breaking through is where your conscious mind becomes the subconscious and the subconscious becomes the conscious. Where you go from space/time to time/space, physical to metaphysical."

DMT,380rv2,StonerMeditation,2,Mon Jun 1 04:18:24 2015 UTC,"Breaking through is another phrase for 'ego-death'.  It can either be negative like a meltdown nightmare, or positive like samadhi (ecstatic body, profoundly clear mind, and connection between self/other).  Breakthrough can be done lots of different ways; meditation, any type of psychedelic (including marijuana), and so many other ways...  Some people think it's problematic to have a breakthrough, because it's non-ordinary reality, instead of every-day reality.  But it's real, just on another higher-level of insight.  If breakthrough is kept in a spiritual context it's astounding, if it becomes dissociation/derealisation...etc it's painful.  You might find 'Stoner Meditation' helpful (amazon), it discusses how to have a safe breakthrough, and gives examples.  If you can't afford it, PM me with an email address and I'll send you a copy."

DMT,381jza,phyyr,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:24:49 2015 UTC,It's because I'm not sure i  can commit to such a  time restraint that LSD has.

DMT,37zirw,lettis,3,Sun May 31 18:52:09 2015 UTC,"for anyone interested, the famous pop band pink floyd started as a psychedelic band in 1966.  the founder of the band and the sole songwritter for their early work (such as thing song) was a guy named Syd Barrett.  Syd Barrett was an absolute genius, described as extremely charismatic and relaxed person, his music is credited as some of the most ground breaking, he was also a huge LSD and acid user, with people gauging that acid and lsd must have been 90% of his diet.   as pink floyd gained popularity Syd began to lose his mind, people described that his eyes had turned into black holes, he would stand on stage not moving, not singing, not playing the guitar or playing a completely different song to what the band was playing.   he became so cooked out from the drugs he became completely unaware of what was happening around him and lost all ability to play and write music with pink floyd, one day the band decided not to bother picking him up before and that was that, syd was no longer in pink floyd.   the band did not see syd for many years, but one day during the recording of a famous song, ""wish you were here"" a song in tribute to the fallen syd barrett, syd appeared at the recording studio, however none of the band members recognised him. He had put on 100 pounds and had shaven his head and eye brows, he was holding a toothbrush and was holding the tooth brush completely still while moving his face around the brush...  the band members were in shock and said something along the lines of, ""well syd, its nice to see you, this song is for you, what do you think of the new songs we have written"" and syd replied with ""it sounds a bit shit"" and left.  none of the band members saw him until his funeral in 2006."

DMT,37zf9s,Druggiethrowaway420,2,Sun May 31 18:25:24 2015 UTC,Yes it is possible but only rarely.  I would reccommend having your dmt ceremony while sitting up/back against a pillow. You could use a sitter too until you get comfortable with how your body reacts.

DMT,37zf9s,MnFury,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:40:10 2015 UTC,"I've vomited moments after taking my hits once. Had a breakthrough on the previous trip of the same batch, and sub-breakthrough trips on the same batch as well.  I don't know what was different but as soon as I took my hits I knew something wasn't right. I felt like i was dying. I started to panic. I dry heaved once, then got up and stumbled into the bathroom. Thankfully the toilet lid was already up because I started vomiting right away.  As I was vomiting, I began to trip really hard, and it was an awful experience. I saw a jester-like face in my puke that I felt was taunting me. It felt like what I imagine an ayahuasca purge would feel like, only shorter. I remember thinking to myself that it will be over in just a few minutes.  I kept heaving air, because there was nothing left in my stomach, until I sobered up about 10 minutes later.  I was very intimidated by DMT after that. It wasn't until a few months later that I tried it again, the same batch, and the times before and after have all been very amazing experiences. I looked up other trip reports to see if anyone else has vomited, and it seems to be rare.  But yes, it is possible to vomit."

The boiling point of N,N DMT is 629.8 degrees (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine), so anything slightly above that will work well to vaporize it quickly.  Too much heat and you change the composition of it, affecting the effects."

It is a structural analog of serotonin and melatonin and a functional analog of other psychedelic tryptamines such as 4-AcO-DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, 5-OH-DMT, psilocybin (4-PO-DMT), and psilocin (4-OH-DMT).

DMT,37xz8s,smokinjoe65,2,Sun May 31 09:49:29 2015 UTC,"It may well be a separate ""dimension"" that's hidden in our own DNA. That's the theory Jeremy Narby and Graham Hancock have put forth. It's clearly something very ""other"" that we interact with in DMT breakthroughs, but at the same time it may be part of us.  As far as separating from society- I'd say spiritually and intellectually, we have to completely distance ourselves. We can't run away; we're part of society, but society is completely psychotic. You really have to think and experience for yourself."
DMT,37xz8s,hashmon,1 point,Sun May 31 22:03:17 2015 UTC,"I agree. The key is finding that goldilocks zone where you're still ""part"" of society but you're not overly affected by its influence. As far as we know, life is short... too short to allow a collective to do the bulk of our thinking.  Regarding Narby and Hancock with their theory of internal dimensions, that is so fascinating... it is interesting to imagine how the most profound experience we can have on DMT isn't based on us travelling somewhere else in time and space, but is instead based on us turning inward and diving into our own personal microcosm."
DMT,37xz8s,hashmon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:38:26 2015 UTC,"You should check out Narby's book ""The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge"" sometime. It's not just a random theory; he studies shamanic cultures and finds lots of references and art that look just like DNA, two twisting snakes. Indigenous ayahuasqueros talk a lot about these wise teaching twisting snakes that teach people things during their ayahuasca experiences. And western science has no idea what roughly 95% of DNA actually does, which is bizarre, when you think about it. Shamans may know more about this subject than western scientists. Here's a talk he did on it, if anyone's interested: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LKwzYQm-OuY"
DMT,37y2as,LSDkiller,1 point,Sun May 31 10:39:37 2015 UTC,Give it two days after you can't see any more obvious liquid to be safe. Make sure to chop up the plant matter and mix it around to allow as much to evaporate as possible.
DMT,37y2as,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Sun May 31 22:44:02 2015 UTC,"smoked it after 6 hours or so. it had 0 acetone smell, also when burned, but it had an extremely harsh taste, unsmokeable. was that cause of residual acetone? it was unsmokeable but not unvapeable, got a breakthrough using the sandwich method but no flame touched the goods."
DMT,37y2as,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:46:44 2015 UTC,"Dude I'm worried that you smoked that stuff before the acetone had a chance to fully evaporate. I mean I guess it probably won't kill you, but it is definitely bad for you. Patience is key when you are dealing with chemicals like this. Don't be hasty. DMT had been around forever and will be here long after you and I are gone. There is no rush to do this stuff, take your time and do it right.   When I made e-leaf I waited 3 days to remove it from the drying vessel and then tried it maybe a day or two after that. The smoke was very mild with a unique but not necessarily unpleasant taste. I was able to hold it in for 15 seconds with no problem. However, I used mullein as the base herb instead of weed so that may have something to do with it.   I saw somewhere else that you say you are 16. I find myself in a quandry because I feel bad giving drug advice to such a young person. But at the same time I would rather you do it right than fuck it up royally. I personally wish that I had held off on drugs until I was an adult. I didn't, but I wish I did. I smoked weed, ate pills, dropped acid, and molly before my 18th birthday and a it brought me were some good times and much hardship at home. Drugs will be here forever and they can be a lot of fun and very eye opening if done in the right set an setting. I feel personally that at home with your parents is not the right set and setting for any mind altering chemical. Respect your parents, they gave you life and love you immensely and drug use can only hurt them. Unless of course they're into that sort of thing. In which case.... I guess do whatever.   I'm honestly not trying to be a grandpa Debbie downer I just felt this thing and had to express it. Happy travels!"

But what you will get from it is impossible to say. I've got goo before, and many times I hoped that it is DMT disguised as goo, but all that I've got was intense body load and slight visuals, so it was probably mostly NMT and plant fats. That's why Mimosa hostilis is the king in my opinion.  Smoalk it, and you will know."

DMT,37usk8,RedSteppa,1 point,Sat May 30 16:26:08 2015 UTC,20mg is too little for the nasal route. But as even this lead to nose bleeding I would not advise to try using more. Blasting off in pain and bleeding is not ideal and should be avoided.  Maybe she should choose another route?

I was sitting upright on a couch, but my vision was somehow from the floor.  I've explained it to other people like my mind was a gigantic file cabinet, and when the peak came right as the weed/DMT was hitting, all of the drawers were rearranged.

DMT,37ozh9,jawnsinthrowaway,2,Fri May 29 20:30:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Kinda like that sound when you put a slinky to your ear and let it drop to the floor. Although I personally stay away from whippets/no2, I feel it's destructive on my brain."

DMT,37p8yr,condescending_hindu,2,Fri May 29 09:12:12 2015 UTC,.... it is going to be hard to scrape the inside of the jar... evaporated will not happen in the freezer I don't think. The freezer causes precipitation or allows the dmt to separate from the naptha... most times glass baking pans are used so it is easier to scrape the dmt off of
DMT,37p8yr,cautiouschemist,1 point,Fri May 29 12:14:22 2015 UTC,Yea that was one of my concerns.  I actually pulled it out about 30 minutes ago and all the floating bits dissolved again.  I transfered it into a glass pan and will try again.
DMT,37p8yr,cautiouschemist,2,Fri May 29 12:19:57 2015 UTC,Cover the pan with cling wrap!!! If not when you pull it out of freezer condensation will form on the inside of the pan... when your ready pull the pan out quickly but carefully pour the naptha In a jar the set pan face down on a towel and drip drip for 1-2min then prop up facing a small fan on low. Let set like this for 20min it will dry the leftover naptha off. Scrape pans and I recommend placing the scraped dmt on a brown lunch bag to pull that last bit of moisture out then scoop into container and enjoy
DMT,37p8yr,cautiouschemist,1 point,Fri May 29 12:24:40 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I vomited on my cling wrap the other day threw it away.  I'll have to go get some before I pull it out I guess.
DMT,37p8yr,smokinjoe65,3,Fri May 29 12:29:47 2015 UTC,Should be wrapped before putting in freezer
DMT,37oygl,Adillionaire,2,Fri May 29 06:47:36 2015 UTC,"Hey OP,  When I first started trying DMT a couple years ago, I bought myself a GVG and read online that the slower you inhale, the hotter the vapor would be (thus, vaporizing more DMT). I went forth and wasted a ton of DMT by just inhaling incredibly slowly...only enough for the flame (from a regular bic lighter) to barely lick the inside of the bowl from the force of the pull. The effect of the trip was powerful, but minimal....more like a strong mushroom trip. I did this about a dozen times, and always felt underwhelmed by the trips I would have.  Then after a while I realized I was doing things totally wrong. I began pulling much harder (a real sucking motion rather than just a faint pull) and instantly had a breakthrough on just residue.   After that point I always made sure to always pull fairly hard and would always break through. So, maybe you're just not pulling properly."
DMT,37oygl,zinklefax,1 point,Sat May 30 04:03:08 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine the main difference between the gvg and the regular vg is the fact that you can see the vapor building in the gvg. I have a gvg so take this advice with a grain of salt... I'd say hit it slowly for 5-10 seconds and then clear it. If that doesn't work, extend it a bit more. Good luck! Hope it works out well for you :)"
DMT,37oygl,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri May 29 06:57:23 2015 UTC,Use a torch lighter. What are you using to hold the dmt in the bowl?
DMT,37oygl,Molestador,1 point,Fri May 29 08:48:26 2015 UTC,"A little bit of weed in the bowl, sprinkle the DMT on top of it, then screw the top back on. Lighter and inhale with intent. Not too slow but don't rip it either, you'll put out the flame. Let it heat up and vaporize and enter your lungs. Rinse and repeat."

DMT,37nop7,TheUnknowingOne,1 point,Fri May 29 07:59:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Maybe you should check out Bashar's channelings on youtube, the concept is quite bizar, this man claims he can let an ET speak through him telepathically and he does interesting Q&As in front of a crowd for living.  I know this certainly sounds like some weird scam but I personally 'know' that there is something out there beyond our knowledge that he can channel, the reason why I say this is because I had a dream in where I died and asked to see one of the civilizations he talked about, I was guided into space and went through this big eye.   A week after that dream bashar talked about these civilizations again and he showed drawings as to what the symbols are for these civilizations, and low and behold, the civilization that I asked to see in my dream (Sirius) had an eye as their symbol.  So worth checking out I would say, he has mentioned these tall slender Greys as well."

DMT,37mhqu,samwoolfe1,1 point,Thu May 28 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"This is great, and true. Through the meditative breathing technique you can let the dmt come in without it hitting the brain. This experience, I wrote down. Might share it after a few more revisions. The connection to your story is this. The part where dmt was (my legs, starts in the feet) got scanned and healed, but I was just lying in bed praying to a god which presence I could feel, my third eye was open but the rest of my brain was unaffected so it was regular 3 (2) dimensional view, so I saw the god as his cells overlapping. I think these are the dmt elves. Entities can move through these elves, I don't know what to call them but gods. I talked (thought) to it... TLDR Had enough dmt to see the elves, but not enough for the dmt experience. Felt my ""healing experience"" sober."
DMT,37n7n4,BestUndecided,3,Thu May 28 21:39:04 2015 UTC,"Clearly the energy within you is manifesting itself vocally through you. Instead of trying to control it, attempt to embrace it. Hum, Chant or Sing. Find sounds which resonate with you. Explore Mantras. Practice them when you're sober and then apply them when you're in the state."
DMT,37n7n4,Namraja,2,Thu May 28 22:19:33 2015 UTC,Interesting thought. I can't seem to formulate words in that state but maybe itd be worth trying to start a chant before inhaling and attempt it after exhaling my last hit . possibly record the chant and have it play the duration of my trip would be a good way to focus it and keep me repeating it throughout
DMT,37n7n4,Namraja,2,Thu May 28 22:47:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, having a recording of a mantra would be a great way to focus. I personally love this album: https://luxmoderna.bandcamp.com/"

If it has some impurities (if you are buying off the street opposed to the DNM) it will have a slight yellow color. Nobody is going to give you crack or heroin instead of DMT... That's not how it works. I didn't even buy it until recently, it's mostly about sharing the experience, not buying it."
DMT,37jqsy,Scobufffff,2,Thu May 28 04:53:22 2015 UTC,I'm not doing it with the people I'm buying it from. They're probably going to be sketchy though so I don't trust them not too.

DMT,37jqsy,Molestador,1 point,Thu May 28 11:46:04 2015 UTC,"DMT can come in a fairly broad spectrum of different colors.. white, yellow, red. white is the purest but that doesn't mean it is the strongest. yellow/gooey DMT is not necessarily 'bad' DMT, but it is likely to contain other alkaloids that will affect the effects given from the drug. the best way to make sure it is DMT would be to get a test kit.. but a good giveaway is the 'plastic' smell it gives off. not really any other drugs smell like it. hopefully the people aren't sketchy and don't mind you asking questions.. in my experience people dealing psychedelics are a lot more friendly, open, and approachable than your typical 'drug dealer.'"

It has not been good. But things have changed and I'm now in a good frame of mind. The urge came upon me to partake tonight and it was amazing. Just fucking amazing.   So my advice would be: when you start to feel different, or when you feel the urge, go for it. It lasts for 15 minutes. Those fifteen minutes can show you so very much, only to take it away moments after you come down. Again, there was so much I felt I learned in the peak of my recent experience but as I became more sober it became so much harder to hold onto those ideas or truths, and even harder to articulate them.  This stuff is amazing but it is not something to be taken lightly. DMT is an amazingly powerful substance and I hope that someday we will find out what it really is. Much love. Happy travels. Wow I'm still just so fucking jazzed off this last experience! Fuck yeah."

DMT,37ghm2,spuncookie,3,Wed May 27 20:24:14 2015 UTC,There's no WAY to do it right wrong. Feel it out and do what makes you feel at peace with the moment. I suggest taking a pretty good sized bong rip or two and making sure to hold it in until you can't anymore/are tripping extremely hard. No work-up required.

DMT,37dfux,reverendsrevenge,7,Tue May 26 20:39:12 2015 UTC,"nice report (I wouldn't put the name of who you got it from in the post though ; P).   Your experience sounds quite similar to mine, especially in terms of the orgasmic feelings produced when they 'enter' you. As for related avenues of research you might enjoy based on your experience (as it was so similar to mine) - I think the whole thing when they appear to move into you is related to the surgery theme you find in a lot of trip reports. The amount of reports I've read of this nature are astounding, it seems to be a common theme.  To go deeper, it seems to be related also to the shamanic initiation experience detailed in a lot of the literature on the subject; the idea of being worked on spiritually in some way and coming out of the other side with 'cleaned pipes', so to speak.   As for the nature of the experience and its reality status - honestly, the strange knowledge you can get from that place, and the way it can transform your perception of the world is so vast, that the question doesn't really matter imo.   Also, I too shot down some tunnels at an immense speed before coming out into a space that is either white/black, but I can't remember which (maybe it was both)."

When lights trigger an epileptic seizure, it's a physical, outside influence acting upon certain sensory input areas of the brain, which somehow results in a seizure.   If an epileptic individual could go into seizures from stimuli experienced during a DMT trip, does this mean that the part of our brain associated with sight is actually perceiving said stimuli (as opposed to a manufactured hallucination that originated in a part of the brain not associated with sight), or is there an exception to the rule of thumb that excessive visual stimuli can trigger epileptic seizures?"

I don't want to argue about the reality of the dmt experience, and if that is what you mean by hyperspace not existing, disregard this entire reply. However hyperspace in the world of physics is a valid and a necessary mathematical concept since the days of Einstein, and it is quite logical if you think about it.  Albert Einstein in 1915 introduced the idea that gravity is to be explained as the warping of four-dimensional (4-d) spacetime. Whatever doubts physicists had - and there were many - about the reality of the 4-dimensionality of spacetime (as a unified geometrical whole which could be warped) were erased by the dramatic verification of Einstein's gravity theory (called the General Theory of Relativity) in 1919, when a group of British astronomers led by Arthur Eddington measured the bending of starlight grazing the sun during a solar eclipse. That same year, Theodore Kaluza, a Polish physicist, came up with the idea that not only the Einstein gravity theory but also electromagnetism, including the electromagnetic theory of light due to James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1979), could be derived from the assumption that spacetime is actually a warped 5-dimensional geometric structure. With Einstein's help, Kaluza's 5-d theory was published in 1921.  The decade of the 1920s was the most revolutionary decade in physics and astronomy. I will mention only the highlights. In quantum physics: deBroglie's wave-particle duality; Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, and the uncertainty principle; Bohr's complementarity principle; Pauli's exclusion principle; Schroedinger's wave function equation; Dirac's antimatter equation (which unified quantum theory and Einstein's special relativity). In astronomy: Eddington's theory of the internal constitution stars (including the sun); the discovery of galaxies beyond the Milky Way galaxy; Friedmann & Lemaitre's theory of the expansion of the universe; Hubble's observations verifying the expansion of the universe.  In the midst of this revolution, Einstein contributed seminal papers on the statistics of quantum theory and the stimulated emission of photons from atoms. These papers led to many later developments including the laser. But Einstein was primarily interested in what he called ""Unified field theory,"" which meant the unification of gravity with electromagnetism. Kaluza's 5-dimensional version of such a unified theory was an amazing achievement, but it had the major flaw that it could not explain why we don't see the 5th dimension (which is supposed to be spatial). Another flaw was that it said nothing about the new quantum mechanics which was exploding throughout the 1920s.  The Swedish physicist Oscar Klein in 1926 spoke to both these questions by publishing his version of the 5-d theory, in which the 5th dimension is not visible to us because it is an extremely small compact dimension; in other words, each point of 4-d spacetime is replaced by a tiny circle whose radius is around 10-33 cm. This is the Planck length, which is named for Max Planck who defined this size as the basic unit of size in the quantum world. The Planck length is 20 orders of magnitude smaller than a proton (10-13 cm): so if the 5th dimension is. a Planck length circle, it is no wonder we can't walk around in it; not even a proton could do that!  Klein's Planck-length circle, as a candidate for the 5th dimension, entailed both Einstein's general relativity (applied to 5-d spacetime) and quantum theory to provide the smallness of the extra dimension. As a bonus, the theory provides a geometric explanation for the quantization of electric charge; that is why every electron carries the same charge.  This 5-d theory called Kaluza-Klein theory was forgotten in the world of physics for several decades during which the frontier of physics became the exploration of the nucleus of the atom, where two new forces were discovered: the strong and weak nuclear forces. The strong force holds the nucleus together against the electrical repulsion of the constituent protons, all carrying an identical positive charge (remember: like charges repel). The weak force causes the most common type of nuclear decay - changing one type of atom into another in a kind of 20th century alchemy. These forces were exciting things to explore, and it was obvious that any proposed ""unified field theory"" would be incomplete without taking them into account. In his last two decades, Einstein (1879-1955) was a revered grandfather figure, who was widely believed to be out of touch with the frontiers of physics - persisting in his doubts about the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics, and his fervent pursuit of the holy-grail of physics ""the unified field theory.""  It was quite a surprise to physics that by the 100th anniversary celebrations of Einstein's birth, a truly unified theory had arisen: superstring theory. Discovered in 1971 (by Raymond, Neveu and Schwarz), it required 10-dimensions of spacetime! Physicists suddenly began to read the old 5-d Kaluza-Klein theory papers (and translated them into English). In 1975, Sherk and Schwarz showed that superstring theory unifies both Einstein's theory of gravity and quantum mechanics, and also provides for the unification of all the forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. During the Einstein celebration-year 1979, John Schwarz teamed up with Michael Green, and together (over several years,) they proved that superstring theory is a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity, which includes General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics as sub-theories. This was published in 1984 and created a sensation in the world of physics. Many (especially younger) physicists immediately jumped on this ""bandwagon,"" so that today unified field theory - the gleam in Einstein's eye - is a vast industry in physics. This is why physicists take the notion of hyperspace (10 dimensions of spacetime) seriously.  Hyperspace as a word means a space of more than three dimensions was coined in the 1890s by mathematicians, who were exploring the geometries defined by Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) which were not only non-Euclidean (with any degree of warping--called ""curvature""), but also were spaces of any number of dimensions. Riemann, himself, even proposed that curved (non-Euclidean) 3-d space might account for gravity. He was almost right. Einstein in 1915 showed that gravity could be accounted for by a curved 4-d spacetime.  In order to describe this hyperspacetime as well as other spaces that must interact with it, some of the most arcane (and beautiful) discoveries in recent mathematics must be utilized by the physicists. It has been my contention that the powerful unification of mathematical categories afforded by the A-D-E Coxeter graphs is the most appropriate tool to use in the modeling of unified field theory that is, the truly unified theory afforded by superstrings, and their recent generalization to membrane theory. An A-D-E Coxeter graph (named for the Canadian mathematician H.S.M. Coxeter (1907- ) is a set of nodes joined by lines in one of three patterns:  Thus there are an infinite number of A's and an infinite number of D's, but only three E's. These graphs, simple as they seem, are the most powerful tools to explore hyperspace. The number of nodes in a diagram is the number of dimensions in a kind of space, which I call a reflection space, and Coxeter calls a kaleidoscope, but which most mathematicians call ""the dual space of a Cartan sub-algebra of a Lie algebra.""  In 1935, Coxeter devised these diagrams to describe hyperdimensional generalizations of the Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron) and other highly symmetric geometrical objects, which he called ""polytopes."" It is reflections in hyperspace mirrors that transform these polytopes into themselves. But lower dimensional polytopes are substructures in higher dimensional polytopes, and the Coxeter graphs, which generate the mirrors for these reflections, control, by their hierarchical structure, the embedding of lower dimensional polytopes in the higher dimensional polytopes. This implies also that the lower dimensional objects are projections of the higher dimensional objects.  Physicists became interested in these graphs when they discovered that the observable charges (electrical, weak, and strong) associated with particles - and thus defining the particles - correspond to the vertices of polytopes described by these Coxeter graphs. Moreover, in superstring theory, which brings gravity into the unification picture, it is necessary to embed the polytopes describing the particle charges (A4 and D5 for example) in the E-type petlytopes. This has everything to do with the 10-dimensionality of spacetime in superstring theory. In fact in the E8 version of superstring theory, the 8 nodes of the E8 graph correspond to the 8 vibrational degrees of freedom of the ""worldsheet"" swept out by the vibrating superstrings - analogous to the worldline traced out by a point particle. Thus the 2 dimensions of the worldsheet itself, plus the 8 dimensions of worldsheet vibrations (whose harmonics are particle states), add up to the 10 dimensions of spacetime.   TL;DR: Lower dimensional objects are projections of the higher dimensional objects, just like a shadow is a 2-dimensional projection of a 3-dimensional object."
DMT,3740lo,Luxjur,2,Sat Jul 4 22:39:22 2015 UTC,"Of course, the idea of hyperspace goes way back to Plato (427-347 B.C.), who suggested in his Cave allegory, that we are like prisoners of the 3-d world, identifying ourselves with our 3-d shadows, rather than the hyper-dimensional creatures we really are. Plato never used the word hyper-dimensional, but the idea is clearly in his story of the projection of the prisoner's shadows (a 2-d projection) on the cave wall. The prisoners because they are so securely chained, come to identify themselves with their shadows cast by a fire behind them; and they believe they, as shadows, are interacting with the shadows cast by people walking behind them. One of the prisoners breaks free of his chains and escapes to the world outside the cave, where he sees the full 3-d world. He can now really interact with the other 3-d people and objects. However, he goes back to try to rescue his former fellow prisoners. They mock him and challenge him to tell them what he thinks he sees in their shadow world. Because he has been in the bright sunlight outside the cave, his eyes- are not as keenly. adjusted to the dark shadow-world in which his fellow prisoners live. They can make out the details of the shadows better than he can. This proves to them that he is merely mad."

There are many causes for seizures, and only some result in a diagnosis of epilepsy. The most common cause for epileptic events is focal activity in some portion of the brain that escalates when that particular area is used. Focal activity can have a physiological root cause like a lesion or scar tissue from a past injury, but can also be much more difficult to pin down.   As this was a single event, I would guess that the doc would write it off as drug induced and not do much more unless there was another event unassociated with drug use.

I pissed myself once on deem, which I kinda got away with as everyone else was on it and it seemed so unlikely that I would do so they assumed I'd just spilt my beer but, after unzipping the trip, I recalled doing so.  If you've ever played World of Warcraft, I was rather quickly teleported to the Chess room in Karazhan. I had Loki as my guide and he, along with the rest of the entities, explained a few things to me.   I felt a strange discomfort which I didn't understand. They reminded me that I was safe so, if the discomfort I was feeling could be resolved, then it's perfectly safe to do so.   I couldn't fault their logic so I pissed myself.  My wife and I have broken through several times (we both actually prefer not breaking through now, just riding the level 2) and neither of us have had any episodes so I'm not sure if it's necessary to have a trip sitter if you've done it a few times but I'd say it's very important if it's your first.  I posted elsewhere in this thread that I've had two friends foam at the mouth... that's two out of around 15 people (at a guess) that I've turned on... so that's a frighteningly high percentage of first time foamers.

DMT,3740lo,BestUndecided,3,Mon May 25 02:48:44 2015 UTC,"It changed my perspective in the sense that you broke through into the realm of a video game, I never would have thought DMT would take you to a location you have experienced through media. It adds new meaning to me for how DMT works. And by the way I read your comment before you deleted it, it was insightful so I'm not sure why you did so."
DMT,3740lo,d8_thc,2,Mon May 25 03:36:57 2015 UTC,Thanks... I just post personal stuff then have second thoughts.   I'm glad you read it.
DMT,3740lo,BestUndecided,2,Mon May 25 03:50:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that one can hypothetically ""visit"" every ""place"" in your subconsciousness or: all neurostructures in your brain. But like in a dream your brain will add/mix places/experiences, so it is unlikely you visit a place that is exactly the same as you would percieve it when being awake/actually playing a video game."
DMT,3740lo,BestUndecided,1 point,Mon May 25 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"That is crazy. I have done it allot, gone through a few grams myself...I was always aware that I could pass out and vomit laying down but I took baby steps and got comfortable with it and eventually started taking huge doses by myself weekly. I am not 100% confident taking it by myself anymore.. I still will.probably..but Ill forever have that thought of not knowing what caused the seizure. It doesn't sit right with me.   I don't do any drug drugs....not even a advil or something over the counter. I only use Cannabis medicinally/spiritually, DMT, LSD, Psilocybin Mushrooms. Specifically for their magic but one of the MAIN reasons is because they are physically safe and shouldn't be doing things like giving you a seizure. Didn't mention this but this same thing happened with my brother when me and him were young we had to take big bong hits and blow it through the ceiling fan...so one time he accidentally took it in the wrong room and had to run to the ceiling fan...once hes at the ceiling fan he drops to the ground and has a seizure. I was freaked out. We went over it and realized it was from the long intense hit + standing up then running then standing up onto a crate that did it lol"
DMT,3740lo,alexanderisme,3,Mon May 25 04:59:24 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience. I understand how you feel. I had always considered myself to be very safe with psychedelics, and it took a huge toll on me to know that I put someone I cared so much for into such a state. I think at the end of the day, things happen and there is nothing you can do to be totally safe, but know that you were there and you kept your buddy as safe as you could.   We can never know how things will turn out. But you acted in the moment and from the sounds of it, it was a great thing for you to be there. Don't keep this beauty hidden for fear of the worst. The worst is rare, and you have proven to be someone who can help someone ride that out. At the end of the day, that is the best we as humans can do; is help those we care about ride out the scary parts of their lives.   If you want to chat about it, feel free to pm me about it.   Below is my similar experience:   I had lent my buddy (lets call him Mark) some hits which he told me he had some friends who were interested. I came up that weekend and he had brought a friend into town who really wanted to try it. We all went back to Marks place and I blasted off his friend who had a really enjoyable experience, and after that I assisted Mark in blasting off.   Mark had not told me that he was on numerous bipolar medications, and furthermore had blasted off 4 times already that week. Everything started out normally. He was laying down appearing to enjoy himself. After a about a minute he started making strange noises, but nothing too unusual. Then he sat up and I approached the bed to keep an eye on him. He started twisting his torso side to side rapidly and I didn't know what I should do so I just kept watching letting him do his thing.   After about a minute of that, he threw himself sideways off his bed face first into one of those hot tubes from heating systems, and fell between his bed and the wall. I pushed the bed over and jumped onto the floor to try to hold him still. He was twisting around and flailing violently in all directions. I held his arms down but the strength of his movements continued to toss us both across the floor.   I tried whispering into his ear to follow my voice. That everything was ok. That he could come back to earth. That I'm here for him. That its ok. It seemed to have a minor positive effect but overall things were looking bleak. I was debating if I should call for an ambulance. Soon after we found ourselves on the floor he started vomiting profusely and I just kept trying to hold him steady and make sure he didn't choke on it.   He then thought his parents had arrived. They were set to visit him the next morning. He was very scared that they saw him in that state and started apologizing to them in between heaves. I just kept whispering into his ear that everything was fine. That his parents were not here. That he will be ok. Meanwhile I was freaking terrified. I thought I had killed my friend. I figured either the trip would end or it wouldn't but whatever happened would happen before the paramedics could get there, so I didn't bother to call them. I was confused and scared, but I knew I needed to be there, on the floor with him, trying to pull him back to earth.   Then he started to think his girlfriend had broken up with him because she had come over and seen him that state even though she had not. I tried to talk him down from that too. We kept rolling around the floor with him popping up and screaming and me trying to whisper him back. We were both covered in his vomit, but by this point he had at least stopped puking.   After awhile he started flailing less and talking less, and seemed to be responding more positively to my words. At a certain point he opened his eyes, and seemed to somewhat recognize his environment. We laid there for another 5 minutes and I tried taking deep breaths to encourage him to do the same. He began to mimic my breathing and we continued to ride it out until he felt he could get up.   The whole thing lasted about a half hour surprisingly. He has never touched psychedelics since, and was very scared initially. After a few months of reflection he has determined it was a positive experience for him, though certainly scary. I felt really shitty about myself about it for some time. I would only trip alone for a bit after that. However, after enough time, I realized that there are factors outside of my control, and I did the best I could given the circumstances. Had I not been there, it could have been a lot worse. I've never had an experience like that before or since, but I know Mark is eternally glad that I was there to help him through it, and till this day he recommends trying drugs for the first time with me, because he knows I can handle the worst it can throw. It seems you can too."
DMT,3740lo,Bunteknete,2,Mon May 25 05:19:00 2015 UTC,Do you think that was a seizure or just a total violent rejection of the trip? It seems like he was so terrified of being 'in that state' and being caught that it could've just been resistance turned to 11? What do you think?
DMT,3740lo,truwhtthug,1 point,Mon May 25 14:16:11 2015 UTC,I don't think it was a full on seizure. I think it was definitely more along level 11 rejected to the max.
DMT,3740lo,fluidfocus,1 point,Mon May 25 19:56:13 2015 UTC,I have seen people sent to the hospital having seizures a few times in my life. This really looked likeseizure. It was pretty violent I am thankful that it was so short lasting. His body was trying to vomit and it actually looked as if he was going to die until I after I got to him and did what I could to help him and then it stopped.
DMT,3740lo,globaldu,1 point,Mon May 25 21:30:20 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure. It definitely sounds like your friend had a seizure.   I felt my friend was more flailing than spasming, so I'd lean toward the total violent rejection angle for that particular experience is all."
DMT,3740lo,Babagan00sher,1 point,Tue May 26 03:52:58 2015 UTC,"I already considered all sorts of variables. We both think had a seizure, after the peak(we compared it to a 3 gram shroom trip) while we were discussing how nice the experience was/is. While still in the calm comedown the seizure started. He actually enjoyed taking DMT...just doesn't know what the heck went on with the seizure, he and I are certain it was from taking the DMT...maybe it was a chance thing all the right(bad) things happened in his body to cause the seizure only that one time. I bet its something with his body/nervous system..just doesn't react well to it or something."

DMT,3740lo,d8_thc,2,Mon May 25 05:49:03 2015 UTC,... and then what?
DMT,3740lo,JustOutOfTheDarkness,3,Sun May 24 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"The seizure stopped and he became conscious again because he was OUT and having a seizure , we smoked Cannabis and then went for a walk. He went to a walk in clinic and explained what happened(without mentioning DMT) they did tests and they said hes fine.  I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT when it happened. I was mind blown...what the heck happened and how? pure NN, DMT that I take massive doses of...we just tok 80mg in a joint between two people. Just couldn't believe it in the moment."
DMT,3740lo,taelor,1 point,Sun May 24 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"well, if he took ""only"" 40-50mg that is really a lot, in particular combined with the cannabis, that seems to potentiate psychedelics."
DMT,3740lo,Wikipodiatrist,2,Mon May 25 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I have epilepsy but have never had a seizure during any kind of psychedelic or drug experience, and I've tripped extensively. Guess different people can have different trigger events. I honestly wouldn't be too worried about your friend or feel too bad. Most people overestimate how traumatic seizures are for the people actually having them."
DMT,3740lo,w00ly,2,Sun May 24 18:55:52 2015 UTC,"Have seen that happen on cocaine and MDMA as well, though can't offer much in terms of why it occurred"
DMT,3740lo,mucifous,2,Sun May 24 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"I've had two friends seize on DMT on separate occasions.   Both started foaming at the mouth while in la la land.   I wiped them, gently tipped them forward and encouraged them to spit to ensure they could breathe.   When they came down one thought he'd been sick everywhere and was surprised to find no evidence, the other had no recollection.  It's not common, but it's a thing that we should all be aware of."
DMT,3740lo,globaldu,2,Mon May 25 00:37:53 2015 UTC,"I am an epileptic, though my seizures are under control with medication. I have taken all the major psychedelics (shrooms, LSD, dmt (pure, changa, and ayahuasca)) and the only problems I have ever had are a massive headache after the third and fourth times doing aya. Never had a seizure. Happy to answer questions."
DMT,3740lo,mucifous,-2,Mon May 25 01:18:38 2015 UTC,I'm too  hot!   Hot Damn!
DMT,3740lo,mucifous,2,Mon May 25 01:18:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't mention this..This info doesn't really mean anything but we were going to goto a forest originally and I remember thinking that's the spot my friend had a seizure at in grade 8( said this in my mind ) so I took us somewhere else. The same day I get home and I am watching a video of adam kokesh inhaling DMT AND my brother(the one who had seizure from bong toke) says....remember when I had a seizure from that bong toke. Out of the blue, I never mentioned ANYTHING about seizures. He hasn't mentioned that for 6+ years until the very same day that my friend had a seizure from DMT and while we are watching a video of adam kokesh inhaling dmt!! On top of that I changed our original course/spot to do the dmt because of the thought of the seizure my friend had in-front of me in grade 8.  DMT and seizure was entangled that day...very odd. Is that not weird. my friend who had the dmt seizure didn't look intrigued AT ALL when I told him about this."
DMT,3740lo,globaldu,2,Mon May 25 05:12:12 2015 UTC,Very odd.   Have you ever had a shared experience / etc with anyone?  Synchronicities abound.
DMT,3740lo,mucifous,2,Mon May 25 14:13:59 2015 UTC,You never know what underlying medical condition any substance can bring to the surface. This was something I read not too long ago and was kind of blown away by it. It was from a guy who was turning his 75 year old mother on to DMT and she had a stroke. He was extremely detailed and it was a good read considering the topic.   https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&t=62514
DMT,3740lo,globaldu,2,Mon May 25 05:35:29 2015 UTC,After some research it seems that I might have confused the seizure with syncope.
DMT,3740lo,badf1nger,1 point,Tue May 26 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"There is another type of seizure that isn't epileptic, though I can't remember the name of it. I haven't ever done DMT, but I have had one of these types of seizures.  One night laying in bed, I was thinking about time, space the universe, consciousness and death. You know, the normal stuff that sometimes you get a little too deep with.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground, trying to get up, but I feel like a broken record, and keep skipping back as I try to move forward. It was completely disorientating and fairly terrifying. I just remember calling out for my girlfriend the whole time, forgetting that we had just broken up, and she wasn't in the bed with me.  I called my mother (a nurse), and described it to her. She just nonchalantly said, ""oh you probably just worked yourself into a seizure. You don't need to go to the doctor"". (that's not to say your friend shouldn't get checked out, just sharing my experience)  So maybe that's kinda what happened, he worked himself into a seizure getting deep in his own thoughts or something.  Main thing is, don't fret it, he's probably OK, but you might want to follow up with a doctor just in case.   Best of luck friend."
DMT,3740lo,globaldu,2,Thu May 28 17:44:59 2015 UTC,"The difference is, an epileptic seizure produces a brief disturbance in the normal electrical functions of the brain, while syncope is caused by a reduction in blood flow carrying oxygen to the brain. A seizure can sometimes accompany a syncope episode and syncope can sometimes accompany a seizure."
DMT,3740lo,TheUnknowingOne,1 point,Tue May 26 02:17:55 2015 UTC,"Similar thing happened to me on 25-I. Posted on /r/drugs, got a lot of shit. ""Safe"" is a relative label somewhat misapplied to drugs."

DMT,3740lo,IceburgersSyndrome,1 point,Mon May 25 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"Sort of like this, but he looked a bit more awake and the convulsions were deeper.

DMT,376rm9,maxwinterao,4,Mon May 25 09:55:54 2015 UTC,"Well this is a hard question,  It would be definetly worth it if you don't know how to extract it yourself.  But otherwise I would pay up to 150â¬ for a single hit.  Money can't buy this expirience.  Your friend should actually gift this to you."
DMT,376rm9,NotTelkin,1 point,Mon May 25 10:22:14 2015 UTC,"Yes I am fairly new to this and I have 0 clues on extracting it by my self, and I understand what you're trying to say about money not being able to buy the experience you're getting from it. I'll probably make a trade with him and see how it goes. thanks"
DMT,376rm9,TheReplierBRO,2,Mon May 25 10:44:33 2015 UTC,"It's worth is priceless. It's also very cheap to make. He's making like a 2099% profit. Something gross like that. If you're speaking in Euros. I'm in USD mind and that's still a ridiculous price. That should be a gram easily, or 30-50 ""hits"" worth. Or breakthrough does."
DMT,376rm9,Bunteknete,1 point,Tue May 26 08:06:25 2015 UTC,"How much mg do you get for 70â¬ from your 'friend'? A 'hit' is quite unclear. And even if a Hit is 50mg, it seems too expensive."
DMT,376rm9,Bunteknete,1 point,Mon May 25 16:37:43 2015 UTC,70 euros for half a gram is his price
DMT,376rm9,RangerRandyFord,2,Tue May 26 18:30:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, thats way more than five hits, seems like an acceptable price for me. Still expensive, if it is really a ""friend"". But a little cheaper than DMT on darknetmarkets."

DMT,37418p,samwoolfe1,3,Sun May 24 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"I've heard stories on /r/psychonaut from people who've smoked cannabis during the tail end of an acid trip, and the visuals suddenly grew stronger again as if they'd just peaked.   On a similar note, my aunt can't smoke cannabis anymore due to the fact that years of meth abuse has affected the qualities of her high. For example, she gets very anxious, and she starts experiencing mild hallucinations whenever she smokes cannabis.   For whatever reason, cannabis seems like a drug that can dredge up past experiences from drug use, or it can potentiate subtle changes in your brain chemistry that are already present, such as the presence of LSD."
DMT,37418p,Corndog_Enthusiast,2,Sun May 24 18:28:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, I sometimes see DMT beings when I meditate intensely when I'm high. I wouldn't call it a flashback; it's just an open third eye enabling me to see these things."
DMT,37418p,hashmon,2,Sun May 24 19:48:54 2015 UTC,Never tried DMT but I occasionally get visuals similar to the time I took LSD after smoking cannabis. Never happened until I took LSD. I get that weird 'crawling walls' and fuzzy vision.
DMT,37418p,Ifreakinglovetrucks,1 point,Tue May 26 00:10:44 2015 UTC,"I get ""DMT flashbacks"" if I'm high enough on LSD or mushrooms.  It's happened when I've been super high before, but I have to combine it with meditation to do so."

As Terence McKenna said where dmt is a bullseye on the dartboard of psychedelics, cannabis hits the edge ;) It's connected. Cannabis can really help dmt hit too when you take it right after. Like when you're on dmt you're a spiritual 10, when you're on weed a you're a 2, instead of the regular 1 (sober, human), that's why you can grasp the greatness again :)"

I just radiate happiness with my soul, and happiness is what they radiate back. They have nothing to teach me. I try not to focus on these, not hit some recursive-soul-bullshit. 2 No, or if they were I apperantly have not looked carefully enough to notice. I did however just notice I know they looked like regular humans, chilling out, just having fun being happy. Sitting or hanging. On geometric patterns which I really have a hard time visualizing. 3 Well... They were not physical so knowing was indeed all they did. 4 Oh it does, after some getting used to. It's distorted but it's relatable after a while (perhaps exercise with weed prepared me). 5 No, but I'm sure I could show myself one. 6 Dmt relieves me of thoughts about suicide :) If one has another truth than you do you can not just change their path, that is what I think. They have to see. But I do not think the soul is intrigued by death, nor that death is apart from nature. But the souls goal will never be suicide, if you let it have one."

They just read my mind and reply with feeling If you saw them, were they a family member, or a silhouette of bright light? Both. My mom as a being made of pure ligth. Some of them are a very warm orange color others blindingly white or yellow ect Were they all knowing? Perhaps. They sure didnt tell me though Did time seem like forever or just time didn't have a feeling anymore?time didnt exist. 1 second or 1 million years had the same value Was anyone shown hell? In a way but nothing like on mushrooms What are your thoughts on suicide after the DMT trip? Do you think the soul would feel cheated if someone suicided because of physical pain?

It feels like time is a stupid concept that makes no sense. Every moment is an eternity   How were you shown hell ""in a way""?   I saw some demonic faces and it was an unpleasent experience.

DMT,374tlx,milkpak1,1 point,Sun May 24 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"Depends what you want out of it. Dmt will shoot you out of a cannon, but it is ideal to have a vaporizer. Changa is easier to smoke, but not necessarily as powerful. It can be easier to remember a bit though because of the MAOIs"
DMT,374tlx,Babagan00sher,1 point,Mon May 25 01:23:19 2015 UTC,"The main difference is that changa is supposed to include an MAOi to potentiate the effects. Without the MAOi, you have DMT Enhanced Leaf. This is my preffered MOI. If you start trying to vaporize pure spice you may waste some as there is a leaning curve to successfully blasting off with DMT crystals. Infusing them to smokeable herbs makes the intake process as easy as smoking a bowl. I've had equally intense experiences with both pure spice and e-leaf but enhanced leaf is by far my favorite."

DMT,372or1,JustOutOfTheDarkness,6,Sun May 24 08:20:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a great experience. Usually the 'afterglow' effect lasts about a week for me, but as someone who suffers from depression, DMT breakthroughs definitely gave me something to believe that there is meaning in the universe and something worth holding on for. It certainly didn't cure me - and in fact a couple of trips have been quite disruptive to real life due to the profundity and integration of them - but certainly it led me down a path of self development (via Buddhism) that continues to this day."
DMT,372or1,TetrisMcKenna,3,Sun May 24 09:30:25 2015 UTC,"That feeling doesn't last unfortunately. But that personalized message that some of us receive (after my first breakthough it was ""you need to love people more"") is something you should take with you for the rest of your life. If it wasn't important for you to understand, it wouldn't have been brought to you.  Ideas buried deep inside of us are often brought to the surface. My judgement and anger towards people took up a great part of my life, therefore that's what came up.  My advice is to remind yourself of it everyday. Remember that everything has a dark side to it, but you don't need to put a name to it. Everything has a light side to it as well. Keep it at the forefront of your mind.  We can have all the breakthroughs we want, but if we don't apply what we learn in those experiences to our lives, then it was nothing more than a trip."

The euphoria dissipates but you can intergrate your trips and experiences into your real life and create a better time for yourself and others. I hope you pass on what you've learned in the realm of hyperspace.    I mentioned this once before in another thread: I use smells, music, and textures deliberately during a trip so that I can use them as tools to remember my experiences in more detail afterwards. For instance - scented lotion, incense, very specific sounds or song, clothing or bedding with different textures, or anything that isn't used in everyday life that you can use to pinpoint what you saw and felt. Doesn't work for everyone but don't hurt to try if your interested in trying to remember more detail."

Let go (as the trip would say (shame, thought, intellect)) just feel :) Sounds like you're on a nice path if you're already taking lessons. And thank you for describing it as a geometric Chinese dragon worm, thats what I was hoping to hear or see one day. Chinese are the only one who can accurately depict dragons because they do the whole dance where they carry it, nobody else got enough people to properly do this en massa but the Chinese, and you might have found the reason that they do it like this :) It always seemed more logical that the european dragon was lazy. And Chinese communism or buddhistic unity enabled a proper depiction.   As per your depression... Once you are getting life-lessons out of trips I don't think we have to worry about you ;) You won't feel the high for your life, but holding on to the lessons are all I need to get me through the day so far :) Made me happy as fck, also after I quit.

But from my experience the trip occurs with or without my intent, observations, or interaction. This confuses me so much.    example:    I opened my eyes during a meeting with a ""being"". I had them open and was blinking. I could see and feel the apartment. But when I decided to close them again the thing was standing there right in front of me. It was waiting for me. What possible explanation can I create?     I just know that I don't know anything. Life is peculiar."
DMT,371dmn,Drometheu5,16,Sun May 24 04:42:58 2015 UTC,"The only way I've ever been able to describe it is like having a dream but better. If I'm in and out its not as good, but if I have a full breakthrough I don't think I've ever noticed or thought to myself this isn't real. It sounds kinda scary saying it as I'm picturing a huge spider chasing me, but I've never had even a slightly bad trip on dmt. My personal favorite was when I was in build a bong workshop. Idk why that isn't a real thing."

Whatever happens to you is just as real as this sober reality. I've went back in forth in my mind debating if what happened to me was real or not. But in my own opinion I would say I believe it is something more then a hallucination, another plane of existence very close to ours but just out of reach of our human eyes. Just my opinion.. If you have never tried this wonderful substance give it a whirl, weather it's real or not does not matter because the experience will be the same regardless."

DMT,371dmn,smokinjoe65,9,Sun May 24 11:47:30 2015 UTC,"100% convinced that what DMT somehow connects us to a separate intelligence, that it's entirely real (as opposed to random meaningless coincidence), and that it's profoundly important. By a very long shot these experiences have been the most meaningful and paradigm-altering of my life. I've had the chance to smoke it over 100 times.   For anyone interested in this subject on an intellectual level, I strongly recommend the book ""The Cosmic Serpent"" by Jeremy Narby. It offers a compelling empirical case for the validity of the literal spirit world that shamans talk about. Narby is an anthropologist and former rationalist who had his world view flipped by spending time with indigenous people who use ayahuasca in the Amazon and then taking it himself. He has some videos up on youtube, if you want a taste. Graham Hancock is also a brilliant writer on the subject- notably his 2007 book ""Supernatural."""

My experiences with psychedelics, and namely DMT, have shown me that there is some subjective evidence. It's like getting a glimpse of the unfiltered universe/multiverse, but the machines that we call brains are not designed to recieve that kind of information- hence why many people are left speechless and find it impossible to describe. Day to day, a sober mind keeps learning how to filter things appropriately for ones self- without those filters (ie- using any psychedelic) you learn more about the living entity that is the multiverse. I think it's quite strange how you can keep zooming out from the molecular level, and EVERYTHING is just a smaller piece to a bigger system.   Quarks > Electrons/Protons/Nuetrons > Atom > Molecule > Amino Acid > DNA > Cell > Tissue > Organ > Organism > Family > Neighborhood > City > State > Country > Continent > Hemisphere > Planet > Solar System > Star Cluster > Galaxy > Galactic Cluster > Universe > Multiverse > Dimensional Plane  I may be a little off in the exact ordering; but my point is, going backwards, each cannot exist without the last. There may be infinite energies that exist in either direction of the scale, we just haven't learned to identify them or their purpose yet. DMT is like shutting off the brains perception of reality and showing you raw data where dimensions either do not exist, or all exist at once. I don't really know. I need to explore more lol."

Also going through my head was, if this is a hallucination, how can my mind create this realm that is as real as earth yet simultaneously create and control this entity that I was interacting with all the while I'm completely lucid. Last trip really blew open my mind. I'll write a report shortly."

DMT,371dmn,indol3,3,Sun May 24 03:29:31 2015 UTC,It felt too genuine and unlike other trips off acid or shrooms to just be a hallucination. Once you breakthrough (or at least when  i did) you have this feeling and awakening unlike anything else. I just KNEW i had been to another place that I do believe exsists or exsisted. I know that probably sounds crazy.  The entities I met and the places I went changed my life forever.
DMT,371dmn,Boomeowww,3,Sun May 24 08:39:10 2015 UTC,"The experience but also reading about shared trip experiences convinced me, along with some other things.  The easiest way to  found this out yourself is to breakthrough with an experienced friend at the same time with the intention of having a shared experience."
DMT,371dmn,AlwaysBeNice,9,Sun May 24 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"There is no question that it is a hallucination. The question becomes, does that make it any less real? Serotonin is the chemical in your brain that causes you to perceive the world around you.   Serotonin is also a powerful hallucinogen with the same tryptamine chemical structure that DMT has. So ""normal"" life could be described as a hallucination. That's where the line between realities gets a little fuzzy.   As far as I'm concerned, anything that occurs within the universe is real whether it happens inside my head or out."
DMT,371dmn,feeling_psily,3,Sun May 24 09:10:22 2015 UTC,"The last paragraph - absolutely agree. As the Buddhists say, 'all is mind'. All we have here is perception."

DMT,371dmn,feeling_psily,2,Sun May 24 00:49:30 2015 UTC,"If argue that there's a vast difference between perceiving something, and your brain creating something. The only damning point to be made here is that there's no way to tell whether or not you're perceiving reality, or if you're perceiving something created by your brain.   On that note, you can go even further down the rabbit hole and say that your brain is essentially ""creating"" everything that your perceive, since your brain processes and makes sense of the sensory input gathered by your ears, eyes, pressure and temperature sensing cell structures, etc.   Really, who knows? This stuff is super confusing if you think about it too much. The only conclusion I've personally come to so far is that I have no way to know what's real, so I'm just going to ad-lib life and live it as if it were real. I apply the same rule to my trips, and I'll just assume for now that they may not reflect reality in their entirety, but they're definitely based on aspects of reality that I'm not aware of without tripping."
DMT,371dmn,Corndog_Enthusiast,4,Sun May 24 01:06:02 2015 UTC,"Sure. But I wouldn't say that at all. The experience feels not only ""real"" to me, but the most meaningful thing I've ever encountered. Also, I've smoked so much DMT, and spent a lot of time meditating on it, so that now, late at night, when I smoke weed and meditate, I often can see DMT beings. It's pretty enthralling, and clearly they're out there- or in there- somewhere. Jeremy Narby theorizes that what we're looking at is actually what's going outside our DNA, that DNA is somehow coded with all this information and intelligence. DMT somehow acts as a key to let us peer into this part of our own minds that we're not normally aware of. That seems a lot more likely to be on the spot than the ""random dream"" explanation; at least, based my experience it sure does."

It's just a question of what it is we're seeing... It's a mirror in a way, but not in every way... This part is the magic. It's always relatable to your life, whatever you think you see, feel or even do. However open you think you are, it always has a lesson for you. This is the part I can't grasp. And finding the lesson is the tricky part! Perhaps I'm just too young and unexperienced. It's like a force pushing us to happiness, or at least dealing with your personal shit, maybe unity eventually? God?  Best hallucination ever."
DMT,371dmn,TheUnknowingOne,2,Sun May 24 05:48:03 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand where these hallucinations come from. What is going on in my brain that makes me hallucinate these entities that literally interact with me as if I'm their guest? I don't understand the geometric shapes that fill my view, and why are they common amongst all trippers? What we see as reality is perceived, and that is known. What proof do we have that there is a difference? But, what proof do we have that this hyperspace we visit isn't pure hallucination. The molecule is already present in our brain. Who put it there?"
DMT,371dmn,cdorce,2,Tue May 26 09:23:05 2015 UTC,"It sets the chemical side of you brain on overdrive. The hard part,where i think most fail,is to not overinterpretate the experience.

Dont get attached ,guys."
DMT,371dmn,daevl,4,Thu May 28 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"I share this opinion as well. But to me, thatâs just what's so magical about it. The whole step from just DMT doing what it does in your body binding to the fitting receptors to the subjective experience it creates is the real beauty. Itâs really a very simple concept: you smoke the molecule, it enters the bloodstream through your lungs, circulates through your body, passes the bloodbrainbarrier, and there, in your brain, finds the right place to fit, not consciously, but randomly, it just goes with the flow (this makes it even more intriguing). And this in turn sets of a cascade of action potentials and electrical currents in your brain that create such an intense experience, from pure simplicity to uttermost complexity. Itâs really a huuuuge jump. The space in between, thatâs where the mystery lies. Attributing this experience to a higher intelligence who created this is like neglecting all of this beauty and throwing it in the trash not to even look at it again. No need to overinterpretate it, life and consciousness in themselves are already mysterious enough"

This is why breakups are so logical for depressions. The connection with your lover can be the most meaningfull thing happening to you because it is the only thing which causes humans in the western world to feel like they are ""overinterpretating"" anything, once you notice you stop doing this, see nothing to overinterpretate, you are in the shit. Overinterpretating is all humans do, love is the only time you notice. Any interpretation is overinterpretation, unless you know the workings. Don't ask us to explain love to you. I'm not god. Although I'd like to add that the materialistic conditioning of love might be the biggest obstacle towards ""overinterpretation"" in the western world."

Now, how does the police knows if you're going to extract or not? They usually don't. You need to give yourself away, they need very strong reason to suspect.

I don't believe in life after death, disembodied consciousness, spirits etc. However, as others have said, it has changed my perspective. I still believe you can be an atheist and have intense mystical/spiritual experiences. I definitely have more appreciation for the origins of religion, i.e. visionary experiences and the way that God is described by mystics throughout history. I know that the experience of 'divinity' is possible and I no longer regard all religious sentiments as stupid - as I might have done before trying DMT.  It's hard to say whether my personality itself has changed because of DMT specifically. However, since my last and most intense breakthrough, which I view as a 'rebirth' experience, I do feel different, but in a positive way. I feel more at ease with the way things are and I'm more interested in figuring out how to be a happier person."

Spirituality in my view is a set of experiences or personal truths that change one for the better or open up insight on self and others alike. I myself am an atheist, but have had what many would call ""spiritual"" experiences whilst using Dmt. I'm still an atheist, but Dmt and mushrooms helped me see that there is so much more to a person than just matter. (Not that I'm implying we have a ""soul"" in the theological sense, but I now know that life is so much more than bodily functions and electrical signals. We all experience wondrous things like emotions, love, sadness, anger, or any number of things that make us who we are)"
DMT,36zhg1,DARKLORDCATBUG,1 point,Sat May 23 23:28:51 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the distinction between religion and a belief in God, and spirituality, is important. I admit that the term 'spirituality' is somewhat tainted, since it seems to imply a belief in spirits, however it is an appropriate phrase to describe a certain unique set of experiences and beliefs. For me, spiritual/mystical/transcendent experiences are those which are qualitatively distinct from all other experiences - they cover mental states such as self-realisation, bliss, ego loss, ineffability etc. None of these mental states imo are inconsistent with a lack of belief in God."
DMT,36zhg1,samwoolfe1,1 point,Sun May 24 05:21:40 2015 UTC,No. Atheism by definition rejects the concept of a (personal) god/supernatural beings.

But there is a lot of change towards the concept of spirituality in atheist discourse recently. I am writing my phd on that topic :)

Everything is there already. I think you won't learn something new but look very deep inside the available information pool of your brain.
DMT,36zhg1,ArmouredRat,2,Sun May 24 21:07:52 2015 UTC,"breakthroughs are just inherently spiritual/religious for some reason, there's no escaping it. Imo, you should only smoke DMT if you really really feel a pressing need to take head on the mysteries of the mind/reality/consciousness. Once you've had some of these high dose experiences, there's no going back to the world you once knew in a lot of cases. For most people this transformation involves a lot of new and often joy-inducing realisations often involving feelings of oneness, ultimate understanding, boundless love etc. But many people also face a lot of new problems from this change - feelings of meaninglessness, feelings of depersonalisation, feelings that you're living in a dream (of course, you probably are living in a dream, so the feeling is understandable ; P).  So yeah, in conclusion, just be sure you are ready for an unavoidable personal transformation if you mess around with breakthrough doses. Of course you could always just take a small dose without any major belief changes I would have thought."
DMT,36zhg1,daevl,2,Sat May 23 21:10:38 2015 UTC,Yes. When i set up one of my trips i was all focused about myself. At one point i just fell into a pure white blank ocean which was me. It's basicaly about your mind setup and a perspective you want to observe. Just because many have a spiritual experience doesnt mean you want or need one.

For dancers, it makes dancing flow unbelievably. Painters, paint. Musicians get into it with deep musical states (see jimi hendrix) athletes can enter into it as well.  This has also been the case with DMT, but DMT has something else unique to it. I too have had the ""automatic, not completely my body or volition"" feeling, as if something is picking me up and moving me around. I firmly believe that in many of these instances, communication is occurring with an entity, and while the entity is not communicating through words or images, it is communicating through movement as well as giving your  body a download. These DMT experiences have DRASTICALLY effected and propelled my dancing and object manipulation forward, and have distinctly felt like something was dancing with me, through me, and in me. Then as the effects wear off more and more, I am left in that magical flow state for the entirety of the comedown and it often lingers after for a good bit.  This has been one of the main reasons I have always connected so deeply with the molecule. I am excited to see that you experienced something similar and hope you get the opportunity or feel inspired to explore it further."

The next highest grossing day was just over half the number of new subscribers.  On a side note, when did you join up? And why?

I came over to reddit cause I knew it has a sub about everything and was happy to find /r/dmt ! I lurked for those 2 years, becoming absolutely FASCINATED by trip reports. Then I started doing broader research on DMT and continued to be more and more blown away, and become more and more enthralled by this simple molecule with such enormous power. I just recently came ""out of the shadows"" on this sub and have been posting and commenting pretty frequently now. This sub is truly MY HOME on reddit. I love the topics, and the community. Thanks to this sub and the huge amount of information on it, I am soon to do my first extraction and trip. So excited to become a TRUE /r/dmt member soon!  Edit: bucket list sentence."

Every day I read a post or see some artwork which in some sense takes me back to those experiences. I'm very grateful for that!  Also, I had done some drawings which reminded me of DMT and wanted to find out if anyone thought the same. The fact that so many people did really took me by surprise and encouraged me to keep drawing.   This is definitely one of my favourite subs :)"

DMT,36xtre,Dail_Up_Baby,1 point,Fri May 29 11:14:52 2015 UTC,"I am very curious.  I have tried various things but not DMT  I am a hardcore skeptic in life. I used to be a devout Christian turned atheist as I studied history, science, philosophy.   Then I hear about this drug. One that people swear makes them talk to aliens or some other dimensional being.    So I a here seeking some evidence. Some some curiosities. to determine the difference between burnout hippies vs logical people.  Do they agree? What do they agree on?   I don't believe perception is enough to say something is real. I may think that I saw a blue car today.... But if all my friends say it was green... I could have been wrong. I have been wrong. I could see a picture of it later and realize I was wrong. EVEN IF I SWORE I was right.   So.... Before I enter the DMT world. I want to read what people are saying. Decide if I want to go there.  I am a heavy and deep thinker. I am logical and can think levels deeper than most.  I am good at sympathizing. I am the type of person that would probably enjoy it. But want to see where it will take me."

DMT,36xh4p,Channing303,2,Sat May 23 01:27:20 2015 UTC,This has been something I have thought about alot lately. I feel stuck in my life and sometimes think about a change of scenery and working with and getting to know more about the plant that has helped me so much. Colorado and the surrounding states have some amazing scenery too and I would love to have a base  to set out from and explore all that.    Can you elaborate on the process a little bit? Is the field saturated with people trying to get the same jobs?
DMT,36xh4p,Jattopotamus,6,Sat May 23 08:02:06 2015 UTC,"No prob. If you were to move here, establish residency, then you can apply for your badge ($75). You will qualify so long as you do not have any drug-related felonies and are not delinquent in payments to any government agencies. From there you can enter the job force through entry-level positions such as trimming, packaging, receptionist or bud tender. So long as you can demonstrate in your resume that you have skill sets, can stick with a job for a decent amount of time, or even have a good education, it shouldn't be too difficult. I thumb through hundreds of resumes a month and so it's important to stand out with a properly formatted resume. If you can't get work through applying with dispensaries, I would suggest getting on a trim crew through a temp agency like Hemp Temps or Shear Solutions. It will help you build experience and get your foot in the door elsewhere. Entry level jobs should start at $12/hr, so don't settle for anything less unless you are desperate for work. Rent has skyrocketed in Denver so I would suggest looking for a roommate on Craigslist.  Let me know if you have any other questions!"

If you were asked to describe the magnetic-field-sensing hallucinations you get you wouldn't be able to. Of course, this is different for people who were blinded after their visual cortex fully developed."

DMT,36vnt1,LSDkiller,2,Fri May 22 14:12:24 2015 UTC,I dont want to smoke freebase as i dont want to waste any DMT and dont have a vaporgenie. Im sure i would fuck up vaporising it anyway. plus making dmt spliffs seems appealing to me.
DMT,36vnt1,UncleDemon,1 point,Fri May 22 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"It should work, just make sure to use acetone that's  has nothing else in there, and it'll be probably better if you use a bong, you won't feel much with the spliff"
DMT,36vnt1,PhillipStein,2,Fri May 22 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"thanks, Ill definitely try it. i just hate the idea of smoking acetone straight or some shitty impurity, especially in a bong you might not notice until its too late. does it always evaporate completely or can there be residue? how long do you have to wait to be sure?  Another DMT- related question- is it very visual at low-mid doses? or is the visual-mindfuck ratio similar to Acid or mushrooms? I honestly dont enjoy high doses of psychedelics, but i do love the visuals you get from them. i figure since DMT produces full blown panoramic hallucinations at breakthrough doses, it must also be visual at like 15-20mg?  I don't quite think I'm ready for a breakthrough, I am interested in DMT though because i want to see how tryptamines compare too LSD and of course the short duration seems like a plus to me. cant extract because i do not have the necessary working space or means to order MHRB, so i have to get it off a DNM and there are no domestic Changa vendors, looks like ill have to enhance the leaf myself and smoke it in the bong."

DMT,36wvo1,falls330,3,Fri May 22 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"I, personally, would start with 20-25mg and move up accordingly. You don't know how efficiently you'll vaporize it until you try, so it's better to see if you can have a good experience on a moderate dose (fyi I never go over 35mg when vaping due to sensitivity/efficiency... I usually stay near 20mg for breakthroughs and 15mg or less for sub-breakthrough doses). If you aren't super sensitive to the compound, then ramp up the dose. Also, smaller doses are good for perfecting your technique.   You don't need to get so much bang for your buck on your first go since you're extracting. You'll have enough to experiment and figure out what's comfortable for you :)"
DMT,36wvo1,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri May 22 20:25:36 2015 UTC,"Also I'll be doing it with one or two of my cousins, one of whom wants to go straight to breakthrough."
DMT,36wvo1,smokinjoe65,0,Fri May 22 20:31:33 2015 UTC,Well because of your posts I am purchasing a GVG Sherlock. So I'm hoping that makes it much more efficient and much more foolproof. If I do a low dose and want to go further can I do that?
DMT,36wvo1,smokinjoe65,0,Fri May 22 20:28:40 2015 UTC,"Of course you can. The gvg gives you more options for dosing. However, if you mean to take in more immediately after vaping you have a narrow window. Tolerance sets in fairly quickly (~30-45 seconds) so you'll have to account for that when you decide to take another pull off of your pipe. If you want to go for a higher dose but you've missed the window, wait ~45 minutes, maybe even an hour, and you'll no longer have a tolerance.  On the subject of lighters... a Bic is fine, but you'll have to pull a little harder to bend the flame into the filter. Torch lighters are great, but be sure to keep the flame off of the ceramic filter, since it could ruin it (the filter, not the pipe)."
DMT,36wvo1,smokinjoe65,2,Fri May 22 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. Cause I can easily see myself going to threshold and then regretting I didn't go all in. I'm that type of person. And as far as the lighters, I saw that in your other posts as well and was going to get a jet lighter for this. I want everything to be perfect. I've seen a bunch of your posts and want to emulate your methods. On that note, may I pm you about the extraction process? As you can assume I'm going with cybs salt hybrid after seeing your posts and success pics (this sounds so stalkerish lol) but I'm just EXTREMELY intrigued by this molecule and its effects and now that I'm ready I want to do everything right."
DMT,36wvo1,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri May 22 21:24:41 2015 UTC,"Feel free to pm anytime. I check the site regularly. I use a jet lighter, as well. I don't mind toasting my filter if it means a guaranteed breakthrough (I'll just replace it...) so I usually light it, dip it into the filter unit until the ceramic is glowing (you'll see it through the glass) and pull it back so the filter can cool, then repeat. My filter is showing signs of discoloration after ~50 or so uses, but swapping it out won't be a problem.  I lost my lighter, though, so I'm using a Bic for now, which isn't as good for me :/"

DMT,36tfzx,smokinjoe65,3,Sat May 23 01:34:16 2015 UTC,"You should do it, then you'll understand. You have very little influence on what you see, subconscious or otherwise. Things are so otherworldly and weird... I've had dreams about being in a DMT breakthrough and it doesn't even come close, regarding the detail and spontaneity of things you see.  Assuming it is all psychological and chemical is the easy way out. The challenge lies behind confronting the idea that it IS a connection to some other reality. I don't claim to support either side, but the idea that it's an anomalous experience brought on by chemicals, with no other significance, seems a bit jaded."
DMT,36tfzx,Alien_bru,2,Fri May 22 00:23:51 2015 UTC,"Op, thats a bit like saying 'I saw a chicken-scratch drawing of a palm tree on the back of a napkin once, so how do I know that if I take a trip through the jungle, my perceptions and thoughts won't be tainted?'  For anyone that's done DMT, it's an obviously silly question. The DMT landscape/mindscape is so unbelievably foreign and incomparable to anything you could possibly conceive of with your sober mind, there's literally zero possibility of spoiling it by viewing DMT-inspired artwork or reading trip reports before your trip.   When you hear people describe aspects of their trip, those descriptions are at best extremely inaccurate abstractions of the insanely bizarre phenomena they experienced. There's simply no way to put DMT experienced into words that do the experiences any real justice.  Think about what it would take to describe color to a blind person. Imagine your very best attempt. Now imagine a genie comes along and gives that blind man sight. Would your descriptions have tainted or influenced that man's perceptions? No. The immediate saliency of his direct experience of color would be completely unaffected by your prior statements. The same is true for DMT. Your conscious mind is not in control on a trip, and your thoughts have no influence on it."
DMT,36tfzx,Bunteknete,1 point,Fri May 22 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"I do not think it is 'extraterrestrial' in a sci fy sense ... My take on this is: Your subconsciesness shows you entities represented in your mind. Some may have gotten there though experience, some may have been there because of genetic information.  Either way, experiencing your subconsciesness hyperspace is the experience of the numinous. It does not really matter what you see exactly. It's about wow. So dont worry about spoiling yourself... It's close to impossible."
DMT,36tfzx,waxhive,1 point,Fri May 22 09:35:17 2015 UTC,"if this was the case then why do people visit the same entities, the same places.  If your case was true wouldn't we be visiting places that represent us.    This place is extremely tribal for me.  I get lots of geometrical shapes that look A LOT like indian art.  I see the triangles they wore on their headbands, entities from totem poles, owls, and all kinds of wild things.. Sometimes these faces smile at me, once it flicked its tounge out and it rolled out like a fruit roll up, dragging me in and down a portal spitting me out at easter island with totems surrounding me like stone henge.    These are not my subconscious.  My friend during a experience mumbled something about, ""I remember birth.""  When he came to i asked him what he meant and he said he remembers being birthed into existence.  When his conscious was first awoken in the womb.  I imagine when you're a baby before you're ejected out its a long strange DMT trip inside the womb.  Magical shit that is not just subconscious.  Said he could smell the essence of birth.  one of the wild things to me about DMT is that I smell it every where now.. Once you know what the smell is, walking into the woods or whatever the smell is thick in the air."
DMT,36tfzx,ArmouredRat,2,Fri May 22 10:55:22 2015 UTC,"People might see the same things because all human beings share the same genetic code. Perhaps these are ancient evolutionary memories/entities.   One of the most interesting postulated theories relates to Francis Crick's idea (Francis Crick was the man who discovered the structure of DNA, during an LSD trip no less). Crick's theory was called Directed Panspermia - it stated that DNA was too complex to have evolved naturally on earth is such a short period of time, and that it was highly probable that it came to earth from out of space. He postulated further that it was likely that an intelligent race had sent the DNA out in all directions into the universe, to colonise space, and was perhaps even engineered by themselves as a kind of exquisite alien technology for propagating life on other planets.   Thus, some scientists have extrapolated this idea when thinking about DMT entities (most notably Rick Straussman). If DNA was in fact a kind of high technology, then it stands to reason it may also contain messages, perhaps even a method of long distance communication. Or perhaps DNA contains memories of all the different evolutionary forms it gave birth too, up to and perhaps even before the beginning of life on this planet.  Don't write off the genetic-centric theories about DMT, they are just as interesting as the others imo."
DMT,36tfzx,waxhive,1 point,Sat May 23 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"Oh of course, like historic nano technology.  So what you're saying is humans are the first stage of singularity.

I sadly believe that once the first self aware robot comes online it will be the fall of humanity.  Considering that it would be smarter than all humans combined in a matter of hours..   I don't discount anything when it comes to DMT.  The shit is so insanely unbelieveable.  Friends who haven't done it ask me what its like and I try to put it into words for them, and just can't do it justice.. Even seeking out DMT art doesn't do it justice.  Our color palete is nothing like the one i see there.  So bright and vibrant.    One time I opened my eyes, and discovered that the tighter i closed them it was like I was literally projecting images out of my 3rd eye.  I could squeeze them and a vortex of wildness just beamed out of my forehead.  My wife said she thought i was in pain because I was closing my eyes tight then loseing them as I discovered this cyclops like super power.  amazingness!"

Rick: I expected particular types of experiences, as did my volunteers. We thought that mystical unitive enlightenment-like states would predominate. Also, near-death states, since I had speculated that DMT might be released near death because of the stress involved in dying (and DMT in animals appears to rise in response to stress). Also, I had a decades-long Zen Buddhist practice which informed my method of supervising sessions as well as my theories regarding the types of effects I might see - which were the unitive, concept-less, image-less, formless types that Zen emphasizes.  Instead, these types of experiences (NDEs, unitive/mystical states) were very rare. Rather, volunteers described entering into a world of intensely saturated light, buzzing and morphing, full of ""things"" -- all manner of objects, and oftentimes sentient beings who were awaiting them and often interacted with them  Perhaps if I had used another compound for my studies with more unitive properties, such as 5-methoxy-DMT, my expectations would have been met more consistently. But, I studied DMT and this is what we found.   from this interview   pineal secretion during a kundalini awakening or near death experience,    Yeah, that is also total conjecture. There is no evidence that DMT is released in either situation, nor is there a proposed mechanism of production in the pineal."

DMT,36n4wr,hashmon,3,Thu May 21 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, I feel the same way. As soon as I read about the pineal gland releasing DMT and a parallel made between the eye of horus and pineal gland I thought ""Not this again"". Lazy regurgitation of speculation and 'connecting the dots' without citing any credible evidence."
DMT,36n4wr,Dail_Up_Baby,1 point,Thu May 21 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"yeah, the eye of horus shit is more apt for people who focus and dwell on mythos than serious psychonautics."
DMT,36qkgp,bee-ri,1 point,Thu May 21 09:42:39 2015 UTC,"You slip into another place that feels as real as this one, but far more weird and comical. Time is different, usually slower, and you'll most likely encounter entities that seem to be intelligent and driven toward some unknown goal. It always feels familiar, like you've been there a thousand times before, and you'll feel yourself slip out of that other reality quite physically as you land back into your body.  It can be unnerving, but it always ends happily (for me)."
DMT,36qkgp,smokinjoe65,1 point,Thu May 21 10:48:57 2015 UTC,"It seems breakthrough is incredible intensity during the trip which basically names itself. It feels like the point the other trips were trying to reach before you start tumbling back. After the first time I asked my friend to stop talking because I needed 30 minutes to just process what happened, eventhough I had tried dmt a few times before."
DMT,36qkgp,CheesePope,1 point,Thu May 21 11:01:06 2015 UTC,"""breakthrough"", what does it mean?   You'll only understand by experience."
DMT,36qkgp,RedSteppa,1 point,Thu May 21 11:14:14 2015 UTC,"For me personally, I like this description:  ""When you break through the simulation and see who's behind the curtain. Think Truman Show, but with hyper dimensional beings watching you.""  It's as if your felt experience of waking reality quickly dissolves and your consciousness is thrust into a hidden reality both alien and familiar. Your mind (which tends to remain sober) may simultaneously entertain the thoughts ""What the fuck is this!?"" and ""I've returned home. I completely forgot about this place!""  The entities, which are equally paradoxical (they seem both created out of the space and creating it), are very interested in showing you what they can do and entertaining you.  I wouldn't get too hung up on the term 'breakthrough', since people will disagree about the definition. Does it necessarily involve complete loss of body/ego? I'm not so sure.  Others define a 'breakthrough' as just knowing when you've had it. I've had experiences where I didn't feel completely satisfied or 100% convinced I had 'broken through', but looking back, I was not aware of my body or being in a room and was most definitely in 'hyperspace' with various entities. So is that a breakthrough? I don't know.  I think if you come out the experience saying ""Oh my God! What the fuck!"" then that could be a sign of a breakthrough.  Sorry, I realise I didn't really answer your question :P"

Mostly I'm  curious to see what they have to show me on the other side, and to see what they look like outside of the shadows. I really just have more questions after trying it haha, not sure what to make of it all besides excitement and curiosity"
DMT,36por2,waxhive,1 point,Thu May 21 23:18:54 2015 UTC,you did something extremely wrong if you didn't break through with the machine.  I use the machine(modified) I added a piece of hose that comes out of the hole in the bottle and it works magically.  1 Rip send offs.  I also used a wine bottle with a concaved bottom.  It really is the best way to do it.
DMT,36oh7a,OGNexus,5,Wed May 20 21:46:32 2015 UTC,"My most memorable dome experience was during a snorted trip, where I was under a dome which seemed confining instead of vast and expansive. I was on my back looking up and the very top opened up as if it had a lid. A man (old, BLACK beard, like a void, full of stars) looked down into the dome, not at me, and nonchalantly closed it back up. That was the end of that part of the trip.  I know some will say I just thought it up while tripping, but it was completely spontaneous and unprovoked. I am very passive while traveling, most of the time, and not prone to creating mystical experiences."

You will, however, gain new insight and your beliefs may change due to you looking at things differently.   If you reach your breakthrough and find that you want to keep traveling with DMT, I recommend getting a glass sherlock from vapor genie. As far as efficiency and ease of use, the machine can't compare. 90% of my breakthroughs are 1 hitters.  Perhaps my biggest slice of advice is that you should drop all preconceived ideas regarding what may or may not happen in hyperspace. Speculating and expectations will only hold you back from letting the trip take you completely."

Honestly I don't know anybody in real life that has broken through. Even my friends that do drugs, look at is an buried treasure kind of thing, or afraid to go that far.  I'll look into the vap genie, I think the local shop had one for like 70, but that spot is expensive in general. Honestly the machine just feels unnatural, like to much. Sometimes just put it on like the middle of a bowl.  As far as the preconceived thoughts, that's why I feel like I almost did too much research. It's hard to unlearn information. Still I'll try to meditate before hand and clear my head as much as possible. It's seems calm and comfortable is more enjoyable. But my heart always races as soon as get that first taste, really when the smoking device touches my lips. I guess that's part of what makes it what it is tho."
DMT,36nvwz,smokinjoe65,1 point,Thu May 21 03:18:48 2015 UTC,"I do my DMT in sessions of 2 or 3 trips. I ALWAYS get the jitters on the first trip, without fail.

DMT,36m2ym,Orckilla,5,Wed May 20 11:39:28 2015 UTC,Dmt IS scary as fuck. Reality disintegrates inside your head. How you experience this is up to you ^ Let it happen.
DMT,36m2ym,CheesePope,3,Wed May 20 12:50:18 2015 UTC,"Because there's nothing gradual about it. It's a sling-shot, a high-fucking-powered sling-shot. And a concern is, that if you aren't forewarned that reality will be ripped away without warning, there's a chance you will want to fight the sensation. And that, friend, is a biiiiiig No-No.   Don't fret, I get them bouncy butterflies every time I'm about to do it. But once I hear/feel the Om, I just say to myself, ""Whelp, either it worked or you're dead. Either way, nothing else matters because matter's nothing else...."" (or something, because way before that thought can complete I'm gone)."

DMT,36m2ym,WubbaLubbaDubbDubb,6,Wed May 20 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"The Om. The first hint you are beginning the blast off, from the back of your head there's a ""tone"" and it's a sort of hummmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMMMeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEinnnggggGGGGGG.  In other words, it builds and builds and this coincides with the drastic dissolution of normative thinking/reality constructs. I hate to use such a cliche, but, the next thing you know ""you"" are disintegrating into the most basic model/sense/form of existing. ""You"" are still experiencing, though through an infinite-lens rather than a singular perception (ie a human behind two eyes and a brain/mind), and as ""you"" have blended into ""One"" (the Universal Life Web), there are ""Others."" They do A LOT, and everything they DO is a form of communication. They show you things, teach you things, reveal answers, and it would all make perfect (lasting) sense if it weren't for the sheer infinite amount of mind-fuckery (and ineffable beauty) that is being taken in ""you."" It's an overload, and it's inevitably elusive because this ""you"" isn't even built to try and take it back.   For me, personally, I (""you"") completely forget that I am an individual within a single human being meatsack on a planet called Earth in a room that just ingested a molecule and whatnot. It's not until the trip begins to end that the magic-blast that I've become is being sucked back into the jar (body) and making my way back I begin to think human thoughts again like, ""Oh yeah, I'm a person, I took drugs, I should probably open my eyes and re-integrate.""  With my highest dose L peaks (eg 10 strip of unknown dose), I've always felt interwebbed and in the right place, but never truly forgetting that I'm what I am. I like to think that I bring the place to me or I absolve the muck around me and integrate into the L, whereas DMT reaches out of the dimensional heavens and plucks you up and hurls you to where it exists.  Damn it. Now I want to consume everything."

From my DMT experiences I came back with this word 'Spodjik'. It's what I call it. It's One. It's you, it's me, and it's the real nature of God. I remember seeing a visual interpretation of it as an incredibly complex and bizarre amalgamation that represented every facet of every being, like you could see the insides of all our heads all melted together. The weird, the beautiful and the ugly. Everything we are. The word came to me intuitively but I like it because it sounds alien and it's like a word a child would come up with to describe something it doesn't really understand, which is what we are."

Although personally, as someone who's never tried to break through and has just dabbled with low doses and changa, the awe/bliss has been far more powerful than any fear, apart form one occasion where I had a panic attack, but I think that's linked to my natural disposition of health anxiety.  It's not helpful to say people get scared on DMT, I'm sorry you've been influenced by this. Just remember, most people who say they've been scared do it again. Go figure."

Some act similarly in very high doses, but the scary part is that your judgment isn't altered. You're taken out of this reality and thrown into one that is totally strange and complex, and you'll often forget how you got there.  Now, regarding fear, you may or may not experience it, at first. My scariest journey was about 30 trips in, but the fear is short lived. Also, you can attempt to talk yourself out of fear. The BIGGEST thing to remember is that, even if fear finds you for whatever reason, you WILL be okay and things will settle down shortly. The fear will be replaced with awe and love, every time. It is NOT a reason to turn your back on the experience :)  Good luck, be safe and have fun!"

Bic lighters usually require a harder pull to get it hot enough, where a torch does a better job. Sensitivity is something to consider, but I break through on 20mg one hitters with my gvg.  I keep my eyes closed to avoid distractions. At threshold doses and slightly above (what it takes to break through) you want very little distraction. High doses, it doesn't matter if eyes are open or closed.   When you get to hyperspace, you aren't dealing with abstractions or aspects of entities. They'll be in your face as if they were in your living room sitting on your lap. The world around you will be replaced by a context that can't easily be explained and, the best part, the most you'll remember is flashes of images and feelings you had (sarcasm... not remembering sucks...)."

Don't misunderstand this post and think that you'll remember all of your thoughts and everything that was said, because you won't.

DMT,36les7,JustAlva,2,Wed May 20 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"Hi, I had similar feelings. I acquired a small amount through random circumstances and had no intention of smoking it.  I gave it some thought and bought an oil pipe and gave it a go.  I recommend just putting in 10mg, you will feel it but it only lasts a few minutes. I've previously had a really bad time with LSD so I was a little apprehensive, but this felt completely different. It felt incredibly inviting and filled my body with a deep sense of calm. I was sat looking out over my garden cross legged and I can only describe it as feeling deeply meditative and peaceful.  You'll know straight away whether you want to do more or not and if you don't, you'll still be in control of your head and the effects will only last a few minutes.  Personally, I carried on and saw the cherry blossoms in my garden dancing and my grass waving at me with happy faces... hoping to break through next time! :D  Hope this helps!"
DMT,36les7,Bunteknete,2,Wed May 20 08:18:47 2015 UTC,Is there any reason to be scared when walking out your front door in the morning? Yes and No.
DMT,36les7,singlemothers,2,Wed May 20 13:24:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. And no. Google the 'numinous' (Rudolf Otto). Ist awe in its true sense. An experience that is able to induce some kind of fear and joyful fascination simultaniously. But not like a horror movie... So don't panic. Just feel the numinous. It's a fundamental and important feeling, everybody can deal with. It may be instinct."

DMT,36les7,smokinjoe65,1 point,Wed May 20 08:02:24 2015 UTC,"Completely normal to be scared. When I had some I also really wanted to do it, but the anticipatory anxiety and fear was so strong that at points I convinced myself I didn't want to do it at all.  You can definitely test the waters. Start small to get a feel for it. Then just do whatever feels comfortable.  Don't worry, fear and anxiety seems to dissolve as soon as you start smoking and when you come out of the experience you'll think it was ridiculous how nervous you were before going in, and how glad you were that you did it."
DMT,36les7,smokinjoe65,1 point,Wed May 20 08:18:00 2015 UTC,"It's a leap of faith. All of these folks here have given great advice, especially /u/crobar81 and /u/gotstomped. My first experience was snorted. Mind you, I'd never snorted anything and my drug experience was limited to 10 hits of LSD, so sitting there with a line of freebase DMT staring at me was quite intimidating. They're right, however. Once you come back, you'll wonder why you were ever scared. Then you'll go to do it again and the jitters are back :)  Throw on some calm music or nature sounds and LET GO. Giving yourself to the experience is important. Good luck, have fun and be safe!"

I get so worried when reading this sub that certain things may be placebo because the tripper reads about what other people have experienced. Your comment helps me believe that it may be less placebo and more of just a common thread or archetype of the DMT experience.

DMT,36jxxq,falls330,1 point,Wed May 20 05:47:41 2015 UTC,"I had this kind of experience this past weekend actually. I was in Atlantic City (NJ) and while everyone I was with went into the casino, I went out onto the beach and down to the ocean. I just stood there looking out at the ocean, which in itself is a humbling experience. But, the real experience came when i looked to my left and noticed a Black-Headed Seagull just a few steps from me. It was doing the exact same thing as me.. just standing still, staring out at the ocean. Most people would probably write that off but I've been listening to McKenna a lot, researching the different entheogens and theories behind them, and the overall concept of oneness and universal consciousness. When I watched it looking out at the water, I couldn't help but think connected thoughts. Such as, the only thing that separates me and the bird is a difference in DNA. If that bird's DNA was changed slightly, it would be me, or I it. I thought other thoughts as well, deeper, more complex, or farfetched thoughts, but that was the most profound. It was a very cool experience."

I interpreted my ""figure"" to be Gaia, or in other terms mother nature.  Originally presented itself in the form of a serpent, then grew wings and the face of the serpent became that of a bird of prey; like an eagle.  The wings spread open and the beak and feathered face morphed into that of a woman of which I could not make out any distinctive facial features but something told me it was a woman, the wings remained and she led me through my journey.    I also witnessed what I referred to Hawaiian artwork, or even inuit with many boxy boldly filled shapes with outlines and a gap between.  Also very similar to what you have drawn up here.  I very much appreciate what you've done documenting this, I too aspire to recapture and share some of my vivid imagery from future journeys."

So if any of you could provide links to an electric vape or if the GVG is what you suggest could you inform me of the number of screens to use to prevent the liquid dmt from going through the screens that would be great :).

DMT,36g9vb,ComptonCrusader,1 point,Tue May 26 01:05:38 2015 UTC,I`ve also seen some people suggest the Health Stone Vaporizer over the GVG...thoughts?
DMT,36g9vb,ComptonCrusader,1 point,Tue May 26 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"The GVG is basically an upgraded healthstone. The silicon carbide filter is the same in both and thus you can use them in just the same way. Except the vapor genie has the added bonus of being able to vape herb in the chamber. I suggest using a flavor disc from the silver surfer website, get the smaller white one and remove the screens out of the vg.   Heat the stone and funnel your load of dmt on to it. Then place the loaded filter under the glass bushing and make sure it covers the hole and don't let it touch the sides of the glass. You want the heat going through the flavor disc not around it and you want it to do so evenly. Then you can vape it normally and it works better than using an herb base, copper scrubber or stacked screens. Hope this helps, the gvg is imo the only way to vape dmt and i hope you end up getting one."

I found a background picture and alot of different dmt entity  artwork and then proceed to crop all the pictures out and put them into the pic.

Since I can't see I'll just go ahead and ask. Are you just putting the pure freebase powder into the PEG-400 and shaking until it dissolves? Or is  the dmt in an extracted liquid state already before mixing? And I see you said you've been experimenting with flavoring, do you just add that in after you have the desired saturated ratio?  If I made this, I would probably be putting it into one of my RDAs with dual coils since that would probably vape a lot more of the juice per hit.

I just embrace the fact some days are ""snowier"" than others and colors seem..different. It has not affected me personally or psychologically, definitely hasn't hindered my eyesight; if anything I consider these HPPD ""symptoms"" as extra information. Perhaps an extra sense of awareness of what's going on in your nerves, especially since I notice changes in intensity and take that into consideration.

DMT,36cxc4,jonesRG,1 point,Mon May 18 16:20:18 2015 UTC,"Well I don't actually feel too much worried about it, it's just annoying sometimes when the visuals become stronger, I'd like to choose when I want to trip, because sometimes it bothers me a lot, that's all. The HPPD is real, it's not a really big problem to deal with but it exists, I just wanted to know more details about it"
DMT,36cxc4,jonesRG,1 point,Mon May 18 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, good, I can imagine it being more annoying if it's more pronounced. It's really something I've shrugged off; it's possible your symptoms are more pronounced than mine. I'm just happy it's a ""thing"" and has a name.   This may sound off the wall but what I like to do is to see if my current emotions / brain state / thoughts are connected to any change in the 'hallucinations'. Sometimes there are interesting connections and other times there aren't. I never commit anything I infer as fact, though - I think that's what crazy people do (aka truly acknowledging something that isn't there; not being able to determine real vs imaginary).  Some people refer to people or objects having ""auras"". This is how I look at it. Whether it's complete nonsense or there's actually something to it (our brains infer a LOT), it's pretty cool in my opinion. My peripheral vision, when white objects hit those parts of my eyes, it almost takes on the form of white + rapidly fluctuating blue/green/blue/green/etc. It's very very faint and not disturbing in the least. Maybe what it's like after laying in the sun with your eyes closed for a period of time - then after opening your eyes everything has a funky tint to it.  Maybe just me"
DMT,36cxc4,samwoolfe1,2,Mon May 18 18:14:39 2015 UTC,"I think just give it some time and take a break from tripping (both for the possible HPPD and to integrate the previous experiences). I think I've also had something similar after tripping, perhaps induced by a particularly horrible trip. Edges would sometimes vibrate. Rough, patterned or creased objects (sheets, jeans, floor tiles) would sometimes move or flow ever so slightly. And since I see a lot of faces when I trip (not so much now) I would see creases sort of look like faces or begin to look like faces.   None of this interfered with my life or my well-being and there's no reason for it to affect you either. Just give yourself a break and in time it should pass. I don't think it's something to get worked up about. Of all the possible negative long-term effects from psychedelics, HPPD seems the least detrimental.   Changa, since it contains DMT, is extremely powerful, and should be used with caution and respect."
DMT,36cxc4,Vornnash,1 point,Tue May 19 09:16:16 2015 UTC,"I always gave the needed respect to the DMT, I was using it often because a lot of people were afraid trying it alone and asked me to take it with them.

Time will heal it, as will exercise. Get direct sunlight when the sun is at least a 50 degree angle from horizon.  Edit: Here's a link to see when is the sun is at a certain angle, you want to be in the sun when the angle is at or above 50 degrees, the time in the sun depends on how much skin is exposed. It must be a day clear of clouds, as the clouds dont permit the ""good"" light through. If you cant do that supplement with vitamin D3, taken with a fatty meal. Fish oil will help as well, it also needs to be taken with a fatty meal.  http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/AltAz.php"

Make sure that plug is recessed into the neck a little so it's kind of a shallow bowl to put material in. Now pick up the bottle and gently heat the neck with a lighter. You can tilt and turn the bottle just be careful not to spill. The material will begin to melt. Once it's all melted in, turn the bottle horizontally and hold the lighter about an inch from the opening in the NECK. Place the bottom against your lips and gently pull the flame toward the wire plug. Soon you'll see vapor. You can now pull a little harder to get a lungful of vapor. Hold for a 10 or so seconds."

Now you make a steel woold plug, you stick that into the neck, and leave a little space between the plug and the very tippy top of the bottle.  that way you can put your dmt onto the plug while the bottle is upright, and melt the dmt into the plug.  now it is ready to smoke, or you can put the cap back on and put it in your pocket.   When smoking it, use a torch lighter and kinda heat the thicker part of top of the bottle.  NOT TOO CLOSE YOU DONT WANNA CRACK IT.  Now after its heated up hold the torch flame right in front of the bottle but without it touching the plug.    If you tilt the top down a little bit when you do this you will see it start to vaporize after a minute and collect in the bottle neck.  Now rip it while its still lit!"

DMT,369l1a,RedSteppa,1 point,Wed May 20 09:59:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Trying. Nothing wrong with that.  I knew this text already. It was posted on several forums for discussion. Here's some feedback for you from some user who is not me, but with whom I share my opinion:  ""To be clear, I did not post the above because I agree with the author. In fact, I am embarrassed for him in his defensive, seething posture and read in his words a panic after seeing his sacred cow led to the slaughterhouse. His is a religious indignity, going so far as to say that anyone disagreeing with him is less conscious and enlightened than himself and anyone with whom he agrees, an obvious ""no true scotsman"" fallacy. While a relevant counterpoint, it's overflowing with contradictions, showing no end to the mental gymnastics and cognitive dissonance he is willing to suffer to defend what was not actually attacked in the first place. He even refers to the ""emotional prejudices of materialists"" with seemingly no appreciation for the hypocrisy in his position.  This text is however useful in illustrating certain biases against a measured analysis of mental phenomena. It's the same sort of reaction you see to research into consciousness in general, which is an underlying assumption that rational explanation invalidates subjective experience. It's the same for people who read Sartre or another existentialist and only understood the part about the absence of intrinsic meaning, totally missing the necessary conclusion that a lack of intrinsic meaning liberates one and allows one to create meaning as they see fit. ""Random noise"" has a huge part in everything as we know it, from quantum fluctuations to psychic disturbances providing novel insights or at least the thrill of a momentary suspension of one's narrow reality tunnel. Without entropy, which is disorder, there would be no universe as we know it.  To ring in the new year, I vaporized 50mg of DMT as the clock struck midnight and found myself face to face with alien insectoid creatures dancing elaborately, a dance that kept all of this presumably subatomic activity I saw in sync and the universe (which universe, I'm not sure) running smoothly. It was, as one would expect from DMT, utterly astounding. But I'm not going to start putting down others as unenlightened because they aren't hip to alien bugs doing the watusi with electrons. The experience was neither trivial nor objectively true, in my view. There was a distinct impression of intelligence among these beings, as well as the characteristic intention to communicate with me, but it's also possible to stimulate certain parts of the brain with electricity to consistently produce the sensation of the presence of an entity of some sort. The experience itself is authentic, for there is no such thing as a false experience, but there is nothing open-minded about turning the unusual into an unquestionable truth.  Biology and psychology can show us certain biases to the conclusions we draw from our experiences. I've noticed people often have visceral reactions to someone pointing out the finer details of how aspects of the psychedelic experience occur, quite similar to a religious fundamentalist. At the heart of things, people are often afraid that if they shine the light too directly on that which seems most important, they will find that there was nothing active there at all. Never mind that any light you shine will always be reflected back to you. As Frank Herbert so eloquently stated, fear is the mind killer. There may be something there after all and maybe it is stranger than even the goofiest kook likes to imagine, despite it fitting easily within a scientific framework. Anyone who sees scientific explanation as simplifying phenomena has willfully resisted the true complexity that unchained curiosity reveals. The problem is that vague ideas seem complex to those who do not truly explore them, for when an idea has no clear boundaries it is easy to imagine that it goes on forever.  But at least the author has convinced me of one thing: James Kent's book may be worth reading if it can piss off a devotee this much."""

While a relevant counterpoint, it's overflowing with contradictions, showing no end to the mental gymnastics and cognitive dissonance he is willing to suffer to defend what was not actually attacked in the first place.    It is not about defending anything, but deconstructing an argument, and showing it up to be foolish gobbledy gook.    This text is however useful in illustrating certain biases against a measured analysis of mental phenomena. It's the same sort of reaction you see to research into consciousness in general, which is an underlying assumption that rational explanation invalidates subjective experience.    Sounds like schizophrenia to me. You would ideally want the explanation which is rational to fit and correlate closely to the subjective experience.   AND You really think James Kent explanation is rational? Looks to me like he is desperate to find some sort of explanation that fits - and it is not actually a rational explanation. Actually, I find his position to be irrational and my position to be rational.  Lets be clear here. Rational does not mean credulous. Rational does not mean, that which fits within the rules of the present human understanding of phenomena circa 2015. Rational does not mean materialist or that which has cut away any âparanormalâ theory, just because the paranormal is not normal and apparently does not exist according to certain systems of understanding.    Rational is the metered use of logic and reason, it is the ability to think sensibly. Iâm sure JK can think sensibly about some things, about DMT he is way off beam and all over the shop. Hopefully I have made that point clear. I honestly believe the old chap has potential, but heâs too caught up in his canonical decrees to truly and clearly communicate the circumstance.   Unfortunately, the human world is full of people who are in denial of their spiritual nature, and take refuge in their mental faculties, and have little innate apprehension of spiritual realities. DMT gives such people a chance to apprehend what is beyond the mind, and then you have their apparent posterboy, JK posting a hare brained schema which positively look inane and unconvincing to those who have their heads screwed on straight. His views are reactively cognitive dissonance in action.   His words come off as screwey and forced. What he is saying actually doesnât make any sense if you look closer, as I did. Iâd hope after 10 years heâd come clean and apologise for writing such unwise graffiti as if we are supposed to take it seriously.    âRandom noise"" has a huge part in everything as we know it, from quantum fluctuations to psychic disturbances providing novel insights or at least the thrill of a momentary suspension of one's narrow reality tunnel.    The assumption here is that there is such a thing as random! A lot of people (including myself) donât make that assumption.

Oh yeah, please do tell me about how we too can stimulate the brain âwith electricityâ and see insectoids as well! Try 86mg next time, 50mg is just about where the fun really starts.    The experience itself is authentic, for there is no such thing as a false experience, but there is nothing open-minded about turning the unusual into an unquestionable truth.   What about just accepting the unusual as it is? As it appears to be? It is not about âunquestionable truthâ, it is about accepting phenomena on its own terms and being rational about it.   Terence McKenna once said that saying it was not real, was in bad taste, it was just not the done thing. I agree with him. If there is an element of righteousness in my words, it is that there has been a major breach of ettiquette here, a communication in bad taste which should not taken seriously by sensible people. (and generally is not actually)    Biology and psychology can show us certain biases to the conclusions we draw from our experiences.

Unchained curiosity doesnât attempt to dismiss something as momentus and astounding as DMT with a hare brained theory that reeks of screwey crankdom.    The problem is that vague ideas seem complex to those who do not truly explore them, for when an idea has no clear boundaries it is easy to imagine that it goes on forever.   JK is quagmired in wannabe scientism, thatâs the disease of our age, just as dogmatic catholicism was the disease of western europe hundreds of years ago. Both stances side in the theoretical and certain, and that is dangerous to the progression of ideas and the exploration of truth and needs to be pointed out as such.   Julian."

DMT,368f31,dmtprotips,1 point,Sun May 17 10:23:32 2015 UTC,That one may be a bit tricky to get. ACRB works for me because the vendors are in the country. Never tried ordering bark from overseas before.

DMT,368f31,dmtprotips,1 point,Sun May 17 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"Approximately 2% most of the time, never dropped below 1.7%. I use Cyb's hybrid A/B salt tek. With Acacia confusa, most I've got was a little bit less than 1.5%. That is not what is bothering me, but acacia's variability in alk content was real pain in the ass. It is really depressing when you put so much time and effort in bark which contains virtually no N,N-DMT, or yields goo which is barely active. Speaking of Mimosa, it never failed me, it is consistent, and is always rewarding."
DMT,368f31,Feline_99,1 point,Sun May 17 18:14:38 2015 UTC,Yeah not a big fan of having a large portion of NMT in the yields. It'll certainly get the job done in a larger dose however. There are ways to separate the NMT from DMT but when then you're left with very minimal product..

When you're good and calm, take your DMT and relax your body with your eyes closed. This should be sufficient to send you off peacefully.

To answer your question, in the event of having a solution that separates into two different phases (layers) you don't want to agitate it too vigorously. You'll most likely get a layer of bubbles that will be a pain in the ass to get rid of. Also, I've never seen the point in rolling or shaking a vessel. Open the top, tilt it and use a utensil to stir it steadily for a bit. Rolling and shaking a solution, especially one with a high or low pH, is potentially messy and dangerous and not something I'd recommend. I know almost every tek says to roll or shake, but I work at a chemical plant where we do large batch separations and reactions and mixers do the trick (similar to stirring)."

DMT,3641z9,dmtprotips,1 point,Fri May 15 23:59:47 2015 UTC,"Wait, if you're adding the naptha from a previous basic pull to acidic water, you're basically starting a mini A/B.  A defatting step would be adding clean naptha to your acidic boils as the DMT will be in salt form and wont migrate into your NPS. Only the fats will migrate over.  If you have freebase DMT in your naptha and you subject it to acidic water, you're gonna have conversion to the salt form and all the DMT will migrate to the acidic water."
DMT,3641z9,dmtprotips,1 point,Sat May 16 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're 100% correct. It was a mini a/b. Fresh pulled naps into acidic water. I ended up doing it but only managed 2x 50ml pulls out of the mini ab as I thought I had another bottle full which I didnt. Solution turned milky once lye was added. Have it in front of the fan drying atm. I really should've put it back in the freezer upside down and let excess drip off. Instead I poured the naps off and went straight to the fan.

I can't say if this works on a DMT breakthrough as I was taught it during the most intense breakthrough I ever had (which is amazing that a person can learn anything from a supposed ""drug"" *stares at skeptics).  But, I have tried this on deep salvia experiences and sub-breakthroughs. Not to sound New Age... but I was taught the Ohm by the entities, it was never something on my radar. From the tone they presented in the breakthrough I began trying to find it. I found it in binaural beats. Now, as a space rock fan I always found no significance in the two tone ""beats"" but I found one that matched my voice and when I push out a tone somewhat match the binaural beat it creates a very harmonic sound that is somewhat like the sound I heard the entities make me make with them when I was there.  It's made potent psychedelics like salvia and DMT a lot easier to really get into the experience in a more active way. And like Imgodnigga said - they aren't technically ""meditative"" as they are extremely energetic. Humming a congruent tone to create the harmonic OHM is one way of hitting the space highway running in my opinion. But, like I said, a breakthrough is probably a little different - you pretty much know it's on to a billionth degree in the first twenty seconds and then it's probably difficult to retain that focus (with FUCK OH MY GOD, THIS IS IT going through your mind) but it might help to focus the trip."

I think your logic is a bit flawed with the bigger hits thing. I've never heard of anyone breaking through from an herb pen. use ""the machine,"" a crack pipe, a glass or standard vapor genie, dab oil rig, or last resort sandwhich the deem on between layers of ash or other herb(prefer not weed) in a bong or bowl and gently smoke it, trying to carefully vaporize the crystals and not roast them."

DMT,35uvs9,theoriginalcoconut,4,Thu May 14 10:50:56 2015 UTC,I talk to people about drugs if either 1. They bring it up first or 2. They ask me a question about drugs because generally I know what i'm talking about.   I bring it up if i'm back at my parents house if it's appropriate for the conversation. As long as I don't get too deep or psychedelic with it they understand where i'm coming from. They are the type of people that would never touch any drugs so there's hope for others for openness.

They trust that you're not ""crazy"" and are a smart person who they value your input. If you haven't built that kind of relationship with someone and start talking about crazy interdimensional mind travel, they will think you're crazy and it will fall on deaf ears.   Think about it like this. Imagine someone whom you only have a casual relationship with, all of the sudden brings up their religion with you. What are you gonna think? ""This dude's crazy. Fuck that noise.""  Now what about one of your friends, they start telling you about something they believe in that sounds crazy to believe. Do you immediately dismiss them? Probably not. You may not share the same belief or see it from their point of view, but because you respect them you accept it. That's how psychedelics should be talked about imo. With people who respect your views. Otherwise you're just contributing to the stereotype."

DMT,35uvs9,falls330,2,Wed May 13 19:23:02 2015 UTC,"I think the greatest way to sum this up is by a quote from Albert Einstein, ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"". It's perfect because the information that you receive in hyperspace (from what I've read) is simply not understandable for humans. There is no guide to hyperspace (besides ones we make up with our ignorant human language with no basis for explaining these things).  So what you're saying isn't bullshit, it's simply you trying to explain something without the proper tools or ammunition to do so.

DMT,35uvs9,falls330,1 point,Wed May 13 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"very true. I only mention that quote because for ourselves, we also only have our very limited human language to try and interpret the experience, and I believe that we cannot fully understand what is experienced. We can only try to interpret it. Interpreting ot to yourself is hard enough. when trying to interpret it to someone with absolutely no knowledge base due to no experience it makes it even harder, but it all starts at our human brains simply not having enough data to fully understand the experience."

Those are just words that don't actually mean anything in the context of the real experience. Not to mention, words and phrases like that (especially 'soul') turn most people off to whatever you're talking about because they don't fit in to their worldview. I personally still don't believe in souls, not even after ayahuasca.   You have to be as neutral as possible in your initial description so you can gauge a person's open-mindedness. Then you can work up to the speculative, the crazy, the jaw-dropping. You know what piques smart people's interest?

I often feel the same way, especially after my first experience.  I certainly don't bother to just bring it up out of the blue in normal day to day conversation. But when it comes up naturally when talking to someone, it's a treat to convey my experiences with and sentiments toward DMT. When it comes up this way, I find that the person I'm talking to is by default, just by virtue of knowing something about DMT and wanting to learn more, are open minded when it comes to my more out-there views about it. I've never had one of them call me ""crazy"" or anything like that...  (Having said that, if you get called crazy upon bringing it up randomly during your next staff meeting or some shit, I think it'd be safe to say you brought that upon yourself. :P )  Also, I always refer them to an article I wrote on my blog detailing my first experience with DMT. Because that's why I wrote it. Which goes to the point /u/OGNexus illustrated, ""The more I try and talk about it, the shitter I am at explaining."" I found the experience way easier to write about than to talk about. Even having written such a detailed account, it's no easier to verbalize it during normal conversation. I usually just do my best to explain it verbally to them, but I always refer them to that article, telling them that it's much more coherent than any description I could verbalize."

The walls were shifting in amazing shapes and colors as he opened the door and motioned towards what was inside. I looked inside and the door led to a hallway. At the end of the hallway was a real time portal back to earth where I saw my entire family. My ""spirit guide"" filled my vision again as I heard the word ""love"" spoken in a very omnipotent voice.  Ever since then I have took special care to let my family know I love them. I hug them more. Say I love them more. More eye contact. More affection. As a result my connection with my family has intensified and my life has increased for the better.  Another trip I woke up in a house. At first I was put off because I actually recognized it was a house and nothing alien. I started exploring the house and stubbled upon two humans making out. As they started making out I saw their souls merge into one and explode into a fury of amazing colors and shapes into hyperspace.  Ever since then I have viewed sex totally different. I've chosen my mates with more caution and have even turned down some based off the ""vibe"" they gave off. Sort hard to explain because it really comes down to my soul and her soul I think but again, it has improved my life for the better.  Last example but one trip I thought I died. The entire trip consisted of me in a space full of souls waiting to be reincarnated for eternity.  I came back and ever since then have not been afraid of death. As a result I found life. This was the most influential of all my trips and can't even begin to list the different aspects of my life it effected. Also, improved my life greatly.  Hope those examples help but also just remember that what ever you experience comes from you  Happy travels :)"
DMT,35rif5,Imgodnigga,1 point,Wed May 13 04:33:31 2015 UTC,"I was told the meaning of life was 1.   It only takes 1 to make infinity.   My wife nodded wisely and said, ""actually, it's 0, but you're learning"".  She refuses to tell me what that means."
DMT,35rif5,globaldu,2,Wed May 13 05:04:07 2015 UTC,Without 0 there is no infinity? 0 is absence of all things whereas infinity is the essence of all things maybe
DMT,35rif5,pointfiveL,1 point,Thu May 14 04:13:36 2015 UTC,"awesome response. that was exactly the type of response I was hoping for... what you learned, and how you integrated it in your life. thank you very much. And I have read a bunch of your posts, including your mirror theory. I've lurked on this sub for a LONG time now. I thought your theory was very interesting and certainly see its plausibility, but from having no experience, I obviously can't give an opinion."
DMT,35rif5,Man_of_the_Machine,10,Wed May 13 12:41:38 2015 UTC,"Trips are metaphorical, like dreams. All of the crazy shit you see is simply an abstract concept your brain has manifested into some sort of sensory expression.  Like dreams, often you will have wild and vivid trips that seem to make no sense at all.  It takes time, stone cold, boring, sometimes depressing, time to process what exactly your brain was trying to tell you, and how you should incorporate these lessons into your everyday life.   It's not instant, you won't wake up the day after tripping with the wisdom of the universe.  That being said if you totally ignore the thoughts, you feel sort of lost and empty inside. The period in between the manifestation of the ideas, and you implementing them into the real world is the integration period.  Mckenna himself said these experiences are almost worthless unless you can take something back and make it real in this world."

And yet, we spend vast amounts of money stigmatizing people and substances that are part of this effort to expand consciousness, see things in different ways, unleash creativity. Isnât it perfectly clear that business as usual is a bullet through the head?â -Tereence McKenna"
DMT,35rif5,Explore411,2,Tue May 12 23:10:22 2015 UTC,Thank you for the awesome answers. I'd be interested to know what kind of lessons trippers have actually brought back and incorporated into everyday life. The idea is fascinating.
DMT,35rif5,globaldu,5,Wed May 13 01:04:14 2015 UTC,"The interconnectedness of all things. My guide showed me the pre-universe, the infinitely dense ball of mass that was injected with a curious life force. The explosion was a thrill of self-discovery and how everything is life just experiencing itself, to know itself. Even the worst atrocities are as important as a single seed beginning to sprout. Existence is in wonder and amazement at itself, and loves everything beyond all measure."
DMT,35rif5,samwoolfe1,1 point,Wed May 13 14:03:30 2015 UTC,"Not much for me.  I've never really experienced an ego death; more the opposite. Psychedelics have helped me validate myself as an individual person.   I've never been scared of death, only the pain of the transition.   DMT hasn't helped me with that.  I've seen people lose the plot from doing too many entheogens. The only lesson I've learned is to not take anything I experience too seriously."
DMT,35rif5,Babagan00sher,1 point,Wed May 13 05:16:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not experienced by any stretch of the imagination, but I feel like the process of integration after a powerful DMT experience is an active process and can take a lot of time. It is up to you what you take from the experience. Since I can barely remember most of my trips, it's difficult to pinpoint specific lessons or messages that emerged. However, during my last trip for example, I experienced an overwhelming sense of forgiveness and love, which led to an indescribable sense of peace and bliss. What I've taken from this experience is that I should practice self-forgiveness and self-love in order to be a happier person. This is also taught in the meditation practice of loving-kindness. You have to wish yourself to be well before you can extend this intent to others.  I feel permanently changed since my last trip as well, which I regard as a 'rebirth' experience. I generally feel happier, I smile more, I feel more at peace when in nature, and I make eye contact more with people. Also, I have no fear of death, of my body and ego dissolving, since I've now experienced it. I'm curious as to what the process of dying will actually be like, not in a morbid way, but because I'm interested in the conclusion to my 'life story'."

DMT,35rkau,Molestador,1 point,Thu May 14 05:37:04 2015 UTC,Yes! The chemical structure of Dmt and psilocybin are very similar. My sister had a dmt like breakthrough on mushrooms without any prior dmt experience.. As have many others

DMT,35qowy,_EqualAndOpposite_,1 point,Tue May 12 22:56:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input. I have chosen DMT for it's natural occurrence in the brain. I feel that in many ways it is the easiest target for decriminalisation for now. I agree that if the other substances you mentioned were legalised/decriminalised DMT would be too, but I disagree that they would be easier."
DMT,35qowy,ChuntasticMcChun,1 point,Wed May 13 06:39:55 2015 UTC,"As far as I know the endogenous dmt is only a theory, I haven't seen any evidence for it to be proven, it started with Rick Strassmen in his book DMT: The spirit molecule where he theorised that it is produced in the pineal gland but does not state it as fact. Just be careful when stating it as gospel, this in mind I am fully behind the cause!"
DMT,35qowy,hashmon,1 point,Wed May 13 07:04:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for that. That's an excellent point.
DMT,35qowy,hashmon,2,Wed May 13 08:52:38 2015 UTC,"More so than ""legalization"" of DMT, I'm interested in advocating for laws that allow and encourage research into DMT. That, and the more attainable goal of ""decriminalization."" I mean, real talk: DMT ain't gonna be legalized anytime soon - certainly not without a fuller understanding of it, which won't come without a whole shit ton of expensive-ass research.  So I would be more interested in joining a group with the goal to establish and maintain ways to encourage research than a strictly ""legalization"" group. But I'll def subscribe to the subreddit. Don't get me wrong, I would love for DMT, and a lot of other drugs, to be legal. But we need to be realistic. Any ""legalization"" effort would have to bring with it a level of pragmatism allowing for a long term plan of action."
DMT,35qowy,Imgodnigga,1 point,Tue May 12 23:12:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input. I agree. I see this as something that won't be achieved for many years, but that the initial steps can be taken now by those who are motivated. I think DMT/Psilocybin mushrooms as the easiest candidates for decriminalisation initially. I am going to focus on DMT for now because of its already natural occurrence in the brain and it's distinctive effects on the lives of people who have used it."

I will have legal advice and note the process to go about changing the law for decriminalisation. It will look at various tactics that can be used and hopefully a long term strategy will begin to form.

I heard a joke somewhere once that with DMT everyone is holding. How can such a common substance with so much potential to change our world be outlawed. That is the real crime. There are churches in the United States that are allowed to use ayahuasca for religious purposes, can some sort of similar argument be made, perhaps? It came to me in a vision that sharing the spirit molecule is now my purpose and rather than keeping such a thing to myself, I am going to mobilise everyone I can with a united purpose towards incrementally achieving this goal. I'm sure that this will involve drawing on the heterogeneous talents and abilities of like-minded people."

I don't think anyone can provide a rational explanation to that question."
DMT,35pogl,Channing303,3,Tue May 12 18:02:36 2015 UTC,"One could argue that if someone who isn't expecting it accidentally takes it, it could easily cause a spectacularly unpleasant trip that could really damage someone's psyche. If it were legal it would be much easier for this to happen, as right now even people who want to use it often can't find it.   I think it should be legalized, as should all drugs, but I still haven't come up with a satisfactory response to the above besides 'tight control/regulation.'"

DMT,35p7am,samwoolfe1,2,Thu May 14 15:22:38 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, she presented herself ambiguously of intent. So I was skeptical when she slowly walked towards me after I stopped moving in the hallway of light. But she shocked me when she derobed herself in front of me. I was instantly somewhere else and augmented with true motherly love. It is one of my most cherished moments in hyperspace.    Since I was in hyperspace there were more dimensions then my consciousness is used to. Which gave the illusion that her body, her hair, the walls, any texture was continuously moving and morphing.     What really kept me distracted from her lesssons on maternal and motherly love was her hair. I could not, for the life of me, stop staring at it. It had so many dimensions for each strand and galactic colors that I cannot find english words to describe. I hope I get to see her again."
DMT,35p7am,Drometheu5,3,Thu May 14 20:13:32 2015 UTC,Those gifs...very similar to the way the architecture of hyperspace folds in on itself. It sounds like you can remember some very beautiful details of your trips.
DMT,35p7am,samwoolfe1,2,Thu May 14 20:20:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can. The technique I use are my senses to recollect the dreamstate it puts you in. I prepare certain musical tracks, smells, and textures in real life for any trip. So when I come out of it I can reuse them and slowly crawl my way through the fragmented memories I have of the experience in hyperspace."
DMT,35p7am,Drometheu5,2,Thu May 14 20:22:29 2015 UTC,"Very useful to know. A couple songs I've listened to when in hyperspace definitely bring back memories for me.

DMT works through the serotonin  receptors i believe and maybe it can be effected similarly to lsd by that class of drugs?   Just a guess.  Your brain may just not be wired for it that way.

DMT,35or9b,noitsnotmyrealname,4,Tue May 12 07:31:03 2015 UTC,"I can definitely relate to this kind of nervous anticipation. For me, I was both extremely eager to try it again and extremely anxious about it, and was sometimes kept awake at night as I struggled to decide whether I actually wanted to have the experience or not. It's worth pointing out that I'm an over-thinker by nature, so I'm sure not everyone gets obsessed to this level! I think if anything, this taught me an important lesson about fear of the unknown, and how important it is to overcome this fear in order to achieve those 'peak experiences'.  I did eventually gain the courage to experiment with the DMT I had left, as I knew the regret of not doing it at all would be far worse than the nervousness and anxiety involved before smoking it.  In terms of advice for keeping a calm head, I can recommend the following:   Clean your room (or wherever you plan to smoke it) and make it comfortable. Meditate for however long you feel comfortable beforehand. Simply watching your breath, body and mental state will help to calm you, while thinking about your intentions for the trip will allow you to get the most out of it. Exercise. Similar to meditation, after some cardio or a work out (no need to go overboard), your mind will feel much clearer and you will be in a more positive state of mind. Music, which people have already mentioned. Play some ambient, calming music before. Carbon Based Lifeforms are good. Whether you want to play music during the trip is up to you. Oh, and dim the lights, close the blinds. This makes the closed eye visuals more prominent and makes the atmosphere more calming, imo. Right before I actually smoke, I made the habit of saying something like a prayer in my head. You could say it's directed to the chemical itself, to the entites, to the unknown, or to myself...it doesn't really matter. What matters is your intention of wanting to have a positive and meaningful experience. In my head I usually say something like ""Please take care of me"" and ""I'm open to receive whatever you have to teach me"". I think it's important to remain humble, whilst having few (if any) expectations before going into the experience.   Happy travels!"
DMT,35or9b,samwoolfe1,2,Tue May 12 14:37:31 2015 UTC,meditate
DMT,35or9b,Molestador,3,Tue May 12 08:32:49 2015 UTC,"Before going into a DMT trip I prepare myself by simply just sitting there, meditate a little bit. I think about what's about to happen, like you said the power behind it is scary yes. But also very gorgeous and breath taking. Don't focus so much on the negatives focus more on the positives, your about to take a journey to a new and exciting world. That many people would love to experience. If you have everything ready to go and you feel that it may be to much for you, set the pipe down and save it for another time. Maybe some a little weed before, to calm your nerves."
DMT,35or9b,michaelmacic,1 point,Tue May 12 11:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, your DMT should still be fine.   But, its a common feeling IMO for most people doing it especially after you already know its powers. Im still hesitant to try for a blastoff dose again, last time I was told I was not ready by some green lady :/  But everytime me and my friends do it we like to meditate for a few minutes before hand, if your ok with drinking alcohol then a small amount to ease the excitement/nervousness always helps. Most importantly I think is music, some really good chill bands to consider are Sphongle, STS9, Alt-J, Pink Floyd, Lorde, The XX, Sigur Ros, etc, etc..."

I use a steel wool plug, it's coarser, thicker, flat-edged metal, versus the finer, rounded metal wire of Brillo. The volume is one and a quarter ounces. I recommend buying a mini-henne bottle. Get a Phillips head screw driver and a small hammer. I hold the bottle upside down against the floor, place the screwdriver in the indentation at the bottom (it's perfect) and then firmly tap it with the hammer until it punches through. You may need help holding the bottle and hammer if your hands aren't big enough. Have your friend wear a glove if they're holding the bottle."

My friend usually sets it all up for me so  not sure EXACTLY how he does it, but we will smoke the bowl, then put the dmt on the ashes. Then you torch the bowl, milking it VERY slowly. Then take your mouth off, cover the bong, take a breath, brace yourself, then inhale the smoke. If you have to take a break and then take another hit if you need to, but make sure you do the last part quickly, you want to get as much as possible in the shortest time possible."

DMT,35nlck,Subtle_Holocaust,3,Tue May 12 00:03:26 2015 UTC,"Use ashes, sandwich the DMT between whatever you're using as sandwich buns, and hover the flame above really close, basically just make sure its producing vapor without being burned to shit. The flame can lick it occasionally, just don't torch it. You'll get the hang of it I'm sure. Maybe even practice doing it with some inactive stuff like tea leaves or something."
DMT,35nlck,bhoenig,1 point,Tue May 12 01:34:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I should put like 60-70mg in a bowl , sandwiched with ashes, then I take 3 lung fulls, should I pull out the bowl and clear it, then light up some more of it, and repeat until I can't anymore? Do I need to hold in the smoke?"
DMT,35nlck,Subtle_Holocaust,1 point,Tue May 12 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"I try and hold it in from 6-10 seconds or until I can't. And I milk it for as long as possible, which usually ends up taking 2 or 3 hits to clear."
DMT,35nlck,moozilla,1 point,Tue May 12 04:53:11 2015 UTC,"What the other dude said, although if you do it right and do it with that amount you'll probably be breaking through before you can smoke more. But yeah if you want to maximize the effect you get I say get a few good lungfulls, milk it using the tek above, and when you stop getting results with that, torch the bowl, then clear it and pull the slide. This will be more than enough to give you a strong breakthrough at your dosage, if done properly with decent DMT."

DMT,35k66g,methnewb,3,Mon May 11 09:26:31 2015 UTC,"Haters gonna hate :D  But srsly, how?   DMT is a substance without any patent that nearly everybody could extract in his or her kitchen, given the interest.  Yes, he does some annoying advertisments in his podcasts and earns by video klicks on youtube, but that has nothing to do with advocating DMT and other psychedelics. Its not that he is clickbaiting with strange clips like ""awesome secrets on DMT you NEED to know!!1!""  I think the re-establishment of psychedelics is way profiting from his work than he is profiting from talking on this subject. I really don't see any point why it should benefit him to share this convictions."
DMT,35k66g,Bunteknete,3,Mon May 11 13:53:11 2015 UTC,"Not OP of the comment, but I think I share his train of thought. Joe Rogan frustrates me because, although I agree with many of his sentiments, he just kind of sits behind a mic and screams obscenities while telling people to take drugs and makes money off of it. He's not incredibly philosophical about any of it, and his immaturity paired with the occasional disrespect for his guests send a bad message to everyone outside the community.   Personally I see him as a modern day Leary, though even less qualified. While he has the right intentions, he's so extreme and over the top that it ends up damaging the image of people who want to do psychedelics more than it does promote the notion that they can be done responsibly.   That's not to say I don't listen to his show, as I said I actually agree with most of his ideas and sentiments. It's just frustrating that one of the few people who both enough money and fame to be able to spend the majority of their time campaigning for this kind of stuff is so unprofessional in their delivery."

I've been watching this guy for the longest time and the only reason he's ever been in anyway famous was because 4chan used to raid the guy on his skype radio shows.

So much treasure on the salon! Edit: sorry I didn't answer.  I think that is interesting, but I agree with Terence that nobody really knows what's going on. I suppose there could be some way that deceased ancestors could have been decomposing in the soil of the plants which contained the DMT. Through some energy transference we have yet to measure or quantify these DMT plants were able to house the spirit of the dead, and hence, when smoking DMT we are communicating with a hybrid conscioussness of one (or many) individuals and the plant itself.  Whacky enough of an interpretation? Lol I love  finding the others."

DMT,35dskx,autowikibot,2,Sat May 9 13:55:45 2015 UTC,"Section 6. Diet and drug Interactions of article  Monoamine oxidase inhibitor:       When ingested orally, MAOIs inhibit the catabolism of dietary amines. When foods containing tyramine are consumed (so-called ""cheese effect""), the individual may suffer from hypertensive crisis.  The amount required to cause a reaction varies greatly from individual to individual, and depends on the degree of inhibition, which in turn depends on dosage and selectivity. [citation needed]  The exact mechanism by which tyramine causes a hypertensive reaction is not well-understood, but it is assumed that tyramine displaces norepinephrine from the storage vesicles.  This may trigger a cascade in which excessive amounts of norepinephrine can lead to a hypertensive crisis. Another theory suggests that proliferation and accumulation of catecholamines causes hypertensive crisis   Tyrosine, not tyramine, is the precursor to catecholamines. Tyramine is a breakdown product of tyrosine. In the gut and during fermentation, tyrosine, an amino acid, is decarboxylated to tyramine. Under ordinary circumstances, tyramine is deaminated in the liver to an inactive metabolite, but, when the hepatic MAO (primarily MAO-A) is inhibited, the ""first-pass"" clearance of tyramine is blocked and circulating tyramine levels can climb. Elevated tyramine competes with tyrosine for transport across the bloodâbrain barrier (via aromatic amino acid transport) where it can then enter adrenergic nerve terminals. Once in the cytoplasmic space, tyramine will be transported via the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) into synaptic vesicles, thereby displacing norepinephrine. The mass transfer of norepinephrine from its vesicular storage space into the extracellular space via mass action can precipitate the hypertensive crisis. Hypertensive crises can sometimes result in stroke or cardiac arrhythmia if not treated. In general, this risk is not present with RIMAs. Both kinds of intestinal MAO inhibition can cause hyperpyrexia, nausea, and psychosis if foods high in levodopa are consumed.

I would argue that you don't need to break thru to have a positive experience.  I want to break thru eventually tho.  I've been wondering if I would just need to increase the dose to do so.
DMT,35as5r,VirtualDrifter,2,Fri May 8 17:59:12 2015 UTC,"I've got a lot of stomach problems as is, so don't let my situation deter you from continuing to use this method. It was just putting a lot of strain on my body after dosing. I managed to avoid 'the purge' in most of my earlier trips, but the later ones were full of terrible constipation, diarrhea, and constant nausea/vomiting. It was like my mind was experiencing heaven while my body was put through hell.  I would agree with you that you don't need a breakthrough to have a positive experience with ayahuasca, but I would definitely advise caution. Ayahuasca has been the most beneficial thing I've ever done, yet it's not always friendly. I remember my last trip consisted of reliving every worst moment of my life over and over again. I've had a few nights with it where I'm surprised to have made it to the morning without blowing my brains out.  I highly prefer smoking/vaping DMT, but I'd still like to revisit ayahuasca at some point this summer."
DMT,35as5r,VirtualDrifter,2,Fri May 8 18:28:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing.  I've done DMT twice and have only used this method, but have had only extremely mild nausea and absolutely no purge.  The entirety of the trip was positive in every way.  I was able to face scary things about myself and my past with no fear whatsoever.  I would also highly advise caution.  Bad things can happen no matter how well you prepare, but with the right attitude and information you can reduce the chances to near zero.  BTW I think I might have almost broken thru on my last trip.  As I was really starting to come up, I was in bed with the lights off listening to isochronic tones music.  I began to feel as if I was rising up out of my body.  It was quite an uncanny feeling.  It seemed to stop once I noticed what was happening, and I started to focus on it."
DMT,35as5r,tooaud2,2,Fri May 8 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"Just try to use ayahuasca moderately. It's torn me down and built me back up again better than I was before many times, but none of my problems with it started until I got to the point of doing it multiple times a week.  You'll definitely know you've broken through when it happens, but I've only had a few breakthroughs from about 15 trips with this method and I've never done below 5g of Acacia. I'd definitely recommend increasing your dose until you find what you're looking for.  I've got 30+ DMT trips and nearly 50 LSD trips under my belt, and I've just gotta say that set and setting aren't always enough. While almost all of my experiences have been positive, sometimes shit just happens. If it ever does, just remember to give in and ride it out.  Sorry for ranting, but good luck on your journeys in hyperspace!"
DMT,35as5r,SugarBallz_,1 point,Fri May 8 21:02:22 2015 UTC,Thanks! I did watch that YouTube video before I read your post. My coffee grinder didn't grind up the Acacia Confusia very well but I shoved what I could in 00 caps. I took probably a total of 5 Syrian rue caps and 10 acacia Confusia. Didn't feel a thing. I think I might look for another dmt source. Tomorrow night I'll try more and see what happens.
DMT,35as5r,SugarBallz_,1 point,Tue May 12 04:40:34 2015 UTC,I would recommend getting your acacia already powdered.

What I can remember is some intense colourful geometric patterns accentuated by bright bolts of lightning, and some hints of ancient symbology. I did a few doses, maybe 4 or 5, but at least two were really not enough to get any real effects. After my second to last (and most intense trip) I had a strong feeling to not go any further tonight, but after my friend came around after his trip, I thought ""go on, do one more"" as soon as I exhaled I felt instant regret. I feel as though the trip was gonna go bad, so I opened my eyes I just told myself I was OK. That seemed to work, so lesson learned, when you've done enough, you've done enough. All in all, I really enjoyed the experience. I don't think I went that far down the rabbit hole, but I have a feeling I'll go deeper next, probably in a few months. Thanks for the support guys!"

DMT,35belm,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri May 8 18:53:06 2015 UTC,I have created a very crude vape method. I seen a guy on YouTube show it done.

DMT,35abuj,nichefiend,5,Fri May 8 13:06:03 2015 UTC,Just put the steel wool in the neck of the bottle then flip it upside down then pour the dmt onto the steel wool. Then put hold the lighter close enough until all of it melts into the steel wool. Then you flip her upside down and blast off. Good luck in your travels!
DMT,35abuj,JCreezy2112,2,Fri May 8 13:20:13 2015 UTC,Thanks! I get it now
DMT,35abuj,xNuckingFuts,1 point,Fri May 8 13:34:10 2015 UTC,"I do another variation that's quicker and simpler imo. I like heating the coil up outside of the bottle over a flame then when it's nice and hot (not red hot) I sprinkle the DMT on. Or, sprinkle the DMT on and heat it like 4 inches above a flame. It shouldn't smoke, but it should look like melting snow.  Edit:grammerz"
DMT,35abuj,agorajbig,1 point,Fri May 8 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"I'm still confused, once you put the DMT on the steel wool and melt it, you have to flip it again? Wouldn't this make it fall back out?"

DMT,35bu55,cautiouschemist,1 point,Sat May 9 13:38:05 2015 UTC,It did shrink up a bit and got firmer but it seemed to still work.   I guess if the copper will last longer before needing to be replaced then that may be a good thin assuming some residual dmt is left on it for next time.
DMT,35bu55,cautiouschemist,1 point,Sat May 9 16:02:15 2015 UTC,If given the choice I'd take copper wire. It doespecially last longer and will hold good. My motto with the mesh is better a lil too much then not enough

DMT,359b4a,galmse,2,Fri May 8 15:19:44 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that is wrong.  Acacia is not expressly scheduled, so it isn't illegal unless there is demonstrated intent to possess the DMT it contains. Tons of things contain DMT, which makes this practically unenforceable. Since all of us are buying it for this reason, we do have the intent. From a practical standpoint, though, LEO doesn't know we're buying it, and even if they did (by busting a bulk supplier, as they have done in the past to people importing/selling Mimosa, and looking at his customer records) they generally don't waste any effort going after buyers. How do you prove that they weren't just using it to dye clothes, as unlikely as it is?  DMT itself however is mentioned by name in the CSA, and is in Schedule I. This is unambiguous. Any transformation you do to Acacia to extract DMT, likewise, makes your intent clear. I don't know if making a tea would be sufficient; what if you're making tea for another reason? An A/B extraction however leaves little room for deniability.  It's the same situation with Trichocereus (Mescaline) and Khat (Cathinone). There's a reason powdered Trich is usually sold as ""incense,"" with no mention of alkaloid content.  It is not the same situation (although people commonly believe it to be so) with opium poppies or Peyote, all parts of which (except the seeds) are mentioned by name in the CSA."

DMT,357a7e,Spodjik,4,Thu May 7 20:24:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, ive felt my guide saying ""don't look away you need to see this"". Kind of unsettling but I've always felt like I was in good hands."
DMT,357a7e,bcmonke,3,Fri May 8 03:32:41 2015 UTC,"I've had two, both were a result of blasting off too soon after the last one.  The first time was the worst. It was the day after my first breakthrough. All I remembered was that it blew my mind the day before and I wanted more. As it came on I started to remember the first trip. I remember thinking 'Oh shit, I forgot this was real'. Then I started getting the idea that what I was doing wasn't cool. Like it was disrespectful to come back so soon, only for shits and giggles. Then I began violently coughing out the smoke. I felt and saw the coughs which were like evil barbed wire inside my body, and then shit got really bad. I was showered in nasty, unwelcoming vibes which felt like a thousand huge spiders marching towards me. There was all this green negative spiraling dmt language everywhere. I was too scared to look at the entities, I basically avoided eye contact with everything but I do remember seeing an object which looked a lot like a cancer cell.  The second time was more gentle. More of a 'neutral' trip. I accidentally broke through on the remnants of dmt in my bong. Initially I thought 'Cool, a free trip', but what I got was just grey, empty nothingness. There was an entity standing beside a visual representation of 'No Entry', which kinda looked like the wooden planks you'd see nailed across the door of an abandoned house. It was very still and empty, except for the entity who kept jabbing me like 'Yeah, you. Not for you'. I felt like she was calling me a bad person, or that I needed to take a look at some aspects of my behaviour before I was going to get thrown another party in hyperspace. This experience is further evidence for me that the dmt world is real, because why else would I have got such a trip from a usually very colourful psychedelic if it was just chemicals in my brain?  That was my last ever trip and I no longer partake for various reasons, but after that trip I began thinking very hard about what the entities wanted from me, so that when I do see them again they'll be happy to see me."
DMT,357a7e,coldevil123,2,Fri May 8 02:01:05 2015 UTC,"The closest I've come to a bad trip wasnt as bad as I've seen described.   I laid back after smoking and a reddish field lowered down from my ceiling.   When it pressed against me i felt like i was being shocked with electricity.  It also hada very strong negative feeling to it.  I felt claustrophobic pressed like that against my couch,  feeling like something was angry with me.  Eventually it faded and slowly lifted off me and back into my ceiling."
DMT,357a7e,Imgodnigga,2,Thu May 7 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"My first time I could describe as ""bad,"" but I'm still glad that it happened. I was by myself and wasn't the most prepared, but I wanted to do it anyway. As soon as it hit I though ""Oh god, this isn't DMT. I'm going to die here."" Clearly that didn't happen, but those were essentially my thoughts the entire time. The next time was much better."
DMT,357a7e,hashmon,2,Fri May 8 02:07:14 2015 UTC,"Bad trips are entirely possible. I would recommend having some previous psychedelic experience in order to help prevent a bad trip. Set and setting is a huge factor also. Start small and then work your way up to a breakthrough dosage in order to prevent a bad trip from happening too. It helps to reassure your self that everything is okay while in hyperspace and to remember that it will be over soon. I like having a mantra like ""this is good, this is good"" over and over again. The one time a trip started getting bad I started seeing skulls until I told them to fuck off and they went away. You have complete control while in hyperspace just remember that (in a sense it's more or less a show but you can tell evil spirits to fuck off). That being said a majority of trip reports include limitless love and radiant joy dmt I think is just a ""love"" drug if that make sense. Good luck though man! :)"

I haven't tried DMT (yet) or any psychedelics at all and I've had that exact same dream of walking on a stone pathway, near a cliff. I was overlooking a valley with water flowing through at the bottom with planets around it.. and the person (or being) was guiding me through the path. The dream was so vivid, but i can't seem to remember what the being looked liked. It almost seems like a shadow or silhouette. Thanks for sharing. Im just freaked out because of the dream without a trip."
DMT,3547ez,NotTelkin,1 point,Thu May 7 05:43:49 2015 UTC,"My trip was very similar to your dream. There was an entity there, made of stone like the other Native South American guys, but I wasn't looking at it. I was looking out into the trees from the cliff while the stone pathway came up.

I believe he poses a threat to my safety. But even though I was filled with his prickly pins and dastardly laughter I was okay.  Time is a very abstract concept. I am at a carnival with my family. I'm pretty sure we're having a good time. Suddenly one of the rides begins making an odd, shrill, monotonous sound. It reverberates through my cranium. Everyone seems to be captivated by it.  I'm looking for something. For someone. I met someone. A girl. At first she was just with one friend but more joined us soon after. We all walked for a while, and I think she 'gets it'. As much as one can, anyway. I felt... content, relaxed.  I looked at myself in the mirror. My hair was growing in and out. My nose was bleeding. Face distorted. There was a figure in the room with me... something unfamiliar. Angry. Scary. It told me I was dosed with some synthetic variation of dimethyltryptamine, a basic molecule whose effects partially mimicked those that were coursing through my bones at that very moment. Of course, I thought. It all makes sense now.  My friends came to my house â I exited my bedroom on the second floor, and looked down at them strolling through the front entrance. They attempted to console me. Flashing back and forth. Then wakefulness."""

DMT,351tc9,samwoolfe1,8,Wed May 6 12:06:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting. My take on it is that there is definitely information being relayed in these DMT trips. Perhaps we just don't know how to process it. ASL looks like nonsense to someone who doesn't understand it, yet there is certain meaning to all of those hand gestures. Maybe these entities are communicating in the only way they know how and we haven't yet been able to decipher their language.  I'd also like to note that this is solely speculative opinion, so I don't want any comments talking about how it's ""just a drug fucking with your brain."" I know there are plenty of people here of that opinion and I ask that you respect other points of view. Especially when the people holding those points of view do not regard them as absolute fact, but rather an interesting possibility. Thank you :)"
DMT,351tc9,dmtpsychonaut,5,Wed May 6 13:06:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think the vast majority of people who have actually tried it would agree that there is a distinct feeling that information of some sort is trying to be conveyed to the user."
DMT,351tc9,KrAzYkArL18769,1 point,Wed May 6 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"I agree that it feels like information is being conveyed, but I'm not convinced that the information is anything novel - i.e. something the person either did not know before or could not have discovered without the drug. I've most definitely received messages during the experience, but I still believe that these messages ultimately come from my self, expressed through the crazy entities...for whatever reason.   Still, I enjoy thinking about the possibility that genuine secrets are told during the experience. I tend to get that impression...but then I soon forget the secrets, perhaps because they are too monumental for my limited brain to handle."
DMT,351tc9,swamprus,2,Thu May 7 06:12:25 2015 UTC,"I have never taken DMT, but I enjoy reading trip reports, especially those of a speculative nature. I have tripped on mushrooms, though, and have come to my own conclusion about life: that there is more here than we can detect with our senses. There is a great complexity all around us.  I do have a sort of question, or rather a speculation that I am curious what a person like you might make of. I have noticed a similarity between the description of some DMT trips, my own bad mushroom trips, and night terrors I experienced as a child.   In my night terrors, I was often trapped in a place of incredible pain and infinity, it would be very FAST-PACED, a feeling of being HURLED and of things hurling by. The terror of knowing that this is happening - this is infinity - this is infinity. Looping, aware of my awareness in multiple levels, like a hall of mirrors reflecting forever. Occasionally I would be assaulted by more concrete visions of incomrephensible, vast creatures which seat themselves in a void which I was forcefully 'touring' in my nightmare.  There were also several bad mushroom trips I had where I 'visited' this same place that seems outside of the concept of time and space. Or rather, a difference understanding of what those forces really are and our place in them."
DMT,351tc9,Satourious,2,Wed May 6 20:25:29 2015 UTC,"I can imagine that's what a bad DMT trip could be like. I haven't done a high enough dose of mushrooms to get to that kind of level, but chemically, psilocybin and DMT are very similar, so it's no surprise that a high dose mushroom trip would resemble a DMT trip."
DMT,351tc9,dmtpsychonaut,2,Thu May 7 05:55:06 2015 UTC,Thank you for reminding me of these dreams. I hadn't had one in so long I nearly forgot them. What a strange sensation to feel like your in a hurry through eternity. I recall dreams of frustration where there were simple task of organization that were seemingly impossible. Like trying to make my bed. Although the blankets would always stay extremely wrinkled no matter how much I worked at them. Then there's the ever popular fights inside dreams where you can't hit anything hard. I think its so fascinating these links between consciousness/subconscious. The role these substances play with an aware dream world. I feel like the ancients understood this stuff better than we do currently. Tired not making much sense at this point. Thanks tho fo real
DMT,35243m,cecil500,3,Wed May 6 13:47:17 2015 UTC,"Whether DMT allows the mind to alter the frequencies that we tune in to, to allow access to an alternate state of consciousness or even another realm of reality - OR causes a chemical reaction in the brain to simply hallucinate and have the profound experiences we do, I think whichever it one it is, is irrelevant if the outcome of which is something tangible that we can hold on to improve ourselves.    This is a great way to put it - even for psychedelics in general"
DMT,35243m,jonesRG,2,Wed May 6 17:00:45 2015 UTC,"I agree. Too many cynics and pessimists get stuck on ""don't forget that it's nothing special, just hallucinations.

DMT,35375j,smokinjoe65,2,Wed May 6 19:29:56 2015 UTC,"Awesome. It's as easy as can be. The only part that really deserves your undivided attention (aside from safety, obviously) and a steady hand is the pulling stage, when you're siphoning the naphtha. You may get a thin whitish film between your solvent/soup interface, so be sure not to pull any more than the clear part. Leave the basified soup and the milky layer behind at all costs, even if you have to leave a small bit of naphtha behind. It'll get mixed into the next pull."
DMT,35375j,smokinjoe65,1 point,Wed May 6 19:48:45 2015 UTC,So leave behind the milky layer? The tek says that the first pull may have the milky layer and that it is a good sign. Is the milky layer the fats from the bark? I've read that these are unwanted for a purer product.
DMT,35375j,smokinjoe65,2,Wed May 6 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"Whenever I pulled the milky layer I got drops of yellow goo. When I left it behind, it was all white with minimal clear goo. I have read that it's the plant fats. In addition, I'll state that I've done a defat once, in the beginning, and it isn't worth it to me. Perhaps root bark quality plays a role in that."
DMT,35375j,smokinjoe65,2,Wed May 6 20:34:19 2015 UTC,Thanks so much man. This is all great info. I'm gonna go with your advice once again.

DMT,35375j,falls330,2,Wed May 6 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"One note of clarification: when I refer to the milky layer, I'm not referring to the milky solvent you may come across. I, personally, have never seen cloudy naphtha in my pulls but maybe others have. The milky layer I refer to will be sitting at the bottom of your solvent layer, suspended over the black soup.   http://imgur.com/hiyoFzV This is a poor example because I disturbed the vessel and broke the milky layer, but can you see the thin layer of crap right above the black basified mix? That's the part you leave behind."

I think that's what I actually did haha and ended up testing the waters 3 times before fully breaking through the 4th time which is when I finally got the pipe method down. Use a scale! Ideally you want to only take one big hit and hold it as long as possible. I think what I did though starting off though was hold one hit for 15, second hit for 20, and a third for as long as possible. Tolerance sets in as fast as 45 seconds or something like that so what ever you do work it in fast lol! You probably won't be able to go for the third hit the first time around because it's such a weird feeling but when you think your ready you just gotta go for it even though everything in your body will tell you not to!

DMT,350tei,sbarret,1 point,Wed May 6 14:03:26 2015 UTC,Your stomach has these things called mono amino oxidase that rapidly break down the DMT. That is why it's necessary to have something like B Cappi which contains a MAOI. This inhibits the MAOs from breaking it down.

You'll also need some empty gel caps.  total cost of raw materials was about $45 after shipping.  Should get about 20 doses worth, probably more. You'll need a coffee grinder or something similar to grind the rue seeds.  A scale is also very helpful.  Start by taking about 2 grams of syrian rue.  Wait about half an hour, you should start feeling mildly dizzy.  If not, take another gram or so and wait another half hour or so.  Then you'll take about two or three grams of the acacia powder.  Wait half an hour to an hour.  If you don't feel much of anything, take about another gram or so every half hour to an hour until you start to feel the effects.  Start with lower doses and work your way up.  This was my first experience with DMT, so I'm no expert.  Check out the comments for the video.

I have to admit, this is my first time with DMT in any form.    I ended up taking too much.  I've been high for about 12 hours now.  I have loved every second. Only had a very small amount of nausea.  Also, bonus video for when you're high https://youtu.be/9UcKhas3HCk"
DMT,34xhr1,GarlicandOrchid,6,Tue May 5 11:28:30 2015 UTC,video for when your high??? wtf mate you shouldn't need a video.. you have not experienced a DMT journey. Omg. your just bouncing around on the edge bro.
DMT,34xhr1,DmT4Th33,4,Tue May 5 13:14:06 2015 UTC,You are correct.  Its my first time.  I enjoyed it.
DMT,34xhr1,DmT4Th33,6,Tue May 5 13:35:33 2015 UTC,sorry what I mean is you may have not actually had a DMT trip but just the euphoria that indicates the beginning and end.. you didn't have the actual journey. you didn't have enough... you haven't actually tried it yet bro. you were on for 12 hours? no. the trip report would have been fucking intense for a 12 hour journey.

DMT,34xa05,MissV6661,2,Tue May 5 09:29:54 2015 UTC,Changa contains freebase DMT and an MAOI. The MAOI acts to potentiate the DMT by inhibiting Monoamine Oxidase which will rapidly break it down.
DMT,34xa05,dmtprotips,2,Tue May 5 20:00:18 2015 UTC,Changa can easily be just as intense as freebase - I've experienced a similar onset of terror from both. But changa is sooo much easier to smoke and I think I personally prefer the additional effects from the MAOI. I wish I had some changa...

Before people start saying ""lay off... you're frying your brain... don't be stupid"" I'd like to address, again, that I'm in no way affected negatively.   Edited for fat-fingered misspellings..."

What is different is that colors are enhanced, like someone turned up the color saturation, or how neon reacts under a black light.   Things look holographic, and ""extra"" 3D.   Everything looks digital, where as it used to look analog.   It looks completely and totally unreal, like how a you would expect a 3D video game on the xbox 2500 would look.   Digital, holographic, extra 3D, enhanced color, looks artificial, like a video game.  Those are the best terms I can come up with to describe it.

After all my psychedelic use I've been able to appreciate the nature and beauty of things around me. I'm thinking it's something more along those lines not some sort of permanent damage done. Are there any distortions? And how crazy is the color change like shroom color change crazy? If it's been with you for 8 months I'm guessing it's in your head.  Best bet is go to a doctor though of course! :)

DMT,34wo80,Eazyg2002,2,Tue May 5 13:12:34 2015 UTC,"I think I know exactly what you mean.  I experience the same style of visuals as you are describing when taking DMT, they don't stick around, though.  Basically everything is incredibly sharp, clear and bright with no natural color gradients. Depending on the dose of DMT this effect was more or less pronounced - the higher the dose the more artificial and digital. Textures also lost detail, really very much like high definition computer renderings."

DMT,34wo80,TheAmishChicken,1 point,Tue May 5 14:33:07 2015 UTC,I think you two might operate on a different definition of blacking out.  Did you just fade to black and regain consciousness or do you just mean blacking out as in losing contact to your body and going into an altered state of mind in which you were still conscious?

DMT,34wa87,xNuckingFuts,3,Tue May 5 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"The trick is to first melt the DMT into the copper/steel mesh. You do this by sprinkling your DMT dose on the mesh then approaching a flame and inhale through the other hole very slightly until until you see it melting and absorbing into the mesh.  Now you are ready to begin taking your hits. Put the flame near the mesh and slowly inhale through the mouth hole. You should see the flame being sucked in to the mesh as you inhale. Make sure the flame doesn't touch the mesh, keep it about an inch away.   You will then see milky-white vapor flowing inside the bottle into your mouth. Do this multiple times until all of the DMT has been vaporized or until you can't do it anymore due to tripping balls."
DMT,34wa87,ThouArtNaught,1 point,Tue May 5 04:40:45 2015 UTC,"SO! I tried my first time today. I think I did something wrong. Because I melted the DMT into the mesh, and took 4 to 5 hits, and I halfway broke through. What I noticed was the smoke was super harsh if I put the flame like a cm away but too light if I took it any further. Is it supposed to be harsher than weed? I'm afraid I'm burning it. I used at least 75 mg."
DMT,34wa87,cautiouschemist,2,Thu May 7 00:48:23 2015 UTC,It should be noted for the novice that once it's melted into the mesh you then point the mesh side down to light DONT hold it up like above your head.
DMT,34wa87,dmtprotips,1 point,Tue May 5 11:13:01 2015 UTC,"Basically you have a glass bottle that has a hole drilled in one end. The drilled hole is where you inhale. The neck of the bottle is stuffed with steel wool. When you want to charge the Machine, simple dump a little DMT on top of the steel wool. Now heat the neck of the bottle just to the point where the dmt melts into the steel wool. When you're ready to hit it, you want to put the flame near the mesh, but not touching it. The idea is to vaporize by convection, not conduction."
DMT,34wa87,ErdeTyrene,0,Tue May 5 03:54:13 2015 UTC,"Do you think itd be easier to hold the mesh with some long tweezers, put the DMT on top, and heat the mesh with a lighter then when it's melted in, stuff the mesh back into the neck of the bottle?"
DMT,34wa87,dmtprotips,2,Wed May 6 23:24:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. It's really simple to melt the DMT into the mesh.  Stand the bottle up (like bottles normally sit), place DMT on top of the steel wool, and heat bottle neck just until it melts into the mesh. Any more than that and it will run down into your bottle."
DMT,34wa87,ErdeTyrene,1 point,Thu May 7 01:41:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm ok. I was under the impression the DMT should up melted into the mesh in the end of the mesh that goes head first into the bottle neck, if you get what I'm saying. It probably doesn't matter.  I've never used the machine so I don't have any first hand experience to really know what I'm talking about"

DMT,34vodn,NoRadiation,1 point,Mon May 4 23:06:52 2015 UTC,"You don't necessarily have to buy a ton of plant material. Just purchase 100g or so. I don't suggest purchasing the DMT from someone else, because that person might not have a clue what they're doing. You're putting yourself at risk. By far the easiest and most efficient budget method is to create a Machine. DMT should be your starter. Changa and Aya contain MAOI's which will potentiate the trip significantly, and you're likely not mentally ready to dive in headfirst. If you like the concept of changa because it's easier to smoke, just create enhanced leaf."
DMT,34vodn,dmtprotips,1 point,Mon May 4 23:22:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, so changa is specifically enhanced leaf where the leaf in question contains an MAOI. ""Enhanced leaf"" is simply leaf like mint (no MAOIs) that's been enhanced with DMT?"
DMT,34vodn,NoRadiation2,1 point,Tue May 5 00:06:45 2015 UTC,"Correct. While mint would work fine, I would suggest choosing a better leaf. I'm pretty fond of Calea zacatechichi."

DMT,34vdlh,ISeeStars9,4,Mon May 4 21:42:22 2015 UTC,"My only other drug experience was LSD, four trips out of a 10 strip. Some people build up to it, whatever that means, but there's not really anything that compares to the experience that goes along with a dmt breakthrough. Hell, even other DMT trips won't prepare you for a dmt trip."
DMT,34vdlh,smokinjoe65,2,Tue May 5 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"It's short, like ten to fifteen minutes, and EXTREMELY intense if you do it properly. It's up to you, but most people build up to it with other psychedelic experiences.  If and when you're ready, though, take it seriously. Do it in a quiet, dark space, ideally with just one other person, maybe two, but not at a party. You should vaporize it, not just smoke it in a bowl. Take huge hits, and hold them in.  Before you do it, maybe watch ""DMT: The Spirit Molecule"" on youtube, if you haven't already."
DMT,34vdlh,legalize-drugs,1 point,Mon May 4 21:56:21 2015 UTC,What about when it comes to mixing it with anything else? From what I read it's ok to mix it in with pot. What about lsd? Would it be too much to take it especially for someone very new to DMT?
DMT,34vdlh,mqduck,1 point,Mon May 4 22:03:29 2015 UTC,"Although they're far from identical, LSD and DMT are still (in the grand scheme of all-things-that-can-be-experienced) very similar. The short of it is that taking one will compound the other. If it's your first time (with either drug or with psychedelics in general), I'd recommend sticking to just one and experiencing it for what it is, but taking the two together isn't any riskier than taking a larger dose of just one."
DMT,34vdlh,_EqualAndOpposite_,1 point,Tue May 5 00:02:27 2015 UTC,Alright for sure. I've already done LSD before. But I was thinking that I take the tab and once I'm at my peak I can use whatever DMT I bought. But was curious if it was safe to mix them both the DMT and LSD. But I think I'm just gonna stick to one at a time and use them different days etc. Don't wanna go too hard lol
DMT,34vdlh,mqduck,3,Tue May 5 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"You can take a hit of dmt when peaking, but let me tell you, it's extremely intense. Probably most intense 10 minutes of my life. Thinking back on it now it just doesn't seem possible. Definitely recommend it but not for your first go, maybe get some experience in the dmt space first ."
DMT,34vdlh,legalize-drugs,1 point,Tue May 5 08:01:10 2015 UTC,"Well, the best/worst thing about DMT is how short it lasts. You can try it by itself first and then try it after some acid tabs all in the space of one day if it feels right."
DMT,34r5f0,trwawayacnt93,10,Sun May 3 21:06:57 2015 UTC,"/u/jcreezy2112 makes a good point in how there is really nothing to fear, and the short duration helps, too. This first experience will be like jumping from a plane blindfolded and having the blindfold ripped off as soon as you leave the plane. You are hoping your parachute is rigged correctly (it is) but the mystery is terrifying :) It's a leap of faith, my friend.  Regarding terror, it's a different kind of terror. Yes, you'll have moments where reality seems like a thing of the past and you'll never find your way back, but you have a degree of capacity to talk yourself through it. It's strange... you don't realize how prepared you already are until you get your feet wet for the first time.  Good luck, have fun and be safe!"

DMT,34r5f0,JCreezy2112,9,Sun May 3 22:07:38 2015 UTC,Try meditating before you trip. It can really help calm you down and clear your mind before blast off. Just remember there is nothing to be scared about and that it will all be over on less than 10 minutes.  Good luck my friend :)
DMT,34r5f0,Kancer86,3,Sun May 3 21:20:01 2015 UTC,Thank you for you're reply. I will surely do that !
DMT,34r5f0,YarnYarn,5,Sun May 3 21:30:14 2015 UTC,"Just understand one thing about dmt. The people that usually have had bad experiences are the ones that tried too hard to control the trip. You HAVE to just let dmt do its thing. It's far stronger than mushrooms or LSD, but not in a bad way. Also, understand that it hits you almost immediately when you smoke/vape it...like, as you blow it out you'll start tripping. Don't go in with any expectations either. Before I tried it my first time, I was going around reading all of these trip reports and all of these experiences...and I tried to prepare for it that way...which is basically trying to prepare for something through someone else's eyes. There are similar effects a lot of people experience (the entities, the spirals, the lego block world, etc) but each experience is unique, like any psychadelic. Don't expect to have a social trip, like shrooms or acid, it's kind of like 8 hours of intense tripping like you've never experiencedbut condensed into 7-15 minutes. The hardest part is from minute 1-7 and after that youll regain some awareness...and by that, I mean you trip so hard initially (if up you do it right) that you basically just lay back and sit in silence and let things happen...if it gets too intense just tell someone beforehand to remind you that it'll be over quick if you start to panic, that helped me A LOT my first time. Like this other guy said, meditate and clear your consciousness first, and go in open minded with no expectations...you'll love it. Theres a lot of mental ""prep work"" everyone does before their first dmt trip, but after you do it once you'll wanna do it again within an hour or so lol. Good luck dude! Let me know if you have any other questions...I've blasted off probably over 200 times over the past few years. It's short, sweet, and to the point...to the point where I've smoked it at like 3 and gone to work at 5 and was 100% normal and productive haha"
DMT,34r5f0,SmorlFox,2,Sun May 3 23:51:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply bud. I completely get what you mean when saying let go, I surely will. I'm just gonna stop reading about peoples DMT trips and just meditate/relax as much as I can this week until blast off."

DMT,34r5f0,keryskerys,2,Mon May 4 13:04:49 2015 UTC,"I became rather good at reasoning with myself.  ""There's nothing I can really do about it though besides wait for it to be over, so I should at least calm down a bit and enjoy it.""  Works like a charm, at least for me. You basically HAVE to figure out how to calm yourself down if you don't have a sitter (which I would highly suggest having)."
DMT,34r5f0,keryskerys,2,Mon May 4 04:49:39 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of in the opposite position to you.  I did my share of mushrooms and acid when I was younger, but I haven't touched them for 20-odd years now.  I feel a sense of anxiety now, because I have a couple of trips which I'm planning to take with my husband at a festival in a couple of months.  Having said that, and explained that I'm generally anxious around psychedelics (even though I've actually never had a bad time, even with Salvia, which a lot of people don't seem to like), I can honestly say, hand on heart that I love DMT.  My first time was shocking and I did zoom out.  Like /u/smokinjoe65 said, it was:   like jumping from a plane blindfolded and having the blindfold ripped off as soon as you leave the plane. You are hoping your parachute is rigged correctly (it is).   But again, the duration is short, although it can feel like infinity when you are ""in it"".  But that parachute is definitely there, and the come-down is like your parachute opens up and you float gently back to earth, with a beautiful view and a giggle and a delighted smile on your face.  If you have any words to remind me not to fear the acid at my festival, however, I would appreciate the help.  I'm sure it will be fine, but I'd love some reassurance!  Edit: the setting for DMT can make a huge difference too.  Be comfortable where you are, whether it's at home with ambient lighting, or out in nature.  Be with people you are happy to ""let go"" with.  I have only ever done it with my husband and with close, interested friends.  The fierce love I feel with DMT is second to none."
DMT,34r5f0,dmtprotips,3,Sun May 3 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, You've all just taken many fears I have of the trip ... at least for now. I'm gonna do it 100 % . I'll be in the comfort of my house with my closest friend who is doing it for the first time as well.    ""The fierce love I feel with DMT is second to none""  - I want to feel that so much.  Thank you /u/Stateoftheart for you're insightful reply."
DMT,34r5f0,keryskerys,3,Sun May 3 22:57:46 2015 UTC,"One more thing I'd like to add - I would recommend a glass of cold water somewhere safe and nearby.    When you begin to come down, it is wonderful to be able to sip ice cold water to soothe your throat.  Nothing ever tasted better to me than small sips of cold water after a breakthrough on DMT."

Go into the trip with the mindset that absolutely nothing can go wrong, and you can be certain nothing will."

There's a popular theory, not mine, that at death and near-death experiences the body releases large amounts of DMT to ease the transition.  Could you share more about what happened as you fell? If it's too traumatic I understand. Did you black out? First glance tells me adrenaline, confusion + possible concussion."
DMT,34prkz,username2229,4,Sun May 3 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't blackout at all, not from the pain or when I intially hit, I was conscious for everything. When I hit my legs instantly went numb, and it felt like I was getting electrocuted in my lower back. At this time the first responders were already on top of me asking me all the questions and this is when the shock and ""dazed"" state of mind came and left multiple times.  Talking about this here defiantly has eased the process of talking about what happened. Whenever people asked me what happened in person, I get so anxious and antsy. It was a very scary ordeal. If you would like me to get into detail, you can pm me as it is still quite hard for me."
DMT,34prkz,YarnYarn,4,Sun May 3 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"How did you injur your back?   It sounds like its possible you were concussed, which can cause differences in sensory perception, particularly the visual."
DMT,34prkz,YarnYarn,3,Sun May 3 13:36:41 2015 UTC,A parachuting accident.   But my head was not hit at all. I literally landed like I was going to be sitting down on a chair or a ledge. It went feet->butt. And I was wearing a pretty decent helmet.
DMT,34prkz,YarnYarn,3,Sun May 3 13:45:26 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you don't need to actually hit your head to get a concussion, but I could be wrong. You just need to jar yourself hard enough that your brain hits your skull, so it may yet be a possibility.  It sounds like you're asking if you may have had a kind of near death experience where your body released DMT. On that, I couldn't speculate.  I'm glad you're recovering though! Good luck!"
DMT,34prkz,f1n,2,Sun May 3 13:49:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you might be right, like the force of me hitting the ground just traveled through my body and my brain hit my skull.  And yes, I am trying to figure out what was going on in my brain at the time of the incident. And I really don't want to talk to my overseeing physicians about this in fear of them referring me to a mental health doctor. That would just be way too much to handle and deal with in my current state."
DMT,34prkz,djwonderful,1 point,Sun May 3 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have to worry about being referred to a psych doctor. Your GP would most likely refer you to a neurologist long before they even considered what you described to be a mental health issue.  As far as it goes, asking a neurologist might be your best bet for finding some answers."

I mean, there is a sort of buzzing/humming sound in your head at the beginning (which doesn't sound like the Shepard tone btw), but that goes away pretty quick.  I've had Electric Sheep set as my screensaver for several years now, and there have been times when I've sat and stared at it for several minutes with the accompaniment of Lucy or psilocybin. At that time I came to the conclusion (or formulated a hypothesis, I should say) that all the various patterns and images and beautiful coalescences were akin to looking into the structure of the universe. They were like 2-dimensionalized, flattened slices of the inner workings of the fabric of spacetime which no human has had the privilege of witnessing in situ. I had the intuition that every sequence I saw existed somewhere in the universe or multiverse or within a different dimension.  So, while I wouldn't say it's exactly like the video, I would say there is definitely something significant about these visualizations and they do pair extremely well with the tryptamines."

One bad thing is that there is not a lot of research into negative longterm effects of our extraction and ingestion methods. I for one find the risk worth the reward.

DMT,34h4jg,ehvalproic,1 point,Fri May 1 03:28:09 2015 UTC,"This isn't necessarily changa, as the mint leaves don't enhance the trip, only make it much smoother and better tasting.  You need to make a caapi leaf extract or some other mao inhibiting plant matter which makes the trip completely different.  Honestly, I like to smoke them seprately.  Put caapi extract in a bowl, take a big hit or 2.  Then smoke the dmt with some dried mint leaves as packing in vaporizer or machine or whatever you use.  This way you can surf the changa wave for hours by taking more hits of dmt as you come down."
DMT,34h4jg,entheogenocide,1 point,Fri May 1 12:15:18 2015 UTC,Not OP here but you're saying changa actually enhances the dmt trip? It's not just dmt covered herbs that you can smoke? And what do you mean you can ride the wave for hours? You don't mean spending hours in hyperspace do you?
DMT,34h4jg,Imgodnigga,2,Fri May 1 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Smoking dmt with a harmine based maoi plant makes the experience completely different.  The usual dmt trip, one measures out an amount, takes a certain number of hits, hope you get it just right, and blast off.  Then you have to wait 30 min to try again.  With changa, you can take a hit, test the waters, take another hit, go even deeper, take another, go deeper, enjoy for 10 min, take another, and repeat.  There is no down time between hits, hence riding the wave of hyperspace.  Also the trips are way more vivid with eyes open.  And waaaaay less stressful."
DMT,34h4jg,entheogenocide,1 point,Sat May 2 06:32:33 2015 UTC,"Oops, I should have titled it questions about enhanced leaf. I know it needs caapi leaf or some sort of MAOI to be considered changa.

DMT,34eoce,CensureBars,7,Thu Apr 30 15:04:54 2015 UTC,"I went online and got it shipped and he had no problems. Usually that situation with the cops you described comes because the person was already a suspect in some sort of case and were monitoring them.  Assuming thats not the case for you you're fine, I would just say not to order all the ingredients at once, definitely not all online, and for the ones in stores you buy use cash and then theres no proof you acquired all of the materials, just 1 or 2 of them. I had no problem with this method and have done the process a few times now.  EDIT: for the extra security conscious, get a private PO box through a non-government company who advertises as secure and private. These places are good at keeping your things safe and they sign for your package for you so you gain a level of plausible deniability.  EDIT 2: As /u/martient712 suggested I cut the ""my friend"" bull shit because it's all the same shit at the end of the day."
DMT,34eoce,ImRaffed,2,Thu Apr 30 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"Yo, the government knows you mean you, saying MY FRIEND in all caps does not help you, and shown to a jury in a court, they'd convict you as well. Even if you think they can't assume it's you, you've provided an account saying that you have information about schedule I drug processing and that's enough for them to start investigating you just like they would if you just straight up said it was you and they cared enough to pursue it.  In any event, saying you handled a personal use amount of schedule I drugs on Reddit isn't enough for them to care. Anyone can lie about things they do on the internet, people do it often. The only time it warrants action is if it's a big thing going on, or if it's potentially dangerous action. And even then, they won't swat your house, they'd do investigating first before making any moves.  This is the reason that use of SWIM is discouraged. It's useless, provides no protection, and just makes things harder to read. Now despite the fact that I wrote this whole thing, I am not like severely bothered by what words you choose to use. But if you've ever browsed a forum that uses it regularly, you'll see how obnoxious it gets, but way more importantly, people should know that it offers no protection."

Dose was 70mg split with another friend, both of us are extremely new to dmt so we didn't break through but there was still lots left next time I tried it and we both had extremely vivid visual (I took one long slow inhale and held for 15 seconds). Does leave a slight smell but I doubt it's anything a qtip and iso can't fix, that being said, it's probably not a terrible idea to have a dmt dedicated stem."

As people have said below, if you break through you aren't really aware that you have a body. That said, during my last (and most intense) experience, I have a vague memory of my body not being physical, but existing as undulating waves/electric currents of orgasmic pleasure.  The body 'load' if you want to call it that, is also apparent when it comes on and when you come back, as others have mentioned. One time when smoking changa I remember after the second hit it felt like my bones and then entire body was electrified and vibrating intensely, although it wasn't painful. After the third hit I knew it was going to be super intense, and I remember lying back with closed eyes and feeling my body rapidly dissolve, as if consumed by the vibrations. It reminded me of that scene in The Matrix, where Neo touches the mirror and that liquid metallic substance envelops him and when it reaches his throat and face he quickly disappears and wakes up in another place.  When coming back, my body feels highly energised and it is definitely a euphoric bodily high, which accompanies the mental euphoria."

DMT,34d1bl,_delete,2,Thu Apr 30 04:07:56 2015 UTC,"everything seems incredibly lacklustre. painfully bleak. i'm bored all the time and stuck in a terrible place, which is a really dreadful combination. i feel disconnected from reality. every moment of each day my mind is a million miles away, on another planet, while my body is hear reaping the consequences of living in a physical world. the only thing keeping me ""grounded"" is just that; the physical consequences of living here. i vastly lack empathy- something i used to have heaps of- because of the environment i've lived in for majority of my life. i acknowledge my actions in the now, but at the same time feel disconnected from them- it's excruciating not being able to describe it better."
DMT,34d1bl,nikoledavis,2,Thu Apr 30 04:14:15 2015 UTC,Dmt could potentially help bring vibrance back into your life! In my experience I had an afterglow for 2-3 months. It made me realize where I am in the macrocosm. I believe if done correctly and you have the priviledge to experience an ego death :: You will not be able to bring your baggage with you and I believe it would help with a rebirth of some sort.   Check out these papers on psychedilcs as therapy http://www.maps.org/resources/papers
DMT,34d1bl,710goon,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:57:33 2015 UTC,Instead of jumping straight to the most powerful psychadelic on the planet maybe you should try floating. Maybe I'm only saying this since I did my first float today but it was incredible. When I left the center the feeling I had was exactly like the afterglow of psychadelics. Every thing was crisp and vibrant. I felt reborn out of the abyss that was the tank. While inside I dealt with alot of stuff I had built up and didn't know was there. Unfortunately as I was starting to actually see what I can only describe as the universe my session ended. I'm not saying DMT won't help. I'm actually doing and extraction right now lol. But floating is a way to face your problems and inner darkness on a clear head. I hope things brighten up for you friend. Sending good vibes your way.

DMT,34d1bl,Molestador,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:23:56 2015 UTC,"i appreciate the encouraging words, guys.  in my two and a half decades on this earth i've lived a fairly full, albeit devoid of happiness and fulfilment, life. i've travelled a good portion of the world, done things that'd make anyone else happy, had good friends, etc., but my whole problem is much deeper than all that superficial stuff. travel can be enriching, sure, but not when all your surroundings are the same. visual stimuli aren't adverse enough to change me.  i already go for daily walks through beautiful nearby forests, but they yield little benefit as i'm just too far-gone into darkness. also, i'm not exactly jumping straight to the most powerful psychedelic on the planet; i've had experience with shrooms on a few occasions as well as ecstasy, cocaine, marijuana (via edibles, which always yielded best results), etc. i know there's much discussion surrounding the topic, but i don't believe you need to do other psych.'s in order to prepare yourself for dmt. i, frankly, find that a bit belittling to dmt. my state in life is not temporary. it's permanent. i know this and live with it every day. i'm not trying to change my life, just trying to see something new, even if for just five minutes."

I've tried it 4 times, and the only time I was able to get an effect was the 4th and that's because I used a butane torch lighter. It was one of those $5 ones you can find at walgreens. The reason I used a butane lighter is because a regular lighter you shouldn't have lit too long or you might burn your fingers (as was the case with me)  So I would recomend using a butane lighter. It takes me about a minute for it to start milking, whereas with a lighter it took me like 3 or 4 minutes."
DMT,34bfdv,The_Unforgiving,2,Wed Apr 29 20:29:39 2015 UTC,I'm preparing for my first here in a few weeks. All I've read is that the machine is near unbeatable unless you pony up for a glass vapor genie....
DMT,34bfdv,cautiouschemist,2,Thu Apr 30 01:13:36 2015 UTC,"Machine is most popular,butI'll try  it this way. Mainly b/c it is doing what the machine does. It keeps the flame away from contact, I'll wait for it to start to vaporizer and slowly draw it in."

DMT,34ad2l,Imgodnigga,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:56:22 2015 UTC,"In my journeys I delved in too quickly and too seen after a trip had just ended.

DMT,34afh9,pavetheatmosphere,2,Wed Apr 29 16:22:55 2015 UTC,Ahh I gotcha thanks for the reply.
DMT,34afh9,dmtpsychonaut,3,Wed Apr 29 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"For a breakthrough, it is still a gradual comedown over the course of 5-10 minutes. Generally it is accompanied by some euphoric feelings, at least if it was a good trip! Within 25 minutes you are back at baseline with some brand new perspective on the universe!"
DMT,34afh9,Mr_Asano,3,Wed Apr 29 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"It didn't feel like a ""regular"" drug comedown for me.  When I was coming down off it my first time, I remember staring out of the window for ages looking at the world and just feeling really euphoric. I felt really good, it was like I had a sense of accomplishment through the experience I had."
DMT,34afh9,Mr_Asano,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:45:23 2015 UTC,So it's not like the acid comedown where you just feel a bit weird after? Also that sounds pretty enjoyable.

DMT,34afh9,Imgodnigga,2,Wed Apr 29 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"For me, it varies. Strong trips have a comedown similar to higher dose LSD visuals for 5 minutes or so, then nothing. Standard trips place me down gently, without any visuals, as if I hadn't done anything. There's always the afterglow."
DMT,34afh9,faster_than_sound,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"Come down varies... On low doses CEV's will just stop and you open your eyes to lsd like visuals for a couple of minutes before those fade as well. On higher doses when you leave your body you will start to ""roll"" back into reality once the visuals start to fade. I have come back to reality rolling on my side many many times and I gotta say it's one of my favorite parts of the whole experience. It's almost like waking up in the morning but instead of waking up from a dream you are waking up to a different world it's awesome. On one unique trip I had I was shivering during the come down. Another one I tried to get up to early and just fell flat on my ass so just stay still until the visuals are almost gone.  Then for the next hour or so you'll feel happy and slightly euphoric.  Mind fuck will last for a while (all day?) don't if that would be considered part of the come down or not.  Happy travels :)"
DMT,34afh9,Molestador,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"That sounds pretty awesome, thanks for the reply. Looking forward to trying it soon."
DMT,34afh9,Dabblin,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:06:49 2015 UTC,"The come down is very smooth. It's like this amusement ride where you get shot up into the air at an incredible rate, and then you glide gently back down to earth. By the 30-45 minute mark after you've inhaled, you're completely back to sober."
DMT,349m1o,afunplatypus1,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:56:11 2015 UTC,You can use mint. You can use tobacco. You can use oregano (ick). You can even use bud.  You basically just want to get the ratio of herb to DMT. This can be 2:1 herb to DMT but my preferred ratio is 1:1. This just means you have to smoke less to get the same DMT dosage.    Happy travels!
DMT,349m1o,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:44:33 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the reply, so basically I just dissolve the DMT in isopropyl, add the herb, and let it sit there until its dry?"
DMT,349m1o,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:07:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, and mix it periodically. It doesn't have to be every hour or every couple hours, but try to stir the mixture at least twice a day til it it is dry. Then scrape it up and spread it around to dry out even further. After ~3 or 4 days depending on the amount, your enhanced leaf should be good to ignite!"

Myself and one other friend are the only people i know whove had entity contact on dmt. I had contact with the same entity on mushrooms.

We are all one, you've never been born, you'lol never die type stuff. Very mothering, and definitely feminine feeling. Second time, I was back in that same space, and I could feel the same presence. I just said hey, i'm back! It made this ball of light appear and swing around in circles to say hello. It was very reaffiirming, meeting the same entity on two substances."

DMT,347lf7,legalize-drugs,16,Tue May 26 11:14:17 2015 UTC,"LSD, even at higher doses gives you the power. DMT deludes you by showing you delusions, albeit interesting, of gods, and itunes visualizers replacing your OEVs.      Da fuck? Guy, be rational. You are experiencing a moment of grandeur and creating your own interpretation of psychedelic substances. Soon this will turn into a stereotypical showdown between drugs. That. is. silly."
DMT,347lf7,Drometheu5,5,Wed Apr 29 06:46:15 2015 UTC,"Does DMT show people other beings often enough? Yes. Is meeting people who aren't there considered a full blown delusion by doctors/psychiatrists? Yes.  I'm not arguing DMT isn't beneficial - it's both beneficial and fun. I am say it does put you in a ""classically"" deluded state, as defined by psychiatrists etc."
DMT,347lf7,Drometheu5,6,Wed Apr 29 18:13:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing DMT isn't beneficial - it's both beneficial and fun. I am say it does put you in a ""classically"" deluded state, as defined by psychiatrists etc.     Listen, you can't just randomly say psychiatrists etc define the altered state while on DMT. You have to cite such things with case studies and actual quotes or footnotes. Rick Strassman never used the terms ""classically"" deluded or delusional. That makes it seem like an uncontrollable disassociation from an experience. Which is the exact opposite of what the altered psychedelic state DMT puts a person in.    You are fully aware that you are in an altered perceived reality. As far as the first person observation is concerned, a breakthrough is a total difference in reality. Whether or not it is a hallucination.    But you can't just go around saying random things because it will become a circlejerk of misinformation, myths, and bias opinion. Its important, especially with illegal substances, to get facts straight.    Its the only way we can have healthy discussions about these peculiar altered states of reality. And I don't want you to get the wrong idea friend. I am just trying to help you."
DMT,347lf7,uncooluserid,9,Wed Apr 29 18:49:45 2015 UTC,"This is all based from personal experience, yo. LSD is a tryptamine just like the others listed, and depending on personal chemistry people react differently to each. Also, very low doses of DMT do exactly what a high dose of LSD will do. It creates a HD effect, a feeling of self reflection and a deeply meditative state.   Additionally, REALLY high doses of LSD absolutely create similar states to DMT. I have been part of groups doing wash outs (taking whatever is left in the vial when you can't pull any more out with a dropper, diluting it a bit with alcohol and splitting it). One particular time a group of 3 of us did this, one of us at hour 3 left her body and was in and out of reality for the following 3-4 hours. When she came back to her body, she was absolutely convinced she had sat with ""ancient cosmic teachers"" and they had extracted her from her body in order to give her a deep informational download. This was not a question for her, she was absolutely certain she experienced it, the same way people have a sense of certainty when taking DMT.  It's all personal and perspective yo, and these things are not quantifiable to all through one persons filter/lens/bias."
DMT,347lf7,uncooluserid,2,Wed Apr 29 04:39:32 2015 UTC,"It's actually categorized as a Lysergamide not a Tryptamine. Different structure, different drug.  I was talking about megadoses ( 400ug to 1600ug). Obviously if you take 20,000,000,000 tabs of 100ug, or a thumbprint, you will eventually shut off enough of your mind that anything can happen. But in normal megadoses 10-15 tabs of LSD for normal people it won't even be close to happening unless you're in the minority."
DMT,347lf7,PussyMagician,2,Wed Apr 29 18:10:19 2015 UTC,"It belongs to a class of molecules known as ergolines. Ergolines all are considered complex tryptamines because they have a large tryptamine backbone and work on the 5-ht 2a are a result of mimicking seratonin, a tryptamine. while it is not a simple tryptamine, it does not mean it is not part of the tryptamine family.   Tryptamines are an entire family of molecules. Many different structures with the same backbone. Ketamine is a tryptamine, just like Dimethyltryptamine, just like Ibogaine which is also considered a complex tryptamine like.... LSD! However I will say that Ergolines are unique because they are very complex, and also contain the phenethylamine skeleton. This makes them unique and sets them apart from other tryptamines, but they are still related.  I would consider this washout that I referenced in a previous post to be in the range of what you are talking about. probably somewhere around 16-2000 ug. The other two of us were mostly fine, albeit some of the most vivid OEV's and CEV's i've had from LSD, neither of us were snapped out. The person this happened to was not under the influence of any other substance, and she was an extremely experienced user with no prior history of sensitivity.  Making the blanket statement that one drug is more clear than the other and more true than the other based solely on conjecture about the experience under the effects of either drug is foolish, and problematic."
DMT,347lf7,Imgodnigga,5,Wed Apr 29 21:00:44 2015 UTC,I have definitely experienced contact with something while on higher doses [lsd]. But then again I have to agree that the contact was much more personal.

However, in Stan Grof's 'Realms of the Human Unconscious' there are many accounts of LSD subjects reporting contact with the 'other', including archetypes, gods, ancestors, super-intelligent beings, etc. But you know, it's different for everyone. Mushrooms and DMT may just be more conducive for those types of experiences, for whatever strange reason."
DMT,347lf7,lienskas,0,Wed Apr 29 06:10:18 2015 UTC,"I doubt they did it on lsd alone.. Unless they were religious types who were forcing a religious experience.

DMT,347lf7,Molestador,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:05:23 2015 UTC,"It was on LSD alone and on higher doses these experiences became more likely to occur. I highly recommend the book - it is based on thousands of LSD sessions, with a fascinating description and interpretation of the different levels of the psychedelic experience. When Grof is describing the deeper levels of the LSD experience later on in the book it honestly reminded me of my last (and most intense) experience with DMT."
DMT,347lf7,spirit_of_mckenna,0,Wed Apr 29 18:14:23 2015 UTC,"How high did he dose? I personally disagree. LSD, to me, remains geometrical, symmetric, abstract, pure, one, and the higher you go, the more oneness you experiene, and trust me, the feeling of oneness hits you like a brick when it is reached. So I'm not sure how even higher doses would make me feel less oneness. LSD peaks are all about transcending the ego and reaching singularity. Maybe his subjects had issues/ substance abuse problems or something? Sounds like a great book though..."
DMT,347lf7,legalize-drugs,2,Wed Apr 29 18:19:24 2015 UTC,"Set and setting. One does not need to be spiritually deluded to experience contact on a psychedlic.

DMT,3469ow,timlazisa99,3,Tue Apr 28 17:12:46 2015 UTC,"Blegh, the spelling and grammar are terrible!  Moreso, whoever wrote this is contradicting themselves just a little bit. Yeah, it's totally subjective depending on personal perspective and individual interpretation, but that also doesn't change the case that people's interpretations of the experience are what make them what they are. People who do these substances aren't looking for cold hard facts, they are often seeking personal insight and self reflection. The only thing the author is proving here is that their perspective is in the more analytically leaning ""this is just brain chemistry"" direction. Which is totally fine, but it's hypocritical to write an article bashing people's interpretation of a personal experience, solely on the personal experiences the author has had. Just like you claim these medicine men know zero information, you would arguably know even less! Yes, it's still an experience based in the mind and is an intangible experience in many ways, but at the very least many (not all) true ayahuasqueros have been working with their medicine for 15-20 years consistently, and their entire cultures often revolve around it. This doesn't change the fact that everyone's experience is subjective, like what was written in the article, but it does incur the truth that having the experience of using a tool also brings with it a deeper wisdom of how the tool works and how to work with it best.  I wouldn't expect you to be good at guitar the first time you pick it up. If you played for 15 years though, I would expect you to have some deeper insight into how to use the guitar than the first time you picked it up, even if our opinions on how the music effects us doesn't match."
DMT,3469ow,uncooluserid,2,Tue Apr 28 22:39:10 2015 UTC,"Another way I look at it, in response to his ""but I didn't go anywhere"" statement, is that yes physically you don't go anywhere, but does that mean that you're incapable of going somewhere consciously? In other words, if you are hungry you physically go to the store and come back with a loaf of bread. The loaf of bread is essentially proof that you physically went to the store, so it's a fact, but if you came back empty handed there is no actual proof you went there. Now if you go to hyperspace and bring something back with you that you didn't have/know prior to the trip doesn't that mean that you actually did go somewhere in some capacity?"
DMT,3469ow,Strappedforcash,2,Tue Apr 28 23:02:58 2015 UTC,Not sure I agree with this but it definitely needs an edit. Re-read it out loud. It will be much more presentable without the spelling/grammar mistakes.
DMT,345y3s,RedSteppa,13,Tue Apr 28 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"You sound to me like you have aspergers. So if you told someone else that, you would probably sense they are missing something like I do to you, so listen up.  Psychedelics interconnect your mind in ways that are not possible through sobriety. What does interconnection do? It produces new IDEAS from the existing body of knowledge within you. OR it reintroduces old ideas/thoughts/memories that your mind had buried are were hard/impossible to access in the sober state. It accesses new Impulses that drive you toward producing change in the world.  You sound like Richard Dawkins to me. When I was 16 Dawkins was a hero of mine. By the time I was 20, I realized that Dawkins had a very narrow conception of life. Science in the 21st century isn't terribly good at explaining people. If it was, economics would be a perfect science. If science was any good at explaining people, we wouldn't have trillion dollar credit crises internationally. If science and people interacted well in the 21st century, businessmen wouldn't still be finding better business opportunities than the entire scientific community.  There are no scientific tools that can beat a creative man in a creative sense. That is to say, there are realms of scientific endeavor that are underwhelming, and frankly rather shitty, at explaining the full bandwidth of human thought.  Psychedelics bridge that gap. Psychedelics don't look like a protractor or a compass, but they are tools just the same. They expand the imagination. Anyone who has been a child, knows how much an expanded imagination can improve the quality of life. At the beginning of every great idea, or moment of change, there is a thought, and psychedelics help you see those thoughts, to see around that corner to the next version of yourself more quickly.  Psychedelics get you in touch with an inner sense of who you are, which in turn makes you able to extract more  out of life.  And infinite other things that I can't be bothered to write.  Four Nobel Prize winners have attributed their discoveries to psychedelics (LSD, not DMT), so your argument is mute. No you will not learn new ""Facts"" or statistics in the world, out of the blue on psychedelics; they're not connecting you to some all-knowing God. They are connecting you to yourself.

By today's science standards, in that moment in time you do not exist. In that moment in time, there is no way (even if someone could even possibly be observing) that the observer could ever ""scientifically"" prove your existence. He cant prove you did exist, can exist, or ever will exist. So looking at topics from that point of view, we can draw a very good conclusion. Things we cannot prove, or disprove, must not, and should not, ever be credited or discredited. Also look into quantum physics, truth gets murky down in that level... and again, much love friend"

I don't talk about beliefs or viewpoints. I talk about if a thing is true or not.    I always entertain the idea that MY TRUTH is wrong   When your ""truth"" turns out wrong, it never was true. Easy as that. It was false..not THE truth. One might of course think of things to be true....and then one might realize that they weren't. But it's not like they were true...till I found out they were not. They just never were true then. An illusion, autosuggestion, misunderstanding, misinterpretation.   Your truth is your OWN.   And that's what I argue about. Truth can't be a personal thing. I just can't. Something is true or false. Both at the same time isn't possible except we are talking about cats in boxes.

I haven't personally experienced any otherdimensional beings of any kind, so I don't really have an opinion on them either way, but the experience is far too profound for me to simply dismiss everything that happens during it as a hallucination.  don't get me wrong, I love science and I have great respect for its approach in the real world. but I suspect this is something science simply hasn't caught up with yet. until recently, meditation was thought to be a crock of shit as well, but more and more research is demonstrating its positive effects on physical and mental health, despite it not being very well understood."

Of course plants are the first step, I have the utmost respect for nature also but it seems people are jumping through and creating unnecessary hoops to grow DMT. Maybe I don't know enough about what I'm talking about, could the crystals actually just grow out from themselves as sometimes happens in nature without the solvent/evaporation? It can be done easily in other forms. EDIT: Nucleation of a singular DMT crystal that is then left to grow."
DMT,341g29,RedSteppa,5,Mon Apr 27 15:47:10 2015 UTC,"Thats a nice idea, but I'm afraid that this won't work out. Think of salt. When salt forms in nature...what was there before the salt? Water...most of the time. Water is a solvent. The best to dissolve salt in. When the water evaps....what stays? Salt crystals. From solvent evaporation. You can't just place a salt crystal somewhere and hope for it to grow. Sadly."

The molecules that can't be in this solution anymore because it's oversaturated will fall out and ""dock"" to the seed crystal. That's why it grows. And that's what it looks like"

I use pyrex dish. i got 3 diff size ones for 10 at my local super market  3: What is the difference between MHRB and ACRB? I believe I'm going to be using ACRB.  Mhrb is illegal now. Ime mhrb is a pink/purple color while acrb is red, very red. Both normally yield the same (though acrb can sometimes yield up to 2%)   Mhrb has less fats and oils but both are simple to use and the end result is the same (i suggest you skip the deffating step if they included it. It is uneccessary.)  4: When is Re-X necessary?  After you are done extracting all the goodies with naptha, put all the pulls together and dissolve in bestine (use a heating pad) and cover the glass container(small cup works) and make a few small holes.  Let it evaporate slowly and it will form some beautiful big crystals. If low on time then dont cover and use a fan. You will get many small crystals.   5: How effective is 'The Machine' for smoking it? I think I know how to make it but can someone explain exactly how to take it?  I have had 99% success rate using a small/medium size bong and sandwiching 50mg of dmt in between parsley(dried). Also a meth pipe works great(google dmt spice device) and the glass vapor genie.

Although glass is recommended.    3: What is the difference between MHRB and ACRB? I believe I'm going to be using ACRB.   It's root bark from different trees with different alcaloid profiles.

This persisted until I was shown by her overwhelming love and guidance that she was nothing to fear. One trip I had a particularly bad fear of being shown hell and being stuck in the dmt halfway dream state. She incepted the idea into me as a scary song came on my Spotify that time was an illusion and I 180'd from being scared with covers over my face to laughing in the face of fear of the song. It was simply awesome. The next trip she basically whipped me with love, I was shouting, squealing like a girl and kicking my legs in ecstasy as I was shown what must've been her full onslaught of worry-free loving, her assuring me there was no need for fear. Again, simply awesome. She's developed into a personal shaman of mine where I can reflect on life and choices. I'd write it down, seriously write down and organize your thoughts into something tangible. I had a fallout of wellness and motivation after a shocking, yet overwhelmingly joyful weekend of LSD and dmt. It took me 3 days to loosely and sub-consciencely organize all the information into useful mind-places. Psychedelics can shatter who you are, both for the better or worst. It's your job to pick up the pieces and make a better self out of the experience. In the words of McKenna, they open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong. Just remember that your reality and the comfort you find in it are absolutely minute slices of the bigger picture that is the universe, that is life.

The closest I've had to it was during an intense changa experience. It was like different entities were rapidly opening a doorway, entering the room where I was, observing and inspecting me, probably doing some unimaginably absurd activity, then quickly leaving.  In terms of insight into the experience, well, it still remains very mysterious to me. However, if you're interested in parallels between DMT and abduction-type experiences, you might enjoy this article I wrote. It's about the hypothesis that both experiences can perhaps (with perhaps emphasised) be explained by psychoanalyst Otto Rank's ideas on the birth trauma. In short, the experience of an entity 'working' on the body can be traced to the traumatic experience of birth, in which you saw fully grown humans for the first time 'working' on your body.  http://www.samwoolfe.com/2014/01/alien-abductions-and-dmt-experiences.html"

These beings had no real shape or form that I can describe, but I also noticed whether they were feminine or masculine. I interpret their message slightly differently though, not necessarily that everything happens for a set reason.   On DMT I feel completely accepted, as they are selflessly caring for me. Infinitely caring. And that leads me to think we should also try to care and give selflessly on an emotional level to other people, so we can grow as emotional, social as well as spiritual beings. I was an atheist before my experiences with psychedelics, yet I now do believe firmly there is more than just this life.  My first time was at 24, and I'm 26 now.

We just tend to forget that. It's like that Buddhist text:   âAn act to make another happy, inspires the other to make still another happy, and so happiness is aroused and abounds. Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the single candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. Those who seek Enlightenment must be careful of each of their steps. No matter how high oneâs aspiration may be, it must be attained step by step. The steps of the path to Enlightenment must be taken in our everyday life.â   I do have the feeling as if these beings are 'enlightened'.

I have many opportunities to work for big firms like Shell, Deloitte etc., but knowing how our current system is destroying the world and dividing people and they are the foremost proponents and actors in this system,  after these experiences I feel that would be wrong. Quite a dilemma, as I do have student loans to pay off :(. I wish I had been exposed psychedelics at an younger age,  but then again, what if's aren't constructive.   I actually convinced a few other people to try it, and they all have stated to have had similar experiences as we do. I honestly believe psychedelics are a valuable tool for humanity to grow, see also Graham Hancock's banned TED talk, I quite agree with that:  http://youtu.be/Y0c5nIvJH7w  Which books have you read so far? I only saw a couple of documentaries on DMT and psychedelics, so far I havent read any books specifically on dmt/ayahuasca but I'd like to!"
DMT,33t92s,afton_circle,3,Sun Apr 26 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on graduating! That is quite a dilemma indeed. The corporate goliath's do need to go; or completely change with the system itself. With such degree's under your belt I'm sure you could push your way into other fields of work? I'm not sure where you are from, but it is possible here in Australia. The sky is your limit mate.  Ah funny enough, its a Graham Hancock book! ""Supernatural"". It's a broad brook in terms of natural psychedelic plants and what not but there are a few chapters dedicated to his experiences with ayahuasca and the shamans. I've also read most of ""DMT the spirit molecule"" book, but i just couldn't get into it, not my cup of tea.  Ironic how ""The War on Consciousness"" is a banned TED talk; whom of which promotes free thinking and innovative discussions... Murica'  Just a question for you, on what dimension do you believe you are in once you ""breakthrough""?  That is, if you see it in such a way."

I will definitely check the book.   Well my theory is that 'they' are a part of us, and we are part of some kind of collective consciousness. I do think it has something to do with afterlife, or perhaps some kind of 'ultimate reality' that coexists with ours. Perhaps that our present life is only a step on the ladder of consciousness, and they are what we eventually could become. Honestly, I don't have any clue how to verify or test these experiences though! What do you think?  Also, check /r/psychonaut and its sister subs!"
DMT,33t92s,Ellis_Dee-25,2,Tue Apr 28 23:05:14 2015 UTC,great read. how do you prepare for a trip? do you put on music?
DMT,33t92s,earthmoonsun,2,Sat Apr 25 19:25:13 2015 UTC,"For this trip we cleared out a bedroom and placed a mattress in the middle of the room decked out with lots of cushions and blankets to make it super comfy and so everyone felt secure. We hung chakra posters and tapestries across the walls, and put candles on. For music, we had some sort of youtube playlist of meditation music, (very soft in the background) however in my trip the song changed which was really amazing for me. You don't need music, but i did find it enjoyable.  I took the hit surrounded by my friends, and after holding it in for as long as i could then exhaling i slowly fell back onto the bed. This is where they say goodbye and took whatever smoking utensil you used away.  Honestly i really rate putting at least a bit of effort into creating a comfortable trip space, its something you wouldn't regret."
DMT,33t92s,earthmoonsun,3,Sun Apr 26 02:40:12 2015 UTC,"you seem pretty experienced so i have a question for you. when you are tripping, do you seem to have a supernatural ability to communicate without words? there have been times where i would be meditating with a friend while under the influence and we were able to speak to each other simply through our ""auras"".. i guess you could say our minds merged together while we were meditating and became one, but two. it was like two souls in one body. as we meditated more we went deeper and deeper, getting closer to the ""truth"", nirvana, what have you.. not sure where i am going here, but i guess im trying to say that i feel like while i am tripping i feel supernatural psychic powers, which not only manifest themselves in my mind but also in my open eye visuals and body load."
DMT,33t92s,earthmoonsun,5,Sat Apr 25 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, i have definitely touched base with what you're saying. On LSD trips communicating without words is very common with me and friends; we have held solid conversations without speaking words numerous amounts of times.  Similar to what you've said, we had to work to get into that state, the deeper we went the more natural it became. Once you start tapping into whatever source it is that allows this to happen, you seem to be extracting the same information and feelings which is where you get that feeling of ""two souls in the one body"".  I can't say i've reached that state with friends solely through meditation though. Apparently some have, something i'd like to experience for sure."
DMT,33s8wm,shaman25,4,Sat Apr 25 03:08:17 2015 UTC,"I think my best trips were alqays when I meditated before and DMT always brings me into a meditative state. However, it could be an interesting experience to try to reach the same state without the substance, and use your brain's ability to produce DMT if you enter deep meditation."
DMT,33s8wm,MafiaZac,2,Sat Apr 25 04:01:05 2015 UTC,"I recommend this too people that are into self-disciplined meditation, it is an art. .

DMT,33s8wm,RaspberryJam,13,Sat Apr 25 04:41:02 2015 UTC,"DMT has been found in the brains of mice, and it has been shown that humans produce endogenous somewhere in our bodies. Given DMT's structural resemblance to melatonin, the idea that DMT is produces in the pineal gland is a pretty good working theory.   Edit: just to be clear, I'm not jumping to any conclusions. Simply put, the mechanics and role of endogenous DMT is an interesting topic."
DMT,33s8wm,Scobufffff,5,Sat Apr 25 04:53:52 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty good theory, and I'm all for it, it just hasn't been proven."
DMT,33s8wm,dirtrox44,6,Sat Apr 25 04:55:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if its proven, because endogenous DMT HAS been proven.  It just isn't 100% clear where in the body it is being produced, but the brain is the best candidate.  The next best hypothesis is that it is produced in cerebrospinal fluid.  Either way, DMT is being produced by the human body, which begs the question, why?"
DMT,33s8wm,devonperson,3,Sat Apr 25 06:03:49 2015 UTC,Not just 'why?' but 'when?'.  Most of the claims made of endogenous DMT levels rising during dream states and at the point of death are based on speculation.

DMT,33s8wm,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sat Apr 25 10:11:07 2015 UTC,I used to snort sub-breakthrough doses  (~40mg) which I used to reach the states you're talking about. I could step back into dreams and memories due to the control and clarity it gives.
DMT,33s8wm,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:34:24 2015 UTC,"For me it was the opposite. The pain was present on the come-up but was relatively nonexistent on the comedown. The runny nose was the only after effect, for me. It's heavily reliant on your ability to accept the pain, acknowledge it and move past it.  The drip makes me cringe... so nasty. The key with that is resisting the urge to sniffle. Sniffling pulls the loose dmt into your throat, essentially wasting it when you swallow. A lot of people say you need 100mg+ to break through but that's nonsense if you do it right. 55mg is my breakthrough point, but I stuck with around 40-50mg for the meditative headspace."
DMT,33s8wm,Demty,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:44:29 2015 UTC,"It's strange I created a post with this same thought but never finished it. This is so true. It throws me into a space for deep thought. I am faced with myself, my true self without ego barriers. It's almost like stepping outside of my normal and seeing myself in a whole new way. You hit the nail on the head. We need to compare brain scans with a normal joe taking a low dose of dmt and a buddist monk meditating. This should prove the enormous benefits of this wonderful substance. Maybe strassman can be recruited."

DMT,33sctu,brado_potato,0,Wed Apr 29 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen any similar results like this so I figured I would share. First I went straight to evap as I do not care about having crystals really, as I will be vaporizing it in my machine and its only for personal consumption. After evaporating off the naphtha I kept the dish at 150 degrees for about 2 hrs then placed it into the freezer for about ten minutes to cool it off. I took it out of the freezer and it scraped up and it was a super viscous honey consistency. I placed it in the parchment in a big glob with the fear that it may actually spill out of the sides but to my surprise when I came back to it tonight it rocked up into this nice 2.5g chunk you see here. The consistency resembles that of bho wax."
DMT,33sctu,migsterrrrr,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:58:22 2015 UTC,"I hate to break it to you, but you fucked up the extraction. Assuming you used only the root bark and not the entire root, your yield should have been 10g of an NMT/DMT mixture and a final yield of approximately 4g DMT. You should care about making sure the final product is as pure as possible so dosage can be properly estimated and undesirable biproducts are not inhaled. If you follow this extraction protocol you will end up with a product worthy of using. http://elfspice.tripod.com/acacia/acacia_extraction.html If you kept all of your layers from the extraction all is not lost as the DMT can be recovered."

I've since picked up a gvg and enjoy it too much to go back to snorting :)  To piggyback on your question, anyone know if ayahuasca provides a breakthrough experience similar to the DMT breakthrough or is it unique?"

After an hour you can feel your thought process changing, physical objects are warping and sparkling fractals. This is where it starts getting really intense and you have that ominous feeling that death/something extremely powerful is right around the corner waiting for you. With your body trembling and face hovering over your purge bucket, your life flashing before your eyes you eventually break through at the ~2hr mark, followed by the death of your self identity/ego. It's an intense rollercoaster of emotions, I've taken the body of people I've wronged in the past, and relived the moments from their perspective while in some sort of twisted dimension. it can get very difficult.

DMT,33qy37,NotTelkin,7,Fri Apr 24 19:58:04 2015 UTC,"Well my advice would be to take it on its own instead of mixing it with another psychedelic. On its own it is one of the most potent psychedelics we know of and, without any experience, it might ruin DMT for you if you try to throw it in the mix with other compounds.  My advice... don't mess with the experience. This isn't really a recreational drug, in the way that MDMA or shrooms are. After you get a few trips under your belt, explore other options regarding combinations with other drugs. Get the base experience and see if it's your thing."

Also dont TRY to breakthrough... just let go and let it tale over if it happens great if not next time. I brokethrough my first time going into the experience with an open mind.

DMT,33qy37,only_spoons,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"Take it on it's own first time.  I smoked DMT first whilst on nothing to get a feel for it. Then I took a tab of acid and when I was peaking I took another hit of DMT. BOOM was in another dimension. Good times, but I'm glad I had a go at the DMT on it's own first.  DMT trips last a short time and you may not ""breakthrough"" first time. I didn't find it particularly traumatising. Unlike acid which can sometimes give me unpleasantly introspective trips that make me face shit I don't want to, I find DMT induces a feeling of joy as it shoots me into another world. Lots to think about, but a very positive feelings. Set aside a day afterwards when you're not doing much maybe, but don't get worried."
DMT,33qy37,shaman25,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:31:10 2015 UTC,"It depends, if you don't mind going through an incredibly intense experience no matter what you go through then sure go for a breakthrough....but if your the type of person that would like it to go easy on them then take a small vape hit and get into the threshold zone and ride it for a bit and then boom inhale another big one for a breakthrough. I find this makes things smoother and easier to grasp. IMO experimenting with different doses is helpful to understand the effects more thoroughly."

DMT,33n6pa,MnFury,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"Could be low quality bark, could be not letting the nap freeze long enough (I do 48 hours at least and not disturbing it during that period, could be not stirring/ mixing the nap enough during pulls. Make sure you're heating enough (125F). Try letting the acidic solution soak more (24 hours) then maybe a 6-12 hour basic soak.   In my experience, any of these factors have affected yield. But not a significant amount. So if you keep getting from the same source and tweak these things, follow procedure to a T, then I would blame the bark.  But hey it looks like you got enough for at least one trip!"
DMT,33n6pa,RedSteppa,2,Thu Apr 23 22:59:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input friend. It is greatly appreciated. I will definitely give that a try. I think I have about 2 solid doses. It weighed at 70 mg. I still have 2 pulls to do as well.

I've made ayahuasca before without any trouble, and unquestionable some of this will be set aside for ayahuasca; but I feel like for something like this I should make an attempt at extracting as well. if only to see how it compares to other barks I have."
DMT,33nyx1,usernamethatwasleft,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"Good advice. I'll also add, regarding drug testing, that DMT is broken down so fast by your body that they'd need to test you right after you've smoked it in order to detect any significant amount.  Regarding your intimidation, don't sweat it. Pretty much anyone who has done it still gets the jitters before taking off. If it becomes overwhelming just remember to SMILE! Seriously. If you're in a trip and it's a little too in your face, you can still talk yourself through it all. Tell it it's beautiful, or say thank you (sounds silly, but it works).

DMT,33kan0,threwahway,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:40:15 2015 UTC,Next time go straight to base and don't use any heat. You'll pull just as much without getting all those fats and you wont need to re-x. Check lazymans for more info.
DMT,33kan0,threwahway,2,Thu Apr 23 16:46:28 2015 UTC,Sorry what are he's?  Does STB help reduce the fats in the pull? I'm curious because I usually go with cybs hybrid a/b tek.
DMT,33kan0,threwahway,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:43:15 2015 UTC,I meant HEAT. I fixed it.
DMT,33kan0,threwahway,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:17:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, removing the acidification and the need for heat keeps a lot of the fats and other plant material out of your final pulls."
DMT,33kan0,threwahway,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:18:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Thanks. I heard that cold teks usually sacrifice a little yield for less fats and goo, but I have yet to try it out."
DMT,33kan0,ifiwereacat,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:01:40 2015 UTC,Your basic solution shouldn't be cold. It should be room temp ~70-80 Fahrenheit.  Is it really yielding less if you have to spend a bunch of time/energy re-xing to get the same amount as if you had gone stb?
DMT,33kan0,ifiwereacat,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"Eh. Not really concerned with a re-x, I'm happy with a good yeild. And I would've gone straight to base but a pound of shredded rootbark is a lot of mass and I don't have anything to hold it all"

So anything you can do to get into a good frame of mind, such as the things you mentioned, will help you start the trip on the right foot. Staying happy and optimistic are important... and difficult, when things become intense. Just smile and talk to your trip... say ""thank you"" and ""beautiful.""  As far as smoking method, it depends on how much you can invest. A glass vapor genie is the best, in my opinion, but it'll run you $109.

DMT,33g6fr,shway250,30,Thu Apr 23 10:28:15 2015 UTC,It's also entirely possible that Egyptians had already seen the interior of the brain. They weren't exactly squeamish around bodies.
DMT,33g6fr,lethal_meditation,6,Wed Apr 22 12:33:22 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the Egyptians valued the heart as the location of a person's soul. During mummification the brains were removed and disposed of indifferently while many of the other organs were preserved.
DMT,33g6fr,bulldogsarentbadgers,8,Wed Apr 22 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"Bulldog, you can't infer that they were disposed of indifferently.

DMT,33g6fr,bulldogsarentbadgers,8,Wed Apr 22 17:22:15 2015 UTC,"Organs that were preserved in jars were valued as necessary for the mummy in the afterlife. Brains were removed by mushing them up after making a hole through the nose, and then emptied out through the back of the neck.

Brains just kind of fall apart if they aren't handled in a certain way. I'd be very surprised if they had any idea what the inner structure of a brain looked like, they probably thought it was just a bunch of mush.  Like I said, I'm no expert, but I'd be surprised if they had done vivisections anywhere near accurate enough to ascertain internal nervous structures."
DMT,33g6fr,GarlicandOrchid,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:11:51 2015 UTC,"There is evidence that the pyramids' blocks were ""molded"" in place rather than cut and stacked, so it doesn't seem that there is necessarily a significant body of lost technology.

The ego dissolution you speak of, to me that is very reminiscent of the idea that we tell ourselves many stories to get ourselves through things. Once taken beneath the surface, thoughts and ideas can combine in novel ways, leading to a trip. Where I'm going with this- these are all abstractions, and when you get to a point where   think what I was seeing as I came back down was part of how my brain constructs reality from visual sensory information   you start to become highly aware of these abstractions.. You begin to change the game. There is a point (infinite amount of them I s'pose) where each individual will meet their limit. The human body is not immortal, and the mind is not endless.

How did you obtain it if you don't mind me asking?  Tripping on LSD made me see things in a new light for sure. Although I was looking at things I'd always observed, I saw them in completely new ways. Yet it all felt extremely familiar. The most awakening thought I had was right at the beginning, entering the forest, when I had this INTENSE feeling that I'd been there before. Certainly I never had, yet I felt I'd experienced the entire night prior.   After a couple months of 'integration' I retained/regained the perspectives I'd discovered on acid, and am now able to see things the same way while sober. I can look at patterns that are certainly still, yet see them as if they were moving and swirling slowly, like wet paint. The paint never dries.  Peace.  EDIT: Also you mentioned that you vaped the DMT. How many times have you smoked DMT, have you ever not vaped it? It vaping it more of a pure trip?"
DMT,33d7j8,imares,2,Thu Apr 23 22:51:35 2015 UTC,"Haha, lemon jelly is the best man, so many great trips listening to their music. I'd love to discover more music like that.  There is so much we can learn about ourselves and the universe through these substances, I think it's important to think and or read on psychedelics even though the visuals are incredibly beautiful. Although I don't mind getting lost in them every once in awhile. I mean sometimes on DMT there's not much you can do but be amazed, lol.  Yeah you can vape it or take it with an maoi like ayahuasca. Vaping lasts 5-15mins, ayahuasca lasts a few hours. I prefer to vape it since I don't have much free time to trip anymore. Look around online there are lots of ways to get it, many plants contain dmt, just remember that extracting it is illegal so don't do that! =P"
DMT,33ek8k,wally3791,9,Tue Apr 21 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"What is the point in going to the park on a sunny day? This question is just as arbitrary. For me, I don't expect to learn the secrets of the universe. I just want to experience something that forces me to look at things/think differently. I reserve my judgment over whether or not there is intelligence behind the DMT flash, but the experience alone... being ripped between realities that seem equally tangible... this makes me ask questions.  Her or the DMT? Drama queen..."
DMT,33ek8k,smokinjoe65,3,Tue Apr 21 22:00:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, she can be at times.  I see her perspective and understand why she thinks the way she does.  I just can't seem to get her to at least admit the possibility that her point of view may be flawed, even after admitting the same for myself.  I her mind, she thinks one day she'll have to explain to our kids why ""daddy has to go be alone and get fucked up for his spiritual nonsense"".  That notion seems beyond absurd to me, (not to mention insulting) for reasons that are likely obvious to anyone reading this thread."
DMT,33ek8k,Eternasphere,3,Tue Apr 21 22:18:36 2015 UTC,"What if you were a devout christian, and she was an atheist?  Would she have to explain to the kids ""daddy has to go to church to do weird voodoo bullshit"".  She probably won't come to understand exploring the subconscious like you do.  And stop thinking who's right or wrong about the significance of the experience.  Is it signifficant to you?  Then that answers it."
DMT,33ek8k,Eternasphere,2,Wed Apr 22 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"You also shouldn't deal with ultimatums in a relationship.  It's your business.  Maybe just talk about dmt less, for if i were christian, i wouldnt talk about god to my atheist girlfriend."
DMT,33ek8k,socialstapler,9,Wed Apr 22 21:02:53 2015 UTC,"DMT aside, her actions and reasoning seem very immature"
DMT,33ek8k,WubbaLubbaDubbDubb,9,Wed Apr 22 04:23:34 2015 UTC,"You're asking so many (too many) questions that arguably do not have tangible answers. Some psychonauts lean towards the spiritual, others do not or concentrate more on scientific considerations. You and your girl might not be as compatible as you'd have liked/hoped.  Some folks just like to experience the effects of drugs and that's their straight-shooter M.O. Some like to latch a firm grasp of brain-teeth on that shooting star of wonder and ride that bitch as far as it'll take the mind. It's important to understand that neither type of person is inherently bad or good, right or wrong. Both types have negative extremes: the sloppy, inconsiderate hedonist or the snooty esoteric doosher that either can't come down from the cloud or won't.  Figure it out through meditation or conversation, or both. Good luck, meatbag."

It'll be taught by a scientist who invented the nicotine patch, and studied the effects of LSD on patients in the 1950's. I haven't met him personally, but as far as I understand, psychedelics in general improve the health of mentally ill patients. My professor will affirm this once I take the class, but I believe it's safe to say that this would be an effective argument for the usefulness of psychedelics in general.   In a sense, psychedelics are a medicine for those who have mental health issues."

DMT,33ek8k,GingerHamLincoln,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:15:54 2015 UTC,What's her reasoning?
DMT,33ek8k,brightstarblack,2,Sat Apr 25 01:55:31 2015 UTC,"I had the same goal of using Dimitri, spiritual enlightenment. I don't know how else to help you besides providing my own experience. A little back story, I have only met Dimitri a couple of times and this was after a bundle of meetings with Lucy and Alice. So I had a pretty good handle on my own spiritual identity before I decided to fall into the abyss. My first experience was beautiful. I was led though the experience with two entities that made sure I was comfortable. This obviously made it seem to me that it brought me closer to a higher plane of existence where I could communicate with these beings. However, my second experience made me doubt that. Now I am on the fence of whether it, it brings me closer to higher beings or smaller ones. When I talk of smaller beings, I mean the atoms and the cells that create the make-up that is me. But the answer to that was not an answer I was looking for; I wanted to better understand my subconscious self. After two times, I felt I had a good enough understanding to where I was satisfied. I especially didn't want to push the boundaries as I was shown what I needed to see. Asking for more would only be selfish. If Dimitri somehow shows himself in my life again, I would gladly join him.   So what I am trying to say is if you still feel you have unfinished business, then you should continue. Do you really want to have the idea in your mind always asking ""What if,"" whenever the thought comes by? I barely know your situation, so this is something you need to answer. All I know is that the feeling that I have found what I needed is a great burden off my shoulders."
DMT,33ek8k,cenalan,2,Wed Apr 22 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"I think there is something more to it.  Today I listened to Terence McKenna talk about ayahuascaros who can see on a different plane.  This allows them to see the past present and future as a single dimension, and can see who stole in the community. Also the inside of peoples bodies, in that they see the whole person inside and  out, thus allowing them to diagnose and hopefully cure illnesses.  in one documentary I saw how a woman and husband who went through an ayahuasca ceremony had the shaman tell the man he had an illness, and his wife was carrying a son, both confirmed by doctors upon returning to the US.  I'm sure there are other examples, but I for one don't view it as bullshit. I think it may be a link, if only, to using parts of our brain we don't usually use in perception."
DMT,33ek8k,Drometheu5,2,Wed Apr 22 03:49:05 2015 UTC,"I am blessed to have experienced something truly profound with Dmitri's help. Without going into specifics, the love and bliss that I felt were so far beyond anything that I have ever experienced before or since that the event changed my whole outlook on life. Now, was that love being sent to me by an external, spiritual, force or was I accessing a deep and profound part of myself through the assistance of a chemical?  In the end, I believe it doesn't matter. Either way I experienced something profound and transformative that has reshaped my perspective. Wherever that power of bliss and love resides I want to know it better, and bring that back into my day-to-day life. Somehow I can become a person who shines that love onto others, and helps them start their own investigation, and I have to try to become that person.  Whether from inside or out, DMT showed me a potentiality I had never dreamed of, and challenged me to become a significantly more evolved consciousness. I am eternally grateful."
DMT,33ek8k,dr_cocks,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"Experiences of altered states of consciousness is limited by our language, and artful platforms when sharing them with others. It is a struggle in its own right. One of the reasons I identify with being a ""psychonaut"" is that these experiences intrigue different aspects of my mental and physical self.  Curiosity and the freedom to use tools for traversing one's own psyche, or wherever the psychedelic experience takes someone, is very personal for me.    I've been in your situation. Either people understand, do not understand, accept, or deny anything and everything you say to them. It is a bit black and white but that is how it plays out for me so far. If your SO presented you to choose between them and a substance then perhaps you should re-evaluate why such a situation even occurred.    Don't get me wrong. I had the same feelings as you did. But I am grateful I decided to leap into hyperspace. One of the main reasons I even wanted to try this entire fiasco was because I thought I had the mental capacity to derive and reflect on these esoteric metaphors and visions. This is a very confusing thing for me. People are still trying to play catch up with what the hell psychedelics are and how they should be used.  I am willing to be misunderstood. But as time passes and I slowly become wiser things make sense. Of course, truth cannot be understood for certain things - there are too many obsticles: interpretation, irrationality, belief, ignorance, and above all else the lack of experience. Right now I subscribe to the idea that to truly understand the abstract you must experience it for yourself.    Anyway, I been rambling too much. I hope you find closure to your issues that came up because of your decisions. I feel for you. Don't stress over this."
DMT,33ek8k,jelrond,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:00:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe just do it on your own and don't tell her. I now it sucks lying to an SO, but clearly she has no interest in your interests and only cares about herself and her own feelings in this situation. Just like everything else, there is no point. But we find and make things meaningful to us to give ourselves purpose. Is she religious? If she is, what she's doing would be like you giving the ultimatum ""give up trying to be one with God or we're through."""

I WILL learn something, though I dont know what it is yet. Might me positive, might be negative - depending on what you experience and how you can integrate it.  In general:  It seems to be a bit of fear in her judging - which is absolutely comprehensible for me when it comes to DMT. I only have few experiences. I is a molecule that many shrooms/lsd users would not touch though they are very positive towards psychedelics in general.  But you can not argue with fear :)  Just talk a bit less about it, trying to convince somebody can easily lead to a rejective attidude, I make the same mistake sometimes :)   But keep on going with DMT if you feel like it. You probably only have this one life, so make the experiences you want to make."

DMT,33eqww,smokinjoe65,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:13:59 2015 UTC,Yeah. It'll take forever to get the naphtha out of your freezer. Consider all of the food in there that isn't tightly sealed contaminated. The freeze precip is meant to lower the temp of the solvent = low saturation point = DMT crashes out and crystallizes. It needs to be air tight so ice doesn't form in your naphtha and the naphtha doesn't evaporate :/
DMT,33eqww,smokinjoe65,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:33:13 2015 UTC,"The freezer is an old chest freezer so there's no food in it, and the evap dishes are sealed tight. Should I remove the evap dish from the freezer and let the Naptha evaporate?"
DMT,33eqww,smokinjoe65,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"I throw mine in the freezer for a few days, undisturbed, so crystals can form on the bottom. Then I remove them, pour off the naphtha into my recovery jar to save for later, and air dry to get rid of residual naphtha. When you remove them, you have to pour off the naphtha quickly so the crystals don't have a chance to ""melt"" back into the naphtha.

DMT,33aegg,nowheretoday,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:18:59 2015 UTC,I took it and blasted off. The lost thing I heard was my friend telling me to sit down and I sat on a recliner and just melted into the chair. My body didn't die literally but my connection to it did. I felt nothing physically. Mentally I left the physical world and went into a different level of tripping. All I saw was colors. Everything was so bright. In my head colors and shapes were shifting and moving the whole world became an optical illusion but I didn't see anything that actually was real. Then I came down and real things started to reappear again and then I puked hella hard and regained my strength.

That's how it's supposed to work, in my humble opinion. I think you're supposed to just decide one day, ""If I ever get the chance, I'm gonna do DMT,"" and just wait patiently until the opportunity arises.  I'm gonna come back and comment further on some of the particulars of your report when I have more time, but in the meantime, I humbly encourage you to give my article detailing my experience a read.

DMT,339mi1,TehDominator,6,Mon Apr 20 19:19:40 2015 UTC,Your ending statement is what ruins trips. DMT is one of the most intense psychedelics known to man and is very far from timid sleep paralysis. You are entirely lucid the entire time and you have zero control over anything that happens.   Do it with friends if you don't know what you are getting into.
DMT,339mi1,Xavon,3,Mon Apr 20 19:34:57 2015 UTC,Yes you are right but I have seen very bad stuff with sp I have not read any bad trips with dmt.
DMT,339mi1,Xavon,5,Mon Apr 20 19:41:15 2015 UTC,"You are mistaken. While DMT is quite kind in its destruction of your mind, it spares no-one. Some aren't ready for what happens and the only way to know is to try.  Good luck! I know you will be fine."
DMT,339mi1,mqduck,2,Mon Apr 20 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe I've never done enough or it hits me weird or something, but DMT is by far the least stressful psychedelic I've ever done. I was on a pretty anxious LSA trip once and DMT absolutely nullified the anxiety every time I hit it. It's the opposite of anything I'd describe as ""sparing no-one"". It's a warm and cuddly psychedelic I'd recommend to first timers due to its low stress and short duration."
DMT,339mi1,smokinjoe65,2,Tue Apr 21 11:10:14 2015 UTC,"It isn't that you see bad stuff. The stuff you see is great. The thing is that your world is ripped away and it may be terrifying, even if you think you'll be fine. Hell, it's terrifying for me sometimes and I've experienced it quite a bit."

DMT,339ec4,zootedpolarbear,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:22:02 2015 UTC,"First tell him to be wary fuckin with going hard on tramadol, shit is flame but will cause seizures when you eat enough for what some people need just to get high. And he better not be mixin that shit with any thing but dank nugs. Any way, a blast off isn't required. One of the perks/skills of being an experienced tripper is understanding that sometimes less is more. Due to this being a dedicated subreddit I imagine this will be looked down upon, but I recomend  some mollifyed introspection. Talk about it to an interested but unbiased person while rolling tits and figure it out. When you want to love someone again, a proper dose of MDMA (classic 100) or a little less so your thought train stays on the tracks will do no harm. I don't recomend rolling with him and talking about it (first of all if hes still on tramadol it'll fry em) because you'll trap him out of his roll. When doing MDMA (or any psychedelic really)it's very important to make sure you aren't trapping any one into the experience. Since you haven't done DMT before, you'll be more worried about the essence of the trip, but you could totally, with experience, mold a blast off around a person. I've only done it while rolling though, so that might be an important element of it. A first roll can bring just as much insight as a first trip. Do it with people with the intent of having a just a good roll, but remember the goal at some point. Set and Setting is finicky and unpredictable, because all of those things tend to change once you're there and everything happens."

DMT,335ah8,dmtpsychonaut,4,Sun Apr 19 22:58:40 2015 UTC,A machine. Really efficient way to vape deemsters.
DMT,335ah8,JCreezy2112,2,Sun Apr 19 22:59:09 2015 UTC,What's protecting it from the flame?
DMT,335ah8,swaize,4,Sun Apr 19 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"The way this works is you (should) melt the DMT into the brillo (in the neck of the bottle) then heat it with flame. Though it looks like his flame might be on top of the crystal, it's likely not. It's just getting it as close as possible."
DMT,335ah8,RaoulDuke209,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:43:11 2015 UTC,"So when you load it, do you put dmt powder in the neck, then push a brillo bung in on top?"
DMT,335ah8,swaize,2,Mon Apr 20 07:43:09 2015 UTC,Brillo stays in the neck at all times. You set the powder on the brillo and heat the neck just enough for the dmt to melt into the mess of brillo. I think it's to expand the product t giving it surface area.   That's essentially what you do with a meth pipe. You heat the Glass and roll the crystal around on as much heated surface as possible.
DMT,335ah8,RaoulDuke209,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:05:30 2015 UTC,"Nothing, chances are he's pulling the flame directly into the brillo as he breathes in. The pull of air also pulls the flame with it, and as you can see here, that flame is straight up in the neck. He's probably burning the shit out of it here."
DMT,335ah8,uncooluserid,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:03:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That's what I thought too. Looks like the first time I tried it, when I cremated it in a pipe!  I now get how you should control the flame to vape, but in this example, how should you load this device?   You put dmt in neck of bottle, then the copper wire bung in on top of it?"
DMT,335ah8,swaize,2,Mon Apr 20 07:48:40 2015 UTC,"in the case of the machine the way it is meant to be loaded is as follows: Put your well cleaned copper wire or wool in the neck of the bottle about 2.5 - 3 inches from the actual mouth of the bottle. Place the DMT on top of the copper wool and then using a lighter apply enough indirect heat to melt the dmt into the wire/wool. Then once it's melted, you can turn it slightly more vertically so the heat from the lighter is rising instead of you just breathing the flame into the molecule."

But their question was foreign I could not understand When then suddenly I'm ripped up and placed into a mouth And it swallowed me down at which time I head south Well I woke up to see them, these two mighty steeds With their mouths grinning wildly expressing my needs As they stood there above me, being flanked on each side I felt no need to fear them, no reason to hide So I reached up to touch but they faded too soon Yet their mouths still remained and stacked up towards the moon How that ladder of mouth waved so soft in the night And I looked up in awe at that beautiful sight And I dreamt about climbing into the night sky But I knew had I touched them they'd mouth back 'bye bye' So I got up and walked down the path in the dark And there deep in the distance my eye caught a spark Of a crab twice my size with incredible strength Oh it greeted me kindly and then we all drank And we drooled out together right onto the ground And the ocean grew up quickly right up all around And the earth looked at me and said ""wasn't that fun?"" And I replied ""I'm sorry if I hurt anyone"" And without even thinking cast me into space But before she did that she wiped off my own face She said better luck next time don't worry so much Without ears I couldn't hear I could just feel the touch As I feel asleep softly at the edge of a cave But I should have gone deeper but I'm not so brave"

DMT,334k2m,MigoNads,6,Sun Apr 19 15:19:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, LSD didn't prepare me for DMT (not that I took it to prepare for DMT...). The only thing it may help you get used to are the visuals on the DMT comedown. Unless you do large doses of LSD it doesn't really compare. Really, there's nothing you can do to fully prepare for it. Hell, even when you've already done it you don't know what to expect.  Just remember that you will make it out alive, and SMILE if it becomes overwhelming. Even saying things like ""beautiful"" or ""thank you"", or even saying hello to anything you might see may calm you and make for a good experience :)"
DMT,334k2m,smokinjoe65,2,Sun Apr 19 16:24:04 2015 UTC,Hes right. Unless you do a pretty hefty dose of LSD you won't be familiar with the feeling at all. can confirm large doses are similar but dmt is much much much more clear and freeing.
DMT,334k2m,ThePeskyWabbit,4,Mon Apr 20 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see the responses you've received.   As has been said, never assume there's an order for readiness.   But if we were going off of what would have all the factors of an awesome entry drug to psychedelics most wouldn't realize how perfect dmt is.   When people come into psychedelics they often expect that cliche you see in movies and dmt is the closest to that. While being one of the most extraordinarily visual psychedelics DMT comes with a few safety features as well as being a kind of trial run to the experience.   First off. DMT has such a short duration compared to most other chemicals. Average span of other drugs? I'd say anywhere between 4 and 8 hours. DMT? A good 30minutes... an hour if you count residual effects. When I think of someone who wasn't meant to try psychedelics and think of them coming up on mushrooms I nearly cringe knowing they've got a 3rd of their day devoted to that experience. Mushrooms are beautiful don't get me wrong but their completely mental and relentless. A cool safety feature integrated into DMT is that it couches you. You're pretty much enveloped in the experience and couldn't generally get up and do anything stupid if you wanted to. That's not to say you're paralyzed and shit couldn't happen but it general doesn't almost like salvia it holds you down for the trip but in a more gentle fashion. A lot of people who try mushrooms never push it far enough into the visuals and only catch the trippy heads pace weird body high and alien feeling of them and are detoured from psychedelics in general. DMT really takes the cake on how fast and prevalent the visuals are so there's no really being unsure if you did enough.  I feel like if I were going to want to try something I'd want it to be quick and easy until I knew if I liked it and then explore it on my own. DMT gives you that. Smoke a little or smoke a lot you guide your experience. If you like it a lot and want more from it move into ayahuasca or even experiment with other natural tryptamines with yopo or cebil. Hell invest in bufo venom! But know that before you push DMT into the extreme you can always try it in its more forgiving forms."

DMT,334k2m,GeirOlafs,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:38:09 2015 UTC,Do lots of research and read lots of reports from both experienced trippers and first timers trying dmt. Use your own judgement and what you think your own conscious can handle. No one will EVER be prepared for a full blown dmt breakthrough it is really intense. IMO having some psychedelic background will help calm you during the experience resulting in a more beneficial/fulfilling journey. If you decide to do dmt for your first psych just start with a low dose before you breakthrough all the way.

It doesn't matter how big the hole is because you put a straw through it then cover the rest with duct tape. That's pretty much it. Just make sure you rinse it well after breaking it to get rid of microscopic glass shards. You don't want those in your lungs.  As far as the copper mesh, make sure it's copper and not galvanized wire because if you burn that, it will release harmful chemicals. Burn the copper before hand until it turns black and red and doesn't release any more smoke. Then, roll it up into ball about the size of the opening of the bottle and voilÃ ."

DMT,333uoa,tomdavesy,1 point,Sun Apr 19 10:36:23 2015 UTC,Cloupor Mini does look like an exceptional grab for me down the street simply for me to attach a proper RDTA (I know some people prefer just dripping the juice with regular RDAs but I like the idea of filling up a tank. But either way if my little 11 watt battery can get the job done for the time being with the DMT and a wax concentrate atomizer  screw on the little Itaste MVP battery that would be excellent.
DMT,333uoa,XanonymousX,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:26:20 2015 UTC,There is a method for suspension of dmt in pg. You can then use regular atomizers or rda's to vaporize the liquid. There is an article on erowid about it.

DMT,333i95,LeprechronicChris,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:57:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah certainly good. Also I hear that before you freeze percip you should precipitate at room temp for the purest initial product, then freezer precip to evap"
DMT,333i95,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:50:19 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear because about 10 minutes after I placed my first pull into the precip dish, crystals started to form. By the time all 4 pulls were in,  there was a lot. It was sitting at room temperature for maybe 45 Min before I wrapped it and put in freezer"
DMT,333i95,LeprechronicChris,1 point,Sun Apr 19 09:31:21 2015 UTC,Evaporation won't remove impurities in the naphtha. It will only promote better crystallization due to how saturated the naphtha becomes.
DMT,333i95,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:06:48 2015 UTC,"I think there's a miscommunication here, what I'm saying is he should do a room temp precipitation for one grade of product, a freezer precip for a slightly different alkaloid profile, finally an evaporation of the naptha to pick up anything that didn't precip out"
DMT,333i95,chozobody,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:52:01 2015 UTC,"I figured you were inferring that precipitating at room temp would remove impurities (when you said ""for the purest initial product"") which it wouldn't. When you evap, it's just naphtha evaporating, not anything that may be in solution other than DMT. With or without a room temp evap, what you get is what you get. It won't make it any more pure. Sorry for the misread."
DMT,333i95,Dcomplex,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"So how long should I keep it in the freezer? And once I take it out, should I evap the remaining naphtha or just pour it off and fan dry?"
DMT,330zps,LegDayEveryDay,7,Sat Apr 18 13:29:38 2015 UTC,"Love Dennis! I agree that at the core it is meaningless and more a product of our mental need to categorize into dualities to ask whether these are DEFINITELY SPIRITS or DEFINITELY JUST THE PSYCHE... what if the spirit is the psyche, and vice versa, and all psyches and bodies and plants on the planet are linked together in a way too singular, profound and apparently contradictory for us to appreciate? The most important thing is always that we learn and question - fundamentalism serves no one except to give the arrogant a chance to manipulate people and for the fearful to keep living in cold comfort."
DMT,330zps,GenetSaisPas,6,Sat Apr 18 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"I think I may actually appreciate Dennis over Terrance in many ways, and this is evidence of that. Dennis does not deny spirituality or the meaningfulness of the unexplainable, but he does have a significant scientific background from which he can draw knowledge. It's best to realize that both spirit and science are realities that coexist and believing in one does not preclude you from believing in the other. In my opinion anyways."
DMT,330zps,JManSenior918,3,Sat Apr 18 21:04:31 2015 UTC,"I think the value of Terrence was that we sometimes need a character who is only GUNG HO. No caution, no advisement of caution, and no embarassment. It's a counterweight to all of the things in the world that say, ""This shows that it may have great benefit. Now, we're not saying you go out and do drugs, of course. Ha ha, but it definitely shows promise."""
DMT,330zps,pavetheatmosphere,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:37:08 2015 UTC,"I see your point and I don't necessarily disagree, but throwing caution to the wind can result in poor decisions being made. Terrance himself was an incredibly wise and intelligent person, but I'm sure that his words have inspired people to make less than intelligent decisions. Also, it does kind of add to the stigma of drug sub culture, which of course makes any form of legalization or even reform much more difficult."

DMT,331zt4,boxmore,2,Sat Apr 18 19:19:25 2015 UTC,"I've read many comments on different forums saying it's not a very efficient method. If you can get your hands on a bowl piece, then a gravity bong is probably your best bet. You can get massive rips, use the ash or herb sandwich method. Broken through plenty this way."
DMT,331zt4,Interversity,2,Sat Apr 18 19:45:59 2015 UTC,This is probably much more efficient than the iron lung. There's a lot of cool surface area inside a 2L bottle for the DMT to condense on before you get to inhale it.
DMT,331zt4,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:56:15 2015 UTC,"Haha I have never thought of using a gravity bong, it sounds quite funny. If only one could gravity freebase."
DMT,331zt4,totric,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:24:59 2015 UTC,What do you mean? You can put freebase in a gravity bong.
DMT,331zt4,Interversity,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:44:03 2015 UTC,"A freebase pipe aka a crack pipe is what I am referring to. You sure can put freebase in a gravity bong, but it surely won't vaporize nearly as pure/fully as a freebase pipe."
DMT,331zt4,totric,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:06:13 2015 UTC,How long does it usually take the DMT to vaporize using this method?  Have you managed to breakthrough using this method?
DMT,331zt4,JManSenior918,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"It's really disgusting, hard to do properly, and for most people results in terrible efficiency. My experience would say: don't do it."

DMT,331zt4,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:22:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, an oil burning would likely be better. Every time  anyone I know has tried the bottle/foil method it ends up melting the plastic too. So you're literally inhaling melted plastic. The best method would be making the machine, there are many guides available and I know that at least one has been on the front page of the sub today. Also check out r/deemsters, there's a great guide in the sidebar there if you can't find one elsewhere."
DMT,32zcdb,smokinjoe65,6,Sat Apr 18 00:07:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like the ""breakthrough"" dose is not as high as people think it is, due to improper vaping/loss of material. Another note for beginners is you probably won't vape every last mg - it does take practice and especially getting used to the inhalation."
DMT,32zcdb,OfficialYoungNitro,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:09:22 2015 UTC,Indeed. I definitely agree with this.
DMT,32zcdb,moustache4you,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:24:27 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity what is your preferred method for consuming?
DMT,32zcdb,Dcomplex,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:32:27 2015 UTC,"I use a GVG. My next favorite is snorting. Not a fan of crack/meth pipes or bongs, sandwiching, etc. GVG is the most efficient method by far, in my experience."
DMT,32zcdb,dmtpsychonaut,2,Sat Apr 18 05:28:37 2015 UTC,Far be it to me to say again that if you want a consistent dosage each time and an almost guaranteed way to breakthrough then making Xhanga or eleaf with your spice is easy and 100% the way forward.
DMT,32zcdb,Dcomplex,1 point,Sat Apr 18 09:11:51 2015 UTC,"Seconded. So very much easier to manage than freebase. If you can smoke weed, you can smoke e-leaf."

DMT,32zcdb,ThePeskyWabbit,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:32:02 2015 UTC,I assume you use a torch lighter? Do you find that you burn the DMT if you use the lighter too long? I'm just getting started with this method.
DMT,32zcdb,Imgodnigga,1 point,Sat Apr 18 08:29:35 2015 UTC,I do use a torch lighter. I use it until the filter is glowing (lighting for ~5 seconds) and I pull. Haven't burned it yet.
DMT,32zcdb,GenetSaisPas,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:28:32 2015 UTC,"My preference is changa. It is easier to consume(bong) and will last longer. You can still achieve breakthrough, if you have enough, and may actually have a more inspirational journey."
DMT,32zcdb,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:29:30 2015 UTC,Right you are. I believe it to be around 30-40 done right and held in
DMT,32zcdb,GenetSaisPas,3,Sat Apr 18 14:19:34 2015 UTC,Man I should start visiting this sub more often. Who gives advice like that? ALWAYS start with a low dose. 50mg would definitely be pretty intense for a first timer. Then again there are always exceptions that's just my opinion...
DMT,32zcdb,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:08:42 2015 UTC,"Well Jesus are you going to tell them how to properly do it?! That dosage wont work if you sprinkle it on a bowl and burn it with flames. ""Crack"" pipe or other method of vaporization is the most efficient way; the molecules break down in open flame very quickly."
DMT,32z4kx,Traveler333,2,Fri Apr 17 22:54:49 2015 UTC,"Not an illustration but hey, I put a solid amount of time into this haha...  http://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/2w96ii/how_to_breakthrough_with_your_freebase_pipe/  What do you mean by ""spice""? You need the freebase  crystals in order for a glass pipe to work. Try holding the hits longer and being more patient while heating the bulb. Eventually you will get to a point where you can breakthrough with one hit."
DMT,32z4kx,Imgodnigga,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:59:41 2015 UTC,"thanks, I remember seeing your post a few weeks ago and I actually copied it down! It was helpful but I'm a bit unsure how to take the hits. For example when I inhale slowly the white milky vapor, how long is recommended to hold it in. Now another thing I was wondering about while I'm holding it in do I continue to keep the flame under the bulb or do I pause with the lighter until I am ready to exhale?  Maybe I'm a bit unfamiliar with the correct terminology but when I said spice I meant white crystal freebase from a MHRB extraction.."
DMT,32z4kx,Demty,1 point,Sat Apr 18 07:37:50 2015 UTC,Light it again after 10 seconds of holding it in. Give your first hit 5 more seconds as you light the second hit. Hold all hits in about 10-15 seconds.
DMT,32z4kx,Imgodnigga,1 point,Sat Apr 18 11:55:36 2015 UTC,Thank you for enlightening me so that I can further be enlightened.
DMT,32z4kx,Damnaged,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:59:46 2015 UTC,Hold the hit as long as possible. You shouldn't remember exhaling. If you are patient with heating the bulb it should be hot enough to were you can just hit it with out holding the lighter underneath.  If that doesn't work try hitting the bulb with the lighter still underneath. Hold that for 15 seconds. Then hit it again with the lighter underneath and hold that for as long as possible.  It really is just a think you need to experiment with and get the hang of for yourself. It took me about 3 attempts before I got it down and could blast off no problem. Cheapest and most effective way IMO.

DMT,32z4kx,boxmore,2,Sun Apr 19 07:37:31 2015 UTC,"All I can suggest is to quit trying to ""Break Through"". If I can say anything about DMT it's that if you try to get something specific out of it you won't get it. Just relax, try not to go in with any prior notions about what it should be and just let it take you. I would give it a break if I was you also."
DMT,32z4kx,azkasins,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:01:29 2015 UTC,"Keep the lighter nearly 1-2in away from the bottom and let the substance heat up into a liquid, when you start to notice a bit of smoke start to inhale slowly, i mean slowly, then continue heating it and inhaling, making sure prior to inhaling, exhaling everything out of your lungs and your breathe in will be the one inhale you need to hold in to breakthrough-hold in that one inhale until you feel like you may pass out and then get ready for a ride where there is no oxygen, whenever i breakthrough i lose all sense of my breathing which is uncomfortable and has caused me to get anxious when I was first coming into contact with the substance but it is the key to breaking through also i've used this method on way more than multiple occassions with a 100% success rate even with friends who have never tried it before... im a bit pushy and i force them to inhale and hold it in so they get the experience the first time, and i let them know how serious and sacred the substance and experience is beforehand of course. multiple hits always resulted in a no-breakthrough experience for me at least."

Like really hard to a point were you thought you we're gonna throw up from coughing for two minutes straight? If you are trying to breakthrough with one hit, do that. The pipe should be hot enough so you can just pull on it slow for a long time while still pulling the vapor off the melted bit (or you could do it fast)... Either way would get you there :)"
DMT,32zjxo,Imgodnigga,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:13:30 2015 UTC,That's a good question!  I know I could get the machine or a bong but what I have now is a freebase pipe so for me this question is very relevant. If anyone out there can give constructive guidance it would be most appreciated :)

DMT,32x2wy,smokinjoe65,3,Fri Apr 17 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat and had a very similar experience. Since then I've taken a break from the substance but will revisit in half a year or so probably. I think frequent use was the main factor of my experience. Try spacing out your trips more. Also, try to translate and implement what ever you experience into your life afterwards. This will make for more fulfilling trips in the future with less fear. Happy travels :)"

I do take time to integrate powerful trips, but I blasted through twice this week, which may be a little disrespectful to DMT and it's potency.

DMT,32x2wy,dmtpsychonaut,0,Fri Apr 17 18:26:24 2015 UTC,You have to go beyond the veil to know. They turned you away because you weren't ready.
DMT,32x2wy,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:55:20 2015 UTC,"I've had dozens of breakthroughs. It isn't that I didn't break through to that other place, it's just how, this time, there was more turmoil and I was more unsettled than usual regarding having my reality torn apart. Trust when I say I've been behind the veil plenty of times, however you want to interpret that, including the trip I describe here. This description is an infinitesimally small slice of the entirety of the journey I took this morning.  I've experienced DMT to a great extent, high and low dose, snorted and vaped, but I was reminded that these realms aren't as predictable or navigable as I wanted to believe."
DMT,32x2wy,foodd,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:50:05 2015 UTC,"Unless you're saying you completely understand the universe, DMT still can hide many truths from you. Maybe even ones that shatter your concept of the world you live in. Maybe truths that you aren't ready for."
DMT,32x2wy,dmtpsychonaut,3,Fri Apr 17 22:58:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you wholeheartedly. I don't know if there is anything I can learn and bring back that comes from outside my own mind (I reserve my judgment on whether or not dmt flashes are from a different, freestanding reality separate from ours) but perhaps there is an intensity of experience that is still greater than the ones I have encountered so far.   I thought the interaction with entities, the dissolution of self, and the shows they put on (creating things, revealing things about the hyperspatial environment, etc) were the extent of a dmt experience, which made me a bit complacent and lowered my guard. Until now, I didn't realize how close I could come to being confused over which reality I belonged to (during the trip, not after). There was always the instance of forgetting about this reality, but I had always maintained a distance between myself and full immersion into hyperspace.  Maybe you're right... perhaps my subconscious self (or the intelligence behind the dmt flash) is keeping me safe until a later time. We will see :)  Also, I'll throw out that this trip was from a 20mg dose... far smaller than other doses I've experienced (averaged 45-75mg before I learned how to effectively consume the substance). Potency of dmt shouldn't be underestimated, either... here's my powder I vape.  http://imgur.com/a/3QynV  It looks yellow, but it's near pure white. My kitchen light has a yellow hue."

DMT,32ywpm,IMightKillSomeone,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:05:01 2015 UTC,Dmt can be sourced from many various plants from around the globe. The most commonly used plants are Mimosa Hostilis and Acacia Confusa. The dmt nexus is a great place to start to try and get a grasp on how to extract from each of these plants. Personally Cybs' hybrid tek could be one to start with.
DMT,32zaz4,jfrufru99,4,Fri Apr 17 23:54:29 2015 UTC,You need to do more research. Right now. Do your parents consent to you using dmt? I'm guessing not since you are waiting until they go to bed. Please do more research. Have you had any psychedelic experience before? Sorry if I sound harsh... Just don't want you to have a bad experience! :) like maybe your parents walking in to your unresponsive body and freaking the fuck out while freaking you out in hyperspace. That would not be good.

DMT,32s6xb,RedSteppa,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:26:45 2015 UTC,"Unless we're about to get into string theory, we can only really make assumptions about the other dimensions.   One thing I've learned is that during a DMT trip, practically anything is possible. In whatever other hyper-space realm that OP was in, he probably did see a five dimensional object because five dimensions there might have nothing to do with conventional theories of dimensions in our present universe.  But that's all just really my opinion. I try not to challenge other people's beliefs too much if they don't interfere with my own."
DMT,32s6xb,HydraulicFractaling,5,Thu Apr 16 10:33:30 2015 UTC,"make assumptions about the other dimensions.   Exactly.   he probably did see a five dimensional object    He had a hallucination of an object, that appeared five-dimensional to him. Wheras one has to say, that we aren't able to percive 5 dimensions. So basically he imagined it to be 5-dimensional.   because five dimensions there might have nothing to do with conventional theories of dimensions in our present universe.   So...basically you are saying OP is talking BS?"
DMT,32s6xb,RedSteppa,2,Thu Apr 16 10:45:20 2015 UTC,"Not at all. Just saying that he did hallucinate seeing a five dimensional object, and therefore is entitled to interpret that any way that he wants to."
DMT,32s6xb,HydraulicFractaling,4,Thu Apr 16 10:48:32 2015 UTC,"Yes...you're right. What I want to say is just that, we shouldn't take assumptions we make while beeing under the infuelnce of a strong psychedelic drug for REAL. They may appear real, of course. But they are a hallucination. Although so beatiful sometimes. ;)"
DMT,32s6xb,RedSteppa,3,Thu Apr 16 10:59:55 2015 UTC,"Just playing devil's advocate here, but who is to say that consciousness can't transcend dimensions with the help of DMT? I mean what we interpret as hallucinations could be communication.    Not that I really go for that, but we know so very little about the inner workings of our minds and our own consciousness that the possibility shouldn't be ruled out simply because we interpret the data in what we believe to be a visual hallucination."

DMT,32s6xb,RedSteppa,3,Thu Apr 16 13:34:10 2015 UTC,"He's shared his experience with you.  He's told you that he feels he's perceived a 5-d object in his mind.   You dismiss this as ""bullshit"" and say that ""we aren't able to perceive 5 dimensions"". How do you know that?  Just because 'real' space has 3 spacial dimensions?  That doesn't preclude the possibility of perceiving more. Who knows what concepts the brain is capable of perceiving?  You've dismissed his statements, and demanded proof, while providing no proof for your own.     In any case, If you want to start demanding that we only talk about 'real' things when describing our experiences with this substance, then I think you either are missing the point or asking for the impossible.  However the main reason I dislike your comments in this thread is that they are negative and disrespectful. One of the great things about this sub is people being so open with their (often very personal) experiences.  If most of the feedback was like yours, then it wouldn't be like that for long."
DMT,32s6xb,accola,0,Thu Apr 16 13:56:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for criticism although it isn't really contructive.    How do you know that? Just because 'real' space has 3 spacial dimensions?   It seems to have more than three, although we aren't able to percieve more then that.    That doesn't preclude the possibility of perceiving more.    What is standing to reason?   One smokes a psychedelic drug and while beeing in an altered mind state with STRONG hallucinations (that's what it is man) where one THINKS one is able to percieve more dimensions.  or  One smokes a magic crystal that let's you see into the realm of machine elves and santa clause?   You've dismissed his statements, and demanded proof   I didn't. I asked him how he could KNOW this. He can't. He can think this, but he can't know. That's a huge difference.  I'm sure he percieved what he percieved. But taking things for REAL which appear in hallucinations is dangerous. Exept one wants to live within in a fairy tail.   However the main reason I dislike your comments in this thread is that they are negative and disrespectful.    The truth may appear disrespectful to you. But I'm not responsible for that."
DMT,32s6xb,RedSteppa,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:11:15 2015 UTC,"There are decent discussions about not being able to sense a 5 dimensional object. Though in my experience, its possible to know at OP situation an if so explaining how or what (true contents of) the know was/is/whatever is probably near impossible, here, with the forms of language commonly used in and basically just the physicality.  Given the high tendency of DMT to cause mathishlious or geometric/fractal-like visions it does not seem unreasonable to (en/in)vision another form of life or entity(s) in similarity to the imagery encountered as 'mechanical' 'machine' 'elf' .?! Mechanical/machine implies using geometry as a main forming ideal design and even function form, it would be easy to develop a tendency to assign such a distinction to that form of distinction as a form of forms, to reiterate-in the relational tendency (perception generation) in which normalization of the abstract or notbefore occurs from intrinsic automagick amalgamations. To speak of this generally in simple terms: If you did not do this form of 'normalization' & 'tendencies' n such every single variation and/or iteration of notbefore-sensed sensory input (perception,sense) would carry possibility to render you in a state of incapacitating/intoxicating awesome and/or/maybelike amazement.    There are definitely more interesting questions to ask and notions to ponder."
DMT,32s6xb,The-Internets,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't mention anything about elves or other such things. Perhaps I'm not being clear.  One can perceive an object,  that would be impossible in the real word,  without it necessarily having existence outside of ones mind.   The mind makes models of the real world, and this is what you perceive.  It's not beyond belief that in it's altered state, his mind was able to model and perceive an object with extra dimensions."
DMT,32s6xb,accola,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"Well there are actual ways to visualize five dimensional objects. For instance you can draw a cube on a piece of paper and that's representing a 3d object as a 2d one.  You can also use time as a dimension - for instance imagine tracing a sphere as it goes through a plane. It would start as a point, become a growing circle, and then as the widest part of the sphere passed through the plane shrink and disappear. You can represent the 3d sphere as 2d changing through time this way.  Similarly you could imagine a 4d sphere as a 3d sphere growing from a point and then shrinking.   The truth is there are actual techniques to visualize higher dimensional objects. It's possible that using DMT helped OP use them.  While * possible* though I'm unsure if that's what happened."

I dunno if mhrb is available in Aus or not.   As far as recrystallizing it, in short, all you do is put the powder/gunk into a Mason jar or shot glass depending on the batch size and add warm naptha (NO OPEN FLAMES!) till its all diluted. Then stir it up lightly until it's dissolved. Let sit for an hr or two until you can see that all the gunk has settled to the bottom. Then use a turkey baster to suck the naptha off the top. Be careful to not get any of the crap that settled to to bottom. Put the naptha into a sealed container and freeze on your freezers coldest setting for at least 24 hrs. Knock all the crystals off the bottom and side of the frozen container and pour through a coffee filter. You should have muuuuch cleaner spice now. Let it dry for 12 to 24 hrs and enjoy =).  Fair warning, if it is really dirty spice you will lose a ton of weight. I have seen 14 grams of real yellowy stuff drop to under 8 grams, but it all depends on the original potency. I would recommend reading up on a full recrystallizing write up before attempting. I banged this short tutorial out on my phone. Best of luck in hyperspace!"

DMT,32oyvk,DrDeems,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:41:48 2015 UTC,"It's a curious sensation, the hum. One thing I would like to include is swallowing. Swallowing gives a very distinctive feeling, like a long series of clicks, it reminds you that your body is still there.    You've been here before, it says.   who knew a molecule could have such a personality?"
DMT,32mmky,Shamanic-Council,2,Wed Apr 15 00:26:46 2015 UTC,"Great job on an enthralling and well written report!  This one caught my attention especially with the descriptions of the tentacles. If you look on page 4 of my article on the experience, you'll see that the beings I encountered had tentacles, a feature about which I was rather perplexed. However, I haven't read a lot of user reports that mention tentacles, so it's great to see I'm not the only one, albeit the source of the tentacles is different in our two reports. But having seen you describe them as ""a giant mass of writhing golden tentacles"" has kind of made me think that perhaps I saw a similar mass of tentacles prior to them forming into the beings. But it's been such a long time since my experience I can't say that with certainty.  Equally as interesting is your mention of the ""hum you hear when you start the journey,"" though I would love to have you describe this hum in greater detail, I'm not sure if that's even possible given how indescribable it is... But I remember this too, though in the larger scheme of things, it was such a small part of the trip I never included it in my article... But it really is like the ""ringing of life"" or some shit... it's so disconcerting to hear.   It became frightening to me that I may lose my mind and remain trapped here   Just wanted to point out this is a sensation I felt as well, as you'll notice if you read my article. This is another thing I haven't heard many users report. I love finding someone who experienced a similar aspect of DMT as I did. :)"
DMT,32mmky,ChuntasticMcChun,2,Wed Apr 15 02:01:01 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that both you and /u/Shamanic-Council experienced a hum/ringing.   In a nonfiction book about near-death experiences called ""Life After Life"" by Raymond A. Moody, Jr., there's a short mention of ""The Noise"" that is common a part of NDEs.    In many cases, various unusual auditory sensations are reported to occur at or near death. Sometimes these are extremely unpleasant. A man who ""died"" for twenty minutes during an abdominal operation describes ""a really bad buzzing noise coming from inside my head. It made me very uncomfortable .... I'll never forget that noise."" Another woman tells how as she lost consciousness she heard ""a loud ringing. It could be described as a buzzing. And I was in a sort of whirling state."" I have also heard this annoying sensation describe as a loud click, a roaring, a banging, and as a ""whistling sound, like the wind."""

DMT,32mmky,earthmoonsun,2,Wed Apr 15 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"He mentions that toward the end. :)   ...realizing that past, present, and future are all the same thing. They are melded together.   The second part of your question is very good, and I'm interested to hear Shamanic-Council's response."
DMT,32mmky,ChuntasticMcChun,2,Wed Apr 15 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"I see. However, to my understanding this revelation doesn't fit to his trip report. Just this thread here shows that there actually is time. For example, the past is his experience, the present the current reading, and the future are all the upcoming comments."
DMT,32mmky,earthmoonsun,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"You've obviously never done DMT lol and I say that without an ounce of condescension. :P But if you had any experience with DMT you wouldn't be so quick to discard that sentiment so easily.  How to explain this... Well, first of all, us psychonauts are not the only ones who make such out there assertions regarding space and time; there are a lot of theoretical physicists who spend their days contemplating theories even more seemingly absurd than the one to which Shamanic-Council alluded. Here's a very thorough article which details some of the craziest examples of such theories. And here's a great interview with a physicist on the subject from Wired.  The reasoning behind why it might be possible for time and space to be a singular entity despite the linear reality of our lives comes down to perception; who's to say that just because we perceive time as being linear, that it actually is?"
DMT,32mmky,ChuntasticMcChun,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:34:06 2015 UTC,"You've obviously never done DMT...     yes   if you had any experience with DMT you wouldn't be so quick to discard that sentiment so easily.

Thanks, I'll read them   The reasoning behind why it might be possible for time and space to be a singular entity despite the linear reality of our lives comes down to perception...   Ok, now that's an interesting point. Does this eventually mean, that we in our normal state might perceive our world/life through some sort of filter, and when this filter is removed (e.g. on psychedelics) we perceive the true nature of things?"
DMT,32mmky,earthmoonsun,1 point,Thu Apr 16 09:01:54 2015 UTC,"First of all, I just realized how much of a douche I sounded like in my comment, so sorry about that.  But yeah, I mean that would be one of many possibilities. That's a very astute way to put it. And indeed, that we perceive reality through a filter is pretty much scientific fact, if you regard the chemicals our brain synthesizes and uses as neurotransmitters as that filter. Which would make sense, given the effects that any drug impart on users are created via the introduction of a foreign chemical to the user's brain chemistry.  But I'm not a theoretical physicist :P"
DMT,32mmky,ChuntasticMcChun,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:01:48 2015 UTC,"First of all, I just realized how much of a douche I sounded like in my comment, so sorry about that.   No problem. Anonymity and non-face-to-face communication makes me sometimes sound harsher than I meant it to be, too. Nothing personal.  I really hope that in the future there will be done more research in areas like neurology about psychedelics. It's such an interesting topic that might improve life and help to understand ourselves better. And I should stop being too coward and just try it..."

(  Smoked DMT is remarkably safe and easy to utilize because of its duration. No matter what the dose is, for a few minutes you're the HIGHEST YOU'VE EVER BEEN and if you play your cards right you'll be the most SOBER and clear headed you've ever felt. It's part of your evolution.  After you've built a relationship with that realm it'll be time to brew the tea, but there's NO RUSH!! Have someone there for you whenever you take the medicine, not as a guide but an anchor. DMT deserves a shamanic ceremony for proper integration but you gotta work with what Ya got."
DMT,32med1,Falkreath,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:39:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply man. I appreciate your insight. Baby steps is probably the ay to go. If dmt is anything like salvia then i definetely want to be prepared. I already bought the goods though haha. It would be a shame to let them go to waste. I'm gonna look into synthesizing the chaliponga. It seems pretty difficult. Do you have any experience?
DMT,32lyuw,DMTandTAO,16,Tue Apr 14 21:18:55 2015 UTC,"Up that to 80-100mg. You need more when snorting it. It will sting, but be a man about it and you will be rewarded. Also, you will sit there for a good two minutes before it starts to hit you, so turn on some chill music, lay back, meditate, and try your best not to mind the sting. Of course, come back and update us. It's an amazing experience, given you're in a good place and feel safe. You won't have the vocabulary to describe it unless you're really poetic about it"
DMT,32lyuw,phyyr,2,Tue Apr 14 21:31:30 2015 UTC,thank you for the advice. I decided not to snort because my friend came through with a pipe and some ash. I made an update by the way. It was a successful first time today!
DMT,32lyuw,smokinjoe65,11,Wed Apr 15 04:12:42 2015 UTC,"if you intend on railing it try to crush it up as fine as possible, for a smoother hit + more dmt surface area"
DMT,32lyuw,smokinjoe65,6,Tue Apr 14 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"I began my relationship with DMT by snorting, with no previous experience with insufflation. The product I make is nearly white and is always powder fine. I have had a good amount of experience snorting and have only recently started vaping.  There is discomfort, and some people can deal with it where others cannot. I found it uncomfortable for the initial stage of the trip (laying down in preparation) but, if you have a decent amount of control over what you're focusing on as you go into it, you'll find it easy to work with the discomfort and ease into your breakthrough.  Regarding large doses, don't. At least not at first. Find your sweet spot, starting at around 55-65mg and go up accordingly. My highest dose was 75mg and it was my most powerful snorting experience. I broke through for over 15 minutes and came back to my apartment still under the influence (similar to a very strong LSD peak) for 20+ minutes.   Make sure it is very fine. I recommend a re-x, however, to get it cleaned up. You don't want goo in your nose.   When you breathe it in, don't snort it hard. Too much suction will create a god awful drip by shooting it past your mucous membranes and onto the back of your throat, inevitably wasting part of the dose when you swallow it. Furthermore, don't sniffle during the trip. This also creates a drip. The discomfort won't go away until you accept it and move on. Trust me, it isn't as bad as people say.  Lay as still as possible and let it carry you deeper. Again, don't start off with 80-100mg. Get your technique down with a moderate dose and you'll find you can go further with less. In addition, ignore posts referring to you needing a MAOI, along with posts saying it needs to be in salt form. Freebase is fine and works just as well as any other method.  Good luck, be safe and have fun!"
DMT,32lyuw,DMTandTAO,2,Wed Apr 15 00:55:12 2015 UTC,"thanks, Joe, I actually decided to vape it. I made an update comment if you're interested. It was your advice on the tek that helped produce my first successful yield! Thanks buddy :)"

DMT,32lyuw,budstryker,5,Wed Apr 15 04:18:44 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: So I decided NOT to snort because I didn't want to go through any pain on my first DMT trip. Instead, I put 120 mg in a pipe in between two layers of ash from weed and slowly vaped it with my friend, and between us, 3 tokes were had each. It was outside in his backyard. He lives in the country (were in Texas), so it was overlooking a pasture with some cows in the distance and some tall grass. There was a slight drizzle of rain and a small breeze, but it was nice and cool probably about 70 degrees.  For anyone interested in the trip itself, this is how it went:  After the 2nd toke, I immediately lost control of my body and my friend told me I dropped the pipe on the 3rd hit. Immediately I felt scared and anxious as to having no control over my mind and body. There were bright colors and shapes everywhere. I looked out to the pasture and say tiny flowers of yellow and purple and orange flowering up and a river of white mist ever so slightly rushing around the field. It reminded me of being on Pandora from Avatar, the only thing I can compare it to. Is this considered a breakthrough? I don't know because I'm still trying to process some of the other visuals I got, mainly a dancing white orb that had a female aura about it. My mother maybe? I have had her and my grandmother who is going through chemo at the moment, on my mind recently.   Right around 5 minutes I lost the visuals and started to slightly come down, though I was having trouble forming sentences. I looked at my friend and he described his visuals and he also noted the presence of some sort of entity communicating to him, but not in any physical form. It was just like the feel of his abstract visions were trying to tell him something in code. Then we talked about how Terence always talked about the ""syntactical intent"" of psychedelics in general and that next time we should go in and try to decipher some sort of message.  The trip was neither pleasant nor unpleasant. It was just intense and the feeling of losing control was the most ""unpleasant"" part, though it wasn't. It was simply different.   The most important thing I learned today was to REMEMBER TO BREATH. I was so absorbed with the colors and visual acuity, that I wasn't breathing and when I did realize I needed oxygen I started breathing heavily like I had just come to the surface after drowning and it freaked out my friend who was his first as well."
DMT,32lyuw,budstryker,4,Wed Apr 15 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call this a breakthrough, but more like getting your feet wet. When you break through, there will be no mistaking it. I wouldn't mix it with weed personally as I've done so many times - you will feel good from it, but the experience will be dulled and you'll have trouble remembering it. Basically, you won't really gain much from it as you would smoking it properly. I would look into proper lighting techniques for pure deem, changa, and snorting it (which I highly recommend - the come up is much more gentle than smoking, and the sting is honestly not that bad). Happy travels"
DMT,32lyuw,Jezio,7,Wed Apr 15 04:50:48 2015 UTC,Do. Not. Snort. That.  Layer it in a bowl of weed. You will be in so much pain if you snort that

DMT,32mm2g,falls330,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"It was definitely only possible because of the low dose I was on.  Had I been on two hits instead of one I think I may have fallen down.   But yeah, try a low dose and go up to some plants and start touching them, it felt magical."

I wouldn't think the washing soda is good enough to get the pH high enough to separate the DMT from the plant material. I'd go with cyb's hybrid atb salt tek if you're working with ACRB. I get white or off-white crystal development every time. You don't have to worry about any nasty raw materials making it into your finished product if you follow the directions.

DMT,32lx13,shihen,2,Tue Apr 14 21:05:35 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I literally just 2 hours ago had my first ever DMT experience. Low dose, but my goal was specifically to familiarize myself with this intense onset people talk about.  I knew to expect a body buzz and sudden shift in perception but it still caught me off guard of course. The body buzz especially. It was also so, so rapid, within seconds. It was really a ""wow holy shit whooaaaa"" 100mph elevator ride.  Despite feeling like I had every reason to be freaked out about it, I was able to remain very calm and just ""let it happen"". And despite my inexperience, I have to attribute that feeling of releasing control and staying calm to meditation. I meditate somewhat regularly, and made sure to meditate before my trip. I just sat in a chair in my garden and stilled my mind. I let myself grow familiar with my surroundings, breathed calmly, and quietly observed my situation, in my mind and in my surroundings. I contemplated what I was about to do, why I wanted to do it and how I felt about it calmly, like turning over a stone in your hand to observe it.  After the experience, while I can remember how it was scary in those first few minutes, I'm looking forward to trying a stronger experience soon. I'd encourage you to practice meditation, I hope it helps. If you still feel worried, try lower doses just to become familiar with things, the more you do it I'd suspect the more comfortable you become in that space."
DMT,32lx13,Myrcene_box,2,Tue Apr 14 23:09:16 2015 UTC,"This sounds a lot like how I work my way up too.  I often close my eyes and lay down and just use a mantr like ""let go"" or ""no clinging"" to remind me to just observe and not let my mind get caught up in the intensity.  Works so well.  But practice makes perfect.  Use that a lot in every other moment in life and it helps tons."
DMT,32lx13,brightstarblack,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:53:35 2015 UTC,"Hi, I understand that onset feeling. I felt like I was taking off on a spaceship. A ""straight vertical upward direaction going at 1000 mph"" feeling. This is what I'm kind of spooked out about. It's rapid, you don't know what's going on, and you can't anchor yourself to reality due to how overwhelming it is. My plan was to indeed meditate before doing DMT but I don't meditate very often(I stopped a while ago and forgot about it). How much do you recommend I meditate for?"
DMT,32lx13,Myrcene_box,2,Wed Apr 15 03:35:20 2015 UTC,"I don't meditate on a strict schedule or anything. I mostly do mindfulness meditation which you can do while you're doing any other activity. I do it when I remember to, or feel it might help my current disposition. It feels quite easy to me but I understand it's more difficult for some people.  But meditation is a skill that like any other skill you improve with practice. So I'd say meditate as much and often as you want or can, with the goal of becoming better at it. Once you develop a handle on it, it really becomes quite a useful tool."

I would feel either really spaced out and hear a very light ringing in my ears but it fades away within seconds. I have never truly broken through but there were about 2-3 attempts in which I believe I was very close. So I've done it in smaller dosage but I want to break through. The onset in lower doses is not what's spooky. Do you think trying lower doses and trying a higher dose in the same day(maybe around 1 hour apart) may help?"
DMT,32lx13,ThePeskyWabbit,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:20:02 2015 UTC,shit you could do a higher dose within a few minutes of coming back down. I had a HARD break through on 50mg using the machine.  I would recommend trying 35mg and inching up from there.

DMT,32m7y1,phyyr,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:36:48 2015 UTC,"I do it both with light (sunlight) and without. Most of my trips have been in the dark, either in a dark room or with a blanket over my eyes. This allows your CEVS to become OEVs, which is more comfortable for me, physically. However, the orange color of the sun through your eyelids makes for some wonderful visuals.  Seeing light through your eyelids may affect the visuals on a lower dose trip, but once you break through, everything is replaced.   I say do it without lights. You'll get an experience that isn't altered by excess outside stimuli."
DMT,32m05a,Myrcene_box,4,Tue Apr 14 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"For your naphtha separations, I recommend stirring gently instead of rolling/shaking. Stirring will do a better job of allowing you to achieve a good, homogenized solution. I stir for 15 minutes continuously and allow it to settle for 30. My solvent layer is clear as glass, if not a tad cloudy, and I pull it off making sure I don't disturb the basified mix (or the milky interface between the mix and solvent, if present).  I've done every combination of settling times... 3 hours for acid, 2 hours for basification, 24 hour acid, 24 hour basification, and combinations of each. My root bark is powdered so I didnt notice a huge difference, but you may benefit from a longer acid wash to aid in breaking down your barks cell structure. Your pH with vinegar will rely on how much water you're using, as well. Use a bit more vinegar to further lower the pH but remember that you will need more caustic solution to raise it to where you need to be for basification. I'd stick to the measurements of the tek without worrying too much about pH numbers.  I do make sure my salt is dissolved. This only requires bringing the water to a boil and stirring. It dissolves in <1 minute. I then rinse the pan with 100mL of h2o to get the rest of the salt.  Your bark should be okay, but shredding further will make it easier for the DMT to find its way out.  You can smoke the goo, but I recommend combining your crystals and goo, then performing a re-x with warm naphtha. When it dissolves you will see brown gunk at the bottom that can be removed, or you can pour off the clear naphtha and leave the goo behind. This helps clean up your DMT. Take your new naphtha and do another freeze precip. Dry thoroughly. Chop up and dry again.  You can leave the pan out, but throw saran wrap over it to avoid contamination.  Good luck next time :) Here's a pic of the initial pull of one of my recent batches using most of these tips http://imgur.com/oJHcQZ0"
DMT,32m05a,smokinjoe65,2,Wed Apr 15 08:46:40 2015 UTC,Thanks! Very helpful. I'll be trying again next week.
DMT,32m05a,kushdaddy,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:11:20 2015 UTC,What do you mean by chop up and dry again? My friend was trying to do this and we're we.got stuck was when we took the jar eith naptha and cystals out of freezer and tried to remove them from the naptha they would melt rather quickly at room temp implying they were still wet. Is there something more I should be doing that I don't know about?
DMT,32m05a,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:11:46 2015 UTC,"I use flat pyrex for my initial pulls, which makes it easy to pour off the naphtha for dry crystals. For my re-x I use a small beaker and wait until it is all crystallized on the bottom, pour off the naphtha again and dry, like normal.   My point in chopping it up and re-drying is that, as thickness of your dmt deposits increases, surface area decreases, leading to plenty of spaces for naphtha to get trapped in between the crystal structure. So, after my initial re-x drying period, I'll break up the crystals in the beaker and allow it to dry again. You don't want to assume your dmt is good after one dry session without breaking it up to release anything trapped inside."

I'll be the first to admit that there are others here who know much more about the science, but I've learned a lot through trial and error. We're lucky in the fact that extraction is relatively easy with a little room for error (except for pulls... that's its own science). Working at a chemical plant gave me a head start on following my procedures and knowing where things went wrong, without having to guess.  I'll try to keep contributing for everyone to learn from my success and mistakes :)"

My ceremony consists of some pranayama (breathing techniques), playing my Tibetan singing bowl (to calm the nerves and be present, lighting some palo santo wood ( to smudge and keep away bad energy and have some incense) and the last and most important part is to have an intention for the trip. I've gained so much more knowledge by having some sort of intention before each deem trip. Very beneficial."

No lyrics, just very ""zen"" music, specifically Splendor of Color on youtube. This led to absolutely amazing experiences, but you need to remember one thing: don't latch onto the music and pay too much attention. It will impede the breakthrough. You WANT the breakthrough, trust me :D  I've also gone without music, in low light. I wanted to see what my mind could do with DMT without excess stimuli. These experiences were also unbelievable and, I feel, the breakthrough was more easily achieved.   It's a double edged sword... music could make a breakthrough more difficult but it's good to be able to connect to it when a trip is overwhelming. In turn, the lack of music makes a breakthrough easier (maybe) but, if a trip becomes too much, you only have your mind to rely on for soothing yourself. I always just smile and say ""thank you, it's so beautiful.""  Good luck, be safe and have fun :)"

You had to rush to /r/DMT ....    Look Guys!!! LOOK!!! LOOK!!! they said bad things about our drug it can't be true huh guys?    OP really... whether or not things are proven in a lab or study to be addictive is irrelevant to everybody but you and every carbon copy of you. There are treatment facilities for people addicted to collecting things. That's not even taking a drug. Lol   I used to smoke tons of the spirit molecule. Tons I say. I'd sit on my back porch with a glass rose and a welders torch and vape to perfection grams upon grams of that shit like it was crystal meth. I didn't wanna put the pipe down, as soon as I felt myself reaching earth and could move my hands I'd blast right back off haha that drug grabbed me tight.

I honestly don't see the point of your post, aside from trolling. For a person without an addictive personality, it is weird to read on websites (or from people like you) how addictive this drug is, especially when all of the research done on the compound states that it isn't physically or psychologically addictive.  I love playing xbox and masturbating, but even I realize it's not an addiction, but rather something I really like doing. Sometimes people need to assume some accountability for their actions. It wasn't DMTs fault that you sat on your back porch and blasted off too often. Most people would think ""wow, this is great... but it's time to go be part of reality for a bit.""

DMT is not heroin, it is not cocaine or meth, and it to say it's even remotely in the same ball park in terms of addictive qualities not only does injustice to people who REALLY struggle with drug addiction, it presents an image that this substance is in the same general boat as truly addictive shit.

DMT,32gsh0,crackercider,2,Tue Apr 14 03:13:15 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in prolonging the trip, you should use an MAOI, like Syrian Rue tea, 45 min before ingesting DMT. Once the enzymes are activated, they will breakdown DMT very quickly before the psychoactive effects can occur, so theoretically if you had IV DMT on a slow drip, it would eventually have no effect."
DMT,32gsh0,dirtrox44,2,Tue Apr 14 01:53:57 2015 UTC,"You would black out.  Sure it would make it more intense,until your body can't take it anymore.  A breakthrough is a breakthrough;  it can't get any more intense.  A breakthrough doesn't depend on the dosage,more of the intake technique.  Everything over 100mg is a possible blackout."
DMT,32gsh0,NotTelkin,2,Mon Apr 13 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"A breakthrough doesn't depend on the dosage,more of the intake technique.   Well, when you say this you mean that not every method is as efficient. It's the dose actually consumed that matters, because often when smoking that 50mg in the bowl isn't actually all absorbed. This is why i said injectng, because it has a 100% bioavailability. Of course other factors come into play with achieving a breakthrough, but to a lesser extent.  If I was to inject 35mg (according to strassman the ideal dose for me to breakthrough), then ontop of that perhaps 30mg, surely that's not enough to blackout? People inject 65mg in one dose and fare fine.  That's the thing, what would it do?"
DMT,32gsh0,Xavon,3,Mon Apr 13 19:10:51 2015 UTC,Any dose beyond breakthrough dose has the potential to make you black out. What is the point of trying to go past the impassable? Your body will be unable to handle it at certain doses.   There is no point in trying to extend or increase the effects. If you have to do something like that the point has been missed entirely. It is not necessary.

DMT,32gsh0,NotTelkin,2,Mon Apr 13 22:58:09 2015 UTC,"The main reason that I was asking this was to see whether it would actually extend a DMT trip. Theoretically, if that worked then I was imagining an IV drip, that would occasionally push DMT resulting in an endless trip haha. Of course only theoretical, it was just a thought I had."
DMT,32gsh0,AStudyInScarlet,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:09:26 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry,I was wrong.Thank you for explaining that to me :)  I never consumed DMT myself and only shared my knowledge about it.  But in my Expirience with lsd you can increase the dose as long as you're not starting to peak. It would act as a regular booster.  You should definetly feel it getting more intense but while you breakthrough,you will not realise that someone injected it.  But 30 + 35 is still 65mg which should do the same effects as injecting it all at once.Or not.The thing is that some of the dmt is already broken down so it would just act as a top up.

DMT,32gsh0,Csativa,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:56:48 2015 UTC,"I'm currently reading Strassman's book so I can't speak with certainty (not all the way through it) but I believe it would probably be more powerful.  I'm not sure how long the tolerance period is but presumably you won't have reached a high level of tolerance from a single trip (he did 4x a day later in his trials for the purpose of examining tolerance). With that said, he talks about different levels of intensity of tripping for different people, so I bet you could probably breakthrough, then come down just slightly and get launched up again.  Keep in mind this is all my own understanding of how the drug works, as I've never tried what you're talking about and, to my knowledge, neither did Strassman. I don't think the guy saying a breakthrough can't get more intense is right though. I think it's definitely possible to have various levels of breakthroughs."
DMT,32gsh0,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:58:12 2015 UTC,"I have read his book as well, and if I remember correctly, his research points to a best dose (in mg/body weight). Anything above that was prescribed as 'too intense' by the participants. Also I believe puking and just nausea is more prevalent in the higher doses. I don't think it would add much good to the trip by injecting more."
DMT,32gsh0,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Apr 14 07:41:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it would add much good, but it would be more intense (as you yourself noted). Yes, I believe he says much about 0.6 mg/kg starts getting to be far too much, though many people opted out of the trial at much lower doses. Just like many other drugs, the relative effectiveness of DMT differs greatly person to person."
DMT,32gsh0,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:07:45 2015 UTC,"Not the same but similar, I vaped a sub-breakthrough dose and followed it with 75mg snorted. So far it was my most intense experience. Duration was about 15 minutes of breakthrough, 25 minutes equivalent of walking around my apartment on 700mics of lsd."
DMT,32hnzi,unclothing,5,Mon Apr 13 21:49:39 2015 UTC,"Great question! I hope I can give you some sort of insight into the experiences I've had with this substance.   I've encountered a number of different entities on my travels. The first time I blasted off, I did not make contact with any other being but rather was shown the infinite nature of the universe we inhabit. It was almost what you might imagine being sucked into a black hole might be like, except there was no end. Things just kept getting smaller and smaller until it wrapped back around on itself... sorry... words fail me at this point. The best way I can describe it is with this link. If you start at earth and then scroll left quickly, that is sort of what I experienced. Only when it gets to the smallest bit, the planck length, it cycled right back around to the very far right of the scroll bar and kept going left with the same breakneck speed.    But you asked specifically about entities so I will now get to those:  first entity: jackoff dick-sucking elves (credit to /u/samwoolfe1 for the artwork) This is one that I have seen a couple times. Its left hand is always jacking itself off and the right hand is jacking a dick off into its mouth. It sometimes morphs into a sort of cheshire cat face and then I'll often find my cat has climbed up upon my lap for some pets.  second entity: medusa throat slitter. She came to me while I was on my couch, laid back in the midst of a psychonautical journey. Like the gimp elves I'll mention a little bit later, she was coated in slick black leather and creeped across the ether with a nasty-looking blade destined for my throat. I knew she was coming for me but felt no fear because I knew the state I was in and knew that her ethereal efforts could do me no physical harm. I felt the blade slide across my neck and a wet-hot release as my consciousness slid back into my corporeal form.  third entity: blue prayer dude. This one came about after I went to see the movie Interstellar in theaters. I came home and rocketed myself out there and I saw it. It wasn't exactly like the image, more like a negative image... The figure was various pulsating shades of blue and the background was a similar black. It came after a period of red violence and bad vibes and I took it as the human race (and me specifically) having to atone for its (my) horrid, violent ways. Now I don't believe I've done anything so very horrid or violent, but I feel guilt for my fellow humans who do. I think we are all a part of the same consciousness and if that consciousness commits atrocities I cannot help but feel, in some small way, responsible.   third entities (2): black leather gimps gazing into my soul. These ones might seem creepy, but the vibe they put off was anything but. They slithered out of the cosmic ether and came to open a portal on my chest that let forth a bright light. The entities gazed intently upon this light, apparently judging my worth. As they looked inward I felt time warping around me and before I knew it they had seen all they needed to see and I was eased back into my normal plane of existence.    This is a pretty good depiction of how the entities seem to manifest themselves, IMO. It's almost as if they emerge organically/digitally from the cosmic field in which your own consciousness is placed.    Many people really enjoy the entities. I find myself more enthralled by the space I am thrust into. The landscape you speak of is absolutely breathtaking to behold. Granted, you have no breath in this space, and any description I give will be totally lost on you if you haven't experienced it firsthand. But the amazing level of detail and intricacy which is revealed on a trip with this molecule is absolutely eyeopening and perspective-shifting.   I open my eyes during the trip all the time. It is like an immediate shift in space. One moment you are in this amazingly constructed simulation of your immediate universe and then you move some muscles in your eyelids and your brain can take in all of this extra sensory information that immediately jettisons you into a different headspace. I enjoy blinking and rapidly shifting between these alternate realities. I find it especially comforting if there is some dark stuff happening in the non-sensory realm. When medusa was creeping toward me I was able to ground myself and keep calm by opening my eyes and seeing the wild real world morphing around my physical body.  I've touched on my first trip above, but the most surprising thing for me was the actual length of it. When I came back I asked my roommate how long I had been gone for. He had actually come home while I was out there and expressed to me that he was worried he'd have to tripsit me for the rest of the evening (4+ hours). I was back to baseline within 20 minutes.    This stuff is incredible and we need to spend tax dollars to research it substantially. There is a whole other world out there that we as a species have been on the verge of discovering and understanding for too long now."

DMT,32hnzi,dab_head,3,Tue Apr 14 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to think differently, but I think DMT is a perfect choice for a first psych, based on duration alone. It is an absolutely intense experience, but an amazingly short one. I've done mushrooms and acid a couple of times and have repeatedly found myself just waiting to come down. Either the trip just gets too uncomfortable or I'm anxious to start making the changes I've discovered I need to make or some combination of both. DMT is so fast-acting that you can become comfortable with that foreign space in small increments. If you have a careful technique, you can fine tune your dose until you are just where you need to be. It should also be said that if you lead a normal life outside of DMT, you will feel a bit of a junkie. While I'm not spending all of my money on this or all of my spare time blasting off, whenever I try to share my passion for DMT with people I know I do feel sort of like they think I'm that weirdo who just started watching Breaking Bad and put that chemistry degree to nefarious uses... Then I remember DMT ain't methamphetamine and I turn on some Old Crow and chill out."
DMT,32hbgc,Myrcene_box,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"First time doing this. I'm at the point where I've added vinegar (bottle says diluted to 5% acidity), 60ml vinegar in 200ml distilled water to 55g acrb. PH looks to be no less than 5.

I might try a more potent vinegar next time, i dunno.  Thanks.  edit: per the graduations on my vessel, looks like I added 50ml of vinegar. Really makes me think the vinegar is not acidic enough."

In general though, its considered to be a good idea to let your brain develop naturally before adding too many wild chemicals into the mix. Even weed can impede natural, healthy brain development.

DMT,32fhgm,ghost_sanctum,13,Mon Apr 13 11:09:10 2015 UTC,More or less. I used to think I knew what happened after death. DMT helped me come to the realization that I have no fucking clue one way or the other. Nobody ever really knows.
DMT,32fhgm,ScHooIboyJew,11,Mon Apr 13 11:39:53 2015 UTC,"Was 100% atheist, now I can't even take myself serious thinking that nothing else exist. It don't know what it is... but I feel it :)"
DMT,32fhgm,KVCE,9,Mon Apr 13 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily what happens after death, because that is unknowable. If anything, psychedelics have made me more comfortable with the idea that there is only the here and now. I am not waiting for the next moment or the next life, but embracing the present moment. Perhaps our spirits live on, perhaps not - I certainly believe there are 'old souls' among us, but whether that implies reincarnation... tough to say.  However, I think DMT / psychedelics in general have shown me a brief glimpse of what the process of dying might feel like, and allowed me to accept it as an inherent part of consciousness. And that has allowed me to live my life with less fear of the unknown."
DMT,32fhgm,accountofyawaworht,7,Mon Apr 13 12:48:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pushed me further into the camp of believing that consciousness totally continues after death. Also, check,out the research of Ian Stevenson, who did a twenty year (I believe) study set out to disprove reincarnation and ended up concluding the opposite."
DMT,32fhgm,hashmon,6,Mon Apr 13 14:38:32 2015 UTC,"I think the more important thing, is that it's changed the very concept of existance to the point where death is not what it seemed before. Once you realize the whole universe stems from one 'thing', however it exists, and that everything is just an array of perceptional layers of existence and outward manifestations death is no longer what it seems before. The question that we should be focusing on is where this physical reality comes from, and what is beyond it, and then you're closer to finding out what happens when we die."

DMT,32fhgm,theobserver420,3,Mon Apr 13 12:09:13 2015 UTC,Hahah that's what I'm talking about
DMT,32fhgm,Falkreath,3,Mon Apr 13 15:05:21 2015 UTC,"we can't know if the journey of conscious goes beyond the body because our journeys start and end in the body-  That said, the launch, the ""welcome home"" feeling - it seems so natural, the other side, and as soon as you experience it there is "" aha! of course, how could I forget that this other world exists"".  Leaving this body and in a moment all of this seemed like just a dream I can barely remember, and now can't remember at all but doesn't matter because the experience is still somehow going...  I feel DMT has given me experience of the reality and scaffold that we exist on before we put on this VR space ship body and navigate in this dimension.  And I do mean a VR body, just like the robot leg that delivered the kick at the world cup sent electrical signals to his brain so he could actually feeeel the feedback of touching the ball, so to do our bodies send electro chemical signals to our consciousness about actually ""being"" in this world... yet we are safe at home in our other dimension just experiencing this dream through electro chemical wormholes more or less.  All the experience we can gain with DMT is never going to actually show us what death is because it is something that we can only do starting and ending in the body (save it be through overdose if that is possible) and possibly there is not enough time in that trip for your conscious critical brain to totally forget trying to put together a world of information from what the body is trying to deliver   god knows it is really hard NOT to feel your breath on DMT so we have that constant signal or reminder of the body.  To fully fully leave it is probably not possible by this mechanism but more interesting is that we feel the breath at all-    in our day to day lives consciousness tries not to pay a lick of attention to breath we barely feel it - but in the journey it is so strongly correlated with everything.  The mindfulness we have to practice just to feel how refreshing breath is and not take it for granted....  what am I getting at is this...  When you are in the desert shitty water tastes delicious and that other side is so VOID of biology compared to this world that we CLING to that breath it seems to be the most valueable thing in that space...   So, if i were consciousness swimming in this radical space and an I feel an electrochemical signal that reminded me of breath like a bacteria feels when it senses food or heat I would move toward it.  Which would be my motivation for jumping through when I see the vessaca pices which becomes the flower of life which becomes the life and after gestation boom, breath! Feels good to be back... and we come back again and again and again."

DMT,32fhgm,Imgodnigga,6,Mon Apr 13 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"I believe hell was conceived by some sort of authority figure like parents or elders sometime a very very long time ago to keep the children in line and to stop them from doing stuff against the parents wishes. The amount of love I've experienced during my DMT trips and the amount of wisdom I've gained from other psychedelic trips has taught me better. Why would a ""God"" so full of love capable of so much love and grace towards us (his very own creation) create a hell? The idea of God living in us and us living in God also sorta goes with my conjecture. I'm happiest doing things that I enjoy some of which an ignorant person would call ""sinning"" why would God not want me happy? This is something that someone has to come to as a conclusion for them self and the longer you follow this path you are on the more evident it will become. Happy travels :)"
DMT,32fhgm,Myrcene_box,4,Mon Apr 13 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"Hell is a silly concept. I read this quote somewhere on reddit today:  ""God loves you so much, he created hell in case you don't love him back."""
DMT,32fhgm,doctor-girlfriend,2,Mon Apr 13 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"it's also silly because free will doesn't really exist. it appears to, it feels like we're making our own decisions, but we're all just a product of genetics x environment. some people are put into shitty environments that foster 'sinful' deeds, some are raised in happy loving families. obviously that has an effect on who we are as people and the decisions we make. and if it's more than that, if it's our 'soul' that makes some people be good and others be bad, then that's out of our control, as well. no one chooses to have an evil soul. so why would you put someone into eternal suffering for something they can't control?  it's like that passage in the bible where god 'hardened the pharoah's heart,' which ended up killing off his son or something (haven't brushed up on bible in a while) that's kind of a dick move innit"

Countless experience reports of NDEs and people who have actually died then come back seem to report the same types of things. Various entheogens showed me directly that consciousness extended far beyond this reality and confirmed firsthand that existence actually expands after death.

If all this can exist, why do you lean so strongly on the side of there being no intelligence behind it, and say it like it's self-evident? Think about how beautiful and complex the universe is, are you really betting against things being even more infinitely beautiful and complex than we can understand or imagine? Or do you think us humans have pretty much got it down?  I think some people can't separate the idea of God from the God they hear about in the Bible. They think they're too clever for all that, and want a pat on the back for being so rational. A rational person would accept their ignorance about all matters beyond death."

DMT,32frl1,albion70,3,Mon Apr 13 13:08:24 2015 UTC,"You don't need to vaporise changa like you do DMT freebase. I've always found a small bong work well as it allows you to take large hits reducing the need to scramble around taking another when your vision is impaired. Dose will be entirely dependant on the dmt to herb ratio, so if it's 1/1 or 50% dmt 100mg would be the equivalent of 50mg dmt, a large dose for a first time. Start with 20-30mg dmt if it's your first time. Regarding set and setting, well, I suppose it's less important than for LSD for example. Just get very comfortable, so that you're able to lie back, preferably in a room you're familiar with, light some incense and you're set. Ultimately it doesn't matter as you won't be in the room anyway, but it helps to put you in a good headspace before you go."
DMT,32frl1,dmtpsychonaut,2,Mon Apr 13 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"Dose depends on the ratio of DMT to herb. If the ratio is 1:1, you would need between 40-100mg for a breakthrough. It will work fine in the vaporizer. The boiling point of DMT is 160Â°C so somewhere around that temp is what you should set it at. Good luck!"
DMT,32frl1,RedSteppa,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:17:41 2015 UTC,"But the boiling point of harmine is way higher (421.4Â°C).  This means vaping basically doesn't make much sense.

It's just what I experienced--what was shown me, and what I understood.  During two of the four ceremonies, during the first few icaros, I was very aware of us all being taken back to a tree. As we reached the tree I knew I had been there before, that I had known this tree forever, that I had been returning there forever, over and over again. It's where we were taken to when we died. It's where we rested.  During the second ceremony that I reached this tree, I could see it much more clearly, and could clearly see what was happening to us when we reached it: our bodies were unzipped, and what was inside of us stepped out. This scared the hell out of me! My body hated it--it made me so scared, so nauseous, and I could feel the tension in the room around me in the other participants as well. It was frightening because I didn't want what was inside of me to leave! Come back! Please don't go! Please don't go.  But it did, it left. (At one point my shell was unzipped again, and something else was placed back inside of it, and I got to experience an entire different life millions of years ago, but that's another story.)  What stepped out of bodies was our spirit. I saw that we had done this over and over again, that we followed the evolution of the Earth, going into shell after shell after shell. What was amazing was that I learned to see people's spirits very clearly, and this is why I wanted to write to you.  Don't focus on the people you want to see being dead. Focus (using your inner eye, your mind's eye) on what you might believe to be inside of them: their spirit. Everyone I saw was so glowing, so happy, so radiant! Some (not all) even had white light behind them. But they all glowed with such love, such absolute unconditional love that I started crying.  Ayahuasca was very much intention based. You could ask for things. Try that with DMT. Offer yourself and it love, express your intentions, give gratitude, and see what happens!"

Instead of rolling, try stirring. I gave up on rolling/shaking my solutions after my first extraction. You won't get emulsions unless you're really stirring the hell out of it. Let it settle for a good 20-30 minutes and make sure your separation interface  (where the two layers meet) is nice and visible. The naphtha layer should be clear or slightly cloudy, never brown or yellow. We do acid/base separations at work in 1000 gallon tanks with a high speed mixer and they rarely emulsify. Rolling won't evenly distribute the naphtha, in my experience.   Good luck!"
DMT,32dz17,smokinjoe65,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:45:12 2015 UTC,Ty for the help. I will def try stirring with a spoon instead next time. What would you advise me to do with the batch sitting in the freezer. Should I wait another 24 hours ? I read I could remove the dishes and try to evap the nap instead ?
DMT,32dz17,smokinjoe65,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:54:18 2015 UTC,"I'd wait another day and, if there isn't anything there, reuse the naphtha. I recommend reclaiming your naphtha after freeze precipitating."

Pulling the nap from the precip dish makes me uncomfortable for some reason and I immediately becoming astonishingly clumsy, spilling Naptha and possible crystals all over the place.."
DMT,32dz17,smokinjoe65,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:25:41 2015 UTC,"I just do a quick pour off of the naphtha when I remove it from the freezer and tilt my dishes to dry (placing it so any run off will pool to the bottom and the majority of my crystals are at the top).

DMT,32dz17,brightstarblack,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:19:23 2015 UTC,I also rolled and put my Voss bottle flat on the counter and rolled it like a pin back and forth.  Really any motion which is chaotic but not enough to cause emulsions

DMT,32dz17,FiteMeIRLnerd,0,Mon Apr 13 12:16:38 2015 UTC,"1 - dont put it the crockpot, on heat, you have lye in it youll blow your place up even on low DO NOT USE A FLAME EVER.   2 - Use more naptha (if you can) many teks say use less, use say 100-120 ML, You will have more to evap but also will grab more gold.   3 - Roll MORE, roll it really good till your arms hurt at least 6 -10 times. It is a very important step do not rush or get lazy   4 -Save all your pulls and, place them into a glass cup seal it and put it in the freezer, then combine them all into your evap dish,   With acrb you can freeze for a few hours then air dry over a fan, if you blow over your pulls and it turns cloudy you have succeded.   You can take the dish out now and air dry with a fan blowing over it, it will take hours, when there is almost next to nothing left of naptha drain it back into your mixture, turn the dish upside down onto some paper towels letting the remaining naptha drain out, then set the dish upright and let it dry with a fan.  ACRB will produce goo, however if you have the patience allowing it dry for weeks in a cabinet with the lid slightly off allowing air, say 3-4 weeks it will produce powder and no goo.   Your technique seems rushed. Do not rush.  Simple Tec:  No acid solution, no crockpot, nothing to it.  1 gram of root bark for for each gram lye you can use a little more lye if you want it wont hurt , add lye to a good amount of water, small amounts at a time be careful it gets hot.  then when its not so hot add in your bark.  let it sit for a few hours,and break down say 3-4 hours the longer the better tho.   roll, roll roll roll roll roll, For heat fill up your sink with hot water and place mixture in to settle with the lid off. Replacing hot water after every seperation. Open the lid of your container every minute or so to allow air to escape.  Roll roll roll roll roll settle, seperate again a bunch more.   If an emulsion seems to be appearing, you can add a little more water, and tap the sides of your containter, it will eventually seperate just will take longer.   Combine your pulls and place then in your evap dish or a cup until you have at least 3 pulls, making sure not to get any of the brown sludge into your pulls. place pulls into glass cup for about 20 minutes allowing any sediment to settle at the bottom, then carefully pour into evap dish leaving any brown behind.  Freeze covered for a few hours, take it out and air dry, dont pour out the naptha just let it all air dry it may seem like nothing but as it evaps youll see your hard work pay off.    acrb turns to powder w/ no goo if allowed to dry for weeks.   Its very simple process. not too much to it except a day of work and waiting. also 57g wont produce a whole lot, maybe close to or 1 gram, but youre trying way to hard. and rushing it seems."
DMT,32dz17,FiteMeIRLnerd,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:06:10 2015 UTC,"yes rotate, in a circular motion for at least 10-15 minutes then allow it to seperate. a bunch of times 4 isnt enough like OP."

DMT,32cnie,fordtp7,6,Sun Apr 12 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"Effects-wise or physically?  Physically, DMT is the main psychoactive alkaloid in Ayahuasca, and appears as a white-yellow powder, sometimes more gooey, depending on how it was made. Pure DMT can be vaporized (takes a lot of technique most of the time), snorted, on injected (not recommended at all, and requires some chemical manipulation to be safe, but is the main method of administration in clinical settings). The effects of pure DMT taken in these ways lasts from under 10 minutes to an hour, depending or dosage, method, and method of administration. It sets on very quickly and goes away just as fast (a matter of seconds).  Ayahuasca is a brew that you drink made directly from the plant material, namely the Ayahuasca vine (B. Caapi) and the root bark of the Mimosa Hostilis plant. Since DMT is broken down in the stomach by a certain enzyme (known as Monoamine Oxidase, or MAO), it needs to be taken with an MAO-Inhibitor, which stops the enzyme from acting, and from breaking down the DMT in your stomach. The DMT comes from the Mimosa plant, and the MAO-Inhibitor comes from the Ayahuasca vine. It typically induces nausea and vomiting, and when brewed improperly, it can be very unpleasant. Ayahuasca lasts several hours, and is usually described as being more ""down to earth"" and ""grounded"" than a pure DMT trip. Other versions of this include analogs of ayahuasca (sometimes called ""pharmahuasca"" or ""anahuasca"") that use other types of plants like syrian rue seeds, acacia confusa bark, or pure DMT powder swallowed with a pharmaceutical MAOI."
DMT,32cnie,N_N_DMT,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"this was a very helpful answer. so just to be clear the DMT is the main thing that affects your brain in both cases, its just different ways of taking it? also i have a haze vaporizer you think i could sandwich DMT between weed and vape? otherwise could i sandwich the DMT between weed in a bong bowl and hit it like that?"
DMT,32cnie,RedSteppa,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:22:08 2015 UTC,Basically yes. But you may want to consider taking another herb which isn't active on it's own as weed may dimish the experience. Mint would be my choice also because of it's taste.
DMT,32cnie,N_N_DMT,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:59:36 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend using weed. Weed burns at a high temperature, and can destroy the DMT. I recommend snorting it, myself. If you want to vaporize it, you can either sandwich it between two (thin) layers of herbal tea, and use the heat from the burning tea to vaporize the DMT. If your vaporizer works such that your product sits inside a solid metal holder (so no powder slips out), you can set that to around 375F and just use the DMT pure. Pure DMT vapor is harsh though, and I have a very hard time holding it down. Keep in mind you have about 20 seconds of time before you're gone."

DMT,32cnie,N_N_DMT,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:19:37 2015 UTC,No. You only need an MAO when taken orally because that is what's needed by the stomach.

DMT,3258tf,redxx7,5,Fri Apr 10 19:07:41 2015 UTC,Lye (sodium hydroxide) is a strong base and iirc helps separate the DMT from the plant matter in ACRB during the extraction process.

DMT,3258tf,BestUndecided,2,Fri Apr 10 21:13:03 2015 UTC,I buy my acrb powder from amazon. The raw materials aren't illegal in any capacity.
DMT,3258tf,smokinjoe65,2,Fri Apr 10 21:59:36 2015 UTC,yea but that doesn't stop some packages to be confiscated by customs like my last couple of orders. I just wanted to make sure amazon was still able to get their packages to your door. I'll probably place an order tonight. Thank you!
DMT,3258tf,BestUndecided,2,Fri Apr 10 22:23:49 2015 UTC,I feel lucky that I haven't been affected by any customs or DEA antics. The government is treading thin ice when they start to confiscate legal goods.
DMT,3258tf,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:28:30 2015 UTC,It's only fun for them to confiscate stuff that people have heard of before. Otherwise they get no street cred or political brownie points.
DMT,3258tf,truwhtthug,2,Sat Apr 11 00:17:56 2015 UTC,The sellers on amazon and eBay tend to be based in the states (mine came from HI) so they don't have to pass through customs. The times I've heard of orders not arriving seem to happen when the bark is shipped from another country.

DMT,321z4k,Imgodnigga,5,Fri Apr 10 00:33:39 2015 UTC,Two things:  Atheism is not a belief but a lack thereof.  Spirituality isn't dependent on atheism. Spirituality is a beautiful part of the human conscience and it can be felt from anything. Whenever I think about ancient human civilizations or how we are all just expressions of the universe I feel profoundly spiritual. Moreso than I ever did with religion. Having an intense trip is not a doorway to another realm (as far as we know). Believing in nonsensical things because they feel right is how all religions or schools of thought act. They can't all be right even though they are all positive they are.  Honestly the more I do DMT the more it solidifies that ideology.
DMT,321z4k,shmerk-a-berl,2,Fri Apr 10 22:23:59 2015 UTC,"we are all just expressions of the universe   Have you read about pantheism? Pantheism is the belief that the universe (or nature as the totality of everything) is identical with divinity, or that everything composes an all-encompassing, immanent God. Pantheists thus do not believe in a distinct personal or anthropomorphic god.  This idea really hits home for me. I once read a quote that expressed this in another way:    Given enough time, Hydrogen starts to wonder where it came from   This sort of thing is just so cool to me... to US... to EVERYTHING"
DMT,321z4k,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:53:09 2015 UTC,"I thought that whole ideology up before I had ever heard about it but I just don't see it as a god. My interpretation of god is probably just skewed though. It's possible that there is one consciousness and we are all a part of it but I have no proof. That is how I like to think about it though because of how much sense it makes but that still doesn't mean we are even close to the right answer.  That's the only kind of theism I could ever ""subscribe"" to anyway. Very zen way of looking at life."

Also interesting is that some say that the demiurge is the actual ""god"" in the garden of eden who says Adam where are you? as if a god had to ask...  And gnostic scriptures say that sophia descended to this reality and secretly placed in all living things a way to access the real truth (DMT?).

DMT,321z4k,RoachPowder,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:07:21 2015 UTC,"It's desire.  Desire to express, desire to endulge.  The only thing we do is create social bonds and please our senses.  Our purpose is literally to express desire.  We were created from a God that has so much unconditional love and creativity that he gives us free will, the choice to endulge in him or not.  That's why many ancient cultures advice you not to feed your temptations,  because it won't get you on the road of God.  You're feeding your ego not your soul.  We have it in us to desire God and give God our unconditional love back and he will always accept.  Dmt, and many psychedelics help clear the fog of Maya, allowing us to see the world through the lense of clarity.  You must find that love for God through devotion and practice(mediation and prayer)your actions will prove your desire to the lord .   DMT will put you on the path but DMT Isn't  the path itself.  Expressing any desires are not 'sinning' and defying the lord for he has blessed us with it, but sensation of the flesh is not infinitely satisfying for it will cease to exist in a second.  Your soul will keep circulating until you've expressed all your desires of the flesh, and realize your only true desire, to satisfy your spirit :)  (just my opinion after tons of interesting research and psychedelic drugs thanks for reading)"

It's still not proof. No matter what I see I know it's my brain creating it so no amount of Gods or universe making beings in my dreams are gonna convince me of anything I can't test.
DMT,321z4k,NSAWatchesMe,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:09:10 2015 UTC,The first time I smoked Dimitri these golden hieroglyphics appeared on everything. I was an atheist at the time but I knew I'm I was in the presence of something devine. I wasn't ready for it at the time though so I stopped my self from experiencing it and ran to the shower as soon as I could move my body. After that I took psychedelics a lot more seriously and looked to them for more of a spiritual purpose.

I have yet to go that far.  it is rather interesting how people tend to see these entities doing certain dances.If I get a good dose of DMT,i go into this heavy trance and I perform these hand mudras,some of you might remember me posting about it here.I never done any of that or knew about mudras...but for some reason I go in some kinda autopilot mode and do these hand things.I tried so much to understand what i was doing,I just had to stop attempting to rationalize it.All i know is that it feels good when i perform them."

DMT,321z4k,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:47:23 2015 UTC,Yeah this is so irrational. What if the experience had been a dream and not a trip. Would it carry the same weight? It sucks that DMT can bring out the completely irrational in people. OP please reconsider.
DMT,321z4k,waxhive,2,Fri Apr 10 13:27:27 2015 UTC,"I think I understand where you are coming from but please try to realize that what may seem irrational to one person may be far more rational to another, given their world-perspective. We all come from different walks of life. Just because your experiences have led you to believe a certain way does not mean that another person's beliefs are irrational. We must all strive to understand our neighbors' points of view if we are to overcome the challenges of the current climate. Nobody likes when their view is considered ""completely irrational."" Sometimes the judgement may be justified; but let's hold off for a moment, give the benefit of the doubt, and see if we can't all come to better understand our fellow man before causing undue strife. Most especially over the internet :)"
DMT,321z4k,dmtpsychonaut,-2,Sat Apr 11 02:05:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but this is just irrational behavior. There is not two sides to every story. I'm certainly not denying that his experience was real, but the conclusions he's drawn from it are irrational and irrational beliefs lead to irrational behavior which is detrimental to society. It shocks me that so many people in this sub believe in their own version of the supernatural. Do they not realize that DMT acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain and that just as spikes in dopamine alter the conscious experience, DMT can change the way you perceive the world. This type of rhetoric should be shunned and ridiculed."

DMT,323qe6,dabalabadooooo,1 point,Fri Apr 10 10:52:33 2015 UTC,It is very welcoming after you get through the initial shock of each trip. For me it's frightening until I smile and laugh at how the entities are entertaining me :) At that point it feels like the trip is ending and I'm just flabbergasted.   It's extremely potent if you're doing it right. Those doing 50mg+ for a breakthrough aren't using an efficient route of delivery. I get crazy breakthroughs with 15-20mg using my gvg.
DMT,323qe6,smokinjoe65,2,Fri Apr 10 12:27:00 2015 UTC,Agreed. I can pack a bowl with ~200mg of e-leaf (1:1 ratio) and get 4 breakthroughs easily.

I miss the duration of snorted DMT compared to vaping for sure. However, the rocketship effect of vaped DMT is VERY fun and intense :D  I am, however, taking my time between DMT sessions to integrate the experiences I have with everyday life.

Also in the end nobody really knows for sure what you're seeing, is it your mind playing tricks and showing you it's power or are you being exposed to something so incredibly amazing and mind blowingly huge and complex that its impossible to fully grasp because of its wonder...but that's for you to decide every persons spiritual journey has a different end and different beliefs find what YOU believe you experience :)"

Are you just slowly mixing the solvent so it doesn't separate from itself? What is the reasoning behind this? Also, what are your salt, acid, base, and bark amounts in this particular tek? I wonder how much yours deviates from cyb's?  Now that I have a confirmed high quality ACRB sample, I'm going to try your method this weekend. I'm coming off of 3 failed extractions now so If you ever made a tek or more detailed procedure I would totally gild you in a heartbeat!"
DMT,31rki9,not_usual_throwaway,12,Tue Apr 7 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"I would recommend it as a first psychedelic. I know a lot of other people would not, based on the fact that it can be a lot more intense than shrooms or acid. I believe the extremely short duration makes it ideal for testing the waters though.  I would recommend either taking some time to make your DMT into e-leaf or changa OR very carefully vaporizing it on top of a bed of ash. I posted in the beginners sticky thread about proper technique for this method. Good luck!"
DMT,31rki9,dmtpsychonaut,4,Tue Apr 7 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, I find it perfect because of the intensity and duration."

I don't want to be tripping for multiple hours (yet :D).  I read your comment on the sticky. Do you think vaporising on a bed of ash would work with a gravity bong (I would probably use a water bottle waterfall/bucket bong)? I don't own a glass bong and I imagine that if I used a pipe, I'd suck in all the ash, and my lungs don't really feel like doing that haha :D  In your comment you said that you need 'precise maneuvering of your bic'. Could you please elaborate on that, like how far to hold it etc.?  Also, what if I made a simple vaporiser, like from a lightbulb...would it work with DMT?    Edit: This is the post I was thinking about following regarding gravity bongs."
DMT,31rki9,dmtpsychonaut,2,Tue Apr 7 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"I've heard lightbulbs and waterfall bongs are not the greatest for DMT. I would use your bowl, honestly. Pack a bowl of weed as tightly as you can and smoke that through to get your bed of ash. The tighter it is packed, the less likely you will be to pull it through. Note that you might not want to smoke weed right before DMT. As far as maneuvering the bic, you just want to make sure you don't burn the spice. Maybe an inch away from the bowl is a good distance. Pull gingerly, you don't want the flame to be pulled into contact with your DMT or it will burn. Maybe practice the technique with some keef first."
DMT,31rki9,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely consider the ash approach. Also, after doing a bit more research just now, I found that people use all types of herbs instead of ash to 'sandwich' the DMT. Some people used oregano, parsley, mint, or even green/mint tea. What do you think about using one of these instead of ash?"
DMT,31rki9,SearchingForAnAnswer,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"Go for it! DMT Enhanced Leaf is the easiest way to blast off, IMO. Downside being it takes a few days to prepare because you have to wait for ISO alcohol to evaporate."

DMT,31rki9,deemstered,4,Wed Apr 8 08:28:21 2015 UTC,Honestly I started with acid and shrooms and waited until I thought I was ready but I still wasnt. I would say go for it because unlike other psychedelics it is almost impossible to have a bad experience on a DMT breakthrough.
DMT,31rki9,jimgrogansugly,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"I thought I was ready but I still wasnt   From what I've read so far, that's usually what people feel like. Personally, I don't think there's a way to be 'ready' for an experience like this, especially if you go through ego death. It's good to know that there aren't many bad experiences, although I think it also depends on your mental state at the time -- if you think that you'll have a bad trip or if you're afraid, you will probably have a bad trip.

Also just keep rippin until you are ripped out of this dimmension, you do build up a tolerance fast and waiting between hits makes it harder to breakthrough.

Granted, you have to be careful of your diet and drug intake when dealing with an MAOI. Extracting DMT crystals from ACRB is easy if you can follow directions and have full use of a kitchen."
DMT,31ru64,brightstarblack,2,Tue Apr 7 17:53:48 2015 UTC,"Pouring off the solvent carefully will leave the crystals piled up in the corner. You can filter the rest (DMT crystals can possibly get caught in a coffee filter which is why I recommend pouring off carefully before dumping it all in a filter). I use wide pyrex dishes to keep the solvent layer thin so the crystals have very little to travel through before settling on the bottom. Freeze precipitating in a jar where the depth of solvent is excessive will leave crystals suspended with little chance of settling to the bottom.   Also, solvent is reusable. I do my re-x with fresh solvent, however."
DMT,31ru64,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"Wow. Perfect answer, thanks.  I figured I could reuse and even if I am careful and still manage to pour off some crystals, I can just put that ""dirty"" solvent back into my separation bottle (I use a Voss bottle).  Thanks so much! I'll keep being patient and wait another 8 hours or so to pour off the best one (total will be 24 hrs in freezer)"

DMT,31ru64,dmtpsychonaut,2,Wed Apr 8 00:14:09 2015 UTC,"In the tek I first used, it recommended reusing solvent as it is already partially saturated even after precipitation. If you think about it: the solvent absorbs more alkaloids when it is heated and then when you put the heavily saturated warm solvent in the freezer to precipitate, he DMT falls out of solution. But DMT will dissolve in the solvent even at a low temperature, just not as heavily as it does when warmer. So the freezer precipitated solvent still has some product trapped in it. This means when you do another pull with this used solvent, it becomes saturated more quickly and efficiently than if you were to play with fresh, never-saturated solvent.   For this same reason, I will always evaporate old solvent and then re-x whatever is leftover. With positive results :)"

And dont get me started with all these materialistic possessions of cars and houses and such. But it would help with the dodgy dealers. me and my friends always used to try buy acid from nigerians, and they were always duds. so we always tried to take more and more. and then one day he got a proper batch of LSD , and we had 3 tabs each. It was laced definitely and we had a hectic experience. The begginning hours were frightening and then later the laughing didnt stop for like 8 hours, and my friend thought he was going to have a heart attack.

Ive heard of Psychedelics curing depression which is remarkable."
DMT,31o8qr,gratuitous_algorithm,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"It could do either. But I'd say your interest in DMT is a sign that it would likely be beneficial rather than detrimental. Ask yourself why you want to try DMT, what your hoping to accomplish, etc. Mediate on these thoughts and make absolutely sure that you want to do this for the right reasons. If you're looking for answers, you may be disappointed. I've found myself with many more questions after a trip. With that said, a post-psychedelic experience can be uplifting, refreshing and give you a new way of looking at things. LSD is said to possibly cure depression, I wouldn't be surprised if DMT had similar effects.  And on a side note, meditation can be incredibly helpful with depression.  I hope with whatever you do, you find what your looking for!"

DMT is a place where you go and things are shown to you very rapidly. its not exactly a place where you subconcious is brought to light and memories and experiences are shown. so going in should be really fine, unless youre on medication, then im not sure. but truthfully, id say go for it. The depression wont play a major role in your trip. you go into the DMT realm as the same person, with the same baggage, with the same thoughts (other than HOLY FUCK THIS IS AMAZING), and things are just being shown to you. i reccomend you go for that dmt, its realy amazing."

DMT,31olae,rennat19,3,Mon Apr 6 22:51:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe try making changa, and then using pax to vaporize the enhanced herb."
DMT,31olae,OGNexus,2,Tue Apr 7 00:40:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah best bet with the pax or any dry flower small vape is to make some changa and vape the plant material, but with changa you can just smoke a joint and it's wildly more effective than just putting it on the herbs(s).  I would recommend using a Hash oil vaporizer over the machine. The machine is a pain in the ass to make, because the glass can break pretty easily depending on the bottle and even if it doesn't break you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO RUN WATER OVER THE HOLE YOU ARE DRILLING. Without running water, glass dust accumulates. If you breathe in even a SMALL amount of this glass particulate you can wind up with some serious lung damage. Not fun at all. Be extra careful when making the machine to have water running against the hole while you drill it if that's what you plan to use. Also make sure to clean the shiny stuff off any steel or copper wool you use at the neck of the bottle. Every manufacturer of steel and copper wool coats it in a shiny filament that is just chemical crap. When you apply heat to vape that DMT, you also vape that chemical crap. Look up how to clean the shiny stuff off on google, I remember reading about it ages ago in a tech for the machine back when I first started having access to the molecule, and the person was very specific to note these things, because otherwise people can put themselves at risk using this method.   Additionally, the machine is -not- always a 1 hit blast off or breakthrough, typically. It all comes down to how well you know how to hit it, meaning the learning curve of the ROA (route of administration), and how acrid and hot the smoke is due to how you smoked it (did you get impatient and apply the flame directly to the copper wool? that's bad, but sadly is the best way to get a solid hit with the machine).  I say all of this from personal experience. Besides my first few experiences where I used a Pookie (a pipe specifically meant for smoking crystalline drugs, typically used for meth) I started with a machine back in 2008. It used to be that the machine was one of the best methods simply because it was the most readily available and CHEAP method. Can't afford a good vaporizer but don't want to smoke out of a light bulb or meth pipe and don't want to smoke it off weed? Make a machine. Fortunately, with the advance of vaping technology in the form vapes for herb and wax, as well as e-cigs and the combination of both, you can get a really good DMT vaporizer for relatively cheap.  My suggestion is a Yo-zap or Yo-can with an e-cig battery. Most head shops carry them, they are typically used for hash oils and cannabis extracts, so they are meant to hold things that liquify. You don't need copper wool, don't need a drill, and will be worth the 40-50 you spend so you don't have to deal with making a crack pipe from scratch.  also, the pax would still work, the only thing is that if you don't have something for the DMT to ""catch"" on when it liquefies it will drip into all the places you won't be able to get it out of or smoke it from. However, I have had a lot of success with bag style vaporizers like the volcano, and you actually CAN blast DMT with high heat as long as no flame is involved. With a volcano, we set it to 8 or so on the temp scale (that's high) and it just flash vapes all the DMT into the bag really quickly, without ruining any of it because it only uses hot air to vaporize the materials.  TL;DR: Don't bother with a machine, there are way better methods in 2015 than the homemade crack pipes people were making back in 2000."

DMT,31olae,PineAppleTreeHugger,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:50:38 2015 UTC,What do you mean when you say:   Yo-zap or Yo-can with an e-cig battery   Do you need a different battery than what comes with a Yo-zap?
DMT,31olae,uncooluserid,3,Tue Apr 7 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"https://www.fasttech.com/product/1670802-yo-zap-e-solid-wax-pyrex-glass-vaporizer  Here is the Yo-zap. In the first picture on the far right you will the coil laying on it's side, and next to it is the lid that can be screwed on over the coil, this helps because it allows for further containment and faster vaping. In the other pictures you can see what it looks like fully assembled. This is what you purchase with the yo-zap, it does not come with a battery though.  Don't worry about that though, batteries aren't too expensive and as you can see in the second picture this vape attachment screws on to any eGo style battery, like this one http://www.madvapes.com/gun-metal-ego-battery-900-mah.html  The yozap is built to attach to batteries like these, like many BHO attachments, but does not come with it's own. Still winds up costing 30-40 online for a really quality space ship."
DMT,31olae,PineAppleTreeHugger,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:24:46 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm going to try this. So the DMT goes right in with the coil and then the lid goes on top of that?   How many hits do you need to break through?
DMT,31olae,uncooluserid,2,Tue Apr 7 20:53:13 2015 UTC,"yes you put the spice directly into the coil chamber and screw the lid on. After that just put it onto the battery, and push the button and breathe.   As far as how many hits it typically takes, this is largely dependent upon how much spice you loaded into the chamber (50 mg? 75? 90???) and what the voltage of the battery is set to. Higher voltage will cause the coil to heat faster and hotter, thus creating a bigger hit as it will vape more of the molecule, however, too much heat will make the smoke hotter and a bit harsher, so finding the sweet spot between too much and not enough is important. I would recommend having your voltage be around 4-4.5, although lower still absolutely works and it cools the hit off more, it just takes more hits.  Typically I would say you will forget about the pen or the need to use it within 3-5 hits tops, less if you put a lot into the chamber. The great thing about this though is that because there is no awkward lighter or breathing system or learning curve, it's really really easy to continue to take extra hits past the point that you can't see properly, simply put it to your face and breathe while holding the button until you can't any longer."
DMT,31olae,PineAppleTreeHugger,2,Wed Apr 8 01:40:50 2015 UTC,Really appreciate your advice here. I've ordered it! :)
DMT,31olae,PineAppleTreeHugger,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:53:20 2015 UTC,One more question... How much do you put in the chamber for a breakthrough?
DMT,31olae,uncooluserid,2,Wed Apr 8 22:33:13 2015 UTC,"again, all depends on what a regular dose would be if you aren't really wasting any. According to erowid, DMT is active at 30 mg, at threshold levels, and a really heavy dose would be 90-100 mg. Because you aren't burning any or losing any of your spice with this method (unlike a weed pipe, bong, meth pipe, machine, or joint) these numbers are actually correct and you can (and should) be more frugal/sparing with the amount of molecule you use. I would suggest getting a digital scale that can read to the 0.01, they are cheap at any headshop and invaluable for measuring out how many milligrams you are about to use (you will be able to measure to mg in 10's, any more precise and you'll need a jewelers scale).  In my experience with any method that is actually cost effective and doesn't overuse your spice, 60-70 mg is way more than enough, and 50 is often a perfect sweet spot to start with."
DMT,31olae,PineAppleTreeHugger,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:06:45 2015 UTC,"Perfect. I'll start off at 50mg. I already have a scale I use for nootropics so I'm all set. Just waiting on the delivery. Not going to lie, I'm pretty damn nervous, but this is something I have to experience. Again, I appreciate your time and advice. Take care!"
DMT,31olae,uncooluserid,2,Thu Apr 9 02:29:58 2015 UTC,"It's normal to be a bit (or a lot) nervous, don't sweat it. I still get a bit nervous right before practically every time I smoke it, and I have been in contact with it since 2008, and consider it a friend. I compare it to your body creating a cortisol reaction right before that first drop of a rollercoaster. Your body does this though in anticipation of the drop, and the subsequent (and amazing) adrenaline and seratonin rush. I think it's similar here. It's like getting on a brand new, completely unknown rollercoaster every time you smoke it and it really works."
DMT,31olae,cenalan,1 point,Thu Apr 9 10:30:47 2015 UTC,"My first time with DMT I used a Pax, putting the DMT on some weed.

Any tek is as good as the next as long as it contains the necessary steps for different types of root bark. It's all about doing things right without cutting corners.  Also, what do you mean by separating the nmt from dmt? I've never seen this mentioned before."

I've made mimosa completely clear before. And like you I think alkaloids get tossed with the sediment. However I think this might remove the binding from the alkaloids and rebind with the egg. Because I made this clear liquid that tasted almost like water. I simmered Syrian rue for 20 minutes then drank it. Then I waited 20 minutes and drank a cup of my clear water tasting mimosa.

I had this pipedream about laying out 200mg sheets (2mg per tab, 20mg a strip) of 4-AcO-DMT, only dividing strips, and selling the strips as single doses. Too afraid any solvent other than like chloroform would degrade it. A proper sheet of fat paper can hold half a gram of drug material, so there could be ten hits on your boy's sheet, but being orally inactive, unless he's selling them as enemas or nigga's got a MAOIs he can fit on there too that he needs to tell me about, it's bullshit. It's totally possible due to communication breakdown that your boy with the tabs has ""DMT analogue"" and there might be a pretty cool trip waiting for you (but it would be nothing like DMT). But chances are he's hustleing 25i and you should call him out with well researched information on the toxicity and dangers of selling 25i as any thing other than 25i to people who have researched the chemical in front of his friends so you can school them for hangin with such a shady nigga. Or he has developed revolutionary advances in drug design by creating an MAOIs that is potent enough to be laid on tab and he's mass producing pieces of paper that can reveal the inner structures of the cosmos.

DMT,31gdfj,purplepirhana,3,Sat Apr 4 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"my best advice: DO NOT MELT OR BURN THE DMT. You're trying to vaporize it. If youre holding the flame too close, it will start to kind of melt and bubble - TAKE THE FLAME AWAY before it does that, this means the DMT molecule itself if being destroyed because it becomes ruined when it passes a certain degree of temperature. So hold the flame as far away as you can get away with while still vaporizing the spice into a 'smoke' and with 3 large lung fills you will completely blast through. But, the catch - hold in the hits as long as you can, and make them all immediately consecutive to one another, until you physically are not able to hold the piece or the lighter because by this point you should have no idea as to what anything is or why or where."

DMT,31dbck,BritishAristocracy,5,Sat Apr 4 00:04:55 2015 UTC,"The only positive experience I've ever heard about using the 2L bottle method was that video you mentioned. It seems to be widely considered to be an awful MOA.  I think you have extracted DMT but you are burning it. I will share with you the way I first broke through. It was simple and effective and as you already smoke pot, it really doesn't require any preparation.  I first bought DMT from an acquaintance who got it from his ""chemist,"" for whatever that's worth. I was told to put it on top of weed or a bed of ash and to not let the flame touch the spice. If you've ever tried to carefully light a bowl topped with keef, you should be familiar with the lighting technique: slowly pulling on the mouthpiece while watching how the keef reacts; not allowing it to ignite, but to smolder. This is exactly how you vaporize DMT.  I took my purchased crystals home and sat on them for a few weeks while I did more research and waited for the opportune moment. When that moment arrived I emptied my bubbler of water, making sure to preserve the ashen plug leftover from the fully packed bowl that had been smoked sometime earlier. It was upon this bed of ash that I was able to experience something that I can never adequately explain to anyone who hasn't bought the same ticket and taken the same ride.   I carefully watched the spice melt and start to bubble without allowing it to ignite at all. The key is precise maneuvering of your bic. You can feel the vapor and it is far less harsh than what you experienced. It does taste a bit like plastic but it should not be unbearable. I held the first hit for a time and then went for a second before the thing hit me. As I held that second hit, I realized I should turn off the kitchen light and did so. As I walked back to the couch I felt myself taking off and was just able to land my mortal coil safely on its comfortable, safe environ before the universe opened up to me.  Almost a year later, I learned to extract and the product derived produces similar effects. Mine is from ACRB but the fact that you are using Mimosa should mean your result should be purer, from what I've read. Work on your technique if you are truly wanting to experience this. Safe travels :)"

DMT,31ca1x,SLURREY,2,Fri Apr 3 23:10:31 2015 UTC,I for one am looking forward to hearing how it went for you. My first experience brought me out of a period of depression and I hope you find what you are looking for!
DMT,31ca1x,shmerk-a-berl,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:10:28 2015 UTC,I posted a trip report :) No break through but I'm feeling a little better. Thanks again!
DMT,31ca1x,Axle132,5,Sat Apr 4 16:33:14 2015 UTC,set and setting.   <  Golden rule of psychoactives!!!
DMT,31ca1x,Imgodnigga,5,Sat Apr 4 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"I think it all depends on  the situations you're currently facing that are causing your depression.   Maybe this will help, I know it surely helped me.  I found that when I'm in a funk, I'll cut it short with very small DMT smoke sessions. I don't smoke enough to have a full blown breakthrough psychedelic experience... but just enough to feel that familiar warm blanket wash over me & return to that blissful head space.   I just let myself think about all the people I love and how much they love me... I think about achievements I've made or things I'm proud of. I think about how long I've stayed in this body and all the things I've experienced in my life journey. It's such a sweet bonding experience with youself. Made me realize that as long as I love myself that's all that really matters in life.  Bad things happen to good people,  but if there's nothing we can do to take action & fix it, there's no use in dwelling on negative things.  We have to acknowledge negative things but we can't let it guide us through life.   Much love to you! I hope you find your way out of depression & have a safe trip."
DMT,31ca1x,Imgodnigga,3,Sat Apr 4 05:05:44 2015 UTC,"My first time with that experience was during a time when I was depressed due to traumatic events which occurred withing weeks of each other. The experience itself was intense and beautiful, but it snapped me out of it and I went on to finish my schooling, jump start my career and completely turn my life around.  If it's a long term depression, look into attending an ayahuasca ceremony. The length and intensity may make it a difficult trip, but it is incredibly healing in ways that modern medicine and therapists should be paying attention to."
DMT,31ca1x,dmtpsychonaut,2,Sat Apr 4 01:59:10 2015 UTC,"If you are in a comfortable environment and alone I can't see why not. DMT has only helped me when I'm depressed. Just go into it knowing what you want to change. Really sit there and meditate for 5 minutes at least after you mull over what you want to change. Breathe deeply with your diaphragm, it really helps."
DMT,31ca1x,dmtpsychonaut,2,Sat Apr 4 00:21:36 2015 UTC,Perhaps have a low threshold non-breakthrough dmt dose if you're state of mind is unbalanced. I find its one of the best things for rebuilding a positive energy without throwing you too much of a curveball. A 15 minute micro-dose thatll still give you a euphoric afterglow :)
DMT,31ca1x,Stinkfished,2,Sat Apr 4 03:26:47 2015 UTC,I would't. For me it's to intense when depressed. The experience itself would be bad I think but afterwards it might help as a treatment for depression...?
DMT,31ca1x,dmtpsychonaut,2,Fri Apr 3 23:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I'm thinking too. At least if it is bad, it won't last for very long."
DMT,31ca1x,Stinkfished,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:11:26 2015 UTC,"Just to expand a little more on what I said I guess: I did dmt when I was depressed/wasn't mentally prepared for it and had my balls chopped off by an alien while 4 watched. It was horrifying. But, through the course of my day/night and thinking about that part of my experience and later parts of it I was able to work through my trip/depression. Its a great healing molecule and has been used like that to since since only god knows how long ago. If you think you can handle the intensity of it and am in an alright place go for it! :)"
DMT,31ca1x,dmtpsychonaut,2,Fri Apr 3 23:35:59 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. My first time breaking through I had this feeling as I was coming out of it that my balls should be removed. I remember grabbing them and the mental image of them being cut off popped into my head. I have held the opinion for a while now that procreation is selfish and reckless in this day and age, so I have always attributed that aspect of the trip to my personal beliefs."
DMT,31ca1x,Stinkfished,4,Sat Apr 4 02:57:48 2015 UTC,"Not sure what the joke is. Perhaps I should explain better. Usually I just feel bummed. For the last few days, I've felt more bummed than typical."
DMT,31ca1x,shmerk-a-berl,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"As someone who thinks they understand something of what you're going through, I encourage you to stay strong. Depression sucks and I don't know any better than anyone else what the best way is to get through it. I try to smile and laugh as much as possible and to really think about the way I treat others and at the end of the day, no matter how depressed I feel, I know that I am a good person and am trying my best."
DMT,31ca1x,Stinkfished,-9,Fri Apr 3 23:14:55 2015 UTC,Depression generally isn't something that just lasts for a few days you idiot.
DMT,31ca1x,dmtpsychonaut,4,Sat Apr 4 03:06:20 2015 UTC,Yes I am aware of that. I was diagnosed with severe depression 15 years ago. Just going through an especially rough patch at this time. Thanks again to everyone who offered good advice
DMT,31ca1x,shmerk-a-berl,2,Sat Apr 4 01:31:26 2015 UTC,Please go find a different subreddit to spew your negativity in
DMT,31ca1x,liam99966,-2,Sat Apr 4 02:23:00 2015 UTC,I'm not being negative I'm being realistic.
DMT,31ca1x,Stinkfished,3,Sat Apr 4 03:03:01 2015 UTC,"OK. I think I see where you are coming from. Someone who generally feels alright and has a few bad days back to back is probably not depressed in the common sense of the term. I'm guessing this was your impression of OP. Maybe that is what she/he is dealing with, but maybe they really are depressed. In the latter case, your condescending tone (see ""you idiot"") is doing more harm than good. This sub is a community brought together by the love of this illicit substance, an illicit substance that has the power to transform our very way of thinking and I hope that we can continue to keep /r/DMT as place where anybody can come to share their experiences or ask questions without being ridiculed too harshly."
DMT,31bx6x,bphill89,2,Fri Apr 3 17:31:59 2015 UTC,Have you heard this? Pineal gland optics by meshuggah  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JTwcId6kQ
DMT,31bx6x,Psychoptic,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:40:37 2015 UTC,I have actually I bought this album when I was a teenager. It is their best album IMO. Never really paid any attention to the lyrics of it until now and damn I love it more than before! Btw good music for your next trip if you haven't heard it already is a life once lost's album ecstatic trance
DMT,31bx6x,Psychoptic,1 point,Sun Apr 5 04:00:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation, I love slow heavy metal like that, and this seems really unique. As far as Meshuggah goes, their subject matter can be pretty psychedelic, especially the Catch 33 album which is my favorite. You might like their guitarists solo album ""Sol Niger Within"", it has some crazy deep lyrics. It's really experimental so it takes some getting used to, but it's worth it."
DMT,31bx6x,harmoni-pet,2,Sun Apr 5 06:22:48 2015 UTC,I will definitely look into that thanks!
DMT,31bx6x,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:37:45 2015 UTC,"The lyrics just sound like your run of the mill Terrance McKinna talk, which is fine.    I really don't understand the pairing of the lyrics with the music.  DMT world sounds nothing like this.  It is very fluid and smooth with a ting of technological presence.  There's the hum, which I find very pleasant, and then (at least for me) the hum starts to oscillate and sound very bubbly and high pitched.  like how bubbles look, with a soapy rainbow hue.  This just sounds like an apocalyptic hellscape sonically.  Its a weird juxtaposition, but to each their own.  Something more like this is what I experience sonically in 'the realm'  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DIUFhcK_5I"
DMT,31bx6x,dirtrox44,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:40:11 2015 UTC,Do you get the slo-mo robot voice and drip/crackle sounds? :)
DMT,31bx6x,harmoni-pet,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:47:48 2015 UTC,I have heard drip noises and also something that sounds like gears locking into place
DMT,31bx6x,Stinkfished,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:40:12 2015 UTC,"yeah the drip noises are honestly how I know its working. what's up with those?  I find them to be very beautiful and pleasant, but disorienting at the same time.  its a paradoxical world for sure"
DMT,31b674,ThePeskyWabbit,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:05:26 2015 UTC,"Mate, you're doing it all from the other end. :) Don't move the mesh, let it stay in the neck about a centimeter or at least half centimeter away from the edge, then preheat the mesh, so it heats up a bit. Then drop the spice on it, i use a regular straw to scoop spice, then drop like as if you were dropping something normally into a normal bottle, the neck it is. then some of the spice will melt, then take a normal lighter, not a jet / torch kind. And slowly, as slow as possible hold it under the glass neck slowly rotating to melt the spice, it should take about half a minute to a minute, you want this to be as slow as possible, to not burn the spice. Then as it all melts just take a hit and make sure seat belt's on. )) happy travels This method is way easier and less complicated, with less space for error than what you're doing right now. As for breakthroughs, take your time, try increasing doses, 50mg should be sufficient for a breakthrough, but if you're struggling maybe try improving your inhaling / holding technique. Try doing several tokes before fading out."
DMT,31b674,bserious7,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:31:18 2015 UTC,Thanks bud. Only thing is I'm currently using my inline perc as a chamber. I put the mesh in the part that Sits in the downstem and my mouth on where the bowl fits in. Not sure id be able to do it the way you mentioned because if I push the copper plug too far in there's no getting it back.
DMT,31b674,bserious7,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"Make 'the machine'. Takes couple minutes to make, works very well. Also i assume inline perc you mentioned is way bigger than 50ml bottle, which may cause condensation of dmt fumes - waste / loss of active ingredient which could be used for greater good. )"
DMT,31a25c,ThePeskyWabbit,3,Fri Apr 3 05:04:01 2015 UTC,"Feels weird accepting money for something like this.. For me at least I feel the experience is meant to be shared. How can one put a price on love?  Regardless, I'm glad you and your friends had a good experience. Stuff is pretty amazing."
DMT,31a25c,Molestador,2,Fri Apr 3 06:41:49 2015 UTC,"It's just an energy exchange, don't disregard the gift of giving either."
DMT,31a25c,Frogtech,1 point,Fri Apr 3 11:51:45 2015 UTC,I was originally going to make a profit but I took the first hit before anyone else and I wanted to give it for free. But I needed more money to get more and they were more than happy to pay the cost I paid for me to dose them up.
DMT,31a25c,brightstarblack,2,Fri Apr 3 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of people commenting on the money thing here.  Shows me they are still clinging to it.  Its just paper people.  He traded stupid material paper for probably one of the most important experiences these people have.  Why is this bad? Don't get me wrong I have completely felt like psychedelics can/should not be bought or sold.  but then again everything in our culture at this moment is this way.  Other medicine, food, even our jobs/freedom of living life without having to pay rent/taxes.  I just don't see why this money thing is so important to you all.  if you want truly value what lies beyond space and time then money is a laughing matter."
DMT,31a25c,Dcomplex,0,Sat Apr 4 13:43:27 2015 UTC,OP cool you're spreading the word. Less cool that you're charging for it. Work out what can benefit from the cash as opposed to you.
DMT,31a25c,navipokoy,3,Fri Apr 3 08:37:43 2015 UTC,"I really didn't want to. I honestly didn't. I asked for cost prices. I paid what they did to get it, Im just bounding it to them from the market Imo."
DMT,31a25c,navipokoy,0,Fri Apr 3 13:31:39 2015 UTC,sorry but selling a substance is not equal to being a shaman...
DMT,3191al,hamletmaschine,3,Thu Apr 2 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"The GVG is the best method, in my opinion, and worth the $109. I use 8 screens, sprinkle the powder (25mg for a good breakthrough) pre-melt with a few passes of my torch lighter, drop in the filter and pull slowly as I torch the ceramic filter just enough so that it starts glowing. Once it's full of dense vapor stop torching and clear it all. Fall back, hold it in for as long as you can and get ready for a wild ride.  I was a dedicated snorter, I tried the iron lung and the machine, gave up on those and decided to get the GVG. It's good knowing you can get the whole dose in one pull."
DMT,3191al,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:06:48 2015 UTC,"If you put the fire directly to the ceramic filter, you will ruin it.  Totally not necessary.  I've broken through many times on one hit using a regular Bic lighter with the GVG, lighting it as they recommend."
DMT,3191al,scrufdawg,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:18:49 2015 UTC,"Never ruins mine, but my flame isn't blasting directly on the filter. I hold it close enough so that it begins to glow, then I back off. I have done this every time and my filter is still fine. Worst case scenario is I buy a new filter.  I did it with a Bic but I would rather use the torch and vaporize the dose in 5 seconds without having to bend the flame into the filter by pulling excessively. I'd rather save the lung capacity for clearing it. It's all personal preference. The filter is doing its job and I never have to load more than 15-20mg."
DMT,3191al,smokinjoe65,2,Mon Apr 20 14:02:37 2015 UTC,"Refutation: THE MACHINE WORKS! And very well indeed. Here's what I learned: the steel mesh has to be well compressed, like a plug. I sprinkle DMT on it, and heat the neck of the bottle, slowly. I can see DMT liquifying. Then, I bring a lighter near the opening, and inhale slowly but strongly. This time, with each hit, I was absorbed more and more into that oh so geometrical and complex cheerful not sanity, not insanity, but something beyond. Really rejuvenating. If I did a larger dose, I suppose it would have been a breakthrough. Thinking about trying it right now. Guess I have to wait for the tolerance to drop. Will meditate in meantime..."
DMT,3191al,bserious7,2,Fri Apr 3 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: Tried it again, and it worked even better. Getting close, very close, didn't breakthrough, but I don't even mind. Getting familiar with the substance. It's very clean, friendly, and improves the mood. Beatiful geometry, fractal beauty of the mind, spirit, nature. Moving closer to unity. Relaxed, peaceful, aesthetic state of mind. DMT rules :)"
DMT,3191al,ThePeskyWabbit,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:34:20 2015 UTC,"Those were my first words after first successful blast-off - 'THE MACHINE WORKS'. Tell me my friend, how many tokes you manage to do? I find it difficult to even hold long enough the second one. By the time of third I'm already doing my space cowboy shit."
DMT,3191al,nahmsayin,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:20:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I went slowly, since I am just getting  to know THE MACHINE. I loaded a small dose, didn't really measure, and held the lighter far away for the first toke, just enough to produce some vaporization. This had an moderate effect, instant visuals, very complex. I got caught up in thoughts and memories for a minute, and then I lit up again,bringing the lighter closer this time. Even more impressive visuals, thoughts about cyclical nature of life, deep resounding peace. After a few minutes, I brought the lighter even closer, almost touching the mesh, but not burning it. Final wave of visuals. Overall, it was an intense, but peaceful experience, because it was spaced out. BUT, I imagine it would be completely different if I did it all in one or two tokes, without breaks. Getting close to THAT, I felt it for a moment, that is that, looking forward to it, all shall be revealed in time, I just know it will  :D"
DMT,3191al,FiteMeIRLnerd,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:30:31 2015 UTC,I literally did exactly this earlier. About 2 hours ago. Fucking knockout punch man. That shit was beautiful.
DMT,3191al,Dreamer83,2,Fri Apr 3 05:11:18 2015 UTC,"Step 1: Acquire b. caapi leaves and isopropyl alcohol  Step 2: Weigh out two parts b. caapi leaves per one part DMT  Step 3: Pour DMT into shot glass or open-lipped cup. Add enough IPA to cover the leaves you're going to add (shouldn't be more than an inch). Stir until fully dissolved.  Step 4: Add caapi leaves into solution, mix well.  Step 5: Let the fully IPA evaporate, leaving behind dry plant matter infused with DMT. You can have a fan blowing over the shot glass to speed up the process. Should not take more than 2-3 days to dry off.  Step 4: Congratulations, you have successfully made ""changa"" smokeable-- smokeable DMT-infused plant matter with a MAOI-containing herb base. Note that the MAOI part is optional, you can just as easily carry out this procedure with mint leaves, passionflower, whatever.  Step 5: Load ~80mg changa into bong, steel yourself to take 2-3 rips, say your prayers, yadayadayada  The total cost shouldn't be more than $25."
DMT,3191al,DabsJeeves,2,Fri Apr 3 14:09:46 2015 UTC,"glass vapor genie is 100% awesome once u dial it in. next best thing is Changa. very easy to make, the samecompany that sells the GVG sells inert herbs, take your raw dmt mix it in warm rubbing9 9% from cvs alc, and let  dry for days, and its much easier to blast off.. very simple effetcive and user friendly."
DMT,3191al,DabsJeeves,1 point,Sun Apr 5 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"GVG(Glass Vapor Genie) is just about perfection. My #1 preference is the Arizer Extreme Q bag system. Easily on par with the Volcano quality-wise, but I like it better. and it's like 1/4 the price.   For a portable system, I have yet to find something that beats the GVG. I love taking it up onto some lookouts in Sedona or similar.   Highly recommended. Make sure you buy the protective case for it. It's a little more money, but OH SO worth it."
DMT,3191al,Dreamer83,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:50:05 2015 UTC,Use an oil well/hot hit for concentrates. The holes are up on the side so you put it in the bottom and vape it with a glowrod
DMT,3191al,JManSenior918,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:56:45 2015 UTC,I assume it's the same thing. I have a little hot hit pipe that's all one piece from when I first started dabbing. It works amazing though
DMT,3191al,Dreamer83,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:01:44 2015 UTC,Small piece of copper chore boy balled up and set down on top of the bottom screen. Works perfect. I get zero drip through.
DMT,3191al,JManSenior918,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:05:35 2015 UTC,Have you broken through using the extreme q? I've always heard that it's not a good idea to use a bag vape because it'll re-solidify on the bag itself.
DMT,3191al,Dreamer83,2,Thu Apr 9 17:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've broken through with the bag. You just want to really made sure you clear the bag. If you're not going to clear it, at least release the rest of it out into the air. There is very minimal residue in my bag and it has been used probably... 15 times or so. You will need to have a bag dedicated to DMT of course, but yeah, it works great. It has been the favorite among everyone I have shown it to."

DMT,3191al,bserious7,2,Fri Apr 3 14:01:46 2015 UTC,"There are 4 pre-set temps on the remote, I use the 4th once, the hottest. I forget what the temp is. I think it labeled in C, but I have my display set to F anyways. I want to say it's around 400F but I could be forgetting. It's been a little bit."
DMT,3191al,dabalabadooooo,1 point,Sun Apr 5 22:32:08 2015 UTC,I say this in every gvg thread but here it goes again.   Have a soft or cushioned surface to set your gvg down on.  I lost control of my arm and cracked mine in half on my coffee table.  Having a friend help works too.
DMT,31a68n,LeprechronicChris,2,Fri Apr 3 05:51:19 2015 UTC,"Also, be careful when using drain cleaner for basification. I see yours says 100% lye but many contain other chemicals. I recommend red hot devil. Also, 200g of root bark and an equal amount of NaOH comes out to nearly a pound of dry material you need to fit into that small bottle. Might I suggest 100g or less for your first extraction? I use 50-60g and my 2L pyrex flask does a good job of containing the 1200-1400mL of solution.  Also, before committing to a TEK for ACRB, check out cyb's hybrid atb salt tek. There's a good bit of science and collaboration behind it."
DMT,31a68n,smokinjoe65,2,Fri Apr 3 06:12:25 2015 UTC,"Use that same drain cleaner, its perfectly fine."
DMT,31a68n,Dabblin,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:40:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reassurance.
DMT,31a68n,smokinjoe65,2,Sat Apr 4 01:08:22 2015 UTC,"+1  Cybs ab salt tek is the way to go. I like ~24 hour acid soak. I don't use salt btw, or the re xtalization"
DMT,31a68n,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:51:03 2015 UTC,"I always re-x. Every time I do there's at least a small drop of goo to pull out, even when it's a blanket of white crystals. I like seeing white in the end product, which is a bit more difficult with ACRB."
DMT,31a68n,smokinjoe65,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:14:12 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll look into the tek now. Thanks for the recommendation. Edit: having concluded my research on the tek I am willing to use it, partly because I won't have to deal with filtering out the plant matter and it looks like it will result in less of a mess. So one question I have is how much ascorbic acid I should be using in substitute of the vinegar used in the tek. In addition to changing over to this tek, I will also scale down my first batch accordingly, using only 50g of bark hoping I will yeild at least half a gram so I can begin my journey in experimenting with this molecule."
DMT,31a68n,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:22:06 2015 UTC,Ah I see your concern and I have researched the msds and roebic is confirmed pure NaOh. Also I am open to other teks but I assumed the 750ml bottle would at least be sufficient in size for the liked tek because the root bark is filtered and the resulting liquid is reduced to a manageable volume. I was also considering adding salt before my naphtha pulls. The thing I'm concerned about on the goldshlager bottle is the cap.
DMT,31a68n,Dabblin,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:29:15 2015 UTC,"Oh jeez, I'm a dummy... I forgot your picture of root bark wasn't powdered root bark... I wonder what your root bark reduction weight would be in relation to powdered?  Good luck with your extraction :)"
DMT,31a68n,Dabblin,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:18:15 2015 UTC,Ah OK. And I have a 1500watt blender capable of breaking it down further if you think I can pull more spice out rather than cause me more trouble trying to filter it out. And I'm confused as to what you mean about differences in weight.
DMT,314nwf,smokinjoe65,3,Wed Apr 1 23:43:04 2015 UTC,What steps did you take by order and how many grams of bark did you use for this particular yield?
DMT,314nwf,conceptionist,3,Thu Apr 2 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"Writing up the whole tek would be a lengthy process... however, mine is similar to cyb's hybrid atb salt tek. I use 55g of ACRB, and I heat it in a crock pot to 120-125Â°F from basification to the final pull. I don't roll or shake my mix, but instead stir it to keep it in solution. During pulls, I tilt the vessel 45Â° so I can slowly stir in a circular, top to bottom motion for 15 minutes. I let it sit for 15-20 minutes, verifying the presence of a nice separation interface before attempting a pull. With this particular batch I let the basified mix sit overnight, reheated it the next day and did my pulls. Hope this helps!"
DMT,314nwf,DarkMatterTraveller,2,Thu Apr 2 02:16:09 2015 UTC,Excellent looking pull! May I ask what was your naphtha to basic soup ratio?
DMT,314nwf,DarkMatterTraveller,2,Thu Apr 2 01:18:56 2015 UTC,I end up with an estimated 1200-1400mL of basified solution. Each pull is 75mL of naphtha.
DMT,314nwf,DarkMatterTraveller,2,Thu Apr 2 02:10:28 2015 UTC,"This looks amazing. I want all of the information, which it looks like you posted above."
DMT,314nwf,Turbo_Queef,2,Thu Apr 2 02:18:22 2015 UTC,I'm excited to see how my current batch does... I'm letting the acidified mix sit overnight this time.
DMT,314nwf,dmtpsychonaut,2,Thu Apr 2 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"As a general question, if you have a really good first or second pull, could that be it?  I just did my first extraction and the first and second pulls looked alright, but the following two were almost nil. Not sure what was different."
DMT,314nwf,Turbo_Queef,2,Thu Apr 2 02:22:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I do two pulls and compare the crystal formation between the two. If the second pull is drastically lower in crystal presence I won't do a third pull. I guess I'm not trying to get every molecule out of my mix, though. I make more than enough for myself."
DMT,314nwf,Turbo_Queef,2,Thu Apr 2 02:25:42 2015 UTC,"In reality that's how I should look at it too. I've got plenty more bark to perfect the process rather than squeeze every last drop out.  I did a defat, and my crystals looked pretty clean except some of the basified mix got in it."
DMT,314nwf,legalize-drugs,2,Thu Apr 2 02:35:46 2015 UTC,"Pulls are crucial, I find. The important thing to remember is not to disturb the basified mix while pulling off your naphtha. I back off if I see swirls forming out of the mix and move to a different section of the naphtha. Once the basified mix is disturbed it's much easier to accidentally pull it into your siphoning tool. :)"

The trip from this is very similar to vaped freebase spice. IMO it is much easier to dose effectively with this method.  Changa on the other hand, contains an MAOI which potentiated the trip. It goes from a 5-10 minute journey yo a 30-45 minute voyage through your own subconscious and the cosmos. The only thing about this method is you have to be VERY VERY careful about food and drug combinations when taking an MAOI as some of the aforementioned combos can be quite lethal.  I love e-leaf :)"

They both have their place. Changa is kind of a mix of the two. You can peer into spirit world while also while also going into The vastness of your subconscious. Very good way to experience dMT  Use a bong, but don't use water, as some of the substance will dissolve in it on the way up. Before taking a hit, hold the lighter INFRONT of the bowl for about 20-30 seconds with out inhaling. Don't burn it immediately. the key is to melt the dmt inside of it first and inhale that. After that let 'er rip and get the MAOIs into your system. Hold each hit as long as possible of course.

DMT,30xppz,smhno,2,Tue Mar 31 15:41:27 2015 UTC,"That technique is designed for mimosa bark, it has no acid soak. The acid soak is the first step, I soak it for ~24 hours, then Basify for at least an hour, then do naptha pulls. I'm sure you can get some yield without the acid soak, but the acid soak is very important in my opinion. Also, make sure your bark is ground to a powder. And one more thing, try to keep the temperature between 100 and 125Â° for at least the beginning of acid soak and for naptha pulls.  Edit: I use cybs ab salt tek, minus the salt. No re xtalization either."
DMT,30xppz,Dabblin,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, MHRB and ACRB have different structures surrounding their DMT molecules and require different methods to extract them.

Just curious."
DMT,30xppz,username2229,2,Tue Mar 31 16:23:20 2015 UTC,I've always gotten 1%+ yields so I never had the gumption to try it. I will eventually try with salt and compare. Can you tell a difference with/without salt?

DMT,30xppz,Dabblin,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply! This is what I was afraid of, that MHRB and ACRB had to be dealt with differently to get similar yields. I'll try Cybs' salt tek!   One question: the tek says that the mix should soak for at least one hour, so most people would probably do like 2 or 3...why do you do 24? How do you keep the water heated at a steady warm temp for that long?   Also Cybs pours out naphtha quickly then evaporates the rest with fans, but can you do the coffee filter method here instead? Like pouring out the product through a coffee filter to drain the naphtha, then just leaving the filter somewhere at room temp until dry. I don't know if I could pour out the solvent quickly enough before the crystals began to re-dissolve."
DMT,30xppz,Dabblin,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:51:54 2015 UTC,"No problem.   I do a long soak because I think I've had better yields from soaking longer. 1 hour is way too short in my opinion. Don't be in a hurry, let the acid break down the plant and release the goods.   I use water put through a coffee pot without coffee obviously. That's a good temperature to start with. DONT add lye to hot water. The reaction will cause a lot of heat... But I'll have my main jar in a pot of water and occasionally dump the cold and add more from the coffee machine. It can go to room temperature overnight but you want the whole jar back up past warm when doing naptha pulls.  I would either freeze the pulled naptha for 24 hrs and pour off naptha (save it to use next time) and then let the crystals in the glass tray air dry, or just let it air dry no freeze. I put an insulated heat mat underneath pan of naptha sometimes. The mat is made to help seedings start growing so it only gets 15-20 degrees warmer then the ambient temp. You don't want to cook the pulled naptha too hot. Just take your time, it could take 2-3 days to fully dry.  Edit: clarification"
DMT,30xppz,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"Just fyi, in my experience rolling or shaking your mix during a pull is highly ineffective compared to stirring. It can create a mess if you have a vessel that doesn't seal well, and that's no good when dealing with solutions of high pH.   I use a 2L erlenmeyer flask that I heat to 125Â°F in a crock pot full of water. When it's time to add naphtha and ensure a good mix, I tilt the flask 45Â° so I can stir in a circular, top to bottom motion. I stir for 15 minutes continuously with a 15 minute settle period before pulling and I get at least 1.5% yield after a re-x (fluffy, off-white crystals).  Just don't stir the shit out of it to avoid emulsions. At work, I do acid/base separations with solutions weighing thousands of pounds and we use high speed mixers without worrying about emulsions (With isopar-E as a safety solvent, which is pretty much naphtha).  I use a variant of cyb's hybrid atb salt tek."

DMT,30w381,ICA_Agent47,2,Tue Mar 31 10:04:36 2015 UTC,"Wow this really makes me want to breakthrough again - like more so than any report I've read in a while.  You're remarkably good at describing the DMT Experience. I totally understand the imagery you're trying to convey (though I haven't experienced those exact visuals).   I remembered briefly that I wanted to ask about the concept of time, but during the trip, all I could muster was ""time?""   I literally loled at this part because I totally understand the inability to formulate thoughts into language while tripping on DMT. It's weird, because you can totally formulate your thoughts coherently while tripping, it's just when it comes time to translate those thoughts into spoken language, it's like impossible lol I guess the part of your brain normally used for speech is busy, along with the rest of your brain, trying to figure out what the hell is going on.   When I asked, the face instantly shot green ribbons decorated with alphabetic/language figures through my body and I was propelled deeper into the trip.   This is so characteristically weird and random! This sentence is specifically what I was referring to when I said complimented your ability to describe the DMT trip - the vast majority of people, despite perhaps seeing the exact same thing, would be wholly unable to describe it based solely off it's sheer weirdness.  I like how you said ""When I asked"" even though you admitted not being able to say anything other than the word ""time"". I'm of the belief that you don't need to ""ask"" these beings questions verbally, that they can pretty much read your mind (I know, I'm crazy) so I think she understood what you were asking. Have you considered that perhaps her response of shooting the green alphabetic ribbons was her way of answering your question?   She stopped by a man at the bottom of the stairs, near a sort of control panel, and pointed into some sort of box as she urged me to come over and look. Needless to say I didnt look due to being too overwhelmed by the room before the trip ended.   I've heard users speak similarly of a box, and especially of beings encouraging you to come look at it. I, too, had a similar overwhelmed response (to the beings in general) and was unable to consent to letting them show me anything. The difference between your experience and mine is that I made this decision early on in the trip, so we just kind of danced until I came down haha.  I wonder what's in that box though."

I'm find this statement very interesting because that's essentially what happens when breakthrough on DMT - your soul leaves your body and goes ""outside"" (or into the spirit realm, if you will) to play. So the fact that you got this feeling is very intriguing, and I encourage you to go for the breakthrough experience next time you have the chance.   I opened my eyes and the faint pattern still hung on the wall.   This is also very interesting to me as it's the first time I've seen someone other than myself mention a sort of inverse afterimage effect. I noticed the same thing during my breakthrough experience; I saw very vivid and defined beings in my closed-eye hallucination, and opening my eyes left an ""inverse afterimage"" of them in my opened-eye vision. It was nuts. :P  Thanks for sharing your experience, I enjoyed reading it. :)"

My friend and I took a second trip in the morning with the last of what he had. It was a bit less intense. My dog still felt really soft, my pants (a washed and faded navy blue color) started to breathe, and I just generally felt like I was in wonderland; everything (including myself) kept shrinking and expanding. I remember telling my friend that I felt we were too big for the room.  edit: punctuation"

How will you explain having naptha, NaOH, and glass reaction vessels in your possession?

DMT,30rbsa,BotanyWithVinnieV,2,Mon Mar 30 01:18:34 2015 UTC,I've heard of DMT grasses that you can grow at home but I've never researched it. The plants that root barks are harvested from require years of growth to mature in their native environment.
DMT,30rbsa,smokinjoe65,2,Mon Mar 30 03:52:39 2015 UTC,"I understand this, it's something I'd like to do."
DMT,30rbsa,VandalizedVisions,2,Mon Mar 30 11:45:55 2015 UTC,Mimosa hostilis is the plant you want for root bark. You can easily buy seeds or even seedlings online. They might even have them at your local nursery.
DMT,30rbsa,dmtpsychonaut,2,Mon Mar 30 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"When you say grow a plant you are clearly underestimating what 'plant' means. MH and AC are trees and large shrubs meaning you will need 30+ years to get any sizable root bark. How do you expect this to go down in what I'm assuming is a short-term growing? Given like a few months to grow, the best you'd get from those plants is tiny whole roots, damaging the plant itself in the process, due to the root loss.  That DMT-containing grass has poisonous substances in it. This whole process isn't just something you can do on a whim. Where mushrooms can be grown on a kitchen counter, you'd need actual plots of land to grow AC and MH trees. Your best bet is to pack up your stuff and move to Hawaii or Taiwan where AC is considered an invasive species."
DMT,30qfg1,paperlace,3,Sun Mar 29 20:39:25 2015 UTC,I was dealing with many similar things 2-3 years ago.  Right after my trip I posted a report on my experiences.
DMT,30qfg1,Senzu,3,Sun Mar 29 20:53:04 2015 UTC,"I'd say continue work with pscilocybin , maybe even microdosing? The state 1g of shroomies puts you in is perfect to work with self-image and get to the root of emotional issues.  I went through a long stressful changing period where I felt extremely depressed over what seemed like hundreds of different topics creating a whirlwind in my consciousness. Low doses of azurescens and cubensis really showed me how easily healing can be if you allow yourself to open to it. But this means beyond the psychedelic experience. The more I treated my life like the way I ""feel"" on a low dose, the more things started to make sense. I feel like I've passed the halfway point of my healing process, and there are now more positive than negative moments in my life. For me I realized over time that most of my mental struggles come from wanting to control the variables of my personal experience. The more I let go, the more peace and inner warmth I feel.  I hope things get better for you soon, and if you do choose to take DMT I hope you get what you're after."
DMT,30qfg1,SnithuBAP,2,Sun Mar 29 21:11:08 2015 UTC,"My DMT experience has done two things for me, and I'll keep it short. Firstly, to get the most out of my DMT journeys (especially snorting ) I need to have great control over my mind and whether I guide my thoughts or if they guide me. Secondly, coming out of a DMT flash leaves me in a state of awe and happiness, which helps in my everyday life.   These things are all subjective. Much of what may happen before, during and after a trip is manifested in our mind and enhanced/exploited by the substances we use, for better or worse. Just go in with good intentions and a positive mindset and, if things get scary, simply smile :) This will perpetuate good energy during your experience and carry you to the end.  Good luck, be safe and have fun!"

DMT,30qdmc,thanksdiego,3,Sun Mar 29 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"If that's DMT, it's the nastiest example of DMT I've ever seen.

Whoever made that didn't really know what they were doing and I'd worry about contamination.   That being said, I'm glad another person is seeking the experience :) If you're really serious about it, research extracting your own.

Since the picture kinda looks funky I'll explain how I see it maybe I can get a more accurate description. When I first got it it was solid and I could shake it up and down the container, pretty sturdy and kinda shiny. It must have gotten hot where I lived and kinda melted down a bit. The color is not really brown but more of an ember color with orange being the more distinguished looking color. Does it kinda explain a little better of what the DMT I have looks like?"
DMT,30qdmc,smokinjoe65,2,Sun Mar 29 20:59:20 2015 UTC,"That sounds right but still slightly low quality (still smokeable). Check out some meth pipes or similar methods. It's funky goo but still perfectly usable, if not a bit impure."
DMT,30qdmc,OneHighJedi,3,Sun Mar 29 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"If your friend did the extrction himself, he likely did it from ACRB. That brown goo is rich in NMT in addition to DMT. I'd suggest using an oil burner (meth pipe) to vaporize that. It's completely potent. I'm always okay with this DMT when I make since I don't intend sell it and only make it for personal use.  It looks wet because he either 1) didn't wait for the naptha to fully precipitate after his scrape, or 2) the substance is melting at room temps (so put it in the freezer until you use it)."

DMT,30r6ha,smokinjoe65,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:18:08 2015 UTC,Thank you. I will use the filter method and update
DMT,30r6ha,dmtpsychonaut,2,Mon Mar 30 05:15:56 2015 UTC,"Demty is spot on with the solution. Remember, the longer you let crystallized DMT sit at room temperature or above in naphtha, the more likely it is to dissolve back into solution."
DMT,30r6ha,ComptonCrusader,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:50:31 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like your pulls aren't thoroughly saturated with the spice. Try mixing your naphtha with the basic solution longer and see if that helps. If you began with a smaller amount of root bark, try using less naphtha during your pulls so that the NPS you do have becomes fully saturated.   I've experienced the same situation and tried the coffee filter with little success. The amount of DMT left on the filter was miniscule and I felt like some of it definitely got stuck in the fibers of the filter, doing me no good whatsoever.   Edit: as an aside, I think what you mean you say in your title is ""precipitation"" as opposed to evaporation. The crystals precipitate out of solution in the freezer. You could leave that dish in your closet for a few days and some nice crystals would probably form if you wanted to go the evap route. Best, biggest crystals I've gotten have been from room temperature evaporation with no fan. And the one time I did use a fan, I got nil. Idk why but there it is."

I heard this extremely loud but almost incomprehensible voice due to how low and slow the voice was. As if Viper played his latest album at full blast and at half speed directly into your brain, but it was talking about the connections between math and history and i found what i could understand quite fascinating. I was in the druid themed classroom still in the dmt dream which was weird but it was occupied with circuitry entities and there was now this new black, brown and gold retro techno clockwork paisley look about it which overlaid the plants and crystals and shit .  When i woke into my regular dream i told my friend, dude i think i understand why some claim to have heard God, maybe they actually heard something and that's the only way they can rationalize it to themselves.

DMT,30o3bf,smokinjoe65,5,Sun Mar 29 03:46:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I am kind of with you here. I always found ego death to be a clunky term and one that is often used in ways that are not the true loss of self. I mean if one was to loose the perspective of self there would be no way of experiencing or knowing whats going on. Whats going on requires a subject the loss of the subject makes for something that has no description and therefore really does not exist. Shit can get crazy though and complicated in ways that feel like a connection to something infinite and I think this is where people see ego death. In a sense no one can ever truly experience ego death. The very idea negates itself.
DMT,30o3bf,mmcakes,2,Sun Mar 29 06:42:15 2015 UTC,"Different terms become overused and the real meaning gets lost in the sauce. Similarly, I get frustrated when people talk about snorting DMT and they say, ""it won't work without a MAOI"" or ""you have to convert it to DMT fumarate for it to be water soluble."" They talk like they have experience in the matter when my empirical knowledge of snorting DMT tells me otherwise. Armchair experts and assumed knowledge (I'm guilty of this one) influence the propagation of disinformation. I just started this thread to correct my past claims of having ego death :)"

You're arguing against a strawman because you fail to understand what ego death means. You can either look into it more (sam harris is hardly trying to sell anything, there's plenty of videos on youtube explaining the concepts - although his book is incredible) or you can pretend that your brand of pseudo-skepticism is all knowing. Either way, you've probably experienced the loss of self at some point in your life without knowing it (flow states). Good luck with your limited understanding of your own consciousness!"

DMT,30o2g0,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:21:48 2015 UTC,"Nice! Is your bark pre-powdered? This makes the DMT much more readily available in terms of surface area for extraction (breakdown of chemical structure through acidification and basification, etc)."
DMT,30o2g0,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:34:17 2015 UTC,"No I like shredded. I feel like the powdered might oxidize and lose potency? I have no proof to support this claim.. But I do put the shredded bark in a coffee grinder or food processor to make it mostly very fine powder.  It's weird, when I defat I get 2x my normal yield which is counterintuitive, plus, said spice didn't really melt like it should, when it vaporized it got hard and stick to side of pipe..., but I think my naptha may be too hot on the second pull. I got a thermometer and 125 has done me well the last 2 times, which I skipped the defat and have some good spice."
DMT,30o2g0,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:51:17 2015 UTC,"I heat mine to the same temp during mix/settle cycles and pulls, which has also served me well. I use the powdered ACRB (1kg bag) and it's held its potency due to me keeping it in a zip lock in the freezer."
DMT,30o2g0,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:59:15 2015 UTC,"Sounds legit. Yep, nice to have some bark on hand in the freezer incase the apocalypse happens. It's legal and make a really good dye ;)"

DMT,30o2g0,needan_accounttopost,2,Mon Mar 30 00:56:20 2015 UTC,They can only do so much to prevent us from expanding our consciousness. Banning substances like mushrooms or DMT make me question the government's agenda toward people breaking free from the producer/consumer system that the powers that be hold so near and dear.
DMT,30lmfh,hokksund,3,Sat Mar 28 14:18:27 2015 UTC,"Snorting is the preferred method for me if I want a longer trip (45-60 minutes). I found it can be a bit overwhelming at times, however. My breakthrough duration alone would be between 10-15 minutes, followed by 30-40 minutes of open eye distortion and enhanced colors similar to a high dose of LSD. That was on ~75mg.  Look up ayahuasca analogs if you want a longer trip (anahuasca, pharmahuasca, etc) but study up on MAOIs if you plan on using them."
DMT,30lmfh,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:47:56 2015 UTC,really? isnt it painful as fuck?
DMT,30lmfh,smokinjoe65,5,Sat Mar 28 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"It requires one to work with the discomfort, but (as lame as it sounds) the pain was always a part of the journey and we'll worth it. Some experiences were a bit more uncomfortable but most of the time, it stung like salt water or pool water in the nose.  If you don't think you can work with the discomfort, I don't recommend it. The key is acknowledging the sensation and using strength of mind to move past it and keep it from overpowering your trip."
DMT,30lmfh,felix1429,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:08:46 2015 UTC,Is there a lot of powder to snort?  And how fast does it hit you?
DMT,30lmfh,smokinjoe65,3,Sat Mar 28 23:18:55 2015 UTC,"It's fluffy so it looks like more than it is. It'll hit within 3 minutes at least, maybe 5 at most depending on dosage.   Resist the urge to sniffle. It pulls the powder out of your nose and creates a nasty drip, which is rendered useless once you swallow it."
DMT,30lmfh,ChippC,3,Sat Mar 28 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"Boil 3-5 grams of preground syrian rue seeds for 30 minutes (water and a squirt of lemon juice). Strain out the liquid, boil again in more liquid. Add up three of these small batches of liquid, simmer until it's a manageable amount to drink (less than 100ml), and drink it up on an empty stomach. 20 minutes later, vape your spice, and the effects will be on the order of 45 - 90 minutes. Don't vape as much - do your research about spice dosage with this method"

DMT,30lmfh,randywatson666,2,Sun Mar 29 00:52:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't have them on hand. The great thing about how long it lasts is that you can dose in stages. Start low at 15mg. Prepare another couple of small 10mg doses and ingest them after. That should be a good way to test these out. What do you think? The only dose experience I know off hand also includes an oral ingestion of 80mg beforehand, so it won't do you well for comparison's sake..."
DMT,30lmfh,mykhathasnotail,2,Sun Mar 29 03:38:50 2015 UTC,I did some looking around and found this. Looks like that'll work!

DMT,30mm9a,Psilocyborn,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, the ""seal"" of foil had been torn and shredded, probably indicating that the NaOH had already begun to react with it."
DMT,30mm9a,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:36:57 2015 UTC,My suggestion is to get a mason/ball jar that can hold your concoction with proper ring and lid. Very inexpensive and very handy
DMT,30mm9a,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"If you're creating the seal so you can roll or shake your solution, you can just as easily stir it with better results. Only thing to be mindful of is stirring more gently when you add naphtha to avoid emulsions. Stirring will always keep it in solution more efficiently and uniformly.   I've never seen the point in rolling a basified solution. At work we do acid/base separations on the 1000s of pounds scale and we use high speed mixers, with a settling period before separation."
DMT,30lr4r,brightstarblack,2,Sat Mar 28 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"The tek you use won't make a difference if you don't take your time and follow each step to completion. I'm not saying you're guilty of this... it's just that I use a variant of cyb's hybrid atb salt tek with ACRB and I get off white crystals with a bit (quite literally, just a drop in the evap dish) of goo, without a defat step. I re-x for off white powder, no goo, ~2% yield.  Most of the teks work reasonably well, but the best results come when you can tailor a tek to your own liking based on a good working knowledge of the process."
DMT,30lr4r,smokinjoe65,4,Sat Mar 28 17:24:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. Admittedly, I was not patient enough in the last step.  Should have let the pulls sit in the freezer longer I guess.  Everything else I followed to a tee.  I even got white crystals but when I scraped them up they got mixed with too.  Still, I wish I could find a guide which explains the ten on a scientific level so I could better understand the processes and how they should be ideally carried out."
DMT,30lr4r,bserious7,1 point,Sat Mar 28 19:35:39 2015 UTC,"I have recently tried Earthwalker's, people say it's best tek for acrb out there, with highest yields. I mush have done something wrong however, but check the forum, people's feedbacks are great."
DMT,30lr4r,SearchingForAnAnswer,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:45:27 2015 UTC,"You can do Normans STB tek which is pretty simple and gets good results. If you can, add a defat step before the base (so that would be any traditional acid step in an acid/base tek.) DMT nexus has a lot of teks out there, as long as you go with an acid/base tek you should be solid."
DMT,30ks2c,hamletmaschine,2,Sat Mar 28 06:06:05 2015 UTC,"the way i do it, is preheat the mesh, so it heats up a bit. then drop the spice on it, drop like as if you were dropping something normally into a normal bottle, the neck it is. then some of the spice will melt, then take a normal lighter, not a jet / torch kind. And slowly, as slow as possible hold it under the glass neck slowly rotating to melt the spice, it should take about half a minute to a minute, you want this to be as slow as possible, to not burn the spice. Then as it all melts just take a hit and don't hold on. )) happy travels"
DMT,30ks2c,bserious7,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:42:47 2015 UTC,"Thnx. So, you preheat the mesh, and put it back in the neck? Then you drop the spice into the neck with the mesh?"
DMT,30ks2c,bserious7,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"no, you don't move the mesh, let it stay in the neck about a centimeter or at least half centimeter away from the edge, you preheat with a lighter whilst it still is in the neck, and then just drop spice onto it"

Make sure you crush or grind the rue well, they're tough seeds. An industrial strength coffee grinder will do the trick or what I did was smash all the seeds with pliers. That took a while but was effective.   For the ACRB, I used... I can't really remember the exact amount. Maybe 6g? Anyway, I prepared this in the same way as the rue tea: boiled 3 times in water with a dash of lemon juice.   Drink the rue tea first and wait for effects to kick in. The drink the ACRB tea (yuck) and make sure you have a good place to purge once you start to feel the nausea start. You can boil the tea with an egg to reduce nausea but I haven't tried that myself. The nausea wasn't super bad for me, but I definitely purged for about 20 minutes.   As always, be sure you know about any dangerous food/medicine combinations.

But look at this video. He is at peace with everything and you can see the glory in his eyes. If anything this video goes to show the positive side of psychedelic experiences.   Sure he is incriminating himself but you are equally as judgemental as the law when you tell him he is wrong for making a video.  OP great experience, protip: twist your pipe in a fashion to expose the molecule to more heat surface area. Roll the drug around along the heated glass for better vapor production   Good for you for having the balls to share your experience with us."
DMT,307tfw,RaoulDuke209,10,Wed Mar 25 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"I'm glad it's not a one sided battle here :). Your comment really helped. I don't understand how you can have people who have experienced this drug, that also post about it in public forum, are worried about more information being posted in a public forum. The paradigm is shifting and I hope eventually they'll see that one needs to be brave to affect change. The way I see the people goating me for posting it is rather paranoid, shallow, and just as egotistical as they claim I am. Sure, everyone has ego, that's what this drug shows us right? But at least I can satisfy my ego by sharing what could be useful to some people as well as provide something that's interesting. Though I do agree with some of their points, they don't see it like you or the few others did who watched to the end, where you can literally almost feel the hapiness pouring through the screen (maybe it just feels that way for me haha)."
DMT,307tfw,rexolot,3,Wed Mar 25 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone negative at all? Have any of your DMT trips taught you anything? Love everyone like they're a neighbor, its not about hiding DMT experiences, ""Ruining it for everyone"" really?! come on guys this was a brilliant video. Don't listen to these people OP, I've already learned that the reddit community is usually full of a lot of negativos. Hope they can find peace in their hearts some day its a shame DMT didn't help them :\"
DMT,307tfw,rexolot,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:35:08 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying. I get that people have different opinions, though. I do understand where most of them are coming from. But it's from a place of fear, which is the main thing DMT taught me.. Not to trust fear.  For those claiming I'm egotistical in posting it, to deny that would be hipocritical. Humans evolved with ego so everybody has one. At the same time, I wanted to share an experience, a selfless act. On the other hand they want me to keep it to myself for their own selfish ideal in ""ruining"" ""their"" drug?"

DMT,307tfw,spuncookie,7,Thu Mar 26 04:18:24 2015 UTC,"really wish people wouldn't film dmt trips. why draw attention? salvia used to be easy to get until people did this shit. dmt is hard enough already, we don't need MORE scrutiny coming our way. why do you want to film it anyway? if you could take the camera into your head that would be one thing. but just watching you smoke? why?"
DMT,307tfw,SLURREY,8,Wed Mar 25 07:36:29 2015 UTC,"I agree that filming yourself is somewhat unnecessary. Seeing young adults do drugs on film is one of the major ways attention is drawn to them by the mainstream media in a negative light. Add to that that usually all you see someone doing is reacting to/interacting with invisible surroundings and it's easy to spin into a negative for the media, even if the person in the film is only smiling and reaching for things that aren't there. Also, from the perspective of another explorer, watching someone smoke spice on film is like watching someone play video games with no screen... on film.  Now, OP, I'm not saying that your video will be used this way and I am happy that you felt like you wanted to share such a beautiful personal experience with us all. I do think however that perhaps it's not the most... effective outlet for the inspiration and wisdom being given to us?"

The reason for the video though is to show people what their body is doing. For some reason this was a big aspect for me pre-launch. Definitely not the most ""effective"" outlet but it's the one I use and I'm sure I'll find more ways to be a better advocate as I go along."

DMT,307tfw,PsychedelicBuddha,-1,Wed Mar 25 17:48:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, clearly people can and will do whatever they want. I'm still gonna call it as see it, which is irresponsible and immature. Nothing more than an ego fulfilling attention grab. This video made a very beautifully subjective experience look nothing more than tweaking off some strange bathroom cooked drugs. It gives an appearance that could easily be manipulated to paint a negative image and does nothing to convey the extremely subjective experience to others. He took what could be portrayed as a beautiful spiritual experience rife with ritual and instead made a video that would make his grandma cry if she saw it. Lame."

Ninja Edit: It essentially is tweaking off some bathroom cooked drugs, just depends on your perspective and how you use it, honestly, which is what the last half of the video is for."
DMT,307tfw,superatheist95,6,Wed Mar 25 17:18:58 2015 UTC,"The reason I posted it was for people like me. When I first started researching I heard that you essentially ""knock out"" for 15 minutes and then come back. Based on my experiences with it, that was not so much the case 100% of the time. When researching I was looking for trip videos to know a little bit more of what to expect. I see it as education, for a better understanding in pre-launch research. I personally wasn't ready to step up to the plate until I witnessed other people, so it could help someone make a yes or no decision that's right for them. And I don't think I'll draw any more attention than Joe Rogan or ""The Spirit Molecule"", and if anything I feel it necessary to stand up for my beliefs in that we should be free to film and express whatever it is we feel the whimsy to. If you don't act on your beliefs, they will sooner be taken away."

DMT,307tfw,Frogtech,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"Personally, I felt like I needed the release from DMT. I've gone through a bit of a stressful time in the past year, and I waited until I was sure the time was right for my mental state. But it really did give me what I was looking for, just not in the way I expected.   Anytime I have done a psychadelic there's been a reason behind it, like a mental cleaning of the cobwebs type of deal. What frustrates me is that people that don't like it or the idea behind it and they say ""Not for me, not for anyone."" Where a LOT of people find solace  from these experiences. Even if it did nothing else, I think there's a lot to be said about sustaining a positive emotional state of the masses.   When abused, yes they can be dark, I've done my fair share of binging. Ultimately though that's why we need more education."
DMT,307tfw,spuncookie,2,Wed Mar 25 21:43:16 2015 UTC,"right on. and that's fair. there's just so many reasons why you should avoid broadcasting some things though. the harm that could come from a video just doesn't strike me as worth it.   spirit molecule does a great job of educating, and i'm 100% about that. just showing the actual experience strikes me as off."

DMT,307tfw,Sykedelic,9,Wed Mar 25 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, WE know what DMT is capable of. The general public and the legislators do not (or they do).  However we are not yet at a critical mass where going direct about psychedelics will impart the changes we want. Quite the contrary, we are the crazy people who 'see things that are not there', the 'hallucinated', the 'one trip away from insanity', 'getting addicted to psyhedelics' crowd.  Remember the reasons psyhedelics were made illegal in the first place. It had nothing to do with public health, safety, concern for the public or the people taking the drugs, and everything with having realized that these are powerful agents of transformation, and transformation is bad news for the status quo.  Lastly, as nonsensical as it is, you have just posted proof of consuming a schedule I substance illegal in most of the world. Did you use Tor? What happens if indeed your video becomes very famous and some nameless bureaucrat takes an interest in teaching you a lesson?  How will any future employees or business partners see your public drug consumption?  One day the old dinosaurs will die out and if we managed to educate enough people by then, the laws will change. That won't happen if we are all in jail (for the horrible crime of exploring our consciousness) or if there is another backlash against psychedelics.  And if there is, believe me, we WILL lose. Our fickle numbers are no match for ignorance and propaganda. We would do well to be low key in educating others about psychedelics, for the time being."

Like I've said before, I stand behind my beliefs and will do my best to educate those who oppose my beliefs. The world wont change by hiding it though, and that basically summarizes the way I look at it, as well as even I did become a martyr there was some insight I provided that many others are too opposed to provide.

DMT,307voe,Lips_of_Anubis,2,Wed Mar 25 04:18:48 2015 UTC,"Brain chemistry is not the same for everyone, or for most people even. Combine this with the fact that the effects of one molecule may be altered when taken in conjunction with other substances.   This isn't necessarily all fun and games though. Many substances have various levels of neuro-toxicity and especially when combined these toxicity levels can become dangerous. Good examples of highly neurotoxic combinations would be: SSRI's with MAOI's, this combination can kill you! another example would be...  wait for it...  MDMA, especially if taken with or cut with any other amphetamines. MDMA causes neurotoxicity in the serotonergic system. It's also been found to form lesions in the serotonergic nerve terminals. It's negative effects have been well documented, and are very similar to that of other amphetamines (that's right, MDMA IS an amphetamine).  Now, it's important to consider that, so far, the majority of Tryptamines are NOT neurotoxic. The exception to this is Ketamine, which is arguably WAY more neurotoxic than MDMA for example. Other molecules in the tryptamine family however, such as LSD and the various DMT structures, have been found to be 100% non toxic. This is not to say however that they don't come with their own risks. Check it out...  Tryptamines have a major drawback. They are well known for triggering dormant mental instability and psychosis. People with dormant schizophrenia, who don't know, have in the past taken tryptamines and had either semi permanent or even permanent psychotic effects. This is NOT a risk in everyone, ONLY in people who already have genetic predisposition and already latent mental illness. It typically happens to people in their early twenties.  Many people can experience short psychosis under the effects of tryptamines as well. This is typically diagnosed by the community as a ""bad trip"". Usually this is nothing to worry about, the effects of the powerful substance on a human brain are pretty crazy, and even a brain without latent issues may need a moment to snap back and regather itself. Many people talk about ego loss or inability to relate to reality upon first returning from a DMT trip partially for this reason.  Now, I can't say this for certain, however I would say it's a fair guess that if you are experiencing drastically longer than average DMT effects (I'm talking heavy open eye visuals, things that aren't real/don't make sense) past 40 minutes, and you haven't used an MAOi, stop until you are sober. Only a few things can really be doing this, and they range from ""not the best"" to ""potentially fuck your year up"".   If it's a situation of the MDMA further potentiating the DMT, this is bad. MDMA is NOT an MAOi. It is not meant to potentiate DMT, your body does not use it to deactivate your MAO system. Chances are if it is the MDMA causing the lengthened effects, it's due to neurotoxicity involving your serotonin receptors. Tryptamines interact with serotonin receptors.  The other possibility is that you have something dormant, which could be potentially very mild that you aren't aware of, which is effecting/being effected by the cocktail of psychoactive molecules being smoked/ingested.  HERE IS YOUR BEST BET KIDDOS: Do NOT knowingly mix drugs without heavily researching potential side effects! Even though they make us feel really good, you often won't feel the seriously negative effects at all or until its too late. Many a tripper has passed out and been taken to the hospital for blacking out/losing self control from mixing too much together without knowing what could happen. If you ARE curious about mixing things, extending experiences, or further potentiating the effects of our favorite things make sure to do so WISELY. Research deeply what are the potential side effects and what works together versus what should be taken by itself.  Here is an article on the neurotoxicity of MDMA with amphetamines. One of the most common combinations found in party culture today. Yes, psychonaut culture is part of rave and party culture as well (or you could say they are different faces of the same creature). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181923/  Fly safe kids, and remember to moderate a bit."

I tried 30mg and feel like I wasted a lot by not being able to clear it without exhaling a bit. I'd have to keep the pipe plugged, full of vapor, while I let what was in my lungs take effect. Right now it just feels like I'm wasting part of the trip while I worry about inhaling, holding it in and lighting up. So far, snorting is more powerful by far but I have a bit to learn still.  What I try to do is light/inhale for 5 seconds, clear it and hold for 5 seconds, repeat. This method doesn't seem to be working, however. What's the tolerance build up for vaping like? I'd redose at 45-60 minutes snorted.  Once I get used to it I'm sure it'll be great :)"

All we can do is try to let our brains give the best output based on the input we receive. Whatever is behind the veil of our reality, fire is still hot and organisms still need nourishment.

DMT,2zvql9,McDaddyLPN,3,Sun Mar 22 14:53:45 2015 UTC,that idea is uninformed until you try it. i've seen the hardiest skeptics start talking a little more mystically after experiencing dmt. you'll look back and consider yourself simple for ever having reduced it like that. at least it certainly changed the way i look at things!
DMT,2zvql9,wind_up_tori,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:48:54 2015 UTC,It does change the way you look at spirituality but it hasn't made me any less skeptical. I still don't believe in ghosts or the afterlife more than just ideas with no concrete basis.  I think it's fine to believe what you want but I'm not going to start dedicating myself to reincarnation based on psychedelic experiences. If it's real then sweet but it's far more likely that we are all just different expressions of the universe. We know we're all made from the universe and are conscious so that's really all the further we can preach.
DMT,2zvql9,shmerk-a-berl,2,Mon Mar 23 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"my point is that reducing these experiences as just a product of ""brain overload"", is dismissive. i'm not talking about the specifics of afterlife or reincarnation.  as for preaching, i generally avoid it only to encourage first hand experience if you're really ready to explore these ideas."
DMT,2zvql9,wind_up_tori,-2,Mon Mar 23 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing, we have no idea it isn't just brain overload. You may feel a sense of oneness and nostalgia when tripping but that doesn't mean it's anything more than your brain doing the shit it's supposed to do when overloaded with dmt.   People get scared when it's dark but that doesn't mean there's anything to be scared of, just that's what your instincts do when it's dark."
DMT,2zvql9,shmerk-a-berl,2,Mon Mar 23 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"what exactly is brain overload? we've got to be careful with language, especially when it doesn't really mean anything in particular.   there are things that science will never measure, when you've had the experience of oneness you intuitively know it's the truth.  reality really is consensus based though, go back to your day to day habits and environment and you'll eventually start doubting your gnosis.  ""that's just what your instincts do when it's dark"". there's a good reason we have those instincts, you might not be in actual danger but you are more vulnerable in the dark and that uncertainty can evoke anxiety."
DMT,2zvql9,wind_up_tori,-2,Mon Mar 23 17:45:43 2015 UTC,I think we assign meaning to things that have no objective meaning all the time. Just knowing something as inate doesn't make it so. Why do we think our consciousness matters so much and must have a meaning? We could very well have no meaning and no connection to other realms. All I'm saying is we have no clue and assigning vivid hallucinations to a message from another dimension is based in absolutely nothing.
DMT,2zvql9,shmerk-a-berl,5,Mon Mar 23 18:04:26 2015 UTC,"i agree that we basically know nothing. that's one of the very first things i got with dmt and a science background. cosmic smackdown from arrogance to being intellectually humble.  i didn't say anything about consciousness having a meaning though. i felt that it just is, always has been and will be. that we're all just different points of view emanating from a single timeless, formless, infinite source.  as for it being a vivid hallucination, that there are such common ideas shared by those who have had deep dmt experiences suggests the sense of oneness (for one example) might be more than just a hallucination. these common ideas are being shared by people of different cultures across the globe. i think we might be dealing with something innate."
DMT,2zvql9,wind_up_tori,2,Mon Mar 23 18:21:47 2015 UTC,"i agree. my dmt experience just opened me up to the possibility that there is something else out there, not the certainty. anyone that claims they know the truth doesn't realize how full of shit they are. atheist, hardcore religious fanatic... both are too arrogant w/ their limited knowledge/experience. maybe it's all subjective, i don't know."
DMT,2zvql9,mirolune,0,Wed Mar 25 16:45:18 2015 UTC,"could not agree more. When i go into a trip thinking about what comes after this life, I see what i want to see at that moment. Reincarnation, heaven or hell etc.. These are all ideas that have been planted into our heads.

For the majority of the trip I was in a waiting room with millions of other souls I was stuck in a thought loop I literally could not control my thoughts.

DMT,2zvql9,Pr1musSucks,2,Tue Mar 24 05:15:26 2015 UTC,I wouldn't dwell on it. Take the experience for what it is. Afterlife or not it's an insane experience and needs to be kept separate from reality.
DMT,2zvql9,Demty,1 point,Mon Mar 23 10:55:54 2015 UTC,"DMT is a mirror that will show you whatever you want it to. More often you see your subconscious desires rather than your conscious ones. Do you want there to be life after death? I know at times I do. However, I think anybody that believes DMT actual connects them to the afterlife is insane. I understand where you'd get the idea cause i've felt like i've died too but it's crazy unlikely that DMT is a portal to the afterlife. You see what you want (or really don't want) to see. What's far more interesting is figuring out WHY the amplified sensory state of dmt feels like ""going home"" or like what we imagine an afterlife to be like. After taking DMT I got the idea in my head that i needed to find some sacred word to gain access to eternal bliss. I frantically ran through every combination of sounds imaginable to find the sacred word. My vision kept spinning in thousands of rectangular frames in and out of focus as i tried words different words. I felt i was body jumping at times too. As always, eventually i came down and realized that i was not dead. In fact i hadn't moved an inch. It is always JUST IN YOUR HEAD. Try not to indulge too much in fantasizing about the possibility of an afterlife. This life is far too interesting to ignore for another life that isn't even guaranteed."

This is commonly referred to as the chrysanthemum. When people speak of breaking through, they mean breaking through and surpassing this initial stage of the experience. Typically it takes larger doses to do so. Commonly this does involve disconnection from any of the physical senses and awareness of the body.  What lies beyond the chrysanthemum is what is sought by most serious users, and can vary dramatically from trip to trip, person to person.  Users often describe intensely alien experiences in environments which diverge dramatically from our normal reality.  Encounters with conscious beings are not uncommon."

DMT,2zvvfy,smokinjoe65,2,Sun Mar 22 12:31:38 2015 UTC,"Firstly, TLDR just watch the video at the bottom. Just reached my farthest launch today. What I learned from dabbling with small doses and then a somewhat larger dose (nonweighed) was that it's a different experience every single time, but at the end of it all there's this incredibly peaceful and satisfying energy that fills your mind body and soul. Today when I launched, I hit the pipe and took a bigger rip than usual, and then took another rip, honestly debated a third but by the time I decided I knew I wouldn't ""need"" it. I got the familiar psychedelic softened vignette tunnel like vision from most psychedelics where it looks like a dream but you can see reality is definitely there. Then shortly after you start losing your sense of hearing. That's when it hit me like an atomic bomb. All the sudden I feel like I'm flying and falling and being pressed all at the sme time when the world around me turned into beautifully colored patterns. I tried to close my eyes and breakthrough, but breathing became somewhat difficult and I kept literally grabbing at reality, trying to grab it and bring myself back. I got a sip of water and then thoroughly enjoyed the colors around me, and the carpet which flowed like electric neon pulsating sea anenome on the ocean floor. It looked alive. But the two strongest feelings were at the beginning ""Oh FUCK"" and the feeling after the ride started slowing down, ""Oh fuck yessssssssss :)))))))"" It showed me what I had assumed about it was completely completely wrong. You will never be ""ready"" because you can't be ready for what you have no idea how to be ready for. It's just taking in the moment, and realizing in the next 5 seconds your entire perception of reality will be tossed out the window only to come back down completely at peace with being completely fucked by your mind. lol https://vimeo.com/123139327 [Trip Video 11 minutes]"
DMT,2zvvfy,OfficialYoungNitro,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:35:09 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely beautiful. Watching the video, I smiled along with you out of pure empathy. It is so incredible seeing and nearly feeling what you did. I once enjoyed a dose of LSD with a trip guider and it instilled a new sense of perspective within me. I can tell you that what I experienced did humble me and from my point of view, it seems similar. Have you tried LSD before? If so, could you compare it in anyway to DMT? Also, thank you for your description of it as well. Very detailed!"
DMT,2zvvfy,OfficialYoungNitro,2,Wed Mar 25 20:23:21 2015 UTC,"I have a full trip report here. I've done lsd a handful of times. What I will say, dmt has some of the feelings of lsd in it, along with everything else. Dmt is basically all encompassing, and at the end of it the closest I've felt to being that great goes to MDMA, or Psilocybin, though they pale in comparison. Having used the ""psychedelic users starter kit""; I've used LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA, and a very small dose of Aminita Muscaria as well as Cannabis of course. Even insufflating a point of MDMA is a puddle to an ocean compared to the rush of DMT. What I can say from my experiences having dabbled just a bit in these other chemicals is that DMT is a whole DIFFERENT beast. I would describe it as all these chemicals in one beautiful collaboration. The introspection from LSD, the seratogenic yet dissaciative qualities of Psilocybin, the sheer bliss of MDMA, but much, much stronger than all of them. It's quite fucking intense. I have so much more respect for it after trying that smallish dose and being completely bewildered. The most similar aspect I could compare it to LSD is at the end of the video. The comedown phase where you kind of realize your body exists again and notice the visuals is so organic and beautiful. It was multitudes more intense than even the strongest LSD visuals I've had though, which weren't all that intense to begin with."
DMT,2zvvfy,OfficialYoungNitro,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"That was an incredibly descriptive report.  Regarding your anxieties, may I ask if you feel ""cured"" in anyway? The experience itself is incredible, but I feel as a person who has used LSD once and then Mescaline/Psylocybin/MDMA another time (separate incidents) that the takeaway and application is just as important. What do you feel you have learned from DMT?"
DMT,2zthj8,veptavis,8,Sat Mar 21 16:50:48 2015 UTC,"Don't try to analyze your experience while you're tripping. Just observe. No matter how astonishing it gets, keep in mind it'll always be over in about 10 min; so embrace the experience. Just let go and observe."
DMT,2zthj8,luckyearthling,4,Sat Mar 21 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"I saw gods... Or perhaps an infinite, singular god.   This resonated with me. I read a comment in another post about pantheism and after looking into the definition have come to the conclusion that it describes my spiritual beliefs rather well.   In response to your concluding question though, the best thing you can do is prepare an environment for yourself that is comfortable and safe.   I find chill, instrumental music played at low volume to be very comforting so I will make sure that the groove salad station on soma FM is playing before I blast off. I've found lyrics become very bizarre in hyperspace so I try to stay away from most vocals.   A few times I've gotten very cold when tripping so I also be sure to have a blanket nearby. Wrapping myself up in said blanket can be very interesting in the DMT space too so, you know, win win.   The easier the ROA, the more relaxed you will feel. I've found DMT Enhanced Leaf to be the most straightforward way of administering the stuff. I just pack a bowl of spice-infused mullein and blasting off is as easy as getting a little stoned. Although preparing the e-leaf takes a bit of patience, IMO it is much easier than dealing with the machine or your 2-liter method, let me tell you.  Remember, you'll be back to normal in 15 minutes so there's no need to worry. Anything you see there can have no physical effect on you in this dimension. We all get pre-flight jitters. We just have to be brave and press on if exploring that realm is what we really want to do!"

DMT,2zthj8,RedSteppa,1 point,Sun Mar 22 11:34:29 2015 UTC,to calm yourself try smoking a small dose first. 10mg. Or try smoking an maoi like b cappi. Both take the edge off and build up your boldness.
DMT,2zt38j,hamletmaschine,5,Sat Mar 21 14:33:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say if you are looking for a breakthrough experience ~125mg is what you are looking at. But also if you are trying to breakthrough it's just as important to let go.  I'd say 5 minutes after insufflating it's starts to hit you like a ton of bricks, and then 30-40 minutes after that you should be back to baseline.   The pain from insufflating is kinda shitty and mostly likely mucus will be dumping from your nose afterwards, so maybe use some Afrin Nasal Spray or something beforehand  As for advice, all you can really do is go with the experience. Trying to fight it never ends well, once it's up your nose, it's time to surrender. Enjoy!"
DMT,2zt38j,DahveN,5,Sat Mar 21 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I did it. Railed about 100 mg, in 4 lines. The pain wasn't so bad, it burns, but it's not unbearable. I tried to resist sniffling. Lied down on the couch. Started to shiver,  felt very cold. Familiar patterns appeared on the wall- somewhat Mayan, green, yellow. Closed eyed visuals were much more intense, similar to shrooms, infinitely complex structures in an intricate shade of purple. I expected to break through, but instead I remained in stable and quite lucid introspective mood. Maybe I didn't break through because I expected too much, felt nervous and scared beforehand, having read all these crazy DMT reports. Overall, it was  a calm experience,  I realized I need to  keep working on stable habits, waking up early, meditating, reading, running, etc. The point is that  things should become effortless. There is this WAY that I discern in the foggy distance, this METHOD that should be perfected, based on shedding all false expectation, being grounded in the present, perceptive and balanced. All will be revealed in time, I am certain. Lasted about 30 minutes. Feeling good, relaxed after. I don't think I will snort it next time, thinking about getting some MAOI like Moclobemide ( Aurorix) and parachuting it, pharmahuasca style."

I'm very susceptible to hallucinogens though, so you might want to take more to be sure of a breakthrough. Sub breakthroughs tend to be marred by a deep burn in the nasal cavity, IMO."
DMT,2zt38j,CluelessNoodles,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:41:31 2015 UTC,Do you have more time to go into your susceptibility to hallucinogens and why you think it may be? And could you define that? I too have a lower overall tolerance and find myself a bit further out than others at times.

DMT,2zt38j,smokinjoe65,3,Wed Mar 25 20:47:22 2015 UTC,"Snorting will yield wildly different results from person to person. I break through on 65-75mg but normally do 40-50mg for good sub-breakthrough headspace (perfect for deep thought, recalling memories and dreams, etc. plus good CEVs). Pain is the hurdle for most. I've no problem working with it and putting it aside but others claim it's excruciating.  One good tip I can give is to resist sniffling when you settle down. Sniffling will only move the DMT into your throat, which is a waste and it tastes like Satan jizzing hellfire down your throat. Excessive drip may be the reason some need more powder to break through, as well."

If that were true then DMT would not have an effect on non-human animals.  I don't have any study links handy but I bet injecting a Chimp with DMT would produce a similar physiological response.  We can't judge their mental effects but I would bet it would be similar at least in non-human primates.  I believe Dave Nichols has done a bit of DMT testing in mice and it was quite active.

I am not arguing effects, im arguing classification. The reason many noobs get scared from their first time smoking it for example is the simple reason that they get a ""bad trip"" and expect that to happen every time because all their drug experience comes from drugs that give the same effect each time, which hallucinogens dont. Also if you do not get a mild trip from smoking cannabis you are clearly smoking too much and should stop abusing it until it gives you a proper drug effect again, why use a drug so much that it does not give the intended effects anymore? Thats being smart about your drug use, not a pussy, and calling people who are smart about their drug use and do not abuse their drugs pussies is just plain ignorant and harmful to society."

No go enjoy your misconceptions about substances you clearly know nothing about.  Now that thats over with, I just noted that weed is a hallucinogen to enlighten him to the fact to update his perception of the substance, which in turn might make it more enjoyable seeing that most hallucinogens work off the users mindset, which also includes what you think of the drug. You see, your expectations, which might be altered by gaining knowledge, has an effect on the drug experience.

I don't think you need any prior experience because if you successfully break though, I can't imagine anything would prepare you for the experience.  I don't agree or disagree with the age thing. I believe that DMT will call to you when you are ready to go on that journey and if your age is preventing you from the trip, it might not be calling.  DMT has been one of the most profound additions to my life. If you are looking for answers to some questions it might give you answers but it might bring up a lot of other questions as well.

DMT,2zllup,BrendanDlay,3,Fri Mar 20 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot and lot and a lot of psychoactives, and I've gotta say that in my experience, DMT was the most mind-rending, yet least taxing experience.  I stopped taking psychedelic tryptamines about a year ago, with the sole exception being DMT.  Mostly, it remains the exception for the duration, but also because the onset is so terrific that it does not leave you in what I like to call the 'questioning phase' of psychedelics.   i.e. do I feel it, is that it?  do I feel it yet? well what's different?  and before you know it, you've wasted an otherwise pleasant onset by stressing questions like if you've taken enough, or too little, or if you're even ready for the experience.  With DMT there's literally no time to meander on any of those questions, and the only question I've ever found myself clinging to is ""am I ready to let go?""    Because I've smoked a lot of DMT, and I know whats coming when I start to feel that otherworldly pull on my ego.   Honestly, I like to hit the point right before ego death, and I can still be 'me' while also enjoying infinitely disseminating fractals, and dudes from other dimensions talking to me.   But the FIRST time I ever smoked it, I had no idea what was about to be coming on, I'd done a bunch of LSD, probably some mushrooms, and a couple MDxx's, so when my friend said, ""this is a psychedelic, it's fun, here's how you smoke it.""  I was on board, and there wasn't really any fear of ego dissolution.  Because I had NO idea it was coming.    But I think it's important to stress that I went into the experience with NO expectations.  Which is the best way to smoke it.  My only expectation was 'this is probably going to be fun'  and it was!  I sat on a Fatboy (super comfy styrofoam beanbag chair) and watched a lighting storm fractalize in super-slow motion across everything I could see.  Not really a breakthrough, but I smoked it to have fun and it was.    Idk, I hope that helps.   But as for comparison, nothing is REALLY chemically similar to DMT, (save for AMT or the sort) with things like DOC and 2CB you can kind of expect the similarities between them, as they are chemically similar.  But DMT really stands on it's own (throne).  There's not much you can do to prepare other than to eat right, clear your mind, and GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFOREHAND.    I shit you not (no pun intended) I have pissed my pants during a breakthrough, and then entities talked to me about it.    You probably won't get the answers you're looking for.  DMT is a wily chemical, and not subject to your whims.  I don't know of anyone personally or otherwise who has gone into a trip with questions on their mind, and had those questions answered.  Rather, it's been in my experience and often theirs, that your questions don't ever get an answer, they just become deeper questions.    hope you try it, it's lots of fun.  Peace!"

Those approaches differ in which marterials they use to reach the goal. There are even completly food-safe teks.    Is there a safe alternative?   If you want to be 100% sure, then the answer must be: No.  The only one that comes to my mind if you don't do it yourself, would be to find someone who extracts it himself.   You can for sure buy some over the net. But how can you be sure that it is safe, if you didn't make it yourself or sent it to a lab analyses?  Pro-Tip: You can't."

Because seriously that's all the time and effort extracting this shit takes. It takes more work and danger ordering off the DNM's anyways. Setting up special emails, encrypting PGP messages, acquiring bitcoin, transferring funds and having shit sent to a safe place and hoping all pans out. And that's just doing the bare minimum. You seriously have to add a few ingredients together and voila... DMT."

I hate it when people refer to clandestine purchases as ""off the street.""  If you know your way around, and make your purchases through family, it's easily the safest option there is.   That being said, what you're asking is entirely moot.  I can understand (sympathize, even) being in the position where you can't extract, or purchase from DNM's, but what are you asking?    Yes, I get it from people 'off the street' (ugh, but they have houses!)  but I'm not gonna tell you who those people are, nor is anyone else here.......  You've gotta make your own connections, really, is the only advice anyone here will give you.

Luckily I got my goods in time though before everything shut-down. The dark-net is a risky place however, so just be wary.   Also, if you do happen to find some, take it with MAOI's as well (Syrian Rue is perhaps the best). This will let you simply eat the DMT instead of trying to smoke it, which can be extremely difficult. The MAOI will also make the trip more intense without making it longer. Good luck on your quest!"

DMT,2zck2h,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:02:07 2015 UTC,Get some sodium carbonate (not baking soda). It goes by washing powder in some areas. Create a 5% by volume solution.  Use a dropper to add a few mL to the jar before you freeze. Swirl/mix then remove the solution from the jar with dropper. Repeat this wash step until the solution remains clear after mixing.

DMT,2zck2h,dirtrox44,3,Tue Mar 17 23:09:28 2015 UTC,Essentially we are 'washing' away any excess sodium hydroxide that may have contaminated the solution by converting it to water and dissolved ion in aqueous solution.  Here is what's going on chemically: CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3 H2CO3 + NAOH -> NaHCO3 + H2O NaHCO3 + NaOH -> Na2CO3 + H2O

DMT,2zck2h,dude_with_amnesia,3,Tue Mar 17 14:36:12 2015 UTC,"Lye actually vaporizes at 1400 degrees Celsius so vaporizing it or smoking it shouldn't be a problem.

The noises were completely bullshit and the predominantly red hue seems more aimed at giving a creepy vibe than anything else. It would also be WAY quicker movement through the geometric visuals. They really put effort into try to make this seem legit, but it's not very accurate from my own experiences.  Seems like a creative way to demonstrate a fictional creepy trip someone thinks would be like DMT. If DMT was really like this there's no way I would have cared about it."

DMT,2zb08i,EvolutionTheory,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:19:02 2015 UTC,"It's not accurate at all. DMT isn't snake-like and would be heavily geometric, that's the problem with this simulation. The only accuracy is in the lighting of the pipe. The sounds were completely fake and do not exist in DMT trips, the visuals may exist in deep trips but would be colorful and geometric.  Again, this isn't at all like a DMT trip, whether it's a light dose or heavy. The production value may be what makes this seem like a ""Good effort""."
DMT,2zb08i,EvolutionTheory,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:24:31 2015 UTC,"I have no way of knowing how experienced you are in tripping, but these seem like totally possible visuals to me. Even though the chemical itself is the same person to person, the brain it's acting upon is not."
DMT,2zb08i,EvolutionTheory,2,Tue Mar 17 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"With DMT, only a few dozen experiences. My assumption has been from personal conversations, books, and online posts the same geometric characteristics I experience are fairly uniform across the board.  Especially for initial visuals, when you first begin observing something the geometry seems strongest before shifting into actual ""visions"". Within the visions of breakthroughs I agree there are non-geometrical experiences, but I've considered the geometry a staple, even if only in the beginning, of the DMT experience.  We really shouldn't dismiss the fake sounds added into this video either. As audio is a significant part of any experience. DMT is noticeably lacking this type of audio as demonstrated in the video. In fact, the only noticeable audio I've ever even discussed with anyone and haven't personally experienced is the growing and eventually overwhelming hum before breakthrough.  My motivation behind such criticism is to help those earnestly interested to avoid misinformation. DMT isn't creepy like I think this video is clearly trying to portray it, granted that may be an overall theme of the movie's storyline. DMT also isn't as boring or trivial as this seems. If anything, the video is like taking Salvia, and not at all like DMT.  Have you experienced Salvia?"

I'd consider it a niche psychedelic compound that not too many know about."
DMT,2zanx1,smokinjoe65,2,Tue Mar 17 04:26:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure how snorting it would change the deal, though I've only smoked it and only had one powerful trip.  I happened to hear about DMT from my roommate who I knew tripped acid a good deal and he said he was a bit scared of DMT. I did my research and when my regular dealer came into some dreamtime I hopped at the chance.  My paranoia was more a perceived paranoia than an actual one, if that makes sense, and I'll explain what I mean. On acid if I start moving toward a bad trip it's like I'm freaking out about upcoming homework or something I've forgotten to do, or something equally inconsequential but seemingly very important at the time. On DMT it was that I noticed a purple-shift to my vision and started to worry that was indicative of a bad trip, because in movies that color scheme often indicates bad things. I also felt a bit like I was peeing myself, but that was separate.  Once I overcame the rapidness of the come-up those feelings of peeing myself disappeared, as did the paranoia. It left a great trip behind! :)"

DMT,2zanx1,needan_accounttopost,2,Wed Mar 18 12:18:15 2015 UTC,"DMT is endogenous to the brain, and is pretty damn safe toxicologically speaking. As far as mental health, I'm not so sure. You only hear about the beautiful trips, and I'd be quote surprised if nobody has ever had a bad trip on DMT.   If you've never experienced any psychedelics DMT will be very novel and extreme. It is the ever clear of psychedelics and leaves weed looking like beer.   You will probably not be able to find it. It's not popular nor addictive, and at least where I live barely anyone has ever heard of it nonetheless creating a demand large enough that anyone will supply.   If you do come across it, take it in a setting that is agreeable to psychedelics. Unlike LSD, which morphs reality to the point people sometimes do crazy things, DMT creates an entirely new reality that is disconnected from the physical world. About your paranoia, I'm not sure. Be sure you're in a safe and relaxed place because you do not want to waste such an experience on being worried.   Remember this isn't a drug in the classical sense. People dont take a hit of DMT then hit the clubs. Every dose is an experience within itself, and many people are satisfied with one deep experience.   In its form on the street, DMT is almost always a powder which can be vaporized. DMT has its heyday in Ayahuasca, a brew of plants used by many tribes in parts of South America. I highly recommend reading up on it, but it also has an MAOI which increases the potency and duration of the trip immensely. Vaporizing DMT found on the street is a taste of the full experience, and if you really really want the full experience, I'd recommend going on an expensive but often worthwhile healing retreat in South America. DMT lends itself well to spirituality.   I hope this answered a couple of your questions."
DMT,2zanx1,hypopotamus,3,Tue Mar 17 01:06:27 2015 UTC,"Whats true for other hallucinogens, in terms of bad trips, is true for DMT to less of an extent IMO.

His experiences were best described as intoxication, or feeling peculiar, instead of the full shebang. That was the 70s, however. The case may be that the commercialization of the ayahuasca experience as of late will give you what you're looking for, if youre a paying customer and you find someone who can actually make a good brew (which is rare, according to McKenna)."
DMT,2zanx1,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:35:37 2015 UTC,again though he said that a long time ago before ayahuasca became such a tourist draw. I'm pretty sure it's much easier to find someone who can make a good brew now than it was back then.

If your serious about it I doubt you'll find it on the streets or from your friends. Probably need to do an extraction. A few days and maybe a couple hundo and your there. I get a little paranoid during my trips but it's all in good fun. I'm able to separate the experiences from reality which is important. Small doses are less satisfying being intense but not too visual. Heavy doses bring on the crazy visuals and there's no paranoia. There's nothing but astonishment.

It's forgiving... meaning if you accidentally smoke a little too much you'll make it through but that doesn't make it safe.   Also, it's abundant. Idk why people make it seem like such a rarity. I remember like 8 years ago, in highschool I heard about it on YouTube watching Terrence McKenna videos... so I asked around and it was readily available. Not in prices I was willing to pay... but it was there from multiple sources. Knowing this isn't the case for most. Let me elaborate. The information for obtaining this chemical is everywhere.

It's not always about something coming to find you. It's more about you being ready and not pulling the DMT trigger prematurely.   Also, when people give DMT and other entheogenic substances a sort of personality, it's because people do believe in the magic behind existence and how powerful the DMT flash is. It is equally frustrating to us to hear people say, ""it's all brain chemistry... it's just a drug... there's nothing special behind it..."" when we ""know"" otherwise.

DMT,2zbjp6,MrRawrgers,2,Tue Mar 17 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"with a fixed voltage battery like that you want to make sure you're tank is over 1.6ohms in resistance, I would recommend a nautilus as you can get the coils in 1.6 or 1.8 and you would definitely get enough vape to experience a DMT high."
DMT,2zbjp6,MrRawrgers,0,Tue Mar 17 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"Why does the resistance make such a difference, with a small variation in ohms?"
DMT,2zbjp6,MrRawrgers,2,Tue Mar 17 23:28:14 2015 UTC,"Well with a 1.6ohm coil you would get around 12.5Watts through your tank which with a nautilus or any other standard tank is pretty much the max of what you want to put through it, any lower than 1.6 and your wattage will increase and you will burn your liquid.  you can get batteries that have adjustable voltages but around 12Watts is ideal for decent vapour.  Vaping is an expensive hobby and you can't really put DMT into a basic mod and get good results.  Here's a pic of the mod i put DMT into."
DMT,2zbjp6,suburbanite09,0,Tue Mar 17 23:35:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know what type of cartomizer I have, except for the 1.6ml label on the sides, as this was a gift. I doubt it's a very expensive cartridge, possibly a CE4 from the pictures I've seen. So besides having to find a multimeter to find the resistance of the tank, I would then be putting 4.5V through the tank with the mod battery I found. If we can assume this is a standard low-resistance cartridge of 1.8 ohms(let's hope), this gives me about the 12.5W you mentioned. Fingers crossed for this weekend!"
DMT,2zbjp6,MrRawrgers,2,Tue Mar 17 23:55:31 2015 UTC,"I'm 90% sure those tanks will die if 4.5v is put through them, you'd want to spend around $20+ on a tank if you'd want it to be able to cope. I'm not sure about the details but 12.5Watts in a tank like that would vape all of the liquid super quick and it would not be able to rewick new liquid fast enough and the wick would burn instantly."

You basically infuse your freebase onto smokeable herbs and with changa, add an MAOI to potentiate the trip. MAOIs can have a dangerous, even lethal effect when combined with certain foods/meds so be careful there. You can also injest orally but this requires an MAOI. Google pharmahuasca for more info on this method. Again, be very careful when taking MAOIs. Safe travels!"

DMT,2z5e4p,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Sat Mar 21 11:19:32 2015 UTC,I googled this and was slightly confused. What are you getting at?
DMT,2z5e4p,BrendanDlay,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"nootropics.  I think I've talked about it on here before. Glutamate is the carrier protein responsible for recycling neurotransmitters from their respective receptors back into the synapses (to be metabolized).  If you agonize it, it increases the rate and efficacy that receptors receive neurotransmitters in the synapse.     my analogy for this is that if you imagine a 'drug' working in your brain as a tidal wave of 'keys' (neurotransmitters) and your receptors as a giant net of 'locks' (receptors) a glutamate agonist mildly-madly increases the size of that net and the efficiency of the locks, to better handle that tidal wave, so that fewer neurotransmitters end up not making it to a receptor before MAO metabolizes them into whatever."
DMT,2z5e4p,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:29:09 2015 UTC,Interesting. Does this potentiate the trip or just intensify it? I've always been interested in nootropics but have not been super encouraged by experience reports I've read. Seems like there's a lot of snake oil to sift through in order to find something worthwhile.
DMT,2z5e4p,BrendanDlay,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:54:51 2015 UTC,"dude, it's crazy, I wouldn't have believed it if someone had just told me how ridiculously turbo-charged it makes things.  As a potentiator, it amplifies the effects of EVERY neurotransmitter.  So like, coffee, CHOCOLATE (ever eat so much chocolate that you feel a dopamine rush?)    Piracitam is the most basic and accessible, but honestly it tastes like shit.     Phenylpiracitam is a THOUSAND times stronger than piracitam.  I ate 30mg of it and then smoked like a puff or so out of a chillum of shitty weed and almost had a panic attack because of how hard it hit me.   I put a 'rock'  (it crumbles into little balls) in my hand and dropped acid on it and I've never had more complicated visuals in my life.  Acid I'd done a lot of many times that week.  Basically it sets your tolerance to less than zero.   It works on pretty much everything, I wouldn't take it with ketamine or downers.     But seeing as how insane that acid trip was, (9 hours floored, blacked out 3, didn't matter whether my eyes were open or closed)  I can't even begin to imagine how nonsensically potent a DMT trip would be.   Some chick I used to hang out with ate like 4 doses of phenyl because she's insane, and then smoked DMT and was conked in lala land for 30 fucking minutes.  But she was irresponsibly on a bunch of shit, and also just the kind of person that zones out so hard that you could punch her in the face and she wouldn't know what was happening.   I'd love to hear/ maybeifIgrewapair try to prep a breakthrough with phenyl.     the best part?  It's dirt dirt cheap in bulk and kicks in in less than 40 seconds.   Nootropicsdepot DOT com <<<  There are lots of other nootropics, I've tried a bunch of them, but phenyl is definitely the bang for your buck substance.   also, you can't overdose on any of them but phenyl, (and that would be a damn sight)   I did a 6-gram of aniracitam to prove it was humanly possible.  I also make bad choices.   and now that i remember it, it was after that line that I smoked the chillum and started tripping.    it was with that crazy chick too.  Damn my memory sucks.  Ah, but most nootropics also agonize NMDA which is the neurotransmitter responsible for memory, so.... I guess I should do some, huh?"
DMT,2z5e4p,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Sat Mar 21 19:39:06 2015 UTC,What is the difference between phenylpiracetam and aniracitam?
DMT,2z5e4p,BrendanDlay,2,Sun Mar 22 01:06:50 2015 UTC,"mostly potency and like the (consistency?) of the powder itself. Like piracitam is a white powder that is quite fine, it doesn't really cling to itself that well (kind of looks like good K, burns slightly worse to sniff)  and it has a foul taste.  Not like a burning one like MDxx, but literally just nasty, like a tongueful of stagnant water.   I only mention piracitam because it's the standard to which all the other racemics are judged, i.e. X times stronger than piracetam.  <I'm never gonna spell it right...>     anyways, aniracitam is very floury, and doesn't have a taste, but imagine trying to eat a spoonfull of flour, dries out your mouth and you can't even swallow.  But insufflation, it goes RIGHT up in there, with no resistance.  If you like snorting things, it's awesome because you can put away an indefinite amount.   I think it's somewhere around the tune of 60-80 times stronger than piracitam  Phenyl is 1000 times stronger than piracitam.  The dose for piracitam is a gram.   for phenyl it's like  50mg.      There's also Phenibut, which works with GABA and so can potentiate benzo's, from what I've seen over on /r/nootropics, it's all the rage.    And there's also Noopept, which supposedly is stronger than phenyl.  provided I'm talking about the same thing I took this one night that I ate 220~ish mg of stupendously powerful MDA and washed it back with a triple cap of noopept.  I had hallucinations that were TOUCHING me, scary as fuck.  I had to will them into non-existence.    there's also a couple experimental nootropics I've heard my chemist friends mention that are just all technical names.  (I think noopept is GBS-1-11-something, they sell it OTC in Russia, fun fact) but I've heard of one that's like 10,000 times stronger than phenylpiracitam and lasts for 30 hours.   Lol, fucking chemists.    but as far as information goes, I can't offer any statistics, but wikipedia is packed.  most iterations of nootropics slligthly affect other neurotransmitters, but just always be on the look-out for two things when purchasing.  1) increases communication between the hemispheres.  2) potentiates glutamate."

I tried setting the mood, put on a Hindu mantra. For them to listen to. One of them took it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Gain an understanding beyond anything we could learn on this plane. The other resisted. He wasn't prepared, or was emotional unwilling to accept what he was experiencing. He didn't give it the respect it deserves, despite me putting on the mantra and and lighting incense etc. DMT is not for the faint of heart.

DMT,2yzds1,DarkMatterTraveller,2,Sat Mar 14 02:53:26 2015 UTC,"I use a version of cyb's tek with 50g batches for great results. One thing that may be misleading about Johnny Ayahuasca is that his eyeballing is much more accurate than someone who hasn't done extractions as much as he has. Invest in a kitchen scale in order to minimize variation from batch to batch. Knowing exact values helps root out causes to problems that may arise. Also, one thing I don't agree with is his use of cold naphtha. The saturation point of naphtha increases with temperature, so the warmer your naphtha is, the more available bond sites for DMT to attach to. I keep my mix in a 125Â°F heat bath during mixing steps and during the solvent steps to help out with this. For safety, though, I use a big pyrex flask so I don't have to worry about my extraction vessel breaking.   Attention to detail and patience are very important when it comes to successful kitchen chemistry. Good luck, have fun and be safe! Eye protection and gloves are highly recommended."
DMT,2yzds1,smokinjoe65,2,Sat Mar 14 03:30:16 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to try 50g with Cyb's tek, 50g w/ Johnny Ayahuasca and maybe the other 100g with the ""newbie friendly tek with pics"" on the nexus.  I'm more nervous about using the heat baths than any other aspect of the teks, which is why Johnny A's looks more appealing.  I do have a question, when I'm reading Cyb's tek, it says ""salt has been proven effective with ACRB, just add at basification stage"", but I'm interpreting that as adding salt twice? Am I wrong in that?  Also, for my main vessel, some people use glass, some people use plastic. Is one better than the other? Does it need to be a small mouth neck/lid? I've got a 2L pickle jar that I was thinking of using, but it's quite big. I'm in the US, not a lot of 1L glass jugs out there."
DMT,2yzds1,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:28:26 2015 UTC,"I like your strategy. You'll learn a lot using different techniques. You don't need to heat your mix. It's just something I do to keep everything uniform during the process. Regarding salt, this will be used once, right before adding your lye solution.   Your pickle jar will be fine. Glass is better than plastic because certain plastics bleed foreign chemicals when you heat them (the lye addition will make the temp go up quite a bit ). Most prefer a smaller necked vessel because it's easier to distinguish between separation layers when you do a pull. The wider the vessel, the thinner the layer of solvent. This may make it difficult to avoid sucking up basified mixture during your pulls. If you find it difficult to avoid sucking up basified crap, dont be afraid to pull out your solvent and place it into a smaller, thinner glass object (I use a small graduated cylinder), allowing it to settle and separate again,  making it way easier to get right up to the separation interface. Then you can dump the crap back into your main vessel for the next pull. Also, my flask is 2L as well so you're okay. You wouldn't want to go too small because sloshing high pH solutions around can be dangerous if it comes out the top."

Stick to two hits maximum.  If you feel that you're ready to try DMT, try it. I don't think that there's a certain time that you just become ready for DMT. It's more like the longer you wait and more psychedelic experience you have, you will be slightly more adept at handling the mind-fuck that is DMT.   It's always a mind-fuck though (in a good way)."

I'm not good with weight measurements, but I'm fairly certain 30mg won't be enough to truly break through unless you're already on some other psychedelic. It will still be a trip, however."

The minutes leading up to trying feel like you strapped into a roller coaster riding the rail up and up. Once I take it, the roller coaster drops and I am sent it.  What I'm saying is that despite doing it as many times as I have, I'm never really ""prepared"". You never know what you'll find one the other side, but whatever it is it will be unbelievable and very intense. To be ""ready"" to accept DMT, you have to understand that this isn't a drug in the way that acid is, it is a gateway to another realm and you should approach it as such. Be in a safe place. My advice for music is to put on headphones and listen to Tibetan throat singing.  It is sure to change your opinion on reality. I broke through my first time, and it changed my life forever. I felt unbelievable love and happiness while there and took it with me when I left.  Enjoy it. Embrace it. And learn from it. If you remain open, it will be the most profound experience of you life."
DMT,2ywsci,Imgodnigga,-1,Tue Mar 17 21:53:00 2015 UTC,With such a small amount you will end up wasting it because it's so hard to smoke/vaporize whatever. Try to get more to experiment with or snort it.

DMT,2ywsci,Imgodnigga,2,Fri Mar 13 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, snorting would be the easiest, most sure-fire way of feeling legitimate effects. My experience suggests snorting all 60mgs and then if you like what you feel, look into extracting yourself. You could vape half that amount and if you do it correctly, you could achieve similar, albeit shorter duration results. The only trouble with vaping is it can be difficult to achieve optimal effects on your first attempts. Better to try vaping if you've got a ready supply, as you would after a successful extraction."
DMT,2ywsci,dmtpsychonaut,1 point,Sat Mar 14 00:06:13 2015 UTC,Go for it! Maybe have the person you're buying from help you smoke it? Worst case scenario you don't breakthrough and reach a sub-breakthrough point which are still equally as cool!

DMT,2yvix4,craigdead,8,Fri Mar 13 03:52:32 2015 UTC,"It was a massively introspective experience for me. I was able to view life (not just mine but in general) from the perspective of a man who has seen it all plenty of times.   I have a theory that smoking DMT brings your conscious observable experience 'out' of the physical reality we call 'real life' and into the reality of unity consciousness. This is sometimes referred as 'the all' in hermetic terms.  The universe is more than just what our fleshy water bone bags can interpret through our limited senses.   Speaking of hermeticism, the emerald tablets and the kybalion will prepare you for the knowledge you gain and will perhaps shed some light on the phenomenon that is DMT.  DMT has shown me that I am a small part of a whole, but that I am the part, and the whole(the all) at the same time. Our human experience is a limited one, but with plenty more to come after this life once we go back to 'the all'."

As I was put back into my body after travelling to the extra dimensional world that this is in, they spoke to me without words that I ""needed to love people more"". I have tried it multiple times since then, and ""love"" is a recurring theme with me. About half the time I get messages of loving myself and others.  As far as life changing, for me I have learned what it means to love. I was giving guidance in a way never though possible. In addition, I went from agnostic to spiritual (not religious) in a heartbeat. I began meditation almost everyday and still do (after 2+ years).  Unlike other psychelics, there is a very very slim chance you will have any sort of negative experience as long as you are willing to accept it and let go. Treat it as an opportunity to learn and grow, vs trip out."
DMT,2yvix4,Babagan00sher,2,Tue Mar 17 22:04:12 2015 UTC,"These comments are helpful but lacking in perspective. There is no evidence thus far that DMT is neurotoxic, and there's not likely ever going to be any given our understanding of the mechanisms at play. So like taking Tylenol or having a beer, it is NOT going to alter you physiologically in any measurable way.  Psychologically, it is unlike anything else one can experience in life, and that's pretty much all there is to it.   The same characterization can be made for a plethora of experiences like scuba diving, riding a roller coaster, or taking an astronomy class. These experiences are unique and may shift your perspective here or there. You may discover an interest in becoming an astrophysicist (or a psychonaut). You may find it uncomfortable and don't want to do it again. But it's not going to magically change you or take you in a life direction you're not willing to go.  I have experienced many things in life -  flown a glider through the clouds with an eagle at my wingtip, witnessed the space shuttle launch, skydived over St Petersburg Russia, done half a dozen psychedelics many dozens of times, etc and trust me when I say that all of these experiences have had the capacity to influence my life and be a watershed moment. Those who say ""DMT changed me forever"" may be right, but those same people, if they are honest, will say the same for that one time they got food poisoning and never will eat shitty Asian food again, or met the love of their life, or whatever.   DMT is unique, and one hell of a ride. But so are many things in life. Just look at it like a new experience that may (or may not) teach you something worthwhile."
DMT,2yvix4,dwarfed,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:21:18 2015 UTC,"For me it was just a really fast way to get to know ""myself"" better. I definitely feel like my conscious and my sub-conscious are one now. Since dmt is often times just a mirror of yourself (it's up to you how to interpret your experience and how to react to it). It's just a great feeling to go about my life knowing what I am and what I want. It really was life changing."

DMT,2ywsel,SearchingForAnAnswer,3,Fri Mar 13 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"If you're not in a hurry it never hurts to keep it in the freezer for a few days. I do 48 hours for my dishes and there's still DMT on the bottom of my recovered naphtha storage jar.   Are you keeping the solvent? I recommend this because you'll probably have DMT free-floating in it. If you're keeping it, you can pour off the excess and let the dishes air-dry thoroughly before scraping. Tip them on their sides and see if you can get a relatively empty section of the dish toward the bottom so the Naphtha that's left over won't drip across/onto your crystals. A gentle fan blowing over your dishes helps. Also, when it seems dry and it doesn't smell like solvent, chop up the crystal formations and let it dry more. Solvent can become stuck in the crystal structure.  A pull can be two things, but it's usually a blanket term for the process of adding solvent to recover DMT. A pull can also be the part where you're ""pulling"" off the solvent with your baster or eyedropper."

My question if anyone is willing to answer is if I can just take the naphtha from my pulls and just go straight to evaporation with it while doing additional pulls using fresh naptha. I know I will end up with some goo like alkaloids so I'm thinking I will whip the product to try and homogenize the alkaloids throughout the spice

This is essentially a hand held vaporizer. They are usually a buck or two and really easy to use and the perfect method of smoking dmt.

My first time with DMT was with this method and it was the strongest experience of all but all of the experiences weren't strong and I've done up to 40mg doses. Using an oil burner just doesn't work for me cause I just can't get it to vaporise fully in a short amount of time.  I'm kind of starting to get frustrated and I'm thinking that my DMT might have lost potency, but how could that be? It's been stored airtight in a dark, cold environment."
DMT,2yqp65,Imgodnigga,7,Thu Mar 12 00:35:54 2015 UTC,"When I heard the learnâd astronomer, When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them, When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, Till rising and gliding out I wanderâd off by myself, In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, Lookâd up in perfect silence at the stars. -W. Whitman  This poem was the first thing that came to mind when I read this post. Our logical method of observing experiences paired with our need to ""understand"" sometimes clouds the inherent magic at work behind things such as DMT.   Perhaps we should accept the DMT experience as something we just can't understand quite yet. Even when we do understand it, wouldn't it be better if we kept the mystical aspect of it intact? Maybe the very gift that it grants us is a break from our logical selves... a taste of pure, unfiltered experience that should be felt emotionally instead of analytically."
DMT,2yqp65,smokinjoe65,2,Thu Mar 12 04:42:00 2015 UTC,I love it! It is sorta disappointing not viewing dmt in the same magical light I once interpreted my experiences in...
DMT,2yqp65,smokinjoe65,6,Thu Mar 12 04:51:44 2015 UTC,"All DMT users understand that perception can be shifted at will, with or without the help of a substance. Perhaps you can exercise that power and put a little bit of magic back into the experience... don't try to deconstruct what is happening because, in all actuality, we still don't know exactly what's going on when we're in that other place... :)  We are all equipped with perception filters, some given and some we develop on our own. The magical part about DMT, for me, is that those filters are stripped away. It's tough, but I try pretty damn hard to incorporate that lack of filtering in my everyday life. Open your eyes a little wider, like you used to when it was still magical, and enjoy meeting, once again, that wonderfully blissful mystery that is DMT."
DMT,2yqp65,smokinjoe65,3,Thu Mar 12 04:59:17 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you so much! The #1 reason why I like psychs so much is because of the headspace and being able to think through my life/future with no ""me"" filter and allows me to make great life choices. I'm sure I'll still be able to use dmt for this purpose. I really like what you said about trying to do that in everyday life to! Have you found anything that works specifically? For me it's just so hard because I feel like it's just something that comes with human instinct and if I could evaluate things with open eyes on a day to day basis that would be great!"
DMT,2yqp65,Pr1musSucks,3,Thu Mar 12 05:05:27 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it is that, with the intention of carrying the quality of perception I experience with DMT into the real world, I'm actually slowing down when I observe things. To put it simply, the act of trying to recreate that lack of perception inadvertently forces me to take my time and observe things I'd otherwise look over. Our brains are WONDERFULLY efficient when it comes to filling in the gaps of our perception. This is what I'm trying to overcome, without going so far as to cloud my mind with excess sensory input.   I've always been a fan of memory recall as a form of exercise and entertainment, so I meditate on random memories from my daily life. I'll walk through the grocery store in my mind or eat dinner at the tavern in my mind, reproducing the experience as accurately as possible to see how much information I can remember. With a bit of effort and practice, I've acquired the skill to recreate these experiences as if I were there again (to a degree... I don't have a purely videographic memory...). You'd be surprised at how much information you can remember simply by placing yourself back into a memory and ""looking around"" as if you were there again. It's a great way to keep sharp.  The key for me is being interested and observant. This, I feel, is turning me into a person who is more present, which isn't what I used to be.  I'm more than sure you can rekindle the magic of DMT for yourself. Even if it isn't purely magical anymore, as if you've gotten past the honeymoon phase and it's not a new thing, you can still work with it and use it as a tool to make yourself better :) If the magic isn't there anymore, look at it a different way to find new magic :)"

The fear of it turning bad stopped you from going anywhere. Just an idea"
DMT,2yqp65,Pr1musSucks,2,Thu Mar 12 01:01:43 2015 UTC,"True that. DMT is one crazy ass psychedelic!!!! What's interesting is sorting through what sort of ideas and beliefs you fall into when you take the drug. What ideas do you reflect back at yourself. What crazy insane irrational magic do you find yourself believing? I had one fucking crazy time last week at a show where I fell into the belief that I was dead and looking at reality from a 4th dimension where i could see all moments in time simultaneously. I felt a state of universal consciousness where I could feel all matter in the universe at once. This is an idea I have been talking about a lot lately and it makes sense that I created this mental experience for myself while on the drug.   In reality I was just rolling in the dirt feeling one very small patch of earth and time was still ticking away one second at a time. Now I am disappointed in myself for believing what I was feeling. I usually pride myself on my ability to entertain thoughts without fully believing and acting on them. But sometimes that hyper-reality, that feeling of being ""home"" or dead, takes over and you forget reality and fall into some very appealing magical bullshit. Magic is very entertaining to believe but it's dangerous.  Thanks for putting to words what I've been needing to remind myself. DMT is a mirror. In all likelihood there is not some alien/god/entity revealing these fractal patterns and ideas to you. If you are looking for the puppetmaster, you need only look into a mirror. You are the one pulling the mental strings, even if you don't consciously realize it.  Your post says a lot about what you ""want to be true"". Even by the end of the post, you sound as if you are disappointed that DMT is not a transport to a hidden dimension, or another universe, or to after life. I understand you. It's not as magical as the shit we can make up. You sound disappointed to find out that when you take DMT you still see this world. This world is fucking awesome!!!! It's like we're in a relationship with the Universe and we're trying desperately to cheat on the universe with our wet dreams. Closing our eyes and hallucinating another universe to run away with. If I were the universe, I would be offended at your disappointment;) Thanks for the post."

I got beat up on 5 hits of LSD by cops. This is going to sound crazy but it was a good thing it happened to me. It made me think about my future and made me put the PS3 and PS4 controller down more often and pick it up less. DMT is amazing because it shows you the truth by opening your mind. Your perception about whatever you experience is going to be amazing but it can be very good amazing or very bad amazing. If you perceive something bad change your perception by giving it more thought and say to yourself, ""Why am I even afraid of this again?"" Sometimes asking that question will make you lose fear of something."

LSD might be a better drug of choice in that example.

I'm not an ageist - but that's young for psychedelics.  Your mind, as developed as it is, is still developing.  Consider giving yourself a bit of time.  Live your life, see the good and the bad of the world that is presented to you, and then swing back to this.  Like I said - it will always be there - there's no rush."
DMT,2yr6cu,baldchow,10,Thu Mar 12 04:26:43 2015 UTC,"Permanent damage? Yes.   On a physical level you will be fine, but on a mental level there is very real possibility for damage.  Maybe not physical brain damage or some sort of of long-term 'problem' with your brain, but your perception of reality is about to be drastically changed, and it could be too much for you to handle and integrate back into your life when you come out of the trip.  Normally it isn't a huge problem but at your age integrating a DMT trip when you are not ready for it could be disastrous.  I was much older than you when I first tried DMT and I had been doing tons of psychedelics for years, and particularly the weeks leading up to trying it I had been binging on some LSD and mushrooms and still after heroic doses of those I was very shaken up and completely changed by the DMT experience.  What others have suggested is true; It will show you what you always were from the start. That sounds beautiful, because it is. That being said, you are 16 fucking years old. You is barely finished developing.   Imagine trying to give a tour of a house that is in the middle of being built. You would probably get the general idea. You could probably do it and still turn out generally okay in life. The experience itself probably won't be pleasant, but it will be a learning experience. Then again, why not just wait so you can enjoy it to its fullest/real potential?"

DMT,2yr6cu,Chemica1Brain,3,Thu Mar 12 15:05:42 2015 UTC,"I'm able to wait and willing although I've already purchased 130mg.   I don't think DMT has a short shelf life. I don't know for sure but my guess is if you researched how to properly store it, it would last you probably until you were old enough to do it. If you felt like holding on to it for that long. Remember that it's just drugs, I know it sounds lame but tossing it could be considered buying yourself a 'lesson'.    Could you explain how integrating the experience could be disastrous for me?   Well, I think I already did:   I was much older than you when I first tried DMT and I had been doing tons of psychedelics for years, and particularly the weeks leading up to trying it I had been binging on some LSD and mushrooms and still after heroic doses of those I was very shaken up and completely changed by the DMT experience.   I know that it's vague, but that's because DMT is personal. It will be that level of intensity for you, and it will be.. about you.   DMT isn't something you do for fun as a kid. DMT is something you do as an adult to ponder, reflect and improve on the life you've already lived.   doing it now wouldn't stop me from doing it again once I'm fully developed and an adult   Well duh, dude. That's not the point. The point is that your brain still has a lot of developing to do (and you will be fucking shocked at how much maturing you are about to do in the next 4 years, hopefully.) and throwing a DMT trip in there for the brain to figure out WHILE developing is just not good.  Sure, maybe you could smoke it again later, but why would you waste your first DMT experience with a drug that is completely fueled by your life experiences with only 16 years, maybe only half of them somewhat interesting or vaguely coherent, of material to use?  DMT at your age will not ruin you if you are emotionally stable, but it will shock you, it will feel like a near death experience. It will however likely affect the development of your brain severely. How so exactly, science has no clue really. There aren't many studies on teens doing DMT, and for a good reason.   There is just really no reason to do the drug at your age. You will just have a really shocking experience and I just don't see it being a great one in your circumstances."

DMT,2yr6cu,Imgodnigga,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:47:36 2015 UTC,"True that it's probably inevitable at this point... But honestly doing any sort of drug at a young age is not the best. Your brain is still in development, and drug use can hinder that. IMO, it's best to wait because there's really no rush to do an intense drug like DMT... I first heard of it was I was 15 and had been doing many drugs prior. I started to search but realized it'd be best to just see when I happened to find some out of the blue. I didn't find any until I was 18 and honestly I'm glad. I had a lot more experience with psychedelics and learned a lot (the hard way) about how to do drugs safely and I think that's what made the experience important. It's less about the drug and more about how well you know about yourself and your views. 16 isn't too bad but honestly that's the youngest I've heard of anyone trying dmt, so just make sure you know how to handle yourself with drugs and be safe and let yourself immerse in the trip.  Really don't rush into it, save it for the perfect day. Not just a random day when you're bored, that's the best advice I can give you."
DMT,2yr6cu,Imgodnigga,-1,Thu Mar 12 03:58:44 2015 UTC,"I think 16 is too young for this. Wait until youre at least 18, try acid first."

DMT,2yr6cu,smokinjoe65,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:00:16 2015 UTC,Can I ask why you want to try dmt?
DMT,2yr6cu,smokinjoe65,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:34:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not in it much for any answers or spiritual reasons. I just want to use it like I would any other psych (except only once or twice) the experience, the feeling, the profound thoughts and visuals but specifically DMT because I do want to explore what seems like other dimensions and see things that only few people have ever seen and to experience how intense and beautiful it is but I just don't want it to change me"
DMT,2yr6cu,smokinjoe65,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"It won't make you a completely different person, you will still be you, you'll just have a new experience under your belt. An experience that you have gained knowledge from, and hopefully an experience that you can appreciate. I was 15 when I first tried DMT. Looking back, I was somewhat ready, and do not regret doing it. I didn't break through that time, but it was definitely interesting. But if you aren't looking for something spiritual or any answers, I would say you probably are, you just don't realize it. Maybe you aren't looking for them out of this specific experience, but you'll most likely end up finding them anyways. My personal experience with psychedelic drugs, or rather, my outlook on psychedelic drugs, is that they help me solidify or form who I am to a certain extent. DMT, although it is different from your common psychedelics such as LSD and Shrooms, is no exception to this. I've found it has made me, more me if that makes sense. It hasn't really fucked with my personality or thought process if that is what you're worried about. Has certainly caused me to see some things in a different light, though."

DMT,2ypzkm,CaliforniaBased,3,Wed Mar 11 21:09:12 2015 UTC,For me they both deliver a feeling of peace and tranquillity for me. That's really the only thing that I see similarities in. Experiencing a breakthrough is a lot more intense than a meditation session.
DMT,2ypzkm,Imgodnigga,3,Wed Mar 11 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"I've been practicing concentration meditation and zazen for a few years and I do think there's something to this. During meditation I get 'visuals' most days - in particularly deep states, there are machine-like geometric patterns even with eyes open. I also feel the same gripping feeling in the centre of the brain during meditation as when lifting off on DMT."
DMT,2ypzkm,TetrisMcKenna,2,Thu Mar 12 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"I do DMT and meditate (to an extent) and the effects can be similar. The DMT experience is much more powerful for me, but less predictable. When I meditate in bed before going to sleep, I use the same soothing music as when I do DMT. In this meditative state I can really dive deeply into my memories and dreams, and also experience closed eye visuals to a certain degree (fractal patterns, mostly). I feel DMT has given me the ability to open myself more fully compared to the haziness I'd experience before my DMT use began."

DMT,2ypzko,Dabblin,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:15:00 2015 UTC,Cool the bulb looks fine should work. Looks like a lot of dmt will end up crystallizing on the side since it's pretty big but hey it will work! For the bulb put a little more than 50mg in around 70mg. That way it's gives you some cushion to breakthrough. You don't want to be in a situation where you don't have enough! Plus then you'll have extra for next time you breakthrough. And my tutorial can be used for your bulb should answer any more of your questions.
DMT,2ypzko,ogatec,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:50:40 2015 UTC,Use a bubbler and pile high.
DMT,2ypzko,Dabblin,0,Tue Mar 17 11:17:05 2015 UTC,"Being that DMT is dirt cheap you shouldn't worry too much but for future reference 15mg is an excessively low dose in my experience.   If you're going to smoke it on herb, use a regular pipe and use flame.  Throw like 40mg up in there and hit it til you're where you want to be.   Though I don't advise to go without a scale dmt is pretty forgiving and the speed of which it comes on gives you the chance to stop when you're getting as high as you're comfortable being."
DMT,2ym4im,throwawaybecuzofLE,4,Tue Mar 10 22:56:56 2015 UTC,"Well, according to various sites (take their validity at your own peril) hallucinogenic compounds such as dmt are A-okay whill on a SSRI. People have reported needing more of a drug to get a good trip (lsd and shrooms) but dmt wasn't mentioned so I'd start at a normal dose. Do more research... actual experts here are few and far between.  As for anxiety over actually doing dmt, that's just something you need to work with. It never really goes away, but (for me) it's part of the journey. For me, the comedown is peaceful. You'll feel more blissful than you've ever been if your comedown is anything like all of mine are. You may cry because the positive emotions are a bit overwhelming.   To get the most out of this, don't put up barriers and DON'T be fake. If there's ever a time you need to be true to yourself it's when taking dmt. It's a very powerful medicine when used correctly.   Good luck and be safe!"
DMT,2ym4im,smokinjoe65,2,Wed Mar 11 00:48:42 2015 UTC,"I can't speak much about SSRI and DMT, I think smokinjoe hit that pretty well that there's just not enough information about them.  As for anxiety..yeah its gonna hit you. I mean, you're about to consume a mind-altering drug. But that's not a bad thing. Anxiety hits the hardest just before you do something profound. As long as you don't induce a panic attack on yourself, you should be fine. I know that's easier said than done. It's actually very euphoric and relaxing afterwords."

DMT,2ym4im,PM_ME_YOUR_LSD,1 point,Wed Mar 11 08:04:31 2015 UTC,I don't get depressed after. Honestly not sure about SSRI meds.. Was diagnosed as bipolar. I don't go to any doctors and handle life pretty well relatively sober. DMT can show you beauty. Start low around 15-20 mil. Go for it!!! The best most insane visuals I ever had from any substance. Music gives more visuals and silence seems to bring out the entities. Try a nice tune try and stay away from vocals they tend to become very odd.
DMT,2ym4im,Demty,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:50:48 2015 UTC,Have you done dmt before and had a hard time taking another hit? You really just need to go for it's like jumping off a cliff with a harness on everything in your body will tell you not to but you just gotta go for it! Have you done any psychs before? How do they mix with your depression? For me after smoking dmt I get a mind fuck for the rest of the day from the experience. I just want to tell everyone what I saw and what I learned! I've never become depressed from dmt I just had to learn that dmt for me at least is a gateway into my subconscious and can help me answer any questions I have. Some people believe it's a tool to go to another world and sometimes I believe that too... Just take away from the experience what you will and make the most of it! :)
DMT,2ym4im,Imgodnigga,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:09:16 2015 UTC,I took ssri's for 4 years before I tried the deems. In my experience they wired my brain so that I wouldn't trip with as much visual intensity. After my second DMT experience I decided I felt poisoned by them and tapered off taking them. BEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! I had learned virtually all of my depressive symptoms were either from my shitty diet and the fact that I got minimal sunlight and exercise. With that being said it's perfectly natural to be intimidated and in my opinion that's the healthy way to feel about DMT. Just be sure you want to go where you're about to go and then take the rip/rips. Hit that stuff like it's the only thing you know. Hold it in as long as you can. If you are still in reality at all take another rip to seal the deal for the breakthrough.

DMT,2ykhca,gratuitous_algorithm,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:12:09 2015 UTC,It's possible g scales might be a bit inaccurate for that. They recommend you weigh a min of 20x the increment. Ie for gram scales that would be 20g. 0.1g scales might work though. Honestly. I wouldn't worry. I bought 0.001g scales from eBay and I haven't had any trouble.

DMT,2yitvi,mahthrowsaways,1 point,Tue Mar 10 03:55:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply <3 I certainly feel similarly about shrooms/lsd. It seemed that I almost decided to dedicate my thoughts to social insecurities because they were right in front of me and I was stuck there with them for so goddamn long. You've given me hope for DMT, but I will surely think about it more.  I haven't done a psychedelic in a while. Do you think it would be wise to do a solo shroom trip to reacquaint myself with the psychedelic landscape or will DMT blow it away anyway..? The only time I've ever felt uncomfortable on psychedelics is when other people are involved."
DMT,2yitvi,Imgodnigga,2,Tue Mar 10 04:22:26 2015 UTC,I suggest to try lsd again by yourself and see what type of mindset you get from it. If you have a great experience go for the dmt! You mentioned the come down from dmt and it really is one of my favorite parts of a dmt trip. For me it feels like I just roll back into reality. I usually come to rolling back and forth on my side slightly and making some sort of noise grunting or moaning what have you. The experience by itself though is very intense and wouldn't recommend for anyone who gets bad vibes off lsd.

DMT,2yeq2w,Loud_Cloud,4,Mon Mar 9 04:08:31 2015 UTC,"My first time on DMT was like OPs experience. Me and my friends pulled off our first extraction from MHRB and smoked a fat bowl each. I found it hard to take a second/third hit after the initial ""wtf/holy shit feeling"" that I came to associate with DMT. After a couple minutes of weird geometric visuals and coming to know the strange experience of DMT my friends and I found ourselves in a time loop of sorts. We couldn't actually talk or move really, but later we all recollected that during our trip were smoking a bowl of weed over and over, which we actually weren't. Other than sit in our chairs all we actually did during the trip was accidentally knock over the bong and some other stuff near us in our collective delirium. We all saw machine elves too. Mine took the form of a geometric outline with a ghostlike aura. As the comedown progressed the time loop stopped and we were tired."

DMT,2yemx6,RedSteppa,2,Mon Mar 9 04:15:07 2015 UTC,Try using a little more... maybe 70mg? Ideally you want to take one large hit and hold it for as long as possible and hopefully you'll be so far gone you won't remember exhaling. Because dmt tolerance builds up so fast I'm sure your tolerance is at 100% when you go for the third hit. If one hit isn't possible hold the first hit for 20 seconds then the second for as long as possible. If this still doesn't work try different methods. I've used a freebase pipe many times with 100% breakthrough reliability. Sounds like you come so close! Even when you feel like it's enough keep pushing in order to breakthrough. Good luck :)

Or even better imho...do some research on changa."
DMT,2yc01w,Psiloar,12,Sun Mar 8 12:52:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, don't listen to the nay-sayers in this thread. This method ABSOLUTELY works. I have been smoking DMT consistently since the end of 2008, I have tried numerous methods including:  Bubble/pookie (it's a meth pipe) stem pipe the machine Glass vapor Genie Weed pipe Bong Volcano Laced joint Hash oil vape pen  and of all the ways I have found to do it, over the last 6 years now, has been an e-cig using a Nautilus Mini. It is absolutely effective, and absolutely allows for breakthroughs WITHOUT the need of a lighter, complicated intake system, or wall outlet. I have shared this with a large number of people, many of them having issues in the past with taste or difficulty smoking. This method makes it 100% easy. No learning curve, no harsh taste, no worry of not getting enough fast enough, no reloading or not being able to blast off with others.  I currently use a regular Kanger tech battery attached to a plain old Nautilus mini. The gravity fed nautilus tank is IDEAL. This is my preferred space shuttle and I absolutely see no reason to use anything else (personally).   DMT saturates into Propelyne glycol, meaning that it will dissolve from it's crystalline state into a liquid form if added to a 100% PG solution. This is an option, but putting it into a 100% PG solution doesn't allow the molecule to recrystallize, and after 6 months may be a little weaker than when you first made it. The answer is to use a mixture around 90/10 or 80/20 Propelyne Glycol to Vegetable Glycerin. Using a mixture with even a small amount of VG in it seems to allow your spice to reform a matrix and, because it's still safely stored in the tank, it doesn't oxidize, lasting  much longer. The only catch is closing the airflow to your nautilus tank, filling a cup with hot water, and dipping your tank into the water until your spice has remelted into the solution.   Additionally, UNLIKE WHAT A POSTER BELOW WROTE, mixing DMT into a e-cig juice is a extremely pleasant smoke. The multiple options of e-cig fluid flavors allow you to compliment the DMT smoke however you want, and the low heat from the battery doesn't burn the DMT, allowing it to vape at a low temp and not be harsh. IT TASTES LIKE ANGEL KISSES ON YOUR EYELIDS BROTHER!  Here is another MAJOR benefit to the E-pen method: You are NO LONGER restricted to only 3 hits.  ""You only get 3 hits"" is a myth, and only applicable due to certain intake methods. If you make your intake method as simple as possible (for example, hold it up to your face and just keep breathing) you can feasibly take as many hits as possible within 45-60 seconds before the DMT starts being fully consumed by your body. That's right, it's not a 3 hit rule, its a 45-60 second rule, and even that isn't always applicable.  Do you know how many times you can hit an e-cig in 45 seconds? A lot. I usually only manage to take 4-5 really big hits, where I am completely filling my lungs, before I forget I am even holding a pen. The correct solution ratio is NOT a microdose, but the correct ratio IS the most important part of this method.  So, the ratio myself and many friends have found to work best is 1 gram of DMT to 1 Ml of e-cig fluid. You can even push it and go up to 1.2-1.3 ml, but much more and you'll start to notice that it will take a couple more hits to achieve complete breakthrough. I do sometimes like to mix a solution with more fluid than DMT to smoke at festivals for a slower and more controllable onset. If you want to make some hyper space juice though, go 1 gram to one milliliter.  Here is how you mix the solution: Crush up your molecule into a fine powder (if it is freebase crystal) so that it melts more readily under heat. Larger chunks of crystal take longer to dissolve. You will need to place your spice into a small glass vial or jar (I use a 2 ounce glass vial from the health food store), then take your Ml of fluid and pour it into the vial with your spice. this will seem like a really small amount of fluid compared to a pile of powdered material, and it may not mix right away, but don't panic! Once we are finished it's going to look like like any unassuming e-liquid. After mixing the two together, boil some water in a kettle. Fill two cups with hot water. With the first cup, make some tea. It will be quite lovely and relaxing. With the second cup of hot water, dip your sealed glass vial into the water, being careful to not completely submerge it. The vial will essentially double boil the DMT/e-liquid, applying low enough heat to melt the molecule and mix it with the base fluid.   The spice will have melted within less than 5 minutes, it's really fast, and when it's done it will look like e-fluid with oily rainbow swirls running through it. This is your finished solution. A 1:1 ratio will make roughly 2 Ml of finished, ready, Hyperspace juice.  Once you've got this, simply pour it into your nautilus mini, prime it up like you would any other tank, turn on the battery, and puff until you cant remember how.  Once the solution is mixed, you can take it ANYWHERE and it looks completely inconspicuous, even more inconspicuous than a joint or hash pen. You can smoke it in bed, on a windy mountain, or even in public at an event if you'd like. No learning curve either, just hold it to your face, and fill your lungs each time (I usually double press the button on the battery to avoid the automatic shut off time).  With this ratio using a full gram I typically get 10-15 full trips w/ breakthrough per milliliter, so if you have 2 Ml of solution, that's roughly 20-30 full trips from 1 gram, which is actually really really good bang for amount of spice used. Basically a 50mg blast off each time rest assured, and none of your smoke is lost/wasted/burned.  This is the third time this topic has come up, with people saying it doesn't work. I think It's time I write you guys a tech with some pictures. Next time my supply refills I will show everyone a step by step walkthrough for this really wonderful method."
DMT,2yc01w,uncooluserid,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:03:57 2015 UTC,"Oh man this is great! I feel like I just had the biggest struggle finding the right information, and I was getting a bit disappointed. I'm sure a lot of people would really appreciate it. Also one question my vape has variable wattage so could I use the lowest wattage? I can't wait to try it!"
DMT,2yc01w,uncooluserid,3,Mon Mar 9 03:31:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have used a variable wattage battery before, it works better in my opinion on a lower voltage, too high and you'll overheat your DMT. Think of it the same way you'd think of smoking it, the less heat you are able to apply while still vaping it, the cooler the smoke will taste, thus incurring less of the dreaded 'burned' taste. I am pretty sure a regular e-go battery, or my kangertech for example, runs at 3.8 watts. This works really well in my opinion, as the e-fluid doesn't need a high temp to vape either.   yeah I'll post a tech once I get more. I put my last gram into my pen a while ago and am waiting to resupply. It's honestly really easy once you've seen it done.   Enjoy the smooth ride in your new luxury model space cadillac!"
DMT,2yc01w,ThePeskyWabbit,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:01:13 2015 UTC,Ow many mg/ml do you recommend?
DMT,2yc01w,uncooluserid,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:04:04 2015 UTC,1 gram to 1.0 - 1.3 ml is my personal recommendation.
DMT,2yc01w,ThePeskyWabbit,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:55:29 2015 UTC,I'll have to try this. Thanks!
DMT,2yc01w,uncooluserid,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:07:51 2015 UTC,Hey so I might try to make this thing soon. One question though. Could I take flavored e cig juice and the heat the crystal in there? Or do I have to mix it in .9 ml of PG soak it and heat it then add .1 ml of VG unflavored?  Edit: Also what kind of flavor would you recommend I try it with?
DMT,2yc01w,uncooluserid,2,Thu Mar 12 04:12:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm a little bit unclear on exactly what you mean here, but I'll take a crack at it and let me know if the answer fits.  Yes, you can put your crystal or powder or whatever freebase form it's in, and place it inside the E-cig fluid, and then heat them together. This is what I typically do, as it's just easiest to mix it and heat it and be done.  I don't know if your e cig fluid is 100% pg, most fluids have at least a little bit of VG mixed into them. I don't bother to add extra VG after making a mixture. I usually just try and get a fluid that's already vape ready, and then just add my DMT to the correct ML amount, and heat.  So does that answer the question? You can definitely just add your crystal to your fluid and heat it up. Remember to crush the crystal up before hand though, otherwise it will take WAY longer to melt.  As for flavors I can recommend? I think it's primarily personal taste but I tend to avoid anything that tastes too much like candy. So far I have tried:  Honey Custard Mango Grape (this was actually really nice with the DMT vapor) Chocolate Mint S'mores  ... S'mores was not good... I still have a left over milliliter laying around, it tasted so weird. Just had to mix up another batch.  So far, my favorites have been Honey, Mango, and Grape."
DMT,2yc01w,jesuslikedmen,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:53:37 2015 UTC,Yeap that answers it. Thanks again! You were super helpful!
DMT,2yc01w,uncooluserid,2,Thu Mar 12 05:35:06 2015 UTC,my pleasure! Enjoy the future of spice vaping!
DMT,2yc01w,jesuslikedmen,1 point,Thu Mar 12 05:59:18 2015 UTC,sorry to comment i found this super late but I only have about a .4 of dmt and its pretty yellow so not as pure as white crystals. Would that be ok as well as it being such a small amount? should i still use 1ml or .5ml. Sorry to ask but you seem like you would know
DMT,2yc01w,uncooluserid,2,Thu May 14 04:13:47 2015 UTC,"yes it should still work, you should do .5ml to your .4"
DMT,2yc01w,jesuslikedmen,1 point,Fri May 15 09:18:21 2015 UTC,Thanks man do you think it would ruin my nautilus tank and make it a perma deemz tank lol
DMT,2yc01w,DOCTOR_JUSTICE,2,Fri May 15 14:33:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, it will. Once the saturated fluid with molecule is in the tank and circulating through the pull system, there's no getting the taste out. I have two nautilus minis, one specifically for saturated fluid, and one for just regular vaping without the spice. I have an old nautilus that sits on a shelf unused because it was the first tank I smoked the substance out of for a while, tried to clean it thoroughly to use it for regular vaping (rubbing alcohol and everything) and it still tastes like DMT."
DMT,2yc01w,globaldu,1 point,Fri May 15 20:11:23 2015 UTC,aw man lol but it might be worth it. now i gotta get some pg :p
DMT,2yc01w,globaldu,1 point,Fri May 15 20:14:58 2015 UTC,I feel like I saw a thread on /r/drugs where OP was claiming he was able to breakthrough. I'm having trouble finding it now though.
DMT,2yc01w,globaldu,0,Sun Mar 8 16:46:52 2015 UTC,No you can't use a nautilus. You need something for crystals or a freebase tank.
DMT,2yc01w,globaldu,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:56:13 2015 UTC,I plan on mixing it with propylene glycol
DMT,2yadu6,Chemica1Brain,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"Let it sit for another day and see what you get. Also, how deep is your dish that you put in the freezer?  For future reference, you'll get much better results if you take your time and measure out your materials. My basification step includes 3 hours of heating and mixing, an hour of mixing and settling for each pull, etc. I get virtually no plant goo in my dishes."
DMT,2yadu6,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Mar 8 01:22:05 2015 UTC,Well its in a sealed mason jar and its probably about half a cup. Yeah next time i may try to measure it better.
DMT,2yadu6,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Mar 8 01:33:22 2015 UTC,"I use shallow pyrex dishes so the layer of solvent is thin. This means the crystals, as they're forming, have less solvent to travel through as they crash out and settle to the bottom. I have a good size jar that I pour used naphtha into and I saw crystals on the bottom in about a week. With pyrex, i saw crystals in ~8 hours, but i let it sit for 2 days. Grab a pyrex and do your first pull in it next time to see if it works better for you.  Good luck, be safe and have fun!"
DMT,2yadu6,CluelessNoodles,2,Sun Mar 8 03:34:29 2015 UTC,Perfect thanks for the reply ill try that.
DMT,2yadu6,apathetic_iceberg,1 point,Sun Mar 8 04:36:40 2015 UTC,"Dude why take so many shortcuts, like come on, you didn't even measure?"
DMT,2yadu6,apathetic_iceberg,1 point,Sun Mar 8 01:57:52 2015 UTC,I cant under the circumstances.
