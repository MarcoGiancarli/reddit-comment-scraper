There are two basic variants currently being developed, based on a common upper receiver: a bullpup version and a standard version with folding, retractable stock. Thanks to a variety of modules, both variants can be easily transformed into a carbine, sniper rifle or squad light machine gun. The rifle will be chambered for standard 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition, but a 7.62×51mm NATO version will also be considered.  I am a robit"

Yes, you heard right. The company is a whopping 489 years old!! In 1526, the Arsenal of Venice ordered 185 arquebus barrels from Bartolomeo Beretta who was located in Gardone which is about 160 kilometres (approx. 100 miles) from Venice. This makes Beretta the oldest firearm company in the world with its corporate headquarters still in Gardone. The original purchase receipt from 1526 is still said to be stored in the archives of Beretta, by the way.      In this context I should probably rather show a Beretta 92 or a M1915 but I chose the Beretta Cougar 9mm.   For all my photos check out Sveenys Armory on Facebook. I'd highly appreciate!  I am a robit"

In particular, it gives astronomers a great opportunity to see the delicate dusty lanes of the spiral arms silhouetted against the golden haze of the galaxy's core. In addition, brilliant clusters of young blue stars shine scattered throughout the disc, mapping the galaxy's star-forming regions.  >Perhaps surprisingly, side-on views of galaxies like this one do not prevent astronomers from deducing their structures. Studies of the properties of the light coming from NGC 2683 suggest that this is a barred spiral galaxy, even though the angle we see it at does not let us see this directly.  >This image is produced from two adjacent fields observed in visible and infrared light by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys. A narrow strip which appears slightly blurred and crosses most the image horizontally is a result of a gap between Hubble's detectors.

ArtJunkie,3djbfs,MultiFunctionBot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"Here is a link to the original submission  Here is a comment by the original submitter  During 12–17 August 1969, Northern Ireland was rocked by intense political and sectarian rioting. There had been sporadic violence throughout the year arising from the civil rights campaign, which was demanding an end to discrimination against Irish Catholics. Civil rights marches were repeatedly attacked by both Ulster Protestant loyalists and by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), a unionist and largely Protestant police force.  The disorder led to the Battle of the Bogside in Derry, a three-day riot in the Bogside district between the RUC and the nationalist/Catholic residents. In support of the Bogsiders, nationalists and Catholics launched protests elsewhere in Northern Ireland. Some of these led to attacks by loyalists working alongside the police. The most bloody rioting was in Belfast, where seven people were killed and hundreds more wounded. Scores of houses, most of them owned by Catholics, as well as businesses and factories were burned-out. In addition, thousands of mostly Catholic families were driven from their homes. In certain areas, the RUC helped the loyalists and failed to protect Catholic areas. Events in Belfast have been viewed by some as a pogrom against the Catholic and nationalist minority.  The British Army was deployed to restore order and state control and peace lines began to be built to separate the two sides. The events of August 1969 are widely seen as the beginning of the thirty-year conflict known as the Troubles - From Wikipedia  Original caption: The British Army in the streets during the riots of Londonderry, Northern Ireland, in August 1969 in the United Kingdom.

ArtJunkie,3db3gs,MultiFunctionBot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:09:17 2015 UTC,"Here is a link to the original submission  Here is a comment by the original submitter  The bombing of Dresden, the capital of Saxony took place three months before the eventual surrender.  Over 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city were dropped. The bombing and the resulting firestorm destroyed over 1,600 acres (6.5 km2) of the city centre. An estimated 25,000 people were killed.  There has been marked controversy behind the decision to bomb the city so late in the war. There exist reports that justify the bombings as being of strategic importance, and opinions that claim it was unnecessary.  Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five or The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death (1969) used some elements from his experiences as a prisoner of war at Dresden during the bombing Vonnegut recalled ""utter destruction"" and ""carnage unfathomable.""

Continue to stir until flour turns golden and onions and jalapeños are well-coated, about 2 minutes. Slowly stir in milk and continue to stir until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Mix in salt. A handful at a time, stir in cheddar and gouda, making sure each handful is melted entirely before adding in next. Add barbecue sauce and cayenne pepper and mix until well-combined.

The majority were held in reserves by Australia in case of an attack on Australian soil. Unfortunately a fire destroyed most of the Charltons after the war ended.

It was also attacked by aircraft of the Red Air Force, especially in 1945 as Soviet forces closed on the city. British bombers dropped 45,517 tons of bombs; the Americans dropped 23,000 tons. As the bombings continued more and more people moved out. By May 1945, 1.7 million people (40% of the population) had fled.  Up to the end of March 1945 there had been a total of 314 air raids on Berlin, with 85 of those coming in the last twelve months. Half of all houses were damaged and around a third uninhabitable, as much as 16 km² of the city was simply rubble. Estimates of the total number of dead in Berlin from air raids range from 20,000 to 50,000; current German studies suggest the lower figure is more likely. This compares to death tolls of between 22,000 and 25,000 in the single attack on Dresden on 14 February 1945, and the 40,000 killed at Hamburg in a single raid in 1943.

At Kazan, continue south on the Volga until you reach Volgograd.  3.) At Volgograd use the Volga-Don Canal to reach the Don River.

This is a single, uncropped, frame taken hand held.  Technique: I used a syringe with a .8mm diameter needle to inject 2:1 sugar syrup into a Lavender flower. You can get bigger needles, but .8mm is a good compromise between being small enough to get into most flowers and yet big enough for thick liquids. Even though the bumblebee wanted the sweet stuff it didn't want me getting close and it's natural for them to pull away from me, and I used that behavior to get the angle that I needed for this shot. Lots of curves, and the depth is thin and flat. But the bee made it easier for me when it pulled back from the camera. Ignore the shutter speed -the flash was the only significant light source on the subject. I dragged the shutter to pick up some detail in the background.  I am a robit"

Single 1/2"" exposure, Nikon D810, 14mm lens, f/8, 1, 64 ISO.  This evening in peticular was one of those moments you couldn't believe what you were witnessing. After hunkering down in a blizzard for the last 5 hours we expected very little for the pending sunset. Just as the golden hour arrived we found ourselves sitting in the eye of the storm. An eerie stillness in the air was accompanied by vibrant blues, pinks, purples, and oranges that ignited the soft storm clouds on the horizon.   ""It was the sudden presence of silence that made the evening so surreal. All we had been hearing the last 5 hours was wind howling and blowing snow through our tarp. At one point during the sunset I had to stop shooting, stand up, and just absorb the scene that was unfolding. The intense colors, perfect tranquility, and post storm aroma of snow and dirt truly made me appreciate the special link between nature and the observer."" -Mark www.ourearthinfocus.com  I am a robit"

Produced to this day in different variants it is also one of the most popular ones. This is my Ruger Mark II Target with the bull barrel. Probably my favourite gun to shoot. Little recoil, pinpoint accuracy, versatility, reliability and low ammunition cost make this pistol a winner. I do personally enjoy its classic design a lot too which is basically a mix between the function of the Japanese Nambu pistol coupled with the timeless aesthetics of a Luger Parabellum.  The muzzle device is an own construction, by the way. It doesn’t really reduce felt recoil by a lot. How would it, on a 22? It’s more meant as a fancy, more or less useful thread protector. We do not sell this item but the company Tactical Solutions offers a very similar product if you’re interested.  For more firearm, knife and gear pics check out Sveenys Armory  I am a robit"

Then, when I got older, when I opened my eyes and saw the real world, I began to laugh and I haven’t stopped since. I saw that the meaning of life was to get a livelihood, that the goal of life was to be a High Court judge, that the bright joy of love was to marry a well-off girl, that the blessing of friendship was to help each other out of a financial tight spot, that wisdom was what the majority said it was, that passion was to give a speech, that courage was to risk being fined 10 rix-dollars, that cordiality was to say ‘You’re welcome’ after a meal, and that the fear of God was to go to communion once a year.

From Wikipedia:  > The majority of the designs were modified forms of the Churchill tank or the Sherman tank. Both were available in large numbers. The Churchill had good (though slow) cross-country performance, heavy armour, and a roomy interior. The Sherman's mechanical reliability was valued. Among the many specialist vehicles and their attachments were:  > * Crocodile: A Churchill tank modified by the fitting of a flame-thrower in place of the hull machine gun. An armoured trailer, towed behind the tank, carried 400 Imperial gallons (1,800 litres) of fuel. The flamethrower had a range of over 120 yards (110 metres), far greater than man-portable units. Regarded as a powerful psychological weapon, this flame tank proved highly effective at clearing bunkers, trenches and other German fortifications.  > * AVRE (Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers): A Churchill tank adapted to attack German defensive fortifications. The crew of six were drawn from the Royal Engineers, except for the driver who came from the Royal Armoured Corps. One of the RE crew was a demolitions NCO sapper responsible for priming the ""Flying dustbin"" as well as leading or supervising when they dismounted from the tank (easily done through the side hatches) to place demolition charges (""Wade"" charges). The AVRE's main gun was replaced by a Petard Mortar that fired a forty-pound (18 kg) HE-filled projectile (nicknamed the ""Flying dustbin"") 150 yards (137 m); it was capable of destroying concrete obstacles such as roadblocks and bunkers. The mortar had to be reloaded externally by opening a hatch and sliding a round into the mortar tube from the hull.  > AVREs were also used to carry and operate equipment such as:  >* Bobbin: A reel of 10-foot (3.0 m) wide canvas cloth reinforced with steel poles carried in front of the tank and unrolled onto the ground to form a ""path"", so that following vehicles (and the deploying vehicle itself) would not sink into the soft ground of the beaches during the amphibious landing.  >* Fascine: A bundle of wooden poles or rough brushwood lashed together with wires carried in front of the tank that could be released to fill a ditch or form a step. Metal pipes in the centre of the fascine allowed water to flow through.  >* Small Box Girder: An assault bridge that was carried in front of the tank and could be dropped to span a 30-foot (9.1 m) gap in 30 seconds.  >* Bullshorn Plough: A mine plough intended to excavate the ground in front of the tank, to expose and make harmless any land mines.  >* Double Onion: Two large demolition charges on a metal frame that could be placed against a concrete wall and detonated from a safe distance. It was the successor to the single-charge device Carrot.  I am a robit"

Here's what happened the day they left  >12–13 July: crimes committed in Potočari  >On 12 July 1995, as the day wore on, the refugees in the compound could see VRS soldiers setting houses and haystacks on fire. Throughout the afternoon, Serb soldiers mingled in the crowd and summary executions of men occurred. In the late morning of 12 July 1995 a witness saw a pile of 20 to 30 bodies heaped up behind the Transport Building in Potočari, alongside a tractor-like machine. Another testified that he saw a soldier slay a child with a knife in the middle of a crowd of expellees. He also said that he saw Serb soldiers execute more than a hundred Bosnian Muslim men in the area behind the Zinc Factory and then load their bodies onto a truck, although the number and nature of the murders stand in contrast to other evidence on the Trial Record which indicates that the killings in Potočari were sporadic in nature. Soldiers were picking people out of the crowd and taking them away.  >A witness recounted how three brothers – one merely a child and the others in their teens – were taken out in the night. When the boys' mother went looking for them, she found them stark naked and with their throats slit. That night, a Dutchbat medical orderly witnessed two Serb soldiers raping a young woman.  >One survivor described the murder of a baby and the rape of women occurring in the close vicinity of Dutch U.N. peacekeepers who did nothing to prevent it. According to the survivor, a Serb told a mother to make her child stop crying, and when it continued to cry he took it and slit its throat, after which he laughed. Stories about rapes and killings spread through the crowd and the terror in the camp escalated. Several individuals were so terrified that they committed suicide by hanging themselves.  >One of the survivors, Zarfa Turkovic, described the horrors of rapes as follows: ""Two [Serb soldiers] took her legs and raised them up in the air, while the third began raping her. Four of them were taking turns on her. People were silent, no one moved. She was screaming and yelling and begging them to stop. They put a rag into her mouth and then we just heard silent sobs....""  I am a robit"

This is not true. The Heckler & Koch VP70 came out 12 years before the Glock 17. Still, the Glock was and is a revolutionary and incredibly popular pistol - and rightly so.     Glock 19C with suppressor and laser/light module.     Oh, before you ask: No, the aftermarket threaded barrel is obviously NOT ported even though the weapon is a Glock 19C. This would make no sense.  And yes, the sights are too low. Still, it is pretty easy to shoot and accurate on 10-20 yards/meters.     Check out Sveenys Armory for more cool firearm and gear pics.

I've tried to use the nominal date in those cases.  Switzerland and San Marino haven't really been monarchies. There I've used the date when the republic was established, and they had mainly been preceded by monarchies.  I have used modern state borders, which may pose some problems since the modern state might not have existed when the monarchy disappeared.  I am a robit"

It’s a BT96 by Swiss firearm and suppressor manufacturer Brügger & Thomet. These semi-auto rifles are not available for purchase anymore and very sought-after on the used-market, even here in Switzerland. That’s why I instantly purchased it when it showed up.    Actually, B&T didn’t really produce them, that’s why they don’t appear on the list of certified licensed copies by HK. But they still are licensed copies. Why? Because they’re in fact made by MKE in Turkey (and still being produced there to this day) and were imported, refinished and rebranded by Brügger and Thomet. Some had the grey „Ilaflon“ finish known from the SIG 55x type rifles. This one is obviously not one of them as you can see on the picture. I don’t know of any other modifications made by the Swiss company other than rebranding and refinishing. If you know something I’d be highly interested in hearing it.     If you’re interested in more cool firearm pics please check out  Sveenys Armory for more!  I am a robit"

It took place at the Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands. Nearly 6,400 Japanese, Koreans, and Americans died in the fighting, mostly on and around the small island of Betio.  The Battle of Tarawa was the first American offensive in the critical central Pacific region. It was also the first time in the war that the United States faced serious Japanese opposition to an amphibious landing. Previous landings met little or no initial resistance, but this time the 4,500 Japanese defenders were well-supplied and well-prepared, and they fought almost to the last man, exacting a heavy toll on the United States Marine Corps.  Of the 3,636 Japanese in the garrison, only one officer and sixteen enlisted men surrendered. Of the 1,200 Korean laborers brought to Tarawa to construct the defenses, only 129 survived. All told, 4,690 of the island's defenders were killed. The 2nd Marine Division suffered 894 killed in action, 48 officers and 846 enlisted men, while an additional 84 of the wounded survivors later succumbed to what proved to be fatal wounds. Of these, 8 were officers and 76 were enlisted men. A further 2,188 men were wounded in the battle, 102 officers and 2,086 men. Of the roughly 12,000 2nd Marine Division marines on Tarawa, 3,166 officers and men became casualties. Nearly all of these casualties were suffered in the 76 hours between the landing at 0910 20 November and the island of Betio being declared secure at 1330 23 November - From Wikipedia  Original caption: Tarawa, Gilbert Islands: These Japanese, members of the Royal Marines, believed that they would be dishonored by surrender to American Marines, so they chose death. They killed themselves by placing their rifle muzzles against their heads and pulling the triggers with their toes. The man in rear above still has his big toe in the trigger guard. Virtually the entire garrison of Tarawa was wiped out. © Bettmann/CORBIS  I am a robit"

The exceptions are Liechtenstein, which is usually considered a semi-constitutional monarchy due to the large influence the prince still has on politics, and the Vatican City, which is a theocratic absolute elective monarchy.   There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy in any of the twelve states, although there is a significant minority of republicans in many of them.   Currently seven of the twelve monarchies are members of the European Union: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchies_in_Europe  I am a robit"

Cube your watermelon (reserve a 'stick' with the rind on for a garnish). Add watermelon to mixing cup and muddle til it's mostly pulp. add the gin with some ice and shake (or stir) til cold. Strain (you'll want a mesh strainer to keep the pulp out) into your glass (I only had a tumbler on hand, if I were at a proper bar station I'd opt for a Tom Collins glass with some crushed ice) and add seltzer to taste. Stir, add your garnish (for style points, take a sprig of mint with a long/sturdy stem and push it into your watermelon stick), and add crushed ice if you've got it.

I tried my best to only include it when a country directly declared independence from another one. I tried not to include cases in which a coalition of countries was dissolved, unless a country directly declared independence from the coalition. As for military occupations, such as those that were extensive during World War II, they were only counted if there are no other times in which that country declared independence from another; instead going through the gradual process of nation-building (I did this for France, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Italy, Iran, Thailand, and a few others). But for a country such as Romania, which was occupied by the Soviets for a while, it clearly gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire after being a part of it for several centuries. Because there was an example of it declaring independence from another country, it wasn't necessary to count the military occupation. Only Nepal, Bhutan, and the Scottish Highlands were never conquered and remain gray.  I am a robit"

Like a baby chick pecking its way out of an egg, the star in the center of the Egg Nebula is casting away shells of gas and dust as it slowly transforms itself into a white dwarf star.  >The Egg Nebula is a rapidly evolving pre-planetary nebula spanning about one light year toward the constellation of Cygnus. Thick dust blocks the center star from view, while the dust shells further out reflect light from this star. Light vibrating in the plane defined by each dust grain, the central star and the observer is preferentially reflected, causing an effect known as polarization. Measuring the orientation of the polarized light for the Egg Nebula gives clues as to location of the hidden source. The above image taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope is false-color coded to highlight the orientation of polarization. Source  I am a robit"

The Dnieper dam when it was built was the biggest on earth and so it occupied a place in the imagination and affection of the Soviet people difficult for us to realize ... Stalin's order to destroy it meant more to the Russians emotionally than it would mean to us for Roosevelt to order the destruction of the Panama Canal.  More info  I am a robit"

Light that passed through a red filter, as well as light from a filter that shows the glowing hydrogen gas, is coloured red. Light in the yellow–green part of the spectrum is coloured green, blue light is coloured blue and light that passed through an ultraviolet filter has been coloured purple.

I'm making a big batch for July 4th.   http://nerdswithknives.com/spiced-pickled-grapes/  Makes 1 1/2 Quarts  Ingredients  1 1/2 pounds seedless red grapes, washed  2 1/2 cups red wine vinegar  2 cups sugar  1 tablespoon black peppercorns  1 tablespoon yellow mustard seed  1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt  1 teaspoon coriander seed  1-2 teaspoons red pepper flakes (depending on how spicy you like it)  15 whole cloves  6 bay leaves  4 sticks cinnamon  Directions  Wash and stem the grapes. Using a sharp knife, cut off the very tip of the grape, right where the stem meets it. Place grapes into two clean jars (leave a little room for the brine).  Meanwhile, heat the vinegar and all the remaining ingredients over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally to make sure the sugar has fully dissolved.  Pour the hot liquid, and all of the spices, into the grape-filled jars (I used a funnel but you could also pour the liquid into a spouted measuring jug first, then fill the jars). When the liquid has cooled a bit, use your fingers to push the cinnamon sticks and bay leaves down into the jar with the grapes.  Set aside, uncovered, while the pickling liquid cools to room temperature (about an hour). Screw on lids, turn jars upside-down a few times to distribute the spices, and place in the fridge overnight to cure.  The grapes will take on more and more flavor as they continue to steep. I found 2 days was perfect but it’s really a matter of preference.  I am a robit"
ArtJunkie,3bmbam,MultiFunctionBot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:08:03 2015 UTC,"Here is a link to the original submission  Here is a comment by the original submitter  This appears in James Gurney's very interesting book Imaginative Realism: How to Paint What Doesn't Exist. It's written as a helpful how-to for artists, but it's also beautiful art book that gives his fascinating insight into the creative process.  Very much like John Berkey and Syd Mead, James Gurney is an artist's artist. The combination of his technique and the ""lived-in future"" style he uses for some of his science fiction work gives me the impression of what we'd see if Berkey and Mead had been combined in some sort of teleportation mishap. I mean that in all the best ways. I think he's an extraordinary talent, with a unique imagination that matches it.  While I would call this piece an exception, most of James Gurney's work would be classified as ""fantasy.""  Not only are those pieces different in theme from his science fiction work, they also tend to have a different; softer and more classical; artistic style.   I am a robit"
