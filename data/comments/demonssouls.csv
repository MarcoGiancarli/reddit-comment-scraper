demonssouls,3dvdo1,thunderous_pr0phet,7,Sun Jul 19 21:02:35 2015 UTC,I always thought of it like  BWT: the more you die = the more demons are invigorated = the more ground they cover  (increased drop rate = spoils of war) = the more demons are born (Primeval Demons)  WWT: the more you wreck = the 'safer' Boletaria becomes for adventurers (friendly NPC encounters)
demonssouls,3dvdo1,If9lp8p,2,Mon Jul 20 08:25:02 2015 UTC,"As human souls are reaped, ""the Demon's own soul is invigorated by the life force"" (Narrator) and ""a land barren of Souls is absorbed by fog and banished to the INFINITE DARKNESS"" (Monumental). So world tendency represents the Demon's progress at absorbing the souls in that land. The more the souls balance tips in their favor, the more badass and powerful they become.  Take note that the Land of the Giant's Archstone that is disintegrated is pure black. This must have been a level of blackness that was only prevented by the Monumental binding Souls to the Nexus. As long as there are souls the Demons can't fully take due to the bindings, it is impossible for a world to reach infinite Black World Tendency, and crumple to dust."
demonssouls,3dvdo1,guardian_owl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:38 2015 UTC,"Not really. It most like it's the World Tendency what makes parts of the lore, as if it worked as a 'earn your lore'."
demonssouls,3dvdo1,Sentuh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:06:10 2015 UTC,Not an over-arching lore but the story narrative does change (and the story details expand on new item descriptions) based on how you act (and the tendency that follows).

demonssouls,3dwrm6,tensionsmountain,2,Mon Jul 20 08:07:28 2015 UTC,"I can't atm, but for subsequent runs, start your ng online but then go offline once you've started entered the nexus. Since online activity has died down, the default tendency will be just before pwwt and you'll only have to beat the first boss in each area (without dying in body form) to get pwwt."
demonssouls,3dvtrz,Eggs_is_eggs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:19:11 2015 UTC,"So when I kill the 1-4 boss I should go back to the nexus and suicide?   Yep, I would recommend doing that.   What about levels that I've already killed all the bosses? In stonefang tunnel, I saw Skirvir the Wanderer and he told me to bring him the Dragon Bone Smasher. I got it but when I go back to see Skirvir, he's gone. How do I make him reappear?   Did you die in body form at any moment? Are you playing online?   Is tendency only for 1 level?   IIRC, 4 levels from neutral tendency for pure black world tendency, and 3 levels from neutral tendency for pure black world tendency.  You see, +3 to -4. Events and Black Phantoms only happen at +3 and -4, not in the middle.   If I killed all the bosses in World 2, how can I make that world's tendency go back to white?   Kill invaders. That's the only way.  About the system, I don't think is dumb, just not polished."
demonssouls,3dvtrz,Sentuh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I died in body form. I wasn't aware of how the tendency system works so every time I beat a boss I would go back to body form and continue to play the game normally then inevitably I would die sometime after that and go back to soul form. After you beat the bosses, you can only go back towards white by killing invaders? But you have to be in body form to do that and if you die in body form you go back towards black. LOL.   Is new game+ a lot harder? Maybe I can just wait until my next play through to bother with this tendency stuff. Or does playing offline make a difference?"
demonssouls,3dvtrz,Sentuh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"Well, being in human form is ""overrated"" in Demon's Souls. The only good thing of the human form is being able to summon, besides full health.  NG+ is 40% harder, so it's a big jump in difficulty. You should prepare yourself. As I always have said, it's better to modify the world tendencies in NG+ or in a new playthrough, not in the first. This is what happens.  If you play online, the World tendencies may vary even if you didn't do anything, so the best for manipulating them is playing offline."
demonssouls,3dvtrz,tensionsmountain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:12:34 2015 UTC,This is good advice but I disagree on the body form thing - being in body form in Demon's basically gives you an extra ring slot (as well as quite a bit more health).  It can make a huge difference sometimes (depending on build etc.)
demonssouls,3dvtrz,Sentuh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:40 2015 UTC,"I have another question about New game+. Are all the items that are strewn across the levels reset in each new playthrough? I.e. you can find the cling ring again in 1-1 again, a dragon long sword +1 in 2-2 again, all the random consumable souls items will be there again, etc.?  If so, I guess the new game + become easier in that you don't really have an incentive to explore the levels since you already have all the items and since you know the layouts of the levels you can just go straight for the bosses. Though the enemies of course are a lot tougher in NG+."

demonssouls,3du41b,sevlan,11,Sun Jul 19 14:13:05 2015 UTC,The order doesn't really matter too much.  I think you'll find that Demon's Souls holds its own to the other titles and actually does some really neat things that haven't been done since.

It is unique to DeS and is very annoying."

I'm sure you've heard ""DKS2 sucks!"" all the time. Don't listen.  It's not as good as Dark Souls in many people's opinions...but it's the next best game after Dark Souls.  Demon's Souls after playing those two is great because it's familiar in a lot of ways but also very different.  Demon's Souls might actually be my favorite."
demonssouls,3du41b,Xattm15,2,Mon Jul 20 12:38:48 2015 UTC,Assuming you are playing all 3 games on PS3 I'd say play DS2 first since the game is currently still somewhat active and who knows what it will look like in the future.

demonssouls,3dnhzz,Kouge,3,Fri Jul 17 18:32:52 2015 UTC,"I'll say that a magic class is easier, a melee class is harder.  However, a melee class gives you a better feel for the combat system, and forces you to learn enemy patterns and such way more.  The Royal is by far the easiest class (you get magic right off the bat and a headpiece that regenerates mana).  The Wanderer may be the best class for learning the combat system.  Enough stats to wield decent weapons, but not enough to wear heavy armor well, so you have to learn to dodge and hit and run.  So if you want some challenge I'd go Wanderer, if you want an easier time Royal."
demonssouls,3dnhzz,Aqualungfish,2,Fri Jul 17 19:40:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the input. I like the challenge and when I was going through the manual, for some unknown reason, I really liked the Wanderer. I prefer melee combat over ranged specially in a game like this, I think it's important to go up and close for the immersion's sake. Thanks again!"
demonssouls,3dnhzz,Aqualungfish,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:39 2015 UTC,"You're welcome :)  I started as Wanderer the first time I played.  I got super stuck later and restarted, but I had a lot of fun till then."
demonssouls,3dnhzz,cloverint,2,Fri Jul 17 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"I always start a Thief, but that's because I'm not great at parrying so I rely on being able to enter hit, and quickly dodge (fast roll), needless to say I can't block anything, my character is basically made of glass and the equipment is attached with duct tape. If you're like me and like being super fast I can suggest the Thief class."
demonssouls,3dlxqa,RaleighRoger,2,Fri Jul 17 09:53:21 2015 UTC,"Thats just how it works in this game. Faith is op, no doubt about it. But when you get to 50 str there's like a 6 damage difference on a +5 greatsword so who even cares. Plus theres stuff that resists magic so certain enemies you will do a lot less damage to than if you used your crushing greatsword."
demonssouls,3dlxqa,Frostcrag64,2,Fri Jul 17 10:57:43 2015 UTC,"Typically the the scaling paths that go with Faith or Magic have slightly higher total AR than those that scale only with STR and/or DEX. You are offered the convenience of slightly higher average damage at the cost of not being able to temporarily buff your weapon in situations where you need more damage.  Consumables:  Turpentine +80 fire damage for 60 seconds  Black turpentine +150 fire damage for 30 seconds  Sticky White Stuff +110 magic damage for 60 seconds  Spells:  Enchant / Light weapon +Magic damage based on the your MAG stat and the strength of the catalyst for 60 seconds  Cursed Weapon +50% physical damage for 60 seconds at the cost of loss of 1% of max HP per second  So unbuffable weapon (blessed, moon, dragon, mercury, etc.) vs. unbuffed weapon is a wash or slightly in favor of the unbuffable weapon, but once a buff is applied it outdamages the unbuffable weapon considerably."
demonssouls,3dlxqa,guardian_owl,2,Fri Jul 17 14:43:17 2015 UTC,"Great Club is trash.  IIRC it has 100 AR and can't be normally upgraded or buffed?  Just don't use it.  Its only purpose is to be upgraded to Meatcleaver, and Strength builds have better alternatives to MC (Greataxe or Crescent Axe). Crushing Weapons can be buffed, Blessed weapons can't. Similar to Dark Souls, in Demon's Souls, split damage is weaker than pure damage.  350 pure AR > 400 AR split evenly between physical and magic.  This is because split damage weapons need to go through two forms of defense, rather than just one.  So comparing the total listed damage on your character's stat screen isn't going to give you a good idea of how much damage will actually be dealt. Blessed mace you find early on is really strong.  It is effectively a +7 weapon.  ALSO enemies have low defenses early on, making split damage stronger. That damage calculator was really inaccurate last time I checked.  Granted, that was years ago.   In practice, a 50 Strength Crushing weapon typically does as much as a 50 Faith Blessed weapon, barring really high/low magic defenses.  Strength is slightly better with light weapons, like Guillotine Axe and Knight Sword, they meet in the middle with Mirdan Hammer/Claymore, and then Blessed weapons hit slightly harder with the Greataxe.  Faith builds would also hit slightly harder with a Greatsword, but Strength builds get access to the Dragon Bone Smasher, which is a much stronger version of the Greatsword.  BUT!  Strength builds can use Curse Weapon, which increases damage by 50% and requires virtually no stat investment.  The result is that, when buffed, Strength builds hit significantly harder than Faith builds.  In exchange, Faith builds get to regenerate health (Blessed +5 weapon = 6 hp/second regen).  They also get access to more miracle slots, which is... nice?  I guess?  God's Wrath is pretty sweet in PvE, at least."

demonssouls,3dlxqa,RAZ55,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:15:47 2015 UTC,Ok example  You attack with physical 100ar - enemy has 30 physical defence you do 70 damage  You attack with physical 50ar and magic 50ar  - enemy has 30 physical defence and 30 magic defence you do 40 damage  Basically if you do 2 types of damage the enemy uses 2 types of defence

Apparently, the split damage will go through 2 different armor reductions (mag for mag and physical for physical), this can reduce actual output of blessed, but you may not see a difference. Crushing weapons come with the added bonus of being buffed, but I'll let you check that out If you want."

For an actual ""good"" exploration of the level, track down rickgibbed's video.  I'm personally avoiding watching it until I give up on accessing it myself.  Edit:  And apparently I called it Limits instead of Limit in the subject.  Well, since it never made it to the final game, my name is just as valid...."

Each individual step was fairly easy, but I put it off for quite some time since it all looked rather insurmountable in the beginning.  My last (?) problem with getting the other areas to load is that I seem to be appearing somewhere outside of the map bounds.  Or at least that's the impression I get when everything loads into a gray screen with a HUD and nothing else.  Is that something you ran into, or bypassed with your method?  It does the same thing for m07_01/02 and all the remaining m99 maps."
demonssouls,3dl54e,rickgibbed,4,Fri Jul 17 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, though I ignored that problem because if I let the character fall to their death in the void, they respawn properly."

I'd trained myself to quit to menu as soon as possible in the grayness, as dying like that in the m99 levels causes a crash with my method.  Now I wonder if it's as simple as putting a breakpoint on the warp function, and then seeing what ID it warps you to on death."
demonssouls,3dl54e,penguins_912q,3,Fri Jul 17 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"I believe the issue is tied to the spawn points for the player for the areas being wrong/invalid, but I never tracked down the exact problem."
demonssouls,3dl54e,knirp7,4,Fri Jul 17 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"The 5th number of the WarpNextStage command is some sort of location ID.  For example, the archstone in m07 triggers this command when used - proxy:WarpNextStage( 1, 0, 0, 0, 1011 );  1,0,0,0 obviously being the Nexus, and 1011 is the location ID that dumps you right in front of the m07 archstone when you return.  proxy:WarpNextStage( 7, 1, 0, 0, xxxx ); is the command I use to try reach the second area of m07, but 0, -1, 999, 998, and 997 (based off the pattern from the other archstones) have all been dumping me into nothingness.  As you say, they probably didn't actually attach those IDs to any actual location in the level so it just dumps me at some default location over nothingness.  Once I confirm that the level's loading enough that death will teleport me somewhere valid, I'll try finding the actual ID of the respawn area.  Looking in the scripts, the only valid Warp ID mentioned is commented out, but it gives an ID of 2013.  I'll have to give that a shot but doubt it's the proper starting area."

Though one other thing you have to consider is where is the conventional entrance to Latria supposed to be? We warp into the prison which is on a lower level, but you're not going to have visiting royalty and dignitaries enter there and there doesn't appear to be an exit from there anyway. The answer is probably via the swamps.   Visitors arrive on the wooden docks and then ride up the cage elevators to enter the city. The cages being the main entrance limits the speed at which an army could enter the city, limits the movement of any soldier inside (allowing defenders to skewer them with spears through the bars), and they also serve as ""drawbridges"" which could all be raised to half staff in case of a siege.   If those cages are the main entrance to Latria, then you have to fight your way DOWN the stairs to get access to the rest of the city. The passage that leads from those cages also exits right next to the stairs that lead to the Monarch's chamber making it convenient for visitors.   Though that still doesn't explain the backward staircase when entering the city from the other side of the swamp via the elevator as defenders would be above. I suppose that is probably the entrance they use to bring in prisoners since it exits near the upper entrance of the prison chapel."

I felt like Demon's Souls had you do more things with NPCs than Dark Souls did. Event quests, there's this thing called world tendency which most people hate because it's hard to manipulate when playing online, however the world itself changes based on whether your wold tendency is pure white, pure black or neutral. I felt like Demon's Souls had more things/secrets to be discovered.   It may seem like I'm bashing Dark Souls, but I'm not, I love Dark Souls, all I'm saying is some (if not most) of those great things in Dark Souls that have become iconic came from Demon's Souls.   The gargoyles battles Invasions If you've played the first couple of hours of Dark Souls you'll start to recognize little things in some of the NPCs and enemies (I don't want to give too much away).   TL;DR If you can just play it, it's awesome, I also played it after Dark Souls and at first I was skeptical that I might not like it being an older game an all, but I ended up liking just as much, all three souls games are great in their own way."

Demons Souls require you to replay large chunks of the levels if you fail a boss. No quick running from a lantern to the boss, no sir. No running past every enemy to get where you want. Just pure, tedious, replaying levels.  This for me is the biggest difference between the games (and the fact that there is very little I find interesting about DeS lore and world, but what do I know): DeS is so much more tedious, with a lot fewer shortcuts, and absolutely no in-level checkpoints/lanterns/archstones. Which is really fucking aggrevating after Bloodborne."

Of all the Souls games, it's the easiest in which to run past enemies, because they mostly have bad tracking and slow AI.  Like????  I mean, I just counted it up, and only five of the levels in the whole game don't have shortcuts that skip huge chunks of the level.  Two of those are really short levels that don't need shortcuts.  And two more of them have shortcuts, they just probably weren't intended by the developer, so I'm not counting them.  The vast majority of the levels have ways to reduce the play-time through them by a huge amount.  I'm assuming you've at least beaten Phalanx, which is a great example of how Demon's Souls works.  Pull the lever, gate opens, boss fog is now right at the start of the level."
demonssouls,3dft3d,Pjoernrachzarck,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:33:41 2015 UTC,"I've beaten all X-1 bosses and most X-2 bosses. Non-tedious and time-consuming ways to bosses were absolutely the exception and not the rule. Most of them, like the short cut to firelurker for example, are much more time-consuming than the bosses themselves. The 'official' way back to the adjudicator is ridiculous, the short cut you can use in 4-1 is something bloodborne would've had built in.  Bloodborne almost always has one or even a couple of ways between lanterns to ease your level progress, and to never make it too much of a chore* to get back to where you lost your echoes, or back to the boss.  I love the boss fights in DeS, I don't love the five-minute-chunks it takes to get back to them.   Edit: To clarify, I believe this was/is part of the hardcore appeal of DeS. I get that. As with all the ways the Souls games fuck you over, overcoming them feels amazing. But this is one thing that can be weird and uncomfortable and frustrating when you play DeS after playing Bloodborne, and I personally like that From has decided to stock up on Shortcuts. I expect DS3 to continue the way Bloodborne handled level progression. More than just boss bonfires, linked by 1-3 short cuts each. I loved opening a door or something to find out I just created a new loop through the level. It's super fun and makes the levels so much more impressive. I miss that in DeS.  *relative to the other souls games"

demonssouls,3df830,TalentedJuli,3,Sat Jul 18 11:40:22 2015 UTC,"I can see how it might be immersion-breaking, but it was mostly adopted from convenience. The other games don't have their areas arranged in such a way that it would be feasible to number them - Demon's is the only one without interconnected levels, and you can't miss an Archstone like you can a bonfire."
demonssouls,3df830,tensionsmountain,3,Wed Jul 15 21:46:20 2015 UTC,"World Tendency has a huge list of stuff that affects it.  The official wiki used to have a great page explaining WT and CT in great detail, but it's gone now.  For now illusorywall and I think Wulf2k9 are working on re-building it.  I haven't taken a close look at it, so idk how complete it is, but here it is:  http://demonssouls.wikia.com/wiki/World_Tendency  The big things to keep in mind for WT are:  -Killing bosses increases WT. -Killing Black Phantom invaders increases WT. -Dying in body form reduces WT. -Killing certain NPCs will reduce WT a lot. -Killing certain Black Phantom NPCs will increase WT by a lot. -Killing Primeval Demons will increase WT by a lot.  White WT increases the damage of phantoms and soulform players.  Black WT reduces damage of phantoms, as well as the health of soulform players.  White WT also opens up access to otherwise inaccessible items in many cases.  Sometimes it causes NPCs to appear who will offer you quests.  This varies from world to world, so you'll just have to learn the different PWWT events.  Black WT causes Black Phantom monsters and NPCs to appear.  The Black Phantom NPCs drop unique or rare weapons.  Primeval Demons also appear during Black WT.  There is one Primeval Demon per world.  Primeval Demons have a chance to drop Colorless Demon's Souls, which are used to upgrade unique weapons (you can think of them as Twinkling Titanite).  Primeval Demons have a 100% chance to drop Colorless Demon's Souls ONLY IF you are at PURE Black WT.  Because of this, you should only kill them if you are PBWT.  IIRC, the exact numbers are that they appear at -75% WT, but only have a 100% drop chance at -90% WT (You can go as high/low as +/-100%, but all WT events max out at +/-90%).  Character Tendency is another thing.  It's more mutliplayer-based.  Without multiplayer, i think the only way to increase it is kill the Black Phantom NPCs that show up in PBWT.  You can decrease it by killing certain NPCs.  As a general rule, if you attack first, it will decrease your CT to kill them.  You can also decrease CT by killing blue phantoms or hosts as an invader, or increase it by killing black phantom players invading you.  Killing a boss with blue phantoms in your world also increases CT, but by, like, the tiniest amount ever."
demonssouls,3df830,tensionsmountain,2,Thu Jul 16 02:05:55 2015 UTC,It can be complicated but doesn't have to be. This all you really need to know. For PWWT:   Play offline and in soul form only. Defeat 2-3 bosses and you'll have PWWT.   That's it. There is more to it but you don't need to know any more in order to get to PWWT.  PBWT? You just die a bunch of times in body form. That's literally it. PBWT is also easy to regain any time even if you log on to the servers and lose your World Tendencies. In fact it can be done safely online. All you need is patience and a bunch of Stones of Ephemeral Eyes which you can farm or dupe.

demonssouls,3df830,The_Axem_Ranger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:12:51 2015 UTC,No problem :)   BTW two things in particular often ruin players' efforts at getting PWWT and they are a) forgetting to not log on to the servers (I actually disconnect my PS3 itself when doing WT stuff so I can't accidentally log on to the servers) and b) forgetting that after defeating a boss you regain body form. You should immediately go back to the Nexus after defeating every boss and suicide there to get back to soul form before continuing on in a World.  Best of luck!

Basically you get PB WT, then go sit by the Primeval Demon and invade somebody.  As you're about to enter the other person's world, you kill the Primeval Demon.  Then exit the other player's world, and the Primeval Demon will still be there.  Do this a few times, and you'll have PW WT.  Obviously, this requires people online in your level range, which might be a problem.  You can also get somebody to summon you, but at that point you might as well just have them dupe you a DBS, hah.  If nobody else comes through, I could make a new character and get a DBS for you, shouldn't take more than ~20 minutes, if that."

Most 'dex' type weapons use sharpstones and 'str' type use hardstones. These paths go to +10.  Other upgrade paths usually start with base +7 weapons (some start at +0 or +3). Some paths are exclusive to STR or DEX type weapons. Each of these stones have shard, chunk and pure varieties (no large shards)  Clearstone - Quality path, equal STR and DEX scaling. Bladestone - Sharp path, high DEX scaling. Greystone - Crushing path, high STR scaling. Suckerstone - Tearing path, boosts bleed damage. Mercurystone - Mercury path, adds poisoning. Marrowstone - Fatal path, reduces normal damage but increases crit damage. Dragonstone - Dragon path, removes scaling, adds fire damage. Faintstone - Blessed path, adds faith scaling and magic damage, adds HP regen. Moonlightstone - Moon path, adds INT scaling and magic damage, reduces other scaling. Darkmoonstone - Crescent path, adds INT scaling and magic damage, adds MP regen, removes other scaling. Spiderstone - Sticky path, applies to bows only, boosts DEX scaling. Cloudstone - Dark path, applies to shields only, boosts magic damage reduction. Colorless Demon Soul - used to upgrade special weapons and boss weapons"

demonssouls,3d8aeu,BlankUsername42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:01:00 2015 UTC,"That depends on the weapon. Dex type weapons (daggers, katanas, curved swords) upgrade with sharpstones and Strength type with hardstones"
demonssouls,3d8aeu,spoonard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, similar to how Dark Souls works, you need to upgrade a weapon to a certain point before splitting it off along a different path.  Except that in Demon's Souls, the splitting points are different for every weapon.  For example, you can upgrade n Uchigatana +0 to a Sharp Uchigatana +1 right away.  But you have to get a Spiked Shield to +6 before you can upgrade it to Sharp +1.  Similarly, hammers can go from +0 to Crushing +1 immediately, but you need a Claymore +3 to make a Crushing Claymore +1.  Also, larger weapons require more supplies than smaller ones.  Greataxe, for example, requires 2 Pure Stones (equivalent to Titanite Slabs) to get to its max upgrade level.  Also small correction to apandya27, Colorless Demon's Souls are NOT used to upgrade boss weapons.  Boss weapons cannot be upgraded in Demon's Souls.  They're basically equivalent to Twinkling Titanite, but you only need 1 per upgrade level, for a total of 5 to max upgrade any unique weapon.  tbh the wiki has a great explanation on how upgrades work, as well as just about everything else."

Coolest Archdemon by far.  As far as the bosses go each of them have a trick to make em really easy. I think this is supposed to emphasis mind over might but once you learn the trick the bosses are a joke. For example, using a few fire bombs on Phalanx will clear out the shield slimes and you'll be free to kill the boss with little to no risk of death.   Honestly though if you're coming off the other games DeS is far clunkier in a lot of regards. It may just not be for you and although it's too bad it's also totally fine."
demonssouls,3d823z,wickedblight,2,Tue Jul 14 07:28:23 2015 UTC,"You haven't met this game's best bosses yet (you've only met 4/18), but I suppose this game just might not be your cup of tea. It's also worth noting that this game has much less focus on boss fights than the other soulsborne games.  As for progression, Valley of Defilement is the last archstone you're supposed to go to, judging by the level numbers. It's also designed to be a repugnant shithole for various reasons (but the final boss of VoD gave me chills, really well designed).   Stonefang is the natural next step after Boletaria, trick with arrmor spider is to get close so it stops shooting, and have  a good shield for the channeled fire attack (stability is more important than fire def). The attack does damage in ticks about 4 times, giving you time to drop the shield and get stamina in between each one. The spider is also weak to magic, so slap some sticky white stuff on your weapon or shoot that bitch with spells.  If you don't like Stonefang you can go to Tower of Latria, I think you might enjoy it."
demonssouls,3d823z,gm1111001,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:17:14 2015 UTC,"I think the answer here is that you just need to spend more time with the game.  If you love DS1 & 2, there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't love DeS, but it sounds like your having a bad go of your first play through.   I think given time you will change your opinion on some of your statements (like level design, overall difficulty), but for now your goal should be to learn where everything is and experience the frustration.  As far as a good route to take, you should definitely think about a build first.  Magic is OP in DeS and that route (just as an example) would lead you toward freeing Freke early on and killing bosses that give you the spells you want.  A str build might grab that crushing axe in 2-1.  A lot of people get the crescent falchion in 4-1 right away which acts as the game's Drake Sword.  Also, beating 2-2 will allow you to create boss weapons, which in a few cases are actually useful.  Stick with the game; if you're having too much trouble, wipe your character and make a more optimized build with emphasis on a single damage stat (IE str, dex, int, fai); redoing whatever you've done so far is trivial if you don't like your build.  Keep in mind there is an enormous amount of 'meta-game' once you consider world tendency and character tendency system; also there are probably as many build possibilities as the other souls games (hahaha lvl 1 hyper-mode!!)    Oh finally, the upgrade system is REALLY different in this one, and some materials are very hard to get.  It makes dex builds in particular very frustrating, and might be worth consulting a FAQ for."

demonssouls,3d823z,SunBorne187,2,Wed Jul 15 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"I don't like how the game progresses with your equipment. I got probably halfway through the game (I also did a couple chalice dungeons) and was using the same weapon I pretty much started the game with, and the first set of clothing I found in the sewer.   With the weapons I'd find something new and think it looks cool but see that it's way behind what I already had so it didn't make sense to change my load out at that point. I like that you could use starter weapons to get through the game but I also didn't see the incentive on changing what I had to try and make myself better. In old school RPG's you go to the next town to get the next best type of armor and weapons. And in the Souls games they changed it to being more random, where sometimes you'd get a good piece towards the start of the game but then wouldn't see anything until later (Stone Armor and Smoughs Armor from DaS1) In Bloodborne in felt flat to me, like it doesn't matter.  I also didn't like how the game makes you play in 1 sort of fashion. The Souls games you can play in a multitude of ways. Are you a pyro guy who's a straight damage dealer, a tank with a huge shield, mage, warrior, archer? There was variety. Talking to other players about their experience was so interesting because of how we all play things differently, and solve the same problems in a different fashion. Because the game doesn't let you lean on your shield or your gun it's melee and maneuvering, for everyone.   These things make me feel like you box the player in on how to experience the game.   In Bloodborne I also felt it kept 1 motif going. As opposed to Demon's where it had more of a mixed bag. You had the Knights in a castle, the disease ridden area, the mining area with more fire, a land full of giants. In Bloodborne it felt more like they're harping on the disease part through all of it. Everything in a sense feels gross. Which is fine, I just didn't connect to it like I did with Demon's Souls."

Not everybody has the patience, but most leave it to be the last thing they try and give it a good attempt.  Colorless Demon's Soul - Kill yourself in body form 7 times and reload the level.  Once you've started, don't disconnect/reconnect to PSN until you've killed the demon.  Friend's Ring - Kill the Black Phantoms in this playthrough, then do another playthrough and kill them again.  Mephistopheles - Before doing the above, kill some NPCs to bring you to pure black character tendency, not just dark.  Also, at level 199 you're not going to find many people that can connect at all, much less willing to help.  There are lots of people that would be willing to help you figure it all out, but it sounds like you want us to finish off your checklist so that you can platinum the game and forget it without having to figure out the hard parts."
demonssouls,3d0yyx,Wulf2k,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:14:56 2015 UTC,"Nice!, so:   Die 7 times in a world (in human form I'm guessing), is this assuming I'm in pure white? I've killed black phantoms but it doesn't seem to switch my character tendency, it still looks pretty dark. I must be dark but not pure dark I'm guessing I've read you can de-level with Mephistopheles, but not sure if that's true, I know False King Allant does this, but not sure if that would work and let me connect to other players with lower SL.   Other post about trading items motivated me to open this up, but I can follow directions, I just couldn't make sense of the whole tendency system, I will try the suicide thing in one of the worlds that has primaeval demon's.  How many black phantoms do I need to kill before moving from black to pure white? also what NPCs do you recommend to kill that won't stop me in my tracks to completing the game (the Mephistopheles quest)?  Thanks a bunch, you have a heart of gold, don't let them take it from you."
demonssouls,3d0yyx,Wulf2k,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:50:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, assuming pure white since that's the easiest number to be sure of and there's no harm in killing yourself extra.  You have to be the one to land the fatal blow on the Black Phantom, it can't be gravity, poison, or any other source.  Also, it has to be one of the special, non-respawning Black Phantoms that only appears in Pure Black World Tendency.  It will take 2 full playthroughts, killing all such NPCs, to get from Pure Black to Pure White.  It can be hard to be sure, but it's much easier to dump than gain CT.  Go kill a few more NPCs.  False King will lower you nicely.  Just keep letting him grab you.   The tendencies can be difficult to understand at first, but it's a fairly simple system once you get a handle on it.  The primeval demon in 2-1 is probably the simplest to check, I'm pretty sure you can see him from the starting point when he's up.  It takes 10 Black Phantom NPCs to go from Pure Black to Pure White.  There are 5 per playthrough.  Killing player invaders will raise your CT much quicker, if you can find anybody in range willing to throw down their red sign for you a few times.  Allant can bring you in range of anybody willing to help.  To lower your CT, vendors are a good bet.  The ""Filthy Man"" vendor in Stonefang Tunnel will lower a good chunk of CT, as well as the ""Worshipper of God"" in the Nexus if you're done with miracles for the current playthrough."

demonssouls,3czukj,GothMAXMP,3,Sun Jul 12 07:43:00 2015 UTC,"I'd like a Souls collection on PS4. An HD remaster for Demon's Souls and the original Dark Souls, including the DLC."
demonssouls,3czukj,OpDrop,2,Tue Jul 14 19:38:20 2015 UTC,I think the only relevant parties are From Software and Sony Computer Entertainment.  My wild guess is that there's a 70% chance of a port. High-quality platform exclusives from the previous generation saw a very high proportion of remasters.
demonssouls,3czukj,mister_zurkon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:07:26 2015 UTC,this is kind of what i thought.  it was considered one of the best exclusives by many critics and players of last gen and bloodborne's success just makes it such an obvious pick.  i guess it really depends on what the JP fanbase wants tho since thats really who FS listen to
demonssouls,3czukj,Benjajinj,2,Sun Jul 12 12:20:56 2015 UTC,As long as it doesn't come out too soon; a PS3 copy is in the post.
demonssouls,3czukj,_SAVEMEJEEBUS_,2,Sun Jul 12 17:41:09 2015 UTC,I think it's reasonably likely that we will see something. Especially given Sony's comments re: Bloodborne. Maybe a 10th anniversary remaster in 2019?
demonssouls,3czukj,bonch,2,Sun Jul 12 17:47:12 2015 UTC,A remaster would be an opportunity to untie world tendency from the server average.
demonssouls,3czukj,wickedblight,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:12:46 2015 UTC,I think it would need to be overhauled if they did that. I think world tendency would be nearly guaranteed to swing to white in all places simply because ghost form deaths don't count towards black tendency while all boss deaths count towards white. Theoretically people could swing it if done en mass but I think it would be white 90% of the time
demonssouls,3czukj,bonch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:10:01 2015 UTC,"Well, as it is now, the server average is already near pure white in all worlds and rarely changes. Tendency could certainly use an overhaul."
demonssouls,3czukj,FailureToExecute,2,Thu Jul 16 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"Remember that Demon's Souls had three completely unaffiliated publishers; one for each major area of the world (SCE Japan for Asia, Bamco for Europe/Aus, and Atlus for North America). My admittedly limited understanding of  the legalities of the situation lead me to believe that all three publishers would need to sign off for a port, and if even one doesn't, it can't be released in that region - if it can even be released at all.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong."
demonssouls,3czukj,Max2000Warlord,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:22:47 2015 UTC,"Not really a problem anymore. There wasn't any DLC, so I've got no problem importing the Atlus version, now that ps4 games are region free. And if there's a PC version well, that all becomes a moot point."
demonssouls,3czukj,Pjoernrachzarck,2,Tue Jul 14 07:20:54 2015 UTC,"If I was the publisher, and I had any plans to re-release it, I'd time it with the release frame and to the financial success of DS3.

demonssouls,3cmkh7,Ilikeadventuregames,5,Thu Jul 9 01:59:36 2015 UTC,"You cannot upgrade the Great Club.  You can, however, transform it in to the Meat Cleaver if you still have the Swollen Demon's Soul from Adjudicator.  Beware the Meat Cleaver is ridiculously good and will probably erase any further challenge from the game.  I like the Great Club a lot too; it is perfectly fine in its normal unupgraded state for PVE.  The DBS uses Colorless Demon's Souls, of which there are a fixed ten per playthrough. (you will in all likelihood not be able to get all ten)  You'll have to defeat Flamelurker and take his soul to Ed in 2-1 to apply Demon's Souls to weapons, which includes upgrading the DBS.  There is a lot of information on the wikis: http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/upgrade"

demonssouls,3clmel,rabbitsayer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:35:57 2015 UTC,From what i understand it seems pretty similar. You cant be in soul form to summon and the boss has to still be alive. You also have to be within about 10% of the summoning players level to be summoned
demonssouls,3clmel,robek_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:09:13 2015 UTC,"It's a bit more finicky as far as sign locations go. You can't really wander off too far if you place your sign. However, he helping defeat a boss returns your human form. Being in soul form is pretty much par for the course through the game though, so don't freak if you aren't finding ephemeral eyes or anything. PvP I actually like because the invader can help fight monsters. It's pretty interesting at times. Less sign types and no crystals. Just a summon sign, invasion crystal and message stone."

Save your Adjudicator's Soul and a Club to upgrade into Meat Cleaver. You can get a Great Axe in 2-2 (Stonefang) and upgrade it with faintstones. I've always preferred melee builds, and builds specifically where you smash face with one or two hits and still have enough stamina to roll away. If you do end up going this direction, stack your END and also build up your STR and FTH.  EDIT: For nooby weapons, use your pickaxe in Stonefang. Also in the first Shrine of Storms area, there's a corpse behind a black skeleton that has a Crescent Falchion +2. EXTREMELY useful in the beginning."

demonssouls,3c886j,NinjaBadger7,8,Sun Jul 5 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"So, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne were all singularly directed by this man, so it's natural that those three titles feel somewhat similar.     Dark Souls 2 was made by different people, which, most people, argue is the reason it feels different.     Demon's Souls and Bloodborne (I haven't played Demon's Souls for a long time and have yet to play Bloodborne) are both a bit more morbid in their story and atmosphere, in my opinion. Their music felt more bleak (not in a bad way) compared to the other two games and they feel generally more atmospheric.     Now this is all based mostly on my opinion of course. And while I feel like Demon's Souls and Bloodborne are more atmospheric, I love Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 the most. I enjoy the amount of content in both of them at the expense of a little bit atmosphere. And again, this is my opinion. Some Undead/Hunters might prefer the atmosphere of the Dark Souls series.     Edit: formatting"

I gotta say, playing a Dex Build felt incredibly similar to Bloodborne. I loved every second of it, and trying to do a Str build felt slow and silly to me.

So I'd recommend clearing the other four level 1's before moving on to Tower Knight. In addition, most all the levels 1's have a useful vendor, weapon, armor, or crafting items that will make the level 2's easier."

There's no clue given to speculate who could have been the chieftain, still I can think on two possibilities:   Dirty Colossus: it could be that, being the chieftain the one who represented the ill-fortuned souls of the Valley, the fog turned him in this colossus who represents all the disease and death... The Shaman: it's the one who drops the Shaman set as you kill him. I really doubt it, but maybe the fact that only this depraved shaman gives you this set could have lore reasons. Also, he is isolated from the rest, like if he was in a special position. I said, I really doubt it, but it could be."
demonssouls,3bytpb,Sentuh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:07:42 2015 UTC,"It must be the Dirty Colossus, it seems that only important people turn into demon's, while regular people turn into mindless slaves. example, the 3 bosses of boletaria, were 3 famous knights. The nameless hero was once famous too, and Maiden Astraea was very important religious people, and it seems that Boletaria was very religious since it's on the middle ages, and they hunted witches too."
demonssouls,3bytpb,CrestfallenWarrior,4,Tue Jul 7 01:19:42 2015 UTC,"Also remember, that was a long time ago, the end of the First Scourge, that the archstones were handed out. The leadership structure of the Valley could have changed (much like what happened at Stonefang Tunnel), or the current chieftain (who would have been usurped when Astraea became the defactio leader of the Valley) faded into the background to become just any other citizen.  On the archstone the chieftain has a similar profile to the depraved ones, though the depraved ones are much more emaciated."

demonssouls,3bv4ck,bonch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"About the story: it's low fantasy with an undercurrent of Lovecraftian horror. Unlike Dark Souls, the collection of souls from enemies is a prominent part of the narrative. You're warned about the danger of the soul arts; using souls to level up requires consorting with a demon. Each world has an unfolding backstory, and there are interesting revelations near the end regarding the Old One."
demonssouls,3bv4ck,Blakertonpotts,2,Thu Jul 9 20:56:03 2015 UTC,Personally i think demons souls graphics are better than Dark souls.

demonssouls,3bv4ck,Chettlar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:51:11 2015 UTC,"It's a bit older than the other ones, so theirs some polishing they have that it lacks, but if you liked them, I'd give it a shot.  You can't jump because you don't need to jump.  The times you do, just walk against the ledge and you'll climb over it.  As far as things it does that the others don't, it's got some fantastic level design and atmosphere (3-2 is unmatched), and overall it's a great game.  Just remember to suicide in the Nexus every time you gain human form."
demonssouls,3bv4ck,DrHighlen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:44:32 2015 UTC,Demon souls to me is still the better one it just seems fresher.
demonssouls,3bv4ck,bonch,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:32:19 2015 UTC,There is something about it that feels timeless and fresh.
demonssouls,3bv4ck,tensionsmountain,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"Many players prefer DeS to DS1/DS2/BB even when they play it last so you should definitely give it a go IMO.  It probably will seem a bit dated and unpolished in certain respects, but not by as much as you might think. The atmosphere is incredible, the level design is mostly brilliant and if you stop looking at walkthrough videos (!) (and/or reading wikis etc.) it should still prove a mighty challenge too.  Do one or the other IMO. Playing it after watching someone else finish it on your screen would be pointless and will diminish the experience so much that you won't actually ever really know what it was like to play DeS  (As regards the lack of jump, the jump mechanic in DS1 is pretty awful anyway (when viewed objectively). I'm not saying there should not be a jump in DeS, I'm just saying compared to DS1...well you are not exactly missing out on much IMO.)"
demonssouls,3bv4ck,jizundel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:32:17 2015 UTC,"I played them in order, from Demon's Souls to Dark Souls 2 (no PS4, so no Bloodborne), and I love DeS. I played and beat it about two years ago, this week I just completed my first NG+, after beating DkS y DkS2 in the past months.   I don't know if it was because DeS was the game that got me into Souls games, but I think it's the best one in the series. DkS comes really close, but I guess you can't forget your first love. But I think you will definitely enjoy it.   And if you're having doubts, at least I can promise you that it will be better than DkSII."

demonssouls,3bv4ck,TakeRepliesLiterally,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:49:31 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying a playthrough of it after beating all the other Souls games. Id rank it last behind all the other games in the series, but that's still like picking four Goty worthy games and getting to play any of them is very fun.  Its definitely dated and the graphics are the weakest, but only by a small margin. It's got it's own style as well that you may like than the others. Still, I paid for a ps3 just for this and I'd say getting a new Souls game is well worth the price of admission.   Others have mentioned but the jump isn't a problem, maybe weird to get used to it's absence but issues with it."
demonssouls,3bv4ck,sticker14,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:21:40 2015 UTC,"You absolutely need to play Demon's Souls. There's nothing like experiencing a Souls game for the first time.  Demon's is packed with just as many surprises as the other two, where like just when you think you've seen it all something will come out of left field and blow your mind. And that's even if you've played the other two already. Believe me the game has plenty in store even for the most seasoned vet."
demonssouls,3bv4ck,pacman0808,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:29:23 2015 UTC,I think DeS is the best of the souls series as well. Is it just me or is there something about the bodies being left on the ground in DeS that help it's feeling of gloom?

I started out with a black bottom layer, then I went to google and searched smoke with the transparency search tool on. I placed a variety of different kinds of smoke pictures on different layers and rendered them the Same hue of blue. Next I took the box art for demons souls hand had to remove time of the stuff and fix it up then add color multiply which have it the cool blue and black color. Then I made separate layers for each demon and set the opacity low and color dodge effect to make them Blend into the smoke. Finally I took the demons souls logo and put color multiply on it and then it blended with the smoke! If you didn't really understand what I said I'd advise looking at video tutorials online or just playing around with it, that's where I started"

demonssouls,3brbk3,Sentuh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:05:46 2015 UTC,"I checked world tendency after going back to the nexus, and again after warping back to stone fang.  Still nowhere near pure white.  I didn't know about going offline to manipulate until after I'd killed a few bosses and a friend told me about world tendencies.  If I do another game I'll definitely go offline.    Does the online tendency still shift to pure white/black at times?  If so, when is a good time for that to happen?"

demonssouls,3brbk3,illusorywall,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:42:39 2015 UTC,I don't think they do events anymore and online world tendency is affected by an average of all players. never seems to shift much

I believe PB may only happen at Halloween and PW happens around Christmas -> New Years Eve. It should be accompanied by a message at the login when you sign online in Demon's Souls. IIRC they still did the PW shift last year."
demonssouls,3brbk3,Wulf2k,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:07:14 2015 UTC,"When you restart the game, it grabs the online average for world tendency (which is usually around white) and all areas will get set to that tendency when you warp to them from the Nexus.  The only way to prevent this is to do all of your manipulation for an area in one session or to log out of the PSN before starting the game and playing it offline."
demonssouls,3brbk3,Wulf2k,3,Wed Jul 1 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"Close.  When you connect online, your world tendencies go halfway between your current tendency and the server t3ndencies. So if you were pbwt and the servers were pwwt, you'd login and get exactly neutral.  The server tendencies are usually one boss away from pwwt. If you log in and out 8 times that should bring you to average from anywhere, then kill a boss and you're at pwwt."

Flamelurker............................... have fun. In all seriousness, if you are using a sword/melee character, I can only tell you that the best way to fight him is to dodge, not block, and to roll to the side, not backwards, he is tough though, I got to soul level 30 before I beat him. Something I can recommend is this: in 2-2, there is a sword called the Dragon Longsword, get it, it isn't good against flamelurker, but it can help you get another sword which is, you can upgrade the Dragon longsword pretty  far if you have farmed enough materials. use it in world 4-1 to help you get passed the first Red-Eyes knight that you come across and you can get the Crescent Falchion +1, which does magic damage, and I found really effective against Flamelurker."

It has more npcs with better story arcs.  There's a really interesting weapon upgrade system (but the resources required definitely inspire duping...)  I also really like the story of demon's souls; it is the only souls game where the souls mechanic actually make sense as an intrinsic part of the story.  Yes, the world is made of 'levels' instead of fully interconnected, but they are deep and winding with tons of short cuts.  Also, just something about the atmosphere.  It is a nearly perfect game."

demonssouls,3bgryr,SonsofAnarchy113,2,Tue Jun 30 01:31:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Plus you have to quit the game and restart it before the server average will change your tendencies. If you're online and the World Tendwncy looks close enough, you may as well stay online and kill one more boss/BP or suicide in body form to push it all the way.  FYI: dying in the nexus doesn't affect tendency in any way. It's just a safety precaution when going for pure white, so you don't accidentally die in body form anywhere else."
demonssouls,3bh5x7,FaythDarkHeart,2,Mon Jun 29 04:36:45 2015 UTC,I enjoy strength builds with a bit of magic. Get the strong magic shield and some heavy armor and let the attacks bounce off.
demonssouls,3bh5x7,Babel_Triumphant,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:43:33 2015 UTC,"Blueblood Knight with Dark Silver armor and the Blueblood Sword is a really neat playthrough. Could swap out all the luck for faith if you just want to use all of Vinlands stuff for a more cleric-knight approach..  Witch playthrough is fun, too. Yuria's stuff (can be obtained without killing her) and as many spells as you can fit in your memory, try to only use spells if at all possible, it has its own level of difficulty (especially in later Souls games. Doing one in DS2 right now and it's incredibly frustrating in a whole new way)  Then an old monk/generic invader build, though I'm not gonna give any recommendations since I've PvP'd the least in DeS out of all Souls games.  And a generic co-op build, which again, someone else will have to clarify. But it's a great to have a character to hop on for the bosses people always need help on, like Flame Lurker/Maneaters/Allant."
demonssouls,3bh5x7,ninthbelief,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:23:44 2015 UTC,I just started a Mage run with focus on Magic and Faith and its really great to play. Choose the Royalty class and kill the first boss instantly. then go to 4-1 to get the crescent falchion +1 and the Talisman of God. After that you can already get Flame toss from Freke's apprentice at the Nexus. Now you have already a good dmg output. you can even get enchanted weapon and use any weapon you like with it.

You will find items in one world that is useful in another. Getting the rings that gives less aggro and more hp as dead are very useful. Magic in this game is easy mode."
demonssouls,3bcb50,fraggelsmurf,5,Sun Jun 28 01:03:25 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that magic is ""easy mode"", but that's a relative term. It's still freaking hard."
demonssouls,3bcb50,UltimaGabe,2,Sun Jun 28 07:37:55 2015 UTC,"You will find some mechanics that doesn't exist on Dark Souls, like item burden, only two types of rolls (above or below 50% weight)...  You're not considering that the types of damage in this game can really make the difference. Every enemy is weak to a type of damage, but very strong against another. And I'm including bosses as well. In Stonefang, enemies are strong against physical attacks (with normal weapons), but are very weak to bows or magic attacks (with spells or enchanted weapons).  In Demon's Souls, the worlds aren't connected between them, and that if you feel stuck in a world, you should prove yourself in another one. There is no obligation in clearing an area in order to go to another (except for the tutorial and the first level fo the game, 1-1)."
demonssouls,3bcb50,Sentuh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:34:40 2015 UTC,"It depends how you're playing the game. Typically after beating 1-1 a lot of people beat 4-1. The boss is pretty easy, plus there's a short cut. That level has the Crescent Falchion in it too which I highly recommend. It'll give you a boost in the right direction.  The spider in 2-1 is easy if you have a bow. It's cheap but I don't care. You just sit in the far left corner with the Thiefs ring and spam arrows at him. Again if you want quick level ups, bosses are the key to that.   1-2 you will encounter a dragon (If you haven't already) mid level. You can also spam arrows at him for some quick points. And the boss of that level is also pretty easy.   but yeah take your pick."
demonssouls,3bcb50,The_Axem_Ranger,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"I encountered the two dragons sitting at a hill just chilling , i fought the tower knight and got my shit kicked in and i haven't gotten the thief's ring and don' t know how to . And btw there was this good guy helping me in the palace before i killed the phalanx i don't know if he's dead or alive but will i meet him again"
demonssouls,3bcb50,UltimaGabe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:56:31 2015 UTC,"Getting the Thief's Ring is actually kind of lame- as in, the method the developers wanted you to use is very counter-intuitive. It's sitting on the ledge where you met Ostrava (the ""good guy"" you mentioned)- when you come down the staircase right after the very first blue-eyed knight in 1-1, there's a part of the wall you can climb over by pressing forward and X (but it looks identical to the rest of the wall, so there's no indication you can climb over it, and this is a mechanic that's only used a few times in the game, and never with a wall such as this one). Or, you can go up the stairs a bit and roll off over the wall, but that's a bit trickier since you can die if you miss the ledge.  As for meeting Ostrava again, thoroughly check the room directly after the Phalanx boss (where several of the Hoplite enemies- the black goopy shield/spear things). You'll get a clue as to what predicament he's in."
demonssouls,3bcb50,TalentedJuli,2,Sun Jun 28 07:35:52 2015 UTC,"You don't have to press X to climb over the wall, you just walk into it, and this mechanic is used all over the place with waist-high walls.  I think also it's explained in the manual or tutorial or something?  It seemed perfectly intuitive to me, anyways."
demonssouls,3bcb50,UltimaGabe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:38:51 2015 UTC,"My mistake on the X thing. The reason it's unintuitive is because if you walk to any other part of the wall, you can't climb over it. The game only lets you climb up one specific part of the wall. Also, it's used in other places of the game, but for ledges, not walls; every other time it's used, it's to climb onto a ledge where you continue walking at the height of the ledge. I can think of about a dozen places in the game where being able to climb over a waist-high wall would have cut out huge sections of the game, but it's not possible, except in this one instance."
demonssouls,3bcb50,TalentedJuli,2,Sun Jun 28 13:08:34 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, it's also possible to hop over a wall in 1-3 and 4-1."
demonssouls,3bcb50,UltimaGabe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:20:23 2015 UTC,Can you be a bit more specific? Maybe I just never found those ones.
demonssouls,3bcb50,TalentedJuli,2,Sun Jun 28 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"In 1-3, all over the place IIRC.  There are a lot of drops there where you can hop over a ledge.  Of particular note, there's a shortcut to the gate lever.  In 4-1 it's kind of hard to get, and probably not intended tbh, but it's by the rolley-polley skeleton guarding the two archers at the top of the fog gate.  There's a small section where you can step up onto the ledge, then drop down from there into a hard-to-reach area.  Fun for trolling invaders by hiding there."
demonssouls,3bcb50,UltimaGabe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"Huh, I honestly didn't know about those. (I was thinking of a few spots in 1-3 and the parapets of 4-1, in fact, as some of the areas where I felt the game would benefit from climbing over ledges.) I guess it's not as poorly-implemented as I thought- though I still imagine not many people know about it. I just checked several videos of how to get the Thief Ring on Youtube, and not one of them mentions climbing over the ledge (the all show how to roll off the stairs, which is how I always did it)."
demonssouls,3bcb50,TalentedJuli,2,Sun Jun 28 16:52:30 2015 UTC,"I roll off the stairs as well, but I only started doing that after seeing it in a speed run :P  IDK, it just seemed really intuitively obvious to me on my first playthrough to walk over the ledge.  I don't remember why, I just remember I had no trouble figuring it out.  And in 5 years of playing the game and discussing it, I've never heard anybody bring it up until now."
demonssouls,3bcb50,TalentedJuli,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"Armor Spider is not far from the archstone if you opened up the elevator shortcut by Ed.  It's a Pinwheel-tier boss, just give it another couple tries and you should get it.  I think it was the only boss I got on my first try   The miners in Stonefang Mine are really resistant to normal, slashing, and blunt damage for some reason.  Get a weapon with thrusting damage.  There's a developer message at the start of the level that tells you as much.  2-1 is a great place to go after 1-1 because it has lots of upgrade materials.  It's worth playing through some of 2-2 to get materials, but 2-2's boss is one of the hardest in the series."

demonssouls,3b4mdf,abyssalhorror1,2,Thu Jun 25 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"World Tendency:  First, from white to black, you have:   Pure White World Tendency (PWWT) or White +3: white tendency events happen at this point. White Tendency +2 (Neutral) White Tendency +1 (Neutral) No tendencies (How you start the game) Black Tendency +1 Black Tendency +2 Black Tendency +3: Near to PBWT, primeval demons appear. Pure Black World Tendency (PBWT) or Black +4: black tendency events happen at this point.   Notice that there are 4 levels of black tendency, while white tendency has 3 levels.  White tendency: easier gameplay but less rewards except for healing items. Also attack power in soul form increases. The events at PWWT can be seen in the wiki for more info.  Black tendency: harder gameplay but more rewards (souls and drop rates). At PBWT, primeval demons and black phantoms will appear in the world, but as I have said, better look the wiki for more info.  -How to get pure tendencies?  Well, to get PWWT, the easiest way is killing the three bosses of the area. Each one gives you +1 white tendency, so if you kill the three demons, 1 + 1 + 1 = +3 White tendency, so you have PWWT.  About PBWT, the easiest way to do it is killing yourself. In the wiki (the 'wikidot' one) you'll see a table where the number of deaths required to get PBWT is shown. From PWWT, you'll need 7 deaths in body form, and from a neutral point, 4-6. Note that if you die in soul form, it will not shift tendency.  In online, the tendencies vary, so the best for manipulating then is being offline. Although I'm not the best for talking about tendencies and how online interaction changes them :S"
demonssouls,3b4mdf,Sentuh,2,Thu Jun 25 23:00:27 2015 UTC,"In online, the tendencies vary, so the best for manipulating then is being online.   WARNING: THIS IS NOT TRUE. AT ALL. IF YOU ARE MANIPULATING WORLD TENDENCY, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO IT OFFLINE.   No tendencies (How you start the game)   Not entirely accurate. If you start the game online, or you ever connect to the online server, it will shift you towards the server average, which is virtually always just below Pure White. I doubt many players will ever start the game at Neutral World Tendency.  Also, just to emphasize and clarify for OP, only dying while in Body Form shifts World Tendency towards black. So if you kill a boss (granting you Body Form), and you are trying to get Pure White, I recommend immediately going to the Nexus and killing yourself there. (That way, when you inevitably die in the level, it will have no bearing on your World Tendency.) If you are trying to reach Pure Black, however, you will need to spend several Stones of Ephemeral Eyes- they're fairly easy to farm after the first few stages, but early on they will be in low supply.   I wrote a big long explanation about the best way to get to the various World & Character Tendencies in the shortest number of playthroughs (which I can link if necessary) but in general, you should ALWAYS play the game in offline mode, and ALWAYS go for Pure White first (for both World Tendency and Character Tendency). Otherwise you're going to have a much harder time than is necessary."

If you save Biorr he can draw the fire breath as well but it's still pretty difficult to get the right path."
demonssouls,3b0ays,Nampahc,4,Wed Jun 24 23:19:49 2015 UTC,"If you freed Biorr, he'll lure the dragon to help you pass. He will not survive if you don't kill it.  You can pass his breath. The dragon breaths from left to right, then right to left and repeat. Practice and you'll pass.  If you want to kill it, you'll have to bring a lot of arrows and a decent bow. Sticky compound short bow +5 is the best option IMO. A good strategy is stay right under the dragon and autotarget. Then don't stop shooting."

And the Kris Blade kicks ass if you're using some sort of mage build (Since it boosts spells).  I'm sure most weapons can be pretty great pending how you use them and level up. The Long Bow for instance did everything I needed it to, until I discovered the Lava Bow worked better. But yeah, experiment, find your style.

Also, don't forget to repair weapons and armor or to drop things off with the stockpile dude in the nexus.  He's like the bottomless.box, except that you need it more.in this game because you can only carry so much before the game won't let you pick up loot anymore.

There are lots of different upgrade stones for weapons in this one, don't be afraid to look up what each one is.   Lastly, everyone (seemingly) hates the Flamelurker boss (or at least has difficulty with him) the first time they face him. Me included. I only beat him a week ago, I just started Demon's Souls as well. You'll get him eventually!  EDIT: Also, world tendency runs the special events of the game, from NPC invasions to other world events.

Btw, you will find some mechanics that doesn't exist on Dark Souls, like item burden, only two types of rolls (above or below 50% weight)...  It's also important to notice that the types of damage in this game can really make the difference. Every enemy is weak to a type of damage, but very strong against another. And I'm including bosses as well.  Surely you'll be interested in the whole 'World tendecies' thing. I always recommend to don't care for the first playthrought, and explore it in later ones, when you have more knowledge about the game. If you're interested I can explain this.  Finally, there isn't a unique direction like in Dark Souls. Saying this I mean that in Demon's Souls, the worlds aren't connected between them, and that if you feel stuck in a world, you should prove yourself in another one. There is no obligation in clearing an area in order to go to another (except for the tutorial and the first level fo the game, 1-1).  If you accidentally attack an NPC, you will have to kill him. You can't make peace with them. Be careful!!!"

Don't worry about it on the first play through. Looking it up and reading about it will spoil things.  Item Burden. You can't carry everything. Figure out a way you don't have to carry everything. Nothing worse then being out there and you can't pick something up because you are carrying too much weight.  No forgiveness for hitting an NPC  Have fun.

demonssouls,3awauv,BMatt95,2,Wed Jun 24 00:43:47 2015 UTC,"One tip that may help you out is to fight them by the brazier, so that you can use that to help block attacks. They also seem to attack 1 at a time (for me, at least) when doing this method. Also, the Dark Silver Shield may help you with the Maneater's magic attacks, which can be found in World 5."

demonssouls,3awauv,xelone,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:15:02 2015 UTC,Usually you want to beat the first one as quickly as possible. You can get the first one down to 20% health (or 100 seconds) before the second one comes down.  I used a magic blocking shield to help out.
demonssouls,3awauv,gunnermcgavin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:50:06 2015 UTC,"You enter, let him come at you, then dodge by him and get to the brazier. Kite him round that and attack when possible, but don't get greedy. When the other one shows up, run to the opposite end. Hopefully they'll only attack one at a time. If they both come at you, run to the opposite end.  Dont try to take both on. Be aggressive when you can. If you show too much respect, you'll drag it on and fuck up anyway. rise and repeat."

demonssouls,3agbgj,syles101,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:36:20 2015 UTC,Personally I find the levels themselves to be harder than DS1 but the bosses easier.
demonssouls,3agbgj,Maytown,2,Mon Jun 22 23:53:13 2015 UTC,Expect a good time.
demonssouls,3agbgj,If9lp8p,2,Sat Jun 20 01:19:44 2015 UTC,"It's not harder like everybody is saying. You've finished two souls games so the third will be a walk in the park. The environment will still get you, and so will a few enemies and bosses, but you will mostly find it kind of easy.   Magic is pretty op, so if you want a slightly harder challenge go with faith or something. Pyromancy is a part of magic, not its own thing.   There isnt an open world bonfire system. Instead there is the Nexus (the hub) and five 'doorways' into five different worlds. Each world has 4 or 5 stages and bosses, and the only 'bonfires' (forget what Demons calls it) are at the start of each stage. You dont have to finish each world before moving on. If one world is too hard you can go back to the Nexus and try a different world.   There's a thing called white and black world tendency, and it changes certain things in the game depending on which tendency you have. I wouldn't worry about it on your first run.  And that's pretty much it off the top of my head, you would have figured all this out anyway.   Happy demon hunting."
demonssouls,3agbgj,urethral_lobotomy,2,Sat Jun 20 09:34:05 2015 UTC,"I just started after beating DS1. I beat most bosses so far on the first or second try, so about the same or slightly easier than Dark Souls (haven't had a moment yet where I felt cheated). The only real difference is the lack of jumping ability.   OH. It also took me far too long to figure out that you can climb up waist high ledges by walking into them. Like Zelda style.  Good luck."
demonssouls,3agbgj,AlvisDBridges,3,Sat Jun 20 20:27:08 2015 UTC,"If you have played the other games, there's more chance that Demon's Souls will be easy for you.  Btw, you will find some mechanics that doesn't exist on Dark Souls, like item burden, only two types of rolls (above or below 50% weight)...  It's also important to notice that the types of damage in this game can really make the difference. Every enemy is weak to a type of damage, but very strong against another. And I'm including bosses as well.  Surely you'll be interested in the whole 'World tendecies' thing. I always recommend to don't care for the first playthrought, and explore it in later ones, when you have more knowledge about the game. If you're interested I can explain this.  Finally, there isn't a unique direction like in Dark Souls. Saying this I mean that in Demon's Souls, the worlds aren't connected between them, and that if you feel stuck in a world, you should prove yourself in another one. There is no obligation in clearing an area in order to go to another (except for the tutorial and the first level fo the game, 1-1).  Edit: Also, if you accidentally attack an NPC, you will have to kill him. You can't make peace with them. Be careful!!!  Edit2lol: There are many types of upgrading stones. Sharpstone, hardstone, darkmoonstone... It's similar to the color titanites, but a little more complex."
demonssouls,3agbgj,Sentuh,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:50:07 2015 UTC,"To expand a bit on the item burden part, if you plan on using a bow, arrows count towards your burden, so carrying 400 arrows is a bad plan."
demonssouls,3agbgj,grumpy_derpasaur,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:22:48 2015 UTC,So are you forced to go naked if you plan on carrying heavy weapons?
demonssouls,3agbgj,SnackRelatedMishap,3,Sun Jun 21 01:51:50 2015 UTC,"Because there's no midroll in this game, you can have a fastroll with a heavy weapon while wearing armor, provided you've leveled END sufficiently and/or are wearing the equivalent of Havel's Ring."
demonssouls,3agbgj,Maytown,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:17:24 2015 UTC,Item burden and equip burden are two different things so no.  Also as others mentioned you get light roll under 50% equip which is great.
demonssouls,3agbgj,TalentedJuli,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:55:05 2015 UTC,"No.  Equip burden in Demon's Souls is pretty irrelevant for the most part.  Basically most really heavy equipment is not worth using over light equipment.  Heavy armor for example is barely better than light armor, so you just wear light armor.  Tower Shield is not really worth using over the much lighter Purple Flame Shield.  The heaviest piece of equipment that's really worth using is the Dragon Bone Smasher, at 20 lbs.  By the time you hit 40 endurance to cap out your stamina, you'll have 34.5 lbs of equip burden to work with while fast rolling."

demonssouls,3agbgj,TalentedJuli,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:34:52 2015 UTC,Meaning there aren't variations in their movesets or the weapons have fewer varieties?
demonssouls,3agbgj,TalentedJuli,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"Just less weapons as a whole. For example, there's an entire candystore of weapons in DSI & DSII, but in DeS, it's like you came late to the Black Friday sale and all the shop-keep can do is give you sad look of pitiful understanding and lets you comb over the rusty, beaten crap on the wall left over after the vultures picked it clean. Where as you might find, like 20+ greatswords in the DS games, you might find like 7 in DeS, with 2 of them being unique."

demonssouls,3a99re,yoodidoo,5,Thu Jun 18 15:00:03 2015 UTC,"If you're doing it without any kind of item duplication, it takes at least 3.5 playthroughs, so up til half of NG+++ (only have to do worlds 3 & 5 iirc)  :p  The thing about DeS though is world tendency and character tendency coming into play which makes platinuming it a tiny bit more complicated, but everything's detailed in the wiki when you're done with a blind playthrough."
demonssouls,3a99re,UltimaGabe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"Technically you could get platinum with only NG+, if you're playing multiple characters.

When you go back and fight him after being a souls veteran the challenge isn't really there so much.  But yeah unlocking 2-2 early will help you get OP upgrades from a blacksmith so you're in a really good position.

Sage Freke just wanted to see magic reach new heights. When I played a Magician, I found a massive respect for him.   Hmmmmm... Yurt was a dick. Thanks for the dope ass armor, shit weasel.

demonssouls,3a8mii,ninjaboiz,2,Thu Jun 18 07:35:39 2015 UTC,Patches is a lovable rascal.

demonssouls,3a8mii,FLRSH,2,Sun Jun 21 01:21:28 2015 UTC,Got the game last weekend and so far the False King and the Penetrator take my hate.  I've had no problem with any boss in this and until False King. Beat them all on the second try at the very least. Most of them on the first. But False King... I've spent the past few hours trying to kill him. Mostly because I waste time in between deaths either trying to invade or get summoned.  The only reason I hate the Penetrator is because he got to kill the Fat Official before I could.

demonssouls,3a8jyd,YharnamResident,6,Thu Jun 18 02:02:15 2015 UTC,"Demon's Souls is generally a lot smoother, yeah. It's still just 30, but it stays at 30 a lot better than DS does. Probably a result of it being PS3-exclusive, so they have less optimization work."
demonssouls,3a8jyd,butterfly1763,2,Thu Jun 18 02:05:32 2015 UTC,"Great, thank you very much!"
demonssouls,3a8jyd,guardian_owl,3,Thu Jun 18 02:07:44 2015 UTC,I'm guessing Blight town? That area performed pretty poorly on both consoles.  I think the only time I remember Demon's Souls slowing down is if there are a lot of fire explosions on the screen at once.
demonssouls,3a8jyd,kratosgow342,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:09:24 2015 UTC,overall Demon's Souls is smoother than Dark Souls it have some drop when it have much particle effect or briefly when you break stuff but no Blighttown framerate but beware though Valley of Defilement can be more challenging than Blighttown.
demonssouls,3a8jyd,sticker14,0,Mon Jun 22 04:23:07 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, the 360 versions of Dark Souls is smoother than the PS3 version. Demon's Souls is much smoother than both though."

If you're killing the NPCs then you only get one black phantom per world so it does matter in that sense.  Also, the NPCs are worth half the tendency value of a player (judging by the Wiki's description), so you need twice as many (or two playthroughs, to get 2 phantoms in each world)."

My only other suggestion would be to try 1-3, 4-1 and 4-2 at around SL 30-35.

Just wait till around October-November there's actually a big annual return to the Nexus event where nearly everyone commits to either starting a brand new character to go through the game at the same time or low level invading and stuff for those people who wants that extra invasion challenge in the levels themselves.  It actually gets near peak levels of activity again for a while with constant invasions and being invaded!  :D"
demonssouls,39t2l9,SnowTurtleRaveTaco,7,Sun Jun 14 14:30:11 2015 UTC,"You could do a few things.   If you want you could be cheap and kill one of them through the fog gate with a bow before the fight. That always works.   As for fighting them for real my answer would be to first upgrade your weapon a bit so you don't have such an uphill battle. You could also target the tail and cut it off so they can't do as much to you.   My main tip for you is to use that dish of fire in the middle. It's your god send. Keep your enemy in sight, while targeted, and strafe around the flame. He should always be across from you. Sometimes he'll come in for a dash or do that weird soundwave looking attack. Just step back when he does that. If he does do the dash he'll over extend and give you a couple free seconds to get close and take a swing. That's how I've been beating him for years and seems to work just fine."

demonssouls,39t2l9,The_Axem_Ranger,4,Mon Jun 15 00:31:33 2015 UTC,You can buy shards of darkmoonstone from a vendor you find in the first level of the shrine of storms. The reapers in the second level of the shrine of storms will also drop shards and chunks of darkmoonstone which will help you pump up the weapon to lvl 4. That will boost its damage by over +70%.  The Maneater is also very weak against fire so using that dragon longsword or quick firing fire magic is also a good idea.
demonssouls,39t2l9,guardian_owl,2,Sun Jun 14 18:30:06 2015 UTC,I would say your weapon is weak but if you are falling off so much it doesn't matter. Don't stand next to the edge.
demonssouls,39t2l9,filterforshit,2,Sun Jun 14 14:56:26 2015 UTC,"You could always upgrade your Falchion. Just keep learning their moves, leveling, and possibly reach +3 on your falchion."
demonssouls,39t2l9,300zxTwinTurbo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:56:49 2015 UTC,"31 is honestly kind of low; I usually fight them later in the game.  Unless you really want loot from 3-3 I highly recommend coming back and doing Latria later.  A +1 C.Falchion is not bad, but could be a lot better.  Depending on your build another easy weapon like the Dragon Longsword from 2-2 might be a better option too.  I would at least finish Stonefang and Shrine of Storms before Maneater if I were you."
demonssouls,39t2l9,motrya,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:55:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe level up and ungrade your weapon a bit more first. And once you're on the bridge with them, when they gear up to attack, make sure you position your character parallel to the bridge, so getting knocked back will provide you plenty of surface to land on. Also, once both show up, use the fire sconces to kite them, and attack one when the other periodically flies away. When they both fly away at the same time, use it to catch a breath and use any items you need to to prepare."

Because honestly maneater is one of if not the hardest boss and the world aren't in any specific order. I would suggest doing the first level of each world first, except maybe world 5. 1-2 and 2-2 are also somewhat easy. 4-2 is pretty hard and 3-2 is alright up until the boss (as you have found). 4-2 is pretty damn hard and 5-2 isn't much harder than 5-1, you just need to make sure you can cure poison."

I still love Dex, but Str would've left so many more options and made it so much easier."
demonssouls,39sz8h,motrya,2,Sun Jun 14 14:09:54 2015 UTC,"Get the Crescent Falchion in Shrine of Storms (first stage) and the game is now on easy mode pretty much.  At least, since you have so much experience with Souls it will be.  You can easily farm most of its upgrade materials in the next stage by killing reapers.  Also, the Thief's Ring (found in 1-1) makes enemies ignore you after you walk away a certain distance.  Like, they literally can't tell you are there.  It's absurdly abusive.  Archery builds are a lot of fun because of this."

demonssouls,39sz8h,Maytown,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:54:31 2015 UTC,I did a melee focused faith build for my third playthrough.  It was a lot of fun.  Not as much damage output as my Dex or Int builds but very tanky thanks to all the HP regen from adjudicator shield/blessed weapon (crescent axe)/healing ring.

demonssouls,39sz8h,Cronotis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:43:18 2015 UTC,There's a couple control issues I have with DS1 that prevent it from being my favorite.   One being that you can't roll when you're sprinting.  Can't tell you how many times I was desperately trying to get away from something and ended up jumping right into an attack instead of rolling through one.  The other is that if you're locked on you're rolls are related to the position of the target.  For example if you roll sideways you sort of roll around someone instead of just going sideways.  This also got me killed a bunch of times as I would roll sideways in an attempt to put some distance between me and the target only to hug up along side them and have them rotate mid swing right into me.  I think DeS and DS2 both handle this stuff in a way that clicks with me much better.
demonssouls,39sz8h,bonch,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:36:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  If you are bold, try going to Valley of Defilement early.  There is a Blessed Mace there that is great for Faith builds.  Just be aware there is no Lightning Spear in this game (and only one offensive Miracle) so you will be relying on Blessed weapons for damage if you are investing heavily in Faith probably.  Fire weapons aren't bad either, though."
demonssouls,39sz8h,Cronotis,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:03:44 2015 UTC,"Item Burden: Is a stat that is tied to Vitality.  It's a limit to how much stuff you can have in your inventory at a given time.  There’s an NPC in the Nexus whom you can give excess inventory to.  There’s also a ring you can get that will increase your Item Burden.  I won’t spoil how to get, but you’ll probably come across it even if you’re playing blind.  I recommend carrying this ring with you all the time but only putting it on if you’re close to your limit and need to ferry something back to the Nexus.  Keep in mind that if you try to pick up something that would overburden you and find that you can’t then you’ll have to leave it, or something else you’re currently carrying, behind and it’ll be lost for good.  NPC Hostility: There is no way to make amends with an NPC you’ve pissed off.  Be careful of setting down your controller and accidentally attacking an NPC you’re standing in front of.  That said, many NPCs have a relatively high damage threshold for making them hostile.  Armor: Armor can’t be upgraded and therefor is less useful the more you play the game.  In addition heavier armor is much less Def/Weight efficient than lighter armor and carries a stamina re-gen penalty.  WT/CT:  I wouldn’t worry too much about World Tendency and Character Tendency on a first play-through.  Weapon Upgrades:  The weapon upgrade system in DeS can be confusing to a new player.  Even if you’re genrally playing blind this might be something you’ll want to look up on the wiki or ask some questions about here.  Builds:  Nothing special to note here.  Different people may tell you that ""build x"" is op, but if you've played other Souls games you should be able to figure out what you'll enjoy playing and do well with that."

demonssouls,39mpcp,Funklord_Earl,3,Fri Jun 12 23:50:38 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, no.  I didn't one-try every boss, of course. Maneaters took me about five, Old Hero took three or so, Flamelurker I did actually get in one go - somehow. Armor Spider was just confusing until I figured out how to kill it, not really frustrating or difficult. And for some reason Tower Knight was a thorn in my side for about three tries. I don't really consider myself stuck on a boss unless it takes upwards of 10 tries, similar to O&S or fucking Freja.  I've already played and beaten all the other SoulsBorne games, so I did have my skills from there. I also tend to be... not intimidated by things in games. I like to experiment and learn how things work, and explore to figure out how to get to everything. I'm methodical, so that definitely has something to do with it."

This was around 2010 and I'd never even thought of looking online for a Wiki for advice/info. My build was a mess, I didn't truly understand the combat system (I only finished the game because I was lucky enough to realise the immense value of the Warding spell) and I never summoned/got invaded once despite the fact that the game was very busy because I didn't understand the soul/body form distinction with regards to online play.

demonssouls,39bw9y,VeryEuropean,6,Wed Jun 10 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"Also if you log online it will reset all of your tendencies to the server average, which is usually white (not pure white).

Killing a boss (at least, all tested ones so far) gives 60 tendency.  Add the two together, and you're above 180 (200 cap).  Return to Nexus, return to the world, and Pure White will take effect.  Do what you want to do.  Kill the NPC that appears at 180+ tendency.  Assuming you were at cap (200) you will lose 180 tendency, leaving you at 20.  Use an eye, kill yourself in body form, lose 60, leaving you at -40.  Kill yourself 3 more times with 3 more eyes, you're at (3*-60= -180 + -40) = -200 capped, pure black.  Return to Nexus, return to world, do pure black."

demonssouls,39bw9y,tensionsmountain,2,Wed Jun 10 19:31:18 2015 UTC,Yes.  Killing two bosses will get you to Pure White so long as you take advantage of the online server average to get yourself back to somewhat white. Disconnect and reconnect to the server a few times until your WT settles at somewhat white. Then go offline and stay offline and play only in soul form (don't make the same mistake again after killing either of the next two bosses) and after you kill the final boss you will have PWWT.  Best of luck!
demonssouls,398okk,Shadow50000,5,Wed Jun 10 01:36:54 2015 UTC,"I recently beat Demon's Souls for the first time after beating Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 numerous times.   I made a strength/faith character and after beating the Tower Knight I went through the Stonefang archstone and beat all the bosses there, then I went to the Shrine of Storms archstone (4th archstone, I didn't know the 3rd was up top) and beat all the bosses there as well. I used the Adjudicator boss soul to make the Meat Cleaver, and ran through the game pretty quickly with it.  If you're just looking to beat the game fairly quickly, I would recommend using the Meat Cleaver, but I felt using such an OP weapon took a bit of the experience away from the game.   Still a fantastic game, and I plan on running through it again without to meat cleaver, and exploring more to get the most out of the game."

Another advice is to considerate how types of damage work in this game. In Demon's Souls, they can make a real difference. For example, trying to beat world 2 with physical attacks is notably hardest than doing it with magical attacks, which are extremely useful against the scale miners.  And explore. Always explore. Exploring gives big rewards."

Alternately, get a good bow and kill them at a distance."
demonssouls,398okk,Elaine_Benes_,2,Wed Jun 10 17:36:26 2015 UTC,"Ha, this would explain why my melee only playthrough is going so crazily."
demonssouls,398okk,Kozma37,2,Wed Jun 10 11:02:31 2015 UTC,You can do a mellow only playthrough and tear everything apart. Pay attention to enemy weaknesses to the type of weapon dmg you are doing. Like the Uchigatana does normal type dmg with R1 and pierce type with R2. Learning ur enemies weakness to types of dmg is a really good way to make ur life easier.   But then again if ur a Mage u will tear everything apart. Pretty much every enemy and boss in Demons has huge weakness to magic dmg.
demonssouls,398okk,Elaine_Benes_,3,Wed Jun 10 12:19:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my first character was Royalty and it wasn't a ton of fun. I just started to do this character for my world tendency playthrough"

demonssouls,398okk,Kozma37,4,Wed Jun 10 13:48:53 2015 UTC,"Use a bow/crossbow in tower of Latria if the octo heads give u grief. Poke them from range. When they notice u, run out of agro range, then rinse repeat till they are dead. You will need to carry at least 200 arrows or bolts on you for this.   Also, like /u/Sentuh said, the enemies in Demons Soul have huge weaknesses to certain elements or type of weapon dmg. Each ""world"" has its own specific. For example in world 2-1 you should 100% use a pierce weapon. Bow/crossbow is alright for them too. Using a normal or slash dmg weapon is gimping urself hard lol."
demonssouls,398okk,The_Axem_Ranger,2,Wed Jun 10 08:06:39 2015 UTC,"The way you feel about Demon's Souls is how I feel about Bloodborne. I just can't get a hang of it.   As for how to beat the Octopus heads. If you have a bow you can play defensively. Though the main way I beat them is with magic. And if you dare you can use melee. Which I would use a stick and move strategy, since you don't want to get stunned by their green light attack."
demonssouls,398okk,Kozma37,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:17:29 2015 UTC,Melee works on those guys but only if you can kill them in 2-3 hits. Having a really good backstab weapon is amazing for these guys too. Run into their back as they are walking away from you and you can take em out pretty easily. Risky though.
demonssouls,398okk,Elaine_Benes_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:08:39 2015 UTC,Thus is what I ended up doing running to the boss a few times last night. Just run directly up to octopus heads and backstab. Especially if they aren't facing you. They do a slowww turn. If you can kill them in two hits you can just bash the crap out of them. If you're in a hallway you can lure them to the end of it.
demonssouls,398okk,Kozma37,2,Wed Jun 10 11:04:33 2015 UTC,"Yep. In NG+ till NG+4 all I used it Morion blade and clever rat ring to snipe these guys down with lava bow. Took 2 arrows usually. 3 arrows later on. Or one quick backstab lol. Fun way to clear these guys, especially if you have second chance/makoto(for health control) and thief  ring so they don't notice u as easily. You can run around as a rogue archer and just snipe almost everything from the shadows."

demonssouls,398okk,tensionsmountain,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:55:38 2015 UTC,Do you mean the regular octopus head guards ('mindflayers' fyi)  or specifically the BP ones in 3-3? Because everyone struggles with the ones in 3-3 at first. It's a tricky spot but using the wall as another poster recommended works very well.  The regular ones I'd actually recommend fighting melee. Their soul ray is fast and hits hard so magic/bow can be risky. Two-hand a fast weapon and unload a full stamina bar on them and they should remained stunned until you stop swinging and they are dead.  This method is a bit more risky with the BP mindflayers as they have a lot of HP and if you run out of stamina you might get paralysed and die. It depends on your DPS basically. (You can also knock them down over and over again with a very large weapon.)

It's a great media friendly device too. i just upgraded to PS4 last month and am seriously underwhelmed by the xmb, the wi-fi reciever,  and it's connectivity in comparison to PS3  I'd say get one all day, but I think it's the greatest console of all time, so I'm a biased."

It's over way too quickly to be much fun and to even really establish who is the better player. Sure a VIT build can increase your survivability whilst in hyper mode significantly but unless your opponent is running the same build the advantage is way too stacked in your favour IMO. (And if your opponent is also using a VIT build in why not just drop the whole hyper mode thing and play without it?)  The fact that you are even asking might indicate that you aren't satisfied that your wins are down to you playing better than your opponents. If your wins are not down to you playing better than your opponents, what's the point?  But play however you want. I would play with you anyway tbh. PvP is rare enough these days.

A spear+7 is probably a bit weak for that stage of the game but if you buffed it with SWS I bet it would also suffice.  The last time I fought him I two-handed the magic sword makoto and that tore him up.  You probably know this but if you free Biorr you barely have to do anything in that fight.

You'll always be able to get low-mid SL invasions but I'm assuming you mean SL 120-125 PvP. You might get the occasional invasion or see a red sign every once in a while, but unless someone is streaming or there's an event, 4-1 is going to be pretty dead. The game is nearly 6 years old.

I wait way to long to do some actions (because I don't have the guts to do risky actions) and the game shouldn't let me do that and be 100% safe. Oh, and I don't use dodge for avoiding hits at all. Also the bosses let me heal safely, even the Flamelurker has this backward jumping move which gives me all the time I need to heal fully. This isn't the case with most Dark Souls I and II bosses. With those you PRAY that they let you heal. BUT I didn't kill Flamelurker yet, mind you. He's actually challenging. Predictable as hell though."

Just dump all your stones to Stockpile and it'll automatically show up when going to a blacksmith. My first playthrough, I kept dropping weapons and the like to carry stones back and forth between Stockpile and Blacksmith. I feel like a fool...   If you find the Jade Hair thingie and give it to Stockpile, he will give you a ring that boosts your item burden limits."

Also, as another point of interest, I'd like to know what World Tendency values you have after loading your game online, going to any world and then back to the nexus, then reading your save.

To get to pure black, farm some stones and suicide a bunch of times.  To get to pure white from pure black, kill the primeval demon, the black phantom, and one boss.  If you're online, your tendency will reset to some random value the first time you visit the nexus after every time you quit the game."

demonssouls,38fbc8,iNeedScissorsSixty7,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:57:06 2015 UTC,"Of course you can.  But the trophies only count for the host.  So you essentially have to co-op the game twice if you both want platinum.  Since there is some farming involved to get some of the trophies it might be kind of awkward and difficult to get them all playing purely co-op though.  Edit: Yeah, now that I think about it platinum will be basically impossible to get if you play online at all because of how difficult it is to control your ""world tendency"" when you play online.  But you should still try co-oping through the game though, you'll get most of the trophies just from beating the bosses."

Will the world tendency stuff make much of a difference if my buddy and I are making an effort to keep it uniform with each other? We will be chatting in a Skype call the entire playthrough to coordinate and I won't be summoning anyone else.
demonssouls,38fbc8,Snoahpeas,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:27:33 2015 UTC,"If one of you dies more (or less) than the other then their world tendency will be different.  It won't affect gameplay that much, but it will make getting trophies complicated if you're trying to stay at the same pace the whole time.  You probably won't be able to get all the trophies in one playthrough anyway.  Honestly, trying to platinum this game with a buddy is just asking for frustration, why not just play through it and enjoy it for what it is?"

demonssouls,38a5ne,Funklord_Toejam,24,Tue Jun 2 22:27:04 2015 UTC,"The sword wielding one, Metas, gives you the PENETRATING sword. The one with the lance, Alfred, gives you the TOWER SHIELD. Those two are very obvious.  Then there's Long Bow Oolan. She had the control of a legion of soldiers, who protected her while she was shooting her bow. The demon Phalanx represents this perfectly: little minions who defend a big one, who leads them. Also, Phalanx gives you the 'Lead' Soul. Ostrava talks about Long Bow Oolan as a male, but is a she. As Ostrava also changes the role of Vallarfax and Biorr, it's probably an error, or maybe the developers wanted Ostrava to be wrong.  Basically, those three knights of Allant fought the invasion by the demons, but they failed. Their souls were corrupted so they defended the False King and finally, a demonic version of each appeared: Phalanx, Tower Knight and Penetrator."

demonssouls,38a5ne,Funklord_Toejam,7,Tue Jun 2 22:47:12 2015 UTC,"There's some dialogue in the game (Ostrava, I think?) who mentions three warriors who were prized in Boletaria: Alfred, Metas, and Oolan. The three black phantoms fit these three warriors, and the equipment of Alfred and Metas clue us in (albeit subtly) to their transformation- the Penetrating Sword and Tower Shield being primary symbols of the two bosses. With Oolan (who I believe is mentioned to have a legion of soldiers) the implication is that he and his army were all transformed into Phalanx, with his men protecting him. (One discrepancy, though: Oolan is described as a male, though the black phantom is a female. This is not the only time in the series where such an occurrence happens, though.)"

demonssouls,38aggb,SnackRelatedMishap,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:33:22 2015 UTC,"Create another system profile on the PS3, pick an address in the united states to set-up a US PSN account. Buy a $20 PSN digital code from amazon US, they won't have to mail it to you it will show up in your software library on your amazon account. Enter the redemption code on the US PSN store, buy Demon's Souls for $19.99, download. Or if you want to save a penny, you can just buy a digital code for Demon's Souls off the US amazon store, but it still needs to be entered into the US PSN store to activate it.  Still another option, if any of your friends own the digital version of the game (even if they own it on disc they might have it as it was free through PS+) you might be able to game share it. A PSN account can be used by up to 2 PS3 devices. So if they would be willing to give you PSN log in information you could create that extra PS3 system profile but instead of creating a new US PSN account, you would log in with their information and download it from there.  After any of those 3 options, now you should be able flip back to your main PS3 profile and boot up the game from there. As long as you don't delete that alternative system profile with the US PSN account, you should be able to play the US version of Demon's Souls on your main PSN account."

demonssouls,38bx5y,hypnos_XVI,3,Thu Jun 4 12:19:53 2015 UTC,"Actually working on my first couple playthroughs right now(I alternate to whichever character I'm craving instead of finishing a playthrough then going to a new one) Honestly, it was just 5-1 that always drove me insane.  The entire level is ""stuck between a rock and a hard place""  5-1  Now if you take your time killing everything in the level. You're probably going to have a decent time. However, a couple deaths later and you'll just want to start trying to make runs to the boss. Runs to the boss in Demon's Souls in general seem to be particularly brutal compared to any of the other games. Anyways it usually starts out with the depraved ones. Typically not difficult to run past except when dropping down. If you don't roll the landing you're almost guaranteed to eat a couple pokes by the fire spear ones. Ok, not too bad. Moving on we have the rats. ""A rock and a hard place"". Behind you have depraved ones closing in on you, in front of you you have multiple very small enemies that inflict plague.   You either    turn and fight like 10 depraved ones all charging at the same time,  attempt to kill the rats before the depraved ones catch up to you(Only a few builds can easily take out that entire group of rats), or  just keep running.    If you can do 1. or 2. you'll be fine, but lets say you're not one of those special builds that can take out rats easily or you're just impatient. You keep running. Your new ""rock and a hard place"" is now the rats closing in on you and a Giant depraved one using smaller depraved ones to body block you.   You can    Turn and fight the rats(if you didn't do it before now is probably no better)  kill the Giant Depraved One before the rats catch you(Good luck with that. Even shrugs off hits from my strength build's dragon bone smasher) or  Miraculously roll your way past the small depraved ones and up the ramp guarded by a spear wielding one leading to   a bridge with spear depraved ones guarding the other side. The final obstacle. Your choices again are   Turn and fi-SMASH(oh right. those Giant Depraved Ones run pretty damn fast.) You destroy the spear user in record time(don't look back) Well, I mean kudos to you if you can manage to squeeze past the spear user on a narrow bridge   With the meat cleaver and being at such a high level, you probably just destroyed everything on your first run, maybe ran from the rats(No way the meat cleaver is a good weapon for dealing with them). Never had to deal with the impatience of wanting to get to the boss so you can figure out a strategy for him(Which to be fair all the bosses in the Valley are pushovers.)  TL;DR You're overleveled for the area."

demonssouls,38bx5y,Yamchaaa,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:37:11 2015 UTC,I think it had to do with beating the level last  The stages are (for the most part) designed to be played in almost any order  I did the same thing with just an Estoc and breezed through it.

demonssouls,38bx5y,Apsilon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"World 4 - Shrine of Storms for me was far and away the hardest set of levels in the game. I remember when I first played it back in the day, nothing prepared me for that fucking world! Christ almighty, I had my ass handed to me within about 30 seconds by a rolling skeleton. Once I'd negotiated the rolling skeletons then there was the choice of taking on the Vanguard or more hidden traps and skeletons in the underground dungeon. I mean, it was brutal!  Like yourself, I never really struggled with Valley of Defilement. In fact the only problems I remember having on my first play through and that did cause me a couple of deaths were the big club wielding depraved ones in 5-1. The first near the bridge and the second near the second bridge. They were nuisances.  To be fair to Valley of Defilement, 5-2 in the swamp was actually challenging. The Black Phantom was a pain in the ass and the giant depraved ones also caused some testing moments.  I'm actually playing through DeS again at the moment and it's not aged a bit. It's obviously easier now because I've played through it umpteen times but, it just never gets old - it still feels fresh. Personally I found this game much tougher than DS but, I think that's because it was the first and prepared me for the second."

I think one thing that From needs to work on as far as the CDs go is to sort of.....Consolidate Farming better......  I never look at souls games as a severe farming game like Diablo and other games, so when they decided to go this route they ended up adding a little more repetitive mundane dungeon feel just like in diablo....  with that said i think a rehaul in the dungeons would be great....i would rather have well crafted dungeons that are on a similar level to the story levels rather than same-y mirror world dungeons......"

It seems a poor design choice to make it necessary to range an enemy with powerful magic even if your build doesn't use all that much magic. A wasted opportunity. I would rather have had Miralda in 1-1 be available after obtaining a key, and the dragon nest be locked normally but opened in PWW or PBW tendency. Make the blue or red (or just have made it one dragon to begin with) a miniboss that you could fight at pure tendency to berid of them for the rest of the game. That only would work, of course, if fighting them was an option. As it stands, either the dragon is burning you to a well done crisp or you are cheesing it with distance. The dragons aren't really enemies, they are more like  a trap (think of the arbalist tower in latria) in that you ""solve"" them like a puzzle or go around them, but never engage it in combat. They are essentially scenery."

demonssouls,3832za,LolTacoBell,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:36:59 2015 UTC,"Just curious... is there a way to fight Kalameet without getting Gough's help? Because I didn't know about Gough for quite a while (had to look up a guide after 30+ one-hit kills from Kalameet's breath) and I tried literally everything I could think of, and everything ended up the same way: I'd run out, Kalameet would swoop in, and I'd die. Over and over. And over. And over."
demonssouls,3832za,Mr_Metagross,2,Tue Jun 2 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"It's very difficult, but if you know what you're doing, it helps a lot.  First, your equipment should be full Havels armor and his shield, this is important, as it has the highest stability and defense of any shield against his dark fire breath. Dragonslayer Greatbow +5 with 999 Great Arrows. Once you slide down the ladder, you want to position yourself under and behind the waterfall that is across from you.  Draw your bow, wait for Kalameet, loose the arrow, use havels shield to block black fire, wait for him to come back around, repeat until dead.  The difficult thing about this method is it takes a good hour to finish, and you can't fuck up."
demonssouls,3832za,LolTacoBell,2,Wed Jun 3 23:58:17 2015 UTC,Holy cow. It's actually possible? That's amazing. I thought his TAIL was impossible almost I couldn't even IMAGINE killing him THIS way!
demonssouls,3832za,UltimaGabe,2,Thu Jun 4 02:44:41 2015 UTC,Yeah and if you do kill him this way Gough will have special dialogue when you meet him telling you he is honored to have met a human as lofty as you. And his farewell addresses you as a proud human.

That would explain why I kept getting one-shotted without any recourse.  My current character is strong enough to use all of Havel's gear without breaking a sweat, but he's full melee (his dex is 13, I think) so I don't think I'm going to bother.  But thanks! That sounds like such a nightmare."
demonssouls,3832za,Jorlen,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:10:37 2015 UTC,Not as far as I know. Though enlisting Gough's help isn't difficult.

If you go at the right time, there is 0% chance of dying. Much like the rest of the game, it just takes some practice and knowledge."

Pick a sign on the ground and summon away.  (In theory.  There are many dead areas with no co-op to be found these days.)"
demonssouls,3837o4,Funklord_Earl,2,Mon Jun 1 16:00:16 2015 UTC,"To summon someone, yes.   To invade someone you have to be in soul form (dead). I believe it's the same for putting your sign down as well as both helping to defeat a boss and killing a host revive you back to human."

So it's cool to read something like this.  WRT Boletaria vs. Lordran, both are apocalyptic settings, but they came to their apocalypses in very different ways, and this is usually how I distinguish them:  Whereas Lordran could be said to have died of natural causes or old age, Boletaria is a murder victim or, based on what King Allant has to say, possibly a suicide.  I thought it was interesting how, despite their apparent similarities, Dark Souls and Demon's Souls have such different moods to settings, and that difference ultimately comes down to how both of them met their demise."

demonssouls,37ymy0,maplepenguin,4,Sun May 31 14:41:12 2015 UTC,"SL 109 shouldn't be under-leveled but there's no strict definition of what that means.  I have several characters that are lower than that who've tackled multiple NG+s.  How much Vit do you have, are you playing in body form or soul form, and are you using Second Chance?  30 Vit is a point of diminishing returns.  In my experience that's a decent amount to have in NG+.  In that case getting OHKO'd shouldn't be much of a concern in soul form, and even less in body form.  That said, World Tendency related NPCs and Black Phantoms will potentially one-shot you.  Second Chance, while not particularly necessary for NG PvE, is a very valuable asset in NG+ and beyond."
demonssouls,37ymy0,Cronotis,2,Sun May 31 15:38:43 2015 UTC,I'd agree with this 100%. Without SC I would lose my mind in later NG cycles.

demonssouls,37ymy0,tensionsmountain,2,Sun May 31 17:45:47 2015 UTC,"What is your build/favourite weapon? How much VIT?  The mind flayers only have three attacks:  1)soul ray - definitely block-able with a shield and no way should kill you in one shot at that SL  2) sonic blast - also block-able with a shield and should not kill in one shot  3)paralysis spell followed by tentacle stab - really dangerous, unblockable and probably will kill you in one shot.  I'm guessing it's no. 3 that is causing you problems.   As the other poster pointed out, Anti-Magic Field renders them completely impotent. Knockdowns with heavy weapons also work very well. The regular ones can be stunned to death but the BP ones have a lot of HP so you have to be careful not to run out of stamina...it depends on what build & weapon you're using tbh. A lit BBS for example will most likely finish them off before you run out of stamina as it inflicts immense DPS but other weapons won't.  As tough as the Maneaters are I'm also surprised they are killing you with one shot at SL 109. They have lots of attacks though so I'm sure some of them can."
demonssouls,37ymy0,tensionsmountain,1 point,Sun May 31 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"My chars mostly have around 30 Vit and Soul Ray is what instantly kills me.

A lit BBS for example will most likely finish them off before you run out of stamina as it inflicts immense DPS but other weapons won't   Am on my way of making an BBS build with my melee char, the BBS sounds quite fun (even though a bit overpowered?). Takes some leveling in Luck though...   As tough as the Maneaters are I'm also surprised they are killing you with one shot at SL 109   I was surprised too tbh. It's mostly the 2-fist attack (where one Maneater slams both it's fist to the ground) or I the classic getting pushed over the ledge"
demonssouls,37ymy0,tensionsmountain,2,Mon Jun 1 09:56:41 2015 UTC,"In case you don't already know, you want Luck around 20-25. You see lots of comments on here about levelling Luck to 30-40 or whatever. That's wrong. Luck doesn't scale with the BBS like other damage stats in this game. Your magic stat is actually more important (you want about 30) as  the whole point of the BBS is to use it with Light Weapon (which scales with your magic stat).  Yeah the Maneaters two fist attack is a killer. And I've lost count of how many times I've gone off the edge... Epic fight."

demonssouls,37ymy0,filterforshit,2,Tue Jun 2 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"You should know it needs the Light Weapon spell lol. Honestly, unbuffed it's not all that impressive. Not in NG+ and beyond anyway.   Also it's better used one-handed IMHO (due to the one-handed move-set having better range, basically) so use it with the Dark Silver Shield+5 for the parrying ability. Riposte damage is insane with a lit BBS.   Alternatively you can use it with an uchi in your left hand but I never really mastered that tbh and don't care to use the push-lock anyway.  Cast LW with the Insanity Catalyst for maximum damage but this means you have to chug way more of the MP spices so you might prefer to use the Talisman of Beasts instead and sacrifice a small bit of damage for the full MP bar and the ability to cast LW and SC without menu swapping.  You'll need a back-up weapon for when you can't re-buff/chug spices but the good things is with your stats you'll have a lot of choice e.g. Moon Uchi, Norther Regalia (if you've PB/PWCT), Dragon Mirdan Hammer, Lava Bow if you want range etc. etc.  It's a great build for PvE and good for PvP too but, against good, experienced players, they'll just wait until your buff runs out and then gladly trade hits with you and out-damage you easily until you are very dead. That has been my experience anyway lol"
demonssouls,37ysgg,MorganFreeman7,7,Sun May 31 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"The worst health loss mechanic was actually in the original Dark Souls before it was patched out. When Cursed, your max HP was reduced by 50%. That would not be so bad, except it could stack. So cursed once, 1/2, if cursed while still cursed, then its at 1/4 max Hp, then 1/8, and so on."

demonssouls,37ysgg,syles101,4,Mon Jun 1 21:56:09 2015 UTC,"There are two forms, soul form and body form.  In body form you have 100% of max HP and you are slightly noisier.  In Soul Form you have 1/2 of your max HP (can cut that to 75% with a ring that you find in the first level) and your footsteps and armor are quieter which shrinks the enemy agro range.  It is not an open world in Demon's Souls, there is a hub location and from there you can warp to 5 different worlds. Each world has its own tendency. When you die in body form or kill certain NPCs, that world becomes blacker and when you kill bosses and slay certain demons, that world becomes whiter.  When in whiter tendency, enemies have less HP and are weaker and you have greater attack power in soul form. When in blacker tendency, you have less max HP in soul form, enemies are stronger (but drop more souls and have better item drop rates), and black phantom versions of enemies are added to the levels.  You can transition back to body form by killing a boss, my being summoned to another player's world and helping them kill a boss, or by using a semi-rate consumable item. Should you want to always play in body form there is a pretty easy duplication glitch that lets you create a huge stack of that consumable item, but I preferred to play the game most of the way through in soul form."

demonssouls,37ysgg,UltimaGabe,3,Tue Jun 2 21:39:56 2015 UTC,You'll be fine. Your health goes to 1/2 when you die. But there is a ring (cling ring if I remember correctly) that boosts it to something like 3/4. It's really not a big deal.

demonssouls,37ysgg,filterforshit,5,Tue Jun 2 21:38:54 2015 UTC,It gets worse if you die in human form in a level.
demonssouls,37ysgg,ChemicalKid,2,Sun May 31 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"You have two forms. Human form and soul form. When you die you turn into soul form. You do slightly more damage but you have half health. If you die in soul form, nothing happens other than you losing your souls. If you die in human form, the world tendency gets darker. If you beat bosses in human form, your world tendency gets whiter. All dark, or all white makes certain events happen."

It's just such a coherent whole, even giving up on the game fits into the lore.  Demon's, however, I would argue has several levels that are way cooler than anything in Dark.  Also the Old One is a much better ending than Gwyn, just imo.  Loved your points though, you really can tell they crafted Demon's with love and passion, and as a genre-definer, I don't think you can find anything better."

But it is incredibly close between all three.  And frankly, I can completely understand why some people like Demons' the best.  It has the most oppressive atmosphere of all three.  I remember how dirty and disgusting the Valley of Defilement was, especially 5-3 with all the plague babies.  No environment in a souls game has been quite as disturbing as the Tower of Latria, hearing the blood curdling cries of prisoners and the mellow opera singing of the Once Royal Mistress.  And the world tendency system, while incredibly obtuse with how it was changed, really added a lot of intrigue and replayability to the game.  Black Phantoms are one of the coolest things, but they are pushovers in Dark Souls one (the NPC ones that is), and the ones that spawn from the Gravelord covenant don't affect you all too often.

demonssouls,37vb6z,dvstin,2,Sat May 30 19:49:32 2015 UTC,"I've farmed it about a dozen times.  Usually takes me 45 to 90 minutes.  Rarely takes over 2 hours.  Here's the fastest method:    Get Pure Black World Tendency.  Go to Adjudicator Archstone.  Progress through the first part of the level, to the side-area behind the hidden door.  Kill the Black Skeleton there and grab its loot.  (This is the same area with the Primeval Demon and White Bow).  Jump off the cliff.  Jumping off certain parts of the cliff will kill you very quickly, while other areas will result in you falling for about a minute before dying.  Find a spot that kills you very quickly, and just jump off of it.  You'll respawn at the Adjudicator Archstone.  Repeat 3 and 4 until you have your PBS."

demonssouls,37uj76,UltimaGabe,1 point,Sun May 31 04:40:41 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, talking to Satsuki in his human form isn't necessary for Platinum. All it does is provoke a fight and net you Hiltless, which you can get elsewhere.  (And I posted this above, but certain Pure White/Black World Tendency Events stay active even after Tendency moves away. So if you got to Pure White, and then later it shifted away [after dying or logging off or whatever], the stalagmite that holds the body with Makoto will still be gone. So events like that and the Istarelle ladder aren't good indicators of what your current World Tendency is.)"
demonssouls,37uj76,UltimaGabe,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:46:56 2015 UTC,"The exact same thing happened to me on my last playthrough. Chances are, you're playing online- every time you log off and back on, the worlds shift slightly towards the server average- which is typically one step below Pure White. What likely happened was you beat Astraea, then logged off, and when you came back, the world was no longer Pure White (though it's hard to tell on the Tendency Screen.)  Being able to get Istarelle is not a good indicator, because once the ladder appears (at Pure White), it doesn't go away, even if you're no longer at Pure White. So it's quite possible for the above to be true, yet the ladder to still be there.  The worst part about this is that since you killed Astraea, there's nothing else you can do on this playthrough to increase your World Tendency for that world. (If there was still at least one boss alive, you could kill an invading phantom, which... I think... increases World Tendency, but if that were the case, you could just kill the boss, couldn't you?)  So unfortunately, you'll have to beat your current playthrough, and come all the way back through the Valley of Defilement on your next one. It sucks, but next time, you'll hopefully remember to FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ALWAYS PLAY OFFLINE WHEN MANIPULATING WORLD TENDENCY.  Ahem. Sorry."

demonssouls,37sv7q,MailmanTSK,2,Sat May 30 08:11:23 2015 UTC,"the hardest part of playing demon's souls is discovering how to play the game.  first you should open your Demon's Souls case containing the disc of the game.  If there is no disc inside of your Demon's Souls case you should complain to whichever vendor you purchased the game from.   Once you obtain your Demon's Souls disc from the inside of the case you should place your disc face up (silver side down) into your PS3.  Sometimes the game will auto-boot based on your PS3 settings. Otherwise you should select ""Demon's Souls"" from your XMB menu (X is normally the correct button to hit).  After booting the game you should decide on your class. It is fairly inconsequential so pick a class that seems indicative of your play style.  After starting the game you should use your knowledge of other video games to start playing and enjoy the ride you could have been enjoying before you asked such a silly question on reddit about."

It's generally balanced out by being inferior in PVP, but you can avoid any online interactions by just staying in Soul form (which is a good option since mages don't really need much hp to begin with).  As for weapons, I really like the Secret Dagger. Daggers in general are really fun to use, they hit quickly to rack up the dps and criticals are so satisfying with them. They have short range, but hey, you can't have everything."

demonssouls,37l3i8,NexusRus,1 point,Fri May 29 01:27:50 2015 UTC,In demons souls the easiest way to get through the game from a pve prospective is magic by far. However you can do it without but the magic is just so powerful. PvP IMO magic is a little less useful besides buffing your weapons.

demonssouls,37l3i8,tensionsmountain,1 point,Thu May 28 14:22:31 2015 UTC,"There is universal agreement that magic is way OP in Demon Souls primarily due to the stacking effect of magic boosting gear. Magic can destroy bosses even in late NG cycles.  It's fun and all but I'd recommend playing melee also. Maybe try out some of the heavier weapons? They are a lot of fun in Demon's Souls IMO.  I personally love the Magic Sword Makoto used 2-handed. Fast, great range, huge bleed. It's damage is great too but not top tier."

I would summon myself out in 1-4 just to kill the dragon. And to think of the countless arrows I'd wasted before coming across that setup...."
demonssouls,37l3i8,demonssouls12345,2,Thu May 28 14:56:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the combo. You can also boost  your damage output by being in soul form with pure white charater tendency, and if you are using homing soul arrow you can keep a kris blade+5 in your right hand slot 2 (assuming your spell tool is in right hand slot 1) and swap to it just after casting the spell."

Zelda, for example, just started you back at ground zero (3hearts, no items) for the second quest, but it changed around store and dungeon locations and increased difficulty.

demonssouls,37i5fw,tensionsmountain,2,Thu May 28 14:06:52 2015 UTC,It was a spear.  I was a soldier with 0 souls and about 20000 souls in repair bills I couldn't afford.  It was easier for me to reroll a class instead of farming 6 souls at a kill with broken equipment.  Just prior to this I spent 20000 souls getting the miracle that allows you to teleport to the Nexus.
demonssouls,37i5fw,NyeonGamer,3,Thu May 28 14:40:17 2015 UTC,Yeah some people's idea of fun is poking players with the Scraping Spear to degrade all of their equipment until it breaks. It was funny once. 7 years ago. No idea why idiots still do that.  Best of luck with the rest of your playthrough. The World Tendency events are much easier to manage offline anyway.

demonssouls,37i5fw,Therealmattu,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"Point taken.   I'd wager the vast majority have either 'seen' or 'heard/read' about it by now though either personally in the game or through online streams/vids which kinda robs it of its humour IMO for both the troll and the invaded.  It's like the guy who invaded a PvP host recently in 4-1. He came in and killed us all with running firestorm. Everyone playing has seen it before and knows how it's done. All he did was end a PvP session which is a pity IMO as they are so rare now. The invader had 5 seconds of fun and went back to hours of 'invasion failed' because the three people actually playing that night just went 'yawn, fuck it' and left to do something else.  Trolling works better in newer, active games IMHO. But each to their own."
demonssouls,37i5fw,tensionsmountain,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:48:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely see your point.  I meant it in that the game is still new to people, though I admit very few.  I myself just beat the game for the first time a few days ago and am now doing NG+ so I have no idea what the firestorm strategy is.  I I have only been invaded 6 times so far but 2 of them were the monk boss and the other 4 were all at 1-4 where you have to fight the black phantoms.  I don't know if that area summons players or if people were just really active during that night. /shrug"
demonssouls,37i5fw,Therealmattu,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:59:40 2015 UTC,Yeah 1-4 is a favoured spot for summoning and invasions as it's a difficult area and one that takes time to get through (even though it's physically a small area). Only World 3 actually summons players (to fight for the boss).  BTW running firestorm is a 'spell switch glitch' whereby you can move/run around while casting the Firestorm spell making it almost impossible to avoid. It breaks the game.

Water Veil and armour with fire resistance don't help much due to the immense damage of the spell and a shield doesn't really help as the pillars appear randomly and can hit you from anywhere.

Not too long after he invades again, I hide around a corner to see what he's got and this time it's a Mirdan Hammer, and you know it's fully upgraded lol. Hit him with the backstab again. Screw these people, I've started hanging out at 2-1 to hunt them down."
demonssouls,37i5fw,Biohazardous17,2,Thu May 28 21:01:27 2015 UTC,"It's certainly already a possibility, but I've noticed it really peaking the closer to 90-100 I get then tapering off the higher I get away from 100."
demonssouls,37i5fw,Lisele,2,Wed May 27 20:57:06 2015 UTC,"This.   You'll either get invaded at SL <20 or between 100-140. Since there are more serious pvpers sitting at the 120 meta, that's when you'll likely see them pop up."
demonssouls,37i5fw,smilebomba,1 point,Wed May 27 21:25:48 2015 UTC,"I've actually only been invaded twice.   Once when I was going through 2-2, lvl somewhere in my mid 20s. It was laggy almost to the point of being unplayable but I had the upper hand until the guy started healing like crazy, then I got teleport-backstabbed.  Second one was right when I entered 4-1. He spawned directly behind me and got a free backstab. Once again, it got pretty laggy after that and I ended up losing.  I did kill a few people as the Old Monk, though. Lol"
demonssouls,37i5fw,Yamchaaa,1 point,Thu May 28 07:51:31 2015 UTC,Best bet is low SL (10-30) in early game areas.   But given the game's age now and the relatively low level of online play invasions can be quite random.

Yes, they're amazing, and yes, i am a rabid, foaming at the mouth fanboy, but it is a matter of historical fact that there was meant to be more content in both DeS and DkS 1. I agree that there shouldn't have to be a remake, because the publishers should relax a bit and let the damn devs do their job until it's done. The marketing hype and subsequent rush to release games is what ruins them, or at least holds them back from being their full best version."

demonssouls,37clo0,Dezuuu,5,Tue May 26 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"No. Please. We don't need that. The game looks good enough, and there's no need to have FromSoft waste their time on a product that's already been enjoyed for 6 years. I'd rather see some BloodBorne DLC."
demonssouls,37clo0,isen7,2,Wed May 27 02:57:11 2015 UTC,"As many have pointed out, it wouldn't necessarily be From Software working on it, in fact it's highly likely it wouldn't be. There are studios that specialise in HD remasters that would manage it."
demonssouls,37clo0,ausnick2001,2,Wed May 27 07:44:32 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but making an HD remaster is not going to improve the experience of the game."
demonssouls,37clo0,isen7,0,Wed May 27 14:53:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe not but it will expose more people to the game. Just head over to /r/bloodborne and you'll see there are loads of people who have migrated from Xbox, who have never had a chance to play Demon Souls. It would save them having to buy a ps3 just to play this game."
demonssouls,37clo0,ausnick2001,0,Wed May 27 14:55:48 2015 UTC,How? The game runs at 720p with no AA. The framerate drops into the teens in some places. Load times are very long. All of this would be greatly improved if the game came to the PS4.

When you pick up the item and it's a chunk, don't X out of the dialog window, but press the PS button and quit the game. This way, the auto save feature won't kick in and you won't lose any chances of the crystal lizard respawning."
demonssouls,37dpv5,Neptulius,2,Tue May 26 23:58:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. In fact I wouldn't even try to farm them without PBWT.  It's tough to kill them both, but I have good luck stealthily sniping them one at a time from long range while in hypermode.  It you startle them, just stay put.  They'll often run away then veeery slooowly come back and reset.  If they do escape, I recommend a hard reset and another go, only because it's such an easy stone to miss."
demonssouls,37dpv5,stereopathic,2,Tue May 26 22:40:48 2015 UTC,"I've got 'em both with thief ring + magic before but only got chunks as I was in PWWT.  It feels so weird saying PWWT because I just think of Michael Jackson's ""PYT"" lol"
demonssouls,37dpv5,tensionsmountain,2,Tue May 26 23:25:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, only try in PBWT and use stealth and hyper mode to catch them and kill them quickly.  I also approach them from behind/below by sneaking around the perimeter on the right hand side of the area as you look out towards the sea. This way, if you don't kill them immediately, they run back up into the area and not off the edge of the cliffs."
demonssouls,37bjsg,Neptulius,3,Tue May 26 12:28:29 2015 UTC,"I got it in 4 hours (maybe slightly less).  I didn't do those 4 hours in one sitting. I got PBWT, went and stayed offline and just turned the game on for 20 min here and there until I got it.  The most important thing IMHO is to have the most efficient method possible down i.e. the fastest route to and quickest method of killing the target that is also easy enough to do mindlessly ad nauseum.   I farmed the one through the hidden passage. Sprint directly from archstone only stopping to hit the illusory wall, bait his jump attack, roll under turn to backstab and spam quick two handed attack to kill him as he gets up. Suicide off cliff. Repeat.  (The BP skeleton method seemed a bit too slow for my liking but YMMV)  Best of luck."
demonssouls,37bjsg,tensionsmountain,1 point,Tue May 26 15:02:49 2015 UTC,"Oh good, that's what I wanted to make sure, I could take some time and chip away at it so to speak a little bit every day.   Thanks for the tip!"
demonssouls,37bjsg,demonssouls12345,2,Tue May 26 16:00:46 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the red phantom is more likely to drop it, since he always has to drop some kind of bladestone while the non-bp one drops nothing a lot of the time. Going backwards from the old hero archstone lets you sneak up and get a free backstab on him too, which is nice if you have a weapon with high crit damage like the Fatal Estoc or DBS."
demonssouls,37bjsg,rexxfiend,3,Tue May 26 13:45:05 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they both have a guaranteed drop of something, which is why luck is useless (since it apparently only affects the chance of a drop, not what the drop will be).   I farmed the one in the secret passage for about 6 hours I think. He's easier to farm as you can just drop off the edge afterwards to respawn at the archstone."
demonssouls,37bjsg,rexxfiend,1 point,Tue May 26 14:10:03 2015 UTC,"That's what I had been doing. It's just hard to tell with no actual progress being made, if maybe there was some small detail I missed.   I forgot about how luck is basically useless, but I leveled it up for the blueblood sword and figured it couldn't hurt to keep pumping it in there.   Forgot to ask: Is that six hours straight or an off/on combined total?"
demonssouls,37bjsg,Havel-the-Rock,2,Tue May 26 14:38:28 2015 UTC,Six hours on and off over a few nights I think. It was a long slog but I got lucky by the sound of it - others have tried for much longer with no success.

demonssouls,37bjsg,el_terapeuta,2,Tue May 26 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"Although I have no solid empirical data or evidence, I'd say the drop (for pure) is 1% based on rough estimation of the averages of the content of these threads that pop up like twice a week.   For me, I expect to spend 1.5-2 hours suicide farming the skelly in 4-2 and a run takes probably 90 seconds. That's about 80-90 runs, making the 1% drop sound probable.   As mentioned already, luck and large sword of searching have no effect since the mob is already guaranteed a drop (luck and large sword of searching only increase the chances of a drop, not on the item, although there is theorycraft, albeit in DS1, about optimal item find for specific drops off enemies with multiple loot drops).   On the upside, if you wear the bonus souls gear, you can get decent soul farm even if the drops are disappointing."

I've been summoned there as a blue many times (but yeah more often as the boss).  You should also be aware that killing players as the boss f*cks with your CT.

I mentioned these in PM but figure I should share it here as well-    At 2:15 in the video, you see a ghost version of a hand axe that isn't normally available in-game. It is however what you see ghosts of other players online when they're actually wielding any other axe. This is something the Souls games tend to do- ghosts use a limited set of weapons and don't always display what the other player actually had. Though for some reason they used an unused weapon here.    The axe can be found hanging on the wall in in Blacksmith Ed's room: http://illusorywall.tumblr.com/post/77740454212/demons-souls-unused-axe-found-amongst-blacksmith    I think the ""ghost spear"" at 2:22 might also be the unused spear seen here, but I'm not sure: http://illusorywall.tumblr.com/post/75570079249/demons-souls-unused-weapon-models    I also find ItemID: 182B8, 2:45 in the video, of interest.

demonssouls,379h9c,danblanchet,6,Mon May 25 23:50:03 2015 UTC,Do you not love the thrill of being invaded? When I'm running around in body form I'm constantly worrying about being invaded which makes the game more exciting.
demonssouls,379h9c,thecowardlyfox,1 point,Tue May 26 07:33:52 2015 UTC,It was kinda fun the last time I'll admit. But I was more prepared than the first time when I was like wtf haha
demonssouls,379h9c,smilebomba,2,Tue May 26 07:52:12 2015 UTC,Just think of the invaders as randomized red phantoms with good AI. Thats essentially all they (we) are.

You can always play offline so you're not forced to endure invasions. Sure you need to be online to avail of co-op but that risk v reward aspect is wicked fun and acts as an important balance in the game.  These days it also a much more reliable way to actually 'meet' other players.  I do invade now and then but also fight fair, sometimes throw in an attempt or two at humour and afterwards offer co-op etc."

demonssouls,372709,300zxTwinTurbo,4,Sun May 24 04:15:13 2015 UTC,"You can def stop this. Check your equipment weight. The more you wear the slower you dodge roll. Fat roll is after 50% equipment weight and under 25% is fast roll. So anywhere from 25% to 50% is ok roll. inventory weight doesn't effect your roll, only how heavy your equipment is. If you have any more questions I'd be happy to answer as best I can."
demonssouls,372709,Kozma37,3,Sun May 24 04:38:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I have another question. How EXACTLY does scaling work? Is it easily explainable, or should I just keep searching and hope to find something?"
demonssouls,372709,Kozma37,5,Sun May 24 04:43:05 2015 UTC,It's like this. Depending on the letter for a statistic the higher the dmg that weapon will do depending on how high that specific stat is. So if I have a sword with A scaling in str and D in dex. I would only use it if I had high Str. If my char had high dex I would look for a weapon that scales better with Dex than just a D scaling. The highest to lowest scaling is in this order: S A B C D. S being the highest. If you're using the Uchigatana you are probably better off getting some more dex to really get the best damage out of it.   All of this means that you could still use a sword with high str scaling if u have a dex build but it's dmg would be lower than an Str build.
demonssouls,372709,Kozma37,1 point,Sun May 24 04:50:38 2015 UTC,Thank you. This makes a lot of sense now.
demonssouls,372709,psykedelic,3,Sun May 24 14:37:36 2015 UTC,http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/uchigatana  That has all th info on the Uchigatana that you need. Including its upgrade paths. You'll notice that a Sharp Uchigatana has great scaling with Dex. If you wanna go the str route you could always choose a different upgrade path that would cancel the dex scaling or improve the str scaling.  Lol I know it can be a lot of info to take in. It's one of the things I love about the game. The weapons/upgrade paths can can very in depth. Have fun and let me know if you have any other questions. Umbasa!

demonssouls,36zld4,Yamchaaa,5,Sat May 23 19:13:42 2015 UTC,Distance is key - keep him at a medium range distance. This way he will usually spam 1) his fast 'closing in' attack which you can avoid easily by rolling sideways just as he comes in and get in a safe counter attack and 2) his AoE attack which is easy to interrupt by rushing in and attacking him. Just retreat to medium range after landing your hits.  He's actually easier without a shield if you can play that way - two hand your weapon and roll. Don't trade with him up close.  Fighting at medium range causes him to apply the least amount of pressure - you can heal and even rebuff pretty safely but still have to time it well obviously.  If you have to use a shield make sure it's the Dark Silver Shield.

It looks like just another guy playing through the area you're in except he shows up even offline. The first time I noticed him is when he appears to be pulling the first lever in 2-1 that opens up a gate.

demonssouls,36wtsf,illusorywall,2,Sun May 24 05:45:49 2015 UTC,"This ties in with a thought I had. Three of the player 'archtypes' are represented in the arch demons that were human. King Allant is a warrior, Old monk is a sorcerer and Astraea is a miracle user.  Following this thought, I figured that if the Land of giants archdemon was a human it would probably fit the rogue type, as that's the only one not represented. It seems based on this they might have been aiming for that before it got cut.  Shame we'll probably never know. A fight against an invisible boss would have been awesome (and infuriating)."

demonssouls,36mltr,systemwave,8,Wed May 20 14:21:32 2015 UTC,"Difficulty varies over the games.   I'd say Demon's Souls has the easiest bosses of all four games. But it has some of the most challenging environments, like 5-2 or 3-2, and some pretty brutal Black Phantom invaders.   Dark Souls has some of the hardest boss battles, but I find the Black Phantoms and environments to not be as challenging overall.  Dark Souls 2 has some of the hardest boss battles and several tough Black Phantoms, but the environments and regular enemies tend to be more breezy.   Bloodborne tends to have bosses that aren't too challenging, but a few environments and several enemies that are difficult and NPC's that are ridiculously hard. I'm only talking about the main game here, not the dungeons.  In my humble opinion."
demonssouls,36mltr,FLRSH,3,Wed May 20 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"Man, I think Bloodborne has super easy regular mobs but the bosses are kicking my ass. I haven't played in about a month because of Vicar Amelia..."
demonssouls,36mltr,wafflelord,1 point,Thu May 21 00:47:57 2015 UTC,"I, in my own experience, think there are about four bosses in Bloodborne that can consistently challenge a player even after playing them multiple times. Vicar Ameila is one of them. She has so many attacks, its hard to learn them all."
demonssouls,36mltr,FLRSH,1 point,Thu May 21 07:14:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's also just very subjective to each player's strengths and weaknesses. For example, I have only EVER been hit by Vicar Amelia twice, and I've never been killed by her. But I had considerable amounts of trouble with bosses like Mr. Cage, who most other people I've heard from found rather easy.  In an overall sense, though, I find Bloodborne to be my personal easiest souls game even though it's technically the one I die the most in. I mostly attribute this to the fact that often I don't have to put as much thought into the combat as I would in the previous games, I can get through most situations easily simply by reacting. The fact that death in Bloodborne doesn't feel as punishing or significant probably also plays a part. It just feels like it doesn't have as much weight in challenge for me, for whatever reason. But that's just my own personal experience, as someone who started with Demon's Souls and played through every souls game since, multiple times. Everyone will experience it in different ways, that's why I like these discussions."
demonssouls,36mltr,ReflexZero,2,Thu May 21 09:00:00 2015 UTC,"I personally found Micolash to be one of the easiest bosses of the entire series (and a boss I like to complain a lot about because of how disappointing he is as an end game boss), but you're right, it is dictated upon player strengths and weaknesses, and he does have that one hit kill that can get annoying if not prepared for it.  I can agree that Bloodborne generally had me dying less in general, and it forgives reckless play much more frequently. Button mashing and taking damage is much more forgiving due to regain system and that we get tons of stamina to basically keep swinging forever."
demonssouls,36mltr,FLRSH,1 point,Thu May 21 15:15:50 2015 UTC,There is a massive amount of swing in how leveled / equipped people are when they fight Amelia though.

demonssouls,36mltr,FLRSH,1 point,Fri May 22 20:34:27 2015 UTC,"There are some areas after Vicar Amelia that I found to be pretty challenging (Yahar'gul, Cainhurst, Forbidden Woods jump to mind). I found that the bosses themselves generally became a lot easier after Vicar Amelia, the areas became a lot harder, and the NPCs were the hardest of all. It must have taken me 1.5 hours of trying to kill Eileen in the Grand Cathedral. I eventually found it was basically impossible at my level except for going for 100% visceral attacks.  Bloodborne is such an amazing game that you should pick it back up again and try to beat Amelia. The lore is extremely Lovecraftian and extremely fascinating and there are some changes that occur in the world as the game progresses that are just awesome. In terms of story and atmosphere and lore it's my favorite Souls game by far."

Right now im completely new to Demon's and i guess im thinking on a  completely new perspective.  Going into Dark Souls I died alot but not at the fast rate of which i am dying in Demon's Souls. I would definitely say that environment and boss battles in Dark Souls feels like a balance between Demons's and Bloodborne.  Bloodborne after the learning curve in Central Yharnam was extremely easy for me and i would say that the most challenging thing (aside from boring[opinion] chalices) were the boss battles. Environemt for me in Bloodborne was easy..  Demon's on the other hand defines the souls series as difficult. Again on a fresh perspective standpoint the paths are difficult and the bosses are difficult and I am seriously in ""Souls"" hell right now lol....  Once i wrap my head around Demon's Souls' system i hope that in retrospect i can expect to breeze thru like in Dark Souls and Bloodborne but right now it seems like Demon's is the king....."

demonssouls,36mltr,Beardedcap,8,Wed May 20 20:25:15 2015 UTC,Have you met the one who lurks in flame?
demonssouls,36mltr,juxtaposition21,4,Wed May 20 14:33:03 2015 UTC,I beat him last night when my wife was asleep and my head almost exploded holding in my cheers. My favorite demon fight so far.
demonssouls,36mltr,JustGabriel,9,Wed May 20 15:14:13 2015 UTC,I'd hate fighting an enraged wife denied of her slumber
demonssouls,36mltr,imsofakingwetarded,2,Wed May 20 17:58:50 2015 UTC,I can second this
demonssouls,36mltr,SolaireGetGrossly,2,Wed May 20 22:55:28 2015 UTC,lol i dont know entirely what you mean by that but please don't spoil it for me.....i dont mind a world number tho....so basically havent met him yet :)
demonssouls,36mltr,juxtaposition21,2,Wed May 20 14:57:01 2015 UTC,"Ironically, you're not even at the hard part yet. As I understand, at least from what I've played, NG+ is what people talk about here. NG+ skyrockets in difficulty"
demonssouls,36mltr,Lisele,1 point,Wed May 20 23:49:07 2015 UTC,"I hope so. The most I've died on a boss is 3x against flamelurker. Then again, I'm not playing blind."
demonssouls,36mltr,gunnermcgavin,1 point,Thu May 21 03:52:43 2015 UTC,Tip for the mind flayers (bell octopuses): You can roll through their shock ball and they're easy to back-stab. Just be sure to stagger/stab them out of any casting they do once you get close or they'll use their AoE.
demonssouls,36mltr,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Wed May 20 15:17:53 2015 UTC,The Mind Flayers spells can be avoided by hiding around a corner. The attack you REALLY need to watch out for is their grab attack.   Bait them out one by one and it should be easier.  You might need to address world 2 and level up a bit before taking on Latria.
demonssouls,36mltr,gunnermcgavin,1 point,Wed May 20 15:48:38 2015 UTC,"I actually find that being aggressive helps with these guys.  If you can do enough damage to stun with your first hit, they are easy enough."
demonssouls,36mltr,then00b,1 point,Wed May 20 21:02:47 2015 UTC,^ This is also correct.
demonssouls,36mltr,then00b,1 point,Thu May 21 12:07:24 2015 UTC,"Tower of Latria is one of my favorite zones in all of the Souls series, especialy 3-1, love the atmosphere.   The mind flayers gave me problems my first time through as well. The second time through I forgot all about why I feared them and just ran up to them and stunlocked them until I had just enough stamina to dodge away then repeat after evading their spells. Depending on your attack power, it may only take one series of swings. You may also try dodging through their first spell then just beating on them or backstabbing them.  As for bosses, I found that most of them are highly cheesable if you're using magic. A lot of them are really only challenging if you're trying to straight up melee them."
demonssouls,36mltr,Bokthand,1 point,Wed May 20 18:46:46 2015 UTC,"I have been getting accustome to the mindflayers...., but im still lost here!!! help! lol so close to unlocking Freke!"
demonssouls,36mltr,maplepenguin,1 point,Wed May 20 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"Just be patient, stay calm, proceed slowly and carefully. Check every corner, every wall (hint), and every cell. Pay close attention to your surroundings, especially the floor! Do not proceed into the boss area until you've found a way to free Freke and think carefully once you've found the location of his cell key.   Good luck and have fun!"
demonssouls,36mltr,CrestfallenWarrior,1 point,Wed May 20 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. I haven't played Bloodbourne, but I beat both Darks Souls 1 and 2 twice with different classes. Now I'm working through Demons Souls and it seems pretty brutal. The bosses aren't all the awful, but the levels are very large and checkpoint to boss can sometimes be fairly significant.  I'm going through as 100% melee knight though, so the play style might not be as strong in DeS. I hear magic is op."
demonssouls,36mltr,MoDSec,1 point,Wed May 20 19:25:02 2015 UTC,yea i went from one class i dont remember to going to royalty and so far i can see why people would say magic if OP. Still tho....gettin wooped!
demonssouls,36mltr,imsofakingwetarded,1 point,Wed May 20 20:01:10 2015 UTC,"But Demon's Souls.......i have a feeling that i will be stuck on this one for a very long time.......dying many, many times....   Which is not a bad thing! After all Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne, I still come back for a Demon's Souls playthrough here and then"
demonssouls,36mltr,eric-plutono,1 point,Wed May 20 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the magic and miracles are super OP, you should use them. Oh i hate the entire tower of latria archstone, worst areas ever. I get lost in everytime."
demonssouls,36mltr,tensionsmountain,1 point,Wed May 20 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"Man... fighting the phalanx made me sad because I chose the warrior, and was using the halberd. Pretty much what. Did was throw firebombs, turpentine my halberd and just kept doing that lazy horribly animated 1hr1. He just sort of melted."
demonssouls,36mltr,tensionsmountain,1 point,Wed May 20 21:30:51 2015 UTC,"I have played this game first before the others and then when DS1 came out I played that. I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't go on until I get the platinum trophy so I still have yet to play DS2 or Bloodborne yet. That being said I usually just use a bow against the bell octopus things. I am by no means an expert at demons souls, so I tend to play more cautious. The tower of latria though is absolutely beautiful as far as design goes. Don't let them discourage you from keeping at it."
demonssouls,36mltr,tensionsmountain,1 point,Wed May 20 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"Demon's Souls has also been the most difficult for me thus far.  Dark Souls was my introduce to the franchise, and after beating it I moved on to Dark Souls 2.  After beating DS2 I've been able to play a decent amount of Bloodborne thanks to friends, but I don't own it and so haven't been able to invest enough time to beat the game; but I've played it long enough to feel like I've gotten a fairly accurate feel for what the game is like.  Playing Demon's Souls after that progression through the series is proving very difficult because the controls and movements in Demon's Souls feel so much more slower and limited (as in less directions to roll or dash compared to DS2 and BB).  I'm not saying that as a criticism of the game's design though.  It's just proving to be the source of a lot of challenge for me."
demonssouls,36mltr,tensionsmountain,2,Thu May 21 00:08:12 2015 UTC,Most players seem to find that Demon's actually feels faster than Dark 1 or 2 (still haven't played BB) but yeah more limited movement for sure.
demonssouls,36mltr,tensionsmountain,1 point,Thu May 21 11:02:24 2015 UTC,It puzzles me how players find Demon's Souls so difficult after completing Dark Souls 1 and/or 2. To me they are almost exactly the same in terms of difficulty if you are playing melee. If anything I think the bosses got more difficult in general as the series went on.   I often wonder is it because players could summon for some assistance in Dark Souls 1 and 2 when things got tough but because Demon's is so quiet in terms of numbers playing online they are forced to do everything solo? Is that a factor?
demonssouls,36mltr,then00b,1 point,Thu May 21 11:06:28 2015 UTC,I'm completely new to Demon's Souls so im just gettin thru the learning curve. When i started bloodborne it as just like this as well.   I think solo does have a little to do with it but i think it's me trying to wrap my head around the fluidity of the game. Once i get passed the blind first playthru i will go back and see what i learned. Imagine your first playthru of this game.....this is where I am at! dying all the time! all the time!
demonssouls,36mltr,MilkManEX,1 point,Thu May 21 11:58:25 2015 UTC,I do remember my first playthrough and it was amazing and infuriating all at once. I'm jealous!  Best of luck :)
demonssouls,36mltr,Wipfburger,1 point,Thu May 21 13:03:48 2015 UTC,I waas wondering by the way how do most of the veterans start out in Demon's? What class? I've noticed that magic is super vital in completing my journey. Do you guys mostly start with magic or...?  I just beat the spider but i noticed that i beat 2 bosses with magic....is this considered noobish? love to hear from you guys...
demonssouls,36mltr,Vertanius,1 point,Thu May 21 12:46:21 2015 UTC,"I ask about magic because in the past ( Dark Souls & Bloodborne) i never really used magic so much as far as spells and projectiles go, but this time around i find myself relying on it......what's your take?"
demonssouls,36mltr,PliskinSnake,2,Thu May 21 12:47:48 2015 UTC,Magic is pretty much broken in Demon's Souls. It is way way too powerful and renders the game a joke when you stack all of the magic boosting gear.  For that reason it is considered noobish. Believe it or not lots of players claim that Demon's is in fact 'really easy' and they are probably not lying - they just used magic.  I'd say play the game melee only or at least with limited magic but that's just me. Do whatever you want lol
demonssouls,36mltr,MilkManEX,1 point,Thu May 21 13:02:36 2015 UTC,yea so far i just obtained healing and use soul arrow on some enemies and some bosses. i prefer melee but havent found a weapon that i fully like as far melee goes.....but i might be spoiled because of bloodborne lol....
demonssouls,36mltr,rdg4078,1 point,Thu May 21 14:25:41 2015 UTC,Noobish question here but i got to Sparkly and i couldnt drop anything....do you know why?
demonssouls,36mltr,PliskinSnake,1 point,Thu May 21 15:13:09 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. Do you mean you couldn't select 'drop'? Was the option greyed out?  It's been so long since I bothered with Sparkly I can't remember how it might be different. You have to be standing in the right spot (by the tree) of course but I'm sure you did that.
demonssouls,36mltr,rdg4078,1 point,Fri May 22 08:24:35 2015 UTC,"It doesn't help that a a lot of boss souls are really only used for obtaining more powerful spells, not weapons."
demonssouls,36mltr,PliskinSnake,1 point,Thu May 21 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"Opposite impression here. Old King Allant was the only boss who managed to kill me (though Flamelurker gave it his damnedest) and the only area to kill me with any sort of frequency was 2-2, mostly to misjudging some drops. Were I not concerned about world tendency, I'd have been human for the vast majority of the game."
demonssouls,36mltr,A_Light_Spark,1 point,Sat May 23 01:48:54 2015 UTC,"Hardest stages, but easiest bosses, imo."
demonssouls,36mltr,demonssouls12345,1 point,Sun May 24 02:00:09 2015 UTC,"Funny, I started this game yesterday and I have the exact opposite opinion, this one is the only one where I'd go and oneshot several bossess without me not even dying inbetween.  Could be just because I have DS1/2 experience though."
demonssouls,36mltr,demonssouls12345,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:11:49 2015 UTC,The chalice dungeons would like a word with you.  but seriously demon's souls has one of the hardest main stories and bosses plus losing half your health unless you sacrifice a ring slot but holy hell these chalice dungeon bosses are kicking my ass.
demonssouls,36mltr,crowdog09,5,Wed May 20 16:11:13 2015 UTC,the chalice dungeon's are just too repetitive for me...  i just cant seem to get into them....maybe i will return to them after beating demon's souls
demonssouls,36mltr,Nickers77,1 point,Wed May 20 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"Tip: Don't bother being thorough with the chalice dungeons. Just get in, get out, and worry about the material requirements to open up the next one after. There are guides on how to effectively acquire the necessary mats and you won't spend hours on samey dungeons. There are a number of unique bosses in there that it would be a crime to miss."
