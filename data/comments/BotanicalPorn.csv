BotanicalPorn,3dn016,jdrusk,2,Fri Jul 17 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting! North American spotted orange lilies (Alpine, Tiger, Leopard, Wood, etc) have long been faves of mine (but unlike Muir, I've never found ones taller than me). The similar-looking Lilium pardalinum (Leopard Lily) I've seen growing along small streams feeding into Lake Shasta (or those could have been Lilium pardalinum ssp. shastense, the Shasta Lily). Where I am now the closest thing we have is Lilium philadelphicum (the Wood Lily). Lilium columbianum (the Columbia Lily) thrives in N.E. Washington and B.C., etc. Every one of these orange wonders makes one's day when encountered. Happy hunting!"

BotanicalPorn,3dl563,Beardor,2,Fri Jul 17 03:53:30 2015 UTC,"Relevant article Subalpine meadows are threatened by global warming due to short-lived snowcover. Snowcover normally prevents tree growth, so more trees are surviving the frost."
BotanicalPorn,3dl563,twoandfortysix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:03:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the article. Come to the Rockies, hike through them, live here, become familiar with their environment, niches and ecosystems, and learn that the places where the subalpine meadows are located are just as cold in the winter as the places immediately adjacent to them where conifers grow. The presence or absence of trees on slopes in these mountains is not a function solely of temperature differences as they are all just as cold in the winter - well below freezing! Also, wooded areas hold snow longer than meadows and tundra simply because they are shaded from the sun by trees (which, if the holding of snow was the only controlling factor would argue that trees shouldn't grow in the woods where the snow stays longer!)   Instead, slope, wind exposure, soil composition and moisture content, whether it regularly avalanches in a locale or not, whether there is bare rock or scree or not, all these factors help delineate where the subalpine meadows are. This is not to say that global warming/climate change isn't real (it IS real, and IS primarily human caused IMO) and whether it affects the environment (it can and it DOES affect the environment.)  But the simple theory that 'warmer means less snow --> more tree growth and therefore smaller subalpine meadows' might well miss the mark on describing a MUCH more complex system in the Rockies than that simple idea encompasses. I didn't read your article's linked study done in Oregon, so I don't know to what extent it might have statistically controlled for all the other possible causal factors and I don't know if they used PCA or similar tools in the study, but I'm generally skeptical of claims that a complex world of numerous interacting parts is primarily controlled by a single variable, such as global average temperature, when many other factors are also likely at work. Factors such as (in the studied case) what was the history of forest fires over the study period, what about curtailment of logging, grazing by domesticated animals, changes in rainfall, presence and activity of animals such as beavers, changes in predators and their effect on trophic cascades, etc etc etc. You get the picture. Skepticism (ie not knowing) is science’s preferred starting point, right? Demonstrating a thing is so - conclusively - is where we (with good science) can arrive after a lot of work and a lot of questions. I’m not sure if those have been asked yet in this case.  Global warming could well do what the article suggests, I'm not saying it can't, but here our subalpine meadows look fine. I don't see them shrinking in the few decades I've lived here. OTOH, we are missing millions of acres of lodgepole forest due to beetle kill by the mountain pine beetle. Many assert that climate change has caused/influenced THAT forest kill (and it most likely HAS, but also note that the town of Deadwood was named that due to all the beetle kill - back in 1876...) Certainly having multiple broods of pine beetles in a single season causes a massive beetle population explosion, and a longer 'growing season' enables exactly that. But also note that many folks over the last decade or so have argued this as a model of the cascading (negative) effects of climate change in the Rockies:  Warmer climate -> less beetle kill -> explosion in pine beetle population -> increase in dead pine forest acreage -> increased fires in beetle killed pine forests  But that model has at least one likely error (the last (bolded) step in the above chain), after closer study: http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/beetles-fire.html  tl;dr for you: Observation of beetle-killed pine forests show no increase in fires compared to non-beetle-killed forests. Explanation: once trees are dead, their needles fall off within a few seasons to the forest floor and the needles’ volatile (and flammable) oils break down. You’re left with a dead forest of a bunch of naked tree trunks (looking like big grey toothpicks) that are actually less likely to burn and/or sustain a crown fire (the most destructive kind of fire). Some simple models that sound reasonable sometimes don’t actually hold up under the scrutiny of careful scientific observations. Dead, dried out pine forests that we think will burn cheerily aren’t observed to burn any more than live pine forests. Similar caution may be warranted with the ‘warmer temps mean fewer meadows’ model. Especially since warmer temps likely means more beetles which means fewer pine trees… Trees that eat meadows. This stuff isn’t simple, it’s complex. My two cents, YMMV."
BotanicalPorn,3dl563,twoandfortysix,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for all that information! I didn't know all that. I googled 'subalpine meadow' when I saw this post because I haven't heard the term before and that link popped up.  I haven't heard of the lodgepole forest decrease due to beetles either. Is anything being done to mitigate the damage?  Edit: Was this taken in the Rockies? How long have you been there? Can you actually tell whether there has been a decrease or increase in forests/meadows?"
