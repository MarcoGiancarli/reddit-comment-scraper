NPR,3e235f,zsreport,8,Tue Jul 21 10:44:20 2015 UTC,This will be welcome news to the guy who started the petition to take A Prairie Home Companion off the air!
NPR,3e235f,UpTheAnteRazov,3,Tue Jul 21 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"It's not the end quite yet. Chris Thile is set to replace Keillor as the host. We'll see how it goes, but I'm optimistic because of how much the guy rocks a mandolin."
NPR,3e235f,812many,2,Tue Jul 21 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"I know he's being replaced but Keillor has been the engine.  Again, I don't listen and have no stake, it's just funny that this was announced relatively soon after the petition was posted on here."

NPR,3e235f,Oedipus_Flex,4,Tue Jul 21 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"Why would he be happy or why does he want to take it off the air? His reasons are in the links. He hates the show, and Keillor. Maybe with this change, the show will evolve, or, it might lose its luster and eventually fade away.   I have no stance on Prairie Home Companion myself, as I do not listen to it."
NPR,3e235f,UpTheAnteRazov,2,Tue Jul 21 16:03:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I read the petition. It was more of a like ""why would he feel that way"" why.

NPR,3dxvvl,aresef,9,Mon Jul 20 13:18:38 2015 UTC,Done.
NPR,3dxvvl,iowajaycee,2,Mon Jul 20 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"They have had to respond to a lot of ombudsman complaints regarding Senator Sanders. One would think that they would be more careful about how they allocate their airtime from now on. NPR, while a relatively neutral source of information, is largely supported by progressives and liberals.  Edit for clarity: I'm not critical of the fact that NPR doesn't pander. I'm critical of the fact that their reporting seems to increasingly lack the depth and nuance that it has had in the past. Additionally while NPR does receive the majority of it's money from member stations, those member stations have to get money from somewhere. In my area, they rely heavily on annual giving programs, bequests, and foundation support. This support is entirely dependent on NPR maintaining a high standard of quality. I don't know any member station that has money to throw away."
NPR,3dxvvl,trevor5ever,10,Mon Jul 20 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"NPR is supported by its member stations, plus underwriting companies, foundations and bequests. So, I mean, unless you think SitForLife or CSX is solely supporting NPR to push an agenda... Not to mention, there's a firewall between development and news."
NPR,3dxvvl,aresef,5,Mon Jul 20 17:55:37 2015 UTC,"I think it would be terrible for NPR to kowtow to its supporters. I want it to be neutral and to occasionally piss of the people who fund it.  Plus, do you have any evidence for the statement that ""NPR ... is largely supported by progressives and liberals""? Because NPR's largest source of funding is member stations, followed by corporate support."
NPR,3dxvvl,el_skootro,0,Mon Jul 20 20:57:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not critical of the fact that NPR doesn't pander.

NPR,3dxvvl,trevor5ever,28,Tue Jul 21 00:51:05 2015 UTC,"I don't understand. So the issue is that Bernie's not getting coverage because he's unelectable. But the complaint is also that his coverage today wasn't ... flattering?   He has had three weeks with one rally a week that drew thousands of people ... OK. They did that story after the first, and kept up his coverage after the second. That they didn't report on the third isn't because they don't like him, rather it's that it is no longer news that the Senator can draw some people to his rallies.  And they did give him coverage today. They gave him the coverage he earned. He went to a conference with a crowd that got riled up by O'Malley's gaffes, and he bit down hard on the same mistakes O'Malley made.  NN is all about progressive candidates. It should be where an anti-establishment candidate gets a boost with progressives. And he blew it. That's news worthy. Not that a few miles away he gave the same stump before an adoring crowd.  NPR has so many minutes of air time to fill. Each day they make judgments about how to fill them. You can't expect them to devote a large fraction to everything you like. Sometimes there are more important issues than your favorite candidate, or book, or band, or restaurant.  Instead of telling NPR to be nicer to your candidate, consider telling the Sanders campaign how they can better reach out to your peers and to your community."
NPR,3dxvvl,tnofuentes,5,Mon Jul 20 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"By that logic, Trump's coverage should diminish as well. They've covered his other controversial statements extensively, and it's not newsworthy that he offers more controversial opinions.  Additionally, to say the he ""bit down hard on the same mistakes O'Malley made,"" isn't an accurate portrayal of what actually happened. While he didn't manage to placate the crowd, he avoided shooting himself in the foot the way O'Malley did. This is nuance that was missing from the NPR coverage."
NPR,3dxvvl,trevor5ever,2,Mon Jul 20 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"Trump is newsworthy because of his polling numbers. Just because he's crazy doesn't mean we can discount the fact that he's leading the republican field in a number of national and state polls.   Bernie doesn't get the same coverage because while he does make sure that the type of people who show up to rallies keep showing up to rallies, he is not closing the gap to Clinton."
NPR,3dxvvl,DankOverwood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"Trump is the leading Republican in recent polls, is surging despite his discordant tone. Even if the Republicans muscle through an establishment nominee, it'll be over the protests of the Trump supporters that believe his brand of bluster and bravado belong in the White House. It may be through purchase and pandering, but Trump absolutely is news worthy this cycle.  I can say Sanders bit hard because he failed where O'Malley flourished. O'Malley stayed for a meeting with the protestors, apologized for his answer, and asked them about their concerns. Sanders took off for his rally and hasn't apologized for dismissing the protestors and their issues. He's compromised his 'no pander' position by tweeting about Sandra Bland and Black Lives Matter, but done so with no gain. Progressive African American voters agree with Sanders' positions. They don't care for his lack of engagement. And instead of engaging them, or any progressive group that he might have trouble courting, he's just inviting those that agree with him to a rally."
NPR,3dxvvl,tnofuentes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:05:27 2015 UTC,"You actually prove my point: There was nuance and detail that was missing from the story. There was a stark contrast in the way the candidates handled the situation, and that was not covered.  Additionally, while I respect that Trump is newsworthy I do not feel that he was newsworthy enough to dedicate as much airtime as they did to his extravaganza. They dedicated time to Trump, everyone who disagreed with Trump, and John McCain's response to Trump. It amounted to a significant amount of airtime. To prove my point, I would direct you to /r/politics, where coverage of Trump's statements exist but remain minimal, suggesting that concern about Trump is likewise minimally newsworthy."
NPR,3dxvvl,trevor5ever,0,Tue Jul 21 13:05:17 2015 UTC,I hope Trumps coverage decreases.  Let the clowns have fun in the sideshow while the real candidates get the airtime.
NPR,3dxvvl,jandrese,13,Tue Jul 21 00:41:14 2015 UTC,"There was also a segment where I believe it was David Greene interviewing Mr. Sanders, trying to trap him into saying ""all lives matter"" as opposed to ""black lives matter"" when everyone was coming down on Hilary Clinton for saying it. It was really disgusting and gimmicky in a Fox News kind of way that I don't expect from NPR. I was really disappointed."
NPR,3dxvvl,EmoticonIlliterate,6,Mon Jul 20 13:33:35 2015 UTC,"NPR is pretty fair.  It almost sounds like you're upset that they don't do 24/7 Sanders, and unfortunately for you they never will.  You're looking at one days worth of news and the 11,000 wasn't as spectacular as you might think.  Hilary has more voters, for example, should they divide up the show that way?"
NPR,3dxvvl,Aarmed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:57 2015 UTC,"The story, over all, lacked nuance and depth. There was a very tangible difference between the way O'Malley and Sanders handled the protestors, and NPR failed to cover that with any detail in favor of highlighting Trump's latest foot-in-mouth statements.  While I agree that by in large NPR is relatively fair, I disagree that this morning's election coverage was up to their usual standards."
NPR,3dxvvl,trevor5ever,3,Tue Jul 21 00:57:08 2015 UTC,I think trump might be #1 and Hillary might be #1

NPR,3dxvvl,TheMank,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:24 2015 UTC,I agree. I have been VERY disappointed in NPR's coverage.
NPR,3dxvvl,iowajaycee,-3,Mon Jul 20 13:57:12 2015 UTC,"Reasons I support Bernie Sanders -   After hearing him speak (various videos online), felt he was simply, directly answering questions, sharing his experience and wanting to do good... So, I spent time researching his votes and other activities over decades.   Included finding summaries of his voting record.. (look it up, if interested, not hard to find.. .whether you agree with his beliefs or not, there they are for review. And I believe in his stance on issues, and his approach to working on them)... and I believe he is consistent... including nuanced views where his specific votes depend on the particulars of the sub-issue within a general category. He votes what he believes, not what will placate some particular group.  It's difficult to find articles that do other than ""gossip"" and speculate, as if commenting on a sports event, regarding the campaign.   But, here's one example of an article http://www.drudge.com/news/189450/bernie-sanders-health-clinics-and-gop, in which the reporter provides some specific sense of what it is to work year after year to create change.   I believe he is a deeply dedicated, deeply experienced, caring politician, in all the best realizations of that role/word.   And, he's human! And will get weary and not respond exactly as everyone would wish on every issue and in every venue.   I believe he works hard to do his best to create change that will lead to people living better lives. And that's a lot."
NPR,3dxvvl,SirSid,8,Mon Jul 20 21:47:26 2015 UTC,"Just because you really really like him doesn't mean his rally was worth more air time. By its own nature, a rally is going to attract the fans. Getting a crowd of supporters at a rally isn't all that news worthy."
NPR,3dxvvl,adamwho,-9,Mon Jul 20 22:37:27 2015 UTC,I understand that Sanders is the current fascination of the left.  But realistically he is completely NOT news worthy nor electable.  He simply is not worth the time reporting on.
NPR,3dxvvl,iowajaycee,15,Mon Jul 20 13:31:30 2015 UTC,"He is drawing thousands and thousands of people to rallies. This is his third speaking engagement in as many weeks with over 10,000 people. How is that not newsworthy? He has received donations from more people than any candidate in the race, as well."
NPR,3dxvvl,0wlbear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:56:09 2015 UTC,"He's the liberal Ron Paul of this election cycle.  He has a lot of grass roots support and gets people energized, but he doesn't have enough financial backing to contend with the big machine candidates."
NPR,3dxvvl,iowajaycee,12,Mon Jul 20 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"And Ron Paul got more coverage in a more crowded field.  Also, Ron Paul had the disadvantage of having other, serious, less than establishment but less wacko than him competitors. For Bernie it's pretty much him or Oligarchy."

NPR,3dxvvl,amaefm,3,Mon Jul 20 23:54:15 2015 UTC,"This kind of attitude perpetuates itself. Of course he's not newsworthy if no one ever puts him in the news.  If no one is able to access information about Bernie, and the major media outlets refuse to acknowledge him how is he supposed to contend with people like Trump who is far less newsworthy in that he's a fucking joke candidate. And yet, here Trump is getting ridiculous amounts of coverage for being a blowhard who stands no chance of being elected while a legitimate candidate like Sanders has no coverage whatsoever when it sounds like something newsworthy actually occurred at his stop this weekend.  Nope, all we get is more bull shit Trump drama that isn't news, it's entertainment.  Maybe if the media was actually interested in the issues we'd see more about Sanders. Of course, NPR has also already decided that Hillary will be the nominee and probably don't want to encourage her competition."

NPR,3d8w3q,giraffenoggin,34,Tue Jul 14 12:29:55 2015 UTC,"No, no, no! The other description is wrong!  A common misconception is that NPR runs all public radio stations in the country. This is not true, and NPR often gets credit for many programs that it does not produce (such as Prairie Home Companion and This American Life). However, NPR is simply a distributor/producer of content, and does not own the stations themselves. There are other popular public radio companies out there, such as American Public Media (Prairie Home Companion), Public Radio International (Wha'Dya Know, many shows began here but switched to other distributors), and Public Radio Exchange (Sound Opinions, partly Radiolab and This American Life). Some larger public radio stations even produce their own content, like WBEZ or WNYC!  Think of public radio stations as movies theaters, and NPR as a company like Disney. Disney produces and distributes content that the theaters offer to the customer. But other companies are allowed to show their content in these theaters as well! There can be movies from 20th Century Fox, Sony, Warner Brothers, MGM, etc. all playing simultaneously. A public radio station chooses which content to offer their customers.  That isn't to say that NPR doesn't have great content, but don't fall for the ""all public radio is NPR"" bit!"

I'm an avid public radio consumer and until listening to this today I didn't know I was using the term ""NPR"" wrong.

That OTM piece really clarified it though. Actually, it kinda convinced me to continue referring to most public radio as NPR for shorthand. That is, until I talk to another public radio fan. Then I can start a WBEZ vs WNYC debate."
NPR,3d8w3q,c5mjohn,11,Wed Jul 15 03:41:38 2015 UTC,"NPR offers a lot more than just music streaming!  NPR stands for National Public Radio.  Since no one can own the frequencies over which one broadcasts, they are kept in trust by our government who, in turn, lease the airwaves to commercial interests.  They provide a product (like country music or talk radio) and generate income through ad revenue.  Because they are profit driven, they are chiefly interested in getting the largest amount of listeners.  If you were to approach a radio station and say ""hey, I'd like to do a show which features classical organ music"" they'd say ""not enough people listen to organ music"" and pass on your offer.  Not so with NPR!  Remember how airwaves are kept in trust by our government?  Well, the government itself holds on to some of the airwaves and gives them (along with funding) to NPR which functions as a not-for-profit focused on public service.  Your organ show would get a lot more traction here as it enriches peoples' lives.  Crucial to NPR, you won't find any Rush Limbaugh or Fox News types here either.  Whereas these ""news"" organizations are really profit driven and are thus focused on drawing larger audiences by any means, NPR has maintained high journalistic integrity over the years that mainstream news hasn't.  To give you an idea of some of the amazing and unique programming provided by NPR, I've drawn up a list.  News   All Things Considered Morning Edition Fresh Air The Diane Rehm Show On Point Here and Now Talk of the Nation   Music   All Songs Considered Piano Jazz Song Travels The Thistle and Shamrock World Cafe Pipe Dreams Performance Today From the Top   Miscellaneous   Wait Wait Don't Tell Me Ask Me Another It's Only a Game A Prairie Home Companion Story Corps   And loads others!  Take a look at some of these and see what you like.  edit: In light of the comments of /u/ERich2010 and others below, I wanted to point out that NPR doesn't create all this content necessarily but does distribute it."
NPR,3d8w3q,porty_paisley,9,Tue Jul 14 13:04:00 2015 UTC,"All public radio is not NPR, and a few of those shows (A Prairie Home Companion, Story Corps) are not produced by them."

NPR distributes some public radio shows, but definitely not all of them.  Other organizations, like American Public Media (APM), Public Radio International (PRI), and Public Radio Exchange (PRX) are major players, and compete with NPR.  Many of the radio stations that buy shows from these other distributors also happen to be NPR member stations and buy shows from NPR.  Those stations are not themselves NPR, though, they're independent and privately owned.   the government itself holds on to some of the airwaves and gives them (along with funding) to NPR   Also not quite correct.  Local radio stations get broadcast licenses from the government (by way of the FCC).  NPR is not a radio station and doesn't broadcast anything on the radio.  NPR sells programming to radio stations that in turn broadcast that content over the air."

PHC, Car Talk and Wait Wait are all shows that you can turn on or off in the middle of the show and be entertained.  Whereas TAL, Radiolab, Serial, Invisibilia are all shows that you want to listen to the entire thing.  You don't want to miss the beginning or the end, you want to consume those shows when you can take in the entire story.  I think a TAL or Radiolab type show with short stories would be great.  If anyone has listened to Pitch, those are the type of stories that would work. 5 to 15 minute stories that focus on one topic.  So you aren't invested for a full hour."

Just like with broadcast television viewership, public radio listenership (as we traditionally conceive of it) may be on a decline, but audio reporting and storytelling are on an upswing, I would say. Everyone on the thread is disagreeing about what is good radio, but that's exactly because we've been exposed to so many different modes and formats of audio media. More channels of delivery = more kinds of audio media/more individual programs. There is something for everyone, which means not everyone will agree on what something to listen to at 1pm on a Sunday.

NPR,3cqnae,gardenlevel,18,Fri Jul 10 01:59:26 2015 UTC,"Twenty years after Ira Glass launched “This American Life” at WBEZ FM 91.5, the host and executive producer has just acquired full ownership of his iconic public radio program.  Chicago Public Media, parent company of WBEZ and production partner in the show since its inception, this week agreed to turn over its ownership stake to Glass in exchange for ongoing profits from “This American Life” and its podcast spinoff, “Serial.”  Under the new arrangement, Chicago Public Media will receive a percentage of revenue from underwriting, station carriage fees and listener donations. The show’s 22 full-time staffers, now on the payroll of Chicago Public Media, will become employees of Glass’ company, created as a public benefit corporation.  Glass said the change will allow him to develop new programs with his staff independently. He noted that other nationally distributed public radio shows, such as “A Prairie Home Companion” and “Car Talk,” also are run as independent companies.  “At this point I wanted the freedom to be able make some things without WBEZ,” Glass said in an interview Thursday. “I say that with no complaint about WBEZ. It’s worked great. But I’ve been doing this for 20 years, and I just want to be in a position to decide what I want to do, and not have to clear it with the board or anybody else. I feel that I’m experienced enough that I should get that freedom.  “I am very grateful that they agreed. Their concern was that we should continue to collaborate on the things that we developed together. This structure allows me to start other new things without them if I choose to.”  Goli Sheikholeslami, president and chief executive officer of Chicago Public Media, said WBEZ would keep its branding on the show. She emphasized that there would be “no change from the listener perspective,” and that Glass will continue to participate in fundraising activities on behalf of the station.  “After 20 years, Ira decided he wants to be his own boss,” Sheikholeslami said. “And I felt that that was something he had earned. So I think the structure we’ve come up with gives Ira the freedom to do things on his own. We want to be supportive of him because he’s been such a great part of the station. He continues to produce ‘This American Life’ for the public radio system, and we continue to benefit financially from the arrangement.”  The agreement, approved Tuesday by the board of Chicago Public Media, is effective immediately.  Glass created the show, originally titled “Your Radio Playhouse,” with Torey Malatia, then program director of WBEZ, in 1995. It was renamed “This American Life” the following year and went on to win a huge following and worldwide acclaim in syndication, along with every award in broadcasting. The show, which relocated operations to New York in 2006, now is heard by 2.2 million listeners a week on 500 stations. An additional 1.6 million listeners download the podcast.  After 18 years of national distribution by Public Radio International, the show became independent in 2014 through an agreement with the online Public Radio Exchange.  Malatia, who became president and chief executive officer of Chicago Public Media, left the company after 20 years in 2013. He now works as a communication innovator for Ashoka: Innovators for the Public, a nonprofit network of social entrepreneurs, in Washington, D.C."

NPR,3cqnae,schm0,5,Fri Jul 10 19:32:36 2015 UTC,"Oh snap, is TAL going up against Gimlet? I feel like there's been some very subtle tension since Blumberg split off and did his own thing just as Serial took off in a major way. I just want all these guys to get along and switch and swap producers between TAL and Planet Money and StartUp and all the shows in between, but it seems like it's been less open in the last few years."
NPR,3cqnae,hungryhungryME,5,Fri Jul 10 03:10:50 2015 UTC,I think there is still a lot of collaboration and cross talk. Starlee Kine works with TAL all the time and has her own Gimlet podcast. TAL has definitely run Planet Money-based pieces relatively recently.
NPR,3cqnae,wookiewookiewhat,5,Fri Jul 10 04:20:49 2015 UTC,"TAL just reran a ReplyAll segment. I don't think there's a relationship issue.  Remember that theirs, like many informative media projects, is a contributor model. In-house production has its fingers in every segment, but many times that means preparing a 3rd party production for inclusion on TAL.   A growing podcast space, where more and more radio producers get to create original content, makes it easier for TAL to locate new talent, and new segments to air.  I think this move is all about agility. Say they wanted to do a pop-up production to cover a story with a short-life, say a daily update on the situation in SC, or a weekly short on the CA drought. There's no bandwidth on the dial to get that into a million ears, there's plenty to do so on-line, though.   Trouble is, under the old model, the purse strings would have to be loosened by WBEZ. That'd take time and pose risks of refusal. Under the new model, TAL could spool up a new show fast, and keep it running as long as they'd like, with out necessarily having to demonstrate a return to the mother ship.  I'm excited by this move.  For those asking, the most recent update to the app was good, in so far as it no longer crashes every time you try to use it."

She is a bad hire - even the smallest amount of due diligence will tell you that she's trouble and that her ""husband"" is in a pot of hot water.

They don't know the details surrounding the termination of an employee, and while it caused problems (inconveniences?) to them, they decided it would be better to shut everything down to express their displeasure. If that's not a childish reaction, I don't know what is. Were they hoping to have had more advanced notice? Maybe that wasn't an option. Employers sometimes have to revoke access for employees, especially those with privileged access, to prevent retaliation if they find out they're being terminated.

NPR,3bufo0,random12356622,7,Thu Jul 2 06:18:11 2015 UTC,"Trying to live on unemployment with two kids, you know a family of four is very difficult. <Music playing>  Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Zoe Chase.   And I'm Caitlin Kenney, today is Friday September 16th and that was Kris Hansel you heard at the top.  Today on the show unemployment rate is high all over, in Spain it is 21%, in Portugal it is 12.5,  and in the US it has been around 9% for more than two years.  But there is one country that is bucking the trend, their economy is growing, their unemployment rate is low.  Germany, their unemployment rate is 6% and declining. We spent a week in Germany learning their secret recipe.  How they did this, and today we will reveal it to you.   But first the Planet Money Indicator from Jacob Goldstein.   Today's Planet Money Indicator, Unlimited.  The European Central Bank just yesterday, rolled out this new program that will offer essentially unlimited loans to European Banks for the next few months. This was a big announcement and it was made with the backing of the Federal Reserve in the US and other Central Banks around the world. And the ECB did this in order  to fight this slow motion, largely invisible bank run that has been going on in  European Banks for the past few months now.   And this bank run Jacob, it is happening basically because Europe's big banks they have loaned  lots of money to Greece and the other European countries that are now in trouble  and a lot of the big investors that have loaned money to European banks are getting worried. They are afraid they won't get their money back from the banks if Greece doesn't pay its debts. So these investors have been pulling hundreds of billions of dollars out of the banks,  and it has been causing huge problems for the banks.   Exactly, so these investors pulling their money out of the European banks, this is the slow motion bank run. and what the European Central Bank did yesterday was it said to the banks  'we will lend you enough money to make up the difference'  Now these are short term loans and the whole program is setup to run for about 6 months. So this program, it does solve the immediate problem. This bank run we have been seeing. but of course it does not solve the deeper problem which is  the fact that European Banks loaned lots of money to countries that may not be able to pay the money back And until that problem is solved, until Europe really figures out what to do about its debt crisis how to solve it ultimately, until then European banks are going to need this life support system from the central bank.  Okay thank you Jacob.  Thanks Jacob.  Thanks guys.  Okay on to the podcast.   And Germany, sure Germany is the Big man on the campus of Europe.  The countries unemployment rate is 6.1%, its economy is growing,  it is selling a lot of goods to the rest of world.   But it wasn't always this way. 10 years ago Germany was not that guy. Germany was sickly, pale and weak.  Germany's story of transformation starts in 2002. There was a global recession on and Germany was suffering. It was really similar to the situation in the United States right now.  GDP growth was 0, zip, zilch, nothing, unemployment was 8.4% and climbing.  Germany was not the strong man of Europe.   They were in trouble and they needed help to the top man in Germany, Gerhard Schröder, the German Chancellor. He made an emergency call.   (Speaking in German) I was actually surprised when I got the call and Mr Schröder left me very little time to make a decision as to whither we actually head that commission.  This is Dr. Peter Hartz speaking through a translator.  He was the human resource director at Volkswagen.  Now the HR director might seem like a strange guy to call at a time like this. But he wasn't just an HR director. First off he was an economist, 2nd Schröder knew him personally.  They have served on Volkswagen's board together and perhaps most importantly he made a name for himself. As the guy that could reduce unemployment. At Volkswagen he negotiated a new plan with the unions. They gave up some concessions, and in return Hartz told them it would make it easier for Volkswagen to hire people. And it did, at Volkswagen's headquarters in the city of Wolfsburg.  (Speaking in German) - On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the city of Wolfsburg. We made a gift to the city which was to reduce unemployment in the city by 50%. We did actually implement this plan.   He reduced the city's unemployment rate by half.  Now the German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was telling him do what you did for Wolfsburg for the entire country.  The two friends Hartz and Schröder assembled their team.   Three union members, some politicians, some academics, the name of this gang of super heroes,  this A Team, the Commission for Modern Services in the Labor Market.  You know everybody just called it the Hartz commission. As Peter Hartz saw it there were two main ways Germany could bring down the unemployment rate  and make life better for German workers. One make it a lot easier for German Workers to be fired.   (Speaking in German) - Normally employers in Germany, companies are very careful about hiring new people. Because people that they hire have a very high level of protection, job protection and we saw that companies  would indeed hire more people if they were able to take on additional people for temporary jobs for smaller jobs.   It seems like a strange thing that in order to fix the problem of unemployment.  To help workers get jobs you need to make it easier to get rid of workers. But if companies can't shed workers when times are tough that can make them reluctant to hire when things are going well.   They won't expand if they can't contract.   Exactly, and this was a huge, Huge problem in Germany.  The words everyone used to describe Germany's economy at the beginning of the decade 'inflexible labor market.' What this means in practice is that workers had protections that were sort of unimaginable here in the US. The way the labor rules were constructed in Germany it was really hard to fire people  and if you did get fired the government would pay for you to sue your employer they would give you money to take them to court. Essentially it was a nightmare for employers that wanted to fire people.  But if you did get some how manage to get fired compared to a lot of other places, life was pretty sweet. Workers got 50% or more of their last salary for life. - Peter Hartz  (Speaking in German) I wouldn't say it was a too generous, but what people did was they made use of benefits permanently. It was meant to be temporary or short term but people ultimately made permanent use of them.   This was the second big recommendation, cut unemployment benefits.   So that was it, that was the plan. Reduce job protections and reduce unemployment benefits. Fundamentally flip around the social protections that Germans have come to expect for decades.  Chancellor Schröder and thought wow that is an awesome platform to run on. I promise to take away your benefits and make it easier for you to get fired. Vote for me.  The thing is in Germany that is exactly what they did.  All 15 members of the commission signed off on the plan including the unions.  Remember 3 representatives from the 3 different unions were on this commission and they all voted for this. Over the next couple of years Chancellor Schröder pushed the reforms though Parliament.  The unemployment changes went into effect in 2005,  with in the year Chancellor Schröder's party lost power and he was out of a job.  But the reforms did exactly what the commission had promised.  They wanted to bring down the unemployment rate, they did.  After spiking initially to 10% it dropped dramatically and it is still dropping.  The Hartz reforms people say worked and I wanted to see how exactly they are working. So I went to this factory in Germany that produces steel tanks it is in ???Kerpen???,  a town about an hour outside of Berlin.  <hammering sounds> It is sorta this mix between very high tech and very low tech.  In one corner you got guys using welding tools, and huge pieces of steel  and in other places you guys stand by computer screens where they input commands. I almost got hit by sparks when I leaned in to get the sound of one of these machinists. <squealing noise>  The company has been owned by Thomas Whoo's family for decades and he says the main benefit he gets from the reforms is this totally new concept. Something called a mini job.  Whoo says the mini job solved a problem for him, a problem he used to have, if a big order came in,  and he needed more help.  It is not possible to give everybody full time jobs. Mini job means I haven't enough to do for a full worker,  but I need a worker for several hours or so.  Before the Hartz commission it was really hard to hire a worker like this,  someone to come in just for a couple of hours. But with these reforms and the creation of the mini job he can do that.  A mini job isn't that great of a deal for workers in these jobs the maximum they can make is 400 Euros a month,  but they get to keep it all.  They don't pay any taxes on the money they make, as far as hours it is a total negotiation between employer and employee.  They can work as many or as few as they both agree to.   Well that reminds me of something in America we have those, we call them jobs, right? Not a great job,  a low wage part time I could fire you at any time job, but that is a job."
NPR,3bufo0,Despondent_in_WI,6,Thu Jul 2 06:18:35 2015 UTC,"Right, exactly, but there weren't many jobs like this in Germany before, and now there is lots of them.  And it is different in two ways one is that German Workers who work at these jobs are  more likely to have health insurance, but they also get paid a maximum of 400 Euros per month.  There is no minimum wage in Germany so for those 400 Euros a month they could be working 40 hours a week.  That is 2.5 Euros an hour that is nothing compared to minimum wage here in America.  But the idea is to give a chance for the employer and employee to test each other out.  It gives the employer an incentive to take a risk on someone that they might not normally hire because  they know it is not a permanent thing.  So it is basically a way to do something that employees and employers didn't used to be do in Germany.  Which is date.  You see during this time, during these months that these people do a very good job.  That is also in the possibility then the possibly for him or her to get a new job in our firm.   And you have people like that now, people who started doing temporary work and now have full time positions.   Yeah sure.  How many?  One at the moment. <laughs>  Mr. Whoo said he hired at least 10 people from mini jobs at various times in the last two years, but only one of them has turned into a permanent employee.  Alright so on the whole when it comes to the Hartz reforms employers they like them.  But for the workers it is more of a mixed bag.  I talked to this one woman who has two mini jobs she said she likes them.  They give her flexible hours, and she can take care of her husband who is sick.  And I met another woman who was out of the labor force for 20 years  and she just got back in with a mini job at a wine shop.  She says it gave her self confidence and it lead to a part time job. Now she is making more money, but when you talk to German workers about the Hartz reforms.  Their attitude can be summed up like this,   ""I'm bull@#$"" <Laughing>  This is Monica Cariben I found her outside the German equivalent of the unemployment office. She is employed now, but she is registering for unemployment in case she gets laid off.  And about 50% of the rest of Germany feels like her according to the recent poll.  They think the new benefits are not enough to live on. Here is what you get when you are laid off. If you are out of work for more than a year, you get 364 Euros a month, subsidized rent and electric and a job counselor.  But they can also cut your benefits back if they don't think you are looking hard enough for work  or they can punish you if you refuse a job they think you should take.   Cariben sees these reforms as totally unfair.  Before they went into effect her unemployment benefits would have been higher.  They would have lasted longer and she wouldn't have people harassing her all the time to take a job she didn't want.   <Speaking German> I am upset that there are recipients have been drawing this benefit for 20 years. And they have a good life and somebody like me who comes in now, we get little money and we have to give receipts  for everything that we give out and this is not worthy of a human being.  Proponents of Hartz would respond to that by saying 'Sure that is low, but it will encourage you to go out  and take any job you can' and check it out the employment rate is lower. This is obviously working.   But I ran into this one guy that just gotten a job Frank Bermin, he was at a bar celebrating. <Laughing> He had been out of work for a decade and he had just gotten a job a week earlier. He is basically like a poster child of these reforms. He was long term unemployed and now he has a job. So I asked him, are you a fan of the Hartz reforms? Are you do you like the laws that came into place  that setup this system that introduced you to this job.   <Speaking German> Actually I have to say no, because I prefer the old system.  Why does he prefer the old system? It is a pretty simple reason, under the old system  he would have gotten more money when he was unemployed.   He represents the flip side of the Hartz reforms and people are much more likely to blame  Peter Hartz for cutting back benefits and driving down wages, than to thank Hartz for saving the economy  and reducing unemployment. So we asked Peter Hartz how does it feel to be the personification of these reforms?  To bear the name of the drastic changes to the economy?  <Speaking German> Actually it was terrible, at the very beginning of the work of our commission we made a mistake  the problem was the name of the commission was too long and since journalists don't like long names  they had to come up with a short one. And they took the name of the Chairman of the commission,  if my name had been <Voitent Nasnongberger> the name of a prominent politician in Germany.  If my name had been <Voitent Nasnongberger> they wouldn't have called it <Voitent Nasnongberger> commission,  they would have come up with another name, for instance we should have called it the Job Commission.   And to be fair there are lots of other reasons people are mad at Peter Hartz.  His legacy is controversial he was convicted of paying off union leaders at  Volkswagen to go along with his cutbacks and he was accused of spending company money on prostitutes.  You could look at the reforms as too harsh. You could also see them as a reality check as Hartz does.  If nothing had changed in Germany the trade off would have been high wages for people who had jobs,  increasingly high unemployment for everyone else. He says Germans needed to come to grips with the new reality.  <Speaking German> In Germany we redefined the concept that we call reasonable expectations.  Reasonable expectations for unemployed people.  Think about the context that Germany is in right at this moment the European context.  Germany is the superman the hero that the rest of Europe has been waiting for.  But the superman isn't feeling in a very rescuee mood right now.  They just went through a very painful process and it is still painful.  Germans don't necessarily want to send their money to other countries who haven't made the same sacrifices.  More on how that drama is playing out in a future podcast. <Music playing>  As always we want to know what we thought of today's show, you can email us at PlanetMoney@NPR.org  or you can find us on Facebook and Twitter Caitlin Kenney,   and I'm Zoe Chase Thanks for listening."

Even the overly-sincere stuff is FAR more appealing than the jokeless, smarmy attempts at irony that comes from the tripe that is ""Wits"". At least Keillor seems to usually see himself in the sketches and bits as a supporting presenter, or ensemble member, as opposed to John Moe's disingenuous attitude and worthless, unfunny attempts at making an interview humorous. Keillor is more often a participating facilitator, with the exception of the story-telling segment ""The News From Lake Wobegone"" but that is really where I feel Keillor shines. John Moe just doesn't ever seem genuine.   For a good example of someone who strikes an amazing balance as a Variety Show Host/Presenter (since I'm sharing my distaste for Wits) I'd direct you Live Wire! and Luke Burbank. He is funny, and clever, a fanTAStic interviewer, entertaining, and tells stories in a tone that conveys a truly genuine and personal attitude. How that show isn't on every single station with the likes of Car Talk and WWDTM (both of which I love) is a real mystery to me.   Edit: TL/DR: Keillor is polarizing, but maybe just because he's old style? Also Wits = BOO! But Live Wire = YAY!"

Given that these two are the only NPR articles that showed up in my feed (Google News) in the last couple of weeks:    http://www.npr.org/2015/06/23/414926833/how-fracking-is-changing-the-nation-s-electrical-grid  http://www.npr.org/2015/06/11/413395080/americas-next-economic-boom-could-be-lying-underground  And then find that, sure enough, the America's Natural Gas Alliance (ANGA) is a corporate sponsor.  And then when I searched my top result was :  http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/stop-npr-from-accepting  So I started assuming that this a known problem.  But yes, I know that a petition is not a source, and I note that petition refers to ""NPR’s corporate wall of secrecy surrounding its underwriting practices"", and I guess that means it is not something that is publicly acknowledged.  So do you think I'm wrong about this?"
NPR,3au3pl,NevaehKnows,16,Tue Jun 23 15:26:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for adding more information.

I think there was one in the last couple of days about earthquakes in Oklahoma. I can see the concern, but I'm not going to get up in arms about it, personally."

Then they are mini-ads and people know it.  My concern was that the people pieces I saw (linked above) totally read like fluff pieces, but purport to be regular articles.  Now I see the negative articles you are referring to, but it's still hard to get my head around the idea that those positive articles are not sponsored, and this is from someone who is sympathetic to their message!  ed: I didn't mean for this post to suggest a conclusion about the 'fluff' pieces (I think that's why I'm getting voted down).

NPR,3au3pl,MiddlenameMud,7,Wed Jun 24 19:46:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. I think you're wrong.   If good news about puppies occurs, we should expect NPR to cover that news. I'd expect a detailed exposition followed by some balanced perspective from cat people and a discussion of how this affects the interests of snake people. And I'd expect that even if later in the broadcast I hear an underwriting message brought to me by the ASPCA.  As listeners it is important to pay attention to the content we consume. We have to look for just the sort of editorial/sponsor collusion you discuss. The trouble is, when you jump from a ""concern"" directly to absolute certainty that positive coverage was paid for, you're acting no better than when an anti-climate change Senator throws a snowball fight to prove global warming is a hoax, or when Fox News reports that Hillary Clinton had to have made corrupt, anti-American decisions during her tenure as SoS, because foreign sources gave her husband's foundation money.

Elevating discourse in our culture begins and ends with the readers. Facebook is the biggest driver in news because people trust what their friends say, and that applies to both sides of the aisle. It takes more effort to join the discussion and find the nuance and clarifications that usually follow a bogus news post on Facebook than it does to simply click like and further disseminate the inaccuracy.  Know another site that drives traffic to news sites? Plenty of Redditors probably saw your post, clicked, read, upvoted, and never made it to the comments. They'll be he ones to mention the claimed hypocrisy as fact to a friend, who'll share it with another friend and so on.   It IS our responsibility to monitor our own behavior and our own sharing, just as much as it is the responsibility of politicians and news organizations.

BUTLER (guest)   I have no respect for your ancestors. As far as your ancestors are concerned, I shouldn't be a law professor at Georgetown. I should be a slave. That's why they fought that war.

The idea that a German would say, you know, that thing we did called the Holocaust, that was wrong, but I respect the courage of my Nazi ancestors. That wouldn't happen.

In the civil war in my local area, the women held banners that said ""I would rather be a widow than married to a coward"". There were considerable pressures on these young men, as always is when old rich men send young poor men to die for their profit. They were not all racists and bigots who fought and died in the civil war.   So Diane Rehm was not politically correct in what way?   Remember you stated NPR was not politically correct yesterday morning.  What do you think Rehm should have done to be politically correct?"

NPR,3abijs,elmariachi304,2,Thu Jun 18 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm New York Magazine's social media guy. The article that inspired the dialogue was this one, which appeared in Monday's magazine. One of the guests was the author:   http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/06/anthropocene-debate.html  There is a lot of talk about geology, so maybe it'll help answer some questions the segment did not. Generally, theories about the Anthropocene have spread beyond the field of geology and into fields like sociology and anthropology, with geologists corroborating those theories by sediment analysis and the like. This talks at length about that."

NPR,3abijs,NateGoldman,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:15:29 2015 UTC,"I just listened to it, it was really stupid. They are basically trying to use the term anthropocene to mean so many different ideas that it lost all meaning. They also made huge leaps that weren't really supported by evidence like the idea that if humans are the driving factor of the environment that civilization must be untenable.  It was full of irrelevant tangents like the talk about the Arab Spring. Saying that some political revolution is a turning point in the earth's geological history is insane. Political revolution has been around since 45 minutes after political power first appeared.   It was full of blatant falsehoods like saying that the Romans built amazing temples and modern man's crowning achievement is anti-depressants. Anyone going around saying that is either deliberately lying to pull one over on you, or so deluded that they are nearly beyond reason.   This segment was garbage. It meandered around something that was nearly a topic, but whenever they tried to make a point it was either ridiculously unsupported, not relevant to the discussion or just generally nonsensical."

There were some SJWs talking crap about men's rights a few weeks ago.

NPR is one area that I can be assured hasn't been tainted with the trashy parts of pop culture. Kim Kardashian may as well be the 1st Lady of trashy entertainment. The crux is, that's where all the money is. Some of us are a bit concerned that NPR may pull an audience grab to bring in more donations, diluting their otherwise fine product. If NPR starts trying to appeal to the every-man then it stops appealing to it's target audience."

If NPR draws a larger audience from a 5 minute spot of Kim Kardashian and that subsequently leads to more donations, how is that bad? How will that dilute the product?

Sure, and I'm the Queen of England.  Call it snobbery, call it elitism, call it whatever you want - NPR is and always has catered to a specific demographic.  Pretending otherwise is being disingenuous with yourself. You know it, you just don't want to admit it.    If NPR draws a larger audience from a 5 minute spot of Kim Kardashian and that subsequently leads to more donations, how is that bad?   You seem to be missing the big picture. When revenue goes up from a particular market segment and/or marketing strategy, companies tend to increase whatever it was that made the revenue go up. It's what killed MTV.

NPR,39m8tk,soc_jones,7,Fri Jun 12 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"Tbh I'm surprised you've been an NPR news junkie at all if you think coverage of social trends and comedic and lifestyle programs aren't your cup of tea.   Not every NPR station is the same. If I were you I'd send some feedback to your station's program director. If you want more straight news, and don't mind streaming it, RadioIQ in Virginia does hours of BBC programming, as do many other stations.   I think you and I share a  frustration with the ... lack of gravitas of some of the on air talent. I'm occasionally left feeling like I listened in to someone's emotional retelling of a news event to a friend and not a hard edged hour of news content. But then, I also think one of the best shows on the air right now is Marketplace Weekend, which specializes on putting a softer human face on the week's economic news.   Perhaps there's another place for you in BBC or even new media projects. Rivet Radio is an app you may consider, it's basically wire reports recast as audio programming."
NPR,39m8tk,tnofuentes,2,Fri Jun 12 22:46:57 2015 UTC,"NPR has always been this way, and, hopefully, always will be. It's about more than just news. It covers news, money, culture, music, entertainment, and creates it's own entertainment."
NPR,39m8tk,phasv2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:59:15 2015 UTC,"But it's not really entertaining. They cover something and make it as dry as it possibly can be. Why? Well, I think it's because they treat everything their broadcast the way they do real news. They really are riding the fence awkwardly trying to cover both important news and entertainment news. Just because they've done something since they started doesn't change the fact that it's not executed very well."
NPR,39m8tk,Feldew,0,Wed Jun 24 12:36:08 2015 UTC,You may think so. I happen to enjoy NPR's reporting.
NPR,39m8tk,phasv2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:40:15 2015 UTC,"What do you enjoy about it? I ask because I can't seem to find anything to enjoy in their unimportant topics personally. It just feels like awkward filler, and I often wonder to myself 'did someone really approve this to be on?' What is it about NPR's coverage of this kind of media that you feel you like it, or even prefer it to a station dedicated to that sort of broadcasting?"
NPR,39m8tk,Feldew,2,Wed Jun 24 12:44:45 2015 UTC,"They provide information about things I want to know. I'm not sure what you don't like about NPR, so I can't really address anything specifically, but I really like the way that NPR goes in depth on issues, and comes back and gives information on how things are going with a story that the rest of the news organizations have stopped reporting on."
NPR,39m8tk,phasv2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:34:23 2015 UTC,"Well, here's an example. There was an older man on today talking about the noise levels at sporting events. He was saying that it's too loud and that we should actually discourage players from 'arm flapping and towel waving' to get the crowd excited and making noise. He then went on to say that caddies at golf tournaments were severely under dressed and that in one hundred years people will look back and say 'wow, caddies back in the day sure were scruffy!'   Then they eventually got to news that actually matters. But this is the kind of nonsense I'm talking about. Who cares about any of that? Seriously? Is that the kind of thing you really want to know?"

NPR,39m8tk,phasv2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:50:49 2015 UTC,I turned it on in the midde of his rant. How much difference does context make to you? Either way I see what he was saying as pointless. I can't think of any context that could possibly change that.
NPR,39m8tk,Feldew,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:12:00 2015 UTC,"Context makes a lot of difference. I don't agree with what he was saying, but that doesn't mean it's pointless. It's possible they were presenting opposing views about something, who knows.  The point is, I'm satisfied with NPR as it is. I like human interest stories, I like news, I like science updates, I like pretty much all of the shows they have, (although Diane Rahmes' voice is a little hard to listen to sometimes) and I like story telling."

NPR,39m8tk,windowside,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:17:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am getting NPR burnout, too. Well, local public radio station burnout. I think they're having a hard time trying to appeal to two demographics - older folks not willing to let go of Prairie Home Companion and Car Talk, and younger folks wanting something edgy with storytelling (Moth, Snap Judgement). The news shows during the day just blend into each other, and the local shows aren't particularly good. They all bore me, moving me more toward podcasts.  I miss Ray Suarez on Talk of the Nation, who could make a topic I had no interest in completely engaging. And my local station won't carry To the Best of Our Knowledge. Too many This American Life reruns, perhaps time to kill it off.  What are the GREAT new shows that should be more widely carried?"
NPR,39m8tk,danthelibrarian,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:37:59 2015 UTC,Not to ask an obvious question but if you can get it via podcast who cares if it's widely carried?
NPR,39m8tk,Smokler,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:08:40 2015 UTC,"I started listening to NPR about 20 years ago, for the news. I was a fan of the BBC World Service and various other international broadcasters that I picked up on shortwave at night.  I would say I hit the wall with NPR about 5 years ago.  I noticed a definite trend away from long-form news on the flagship shows, particularly anything that involved complex international news, economics, or science.  They dropped Talk of the Nation, and replaced it with nothing, which was a demonstration of their priorities.  It seems like they're going for more of a Humanities / Lifestyle demographic now.  I have heard the hosts of ATC seemingly offer an apology in advance of some stories that focused too heavily on science or economics, you know, boring stuff like that.  Meanwhile, they have 3 or 4 ongoing series in which some creative individual reviews or recommends literary works.    Everything seems to be processed through a narrative filter now.  Everything is a Story (in italics).  I'm sure it has much to do with the success of segments like Story Corps and shows like This American Life and The Moth, but when they're doing a story on a legitimately complex issue, I would like them to interview someone who has some expertise in that field, not someone who has recently written a novel or a play about it.  A specific example happened a little over a year ago.  There was an All Tech Considered segment about how individual bloggers living under repressive governments (China, Iran, etc) are able to publish their work online.  I was expecting to hear about technological approaches, such as encryption, or proxy servers. None of that was ever really addressed.  Instead, the piece wrapped up with several minutes on how some woman in Cuba had ""finally found her voice"".  I still listen to the Diane Rehm Show, the news at the top of the hour, and occasionally get into the first story on ATC or ME, but other than that, I've given up on NPR as a legitimate source for news coverage.  Streaming audio and podcasts have largely replaced terrestrial radio for me.  Talk of the Nation signed off two years ago this week.  Neal Conan's final piece of advice to NPR was:  ""Tell me what's important and don't waste my time with stupid stuff.""  I think NPR has gone way too far into the stupid stuff."
NPR,39m8tk,authalic,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm tired of a lot of what comes onto NPR. Any time they try to be funny or talk about something related to sports or social media, they fail utterly to entertain. It's dry, boring, and all I can do is mentally count down until they get back to what I actually there for: news. I just listened to some old man talk about how it's too noisy at sports games and how home teams should stop encouraging the noise levels. Really?   I tend to just skip away from the station when they're talking to some new musician or about some other pointless topic, because I just don't think NPR does it well. Their forte is and always has been information and it shows when they try to veer off into comedy, sports and other entertainment topics unrelated to news or politics."
NPR,39m8tk,Feldew,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:28:21 2015 UTC,"I've listened to NPR since the late 1980s, and haven't felt any burn out. But, I don't listen to it exclusively. In the mornings I mix my Morning Edition with local sports talk radio and sometimes Howard Stern. During the middle of the day I listen to podcasts of my favorite NPR shows or stream the music oriented WFUV out of The Bronx. I love ATC and Marketplace in the late afternoons and on the drive home. Compared to most other news media out there, NPR still serves up better news coverage of national events and world events. The other ""news"" radio station in Houston is just a delivery vehicle for Fox."
NPR,39m8tk,zsreport,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:23:38 2015 UTC,"This is the point I was getting at in my own reply here. NPR succeeds as a news station and fails at comedy, sports, and media. It really is best to let stations who focus on those topics, like sports radio or Howard Stern, to do what they're successful at. It's not like I would expect to hear an engaging interview about the upcoming elections with Bernie Sanders on Howard Stern's show. Why should I suddenly have to listen to NPR broadcast something about celebrities or really dry, awful comedy?"
NPR,39m8tk,Feldew,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:33:53 2015 UTC,"Some historical context: NPR's mission has NEVER been solely hard news. On the very first day of programming way back in the early 1970s, they did a story about whether glow in the dark Life Savers actually glowed in the dark and recorded Susan Stamberg walking down the hall to a closet at NPR HQ to test it out. So the concern I've heard over and over again that NPR now spends too much time and resources on sports, pop culture, fashion, etc. coverage, this kind of diverse information mix has been part of their DNA since day one.   That said, if the NPR experience for you has historically been about hard news, I understand your frustration. NPR has had to grow and change with the times into a media company not just a news organization. Finanically I understand why (it's also more to my tastes) but I think with that is the tacit knowledge that we don't get our news and information from one source anymore and the turn-on-and-listen-for-everything model of news consumtion is from a pe-internet era that no longer exists.  Upshot: I usually recommend as others have done in this thread, a mix of on-air listening and podcasts, on air-for breaking news, podcasts for weekly news roundups and the other non-newsy topics I'm interested in.   Last note: The infotainment feel you speak of does not work for plenty of areas of news coverage but for others, like financial and economic news, its a godsend. Planet Money is the best thing NPR has ever done regarding business and economics reporting."

Where that video you just heard came from was a very unusual campaign to change voters' minds in California. ... Steve Deline is a field organizer with the Leadership LAB at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, which is a very large multimillion-dollar nonprofit, the biggest LGBT organization in the world.  Steve Deline : We lost by a decent margin. And it was devastating. Because everyone in California and beyond expected us to win that election.  Dave Fleischer: People were shocked and angry and despairing.  Ira Glass: That's Dave Fleischer. He's a political operative that the Los Angeles LGBT Center flew in to figure out what in the world they were going to do after this defeat. It was his idea to go out and do something that apparently is just never done.  Dave Fleischer: Let's go to the neighborhoods where we got crushed and talk to the people who voted against us and ask them why they did that. And when I suggested the idea, Ira, to be totally honest, I didn't know if those voters would talk with us. I'd never done anything like this.   Ira says later:   It did occur to the organizers that as sincere as these conversations seemed, maybe the voters were just being polite at the end. And when they said they would vote for gay marriage, they were just saying what they thought the canvassers wanted to hear-- hadn't really changed their minds. Which is why they invited in two political scientists-- one from UCLA named Michael LaCour, another from Columbia University named Donald Green-- who designed a case controlled study that was eventually published in the journal Science.   Also, it was retracted, not redacted. Redacted means some information was removed (e.g. ""redacting a phone number""), retracted means pulled back or withdrawn."

My guess would be that the audio was cherry picked pretty heavily, which is fairly safe to assume for most media interactions.  It's unlikely that enough people were interviewed where it would become obvious the study cited was falsified. Even if TAL found contradictory evidence, the study was published in Science, it would be pretty ridiculous for a radio show to claim to contradict it. TAL has always been about relaying a narrative, which is really cool but sometimes it isn't true (this happened before with some contributor didn't it? I can't remember what it was off the top of my head).  Another possibility is that people acted differently when they were recorded on their answer."

Npr: well, what about back in (I think it was 1999 or something) when a teacher accidentally discharged a firearm into a toilet? What if it hit a student?   Legislator: well, if the best example you can think of out of the entire US is someone shooting a toilet more than 10 years ago then I think we're in good shape. Furthermore, how many children have died in a school shootings when not a single person had a weapon to defend themselves? What if a teacher with a firearm could have taken down a shooter before they killed students? What if that saved even one student, would you not then allow the chance for the teachers to defend students?

Second, yes, innocent people get convicted of crimes sometimes. The judicial system is run by humans, and as a species, we are, regrettably, fallible. This is an argument against all punishment, not just the death penalty, so kindly stop trotting this one out.   Finally, and this is the thing death penalty opponents just don't seem to get, whether it's ""effective"" as a deterrent is not the only relevant consideration. Retributive justice is also a valid reason for punishment, and some people may just deserve to fucking die.  So when you say that this is a black and white issue, all you do is reveal your own biases, and your inability to think beyond them."
NPR,37wgad,NoeJose,5,Sun May 31 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"Saying ""some people deserve to die"" is not in a realm of judgements you are responsible enough to make, I can promise that."
NPR,37wgad,undreamt_odds,2,Sun May 31 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"And there is something else susceptible of disagreement. Again, this isn't a ""black and white"" issue."
NPR,37wgad,Despondent_in_WI,2,Sun May 31 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"I would just like to add one point regarding your ""punishment"" comment: The death penalty is indeed a punishment, just like sending someone to prison is a punishment. The difference is that if you accidentally send an innocent person to prison for a few years, you can recognize the mistake, let them free, and provide them with some sort of compensation for the mistake. This is impossible to do if they are put to death.  Anyways, I hope you enjoy your Sunday! I'm planning on maybe playing some videogames and listening to some podcasts :)"
NPR,37wgad,qwicksilfer,-1,Sun May 31 21:17:42 2015 UTC,It is a black and White issue.   If you do something worthy of death penalty - you should be put to death.  Expensive? Cost of housing a criminal for 20+ yrs has got be way more expensive that the Cost of one appeal PLUS 1 Bullet(~$1)   If they were found guilty - then they should swing quickly. One appeal - if not enough evidence to overturn the conviction - OFF WITH THEIR HEADS.
NPR,37wgad,tjtill,1 point,Sun May 31 17:12:48 2015 UTC,It costs more in every step to the death penalty than the alternatives. You can find the comparative costs at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty .

NPR,37wgad,abc03833,8,Tue Jun 9 18:35:28 2015 UTC,How would you describe the difference in your world view?
NPR,37wgad,magnabonzo,23,Sun May 31 20:30:05 2015 UTC,"The difference is pretty huge. Your average talk radio listener has little to no awareness of what is going on outside their American bubble. Not saying it's necessarily bad to have that kind of perspective but just within a few months of listening I started to really look at the world differently.   I wish I could site some examples but there are so many. I remember my brother riding along with me one day and I think the story on was about Pakistan and India relations and some interesting stuff about the political landscape or something like that. After a few minutes my brother says to me, ""what in the world are we listening to?""   That's usually the response when anyone rides with me."
NPR,37wgad,ShipleyBronuts,7,Sat May 30 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"It seems to me, as an outsider, that conservative radio is in a constant state of fear (ie: going to take our guns away, going to ban christmas, your women will date ethnic minorities). Is there a larger point or message that I am missing because of my bias?"
NPR,37wgad,engunneer2,14,Sun May 31 00:33:28 2015 UTC,"This is such a complex topic, I don't even know where to begin.   I'll say this, I never truly understood the take away guns thing, until I bought a gun, right after I left the church. I started to become aware of all the places and groups that treated me as the criminal just because I had a goddamn handgun. How does ownership make me a criminal or likely to hurt someone?   I do understand the big deal now. If you don't like guns or don't own any it's hard to see it from their perspective.   Those other issues, totally religiously motivated. I'm so embarrassed that I used to be against gay marriage. And I know more and more conservatives are waking up to the fact that that shit doesn't effect them in the slightest. Let people be happy and do want they want, as long as it doesn't hurt someone else.   The biggest problem with conservatives and talk radio is they say they are for freedom and limited government but their religious fury makes them every bit as statist when they actively try to keep LGBT people from having the same rights as anyone else they see as ""socialist"".   Their religion makes them in a constant state of us vs them. It drives me insane."
NPR,37wgad,engunneer2,20,Sun May 31 01:32:53 2015 UTC,"How does ownership make me a criminal or likely to hurt someone?   Consider this perspective: a gun is a tool designed to kill things.  It can be used for other things, trick shooting, popping balloons, skeet shoot, etc., but ultimately, it is designed to propel a bullet at lethal speeds.  One may use that design to protect themselves from an attacker, perhaps by threatening to kill (but not actually doing so), but if I see someone carrying a gun, I see someone prepared to kill.  Around here, we don't really have any bears that I'm aware of.  Our wolf population (that we worked so hard to restore) is actively being pushed back to endangered status.  Some people have dogs that could do some pretty hefty damage if they were so inclined, but I've never seen them do so.  There's the occasional diseased animal (we had a cop come out and shoot a raccoon that was behaving very erratically and possibly rabid), but they're not so common I'd think one would need to carry a weapon on them.  As such, animals don't really constitute a common threat here, which means if I see someone carrying a gun, I'm seeing someone not just prepared to kill, but to kill people.  Please forgive me if I feel concerned about the intentions of someone carrying a gun.  I don't know anything about their temper, self-control, wisdom, and/or training, but I know they're prepared to kill people.  (Now, if I was somewhere where there were a fair number of threatening wild animals (bears, cougars, etc.), it's much more understandable to be carrying a weapon for defense, of course).  EDIT: I forgot to add, you have good points all around.  Regarding the small-government-except-in-your-bedroom crowd, I can at least understand where they're coming from; they feel in a lot of cases that they're trying to save people from themselves, and so they're doing good by trying to get the state to intervene.  I don't agree with them, of course, but we can at least understand their motivation."
NPR,37wgad,CHIDJM,5,Sun May 31 02:02:37 2015 UTC,"Totally understand that. I understand the emotional part, guns are designed to kill. Period. But, the 2nd amendment was never meant for hunting.   If more guns equated to more gun deaths I would be more inclined to understand the fear but in reality it's not the case at all. And the main factor is that it's a constitutional right. A big pet peeve of mine is when the left just decides that some rights are outdated must be changed.   Understanding both sides would be helpful for conservatives and liberals."
NPR,37wgad,superbaconturkey,2,Sun May 31 04:55:42 2015 UTC,"I am sad I only saw your AMA today, but hopefully you're still on reddit.  I'm Dutch, moved to Switzerland (the mini-US in Europe :)), then to Maryland (the mini-Europe in the US), and now I live out west. My views of guns have changed a lot over the years, but having lived in the city and in the middle of nowhere...I just don't get why it has to be a ""one size fits all"" law for gun ownership. In DC, handguns are used to kill. Period. It's not protection. It's about violence and murder and it's gotten worse since the bans on handguns were overturned. It does more harm than good. (And hey, there's a reason guns aren't allowed in the Capitol and the White House!)  But then you go to South Dakota and you drive along and you see a house with no neighbors and you realize that if someone breaks in (low probability, but still), yeah, no cop is going to show up in time. And I get how lonely it can feel.  So really all I want to say is...maybe certain things shouldn't be one size fits all, like gun laws. Maybe people locally have some ideas about what works in their city that may or may not work out in the middle of nowhere.  Anyway, I am loving your responses, thank you so much for doing this!"
NPR,37wgad,lostjames,1 point,Sun May 31 22:17:23 2015 UTC,"I'm still here! Haha.   Thank you for the post! I think you make an excellent point, we can't have one size fits all laws on guns, or most things for that matter. I think states and municipalities have tried to enact laws specific to their problems. Look at Chicago and DC, two cities with a huge violence problem. The politicians went for an easy solution that would sound good to the public. Both these cities banned guns but saw no decrease in the murder rate.  According to this story : http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/24/chicago-crime-rate-drops-as-concealed-carry-gun-pe/?page=all  It seems like Chicago is experiencing a 56 year low homicide rate. Everyone in favor of the ban said crime would explode but it didn't.   I'm DC according to this article : http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/17/dc-gun-violence-statistics_n_2316944.html  Shows that gun violence has Fallen for 3 straight years, and the homicide rate is under 100 people a year. I would call that a success. And I totally agree, handguns are for killing but a person has the right to defend his life and property with a handgun if he so chooses.   I would also like to point out that every single mass shooting in the US in the last 10 years has taken place in ""gun free zones"". Criminals do not give a shit about gun bans. No criminal is going to not hurt someone just because there is a sign that says ""no firearms"".   I would challenge anyone who thinks that more guns lead to more violence to research these incidents, or just look into cities around the states that have very high gun ownership rates and see how low their gun violence is.   I apologize if I sound a little angry, I'm not, this is one of the few issues that will still get me worked up. Ha ha."
NPR,37wgad,WTFppl,5,Mon Jun 1 19:28:54 2015 UTC,"Were you able to listen to This American Life's two part exposé on being a cop, and their relationship with citizens? If so, I'd like to hear your perspective on this, taking into consideration talk radio's bend on the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin issue, or I suppose the Ferguson, Mo incident (granted it hasn't been a year yet). More so, how do you feel about the differences in reporting on domestic issues when it comes to race and policing issues. It's been a long time for me since I've heard any Glen Beck or Limbaugh, and as a newbie to NPR I'd love to hear about your experiences."
NPR,37wgad,maiqthetrue,9,Mon Jun 1 23:16:36 2015 UTC,"No, I have not, but thank you for reminding me. One of the things I hate about npr is there are so many good stories and can't listen to them all. I usually will write it down or put it in my note app on my phone but I've probably missed some good ones.  My opinion on those issues you mentioned are probably distinct from each other so I can't give you a real good answer, mostly since I lack the research to give an opinion that I think reflects every angle. With that said, I think in each one of those cases people jump to a conclusion before facts are available. I remember a guest on Diane reams (not sure how to spell it lol) who was a pretty loud critic of the cop involved in the Ferguson shooting, but came on and basically apologized for not waiting for the facts before coming to a conclusion. I think talk radio jumps the gun too quick in favor of cops since in these cases it seems to involve someone who has a criminal record and their first instinct is to support the Leo. In doing that they fail to see in many parts of the country the Police don't follow their use of force protocol and need reform. When it comes to lethal force it needs to be used only when absolutely necessary.   This is one of the things I'm impressed with about npr, it's far more fair than I ever expected. Yes, I do feel it leans more left but I think it veers much less to the left than talk radio leans to the right, if that makes sense. Generally, my bullshit meter has been finely tuned over the last year and I think most listeners can take the information given and formulate an informed opinion.   I hope that answers your question!"
NPR,37wgad,Loveflu,5,Sun May 31 00:48:18 2015 UTC,"Great answer, thank you. If you get the chance you should definitely check out the TAL episodes I mentioned, they really opened my eyes on the opposing sides of the police/citizen debate that seems more and more prescient today.   As for the bias, yep there is some. What's nice about it is that it is not as extreme towards one side or the other. Also, NPR has an active ombudsman, something you won't find on any other talk radio program, specifically to maintain the highest quality of journalism possible. Basically if there's a conflict of interest, notably recently their reporting on Lumber Liquidators (a key sponsor of NPR) they are required to acknowledge such during their report. I find that to be a point of clarity that is lacking in some other news found on the radio at least."
NPR,37wgad,Xdeser2,3,Sun May 31 01:19:20 2015 UTC,Do you think NPR has any bias?

Talk Radio makes it out to be like msnbc, ha ha.   There are areas I think they lean left but it's almost never so bad that it pisses me off. I just understand that their are other perspectives that are just as valid as mine."
NPR,37wgad,jandrese,1 point,Sun May 31 01:24:53 2015 UTC,"In fact, NPR's bias, where it exists, bothers me that much more.  I have this inherent idea that they're objective and unbiased... but  then I'll listen to a discussion of e.g. the death penalty or religion or gun control where all of commentators are so far left-of-center (and they assume all of their listeners are so far left-of-center) that they can't understand that there might be a legitimate opposing perspective.  This infuriates me -- I usually agree with the commentators, in fact, but I still recognize that reasonable people can valid, opposing views... and we're not hearing them.  I count on NPR to give me all the news, but sometimes they miss reporting a big chunk of it."
NPR,37wgad,Xdeser2,3,Sun May 31 01:51:23 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar position to you wherein I was raised conservative and religious (christian).

Are there any programs that you really dislike because of your conserative leanings?"
NPR,37wgad,spinosaurs70,6,Mon Jun 1 14:46:57 2015 UTC,"Haha, I love Diane rehm, she seems to have interesting topics and guests on that keep me listening. I wish she didn't sound 800 years old, though. I feel like she's going to keel over and die in almost every interview.   I really can't think of any particular program that is so left that I can't listen. I'm liberal on a lot of stuff but I lean libertarian on some things, war, fiscal policy, individual liberty, but I can listen to the opposite side of that even and come away with a better understanding. I enjoy it, I'm far less passionate about politics because I no longer feel like ""I'm right they're wrong"".

NPR,37wgad,z960849,2,Sun May 31 23:40:03 2015 UTC,"Do you find that the level of depict on NPR and conservative talk shows are on the same level? To elaborate, we get Huckabee's talk show where I live, as well as a few others, and as much as it pains me to listen to it, I do sometimes, to get a balanced view. The last time I listened, I couldn't help but think, ""wow, the political savy of this is BRILLIANT."" Even though the surface logic is pure conservative (What's the word I'm looking for here? Not dogma, but repeating what the audience wants to hear. Toe-ing the line or something like that), you could tell that the man hosting the show and his guest was spinning conversations to play right into the conservative mindset quite subtly. They were saying things that APPEARED to be logical conclusions, unless you didn't know about things such as ethos/logos/pathos, and the how to actually look into these topics yourself. In short, the man is a politician, and quite good.   I like to give credit where credit is due, and those conservatives know how to spin an article.  Do you ever get this feel from NPR?  P.S: I don't feel like this paragraph or two I wrote quite captures just how smooth and manipulative it was. It took me the better part of an hour to catch on just what was happening.

NPR,36sddz,NoDairyFruit,4,Thu May 21 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"Well first off, all of those jobs you listed in the beginning aren't minimum wage jobs and likely won't be affected much. Second, this is a grassroots movement. There is no federal $15 minimum wage. So areas where the cost of living necessitates a $15 living wage can do so, and the local economy will benefit. Wage stagnation is a problem, and most state constitutions explicitly state that the minimum wage should be a ""livable wage,"" but that idea has been long abandoned. It's time to start taking that seriously and start taking into consideration the local community's cost of living when setting wages."
NPR,36sddz,slarsson,-3,Thu May 21 19:44:52 2015 UTC,"Depending on the basic set of assumptions you would like to use to start, wages, prices, and inflation can all be expressed as linear functions of each other. However, the actually impact of adjusting wages like this would be a litte weird. It's almost impossible to tell what would happen if we suddenly changed minimum wage to $15. we aren't good at predict that. What we are good at doing is predicting what will happen given a unit-change in wages. This distinction is vital. We can (approximately) tell you how much prices and inflation will adjust if you increase wages by one monetary unit, but after that adjustment the world is a different place so trying to estimate the effect of this kind of wage hike is really really tough.  What is for sure: the labor market would respond, price levels would change, inflation would change, and there would be large-scale adjustments to individuals' preference structures with respect to certain types of goods as well as their incentives to work.  Personally, the last point is the most interesting to me as it plays on the inherent short-sightedness in people. Let's take a closer look at what I mean. When an individual sets his or her choice of optimal labor supply, price levels, wages, and expectations for future discount of savings/investment/Yada Yada come into play. The effect of an increase in wages like this is almost certainly nonlinear as the rational person would realize that inflation would likely catch up to them in the future vis-a-vis prices and interest rates. But, right now they are ahead of the curve so they adjust consumption and savings in the current period to maximize utility based on a belief about the distribution of effects from the wage hike. In every period after that, using Bayesian updating to adjust preferences and expectations based on the outcome of the last period, rational individuals would continue to adjust their labor supply, consumption and savings decisions all the way until the nth period. It's quite possible that, when we expand this our to infinity, we actually see no change in the individual's utility stemming from this wage hike, because the shock was isolated and the effects drowned out in time.  The odds of the increase resulting in things returning to equilibrium is very small. After all, things have never returned to their original stead states after any major economic event. The economy simply finds a new direction, pattern, and speed with which to baffle economists and torment graduate students.  So again, how is raising the minimum wage truly helping anything? Shouldn't we be more focused on all the other elements that make our minimum wage so unlivable? And just to clarify-- I'm not actually against raising the minimum wage. I'm against raising it to $15."

Not sure how I feel about those, honestly. One of the reasons I go to NPR is for the lack of commercials and commercialism and I find these ads a bit off-putting. However, these are pretty tastefully done and not TOO intrusive, and entertainment-type shows don't have the same journalistic bias concerns which are more relevant even now than in the 1960s.   And I definitely disagree with Ira Glass. NPR is one of the last non-commercialized bastions we can turn to in our heavily commercialized society. If he wants to make a profit, he can leave public radio.   I HAVE noticed that of ALL of the many public radio shows I subscribe to via podcast, TAL and Car Talk are the only two which don't allow access to the back catalog of shows without paying. That is, one can only listen to the current episode for free (unless you've been subscribed and your podcatcher is set to automatically download new episodes - then you can listen to anything previously downloaded since you first subscribed, but still can't stream undownloaded old episodes).   This practice left a bad taste in my mouth. I used to LOVE TAL, but have drifted away over time, and I think it's partly because of this.

Assuming I support my local station and said station carries a given show, and I decide to podcast that show, then my direct support of the local affiliate station is being funneled to the show by means of their subscription (or whatever the fee is called which allows them to broadcast the show). Thus I am already supporting the show, and ostensibly have been for a long time. Not sure having to pay MORE for archives is really fair.   I haven't settled this in my mind, it's more of a raw thought."
NPR,35smg0,tarrasque,3,Wed May 13 20:24:02 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that your member station dues only go so far to directly supporting the content directly. I mean, things get paid for, but hosting servers are expensive (I know, I run a handful personal, private servers for my household, and although that cost is comparatively small, it's still a cost).  Also have to consider the number of people who would podcast archives without ever paying member dues. Member dues go to support the OTA transmission and access, but a separate subscription directly to the show supports just that: the show. So that's how I reconcile the costs, my member dues pay for all the shows, and the local newsroom, and the OTA signal and my member station. If I want that content in a vastly different medium, I'm willing to pay a token amount for that access knowing it supports the show directly.  Again, it really depends on how it's implemented. No archives, that's bad. Free open archives are just as bad in the long run. A period of time where people can go back and fetch archives for free before having to pay a little (and as long as the subscription is reasonable), it's not offending to me. But that's just my take.  Either way, the podcasting and overt-monetization of public radio shows is, frankly, stupid and completely antithesis of what public radio as an institution is all about."
NPR,35smg0,GringodelRio,1 point,Wed May 13 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right in that it IS a vastly different medium, and station dues don't necessarily support the entire thing.   I guess I wouldn't mind paying a token amount for archives either, in the vast scheme of things. It's still a lot of great content for a very small cost.    Either way, the podcasting and overt-monetization of public radio shows is, frankly, stupid and completely antithesis of what public radio as an institution is all about.   I most definitely agree with you there, except in that I LOVE that most NPR shows are available via podcast - this feature lets me listen to my shows when my mind is most receptive - during my runs. I just couldn't go back to music. Never."
NPR,35smg0,tarrasque,1 point,Wed May 13 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"Oh I love the podcasting part, it's just combining it with overt-monetization that's the problem."
NPR,35smg0,GringodelRio,1 point,Thu May 14 12:29:20 2015 UTC,"Also, station fees are pitifully low and don't come anywhere near covering the operating costs of a show. (Science Friday is independently produced, so anyone can find their 990 tax forms. They got $322,000 from stations in 2013 against $2,000,000 in expenses.)  The question shouldn't be ""What would I be willing to pay?"" It should be ""How do these shows remain sustainable?""  Government funding of public radio is very small and constantly under threat. Private foundations don't fund ongoing operating costs. Stations pay a comparative pittance to get these shows. They're expensive to make. I don't think anyone likes corporate advertising. But what is the better option?"
NPR,35smg0,7estu,2,Fri May 15 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I cannot say what the better option would be. I know part of the problem is how the entire NPR/PBS scheme is run (local members donate to local stations, who buy programming from NPR National, who buys programming from independent producers, etc.).  I really do think part of the problem is this nesting-doll setup. It works, but I don't think it works overly well. Evidence of that fact is the number of times each year they go on the air actively guilting people into paying. I pay almost every year, sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes I take a bonus from work and cut 50% of it straight over to them (and then immediately report that to work who does dollar-for-dollar matching), but the pledge drive comes on, Google Play comes on. I think most people understand they support Public Radio/TV, and maybe the pledge drives and the guilting is what is required to get a few people to go ""enough all ready! Take my damn visa and shut up!"".  I think that ultimately the Internet eventually is going to force NPR to turn itself on it's head. What that will look like, remains to be seen. I'm torn, between wanting to see more of a unified NPR presence (no more member stations, there is just NPR and their regional (timezone) broadcast centers in each time zone: NYC/DC, Chicago/Houston, Denver/Phoenix, and Los Angeles/Seattle. There is a part of me that would love to turn on the radio and hear a very powerful, regional producing system NPR MountainWest, producing amazing regional content and presenting national and international information with local producers.  There is a part of me though that would rather NPR member stations become more local. I get a lot of international news and national news from BBC, /r/News, any of the major news orgs. Turning on Colorado Public Radio and getting all of that feels like a waste, when I'd love to have more local news, local interest, local history.  So as far as news, either way is a win and a loss at the same time.  In the end, NPR is going to have to figure out it's cash flow scenario because if it drives content producers to start looking into commercializing, then the Public part of Public Radio has been lost. Just sell it to clear channel and be done with it at that point (which is what certain factions of our political spectrum want). I do think a stop-gap to that will be direct listener support via podcast archive memberships or donations. If people start supporting programs instead of stations, things will get interesting."

It's about having the money to sustain the quality programming."

This is just staying in the black, staying in existence, or keeping the lights on.   What I do have a problem with is Glass' comment about commercialization. In context, the term means switching to a buy/sell model with a profit motive. Not cool given the purpose and mission of public radio."
NPR,35psg4,GringodelRio,20,Tue May 12 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"Public Radio worker bee here.  The issue is funding.  When we tell our listeners that we need their support to continue/enhance/add to programming, it's the absolute, 100% truth.    Many mid-size market stations don't even have a local news department.  Our station has 3-4 reporters, but it's new in the last 3 years and some wear other hats within the organization as well.  ""How much"" or ""How well"" a station can do local news/content comes down, exclusively, to budget allowances.  And really, it needs to be consistently funded - not talking grants here because once that grant runs out, you've built an expectation that you might not be able to fulfill in the future.  So...long story short.  Want more out of your local NPR affiliate?  They need more out of you to make it happen.  If you're not a member, become one.  Get involved.  Tell your friends, volunteer, etc.  And if you are already a member, THANK YOU!  And maybe consider increasing a buck or two a month.  We can stretch that dollar a LONG way."
NPR,35psg4,bigj7489,7,Tue May 12 20:58:36 2015 UTC,"I already am a member, $240/year mark. But each year I call that into question when I turn on the radio and after a while hear the same thing repeated. I still cut the check because it's a worthwhile investment, but for our local station I really would have rather them invested in expanding their news department than build a whole music station with DJ staff."
NPR,35psg4,bigj7489,5,Tue May 12 21:05:05 2015 UTC,"First of all, THANK YOU for supporting public radio!  There are quite a few stations that are fit that description (separate music and news stations) and ideally it should suit your needs...when a station makes that change (and I dont know if CPR recently did...they have OpenAir too, which IDK), it should allow for more of what everyone likes.  Give them time to build it.  Share your feedback.  And most importantly, keep up your support.  Program fees are ridiculously expensive and local production costs are even moreso.  I can't emphasize enough - get involved, ask questions, volunteer - you'll appreciate more than ever the service you're supporting."
NPR,35psg4,acdha,3,Tue May 12 23:37:36 2015 UTC,"OpenAir is weird, and not really the way I thought they would go when they announced having a new/local music station.  CPR is large enough that volunteering is pretty much not existent. It's a big enough market which is why some of their investments confuse me while the coverage of news isn't getting better. They've grown their newsroom, but they haven't thought about partnering with Rocky Mountain PBS's iNews to share resources for example. They've hired a gal with a thick British accent to run an arts report magazine program. Different priorities."
NPR,35psg4,bigj7489,3,Wed May 13 01:10:20 2015 UTC,"If you have any ability, please belabor the executives with a clue-stick until they start accepting online payments to opt-out of the fundraising weeks. We donate every year but I want to reconsider it multiple times a year when my local station's programming is ruined for a week of endless requests for money.  More concisely: I donate $240/year. I would cheerfully increase that it if meant I could use NPR One to listen to something of interest rather than “Your donations help us to…”. This would be even more powerful if it allowed you to favor certain programs so e.g. the station would be able to tell whether the more expensive shows are worth it or if they might get more interest from newer programming."

NPR,35psg4,Hank_Scorpio74,11,Wed May 13 12:42:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's an unfortunate reality that even non-commercial radio has to be commercial.  They're dependent on getting members to pledge, and corporate benefactors to sponsor programs.  All of that means they need to play the hits, and in this case all of the nation programs you mentioned are what people tune in for.    Cartalk is a great example of this.  It is still a major hit for NPR, and there's no guarantee its replacement will be.  No NPR station is required to carry it, or schedule it during prime Saturday hours, yet they often do.  This tells you how important they view Cartalk to their success.  I think it would be fair to say that most listeners view the national programs as the strength of their local station."
NPR,35psg4,jumbotron9000,4,Tue May 12 15:12:25 2015 UTC,"I think there would be a lot more people tuning in if there was more variety. After an hour of Morning Edition or all things considered, I'm done. Off to another channel. Colorado Matters is good but the magazine format is overdone and boring. ""Let's spend only 5 minutes in a Q&A session barely scratching the surface of anything"". Graaand.  Replacements can be successful, it just takes a willingness to try. And I know a lot of people who like the national shows, but would tune in more if there was more content. I'd listen every day if there was a local evening news program, and again, if they broke in live to cover major breaking news it would be my go-to source. Instead I have to look elsewhere. Opportunity lost."
NPR,35psg4,Hank_Scorpio74,5,Tue May 12 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"I think there are two types of listeners. People who turn the radio on in the morning and listen all day, and people who drift in and out.  NPR seems to program for the people who drift in and out.  There are replacements, I'm a part of the NPR listener panel and they will email us links to clips of new shows on occasion.  My local affiliate has actually picked a couple of these shows up, but they play later at night during the week.  None so far have moved to a better slot.   My guess is the majority of listeners fall into the ""drifter"" category and want to hear the hits."
NPR,35psg4,Hank_Scorpio74,2,Tue May 12 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"I think they attract what they offer. So the question is, how many are ""drifters"" by choice, and how many are so because that's what's being offered."
NPR,35psg4,mohuohu,5,Tue May 12 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"I suspect most drift by choice.  It's difficult for me to always listen on a regular schedule, I like that I can pick up ME later on and at least catch the beginning of the show."
NPR,35psg4,handsy_pilot,2,Tue May 12 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"I think most people are unable to listen on a regular schedule, but I think most people are used to programming being fluid and not fixed.   I don't think NPR should be concerned if someone missed the first 10 minutes of Morning Edition by repeating it over and over for hours. If you missed it, you missed it. Morning Edition has moved on to other things, or a new program has started. The vast majority of listeners are going to be ""in the car"" listeners. They'll listen to whatever is on while they're in the car, as long as it isn't terrible.  I think if you asked people if they like Morning Edition for example, you'll get a lot of people saying yes, they do. Now if you ask if they purposefully tune in (as in make it a priority) versus it just being what's on when they get in the car, I think you'll get a very low response to this.  I have tried for example making NPR part of my whole morning routine. Turning it on when I wake up, and listening in until I get into the office. About 2.5 hours total. Can't do it, because after 60 minutes it replays. So I move on, that's an audience member that is now wandering away."
NPR,35psg4,sadatay,3,Tue May 12 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"I hear what your saying, but the purpose of morning edition is to provide a morning news hour for commuters to catch up on national news that isn't the 25 minutes per hour of traffic and weather + the top five local news stories and the top three news stories repeated over and over offered on most local news radio stations for commuters.   The real problem is that most people are either asleep or commuting from 4-10 am. When it's very early, why not run the national broadcast rather then produce a local show for very few listeners.    During the commute prime time, most people can't listen for more than an hour, and a superior product is still being offered against your local am ""traffic and weather on the fives"" news station, or the conservative talk stations.  After 10, in my experience, more local programming takes over, but I've only sampled LA/SF/NYC.   If I were you, I'd supplement your morning routine with podcasts.  I'm not going to research your profile history to figure out your demographic, but check out  TBTL.  The hosts are both NPR alums of varying stripes, and the show is generally a fun commentary on things in news and culture that an npr listening redditor might enjoy."

NPR,35psg4,countykerry,3,Tue May 12 16:30:42 2015 UTC,"Those are also comments coming from people who read a blog about public radio.  The people who were surveyed, and I'm guessing were a larger cross-section, don't mention the repetition as being an issue.    It goes back to the fundamental difference in our viewpoints, a difference we're going to have to agree to disagree on, and that is the question of whether more people are casual listeners of NPR than are diehard listeners."
NPR,35psg4,mpjanssen,3,Tue May 12 16:53:58 2015 UTC,"I know it's only anecdotal, but most of the people I know who listen to public radio pretty much only listen to public radio.  We're kind of having a chicken/egg discussion here, in my view. Are people casual listeners or are they die hards? If they only listen in the car, but they listen every time they're in the car, which are they? Are they listening for that one special program, or will they pretty much listen to whatever is on."
NPR,35psg4,Bill_Nihilist,3,Tue May 12 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"Whereas most of the people I know who listen to public radio switch the station at 8am.  The station I can receive in my car (except for when I can't) stop ME at 8am for classical music until 4pm when it picks up ATC.  Often on my commute I'm listening to music as I don't have a choice to listen to ME (without streaming over my iPhone.)  It does bring an interesting point up: can you really program a station for a listener who only listens in the car?  They have 168 hours a week to program, and the person in the car is only listening for 4 hours a week (the national average commute is 25 minutes.)  Can you program for somebody who will only consume your product for four specific hours each week?"
NPR,35psg4,bmoffett,1 point,Tue May 12 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"You can, as long as you're not worried about them hearing the same thing at 9am as the listener at 7am heard. I think this is where they're going wrong with the repetition. If they just offer programming based on the duration of the show, and have different content each block, people will still be happy. If Morning Edition runs local time 7a-8a, then ""Local Edition"" (local news) runs form 8a-9a, people will get different content, and if they really want the other, they'll tune in or they'll stream it later.  Overall I think NPR stations should use the real-time nature of radio to be real time. If someone wants a specific program at a specific time, then that's where NPR One can step in.  Just like television. If I want to watch <insert show here> I watch it when it airs, or I stream it later. They aren't going to replay that show for 3 hours to make sure that those tuning in at 7,8, and 9 all get to see it."

Analog TV signals, which could be easily picked up by audio-only sets already in existence, have already gone the way of the dodo. Shortwave and AM/FM is next if we don't use it."

The public radio station where I work subscribes to it because it is the most listened to hour of the week. Most listened to hour = charge more for underwriting spots to run during. It's followed closely by the 5 pm hour of ATC and 7 am hour of ME. I agree with your assessment, to be fair, just shedding light on why stations keep it around."
NPR,35psg4,sadatay,4,Tue May 12 17:57:15 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason it's continuing to be so highly rated is they're doing a bang up job of not pointing out it's officially off the air. The broadcasts aren't edited to remove the call-in number, so anyone listening in who hasn't followed Cartalk in detail is going to think this is new stuff unless they've heard a particular installment before.

NPR,35psg4,ovejavoladora,3,Tue May 12 18:07:16 2015 UTC,Not replacing it shows to me a lack of innovation on NPR National and the Member Stations.   You seriously underestimate the popularity of this program. Its immense fan base is the reason NPR has kept it on the air.

Right now, it's a rock they're trying to get a last few drops of blood from. It has a finite shelf-life.  A program director would be seriously looking for quality alternatives. They may not come up with that replacement today, or tomorrow, but after over a year, a replacement should have been found. Any program director that isn't looking to fill that spot with something fresh and new, versus just replays of old content, isn't doing his/her job. It's taking the easy way, for now.

Now Sanders hasn't done anything to actually merit a segment, but they have agreed to ""cover them equally"". So NPR is effectively campaigning for Sanders.

Smaller candidates can gather around one force, like Sanders and overwhelm Clinton. Iowa democrats are more progressive than the national average.  Conservatives here are very conservative and liberals are very liberal. These Clinton foundation scandals aren't going to stop. Something could implode her candidacy.

Instead it emphasizes workers' self management of the workplace  and decentralized structures of political government  asserting that a society based on freedom and equality can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite.  Libertarian socialists generally place their hopes in decentralized means of direct democracy and federal or confederal associations  such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions, and workers' councils.   All of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian  and voluntary human relationships  through the identification, criticism, and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life.

Basically, there are different companies that handle the rights and royalty payments for terrestrial radio and online streaming of shows which contain copyrighted music.   Part of the digital rights rules is that you may not offer your program in a manner which may be stored by a listener digitally. In other words, streaming is ok, but a podcast is akin to recording and distributing music free of charge.   Part of the reason for this is that artists are paid by the number of listeners who hear their music. The formula is sort of complex, but you take the number of people streaming the show and multiply it by the number of times the song is played. With a podcast, you can only know how many times the song is downloaded--and then the person can keep it forever.

NPR,33s2ve,EmoticonIlliterate,7,Sat Apr 25 03:50:36 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, lower taxes and additional funding for their private schools.  Since the school funding is directly related to property taxes, the less the school spends the less you have to spend for property taxes.  Additionally, they (the state says illegally) are using the some of the public funds to pay for special needs programs in their private schools.  The funding is supposed to go to the public schools so everyone can reap the benefits of it, however, they are sending much of it in their private schools.  Ultimately it comes down to a combination of money and willingness to participate in a secular school system.  To make the issue even more difficult, along with veins of legitimate anti-semitism that do occur in the district, the orthodox jews try to brand people, who argue that there is a real money problem, as anti-simetic.    The reporter does a great job on balancing the facts of the situation, while not downplaying that there are also legitimate racial tensions at play."

They also use this often in conjunction with the ""see, everything is better privatized! Profit-driven capitalism is a cure-all!"" But they're rigging the game. THEY are both sides, so they can make the government schools (where they don't stand to make a bunch of money) terrible, blame it on government, spend that same money on their for-profit school, virtually monopolize education, and make a shit ton of money. And who knows, maybe we'll educate a kid or two. If we get to it."

I think this just shows how far they are willing to go to make sure their children go to a religious school.  I would see it more motivated by profit if a third party owned the private schools or if outsiders went to the schools.  However, it's really the community that run the schools that also use the schools.  It's like eating at your own restaurant.  It's not so much that they're making a profit, but that they are avoiding giving their children a secular education for a lot less than it usually costs."

With the way the law is set up, the only way for them to have both of those is to defund the public schools, and the only way they can do that is to show up to vote.

NPR,32t6bs,Aloket,4,Thu Apr 16 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"I listened to The Takeaway instead of Morning Edition for awhile when another local station used to broadcast it. I see that Celeste Headlee is no longer on (it's been awhile since it's been gone from my market).  The loss of Talk of the Nation has in my opinion been hugely detrimental. I don't think Neal Conan was all that involved with Science Friday, but I agree that the show declined after losing the TotN connection (maybe Ira Flato had something to measure up to back then). One thing I still remember is how Ira Flato promised that Science Friday would continue to use the TotN music and then within a week or two stopped using the TotN music. Granted, the old music didn't fit with a science show. (Also the new music isn't an improvement; I feel like it sets the tone for a mediocre couple hours.)  I have deeply mixed feelings about A Prairie Home Companion, depending on which segment or feature. It's surprisingly tacky sometimes; leave the lack of class for Wait Wait."

I find wishing for horrible things to happen to Garrison, and he seems like a very nice man! I really don't want that, I just don't want to ever have to hear the show again.  The worst is that he may choose a successor, god I hope not but he was absent for a few weeks a while back and they had another host doing the show.  Ugh.

I don't like Here and Now, I just don't, and I sort of wait for The World to be over whenever I hear it. I'd much rather have Talk of the Nation back but that seems unlikely.  Radiolab is great, and there are other great podcasts you can listen to to cover the gaps in your NPR listening. I really like the Dinner Party Download, This American Life, The Diane Rehm show, and a bunch of others.   I also use NPR One when I don't like the show that is playing. They've added some 'vintage' content which is interesting to listen to to see if it's still in the news and how the story has evolved.  And finally, NPR is like nothing else out there. It's just in a category by itself. Support it, give feedback and listen to podcasts, but I feel like you'll be missing a lot if you give up on it."

It was usually lighter in tone than those two shows, but still as well done.  NPR canceled it claiming lack of listeners and corporate sponsorship, but the fact is it was one of NPR's fastest growing shows at the time.  I think given the lineup of talent involved it was too expensive to produce."

I liked to focus on emotional appeals and tell the story of the first time I pledged and how that felt, etc.  I don't think of my own lines when I'm listening to a pledge drive but I'll stay tuned for a few minutes and empathize with the announcers until it gets too repetitive and I have to change the channel"

NPR,31zwv3,themanwithsomename,-6,Fri Apr 10 06:30:10 2015 UTC,How many people who got measles were vaccinated?
NPR,31zwv3,filledesinge,5,Fri Apr 10 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"Well, roughly 3% of fully vaccinated and 7% of partially vaccinated individuals could contract measles.  Vaccines, like any other medical treatment, are not 100% effective in 100% of the individuals who get them.  So, if a vaccine is 90% effective, that means that if 100 vaccinated people came into contract with measles, 10 would contract the illness.    In the case of measles, the MMR vaccine has an effective rate of 93% for one dose received and 97% for two doses received (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/measles/faqs-dis-vac-risks.htm).  This means that if 100 fully vaccinated people came into contact with someone who had measles, 3 of those individuals could contract measles.    Now, measles is incredibly contagious because it is an airborne virus.  90% of unvaccinated individuals who come into contact with the disease will contract it (http://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/transmission.html)."

Vaccines aren't 100% effective because everyone is a little different.  It's the same reason why measles doesn't cause infection in 100% of the individuals who come into contact with it or why some people were immune to the bubonic plague during the black death.  A 97% effective rate for ANY medical treatment is pretty damn good though.  Because vaccines aren't 100% effective, we rely on herd immunity (I can't fucking wait to hear you say that isn't real) to protect individuals for which the vaccine isn't effective, the immunocompromised, and those too young to receive the vaccine.  You can't really be this ill-informed...can you?  Do you know any medicine or medical treatment that is 100% effective 100% of the time?  If you do, you should publish in the New England Journal of Medicine."

Remember that advertising is the bulk of revenue, but ad prices are advertised based on circulation. If you support local media and urge others to do the same, more coverage will follow.  The other thing to consider is alternatives to traditional media. Our market includes a lot of alternative options, online and in print. That competition means that legacy pubs are actually competing for interesting coverage. Take a look at newsstands and local News Twitter accounts, there's probably a site or tabloid that is looking for new readers who are tired of the old guard.  The last thing I'll say is that local coverage is driven by local interest. More than any other form of government, municipal governments affect our daily lives. And yet coverage of council and board meetings are generally attended by a small handful of local press and an even smaller handful of people with business before the government. Increase public interest and coverage will improve. And that might seem like saying, ""Make the news interesting and the press will cover it,"" but really that's always been the case. Trouble is, since Watergate, the public has viewed all levels of government with cynicism and disdain. So if the only stories that get read are failures of governance, and the only ones showing up at local meetings are the press, then that's the only thing that'll get covered.   We can affect that change. It starts by getting involved. Go to a meeting. Write your local representative and ask them to meet with you.

NPR,30k90k,pateras,9,Sat Mar 28 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"As a student of ancient Greek, it bothers me that English doesn't have a gender neutral pronoun. It actually makes a lot of grammatical sense. English also needs a word for 2nd person plural other than ""Y'all"" or ""You guys""."
NPR,30k90k,Joelsaurus,3,Sat Mar 28 04:27:56 2015 UTC,They/them are already accepted as gender neutral singular pronouns. It's just problematic because they're far more frequently used as plural pronouns.

Colin is clearly surrounded by sycophants who won't tell him the truth, that he sounds like a drunken, gibbering baboon on the mic, and that not everything is a laughing matter (and even if it is, nearly all of his attempts at wit fall flat).

An interesting perspective would be how the company that makes MTG is behaving like a responsible central bank, demonstrating that people can behave responsibly when they put their long term gain above their short term goals, whil at the same time people produced bitcoin because they didn't trust central bankers doing what this nerdy game company was 100% capable of doing and succeding at for over 20 years.

To me it seems the phrase....   "" to create a more informed public, one challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and culture within the United States and across the globe.""  .....   can be taken to mean ""to inform the public of certain events, ideas, and culture within the United States and across the globe.""

Some people will say NPR as a whole is liberal, others will point out statistics that say it actually has a conservative bias. I think the truth is NPR helps the status quo whoever they be and whatever bias/agenda they carry. This was evident during the Snowden revelations and NPR had guest after guests from the intelligence agencies using their mics to say the same talking points. These talking points were straw man arguments, red herrings, attacks of character and almost all were unchallenged by any other guests and host. The callers were also handled in a similar manner as unpatriotic, traitors, anarchist, weirdos. Pretty eye opening and surreal behavior from Diane Rehm.  You also have to pay attention where the guest come from. You'll often see guests from the American Enterprise Institute, owned by the Koch brothers, who use NPR for their propaganda. Same goes for fracking, and anything energy related. The Brookings Institute often has guests on as well."

NPR,2y5rrp,jsabatier,7,Fri Mar 6 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"The clock, niche audiences and cultural voices  Having produced our show, Deemable Tech, specifically for the radio and now only for the podcast, I think the biggest differences between public radio shows and public radio podcasts are that hosts and producers can breath a sign of relief, knowing that they don't have to take a break exactly at 12:29 on the A Segment and 18:59 into the B Segment, etc. We can let our shows naturally flow. We still have to run the show and not let it run us, but we can let conversations happen naturally without arbitrarily ending them because ""we have to take a short break."" We can also run a show that is only a few minutes or one that is a couple hours long. There is so much more flexibility in the format than the radio clock allows.  The second thing that I have found is that because we are on the internet, we can find our audience instead of having to refine our show for the radio audience. When we started Deemable Tech, we tried to appeal to a general radio audience. Instead of appealing to more people, we found that it was just a watered down version of what our core audience wanted and less people enjoyed it as much. When we decided to give up the ""radio show dream"" and go all in with the podcast our core audience loved it! We have better download and subscription numbers than ever before. We are making the show that our niche audience loves. As much as I would love for it to happen, I never expect any public radio station to air an hour-long tech news show, but our audience loves it and shares it.   I'm not saying that podcasts can't have general appeal, but the freedom to do a show that the general audience wouldn't like is a lot of fun.  I also feel like you can be more ""natural"" with your voicing in podcasts. I hear more black, hispanic, asian and regional accents on podcasts. I feel like podcast listeners are more accepting of a culturally spiced voice. You don't have to put on your ""public radio voice."" I know that I personally allow my southern accent to sneak out on the podcast, whereas I would never do that on the radio."
NPR,2y5rrp,RayHollister3,6,Fri Mar 6 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"I think for starters, in public radio podcasts hosts and reporters can ""geek out"" more about their topics because they have a self selected audience that already has an interest and presumably knows more of the jargon."
NPR,2y5rrp,SirChompers,3,Fri Mar 6 19:19:43 2015 UTC,"When I'm listening to stories on public radio and podcasts, the biggest differences I notice are the story's pace, how producers move the story forward and how producers get your attention. I think you can chalk that up to podcasts' creative liberties. The use of music in podcasts to set the mood and direct listeners' attention is great example of that creative liberty. Podcasts aren't just telling you a story, like what you hear during All Things Considered. They are trying to get you absorbed into a topic. I'm not saying basic stories or shows on public radio can't do that because I've had driveway moments, but I think that podcasts use their independence to explore the concept of the ""Theatre of the Mind."""

That's what I think podcasts can do, and it's a frontier I don't think terrestrial radio has quite crossed yet. Even Radiolab and TAL, which come close at their best, have a slightly diluted broadness to them which (I reckon) comes from the need to appeal to a nationwide, and often rather old, audience."

The station's broadcasting power and transmitter location(s) are public records available from the FCC. For example, WHYY. The search is here.

This may take a while to implement.  For anyone reading these comments, the FCC itself maps the broadcast range (click the service contour map link for this)"
NPR,2wxiq2,MB6,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:07:40 2015 UTC,"yeah, radio is regulated very tightly and all stations are mapped. It would be really nice if you could use the -60 dbu contour to do the mapping."

It would also be nice if it told you at what mile marker you needed to change it over to have no loss in programing.
NPR,2wxiq2,fakeallentran,2,Tue Feb 24 01:30:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment.  The answer is that if you find a station you're happy with (either because it's the listed station, or you clicked on the location and found an alternate station) and it works the whole way through, then I've assumed you'll continue listening and disregard what the site says.  I agree - the mile marker function would be great.  Data on broadcasting power/range for each station is not readily available though - not to me at least - so I'd have to make some big assumptions."

NPR,2wxiq2,12INCHVOICES,3,Tue Feb 24 03:23:45 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, how does the mapping system prioritize stations? I did a sample trip from Harrisburg, PA to Miami and one of the stations listed is in West Virginia, which is a bit far off the route. It also suggests a small-town Georgia station instead of the Jacksonville, FL station, which I know is a much bigger market.  Anyway, don't take my question as a criticism, I just want to understand how to use the site better. Seems like a great resource and I'll definitely try to use it for my next trip!"
NPR,2wxiq2,ajkkjjk52,2,Tue Feb 24 01:13:51 2015 UTC,"Good question, and definitely happy to hear that you'll use it.  The site prioritizes on station distance, not station size/listenership.    I could try to list the bigger stations first, but there are lots of locations I'm not too familiar with.  (As a side benefit, the site should give some exposure to the smaller affiliates, and maybe even result in some donations.)  In more detail, the site's built on Google Maps, which returns a list of route steps (eg, turn left here, turn right there) after receiving a directions request (eg, Savannah to Santa Monica).  For each route step, it returns the closest station, if it was closer than the last station.  The prioritization question (an important one for listeners) is why I have the click-on-the-location function, so that you can see all the stations that should be available (not just the closest).  Hope this helps!"
NPR,2wxiq2,MediocreJerk,2,Tue Feb 24 01:32:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay -- I was wondering why it'd have me switch to a small station on the Georgia/Florida line when I could probably pick up the Jax transmission from that same spot, but it makes more sense of they coincide with 'steps' in the trip.    Anyway, I can't imagine it's easy to program a computer to make all these decisions so even if it has some tiny faults, I applaud the effort. Seems like it could be pretty useful, and I like the slick, simple design."

NPR,2vqerv,handsy_pilot,13,Fri Feb 13 12:00:05 2015 UTC,"It's very much like aresef explains. The whole thing was a little over 2 hours long, there were plenty of jokes that were a little risque that I can tell will get cut out. They went on for like 15 minutes about 50 Shades of Grey. It was way better than on the radio. At one point something kind of off-color was said and everyone was laughing so hard, and Peter said, ""Aren't you glad you went to the live taping"". At the end of the show there was about 5 minutes of retakes of Peter re-asking questions or reintroducing people more clearly or concisely, which is what will make it to the radio. It was great to see the behind the scenes aspects of one of my favorite shows.   The celebrity guest on the phone was Lance Bass, and in person, the interview lasted about 25 minutes and was a lot of fun. At the end there was a question and answer session which was great because it showcased how quick and witty the hosts are since it is obviously not scripted.   During the  Q&A, there was a loud speaker pop that startled the audience, and with out missing a beat, Peter said, "" I guess that was someone standing their ground, I think that is how that works,"" obviously referencing the Zimmerman/Martin case since this show was in Orlando. The funniest moments are the stuff that happens that you know won't make it to the show. All in all it was a 10/10 experience. Worth every penny."
NPR,2vqerv,aresef,7,Fri Feb 13 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but it worked like this when I was at a taping.  -GM of the host station comes up to thank you all for coming etc.  -Intros of the hosts and panelists  -Show. If the guest is in person, there will be a really nice chair for them to sit in. The interview is often cut a whole bunch for time and content.  -After the recording, they bring up a random member of the crowd and quiz them. If they win (I mean, maybe if they don't too), everybody there gets a prize. In our case, tote bags. I mean, it's NPR after all."

I specifically remember one round of jokes where they made fun of Shawn Kemp and his many children, because he grew up in the town where the taping was. It was all cut out. Also, (I think it was) Charlie Pierce went on about St. John's mascot and the bird that doesn't stop flapping his wings for anything during basketball games. He brought it up incessantly and all iterations of it were cut out of the show. Funny, Pierce got booed when he was introduced because he had written an article about our area a few years prior that didn't shed the best light.  -After, there was a Q&A with the audience for 5-10 minutes."

The Takeaway is slightly less bad.  I wasn't much of a fan of the call-in format, even with Neal and the producers -- quality overall is a bit too spotty.  I also think that ToTN was stretching by trying to fit two segments into a single hour -- after news breaks and other interruptions, 60 minutes is barely enough to stretch your legs in a good topic, and shoehorning a 10 minute segment at the end really didn't work.  I also found the Political Junkie segments too much of a focus on the horse race and not enough on issues.  Those grated on me.  But having yet another short-segment news magazine, I mean two more news magazines, really doesn't cut it.  For KQED, this means that 3am - 9am, 11am - 1pm, and then 3pm - 7pm are all U.S. centered national news programs.  What ToTN offered was a break from the same (or slightly different) brief treatments of the same sets of stories by diving into a longer exploration of, well, something.  Now only Michael Krasny's Forum (local call-in) and Terry Gross's Fresh Air give long-form daytime treatments.  PRI's The World at least breaks things up with international coverage.  But in general I find my self tuning out after Krasny, and often before.  I try to catch Gross -- she's good and an exceptionally skilled interviewer, covering a wide range of topics.  I also like the evening Specials programming, generally lectures.  But the 24/7 news beat:  gets tired."

ToTN had lots of issues, and the callers could be utterly asinine (myself included), but it was an opportunity to hear from all corners of the nation. Even the dumbass callers gave us an opportunity to explore a perspective more fully.

That was a surprise, but then it occurred to me, ""I'm not listening to NPR."" I was listening to the podcast, and maybe the broadcast cut of the episode had the usual outro, but the one I heard could use whatever outro they wanted. I think APM has really blown up, with a huge stable of podcasts that are pret a porte for broadcasting, I'm thinking particularly of the already syndicated Wits, but also Awesome Etiquette and Dinner Party Download. Whether they court NPR proper much or not doesn't matter, they're ultimately beholden to listeners, primarily through local stations.

Chicago Public Media is the parent company, WBEZ is one of its several familiar brands, This American Life is the product, and PRX is the method of distribution.  NPR doesn't really factor in here, apart from the fact that WBEZ happens to be an NPR member station. But NPR is not involved in the production or distribution of TAL."
NPR,2ursy4,eobanb,2,Wed Feb 4 21:19:16 2015 UTC,"Is there no relationship between Chicago Public Media and NPR (beyond the one established e.g. by WBEZ as you mention)?  Is there no way to fit NPR into the analogy?  Would it be a trade union like UAW maybe?  What exactly does PRX do as a distributor?  Are their business relationships with TAL, WBEZ, CPM, NPR, or some combination of these?"
NPR,2ursy4,37151292,10,Wed Feb 4 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"It's not really that hard to explain, and while the analogy is a good one it's a bit muddled.  First you have to understand that a public radio station uses programming from a variety of sources. Most stations are independently run from one another. So a station in California is not controlled by another station in, say, Mississippi.  These independent stations are therefore programmed by people working at that station. They use shoes from NPR, American Public Media and Public Radio Exchange (PRX). These entities create programming to be used by independent stations like the one you listen to.   Now these stations are somewhat like competitors. They are each trying to make the best programming to sell to independent stations. (It can get a little muddled, but the phrase ""member station"" is used by NPR to show that those stations have purchased and air the company's flag ship shows like Morning Edition and All Things Cinsidered. As far as I know, NPR is the only one to use the phrase. The designation also allows stations to get certain perks from NPR, like the occasional station-specific promo.)  Now when it comes to shows like This American Life it works a little differently. Some independent stations produce their own programming. In this case WBEZ in Chicago produces TAL. In order to distribute the show and make a little money the station will use a distributor like PRX to get the show out to other stations.   PRX was a distributor only for a number of years. In only the last few months they have moved to actually producing peogramming.  So hopefully that explains it for you.  TL;DR NPR, APR and PRX are competing companies i.e. Ford, Chevy and Honda.  Each show is the companies product i.e. This American Life = a car  The stations are like factories as well as consumers. WBEZ=factory and your station=the buyer."

As it stands, there is no precedent to say an unvaccinated child a) is not entitled to FAPE or b) FAPE would best be served by removing the child from his peers. Another important term is LRE -- Least Restrictive Environment. This means when we're making a decision about how a child is placed we need to make sure the environment offers them the most access to the services and benefits that their typically developing peers enjoy. Even if a district had the resources to teach each of these children at home (thereby ensuring FAPE) there's, again, no precedent that says the least restrictive environment for that unvaccinated child is at home.   I absolutely take the father's point and I think those parents who choose to leave their kids unprotected are acting in an ignorant and selfish manner, but from a legal standpoint I don't think the district has a right to remove students completely and deny them an education. But I wish their parents could be horsewhipped."

NPR,2u87ve,JayEmBosch,4,Fri Jan 30 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"""Pennies per hour"" is terrible and unfair, but isn't this sort of the way things are supposed to work? I thought the idea was that businesses employed people with major cognitive disabilities at a reduced rate to do jobs that require very basic skills while group homes and other such state-run organizations pay staff to work alongside people with disabilities as job/life coaches.  That way, the state provides housing and support to people who need it and businesses create positions which they don't need filled. At least in my area (central CT) this seems to be the way things work. A friend of mine works for minimum wage coaching several people who work for less than minimum wage doing jobs that don't actually need to exist. Those people live in state-funded housing.  This doesn't sound like a case of businesses getting cheap labor to do important jobs. At least in practice where I've seen it, businesses create a job so someone with a severe cognitive disability has a chance at self-actualization.  Is this run very differently elsewhere?"
NPR,2u87ve,mookieprime,4,Fri Jan 30 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"These 501(c)(3) ""non-profits"" benefit not only from exclusive government contracts bringing millions in business to them, but there are countless other ways to gain tax credits and profits from a ""non-profit."" You know the executives of these ""charities"" still make 6-digits a year in their position, right? Regardless, this is about the worth of their labor, which should be equal pay for equal work, which many of these disabled workers can perform with training and placement initiatives. I feel no concern over the creation of jobs that ""don't need to exist,"" as long as they pay the workers that fill them fairly.  Vermont got rid of these exemptions a decade ago, using the government money instead for job training and placement programs for disabled workers. They are doing far better than the rest of the nation at bringing disabled workers fully into the average workplace at standard wages. There is a prevailing perception amongst people with little to no experience with others with disabilities that they can not perform the same duties as most other workers, or are only good at tiny menial jobs that would otherwise be automated or non-existent. This is not true. Here in BC we outlawed sheltered workshops in 1996, and now we have 40-70% employment of disabled workers, depending on age. Vermont has 38%, U.S. average is 20%, and Texas has 7%. These sheltered workshop facilities are used to suppress labor costs, period, and hide behind the excuse that ""Well these people wouldn't be able to get REAL jobs anyway!"" which is patently false."
NPR,2u87ve,toastedbutts,0,Fri Jan 30 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"6 digit salaries for execs?!  Pretending that 150k is a BIG salary is just pushing down the middle class, man.

Yeah, that's a pretty damn BIG salary, especially when your labor is provided at lower than the standardly legal minimum. Are there worse offenders? Certainly. But the solution to ""this guy is exploiting people"" has never been, and will never be ""but that guy's exploiting people more."" You address both.

That's a pretty damn good ratio for a CEO.  But really, his job is to make sure they make money to go to their causes.    They distributed $48 million to their causes in 2013.  80x his salary.  I don't think that painting this guy as a villain is right.    150k is a living.  650k is a lot.    But would someone have done the same job for free, unless they were already wealthy?  I'm sure a lot think they would try, but I don't know if they ""could"".  It's not easy."
NPR,2u87ve,toastedbutts,2,Tue Feb 3 04:29:20 2015 UTC,"Using total number of employees below someone's position is a terrible metric for evaluating upper management and executive compensation, as they do not at all, directly oversee those jobs. And you know how completely easy it is for him to not be seen as a villain? Simply mandate that what already happens in most of his work centers has to happen in all of his work centers. Goodwill doesn't need the slightly increased margins they get for their relatively small amount of workers in sheltered workshop programs. As you said: $48 million to their causes in a year. How much would that suffer by simply mandating that ALL instead of MOST of your work centers pay minimum wage? I know that at least a few hundred DD workers would require significantly less charity to meet their needs, if that were the case.  And if you think $150K is a living, not a lot, I invite you to tell that to the faces of the 75+% of Americans who make significantly less than that. How in the hell are they getting by?? What with their obviously sub-livable wages and all?? Why would anyone even TAKE a job that pays LESS than $150K, which is 5x the average household income of 90% of Americans??"

NPR,2tvpdc,sadatay,8,Wed Jan 28 07:57:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with Ira that there is nothing inherently unprofessional about the vocal fry. Unfortunately the vocal fry in the pop culture zeitgeist is most commonly associated with so called ""valley girl"" speech patterns.   This subconscious association, when combined with coverage of a serious or personal topic (i.e. Invisibilia's episodes on mental illness) can put some people off."
NPR,2tvpdc,DankOverwood,16,Tue Jan 27 21:34:06 2015 UTC,"I still have a hard time hearing it.  Actually the most noticeable was when they were discussing it and I started noticing it in Ira's voice.  I think that's what gives him the unique sound that sets him apart.  I actually felt that it was more authoritative sounding.  The part that I found really amusing is that they only complained about the womens voices, and I thought it was more noticeable with Ira doing it.  So I do think it goes beyond just a voice issue, and if someone finds that a woman speaking authoritatively on a subject bugs them, then they will find a reason to hate their voice."

I don't have a big problem with vocal fry, but perhaps after hearing my perspective you understand how commenters may interpret a heavy use of the vocal fry as disrespectful or inappropriate.

I would have liked to have heard a lot more about the actual research and not just what sounded a lot like an opinion of one person who does research on speech.   Edit: Allow me to edit. People in the report singled out Chana Joffe-Walt. I do not notice it out of her, because she is generally restricting the fry to the end of a sentence. This is and was and will be a common way to convey the end of a statement or to lend gravity to a statement.   But, some people, like Sarah Vowell or Bill Clinton, speak with a rather consistently fried voice. It is this that annoys me. And I think I'm allowed.   Other example: Britney Spears singing versus...almost any other singer. She sings with fry on Hit Me Baby One More Time. Even those who cry misogyny probably don't prefer her singing voice to a less fried one. And it isn't because you are also a misogynist, it's because it doesn't sound pleasing to be constantly fried. It just doesn't."
NPR,2tvpdc,GammaTainted,8,Wed Jan 28 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the opinion of another person who does research on speech: Vocal fry is nothing new. There's a reason it has a half-dozen different names on wikipedia, and that's because it's been around since always. Men and women do it. Old people and young people do it. In Standard American English, it's used as a prosodic cue at the end of declarative utterances. In some other languages, it's even more common. Furthermore, not only is it not a pathology, but this voice therapy textbook actually lists it as a treatment method for a specific vocal fold lesion.  It is used as a cudgel against women exclusively, and young women in particular. But the truth is, everyone does it, it's always been there, and it's not going anywhere."
NPR,2tvpdc,dkinmn,-2,Wed Jan 28 14:17:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's likely that it is relatively new in media figures.  The perception of vocal fry is very different through a microphone and compressed signal. I've been a radio fan my whole life. It's definitely something that used to be discouraged in radio, whether from men or women. You can hear the difference between generations of NPR personalities or between news readers and reporters.   You are very aggressively insinuating that I must be a misogynist. At least that's how I'm sensing it. And I don't appreciate it."
NPR,2tvpdc,GammaTainted,7,Wed Jan 28 14:25:00 2015 UTC,"Vocal fry has been around forever. Everyone's always done it. Here's Dan Rather doing it. You can hear it in Walter Cronkite's voice too. Tom Brokaw does it, and here you can hear both Peter Jennings and Bill Clinton doing it. Note that I just linked the first video I found of any of them, because everyone does it all the time. It's normal. It's common. You've always been hearing it, whether you were focusing on it or not.  I'm not insinuating anything. I'm flat out saying that vocal fry has been around forever, and misogynists use it to attack the way women talk. Those are two demonstrable facts.

Edit: And your news reporter examples...they are doing it at the end of a sentence, and for one or two syllables. Now, compare this to Sarah Vowell, who will deliver an entire piece in a fried voice."

And even if someone like Sarah Vowel (who doesn't actually use fry that much, she just has a low pitched voice) used fry a lot, that's not that weird either. Some people use it more than others. Noam Chomsky, for example practically never leaves fry register."

NPR,2tvpdc,matsie,5,Wed Jan 28 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"I love how /u/GammaTainted critiquing your argument (and never critiquing YOU) somehow is meant to a) call you a misogynist (they didn't) b) make you feel bad (if you do, then that's on you and maybe you should evaluate why you feel badly) c) make them feel good (they were being pretty neutral the whole time).  The points /u/GammaTainted made: * Everyone uses vocal fry. * Some use it more often than others * Men use vocal fry just as often as women * Misogynists have used vocal fry as a means to deride women * Sarah Vowel does not use vocal fry as often as one may believe.  So if what you extracted from your exchange is that Gamma was accusing you of misogyny, then that's your own projection AND unwillingness to listen to what someone else was saying. They even conceded they understood what you were trying to say was that some folks' vocal fry bothered you more than others, but added that if that was the case, you should rephrase your critique to better reflect that.  Basically, you took offense to something not offensive at all."

One issue is that many if not most teenagers and women in their early twenties drop these mannerisms once they grow older, which leaves the rest of them looking like they are clinging on to attributes of youth in a similarly creepy way as hot pants are on a 48-year old mother. The other problem is that these are voices on a radio show. There are certain professions where the populace expects representatives to refrain from colloquialisms and the news is one of them. Imagine the president to talk like a teenager using ""totally"" and ""like"" all the time..."

NPR,2tayh5,dkinmn,3,Fri Jan 23 13:49:47 2015 UTC,"I've been an NPR listener since the late 80s when I listened to and from preschool with my dad in the car, and on Saturday mornings (also in the car). I LOVE that NPR and This American Life (among others) are working to create new original programming. I will likely find most of them fascinating and unmissable, but not every new program is going to speak to me.   About half-way through Serial, I found myself asking ""when will this become more than just listening to one person, thinking her thoughts out-loud? I enjoyed the concepts of trying to take the car ride to see if it was feasible, and I enjoyed the episode in which they went to the Innocence Project (or a similar group, I cannot remember and I apologize for that) because there was something debatable, and digestible... there was some meat to these parts. When it was just Sarah Koenig talking and qualifying everything time and again (paraphrasing, but things like""I'm not a lawyer"" ""I wasn't didn't talk to so-and-so, but I think it's safe to assume...""), it was like it was a parody of the tone and vernacular that has made This American Life so recognizable.   It left me begging for a thesis. Remember the Dopplegangers episode of TAL? Half-way through Bung segment, Ben Calhoun says (to effect) ""I don't even care if it's true, I can if it's possible now."" AWESOME. Then... then a few minutes later he admits that he's kind of rooting for the Bung to pass the test of ""will it be a convincing calamari substitute?""  I. AM. IN.   You have a thesis and a question to answer. EVEN IF IT'S A QUESTION OF OPINION. At least we know what we are driving at. I'm not just listening to your thoughts. So, yeah. Blerg.  Anyway... Invisibilia.   I wanted so badly to like this, but firstly, I have to agree with everyone in this thread who voiced complaints for the most part. The technical stuff is SO EASY TO GET RIGHT. Just take the file specs from TAL, Fresh Air, or ANY OTHER Public Radio podcast and match them. Right?  Also, the audio issues - I agree. The personality and commentary issues... that's more a style. Not what I wanted, but at least it's a choice, so a decision was made.   My biggest issue, though, was that this show got all this press, this HUGE push, and then it was like a poor imitation of Radio Lab. Don't misunderstand me - I LOVE radio lab, and Robert and Jad have really stepped up the game of public radio production, but we need to expand and be creative without sounding like it's just two other people doing the same thing.   I was really disappointed, because I was SO excited for another show, and then it just didn't deliver.   I don't want the show to be cancelled, and I really want these two women to keep making it. Hopefully it'll become something I can get into. And even if it doesn't, if it gets more people listening to NPR and Public Radio in general, I am all for it (I have similar, though more critical thoughts on Wits). I really don't want the people behind Invisiblia to feel bad about people like me thinking this way - I love love love public radio, and so I feel like I'm saying to a family member ""okay, good effort.... now, how about some better execution?""   Regardless, I am proud to be a sustaining member of my local station and a supporter and evangelist for NPR and Public Radio.   I just...yeah... I was bummed.   Edit: grammar, typos, and a few point of extra clarity"
NPR,2tayh5,BatBurgh,3,Thu Jan 22 23:05:40 2015 UTC,They have done what? 3 or 3.5 episodes? They need time to develop their story telling style. Radiolab has been on the air for years.
NPR,2tayh5,golf4miami,3,Fri Jan 23 03:27:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. 'Thoughts' was just too general of a subject for a podcast about human behaviour, and I found the first guy's inability to make a connection between his drowning sister and thoughts about people drowning to be completely idiotic—as if it was some sort of secret, obscure connection no normal person other than a Freudian psychologist could have made.  The 'fear' episode was excellent."
NPR,2tayh5,eobanb,1 point,Fri Jan 23 06:24:20 2015 UTC,Great analysis! And I'm glad to hear favorable finding on the second episode. I will definitely listen to the fear episode this weekend when I have the time. Thanks!
NPR,2tayh5,BatBurgh,3,Fri Jan 23 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"Agree, 100%. I hope it was clear from my (admittedly typo-ridden comments) that I'm pulling for them. We're all on the same team when it comes to better programming options than what commercial radio offers. I guess it was just nice to know that I wasn't the only one who felt let down by it, and struggled with those feelings. I don't think it's beneficial to take to virtually anonymous forums and spew nothing but an expression of distaste or dislike, and would much rather reserve my role in a discussion until I can offer something of value or construction to the conversation.   I really do hope they figure it out, and they certainly have the benefit of the infancy of this project to grow it and make it something of it's own essence. I guess all the plugging on the radio and the myriad other NPR podcasts I devour got my hopes unfairly high for something so new, especially considering that they are finding their voice as a show (as would be expected).   You make a great point and I hope they continue to grow and do well. Someone below said the 2nd episode was an improvement, and I'm really happy to hear that. The more quality content public media can produce, the better!"
NPR,2tayh5,BatBurgh,2,Fri Jan 23 15:17:25 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the show but yeah, I was pissed at the therapy thing. And when she gave her own bullshit idea about fear and sliders (may have been the TIL episode with them)  I still enjoyed it enough that I'll give them another few episodes"

NPR,2tayh5,12INCHVOICES,4,Fri Jan 23 04:36:40 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, I just didn't like the show at all. Their stories are nowhere near as compelling at Serial's big story. On top of that, it just sounds like RadioLab, except with two people that sound exactly the same. It gets really hard to make a separate personality for the two hosts because they sound so similar too.   Overall I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone looking to listen to more podcasts after hearing Serial. What I would recommend would probably be Start Up."
NPR,2tayh5,SalubriousStreets,4,Fri Jan 23 15:17:43 2015 UTC,I probably wouldn't have even noticed that they sound the same except they brought it up and then I couldn't un-hear it.
NPR,2tayh5,eobanb,2,Fri Jan 23 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"except with two people that sound exactly the same   A few years ago, people complained that on ESPN's Monday Night Football, two of the in-booth presenters (Jon Gruden and Ron ""Jaws"" Jaworski) sounded very similar.  I don't know if they did this in reaction to the complaints or not, but soon after I noticed they would both insert the other person's name in their sentences more often than you would in normal conversation.  Example:  ""I really liked that play formation.  One of your favorites, right, Jon?""  ""You got that right, Jaws! Spider 2 Y Banana!""

Any one of Netflix's many original series could have been named in the sponsorship announcement, but they (not sure if Netflix or NPR) specifically chose to mention House of Cards.
