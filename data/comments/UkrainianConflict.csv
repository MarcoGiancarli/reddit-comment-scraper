The ultranationalist group announced its plans to initiate a referendum on a vote of no-confidence in the Ukrainian authorities. At the rally, protesters demanded the resignation of Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov.  Field offices will be organized in all regions of Ukraine to work on the referendum starting from Wednesday, Yarosh announced at the rally, saying that those Right Sector centers will also act as “revolutionary committees.” Imposing martial law on the territory of Ukraine should also be put on the vote, he said.  “People must voice their attitude to what's happening in the country ... the government should know that if the people are not pleased with it, then it must go,” Yarosh said, as quoted by TASS. If the movement is not given the right to organize the referendum, then they will create their own election committee and “will vote independently on the whole territory of Ukraine,” he added."

The rebels are sending drunks to dig trenches. Can you imagine how lenient they are going to be to imprisoned criminals?  Obviously, a prison inmate is not going to like that one bit. He is going to have his own very skewed view of the situation. He also might retell stories he heard from friends.

I mean they are working on a couple oil pipelines both to the east and the west as well as gas lines with one bypassing Ukraine.

When the rouble was crashing there were live events and people celebrating. Now that Russia is slowly emerging out of that they are looking for things to satisfy their need.  They're out of luck. Those pipeline deals that Russia signed with China will start becoming active around 2019. Rosneft has also signed it's own private deal with China. The difference between China and the EU is that China has a growing need of natural resources while the EU doesn't that much.  The other thing is the fact that China is constructing a Silk road project and the heart of this will be the Eurasian Economic Union. About 50 billion of Chinese state investment will come which will no doubt have a multiplier effect on the entire region.   There is no need to feel bad for the Russians. The only way things can get worse is if they fuck it up like Ukraine did. If they do then it's a good time to laugh at them."

They have very little ability to fix this and what is even worse for them is that the best and brightest are migrating to EU countries like mine. It has become a huge political hot button even though it's good for us in the long run and bad for them.  You are also wrong about the other things. Medvedev and Putin have their differences.

I'd think the opposite is probably more accurate. The state controls the media. All the info you get is what they want you to hear.  People are not anti-Putin because of some sort of sinister xenophobia towards Russians, but because he's a dictator draining the country's wealth for his own means and attacking others, both internally and externally, to remain in power and brainwash his people. The dislike for Putin is because of a sympathy for ordinary Russians (and in the case of this sub, Ukrainians) not anti-Russian xenophobia. In fact, Russians who stand up to Putin for the cause of free speech, anti-corruption or democracy are usually lauded as heroes and given huge respect outside of Russia. Nothing to do with being Russian, all to do with dictatorship. See also the Dalai Lama, Malala Yousafzai, Aung San Suu Kyi.

Perhaps if you think the only reason someone might take a pro-Russian view in the conflict, and especially in the economic sphere, is due to being brainwashed; you are exposing yourself to a bais as well, selection or otherwise."

AS well as those on Putin's gravy train of course. Same in China, the middle-class has sold out the poor, the manual workers, the rural dwellers and their own freedoms for personal wealth. Not something I could do personally, as I have more self-respect, but clearly millions are capable of it."

The manual workers have benefitted from the current system, just as much as the middle class. In fact, the recession hit people like me, who travel outside of country often, much more than security guards making 30k rubles per month who are almost entirely uneffected. If anything Putins approval comes from the working class, and the middle class disdain almost cost him in the last election.

Plenty of problems in the social democratic system most of Europe experiences, but equating it with the current Russian system in terms of personal freedom is absurd."

They really need to shape up. They can only use Russia as an excuse for so long.  We don't really give a shit about Ukraine as a nation or a people. We want them to strengthen us and contain Russia so that one day it becomes a liberal pro-Western country. 40 million people is a huge potential market. It would have undermined Russia's position in the Black Sea, the Belarusian government and make Moldova more western. We would have had a new Poland.  Instead of that we ended up chained to a corpse that is also a blackhole for money. They were a decade behind Russia and other Eastern countries and now they are even further behind. They've become a millstone around our neck and we are forced to deal with their crap.  We're in a worse position politically now than we were in 2013.

UkrainianConflict,3e2x95,gibits3,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:45:07 2015 UTC,"It's not a problem for Russia it's wishful thinking to see Crimea as a problem. For 20 years the Russian bases in Crimea where at the whim of Ukrainian politics. The nationalist pro-Western political party decided a long time ago that their ultimate aim was to kick Russia out despite the base agreements.  Now they have full control of it along with an extra two million people, the vast majority of them loyal and happy. They don't have to spend a lot of money building a new naval base in Russian soil. Instead of duplicating what they already have they can spend it on developing Crimea. The Russian position in the Black Sea has strengthened and Ukraine has basically been hamstrung. They have no challengers in the Northern parts. They have no fear that some radical political party will abruptly kick them out. Nor do they fear Crimea the most advantageous spot in the Black sea ever becoming a NATO site.  The DPR and LPR are expensive but not as expensive as subsiding Ukraine. These two entities have already achieved what they were supposed to. The idea of Ukraine joining NATO is dead. The EU won't sign a trade deal with Ukraine that doesn't take into account how it will affect Russia. These two entities are pressure points on Ukraine that will make sure that it never becomes a Poland. A nation that is firmly on the American side and always ready to help. Ukraine as a potential threat has been neutralised.  Ukraine is buying Russian gas. They're just buying it from other countries. It's not possible to cut off Europe especially Ukraine from Russian gas. The long term solution to this lies in the court case that is going to come.  However Russia has already moved beyond that. Previously the Russian government was wary of the Chinese project to assert it's influence over Central Asia and Russia. The billions of infrastructure projects and business intrests that were set to tie Eastern Russia and Central Asia to China looked like something that would undermine them.  The Ukraine conflict has forced Russia to be more receptive to China. The Chinese have responded intelligently by not challenging Russian influence in the area. Instead Central Asia will be an area where Russian influence is pre-dominate but it will be backed by Chinese money. This will tie the Eurasian Union to Pakistan, China and maybe Iran. Russia's internal question of whether they are an European nation or a Eurasian nation has been answered. Russia will benefit from the billions that will flow while we are stuck with a Ukraine that can't decide how they want to fail."

They have eroded all the positive image and ""foreign policy reset"" they built up just a few years ago, trading it for illusions of imperial grandeur and pipe dreams of ""BRICS hegemony"". Meanwhile they're on the best way to be bought out by China who readily accept the desperately reduced prices Putin offers them ""out of friendship"".  Suggesting anything else is a joke, really. Living conditions for the average Russian have detoriated, he has no more access to Western goods, and the media landscape has become even more of propagandafest.  The only people buying ""Eurasisa-Silk-road"" are RT watchers and ""RUSSIA STRONK"" believers.

Something nobody, except for Russia (ironically), has to the Ukraine. Just look at how much money the west pumps into Poland and it's arguably a success story. But it's still far from a western development standard and still has a long way to go. Ukraine was and even more so is today in the middle ages compared to Poland. As the article states, they are overplaying their cards. The USA wants containment, the EU a political expansion with a united Europe as an end goal.

Since apparently that agreement wasn't worth the paper it was written on, maybe Ukraine should get the third largest arsenal of nukes back? Then US won't have to stick out your neck for Nayyem. Or, maybe, just maybe Obama can actually arm Ukraine. You know what? Forget nukes or lethal weapons, it would even be nice if Obama just called Russia's actions for what they are: an invasion. While I agree that agreements should be honored, it take some balls to say that Ukraine is in the mindset of breaking agreements when Ukraine lost 5%? 10%? 15%? of its land to Russia because Russia and the U.S. broke their word.

When they tried to violate the Crimean base treaty and tried to kick the Russians out. When they unilaterally tried to limit Russian ship movements despite the vehement disagreement Crimeans, Russians and Eastern Ukrainians. They also signed a loan agreement with the IMF and then proceeded to screw the IMF over.  It was Yanukovych who saw how important Crimea was and signed a new agreement. The very first thing the Ukrainian nationalists did was to violate an agreement they signed with Yanu and other EU leaders in less than 24 hours. This government was born violating an agreement.  So it's kind of rich to complain about Russia breaking the budapest agreement. The number one reason why nations and people refuse to break agreements is because one they make a habit out of it, no one will trust them. Trust is the most important factor when it comes to international relationships.  Do you think the USSR and the US signed arms limitation agreements if they didn't trust the other side to follow through with it?  Given the past history the Russians didn't trust the nationalists to stick to the base agreement and took Crimea. It was a smart move.

The Russian people wanted it back and the Crimeans wanted to join Russia. The Russians turned a blind eye to Ukraine suppressing them. All in the interest of national security. The Crimean bases is key to Russia's Black Sea and Southern defences. For Russia to be kicked out of it would have heavily weakened Russia's Black sea position. Ukraine joining NATO would have been fatal for Russia. It would have turned the black sea into a NATO lake.  Look at this map and imagine if Ukraine was also dark blue.

The main reason Crimea was given to Ukraine was because it couldn't be supplied easily from any where else except mainland Ukraine.   Historically, the same force/people/group that have held Crimea, have also held the strip of land north of it in mainland Ukraine except for brief periods of time. Crimea without water from mainland Ukraine can't be economically viable. Now with energy requirements as well, that is double true.  Build the Kerch bridge first, spend the estimated >$1 billion, and then talk about ""Crimea isn't a problem for Russia"". Because today, Russia spent 2x on Crimea as it spent on the second-biggest recipient of handouts, province of Dagestan."

The majority of voting power is held by western/pro-western countries. If Western countries want to play hardball as we did with Ukraine under Yanukovych, the IMF plays hardball. If we want to play soft as we are with Ukraine, the IMF gives bigger loans. The US congress is currently blocking any ability of other countries to change their voting share. The IMF is an essential tool of Western foreign policy and we won't give it up easily.   Which is why China is building its own bank AIIB and is supporting the BRICS bank.   So, they do trust Ukraine because of its potential.   You can't trust a nation because of it's potential. A potential is something that hasn't been achieved yet. Ukraine is one of those countries that have a potential but has consistently not achieved anything close to it because of it's own idiocy.

You on the other hand like to compartmentalize, divide blame, critize Kiev and defend seperatists and russians at every twist and turn in developments. It is indeed two different world views. And ironically, convenient excuses for seperatist/russian actions is your entire MO for debating this conflict. Me, I like to see the bigger lines in the sand. Is it a simplistic view? Yes. But nonetheless it is true. You see, a ukrainian soldier may inflict a death in this conflict, or a warcrime. And is guilty and responsible if the latter is true, and should be punished.

Ukraine has to deal with them sooner or later, there is no point in allowing cheap propaganda make that deal even mire difficult than it is going to be.  The blame for the conflict is predominantly Russia's. It has nothing to do with personal blame for individual crimes.  A Ukrainian soldier that kills a civilian is just as guilty in my eyes as a Russian or a rebel soldier who kills a civilian. The wider national guilt absolves them not at all.  By claiming that Ukrainian soldiers are free of blame no matter how many innocent civilians they kill you just absolve them of their sins in advance. You make it easier for them to commit war crimes.

The responsibility for starting the war is something else entirely.  When a Ukrainian soldier commits a war crime it is his personal responsibility. But even a wider, ""meta-responsibility"", if you want to use an internet term, is Ukrainian government's, for failing to instil enough discipline and prevent him from committing the war crime. An example being yesterday's shelling of Donetsk.  Again, the responsibility for starting the war is on a completely different level and in no way extends to individual cases, nor does it alleviate in any way individual crimes of that side which is not guilty or less guilty of starting the war.  Perhaps you are not saying that, but your statement ""There isnt a violent death in Donbass that is not on Moscows hands. Every last one. Morally, directly, indirectly or otherwise."" strongly implies that the Ukrainian responsibility for individual Ukrainian war crimes is somehow lessened by Moscow's overall responsibility for the war."
UkrainianConflict,3dyycn,Glideer,3,Tue Jul 21 02:37:30 2015 UTC,Agreed. A soldier who commits a crime needs to be court-martialed in order to maintain military order and discipline. However embarrassing and painful it may be politcally.   This is standard procedure with enough examples when British and American indivduals went rogue in Iraq and Afghanistan.  (Not sure we ever saw that in the Chechen wars to be honest)  Edit: just found a few examples on wiki Trials of Russian servicemen

UkrainianConflict,3dx356,Alikont,2,Mon Jul 20 10:49:43 2015 UTC,"OSCE can't fly UAVs because they would get shot down. Hitting a radar that records if you shoot at it is a different matter. Moreover, I talked about a couple of radars to cover Donetsk, the most important and contentious area when talking about ""who is shelling whom""."
UkrainianConflict,3dx356,eugene7,4,Mon Jul 20 12:02:32 2015 UTC,OSCE UAVs aren't being shut down - they are being blocked with special electronic equipment. Considering the fact Ukraine just got first more or less modern drones not so far time ago and rebels can't have such complex equipment it's obvious which country uses complex drone-blocking equipment.  Unlike drones if you set up radars people working with them will be in danger. As there will be no way to block the work of those radars - most likely they will be bombed to oblivion pretty quick from afar or from neutral territory.
UkrainianConflict,3dx356,eugene7,2,Mon Jul 20 12:52:00 2015 UTC,"I think that risking to kill OSCE observers and get caught would be too much for either party.

Why? If they can locate the position of radar (most likely it will be announced by OSCE) - it's not that hard to send a team or few with mortars. As a result Ukr. side will blame rebels and Russia, rebels will blame Ukr. soldiers or volunteers.  EDIT: my point is that any monitoring (UAFs or radars can be done safely only if both sides guarantee safety and interested in that monitoring). Currently it's clear that one side uses complex tech. equipment to make sure UAVs can't monitor the situation. Most likely even further actions will be done in case of radars deployment."

Because you don't need to place the radars in ""no man's land"", you could place one (let's say) 7km inside Ukrainian controlled territory, and one 7km inside rebel held territory. Now if you want to blame the other party you need to send a team inside their territory, you need the team to get close enough without being discovered, and you also need the team to be lucky enough to hit such a small target with only a few ranging shots, and then escape quickly. All this, knowing that if your team actually gets caught bombing this kind of target, there will be an international shitstorm."

This would make the use of artillery not only less favorable because the violator of the ceasefire would be immediately known, but it would also heighten the risk of precise counter fire. And along with that also prevent some random counter fire or retaliation strike.  But well, no, this wont happen as nice as it would be."

Population movements.  Continued war means Ukrainians move west and Russians move east.  Russia needs people.  Mariupol.  Donbass needs a port.  It's cheaper to take Mariupol than build/dredge anew.  Lengthen the border.  A longer border between Ukraine and Donbass is harder to patrol and defend.  If Russia wants more conflict they will do this.  Shorten the border.  A shorter border is easier to patrol and defend.  If Russia wants to freeze the conflict they should do this.  Kharkiv.  This would be a huge prize.  Unlikely, but huge.

Mariupol as actively shown that they wont bend to occupation. Further occupations will trigger more sanctions and losses to Russia, and further difficulties to Donbass.   Russia lost momentum long ago. Any further action now will be faced with counteractions to make sure that it wont  bring any benefit to Russia. So, Russia at this point will pretty much try to keep it as a frozen conflict with constant attacks here and there just to drain UA and prevent it from joining EU and NATO."
UkrainianConflict,3dug0h,1mistery,0,Mon Jul 20 01:32:06 2015 UTC,"Lengthening/shortening the boarder can be a double edged sword. A longer border for the Ukrainians also means a longer border for the pro-Russians and vice versa. I think Russia is well aware that an offensive towards Mariupol and/or Kharkiv would invite more sanctions and quite possibly lethal aid for the Ukrainians. I think the pro-Russians would encounter a credible resistance movement of they had to occupy Kharkiv and/or Mariupol. To end the conflict now, I think the Ukrainians should work to organize a resistance within Donestk and Luhansk. It's become increasingly clear that the local population is not happy with the occupying regime. To help this resistance, they should send ""humanitarian convoys"" just like Russia has in order to aid the pro-Ukrainian resistance. If they succeed, there would be no need for the concessions and special status for the region. Such autonomy can only invite later Russian intervention like what happened to Crimea."

UkrainianConflict,3dug0h,PerfectDD,2,Tue Jul 21 03:18:18 2015 UTC,"Not the only thing. When oil fell to $40s, Putin called some council and asked what measures can be enacted to counter sanctions/oil caused recession. People said - to cancel sanctions. Putin said sanctions are here to stay. So he got a quite a big document called ""liberalisation of economy"" on his table with set of measures projected to bring 2-3% of growth. But then oil rose slightly and regime decided it is fine as it is. But now with Iran and so on oil as source of income is gone for good.  Also I don't understand why are you so snide about checks. One of the main complaints about regime is a corruption that stiffles bussiness. Without checks government employers can't extort bribes from businesses. Three years is good amount of time for culture change."

If russia can't find any window of oppurtunity and the occupied territories end up isolated politically and physically from ukraine they will probably attack a strategic area with large amount of ukrainian troops,best case scenario for them a.debaltsevo or illovaisk situation by abusing the military's incompetance and the government's weak willed approach+what political control and intel operations they are running,all to force more 'peace talks'  to expand influence in ukraine,eg,causing ethnic and political divisions,getting their people in power,bribing officials to push their agenda,constitutional changes,etc.. Like breaking up greek nuts and gathering all the good stuff.   Id expect occasional combined arms assaults like we seen in mariinka to test the ukrainian army and find any weaknesses,hoping to involve the russian regulars as little as possible and we will see heavy arms buildups as russian proxies need to counter the slowly resurgant ukrainian military industry and army.  Russia can't go too quickly and can't stretch it out or else the military action will be too revealing and costly ukraine meanwhile needs to sort out severe corruption issues and build up thr army to prevent any debalysevo situations.

There is one reason that might keep him from risking any further adventures (he is a poker player, NOT a strategist). Given that the population of Donetsk and Luhansk is about three times that of Crimea and assuming that Moscow will have to spend approximately the same amount per capita in it that is now spending in the occupied peninsula, the Russian government will need to dispatch a half trillion rubles (15 billion US dollars) there every year well into the future.

They need to darken the colors and it'll actually be a really good camouflage pattern.   There are 2 versions: Zhaba Polyova (Field) & Zhaba Steppova (Steppe). I think what you have asked for already exists https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJcnGuHha_E"
UkrainianConflict,3duigo,PierogiPal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:27:20 2015 UTC,"Here's a photo of Sumpfmuster 44, it a very, very good camouflage pattern and in my opinion Varan is a clear upgrade of it.  I understand that there is a steppe and field version of Zhaba, but what I mean is not that they need to make the color palette suitable for the Oleshky Sands, but instead they need to make it better for usage around the rest of the year. There have been some photos of it working really well in the summer when everything is florescent green and the sun is high in the sky, but if it's cloudy out or if it's a bit darken then the uniform is practically useless with how bright it is. Here is a great example of what I mean."
UkrainianConflict,3duigo,eugene7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:01:34 2015 UTC,"They are part of the 79th? Are you sure? I would say that you're wrong based on the vehicles, but they seem to use a lot more mechanized vehicles than helicopters and planes. I guess that's because of all the unfortunate shoot-downs. Also, another airmobile brigade of Ukraine got T-80s recently from what I understand, so I guess that just throws everything out the window.  As for the Mazepynka hat, that's very interesting, but it appears all the pre-WWII caps had a round top and around WWII they appear to have adopted a more flat top. I'm not doubting you, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's a mix of the two. Do Mazepynkas have fold-down ear flaps? If they do, do the new Ukrainian ones have them? Those fold down ear flaps are an awesome feature and, in my opinion, it would be a mistake not to include them."
UkrainianConflict,3duigo,PierogiPal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:05:50 2015 UTC,"About 2 weeks ago 79th got T80 tanks. Last August they got artillery battalion.  Both Ukraine (and Russia) often use airborne units reinforced with tanks. However tanks are ""added"" from some mech. brigade. I've read that Russia plans that as well.  Actually I think there is a difference between air-mobile (79th, 80th) and airborne (25th, 81th brigades).    Do Mazepynkas have fold-down ear flaps? If they do, do the new Ukrainian ones have them? Those fold down ear flaps are an awesome feature and, in my opinion, it would be a mistake not to include them.   I think new ones don't have that. But yeah, that's a great feature.   I'm not doubting you, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's a mix of the two.   That guy I was referring to posted sketches and prototypes about a year ago on him facebook. There were different variations. I recommend to look that up if you are interested. That person is pretty passionate about what he does. It's always exciting to watch such people at work."
UkrainianConflict,3duigo,Khaiyan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:19:07 2015 UTC,"I knew about the artillery, but I thought that the T-80s went somewhere else. If they've got them though, that's fine.  Weird, in the US if tanks are called in from somewhere else they aren't integrated into the unit, they're usually just two units (such as, say, the 11th ACR and 101st working in conjunction) rather than the 101st having tanks.  Also, in the US, the difference between airmobile and airborne is that airmobile soldiers are helicopter jumpers (or, mostly just helicopter insertions, rarely do they jump from helicopters from a height higher than 10ft) and airborne soldiers do actual parajumps.  If they don't, that kinda sucks, but I guess it could easily be integrated into a winter version of the hat.  I guess I will have to look up that guy's sketches and variations and such, because that sounds really cool. Thanks for the tip."

UkrainianConflict,3duigo,cookedpotato,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:38:42 2015 UTC,"Not really, Wehrmacht soldiers weren't necessarily Nazis. I've discussed this before many times. Wehrmacht soldiers were just German soldiers fighting for the Fatherland. They don't necessarily like their government.  For example: Many poor Southerners in the Civil War didn't really care about slavery, but they cared about defending their homeland. Better yet, I've yet to meet a soldier who likes Obama, yet they all willingly serve him.  Finns also used the same field cap design, the Bundeswehr uses the same field cap to this day. Chinese soldiers used the same field cap in the Sino-Japanese war wand Chinese nationalists used it during the Chinese Civil War. East Germans wore it too. Hell, one could argue that America's Pile cap is based off of it as well. It was a hat popularized by the Wehrmacht and the SS, but that doesn't mean that it has to remain attached to the Nazi stigma. Similar items that have broken free include flecktarn and the popular undercut haircut."

Varan is definitely a good pattern for most of Europe, and any other woodland area really.

It's very rare to get a high quality shirt or pair of pants for less than 100 dollars, and you're looking more into the $150 range if you want the real good shit (Crye, Massif.) Lower brands like Condor are just trash that'll rip quickly and burn quickly, but Crye and all the top-tier manufacturers make their stuff out of rip-stop and coat it to be fire-resistant.  I'm more hesitant to buy this because the price they are asking for a company that I know nothing about. If it were Crye, I'd have no problem paying these prices for a their product, but I know nothing about their product or how good it is, so I'm hesitant."
UkrainianConflict,3duigo,PierogiPal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"I agree to an extent.  You can buy two Russian uniforms off of Russian sites for $100 USD.  Sometimes more depending on what you are buying / if they are having a sale.  Crye stuff isn't cheap either, but it's locally available.  I think I bought a set of the new multicam arid pants / hat for $100 Canadian, the matching top was $90 by itself.  If you wanted to go super cheap you can always order off of a site like royaltigergear.com.  Most pants / shirts are $30 USD / uniform.  Maybe when it Varan becomes more common it will be found for cheaper on online sites.  However I just can't stomach paying $100+ USD on a uniform at the moment."

Damn, where the hell can you get Crye stuff that cheap? Here in the United States it costs $150 for a shirt and $200 for the pants, which is a killer to my wallet.

The issue is not with what they report but how and/or when they report it. It can be easily made into a non-issue, or a 'local' issue instead of being at the core, by simple manipulative approach, which they employ all the time. For example: If you can recall, Right Sector had been at the frontline of the ""revolution"", fighting and killing police; kidnapping people, beating protestors that came out against; later on burned political parties' headquarters, etc.; - but whenever brought up as a major source of terror, was dismissed as ""Russian propaganda,"" saying there's only few of them; they don't matter; or they don't exist to begin with.  But now ever since their president Poroshenko is in power, and Right Sector kills someone at the West of the country, everyone points at them saying look what a bunch of ""terrorists"" they are (and yes, this is how objective we are). But when they were murdering cops at Maidan; protestors in South-East, actually pretty much provoking the separatist sentiment via threats and violence - they were ""Russian propaganda"", according to every Western MSM. Back then they were ""freedom fighters"", remember? The good guys, killing the bad ""corrupt"" police, - or not killing anyone at all, because the notion of death at the hands of the ""peaceful protestors"" was too a ""Russian propaganda"", right?   So what happened?  An appearance of objectivity and unbiased approach is all there is, and often not even that.  The points stand the same."

UkrainianConflict,3dud66,lepogore,0,Sun Jul 19 18:06:29 2015 UTC,"OSCE report 3rd February   Upon their arrival at 10:40hrs on 28 January the SMM observed that a large residential area in the Artemivskyi district of Luhansk city, 6.6km south-west of the SMM’s location, a rectangular area measuring approximately 1.5km by 1.3km, had been impacted by rockets. The centre of the affected area around Izvestkova Street (7.5km south-west of Luhansk city centre) was most impacted.  The SMM saw considerable damage caused by the impacts of rocket shelling, such as broken windows, fences, gates and walls. The SMM assessed that some of the damage to the buildings, e.g. a series of parallel rows of strike marks on a gate and wall, were consistent with damage typically caused by shrapnel elements from cluster munition.  The SMM measured by compass the angle between north and the axis of cargo remains. The SMM measured the incoming azimuth for the three cargo remains of the “Smerch” rockets, indicating a general incoming north-north-west direction.   http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/138906  OSCE report 12th February   On 12 February the SMM visited in Luhansk city a number of areas affected by shelling which occurred at 00:15hrs the same day. On Stara Mogila Street (approximately 6km south-east of the city centre), the SMM spoke to a de-mining team from the “ministry for emergency situations” of the “LPR” who said that they had removed from a children’s playground what they said was the body of a rocket fired by a Smerch MLRS. Based on the angle of the impact, which the SMM measured, the SMM estimated that the firing had originated from a north-westerly direction. On Oboronna Street the SMM observed the body of a rocket in the soil. Based on the diameter of the rocket and its marking, the SMM assessed it to be a Smerch and based on the angle of the impact, the SMM estimates that the firing originated from a north-westerly direction. At the Luhansk municipal bus company parking, located at Olega Koshevogo Street, the SMM observed the empty cluster cargo compartment of what it assessed to be the same type of rocket.   http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/140521  OSCE report 5th February    The SMM saw damage to the wall of Kindergarten number 381 located at Pintera Street 10 and at an apartment building nearby. The damage was consistent with shrapnel impacts caused by a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) strike.   The SMM visited the site of the shelling at Donetsk Hospital number 27 and noted the front of the building was badly damaged. The SMM examined four impact craters at the three sites (including two at the hospital), and assessed that they had all been caused by BM-26 Uragan MLRS, based on the size and nature of the craters, and that they had been fired from a south-south-western direction   http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/139391"

It would be stupid if they had done it, there is no reason to belive they have done it, opsec dictates you never tell and finally there is nothing to be gained for Ukraine in doing it. They want the people of Donbass to return to Ukraine afterall. The other side however has a vested interest in presenting the Kiev goverment as the enemy of Donbass, has been known to hit residential positions on their own turf and would gain if the sympathies of the world turned against Ukraine.   .  I think you will find that a little logic goes a long way when analyzing this situation. Unless you are prepared to belive that the ukrainian side are cartoon-character villains that will do bad because they are bad and must do bad...there really is no reason to belive that Ukraine massively shells Donetsk city. And the second and even more telling reason this obviously isnt the case, is the comparably small numbers of civillian casualties in this conflict. Ukraine has enormous amounts of artillery of types that are absolutely devastating if used to target a civillian city for just that. The casualty numbers would be tenfold what they are. At least. Reference Grozny, as targeted by russian artillery."

UkrainianConflict,3dud66,phenomenonoo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:54:18 2015 UTC,"You make some valid points, but it is disingenuous to claim that Ukraine doesn't indiscriminately shell Donetsk and Lugansk.  You have HRW reports proving that. There are three OSCE reports in this thread showing that Smerch cluster rockets were fired on Lugansk from north-west direction. The Smerch minimum range is 20km and that proves without doubt that they were fired by Ukraine.  OSCE reports one of those strikes to cover an area of 1.5km by 1.3km. In a city!  Therefore it is proven that Ukraine fired multiple rocket salvoes (even cluster warheads) at cities. That makes those attacks indiscriminate, for whatever reason they were made."

You have these two incidents where rebel positions close to residential areas have been targeted with Smerch cluster munition in February. Which is condamnable. And we can certainly talk about that.

A Guardian article reported Russia's threats as early as 22nd September 2013:   The Kremlin aide [Sergei Glazyev] added that the political and social cost of EU integration could also be high, and allowed for the possibility of separatist movements springing up in the Russian-speaking east and south of Ukraine. He suggested that if Ukraine signed the agreement, Russia would consider the bilateral treaty that delineates the countries' borders to be void.  ""We don't want to use any kind of blackmail. This is a question for the Ukrainian people,"" said Glazyev. ""But legally, signing this agreement about association with EU, the Ukrainian government violates the treaty on strategic partnership and friendship with Russia."" When this happened, he said, Russia could no longer guarantee Ukraine's status as a state and could possibly intervene if pro-Russian regions of the country appealed directly to Moscow.

Usually I will get copy-pasta links or some other deranged response to my posts. I believe that it is something that the putin-bots do not want out there and the fact the media hasn't latched onto those incredible words 'status as a state,' just goes to show how effective ignoring and not responding to something can be.

The Maidan, you mean? I wouldn't say that.  Russia virtually had Ukraine in its back pocket during Yanukovich's reign. Ukraine was little more than a vassal state of Russia. Taking over Eastern Ukraine would mean taking over depleted coal mines and the some of the highest AIDS, drug abuse and alcoholism rates in Europe. I once heard that it cost substantially less for Ukraine to import steel and coal than to entertain the workers and the nearly depleted coal mines – the government was running a deficit in many areas which had to be subsidized as far as the occupied territories were concerned.  Not to mention the fact that the ATO-zone territories used to be (and still are) pro-Russian strongholds. Putin has polarized Ukraine so heavily against Russia that, in more or less any part of Ukraine, saying that you support Russia in public could potentially lead to violence, whilst the majority of the population actually supported the pro-Russian candidate 5 years ago.  It's an extreme change: Ukraine will likely never democratically elect a pro-Russian candidate again. The country isn't in Russia's sphere of influence anymore and probably never will be again – and Putin would value having influence over Ukraine much more than being in de-facto possession of an island that barely sees any tourists anymore and and a strip with a future whose bleakness and future equal to that of Liberia.  The problem is that the only way he could try to achieve control over Ukraine is by annexing it, but seeing as NATO didn't even completely take over Iraq over the span of 10 years even though the country is made up of 70% desert and that Ukraine is substantially bigger than Iraq, annexing Ukraine would be a feat that would be impossible to accomplish from a logistic perspective.  In the end, Putin is a great at using tactics, but remarkably bad at creating long term strategies."

UkrainianConflict,3dsbd6,PerfectDD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:50:02 2015 UTC,"NATO never seeked to annex Iraq. NATO approached Iraq from the perspective that they were going to be accepted as liberators and everything would sort itself out. If NATO took over, appointed their own governors, judges, political party, and started to disappear dissenters and anyone who was not getting along with the program then it would have been more effective. However philosophical and moral self limitations prevented that from ever happening. I do not see that being an issue with Russia, as their pragmatism in previous conflicts has implemented such methodology and prevailed."

Once all the fuss dies down, and things go back to normal, Russia will still have Crimea, and a frozen conflict preventing Ukraine from joining NATO."
UkrainianConflict,3dsbd6,9A4172,3,Mon Jul 20 17:24:07 2015 UTC,"I think he played his cards wrong.  A ""good"" strategy would have been investing more money into propaganda and the expansion of the Russian Orthodox Church so that a pro-Russian majority could ferment and eventually come to power in 10-15 years, which isn't enough time for Ukraine to join Europe or NATO.  Also, there is MH17 – I don't think Putin actually thought it would come to a tribunal, but now it seems like it's something that will happen fairly soon. What will he do if the tribunal sees Russia as a guilty party? What will happen to ""A Ukrainian SU-25/A Ukrainian BUK shot the plane down"" and to ""We are not at all involved in the Donbass""? There is literally no way Russia can save it's face anymore as far as that incident is concerned. The only resort Putin's propaganda machine has is to make or regurgitate illogical statements such as ""It is clear that Ukraine is at fault, so a tribunal isn't needed"" which discredit him on the international stage."

Russia has enough chips on the table to prevent NATO member states from unanimously getting behind a Ukraine membership.  In regards to the EU, Russia has no right to dictate Ukraine's relationship with it. Ukraine is a sovereign nation and its people should have the ultimate say in the matter. Given recent polls indicating that the majority of Ukrainians wish to join the EU, Russia should respect Ukraine's decision. Also the EU, unlike NATO, poses no security threat to Russia, so it has no grounds for an illegal invasion of Ukraine."

Yes, Ukraine is suffering right now...but at what cost to Russia?"
UkrainianConflict,3dsbd6,Khaiyan,-4,Sun Jul 19 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"Well, they waited after the Orange Revolution, won the elections, only to see ""their"" president ousted in another revolution.

UkrainianConflict,3dsbd6,Glideer,4,Sun Jul 19 14:57:26 2015 UTC,"C'mon, you are not seriously suggesting that Maidan was instigated by the west, are you? I'm not naive to think that the west did not support Maidan, and perhaps they did encourage it, but the revolution was organised and carried out by ordinary Ukrainians. It had nothing to do with the West changing the rules - I doubt toppling Yanukovych was high on America's foreign policy list (what with everything going on in Iraq/Syria + the awfully restrained Barack Obama as President).  I think you need to accept that Maidan, like the Orange Revolution, occurred because of Russia's meddling in Ukraine. The solution to stopping this cycle would have been for Russia to step back from Ukraine, allow it to try and form closer bonds with the west, see it fail, and wait until Ukraine comes running back to its arms."
UkrainianConflict,3dsbd6,Khaiyan,-4,Sun Jul 19 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"C'mon, you are not seriously suggesting that Maidan was instigated by the west, are you?   No, but it was supported by the West. Or, more specifically, by the USA.   I think you need to accept that Maidan, like the Orange Revolution, occurred because of Russia's meddling in Ukraine.   It happened because the administration was corrupt. Had it been only about Russia's meddling you would have had only a few thousand RS guys protesting.  But the post-Orange revolution administration was also corrupt and still Russia waited patiently for elections to defeat them.  Obviously Moscow thought - you play by their rules, if you lose you lose, if you win you get your president toppled in a revolution. So you can't win. Well, let's play another game."
UkrainianConflict,3dsbd6,Glideer,6,Sun Jul 19 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"No, but it was supported by the West. Or, more specifically, by the USA.   Supported? In what way? Please share your sources of this US-backed coup.   It happened because the administration was corrupt   Yes, and many Ukrainians felt it was corrupt because of Russia. I don't think it is entirely justified, but you can't deny that the 'Russian way' of governance is more susceptible to corruption than the European model. One only needs to compare Poland and the Baltic states to Russia's satellite states to see the difference in corruption levels.   Obviously Moscow thought - you play by their rules, if you lose you lose,   Russia only lost because it forced Yanukovych - against the wishes of the Ukrainian people - to not sign the trade agreement with the EU, and join instead the Customs Union with Russia. Don't pretend as if Russia had no role in pushing Ukrainians further away from Russia and closer to the west.  What minimal role the US played in supporting Maidan (still waiting on those sources btw) is outweighed by Russia's own incessant interfering in Ukraine."

But that's almost certainly not what happened. Wars are full of costly fuckups, but as long people weren't trying to kill civilians, there is almost never any criminal punishment.   For example, remember Iran Air Flight 655?    Iran Air Flight 655 was an Iran Air civilian passenger flight from Tehran to Dubai. On 3 July 1988, the aircraft operating this route was shot down by the United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes. The incident took place in Iranian airspace, over Iran's territorial waters in the Persian Gulf, and on the flight's usual flight path. The aircraft, an Airbus A300 B2-203, was destroyed by SM-2MR surface-to-air missiles fired from Vincennes.  All 290 on board, including 66 children and 16 crew, died.  ...  Three years after the incident, Admiral William J. Crowe admitted on American television show Nightline that Vincennes was inside Iranian territorial waters when it launched the missiles.  ...  Despite the mistakes made in the downing of the plane, the men of the Vincennes were awarded Combat Action Ribbons for completion of their tours in a combat zone. Lustig, the air-warfare coordinator, received the Navy Commendation Medal.   In that incident the identities of everyone involved are fully known, but the result is that US and Iran settled for cash. Nobody was prosecuted, especially the lowly dude who pushed the button. It's just what happens in war, people die. These are stressful deadly situations where seconds count after all. Fucking up is not a crime. In this case, they even had a far more comprehensive platform to work with and still fucked up. But they did their best and nobody was trying to kill civilians or children.

We can try to improve procedures and improve oversight, but too much worrying about collateral damage directly impacts warfighting capability. In the end, war means killing people, and civilians always get their share of it.  So we call it the fog of war, and leave the good faith button pushers alone. It's the only thing that really makes sense in the whole absurd situation that happens when groups of people start killing each other over colored patches of fabric."

It's the American way, and probably one of the reasons why we're so great at killing people. Everyone we fight is a terrorist, everyone we shoot is a 'target', and whenever we fuck up it's collateral damage. But this approach has tangible benefits on the battlefield too, not just on the news page. Everyone who dies in war has a story, a family, friends, dreams, hopes, etc. We're all a universe onto itself.

In one you're an accessory to murder, and in the other you get charged with actual murder.  It can be legal (selling to a sovereign state), partial responsibility when providing arms to an internationally unrecognized rebel group, and full responsibility (troops under your command did it).   If Russian troops were responsible, you could expect 100% of the compensation to come from Russia. Compensation wise, things can get tricky if they weren't Russians. Most likely DNR would assume liability, but I don't know if Ukraine would end up footing the bill because DNR is technically autonomous from Ukraine.  The amount of money isn't really an issue. I wouldn't place compensation higher than a billion USD and it could be provided over time instead of a giant lump sum.   The more important decision is the guilt. If it was proven Russia supplied arms to Ukrainian rebels, this could affect relations with a number of countries and could lead to billions of dollars worth of claims against Russia.  If things progress, we may see Russia push DNR to assume liability and Russia will front the bill in exchange for increased Russian presence in the area (business contracts, resource contracts, etc).

UkrainianConflict,3drgzx,DamagedHells,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:31:48 2015 UTC,"https://mh17.correctiv.org/  good german report on the shooting. almost certainly russian troops, it takes a full squad with years of training to operate the system.   BUKs cannot tell the difference between a civilian and military plane - ukraine knew this as well, they accidentally shot down a russian passenger plane with one in 2000, killed all on board. so basically, ukraine chose not to set their airspace to a no fly zone, forcing russians to either be sitting ducks to air attacks, or to risk shooting down a passenger plane.   High above the conflict zone in June and early July, at an altitude above 10 000 meters, passenger jets continued to fly in the eastern Ukraine. In the week before the disaster hundreds of airplanes crossed the war zone, including Lufthansa flights.  After the Antonov was shot down, the Ukrainian air security authorities closed off the airspace just below 10 000 meters. Above that level civilian air traffic continued as before.  But even this altitude is a combat zone in modern air-tank warfare.  Besides the Su-25 planes, the Ukrainian air force also uses MiG-29 fighter jets that can reach an altitude of 18 000 meters. The jets then drop down to a lower combat altitude to attack enemy tanks and BUK units. A BUK team risks its life if it does not already attack an enemy plane at a high altitude during its approach.  Civil air traffic granted Ukrainian fighter pilots valuable seconds in their fight for survival against BUKs. Ukrainian fighter jets have the ability to hide just beneath passenger planes without the civilian passengers and crew even knowing of their presence. Anyone who targets a fighter jet from the ground risks shooting down a passenger aircraft.  A spokesman for the Ukrainian Security Council said Ukraine did not deploy combat aircraft on July 17th. The spokesman did not respond to questions about civilian flights."

The term is a misnomer, as IFF can only positively identify friendly targets, not hostile ones.[1][2][3][4] If an IFF interrogation receives no reply or an invalid reply, the object cannot be identified as friendly, but is not positively identified as foe."
UkrainianConflict,3drgzx,uiygygvulgy,4,Sun Jul 19 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"Well yeah. Do you really think airliners fly with their transponders off?   But, Soviet-era air defense systems as the Buk are equipped with IFF (Identify Friend or Foe) systems meaning that they are able to detect if the system is targeting a civilian plane through its transponder code. Therefore, provided the operators are trained enough, they’ll be able to distinguish between a Ukrainian transport plane and a large airliner. If not, they will simply shoot.   http://theaviationist.com/2014/07/20/inside-buk-telar-images/  There is also an additional ""non-cooperative"" mode.    Additionally a non-cooperative threat classification system was installed, relying on analysis of returned radar signals to purportedly identify and clearly distinguish civilian aircraft from potential military targets in the absence of IFF.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buk_missile_system  Problem is that both of these require the aquisition and command vehicles to be in the loop. The TELAR itself is very basic and isn't supposed to be responsible for this part of the mission, it's radar is only used for fire control."
UkrainianConflict,3drgzx,spankaway,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:25:12 2015 UTC,"no, that is wrong   The system cannot tell the difference between civilian and military-type aircraft based on their transponder signatures alone. In order to tell the difference between targets, it would need to be interfaced with other weapons systems that can work off of additional information.  Being a Soviet design, the user interface is fairly simple, says >Michael Pietrucha, a former F-4G and F-15E electronic warfare officer and expert on air defenses. Pietrucha says he trained with German forces operating a similar Russian-built system during the 1990s.  Pietrucha says that the Buk variant operated by the rebels might have been especially unable to distinguish between civilian and military air traffic because of a quirk related to aircraft transponders. The transponder is a device that broadcasts an aircraft’s identity when a radar ""interrogates"" it for information.  Military and civilian aircraft often use the same transponder modes and therefore that signal is not used as a ""discriminator"" for a military targeting system, Pietrucha says. The system has to be tied into the national air traffic control system to use that information effectively."
UkrainianConflict,3drgzx,uiygygvulgy,2,Sun Jul 19 16:30:05 2015 UTC,"That's from the BusinessInsider article - but other experts contradict that statement. Furthermore, Ukrainian military uses Mode 2 and civvy planes squawk in Mode 3. It might not be possible to precisely identify flight numbers, etc, but the Buk command vehicle would have been able to see it as a civilian plane even without the ""non-cooperative"" mode.  Anyway, here's another source:   This feature may have been a crucial factor in the destruction of MH17. The Fire Dome radar’s main job was to permit simultaneous engagement of more targets – one per Telar – under control of the battery’s 9S18M Snow Drift. But the Soviet military and the designers installed a set of backup modes that would permit the Telars to detect and attack targets autonomously, in the event the Snow Drift was shut down or destroyed by NATO’s rapidly improving anti-radar missiles.  The autonomous modes are intended for last-ditch use by the Telar operators, not the more highly trained crews in the battery command vehicle. According to an experienced analyst of Russian-developed radar, the automatic radar modes display targets within range. The operator can then command the system to lock up the target, illuminate and shoot.  Critically, these backup modes also bypass two safety features built into the 9S18M Snow Drift radar: a full-function identification friend-or-foe (IFF) system and non-cooperative target recognition (NCTR) modes. The IFF system uses a separate interrogator located above the main radar antenna and most likely will have been upgraded to current civilian standards.  The 9S18M introduced new NCTR processing technology, according to a 1998 interview with Buk designer Ardalion Rastov. NCTR techniques are closely held, but one of the most basic – jet engine modulation, or the analysis of beats and harmonics in the radar return that are caused by engine fan or compressor blades – should easily discriminate among a 777 with high-bypass turbofans, a turboprop transport or an Su-25 attack fighter.   http://aviationweek.com/defense/buk-missile-system-lethal-undiscriminating  We might have to agree to disagree on this one."

UkrainianConflict,3drlrf,RabbitShmel,4,Sat Jul 18 19:57:46 2015 UTC,"In the months prior to the disaster with the MH17 traffic increased not decreased. Until now, the image is that many airlines shunned eastern Ukraine because of the conflict between Ukraine and Russian separatists, the opposite is true.  Based on data from the website flightradar24.com NOS made an analysis. These flights over eastern Ukraine during the months of February to July last year.  Of each month eack week is analysed. It shows that in February and March a daily average of 103 aircraft flew over the area where flight MH17 was downed.  In April this number rose,  an average of 155 aircraft per day over the area around Lugansk and Donetsk. In May and June, it was about an average 144 flights daily in July about 137 aircraft per day.  The increase is partly due to the closure of the airspace over the Crimea on 3 April. Airline companies then had to choose a different route to the north or south of the Crimea. Many chose the north, across Ukrainian war zone.  According to the European air traffic controller Eurocontrol other factors also play a role in the increase of flights since April, as the weather, the transition from the winter to the summer season and airspace restrictions in other parts of the world such as the Middle East changed.  To fly through the airspace over eastern Ukraine no abnormal restrictions were enforced until July 1. From July 1 planes jad to fly at at least 8000 meters. This changed when a Ukrainian transport plane was shot down on 14 July. Then, flights were only permitted above 9700 meters. Flight MH17 flew at 10,000 meters.  After the accident on July 17, with flight MH17 Ukraine closed the airspace over the eastern part of the country. Include KLM flew over this area until then. However KLM seemed to avoid the route Donetsk after May 26 around the airport, fighting had broken out. KLM says the following: ""A flight plan depends on several factors, including route agreements with countries, security assessments and wind on the basis of such factors, each day planned a route which then also from day to day may vary.. ""  Whether or not an aircraft flying a particular route, the airline decides. Air carriers from the same country can in that manner create a different trade-off, as is apparent from the research.

UkrainianConflict,3drlrf,spankaway,13,Sat Jul 18 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"Crimea was shut down for entirely different reason.  There was no legal authority over Crimean airspace, Ukraine lost de-facto control, while Russia doesn't have de-jure control. The same happened for other breakaway and unrecognized territories, like Abkhazia or Northern Cyprus.  But commercial planes fly over warzones all the time. It's nothing new to restrict airspace up to 6000-10000 and is in common world practice. I flied over Syria and Iraq recently."

The latter arose out of desperation and necessity, whereas the former came about because locals stupidly thought that murderers, rapists and drug dealers from Russia would make Donbas better.  They reap what they sow."
UkrainianConflict,3dvm0j,Khaiyan,11,Mon Jul 20 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"So it was not desperation and necessity that caused Eastern Ukraine to invite their military presence to fight off a radical government imposing themselves on those that didn't elect them?   Actually you'll find that the thugs from Russia came before the Ukrainian government decided to ""impose themselves"" on Donbas.   It was more 'necessary' to invite a radical military presence (of murders, rapists, and drug dealers from Ukraine) to overthrow an elected government that had already agreed to early elections?   I think you're getting Donbas confused with Maidan. Maidan did not contain such people.   It was more 'necessary' to send these radicals to Eastern Ukraine to suppress any opposition to this government overthrow, as opposed to having diplomacy and talks like a civilized people?   You mean like how the Russian thugs and mercenaries ransacked public buildings, kicked out workers, took down Ukrainian flags, stood off against local authorities, and all in all created civil unrest? Yep, they sure demonstrated a civilised intent for diplomacy. /s   Man, I can now see how necessary it was to call on and rally behind Right Sector thugs, Neo-Nazis, radical/extreme Nationalists, and Oligarch funded militias, in order to keep the peace.

HOWEVER, I choose not to leave out the very important details like radicals overthrowing an elected government after highjacking a protest that already reached an agreement.

UkrainianConflict,3dvm0j,Glideer,4,Mon Jul 20 06:32:47 2015 UTC,Obviously she feels rebels are her only protection from people who are shelling her village.   What shes doesn't understand then yet is that if there are no rebels to shell in the village then the shelling will stop.
UkrainianConflict,3dvm0j,weks,3,Mon Jul 20 06:34:57 2015 UTC,Because people in those areas dont have equal access to information and expression.
UkrainianConflict,3dvm0j,lockd0wn,-4,Mon Jul 20 10:50:03 2015 UTC,"They have access to the local reality we don't have. I am not sure even about wider access to information, it is the internet age, after all."
UkrainianConflict,3dvm0j,Glideer,3,Mon Jul 20 00:35:51 2015 UTC,Being exposed to daily shelling can warp one's perspective and increases the likely hood of poor decision making. This is especally true when access to information is restricted and propoganda is used to distort reality.
UkrainianConflict,3dvm0j,lockd0wn,-2,Mon Jul 20 06:19:02 2015 UTC,"Well  you have a point there. Though I would say that being exposed to artillery shelling makes them aware of the reality in a way that we cannot begin to imagine.  Not that ""being present there"" is some magic wand that lets you see the truth. Remember all those people in Debaltseve claiming that they were shelled by Ukraine Army, when it was glaringly obvious that it was the rebels?"
UkrainianConflict,3dvm0j,Glideer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:18:31 2015 UTC,"That's an often heard but flawed argument. A person in the middle of something only knows one thing clearly better: how it is to experience the situation in the first person perspective. Most other knowledge is not depending on being in the middle of it at all.  Another example - a person with a brain damage has the exclusive knowledge how a brain damage feels like and how it is from the first person perspective. But the neuroscience scholar, who never had a brain damage, knows clearly more objective facts about those brain damages, how they occur and their mechanics than a brain damaged person itself.   A more philosophical and very prominent example (related to the concept of ""qualia"") is the one of redness - it shows the exclusiveness of spheres of knowledge even a bit better and also why that the knowledge of the second type can't really be communicated. The color blind neuroscientist knowing everything about color perception knows everything that could be learnt about color perception. But what she'll never know, and never can learn, is how it is to see red, and by that, even every communication with people who experience redness about it is flawed.   A bit like the neuroscientist - most of us can never really understand how it is to be shelled as a civilian - but like her, we can learn and know all other things about it, without ever experiencing it. And probably it is even easier for us, our perception is not disturbed having a fixed perspective from the within - we are more able to watch it with much broader and  variable perspective from the outside."
UkrainianConflict,3dvm0j,humanlikecorvus,-1,Mon Jul 20 09:54:25 2015 UTC,"As I said, ""being there"" is no magic wand that automatically lets you see the truth. Just witness citizens of Debaltseve who kept claiming they were being shelled by Ukraine while cowering in their cellars under a rebel barrage.  If you compare those citizens under artillery fire with geopolitical experts with access to confidential data then you are right.  But if you compare those same citizens in Donbass to us, with them witnessing the reality of the conflict firsthand, and both groups having access to internet sources, then I would say that they, on the average, have a better idea of what is happening."

The initial batch of BTR-4s the army received last summer were on hand because the Iraqis had rejected them.  They put a big (300+) order in for BTR-4s and then wound up canceling the deal and rejecting the last batch over quality complaints.

UkrainianConflict,3dqsad,Psy1,2,Sat Jul 18 18:32:00 2015 UTC,"Since the failure of the first World War, Russian doctrine has been wide operational fronts with deep penetrations.

(as does the UK, by extension) The Confederates who designed their battle flag chose to use the St. Andrew's cross to emphasize their British/Scottish ancestry.

However, I don't remember the Confederates ever enslaving a racial group. They just kept the status quo that was set at the time. I don't think it was right for them to do so, but the North was not any more just, considering that they had turned the Irish (my family) into wage slaves in the North and Chinese over in the West.  Neither of these comparisons are fair, not to my family who was enslaved in the North. It's not a fair comparison to Novorossiya to compare them to slave owners either, as they are not. Why is the man who made this comment not warned? Why is he allowed to get off scot-free for vilifying my people as well as the Novorossiyans?

UkrainianConflict,3dmcup,danmaz74,2,Fri Jul 17 20:20:05 2015 UTC,"He was a bit of a polarizing figure.    He was the architect of the controversial shock therapy reforms administered in Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which brought him both praise and harsh criticism. Many Russians held him responsible for the economic hardships that plagued the country in the 1990s that resulted in mass poverty and hyperinflation among other things, although liberals praised him as a man who did what had to be done to save the country from complete collapse.   I doubt Sakashvili knew him personally, but it could be a political statement of a sort.   As to her being good or not, I can't find much info either way. Her career mostly revolved around activism and her stint in the actual government seems to have been pretty short - but she was also a deputy-governor in Russia. Interesting that someone so anti-Putin could be appointed to that position in Russia but apparently it happened. She held the post for about a year and a half.   In February 2009 she became an advisor to the new governor of Kirov Oblast Nikita Belykh and on July 23 she was confirmed as a deputy governor in Kirov Oblast.[12] Gaidar had previously stated that Nikita Belykh had ""sold his soul to the devil"" when he accepted the post as governor from president Dmitry Medvedev.[13] In June 2011, Gaidar announced that she was to resign as advisor due to her admission to Harvard University for a Mid-Career Masters in Public Administration.[14]   I suspect this appointment has more to do with her anti-Putin stance than anything else.    She was actively involved in Russian presidential election, 2008 and manufactured numerous video materials where Vladimir Putin is painted as anti-Christ who leads the world to the nuclear Apocalypse.

This was before the war started iirc. They showed the journos this vid on a tablet and tried to explain how disturbed and scared they were that things like this were happening.

UkrainianConflict,3dmcup,spankaway,0,Fri Jul 17 14:22:07 2015 UTC,This vid caused tremendous amount of damage.   Not only that but the propaganda that was being spewed on Russian television ever since EuroMaidan happened telling all of western Ukraine was filled with Nazi's. For example this agitprop from March 2014.(before the capture of police stations in the Donbass.)   many nations have limitations on free speech that ban absurdly divisive shit like this.   And that's anti western. That is against the open market place of ideas. You have every right to believe and say in the most stupid shit and be ostracized for it. Banning ideas stifles debate on those ideas and creates an echo chamber.  Otherwise what makes western society different from totalitarian states that determine what you can and can not say? And if a government has the power to do that then what can stop a government denying the free speech of the persecuted and undesirables like Russia does to homosexuals?   Political correctness is no better than Soviet censorship. Banning anything leaves you at the whim of a mob that is blind to its ignorance or too insecure in its convictions. If you are offended then so what. The principle of free speech does not vanish where you feelings begin.

Even in America, where First-Amendment protections go further than most, you can chant ""Black people suck"", but you can't chant ""Let's kill Black people"". That falls under incitement, etc. Note that you'll never find ""God hates fags"" people holding any signs calling for any form of violence - they know the law.  And certainly, I remember that suspiciously well produced piece of agit-prop with the Daniel Craig lookalike. But it wouldn't have the bite it does had there been no angry right-wing chanting for it to springboard from (and use as the background noise to boot).  It's not about being offended - we don't ban yelling ""Fire!"" in a movie theater because people get offended.

A violent mob chanting a over 500 miles away should have no affect on your day to day living as the violence is far away. Ferguson and Baltimore had no affect on me in that respect. However I think if all I watched from the news was that all black people were going to kill me in the past 6 months; then I can understand how the people of the Donbass felt.   Does not justify their actions though. Feeling threatened is not the same as having a jackboot pounding overhead like in that agitprop. Through their actions their worst nightmare came to fruition. There was no Azov and heavily armed nationalists before they rebelled. Hell Ukraine did not even have a functioning army at the time. If they let those violent nationalists come to them then the world would have condemned Ukraine for attacking peaceful AntiMaidan protesters (as it did with Yanukovich and EuroMaidan) rather than supporting Ukraine for cracking down on a Russian led and backed rebellion."

One of the things the Crimean elite was always complaining of while part of Ukraine was politicians coming in and trying to take over things. And that did happen. But I can't say to what extent. I do know there was louder complaining when the Party of Regions/Donetsk elite tried to push around local Crimean politicians and businessman after Yanukovhc became president though. I suspect prior to the Party of Regions outsiders tried to get awaay with things, too. But since the peninusla always voted pro-Russian, they got more Party of Regions types than Fatherland (Tymoshenko) types anyhow.  And while I do not doubt that by and large the Slavic residents of Crimea are happy to be part of Russia (even if they are suffering from fewer tourists), I think it's funny that the elite who helped orchestrate this entire takeover by Russia now find themselves in the place of those Crimeans who thought ""Russian wages are bigger, yeah, we'll go with that!"" and must now face the fact that prices are higher for them individually anyhow.

UkrainianConflict,3dmeux,GirasoleDE,7,Fri Jul 17 13:26:40 2015 UTC,"Excerpt from tomorrow's issue of DER SPIEGEL:  On July 17, 2014 Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crashed over eastern Ukraine. All 298 passengers were killed. Now there is new evidence for the cause of the accident. According to information obtained by SPIEGEL, the international ""Joint investigative team"" that should researches the plane crash for legal purposes has come to the conclusion that MH17 was shot down by an anti-aircraft rocket of the type Buk-M1.  Investigations of the fragments in the wreckage of the Boeing 777 are said to have shown that they can be clearly identified as belonging to the warhead of Buk-M1. Pro-Russian fighters possessed several Buk-M1 launchers in this Ukrainian region.  Speculations uttered mostly by Russian media that a Ukrainian fighter could have downed MH17 shot, have been invalidated.  Furthermore the investigators see informations as corrobated according to which pro-Russian separatists fired the air defense missile. Phone recordings that the Ukrainian secret service SBU posted online immediately after the accident have now been checked. They are now rated as authentic by the investigators. ""We have a plane shot down,"" said a rebel commander for example in the recordings. In the sequel is heard, how the fighters discover that it was a civilian aircraft.   Whether the Buk-M1 launcher came from Russia crossing the border to Ukraine, is unclear. It could have been also a Buk-M1, which was captured by the separatists from the Ukrainian army. However, there are indications that rebels were trained by Russian personnel in dealing with the Buk-M1 system, obviously on Russian territory near the Ukrainian border."

American analysts were focused on an area near the small towns of Snizhne and Torez, about midway between the rebel strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk.  Their determination was based on an analysis of the launch plume and trajectory of the missile, as detected by an American military spy satellite. But the analysis did not pinpoint the origin of the missile launch or identify who launched it. “Those are the million-dollar questions,” said a senior Pentagon official who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss details of the analysis.  Although the separatists claimed to have captured a Ukrainian SA-11 battery in late June, a senior American official said the system was not believed to be operational. “We have high confidence that it was not a Ukrainian system,” the official said of the battery that shot down the Malaysian plane. “We have reason to suspect that it could be a Russian-supplied system.”   http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-plane-ukraine.html  The Americans knew it all along because they had seen everything from above.

Ukraine denied responsibility for years. The USA paid compensation after eight years.   Were actual people who pulled the trigger punished? Maybe.    In the Iranian shootdown case the USA awarded the officers involved, including the captain of the ship, with ribbons and medals for their tour of duty in the Gulf. This tour of duty included the shooting down of the Iranian airliner.  If that is punishment it must be diabolically disguised."

Yes, they tried to avert some blame but they didn't do like Russia. And yes, they accepted the responsibility, apologized and paid compensations to the families of the victims.   The fact that Russia is at all costs raising propaganda and spreading fabricated evidence and all kinds of bullshit and now speaking against a UN tribunal, I guess it speaks bazillions.   Russia denies any involvement because it knows it was not just an accident.  How much of an accident are the consequences of gross neglect of to whom you are giving heavy weapons??  How much of an accident is sending poorly trained mercenaries and soldiers to fight a war in a neighbor country, and give them heavy weapons capable of such tragic killing?  How much of an accident is a covert war that has killed thousands of innocent people beside the shooting down of a civilian airplane?"

We've seen it before in other instances of civilian aircraft shoot-downs by other nations. International tribunals or courts don't do shit.

Wiki: The United States government did not formally apologize to Iran.[14] In 1996, the United States and Iran reached a settlement at the International Court of Justice which included the statement ""...the United States recognized the aerial incident of 3 July 1988 as a terrible human tragedy and expressed deep regret over the loss of lives caused by the incident..."".[15] As part of the settlement, the United States did not admit legal liability but agreed to pay on an ex gratia basis US$61.8 million, amounting to $213,103.45 per passenger, in compensation to the families of the Iranian victims."

According to Wikipedia:   The U.S. government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives, but never apologized or acknowledged wrongdoing.[14] George H. W. Bush, the vice president of the United States at the time commented on the incident during a presidential campaign function (2 Aug 1988): ""I will never apologize for the United States — I don't care what the facts are... I'm not an apologize-for-America kind of guy.""[43][44]    Also:   Despite the mistakes made in the downing of the plane, the men of the Vincennes were awarded Combat Action Ribbons for completion of their tours in a combat zone. Lustig, the air-warfare coordinator, received the Navy Commendation Medal.[12] In 1990, The Washington Post listed Lustig's awards as one being for his entire tour from 1984 to 1988 and the other for his actions relating to the surface engagement with Iranian gunboats.[50] In 1990, Rogers was awarded the Legion of Merit ""for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service as commanding officer ... from April 1987 to May 1989."" The award was given for his service as the commanding officer of the Vincennes from April 1987 to May 1989.

The direct comparison is not possible because the investigation of MH17 is not finished and it is not really established who downed it.   In case of Tu-154 shot down by Ukraine in 2001, Ukraine paid compensation but some officials deny it was brought down by Ukrainian missile even now.   If it will be at some point firmly established that MH17 was shot down by Russian troops, operating according to orders of their military superiors, I would expect Russia to follow the fine example established by the country that  is making sure  that all other countries follow international laws."

Missile's electronics follows a certain pattern of target tracking. The missile technically can not make a kind of maneuver required to hit the aircraft from the angle it was hit.

UkrainianConflict,3djeva,alphanum,30,Sat Jul 18 21:58:30 2015 UTC,"I strongly suspect that this footage was deliberately leaked by the Russians to the Australians because the conversation contains disinformation already inserted by the Russians at the scene involving them ""shooting down"" a fighter jet which supposedly ""shot down"" MH17. Check the transcript: ""The Sukhoi brought down the plane and we brought down the Sukhoi.""  ...They make similar statements several times, to ensure the viewer of the tape registers.  One problem with this poison pill they tried to plant is of course that there is no Sukhoi wreckage they can point to.  Regardless, I predict that pro-Russian propaganda outlets will now, in short order, in the coming days, seize on this poison pill they deliberately inserted in the conversation they deliberately taped for propaganda purposes, and reinvigorate one of the many conflicting conspiracy theories the Russian propaganda machine has put out to fog and cloud international perception of this atrocity.  The work of the Russian propaganda machine is, frankly, astonishing. In my opinion, they are taking the outrage over this deeply inappropriate crime scene-meddling on the chin, just to be able to plant this propaganda poison pill contained in the transcript.  Absolutely amazing and infuriating. They commenced propaganda on the scene, immediately, and timed the leak for the anniversary of the disaster. (I want to reemphasize: this is not fact at all, but this is my conjecture at this point) I'm not entirely sure this won't backfire, though.  Edit:  Parts of the footage were leaked earlier, by the BBC, and they interviewed the filmer, ""Zhuk"":  https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/3dmnyw/parts_of_never_before_seen_footage_was_seen/  And, as I called it, the conspiracy gaggle are running with it:  https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/3dmnt0/mh17_new_video_and_missile_investigation_assert/"

Were the shadows indicating it was late in the day?), but I find it hard to believe that the Russians could have organized this rag-tag band of retards enough in the ensuing chaos to make a propaganda video.  To me this only confirms my theory that the Russians gave a bunch of disorganized clowns an incredibly powerful weapon and a plane full of civilians paid the price.  The only thing of any real value to the Russians in this video is that the rebels thought they were shooting down a Sukhoi...or was it an Anatov according to that Strelkov guy's post?  Regardless, this would make the Russians look incredibly bad that they would give militants this unprofessional a weapon like a BUK.  I mean these guys also claim they saw 5 parachutes- that would take at least three SU-25Bs being shot down."

UkrainianConflict,3djeva,theordinaryone,6,Fri Jul 17 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"Frankly, it's not really much of a big deal, as pretty much all available evidence points to the separatists shooting it down. At the time of the crash they tweeted that they'd downed a Ukrainian military plane, then deleted the tweet when it became apparent that it wasn't military. No other plane was downed. The SBU released telephone intercepts of rebels at the scene talking to their commanders, as they discovered it was a passenger jet - they were desperately looking for evidence that it was military, and asking why it was there (aka victim blaming). We see this video which essentially confirms that intercept, and a BUK sans one missile was filmed retreating towards Russian border shortly after the event. Combined with the constant story-shifting of the separatists/Russians (shot down by a Ukrainian fighter, a Ukrainian fighter was shadowing it for cover, it was a Ukrainian BUK, etc), the weight of evidence is substantial.   Now, as to why Ukraine had BUKs - the rebels did have a plane or two, but the main reason would be to prevent/limit Russia using air support. There have been many reports of airspace encroachments by the Russians, and not too long ago a drone was downed, and traced back to Russia, so there are valid reasons for Ukraine to have air defenses. As to where they went, they may still be there for all I know, but I'd probably have pulled them back too. If somebody gets stabbed and the perpetrator flees, I'm not going to stand around holding a knife, no matter how innocent I am."

UkrainianConflict,3djeva,Sierra117__,-55,Fri Jul 17 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"Despite all the hate that the separatists are getting for this you cannot say it is completely their fault. You have to remember that the war in eastern Ukraine is a full blown war. Plain and simple. The separatists could not just let a plane that could not be identified which was picked up by radar enter their airspace, because it could be an enemy plane seeking to kill them. The article says that other Ukrainian jets were seen in the area at that time, so it is not like the  rebels went out to try and kill the passenger plane but simply were trying to protect 'their' land."
UkrainianConflict,3djeva,coldandpain,23,Fri Jul 17 19:45:45 2015 UTC,"Your argument holds no water. The only types of aircraft of this size in use by Ukraine was a surveillance plane. This BUK standalone would not have had the ability to pinpoint plane type, but approximate size it could handle. So...there was no risk of this target to ""try to kill them"" if they didnt shoot. Relay intel to artillery, possibly at worst, but this target even if had been the Ukrainian AN surveillance plane was never going to bomb them or launch missiles at them. And they knew.   .   They knew ukrainian surveillance planes were operating and wanted to kill them. They didnt have the brains to wait for target co firmation and fired on the wrong target. Russian operated BUK. Russian soldiers with piss poor training and command fucked up and killed a civillian airliner. They celebrated the shootdown before realising their error. Instant damage control once error realised. BUK back to Russia and operators are dead and buried.   .  There is no further defence to be made for these actions. No explanations, no references or excuses. Top down communication has ALWAYS been an achilles heel in the russian army. Aside from the fact that Russia invaded Donbass, they did it with their usual knock for lack of finesse or skill. The Russian army is the most overhyped military in the world, since the Iraqi army pre-gulf war I. Looking at military comparison pages online always makes me giggle. Russia is ranked way up there..with the US. Dont make me laugh. Their equipment stocks are overinflated with gear that is ridiculous for a modern war, and their training regiment is outdated even pre-georgian war overhaul. The result rained down over Ukrainian fields."

Their equipment stocks are overinflated with gear that is ridiculous for a modern war, and their training regiment is outdated even pre-georgian war overhaul.

UkrainianConflict,3djeva,hughk,7,Thu Jul 16 22:01:37 2015 UTC,AN30s fly lower and slower like many planes used for this kind of spotting. They are also turboprops. These have a different radar signature to passenger jets.
UkrainianConflict,3djeva,Glideer,-7,Fri Jul 17 09:36:00 2015 UTC,Not on a BUK TELAR vehicle with a limited radar capability. Somebody mentioned before that a BUK TELAR crew would have about a minute to acquire and fire at a target in their detection range.
UkrainianConflict,3djeva,hughk,6,Thu Jul 16 22:10:33 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Whilst the BUK lacks a proper IFF capability, it can determine information about the plane from the radar return such as altitude and bearing as well as speed using doppler information. Turboprops give quite distinctive returns.  As the plane was engaged from the front (we know this because the proximity fuse will detonate next to the first large thing that it ""sees"", in this case the nose), it is clear that the button was pressed after seconds and not even a minute. I guess the people's lives weren't worth those extra seconds?  Edit: Changed the note on IFF because the TELAR 9S35 radar can interrogate a military IFF but not a civilian transponder as they operate on totally different frequencies (X vs. L band)."
UkrainianConflict,3djeva,Glideer,-2,Fri Jul 17 02:09:55 2015 UTC,Have you seen what the BUK TELAR radar screen looks like? Somebody posted a photo a few months ago. The info provided is extremely rudimentary and I recall that people with more knowledge than I have said that identifying the target would have been very difficult.  I wouldn't blame the operators but those who gave them a powerful system without all necessary components.
UkrainianConflict,3djeva,hughk,4,Fri Jul 17 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"Someone put up a couple of images comparing the TELAR displays of a turboprop with a jet, I can't find them at the moment but they really are quite distinctive (a fuzziness in the return caused by the prop movement). What it comes down to is threat vs. non-threat. The aircraft was flying too high/fast to be a threat.  The TELAR has an NCO on the crew but not an officer. The issue is that discrimination decisions are normally and by the officer in the command and control vehicle.   I wouldn't blame the operators but those who gave them a powerful system without all necessary components.   I would say that it is a bit of both."

UkrainianConflict,3djeva,saltybilgewater,9,Fri Jul 17 07:29:50 2015 UTC,"I think the thing that bothers most people is the sense that the conflict is manufactured through cross-border meddling. That extends to this situation in that no one is completely certain where the separatists got their Buk missile system and without such a system this flight would have been fine as the airspace hadn't been closed above a certain altitude.   In that sense the fault lies to a great deal with Russia, not just for their involvement in fomenting the rebellion but perhaps in supplying the missile systems/possibly poor training/possibly soldiers that made this tragedy possible. So when people have questions about the decision to shoot and when people wonder why the separatists couldn't identify a commercial jet versus a military jet a lot of the responsibility for the situation lies squarely on the shoulders of the Russians.  In that sense I think you misread the ""hate"". Definitely, most people who believe the Russians supplied and encouraged this situation aren't pointing the finger at the separatists."
UkrainianConflict,3djeva,coldandpain,10,Fri Jul 17 08:24:54 2015 UTC,"Dont kid yourself. The BUK wasnt seperatist. It will be said its seperatist because the russian operators are long dead and the BUK is melted to metal bars, and because its convenient to leave Russia an out.

On that very route flew more than a dozen civil airliners a day at the time, and probably never a Ukrainian military plane.

Who else, if it is doing the actual inviting?

The Ukraine has a mandatory military service from 18 y/o and it as well as Russia has BUKs in the arsenal from the USSR era, so it's likely that more than few members of the resistance know how to use it. Whether it was Sukhoi or BUK that shot down the Boeing is irrelevant in my opinion. At such high altitude there was no way for the separatists to know for a fact what kind of airplane it was. and what it carried on board. Considering the previous track record they have had every right to assume the worst.   After sending in a number of military aircrafts for the sole purpose of causing indiscriminate murdering and losing some of them as a result, who would expect the Ukraine to then send in a Malaysian Airplane carrying hundreds of random people just because they assume that the airspace is ""safe""?

So what more do you expect to be given to these non Allied, non member states bordering Russia?"
UkrainianConflict,3dik8t,Jeffgoldbum,14,Thu Jul 16 20:00:50 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say what should be done because they didn't act in the first place. Back when it was Crimea any nation could've stepped in and squashed it, but no one had the balls to do so. Then, when ""Novorossiya"" appeared out of nowhere, the obvious answer would be to send UN Peace Keepers, which is still a viable option if you ask me.  If Russia doesn't want to cooperate in the UN, then gimp their power in the UN. They want to hold back the tribunal? They no longer have a say in whether or not tribunals are enacted. They want to stop UN peace keeping missions? They no longer sit on the board that makes these major decisions. The OSCE is a joke, and while the UN is a joke, it's less of one. It's a foot in the door, unlike the OSCE, which is pretty much ""we want to be fed lies that match what we want to be happening but we don't want to take any responsibility for when the truth occasionally slips through.""   As for supplying weapons to Georgia, a lot of them were stolen back when Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. If it requires asking Ukraine for permission to permanently station a contingent of troops in Ukraine, then that's what it takes. Russia wants to expand bases in the Mediterranean (Cyprus) and other areas? The West can expand too, and whole lot closer than they ever could. Ukraine has an arms industry yes, but it's been quite a long time since a brand new tank rolled off the assembly line in Kharkiv, and Fort has made the choice (along with the Ukrainian Army) to adopt the wrong weapon for the job (transitioning from an AKM/AK74 over to a Tavor, no matter what the caliber is, is a bad decision and a fucking nightmare of retraining.) It's not like the United States doesn't have AKs to throw at Ukraine, hell, Eric Holder has been doing it to Cartels for years now, and the FBI/CIA/ATF have been doing it for even longer than that.  Equipment and uniforms, such as MTP, DPM, Flecktarn, and other such uniforms are not donations to my knowledge, they're just surplus bought by organizations and given to soldiers because they're cheap as fuck (Varusteleka has flecktarn field shirts for 1 fucking Euro.) Most camo and uniforms have come from Ukrainian companies (zhaba, varan, Ukrpixel) but it doesn't seem like they've been too good with producing and standardizing.  Calling Ukraine not an ally of the United States is a fucking joke and you should know that. Honestly, calling Ukraine anything but one of our better allies is a spit in their fucking face. They willing went into the Yugoslav war zone as peace keepers even though their military was nowhere NEAR ready to handle such a situation, but they did it in good faith for Europe. They WILLINGLY went into Iraq and were the 3rd largest contingent in the country behind the US and Britain in the opening months of the war, and stayed there to the very end. They WILLINGLY went into Afghanistan and fought alongside American soldiers, and, according to a few of my friends who served with them, were some of the best soldiers and nicest men he's ever met.  Ukraine is not our ally on paper, and that's it. A document is the only thing that stops Ukraine from officially being our allies, but they've done a whole shitload for America in terms of supporting us (and Europe) in conflicts when they could've said ""well, we're not allies so fuck off"", so to say that they're anything less than our ally is a complete disservice to what they've done.   EDIT: Hell, I even forgot about their deployments to Africa. These guys have absolutely no reason to be in Africa, yet they deployed in good faith in France's Northern Mali Conflict. They've also deployed to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Sudan and South Sudan, and Cote d'Ivoire. In the short time of their latest existence, Ukraine has done more to help out in the military and peace keeping missions of large nations such as France and America than most of the members of NATO or the EU."

It will only be a truly effective organization once virtually all countries in the world agree on the same values. It might prove to be very important in the future, but the UN really isn't now.  The big diplomatic problem was that Ukraine chose a direction to Russia before the revolution. This loosened political ties with the west, which is hard to simply tighten again during conflict. Putin knows what he's doing.  That's why Ukraine needs to be given a lot of arms and military support IMO. Ukraine's economy is extremely weak, but Russia isn't that strong any more either. With currently -40 million people on Ukraine's side and 150 million people on Russia's, Ukraine should be able to make it too costly for Russia.  Georgia is, with a tenth of the population of Ukraine, probably fucked."
UkrainianConflict,3dik8t,JanLul,0,Thu Jul 16 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"Ukraine should be able to make it too costly for Russia.   I think it should be clear by now that there are no plans to advance any further beyond the point of the current borders. Partly because of the potential cost, and partly because it's essentially pointless as the Ukraine is somewhat crumbling as a state. In the previous 18 months its GDP dropped by 40%, at this time they're not too far away from bankruptcy, the austerity measures they were forced to undertake by the IMF are hitting the population hard, with pensions at around 30$/month, average monthly income at 100$, unemployment at 10% while there are 40 million hungry mouths to be fed. The only ones that are going to have to pay a hefty price would be the western taxpayers to keep it afloat."
UkrainianConflict,3dik8t,zabor,2,Fri Jul 17 04:30:46 2015 UTC,Yes. It seems that Russia is trying to break Ukraine's economy and then pick up the pieces.
UkrainianConflict,3dik8t,JanLul,-4,Fri Jul 17 08:47:11 2015 UTC,"Actually Ukraine's economy is at a breaking point mainly not because of Russia but because the new government, which was openly anti-Russian, upon coming to power broke all the contracts with the RF regarding many joint manufacturing projects that made a significant part of their GDP; vandalized Russian banks; fired experts from leading positions just because of their sympathies towards Russia and replaced those with semi-inept ""patriotic"" supplement. Maidan caused the spread of armed gangs all across, removing LEA's in many parts of the country thus causing general destabilization and halt in production; the farming season was skipped, and so forth. Basically many different elements caused overall severely detrimental effect.   In addition it lost 2.5 million of its population among whom many highly skilled and prominent figures; Donetsk and Luhansk which together comprised about 15% of the country's GDP also caused damage and it probably was the only thing that Russia played a role in whereas the loss of Crimea didn't affect the economy in any way. Then there were, once again, IMF infusions along with austerity which didn't help either (the new government seems to love IMF).  Maidan and this ""patriotic"" euphoria is the main reason for what's happening within the country, not Putin or whoever else might be the usual scape goat around here. They spend their days either jumping and waving their national/EU flags while blaming Russians for all the consequences of their own terrible decision making; paint the streets in blue-yellow colors; write blogs and comment on social media; sing songs and occasionally, if unlucky, get drafted into the army and go to the East and die for the sake of not allowing ""colorado bugs"" to live however and befriend whoever they want via killing as many as they can, while waiting to be accepted in the EU (ikr) + receiving another IMF credit line. Meanwhile their oligarchs are busy re-privitizing somebody else's property or fighting each other. They aren't producing much, but just mainly digging their own hole, and it seems the deeper it gets, the happier and more determined they become to continue digging.   And again, there are ~40,000,000 of them, it takes resources to sustain such a population, let alone move anywhere forward."

Dramatically spiking prices and threatening of stopping the supply.

UkrainianConflict,3dik8t,spankaway,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"1) Crimea happened 2-3 weeks after the Maidan. However, RF wasn't the ignition, it simply responded to the public demand that existed for long before December 23rd, starting probably in mass from the mid of January, when clashes became brutal enough, you just haven't been told about it. What you've been shown is those happy faces waving EU flags and the evil Berkut beating those poor ""students"". Good stuff.   2) Gas export is not a weapon it's a product which RF is free to use as it is pleased. The new Kiev government came on the wave of anti-Rus Maidan, - whose main slogan was ""Stab all Russians"", ""Hang all commies,"" - and proceeded by running a clear anti-RF politics including against its own citizens, the people who sympathized with RF, meanwhile appointing Binderites as Ministers. If Kremlin continued to treat these new usurpers as before, it would've been an act of betrayal not only in terms of the Ukraine's domestic socio but also in Russia itself, as at the time everyone paid close attention to the events and knew exactly what kind of ""revolution of dignity"" it was.  3) Federalization was just a common sense, it still is actually. The first region to declare independence was Lvov, and its mayer has been supporting the idea of Federalization long before Maidan. Then there were protests throughout the South East demanding exactly that. And even today, all you hear on the Ukr media is talks about 'decentralization' which is essentially the same thing.   Get real   I'm as real as it gets, you're the one ignoring the actual reality.  edit: And I find it weird that you mention the use of gas as a leverage as if it was something bad, when that's what the west does all the time in regards to dozens of foreign states. That's your main tool, how are you in the position to complain about it anyways?"

The United States made a promise, along with Russia to not interfere with the sovereignty of Ukraine. Just because Russia breaks that promise doesn't mean that the United States should as well.  We also have to look at economic / military reasons to do or not do so either. I don't think the United States or Russia want to go to war with each other; many more people would suffer. The right thing to do here and the ethical thing to do in this situation are different, which is unfortunate.   Now for my unpopular opinion; I think the United States reacted appropriately strategically. Ethically, I think the Russian takeover of an area of Ukraine was undoubtedly out of line. You have to pick and choose your battles though, and this one was not worth fighting. If Russia is doing the same thing to Georgia then the United States should reevaluate potential military action in my opinion.

Winter and early spring went like this but Russians kept building up their army there and at 04.08 evacuated Tskhinvali population to Russia. At that point Russian-Ossetian separatist forces opened fire from high caliber mortars shelling Georgian poistions and injuring several Georgian soldiers.  Unfortunately this was last drop for president of Georgia that time and he ordered shelling of Ossetian separtist positions too, which was filmed by media and everything quickly escalated into war with Ossetian separatists.  Very quickly it became obvious that US trained Georgians were wining everything against Russian trained Ossetian separatists, and Russia was loosing another puppet regime, so Putin had to invade openly.

At a political rally in 1989 in the village of Eredvi, Gamsakhurdia described the Ossetian people as ""trash that has to be swept out through a tunnel"",[23] and in 1991 told foreign reporters that Georgia's Ossetians were unwanted ""guests"" who should ""go back"" to North Ossetia.[16] He claimed, ""in Georgia, there are Ossetians, but no Ossetia"".[24]  This policy resulted in the decision of the South Ossetian parliament in 1989 to declare its intent to unite with North Ossetia as part of the Russian Federation,[20] resulting in the revocation of South Ossetia's autonomy and the merger of the region by the Georgian authorities to Shida Kartli (literally ""Interior Georgia"").[20][25]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_for_Georgians#Effect_on_Ossetians"
UkrainianConflict,3dik8t,spankaway,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"Yep   The Soviet Georgian government created the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast in April 1922 under pressure from Kavburo (the Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party). Some argue that the autonomy was granted by the Bolsheviks to the Ossetians in return for their assistance in fighting against an independent Georgia, because this territory had never been a separate principality before.   and then   In the late 1980s, Ossetian nationalistic organization, Adamon Nikhas (Voice of the People) was created. On 10 November 1989, the South Ossetian Supreme Soviet asked the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic for the status of the region to be upgraded to that of autonomous republic. However this application was rejected on 16 November and the Georgians besieged Tskhinvali on 23 November 1989.   but there is more:   South Ossetia declared about its state sovereignty on 20 September 1990. In October 1990, the Georgian parliamentary elections were boycotted by South Ossetia, which held elections to its own parliament in December of the same year. On 11 December 1990, the Georgian Parliament passed a bill that effectively abolished South Ossetia's autonomous status. Russia intervened and a state of emergency was declared in South Ossetia.   and again:   On May 4, 1991, the South Ossetian Parliament declared its intention to separate from Georgia and to unite with the North Ossetia, which was located within the borders of the Russian Federation   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian%E2%80%93Ossetian_conflict"
UkrainianConflict,3dik8t,Sochi1918,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"Tbh this doesn't really contradict what I said, aside from the historical footnotes about the separate principality (which seems to be normal Soviet federalism anyhow). Ossessians migrated to the area over the previous couple of centuries and were culturally distinct enough for autonomy to make sense - especially in the wake of the Bolshevik/Menshevik struggles.    A series of Ossetian rebellions took place between 1918 and 1920 during which Ossetians attempted to establish Soviet rule under the Bolsheviks. Violence broke out in 1920 when Georgian Mensheviks sent National Guard and regular army units to the region to crush the uprisings. Ossetian sources claim that about 5,000 Ossetians were killed and more than 13,000 subsequently died from hunger and epidemics.[26]   Anyway, regardless of history, this recent trouble could have been avoided had people kept cooler heads and not let nationalism run away with stuff. From the EU fact-finding report on the war:   During the period of transition to post-Soviet sovereignty the country ́s first President, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, then did a lot in terms of nationalism to alienate the two smaller political-territorial entities of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from the Georgian independence project, proclaiming ethno-centrist slogans such as “Georgia for Georgians”. Nationalism and even chauvinism from all sides together with questionable political actions added to the tensions   '89 is where all of that shit started reaching fever-pitch. Perhaps ""Georgia for everyone"" would have worked a bit better."

UkrainianConflict,3dnam7,RabbitShmel,5,Fri Jul 17 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"I read this report from a german newspaper last fall that judged given that Russia had their armored forces in Ukraina their military doctrine mandates AA-batteries to be deployed too..   Yes, Russian military doctrine mandates AA deployment and they don't go anywhere without it.   But having a lone Buk TELAR goes completely against that doctrine, and that's not how they operate in theater. So RF military guidelines are an extremely poor guide to this situation.   The Buk is a mobile, radar-guided surface-to-air missile (SAM) missile system with all four main components — acquisition and targeting radars, a command element, missile launchers, and a logistics element — mounted on tracked vehicles. This allows the system to move with other military forces and relocate to make it a more difficult target to find than a fixed SAM system.   The acquisition radar component (several variants have differing capabilities) allows the system to identify, track and target selected targets. The command component is intended to discern ""friendly"" military aircraft from foes (IFF), prioritize multiple targets, and pass radar targeting information to the missile launchers. The missile launcher component can carry a variety of missiles (as listed below) and may be able to engage more than one target simultaneously. The logistics component carries additional (reload) missiles and provides other supplies and parts for the system and the operators.    Without the first two parts of the system, you are left with a missile launcher that can fire at stuff overhead within a very short envelope and cannot identify friendlies or civilians. It's a last-resort way of operating it in case other parts of the system have been knocked out. The reason that BUK launchers have their own (small and short range) firing radar at all is due to battlefield lessons.    The Buk missile system was designed to surpass the 2K12 Kub in all parameters, and its designers, including its chief designer Ardalion Rastov, visited Egypt in 1971 to see Kub in operation.[8] Both the Kub and Buk used self-propelled launchers developed by Ardalion Rastov. As a result of this visit, the developers came to the conclusion that each Buk transporter erector launcher (TEL) should have its own fire control radar, rather than being reliant on one central radar for the whole system as in Kub."

I believe it was claimed by the Russians and Georgians alike, the plane was shot down by a Georgian owned Buk launcher, that Georgia acquired from Ukraine. There were claims that since the transfer of the launcher was fairly recent (before the war), its crew must have been Ukrainian, as it takes a considerable amount of time to properly train a Buk crew.  The Russian claim was something to a degree of, that a Buk crew must graduate from a special Air Defense academy. Georgia doesn't have one, but Ukraine and Russia do, therefor Georgians didn't have the trained personnel to man their newly acquired Buk launchers.  tl;dr: in 2008 Russia claimed that Georgian Buk launchers of Ukrainian origin were staffed by Ukrainian officers.  It's amusing reading current articles, claiming that barely trained rebel crews were operating Buks in Donbass."

Higher quality pictures are needed to make a better ID on these guys (not that it will necessarily make it easier because of how the DNR outfits itself), but I find it somewhat unlikely that an obvious Russian military convoy would be used for security at a memorial event at such a high profile location and time, when there will be a lot of Western reporters around.

UkrainianConflict,3dhhgo,Glideer,3,Thu Jul 16 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"It is interesting to see that a mortar crater has exactly the opposite pattern to a low angle shell crater.  That would mean that a crater that shows a ""V"" pattern would point out in one direction of firing if it is a low angle shell crater. But in the 180 degrees opposite direction if it is a mortar crater. I am not sure you can tell the difference between the two types of craters from satellite photos.  That said, I think there is enough (old) evidence that artillery fire was being delivered from Russia. Some videos from last summer were particularly convincing."
UkrainianConflict,3dhhgo,Glideer,2,Thu Jul 16 20:46:36 2015 UTC,"The Bellingcat artillery report from February had a couple of examples of telling between the two types - the fourth and fifth image, about 10% down the page.  On the satellite images, it seems like the low-angle fire is shaped kind of like a V, while the mortar craters have a front, round crater slightly disconnected from a back, wider crater (if that makes sense). So mostly it's possible to see the difference, but yes, it's not possible 100% of the time.  But I've found that from looking at the satellite images in practice though, you can't get the trajectory 180 degrees wrong as you describe. This is because for both types of craters on the images, the artillery fire comes from the widest part of the crater towards the narrow end."

UkrainianConflict,3dj1dt,parakit,4,Fri Jul 17 13:38:01 2015 UTC,"I can rattle off a few reasons off the top of my head.   Russia's various offensives and seizures of land throughout the region has created a theater of conflict, of which Ukraine is a just a part.   Reporting on that theater of conflict is valid in and of itself - the Ukraine front is a greater part of Russia's  offensives throughout the region. No front is a political or military vacuum in and of itself.  As the article states, prior Russian tactics in Georgia are now being used in Ukraine. Nearly every move by Russian forces there have been used or might be used in Ukraine - so knowing about Georgia helps people better predict and understand Russian behavior.  For instance, Russian salami tactics this past week in Georgia might be used in Ukraine. After all, we now know Georgia was just a test run for Putin's seizure of Ukraine. For those reason, Russian or NATO tactical moves used there personally interest me.  Further, Georgia's attempt at NATO membership is completely relevant to Ukraine. The standards NATO is applying to Georgia may be applied to Ukraine. Ukrainians and Russians here would like to know about that.  Regional NATO training exercises in the conflict theater could be considered a threat to the Russian occupation of Ukraine.   Russian partisans would also probably like to know how NATO is training Georgian troops on one of their fronts, as that training will likely be applied to the soldiers arrayed against Russia's army in Ukraine.  I mean, I could go on and on. This is already too long. Would you like more?"

The order to fire is given by an experienced commander. There are many safety measures which prevents shotting down a civil aircraft. However at July 17 the TELAR was alone, and the crew was aware than as soon as the radar was switched on it could be detected by SU-25 aircraft. So they had little time to press the button.""

A trained crew could do a simple thing like an IFF check wich the kub teller system has.  8f it was a russian crew they could have easly interpeted the speed of the aircraft not to mention use radar data from s-300 battery near the border.  And on the su-25 what possible reason could the ukraine airforce have to run anti-aa missions as acording to them sepratist did not have high altitude aa systems. however i could see there being a russian commander in command of the overall system.  I still doubt that thoug.
UkrainianConflict,3dh2vf,Dutchbet,4,Thu Jul 16 10:54:54 2015 UTC,"Again. A trained crew could do a simple thing like an IFF check wich the kub teller system has.   Does it? I seem to remember hearing at some point that it didn't but now I'm finding conflicting information. This guy (look at the comments) says that at least -M1 has one, but it's unclear whether it can cooperate with civilian systems, and whether he's talking about the whole system or just the TELAR. Wikipedia says that the command component (that is, not the TELAR) has the IFF system. Aviation Week claims (almost) the same - that the IFF system is not in the TELAR but in the radar component.   So, any other sources?"

UkrainianConflict,3dh2vf,Dutchbet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, however:   On-board equipment of the TELAR in autonomous mode just give 2 signals: Enemy target (no answer on IFF) and aerodynamic target.   So, it's pretty much the same as 'this guy' (posting as Dmitry) I referenced earlier - even if there is an IFF, it's not compatible with the civilian systems, that is, it recognizes only Russian military planes as friendlies.  Edit: Out of these sources, I'd personally trust Aviation Week the most - however on a second reading he just says there is 'There is no sign of an IFF interrogator on the Buk Telar’s Fire Dome radar or elsewhere on the vehicle', so looks to me like he doesn't really know of the capabilities of the TELAR, but is working from pictures etc. So, not a great source, apologies."

But it does not make sense to hand such valuable stuff over to people who cannot make good use of it. Sure, this was one of the older types of Buks as well, and Ukraine had similar ones from Soviet times, but they are still way too expensive and complex to be handed over to untrained and undisciplined people."

He summarily executed men and wanted to blow up Donetsk to turn it into Stalingrad.  Zaharchenko is a much better leader. He has helped turn the rebels from a bunch of rag tag groups who couldn't coordinate to help each other fight off Ukraine into a semi-professional group. His put the cossack in line and brought normality to the DPR/LNR region.   Last year rebels were sitting around do nothing in Donetsk and Luhansk when Slavyansk and Mariupol were being lost. There was no planning involved. This year Zaharchenko managed to empty the useless Mariupol front of men to use them in the much more strategically useful Delbatsevo area. Right now DPR/LNR can actually function as a small state with good transportation in a defensible area. Ukraine has gained indefensible flatland that can be easily taken with an armoured thrust.

They make this public, release videos of their raids and use that to popularize their movement.   None of those illegal establishments work without corrupted police and bandits covering them. So almost always those kind of raids turn violent.  I don't blame Right Sector in this particular case (I'm not their fan) - there is a lack of police doing their job. And as a result we got so called ""street justice"". It may be Right Sector or other organization trying to remain hidden or even competitor who sales drugs as well.

I think the world has moved on from ""how many people can you kill"" as a measure of winning and gaining power.  Even then, it will also equate to a weaker military and Russia's inability to project power and maintain proxies among smaller neighbours.

For civil courts - in at least most of the victims countries by those victims, in Russia, in the US, at the ECHR, ... If a civil process is successful, and it was against Russia, they could demand to have Russian property in these countries, or in countries which have treaties with them seized if Russia doesn't voluntarily pay.  So, yeah - in  dozens. And I am sure I have forgotten some.  For a tribunal it would be probably international or universal law.

UkrainianConflict,3dd8ci,AHoopSnake,-2,Wed Jul 15 22:17:55 2015 UTC,"Do you mean to question the integrity and impartiality of the thousand year old British justice system? The one that gave us the Magna Carta?  If not, why would you oppose Russia drawing inspiration from it?"
UkrainianConflict,3dd8ci,akarlin,2,Thu Jul 16 00:54:06 2015 UTC,"Inspiration =/= Intent.  Also putting your favored country's system of governance on par with a medieval document in which central power sharing power with robber barons, is apropos"
UkrainianConflict,3dd8ci,AHoopSnake,0,Thu Jul 16 01:01:18 2015 UTC,"Uh, you link a story where the person was arrested for having materials, not for writing poems. The poems did not lead to her arrest. She was arrested for owning ""The Al-Qaeda Manual and The Mujahideen Poisons Handbook"".  Still a stupid arrest, but another whataboutism fail."
UkrainianConflict,3dd8ci,HardOfff,-15,Thu Jul 16 04:26:33 2015 UTC,"I am not really sure how he thought that was going to fly. He was in a paid public position that only wants their message portrayed. I think he was trying just trying to play the martyr, and if that is the case he succeeded. Unless you have a ton of backing in Russia right now against the system (which does not exist lol 90%) keep your mouth shut if you want to live/be free."
UkrainianConflict,3dd8ci,E1M1MID,13,Wed Jul 15 16:40:46 2015 UTC,keep your mouth shut if you want to live/be free.   Does not compute.
UkrainianConflict,3dd8ci,FratmanBootcake,4,Wed Jul 15 17:02:53 2015 UTC,Free as in physically free I assume.
UkrainianConflict,3dh4tm,kozak_,9,Thu Jul 16 05:56:51 2015 UTC,I'm sure that this will be completely 120% Einstein verified honest.
UkrainianConflict,3dh4tm,OdinSQL,5,Thu Jul 16 06:11:28 2015 UTC,"Putin is planning a ""snow storming"" of the Dutch report.  The release of this report will be timed to crowd the coverage of the Dutch report in the Russian media.  An attack from the Russian held areas is planned to crowd out the media coverage of the Dutch report in the civilized world."
UkrainianConflict,3dh4tm,speznazhunter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:05:31 2015 UTC,Thorough? What excuses they didn't invent yet? That it was a 'Buk' missile but it was launched from Ukrainian Su-25?
