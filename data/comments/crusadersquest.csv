crusadersquest,3e164t,Panterus,8,Tue Jul 21 04:02:23 2015 UTC,"I see 0% chance of them putting this in as it only exponentially increases the materials someone can get, unless they deliberately also lower the values. On top of that, how would the lower levels be balanced properly for the type of rewards given. Crystals are supposed to be the hard to get material and yet then allow them to be won on FoS1-4? I complete those stages with 4 and 5* heroes, that just completely undermines the end game value of those materials.  The only thing I can see them doing is adding an Iron dungeon, and I would love to see that simply because farming WBs just for weapons to break down gets kinda boring. I'd love a more interactive area like an FoS clone for it."
crusadersquest,3e164t,Whirlvvind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:34:09 2015 UTC,"FoS1-4 in Crystal dungeon can only give 1,1,2,2 crystals each. The 'difficulty' can be controlled by many factors, and limiting the quantity is one of them."
crusadersquest,3e164t,Chinoko,4,Tue Jul 21 04:37:00 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, despite initially liking the idea I don't think this is going to work, here's why: Firstly veteran players might mostly see this as a nerf since materials rate would be adjusted for new players as well, while new players might not care because of the riduced amount being unappealing (they'd still farm powder). Second, the current reset gem sink works better than a 4 dungeon split one, due to a lower number of stages required and less overall heroes required. Said this, I'm not against it, I'm a relatively new player myself but I think an Iron dungeon alone would be an overall better feature."

crusadersquest,3e164t,NaviHog,3,Tue Jul 21 15:47:21 2015 UTC,"TBH, right from the start I've already found a 100% craft reliant system for weapons to be faulty already. Not because its a silly system or whatever, but because of how humans behave.  We hate working for something, be it life or games.  We LIKE getting 6* drops we can't use, because of course it feels good.  What we DON'T like is to grind for a gear we want. We like to be surprised. We like to get something for nothing. That's why we keep falling for sales and promotions, because it feels like we're getting something for nothing.  FoS fails not by its design factor but the lack of understanding of the human factor. Not to mention that grinding on something can potentially come to naught.  Here's a little video explaining such a case: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxfkWZPAUg"

crusadersquest,3e164t,zenneth777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:53 2015 UTC,"I'd rather say give the forged *4 sbw have 1 fixed slot and 1 random slot (ie for Thor sbw 1 fixed def slot and 1 random slot), or make the slots much more rng friendlier (ie for Kriemhild's sbw the rng for atk is much higher than def and func, like 5-10 times higher), that for a bit resources hungrier (iron and powders/crystals but not gold please). More different type of fos means more of time-consuming gameplay and I don't really prefer the idea because even if you could forge more the rng to get the usable sbw would still be the same.    I'd rather spend 16k-24k iron (8k each forge) to get 1 usable *4 sbw rather than spend 32k-40k iron (4k each forge) to get 1 usable *4 sbw."
crusadersquest,3e164t,eX_CowArdLYdog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:37:44 2015 UTC,"Fixed slot might no be workable. Every players has different style of playing. Toast can't just decide what they want for us.   I would rather think they should have some rate up event for sbw. For example, ""thor sbw rate up for forging old hammer"" or ""huge increase of getting att slot while forging old weapon"""
crusadersquest,3e164t,zenneth777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:58:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, so there's alternative. But even so, Toast probably can. Because all normal weapons, including *6 have fixed slots. Different players might want the same certain sbw to be given different fixed slot, but some sbw should not divide players's opinions.    Ie, I don't think anyone would dislike Thor sbw with 1 fixed def slot, or Kriem's/Archon's/Lilith's with 1 fixed atk slot. If you happen to get Thor sbw with fixed def slot and random func slot, it would still be worth more for further forge rather than if you get Thor sbw with random double func slots. The point is you always get a more ""usable"" sbw, and it will still requires rng to get the ""perfect"" sbw for each individual (in term of 1 random slot, aside from whose-sbw rng). Also that for increased resources requirement (ie 4k iron increased to 5-8k iron).     Furthermore, if you need different slots for different cases, there are *5 and *6 normal weapons for alternatives, or another *6 sbw with different random slot than the first one you have. Ie, if one want to carry 2 heroes in 4-24, or do fos10 with Archon, he/she might want *6 sbw with Atk Func slot. But in pvc he/she might wants *6 Archon sbw with Atk Atk slot. One fixed Atk slot for Archon sbw wouldn't be a problem there. And it's not easy but if you happen to have 2 Archon sbw with different random slot (Atk, Func), then both problems solved (though changing weapons takes a bit of extra time). Or if you only have 1 with Atk Atk and still want to carry 2 heroes in 4-24 with Archon, you can still equip *5 normal staff for her. But that Archon sbw with Atk Atk slots shouldn't be that bad, rather than double Def slots in comparison, right. At the very least Archon sbw with fixed Atk slot and random Def slot should still be ""usable"" rather than double Def slots.     Imo, though."
crusadersquest,3e164t,MagicKing577,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:06:22 2015 UTC,See I would love this in game (iron and crystals I have a decent amount but nothing special) and also hate this in game it would drastically decrease the grind for FoS materials but if that is true PvC A.I that is broken yeh... Since the FoS event was the only time people were given a free pass on a 6* weapon and that worked out OK I would rather that then this because balence is necessary they are hard to get but worth it.

crusadersquest,3e164t,Fuzaki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:08:58 2015 UTC,"I like the idea in essence. One of the possible problems is that it will make it even harder for beginner/intermediate players though since I'm sure that the rewards will have to be scaled back to accommodate the fact that each of the materials are easier to get. Anyways, I'm all for more ways to get more iron."
crusadersquest,3e164t,Hugs2o6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:09:21 2015 UTC,"Great idea, initially, the issue with this idea is much like why Collosium was reduced from 10 to 5. I'd love to have the extra mats but it's simply be too time consuming. Also organizing teams would be a nightmare. I'm at a point where i have a massive storage of shards and crystal and no powder. It sucks to have to wait about 3 days just to forge a shitty weapon. Before that when i had a lucky streak all i did was farm iron but making 2 6* in a row is a shit ton of iron. This is why i think toast should modify some aspects of their forging/salvaging/rngs/Crystal redistribution not make us farm an additional 30 rounds and create an army to do so"
crusadersquest,3e164t,planistar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:23:17 2015 UTC,"I don't see the point in FoS if there's going to be a dungeon for the materials it provides, specially if they use the same mechanic.

This is about 1 try every 3 days (at no $). Even if they gave a ton of powder, what good would it do if one needs about 2 to 3 days to obtain 4000 iron?   Not to mention another 24000 iron to level up the weapon to 6* should u obtain the ideal weapon which requires about 12 days to accumulate."
crusadersquest,3e164t,NYClock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:05:03 2015 UTC,Yes I want this feature... but... I don't think its going to happen. I think its more plausible if they utilize a exchange place where you can exchange powder to shards and to crystals. The FoS should only be dropping powders with increasing quantities to FoS 10 and allow players to convert as needed.

crusadersquest,3e164t,Kurozet,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:45:47 2015 UTC,"Iron is important, but the way the crystals are designed right now is that in 10 resets(assuming you do all 10 floors)  you'll have enough materials to make six 4 star SBWs, three 5 star SBWs, and one 6 star SBW. Meaning if players aren't high end enough, then they must work harder instead of earning materials backwards from important to least.  I also proposed a dungeon that focuses on materials, specifically iron. And instead of using your own characters(besides 1), you instead use your friends (in turn giving you and them honor when main avatar is used). If you are going to approach material grinding an alternate way, I'd say your best bet is  F(friends)ofSouls."
crusadersquest,3e164t,Thearm05,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:19:09 2015 UTC,"Reason for this is since re-roll option is not going to be implemented anyway, at least allow players to farm powders and irons to forge 4* SBWs faster. Once they have their 4, if they like it they can farm shards. Maybe that hero is not their key hero, so the player would just farm shards and keep it at 5 SBW. For key heroes the player would continue to farm for crystals to 6*.  Isn't the flow and balance better?"

Some of the outlines are too thick and the strokes are kinda allover the place.    I'm sorry if I seemed brash. It's because you don't normally see colored pencils being used the way you referred to.  If you don't completely agree with my style, it's okay.

crusadersquest,3dvysm,yagaru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:17 2015 UTC,"The bosses don't actually do much damage unless you use blocks with the wrong chain length so you should be patient and not hit blocks as they pop up. Panicking is the worst thing you can do. Saving blocks and removing the ones in between the chains you want is the key.  Even after the boss gets powered up, if you can use the correct chain with multi-hit moves, the boss gets stunned and you can reset it (and it'll also take other sources of damage while stunned). If you can get a Sigruna, she's pretty good as a lead in there even if you only have one priest."
crusadersquest,3dvysm,undeadfire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"I do wait, but I usually keep getting all 3 different blocks in order 90% of the time. It's pretty crap RNG. I don't really understand the stun mechanic in these bread dungeons. Could you explain it a bit more? can't find much info on it"
crusadersquest,3dvysm,yagaru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:44:34 2015 UTC,"Using the correct chain deals a fixed amount of damage and then stuns the boss, which will make them vulnerable to other damage for that time. However, this stun doesn't last very long. When you use a skill block, the properties of that chain will carry through every hit, which is why multi-hit moves are the best to bring for the dungeon. You get more fixed damage and the stun lasts longer. Priests are there to let you skip blocks without angering the boss (and to use Energy of Goddess to make leader blocks if you have that). Otherwise, single-hit heroes are okay to skip with because they won't make the boss too angry or heal it too much, but you really want to skip as little as possible.  If you have Energy of Goddess for your priest, then making 2- or 3- chains for your leader becomes very easy. If not, I can see why you're having some trouble. You may want to look for a mage with Mana Recycle, instead. Even if they don't hit as many times, the reliability of getting the correct chain is more important.  I like Sigruna (+Bella) because she fires multiple feathers/arrows into the air and then makes feathers on herself that hit the boss afterward. There may be other heroes out there that are better, but I haven't experimented too much."
crusadersquest,3dvysm,undeadfire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:24 2015 UTC,"Thing is I'm fairly new to the game and grinding clerics has gotten me nada. Probs near 100 meat spent and no clerics. I don't have energy of the goddess.  Would random mage w/mana recycle+R0+4* nurspy be consistent in clearing B8/9? I only got leon, the already mentioned and the rest are 3* or below."
crusadersquest,3dvysm,yagaru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, of all of the priests Nurspy is probably the worst for breads because her skill does damage, too. R-0 can probably lead the group, but if you don't hit the right chain with her it's going to be a problem due to the number of arrows. Do you have any mages with the blizzard or meteor shower normal blocks? Using two of those with Mana Recycle might work better.  Keep grinding for another priest. You're going to need them for more gems, anyway."
crusadersquest,3dvysm,undeadfire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:15 2015 UTC,I don't have either of those for mages. Guess I'll level my mage and hope for the best. What should I look for as a 4* mage?
crusadersquest,3dvysm,yagaru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"Do you mean for bread or in general? Rachel or Sasquatch probably hit the most times so they'll probably be the most useful in bread dungeons. Sasquatch gets you Magic Storm, so he'll be good to have. Almost all of the wizards are good, though.  I used a 3* Chocolat because she was available around when I started (during an event) and her chain-1 counts as a chain-3 if it follows another ally's chain-3. It makes floor 9 very easy."
crusadersquest,3dvysm,Whirlvvind,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"The bread dungeon boss works in that each attack in the block use counts for triggering the 1k dmg and stun mechanism. When the boss is stunned he takes normal skill damage as well. This also applies to when the incorrect block is used for stacking the buff on the boss that increases his damage dealt.   So for a hero like Leon, you can use a 3 chain and he'll hit for 1k + whatever his normal thing is. If you mess up and use a 1/2 chain, again he will only hit once and only stack a single buff for the boss.   Thus you want to use a hero whose skill hits multiple times per block use, such as R-0 (R-0 is who I use), Archon, Lilith, Rachel, etc. A single 3 chain will yield something like 10+ hits each for 1k and triggering the stun for the arrow damage.  This applies to all blocks that do damage, which is why it is recommended to use 2 Priest heroes with your primary person so that you can just pop the heal blocks instantly to get the needed 3 chains. As mentioned, Nurspy is not useful here because her blocks do damage and thus count for stacking the enemy's buffs.  If you don't have more than one priest (or your only extra one is Nurspy) then you're honestly just best off picking a warrior or paladin 1* character and letting them die, so that way their block gerys out and doesn't get ""used"". If your only priest IS Nurspy, then you'll have to make due with 3* Priests."

crusadersquest,3dvysm,Talez_pls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! Maybe you can answer this one:   I have 4 level 5 heroes now (Leon, Yeo, Sas, Archon), however my weapons are pretty shitty (only one 4* weapon, rest is 3* ). Should I grind world bosses now for better weapons or should I use my meat to farm levels and try to get further in the story (I am 1-25 hard atm)? I have a feeling that my weak weapons are holding me back, but world bosses are pretty hard if I don't get lucky with a team full of 6* heroes who carry me :("
crusadersquest,3dvysm,SirQuortington,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:56:44 2015 UTC,"What team are you using? I'm going to assume something along the lines of Sasquatch/Yeowoodong(Leader)/Leon, right? Your team composition may be what's holding you back.   Since your only Priest is currently Yeowoodong and she needs the Leader position to be effective with healing, it'll be difficult or impossible to create a usable team with both her and Archon as they both need heavy block generation to maintain (except, of course, a team with Mundeok Lead). If you tried to make a team with Archon as Leader it would leave you without the much needed healing of Yeowoodong which means she is a poor choice for your team.  Sasquatch has some good utility through his attack reduction and stun but doesn't deal much damage (especially using 1-Chain attacks) and has a tendency to hit only the frontline.  Leon is a solid Hero that can carry most new players.  What I would recommend is promoting more Priests to get Mew. Mew works well with allied 3-Chain leads like Archon and is great with Energy of the Goddess which you've already unlocked from Five Star Yeowoodong. Yeowoodong is a fairly powerful Priest as well and I'm sure you will find her useful later on, but she has recently seen some nerfs and is more tailored to a team with primers/chasers (which you lack).  Once you get Mew, a team composition with Archon (Leader, Mana Recycle [preferably Transcended])/Mew (Energy of the Goddess)/ Leon will prove very effective. You'll have plenty of blocks for Archon and Mew's healing should be more than enough to keep everyone alive. If you manage to get Transcended Mana Recycle then you will stunlock enemies even better than Sasquatch!  The main reason I don't think you should pursue weapons so much right now is that your resources would probably be better spent upgrading your Heroes. At your level, you would definitely need to be carried through the harder World Boss stages and that can be time consuming with low pay-off (since you won't get MVP). Even then, most of the value from Weapons comes from their conversions and even if you had Six Star Weapons to convert, your level means you won't have unlocked the desired conversions and the resource cost may be too much.  Just equip whatever weapons you have currently. At this point in the game, Heroes are what's most important to your progress! Feel free to friend me in game as well, since that will allow you to use my Main Hero in PvE stages. My in game name is Quort and I play on Android. I hope this was helpful, but please feel free to get a second opinion! Also, in the future, go to the Mega Help thread! I and many other people will often look through and answer questions. :)"

Thank you very much, I'll make sure to befriend you and I'll try to get some priests by replaying certain stages!  €dit: Got Stein and Woopa Woompa from 2 priests (I had two on 3* level 30).

crusadersquest,3dvysm,SirQuortington,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:18:38 2015 UTC,"Stein is very powerful against multi-hit units but is otherwise lacking.  Woopa is extremely versatile due to the offensive and defensive buffs he provides, however, because of his unorthodox block combinations he is a little harder to use effectively. He's great with heroes that are reliant on buffs such as Hikari but there are better choices for general team compositions.  If you manage to land a Himiko or Nightingale from Contracts that would be awesome; the two of them are very valuable Priests! My favorite thing about Priests is that they are one of the most balanced classes because each Priest has a fairly unique role.  EDIT: I'm assuming that you're Cetaz in game, right?"

crusadersquest,3dq76a,IcyFenixCQ,6,Sat Jul 18 11:14:54 2015 UTC,"Hikari definitely shouldn't be the first in archers, thats just a Hikari hype thing.  If this also includes SBW's, leon should be the first in warriors then possibly monte being 3/4th (assuming this is overall) isabel should definitely be higher up, Susanoo is a terrible warrior outside of PvP.  Alex is pretty average as a paladin, Mundeok being so low is kinda odd...  Dart is better then sneak in everything but pvp  Mondrian has his uses but wouldn't be that high up, Naz being so highly dependent on 3 chain chasing and Yeow being fixed, probably makes him drop afew ranks, which makes sense why he is 5th, but Rachel being so low is abit odd her SBW upgrade makes her one of the fastest WB killers and she can clear most FoS Stages with perma stun from tMR  No real issues with priests...they are harder to rank, but Mew being first is definitely right, yeow dropping cause of bug fix is correct as well. Thou unsure of gale being second, she has little to no synergy with anyone."
crusadersquest,3dq76a,Floreau,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:29:29 2015 UTC,"As with most community tier lists, all decisions were likely made with Coliseum in mind. The overall results skewing for/against specific units can also be explained with few people having X premiums or Y SBW+correct skill.  It is a community tier list, with all the benefits and limitations that comes with such endeavors."
crusadersquest,3dq76a,jaetheho,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:40 2015 UTC,"Woot! Personally I think Isabel should be higher up, as well as dara. I think no  contracts in general took higher places since not many people own contract only heroes or have them to 6.  Edit: oh, and Arona as well. She's a boss in WB"
crusadersquest,3dq76a,Jolly-joe,4,Sat Jul 18 23:57:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to put this together  The design looks snazzy too

I remember how strong my Arona, Himiko, Isabel team was since you could spam 1-Chains and get all the 3-Chain activations/passives going (when Isabel was Five Stars). When I promoted Isabel to Six Stars it didn't work nearly as well because her passive activations no longer counted as 3-Chains and then they patched in on Four and Five Star Isabel. :C"

My Gripes: Joan should probably be under Roch and Isabel Demona should be considerably higher, but below 6* her passive chunks it.  Mandy and Dart are at least equal IMO, with Mandy's sheer viability winning out. I Personally think Teresa should be down with Crow.    I'm surprised Necro is at the bottom considering that he can easily solo 4-23 hard and 4-24 hard, much easier than Alice or Rachel can.  (With some easily applied buffs he can one-shot the 4-23 hard bosses.)"
crusadersquest,3dq76a,Spogebob,3,Sun Jul 19 02:59:28 2015 UTC,"I really don't like this whole ranking idea but if you must, i feel like it should at least be done in a grade system and unless you have the hero and have tried many team comps you shouldn't be ranking them. When i saw grade system i mean more than 1hero mint be top tier or bottom. The other thing with ranking is that there's many different reasons for using 1 hero over another. Ranking should also be based on if you're using the hero for PvC PvE or FoS. Like Gip, i use him on fos5 soloing many other heroes wouldn't be able to do that but at the same time id never use him past 5. This broad ranking system to me does not help the community out as much as I'd you made say 3 different ones.  With that said i do realize it is a lot of work you've put in and as an overall ranking i would agree. I also would like to add if you do decide to create a more specific ranking tier I'd gladly help"

Even though Dara's skill doesnt generate blocks either, her heal and 3 chain proc is impressive to say the least (even though it's hard to if procced in the first place) and can go well with people like sneak or hikari."

crusadersquest,3dq76a,DGNlogan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"I have him with his Atk/Atk SBW and even then he's not very impressive. He's a poor choice in PvP because he's so slow to his burst. He sucks in WB because his damage against single targets is poor and unsustainable. He's alright in PvE and FoS where his 3-Chains clear waves pretty easily, but he sucks against bosses and while you're waiting for his 3-Chains the enemies are beating your team into the ground.  Personally, i think Giparang's phoenixes and overall theme is pretty cool (I mean... HE SHOT DOWN THE MOON!), but he's extraordinarily weak. He could definitely use some buffs. Unfortunately there's not a lot that can be done to buff him without stripping him of his identity. :/"

crusadersquest,3dq76a,Pezmage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:01:17 2015 UTC,"Just a few issues, I'm just really not seeing how, if SBW were considered, Susanoo can be better than Monte or how Demona can be better than Hanzo. The sheer damage output of Monte overtakes even pre-nerf Nazrune, his wave clearing ability is top tier in PvE and can one shot 98% of high-DPS heroes in colo, making him incredibly dangerous to face. His start up can be a bit shaky, true, but once that 50% evasion is up it's hard to kill him, so a well placed Dionne or Anut can easily have him kicking butt.  Hanzo, similarly to Demona, offers a neutral damage output and does deal quite a bit of damage. However, Hanzo reduces armor and removes buffs as well, in addition to having higher hp and range for a tankier damage dealing hero."
crusadersquest,3dq76a,S1xEyes,2,Sat Jul 18 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"SBW was one of 7 questions to consider, not 100% of what to consider. Monte without Atk/Atk SBW is pretty much worthless...

crusadersquest,3dq76a,Jiang-Wei,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:32:39 2015 UTC,"Looking at the tierlist you can notice that although it's ranked in order the actual usability of the hero sharply drops after around rank 5-6.

My only issues with these lists (not just this one, but all of these ranking lists) is that they seem to exclude the importance of getting some heroes to 5* to unlock some skills.  So in this list, new players may never level up achilles, however it would be worth their while to get it to 5* for SOI.  Otherwise, great work."
crusadersquest,3dq76a,CanadaCub,-8,Sun Jul 19 13:47:13 2015 UTC,"First off you don't say whether this is based on PVP(colosseum) or PvE(quest,FoS,Dungeon, or WB).  I'm assuming it's PvP based on the list, but not everyone especially new players like you said would know that.  I'd also like to note if you're making a tier list for new players, a quest tier list would probably be alot more useful because let's be honest Colosseum isn't anything at all until you get all 6*'s."
crusadersquest,3dq76a,zachhalla,3,Sat Jul 18 11:47:49 2015 UTC,"Also, breathe brother... The answers are out there...."
crusadersquest,3dq76a,zachhalla,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:06:24 2015 UTC,"This is where the data came from. I'm also pretty sure this was a general community tier list, since Sigruna is laughably bad in PvC compared to R-O, Robin, Gon; no one uses Nightingale or Himiko, and Necron doesn't face range issues in PvC."
crusadersquest,3dq76a,Bantya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:53:32 2015 UTC,"Gon   Speaking of Gon, his SBW Tiga's fire breath seems to be piercing now, which is useful against mobs.   Anyone can confirm my findings? I tried his 6* on levels and damage points appeared on all enemies.   In practice mode, this is what I found for archers: Hanzo: SBW passive does 10-13k damage Robin: SBW critical shot does 9-10k damage Gon: SBW Tiga does 7-8k damage (of course added effect if SP gain)"
crusadersquest,3dq76a,Panterus,-6,Sun Jul 19 03:57:55 2015 UTC,"it's completely based on PVC.  Gon isn't worth mentioning for PvC what do you mean he's better than sigruna, you need 2 3-chains for him to do anything at all.

crusadersquest,3dq76a,zachhalla,-8,Sun Jul 19 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"""Every two times an allies use a chain-3 skill after the block is activated, an arrow which deals physical damage equal to 250% of the heros attack power is immediately fired.  When this effect is activated, the Leader and the Hero will recover 20 SP.""I've never used more than 4 maybe 5 blocks of my leader before a colloseum fight ended.  So why would banking on getting 6 blocks, 2 sets of 3 even, be considered reliable and good?"
crusadersquest,3dq76a,zachhalla,3,Sat Jul 18 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"This just tells me you've never used Gon. He fires an arrow each 3-chain, not after you've used BOTH 3-chains. He is primed and then is chased by 3-chains, unlike the other chasers, so you use his blocks first which is ideal if his block appears in between a string. Run with No. 9, Himiko, Arona, Mundeok, etc., and you are getting Robin's damage for less blocks with SP. Unlike other chasers who are completely worthless if their blocks appear in the middle of your 3-chain string, I'll just remind you agian, Gon is used first; his blocks are never wasted.  Secondly, His SBW is 700% of his damage 40% (I think even like 45%) of the time his passive would normally activate. This is a game ender for one block.  Sigruna needs her SBW to be valuable as a Main-Type over other heroes like Archon, Kriem, Mondrian, Mundeok, Maxi, Korin, or Vivian. Otherwise, she's better off in the sidelines waiting for her SBW to show up."

crusadersquest,3dtu4j,zachhalla,9,Sun Jul 19 12:05:41 2015 UTC,"Yeo as a chaser is the dumbest thing ever. She needs chain-3 to activate her passive, anyways she'd be useless.   You said you want restrain people from bringing useless units to 6☆, so prevent them from wasting bread and gold on Leon!! He is not worth it!"
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,xPinkiePie,2,Sun Jul 19 14:04:37 2015 UTC,"Leon's not bad at all, you can use him to tank pretty much any stage up to 4-24 hard and he has good DPS in monster waves, he has innate ArPen so he doesn't require any special weapon to be useful, and his block works as a gap-closer so he can effectively keep monsters away from your backline without falling behind even if you spam his skills.  Unless you get really lucky with contracts or upgrades you're going to need a tank in any composition, and Leon does a nice job, you can get one hero to 6star every week without too much effort, I don't think leon's the worst you can do."
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,sufijo,2,Sun Jul 19 16:06:59 2015 UTC,"You are completly right! With everything! And I never said he is the worst. But you are missing the point about him. Until he carried you to 4-24 hard or less because Alex and Archon for example are easy to obtain and so are many others more useful than Leon. It totally depends on your team and composition how long he'll survive in your team. Until this point Leon is totally useless for ever. So don't say to those newbies that    You'll want him your highest *'d character.    , because there will be so many people obtaining great units but trying to 6☆ Leon because someone said this in his guide."
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,xPinkiePie,-7,Sun Jul 19 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"This guide more less says the team you want that's free for end game is Maxi/Robin/Yeo. a 6* maxi 6* robin 5* yeo will get you into episode 5 hard with some ok weapons on them.  Sure Mew is better than yeo but not NEEDED.  sure joan, Thor, Vivian, Alexander, (insert many other paladins or warriors here) are better than Leon.  However I suggest getting Yeo and a good 3-chain user first.  they are your clear rate.  Then I suggest Maxi replacing Leon.  If you replace Leon why would you upgrade him more?  Should be common sense.  I suggest while he's currently in your formation he be kept the highest * unit because he does do damage aswell as tank the lines and in my opinion is slightly more important than the 3-chain chaser."
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,xPinkiePie,-5,Sun Jul 19 23:53:51 2015 UTC,if someone happens to pull archon or Maxi before Leon gets to 6* sure they should swap and not get Leon to 6.  However if that's not the case which very well may not be.  He is a fine starting 6* lead
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,Ontrevant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:13:38 2015 UTC,"The factor that he's the one Legendary unit everyone gets when start the game for the first time, make people think that he must enhance the experience and gameplay but he isn't even worth holding this Legendary status."

And then being extremely defensive and insulting those who point out the mistakes only destroys your credibility even more.  You sure seem to enjoy dishing out shit comments but cry foul if any come your way.
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,sufijo,2,Mon Jul 20 14:34:32 2015 UTC,"Yeo as a chaser? That's some awful advice right there... You do want EoG but mew is just basically the best chaser healer in the game, and yeo doesn't even work as a chaser, she needs a chain3 to trigger her passive...  Leon can also work as a non leader because his passive triggers every time he consumes 4 blocks (three when 6 star), but those 4 blocks (obviously) don't need to be on the same chain, so making him a leader only makes his DPS go up by 50% (since he's getting 50% more blocks, although realistically it goes up by more since you'll be prioritizing his 3chains) but doesn't actually give him any other special bonuses."
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,ilasfm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:45:43 2015 UTC,"Thats what I thought, since she only really works well with Mundeok.  Playing with Mundeok/Yeo/Naz for the longest time, the wording on Yeo's passive is really misleading.  I actually miss using my Mundeok....but Thor is mighty and will have to fill as a stand in until they implement the spatula for his SBW."
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,Serin101,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"Not really, Yeo + mew generates as much blocks as old Yeo did alone, except now you can only have 1 chaser. Also Yeo + 2 chasers is actually pretty usable, if you bring AOE wave clear heroes with her she can FoS relatively efficiently."
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,planistar,-18,Sun Jul 19 15:58:54 2015 UTC,look at Yeo again before spouting nonsense.  after an allie's chain-3 she has a 65% chance of giving the ally who used that chain-3 a block.  As for Leon yeah he can be a support.  However he sucks compared to other support passives.  Say Robin hood for example.  let's go with the example 24 blocks have been seen.  on average 12 will be leader 6 supports.  Depending on the block placement that's up to 2000% atk for Robin Hood.  Realistically I'd say around 1500% from having to remove his blocks to make 3 chains(assuming not hunter with WEstern gunner leading).  Leon on the other hand in 6 blocks does 380% and halfway to another 380% so I'll call it 570%.  about 1/3 the damage and the hitbox is rediculously smaller for Leon.
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,Archozalol,2,Sun Jul 19 13:56:41 2015 UTC,"You know, I vaguely remember you arguing about Gon with someone in the tier thread. You misunderstood her passive as well iirc. That I can understand getting wrong because she's not a normal chaser.   Yeo, though, is someone that a veteran (I assume you're a veteran) should know their way around. She is a 3 Chain healer. HER 3 chains has a chance to give blocks to her allies not the other way around. Her heals are extremely subpar if you don't 3 chain with it. An example teamcomp is Yeo (L) Nazrune Filler.   That said, the team you suggested could work for the lower level quests. And if they do somehow not get a good unit and needs to 6* Leon or something, Yeo would be a good lead since Leon just needs 3 blocks, chained or nonchained.   TLDR: You misinterpreted Yeo's passive and thus gave wrong info. She's a 3chain healer, not a chaser.  Team comp you suggested could still work for a beginner's team."
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,Archozalol,-8,Sun Jul 19 23:38:27 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to add I was orifinally gonna say get yeo for the skill but use Mew, however I read Yeo's passive and I'm not sure when but yeah she now gives the 3-chain user blocks 65% the time."
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,I_H8_Rogues,4,Sun Jul 19 13:58:42 2015 UTC,"nah mate, her 3-chain has a 65% chance to create blocks for the others. doesnt work on herself though"

crusadersquest,3dtu4j,LawfuI,8,Sun Jul 19 14:15:23 2015 UTC,"Or maybe if only you could know how one of the most well known and popular heroes in the game work...? I mean, you attempted to write a guide when you don't even know how the heroes you recommended actually even work? Honestly I'm baffled.  The translators are disgustingly awful but you're bad at understanding the skills too, the passive says ""when a chain-3 skill is activated..."" which is the wording they always use when they are talking about the hero himself, otherwise it would speak of ""An ally's chain-3""."
crusadersquest,3dtu4j,TearEUW,2,Sun Jul 19 14:30:35 2015 UTC,"She's labeled as a ""main"" type. That probably should have tipped you off that she is not a chaser, unlike chasers like Nazrune/Robin Hood/Thor/Stein/etc., who are all ""support"" types.  That, you should have noticed that her effect was pretty much never getting proc'd if you had used the teams you are advocating here. In any case, you should really change your recommendation, because it's a flat out poor use of Yeo.  Honestly, I did what most people here would probably be considered sacrilege and used up all of my starting crystals to reroll my first promotions to Archon/Mew/Joan/Yeo in that order. Archon/Yeo/Joan until Yeo hit 5*, then just played with Archon/Mew/Joan the rest of the way, burning any remaining crystals on meat refills. People might say that's a waste of crystals when you can save up for your first 10 contract pull and get something good, but considering it got me to Masters in my first full week of playing the game and was able to carry me through pretty much all content, I'm pretty okay with that."

crusadersquest,3dpqbj,jloppeno,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"Truly is a heck of an accomplishment  To those curious how this can be done. Napkin math.  1 ticket = 5 wins  1560 wins = 312 tickets  Starting on day 1 of a week you have three tickets.  If you farm Popo the maximum you can, you can get her 4 times per hour. Lets assume that the average payout from 4 meetings with Popo is 2 tickets. Because lord knows you aren't getting tickets every time.  Lets assume you get popo, every 15 minutes for 12 hours a day. 10AM to 10PM for example. With a payout of 2 tickets per hour on average, you will get 24 tickets per day.   At 24 tickets per day it would take exactly 13 days to farm enough tickets to get to 1560 wins. So yeah, roughly two weeks as people were saying. Of course this could be decreased ever so slightly by the free tickets obtained over the last month.  Let's move on to the logistics of actually WINNING 1560 matches. Lets assume 1 minute per match. (Just a rough guess based on personal time)  1560 minutes = 26 hours  26  hours  of  PVP  Which isn't as bad as it sounds, when you spread it over like 5 days. But still. Good lord.  My question, and really my only question is this:  What team was used for the majority of those matches? =D"
crusadersquest,3dpqbj,JyakiGun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:00:57 2015 UTC,I think to farming 24/7popo u can use a auto-click tool. And farm easy stages without paying attention. Just repeating the tool everytime afk.  To doing colo. U and a friend can share same account on different devices. For example i play 4h colo nonstop. Close cq and my friends logs in for the next 4h. And i think 1 click spammer teams are the fastest. Like sus sneak sneak. I use myself sus sneak sneak. Usaly with 5 blocks 95% of my enemies are death. Even with tanky enemied

crusadersquest,3dkdqb,mayainverse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:18:10 2015 UTC,so in wb how often can you keep SB effect up if the said hunter is not leader? also who gets the damage credit on on proc? or is it mostly just used for defensive reasons?
crusadersquest,3dkdqb,mayainverse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"With Yeo and tEoG, it can be kept up most of the time. It's used for both offensive and defensive purposes. All allies including the other player can proc it. Which is why the battle can end fast when you have multihitters in your team. I chose Sneak instead of D'art when paired with Yeo because of his SP generating passive, which, in turn, revs up Yeo's ability to generate more blocks and EoG.    Here's a preview of what they can do in FoS."
crusadersquest,3dkdqb,Quackimus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:58:49 2015 UTC,so then its basically does not help you at all to get mvp? it just helps kill the boss faster giving you less chance to die really?
crusadersquest,3dkdqb,Intellinet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:23:02 2015 UTC,"It helps you tremendously if you have high hit count units. If you have units like Mundeok or D'art, MVP is a piece of cake.

crusadersquest,3dkdqb,I_H8_Rogues,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:12:02 2015 UTC,I rarely see people use smoke bomb in WB4. People should use them more. inb4 nerf. lol
crusadersquest,3dkdqb,TomatoMarsh,3,Thu Jul 16 23:49:55 2015 UTC,"I think its more that 1. requires No. 9 to unlock the skill, a premium only hero, and 2. Smoke bomb only really excels in situations like WB. Most people tend to want to use multi hit hunters like Sneak/Viper and D'Art for primarily PvE/PvC scenarios and will more than likely go for skills like Overdrive and L&L. Which then means they will likely only ever have that skill if they either have multiple of the same heroes or have a solid enough PvC hero pool that they can have a dedicated Smoke Bomb hunter for WB/FoS scenarios."

crusadersquest,3dihz0,iEdGamer,4,Thu Jul 16 15:24:39 2015 UTC,I will report it. Thanks!
crusadersquest,3dihz0,NHNCinnaroll,2,Thu Jul 16 22:51:19 2015 UTC,Thank you for the attention!  Toast Team have responded to my e-mail as well. Do check on the no block generation bug. I'm not sure if it is replicable but these are the details to further help your exploration:      Mundeok/Mew/Hanzo tSoI/tEoG/tFire Rain Volcano/Ultimacute/Furinkazan        No Hanzo blocks generated after 2nd or 3rd revive.  Thank you once again for the support.
crusadersquest,3dihz0,Houlay,2,Thu Jul 16 23:39:29 2015 UTC,"I can confirm this double cost bug as well, but not excatly in the same situation that you were in. There are some extremely unfair bugs existing in the game at this moment that really needs toast's attention.  Whenever you are making a purchase in game, such as buying gold, upgrading weapon, or transferring a skill, if your connection is lost and the retry button shows up, you are going to do what you were trying to do TWICE after clicking the button. Thanks to this connection bug, I've bought too much gold, and wasted them on double weapon forge or skill transfer which I totally can't avoid unless I kill the game process and restart it every time should it happen (occurs quite frequently to me since I'm on the other side of the planet compared to where the NA servers are located as).  In addition to unwanted double purchase, this connection bug is frustrating if it happens in FoS. 99% of the time when the connection lost window shows up, you will get a ""No response from server"" next and thus losing all of your heroes attempts for that try. I don't see this happen in Colosseum ever. When you get the ""No response from server"" error when attempt to start a PvC match, you will be forced to reload into the game. However when you are back in you will continue just fine, not like you are gonna lose a match and become disqualified. So I see Toast is capable of fixing this, it's just that not enough attentions are brought to them.  Hopefully I'm not alone on this."
crusadersquest,3dihz0,Houlay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for voicing out your concern! Now that NHNCinnaroll is on Reddit, I hope she will take notice of these bugs as well.

crusadersquest,3dihz0,mayainverse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:04:53 2015 UTC,"I was curious on why there were no Hanzo blocks spawn and immediately realized it could be a major bug after not seeing a single Hanzo block after my 3rd revive. Bad RNG, maybe but it's not possible to not see a single Hanzo block after more than 2 minutes. And, I lost 20 gems :("
crusadersquest,3dihz0,Bantya,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:08:21 2015 UTC,"Should have read this... 2 minutes is impossible, you're exaggerating for sure.."
crusadersquest,3dihz0,mayainverse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:16:03 2015 UTC,"2 minutes in total before I quitted the floor. Every revive lasted about 40 seconds, 4 revives is about 160 seconds, that is more than 2 minutes. Don't blame it on possibility if you can't comprehend simple equations."
crusadersquest,3dihz0,mayainverse,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:22:28 2015 UTC,But math has proven that the blocks don't come out in a completely random order... I would love to see this replicated/ reported by ANYONE else... Right now I guess I have to remain sceptical until evidence is produced.
crusadersquest,3dihz0,mayainverse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:30:41 2015 UTC,"I am waiting for a confirmation on Toast too as I have given them necessary info/details for them to replicate this bug. If you meant Hodgekin's proof on block generation chance, yes I have read and understood the context. Like I said, impossible? Yes, on normal circumstances. But as a bug, anything can happen such as no blocks being generated."
crusadersquest,3dihz0,mayainverse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:34:22 2015 UTC,i dont know why you would revive even once. seems like such a rip off. by far the primary bottleneck is going to be dust and pretty much anyone can clear first 4 fos easily. spending gems on even 2 revives is only 1 gem away from fully resetting every floor and all heroes.  those 2 revives at most are going to help you clear 2 stages yet you can get a minimum of 4 stages of a more valuable resource for nearly the same cost.
crusadersquest,3dihz0,arichone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"But what about people who can barely clear 8 to get crystals, like me. I sometimes have to revive in 8, and it seems more important to get the one or two perfect weapons that I have to 6* than to get a bunch of perfect weapons that are all 5*"
crusadersquest,3dihz0,arichone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:20:02 2015 UTC,"Just ignore bitter users who always seem to have a better opinion on others' way of playing the same game.  Just for the record, I am using it on FOS 10. I usually will not revive more than twice but something felt wrong when no Hanzo blocks appeared even after 30 secs. The consequent revivals yielded absolutely ZERO Hanzo blocks. I gave up of course. No crystal, lost gems."
crusadersquest,3dihz0,arichone,0,Thu Jul 16 16:23:03 2015 UTC,so what you are saying is instead of clearing again fos 1-9 (also giving much needed dust) as well as i believe about the same or more crystals you needlessly spend 4 gems on fos 10? its not an opinion its a fact spending them on something else is more valuable
crusadersquest,3dihz0,Archozalol,2,Thu Jul 16 23:47:39 2015 UTC,"Put your facts elsewhere. If every user behaves like you, then there simply has no need to report bug since such option is not explored.  By the way, you may lack resource such as dust, but I have ample of them. I don't see why you keep emphasizing the need of dust. I have a good collection of 6* SBWs just for the record. Mindless or not, my gems, my choice. If you're unhappy about my choice/decision, go open a new reddit post and be bitter about it there. Not here."
crusadersquest,3dihz0,AShunXi,0,Thu Jul 16 23:51:25 2015 UTC,"i dont currently have fos 10 unlocked but from memory i believe the crystals go 8 > 10 > 15 i think in rewards. or something similar. using 4 gems on revives to ""maybe"" get 15 crystals because there still is a chance you will die again. vs spending 5 gems to get 120 dust some shards and 18 crystals. pretty sure a reset is a fact more valuable.  and dust is more valuable since its pretty rare to get a worthy rolled sbw. hell i have never even cleared fos 10 once and only recently started getting 9 and i am able to procure enough crystals to make a 6* faster than I am able to roll enough sbw for a roll that doesnt suck."
crusadersquest,3dihz0,jd2504,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"When you get further, your limiting resource will no longer be dust/shards. I can clear all FOS levels with no gems spent if I do not make any mistake on floor 10. This round, I deciced to spend my gems on revive instead of refresh because I don't have time to go through the whole FOS cycle again and I am almost ready to 6* another SBW. Calculation wise, refresh gives more resources/materials overall. However I have stated many times, I have my reasons and my discretion to opt for the revive. This post is about making known a disastrous bug to Toast. Not a FAQ on how should I spend my gems in FOS."
crusadersquest,3dihz0,bilboar,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:15:49 2015 UTC,i stated my opinion/fact in a online message board I don't understand why you are so butt hurt. if you didn't like what i said you could have ignored it. and it is a fact that doing a reset getting a minimum of 18 crystals + more is better than maybe getting 15. its a fact no matter how much you want to rationalize it in your head won't change anything.

I'am no expert, but from what i see, I think that you'll lack some healer for level 5+, you should promote some, because I find really hard to win lvl 5+ without a healer.  If you promote kriem to 6 with a weapon with Lifeleech/arpen, you can probably solo lvl 4 with some random people (or mew 4* to be safe.)

I really like you even explained how to play Hikari 'when to make 1 block or use 3-chains!' One comment i have to add. Your saying S.D.B is better in PVP. Because of the resistence is in average low enough that S.D.B can beat it. After reading your research i totally agree. And im excited to try it out. But gotta keep one thing in mind. knowing the bandwagon nowadays always uses Thor/Roland it might be better to stick to Answerer with bigger anti-resistance and bursts. till the bandwagon changes.

crusadersquest,3dh933,Panterus,3,Thu Jul 16 08:19:45 2015 UTC,i'm pretty sure waiting a bit after you cleared a stage is better than potentially not clearing a stage because the beasts cant be in the front line. And you can use the goddesses even if they are way behind.
crusadersquest,3dh933,Jolly-joe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:36:18 2015 UTC,I've stopped using Isabel in PvE for this reason. So annoying.
crusadersquest,3dh933,flie22,3,Thu Jul 16 14:32:58 2015 UTC,He is actually doing better in PVC now. I would have to agree his PVE is not that great because you have to wait for his pet.
crusadersquest,3dh933,Noctuaa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:01:40 2015 UTC,"yes, but going agianst teams that have high burst with bella, its hard for necron because you have to pull out your beast as soon as possible agianst those kind of bursters. So with a Chain-1 necron summon, the beast will have low health and will most likely die from a single spell. But if you get lucky with a chain-3 summon, then necron will do decent."
crusadersquest,3dh933,michaeltks,3,Thu Jul 16 07:10:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything in this post. Perhaps they should make it so 1-block teleport the beast to the frontiline and heals, two blocks tank damage, three blocks the stronk attack."
crusadersquest,3dh933,lamynona,2,Thu Jul 16 10:34:08 2015 UTC,Agree! I just got him yesterday and loving him aready. hes bad in quest :/
crusadersquest,3dh933,lamynona,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:35:44 2015 UTC,"""He's D tier right now"" and that top comment in hero forum is outdated already.  I have to disagree with making his 3 chain animation shorter because the way it is now is badass as hell. And do you know that it deal 1.5 time more damage than the first animation,Hit twice,and have half the screen range? If anything, it's balanced."
crusadersquest,3dh933,lamynona,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:37:38 2015 UTC,"yes they MAY be outdated, but for people who have just gotten Necron, and dont know anything about him will most likely look at the tier list/hero forum. And of course i know that the second animation deals more damage and that it covers half the screen, i'm a Necron main. But the beast can DIE before after the first animation if you are going against strong enemies."
crusadersquest,3dh933,lamynona,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:38 2015 UTC,Everything can died against strong enemy. Lilith without alex or Joan is not very practical. Every hero have their pros and cons. And this is Necron's.  Is what I think. he is not that badly in need of change. He is already balanced and fun.
crusadersquest,3dh933,lamynona,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:24:29 2015 UTC,"I can tell you dont use Necron all that often. Imagine your main damage dealer lets say Lilith does a chain-3 to deal bust damage to enemies, but the meteors have health bars. If the enemies KILL the meteors before they can even hit the enemy then i'm pretty sure people will get mad, same thing goes to necron.."
crusadersquest,3dh933,PenguinInATree,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:32:44 2015 UTC,"You can tell? Please elaborate more on that if you want to. I used him very often.In PvC and PvE. With Alex or Korin. Because I know that his weakness is the ghost can be killed and He is the only damage I need because he deal enough damage already.  But that's not the point in my argument. The point is still the same thing I already said. ""Pros and cons"".    If lilith's meteor can deal as much damge as Necron but can be killed I would say it's worth it."
crusadersquest,3dh933,lamynona,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"Most necron teams would consist of 2 priests with EOG  or 1 priest and 1 mage so the beast can be the front line, thats why i'm making this post. If you have a front liner like alex already then none of this should be a problem. Throughout the entire post i made it clear that the problems here are because of people who dont have a front liner besides necrons beasts.  Necrons chain-3 does not deal op damage like you say so. yes his chain-3 could deal more damage than others BUT if it dies before it can start its second animation, its the lowest damage for chain-3 mages.   Yes you say pro and cons but Necrons has WAY more Cons than Pros.  and you might not admit to that but others do."

Yea, I found that susanoo is pretty useless in coli right now. He either dies before reaching the enemy(against sneak etc) or get counters by maria/double dmg reduction front line etc."
crusadersquest,3danu5,DGNlogan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:25:45 2015 UTC,I use No9 Drake Sus  Works really well. Round ends in less than 10 seconds and is always finished by the 7th block or when Roland was released 10th block.

Enemy team had Alex and Magnus at level 47 +2 and Hanzo level 60 +2. I realized my No.9 got blown up 2 seconds after using a block following Maria and Drake. Here is what I think, Maria's debuff immunity buff procs Magnus' passive couple of times dealing 300% each tick, Drake's buff procs a tick, No.9's buff procs a tick. In a matter of 3-4 seconds, my team were blown up by an average Magnus. I don't know if this is intended, but it's definitely quite insane IMO."

crusadersquest,3dbtnr,Akaikos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:05:00 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention something, Maria used 4 blocks in total for 80sp, but only managed to heal 2.5k hp (on no ground Maria heals 2.5k with 4 blocks especially when No.9 can proc her passive). Which further proved while Maria's Sacred Treasure was on the field, Magnus would be doing 300% damage to my team every .5 seconds (his passive does not say a cooldown, so totally possible that every time enemy buffs, his passive ticks) while the healing was taking affect. On the other hand, I didn't see if my Drake's shield proc off or not that fight, but in theory, Drake/No.9 were most likely going to proc the shield with just the first 5 blocks. So did Magnus burned though the shield in 1 second?"

crusadersquest,3d96fi,Aeithus,2,Tue Jul 14 14:03:52 2015 UTC,His SBW should just turn all enemies into Vane for 5 seconds.
crusadersquest,3d96fi,Panterus,2,Wed Jul 15 01:36:18 2015 UTC,"I really want to like Vane, but his slow animations really kill it for me. He suffers from same issue I have with Dorothy and Cain. Unlike those two though, they at least provide some strong utility, whereas Vane is basically a squishy front line DPS.  The problem becomes, you want to keep him alive, but he lacks defense to stand up to much physical punishment. So to fix that you would need another strong front line like Roland, Alex or Joan to cover for him. Then, you also need a way to generate a lot of 3 chains, like Himiko.   With all that said and done, you could easily replace Vane for a less restrictive dps hero that would easily outperform him. You could easily make the argument that he pairs well with Mundeok, but then again, who doesn't?     I hold onto hope that they will fix him soon. Toast has done a good job of pulling heroes out of obscurity in the past."
crusadersquest,3d96fi,gentlegreengiant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:14:57 2015 UTC,Maybe he is the next Thor (in terms of getting from low-tier to up-tier)!
crusadersquest,3d96fi,RedFalchion,5,Tue Jul 14 14:52:55 2015 UTC,"""The Dark Knight Rises""? Too many Batman references, hahaha. I hope he gets improved, but not onto OP levels"
crusadersquest,3d96fi,Bantya,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:32:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe he'll change as much as mandy, and they could make a superhero team."
crusadersquest,3d96fi,Jolly-joe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"I like Vane's playstyle as a fore-runner and his attack provides a nice little series of knock-ups, so I hope these don't change, but he could use either more damage or more survivability.   I think survivability would make more sense and would play well with the special skill he unlocks, Avatar of Protection. It'd be cool to see a minor healing ability similar to Roland so we can detach some of the game's heavy reliance on priests because they're the only consistent source of healing."
crusadersquest,3d96fi,jaetheho,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:09:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, I like his unique attacks but I'm not sure about giving him the role of a pseudo-healer.

Now, I don't think Cain is in a terrible spot. He's really not bad, it's just that his niche of stunlock is already dominated by Kriemhild, but she does it better with her Legenary stats."

crusadersquest,3d9s99,flie22,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:45:32 2015 UTC,Don't do it!!!!
crusadersquest,3d9s99,urfriendjason,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:49:23 2015 UTC,"He doesn't do damage he reflects damage which means most of the time he isn't used in PVE. In PVC however, he is great versus huge damage dealing teams such as teams with sneak or no9 or lilith, and would often come out victorious as well. However the downside is, he gets countered by teams that have 2 or more healers or even teams with only 1 healer but a really good/maxed out one. And the other downside is he doesn't really synergize with any other heroes. Some might say what about rochfort and roland, remember that both of those heroes have to take damage in order to be effective, which is the same with abel, and most likely most of the time there is only 1 character that's taking the most damage, therefore he still doesn't synergize with rochfort and roland. Some people say one could use 3 abels in PVC, although I've never tried that but I imagine it would actually be effective versus high damage teams given the fact that in the current update when the team lead dies the team lead is given to the next surviving teammate which means that is the lead abel dies, most likely you are going to get blocks of the next surviving abel therefore keeping the reflect chain going without worrying too much about the lead dying and the other 2 abels won't get blocks to reflect damage in time."
crusadersquest,3d9s99,Taroncus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:49:49 2015 UTC,so he is pretty much useless in PVE? what skill would you recommend for him?
crusadersquest,3d9s99,Taroncus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:53:05 2015 UTC,"So far it seems he's not useful in PVE. For the skill I wouldn't say for sure, but heaven slash is always a good skill on any warrior."
crusadersquest,3d9s99,marrowak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:03:55 2015 UTC,He can do fairly well in pve Abel can lifesteal reflected damage. So he has the potential for his passive to heal him twice over while outputting some damage. The problem is you're using upgrade slots on lifesteal...  Cool hero nonetheless. Play what's fun.
crusadersquest,3d9s99,ProatCrastination,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:24:32 2015 UTC,OD for more damage plus the life steal or Windslash for survivability.

crusadersquest,3d9s99,Eradev,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:48:03 2015 UTC,"Actually he is good, but for starter it isn't good enough. You need focus first on levelling up which is PVE for most of your character rather than focusing in PVP."

crusadersquest,3d9318,anscott,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:48:11 2015 UTC,"On the topic of Dara, I actually pair her with Kaori in FoS. It's amazing how much extra survivability Dara gives to strong DPS heroes. She goes especially great with Dart.   Plus, her dance animation is adorable :D"

crusadersquest,3d9318,anscott,2,Tue Jul 14 14:09:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't know why everyone likes to pair Yeo with Mundeok, especially when the 3rd hero will likely be a squishy wizard, as bad block gen will deliver a hard wipe.  Whereas Dara keeps Mundeok rolling like a train...the only problem I've seen arises in FoS where Mundeok gets hung up by executing so many chain-3s that he's not advancing far enough."
crusadersquest,3d9318,anscott,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:53:21 2015 UTC,"Kaori is one of those that I've always wanted to promote...but I'm holding off until I get a preferable SBW, I've heard great things about her.  I've heard D'art and Dara pair well together, but when it comes to FoS I'd much rather prefer Woompa or D'art pumping out chain 3's than Dara, since the latter isn't as reliable for keeping most tanks up and going."
crusadersquest,3d9318,S1xEyes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:47:28 2015 UTC,"My Magnus isn't a 6* yet but I tried (Mundeok)/Magnus/No.9. No.9 is good because of her natural burst power and the fact that after Mundeok you'll do a double 3-Chain.  If you do the block order:  Magnus block -> 3-Chain Mundeok -> No.9 Block  This effectively creates 2 trees and snipes 3 times twice per No.9 block, for a total of 4 trees and 12 snipes from 2 No.9 blocks. (Best for PvC)"

Magnus is so OP man, if you use him with a shadow mage leader he summons a tree for every seeded enemy, for every chain3 casted, including shadow mages', so if you get a lilith and make 2 or 3 mages you can easily deal 1000% AOE damage instantly."

crusadersquest,3d7ota,Fuzaki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:11:53 2015 UTC,Is Lilith that rare? I got it on my premium contract a week ago when I just started playing.   Can anyone tell me why she's that good? I feel like im doing better with Korin than Lilith   http://i.imgur.com/dipEa0W.jpg
crusadersquest,3d7ota,mad_hatter3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:22:38 2015 UTC,"As an avid Lilith user, I can say that she is amazing. Idk about rare since I've seen her quite a lot; most likely because she's been around for a long time. You have to get her to 6* to see her really shine. Korin is also good but is not as flexible in terms of composition and solo ability."
crusadersquest,3d7ota,sircusa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:32:39 2015 UTC,Does Lilith excel in PvP? Because I'm leveling Korin because I heard her shield can help me get through hard mode stages (the only reason why I'm getting Korin to 6 star first)
crusadersquest,3d7ota,kwwk87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:37:57 2015 UTC,"One of the best mages in PvP. She does need Alex and/or Joan to tank though. In lots of ways, she's the mage version of Sneak. With a life steal weapon, I've been able to solo most of hard mode Volcano with her. She's as good as Archon but Archon has better survivability.   Korin is also good but she sort of needs certain team compositions to truly excel. The great thing about Lilith is that she can be used as either a chaser or leader since her passive procs from one block and an ally's 3-chain. I can't be sure, but I believe it even stacks, whereas you can get 2 3-chain blocks if you activate both. It doesn't really matter which one you 6* first but I personally would go with Lilith as she can help you better in powerleveling your characters since, as I said before, she can solo much more efficiently."
crusadersquest,3d7ota,Kumdori,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:03:13 2015 UTC,She unlocks shadow mage. That's more than enough reason to want her. Plus she's pretty strong and can be used in FoS. But really that skill is the most important part of her and it kinda sucks that such a good skill is on a premium.
crusadersquest,3d7ota,Panterus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:13:10 2015 UTC,Well she can only be good at 6* since her 5* passive takes too long to build up SP. People harp on about Lilith because she probably has the highest attack stat out of everyone and is able to pull off a Magic Storm in literally 3 blocks.  Her ability to generate SP quickly and her high attack power is what makes her good. Just make sure you're only using 1 blocks with her.

crusadersquest,3d6mz4,ilasfm,2,Mon Jul 13 22:56:31 2015 UTC,I would prefer if they allowed us to customize the first 5 blocks we get before entering a battle. Would remove bad block RNG even if it's a little.

crusadersquest,3d5ek6,AlxStgt,11,Mon Jul 13 17:40:57 2015 UTC,Hero trading would definitely break the game...new players would have triple sneaks by the second day if not implemented with restrictions
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,Intellinet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:20:33 2015 UTC,But what if it wasn't for free? What if we had to trade characters based on the highest bidder. Then Sneak would probably be sold at like 1 million gold (about 200 gems)
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,Czekraft,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:09:27 2015 UTC,"That would be good... For the people who save up 1 million gold at least, I use my gold on the spot since I'm impatient..."
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,Intellinet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:08:56 2015 UTC,"I doubt so. there are enough replica sneaks on the market right now that the price will not be so high. Furthermore, the ones needing sneaks will not have the money and the ones with money wont need the sneak.  Supply and demand will push the price high but not as high as you expect simply because the demand lacks the money."
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,snowypowers,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed, trading would straight up break the game. I've seen this in Defender of Texel/Diablo2/3, it was madness. Getting heroes is not hard, I started from the bottom, but I had pro tips from my friends who got me into the game which honestly really helped my progression(rolled a free hikari when I started, I didn't even know what a premium hero was, friends said she was good and the game was easy from that point on, threw in a healer now and then, Hikari OP). Honestly, I like having to train up all your heroes to 6, and I think it's very fun to track the increase in dps/heal/effectiveness of my hero through the damage/heal charts to really see how well my hero scales with levels and weapon conversions. But what I don't like about leveling is grinding 4-16H dragon all day or 4-24H all day to get to 6, the mission itself is boring, I think we need more diversity in how we level our heroes. Can I get an amen to that?"
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,andrevvc,2,Tue Jul 14 22:26:07 2015 UTC,"Amen, Some other games let you combine heroes to level one of them up, or combine them to get a higher star hero"
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,Intellinet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"I discussed this a few months ago and yes, it would break the game, definitely. The game lives from collecting on your own and farming, wating, raging to finally get the hero you wanted so bad. I have 25 6 stars so far, rolled endless premium contracts but still haven't had luck with neither Himiko, Mundeok nor Lilith. The moment I get one of them via a simple trade will never be as rewarding as the moment I get one out of my own sweat ;)"
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,adjent_elefant,3,Mon Jul 13 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"SBW reroll wouldn't ""break"" the game but it would certainly have more...long-term negative effects...that I personally feel outweigh the immediate positive effects...obviously this is one of those situations where what we are talking about is highly desired so most people won't look at the other side of the coin (and I'll probably get downvoted for expressing unpopular opinion...)  I hate to say it but I don't see it happening. It's a losing battle either way: Change it and lose end-game player base sooner because they can far more easily collect ""perfect"" SBW : OR : Don't change it and potentially lose people to frustration after they've spent months trying to roll one weapon specifically with one particular set of conversions and wind up with all garbage and realize they've dumped days upon weeks of their lives into the game for one purpose and are getting nowhere."
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,Intellinet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:38:19 2015 UTC,wind up with all garbage and realize they've dumped days upon weeks of their lives into the game for one purpose and are getting nowhere   I have to agree with you on that
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,Czekraft,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:16:30 2015 UTC,We were nowhere when we started. Only way is up.
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,Pezmage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:13:48 2015 UTC,I'm aware of the other side of the coin. This is why I compared rerolling the outcoming SBW with the option when promoting 3 to 4 star heroes. This got implemented for the same reason and worked out pretty good. Rerolling a slot could be to much. More possibilities or higher chances to get at least a 4star SBW would probably also make the job. Increasing the rewards from early FoS stages was the first good step in that direction but for me it seems like it can't be the end of the road.  The forging system still feels really unrewarding atm.  I (and definitelly many others) have forged at least over 30 SBW. Endless dupes and only 2 have actually acceptable slots.  So for me the frustration-reward-balance is heavily frustration-weighted atm. Increasing the chances to get 4star weapons by a good amount but leaving the requirements to upgrade them to 5 or 6 star as it is would maybe do the job right without implementing new gem-graveyards ;).
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,Exastiken,5,Tue Jul 14 08:51:54 2015 UTC,I'd probably spend gems or cash on alternate looks for 6* heroes. So sick of the white hair brigade.

crusadersquest,3d5ek6,SartorialistRage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:45:12 2015 UTC,So many of them change to white hair it sucks. Also Archon. If I could get a brown hair 6* Archon I'd be stoked
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,digilinx,2,Tue Jul 14 02:51:28 2015 UTC,What? 4 star only contracts SHOULD be implemented. Imagine if Brave Frontier allowed trash mobs to be pulled through the rare aummon gate. This game should be the same way. If im spending 6 gems it better damn well be a 4 star.
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,SartorialistRage,0,Mon Jul 13 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"Don't know about Brave Frontier, but gems are pretty easy to make in CQ, don't know how easy it is to earn premium currency in BF, so can't make a direct comparison.  IF they introduced a 4* contract it wouldn't cost 6 gems.. it'd be more like 20 or so. and at that price I would still buy them."
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,digilinx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:05:35 2015 UTC,Well in BF everytime you clear a section of the map you get a gem. 5 gems = one premium summon. And summons have a really high chance to go above 4*
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,Jibblious,0,Tue Jul 14 01:05:21 2015 UTC,"Until I play the game still won't really know what the value of gems are in BF, and what the value of 4 stars are in BF. Or how easy/difficulty it is to progress from 3* to 4* etc...  What I'm trying to say is that you can't compare a CQ premium contract to the BF aummon gate, and CQ 4* heroes with BF 4* heroes if the 'value' of them aren't equitable.  Just had a quick look at BF wiki, seems like max is 7* and team/squad size is 5, and just with this information it seems that you can't directly compare heroes between the 2 games.  Just a question, once you have a full team, how long does it take to EARN a 7* unit of your choice? I just want to know roughly, because most established CQ players can earn one or two 6* units per week with the bread dungeon. So that's about 2 weeks of playing to get a new team."
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,UrsaCircus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:37:02 2015 UTC,"Comparatively, jewels are a hell of a lot easier to get than gems in BF, haha. Unless they changed something since I quit, BF has nothing like coliseum, in that you use up your source of free gems eventually and have to wait for events/new content to get more."
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,SartorialistRage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:06:42 2015 UTC,"As Someone who plays BF daily Yes gems are still difficult to get. especially once you clear out all content that gives gems your only choice ends up being waiting for Gumi to give out free gems, Waiting for more content or Compensations. In comparison CQ is a cakewalk to get jewels in(im sitting on 147 and use a good 10+ of them every week on various things)."

crusadersquest,3d5ek6,clammyhams,2,Mon Jul 13 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"Another one that won't happen...  Bread is this games soft-ceiling... Allowing Bread to be purchased in such a fashion would allow progression at a rapid rate. Yes, it would require any given user to spend money but...there are people that would.  I know the thought that probably came to mind just now is ""Toast wants to make money so wtf are you even saying""...well, think from a business perspective... You don't want one or two MACRO-transactions...you want numerous MICRO-transactions. People would be able to dump money in, progress to where they feel comfortable...and spend no more money on gems because they don't feel the need."
crusadersquest,3d5ek6,JTNVinh,0,Mon Jul 13 22:42:41 2015 UTC,"Cq could nickel and dime the hell out of their users if they really wanted to.

crusadersquest,3d6y6c,slimgogo,2,Tue Jul 14 00:24:07 2015 UTC,"Himiko's heal is extraordinarily powerful because it scales with the opponent's strength and cripples their offensive capabilities. It also serves as a source of 3-Chains through 1-Chain spam which can be very helpful as well.  Stein heals when attacked which is powerful but niche. Against high hit count units (like those encountered on Stage 6 of FoS), he's fairly reliable.  Chai is often discounted because of her poor accuracy but the SP gain seems helpful. I don't have her so I can't say much else.  I'm in pretty much the same place as you when it comes to FoS to be honest. All I can recommend is to Train your heroes a bit more if possible. :/"
crusadersquest,3d6y6c,SirQuortington,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:30:50 2015 UTC,Thank you for your answer. Never though about hikari chain 3 capabilities. Would be awesome with willheim/n9 on worldboss I guess.  I'll try stein on lvl 6 a soon as I promote him 6. we'll see.
crusadersquest,3d6y6c,digilinx,2,Tue Jul 14 12:49:07 2015 UTC,"Okay some advice from me is.  You can probably clear the first 3 stages of FOS with 5* heroes with GOOD weapons and some training. ( If you want you can add what weapons you have available, because once you have +3 6* heroes it's most effective to start collecting good weapons for your dps ). This way you can save your 6* for later stages.  I find Chai very useful for FOS 5 ( the one where the big machine pushes you back, it pushes you back into the food you would have missed )  The tier list is mainly for PVP/Colo, so people even if they are great in colo they wouldn't do well in FoS  Himiko is not about the healing, she prevents the enemy from doing damage. Because if you think about it this way, each point of damage prevented is equal to each point of damage healed, Then noone would out heal himiko, because she has the ability to prevent WAY more damage any any healer heals. ( Also because it's prevented, it means that your effective max health also increases so you don't die from burst ). I usually have himiko leader with EoG and a 3 chain chaser and just spam 1 chains  Sigruna isn't single target, it hits the backline, so if they have multiple people there, they all get hit. She's very good in colo to snipe the backline dps ( wizards and hunters generally ) in FoS, I just use her to solo FoS 1-5 with pristina.  Lilith is more for Colo as well, she just brings out magic storm quickly and can win colo in a few blocks, but in PVE/FOS she's not as strong because of her low health. but if you can protect her with alex/joan healer she will be able to continually do massive damage with MS.  One more tip for Alex (and Joan) is to time your block usage, there's no point using their blocks as soon as they appear. The take damage for allies buff stays for 5 seconds, so only use it when the enemies start attacking and wait 4 seconds before activating the next one, so you get longer coverage for the squishy heroes they should be protecting."
crusadersquest,3d6y6c,digilinx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this in depth answer !   I've at least 1 or 2 of each 6 star weapon atm. Usually 1 with AP the other with MP. I'll try use more 5 star hero at begining with 6 star weapon. Okay looks like a good idea, I might try that with chai as soon as I promote her. I get it on himiko, but I just see on the other hand nurspy doing a better job at it (and I've her SBW6* with def def, my only one, thanks to gifts from toast) For sigrunae then i guess i'll wait to promote her. It looks like R0 would do the same job than her but in a chaser role.   Thanks for your help and your time !"
crusadersquest,3d6y6c,NaviHog,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"Don't promote Chai unless you have nothing else to promote because she's not that useful generally.  Himiko and Nurspy fill different spots on teams, Nurspy works really well with 3chain melee heroes, while Himiko works great with ranged chasers, like naz or robin, and throw in a melee chaser to tank, or another healer with rez.  There's nothing special about Sigruna that makes her better than other ranged 3 chainers, but you use what you can get =D"
crusadersquest,3d6y6c,flie22,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:33:23 2015 UTC,"I'am curious now, I want to try sigrunae :D What would works well with her. I'am sure mondeok would fit nicely but I don't have him. I suppose healer with Eog will be standard. Would I be able to use her on stage 7-10 ? Thanks for your help"
crusadersquest,3d6y6c,Taroncus,2,Tue Jul 14 13:59:19 2015 UTC,"I personally dislike himiko because she can't heal during downtime. (Just try having your heroes walk to the next encounter with 20% hp and you will know why.) For this reason I gave her tSanctuary for the healing. Smile would work, just something to let her heal the team during downtimes.  Lilith is an SP engine. 3 single blocks can give 100sp, hence her frailty to compensate for her speed. Usually most would give her tMR for stunlocking, or tMagic Storm to abuse her speed.  for FOS 8 I personally use Dorothy (sbw)Nightingale and Stein because of the multi hit spells you encounter, plus most of the damage comes from magic. It doesn't have to be that lineup but you must take into account of the heavy magic damage you encounter.  If Bella proves unsuccessful consider Sera or Anut to migitate damage."
crusadersquest,3d6y6c,Koniss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:01:31 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks for your advice, Himiko with Sog would compensate with her issue on healing, i'll try that, probably the same with stein aswell."
crusadersquest,3d6y6c,jarch3r,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:06:25 2015 UTC,"Both Himiko and yeow is used mainly for their utilities. Healing factor probably not their best. Himiko has 50% chance to make a 3 chain which is really good for chaser like nazrune, robin, etc.  Yeow can keep your block bar full of blocks. Mix yeow and stein together and 1 chaser you probably have a solid team for later level of FOS."
crusadersquest,3d6y6c,arichone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:42:27 2015 UTC,"You used a lot of 6s at the start. Floor 1-4 should be able to clear with most 6s with Prestina to give sustain. Floor 5 can be cleared by solo hikari or solo Kriem or solo Vivian with life steal, or a good 6 star with high training with Prestina."
crusadersquest,3d4w3i,AlxStgt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:27:46 2015 UTC,"I would recommend holding off on fully upgrading an A/D one and hold out for AA. For Fos 9 and 10 damage is very important. The faster you clear those mobs the higher chance you have of clearing. The general strategy with Archon is to spam her 3 chains fast enough that she is far off the screen and out of harms way while the mobs melt to her magic balls.   Extra armor won't do Archon much good if she can't deal enough damage to clear the mobs. It may increase survivability and let her take one or two extra hits, but it's not worth the trade off of losing out on all the damage."
crusadersquest,3d4w3i,gentlegreengiant,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"There is no need for defense, when using archon at any high-level he will hardly ever be touched so def is the least needed slot for him. He attacks from off screen and that is where you want to keep him so his double HA% or HA + life steal can work."
crusadersquest,3d4w3i,arichone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:04:29 2015 UTC,People run Archon with Alex or Joan to prevent him to get one shotted. Standard setup is Archon/Mew/Alex-Joan.  So 6* an Atk/Def staff will be really underwhelming and imho a waste of the iron you are using.

crusadersquest,3d4w3i,NaviHog,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:39:15 2015 UTC,"Personally I run Archon with +HA 28.75% and Armor +287.  Why?  Having +28% HA or LifeSteal +17% sounds very OP, but in my runs of Gallery and WB4, Archon always get sniped by a surprise physical attack, Joan or not. Having 287 armor (that's about 40% physical dmg reduce, mind you) gives me an insurance that Archon can't get punished for a slight mistake.  And for the argument of less attack is bad, Archon +4 with 28.75% atk is already at 1700 atk. That's 510 apen+rpen. Giving up 280 atk (If you can even get 2x MAX HA) for 300 armor (+50% dmg resist vs physical) is worth it to me.  henceforthletthefiresburn"

crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Fuzaki,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:06:12 2015 UTC,I'm going to right now haha. I'm trying to use my other guys so I can save this team for FoS 9. Alex/Mew/Lilith is my personal favorite too. I use it as my main in Colosseum. Thanks again Fuzaki ~^
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Fuzaki,2,Sun Jul 12 06:28:48 2015 UTC,"Np, hope it works it out :D  Just a note, I personally used Dionne but you could probably get by without her. I would say just watch out for Fenerith's DoT acid since that could kill her even after you beat it. Other compositions listed could also do the job, I'm sure. I actually want to see how well the team lasts in FoS10 but I can't get any other team to clear FoS9 at the moment."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,FuzzJH,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:13:32 2015 UTC,"Alex and Lilith doesn't work in FoS10 for me. Tried many times to no avail.   Both of them are at +MAX with almost perfect weapons, Alex with SBW. Lilith just can't churn out enough damage to kill the bosses before they start buffing their attack damage.   I have yet to try this team with mew, but I think that it MIGHT be possible if both Alex and Mew have SBWs with ideal conversions and at a decent training level.   The problem would be with the skill Lilith is using, for mine, I have her with tMS. Without bella or a well timed anut, the magic immunity buffs on bosses really destroys her damage output and that's a problem. Sera might work to protect the team during the heavy attacks, but I'm not too sure how it'll work out.  If there's anyone with this lineup that works for FoS10, I would really like to know what are the weapon conversions and goddess used."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Fuzaki,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:05:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thnx for the info. I didn't fully expect Lilith to last FoS9 myself. I wonder, are bosses in FoS10 immune to stun? I know some people run tMR Lilith precisely because of the crazy stunlock you can achieve, albeit you'll be giving up a lot of damage."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Whirlvvind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"Yes all the WBs are immune to stun in FoS9 and 10, only the hero/trash minions are stunnable."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,zKen,2,Fri Jul 17 01:32:15 2015 UTC,Stage 9 can be easily cleared with Korin + 5/6* Mew.  Can I have a look at your team? You could even list it out for me if you cant get a picture.
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,zKen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:14:18 2015 UTC,"Picture of my team coming right up.  Imgur1 Imgur2  A different type of ""team building exercise!"" Ba-da-ting!!! ...I will go away now."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,zKen,3,Sun Jul 12 07:33:18 2015 UTC,"Possible teams from your selection: Works for FOS 9 and up.  Leader is always mentioned first - unless stated otherwise;  1) Korin + Mew + Filler (strong dps or SOI paladin if FOS10)  2) Yeowoodong + Nazrune/ Robin (you can try) + Secondary Healer/ OR Joan OR Paladin with SOI  3) Archon + Joan + Mew (highly breaded for FOS10)  4) Lilith (with TransLB) + Alex/ Joan + Stein/ Mew(with SBW) - not very reliable.  5) Mundeok + Yeo + Thor (double SOI, takes time, but works)  6) Maria + D'Art (IF YOU GET HER, GOOD LUCK) + Susanoo (or Yeowoodong - then put her leader)  I noticed you do not have a Gon. She is amazing, as a catalyst to make everything go faster. Works perfectly with Mundeok + Mew due to their passive synergy, and works as well with Yeowoodong due to increasing the speed the chain-3 train repeats. (extra +20SP)  With reference to the Mundeok + Mew + Gon strat listed above by Taroncus, using Aubrey is better than Sera IF you are unsure when the skills are coming out, or if you are plain lazy. Using Bella and Dionne are riskier but clears faster (if you are feeling lucky?) - Transcended skills that are required --> SOI and EOG. Fire Rain is a bonus, just to speed things up. Perfect weapons are not as mandatory for this team as it only increase clearing speed. HOWEVER, clearing speed is important to reduce the RNG factor of blocks, which may affect your perma SOI. And also to quickly kill Dionemesis as he can remove your SOI."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Koniss,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:28:04 2015 UTC,"Wow nice. Thanks for the guide zKen. Can't want to try these out. How are you guys so pro at this! I will go power-level Gon, see if she can help lead the way. Also, if I were to get a 6* Gon, what weapon, skill and team should I use for her? Thanks again!"
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Taroncus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"Answerer unless you have a good 5* weapon already. Fire Rain should be the best. Team with Mundeok and Mew, or Yeowoodong for best results. Works decently with any hero reliant on the special - like Archon, Korin with tMRs, or Paladins with SOIs."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Taroncus,2,Sun Jul 12 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"archon/mew/joan would be my first pick, this team is my to go team for fos 10 so i see no problem w them clearing fos 9. korin/mew/thor nazrune/yeow/roland can also clear fos 9 pretty easily"
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Whirlvvind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:17:33 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks Koniss.
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Taroncus,2,Sun Jul 12 17:17:41 2015 UTC,"So stage 9 I used Maria, yeo(lead), and dart with Dionne. I just use this comp whenever i'm stuck on any kind of PVE and it always work(except road to ruin dungeon which I used sneak, sneak, dart). I have energy of goddess on yeo, L&L on dart, and trans blood donation on maria. I used to have non-trans smile of goddess on maria which works the same. The one thing you have to pay attention is trying to charge up 1 Dionne and use it immediately at the start, even sometimes meaning to not wait till you have 3 yeo blocks at once, sometimes you might have to use 2 yeo block chains at the start just to charge up the last bit of the first goddess charge and use it. Cause due to lack of blocks at the start the first wave sometime is a little risky. After the first wave you usually have some energy of goddess on your hands to use so most likely you don't have to worry about running out of heals like the first wave. And just constantly use Dionne should be a faceroll for the rest of the stage.   For FOS10 I use Mundeok(lead) with Shield of Inv, Mew with energy, Gon with flame arrow. Just make sure you have shield of invincibility and make sure you have it on constantly after the first wave then you should be fine. I have maxed Gon with SBW, but I think without SBW should just do fine. The key is to just make sure after you beat the first wave, for the rest of the stage you constantly have a shield of invincibility on, then you are golden. Also use Sera."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Xereeth,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:17:21 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thanks Taroncus for your detailed strats, I will try those. But it might be a while because I don't have a 6* Gon or his SBW. I hate farming for SBW...I suck at it. The only SBW I have above 4* is a 6* Yeo SBW with D/D. My pride and joy...my only SBW that's worth a damn."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Whirlvvind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:38:17 2015 UTC,"No problem, I changed the edited the part where I talked about FOS10 due to something Whirlvvind pointed out. It's good to use Gon for the SP generation so you get SoI from Mundeok more easily so you can have it on constantly and although Gon SBW does help with SP generation but it is doable without it."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Xereeth,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:55:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll be able to just swap in ""any decent dps"" for a Maxed SP generating physicial piercer with a good SBW...........but still yea nice details."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,Xereeth,2,Sun Jul 12 08:27:44 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it. That is true because of the SP generating. Thanks for the update, I corrected my statement to ""Gon without SBW should do just fine"". Although SBW helps with SP generation, but it's mainly from Gon's passive, because at first I was clearing it without SBW."
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,RedFalchion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:49:33 2015 UTC,Sweet! runs to corner to power-level Gon
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,daintypie,2,Sun Jul 12 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"I have two teams that I can use for FOS 9. I either run Thor, Mew, Korin (L) or Maria (L), Sneak, and D'art"
crusadersquest,3cyi8n,daintypie,2,Sun Jul 12 05:24:38 2015 UTC,"I can clear FoS9 with Maria/Dart/Robin w/ Anut and Robin can die immediately on the Golem. The problem is that Maria needs practically perfect blocks otherwise you're screwed. There is no margin for error in wave 1, but if you can get past wave 1 with all 3 intact then clear chance shoots up to 90%.  I'm not sure how Sneak will do, because the the penetration of Robin clearing the little guys that come with the robots is what makes it doable, but I don't have a Sneak to test how good his explosions are on them."

Also, what do you think about enemies or skills that reduce armor? If you were to fight an enemy Susanoo, would he counter you?  And is Vivian strong against Rochefort because of her massive Magic Damage Swords?  Also, since Rochefort hits a lot as well, is Stein useful for mitigating a lot of his damage? Or maybe Abel, since he heals and reflects neutral damage?"
crusadersquest,3cur0p,SirQuortington,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:28:52 2015 UTC,"I've never noticed if Susanoo reduces damage! Susanoo tends to die too quickly for me to see. That needs testing! I imagine with the proper team, the answer would be no because Susanoo would be pushed away from your back line and Rochefort would be taking 50-75% less damage regardless of his poor armor.  Vivian's counter fuels Rochefort, so she is weak to him. Even though her damage is magic, they are 50-75% mitigated... and they are three extra hits that come fairly quickly.  Stein would need to be combined with people like Mondrian to additionally counter with a strong offense; Rochefort generally outdamages Stein's heal.  Abel is a good idea. Possibly!"

crusadersquest,3cur0p,AJackFrostGuy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:24:53 2015 UTC,Stein would need to be combined with people like Mondrian to additionally counter with a strong offense; Rochefort generally outdamages Stein's heal.   What about Roland against Roch? He can't counter when he's stunned.  And what about dmg reduction teams? Like Achilles SBW with Anut + stun/dmg dealer?  I think my lil' Sneak/Thor/Roland team should still be ok.
crusadersquest,3cur0p,mudkipwastaken,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:03:01 2015 UTC,"Roche maintains his counter queue through stuns, so Roland is not a complete answer.  Watch for which character you're using to reduce Rochefort's damage... he is based on armor, not attack power,so only characters who reduce damage output, not attack power will affect him. Anut for example does not affect Rochefort.  Playing against Rochefort is easier than being the CPU against a Rochefort, for sure. You have more logical options."
crusadersquest,3cur0p,jaetheho,2,Mon Jul 13 06:55:58 2015 UTC,I don't get his mechanics though.   After using his chain-3: 1. What's the indicator that he's already counter-attacking? 2. how many chain-1's can you use succeeding to his chain-3?  3. when do I chain-3 again?  p.s. i know this comment is more of a series of questions which might fit more in the mega thread but I've been wanting to know how to use rochefort since day 1 of his release.  edited: forgot to mention that a lot of rochefort users and enthusiasts are here.
crusadersquest,3cur0p,dash2k8,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:34:37 2015 UTC,"His block is a defense buff in the top left. While it's active, you can still counter-attack. The animation you watch for to know when your Hawk Counter is ready is an upward blue slash from Rochefort (with some enemy heroes he looks like he has ADD).  In PvC, I have found in practice that you do not need to refresh his 3-chain; he will continue to counter forever as long as you generate a block, use it, and successfully damage the enemy within acceptable counter times. In PvE, you will have to refresh after every wave.  This is dodgy. I've had 11 second PvC fights against Korins where they used Bella and I could counter for the entire fight with my 75% block rate;  in another fight where Dionne was being used, his counters definitely expired.  You chain-3 (or Chain-2) whenever you see Rochefort take more than three hits in a row while the enemy Bella is not active. This a surefire indicator that Rochefort is not hyped up on caffeine at that moment in time."

crusadersquest,3cur0p,Dohnought8765,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:50:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Roche + Susanoo is a good combination.  It also sounds like those two can be paired with lots of physical dps characters for great damage, not just D'Art.  How well does Sneak work?  How about pre-chasers like Gon or Magnus?  Magnus does really well against squishy mages like Mondy, and Gon's damage would probably be ridiculous with Susanoo.  That would help get Rochefort 3-chains - use both Gon's and Susanoo's blocks early to bring Roche's blocks together.  Maybe use Drake, if Roche's counters act as true chain 3s like No.9?  How about healers to mitigate the damage that Susanoo's SBW deals to himself, and make Rochefort even tankier?  Himiko might work well against AlexMewMondy to stop crits.  I'm afraid that I do not have 6* Susanoo (or Hikari) so I cannot try out the teams you mention.  I do, however, have 6* Rochefort, and I can already see why you like him so much.  I actually used late Tundra normal levels to train him to lvl60.  The weakness to AlexMewMondy in Colo leaves me a little doubtful, but my current Thorin Himiko team admittedly does have a weakness to burst teams with Sneaks/D'Arts, which this team is strong against.  I think I might actually use this team in those situations.  :D"
crusadersquest,3cur0p,Czekraft,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:53:56 2015 UTC,"It all works. Rochefort 6* + Farmboy + Farmboy works. :P You don't need anyone else. Rochefort is a god!  Realistically, as long as you have Susanoo in front, a single sword shot allows Rochefort to demolish the enemy team, no questions asked. Your Pre-chasers on the other hand are iffy. While Rochefort is a recommended main, you rarely need a 3-chain to kill the enemy team. With a pre-chaser, you might be inclined to wait for said 3-chain to attack, which leads to mistakes against heavier-hitting teams. They certainly work though.  Roche's counters do not act as true 3-chains; they are separate animations and only the 3-chain works as a 3-chain. The counters afterward are their own attacks.  Healers are effective with Roche, but Roche will not typically be the recipient of those heals. He combines well with Yeo (L), Woompa (L) and Himiko, using Rochefort as your (L). Mew will not benefit as often as you would like, for reasons listed above. Maria is ineffective as a 3-chain chaser, for reasons listed above. Nurspy and Stein are the same way, but are good choices for Rochefort where you would normally not expect to use them on other teams (and by that, I mean they are better fits than usual). If using Himiko, a 3-chain chaser or a pre-chaser would be more viable, as Himiko's passive proc can proc heroes with 3-chain requirements (and then you can spam Rochefort as normal)."
crusadersquest,3cur0p,ohgasauraus,2,Sat Jul 11 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"if that the case, use chaser free support like D'Art or Sasq where they are also 1 button spammer. the filler is there to enhance the team:p having good filler is better having a bad one i guess."

crusadersquest,3cur0p,Redsiamesecat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:13:07 2015 UTC,"Rochefort maintains his counter queue, but will not counter any new attacks while stunned. Generally speaking that means he can outpace Roland, but that's why I use Nazrune instead of D'Art. In actual practice, I throw in Anut if he is paired with multi hitters,  or Sera if he is paired with heavy hitters.  With Anut, you'd want to watch for a shield and use your Goddess after the first stun for an easier time spotting Roland's blocks.  With Sera, you pop Sera while Roche is stunned, taking care to use his blocks after seeing the first counter when he comes out of stun."
crusadersquest,3cur0p,Redsiamesecat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:51:54 2015 UTC,"In practice, your counter string resets if you use a block within those 5 seconds, but NOT the counter rate (i.e., if you use a 3-chain, you keep your 75% block rate)  So do that means, if Roche use a 1-chain after 3-chain while counterattacking, he still get to keep 75% counter rate instead of 25%?"
crusadersquest,3cur0p,iEdGamer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:41:01 2015 UTC,Yep! Watch the rate of 0 damage hits on your Rochefort after activating your blocks. :)
crusadersquest,3cur0p,Nincampoo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:46:08 2015 UTC,"I've tried running him with Drake/Robin. A tad bit slower and more unreliable but you'll always get a good string of crits (and with Robin's SBW, stuns) to spam your little Hawks. Plus, they all have nice hats."
crusadersquest,3cur0p,Djives87,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:47:03 2015 UTC,"Finally! Rochefort gets some attention after playing second fiddle to Roland. Kudos to you /u/CanadaCub for this in depth analysis on Rochefort. I totally agree with your analysis and experience using this unit. I'd like to share a couple of points that may be useful, especially for those who want to try using him.   First, when you use Roche, you really don't need to go for 3-block on the start of a PVC round. You can almost always get away with 2 or even 1-block use and activate his passive. So if the situation is less than ideal (no third block), use what you have and you can still counter. However, this move (not waiting for 3-block) might be detrimental for you if you have a chaser tagging along. Also, when you start pumping those passive generated blocks, try to hold a second or so before using it, this will enable you to maximize the time the counter effect is up.   Second, it's a MUST that Roche have a high crit chance. In my opinion, much more important than armor or damage reduction. My two cents is that he needs to make those falcons continuously roll and if, by some act of RNG, none of them crit the falcon train will stop rolling. I run my Roche with a golden sword 86.5% Crit Damage and 10% + 10% Crit Chance, bringing his crit chance to 40%. Sure my damage is low and have trouble with high armor units but when he crits, it's gonna hurt.   Third, make comps that ABUSE his ability to push opponents to the wall. I run Rochefort/Mandy/Nightingale. Once Roche pushes all of them to the wall, Mandy's 1-block poison cloud eats away at their life. I've tried Roche with Naz, the problem was if Naz chases enemies will launch in the air, chances are Roche might miss and he won't crit, no block gen. Also tried Roche with Drake, in theory that's a lot of crit right? Yup that's true, but it's very difficult to proc Drake's shield, because Roche's 3-block attack is only one hit. If it doesn't crit, no shield.   My biggest issue still is what Special Skill is best for him. My experience with Heaven Slash is that the animation is too long, usually by the time it ends, the 5 second window of his passive has ended as well. I decided to experiment with Sword Dance, got tSD on first try. It's good, lots of magic damage with heal all to boot. The animation was quick and still had the chance to activate passives. I never had AP on my weapon so no harm. The MAIN problem of SD or tSD is that when you have pushed your opponents to the wall, and you do SD, not all the swords will hit, so it's not that effective.   My only question for you, CanadaCub, is what's your experience with Wind Slash? Is it effective even if the enemies are hunched against the wall?  Great analysis, once again, and I hope Rochefort will now be considered by many after this."
crusadersquest,3cur0p,BaTHaLo21,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:27:06 2015 UTC,"Awesome addition! I'm glad someone else has had the same experience as me.  I was originally running 4/4 Wind Slash but wasn't a very big fan. tWS is infinitely better... the counter damage from the armor is huge. Your preference for the Golden Sword with the Crit Damage would be a treat with the extra 800 base counter damage, given your crit chance.  In the corner, your damage from Wind Slash isn't the primary concern, since it's 525% of your attack (and his attack is poor). The armor/resistance benefits are what I use Wind Slash for.  Mid-Field Wind Slash with its transcended proc however, which is pretty common, is another game ender up Roche's sleeve. 1050% is hard to ignore.  All in all, I haven't found another replacement for Wind Slash. tDB suffers from the same range issue... and you already hit the nail on the head with Heaven Slash (the spinning storm or whatever suffers from the same animation problem). Final Judgment could be good, but probably not with the Golden Sword and it would have to be transcended with a Herev (but might be a good alternative), so maybe that?  Edit: Maybe you'd even have luck with Flame of Avarice. No one uses that. Maybe I'll try that out with my second Roche as a counter to Roland. :O  Nothing else really compares on paper."
crusadersquest,3cur0p,chrisisnatural,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:48:01 2015 UTC,"I've seen a video somewhere before of a guy using Roche with Flame of Avarice. Sadly, the video was more on the PVE usage. No PVC. Though it looks nice with the cool flame pillar, the animation sequence is again a bit long, I dunno if it's sustainable.   It's only now I've been reading in full detail the passives for the Warrior skills, and I did NOT notice that the 200% damage boost based on ARMOR. I've always thought it was HA. Maybe I should have my eyes checked. As of this writing, I'm now convinced that WS is the way to go for him. I'm gonna say goodbye to my tDB once Great! Skills up event is up.   On a side note, have you noticed anything with Roche and Cano? Well, pre-patch, Roche procs Cano's lasers to such an extent that I get 4-5 procs just from 1-block of Cano and continuous spam of Roche blocks. Now, I don't think I can proc that much."
crusadersquest,3cur0p,LuckyCritical,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:21:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Cano is non-issue and dies to just one Hawk Counter with the number of regular counters she would normally already be damaged by.

crusadersquest,3cur0p,michaeltks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:37:17 2015 UTC,"Roche and Drake don't go well together, from my experience. If you use him as Lead, you're going to depend on his 3-block attack as the first move in the round. And it's only a single hit move, so your chances of crit is only on that move. More than half of the time I used him with Drake, I just gain the Drake crit boost, but no Shield proc.   But if you're gonna use no.9 in the equation maybe your chances of landing a crit will be higher."

crusadersquest,3cur0p,chrisisnatural,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:43:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, Rochefort/Hikari/No.9. The comp works because Rochefort doesn't need anyone once he begins to counter; the other two are spammy enough to fill out 4k-6k damage while Rochefort does the rest.  As with all of my previous posts, I would be wary about 3-chain chasers. Drake will offer a crit buff, but not the shield in more matches than not. Rochefort really appreciates his counters and you don't always have time to wait for the 3-chain (in fights you DO 3-chain in, you will never lose, so you can opt for a faster DPS)."

crusadersquest,3cur0p,yoryolite,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:53:55 2015 UTC,"Once again, he doesn't really need his allies, nor does he synergize well with anyone.  Rochefort can be spammed, but it isn't ideal. He functions best at 3-chains, works well at 2-chains, but will have some difficulty with a 1-chain against magic teams. If he crits with a Hawk Counter,  expect to upgrade your block string to a 2-chain or 3-chain to ensure survival and victory."

And the fact that everything except boss died instantly didn't help either.  Edit: Just test him out with crit. damage in practice. Sadly it doesn't effect the ghost. So I doubt resist pen will do anything. Somehow his ghost damage went up a bit by using 45% crit damage+408 resist pen  though.   Edit2: After some tesing. Turn out his ghost base atk went up from half Necron Hp to half Necron Hp+raw weapon damage(240 for 6* staff). Great."

Also, gave Leon & Nightingale good votes b/c I was able to get a Rochefort after beating The Void B20 40'ish times with 1xLeon + 2xNightingale...  I've also gave Alex a decent vote, but so far I'm not a fan of pure-tank style... and I haven't really get the feel of Sneak/9 + Susanoo + Alex in PvE... maybe I ought try more... or is that like a good build for PvP?

crusadersquest,3cu1u4,djhp,3,Fri Jul 10 19:48:48 2015 UTC,"Your best offensive hero is Archon. Get her to 6 stars first because her coupled with Mew is extremely strong. Try to get transcended Mana Recycle on her ASAP as well, as that's when she really shines. Don't focus on weapons until you have a full (or near full) six star team. Don't forget to do weekly bread dungeon, because you'll soon find that bread will limit you (gold will limit you later). Save gems for 50 gem contracts during rate ups. Meanwhile, keep promoting three star units. I would focus on paladins to get Alexander, because Alex/Mew/Archon(L) is one of the best teams there, but you will also eventually get Alex through a quest in Volcano Hard."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Akavcuaha,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:35:48 2015 UTC,Joan is a suitable replacement for Alex. I would actually go for Joan rather than Alex because you may get other warriors (like Susanoo) in the process and because you will eventually get Alex.

crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Akavcuaha,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:41:11 2015 UTC,"tMR + Mew will allow you to nearly permastun the opponents, keep your shock orbs up nearly indefinitely, and even with a bad weapon I'm sure your Archon will outdamage your Gip."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Akavcuaha,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:44:15 2015 UTC,"This is great advice, I think I understand the synergy here.  Thanks for taking the time to help me.  Should I start making Archon the leader instead of Leon?  That way I maximize the blocks I get?"
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Pezmage,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:47:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Archon should only use 3 chains. Ideally, youd want 6 blocks -- one 3 chain to buff her and the second 3 chain to summon her shock spheres. Each of her 3 chains will give mew blocks, which help Mew build up to Energy of Goddess. This then gives Archon more blocks. See the cycle? Alex/Joan are there to soak up all damage (which Mew heals), but Leon should suffice for now :)"
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Pezmage,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:13:19 2015 UTC,The other fun thing about Joan in that comp is it makes more tMRs once you get your team 6*'d.  That's one of my higher level FoS team ups.
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Czekraft,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:00:01 2015 UTC,tMR Archon with a tEoTS Mew essentially breaks the game. It's what I used to get through pretty much all of hard mode.  Coupled with an Alex for colo I was able to push 30-40 gems a week pretty easy when I was starting out.
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Akavcuaha,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:59:18 2015 UTC,I don't recommend trying to get any tSkills when you are a beginner  -You don't need them to beat the game  -It's extremely pricy.   -Evolving heroes would cost between 30-60k while tSkills could cost over 100k and there's no guarantee you'll get them (especially with no event).  -So it's a choice to guarantee a stronger hero for all stats vs taking a risk for a stronger hero damage-wise.
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,guahahahah,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:51:42 2015 UTC,"Even without tMR, I would prioritize Archon over Leon to be honest. Keeping Leon as a tank would still be a good idea, but Archon should be lead as Leon is a pseudo 3 chainer."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,liberalfamilia,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:22:48 2015 UTC,This. 6* Archon with TMR and lifesteal/Prestina can solo carry up to 4-24 (Hard) with even 4* weapons.
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,sufijo,2,Sun Jul 12 02:34:06 2015 UTC,"never buy weapon from Popo, the rescued vendor. It's way too pricey while you can farm the 6* weapon on World Boss. Go to in-game chat box, ask someone to carry you. They'll be happy to help! I know i would."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,liberalfamilia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:07:02 2015 UTC,"Not accurate, I remember buying a 4 or 5 star something from popo several weeks before I could obtain a better weapon from WB, since I was much too weak. It was definitely worth the gold at that time."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,sufijo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:55:26 2015 UTC,"if what you had to remember was someone kind to carry you throughout WB3 and you get a 6* weapon, it will definitely worth more. One may be too weak, but never too weak to get carried for at least WB3. That will guarantee at least a 4* weapon.  It's just like when one say ""do not buy Mew from Popo"" but i bet everyone that bought Mew will say it's worth every gold in the world.   It's frickin' Mew. She will make you feel that it's always worth it no matter how you get it (reroll promotions, priest contracts)."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,cpdess,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:24:47 2015 UTC,"That is IF you have enough meat to even play WB3, not until level 10, and even then one run would take all your meat. Also you need to find someone willing, and also capable of carrying you, and I believe the game kinda tries to match you with people your level because I remember frequently trying to beat WB3 and failing because my companion full 6 star team couldn't beat it.  Of course I knew nothing about the heroes so I didn't really knew which teams could beat each WB so I just had to rely on watching the stars, it didn't always work. Using the chat might make it much easier though.  What I'm trying to say is, it's definitely better to run WB if you can, but if you find a cheap weapon you can use right now which is much better than the one you are using, it could be worth while buying it as running WB is really luck dependant on lower levels, 20k~ is not that much gold anyway."

I used Archon/Mew/Joan from pretty much start to finish, equipped with 3* Mermaid Staff/3* Hourglass/3* Steel Sword all the way through 4-24.

crusadersquest,3cu1u4,jarch3r,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:01:31 2015 UTC,"If you haven't gotten to bread dungeon floor 9 yet, that should be your first priority.  The weekly bread dungeon is the engine that drives your progress in this game.   You can turn meat into gold doing quests or just grinding levels.  You can turn tickets into meat and honor doing colo.  You can't really get bread reliably anywhere BUT the bread dungeon, and it's only up for a day or so each week.  If you aren't throwing keys at it while it's up you're not going to progress.  That said, the trick to clearing bread dungeon 9 is using NOTHING BUT 3 CHAIN ATTACKS!  If you use a 2 or 1 chain attack, you'll heal the monster and cause it to do extra damage to you.  If you're having trouble consistently and quickly clearing bread dungeon floor 9, here's the secret (other than having a 6* Mundeok) :  2 priests (not Nurspy, not Melissa) and anything else that has a multi-shot attack. You have Archon, Archon can work, she isn't the ""best"" for this, but she does just fine.  The best units for this, I think, are archers with either the block skill Driving Arrows, or the block skill Driving Feathers.  So use Archon (put mana recycle on her), Mew and then just pick a 3 or 2 star priest that doesn't do any dmg with their block skills. Load it up and just tap away at the priest skills until you get two archon 3-chains.  Hitting the monster with a 3 chain will stun it, and each attack while it's stunned will do damage.  Rinse and repeat.  It might take a bit, but you should be able to kill the monster no problem.  Keep doing this. Get bread. Promote Heroes.   Archon/Mew/Leon will do you just fine in Colo, you should be able to get to Master's at least once you 6* that team.  If you can get an Alex it's a bit safer, that was the team I used for the longest time. As others have said, try to get tMR on Archon as soon as possible. You also want to try to get a Yeowoodong (priest) for the skill Energy of the Goddess, if you have a 6* tMR Archon and a 6* tEoTS Mew you can keep pretty much the entire game on perma stun.  Also: If you're on Android and want to burn meat to try to get weapons, I'd be happy to carry you through some WB3s."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,LawfuI,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:50:37 2015 UTC,"Weapons really aren't an issue. I used a 2* sword on my Leon well after getting him to 6* +2 simply because the enchant I had on it was good enough and that I knew that leveling them was more important than putting resources into weapons (meat for WBs, etc).  Use Archon for the bread dungeon paired with 2 healers and farm as much bread as you can when it is up, then spend your bread to level your guys. Ignore Giprang, he is awful."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Pezmage,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:38:24 2015 UTC,"I've been playing less than 3 weeks and have already cleared tundra normal. You can do it too. :) As others have said, feed your archon and let her do her magic. Hoard that high star bread for her. Don't waste gold on other things. Completely ignore weapons for the most part. Most of mine are still 3 star. Do not buy anything from popo.  Start Archon Mew Leon and then replace Leon with Alex once you obtain him from the quest. Only Archon needs 6 stars to clear that far. Alex is pretty bad until 6 starred.  Some Archon kicking butt action. I did get lucky obtaining mew's sbw first, but it's not necessary."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,LawfuI,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:23:19 2015 UTC,"Well, first off i can say that you are not very active if it took you to get to chapter 1 hard a few months.  As for your heroes, you do hit a wall around that time and you stagnate slightly because you need a stronger team setup and to start upgrading your units to 6*.  You have Archon, so i would strongly recommend pouring all your resources into her, while trying to find her a weapon with +12~15%  Lifesteal, that way you should be able to clear the whole hard story line without much issue.  Thats for the PvE part.  However archon is also decent for WB, after you get her to 6* along with the rest of your team.  As for PvP - Leon is the only viable unit you have currently for it.  Leon 6* alone should be able to get you to masters by the end of the week, if you are very active in PvC, however i would not recommend upgrading him to 6* at this point, because while he might be able to make your PvC life easier for a bit, he will quickly become less useful as you acquire better heroes.  I would instead recommend upgrading Archon>Mew to 6*, in that order, and set it as a priority to get Alexander from the quest line, to be used as your frontline for those two.  And use that for both PvC and PvE until you are able to pull out some top tier PvC heroes like Sneak, Lilith, Mondrian and some others, to replace that team.  Some people might suggest Joan as a frontline but she is way too squishy and needs a lot of resources poured into her to be viable, while Alex requires minimal maintainance."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Pezmage,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:39:08 2015 UTC,"Are you saying Archon is no good for PvC, or just 4-5* Archon?"
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,LawfuI,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, Archon in general is not good for PvC.  Requires too many blocks to be able to do damage, and if the old PvC AI was forgiving enough to let you have enough time to generate those blocks most of the time, i'm afraid that with the new stronger AI, Archon just isn't viable anymore.  Think about it, you need 6 blocks to active Archon's passive if there is no alternative buffer in the team, and more-often then not, you will also need tMR to keep the enemy team stunned  and locked down until they die, or else most likely they will kill your team.  Archon doesn't fit into the PvC meta very well, but is the strongest PvE unit however.  If you are new to CQ and googled up 4-5 months old information, which said that Archon used to be a strong PvC unit in the past, not anymore, that information is outdated."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Pezmage,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"Well that's sad to hear. I got my sneak/sneak/sus running about three weeks ago but was rolling archon/Mew/Alex before then and had a high 90s win rate.   I'd do the first chain 3 to get the Mew block, then do the next as a 2 chain to pull my tMR out. Next archon block would typically be the win, if it wasn't I'd hit my mew tEoTS in the next block or so and that's be the win.  Edit: this is speaking from over a month of nothing but Archon/Alex/Mew in PvC."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Curarx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:36:54 2015 UTC,"You dodged a bullet i guess, around the same time they fixed PvC AI and weapon upgrades became available to the AI.  If the old AI didn't have weapon conversions, the new AI does, and it makes the AI teams that much stronger.  If a triple sneak or d'art team was a joke in the past, now a single sneak or d'art is actually scary to face, because they can wipe your entire team within a split of a second if they have good conversions on their weapons and you aren't careful.  Surely Archon is still usable in PvC, but i wouldn't count on winrate as high as she could have had before.  I've personally not used Archon in PvC because i got Mondrian very early, however i've read about 80-90% winrate being possible on her, but with the recent changes to the AI, i just can't imagine Archon being able to survive half the fights she would against with the old AI, because, even my Mondrian winrate took a nosedive from 99% to around 80%."
crusadersquest,3cu1u4,Pezmage,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:26:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I switched to sneak/sneak/sus right before they allowed weapon conversions on the AI.  That's too bad. I mean, makes it easier for me to get to and stay top 5% but sucks for people just starting out :("

To get the most out of her passive procs, it's probably best to main her so the whole party is eligible to proc when hitting the cursed target. It's best to have a penetrator like Robin, Naz or Hikari to round off and assure curse activations.  Nurspy is probably the better offensive healer and slots more easily into parties   Melissa kinda needs to be tailor built around."
crusadersquest,3cttt0,Curarx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:29:06 2015 UTC,I just got her to 6* this morning.   Paired her with necron to test their viability together(MR and tEoG respectively.) Pleasantly surprised at how well they work together.     Although necron outstrips her for dps and healing.
crusadersquest,3cttt0,ohgasauraus,2,Sat Jul 11 18:25:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't take Necron's healing as a comparison. All he heals is his summon which he can resummon so it's not any real heals at all.

Speaking of misunderstandings: I'm not too sure about Archon's passive (6*).  It says: Using a chain-3 skill will increase the party's defense and magical penetration by 30% of the Hero's attack power.  So what exactly do they mean with defense and magical penetration?   Magical penetration is self explanatory but what about the defense-part?   Do they mean 30% increased armor penetration, hence 30% increased armor penetration and magical penetration  or 30% increased resistance/armor?  I'm probably a bit stupid aswell but could someone please clarify that?"
crusadersquest,3cotx4,lotusrunner,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:20:57 2015 UTC,30% of Archon's HA will be added as armor/resist penetration to the whole party.

I use 5 star vivian and fillers for floor 1 and 5 star rachel for floor 2, but pretty much any 5 star can clear first two floors if you stack a couple blocks/special skills before the boss fight.  I think it was the sixth floor? it's hard as shit, those machine gun monsters pack a punch and are hidden inside other monsters so you can't hit them, I usually clear that with sig (with max blitz) + thor but any good burst AoE hero is good for that, I find the next couple floors actually easier."

crusadersquest,3clmnz,jaetheho,4,Wed Jul 8 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"I tend to prefer DR% for single slot priest weapons instead of HP%, except for Maria. Barring that, I tend to default to armor conversions over resist conversions for general PVE purposes.   I would also add that double DR% on heart or snow fragment is quite strong in PVC.  Maria with 35% DR is a horrible pain in the ass to deal with."
crusadersquest,3clmnz,gentlegreengiant,0,Wed Jul 8 21:57:30 2015 UTC,Why DR% when HP% is strictly better?   A great armor and res more than doubles the armor and resistance for many priests. That is 50% of damage reduced if not neutral. I'd say it's up to personal preference. I'll add that in though.
crusadersquest,3clmnz,gentlegreengiant,2,Wed Jul 8 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"It was actually from digilinx's thread on def conversions. The benefit of DR% is it also mitigates neutral damage, and isn't susceptible to shreds like armor or resist."
crusadersquest,3clmnz,CanadaCub,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:27:18 2015 UTC,You might be right on DR>arm/res but why DR over hp?   I am confident 23 hp > 17.25 DR even with the neutral damages.
crusadersquest,3clmnz,iEdGamer,5,Wed Jul 8 22:38:47 2015 UTC,"17.25% DR also means you have 17.25% less damage to heal.  At 10,000 health, if you are taking 2000 damage and healing 1000 damage, you will die after 9 hits, assuming the damage is always dealt first.  With 23% health, you have 12,300 health. You now die after 12 hits.  With 17.25% DR, if it is multiplicative where the attacks are now dealing 1655 damage, you die after 13 hits.  While 23% health is more effective health in the end, 17.25% DR is more sustainable health in the end with a healer.  In team comps where there are no healer, 23% is better. In team comps where there is a healer, DR is better.  IMO.  Edit: And I only say that only because some calculations rely on health. Without a healer, HP% and DR% afford exactly the same number of hits before death except in extreme cases."

crusadersquest,3clmnz,liberalfamilia,5,Wed Jul 8 22:15:24 2015 UTC,"Heals are less efficient point for point if the target has a higher health pool. If you heal 35 health in a pool of 100, you are healing 35%. If you heal 35 health in a pool of 123, you are healing 28.5%."
crusadersquest,3clmnz,CanadaCub,-6,Wed Jul 8 22:57:01 2015 UTC,i'm actually talking about healing 110 in a pool of 100 and 110 in a pool of 123.
crusadersquest,3clmnz,liberalfamilia,4,Wed Jul 8 23:07:16 2015 UTC,"There are no healers who will heal the entire value of a unit in any circumstance worth mentioning, so this is an unrealistic scenario.  In all likelihood, the characters who have defense conversions are paladins, who have health pools that far exceed the healing power of any of the healers, and healers themselves, who are back liners and whose heals only have an efficiency of 40-50% of their personal health after multipliers at best.  So you're talking about healing 2500-3000 in a pool of 7k-13k before colo buffs, minimum.  It's actually worse if you try to argue real values."
crusadersquest,3clmnz,CelerityDesu,-2,Wed Jul 8 23:23:54 2015 UTC,"i was thinking more like when your priest heals 20-25% of her hp, and when mostly priest hp are on 80%-90% during the battle (burst comes once in a while) and the priest are overhealing herself, which aren't gonna happen if she have 123% hp.  and this is more of a wb/fos situation too.  but i haven't made a precise calculation since either conversion is probably just slightly better, just like u said below (one more hit survivability). getting them to maxed is more important."
crusadersquest,3clmnz,liberalfamilia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:09:21 2015 UTC,"I maybe understand where you're coming from, but you should know that if you take 20 damage at max HP and subsequently heal 30, you'll be overhealing 10 regardless of what your max HP is.  DR increases the raw efficiency of your heals while HP does not, but HP can still be better in situations where you don't see as many heal blocks as you'd like, or for surviving a lot of burst damage. Both stats have a purpose."
crusadersquest,3clmnz,Senpai-San-Sama,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:16:03 2015 UTC,"it started off as an argument to a single slot of defense (which basically refers to Fantasy Harmony obviously) where HA% would fill the attack slot so it synergize well with more hp pool, as simple as that, but sure both are equally good and i don't mind since DR% is the shit now, since it's just recently fixed and people are so hyped about it, i know, a cheap conversion and can be maxed from low level weapon and freshly forged 4* sbw, why even bother to wait for 6* and roll HP%.

Function is near useless on Korin The highest Resist Pen you can get is also now 287, which is nothing without any HA atk buffs.   the 3 ATKs on Superior Staff is wayyy stronger.

crusadersquest,3clmnz,Alioun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"Some of that is not optimal, gonna quote myself here a bit:   Because HA stacks additively, getting CD and HA (assuming you already have a slot with pen, or penetration from elsewhere) should be better, as the average damage math is I believe (ignoring armor as it's not part of the point):  base*(1+HA mods)*(1+CC*(0.5+CD mods)) which adding numbers becomes:  base*(1.2875)*(1+CC*1.3725) VS. base*(1.575)*(1+CC*0.5)  Which breaks even at about 29%+ CC and gets better from there on when combining HA with CD :)   Sasquatch, rachel, kano, a lot of wizards have 35 CC or more which is more than enough for HA/CD to be better than HA/HA , for the wizards that don't need penetration HA/HA/CD breaks even with 3HA at almost 23% though so I think most times 3HA will be slightly better (unless you have any CC buff at all).  I'd also recommend rpen for sentinel, I doubt his passive 100 resist debuff is enough."
crusadersquest,3clmnz,CanadaCub,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:45:02 2015 UTC,"For Sentinel, According to http://www.inven.co.kr/board/powerbbs.php?come_idx=4006&my=con&iskin=cq&l=30034, the RPen from weapons dont apply to drones :(  Youre right on those wizards. ill change that"

crusadersquest,3clmnz,Alioun,2,Thu Jul 9 05:17:14 2015 UTC,thanks :D
crusadersquest,3clmnz,anscott,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:35:01 2015 UTC,This should really be made sticky :D Nice work!  But isnt a good anchor with CD/DR/CC sufficient for drake/thor aswell?
crusadersquest,3clmnz,anscott,2,Thu Jul 9 14:42:03 2015 UTC,"Drake's shields and Thor's passive lightning counter are based on the  maxHP of the character. Anchors don't have access to the 6* HP% conversion, so anything below a Volcano (or their SBW) is non-optimal.  For the other two, Drake's damage is too low on a regular hit for CD or HA% to matter, so we don't really care about that. Drake usually uses Lower the Anchor! as his skill, since it can proc his shield without the need for another character to 3-chain; Lower the Anchor! does a hefty amount of damage on crit with CD but is otherwise only used to proc Drake, so CD is used.   Drake also uses CC to increase the amount of Crit Chance he can transfer to his allies. Normally without his SBW, Drake will improve the party CC by 50% of his current CC, so everyone gets ~9% CC. With a CC% conversion, he can pass 19% on instead (assuming a great, which gives 20.x%). An Anchor weapon limits his CC% to a max of 13.8%, which translates to a total CC transfer of like 15.65%.  Thor uses CC to increase the crit chance of his thunderbolts, and since his bolts are based on maxHP%, CD can passively increase that crit damage, since only health will affect the base damage. Might as well modify what you can."
crusadersquest,3clmnz,anscott,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:55:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the fast and long answer! Didn't really expected that! Guess I have to get some good conversions on my volcanos then :P But my luck with conversions is so bad D: Nevertheless, thank you very much for your answer :D"
crusadersquest,3clmnz,Genechtagazoink,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:05:34 2015 UTC,"No worries. The game gets expensive on gold to optimize your characters to their 100% potential. Thankfully, Drake and Thor's SBWs are both superior to Volcano, so you don't need to worry too much about perfect conversions."

crusadersquest,3cls5x,Koniss,5,Wed Jul 8 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"As Lotus said, both shields when without Korin's SBW are considered the same type of shield, thus overwriting each other. Since Korin's SBW has a completely different effect, both visually and behaviorally when compared to her normal 6* block passive, it counts as a different buff, thus allowing both shields to stack. I think the main thing that allows this is the ""unable to be removed"" part of Korin's SBW effect, putting it on a different level."

crusadersquest,3cks11,Hugs2o6,2,Wed Jul 15 01:48:24 2015 UTC,I'm using it with hikari and dart to beat fos9 100% win rate so far been a few weeks now
crusadersquest,3cks11,digilinx,2,Wed Jul 15 01:43:44 2015 UTC,"Don't upgrade it yet, not worth it over the other SBWs.  Why would you sell it? even 4* def def is still better than the other weapons you could use with Maria. And at the low low cost of 1 weapon slot it's not that big of a deal.  Also they have plans to buff Maria's SBW."
crusadersquest,3cks11,Praius,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:41:11 2015 UTC,Could you link me where they mentioned that? I'm interested to know what the devs are planning

crusadersquest,3cks11,Czekraft,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:04:16 2015 UTC,What about buffing Joan's? The 2% life a second is useless compared to Alex's 30% more hp bonus.
crusadersquest,3cks11,digilinx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:02:46 2015 UTC,"The devs haven't mentioned buffing or modifying Joan's SBW.  and I think you're missing the point, Maria's SBW is marginally better than existing weapons, and most hunter sbws are marginally better, if not worse than already existing weapons.  Joan's SBW is already a lot better than the normal warrior weapons for Joan."
crusadersquest,3cks11,Czekraft,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:44:01 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the 2%/sec only activates when she uses her skill, so when she's under heavy fire she's not even going to last 3 seconds."
crusadersquest,3cks11,digilinx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:02:26 2015 UTC,"you're still missing the point. I'm not talking about the 2hp per second issue. The prevent 8 sources of physical damage is by far more important than the 2% hp/sec. and also the ability to get 2 defense slots on the SBW.  Just the 8 sources of physcial damage prevention, and being able to get 2 def slots on her weapon already make Joan's SBW far superior than anything she could use before.  On the other hand, Maria's SBW is lackluster, because it's not a massive improvement on what she had access to before. And there are much worse SBWs in that aspect."
crusadersquest,3cks11,Czekraft,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:10:45 2015 UTC,"I have her D/D sbw. Its great that she can get dmg red% and resistance, but her defense can't hold up to the last stages of FoS. 2%hp/sec is less than helpful, and could be improved. Like 5%/sec, since it's not going to take 20 seconds to kill a monster and not come out of it untouched."
crusadersquest,3cks11,digilinx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:36:27 2015 UTC,if you want to use Joan in FoS you should be putting armor on both slots instead of dam red and resistance.  there aren't many sources of magical damage in FoS

crusadersquest,3cks11,Hugs2o6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:17:56 2015 UTC,You need to switch Alex with Joan. They should all be at least +4 I've done when i had +2/3 but that was when naz yeo wasn't nerf. With archon you need to keep her of screen it'll keep Joan from getting 1 shotted. Use Bella or anut or sera which ever you prefer. As for thorinmew Korin needs to be +4 with anut or sera this team for fos10 is slow and steady. You want them topped off on hp. For both team timing of the goddess is critical. Really you could use a crap team but pretext timing will win
crusadersquest,3cks11,mayainverse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:10:57 2015 UTC,why joan isnt she way more squishy? how should i be timing my goddess on dragon? how does thorin work if you have drake with double stacked shields?
crusadersquest,3cks11,Hugs2o6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:45:05 2015 UTC,"Joan is softer but the extra sp is why. The idea is to kill before getting killed. Dragon use about 1 sec after dragon flies away to come back to strike is the main one you should be concern about, 0 armor probably deals 10k+  use an invincible team to 4-16 and practice, watch the animation and watch your timing. Not sure if drake doubke stacks, but even if it does you shouldn't really need it if the goddess are timed right. The thor damage does help speed it up, making your chances of possibly missing goddess."

crusadersquest,3cks11,FadedFromWhite,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"So I decided to buckle and drop a 10 contract purchase.  I came away with Lilith and Vivian and have no idea if I should be happy or not.  Are these particularly good heroes?  I doubt their up there with N.09 or Sneak, but I'm wondering if I should start looking into changing up my teams at all.  I've mainly been running Archon, Mew, Alex though I'm in the process of leveling a Joan to replace Alex.  To be honest, I'm not really sure how Lilith's passive works, it doesn't seem to make sense to me.  Can anyone explain it?  Also, for the Ancient Dungeons,  do shards you acquire on the 20th floor reset if you don't collect 5 by the time the current event ends?"
crusadersquest,3cks11,digilinx,2,Tue Jul 14 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"Lilith is super OP in Colo, needs Magic Storm. Not as good as Sneak, but better than N9. Runs best with 2 tanks, like Alex and Joan.  Her ability is that every 2nd block skill you use, regardless of chain length counts and a true 3 chain. So it only takes 3 blocks to get enough SP for Magic Storm. ( 2 - 1 - MS ) or  ( 1 - 1 - 1 - MS ). And she has the highest Attack in the game which makes most Colo matches over in 1 MS.  The Destiny Points/Shards don't reset and will be back the next time the dungeon comes back into rotation, they will reset if you get a legendary hero."

crusadersquest,3cks11,chrisisnatural,2,Tue Jul 14 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"They are both good, Lillth being one of the best actually. I believe at 6* every other block is a 3-chain. She can carry you pretty hard in PVC.  From my experience, yes the hearts you get on the 20th floor reset."

crusadersquest,3cks11,Czekraft,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"lol, not everyone has 2 sneaks, so that's a lot rarer than a mage nuke team. I use a magic damage version of that team. Mandy, Hikari, Roland. They both have ResPen, but Mandy's 1 block passive lowers resistance by 50%, so you could get about 100% magic penetration"
crusadersquest,3cks11,Floreau,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:42:29 2015 UTC,"In addition to lacking bursty 1chain mages (Lillith comes closest in terms of using 1chain spam, and she's definitely up there for Coliseum in terms of output and 'nuke' ability due to Magic Storm), there is also no magic equivalent of Susanoo's ranged Armor Penetration debuff (Mandy and Sentinel both only hit the frontline/one unit respectively; the rest of the Res Pen debuffs are locked into (transcended) skills (Phoenix Feather, Voice of the Spirit, that one Paladin skill nobody ever uses that reduces only a % of enemy Res, etc).  Of course, mages naturally have better range/hitboxes than gunners do and have access to Magic Storm or Mana Recycle for a team killing AoE or furthering their wide hitbox 3chains respectively. Really, the 'issue' likely stems from access to Magic Storm, which basically has no equal in terms of damage output in Coliseum given that you can hit the entire enemy party with a high damage + high neutral hit skill. MR for the 3chain leaders takes too much time/blocks to ever compete with the physical burst/nukes.  It's a design choice the game developers make. 'Because Magic Storm exists and some mages have ranged hitboxes, there will be no ranged Res Pen debuffer' or something like that. The logic is probably because it'd make Lillith/Mondrian and maybe even Alice (hey look, all of these are premiums) ""too strong"" in a game where Sneak and No.9 exist (also premiums)(all other 3chain mages that either require tMR's stun or the second 3chain to reach their kill potential are too slow to ever compete). As it is, physical units are easier to support than magical ones (who are basically forced into tank + other tank or healer) unless we're talking about one of the few magic support/chasers that rely on their 6* SBW to be truly effective (or are Nazrune, who seems to have disappeared off the face of the game post-nerf; perhaps we can ignore him since he no longer satisfies the 'truly effective' qualifier).  This of course, is purely from a damage perspective (which is ultimately the one that matters most at the end of the day). You can say that mages have utility like debuffs (slows enemy dps rate), but that statement would be made in a vacuum that ignores that gunners have utility too (knockback increases party dps, etc). We're also limiting discussion to Coliseum and the viable nuke teams.  There are only two mage units that could be called nukes, Lillith for Magic Storm (all able to be done/casted using only the first 5 blocks at Coliseum start) or Mondrian (who needs to have high enough Res Pen/HAP% to be able to OHKO the enemy team with his first 3chain (if not, then he's as slow as all the other mages), also only using the first 5 blocks at Coliseum start)."
crusadersquest,3cks11,lotusrunner,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:00:14 2015 UTC,"Physical teams have a much faster startup, one block and you're already doing damage, whilst mages such as Nazrune/Mondrian need a chain-3 to begin doing anything at all."

crusadersquest,3cks11,Escheiron,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:07:52 2015 UTC,R-0 is extremely good in this occasion. I suggest running her with a 3-chainer so that her passive activates which decreases the target's SP.  She can really delay the heals of the priest. Giving you more time to deal damage to the paladin

I rarely see her, abd usually when I do it is pretty meh, but i occasionally come across one that just blows crap up with some random insane damage. I've read the corrected passives list, and it just doesn't click for me."
crusadersquest,3cks11,Floreau,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:33:18 2015 UTC,"Rachel's passive is to get SP and a Att buff whenever an ally uses a 3chain or is healed. Whenever she's healed, she will gain SP (the cooldown only refers to the proc chance for her triple effect). Whenever an ally uses a 3chain, there's a chance for Rachel to instead gain triple the SP and triple the Att buff (pretty sure they don't stack, so the highest one overwrites the others, or refresh the timer if they're the same). All in all, it's a pretty lackluster passive, as the Att buffs only her weak chains (esp. when she's a chaser), while the SP gain is slow (but does cause her to ramp into her skill faster than other units).  Her 6* SBW will turn her next block after the chance proc (at 50% chance whenever ally 3chains) into a super sweeping bat attack that also heals the party. This turns her into a viable chaser (before, she only gained SP and some Att buff, now she actually has an attack to use that buff with other than a weak 1/2chain).  In scenarios where you have time to ramp up a bit (WB, PvE), you can use Shadow Mage on Rachel with her SBW. Each of her shadow clones can proc her super attack, leading to a constant stream of buffed high damage bats."

crusadersquest,3cks11,digilinx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:10:14 2015 UTC,"Alice - When she uses a 3 chain it summons a Spade solider, which goes out and attacks about 2 seconds of animation or so, a 1 and 2 chain summons a Diamond solider which just hits like once. But if the 1 chain hits while the 3 Chain is attacking, she summons a free 3 chain Spade solider, and if you manage to land another 1 chain while the free one is attacking you get another free one.. and so forth.. but as I said, Naz or Robin chasing would do better than Alice chasing herself. Also with Alice you need to time it well.  Cain's block attacks debuff, so he can stun on the 2nd block attack, or you can get 2 Cains and guarantee perma stuns. Also at 6* when ever you do a block attack there's a 65% chance he does a free 3 chain after the original attack"

I couldn't fathom how this was possible and just did a little napkin math. Fair warning, errors could and probably do exist.  So assuming no stored tickets from the previous week, in the first day you start with 3 tickets, and will naturally generate 12 tickets in 24 hours. Now onto the part I can't even believe people would do.  Popo farming: You can get popo 4 times every hour. Let us assume you have a 50% rate of getting a ticket (seems a little high but still). That's 2 more tickets every hour for a total of 48 tickets if you farm every hour of the entire day. That gives us a total of 63 tickets in a day with a 50% popo payout. With 100% win rate that gives you 315 wins.  There are people with nearly 500 wins after 24 hours.  HOW IN THE HECK DO PEOPLE DO THIS. I get tired just trying to blow through the 400+ meat I got from the most recent bunch of toast apologies."

crusadersquest,3cks11,JyakiGun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:49:10 2015 UTC,"It's not a knock on anyone. I'm just curious how they do it. I guess one way would be to what, maybe get to masters one week early in just to get tickets, and then just farm farm farm farm tickets so you can blast next week.  As you were both saying, I guess you have to almost have a ""one week on"" , ""one week off"" thing. One week stacking tickets, one week blasting tickets.  But seriously, if you score super high several weeks in a row, you almost can't do it without farming the crud out of popo right? Good lord that is some dedication. But its the perfect feedback loop. Tickets get you meat and meat gets you popo. This game is some pavlovian style stuff for certain. AND I CANT HELP BUT LOVE IT"

crusadersquest,3cks11,jaetheho,2,Mon Jul 13 20:43:31 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  neither PvE nor PvC  Melissa alone will not do enough damage, and when a 3-chain is procced, it is very unlikely it will heal all 3 heroes because only joan and alex would have taken damage. Plus, melissa will often ""mark"" the hero in the back, because the DPS is likely to have the least health, and you have no heroes that hit the backline.

Most runs have 2x bread or 1x bread/1x Weapon.  4* bread is worse than any of your chest drops, and 5* is only slightly better (but who would sell 5* bread)?  4* weapons are better than 2 of your chest drops, but pretty rare.  I think if you did more runs, it would decline -- you'd have a 3 chest with 2x bread or weapons.  I had desert 2-10 runs that were over 200 gpm w/o quests, but the average is only about 180 gpm.  The other thing is that desert and forest are completed on 70 meat or less.  Tundra is 150.  That's going to cost at least 1 gem if you don't want to wait, and Tundra is pretty long, with tougher waves and more of them.  Desert and forest are just easier and faster, IMO.  I strongly suspect that given enough data points, Tundra falls behind them on GPM as well."

But the probability of it being greater than 1-24 or 2-24 is non zero.

crusadersquest,3cik7z,sufijo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:31:32 2015 UTC,"Indeed we must! I've got a bamboo tablet and I currently work on a laptop, not the most ideal probably but it seems okay. I'm actually wondering if maybe my approach to the line art portion of things is all wrong because I definitely had gone over it with color afterwards but I think I'm  compensating for lack of digital coloring know how with this final product.  I typically start with a large canvas size like 1600x1000+ and 300 ppi. The brush settings are usually shape dynamics, 100% hardness, 1% spacing and around 4-6 for the actual size. I would like for the lines to get thicker and taper off as I lighten the pressure but this seems hard to set up simultaneously with any kind of control over how light/dark the lines will be.  This is all photoshop BTW. I kind of forgot all about neater lines as I got closer to a finished point in my brain. To some extent I pass it off as a style but its definitely not how I always want to draw things. I typically have to redraw alot because the initial strokes are not going where I'd like. It makes getting neat and curvy lines frustrating for me =("

crusadersquest,3ckbkn,Nincampoo,6,Wed Jul 8 16:06:45 2015 UTC,Yeo is more popular for her block making abilities... Woompa can not print blocks like a boss....
crusadersquest,3ckbkn,arichone,3,Wed Jul 8 16:09:31 2015 UTC,Block generation.  Every hero that is able to produce blocks outside of the normal generation are extremely popular because they are the true sustain heroes.  Yeo/Mew/Roland/Rochefort feel broken in PvE because of this.  Mages that can effectively use MR too.
crusadersquest,3ckbkn,Phairo,3,Wed Jul 8 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"block generation. the same reason Mew is more popular. Not because, well, cats, but also her ability for block acceleration. The same reason the old Nurspy isn't popular, too. Totem overtime heals and range aren't so reliable."
crusadersquest,3ckbkn,liberalfamilia,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yeo was coveted for her ability to crank out insane blocks. With the recent nerf to her though, her useability has gone down by quite a bit.   Woompa also has a weaker heal on his blocks. They are used more for buffing and the healing is more secondary. Yeo has a very strong burst heal that heals everyone, while Woompa's is a heal over time that only heals those nearby.    I personally prefer Woompa when I don't have to constantly heal, or when I'm using a tankier team, since he has more flexibility. His 2 block and 3 blocks are both useful. Need more def? Drop a 2 block. Need more damage? Drop a 3 chain. Want both? Why not drop em both!  Personally I like Woompa's sprite more than Yeo. I love the expressions on his face xD"
crusadersquest,3ckbkn,gentlegreengiant,0,Wed Jul 8 16:43:34 2015 UTC,"With respect to Healing,  - Yeo heals 272% HA per 3-Chain (Burst Heal) - Woompa heals up to 107.5% to 140% buffed (4 times = 560% HA)   According to Hodgeskin's data (amazing analysis, I thought Hodgeskin is working on his pHD thesis for CQ)  Woompa seems to out heal Yeo, though his takes time..."
crusadersquest,3ckbkn,Skaitavia,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:53:53 2015 UTC,"Healing wise not only does Woompa require more time, your heroes can either push out of the range of healing, or get pushed out of it, resulting in no heals at all. Requiring more time is the difference between a dead or alive hero, especially in end-game content like FoS, AWB, and Tundra hard.  The main reason Yeo is more popular is because she does more support than Woompa via block generation. Generating more blocks for your other two heroes is definitely more useful than the attack buff Woompa gives.  The evasion Yeo's SBW gives is just icing on the cake."
crusadersquest,3ckbkn,gentlegreengiant,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:56:48 2015 UTC,The evasion buff on her SBW only applies to the leader she generates a block for right? I was never really clear on it...
crusadersquest,3ckbkn,Skaitavia,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, only for the Ally that the block is generated.  Since she cannot generate blocks for herself, means she will not get the evasion buff."
crusadersquest,3ckbkn,panix187,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"Her evasion buff gives evasion to the heroes that got a block generated, so with Yeo's recent fix, she no longer generates a block for herself, meaning technically she should not gain any evasion."

crusadersquest,3ckbkn,XKaramaX,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"i use a wompa and 2x dart team for fos. i love wompa. but i think wompa is only good for buffing some heroes, like hikari/no9/archon etc. But i still love him (only gangster male healer, i like his style like Totem Maokai from league of legends). He does proc enough Dart passives for me. The reason why so many ppl still play more yeo is for spamming new bocks. she is still A+ (or maybe A) for generating new blocks."

crusadersquest,3ckbkn,masta518,-1,Wed Jul 8 16:38:37 2015 UTC,I mean seriously folks. Does Yeo's waifulness not play a part on her bigger popularity over Woompa?  Woompa is just so much more dependable...every block is 100% buff for everyone vs. Yeo's 65% chance on only 2 characters.  And the Yeo's blocks flood so much till the Heros are unable to complete their attacks before mashing the next chain (the hero's attack animation duration is restricting the abundance of blocks from being used effectively especially for super long animation guys like Kriem and Mondeok).

Just kidding."" This is a reference to a Fergus in Vindictus, who will sometimes jokingly say ""Oops, my hand slipped!"". This, in of itself, is a reference to the original Ferghus in Mabinogi: Fantasy Life. Fergus is notorious for his 90% repair rates for weapons in Mabinogi, known by the game's community and even the dev's as the Weapon Breaker. 90% may seem like alot, but overall it usually ends up damaging your weapon more than fixing it. On the bright side, he's also the most inexpensive blacksmith in the game, so..

Just give it a try :)   It was created a while back by Icyfenix but should still work fine"
crusadersquest,3ci8vt,RedFalchion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:19:45 2015 UTC,1) You would be better getting a Devil Hunter (which can get up to 402 ArP from one slot) with double damage (HA is better for Dart) . I think roughly 40% crit chance is the base amount where CD becomes comparable/better than HA. So if below 40% just get HA. 500 ArP is kinda overkill if you can get a better roll on a DH  2) No you cannot.  3) Read somewhere that Nurspy only revives someone that dies WHILE they are being healed by her. IE it doesnt just revive someone. But if their health goes below 0 while her needle is up she will bring them back to life. I dont have 6* nurspy or SBW to test but someone else?

crusadersquest,3cfl9e,SartorialistRage,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:31:46 2015 UTC,"Out of all the rng games I've played I think Hearthstone has dealt with this issue the best.  they allow you to Disenchant cards for 'dust' and then use dust to craft any card you are missing. I've played other games that had a similar concept, but the ratios were done the best in Hearthstone. I know blizzard is rich and they have heaps resources at their disposal. But I'm not comparing the companies, just this mechanism.  Similarly, CQ could implement something like that where you can retire your heroes get some 'dust', and then spend dust + maybe 10~20 gems and turn it into any specific 4* master hero.  Just balance how much dust the heroes give, and the dust it costs to make a hero, and you will have a balancing mechanism in the game.  the cons are as skaitavia has mentioned, might cost them revenue ( but it also might make them more, because if the game is more 'fair' less people might stop playing or more people might spend )  but there are heaps of pros, such as   giving the game a form of balance, in that if anything is OP people can get it themselves or the hard counter easier, rather than rely on rng and get upset when it doesn't happen. giving the players a progress bar to work towards, where they can directly relate the amount of time/effort they spend into progress towards a specific hero they are after. reducing the bad feeling after dismissing a dupe chai, vane, cain etc... for the nth time and not getting anything for it ( most end gamers have more honor than they will ever need )"
crusadersquest,3cfl9e,Fuzaki,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:54:48 2015 UTC,"I love everything you said here. It all makes sense and seems absolutely doable.
