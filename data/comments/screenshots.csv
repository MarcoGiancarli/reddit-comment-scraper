These notable dead people often died ahead of their time (some of them are among the celebrities who died in 2013) while others passed from natural causes. Regardless of the cause and timing, these are famous people who died while they still had very much to contribute to the world.   The list has now degenerated to almost all Moots in the top 10 - although Osama and Hitler do make it."
