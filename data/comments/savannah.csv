Winter time might even be better, as a lot of students may be occupying those positions during the summer. Sorry for not giving you concrete leads, but I encourage you to do searches for job listings in the Savannah area, and don't be afraid to call around to some of the larger, popular places such as The Pirate's House and others."

Church is a good choice since you get to meet people in a social setting when they are on their better behavior.  At 40+ the social options are different than a young guy in his 20's.   Going to bars at that age to meet people is too sad.  Go home and worship Thor if that is your thing, but you can still use church to meet people in your community."

For historic stuff there is the Savannah River Museum, Fort Jackson, Fort Pulaski, and many many others.  Tybee has a lighthouse and a WW2 practice battlement when they were prepping for the invasion of Normandy.  Forsyth park is awesome to chill in as well.  Many good restaurants just stay away from the tourist trap ones.  If you are going to drink stay above River Street the bars down there are bunk as hell.  Congress St. is a much better option.

Some of the clubs in South Carolina will expect you to bring your own alcohol.   It's definitely worth it for you to take the guys carousing downtown. You can hit up a dozen bars in a couple blocks, you'll get plenty of (free, drunken) female attention, and if you don't like the atmosphere, you can always grab a go cup and bring your drink along as you walk to the next bar.

Try the Bar Bar and move on down to Bay Street. There's some big-ish club (cant remember what it is/used to be called) on the north side of Bay and Barnard (I think). Moving on down Bay Street (to the East), on the north side you can hit Savannah Blues, and another large-ish club (used to be Hip Huggers?), Churchill's, and it keeps going on and on.

savannah,3dba0b,dragonfliesloveme,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:51:01 2015 UTC,"I found my current apartment by driving through the neighborhood and noticing a for-rent sign via a realty company (Lanier Realty, to be exact). I know you can't do that, but I'd just like to pass on the advice to look at individual local realtors' websites, versus browsing Craigslist ads. In my experience, the housing ads on Craigslist will either be for really shady apartment complexes or super expensive downtown houses... there's no in between!). Good luck with your move across the country (I had to do the same)!"
savannah,3dba0b,8onn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:31:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation, I'll check them out! (Also, do you have any good suggestions from your own experience on making the move more bearable? We're currently looking at the Whatever Fits In The Car option.)"

Luckily, I'm a minimalist so it wasn't heartbreaking to part with 98% of my belongings, haha."
savannah,3dba0b,milama,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:37:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so flippant if I were you if someone tells you that an area is being gentrified. There are lots of rough areas in Savannah.   I used to live in midtown, and some of the things off the top of my head:  I got used to the sound of gunfire. Sometimes, we wound even hear bullets flying through the leaves of the trees while sitting out back. We were always having to deal with a string of undesirables who were on foot, going somewhere in the area for drugs.  Had my window smashed in a car break-in.  Had my bicycle stolen from inside my gated, enclosed backyard. Saw a guy who was running from the cops plow right through the back yard. Witnessed three guys breaking into my neighbors house in the middle of the day. Called the authorities on some people down the block who were abusing their dog and training it for fighting.   I kept to myself and did not feel threat of bodily harm, but being around those kinds of things does not make you feel safe, nor give you the warm fuzzies about human beings.   It's things like this that you were told an area is being gentrified, to let you know that you will hopefully not have to deal with things like that.   Edit:  we lived next door to a SCAD teacher, and our neighbors on the other side were SCAD students.  We weren't off deep in the ghetto.  Our street was on the bus line, and our street/area was not considered that bad!"
savannah,3dba0b,hrtattx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:31:47 2015 UTC,"""Gentrified"" is a term that makes me leery because I'm in the SF Bay area, and that's essentially become a code word for ""Filled with beigelords, killed off the local color, drove up the rent to elite-level only"" -- around here, it's only appealing to people who are making six figures (and almost exclusively white).

The food isn't supposed to be any better than mediocre, the service is nothing to write home about, etc.  I haven't been personally.  I'd highly recommend Mrs. Wilkes' boarding house over Paula Deen's restaurant. I think it's around $16-18 per person, and you are seated family-style in groups of 12.  They load the tables up with every southern side dish you can imagine, fried chicken, desserts, everything.  Everybody eats until they are stuffed beyond imagine.  They bring out new dishes of food when any of the plates runs low."

Hate her all you want, she's a terrific draw for Savannah that translates into millions of tourism dollars every year.  Here's how the locals justify going to their friends:  Step 1:  Avoid The Lady and Sons until you have friends/family from out of town.  A mom or aunt will ask about it and you can play it off as ""wellllll  I hear the locals don't care for it...  But since you're coming all the way here, I know that's on your list of things you want to experience...""  Step 2:  Call and make your reservations.  If you've not seen the line of tourists waiting, trust me, you your out-of-town guest will be glad you did...  Step 3: Show up hungry and eat like you're trying to put her out of business (And leave room for some gooey butter cake)  Step 4: Let your guest browse the merchandise section on your way out while you check-in on Facebook /r/Savannah to complain to all your friends fellow redditors about how you enjoyed had to endure eating at Lady and Sons because you your out-of-town guest just had to go...  I've eaten there twice.  Once at the current location, the other about 10 years ago when it was a little ways down Congress St.  Both times the food was excellent and I left absolutely stuffed.  I've also dined at Mrs. Wilkes, and wouldn't hesitate to take friends/family there.  It's a long wait, but they have their system worked out well.  And oh yeah, A U.S. President had lunch there about five years ago!  Regardless of your politics, that's a big deal."
savannah,3conrc,antimojo,7,Fri Jul 10 14:41:58 2015 UTC,Ms. Wilkes is the best buffet in Savannah. They are only open during lunch and make sure to get their a tad early. Paula Deans was alright and is worth going to to say you've been but I doubt you will leave satisfied.

It was pretty good, but I'm a transplant from New York, so I'm no authority on southern food.   HOWEVER, Mrs. Wilke's is better, more authentic, and nobody will give you a dirty look for going there. They are only open Monday through Friday from 11-2 and you WILL wait in line outside. Arrive early. I wouldn't call it a buffet, either. It's family style all-you-can-eat. The dishes are on the table when you walk in. You'll sit with people you don't know. It's an experience, and the food is amazing."

savannah,3cnn15,xKronicL,3,Thu Jul 9 14:37:37 2015 UTC,I plan on moving to Washington from Savannah sometime soon...Kind of curious what you didn't like because you've got me scared now :l
savannah,3cnn15,dox1842,3,Thu Jul 9 15:49:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, didn't expect to wake up to 10 replies so soon. Just want to say thanks to everyone so far. I might not have time to reply directly right now, but want to acknowledge you all. Thanks again.  To address a few points--  Boeing Charleston-- When it was first announced that Boeing was acquiring and expanding on Vought in Charleston, I leaped at the chance to get down there. I just have one problem. I'm in a union. Not by choice, mind you. Washington is not a RTW state. Boeing has made it an unofficial policy to not transfer union members to Charleston because it is felt that we would go in as some kind of ""sleeper agents"" for trying to organize the site. No matter how much I try to express that unions be damned, I just want to get closer to home, it falls on deaf ears.  BMW & Volvo -- Might be worth looking into. My particular skillset is in Composites R&D and manufacturing. I'm not a degreed engineer or anything, but I do have formal training and a certificate from Oregon Tech in composites engineering technology. Was a 4.0 student, and was taught by one of Boeing's senior composites Technical Fellows. Composites are becoming pretty standard in the automotive industry so again, could be worth a shot.  Tailoring Resume -- Boeing is similar, and that might have been the reason for the rejection letters. They were sent within 24 hours of my submission, so it could be that I was chucked out by a computer system. Do any of you know if it's possible to resubmit to a job that you've been automatically rejected from with changes to one's resume?  Why I want to get out of Washington -- Social/Culture climate, primarily. I'm a southern conservative. Not a racist hick or anything like that. Just a bit more into personal responsibility, self motivation, believe in God, etc. I like how in the south, you could be walking down a sidewalk, pass a person coming the opposite direction, greet them with a ""how's it going?"" and a smile, and might end up having a conversation for 10 minutes about absolutely nothing and walk away feeling better than you were before. Similar interactions here are met with either being completely ignored, suspicion, or downright rudeness. Honestly, for those wanting to come up here, I'd do some Googling of the social climate of the Puget Sound, and look up specifically a phenomenon known as the ""Seattle Freeze"". Another interesting (and amusing for us transplants here) would be checking out various blogs under the search terms ""Seattle sucks"" or ""I hate Seattle"". If you're young, liberal, looking to get into the tech sector, and don't care much for building a close social circle you might like it here. Otherwise... well, it's pretty for 2-3 months out of the year, and the geography is gorgeous, but that's about it. And then there's the rain. 8-9 months of constant overcast and drizzle. Believe me, I could write a book, so I'll stop here.  Thanks again, everyone, and keep 'em coming. Sounds like persistence is key.

savannah,3cnn15,ryancunderwood,2,Thu Jul 9 18:19:15 2015 UTC,Thats really unfortunate about Boeings union policy. I might be wrong on this but didnt the site in south carolina vote to remain non-union. If they did whats done is done and it wouldnt matter you moving over there would it??
savannah,3cnn15,ryancunderwood,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:12:15 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter, unfortunately. They don't want anyone they perceive to be pro-union, regardless of what the reality is-- namely that I'm not not interested in getting into that mess down there. I'm unfortunately lumped into the stereotype purely by involuntary association. This was essentially told to me in candid conversations with people who would know."
savannah,3cnn15,dox1842,2,Thu Jul 9 20:26:56 2015 UTC,In my time there I heard alot of talk about testing composites and future planes would use a whole lot more. So you might have a pretty good shot at getting in...
savannah,3cnn15,ryancunderwood,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"Composites are definitely the wave of the future for aerospace, and I'm surprised I haven't seen a lot of postings for jobs at Gulfstream that focuses on it. I had to do a product review for class about a non-Boeing application of composites in aerospace, and picked the Bombardier Learjet 85 for its monococque composite shell fuselage with integrated stiffening details. I don't recall ever seeing anything featured in trade publications about Gulfstream products using similar applications, but it could be that they're keeping internal development projects really close to the chest. Goodness knows we have all kinds of stuff going on at Boeing that I don't know about, and I'm sure it's the same with our chief rival, Airbus."
savannah,3cnn15,okiedokie_,4,Fri Jul 10 09:03:05 2015 UTC,"Unless you have a specialized skill like electrical then you most likely have to go through a staffing agency such as Kelly services or aerotech. Most people in my hired group were hired through these agencies. I also had to take a semester long course at savannah tech to even be considered, but I would think since you already have experience then this wouldn't apply to you.  I worked for Gulfstream for around three months and did not enjoy it. I found there to be no direction or real organized hands on training for a new hire. It may have just been my team (my team leaders/managers were not supportive and very unapproachable). You are always being watched like a hawk.  I was hired in when they were doing some expansion and doing mass hirings. They may have wrapped that up and scaled back hiring by now. I have also heard they have cut back starting pay for new hires. I was hired in at a little over $14 (would be $16 if a direct hire or if/when they decide to make you an actual employee). Two people left my current work to work there and they were starting at $11.32 and will be $13.32 when they become and actual employee. That is also IF they ever make you a full employee. They say after 90 days you are eligible and I know several people that have been there a lot longer and still havnt received that status or were let go after a couple years for no reason and never became a full employee. They can do that as you are a contractor and they simply terminate your contract. Honestly I would stay where you are at or jump on that Lockheed job. Also did you know Boeing has a facility in Charleston as does BMW and soon Volvo? You could also always look at the numerous Gulfstream suppliers around town..machine shops and finishers. Some places pay a lot better and have a much more relaxed environment. I work for a Gulfstream supplier now and I like it a whole lot better."
savannah,3cnn15,dragonfliesloveme,3,Thu Jul 9 13:24:06 2015 UTC,So from what I understand you worked at gulfstream through a contractor?? How often do they let people go without reason??

I don't have figures on exact numbers, I know two people one of which worked there for a couple years. Somewhere in the mess of paperwork they give you fill out it pretty much says that this contract can be terminated at anytime."

My contract agency said about half of contractors at Gulfstream go direct, and that number also includes all the folk who didn't attempt to go direct. We are always looking for good talent.

It was a fun day trip, although she almost killed me with all of the walking  up and down stairs on the USS Yorktown.

I drove through the area on my way to Aiken and I don't get the impression they like people there who don't work there and whatnot. There are signs all along the road telling you not to stop or leave the roadway, with an implied, ""or else"". My cousin tells stories about stopping along that road once because he needed to change his kid's diaper (according to him and his wife it was literally nauseating, so a good excuse it would seem). He stopped to change the kid's diaper and was, in about a minute, swarmed by site police, including a helicopter overhead. They stayed while he changed the diaper and hurried them along. Of course, my cousin and his wife could be full of it, but I don't want to test their story for accuracy myself :P  I could be wrong though. Maybe it's more inviting than it seems."

Cant speak about schools as I have no Kids.  Port Wentworth is a great in-between for me. Its 25 mins from downtown savannah and 5 mins from Rincon/Groceries/Lowes..Etc  I pay 64.99/mo for Comcast. I get some very few basic TV channels and somewhere around 50/Down 10/up.   When downloading through steam I actually get around 12MB/S (quite good imo) - rarely many issues with service. Occasionally its Comcast. As for as options: its the only thing here, unless you want 2MB DSL.  Also, feel free to PM me for more Port Wentworth Info :D"

savannah,3brbos,lawjr3,-2,Wed Jul 1 18:07:18 2015 UTC,I know your question wasn't specifically for me...but when purchasing a house I looked at port Wentworth. I was really excited about one neighborhood which I later found out the builders went bankrupt and the development would never be finished. Newport is full of sex offenders. Lakeshore is decent but in both Newport and lakeshore I found that the homes and neighborhoods just weren't being maintained. I don't know of they are still building out there and you could get a new home. But alot of the homes were being rented. I used to have friends out there and stayed over a couple nights in each lakeshore and Newport. Awake practically all night from groups of kids running around being obnoxious in the middle of the night. Or kids waiting at bus stops yelling and screaming. I don't necessarily blame the kids but the quality of the homes being built. That is my honest opinion. I'd say the one neighborhood I believe it was called rice hope was the only decent area but only if they have started up construction again to finish it.
savannah,3brbos,ryancunderwood,-6,Wed Jul 1 17:22:54 2015 UTC,All the sex offenders live in Newport.

Despite some sweltering heat, it was a good time, as Greg takes you around to a handful of bars (five or six, if I remember correctly), where you have time to get a drink or use the restroom before meeting up with him outside, where he'll tell a story about that particular location.

savannah,3b2xzs,Muchachi,3,Thu Jun 25 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"Get on craigslist and start looking for vacation rentals (Vacation Rentals by Owner / VRBO). If anything level with Forsyth Park or north of it is available, you should take it."
savannah,3b2xzs,newmannewaccount,3,Fri Jun 26 03:27:35 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, book now. The earlier the better. It will be crowded. St. Patrick's Day is on a Thursday that year, so the whole weekend following will be pretty big, but also the week leading up to it. If you stay Tues or Wed through the weekend, people will start leaving and you'll get a little bit of time to see the city while it isn't so crowded. Don't expect to sight-see during the festivities. Also, if you can take in historic details on St. Patrick's Day, you're doing it wrong. Don't stress about the wristbands. They are easy to get and not monitored all that much. Parking will be a bitch, so make sure the hotel/airbnb/vacayrental is in walking distance from downtown. I would reccomend looking for a place between Bay Street and Liberty Street, as that will get you close to everything. If you book closer to Forsyth and don't walk regularly, that is going to seem like a trek. If you do a lot of walking for transportation though, it won't be bad. Also, all taxis are free on St. Patrick's Day.   Hope this helps and let me know if you have any more questions. It is a great time!"

Perhaps take a romantic horse drawn carriage ride. Also, if you need transportation around town, Uber just launched here in savannah so that is another option to the taxis and pedicabs.

See also The Grey, recently recognized as high on some national list.  Mrs Wilkes on Jones for family style—not different cuisine, but a different setting. The line moves fast.  I understand that Treylor Park on Bay offers unusual combinations of usual fare.  Chromatic Dragon has unusual names for pub grub and they bring board/card games to your table."

It's hot pot so they bring you a pot for the burners on your table and then plates of raw veggies, your choice of noodles, and meats/tofu/seafood and you cook it at the table. The bubble tea was really great too. I highly recommend it."
savannah,3an9lb,nsd3,3,Sun Jun 21 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"My name is Steve Sherman, Membership Director for Freedom Boat Club Savannah and Hilton Head Island. I have been with them for over 10 years since we opened the Savannah location. As a former boat owner I can say that there is no better way to go boating than with FBC. As I surf the net I constantly see where people attempt to explain what we do, how we do it, costs, etc. Most of the time this info is very inaccurate. That said, let me see if I can help to dispel some myths and inaccuracies with facts.  We offer:  -Ability to boat 7 Days a week. -A fleet of 38 boats in the area (22 in Savannah, 16 in Hilton Head) with unlimited access (Over $1 million dollars of rotating inventory). -Full day reservations. Pick up in the morning…bring back in the evening (Or overnight usage if you like). -We rotate our fleet every 3 years. Always on new or like new boats! -Ability to make up to 4 consecutive reservations (allowing you the opportunity to keep boats overnight at a dock or marina), and you can make reservations as far out as 6 months in advance. -You can take a Savannah or Hilton Head boat anywhere in GA and SC waters. -You can boat in the ocean (up to 25 miles offshore as the crow flies from the shoreline). -You can boat 4 times, per location, per year at all other (87 current) locations. -We provide you with comprehensive training conducted by a trained Captain. -Sea Tow is included on every boat. -All boats come fully equipped with full color GPS, depth finder, chart plotter, ship to shore radio, and everything that is required by law. -You are named 3rd party insured for up to $2 Million dollars in personal liability on our insurance, and have a $2,500 deductible with any damage occurrence. -You can exit our club at any time with a 60 day notice in writing and you are no longer obligated to paying dues. -You receive a 2 month dues credit for any member you refer who joins our club.  If you are truly comparing apples to apples with my club, you would need to compare us to the average boat purchase of a $40k new boat. That said, it is easy to justify the one-time only initiation fee that we charge when you understand boat depreciation...boats lose approx 20-25% of their value in their first year...meaning, YOU JUST LOST in depreciation what we charge only one time to join my club. This is not rocket science. It is fact...sadly.  We run promotions periodically with supply and demand and around certain holidays. We are currently in promotion.  Our Current Promotion:  Weekday Only, year round membership: This reflects the discount of $500 and is only valid until 7/4/15.  One time Initiation Fee Only: $4,499. After that, dues are only $229/mo.  *1 Free Month included, and FREE reimbursement for USPS course.  7 Day, Year round Membership: This reflects the discount of $500 and is only valid until 7/4/15. One time Initiation Fee Only: $5,999. After that, dues are only $249/mo.  *1 Free Month included, and FREE reimbursement for USPS course.  For easy cash flow, we can also offer you a split initiation fee payment option that allows you to only pay only half at signing and the balance 60 days later interest free.  I would love for you to schedule a club tour so that you can see for yourself what this club is all about. I am available Sunrise to Sunset 6 days a week by appt only. I am off on Sundays. Feel free to call me on my cell at 912-312-1281 anytime.  Sincerely, Steve Sherman :) Freedom Boat Club"

savannah,3an9lb,horsenbuggy,2,Fri Jun 26 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"Check craigslist to see if someone has an older membership they can sell. I don't know if that's possible with this club but I have seen it with a boat club my cousin belongs to in Florida. Basically, monthly rates go up for new members all the time but you are locked in at whatever price you bought for. So someone who bought a membership 10 years ago is paying a fraction of what you'd be charged today. This only works if memberships are transferable.  Also, the one my cousin belongs to has at least two levels of membership. The cheaper option limits him to smaller boats. The more expensive option let's him use any boat in the fleet."
savannah,3an9lb,joewest3,2,Mon Jun 22 05:55:57 2015 UTC,"It may not do you much good now ... but, they will often run a discount on the initial membership fee around the time of the Savannah Boat Show (March).  I was considering FBC (and didn't have the experience you do) ... but, couldn't get past the initial membership fee and the ""pay-back"" period.  I ended up buying a small, used Grady White.  Absolutely love it."
savannah,3an9lb,gatowman,2,Mon Jun 22 16:08:57 2015 UTC,So is it like a boat timeshare or something?
savannah,3an9lb,hail_southern,2,Mon Jun 22 02:53:45 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you pay monthly membership fees and they have a fleet of boats you can choose from to take out when you want.
savannah,3an9lb,idratherbefishing,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:36:26 2015 UTC,Kind of. U/prescribedburn explains it pretty well above from what I know.
savannah,3an9lb,ssherman1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:31:13 2015 UTC,"You could just call them or stop by Morningstar marina in Thunderbolt. The only drawback I have seen is that you never get your initial membership back and I think it is pretty expensive. So if you don't like it, that sucks. Other than that, I think it would be pretty cool, especially if you travel, I think they have other marinas in the network."
savannah,3amsjn,Watchmesink,6,Sun Jun 21 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend Keller's! I bought a car from them 2 years ago. I was in the situation of looking but not urgently needing a car, wanting to find the right fit etc etc.  All the other dealers I visited pushed so hard to get me to walk away with a new car that same day.. Not what I wanted at all! (Especially new river auto mall.... Don't go there.) Ask for Jeff, I don't know if he still works at Keller's but he was awesome. He knew what I was looking for in a car, would call me as soon as they finished an auction, before the cars even came off the truck, to let me know if there was anything I might be interested in. He wanted to find me the right car, and want pushing me to get something I didn't really want.  If it matters, I paid cash, didn't finance, so I don't know about down payments etc."

savannah,3amsjn,gatowman,2,Mon Jun 22 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"CarMax is usually pretty good. I've never worked with the one in town but its a national chain and they usually have fair prices and can bring cars in from other locations if they don't have what you want. I think they're closer to a traditional car dealer, just without the new car lot so don't expect Buy Here / Pay Here (BHPH) type ability to work with a low credit score or income.  The two BHPH dealers in town I've heard the most positives about are Keller's off 17 near 204 and JD Byrider off Victory. I wouldn't suggest BHPH lots in general though. Their loans are usually bordering usury and they prey on desperate folks. Definitely avoid DriveTime, they market themselves as the next CarMax but they stock miled up cars ready to sputter out any day and then charge an arm and a leg for them.  I'd stick to the classifieds or craigslist. If you're not in a huge rush you can find some gems and never have to take out a loan at all."

savannah,3amsjn,mrspoole,3,Mon Jun 22 00:18:15 2015 UTC,"Just be careful with DriveTime. They have extremely aggressive, borderline predatory repo policies.

Then they made him come up will all kinds of asinine fees to get it back AND jacked up his payment and interest rate."

savannah,3a0jr4,jpoRS,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"Collegiate ball was much more team oriented. I grew up as a person with my college team and owe everything I've received to that squad. I'm not afraid to admit I was a little punk my freshman year but learned how to be a mature adult from the hierarchy that was the culture of my baseball team.   Also, the results here are a lot less emphasized than in college ball. The simple reason being that there are more games during a season in milb than in college and there were more rivalry games at school."

savannah,39xxb1,CargoCulture,4,Mon Jun 15 18:21:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't go to SCDS so feel free to throw my opinion out the window. But I did go to a few of the other private schools so I came into contact with SCDS occasionally, mostly with sports. Their facilities are great. They have amazing speakers come through for further enrichment. The only downside was the extreme ""I'm better than you attitude"" most students seemed to exude. However, that probably has more to do with parents than anything else."
savannah,39xxb1,1BlueWahoo,6,Mon Jun 15 19:39:06 2015 UTC,"This. I went to another private school in town. Whereas SCDS was always our nemesis in sports, I have to respect the school. I had friends that went there. Their curriculum is great, and it's not an easy-peasy, walk-in-the-park school. There's no ""pass Johnny because he's Mr. Smith's son"" stuff going on over there from what I understand. The students are held to a very high standard of learning, and what they learn is difficult. Most people I know that went there were way more prepared for college than the kids I went to school with."
savannah,39xxb1,TheAlcoholocaust,3,Mon Jun 15 20:33:50 2015 UTC,Everything you've said is exactly what I feel makes a great school.  A great school makes you really earn your grades.
savannah,39xxb1,gatowman,4,Tue Jun 16 00:57:19 2015 UTC,"Well put.  It's pretty hard to argue that Country Day isn't the best school in the area, academically speaking. But socially and culturally, there's a lot of elitism associated with SCDS. Some of it is of the fairly benign ""school pride"" variety, but there's also a lot of bullying and social ostracism that goes on. I suspect that this has something to do with the fact that the SCDS students on the higher end of the social ladder tend to realize just how high up on that ladder they and their families really are, but really I'm just speculating at this point.  So, basically if I had a school age child in Chatham County and my only concern was giving them access to the best academic resources through middle and high school, I would send them to SCDS without hesitation. However, I personally am of the opinion that there is value in having a child grow up in a diverse environment, meeting and learning with and from other children with different backgrounds, etc., and I'd be worried about whether they could really get that sort of life experience at SCDS."
savannah,39xxb1,TheDigitalRuler,3,Mon Jun 15 20:58:14 2015 UTC,"I went to a high-end private school for 8th grade and I can confirm that elitism does exist even at the middle school grade.  I don't know what SCDS charges per year, but this one cost $10K a year and you still had to buy uniforms, books, and food.  Boarding was an option too, and that ran an additional $17K.  Most who were boarded were kids of laywers, politicians, and surgeons who lives 100+ miles away.  About two dozen were from other countries with the most coming from Japan and we had one who was the son of a Sheikh.    Anyhow, the school taught and challenged me more in one semester than the public schools did in three years.  If your child can not only put up with the hard work it takes to get through a challenging school and deal with the bullying BS that comes with it, do it.  They will be better off."
savannah,39xxb1,gatowman,3,Tue Jun 16 01:03:49 2015 UTC,"I went there for lower to middle school and a different private school for high school but I kept in touch with my friends throughout.   The academics do a really excellent job for preparing you for higher education. Challenging but teachers are willing to help. There is a lot more freedom at this school and students learn to manage time I.e. using free periods wisely.  Socially... It's a nightmare. And I know this is how it is at every other private school but my god the elitism and the ""my daddy makes more money than your daddy"" pissing contests are unbearable.   Sports are pretty sub par and that's the reason I left.   Bottom line: if your child is academically oriented and also very secure with him/herself then scds will be perfect for them. But out of all of the options for private school Scds is probably the best. If you want more information feel free to pm me or if you want to know about the other school I went to.  Good luck!!!"
savannah,39xxb1,Urethra_Xtreem,4,Mon Jun 15 23:40:03 2015 UTC,"22m here. Went to Savannah country day. There were some great things with this school, and some other aspects when I went there. I went from pre-k to tenth grade, where the friends I had made from pre-k and on turned on me for a popular person, and I was bullied enough to leave. My car would be keyed, kids would spit where I walked (all serious) and I personally would look elsewhere for a school. There are some great people who have come out of that school, and a lot of people who would contradict what I just said with a great experience. What kept me at SCD was the music department. I am sorry to hear that they have removed some of the key staff and that the quality has changed in the liberal arts department.  My saving grace was St Andrews school. The tuition is half, the people are friendly, and I am now running a small business with a friend I graduated with from that school. Imagine coming into a school of 40-50 kids a year, who went to school together since pre-k, and trying to make friends? It happened there. Good school. Keep us updated."
savannah,39xxb1,glockazine,2,Tue Jun 16 15:15:25 2015 UTC,I just moved from Savannah after my junior year and leaving the St. Andrews environment and education has been the hardest part for me.
savannah,39xxb1,social_cactus,2,Tue Jun 16 20:20:44 2015 UTC,Is St Andrews secular? That's an important consideration.
savannah,39xxb1,glockazine,2,Thu Jun 18 14:00:46 2015 UTC,St Andrews is highly tolerable of all beliefs. They do have a prayer to God when there is a special service. But I don't think there is a bible class or anything like that
savannah,39xxb1,social_cactus,2,Thu Jun 18 17:38:57 2015 UTC,St. Andrews is not affiliated with a church or religion of any sorts. There isn't a bible study class and the only prayer is before all-school assembly along with the pledge of allegiance.
savannah,39xxb1,gallivantrafter,3,Thu Jun 18 23:14:48 2015 UTC,Look into Savannah Honor Academy. New school. Super small. Have heard nothing but great things about it.
savannah,39xxb1,gallivantrafter,2,Tue Jun 16 03:14:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's one of our options but there's no pre-K program, so if anything it goes into our back pocket as a K+ school."
savannah,39xxb1,glockazine,2,Tue Jun 16 15:23:33 2015 UTC,The JEA has a pre-K on the first floor of the community center. It is a separate program from the school.

That concerns me quite a bit.   When does the social darwinism really start to become a factor? Middle school? High school?   I'm thinking long-term here so who knows, things might be different in 10-15 years when my son is hitting high school, but I'd like to get my ducks in a row now."
savannah,39xxb1,crazynormal,3,Tue Jun 16 15:31:51 2015 UTC,"as I am quite biased on this topic, my kid would never go to SCD. Nor would they go to a public school in this county, except for savannah Arts. I want down to earth people to teach my possible kids. Not a principal that went to SCD, went to UGA, then got a job at SCD. There are places in this city that do not teach the elitist personality. Savannah Christian, Calvary baptist, Memorial Day school, St Andrews, any are good options to at least consider."
savannah,39xxb1,jb3015,2,Tue Jun 16 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"Why are you biased in this regard?   Also, a secular school is very important to us so many of those you list may be non-starters."
savannah,39xxb1,jb3015,2,Thu Jun 18 14:13:11 2015 UTC,"Country Day is a fine school. Some students may be a bit snobby and entitled but that shouldn't determine whether or not your son goes there.   I went to Savannah Christian which is just as good as SCDS, maybe a bit lower academically but you didn't get that 'better than you attitude' that some people have referenced. It was a non-denominational Christian school but people from all religions went there without issue, you do take a Bible class and have morning prayer however. I believe Calvary, Memorial Day School and St Andrews are the same in that regard.   Another great private school is Hancock Day School which has a fantastic reputation though it only runs through middle school so you'd have to find another HS"
savannah,39xxb1,easyasxyz123,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:27:14 2015 UTC,"I'm divided on Savannah Christian.  I graduated from there and had a wonderful experience.  My daughter, however, went 2nd - 8th and was bullied horribly and the school would do nothing about it because I'm not an important person.  My brother's son had a great experience up to middle school and his daughter loves lower school there.  They get very fundamentalist about their bible teachings ( almost to Bible Baptist levels).  St. Vincent's is Catholic based but is accepting of all religions and teaches about religions around the world - I'm pretty sure BC would be a lot like that.    I would never send my kids to SCD - not only because of the overly inflated tuition, but also for the elitism that goes with it.  Savannah Christian was leaning too much that way when we left it.  St. Andrews is amazing but try The Sanctuary for pre-k - I've heard really great things about it.  Garrison Elementary is great for the Arts for lower grades.     The best thing is to visit each school and talk to parents both current and former to get a feel for what is going to be the best fit for your family."

He was the head of a political party that lead to the conquest of most of europe and the slaughter of millions.  Malik Zula Shabazz was the head of the New Black Panther Party from 2001 until 2013 and publically advocated multiple times for the murder of non-blacks.  He held that pulpit for twelve years before he stepped down on his own.  The fact that the members of the organization allowed him to speak such hateful remarks without any backlash from those inside the group says that either the voices were too few or that it is the held belief of the group.    If it wanted to be seen as a legitimate civil rights group, it's leaders and members would not put up with calls of violence against others.  It is not a responsible voice advocating for the black community.  It is completely ass-backwards from the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr."

Please stop trying to classify this group as anything but a hate group.  And equality across all the races?  Numbers 6, 8 and 9 of the Ten Point Program show that they did not want to be equal, but above anyone who was not black.    Maybe you should look up who ""Malik Shabazz"" was.  He was the CHAIRMAN of the NBPP.  The Grand freakin' Wizard of the Black Klan.    We call this ""supremacy"" when it has to do with other races."

We're not talking about a translation of a book from 1300 years ago either since this crap was made up in the 60's.  It's racist black supremacist garbage.  The ten point program shows that those in the black panther party want a separate system for themselves which went right against what Martin Luther King Jr. had fought so long to end.  They want to be treated like they are special.  Free land, food, housing, clothing, exemption from military service, separate juries, and all black criminals to be released from jail.

I remember one of the cops, the oldest one who outranked the others, telling me about the ""good days"" when cops had ""discretion"". He went on to define discretion as the authority to decide whether someone deserved to get the shit kicked out of them due to their attitude toward a cop. He complained that now they have such oversight that they've lost the respect (read: fear) of the community.   Worse still, he told me stories of how back in the day (1970's) when a new white cop was brought onto the force, they had to ""introduce"" him to the black community so that they would respect (read: fear) him. They would go down to River Street to a black bar, find the drunkest black man in there, drag him outside, beat the dog shit out of him, then arrest him on some made up charge. He wouldn't remember what happened the next morning so he couldn't defend himself in court against the charges, and the message was sent to and spread by the blacks who saw what happened. Not reporting him is one of my biggest regrets, but I had no proof he said it.   Now then, did Shabazz just list a bunch of black people as white people who helped black people?  Edit: Not sure why I'm being downvoted. If I downvote myself will yall like me again?   Edit 2: Just talked to my old manager, the cop's name was Officer Phillips. No one remembers his first name."

It also had to do with the injustices black people have suffered throughout history, generally speaking.   I'll admit, it may have been a bit off topic, but it was a shocking thing I heard first-hand from a Savannah-Metro police officer who told me about it (I'm assuming) because I'm white.   Downvote me for being off-topic if you will, but please don't think I'm making this story up. That almost makes me want to cry out of frustration. I watched all 28:29 of the video, and I disagree with most of what Shabazz said, but Officer Phillips told me what he told me.

savannah,393jls,wheelchair_boxing,0,Tue Jun 9 02:49:11 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with that if, if you had your dog on a leash or were near by. The park is pretty big and the I feel like the point of having your dog off their leash is to give them freedom to run around and play. So your dog could be running at the other end of the park and start fighting another dog. You wouldn't be able to anticipate that from far away. But I agree. You can gauge what your dog may do but only if you're right there."
savannah,393jls,ghostthecoast,3,Tue Jun 9 10:41:22 2015 UTC,"They shouldn't be off leash like that. It poses lots of dangers, to the dog itself, and to everyone else.  The dog could easily just run out into traffic. Or over to say hello to another dog, who is not friendly. Or it could become startled/fearful when meeting a stranger and react defensively. Or it could see some tiny little fluffy dog and jump into hunt mode and attack.   Outside of allotted, leash free, fenced in, dog parks, dogs should absolutely be on leads in cities."
savannah,393jls,CrystalElyse,2,Tue Jun 9 00:34:54 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with any of this, but I still understand the appeal for all of the people who do take their dog off leash in big parks like Forsyth  I'm so tempted to side with those people, and I'll actually admit I've done the same thing in the past, but there's always going to be that dog owner who will let an aggressive/unruly dog off its leash.  My dog is a certified therapy dog and would love the little bit of extra freedom to move around off it's leash. I'm 100% confident I can keep my dog with me at all times and have my dog on its leash before any contact with other people or dogs. I totally get the temptation, I've just had several bad experiences now in Forsyth particularly that really make it seem like this law needs to be enforced (whoever you are with the Husky named ""Savannah"", get your dog under control!)"
savannah,393jls,CrystalElyse,2,Tue Jun 9 00:46:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, I completely understand why they do it. It's damn hard to find anything with a yard, let alone a good size one. And that park is huge. It would be so nice to just let the dog run!  BUT most of the people who do this don't have very well trained dogs, or don't pay enough attention, or just have a little bit of bad luck. Dogs are animals after all, and even if they are well behaved, well trained, and have never done anything bad before, it doesn't mean that they won't get upset at a kid shoving it's fingers in their eyes and bite, or a million other scenarios, you know?   It just, unfortunately, isn't safe for anyone involved. There are a good amount of dog parks, or other parks in the area. Go for a leashed walk/run daily. Go do the dog park 1-2 times a week for freedom/running or visit a friend that has a yard.   There's the Savannah Dog Park, Daffin Dog Park, Beasley Dog Park, Herty Pines, and Lake Meyer. That's just in Savannah. There's also ones in Pooler, Georgetown, Richmond Hill, etc. Not to mention that during the off season, a lot of beaches become dog friendly as well.   There are so many appropriate, safe places to go to. It's so easy to find them all these days, too. There's no reason to risk your dog's safety (as well as the public's safety), just because someone is too lazy to search."

The problem is that my dog is 95% better trained then most of the dogs in the park and I still keep him on leash.

I trust that he would never harm anyone for any reason, but he really loves squirrels.  Savannah has a lot of them, and he wants to meet/chase/play with every single one.    All it takes is my dog off his leash and a squirrel across Drayton street and I'll be stuck with a dead/dying best friend and liability for any damages he caused because my dog was off leash and not under my control."

I occasional bring my dog to the meet up that happens after work on the north end of the park. it is mostly older folks and well mannered dogs. the older folks have no intentions of going to a park outside of forsyth but would be more than happy to make use of a fenced in area at forsyth if it was available."

I have had a parent with their kid come up to my dog on leash and hit my dog in the face with a disc at point blank range.

That being said, most of those are contained to certain areas, like off of Edgewater rd, mercy, or the like.

savannah,3918kz,astrodog88,3,Mon Jun 8 23:36:22 2015 UTC,"I think that is the thing. If you're coming from a actual metropolitan area or cities that compete for murder capital of the US, Savannah is meh. Hailing from Baltimore, Savannah is a relatively safe city."
savannah,3918kz,CrystalElyse,3,Tue Jun 9 02:11:26 2015 UTC,I'm from Buffalo!
savannah,3918kz,ryancunderwood,2,Tue Jun 9 02:23:39 2015 UTC,Oh hey there Buffalonian!
savannah,3918kz,Rightaway,5,Tue Jun 9 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"I have yet to find an area of downtown that I don't feel safe walking down alone at night. Yes, there's a good bit of gang violence, but that's typical in any big city. Yes, there's a good amount of homeless people, but they've all been quite friendly.   I, personally, feel like everything is overblown."
savannah,3918kz,ogbundleofsticks,3,Mon Jun 8 17:04:35 2015 UTC,Go walk around waters and 37th at 2am....or yamacraw village.
savannah,3918kz,ogbundleofsticks,3,Tue Jun 9 05:23:36 2015 UTC,yamacraw at 2am lately is mostly SCAD kids walking home now. the hive and turner house are behind it and now the hue across bay street.
savannah,3918kz,gatowman,2,Tue Jun 9 12:31:28 2015 UTC,"I live off mercy,  buy jeep up the bad neighborhood chatter it keeps property value down"
savannah,3918kz,TSpange,2,Tue Jun 9 01:27:53 2015 UTC,But keep**
savannah,3918kz,jenniehaniver,2,Tue Jun 9 01:28:21 2015 UTC,"I live in Richmond Hill where the only murders we have are husband/wife murder-suicides.  Savannah = Detroit to me.    But seriously, Southside isn't all that bad.  The areas I try to avoid are the state streets, Waters near 37th (almost mugged there), and the triangle between 17/516, MLK/Henry, and Mongomery/52nd.  Anyone who lives in the decent areas in/around the aforementioned areas have my apoligies, but my history with these areas will forever leave a bad taste in my mouth."
savannah,390wbf,creamyguacamole,5,Mon Jun 8 13:03:17 2015 UTC,"There was a dispute over the property—I suppose between the owner and the dog park operator. The dog park folded—I don't think it was for financial reasons—and the lot was unused for a couple/few years. As i understand it, plans for its use are still up in the air. However, the lot was recently used for a wedding, so may become a nice event space… with impossible parking."
savannah,390wbf,awkwardthrust,2,Mon Jun 8 13:30:25 2015 UTC,I was wondering this!  by starland cafe.  biked by to see a large quantity of people partying there the weekend before last.  Id guess that some group just cleaned it up nice and made it their venue.  Why so curious?
savannah,390wbf,Snake3ater,2,Mon Jun 8 13:18:05 2015 UTC,Weren't they charging for membership? I'd imagine the free dog park at Daffin hurt them if that was the case.
savannah,390wbf,tittybats,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:20:16 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter....you had to pay to use it.
savannah,390wbf,ryancunderwood,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:26:25 2015 UTC,i was wondering this myself. someone had told me about it so i hiked out there with my pup only to find it abandoned with gaping holes in the fencing. it was nice having a dog park i could walk to and I would have paid membership if it was still up and running.
savannah,38x8fo,DJSamDiamond,5,Sun Jun 7 16:50:27 2015 UTC,I vote for The Chromatic Dragon for some drinks and Mario Kart!
savannah,38x8fo,MinxyMiyagi,2,Mon Jun 8 23:58:37 2015 UTC,"Some friends and I will be there at nine playing Cards Against Humanity, come say hi!"
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:07:53 2015 UTC,we will head down there after Jurassic world. We will look for you.
savannah,38x8fo,pacman983,3,Sat Jun 13 18:52:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. I'm in a green  flannel with white pants. The password is ""Uh... Im looking for the meetup...the Reddit meetup. Are you-- Do you guys go on Reddit?""   Don't screw it up."
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:19:44 2015 UTC,Oh man. I'm definitely going to screw that up....
savannah,38x8fo,MinxyMiyagi,2,Sat Jun 13 23:33:18 2015 UTC,I believe in you. Running slightly late but on my way
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:08:11 2015 UTC,If I can make it it won't be till 10ish. Stupid job.
savannah,38x8fo,MinxyMiyagi,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:18:48 2015 UTC,Sounds good!
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:27:50 2015 UTC,How can I find y'all? I just walked through a couple of times but didn't see you.
savannah,38x8fo,antpile11,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"I'm here at a big table inside, got stuck at a birthday party. A couple of the others are on there way."
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:30:50 2015 UTC,So is there a full on bar crawl later?
savannah,38x8fo,gallivantrafter,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:56:41 2015 UTC,I don't know if the crawl is happening or not but a few of us will be at Chromatic Dragon at 9 if you wanna come
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:16:33 2015 UTC,"I dunno, but I think I'm going to show up to chromatic dragon at 9 and try to find the other people."
savannah,38x8fo,funnyfarm299,3,Sat Jun 13 19:16:49 2015 UTC,Just arrived...  11am location is still good...  12:30 may need to relocate to the end of the farmers market...
savannah,38x8fo,pacman983,2,Sat Jun 13 14:53:43 2015 UTC,came down around 1:30 didn't see anyone. :(
savannah,38x8fo,awkwardthrust,3,Sat Jun 13 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"Around 1ish we decided to make it a roaming event and made our way north up Bull Street...  Sorry we missed you, Reverend!"
savannah,38x8fo,jenniehaniver,2,Sat Jun 13 19:52:53 2015 UTC,Visit the Farmers’ Market while you’re there http://imgur.com/sRfJTQH
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,2,Wed Jun 10 19:42:22 2015 UTC,Saturday the 13th?
savannah,38x8fo,5T1GM4,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:42:22 2015 UTC,Yes! 2 days away!
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,2,Thu Jun 11 13:36:25 2015 UTC,OP you working tonight? A couple of us are heading to Doubles shortly
savannah,38x8fo,antpile11,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:03:07 2015 UTC,I did!  Sorry I missed the post
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,2,Sat Jun 13 14:51:27 2015 UTC,"If you are going to be outside at the dragon, bring bug spray, was there earlier and got eaten up"
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:32:41 2015 UTC,Wish I would have read this sooner. We lost a lot of good men.
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:57:05 2015 UTC,Anyone having trouble finding us? We're heading north
savannah,38x8fo,JamisTour13,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:02:34 2015 UTC,Hey just came on to say we're running a little late! I'll be there in 15 or so
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:07:31 2015 UTC,Walking in to Dragon
savannah,38x8fo,JamisTour13,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:24:40 2015 UTC,Would definitely be interested in a 21+ meetup if only because I generally sleep in past 1230 :p   I have never been to Doubles so I'll probably head there and say hello to anyone interested in some terrible bar games and my even more suspect dance moves!
savannah,38x8fo,awkwardthrust,6,Sun Jun 7 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"Shit, what about just a full on Reddit bar crawl?"
savannah,38x8fo,jenniehaniver,2,Mon Jun 8 18:56:45 2015 UTC,I am very open to this idea
savannah,38x8fo,awkwardthrust,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:23:06 2015 UTC,Awesome! All we need now is someone to organize it.
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,2,Mon Jun 8 21:33:38 2015 UTC,Begin @ Pinkie Masters. McDonough’s. O’Connell’s. Abe’s. Wet Willies (River St.). The Rail. Chromatic. End @ Doubles.  Night cap / ON-AFTER @ Wormhole
savannah,38x8fo,thebeef24,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"Nah, no good for a bar crawl– they're all too close to each other to be able to knock a drink back before hitting up the next place!"
savannah,38x8fo,Skoma,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:44:15 2015 UTC,"Drink faster! ;)  No worries, but what’s your plan of attack? Any H3’s here?  …I thought that was pretty good for off-the-cuff. Strong start, stumbling finish."
