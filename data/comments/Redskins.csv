Redskins,3e276n,Spidtrib,20,Tue Jul 21 11:38:07 2015 UTC,Sounds about right
Redskins,3e276n,FragsturBait,15,Tue Jul 21 13:29:30 2015 UTC,"The Richmond Economic Development Authority uses money from these and other sources to cover its annual $500,000 payment to the Redskins for holding their camp in Richmond, though that number wasnâ€™t reached in either of the first two seasons.  Last year, the EDA had to authorize a $258,538 payment to cover the shortfall.   This always rubbed me wrong. I don't understand why cities are willing to break the bank to give sports owners money for free. Glad it's not my city."
Redskins,3e276n,bohemianabe,8,Tue Jul 21 13:31:30 2015 UTC,"Prestige/pride in having a major sports team (especially the ""home"" team) come to your city. Highly-demanded summer entertainment for your citizens. Some boost to local businesses. It's not totally a one-way street that lines the pockets of the owners.  I wish the NFL owners (it's not just Snyder, but he is part of that system) would be less stingy about this stuff, but that's just not how it works right now."
Redskins,3e276n,whatshouldwecallme,4,Tue Jul 21 14:02:47 2015 UTC,"I've never had a problem with the city paying for civic buildings and stadiums. My issue is that these facilities are being used for the express profit of the private owners.  I'd have no problem with my city paying to keep this afloat If the Skins had the same ownership set up as the Packers.  In fact, all sports teams should have an ownership set up like the Packers."
Redskins,3e276n,amarstan,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:52 2015 UTC,Sports teams (and all businesses) should be owned by the employees.
Redskins,3e276n,SewenNewes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get the prestige and pride part, but not enough to sell out my city... fuck that. And that's a lot of money... I don't think enough businesses recoup that kind of money let alone for the local municipalities to make it up in tax revenue. Why don't sports owners have a little prestige and pride about how they treat their local fan base?"
Redskins,3e276n,bohemianabe,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:01 2015 UTC,Because voters keep voting for those dumbasses instead of making a stand.
Redskins,3e276n,nc_cyclist,2,Tue Jul 21 22:22:48 2015 UTC,The food options are so disappointing. Richmond has a great food truck scene but for most of them it isn't profitable to set up during camp. I guess as long as Papa Johns and Coke are there nobody really cares.    There's also plenty of free parking around if you know where to find it and can walk a mile.

Redskins,3e276n,UncleJesticle,7,Wed Jul 22 00:45:02 2015 UTC,It's too hot outside. Thanks Snyder.
Redskins,3e276n,ZZZrp,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"well, in all fairness.."
Redskins,3e276n,amarstan,6,Tue Jul 21 17:05:02 2015 UTC,Except it was the city's Economic Development Authority who made the decisions. The Redskins don't control that stuff.
Redskins,3e276n,trainspotting2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:51 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, I figure i'll ask here; I'm flying out to Australia to cover Training Camp, and need to know if Uber is a thing in Richmond, and if it's a viable way to get to/from camp each day?"
Redskins,3duk28,harDCore182,3,Sun Jul 19 16:51:25 2015 UTC,Just got the ical for the upcoming season.  Thought I would share the love.
Redskins,3duk28,dreadpierat,3,Sun Jul 19 16:53:18 2015 UTC,Thanks.
Redskins,3duk28,cowzilla3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:35:36 2015 UTC,Helpful! Thanks.
Redskins,3drl9f,nesqu1ck,13,Sat Jul 18 19:53:43 2015 UTC,DeAngelo's probably covering #1 receivers until it's obvious he can't or he gets hurt. Breeland looked like a stud last year partially because most of the Redskins' DBs have been abysmal for the past few years. He still got burned pretty bad when he was put in the position to cover other teams top WRs.
Redskins,3drl9f,adogwhoiskool,23,Sat Jul 18 21:37:54 2015 UTC,Ahem Dez got shut the fuck down by our boy Breeland
Redskins,3drl9f,ratamack,7,Sat Jul 18 22:10:55 2015 UTC,He did get destroyed by ODB though
Redskins,3drl9f,ZuluBaz,13,Sat Jul 18 23:55:09 2015 UTC,I remember him shutting odb down in the endzone and then the giants moving him to amersons side to get the td
Redskins,3drl9f,RustyHook_,8,Sun Jul 19 00:14:15 2015 UTC,He was also called for 4 penalties that the league came out and said should not have been called. Refs played into the OBJ hype hard that game.
Redskins,3drl9f,FloatAround,2,Sun Jul 19 17:18:08 2015 UTC,"Yup, we got fucked by the hype in that game. Fucked HARD."
Redskins,3drl9f,jam_pudding,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:43:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Jeff Triplette."
Redskins,3drl9f,CaptainKirkCousINTs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:45 2015 UTC,"He just needs more time on the field, that's all."
Redskins,3drl9f,feathertheclutch,11,Sun Jul 19 03:34:57 2015 UTC,I would think Culliver would take the #1 receiver.  Breeland probably won't start unless Hall gets injured.
Redskins,3drl9f,dirtyJerz77,7,Sat Jul 18 22:11:37 2015 UTC,Def going to be culliver.
Redskins,3drl9f,Pentt41207,7,Sat Jul 18 23:50:40 2015 UTC,"In the 4th quarter with the game on the line i want breeland in there, clutch as hell"
Redskins,3drl9f,RustyHook_,5,Sun Jul 19 00:15:13 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for the best for DHall, I've had his back for years against his detractors, but Achilles injuries can be notoriously difficult to come back from, especially on the wrong side of 30.  Culliver will be CB 1, and CB 2 is all about Halls health, imo.  I don't think it would hurt Breeland to have a season at CB3 and if he continues to improve eventually replace DHall."
Redskins,3drl9f,UnsungZer0,5,Sun Jul 19 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping Culliver plays extremely well for us because if Deangelo or Breeland end up as our 2nd and 3rd corners then I like the sound of that. Also, Amerson will be a very good 4th corner. He's not necessarily a great starter but if he's our 4th corner then at least part of our secondary should be decent."
Redskins,3drl9f,jhairfield,3,Sat Jul 18 23:36:44 2015 UTC,"I think Breeland has another good year, he was damn good last year, as he gets more up to speed with the NFL he'll be even better."
Redskins,3drl9f,mjohnson638,3,Sun Jul 19 01:15:46 2015 UTC,Considering how poor our safety play has been I want Hall to switch just to have him and Breeland on the field at the same time (assuming Culliver  takes the other side).   And I think Amerson plays much better this year in bump in run man instead of misunderstanding which zone he's covering.
Redskins,3drl9f,_quicksand,2,Sun Jul 19 05:01:31 2015 UTC,"It's gonna Cully as the 1, Breeland as the 2, and Hall hopefully as the 3. That twice-torn Achilles has me really nervous, and I have a feeling we will see a lot of Amerson this year as DHall regresses further."
Redskins,3dqjhq,nicknamebucky,7,Sat Jul 18 14:05:19 2015 UTC,RFK was an ugly building but goddamn did it rock like nowhere else when the 'Skins played.
Redskins,3dqjhq,Gummy_Joe,7,Sat Jul 18 17:59:57 2015 UTC,A big division or playoff game at RFK was like taking meth then fighting a rabid raccoon inside an empty beer keg.   The raccoon is also on meth.
Redskins,3dqjhq,BatCountry9,6,Sun Jul 19 02:48:28 2015 UTC,There was so many penalties that would've been called by today's standards in just that short segment
Redskins,3dqjhq,Solidtrip,6,Sat Jul 18 22:59:50 2015 UTC,That was an amazing game. All the neighbors heard me yelling and I couldn't talk the next day.
Redskins,3dqjhq,dreadpierat,4,Sat Jul 18 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"That's like the craziest outcome you could get, but so Joe Gibbs.   It's good to see the choke was always strong with Dallas QBs when they play us."
Redskins,3dqjhq,Music_snow,2,Sat Jul 18 20:53:16 2015 UTC,I clicked on this thinking it was going to be a 5 minute video but it's the full game. I'm not complaining since I was 4 when this came on and can't remember anything from it.
Redskins,3dqjhq,brown2hm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:25:03 2015 UTC,I watched through most of the game and now i'm watching a documentary about the 1987 season. 42-10 Redskins!  HTTR
Redskins,3dqjhq,pokeyjones,2,Sat Jul 18 16:59:02 2015 UTC,"Holy Shit!  Thanks for finding this! That was the first skins game I ever attended; I was 12.  I don't think I've ever seen the highlights, but I remember the fumble in the end zone clear as day."
Redskins,3dqjhq,Joe5205,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:23:32 2015 UTC,Wow.. I'm so immensely jealous.

Redskins,3dqjhq,IvyGold,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:44:50 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this is the game my dad took me to as a kid, timeframe seems right.  All I remember is leaving CT in a blizzard, Skins vs Cowboys game, Skins win it."

Redskins,3dqjhq,spectre3724,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:36:15 2015 UTC,RFK had a bouncing third baseline for baseball.   I was in it for the second U2 concert on their Achtung Baby tour.   I got a little seasick but oh what fun!
Redskins,3dqjhq,goooseJuice,2,Sun Jul 19 07:52:55 2015 UTC,It still bounces for D.C.United. Quite fun. Smoke bombs and everyone throwing their beer in the air after a goal add to the experience.
