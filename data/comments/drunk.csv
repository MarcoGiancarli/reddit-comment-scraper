Funnily enough, about 5 years later one of the greatest nights of my life was built on Molson Dry. I was at the Quebec City music festival and saw an evening of Classified followed by Wiz Khalifa followed by Wu-Tang Clan. From the moment I got there I was double fisting the only beers they had: Molson fucking Dry. By the time Wu Tang got on, I barely knew my own name. I was within 100 feet of the stage screaming WU TANG AIN'T NUTTIN TO FUCK WITH and having more fun than I can possibly describe.   Needless to say, this beer and I have a complicated relationship."

drunk,3dvy8q,bravadomizzou,4,Mon Jul 20 03:25:20 2015 UTC,I've seen a lot of people pointing out that the six pack was better beer but quality aside the first deal was still better:  $1.99 / (12 beers * 12oz) = $0.013 per oz $1.09 / (6 beers * 16oz) = $0.011 per oz  None the less good find!
drunk,3dvy8q,raider112,4,Mon Jul 20 14:09:58 2015 UTC,It was actually a 4 pack of tallboys.
drunk,3dvy8q,AndroidAnonymous,2,Mon Jul 20 16:45:04 2015 UTC,My mistake!  I stand corrected and now clearly remember it being a 4 pack.. A four pack would change it to $0.017 per oz so the 12 pack was in fact a better deal.

drunk,3dsc7u,skinnyowner,-32,Sun Jul 19 17:57:51 2015 UTC,i would have informed the manager of the pricing error whoever is responsible will now be fired and will go on welfare and take handouts from taxpayers
drunk,3dsc7u,Akasirus,16,Sun Jul 19 18:20:05 2015 UTC,Most chain grocery stores have prices set by corporate so if the UPC rang those in at $1.09 that's the price as far as any store level employee is concerned. The only pricing problems are from inaccurate tags making customers believe the price was lower than it is in which case some chains will give the item for free.
drunk,3dsc7u,studdenfadden,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"It's likely they rang up that price because they were supposed to be sold as singles. So it's not a pricing error in the the UPC rang up the wrong price, but it's a pricing error selling that UPC as a 4-pack"
drunk,3dsc7u,skinnyowner,3,Sun Jul 19 01:52:35 2015 UTC,"He used a self check out. The self check out computer would have realized that the four pack weighed 4 times as much as the single pack UPC and called for an attendant, as those machines use wight to ensure customers aren't screwing with the machine to steal."
drunk,3dsc7u,GoingPole2Pole,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:03:27 2015 UTC,That's possible but most products that are sold as four packs have some way to hide the UPC on the individual products to stop the checker from charging for a single item or the UPC on each can will ring up as the four pack.
drunk,3dsc7u,studdenfadden,-3,Sun Jul 19 07:09:39 2015 UTC,That's not true. All I have to do is take a SPA gun and do a price audit. Chances are it was an employee error.
drunk,3dsc7u,GoingPole2Pole,2,Sun Jul 19 07:42:28 2015 UTC,"At a large chain? I worked for a week at one and the printer connected to the Provincial head office just spat out the new price signs in the morning. The tills were all wired to head office as well.  Even the GM couldn't set the prices. The only way to adjust prices was to ring stuff in wrong, like punching in peanuts when ringing in pistachios."

drunk,3dtlh1,ELiz94,4,Sun Jul 19 09:30:03 2015 UTC,"On one of my old college friend's birthdays, at a bar, I bought him two long island iced teas to sober him up. He was incredibly drunk and we needed to sober him up to get him up a hill to his dorm room. I had no idea that long island iced teas were basically pure alcohol; I thought they involved tea in some way. So he drank both. And he got so unbelievably drunk that we basically had to carry him up a huge hill and two staircases to get him home. For reasons I don't really remember, as we climbed the first set of stairs, the two of us doing the carrying were singing the Friends theme song. That was the night I learned that he is an alcoholic, and not just an occasional fun drinker. I've been distancing myself from that circle of people ever since. We are still friends but it's different.   I don't know where I was going with this. Uh. Anyway, long island iced teas are strong. The end.  edit - clarity"

And if one time is not enoug, than entertain yourself again if you have still too much energy and want to stay awake, go to the store or to your neighbour. Be sure to drink enough water before you go to sleep, or whenever you may wake up to pee anywhere in between. Water is good for everything, even for papers. And if you happen to have some vitamine b or c, also take that. But for sure lots of water, after or before, or during the rum. And paper is due on monday, and today is still here saturday, so you are lucky. Enjoy your luck, celebrate, either with new rum, or pleasure yourself until you black out."

Wake up 2 days later with a kitchen full of empty beer, wine, and vodka bottles, Chinese food containers thrown into the corners of various rooms, and half a shitty pizza in your fridge.  Immediately begin freaking out about your checking account balance.  Smoke two cigarettes to calm down enough to call in to work to explain why you aren't coming in.  Place the paper towels from your kitchen in your bathroom because you're out of buttwipe and you know what's coming around the corner.  Cross your fingers that your power isn't going to be shut off and try to go to sleep.  Make sure you have a backup plan in case you're awake for the next day and a half.

drunk,3dpqku,anotherglassofwine,3,Sat Jul 18 07:25:38 2015 UTC,Cocaine is one hellavu drug
drunk,3dpqku,anotherglassofwine,2,Sat Jul 18 08:21:28 2015 UTC,(´･_･`) I've never done coke. What's it like.
drunk,3dpqku,anotherglassofwine,3,Sun Jul 19 03:44:31 2015 UTC,Haha that sounds fun but I have issues with addiction so I wouldn't trust me with coke.
drunk,3dpqku,gamophyte,2,Sat Jul 18 06:41:42 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it's not as bad on the addiction spectrum after you're off it as say, heroin or meth (drugs it's often grouped with for some reason). But while you're on it, you and your mates sort of form a coalition to get more coke while you're all still high and there's always a ridiculous plan to keep doing it forever. Fortunately (around like 7am), the dealer goes to sleep or goes to fuck his girlfriend or something and the party ends. Then you have a beer or Xanax and fall asleep and then wake up and wonder why you ever touched the filthy shit."
drunk,3dpqku,gamophyte,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:42:15 2015 UTC,"It makes you feel like the most important person in the room. So obviously it's really fun to talk to someone also on coke because you keep interrupting each other because you feel like what you have to say is more important. Even if you're not normally that type of person! Also, you're just oddly confident. It's a strange, lovable drug."

drunk,3dpcib,ChokeZero,5,Sat Jul 18 05:00:21 2015 UTC,"Penis size is largely due to demand obviously. Sexual selection falls into this. So everyone here now had successful predecessors. But then there is like, a huge variety of sizes among human with less than 5% DNA deference. This literally means penis size doesn't matter. Sexual selection is based off something else. Don't worry about penis size."
drunk,3dpcib,gamophyte,6,Sat Jul 18 06:18:03 2015 UTC,"That depends on how small it is and what kind of chinaman you are.  But dick size isn't that important. You can row your boat to China, it just takes longer than a cruise ship."
