winnipegjets,3e2l1h,RabbleRabble668,18,Tue Jul 21 13:54:15 2015 UTC,I just want us to pay Ladd his money and get him locked up. I'd like to keep Buff but if he's holding firm at some ridiculous amount of money (say 8.5) then I'm OK with letting him walk.  edit: by 'let him walk' I meant move him this summer or at the deadline.
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,ehr0c,10,Tue Jul 21 14:38:57 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said it better myself. Ladd is essential to this team in my opinion. Especially since he seems to love this city and is a wonderful captain. I'm really scared of getting burnt with buff if he signs an expensive long term deal. I like him but I don't think he's worth the risk. To be honest I would rather see him traded but that will be hard right now.
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,PolarOpposites8,4,Tue Jul 21 14:47:14 2015 UTC,As long as its outside our division I'm okay with it.
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,Hero_of_Brandon,8,Tue Jul 21 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"letting him walk   You mean trading him pronto so we get a return on an 8.5m/year asset, right?  We cannot let him walk to free agency and get nothing for him."
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,GrayBread,9,Tue Jul 21 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unless we're planning on a deep playoff push and Buff has shown he has better control of his temper I would be upset if we didn't get some return on him. But we can't trade him until after we play Buffalo, for certain reasons..."
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,Hero_of_Brandon,3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:23 2015 UTC,The longer we hold him the less he is worth.  I'd like to see him either signed or traded before the season starts.
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,ehr0c,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:27 2015 UTC,We'd have to move him this summer to get max value I'm thinking.
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,ehr0c,3,Tue Jul 21 18:31:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what I meant."
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,clemoh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:36 2015 UTC,That would be very un-Cheveldayoff like.
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,jesuswolf,5,Tue Jul 21 15:58:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I think we can get a pretty nice return for Buff. Even if we 'lose' the trade, I still think Chevy can get some decent assets out of it."
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,Buddha_is_my_homeboy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:54 2015 UTC,"That's what happened with the Kane trade. On paper Chevy ""lost"" the trade, since Kane was the most skilled player involved, but the assets coming back were so bountiful that it mitigated the ""loss."" I would love to see something similar for Buff. The return would be that much greater, since Buff is healthy, AND that would possibly create a spot for Morrissey to get into the lineup. It would hurt losing the big man, but the Jets are not a cap team. Buff's dollar value seems to preclude him remaining a Jet. That being the case, he can't be allowed to walk the way Fro did."

winnipegjets,3e2l1h,pegcity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:13 2015 UTC,I would be more okay with trading him and getting a decent return for one of our better players than letting him walk
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,Xanick,13,Tue Jul 21 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"I think my flair shows where I stand on the Buff issue.  Though my real issue is the ownership of one of the most financially healthy teams in the league having an ""internal cap"".  We ponied up for you, time to pony up for us."
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,Premier_Poutine,5,Tue Jul 21 16:07:11 2015 UTC,"I really hate to come off as sounding like I'm making an excuse for Buff, but honestly, when you miss up to as many games as he did from injury and then suspension, in playoff-level hockey during the season, there's only so much you can do to prepare for intense games during the days off leading up to a series of  playoff games.  Before the injury and suspension, he was absolutely dynamite for our team, and that's not an exaggeration.  It's easy to forget how much he actually did during the season up until that point.  I think he didn't ""show up"" in the playoffs because he just wasn't prepared enough for that type of game.    And another important factor is definitely off-ice.  He's a big part as we all know of what happened with the trade of Kane/Bogo (see tracksuit).  We talk about locker-room leaders, personalities and all that, PoMo has said in many video interviews that he's a big part in making that locker room tick the way it does.  Everyone in Winnipeg knows this, and everyone here knows how much of Winnipeg's personality is manifested in a guy like Buff.  For this I feel like that by itself is losing too much if we lose him.  Aside from all that, here's a simple fact: He's an All-Star defenseman on a team without any other All-Stars.  We talk about the Jets needing some all-star but overlook the fact that we have one.  Just my two cents."
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,userfriendly23,2,Tue Jul 21 20:53:44 2015 UTC,"I don't like the notion of not doing anything besides very preliminary talks with Buff until Ladd's deal is done. I understand that Ladd is priority one, and I get why you wouldn't have really detailed conversations with Buff's agent yet... But christ, whether Ladd signs or not (and he better) we still have Buff to deal with. If he's asking for too much $ and term (which seems pretty likely) then Chevy needs to start working the phone aleady!!!  Of course, there's oodles going on we don't know about.... but geez, July 1 is long gone...."
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,b3hr,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:08 2015 UTC,BIG HIT BY BIG BUFF!!!
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,b3hr,2,Tue Jul 21 14:16:09 2015 UTC,I was at the Jets store in St Vital. Looks like Little is next to go based on the curse of the Jets store Mural. Ladd is on the main one so not looking good on that one. On the plus side Byfuglien is not represented at all so looking good for him.
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,deus216,2,Tue Jul 21 16:26:08 2015 UTC,"Well in all fariness they've also had Wheeler, Sheifele, Trouba, and Pavelec on the MTS Centre. and the only one of those that I can see leaving anytime soon is Pavelec"

winnipegjets,3e2l1h,Funk48,0,Tue Jul 21 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"I know i will get downvoted to hell but am i the only one that wouldn't care or perhaps wants ladd gone?    i think on another top 1/3 team in the league ladd would be on a second if not third line.  He has been good here, but gave up on Noelle along with alot of his teamates and showed a lack of leadership there and with Kane and never struck me as a key part of the team.  I would rather change the dynamic of the team that followed them from Atlanta and give someone else a chance to lead the team."
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,ehr0c,11,Tue Jul 21 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"it is true Ladd was a 3rd line player earlier in his career..but I guess it just goes to show, give a guy a chance and he may show you something. There was an article from I believe ArticIceHockey, that showed in the recent years players who have produced similar numbers to Ladd to show his $ value. Those players turned out to be Zach Parise and Jeff Carter. That's pretty good company.   Ladd's not flashy but he gets the job done and plays a two way game. He was a part of Canada's IIHF roster when he was a Winnipeg Jet and was also was invited to try out for Canada's Olympic team last year. Also, nominated for a Mark Messier Leadership Award just this past season (other nominees were Getzlaf and Toews). So I would say he's pretty underrated tbh. IMO, I think Kane isolated himself with the way he acts/acted. And I'm not that familiar with that Noel situation, but there's a reason he was fired, he wasn't getting enough out of his players and it showed in the way we were losing.  One more thing, Ladd's numbers in the past 5 years:   '10-11 season: 81 gms played, 29 goals, 59 pts  '11-12: 82 gms played, 28 goals, 50 pts  '12-13 (lockout shortened season): 48 games played, 18 goals, 46 pts (almost a point per game)  '13-14: 78 games played, 23 goals, 54 pts  '14-15: 81 games played, 24 goals, 62 pts  So, it shows he's producing (at a first line rate) and is durable. So I'd have to say he's pretty valuable to us"
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,watertattoo,-8,Tue Jul 21 19:18:11 2015 UTC,Call me crazy but I would like to see Ladd go.  I've heard he likes to poo poo our city and is kind of a dick.  I think Wheeler would make a better captain.  The guy would run through a wall for our team and I don't think there is a guy on the ice who puts out more effort.
winnipegjets,3e2l1h,Funk48,9,Tue Jul 21 17:18:12 2015 UTC,I've heard    Classic Winnipeg. Heard it from a friend of a friend of a roommate of someone's third cousin who put up drywall at the Jets store.

winnipegjets,3e1axd,Premier_Poutine,2,Tue Jul 21 14:54:40 2015 UTC,"I liked this assessment:  Lemieux came to the Winnipeg Jets as part of the Evander Kane trade with Buffalo. The son of former NHLer and multiple time Stanley Cup champion Claude Lemieux was a Sabres second round pick who actually never signed his first NHL contract with Buffalo. The Jets took care of that earlier this week signing Lemieux to a huge contract for a rookie. The three year, two way contract was worth $1.125 million and is one of the main reasons I believe the Jets plan to give him every chance to make the NHL roster this season. Lemieux is a chip off the old block playing a eerily similar style to his father. He can score, he plays physical, and he has a huge mean streak. Lemieux can be a valuable NHL player and I believe he would look great along side Adam Lowry. It would be a huge leap for Lemieux who has put in three years in the OHL for the Barrie Colts, but for Winnipeg to throw over a million dollars at him, they clearly have high hopes.  http://thehockeywriters.com/5-winnipeg-jets-prospects-ready-to-play-in-the-nhl-this-season/"

winnipegjets,3d7uze,WpgMikos,9,Tue Jul 14 04:55:57 2015 UTC,I initially read that as Blackhawks and almost got very concerned.
winnipegjets,3d7uze,SeniorSophomore,3,Tue Jul 14 13:56:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly between this, Portland and Chicago, half our team is going to be ex-Hawks of some sort or another soon enough"
winnipegjets,3d7uze,rookie-mistake,2,Tue Jul 14 23:06:42 2015 UTC,soon enough   Toews to Winnipeg confirmed
winnipegjets,3d7uze,ComplexChristian,3,Thu Jul 16 02:03:44 2015 UTC,Appears there was some discussion that he was considering the OHL but Columbus Dispatch reporter Aaron Portzline says he has confirmed that he will play NCAA next season.
winnipegjets,3d7uze,klevenisms204,3,Tue Jul 14 04:56:46 2015 UTC,"out of curiosity, what would better develop him for the nhl?   playing in the O? or ncaa?  i guess he gets a free ride through school, but if he's like trouba, he'll realize you can do quite well playing pro hockey and ditch school"
winnipegjets,3d7uze,cgwinnipeg,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:10:15 2015 UTC,He's not as good as trouba though

winnipegjets,3d7ju7,RabbleRabble668,3,Tue Jul 14 04:41:38 2015 UTC,If they decide to trade Buff it better be to a different division. I'd like to possibly see what Edmonton would be willing to give for him.
winnipegjets,3d7ju7,watertattoo,4,Tue Jul 14 03:59:49 2015 UTC,"Buff's no trade clause/no-movement whatever one it is would probably hamper a trade to EDM. Tho idk what everyone's perception is of the Oilers ATM. And not too familiar with their salary cap situation.   I like Philly as a trade partner. Different conference so we wouldn't have to see him as much, and I like Philly's LHD prospects: Sam Morin (6'6 224 lbs 11th overall in 2013) and Manitoban Travis Sanheim (6'3 198 lbs 17th overall in 2014). Not sure how well they're progressing but seen that Philly fans are really excited about their defensive core in the future with those two plus Provorov.  But if we could pluck one of the two mentioned earlier and package them with a pick or player for Buff (more?) that'd be sweet. Not really sure of Philly's team needs but basically referring my opinion to that arcticicehockey post"
winnipegjets,3d7ju7,Willyq25,2,Tue Jul 14 07:45:57 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that Buff probably has different ideas of what would be considered an attractive place to live. He seems more interested in a quiet life, ice-fishing, boating etc (which makes winnipeg or minny ideal). That being said, i hope he stays."
winnipegjets,3d7ju7,pronking1983,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:36:49 2015 UTC,I wonder if Philly would even be able to handle his salary with their cap.
winnipegjets,3d7ju7,ShittyForeplay,3,Tue Jul 14 13:00:58 2015 UTC,"I could see Detroit as the most likely place IMO, considering that they have a surplus of LHD and some prospects the Jets would be interested in."
winnipegjets,3d7ju7,pegcity,2,Tue Jul 14 04:50:50 2015 UTC,If we trade Buff to DET. I'd like to see Pulkkinen + a D-man/D prospect in the package
winnipegjets,3d7ju7,ehr0c,9,Tue Jul 14 06:17:11 2015 UTC,Enough with the prospects.  If we are going to give up an all star it had better be for actual players
winnipegjets,3d7ju7,ConqueringCanada,4,Tue Jul 14 15:01:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. If we move Buff I'd want to be getting a top-4 (ideally top-pairing) LHD back in trade. At which point we're going to be paying them Buff money anyways so why bother?
winnipegjets,3d7ju7,pegcity,3,Tue Jul 14 15:03:01 2015 UTC,"But we would be trading him for budgetary reasons, so if we take back an all star (or all star calibre) player, we're taking back as much salary. A prospect gives us the budgetary room."
winnipegjets,3d7ju7,ConqueringCanada,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly why I don't think we should trade him.  Let him have a meh year and sign him for less, or let him have a great year and someone else can sign him.  I don't think we are going to get much for him, teams know why we are dumping and won't pony up."
winnipegjets,3d69jy,InternationalCow,2,Mon Jul 13 21:16:56 2015 UTC,I'm a little unsure how much faith to put in a projection system that does everything by numbers and stats.  Especially a new one that may not be completely tested.  But the stats like the Jets prospects.  The scouts like the Jets prospects.  It's a very good sign.
winnipegjets,3d69jy,dejour,3,Tue Jul 14 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"From their twitter: The Projection Project is not intended to replace traditional scouting, rather to serve as a tool in combination with traditional scouting."

winnipegjets,3d4l1w,ComplexChristian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:26:31 2015 UTC,"It plays almost identically to the first 3 iterations of the Arkham series. They added the Batmobile which was a change but the rest of it was very similar with a new story.  Overall it lived up to my expectations. It got a little tedious collecting all the riddler trophies but those are optional anyways. If you haven't played the first three you could get a very similar experience for a lot less by playing those on last gen.  I finished it, and am still happy that I bought it."

winnipegjets,3d4l1w,ComplexChristian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:43:02 2015 UTC,I'd wait if you haven't played the first three. Or I'd go find the first three and play them.  Don't forget about it though because it's a great game.

winnipegjets,3d4l1w,imfromwinnipeg,2,Tue Jul 14 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I like the idea during the offseason of having the weekly thread always stickied and then we also sticky something for training camp, pre-season and stuff.  I always liked alternating between the game day threads and the general discussion thread during the season. But maybe we can keep a weekly thread stickied, sorted by new, and then I can also sticky game day threads? We'll have to chat about it!   Edit - Sweet we can sticky links now too!"
winnipegjets,3d4l1w,jesuswolf,3,Tue Jul 14 23:14:09 2015 UTC,"I think the alternation is good during the season. Keeps what we're looking at current and fresh. I thought the Post-Game threads were very good last season lots of participation (even if sometimes if was just for upvote parties) and some good discussion. The pre-game threads basically acted as General Discussion threads with a little more emphasis on the day's match-up. The Game threads themselves were a little barren, but became very helpful when the /r/hockey threads decomposed into shitty hate fests.   If it were left up to me, I'd have a normal GD thread stickied everyday, and then sticky other things like recruiting for /r/hockey events (power rankings blurbs, GDT posters, 30 in 30, etc. etc. etc.) as they come up. I guess my main thing here is that I don't think I'd like always having two threads stickied."

He wasn't exactly proud of it, but he was a musician in the 80s/90s.

winnipegjets,3cjia0,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Thu Jul 9 19:34:51 2015 UTC,"That's one of the huge reasons expansion teams have always been terrible. You're largely working with the older guys that teams don't want. The Sharks, in their first season, went 17-58-5 in 91-92 and followed that up with 11-71-2 in 92-93.

winnipegjets,3cjia0,Harborcoat84,2,Thu Jul 9 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"Haven't heard anything yet so I'm still unsure.  Could be we end up sharing the Monarchs with the Kings, but there are a few independent ECHL teams we could affiliate with (Rapid City Rush, Tulsa Oilers, Wichita Thunder)."
winnipegjets,3cjia0,Not_Jacob_Trouba,2,Thu Jul 9 16:45:12 2015 UTC,Wouldn't mind affiliating with Rapid City. SoDak isn't too far from home.
winnipegjets,3cjia0,RabbleRabble668,2,Thu Jul 9 16:58:07 2015 UTC,Even Tulsa and Wichita aren't too bad. Still closer than St. John's! Haha.
winnipegjets,3cjia0,weesstt,2,Thu Jul 9 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"I have never fully understood the ECHL stuff, but it looks like we were only the secondary NHL affiliate for the Reign, and the Kings were the primary. The new Ontario Reign is just an AHL team, and the new ECHL version of the Manchester Monarchs are so far only tied to the Kings."

winnipegjets,3cjia0,RabbleRabble668,4,Thu Jul 9 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"So I did that escape death row thing today, was a tonne of fun! I would highly recommend it!"
winnipegjets,3cjia0,salapeno,2,Thu Jul 9 02:11:45 2015 UTC,Is there a lot of physical activity ? Like jumping crawling ? Anything that really uses knee a lot.  I'm only asking because my friends and I were interested in going but I have a knee injury situation that fucks up stuff like that.
winnipegjets,3cjia0,RabbleRabble668,2,Sat Jul 11 21:42:36 2015 UTC,"Nope, not at all. I have major knee issues and did it on a pulled tendon. The girl working straight out said, ""It's not a test of strength"" It's mainly logic puzzles and problem solving.  THere's only one part that requires crawling and but only one person needs to do it. They had a guy do it with his leg in a full cast and on crutches."
winnipegjets,3cjia0,salapeno,2,Sat Jul 11 21:49:10 2015 UTC,Nice ! In excited to try it then. I always thought there was a chasing part or something along those lines.

There was a fly on the ground that couldn't fly, so I was trying to squish it to put it out of it's misery, but it went nuts and I thought it landed on my neck so I screamed and freaked out a little. I left the fly alone after that.  Went for a walk and ended up at a museum wandering around for a while.. Learned about the history of Transcona! The stone spear heads intrigued me.

winnipegjets,3cg1s7,mHo2,2,Tue Jul 7 17:11:33 2015 UTC,I had the same thought watching today's scrimmage.
winnipegjets,3cg1s7,spillcheck,2,Tue Jul 7 18:17:44 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm way off base on this but this isn't necessarily an awful thing all the time. Some guys like Toews and Bergeron are great two way players. Ovechkin is a great goal scorer but also doesn't play back.  Is his poor defensive play a bad thing?  I don't know. Maybe someone else has more insight but I don't think it's necessarily bad especially if you play with guys who will cover up for you like Frolik used to for Ladd (I think?)
winnipegjets,3cg1s7,scottsaa,6,Tue Jul 7 19:25:21 2015 UTC,I think your value is basically:  How many goals did you create for your team minus how many goals did you create for the other team (by defensive errors/ not backchecking etc.)  It's common enough for a 40 point forward with a strong defensive game to be just as valuable as an 80 point forward who is a defensive liability.  The good news is that it is usually easier to teach defensive accountability than offensive creativity.
winnipegjets,3cg1s7,dejour,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:01:09 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm really worried he will always be a defensive liability but I hope he can figure it out

Make sure that he has taken ownership of his issues in Carolina and is vowing not to repeat them.  The Jets do have a bit of a hole at right wing.

Everything Frolik did, he did it slower than Burmi. Burmi is an upgrade over Frolik in every sense of the word minus the experience.   He worked incredibly hard, it was not uncommon for him to keep the puck in the offensive zone on a Penalty Kill, whether by stick handling or pinning it in the corner and keeping it there for nearly a minute."

The long of the short, the longtime owners of the Thrashers never got the city around the team -they never marketed the team, and as a result never sold hockey. As a pretty big fan of my team and the sport, I knew there were fans here, but there weren't enough of us to sustain the team, so yeah I'm pretty bitter about the ASG (old team owners) ushering out the team because they basically hated it, and the league...I get they have to manage/oversee all these teams, but the cold shoulder while Arizona was getting so much attention sucked.   But that's okay! My old team became my new team...one that has a VERY solid (and awesome!) fan base, a management team whose sole purpose isn't to fuck over the franchise, a competent GM that drafts well and can make some solid trades (he isn't completely without fault, but he's a god over the previous ones), and yeah... ""Let's Go Thrashers!"" became ""Go Jets Go!"" pretty quickly and easily after the announcement was made my team was headed north. I mean that one headline, ""Spontaneous games of street hockey erupted around the city."" -I have no idea the validity of that, but I just thought, if that's how they're celebrating getting an NHL team in their city, then I want to be apart of that group of fans!

I know there are die hard fans in every city for every team, and that's awesome, but it's not sustainable. I see so many empty seats in Arizona and Florida that anyone there must be die hard fans, but it's still disheartening to see. Obviously I'm biased, and people would think the same of me if I were to attend, say, an NBA game. It doesn't change the fact that certain sports are better suited in different areas, and those cities on a strictly numbers basis would value their team a little more.

You took them away, and when your team had the same financial difficulties ours did, and we were trying to get a team back in Winnipeg, the league said we couldn't buy our franchise back.  They gave you so many chances, and blocked us so many times.  Your team still has financial problems.  Your cities don't want you.  Fans do, I understand that, but the city councils themselves are rejecting the team.    Understand, please, that team has our franchise history attached to it.  Those retired numbers you hang mean more to us than they do to you.  Those are my heroes from my childhood.  And seeing all that go unsupported, when that could have all been moved back here and been supported, it makes me sad."
winnipegjets,3ci563,Peskey,2,Wed Jul 8 14:16:13 2015 UTC,"Your cities don't want you. Fans do, I understand that, but the city councils themselves are rejecting the team.

winnipegjets,3ci563,QueefLatinaTheThird,11,Thu Jul 9 22:16:03 2015 UTC,"For me,  it's because I wanted a team back so bad. Exactly as has been said,  you see all  these markets get chance after chance. It got frustrating. Honestly for me ever since the jets came back,  I haven't thought once about relocation. I don't care who has teams anymore,  all is right in the world with me."
winnipegjets,3ci563,dejour,5,Wed Jul 8 04:15:39 2015 UTC,"If we had 5% of the effort on part of the league that the coyotes have had, we never would have lost our team."
winnipegjets,3ci563,jielshunta,5,Thu Jul 9 00:20:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Jets fans should be nicer about that.  We should be empathetic and supportive.  But as a Jet fan that lived through the Jets 1.0 move, I was struck by how callous the US media (and to some extent the national Canadian media) was about the move.  It was always in a sort of a tone about how Winnipeg was a quaint market and the league had outgrown Winnipeg.  Sure 35,000 people attended a rally to save the Jets and millions of dollars were collected in fan donations in a futile effort to buy the team.  But this was progress and moving from Winnipeg to Phoenix was overall a good thing.  So yeah, I think there is an underlying current of ""If you don't care about us, we won't care about you.""  That said, most US fans have been supportive of the new incarnation of the Jets - so it's time to let go of old grievances."
winnipegjets,3ci563,sneezypenguin,3,Wed Jul 8 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"When Jets1.0 was ready to relocate, the league didn't give us any money. The league didn't buy the team themselves, losing money every year, just to keep them in Arizona. There is, without a doubt, many great Coyotes fans. There were also many great Thrasher fans. The problem is, there just aren't enough of them. Are we still bitter that you guys took our team in the first place? Absolutely. Are we more bitter that the team that we loved is now on strike 5 in their attempt to keep them? Definitely."
winnipegjets,3ci563,verify_deez_nuts,2,Fri Jul 10 14:46:43 2015 UTC,Well said.
winnipegjets,3ci563,sneezypenguin,2,Fri Jul 10 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"My issue is not with Phoenix, as the city does seem to want a team in the NHL, but no one particularly wants to step up to the plate and deliver.  My issue isn't with the Sunbelt areas, or even southern-market teams because fuck that argument look at fucking Tampa Bay. One of the best places to play hockey is in Florida. The Coyotes have passionate fans in the southern markets, much like L.A., San Jose, and Carolina.  My issue is with both the NHL and the City of Glendale. Firstly, Glendale took the team under their wing away from Phoenix, which had the better fanbase, and thought, ""Yeah, nah, this sucks. We're not gonna pay for this."" Phoenix immediately expresses interest in getting the team back and re-renaming them to the Phoenix Coyotes.  Secondly, the NHL. I'll be that guy and say they never should have moved the team away from Winnipeg in the first place, but it seemed like the only option at the time, so I can't entirely blame Commissioner Gary Bettman for that. I can, however, blame him for putting franchises in areas that just do not draw at all. Florida, or Miami if you will, is the best example of this.  If they had not bailed out the team year after year after year, that team would have been long gone, which honestly is good for those fans to keep the team. Well done.  However, I have resentment towards the NHL for not giving Winnipeg another chance sooner and not putting the expansion team in Winnipeg opposed to Atlanta. Sorry, Atlanta fans, but I think it was absolutely the wrong move. Especially after the Flames did not pan out in the first attempt they made for the NHL in the Dirty South.  I would never wish, though, that a fanbase loses their team. Ever. It's pretty disheartening to see that, even from the Atlanta Thrashers fans (that's where I have sympathy) I still wish that would have worked out in the long run. Sadly, the owners just didn't care.  So, do I wish Arizona loses their team? Yes and no. Yes, because fuck Glendale for taking the team for a year or two and basically saying, ""Yeah, this isn't gonna work."" No, because they need to go back to Phoenix. You know, where the market can have potential to grow.  That's my two cents."
winnipegjets,3ci563,sneezypenguin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"No, because they need to go back to Phoenix. You know, where the market can have potential to grow.   I agree a move back to Phoenix has the potential to be very good for the team, and I think a lot of 'yotes fans agree with me there. I root for the Islanders as well and the move to Brooklyn is going to be difficult, but some of us are hoping it's a stopgap until they can move back onto the Island.   None of us are happy with Glendale and I don't think anyone's saying they're happy to stay there because they love it so much, they're happy to stay in the same way the Islanders are happy to be in Brooklyn: We'd rather be a bit further away but still in the area than be in QC"
winnipegjets,3ci563,sneezypenguin,4,Fri Jul 10 14:47:54 2015 UTC,"It boils down to the fact that hockey doesn't belong in the desert. It moreso belongs in place like QC, Seattle, southern Ontario, etc. Fuck Vegas, that's dumb, too."

winnipegjets,3cce8s,randylaheyjr,3,Mon Jul 6 20:49:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they most likely made the arena and stuff before the scoreboard was actually updated."
winnipegjets,3cce8s,SeniorSophomore,2,Mon Jul 6 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"That is true. Since it's too late in the development cycle for them to model the new scoreboard and code how it works, I can only seeing it making through a patch, or hell it might not make it til next year considering how EA is sometimes lazy with updating this."
winnipegjets,3cce8s,SeniorSophomore,4,Mon Jul 6 20:59:30 2015 UTC,"It's kinda common for different series' like NHL to be ""lazy"" persay because of the development cycle and the release date that they are given. I don't work for EA nor do I work in the gaming industry. But I do know that if the team working on the game has a deadline for specific things, they need it in by that date and they don't get polished or looked upon until right before release. Sometimes they even add things a week before its release. Sometimes even a few days. Which is pretty much why for the next gen version of NHL 15, there were a lot of missing options.  Edit: Grammar"

I've actually spend most of my time looking gaming trivia and even development cycles for a lot of games and how look it takes to develop them. For example, what does Resident Evil 4, Shenmue, and Fallout 3 all have in common? They each took 6 years to develop."
winnipegjets,3cce8s,Kilcona,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"It's crazy how long it takes to make those kinds of games, even crazier how Ubisoft makes Assassin's Creed games set in different places every year (I think they rotate the development on 3 studios so each studio has 3 years of development for a new AC game)"
winnipegjets,3cce8s,SeniorSophomore,2,Mon Jul 6 21:39:34 2015 UTC,"In a way, you are correct. The longest development period for an Assassin's Creed game was about three years. That game ended up being Assassin's Creed Unity (development started around November of 2010, which was after the completion of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.) Assassin's Creed games usually take around two, two and a half, or rarely three years to complete it seems. In fact, Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Rogue was made in a little more than a year by Ubisoft Quebec instead of Ubisoft Montreal (with the exception of Rogue which Montreal did develop.) And as for who makes the games, Ubisoft Montreal almost every major entry of Assassin's Creed. Every game after the original Assassin's Creed was made by Ubisoft Montreal only (with the exception of Brotherhood and III where they had additional help.) The only ones they had no hand in making was Assassin's Creed Rogue and Assassin's Creed Syndicate.  Edit: Assassin's Creed Unity's development period was from around the completion of Brotherhood, which was around October 2010 to possibly around the end of the summer in 2014."
winnipegjets,3cce8s,Kilcona,2,Mon Jul 6 22:08:38 2015 UTC,"Sometimes they even add things a week before its release. Sometimes even a few days.    They have a super strict change request policy as the game is closer to release so that's very rare from my experiences. Primary changes would be things like attributes/balancing etc but even then the potential for knock on effects is typically not worth the risk.  Moving from the console world to more social games/mobile games, the one thing I like is the approval process to get a patch/update out for facebook/mobile games is relatively quick (only delay is iOS about 7-10 days a submission)   With consoles I remember we had a horrible bug on FIFA and we had a fix ready to go in about 2 days but it was a month later before it got through MS/Sony.  It's a shame sports games are so tied season start dates as it really does put a crunch on what you can fit in some years. When your core features are too buggy unfortunately the other features suffer as was the case with NHL 15.   In general gamers are so unforgiving and really don't care to understand more about why things can happen or go wrong, for starters, the people making the games are human - and get this - also make mistakes! I swear gamer entitlement will drive me out of the industry if anything does... even working on a bullshit slots bingo game now, we still get 60 year old grandmas telling me to shove the game up my ass because their bingo is rigged.  I can't even read any EA NHL threads on /r/hockey/ due to how obnoxious/circlejerky some of the comments are.  Well that turned into a long rant lol..."

winnipegjets,3cb53c,randylaheyjr,10,Mon Jul 6 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"Maurice throws weight behind youth movement  By: Tim Campbell Posted: 07/5/2015 9:24 PM  To this point in the off-season, and now we’re through the high-profile opening days of free agency, there are some clear openings in the Winnipeg Jets’ forward group.  Deals or signings could always be out there, but with every day that goes by, it seems more probable the Jets, among the two or three youngest teams in the 2014-15 NHL season, will fill those spots internally. Winnipeg Jets Head Coach Paul Maurice  When the real games start again in October, the organization’s youth movement and draft-and-develop mantra all land on one man’s plate — that of head coach Paul Maurice.  From his perch at the MTS Iceplex since Friday, Maurice has been observing the annual development camp, a full smorgasbord of the team’s future.  The Jets have introduced Mark Scheifele, Jacob Trouba and Adam Lowry with success in the last two seasons. More of that ""future"" may be coming more quickly, so it seemed a relevant question to ask the coach how he feels about the apparent escalation.  Especially given a healthy majority of NHL coaches are interested pretty much only in winning and not that much in development or daycare for young players, budding or not.  ""Exceptionally prepared for it and behind it 100 per cent,"" was Maurice’s opener to this question. ""I’m all for it when there are players to make that jump. And we have players. We have some good, veteran guys around, too. (Matt) Halischuk signed last week and (Anthony) Peluso, who are certainly going to come in and compete for those jobs.  ""Any young player who comes in and makes our team is going to have to beat somebody out for ice time.""  Maurice sees the three young players mentioned, and wants to add just-signed Alex Burmistrov to that group because he’s only 23.  ""Those players have come in and become a big part of... almost that second core of our team,"" the coach said. ""We’ve got Ladd, Wheeler, Stuart, Buff, Myers... so I think we have enough depth and strength there to buy time to have some of these young players come in and get their feet wet and produce.  ""When we can do that, we can look at our core as not being just three or four guys but maybe seven, eight or nine guys, and then I think you have a chance to get much better more quickly.  ""So here’s the short answer. In the NHL, we’re not drafting and developing as an end. We’re trying to take the exact shortest route to success without any shortcuts.  ""The manner in which we’ll do it is build your own, and I’m all for that.""  On this matter, keep in mind Maurice has coached 1,201 NHL games, so demographically, he’s more apt to fall into the aforementioned club that automatically looks skeptically at young players and isn’t prone to trusting them.  Maurice puts up both hands to this idea of lumping him into such a group.  ""I’m waving the flag for this,"" he said. ""It’s going to take some time but it’s the quickest way. There is no other way to do this. The only other way, I guess, is to trade all these good, young players and you might not get value back, and you’ve still then got to go out and overpay on the free-agent market. Most of those teams... the core of the teams that are winning were drafted by those teams.  ""They add pieces when they get to that final place, And then you see them win. Look at Chicago. They’re winning, but then they shed pieces because of the cap.  ""I’ve got a little longer horizon in view with this group... I think it’s our best chance to win at the end of the day. You put in the right kind of people to build the program and we’ve been at it for a long time — well, for me it’s only a year — but we’re not even at the next step.  ""For me, we’re trying to solidify what we’re doing.""  Maurice pondered the issue for a moment, then made the request that his next comment be the top of the story.  We made it the conclusion, because it sums up what he’s thinking, because it’s the takeaway from the conversation.  ""My expectation of our team winning is not going to lessen next year. It is not,"" he said. ""I expect the drivers of our team, our captains and that second core of Scheifele, Lowry, Trouba, Burmistrov... I expect us to be a better team next year than we were this year, regardless of the age of the players that come into our lineup.  ""I’d love to be able to say we’re going to be better and younger because it’s not a matter of being lucky here. I want to build something that has a legitimate chance of doing it year over year.  ""That’s the sign of getting better.""  tim.campbell@freepress.mb.ca"

Seems to me others here have Copp to replace Jimmy, and no other changes to be made down the middle. I guess he could kick out to the wing too, though."
winnipegjets,3cavmy,Harborcoat84,5,Mon Jul 6 17:03:08 2015 UTC,I think Petan may end up as a winger for us. PoMo seems set on keeping Lowry down the middle. I like to think of an Ehlers - Lowry - Petan line and grin like a mofo.
winnipegjets,3cavmy,ehr0c,2,Mon Jul 6 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"I think if you're looking at a guy to be 3C, Lowry's built a little better for it than Petan."
winnipegjets,3cavmy,HollowWiener,2,Mon Jul 6 20:36:58 2015 UTC,i would love to see that line.  Lowry in the middle makes sense cause he can throw his weight around if anyone bothers the smaller wingers.
winnipegjets,3cavmy,Hero_of_Brandon,3,Mon Jul 6 20:15:09 2015 UTC,:O  Then we could get a cheesy and over used name for them like The Triplets or That 70s Line.
winnipegjets,3cavmy,Harborcoat84,3,Mon Jul 6 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"I think that would be the first time a line was entirely Jets picks and not Atlanta picks or free agents, since only Scheifele, Trouba and Lowry have made the team so far."
winnipegjets,3cavmy,S7833,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:45:51 2015 UTC,"God that makes me giddy. As of now, who's for sure gone? I know Jimmy and Fro are gone, but what about Perreault, Stempniak, and Tlusty? Haven't heard much about them since the season ended."
winnipegjets,3cavmy,Harborcoat84,4,Mon Jul 6 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"Perreault is signed for 2 more years, he won't be going anywhere until that deal is done and I hope he stays with us beyond that. Stempniak has not been pursued for re-signing according to Orlesky, to the surprise of many on this sub. I sincerely doubt Tlusty will return and I hope he doesn't, he didn't look all that great for us and we can use his spot for youth. Slater is about 95% gone, Jets said they may revisit with him depending on how free agency goes, but I feel like if we don't sign him he'll wind up on someone's AHL team."
winnipegjets,3cavmy,ComplexChristian,3,Mon Jul 6 17:16:11 2015 UTC,All I want is for Chevy to resign Stempy.
winnipegjets,3cavmy,pegcity,0,Mon Jul 6 20:18:53 2015 UTC,Or sign Semin for the same price?
winnipegjets,3cavmy,S7833,4,Tue Jul 7 15:38:47 2015 UTC,So there's still a chance!  I have $200 worth of Jets store gift cards that I received for my birthday at the beginning of June. I'm gonna hold off on buying a jersey until all camps are done to see who's coming up/sticking around.
winnipegjets,3cavmy,Harborcoat84,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:56:59 2015 UTC,Iirc there's a 7 game grace period where young guys can still be sent down after the season starts without burning a year off their contract. Ex Scheifele played 7 in 2011-12. So wait until the 8th game of the season just to be safe.
winnipegjets,3cavmy,S7833,3,Mon Jul 6 18:03:58 2015 UTC,"I had that on my mind as well.   I guess worst case scenario is that I get one early and go watch them play for the Moose with a Jets jersey. I'll be seeing far more Moose games than Jets games based off the pricing anyways!  Otherwise, I was debating getting a Myers or Scheifs jersey since they seem like safe, stable choices."
winnipegjets,3cavmy,salapeno,5,Mon Jul 6 18:05:15 2015 UTC,Whyyyy is the scrimmage during a business day when I have to work.
winnipegjets,3cavmy,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Mon Jul 6 14:29:32 2015 UTC,I'm just glad there were weekend dates I could check out. All the previous prospect camps were during the week. :(

winnipegjets,3cajdk,jesuswolf,2,Mon Jul 6 19:10:45 2015 UTC,I think his potential options would be:    Double old: 88 Birth year: 91 Flip recent: 96

winnipegjets,3c44nd,wpgjets92,2,Sun Jul 5 01:15:18 2015 UTC,Just a quick note Nik really gives away some Danish Patrick Kane vibes... After watching this I suddenly remembered about PKane's backhand playoff goal.
winnipegjets,3c44nd,ComplexChristian,2,Sun Jul 5 04:41:23 2015 UTC,haha man i was thinking literally the exact same thing. haven't seen a backhand like that since that ridiculously nonchalant kaner goal

winnipegjets,3c3ltp,ShittyForeplay,2,Sat Jul 4 16:02:04 2015 UTC,voat is fully shut down right now while they try to scale.  Snapzu is also barely usable as they get crushed by reddit traffic.  edit: looks like snapzu is down now as well
winnipegjets,3c3ltp,Hero_of_Brandon,6,Sat Jul 4 14:26:40 2015 UTC,"EnigmaticTortoise already snagged it.  I'm pretty much going down with the reddit ship if it sinks. I think our community is small enough that it doesn't have to be affected by all the major subreddit drama going on out there.  /r/hockey might be affected more than us, but then again people started complaining that the content dropped as the user base rose."
winnipegjets,3c3ltp,troyunrau,2,Sat Jul 4 14:51:27 2015 UTC,"Ya. Like I said, hopefully it won't come to a full migration and I'd certainly rather not have to move to a new platform.  I thought I should snag it though because iirc when the digg migration happened there were some trolls that grabbed and then held some of the smaller communities hostage.  I don't assume that would happen with winnipegjets but better safe than sorry."
winnipegjets,3c3ltp,Kilcona,3,Sat Jul 4 15:00:35 2015 UTC,"Ah digg. Good times.  I think reddit is having growth issues, more than anything else. Sometimes you get big subs like /r/hockey that grow organically to retain some semblance of intelligence and civility. But a lot of that is luck. We were lucky that the people that registered /r/hockey supported its growth and made good decisions. It could have gone the way of /r/atheism and collapsed under differences in opinions on how to run the place. We could have /r/truehockey, /r/realhockey, /r/hockeychat, and etc. with different mods and different posting rules fracturing the community. This has happened in so many other subs as they grew.   Anyway, I hope there isn't a migration for the well moderated subs (including /r/hockey and company). I like it here!"

winnipegjets,3c3scu,TheFlappyGiraffe,4,Sun Jul 5 20:45:52 2015 UTC,"That's good to know! They're most probably Filipinos that were born here and their families migrated here decades ago so hockey became infused with them.

Last year, a movement started to codify the rules and make the game more consistent. This is the second year the Pro Kabaddi League will exist for.   It's basically like a crazy Red Rover type game. One player (or Raider) crosses the middle line and has to try and tag one of the defenders. Once the raider has tagged one of the defenders, they do need to get back across the middle line. Once tagged, the defenders try to wrestle the raider down and stop them from crossing. What makes it even crazier, is that the raider has to do this all on one breath. Once they inhale again their attack is done.   if you're interested, here is a link to the Pro Kabaddi site."

winnipegjets,3c3scu,salapeno,4,Sun Jul 5 01:28:35 2015 UTC,I delivered a treadmill to Slater's house August and he didn't help me put it downstairs. Though I think he had surgery last year?

winnipegjets,3c3scu,IronRook,3,Sun Jul 5 16:22:57 2015 UTC,trouba had sex with my cousin. She said he was nice so there is that
winnipegjets,3c3scu,ComplexChristian,4,Sun Jul 5 20:24:28 2015 UTC,"He wasn't rude or anything too bad, he just seemed into his own shit and sort of  awkward and off putting."
winnipegjets,3c3scu,Isomniac,3,Sun Jul 5 06:55:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a goalie. They're all kind of weird, awkward, and in their own heads, just some are better at hiding it than others."
winnipegjets,3c3scu,cgwinnipeg,4,Sun Jul 5 18:13:27 2015 UTC,"Don't I know it, on of my best friends is a goalie and he's weird as fuck."
winnipegjets,3c3scu,paularlington,7,Sun Jul 5 19:17:21 2015 UTC,I can definitely see Hutch being a little weird.
winnipegjets,3c3scu,IronRook,6,Sun Jul 5 03:23:57 2015 UTC,I was pretty impressed with Lemieux today. That Buffalo trade keeps looking better and better.
winnipegjets,3c3scu,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Sat Jul 4 22:17:39 2015 UTC,"Lemieux looked especially good for me. He was seemingly focused and constantly talking between drills. I remember him and Roslovic were running a 2 on 1 drill together and it didn't quite set up for them, after they got back in line Lemieux looked at Roslovic and says ""That was my bad""... He stayed late with Petan shooting around after practice and they stayed even later signing autographs for the kids.  Lemieux is 6'1, 210lbs and it's hard to find a guy out there on the ice that looks more ready for the big club"
winnipegjets,3c3scu,Disgruntled_moose,7,Mon Jul 6 02:58:32 2015 UTC,"Plus, we used that pick on Roslovic!"
winnipegjets,3c3scu,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Sat Jul 4 23:39:39 2015 UTC,Which players from the camp do you think will make the cut this year? I'll go with Ehlers and Copp.
winnipegjets,3c3scu,Spencie-cat,2,Sat Jul 4 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"Ehlers, Copp, and Lemieux"
winnipegjets,3c3scu,mysticsavage,6,Sun Jul 5 19:58:19 2015 UTC,Ehlers plz
winnipegjets,3c3scu,Spencie-cat,2,Sun Jul 5 11:44:42 2015 UTC,all of them
winnipegjets,3c3scu,mysticsavage,5,Sat Jul 4 23:35:07 2015 UTC,I was hoping Petan to 3rd line center with Lowry centering the 4th but oh well.    I say Ehlers and Copp too
winnipegjets,3c3scu,Becau5eRea5on5,6,Sat Jul 4 15:19:43 2015 UTC,"If shuffles continues to improve we may see Petan as trade bait. Lits is locked up long term, Scheifele is our golden boy. Lowry is a really good 3C.  Petan may have to be a winger if he wants to stay here."
winnipegjets,3c3scu,mysticsavage,2,Sat Jul 4 16:25:32 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that we would trade him. Petan is spectacular. If anything, we'd ship Lowry before Petan."
winnipegjets,3c3scu,mysticsavage,6,Sat Jul 4 17:34:53 2015 UTC,Unless maybe Scheifele centers the top line with Ladd and Wheels and then Lits can go back to his natural wing with Petan centering that line.

winnipegjets,3c19jm,WpgMikos,2,Fri Jul 3 21:01:30 2015 UTC,Chatted about:  First impressions of camp.  Reactions to free agency signings/departure of Frolik.  What does he watch for from a guy like Ehlers this week?  His conversation with Burmistrov at the World Championship.  Role that Burmistrov can fill.  His thoughts on his assistant coaches and how they became “his guys”.  First impressions on Brendan Lemieux.  How much has he watched of what other NHL teams are doing during off season.  His responsibility to welcome all the draft picks (not just the top picks).  Measuring the Jets against the Stanley Cup playoff teams.
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,PinkyRingChamp,6,Fri Jul 3 14:04:28 2015 UTC,"I love Myers and I'm a big fan of Stafford's, but this is the guy I'm most excited about from that Kane/Bogo trade."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,sneezypenguin,4,Fri Jul 3 14:07:23 2015 UTC,"I have big hopes for Lemieux, but Myers won me over in the 2nd half of last season."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,dejour,3,Fri Jul 3 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"Please don't get me wrong, Myers is the piece that made the trade. Getting him will be the feather in Chevy's hat....until Lemieux becomes the piece that we build around in four or five years."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,sneezypenguin,3,Fri Jul 3 21:20:12 2015 UTC,I'd love it if Lemieux can become a huge piece for the Jets.  I just thought that Myers was delivering at an all-star level.  If Lemieux can exceed that level of impact it will be an amazing trade.
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,dejour,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:28:29 2015 UTC,"That's where the trade becomes genius! Wait and see. If Lemieux pans out, that trade will be historic."

winnipegjets,3bzsq6,akkuzo,5,Sat Jul 4 13:48:29 2015 UTC,"Wow! I was thinking to myself an hour ago, I wonder if he'd sign with us, since he refused to sign in Buffalo."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,Harborcoat84,4,Fri Jul 3 16:12:23 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that he was hoping to sign with a Canadian team on the upswing. Kind of picky of him, but hey, if it worked out then I can't really fault him."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,salapeno,3,Fri Jul 3 18:00:40 2015 UTC,That's kind of weird.  He was born in the US and would have lived there for several years.  I'm glad he's pro-Canadian - I just find it surprising.
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,dejour,3,Fri Jul 3 18:57:05 2015 UTC,"His dad's from Canada, though he's a naturalized U.S. citizen, and Brendan played with Canada for the IH18 in 2013. I think he probably just feels more connected to Canada. But who knows. I could be totally wrong."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,salapeno,3,Fri Jul 3 19:01:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it makes sense that he feels more connected to Canada.  Assuming he moved to Canada immediately after Claude retired in 2003, Brendan would have been 8.  And obviously he feels more connected to Canada otherwise he would have played for the US.  I'd just expect that he'd be positive about both places."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,dejour,3,Fri Jul 3 19:11:34 2015 UTC,Is Lemieux expected to make the big team this fall? I was expecting to see him one more year in jrs.
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,Mister_Kurtz,4,Fri Jul 3 14:34:43 2015 UTC,"Unless he is flat out amazing at camps, he'll be in Barrie again. Not old enough for the AHL yet so it's NHL or back to juniors."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,KillEmAll83,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"he could play 4th line if we don't get stemp back, Fraser could be his comp."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,Isomniac,3,Fri Jul 3 14:58:45 2015 UTC,He gets to play with Thorburn? He can only flourish.
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,Cannibalheart,4,Fri Jul 3 16:40:59 2015 UTC,"I think he was just signed now to an ELC because he refused to sign with the Sabres when he was with that organization, but his player rights were traded to us in the Kane deal. And I'm not too sure but I think you have a year or so to sign drafted players, if they're unsigned after a year or so they become UFAs. I think he'll be in the Jrs another year as well, he's too young for the AHL. But then again he is a big kid and can play on the Jets checking line.. Who knows. But to be honest I think he was just signed to an ELC before we lose his rights and nothing more.."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,watertattoo,5,Fri Jul 3 14:41:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you fail to sign a draftee, they re-enter the draft. The exception involves going through the NCAA, once you graduate from there you become a UFA."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Fri Jul 3 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"Yep. You have 2 years to sign your draftee. If you fail to sign and they are under 20, they can re-enter the draft. If over 20, they are a UFA.  I'm not sure if this is for NCAA too, I think it's different."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,KillEmAll83,2,Fri Jul 3 15:50:58 2015 UTC,There you go. Those are the actual rules lol
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,watertattoo,2,Fri Jul 3 16:47:26 2015 UTC,"I think it works the same with the NCAA, just you see UFA's a lot more because they're 22/23ish. By the time they graduate."
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,Becau5eRea5on5,4,Fri Jul 3 16:50:13 2015 UTC,He signed with us!!!  This kid is amazing in Barrie. I have a feeling he'll play on the fourth line. Maybe this is why Chevy hasn't resigned Stempy yet. Pls Chevy :(
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,ComplexChristian,2,Fri Jul 3 14:30:03 2015 UTC,Nice!!
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,RabbleRabble668,2,Fri Jul 3 14:04:59 2015 UTC,"Wow I was sure the consensus was he had a year or two of development to do, let's hope he is a chip off the ol' block work ethic wise"

winnipegjets,3bzsq6,DylMac,10,Fri Jul 3 14:44:24 2015 UTC,"""Love to play with him..hate to play against him"" that's all I can say lol"
winnipegjets,3bzsq6,watertattoo,3,Fri Jul 3 14:46:46 2015 UTC,Exactly. As long as he's helping the team and not like intentionally injuring other players (not that that's likely) then I'm all for him.

winnipegjets,3bzsq6,ComplexChristian,2,Fri Jul 3 17:15:48 2015 UTC,"Wasn't Kane sort of the same type of deal too? Only, he was more of an agitator after the whistle, and after the game. Hey yo!"

winnipegjets,3c07su,randylaheyjr,7,Fri Jul 3 16:11:12 2015 UTC,I think you might as well post Moose stuff here. There's no way you can get enough interest in a standalone AHL subreddit to keep it sustainable.

winnipegjets,3c0iqx,UpVotes4Worst,3,Fri Jul 3 18:41:29 2015 UTC,I want these young guys to make the cut and play the regular season because I am greedy for the future.

winnipegjets,3bzw41,IronRook,4,Fri Jul 3 15:18:46 2015 UTC,Well the good thing is they might be able to work with Dusty Imoo who is the goaltending coach for the Moose/Ice Caps and from what i've heard is he has worked wonders with our prospects.
winnipegjets,3bzw41,pinkpools,6,Fri Jul 3 15:25:45 2015 UTC,Super disappointed that Wade Flaherty still works for the Jets. I wonder if they'll replace him with St. Croix if our tendy troubles continue.
winnipegjets,3bzw41,Harborcoat84,5,Fri Jul 3 16:10:32 2015 UTC,I can see St. Croix being next in line
winnipegjets,3bzw41,pinkpools,5,Fri Jul 3 16:12:48 2015 UTC,"He discovered Helley, he should be able to mentor him too."
winnipegjets,3bzw41,rookie-mistake,3,Fri Jul 3 16:32:52 2015 UTC,"YAY YAY booo  glad to see St Croix added at least, not that comfortable with Flaherty as goaltending coach moving forward"
winnipegjets,3bzw41,Cannibalheart,0,Fri Jul 3 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"Flaherty sucks but, he can't make the saves. Pavelec is playing the best he ever has and Hutch...is not meeting the fanbase expectation but, who says he is good? Boston didn't sign him for a reason.   Hellebuyk is the real test here."
winnipegjets,3bzw41,csobral,4,Fri Jul 3 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"Well, those of us who watched him last year know Hutchinson is actually a great goalie and he's young enough that he should only improve.   He might not make those flashy 180-degree stick saves or whatever you see on goalie highlight reels, but that's because his positioning is one of his strong suits, unlike Pavelec. It's rare that Hutchinson puts himself in a position to have to move a lot in order to make a save. When he gets beat, it's often from a deflection or an odd-man rush that wasn't his fault.  Edit: also, wasn't trying to rag on Pavelec, he had a great season overall. I just meant Pavelec probably stands out more to some fans because some of his saves are more impressive than Hutchison's, but often because Pavelec's poor positioning forced him into a spectacular save."
winnipegjets,3bzw41,Cannibalheart,0,Fri Jul 3 20:04:30 2015 UTC,"There are goals scored on Hutch where he was not even in the crease, that is not being in position.  There is a strange love fest for a backup goalie that lost his starting gig by allowing 4 goals on 7 shots.  Is he an OK rookie, yes.  But he won't be here long.  Our depth is way too strong."
winnipegjets,3bzw41,csobral,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:19:02 2015 UTC,"No, I'd say the hate fest is what's strange. It's easy to look at a single stat and draw a conclusion on a goalie's abilities without actually watching the game and seeing how those goals happened. How is a goalie supposed to save a 3 on 1 against a good team? If the defense in front of Hutch collapses, he can't be the only one to blame.  It's cool, though. Looking at a stat and commenting without watching is always easier.  Edit: and to be clear, I don't think he will be better than either of our prospects once they all reach their peak, but he's still more than capable of being a starting goalie, we're just extremely lucky Chevy and his scouts draft so well."

winnipegjets,3bx1b2,rookie-mistake,5,Thu Jul 2 21:38:47 2015 UTC,I maintain that he has written a script that takes the feed from twitter and puts it into submit form. Then all he has to do is watch the queue and press submit on the ones that are relevant.  That's mainly because he's been non-stop for months now.
winnipegjets,3bx1b2,Hero_of_Brandon,4,Thu Jul 2 23:25:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at the start the ""oh grizzy so fast"" circlejoke was kind of funny but at this point..

winnipegjets,3bxp8g,brock0791,2,Fri Jul 3 01:23:49 2015 UTC,Not sure where they'll place him but I don't see them sitting him on a bench 3/4 of the season
winnipegjets,3bxp8g,KillEmAll83,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:26:05 2015 UTC,"He will go to the ECHL if anything. Can't see them sending him back to the WHL for another season.  That way, if he's killing it in the ECHL they can move him up to the A. Gives the team a lot more control over his development."
winnipegjets,3bxp8g,brock0791,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:43:04 2015 UTC,"I did a little research. Some guys go the ECHL route, some guys go the overage junior route. Interestingly Carey Price did it with tri-city."

winnipegjets,3bxp8g,brock0791,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:08:15 2015 UTC,"I like this. It's a good problem to have - so many good goalies. I think an ideal scenario would see Pavelec have another strong season upping his trade value, maybe pick up some draft picks for him next off season. Then have Hellebuyck and Hutch duke it out for starter in 2016-2017 with Phillips and Comrie playing for the moose. Not sure where Olkinoura fits in, maybe he's better than I give him credit for."
winnipegjets,3bxp8g,brock0791,2,Mon Jul 6 05:43:21 2015 UTC,Come to terms with the fact Pavelec isn't going anywhere just hope Hutch gets showcased enough and holds down a save % over .915 until Halak falls off a cliff and the Isles need a servicable cost controlled goalie.
winnipegjets,3bxp8g,brock0791,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:37:54 2015 UTC,I like Pavelec. I just think he won't be resigning here after his contract is up so if you can get something for him great. It's kind of like what happened with Frolik. I'd have liked it if he resigned but we couldn't do anything long-term because of what was coming up the pipe. It's just too bad we lost him and got nothing in return. Same thing goes for Pavs you'd have to think
winnipegjets,3bxp8g,mysticsavage,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:46:34 2015 UTC,You didn't get nothing in return for Frolik you got a round of playoffs
winnipegjets,3bxp8g,mysticsavage,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:03:44 2015 UTC,Also since we're not up against the cap in the next 2 years I'd rather get a 2nd or 3rd round pick for hutch than nothing for pav even if you could move him if Hellebucyk is ready to start for 2017

Also the Avs definitely got worse since they lost ROR and signed Beauchemin to a 3 year deal even though he is 35.
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,ComplexChristian,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:14:30 2015 UTC,Troy Brouwer is a notorious Jets killer though. Lol!
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,jesuswolf,2,Fri Jul 3 11:59:57 2015 UTC,"Well said. A team like the Jets doesn't have to go make a bunch of big deals to improve this upcoming season. We've got a young team with prospects ready to move up and current roster players who are always improving (Scheifele, Trouba, Lowry, etc.).   Keep in mind, last season was Maurice's first year in charge, and the Jets even had a really rough start to the season and were playing catch-up from the start. That won't happen this time.  Also, we only had Myers and Stafford for the last run of the season. Now we have them from training camp. Burmistrov is a wild card but could be a huge ""addition"" as well.  Finally, I'd like to think we won't miss so many clutch players for so many games due to injuries again.   I'm with you, homie. Jets will win the Central division, or at LEAST grab 2nd for home ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs."
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,KillEmAll83,7,Fri Jul 3 06:25:47 2015 UTC,At least Oshie left the Central
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,verify_deez_nuts,3,Fri Jul 3 21:40:02 2015 UTC,"Matt Fraser to the Jets on a two-way deal. I'm still hoping they'll resign Stempy, if not I will be really really sad.  WE WANT PAUL RUDD"
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,RabbleRabble668,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:39:20 2015 UTC,Cormier also re-signed
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,klevenisms204,2,Thu Jul 2 21:36:16 2015 UTC,Wow TJ Oshie to the Caps.

winnipegjets,3bvpg0,Spencie-cat,5,Thu Jul 2 21:03:00 2015 UTC,PEN15 if he can convince the NHL to add letters.
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,Not_Jacob_Trouba,3,Thu Jul 2 18:06:27 2015 UTC,If 69 is not allowed then probably 96
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,Not_Jacob_Trouba,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:56:30 2015 UTC,"Probably 88 or something random, if 69 doesn't work out."
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,RabbleRabble668,2,Thu Jul 2 18:40:40 2015 UTC,"If the Jets don't let him wear 69, I'm not sure. There are lower numbers like 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 available. He could just double up his old number 8 and go for 88."
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,the__funk,4,Thu Jul 2 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like 69 should be as available as every other number. That being said, I won't be surprised if Chevy and/or Maurice say ""you're and adult, wear whatever number you want; but we would prefer that you not wear 69 because of its connotations."" and then use his choice it as a gauge of his maturity."
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,RabbleRabble668,10,Thu Jul 2 18:14:03 2015 UTC,I feel like 69 should be reserved for Grant Clitsome. Because I am an adult.
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,ComplexChristian,4,Thu Jul 2 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"That's a great way of looking at it. However, this entire sub will be very disappointed if he doesn't end up wearing #69"
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,salapeno,2,Thu Jul 2 22:31:03 2015 UTC,well then.. why not 82.. 2 being the #2 time he wore 8?
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,ComplexChristian,3,Thu Jul 2 21:55:48 2015 UTC,anyone else very curious to see how Burmi does? I'm hoping he's a solid ~30 point guy but most of all I hope he has grown up a lot and is ready to improve defensively and help us improve as a team.
winnipegjets,3bvpg0,IronRook,4,Thu Jul 2 18:15:24 2015 UTC,We will know by how many times he is spotted at Green Room in the fall.

winnipegjets,3brwib,ShittyForeplay,7,Wed Jul 1 17:41:32 2015 UTC,Worth noting we may still sign Stempniak for the bottom 6. That would be a huge depth signing imo
winnipegjets,3brwib,ciera22,2,Wed Jul 1 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"Jets haven't talked to Stempniak at all yet, but apparently might revisit."

winnipegjets,3brwib,ShittyForeplay,3,Wed Jul 1 18:10:39 2015 UTC,agreed. stemp is a nice piece to have if shit hits the fan again like last year. cheap too

winnipegjets,3brwib,MilHaus2000,7,Wed Jul 1 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"Copp is ready for sure, he's been playing with older guys for a while. He is also 6'1 and 200 pounds around, plays a very complete game."
winnipegjets,3brwib,Harborcoat84,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:04:28 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how the rest of free agency and then training camp pans out. We may land someone else today, we may even go back to Slater (unlikely)."

winnipegjets,3bt58n,Sweaty_Legs,2,Thu Jul 2 05:14:20 2015 UTC,IM HYPED AS FUCK
winnipegjets,3bt58n,watertattoo,-1,Thu Jul 2 05:59:08 2015 UTC,"Hope he has a good season and all works well, but for the sake of God.. Please don't bring that number here (though it would be funny for the fans)..As a professional athlete's standpoint"
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,jordan102398,6,Wed Jul 1 20:41:03 2015 UTC,"I think the Jets will give serious consideration to Ehlers, I believe Chevy said he thought he was ready to play at an NHL level. I think Petan will play for the Moose this season unless he has a spectacular camp."
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,supercantaloupe,6,Wed Jul 1 20:45:30 2015 UTC,Well we will still get to see him play on the moose. Awesome that we can see our prospects develop now
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,rookie-mistake,8,Wed Jul 1 22:06:14 2015 UTC,"I'm so pumped for that. Petan and Hellebuyck and Morrissey, its so exciting"
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,1337nerd,5,Wed Jul 1 23:13:25 2015 UTC,"Ya, petan will probably play on the moose for at least a year. Lets him play top 6 minutes and develop"
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,EnigmaticTortoise,2,Wed Jul 1 21:19:24 2015 UTC,Ehlers doesn't want to play in the CHL again and there's nothing more he can really gain from doing so. His only other option then would be to go play a year in Europe somewhere
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,Harborcoat84,6,Thu Jul 2 02:28:14 2015 UTC,I am 90% certain Ehlers will make it now. There's a spot on the third line with his name on it.
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,Cannibalheart,3,Wed Jul 1 22:05:07 2015 UTC,"Second line. Perault, Shief, Ehlers."
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,jesuswolf,3,Thu Jul 2 15:51:45 2015 UTC,HNNNGGGG
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,MontanaCelt,5,Thu Jul 2 17:46:32 2015 UTC,I got to watch Petan here a few times in Portland. He's got crazy speed and good on the skates. Would like to see him up and compete at a higher level.
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,xbones2,3,Thu Jul 2 02:38:50 2015 UTC,Totally agree - I saw him in Kelowna during last year and this year's playoffs. Really fast and is in the right place to make plays.
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,jesuswolf,4,Thu Jul 2 05:28:51 2015 UTC,"It obviously depends on coaching and management. But I really hope Ehlers makes the squad. He could really light it up I think. I say that Ehlers breaks the squad over Petan. That being said I hope they both make it. It'll be interesting to see what happens, I'm excited for Robo-Copp! The Moose/Jets are going to be solid in a few years!"
winnipegjets,3bsn8r,Willyq25,2,Wed Jul 1 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"Ehlers for sure will get a solid try-out and wouldnt be surprised at all to see him dress on the 3rd line with some 2nd unit PP action. Petan will get a look but prob not hold, more likely Copp who would be a solid 4th line centre."
winnipegjets,3bs1hw,ShittyForeplay,4,Wed Jul 1 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"Kinda disappointed , I always liked O'Dell. Hopefully he can make their roster!"
winnipegjets,3bs1hw,rookie-mistake,2,Wed Jul 1 18:07:18 2015 UTC,"Man I really hope he gets consisten NHL time, I feel like we didnt trust him to plug our  injury holes near as much  as he deserved  that said IDGAF BURMIS BACK WOOOOOOOOO"
winnipegjets,3bs1hw,ComplexChristian,2,Wed Jul 1 18:51:57 2015 UTC,HAPPY BURMI DAY

winnipegjets,3bs1hw,KillEmAll83,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:17:02 2015 UTC,"He was a UFA and is from Ottawa, so he probably wanted to go home. Can't blame him!  I feel like the Jets never gave him a fair shot at the NHL level and I wish they had. Hope he sees more icetime in Ottawa."
winnipegjets,3bs1hw,Not_Jacob_Trouba,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:49:35 2015 UTC,Happy to see him get a chance with another team. The guy was an AHL tweener with us.

winnipegjets,3brlqs,Bernden,3,Wed Jul 1 17:29:53 2015 UTC,Halischuk has as much hussle as any single player on the Jets. He's an excellent fourth line player for generating offense.

winnipegjets,3brtcj,biga204,3,Wed Jul 1 17:11:10 2015 UTC,I have no issue with this. It's 5 years. I  4-5 years when the dollar is still low and the cap hasn't really gone up because of it Calgary will be begging teams to take him.

winnipegjets,3brf9p,Not_Jacob_Trouba,2,Wed Jul 1 22:20:20 2015 UTC,Or have stempy on the 4tg and 3rd for injuries with a rookie on the 3rd
winnipegjets,3brf9p,Spencie-cat,2,Wed Jul 1 22:38:28 2015 UTC,"Ya I kinda figure ehlers with Lowry and burmi on third if he joins.  Then I guess stamper, copp and scoreburn 4th line"
winnipegjets,3brf9p,Not_Jacob_Trouba,2,Wed Jul 1 22:48:30 2015 UTC,I feel like we might have another morrisey situation with ehlers. Let the guy stagnate in the chl for another season or call him up to the big team when he might not be ready
winnipegjets,3brf9p,RabbleRabble668,2,Wed Jul 1 23:01:57 2015 UTC,Detroit is doing well so far..Mike Green and Brad Richards locked up.
winnipegjets,3brf9p,KillEmAll83,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:53:13 2015 UTC,I would've liked Mike Green but not for 6M a year.  If we can get a left-handed d-man I'll be happy. Unless they feel Morrissey will make the team.

winnipegjets,3brf9p,h0twired,2,Wed Jul 1 20:35:47 2015 UTC,Is 5 at 4.3 not a pretty reasonable contract?   I wonder if Fro didn't like how he was being used here.
winnipegjets,3brf9p,jesuswolf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:17:49 2015 UTC,"4.3's not bad, but 5 years is a long commitment for us. If he underperformed that would be a hard contract to move."
winnipegjets,3brf9p,Isomniac,3,Wed Jul 1 22:13:32 2015 UTC,"I assume that Chevy has other plans for 3 years from now, in the way of Ehlers, Petan, Armia, Connor, Roslovic, and Harkins. Hell, I'll even throw in Lemieux, Foley, and De Leo. We're going to be fine, but 2015-16 could get rough."
winnipegjets,3brf9p,jesuswolf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:25:10 2015 UTC,"This should be the top comment.  The last thing the Jets need is a long-term contract on someone like Frolik.  Just look at the other signings.  Stafford, Chiarot, Peluso and Burmi all for 2 years each.  Chevy is looking to his young guys for 2017/2018.  The Jets are going to look VERY different 2-3 years from now."
winnipegjets,3brf9p,cgwinnipeg,2,Sun Jul 5 20:38:02 2015 UTC,Yeah. Last year was supposed to be rough under Chevy's plan and it was the best year so far.  I agree that at 5 year 4.3 it makes sense for it to be Chevy choosing not to sign it rather than not being able to spend that much on him.
winnipegjets,3brf9p,jesuswolf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:30:15 2015 UTC,Must have been that. But he was on the first line for a while...and he's killer on the PK :(

winnipegjets,3brf9p,Harborcoat84,3,Wed Jul 1 17:10:39 2015 UTC,Too long a term.  No way Chevy would give him 5 years with our prospect depth.

winnipegjets,3bnzso,SparkyFehr,5,Tue Jun 30 19:37:24 2015 UTC,This is a 'I like what the future holds' kind of deal from Stafford. I think this bodes well for where he thinks the program is headed in the immediate future. Cheers guys!
winnipegjets,3bnzso,I_am_a_zebra,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:52:36 2015 UTC,Good point. If he doesn't play up to the contact we can let one of our prospects get a chance. If he plays well he could come back as a good veteran presence for the kids on our cup run.
winnipegjets,3bnzso,p_qrs_t,2,Tue Jun 30 22:01:19 2015 UTC,I heard 8.7mil. So 4.35 AAV
winnipegjets,3bnzso,cgwinnipeg,5,Tue Jun 30 19:27:41 2015 UTC,Perfect deal for the Jets  All the salty Sabres fans in the r/hockey thread make it even sweeter
winnipegjets,3bnzso,p_qrs_t,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:13:13 2015 UTC,Why are they salty?
winnipegjets,3bnzso,salapeno,2,Tue Jun 30 20:36:15 2015 UTC,"Who knows, all they can do is complain about how much of an overpayment this is.  Maybe they are sour that the trade with them is now clearly in our favour"
winnipegjets,3bnzso,EnigmaticTortoise,3,Tue Jun 30 20:38:36 2015 UTC,"Eh, we can't say clearly until two things happen:   1 is we see how the prospects we got shake out in the NHL. If neither Armia or Lemieux ever play on our NHL roster, that takes away from our side a bit.   2 is waiting to see how E Kane shakes out with the change of scenery. I think we all expect him to be too busy texting on his moneyphone that he crashes into a goal post and goes down in flames, but there's a chance the kid grows up and works hard and turns into a franchise player for them. That would tilt things a bit more towards them.   It'll probably be a few years before we can definitively say who won or lost. And it could be both of us."

Nice to see the cap era is at least beginning to accept the value of advanced analytics."

winnipegjets,3bnzso,Hero_of_Brandon,3,Tue Jun 30 20:06:02 2015 UTC,"Yup. I feel similarly about this as I did the Jokinen signing... but at least we've seen Stafford play already, its less expensive and seriously he can not be as bad as Jokinen turned out to be"
winnipegjets,3bnzso,siempreloco31,2,Tue Jun 30 22:58:05 2015 UTC,He can be parked on the third line if he doesn't pan out/a young guy really steps up
winnipegjets,3bnzso,theamazingchris,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:48:26 2015 UTC,~4 mil for 3rd liners isn't the best way to play the GM game but the term is fine. Basically Jokinen 2.0

Keep in mind that he's the 19th highest scorer in the league over the last 3 years.  17th Malkin, 18th Perry, 20th Stamkos  Trading him for Pacioretty might be fair since Pacioretty has a really good contract.  $4.8 million the next several years versus Wheeler's $5.8 million.  Wheeler is 6'5"" and speedy though.  He kills penalties.  I'm not sure that everything he does is captured in the stats.  I guess Wheeler for Pacioretty would be fair and both fanbases would feel like they made a bad trade."

Hoping we can get Stempniak back to fill the 4th line hole and he could be the one to move up the lineup in case of injury instead of Thorbs.  Hopefully a deal with Burmi can be fleshed out in the next few days.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,IronRook,2,Tue Jun 30 20:15:04 2015 UTC,I hear Jim can play right wing.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Not_Jacob_Trouba,2,Tue Jun 30 23:09:15 2015 UTC,"I got some bad news for you man, I don't think Jimmy will be back."
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Xanick,3,Wed Jul 1 00:11:46 2015 UTC,I'm in denial.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Not_Jacob_Trouba,6,Wed Jul 1 01:09:39 2015 UTC,I really want Stempniak back
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,HollowWiener,2,Tue Jun 30 21:13:13 2015 UTC,You don't think maybe Armia might be able to fill his role?
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,IronRook,2,Tue Jun 30 21:17:58 2015 UTC,I mean maybe but why pass up a proven guy that we could get for a reasonable price for an unknown quantity.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,HollowWiener,5,Tue Jun 30 21:49:51 2015 UTC,"The more I hear about these other teams buyouts, the more I appreciate Chevy's non-overpayment for contracts.  Even if it means not signing Frolik or Stafford."

winnipegjets,3bi1tt,MaplePoutineRyeBeer,2,Tue Jun 30 19:58:06 2015 UTC,Can we slap a big ol picture of Chevy wheeling and dealing somewhere on this sub?
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,crazye97,6,Wed Jul 1 00:13:50 2015 UTC,Ok I just had this horrible realization that the bruins essentially traded away their Trouba for 2 off the board selections in the first round.  I would cry.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,sneezypenguin,6,Tue Jun 30 17:37:15 2015 UTC,"It's a times like this I'm thankful we have a competent GM, and not one who traded Teemu Selanne for Oleg Teverdovsky, sold off Kris Draper for $1, and selected Jimmy Mann in the first round (yes, i realize these are all different GMs, but you get the idea)."
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,KillEmAll83,3,Tue Jun 30 19:16:32 2015 UTC,"I remember this subreddit was freaking out on UFA day last year (and the year before) because the Jets weren't being splashy. Chevy has proven that he's among the top GMs in the NHL, he knows exactly what he's doing.. and he wouldn't pull moves like Sweeny did.. thank goodness!"

Early-mid September is the Young Stars tournament in BC and I think the main camp starts around that time too. Late September will be pre-season.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,verify_deez_nuts,3,Tue Jun 30 14:53:20 2015 UTC,"Michael Spacek (4th round pick) will very likely be re-drafted in the CHL import draft today (starts in about 15 minutes here). He was drafted last year by the Medicine Hat Tigers but they didn't protect his rights.  Seems like he is wanting to come over this season, so it'll be much easier for us to keep tabs on him. :)"

winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:27:30 2015 UTC,I thought he was pissed off because he didn't make the NHL team again. I thought we suspended him because of it.

winnipegjets,3bi1tt,crazy_canucklehead,2,Mon Jun 29 20:30:14 2015 UTC,You need to wear your pet on your head during games for good luck as well.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Becau5eRea5on5,7,Tue Jun 30 14:48:47 2015 UTC,I think you can still hate Ron Hainsey.  It's weird that we don't really hate anyone on our team.

winnipegjets,3bi1tt,RabbleRabble668,3,Mon Jun 29 21:22:21 2015 UTC,"Ill go Pavelec. Kane seems like a cool dude, and Pav had an OUI and stuff. Stafford is going to be a UFA too, cant blame him."
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,salapeno,5,Mon Jun 29 21:38:47 2015 UTC,but you can want him to not sign because he's bad
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,SternSternButFair,4,Mon Jun 29 21:40:24 2015 UTC,"Hate the contract, not the player homie. If he signs a bad contract, thats on Chevy"
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Harborcoat84,3,Mon Jun 29 21:45:36 2015 UTC,If he signs for more than 4M I will hate everything.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,deus216,3,Mon Jun 29 21:49:42 2015 UTC,"Well, Frolik is not coming back, that's pretty much guaranteed. We never do much in FA... I'm just hoping we can keep Stempniak, extend Ladd and Buff, and have some of our young guys come up."
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,kingofspoonerisms,3,Mon Jun 29 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"Stempniak is a solid depth guy, and I would see what you could get for Buff - the Jets are one team that has a lot of solid RHD, and for an aging D like Buff, could probably get a haul. Detroit is almost always looking for them.  In my mind, the worst thing a GM can do is let assets walk for nothing. Its why I was okayish with the Bruins moving Boychuk and Lucic."
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,jesuswolf,2,Mon Jun 29 21:08:27 2015 UTC,let assets walk for nothing   Sorta like Frolik? :(

winnipegjets,3bi1tt,kapacj,8,Mon Jun 29 20:19:52 2015 UTC,I think at this point we could do a straight up Pav for Rask trade and Sweeney would eat it up.

He would come cheap, still fairly young and has upside if he can get his stuff together. He's a right handed shot so he could play RW for us (our position in need/take some of the pressure off him since his natural position is centre)  perhaps even on the top line with Little + Ladd. I think just last year he was playing winger for Canada at the IIHF world championships and played pretty well. What's your guys opinion?"
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:49:11 2015 UTC,He's awful in his own end and has attitude problems. Not interested.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:57:08 2015 UTC,Oh god I think that we should definitely stay away from that contract of his. Money is so important to us since we can't spend to the cap.

winnipegjets,3bi1tt,RabbleRabble668,2,Tue Jun 30 10:50:39 2015 UTC,Word is he is really slow. Speed is one of our strengths and don't think we should concede that
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,ComplexChristian,7,Mon Jun 29 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"About Frolik, I'm not angry about him leaving UFA.  Yet.  He played well for us and If he can get paid Bolland money, hey, who can blame him.  So we wait and see how much he'll get paid, but if it's around 4M?  Then I'll be pissed.  But not yet.  We'll see."
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,GRiZZY19,2,Mon Jun 29 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"With the UFA crop this year being so weak, Frolik is going to get PAID, and I dont think Chevy is going to drop Bolland money on him so I think hes gone, which will suck. Frolik is criminally underrated, theres going to be those games next year that will make us all say ""I miss Frolik"". Im fine with anything under 5M, and Im not sold on Stafford, so hopefully if Chevy does make a big July 1 signing, it will be for Frolik instead of Stafford."
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,weesstt,6,Tue Jun 30 10:02:59 2015 UTC,I heard from an unreliable source (my imagination) that Jimmy wantd to sign 2 years at $1M.  This sound like the best deal out there and we should do that immediately.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Disgruntled_moose,3,Mon Jun 29 16:28:37 2015 UTC,What about Copp? Doesn't have three years left at 850k or something like that?

winnipegjets,3bi1tt,IronRook,3,Mon Jun 29 21:02:40 2015 UTC,That would be a steal and a half! Holy crap!
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,ehr0c,7,Mon Jun 29 17:36:26 2015 UTC,Fuckin fuck Fro?!  Guess we're gonna be seeing a Burmi announcement anytime soon. I'd love to see him back wearing #69. It's hilarious.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,IronRook,3,Mon Jun 29 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"Ehlers will be good down the road, but its gonna hurt a lot in the short term if they lose Frolik. Dammit Fro, please stay :("

winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Mon Jun 29 14:04:49 2015 UTC,Woo! Party!  Safegrard was such a solid time for me. I didn't even drink  (though I should have)
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,cgwinnipeg,2,Mon Jun 29 21:56:12 2015 UTC,What the fuck is a safe grad?
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Becau5eRea5on5,5,Tue Jun 30 01:00:18 2015 UTC,It's a thing we do (in my hometown anyway) where you put on a huge party for all your grads. The only real difference is that everyone has to be picked up by a sober person (I think you had to predetermined who was picking you up. Can't remember though). Slightly less freedom than a normal party because there are teachers and some parents around but they let you get as shit faced as you want.  It cuts down on dumb 18 year olds making dumb 18 year old drunken decisions with regards to driving home and getting them or someone else killed.  Also allows for a bar atmosphere without leaving out all the kids who aren't yet 18.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Harborcoat84,2,Tue Jun 30 01:40:28 2015 UTC,"That seems... Very sensible. I'm not sure I would have wanted that for myself, especially since I wasn't 18 when I graduated, but it is very sensible."
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,KillEmAll83,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:36:11 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on the school but everyone bought drinks for the underaged kids at mine and no one cared.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,ehr0c,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:17:31 2015 UTC,My safe grad was a bunch of fresh 18 year olds getting hammered and throwing up all over the place and girls crying.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,ehr0c,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:18:50 2015 UTC,Yeah it probably wouldn havre been very enjoyable for anyone who wasn't 18 and wanted to drink.  I turned 18 like a week before mine.  Solid timing.

winnipegjets,3bi1tt,cgwinnipeg,2,Mon Jun 29 14:26:20 2015 UTC,Do we really need to make any signings outside of like stafford and stempniak? We have so many prospects knocking on the door and with Burmi coming back I think we are set for next year.
winnipegjets,3bi1tt,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:23:37 2015 UTC,"I'd still prefer Tlusty over Stafford, but whatevs."

winnipegjets,3bi1tt,cgwinnipeg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:11:07 2015 UTC,"I won't disagree with that, but my feeling aside, Tlusty is the smarter signing. He had as any points as Stempy while playing on our 4th line and going through a slump, and would sign for at least 1.5M less than Stafford, all while bringing those sweet fancy stats."

It's hard enough at that stage to find anything of value that will help the big league club, so there's no sense lowering your odds further by reaching for a different player because of the position he plays.   The scouts picked the players they figured would have the best chance of developing into solid players, and if a few of them do, you can always find spots for them to fill, even if that means trading them for a player that fits a more pressing need."

Could be worse though, could be the leafs for half a century ;)  I'm just upset at effectively throwing away the prime of 2 of the best players in the league because of how fucked they are now. Bergeron and Rask don't deserve this shit."
winnipegjets,3bb286,lordderplythethird,4,Sat Jun 27 15:43:33 2015 UTC,"I blame dougie for wanting so much fucking money we couldn't sign him   Hamilton was apparently asking for a 5.5 AAV, Thats very reasonable. If they had not extended McQuaid for 2.75 and retained salary on Lucic they could have easily kept Hamilton.   could be the leafs for half a century   1 more cup than we have since the 70s. 2011 is all Bruins fans will have to cling to for the next decade under Sweeney ;)"
winnipegjets,3bb286,Hero_of_Brandon,2,Sat Jun 27 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"5.5 is what sweenie offered Hamilton though, and he walked out. Sweenies press conference a few min ago essentially said dougie wanted to go, and would of only accepted a kings ransom to stay. So we sold to get picks, because Arizona said they'd trade for their 3rd pick, which we were going to use for what's his name, and when we did the moves, Arizona bailed on it. Otherwise, we would of had Hamilton 2.0 and some freed up cap room to pick up a free agent to fill Lucic's slot, which Sharp was a major candidate for. Plus we would of actually had a reliable backup goalie while subban and McIntyre develop in the AHL.   Everyone knew Soderberg was gonna be gone, dude wanted 5+, more than marchand, while underperforming. Colorado was fucking stupid for that one IMO. Completely useless without Eriksson, and now Eriksson won't have to carry him.   We were so set until dougie, and then we found a way via Arizona, and they fucked us. Sigh. Oh well. At least LA highly over payed for Lucic lol"

winnipegjets,3b9bcz,clemoh,3,Sat Jun 27 01:26:56 2015 UTC,Very shrewd pick. He's got legitimate star potential. I'm surprised he was still on the board!
winnipegjets,3b9bcz,cgwinnipeg,3,Sat Jun 27 01:08:07 2015 UTC,I'm only worried a bit because he's a NCAA player so he might not stay with us but if he does then WOOO FUCK YES

winnipegjets,3b7ior,Harborcoat84,3,Fri Jun 26 17:21:20 2015 UTC,Probably in the vicinity of $5.5M.
winnipegjets,3b7ior,ehr0c,2,Fri Jun 26 17:41:33 2015 UTC,That sounds about right to me. I could deal with a little over that but under $6M.
winnipegjets,3b7ior,PolarOpposites8,3,Fri Jun 26 18:02:09 2015 UTC,And to think that Fro wants 6.

winnipegjets,3b7ior,Tsukubasteve,3,Fri Jun 26 19:33:30 2015 UTC,What are you guys all on? No way he signs for less than 6 million AAV. I'd be happy to get him at less than 7 million.
winnipegjets,3b7ior,deus216,3,Fri Jun 26 18:26:58 2015 UTC,Wheeler makes $5.6m AAV. I'd say that Ladd should be roughly equivalent. No way he makes $7m.
winnipegjets,3b7ior,IronRook,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:09:38 2015 UTC,On a contract that started several years ago. Ladd is going to make north of 6 million.
winnipegjets,3b7ior,deus216,3,Fri Jun 26 19:42:03 2015 UTC,Based on what?
winnipegjets,3b7ior,ehr0c,3,Fri Jun 26 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree. He's not an elite player, he's very consistant in his point totals but I don't see him making more than 6 million per year.  If he does it won't be by much."
winnipegjets,3b7ior,RabbleRabble668,2,Fri Jun 26 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"He's making $4.4m AAV right now and if we could keep him at that, that would be awesome. I'd hope that we wouldn't go over $5.5m AAV though. He'd probably want more than $6m."
winnipegjets,3b7ior,IronRook,3,Fri Jun 26 17:31:50 2015 UTC,"I could see him being more around $5m. I'd think that we'd get a bit of a ""discount"" here because he likes us."
winnipegjets,3b7ior,MilHaus2000,3,Fri Jun 26 17:39:10 2015 UTC,I don't think any of us would care if we gave him 5.
winnipegjets,3b7ior,IronRook,3,Fri Jun 26 17:46:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think I was kind of unclear.  I think he's worth more than 5, but that he'd settle for 5 for us."
winnipegjets,3b7ior,MilHaus2000,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:23:15 2015 UTC,In the ballpark of $5m
winnipegjets,3b7ior,itsfoosay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:09:33 2015 UTC,I'd be okay giving $6M to him.
winnipegjets,3b7ior,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:11:52 2015 UTC,"Hope they can lock him up for 5.5, but I'd bet he could get 6 or more if he went UFA."

The top article was about one of the players being 'risque' by wearing that number. The article went on about hockey players being gentlemen and morals etc... I think it's one of those numbers people assume it won't be taken seriously because of its connotation that's completely unrelated to hockey (or anything not sex), but yeah...I think it's more of a maturity issue with some people over anything else."

winnipegjets,3b79k1,ehr0c,2,Sat Jun 27 00:43:53 2015 UTC,Seems like there is going to be a lot of good picks available to us.
winnipegjets,3b79k1,ComplexChristian,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:42:45 2015 UTC,This draft seems so good right now.
winnipegjets,3b79k1,I_am_a_zebra,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:44:06 2015 UTC,Did Boston just draft Malcolm in the Middle?
winnipegjets,3b79k1,ShittyForeplay,2,Sat Jun 27 00:42:20 2015 UTC,And Boston just keeps being weird today.
winnipegjets,3b79k1,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:42:08 2015 UTC,Why does Florida hate Boston?
winnipegjets,3b79k1,ComplexChristian,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:41:30 2015 UTC,EVERYONE HATES BOSTON
winnipegjets,3b79k1,ShittyForeplay,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:42:54 2015 UTC,That's kind of true. But still I find it weird that they would boo them.
winnipegjets,3b79k1,TheCoat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:43:41 2015 UTC,Just blame Marchand now

winnipegjets,3b79k1,ComplexChristian,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:47:35 2015 UTC,2 more picks
winnipegjets,3b6obu,ShittyForeplay,11,Fri Jun 26 12:12:40 2015 UTC,Cheveldayoff is fucking done with the years of being patient and just watering his garden. He has felt the rush of adrenaline and seen the thunder of a whiteout.   This is the era of Making Shit Happen™  So fun.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,salapeno,2,Fri Jun 26 12:19:39 2015 UTC,but from the sound of CBJ it looks like they're offering their 8th. I don't know if we can compete.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,cgwinnipeg,5,Fri Jun 26 12:23:52 2015 UTC,Ehh. I would say that the 17th + 25th is about equal to the 8th when it comes down to it.   I hope we don't overpay. The two first round picks we have could give us 2 very good players.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,I_am_a_zebra,3,Fri Jun 26 13:17:07 2015 UTC,I disagree about 17+25 being equal to 8. Maybe in other years but this year the top 10 are all amazing players. But it all depends on what player we are offering with the picks.We have to be careful not to over pay.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,cgwinnipeg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:23:22 2015 UTC,Why not toss Burmi into the deal?
winnipegjets,3b6obu,TheCaptainsDizzler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:37:30 2015 UTC,1) We really need NHL forwards at this point.  Burmi is one of those.   2) Burmi + our 2 firsts probably won't be enough.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,I_am_a_zebra,2,Fri Jun 26 20:42:21 2015 UTC,8th is pretty good. I'll give you that.   But two mid first round picks is nothing to sneeze at. Would really depend on the calibre of prospect or player that gets bundled with the pick(s) and how well AZ thinks that helps them.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,salapeno,3,Fri Jun 26 12:27:52 2015 UTC,also if these rumours about Dougie Hamilton are true then I see no reason why Arizona wouldn't just do that deal. He's already a top pairing defenseman.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,cgwinnipeg,2,Fri Jun 26 12:31:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, tbh I'd probably take Hamilton."
winnipegjets,3b6obu,salapeno,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:19:57 2015 UTC,Honestly that's what people hope Hanifan turns into.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,cgwinnipeg,2,Fri Jun 26 13:21:15 2015 UTC,"That's why I don't understand that trade, you're basically just making a sideways move to dump salary. Doesn't make a ton of sense for either side IMO."
winnipegjets,3b6obu,ehr0c,3,Fri Jun 26 13:24:34 2015 UTC,"It's about timing the development of your prospects, if you ask me. It's at least a big part of why deals like that which seem like sideways moves sometimes shake out.   If you have a bunch of young ready (or almost-ready) players in the same position around the same time, it might make sense to trade for someone older to mentor them and make an impact sooner, or younger so your car doesn't run out of gas a few years down the line to spread things out.  Especially with salary cap. Because you just can't afford to have a full roster of players all in their prime anynore. You need to have a constant merry go round of new talent to keep costs down."
winnipegjets,3b6obu,salapeno,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:32:28 2015 UTC,Chevy Doin' Thangs ©
winnipegjets,3b6obu,ComplexChristian,9,Fri Jun 26 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine had a very good observation yesterday.  Whenever Chevy makes a move, it's not telegraphed.  Everything he's done has almost never been bandied about in social media or the press.  This doesn't really feel like a Chevy move and probably won't happen.  But then again, if Chevy's trade boner is full engorged, well, someone is getting fucked today."
winnipegjets,3b6obu,mysticsavage,3,Fri Jun 26 14:44:18 2015 UTC,"It has been Tallon who had been the most vocal about the trade, mostly, I bet to drive the price up."
winnipegjets,3b6obu,ZomBStrawberry,2,Fri Jun 26 14:53:10 2015 UTC,You are correct.  That explains the Dougie Hamilton option.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,mysticsavage,-1,Fri Jun 26 14:57:06 2015 UTC,"""This doesn't really feel like a Chevy move and probably won't happen.""  Cmon man don't say that :\"
winnipegjets,3b6obu,ComplexChristian,5,Fri Jun 26 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't been able to get this off my mind for the past 24 hours.  If we keep 17, 25, and mystery player we could still do quite well and draft 2 great players (see Perry and Getzlaf in 2003) so I wouldn't be too choked if we stood pat.  But on the other hand. Chevy seems to get good value in trades and a franchise #1 Center or LHD is making my heart skip a beat!  Either way I just cannot wait to see it all unfold!!"
winnipegjets,3b6obu,kingofspoonerisms,3,Fri Jun 26 13:22:01 2015 UTC,Chevy is trade hungry ever since trading Evander Kane! I'm just happy to see are name involved in these big trades for once.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,mysticsavage,2,Fri Jun 26 12:26:24 2015 UTC,Boston is now out because of the Hamilton trade.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,Hero_of_Brandon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:19:00 2015 UTC,The rumor last week was Morrissey + 25th + PTBNL for their 3rd.  Damn I wish I had a tap on Chevy's phone.
winnipegjets,3b6obu,ehr0c,2,Fri Jun 26 15:17:52 2015 UTC,PTBNL?
winnipegjets,3b6obu,Hero_of_Brandon,2,Fri Jun 26 16:43:20 2015 UTC,Player to be named later.

winnipegjets,3b6obu,brock0791,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:38:43 2015 UTC,That trade makes a lot of sense if they resign Buff.  With Buff they have 6 guys signed through 2018-19.  Hanifnin lines up with that arrival time whereas Morrissey would be blocked for his elc years

The dude asked for a trade but he worked his hardest on the ice when he was a part of our team. Its not like he screwed us over or ever refused to sign with us when he was an RFA.  I hope I'm not one of the only ones clapping when they announce his name...
winnipegjets,3b3x8j,scottsaa,5,Thu Jun 25 19:57:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, I just find the track suit situation funny. The media made him look like the bad guy, but he definitely didn't help his own case. To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if you were the only one clapping for him which is unfortunate because he is a good player that just left on bad terms unfortunately."
winnipegjets,3b3x8j,insane66666,2,Thu Jun 25 20:06:44 2015 UTC,Definitely not the only one. Hope he does well in Buffalo. He didn't fit in here but he played hard everytime he is in the ice.  Wish him the best there
winnipegjets,3b3x8j,MannoSlimmins,7,Thu Jun 25 21:28:01 2015 UTC,"I plan on booing the shit out of the guy. It was nothing but controversy with him when he was here. I'm glad he's some other team's problem now. Although now that he's gone, you just know he'll be a consistent 30 goal scorer now."

Considering the Jets started with nothing in terms of prospects, we are now at the point where the team has almost too many and can start bundling them together to get higher ranked picks.  This is what patience gets you when building a team from nothing."

winnipegjets,3b30fm,PolarOpposites8,3,Thu Jun 25 17:33:30 2015 UTC,i love it when a plan comes together
winnipegjets,3b30fm,Willyq25,6,Fri Jun 26 06:05:17 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much a guarantee that offer was us. Teams with 2 first round picks:  Edmonton and Buffalo: at 1st and 2nd overall, they'd be trading down.  Arizona: obvious  Toronto: unlikely unless they want to give up 4th and 24th to move up 1 spot.  Flyers: 7th and 29th overall. Not exactly mid.  Jets: 17th and 25th, closest to middle of the first, best bet."
winnipegjets,3b30fm,Harborcoat84,6,Thu Jun 25 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"Just a reminder, drafting low isn't always that bad. The guy that led his team in goals and points against us in the playoffs (3g 7pts), Corey Perry, was taken as the 28th pick in '03.  I don't know, I just don't want us to get taken over this deal by offering too much. Honestly, the rumor of Morrissey being offered I don't like...That and I'm just thinking of the sleeper hit in the mid/bottom of the draft (i.e. Tarasenko was the 16th pick in '10)."

winnipegjets,3b30fm,salapeno,2,Thu Jun 25 22:23:38 2015 UTC,I'm with you. I think there's a good chance he ends up being the best defenseman drafted in this class.
winnipegjets,3b30fm,Harborcoat84,3,Fri Jun 26 12:23:00 2015 UTC,Rumour is Morrissey is the mystery player.
winnipegjets,3b30fm,sneezypenguin,2,Thu Jun 25 16:32:22 2015 UTC,Where does this rumour come from?
winnipegjets,3b30fm,ComplexChristian,5,Thu Jun 25 18:14:48 2015 UTC,It's from a credibe user with an inside source from a Jets forum. First saw the news at HF Boards then decided to post it here.

winnipegjets,3b30fm,O56,2,Thu Jun 25 18:40:44 2015 UTC,Morrissey apparently
winnipegjets,3b30fm,kingofspoonerisms,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:43:39 2015 UTC,This.....  I see people tossing Burmi's name around. I don't think his value is worth enough right now though. I wonder if they are looking for an NHL ready prospect or an actual roster player?
winnipegjets,3b30fm,PolarOpposites8,2,Thu Jun 25 16:03:19 2015 UTC,I can't see Burmi being enough along with the firsts to land that pick. Without knowing if it's a prospect or actual roster player though it's almost impossible to guess who it would be.
winnipegjets,3b30fm,kingofspoonerisms,2,Thu Jun 25 16:22:09 2015 UTC,Basically. ARI really needs centermen though and they seem pretty intent on drafting Strome. I don't see who we could give them that could compare to that
winnipegjets,3b30fm,salapeno,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:44:19 2015 UTC,Copp maybe? If they want a prospect who is as close to NHL ready as possible?
winnipegjets,3b30fm,ehr0c,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:24:30 2015 UTC,"I would think we'd be willing to part with either a middle 6 forward or one of our RHD. Could see two firsts + Buff with the 3rd overall and some makeup pieces coming back the other way if they aren't able to hammer out an extension, although that seems unlikely to be on the table at this point given Chevy hasn't had a chance to talk to Buff's agent yet."

winnipegjets,3b30fm,ComplexChristian,3,Thu Jun 25 16:02:31 2015 UTC,I'd love to see Hanifin or Strome in a Jets jersey but we are lacking in LHDs so I would take Hanifin ;)

winnipegjets,3b30fm,kingofspoonerisms,2,Thu Jun 25 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"Fuck I hope we pull this off. I don't want to give them a King's ransom, but I agree with the sentiment we have lots of quantity of decent prospects, we need us a superstar. Hopefully Ehlers can be one, but man would a Strome or Hanifin be nice!"
winnipegjets,3b30fm,ShittyForeplay,2,Thu Jun 25 19:55:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure who I would rather have to be honest. On one hand Strome with Ehlers would just be filthy, but on the other Trouba and Hanifin would be one of the best D-pairs in the NHL. Either way Chevy knows what he is doing, in Chevy we trust!"

We do have Schief, Little, Lowry, Copp, Petan, and De Leo as our center depth, well LD all we have is Enstrom, Morrisey, Stuart, Chiarot. With Stuart and Enstrom aging.

winnipegjets,3awjhk,deus216,7,Wed Jun 24 02:52:05 2015 UTC,"I don't really want Buff re-signed tbh.  He's like the crazy girlfriend who is really, really fun, but in the end, you know she's killing you on the inside.  He's had 3/4's of a good season since we got the team back, and it seems like it was because his ice time was in jeopardy with him being moved up to winger for a while, up until some D men got injured.  He's just been the guy who hurts us most when we need him the most.  He gave up at least 4 goals against the Ducks because he was in the neutral zone while the puck didn't leave our end, and the guy he was supposed to be covering was alone in front of the net, then there was that whole cross checking to the back of the neck to get himself suspended when we had to claw tooth and nail to make playoffs in the first place.  There's also been a few times where he checks guys after they score, to get more stupid penalties.  If we sign him, I hope it's with the idea that we're going to trade him for a LHD and hopefully a pure scorer."
winnipegjets,3awjhk,QueefLatinaTheThird,4,Wed Jun 24 03:20:22 2015 UTC,"honestly, I wish we had Buff for another year or 2, so we could trade him out for something. If it's between Buff or nothing, I'm gonna have to go with Buff. He made a lot of mistakes and fucked up a lot when he came back from his injury, but before his injury, he was definitely an incredible blue liner, someone that's really hard to replace. I'd hate to just let that walk away for free. I agree that his antics put us in a hard place a lot of times, and with our defense core as strong and upcoming as it is, he's a high value item, and we could get a lot for him."
winnipegjets,3awjhk,lordderplythethird,5,Wed Jun 24 03:27:38 2015 UTC,"But it's not nothing.  They could trade him this season for a few picks, but the real value would be to clear up the 5.5 of cap space for when guys like Trouba, Scheif, Hutch, Helleboy, or our alleged deepest prospect pool in the league come up.  If we're too worried about next season, we might run a little flat on our long term."
winnipegjets,3awjhk,QueefLatinaTheThird,2,Wed Jun 24 03:31:20 2015 UTC,"prospects don't effect the NHL salary cap though, they only effect it if they get called up, so hellebuyck's contract has no relevance to Trouba/Scheif/Hutch/etc. Plus, isn't Truba, Scheif, and Hutch's contracts over after this coming season? And Hellebuych's isn't done until the end of the 16-17 season. There's a few people we need to resign, but most of them are low salary players.   Chiarot (RFA) - $600k Ellerby (RFA) - $700k Pardy - $700k Postma (RFA) - $775k O'Dell - $650k Stempniak - $900k Peluso (RFA) - $575k Stafford - $4m Tlusty - $2.9m Galiardi - $750k Slater - $1.6m Frofro - $3.3m   Chuck Tlusty out yesterday,   Plus, the Jets were over $6M from the cap ceiling last season... and the cap went up by $2M. Granted they're a small market team and would likely never really get dangerously close to the cap, but yeah, there's plenty of room."
winnipegjets,3awjhk,lordderplythethird,7,Wed Jun 24 03:50:06 2015 UTC,Yeah. Party needs a big raise.   Edit: typo but I'm not even correcting it
winnipegjets,3awjhk,salapeno,2,Wed Jun 24 13:20:28 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about when they're approaching contract renewal in a few years so we don't end up like Chicago did when they had to dump ladd and buff in the first place, and why they have to dismantle again.  They got too many prospects that are up for renewal at the same time."
winnipegjets,3awjhk,QueefLatinaTheThird,4,Wed Jun 24 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"You're right. If we can get value for Buff, we have to take it. I thought that before the crosscheck. I thought that before hte Ducks series. I'm convinced of it now.  (And the crazy girlfriend analogy is a good one.)"

winnipegjets,3awjhk,kingofspoonerisms,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:56:43 2015 UTC,"Can we afford to re-sign him? Does Chevy see 'value' in giving a crazy gf $8 million per year for 4 years? I'm going to guess the answer is no. Therefore, let's take that second rounder and a bag of pucks.  Though I think that if he's a 'game-changer' and an 'impact player' somebody will give more than that for a chance to build a relationship with him prior to him hitting the market."
winnipegjets,3awjhk,sneezypenguin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"There isn't plenty of room, not after next season which is the relevant season for having cap issues. Ladd, scheif, Trouba, and Lowry, and potentially others will all get raises. Besides, we only have one good left handed D. Stuart is mediocre, Chiarot is too young and really just a 3rd pairing anyway, Morrissey might not even make the team yet. So we need to move buff for a left hander, and another middle 6 forward. Myers and trouba are both losing minutes and valuable development time with buff on our team."
winnipegjets,3awjhk,Reddiohead,2,Wed Jun 24 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"I agree that Buff can be a pain in the arse at times due to penalties or insane cross checkings to a dudes neck but he is also a helluva impact player who can drive the play.  Beast of a shot, hard as nails, hits like a freight train and you know that other teams hate playing against him. Puts up good points too."
winnipegjets,3awjhk,MacSquizzy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:03:39 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. I fucking LOVE Dustin Byfuglien. He is such an awesome charismatic guy, and on the ice he is nothing shirt of a wrecking ball capable of scoring big goals and obliterating some of the leagues best players. That being said... I feel like their is just something.. off.. about him. Hear me out here. Remember in one of the first 3 games of the year, he got ejected and a 5 minute major. He stormed down the hall, had a huge fit and threw his stick.. Now imagine him doing that on the ice. I feel like one day he will just snap and break someone's neck like Bertuzzi or something.."

winnipegjets,3aq81o,Becau5eRea5on5,7,Mon Jun 22 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say in a Jets Jersey. His value's pretty low right now, and he can be an affordable replacement for Frolik."
winnipegjets,3aq81o,RabbleRabble668,4,Mon Jun 22 17:33:34 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. It will also give our bottom 6 a lot of speed. Burmi is one hell of a fast skater. Him paired up with Ehlers and a capable centre would be a tough line to go against
winnipegjets,3aq81o,ComplexChristian,5,Mon Jun 22 18:26:59 2015 UTC,A Ehlers - Lowry - Burmi line is actually something that I would love to see.
winnipegjets,3aq81o,RabbleRabble668,3,Mon Jun 22 19:04:33 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was thinking! Lowry give a lot of size and has a decent faceoff %.. Him with two speedy, slippery wingers would be deadly"

winnipegjets,3aq81o,siempreloco31,3,Tue Jun 23 01:02:57 2015 UTC,"Ehlers - Lowry - Burmi, seems like a pretty good third line with lots of speed. The only problem would be inexperience. I would expect to see:   Ladd - Little - Stafford/Frolik (1st line)  Ehlers - Schief - Wheeler (2nd Line)  Perrault - Lowry - Burmi (3rd Line)  Stempniak - Copp - Thorbs (4th Line)  Not to shabby of a lineup!"
winnipegjets,3aq81o,RabbleRabble668,4,Mon Jun 22 18:35:36 2015 UTC,Stafford on the first line is asking for lols
winnipegjets,3aq81o,Harborcoat84,2,Mon Jun 22 23:29:20 2015 UTC,It gives me goosebumps... That with our blue line is one fine team  Chiarot - Byfuglien  Myers - Enstrom  Stuart - Trouba

winnipegjets,3aq81o,RabbleRabble668,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:14:23 2015 UTC,I hope NHL15 is a good judge of character. I brought Armia up as an injury replacement mid season and he got 32 goals in 56 games.

winnipegjets,3aq81o,salapeno,2,Tue Jun 23 15:32:45 2015 UTC,Ya I like that Blue line as well! Although I wouldn't be surprised to see Buff moved with the play of Trouba and Myers. The lines would look like:  Enstrom - Myers  (Player acquired from trade) - Trouba  Stuart - Postma  Chiarot - Harrison  As well as a good forward coming back for Buff as well.

winnipegjets,3apfum,salapeno,2,Tue Jun 23 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"We can't spend to the cap. We're a budget team. It's frustrating, I know."
winnipegjets,3apfum,Harborcoat84,2,Tue Jun 23 19:20:36 2015 UTC,Ah gotcha. Ugh.

winnipegjets,3apfum,Harborcoat84,2,Tue Jun 23 19:11:09 2015 UTC,"Chevy himself said that the organization has an internal cap. Also, every team has a rich guy behind the scenes, I don't see how that's relevant."

winnipegjets,3apfum,IronRook,5,Tue Jun 23 19:31:20 2015 UTC,He'll just take his 2nd Rolls Royce to work.
winnipegjets,3apfum,RabbleRabble668,2,Tue Jun 23 19:38:29 2015 UTC,Won't even drive it. Just load Rolly Number Two into the cargo hold of his gold plated Boeing.
winnipegjets,3apfum,IronRook,5,Wed Jun 24 13:32:27 2015 UTC,Chevy's interview was kinda underwhelming. Also I took this great screenshot of Matty P.
winnipegjets,3apfum,RabbleRabble668,2,Tue Jun 23 17:20:04 2015 UTC,Did you expect him to spill every little secret about their draft hopes?

winnipegjets,3apfum,ComplexChristian,2,Tue Jun 23 18:10:11 2015 UTC,What I got from it:  1) Allan Walsh is being a cunt.  2) We want to keep getting young guys.  3) Not all UFAs will be back.  4) He's meeting with Burmi's agent at the draft.
winnipegjets,3apfum,salapeno,2,Tue Jun 23 18:13:03 2015 UTC,Soo...   1) Allan Walsh being Allan Walsh?  2) No Patrick Sharp.. Entirely okay with that  3) Fu Man Drew probably won't be back I'm guessing..  4) Hopefully Jets Gear will let me change my Burmi jersey for cheaper when he signs
winnipegjets,3apfum,ComplexChristian,2,Tue Jun 23 18:16:58 2015 UTC,4) Burmi signed the 8 on my jersey... fuuuuuuuuu

winnipegjets,3apfum,cgwinnipeg,7,Tue Jun 23 19:08:15 2015 UTC,Rumor floating around on a Jets forum that the Jets might trade away Morissey + One of our firsts this year + a mystery prospect for the 3rd overall pick (Arizona) in this years draft.  The source is apparently a guy with a credible reputation and has an inside source.  Take this as a heavy grain of salt.  Thoughts?
winnipegjets,3apfum,RabbleRabble668,4,Tue Jun 23 19:13:41 2015 UTC,That would be a great deal for the jets but i really don't think that Arizona would do that.
winnipegjets,3apfum,PolarOpposites8,2,Mon Jun 22 21:36:28 2015 UTC,"Who do you think are we going to pick if we do get that? Hanifin probably? Or maybe Strome?  Maybe they won't take it, maybe they will. They get 3 prospects in return, Morissey might be NHL ready. I do hope the mystery prospect is not Ehlers though."
winnipegjets,3apfum,Harborcoat84,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:39:06 2015 UTC,If it's Ehlers that deal won't happen. Just out of curiosity how do we know this source is reputable? I hope it's true that we are trying to move up in the draft. We need more high end talent.
winnipegjets,3apfum,ComplexChristian,3,Mon Jun 22 21:44:22 2015 UTC,If it's not Ehlers there's no way Arizona should agree to it and if it is Ehlers there's no way we should agree to it.
winnipegjets,3apfum,verify_deez_nuts,2,Mon Jun 22 21:54:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe they need a goalie prospect. We could send them Forcefield Phillips maybe, if management thinks Hellebuyck and Comrie are stronger prospects."
winnipegjets,3apfum,SeniorSophomore,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:02:09 2015 UTC,I really hope it's not Ehlers. I was just reading on HF Boards and someone said that the insider has a good reputation. I'm not convinced though which is why I said to everyone to take it with a grain of salt. lol
winnipegjets,3apfum,Not_Jacob_Trouba,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:26:10 2015 UTC,"It simply wouldn't be worth it for the jets.Ehlers is going to be a first liner hopefully elite. He could end up being almost as good as Strome,Marner and Hanifan"
winnipegjets,3apfum,Becau5eRea5on5,5,Mon Jun 22 22:04:11 2015 UTC,I could never see Chevy trading Ehlers. I see him being a franchise player in the future
winnipegjets,3apfum,Not_Jacob_Trouba,4,Mon Jun 22 22:08:48 2015 UTC,He's is probably our most untouchable forward and he's not even in the league yet. We better not trade him.

winnipegjets,3apfum,salapeno,3,Mon Jun 22 16:08:54 2015 UTC,I knew a guy who did that too. He wanted to become a pilot in the air force but he took the wrong math and his physics mark was on the verge of not being good enough so he took one class each semester and worked full time. He went to grad twice and somehow tricked a way hotter girl into going with him the second time ahaha

winnipegjets,39ylkl,ComplexChristian,3,Tue Jun 16 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"Ugh, no preorder, no. People got screwed on NHL 15 because they did this. The only new things for NHL 16 are all the things they cut out of NHL 15 because they released a half-finished game."

winnipegjets,39ylkl,derekwtg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"That's just how it goes with new hardware generations. The games that straddle the generation jump are going to be stripped down feature wise in order to focus on the new platform and jump in graphics.   For someone who doesn't get every year's NHL game, 16 is a tempting time to re-up... Still not entirely sure if I want a new console though.  It is wise to wait on the pre-order until we get more info though."
winnipegjets,39ylkl,deus216,2,Tue Jun 16 15:30:01 2015 UTC,No. That's not how it goes. They didn't do that with the other sports series. Don't give them excuses. They screwed people.
winnipegjets,39ylkl,derekwtg,2,Tue Jun 16 15:50:11 2015 UTC,Did they lie about it? People could've just not bought it...
winnipegjets,39ylkl,biga204,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:52:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah. They did. They said they would release more stuff as DC to fix what was missing and did a half assed job of that and didn't bother responding to people after a few months. People also just didn't buy it as you said, myself included. That's why preorder is a stupid concept. You don't know what you're getting before you commit to buying it."

winnipegjets,39wzek,IronRook,2,Sun Jun 21 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"Really, why?"
winnipegjets,39wzek,Not_Jacob_Trouba,2,Sun Jun 21 22:29:03 2015 UTC,1) Manitoba includes more people.  2) Moose are more relevant than fighter jets.  3) Moose logo is one of the best i've seen in sports.  4) I came to Canada in 1997 and have zero attachment to the old team.
winnipegjets,39wzek,IronRook,2,Sun Jun 21 23:04:24 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I wanted them to become the Moose as well, but I was happy with the Jets."

The guy who caught A Rod's said he won't give it back (and might just sell it )  would you give it back and just accept what they give you, or would you hold out like this guy?  I'd just give it back."
winnipegjets,39wzek,RabbleRabble668,3,Sat Jun 20 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"The merch and seats he got are probably more than he could have sold it for anyways! Mind you, for that milestone it would be priceless for the player! THat'd be like somehow getting the puck for a 500th goal or something crazy. I would never think about keeping it. That's somethieng special to a player."
winnipegjets,39wzek,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Sat Jun 20 18:35:41 2015 UTC,I think I'd give it back. If I were to keep it I don't think I'd sell it.
winnipegjets,39wzek,Hero_of_Brandon,2,Sat Jun 20 17:04:40 2015 UTC,The worst part about this is that this guy has made a career out of catching MLB balls. apparently he looks at spray charts and whatnot to find out the best places to sit to catch balls.

winnipegjets,39wzek,ComplexChristian,2,Sat Jun 20 06:08:22 2015 UTC,He's a decent playmaker if I recall correctly? I wonder how a line of Ehlers - Lowry - Burmistrov would look. Maybe even deadlier with Petan in the middle if we sacrifice Lowry's size on the line.
winnipegjets,39wzek,Becau5eRea5on5,5,Sat Jun 20 14:11:20 2015 UTC,So Lawless made a tweet earlier today saying  that the talks between Staff and Chevy are quiet then he deleted it and said that his contact's email to him was missing a comma and that the talks between Staff and Chevy are going well-intentioned.

winnipegjets,39wzek,EnigmaticTortoise,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:39:09 2015 UTC,And how much is duty for that? Would you have to pay duty if you went to GF and put 60 down and paid 60 when it came out? Would it be worth it if you factor in the price of gas? I'm asking for a friend.
winnipegjets,39wzek,RabbleRabble668,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:10:11 2015 UTC,"Up to $200 if you're there for 24-48h, up to $800 if you're there over 48h. No exemption for under a day. Probably not worth it when you consider the weak dollar."
winnipegjets,39wzek,ComplexChristian,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:33:26 2015 UTC,Depends on how much you buy down there and how long you're in the US. I can't remember the ammounts but there's a certain dollar ammount you don't pay duty on if you're only there for 24 hours

winnipegjets,39wzek,Hero_of_Brandon,4,Thu Jun 18 18:48:40 2015 UTC,I think the weekly thread is okay for now. The suggested sort feature made these threads a lot better.

winnipegjets,39wzek,Not_Jacob_Trouba,3,Thu Jun 18 21:04:23 2015 UTC,They did the new premium loges first. Then they tried doing it simultaneously before the week with a bunch of concerts. But so far they have just removed the jumbotron and did concrete work for the loges.   I'm guessing their main focus right now is to finish the new premium seats then do the jumbotron which is probably why the Draft Party was moved to The Met.  Source: the folks at HF Boards.

winnipegjets,39wzek,ComplexChristian,4,Wed Jun 17 17:18:14 2015 UTC,That awkward feeling when you go to /r/hockey and see that your most favorite player in the NHL is being labelled cocky and douchebag by a fellow Jets fan. :|
winnipegjets,39wzek,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Wed Jun 17 01:59:43 2015 UTC,He used to be when he was younger I have heard (but who isn't cocky as a teenager). He's super intense so I think that's why it's off putting.
winnipegjets,39wzek,ComplexChristian,2,Wed Jun 17 05:02:48 2015 UTC,Oh I'm sure every teenager and NHL superstar has a past ego. Crosby used to have an ego back in high school.   That is true. I'm sure he has matured ever since.
winnipegjets,39wzek,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Wed Jun 17 05:10:40 2015 UTC,Yeah being as competitive as he is really puts some people off of Toews.   Also I saw that comment and an ex coworker of mine used to tell those stories so I think that's his Reddit account ahahaha.
winnipegjets,39wzek,ComplexChristian,2,Wed Jun 17 05:15:15 2015 UTC,"Hah got 'em.  Regarding Toews, IMO I honestly think he is the best centre right now in the NHL, hell could even probably be the best player in the NHL. He's good in all areas of the game but he is overshadowed by Crosby who's on another note crazy in producing points."

winnipegjets,39wzek,Hero_of_Brandon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:30:31 2015 UTC,Which system do you prefer?
winnipegjets,39wzek,Vuldr,6,Tue Jun 16 02:42:18 2015 UTC,"IMO, PS4, powerful specs yet almost the same price as XB1. I own both but I like my PS4 better. PS4 can run Native (not upscaled) 1080p on 60fps, XB1 can only run 60fps if the resolution is 900p. PS4 controller is much more comfortable than XB1 too.   Sony also announced a bunch of exclusive titles and exclusive content for non-exclusive titles (such as exclusive DLC on COD, Destiny, Arkham Knight, Assassins Creed Syndicate) today but on the other hand XB1 announced they will be running a (I think modified) Windows 10 and backwards compatibility. Even with XBOX's announcements, I still prefer the PS4 more. PS+ is also better than XBL since the free games that come with PS+ every month are legit. You don't really need PS+ if you don't play alot of Multiplayer. You don't need PS+ for browsing the internet, watching on the Youtube app, or watching Netflix or NHL Gamecentre. Plus even if you get PS+ it's still cheaper than XBL, every boxing day I get PS+ for 26 bucks (good for a year, sometimes comes with an extra month or two) compared to XBL's 59 a year."

winnipegjets,39tmh1,QueefLatinaTheThird,3,Mon Jun 15 16:12:40 2015 UTC,High shooting percentage and poor possession. We need Frolik more. I'd take him hands down and at a higher AAV.

winnipegjets,39tmh1,QueefLatinaTheThird,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:14:37 2015 UTC,This is over both of their careers. Frolik is better hands down.
winnipegjets,39tmh1,deus216,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:21:37 2015 UTC,There's been worry about him being a contract player plus he has less than stellar possession numbers while he's more talented than frolik I'm confident in Fro to play consistently at the same level and to be defensively responsible.
winnipegjets,39tmh1,Not_Jacob_Trouba,2,Mon Jun 15 16:45:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of Buffalo fans are calling this 'classic contract year Stafford', so I'd be worried about that too."
winnipegjets,39tmh1,Becau5eRea5on5,5,Mon Jun 15 19:21:29 2015 UTC,This is great news. Obviously it's not a done deal bit it shows that Stafford is interested. I'll be really happy if we can retain either Stafford or Frolik. Ecstatic if we could retain both.
winnipegjets,39tmh1,biga204,4,Sun Jun 14 18:08:53 2015 UTC,I'm Still praying we sign Frolik.   If we can only have one I'd rather have him
winnipegjets,39tmh1,Vuldr,4,Mon Jun 15 01:27:33 2015 UTC,"Hopefully he re-signs for 3 years at around $4 million. He looked pretty decent for us, but he will most likely regress with his age so a 2-3 year contract would be a good sign by Chevy. Good to see Chevy start extensions talks!"
winnipegjets,39tmh1,Igglith,10,Sun Jun 14 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"He scored with a super high shooting % and was an absolute black hole when it came to corsi, dragging down anyone he played with on the Jets. Signing him makes me nervous."

winnipegjets,39tmh1,cgwinnipeg,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:35:06 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call 16% super high and yeah his corsi wasn't great but we still need him as someone who can play 2nd line at least for a year or two.Obviously for the right price I wouldn't mind him back. He has consistently been a 35-45 point guy which is something our team needs currently.
winnipegjets,39tmh1,Becau5eRea5on5,4,Mon Jun 15 00:35:50 2015 UTC,Let's just sign him to 1 year contracts so the every year is a contract year.

winnipegjets,39tmh1,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Mon Jun 15 02:50:55 2015 UTC,"If I had my way, we wouldn't even be talking about re-signing him. At least this way he maximizes his scoring production because there's always a shooting % bump in any of his contract years."

winnipegjets,39l3eu,imfromwinnipeg,4,Fri Jun 12 15:12:08 2015 UTC,Hard to say. Both are top tier players with storied legacies.. I think Wright is a 1st ballot lock for the HOF but it could take Kilnberg a bit longer to cement his spot!
winnipegjets,39l3eu,ComplexChristian,2,Fri Jun 12 15:14:34 2015 UTC,Is it too much if I say James Wright is the Wayne Gretzky of the KHL?

winnipegjets,39lxil,FlyRobot,6,Fri Jun 12 17:38:27 2015 UTC,I got this off of the Canucks website.  The patch you posted is the same as both my replica home and away jersey (red band -- both bought from Jets Gear at MTSC) but my tag does not say CCM with numbered size.  I just want to make sure that anyone interested in this does their due diligence to ensure they are getting what they want.  I'm not implying that you're trying to scam someone but there was just a few things that I noticed that made me slightly suspicious that its not authentic.
winnipegjets,39lxil,Hero_of_Brandon,2,Fri Jun 12 17:57:35 2015 UTC,Ah okay - thanks for clarifying!   I'm definitely not trying to scam anyone!  I only have my one Ducks jersey that I bought from the team store a couple seasons ago so I'm not well versed in all the classifications.
winnipegjets,39lxil,Hero_of_Brandon,2,Fri Jun 12 18:00:27 2015 UTC,All good.  You should really keep it. For Teemu!

winnipegjets,39lxil,Reed_Solomon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:25:00 2015 UTC,No worries man just make sure you let the buyer know it's fake before you sell it and I wouldn't charge anything over 50$ for it personally since that's probably how much it was purchased for..

winnipegjets,39346y,ThankYouKessel,15,Mon Jun 8 22:25:51 2015 UTC,Yeah he probably wants to be overpaid like everyone Walsh represents.
winnipegjets,39346y,Reed_Solomon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:59:00 2015 UTC,If somebody is willing to give him the money then he isn't really being over paid. His value is whatever the market dictates.
winnipegjets,39346y,kapacj,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:57:49 2015 UTC,I disagree with that logic.  Are many CEO's in north america not overpaid just because it's what the market dictates?
winnipegjets,39346y,Reed_Solomon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:03:15 2015 UTC,From an ethical or philosophical stand point they are. But from a value stand point- no they aren't. Companies wouldn't be willing to pay them so much if it wasn't profitable and in their best interest to do so.
winnipegjets,39346y,kapacj,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:02:20 2015 UTC,But that's not altogether true.  Companies have a flawed recruitment method that benefits hiring these people rather than promoting and developing from within.  Japan for example has no need to pay its ceos the exhorbitant rate north american businesses do.  I personally believe they are getting paid these twistedly obscene amounts because of nepotism and favoritism rather than any actual skill.  Its an artificially inflated bubble that benefits those already in control of the bubble making machine.  The same way politicians give themselves raises.  Are they worth it because we keep voting them in?
winnipegjets,39346y,Reed_Solomon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"I think this is a conversation thats going to come down to personal politics, and to be honest I don't really want to get into that."
winnipegjets,39346y,kapacj,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you're completely  wrong, I'm saying the markets are so distorted from reality that they arent a true representation of the worth and value of the people therein.  We do not have a fair system of taxation or of renumeration for work done.  It'll likely never be perfect, but things right now are more skewed than at any time since the middle ages, and a correction is likely due.  But I will agree that this is no longer a discussion that needs to take place in this subreddit."
winnipegjets,39346y,Reed_Solomon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:06:20 2015 UTC,"I think there is definitely points to be made for both sides, but yeah.... go jets!"
winnipegjets,39346y,kapacj,7,Sun Jun 14 23:15:06 2015 UTC,"Frolik is a very good 2-way player. I hope the Jets re-sign him. He may price himself out of the market; meaning a desperate team may throw something stupid his way. He's probably worth around $4 mill per. I don't see him being worth more than that. There's a limit to his offensive production, as we saw this year playing on a #1 line and only having 42 points. But he's a great penalty killer, and like I implied earlier, a very good defensive player."
winnipegjets,39346y,jediofpool,3,Mon Jun 8 23:00:03 2015 UTC,"He's a two-way player. He can play anywhere in the Top 9 and is a great penalty-killer. You won't appreciate him by looking at his point totals but he makes everyone around him better. It's unlikely that we'll re-sign him as he's is looking for 5+ mil. We have the cap space but we're a budget team who has to worry about allocating cap space for guys like Ladd, Shuffles and Troubs down the road."
winnipegjets,39346y,Lucmin,2,Mon Jun 8 23:02:19 2015 UTC,"He doesn't put up as many points as you might expect, but he is up their on the list of best defensive forward in the league. He can play pretty much anywhere in the lineup and generally makes everybody he plays with better.  There are a bunch of rumors going around about what is happening with him, some saying he wants too much money, another one is going around that he his wife/girlfriend doesn't like the weather here."
winnipegjets,39346y,I_am_a_zebra,2,Mon Jun 8 23:04:33 2015 UTC,The problem is he will be a great 4M per year player for the next couple of years and in 3 or 4 years be wroth 2-3M per season tops.   He is looking for 30M for 6 years. Some team will give it to him I'm sure.. they may even be happy with it for the first couple of years.. but the Jets can't afford to waste 15M in the future for a solid 2-3 liner today.
winnipegjets,39346y,elerium2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:25:50 2015 UTC,"Realistically, he's a 3-3.5 mil type player.  Rumor is that they're looking north of 5.  He's a great player, but I wouldn't consider him a core player like ladd, wheeler, little, schief, trouba or Myers, but he's not too far away from being one.  It just seems crazy to me to pay him more than most of those players.  It could also lead to when other players go into negotiations to use that as a benchmark, and become upset with the franchise if they aren't matched with this contract, and stuff like that."

winnipegjets,39106l,Not_Jacob_Trouba,2,Sun Jun 14 17:20:23 2015 UTC,Heard a rumor on TSN this morning saying that they were trying to sign Buff and Ladd to contract extensions. What do you guys think?
winnipegjets,39106l,ehr0c,2,Thu Jun 11 17:00:05 2015 UTC,I'm 100% in for Ladd. Buff I'd like to keep but only if we don't get our pants pulled down in the process.
winnipegjets,39106l,deus216,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"Buff is not an easy player to replace. He and Trouba are our best defenders, I don't mind locking him down for 3-5 years. Dude is a specimen."
winnipegjets,39106l,ComplexChristian,2,Thu Jun 11 21:14:00 2015 UTC,"He, Trouba, and TyMy are our best defenders. Don't forget about TyMy, his wingspan is crazy and he made Ovi invisible last time."

winnipegjets,39106l,ehr0c,2,Fri Jun 12 03:14:08 2015 UTC,"I love Buff, I just don't want to end up in a bad spot if we give him something like $8M, even if it's only for a few years. If we want to sign him shorter-term it's likely going to cost us more in cap space."
winnipegjets,39106l,Not_Jacob_Trouba,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:19:20 2015 UTC,I'm fine with signing buff but not for very long term. I have  feeling his age will catch up with him in the next 4 or so years.
winnipegjets,39106l,ehr0c,2,Thu Jun 11 19:06:53 2015 UTC,"If we want to sign him for 4 or 5 years we're probably going to be paying him close to $8M would be my guess. He's gotta know (and if not, his agent sure does) that this is his big chance to get paid."
winnipegjets,39106l,Not_Jacob_Trouba,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:10:23 2015 UTC,I mean I wouldn't havr a problem with Enstrom not being the highest paid defensman on the team. And isn't subban making 8 mil? No way buff gets that much.
winnipegjets,39106l,ehr0c,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"Subban's got an AAV of $9M, but his contract isn't directly comparable either since it's an 8-year deal and some of those are RFA years which come a little cheaper. Usually there's an inverse relationship of sorts between term and AAV."
winnipegjets,39106l,Not_Jacob_Trouba,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:59:06 2015 UTC,"Still I don't think he'll make 8 mil. No way he makes more than Webber, Sutter, Doughty Chara etc. My guess is 6-6.5 mil.   But I've been wrong before."
winnipegjets,39106l,ehr0c,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:48:43 2015 UTC,"All those guys signed their deals pre-lockout. Weber and Suter in particular signed massively front-loaded deals, both their cap hits should be more like $10.4M if you cut out the backdiving years at the end of their contracts."
winnipegjets,39106l,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Thu Jun 11 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with throwing them some cash, I just hope the term isn't too long. Hopefully it would be 5 years max."
winnipegjets,39106l,Not_Jacob_Trouba,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:38:29 2015 UTC,Yeah especially with buff. Term would be a killer.   I'm hoping for 3-4 years for each of them.

winnipegjets,39106l,IronRook,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:11:59 2015 UTC,Reddit admins want to remove subs that are not staying within their corner of the internet. These subs are notorious for assaulting people and brigading other subs. The largest one of these was /r/fatpeoplehate. Ellen Pao is the Reddit CEO and she's taking the brunt of the blame. Now people (mostly subscribers of /r/fatpeoplehate) are lashing out by creating numerous other subreddits hating on fat people and spamming the front page.. which proved the admins' point.
winnipegjets,39106l,pinkpools,3,Thu Jun 11 15:39:00 2015 UTC,"What got the ball rolling was Imgur deleting hosted pictures on /r/fatpeoplehate  This pissed them off so they started targeting overweight Imgur employees and put a banner on the side of the subreddit showing pictures of overweight Imgur workers. Imgur probably complained to Reddit and this is why they banned the subreddit, while leaving subs like CoonTown and other offensive subreddits up."

winnipegjets,39106l,ComplexChristian,2,Tue Jun 9 16:04:27 2015 UTC,"Could an expansion draft in Vegas help us get rid of some players taking up space? If my understanding of the process is correct, you can choose to protect a certain amount of players on your team, and the expansion team gets to steal a few of the unprotected guys from each team.  Could this be beneficial to us in offloading a few guys who we're waiting on contracts to run out?"
winnipegjets,39106l,I_am_a_zebra,2,Mon Jun 8 18:49:48 2015 UTC,"Could be. You also have to protect guys with NTC's so if you're talking Enstrom, that wouldn't work ;)"

winnipegjets,391pjl,MrDenominic9000,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:52:51 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. So basically at the end of the finals we will freeze all NHL transactions that happen in real life for the purpose of the sim. After this the only transactions will be made by the GM's of the sim. GM's will be able to negotiate contracts for FA's (through me or other agents if there is that much interest). Basically you determine what your team needs to do. If you're the Jets' GM you might message around and see if people are interested in Buff. If somebody is willing to overpay, you can go ahead and trade him. You're the GM of the Leafs? You have a better Shannaplan? See what you can get for Kessel and who is interested. Every GM created a spreadsheet (on google Docs) with their players and their contract information, which is linked in the sidebar. That way everybody's team is easily accessible. Here is an example from our baseball sim Have other questions?"

winnipegjets,38a3to,Oilcan10,4,Tue Jun 2 21:40:24 2015 UTC,"The fact that it's taken this long I'm assuming he's going to walk. there's going to be no trade taking place. Fro deserves the money so I don't blame him for not giving the Jets a discount even if he wants to stay, because in the end he's gotta look out for himself in this business. I don't see the Jets giving up $5 mil for his services, though it will be greatly missed by fans. If Fro+his agent were looking for something in the ball park of $4.-4.5 he would have been signed by now, the only reason he isn't gone already is because it isn't July 1st"
winnipegjets,38a3to,watertattoo,3,Wed Jun 3 00:32:40 2015 UTC,"Would much rather see Stafford over Frolik. Perfectly said though, the guy isn't worth anything over $4.5M.  Also I know we didn't have a long run in the playoffs this year, but in those four games Frolik didn't produce a single point."
winnipegjets,38a3to,BrawnyJohnny,2,Wed Jun 3 03:29:41 2015 UTC,"Stafford has been inconsistent through his career, which makes me wary. Personally I'd rather Frolik. He can fill any role, plays a two-way game, and I think would be a good role model for the young guys comimg up. How many teams are salivating for this guy?"
winnipegjets,38a3to,monkey_bojangles,3,Wed Jun 3 04:44:33 2015 UTC,"You have to take into account that Stafford has been stuck in Buffalo his entire career. He is dedicated and wants to win, back in Buffalo after on ice sessions with the team, he would rent his own ice to practice by himself because he didn't like what was going on there. I think that says a lot to ones dedication to succeed.  Just because Frolik might be a fan favourite doesn't mean he is the right choice."
winnipegjets,38a3to,BrawnyJohnny,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:08:01 2015 UTC,"It's not about being a fan favorite, it's about what he does. Is Stafford offensively gifted? Certainly. But looking at the kids coming up in the system I think we'll have a lot of that, with Ehlers, Petan, Armia, Lemieux, and they'll be dirt cheap. Frolik is not meant to be a top scorer. It's his all around game, his work on the PK, that's important. That's what we need in the system, what needs to be passed down. Ideally we would be able to sign both players, but if I have to choose I would go with Frolik. That being said, Chevy is a wizard, so I wouldn't be surprised if he signs them both."
winnipegjets,38a3to,monkey_bojangles,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"Stafford is a two-way player who also happens to produce. He joined the Jets at the beginning of the playoff push, which was one of the toughest times of the year when you look at who we were playing.  He went from being a -18 with Buffalo in 50 games, to a +6 in 26 games with the Jets. He also put up 19 points in those games and was very discipline which was represented in only 8 pims.  Physically they are identical, but Stafford has Frolik beat by an inch and 14 pounds. Who uses their body more? Well the stats say Stafford wins that by 18 hits.  When we talk about PK, sure Stafford wasn't as strong as Frolik, but on the PP Stafford put up 2 PPG and 2 PPA in 26 games where as Frolik was at 3 PPG and 4 PPA in 82 games.  At the end of the day Stafford is the better T6 two-way forward to go with and I am sure every single Jets fan would love to see what he could do with a full season in a Winnipeg Jets uniform."
winnipegjets,38a3to,BrawnyJohnny,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:31:20 2015 UTC,I don't have the source but i've read that Frolik's corsinumbers were godlike and that staffords were not. Something to consider inte the two-way forward argument.   However im okay with either one.
winnipegjets,38a3to,Albanovich,0,Thu Jun 4 23:04:52 2015 UTC,Staffords pace as a Jet was an anomaly. Frolik > Stafford in WAR and its not close.
winnipegjets,38a3to,siempreloco31,0,Thu Jun 4 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"You couldn't be more wrong. Staffords corsi is actually terrible. Froliks is great. Frolik is better at every single facet of the game asides from scoring and maybe hitting slightly. Just because Stafford scored alongside our best offensive player(wheels) and best offensive prospect(scheif) doesn't mean he's good. He's an average 2nd liner at best, with bad corsi numbers and bad defensive capabilities in general, let alone compared to the 2-way God that is frolik. I would rather have frolik at 5mil than staff at 4, regardless of other contracts."
winnipegjets,38a3to,Reddiohead,7,Thu Jun 4 23:51:30 2015 UTC,That agent's name is Allan Walsh and he is a god damn super villain. He's the reason that we have Pavelec's balls strapped to our legs.   Fuck. Allan. Walsh.
winnipegjets,38a3to,IronRook,2,Wed Jun 3 01:10:17 2015 UTC,My issue with letting him walk is that there really isn't too many other places to spend the money.  We're in such a good position with cheap talent coming up on entry level contracts in the next few years that I'd rather overpay by a mil then sit 10m under the cap.  Even giving Ladd 6-6.5m next year a season and handling Sheif/Lowry/Trouba RFA's we'll still be around a 55m team with filling in pieces in 2017.  (this is assuming we let Buff go as we don't really have roster space for him after next year).  Unless we want to chase RFA's of teams up against the cap like maybe Saad in Chicago or let David Thomson pocket the 10m we'll be under the cap just give him 4/20m.  Long as he's off the books by 2019 when our next prospect wave needs their RFA deals

winnipegjets,38a3to,IronRook,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:55:07 2015 UTC,Appreciate that. Unfortunately I see him walking. I think he will want north of 5-5.5 mil and I don't see the Jets giving him that kind of cash.

winnipegjets,389gwu,brock0791,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"If I'm Andrew Copp or Joel Armia and the difference in my daily pay is $2100 down to $300 because of this move, I definitely have that in the back of my mind and how I was treated when free agency rolls around and I'm deciding if I want to resign with the team.  I might stomach it if we're against the cap like the Blackhawks and its a necessity to help the team win but if we're a 65m team next year like we probably will be it's pretty inexcusable."

Then this guy replied to me and said that we should never resign Stempniak but he wants to resign FROLIK, STAFFORD, AND TLUSTY AT THE SAME TIME ""Resign Tlusty, Frolik, Stafford upfront."".... what the fuck.  I also commented that we need to trade away Pavs while his value is big and if we resign Fro and Staff we're gonna have cap problems and we need cap space to resign Buff and Ladd next year then this guy replied to me and said that ""Jets have the richest owner in the league, David Thompson is top twenty on the planet."" what. the. fuck."

winnipegjets,3837m0,sauze,2,Tue Jun 2 18:13:06 2015 UTC,I agree. Tlusty seemed like the second coming of Setoguchi.
winnipegjets,3837m0,ComplexChristian,2,Tue Jun 2 18:31:00 2015 UTC,"How do we acquire Rychel? That would be a sweet acquisition but I doubt Columbos wants to move him. Additionally, I think that one of either Frolik or Stafford will re-sign."
winnipegjets,3837m0,ComplexChristian,3,Mon Jun 1 19:16:13 2015 UTC,"Highly likely that Stafford will, the chances of re-signing Frolik are very very slim. Looks like Walsh is asking for alot of money."
winnipegjets,3837m0,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Mon Jun 1 20:02:30 2015 UTC,"Ya, I read somewhere that it was upwards of 5 million which I think is ridiculous. I like Frolik a lot, especially his 2-way game and that he can play all forward positions, but for more than 5 million he isn't worth it. I guess he may get that as a free-agent since the forwards in free agency are weak, but I would rather have Stafford at ~4 million than Frolik at 5 million."
winnipegjets,3837m0,Reddiohead,3,Mon Jun 1 20:47:36 2015 UTC,"Especially when we can have Burmistrov for half of that. I mean, he isn't as good as Frolik, but there's more value in having Burmi for ~2.5M than there is having Frolik for 5M."
winnipegjets,3837m0,I_am_a_zebra,2,Mon Jun 1 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"Burmi was so young when we had him, people underrate him. At similar ages Burmi was slightly better imo. There are stats to back that his possession and defensive stats are better than froliks were at his age, but I'm too lazy to link. If Burmi could have quality mates on our 3rd line, he'll turn into a more feisty frolik, I guarantee it. His shot is a little weak tho."
winnipegjets,3837m0,Isomniac,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:41:59 2015 UTC,"Frolik for 5 mil is probably closer to his actual value than Stafford for 4. The underlying numbers point to Stafford as being simply on an unsustainable hot streak, while Frolik being one of the best defensive forwards in the NHL. 5 mil is overpaying for Frolik but not by much (i would value him at 4.5)."

winnipegjets,382zyt,fxcker,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:39:36 2015 UTC,Exactly.  They have no incentive to release a working game if everyone buys it like 6 months before it releases. So I'll keep them guessing a little bit more.

winnipegjets,37w9sy,I_am_a_zebra,2,Sat May 30 23:22:45 2015 UTC,So your saying there is a chance?
winnipegjets,37w9sy,biga204,2,Sun May 31 19:07:09 2015 UTC,Package them with Armia and Kostalek to Arizona for #3 and Chipchura.   Draft Proporov.  Chipchura takes the 4th line center spot in place of Slater. Proporov takes the place of Kostalek in the system.
winnipegjets,37w9sy,Roughly6Owls,9,Sun May 31 01:02:11 2015 UTC,You're massively undervaluing the #3 pick too. It'll cost a ton to get into the top 5.
winnipegjets,37w9sy,biga204,1 point,Sun May 31 13:29:33 2015 UTC,I kinda figured that but thought maybe they'd do it if they are getting two prospects.
winnipegjets,37w9sy,Roughly6Owls,3,Sun May 31 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"I could see Arizona trading down to 4 or 5 if they want a forward and one of Toronto or Hurricanes desperately wants Hanifin/Provorov, but I don't think they'll go below Strome/Marner without serious payout. Like, a Duclair level prospect in addition to trading picks."
winnipegjets,37w9sy,Gbam,3,Sun May 31 15:05:20 2015 UTC,"Um no. You are giving up 4 specs for one and a 4th line center. I love chip but his 7 minutes a game isn't what we need.  I do like the idea of trading up though, package the picks for a top 10 and I'll be happy"
winnipegjets,37w9sy,Hero_of_Brandon,2,Sun May 31 05:37:49 2015 UTC,Is Proporov the guy that played for the Wheat Kings?

winnipegjets,37w9sy,kapacj,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:49:10 2015 UTC,Kostalek is looking pretty solid actually. QMJHL defence man of the year.
winnipegjets,37w9sy,supercantaloupe,2,Sun May 31 22:41:46 2015 UTC,"As far as our prospects go, I think it would be in the Jet's best interest to go for a RW with the 17th overall pick, because that seems to be where they are most lacking as far as prospects. It may be a bit of a stretch but a player like Timo Meier would be perfect (even if the Jets need to move up a few spots to get him). He is a RW and whenever I would watch a Halifax game him and Ehlers were awesome to see play together."
winnipegjets,37w9sy,Hero_of_Brandon,1 point,Sun May 31 07:08:27 2015 UTC,"Or if Timo is not available anymore, we could take Daniel Sprong! :)"

winnipegjets,37w9sy,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Sun May 31 16:46:17 2015 UTC,Exactly. Kinda like Ehlers too. Both of them are comparable to Patrick Kane and we need people like that on the team.

winnipegjets,37n7wg,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Thu May 28 23:02:49 2015 UTC,"But why would anybody give you something valuable for one year of Dustin Byfuglien, let alone a top 6 forward or top 4 D?"

Teams like buffalo, arizona, etc  would seemingly not be worried about the short contract as they have the cap room to re sign him."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,Sumtinwong,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:44:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think anybody is suggesting the one year is a bad thing, the suggestion is that it's just not very valuable. The question is why you would give up anything - or much - of value in exchange for one year of a player's services at what's already a pretty high salary. There's no guarantee that he re-signs where he might be traded and there will be several teams with the cap space to sign him. You wouldn't be well-advised to give up serious assets in exchange for one year and a chance that he re-signs. If somebody really wants to sign him, they can compete in free agency for him and not be out any assets.  At the end of the day, 'winning' the services of Dustin Byfuglien - or any 31 year old UFA who isn't a remarkably conditioned athlete - is not much of a victory. You're still paying top dollar for declining production. This leaves you even worse off if you have to part with assets to obtain him."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:40:35 2015 UTC,Because he's a Top 2 Defenseman on a good contract. Trading for him now also gives you a jumpstart in negotiations.
winnipegjets,37n7wg,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Sat May 30 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"He's effectively off contract. You're getting a rental. I have no idea why you're having such a difficult time understanding this. A 'jumpstart' on negotiations is worth literally nothing. He's a UFA. You aren't buying your option to match a deal or get compensation in return. He's going to play where he gets paid. The number is already established - 7/$49MM. If he wants to stay where he's traded, he'll sign there. He wants to go there after his deal, he'll sign there anyway. He has literally all of the leverage. And winning the rights to pay the guy $7MM annually for 7 years is not a victory most well-managed teams want anyway."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,0,Sat May 30 16:43:48 2015 UTC,"He's effectively off contract   What? No, he still has a year left.   You're getting a rental   Still a pretty damn good rental.   I have no idea why you're having such a difficult time understanding this.   Because your argument is petty bullshit based around hating Byfuglien.   A 'jumpstart' on negotiations is worth literally nothing.   It's worth something to some teams. Look at LA and Gaborik and Sekera.   He's a UFA   Next year, he still has a year left.   You aren't buying your option to match a deal or get compensation in return.   I have no clue what this means, the NHL doesn't do option contracts.   He's going to play where he gets paid.   Yes, let's not let him walk and trade him for more than a ham sandwich.   The number is already established - 7/$49MM.   I've said already, I do agree with you on this, except the term part, because Phaneuf was a lot younger than Buff when he signed.   If he wants to stay where he's traded, he'll sign there. He wants to go there after his deal, he'll sign there anyway.   That is usually how these things work, may as well get a return for him while we can.   He has literally all of the leverage.   No, he has a year left on his contract. Then he has leverage.   And winning the rights to pay the guy $7MM annually for 7 years is not a victory most well-managed teams want anyway.   One again. HE WILL NOT GET SEVEN YEARS. I NEVER SIAD HE WOULD GET 7 YEARS. IT IS YOU WHO IS SAYING HE WILL GET SEVEN YEARS. WHICH IS DUMB.  I've seen your comments on /r/winnipeg. You really live up to your name. I am done with your trolling bullshit, this is the last time I'm going to talk with you on this subject. Have a nice day."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Sat May 30 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"You are making the point that a guy in the last year of his contract is worth a top 6 forward or a top 4 D. Which might be true. For one year. In which case, why are you bothering to make the trade for another UFA in the last year of their deal? I don't care about Dustin Byfuglien. You're the one approaching this like he's your family member. Leave aside, for a moment, the fact that we're talking about Dustin Byfuglien. Put yourself in the shoes of the GM of another team. The Jets offer you a 30 year old pending UFA with one year left on his contract. In exchange, they want a top 6 forward or a top 4 D-man. You're probably like, ""Sure, you can have my pending UFA"". And you say, yeah, but you can negotiate with him in season, we want a young guy with term. And they'll politely remind you that agents rarely negotiate in season where pending UFAs were traded to places they didn't get to choose and that you aren't getting real value in exchange for a guy who's going to test the market in 6 months. Control matters just as much as money. Unless he breaks his neck and never plays again, he's already established his value; He has all the leverage. This is why sign-and-trades are valuable. The team trading him has the ability to sign him a year in advance of his contract expiring and the team getting him gets a guy who's under contract and thus worth parting with assets to obtain.  If you want to pretend he's not getting seven years, then you don't understand collective bargaining. If you want to pretend that you're getting top talent with term in return, than you really don't understand value. And if you think that a guy like Sekera - somebody who was moved at the deadline because of the insane circumstances involving Voynov - is reminiscent of this situation, then I have no idea what to say. To your point about Phaneuf, he signed his deal in his age 30 season. Byfuglien will presumably do it in his 31st. ""Much younger"" is a bit of an overstatement. What you're suggesting you don't understand about options is exactly what's involved in a restricted free agent deal. If a restricted free agent gets moved in the final year of his deal, the team that ends up with him gets at the least a compensatory pick if he leaves, so this is valued out and priced into the trade. Also part of the value is that the team who ends up with him has the right to match any offer. That at least ensures they continue to play for you even if it's on a bridge deal into their UFA years.  This is called an option where assets are concerned and they are worth something. It's an entrenched team option inherent in the CBA. You get no such thing with a UFA. Everything you're calling a 'jumpstart on negotiation' is worth nothing. The established UFA has all the leverage because even though you get one year from him, his value ends there. After that you're overpaying for the UFA years of an old guy.  Which is exactly why Byfuglien should have been moved at the deadline last year while he still had value. One year of a UFA does not bring value in exchange except for maybe another pending UFA where the teams each address their very short term needs, or draft picks. That's because GMs are pretty good about managing their risk.   You keep underwriting your argument with the fact that he'll take fewer years than his agent and PA will recommend and that won't happen.  This is so weird that you don't understand these things. These are pretty basic valuation principles. If you think this is trolling, there's seriously something wrong with you. Of course he should be moved because you can't possibly sign him and remain competitive in a league full of smart people who laugh at teams that hand out deals like the one he's going to want. I'm taking issue with your assessment that he's worth a Top 6 forward or a Top 4 D and something else. He's only worth one year of somebody or he's worth some decent draft picks. That's it. And that's probably why he doesn't get traded; the Jets will figure they're better off trying to use him for a playoff run in the hopes he plays his ass off in a contract year. Personally I think that's dumb and would've traded him last year before the season caught up to him, but that ship has sailed."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Sat May 30 20:21:41 2015 UTC,Jay Bouwmeester in 2013 is a pretty good comp.  He was on the last year of his contract... probably more in the range of the top 30-40 d men as opposed to Buff being in the top 20-30.  Calgary got a 1st a 4th and two depth pieces for him.  Johnny Boychuck was an off season deal last year with 1 year left... got 2 second's and a third.  I would value Buff over both Boychuck and Bouwmeester.

winnipegjets,37n7wg,klevenisms204,9,Thu May 28 23:33:06 2015 UTC,I disagree with us playing better when he wasn't there. We wouldn't have been able to make it through December-January without him in the lineup. And he was in beast-mode for those too.
winnipegjets,37n7wg,Becau5eRea5on5,8,Fri May 29 03:17:30 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I think he was rushed back in after his injury, and played no where near what he played pretty injury.

winnipegjets,37n7wg,salapeno,3,Fri May 29 13:24:57 2015 UTC,We also would have won game 3 4-1 if we had a defenseman that played defense.
winnipegjets,37n7wg,QueefLatinaTheThird,1 point,Sun May 31 17:15:42 2015 UTC,That's an incredibly small sample size to draw a conclusion from.
winnipegjets,37n7wg,ehr0c,6,Fri May 29 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, i would accept moving buff but only if it means we add to our top 3, not just top 6 forwards. We have a lot of bodies on D that are fairly skilled (Yes, arguable i agree).   We need more forward depth AND consistent D-men to help whoever is in net.   When we win, all gears are turning. Our losses seem to come when we skate 200ft every 30 seconds due to lack of puck control and some poor play making skills.   I'd also fucking hate to buy a new jersey though."

winnipegjets,37n7wg,salapeno,4,Fri May 29 15:52:27 2015 UTC,How about Edmonton? Taylor Hall is signed until 2019. Why would they take Byfuglien back who is a free agent at the end of the season in exchange for an almost point per game player who is 24 years old?

winnipegjets,37n7wg,fxcker,3,Sat May 30 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting to see who gets moved. Yakupov has the most attractive contract, but it's just a bridge deal and he's the least productive of the four by quite a margin. Otherwise, Hall easily brings the most in return. He's on virtually the same contract as both Nugent-Hopkins and Eberle, and neither of those guys have ever had an 80 point season like Hall has.  Either way, somebody isn't going to have an easy time prying young, reasonably compensated guys with lots of term out of Edmonton. This talk about Dustin Byfuglien doing it is crazy unless he's coming with some serious young talent."

winnipegjets,37n7wg,salapeno,-2,Sat May 30 18:18:33 2015 UTC,Yeah. A generational talent on an ELC who slots into one of your top two lines immediately and remains under control for 6 years in exchange for one year of... Dustin Byfuglien.

winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,2,Sat May 30 21:37:54 2015 UTC,"If he wants 7 or 8 per year for max 3 years, sign him. More money or term and he should be traded."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,Beauville,8,Thu May 28 22:25:19 2015 UTC,He is certainly going to be looking for more than 3 years.
winnipegjets,37n7wg,basas22,5,Thu May 28 23:38:33 2015 UTC,I don't think I'd give him more than 6m for 3 years. I'd like to keep him if we can though.

winnipegjets,37n7wg,Bernden,2,Fri May 29 09:53:40 2015 UTC,Exactly. Contracts of that size need to be reserved for completely spectacular circumstances when you're a bargain budget team like we are.
winnipegjets,37n7wg,salapeno,3,Fri May 29 13:26:03 2015 UTC,Exactly. They're reserved for generational talents at young ages. Not UFAs in their 31st year who are completely overvalued.

I kind of like the top 10 pick just because the wealth of the prospects we already have, we would be such a dominating team in the future. http://www.draftsite.com/nhl/mock-draft/2015/ referring to this and seeing picks 7-10 (Flyers, Blue Jackets, Sharks, and the Avalanche) I would assume these teams would be interested in acquiring (a top defenceman) Buff. But, maybe we wouldn't want to trade Buff to Colorado so we don't have to see him as much. Anyways, imagine if we were able to nab someone like Ivan Provorov being in the top ten. He's a left handed defenceman (the side we need help on) and plays for our friends in Brandon already. And then take a FWD at pick 17 (our original pick)"

winnipegjets,37n7wg,brock0791,1 point,Fri May 29 00:33:24 2015 UTC,I think Buff for Callahan makes sense.  We need a scoring winger to put alongside Ehlers and Petan going forward.  They can replace his scoring with the cheaper Drouin and be at a contract wash with Buff/Callahan next season.  Going forward it allows them to not resign Buff and not have Callahan's 5.5m in 2017 when they need to pay Stamkos 9-10m

winnipegjets,37n7wg,kapacj,2,Wed Jun 3 01:08:24 2015 UTC,Trade him for Nugent-Hopkins.

He is a key piece in our offence, plays loads of minutes, doesn't get injured much, and has a huge on-ice physical presence.

winnipegjets,37n7wg,itsfoosay,1 point,Fri May 29 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"Isn't the Clit on LTIR?  He's neither a cap hit, or an attractive trade, unless Toronto is trying to free up space again"
winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Sun May 31 17:19:36 2015 UTC,"That. Morrissey is at the point where he's ready to be brought up -whether he's NHL ready is another thing, but it's time for him to dip his toes in the water. We drafted him to be another Enstrom (small/scorey/puck-mover), so let's give him a shot."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,ehr0c,-5,Sat May 30 07:33:47 2015 UTC,"He has no value left. He's already at $6MM for next year and that's the end of the line. The most you're getting is an exclusive negotiating window to sign the guy for 7/$49MM and that's only if they move him over the summer.  It's going to be difficult to imagine anybody parting with anything of value in exchange for that. One year of somebody who played the better part of the second half of the season below their pay grade is not that valuable. You'll do better at the deadline.  There's really no debate here either. Everything measurable says the guy is waiting to hang himself as the albatross around the teams neck for the foreseeable future while making it difficult to sign your younger guys long term. Everything else is just mystical nonsense about clubhouse juju.  As a side note, if you ever need an indicator as to why Chicago is as good as they are even after a rebuild (aside from Kane and Toews, obviously...), Duncan Keith - a much more productive and responsible defenseman - has an AAV of $5.5MM. That's a hell of a signing. They know when to let guys move on and they're excellent assessors of elite skill early on.  Even though Chevy comes from that system, I've seen the opposite tendencies from him."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,4,Fri May 29 02:50:11 2015 UTC,"Keith's contract isn't really a good example, it's a huge back-diving contract signed prior to the latest CBA."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,ehr0c,0,Fri May 29 16:22:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's no doubt they may come to regret those last couple of years. No question. The deal only dives on salary, though. Same cap hit throughout.  They're just lucky that Keith is probably the rare guy who can play into his late 30's and thus avoid the recapture provisions of the new CBA. What I see as worrisome is that there are people in this sub who genuinely believe we should take a guy who isn't nearly the athlete where conditioning and fitness is concerned out as far at a greater cap hit that's subject to recapture if you have to 86 him 3 or 4 years into the deal.  Great point about the difference in CBA, though."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,2,Sun May 31 06:11:35 2015 UTC,"The deal only dives on salary, though. Same cap hit throughout.   Naturally. Cap hit is always the same throughout the length of a contract.   What I see as worrisome is that there are people in this sub who genuinely believe we should take a guy who isn't nearly the athlete where conditioning and fitness is concerned out as far at a greater cap hit that's subject to recapture if you have to 86 him 3 or 4 years into the deal.   Recapture only applies to contracts 7 years or longer, so we could theoretically sign Buff for 6 years and not have to worry about it.   Buff is always going to come at a greater cap hit than Keith, or anyone signed pre-2012. If you knock the back-diving years off Keith's contract (for argument's sake let's start in the 19-20 season since that's the first year he's making less than half the highest year of the contract, 3.5M compared to 8M), his cap hit jumps to $6.9MM. Take off the year at 4.5 in 18-19 and it jumps to $7.2MM."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,ehr0c,0,Sun May 31 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"Right, but if you sign him to 6 years, you're giving him north of $8M AAV given where the total dollars are going to line up. It's still a bad proposition.  The truth is that Keith would have still gotten paid, he was just able to solidify more years because he's the sort of guy you lock up like that. So given where Byfuglien's cap hit has been and where it's going, you're talking about Keith coming at a relative discount. Especially if you factor in that Keith is likely to continue playing at a higher level for longer than Dustin Byfuglien will end up. Just my opinion.  In a cap system you have to be really careful about how you project talent and regression. The question is whether you want to take the risk on a guy like Byfuglien - or Ladd even - when you need to lock up for young guys for a long time."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:32:50 2015 UTC,"Right, but if you sign him to 6 years, you're giving him north of $8M AAV given where the total dollars are going to line up. It's still a bad proposition.   You don't know that, you're assuming. Granted I don't know that it's wrong, but I'm not the one making the claim.    So given where Byfuglien's cap hit has been and where it's going, you're talking about Keith coming at a relative discount.   Keith is at a discount because the contract he signed cheats the salary cap. You can't compare pre-2012 contracts with post-2012 contracts, it's apples and oranges.    The question is whether you want to take the risk on a guy like Byfuglien - or Ladd even - when you need to lock up for young guys for a long time.   Agreed. I think we'd likely be a worse team in the short-term if we moved Buff, but potentially a better team in the long-term depending on what happens with the cap. Ladd I think is a no-questions extension though as long as he's willing to stay. Getting rid of your captain does awful things to morale."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:21:46 2015 UTC,"I'm making an educated guess on the basis of what's considered acceptable total money. At the moment, that's somewhere around $49MM. Thus, shorter term, greater AAV.  As far as extending Ladd, this morale thing is not important. Winning cures everything and I don't think anybody is going to truly value Ladd as the $6MM guy he's going to want to be paid as. This is the same issue as Byfuglien presents. Unless you think that paying them more makes them better players, you have to get worse to get better. Part of getting better is using the money that would otherwise be tied up in one player to upgrade lesser positions so that you're strong throughout. And everybody has to be honest with themselves as to how far you're really going with this team. We aren't talking about letting go of generational talents here. These are above average guys who are going to be worth less than their contracts before they're halfway up and they'll be expensive all the way throughout so you don't even get a discount in the early years.  I'm saying that as a team that wants to operate within their own internal cap framework that happens to be below the league's ceiling, paying the same guys more money is exactly how you remain mediocre. Sometimes that's a risk and it nearly always requires a couple of bad years where guys are developing. There's no other way."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,6,Tue Jun 2 01:34:29 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna ignore everything you said before the last sentence because a lot of it is just straight up crap. About the Chevy contracts though, look at some of his signings. Ladd's cap hit is only 4.5 mil, Little's is 4.7. They are both legitimate first line players in the NHL, and especially in Ladd's case because he was a UFA. If you want to get more recent, look at Perreault. 3 Million, that's all it took. If there's one thing that's his weakness, he seems to overvalue grit, but when Tanner Glass is making 1.5M a season, a guy like Thorburn is going to look to that for his comparable."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,kingofspoonerisms,-3,Fri May 29 05:58:24 2015 UTC,"You can think it's straight up crap all you like. Yours is an opinion not based on fact. You happen to like the player - that's great. It's not relevant to the discussion.  Common sense, analytics, conventional statistics, history - all of them say that signing a guy in his 31st year to a seven year contract is a bad idea. In any sport.  If you think it's such crap, try and make an argument otherwise.  Ladd is a free agent at the same time as Byfuglien. His contract at the time was reasonable for a guy with his productivity. If you sign him, you're giving him a raise which makes that a bad signing too. Little's contract was decent, but even a broken clock is right twice a day. Lastly, Perreault is probably overpaid at $3MM/annually.  Anaheim replaced him with Rickard Rackell who is four years younger, nearly as productive, and earns $925K annually. If Perreault doesn't score 4 goals in one game as a completely outlying event, you might have got his max career production from him once again. As it were, he gave that to us anyway, but it was because he was injured and because he scored 4 goals in a game that Florida slept through.  Outside of Little, Chevy's signings have been bad. Thorburn, Stuart, Kane, Bogosian, Pavelec - all bad contracts. He didn't sign Frolik when he should have and now he's not going to be able to. He's going to end up signing Drew Stafford which will be a huge mistake, and if he signs either of Byfuglien or Ladd, somebody is going to offer-sheet Trouba. Not to mention that Scheifele  needs to be re-signed and that the entire core is going to be on the downside of their career before anything worthwhile from the system is prepared to contribute in a meaningful way.  You don't have to like it, but good teams don't give guys like Dustin Byfuglien security into retirement. You really want him until his 38th year making $7MM AAV?"
winnipegjets,37n7wg,kingofspoonerisms,7,Fri May 29 18:00:26 2015 UTC,Perreault is probably overpaid at $3MM/annually   Lmao sure

winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Fri May 29 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"Actually the part I agree with is that his comparable would probably be Phaneuf. The idea that he has no trade value is absurd. When you put up the points Byfuglien does as a defenseman that is nearly impossible to find in today's NHL. You said Chevy's signings have all been bad, I showed you examples. That is not opinion, that is fact. He managed to steal Ladd and Little for those prices, even Perreault was a really good signing, because he eats top 6 minutes for breakfast, he puts up points at an extraordinary rate (which he has his entire career). Thorburn and Stuart, like I said, Chevy overvalues Grit. Pavelec was coming off a career year as an early 20 year old, Kane was coming off a 30 goal season, and it still isn't a bad contract for the production we got. Bogo was coming off of a 30 point season as a 22 year old defenseman. When you look at those at the time they were signed, only Thorburn and Stuart are the really bad contracts.  And who's saying we should sign him to seven years? I've never heard anyone say that. I know I haven't. Just because these guys are in their 30's doesn't mean their value immediately drops off a cliff. It's a gradual descent, and when you're at the level of Byfuglien and Ladd, there's no reason to believe they can't produce for at least another 5 years. As long as the term's right, we should pay them, and they've earned the right to get paid."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,kingofspoonerisms,0,Fri May 29 18:23:38 2015 UTC,"You're trying to assess value in a vacuum. Nobody has to explicitly say 'we should sign him to a 7 year deal' because that's the market. If you want Dustin Byfuglien, his agent and the NHLPA are going to make sure he gets comparable money and term to Dion Phaneuf. Full stop. You just decide you want him for 3 years and demand he take it. Things don't work like that. Which is exactly why you can't sign him. In today's NHL you can't sign a guy for 7 years - a guy who has spent a large portion of his career overweight and disinterested - knowing you're going to get only three productive years because you'll hamstring yourself for the last four. I wouldn't call a guy like Dustin Byfuglien the sort of player you expect to age well.  The reason I say he has no trade value is because he's only good for one year for anybody. He has no term left; He's essentially a rental. Nobody is going to give up anything of any greater value in exchange except for another expensive free agent in the final year of his deal. Or maybe you get a couple of picks. But what are you really getting other than the year? He's available to sign with whomever he likes once the year is up.  As far as Perreault goes, I was making the point that he was fairly easily replaced by somebody younger and cheaper so Anaheim didn't 'lose out' on him; they found a replacement for him in a cheaper, more controllable player. He may have been a reasonable value on the free agent market, but that doesn't mean he still is $3MM against the cap on a budget team."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Sat May 30 00:02:47 2015 UTC,Rakell scored .45ish ppg which is pretty respectable for a rookie but lets see how well he can repeat it. The only reason he's  so cheap is cause he's on an ELC  Perrault scored .65ish ppg which is not the same at all. He was the hottest scorer in the league before he got hurt. All of his fancy stats show he is the real deal
winnipegjets,37n7wg,kingofspoonerisms,0,Sat May 30 06:41:37 2015 UTC,"We desperately need to remove Perreault's 4 goal game from the discussion here. It's an outlier event, it's not repeatable, and it doesn't reflect the true form of the competition. He shot 57% that game. I don't think it needs to form part of the discussion. And since he only played 62 games, we can normalize by leaving it out given that another 20 games will bring him back into line with his career averages. That said, I realize that's only one season and maybe this was an unlikely breakout in a player's age 27 season, so it's debatable in any case. But let's remove it and give him 1 goal for arguments sake. That's a more robust measure.  The true measure is Points per 60 minutes so we can account for difference in ice time. With the caveat here that small sample sizes lead to poor results - in the same way that streaks are irrelevant blips - I'll still mention them for information's sake.   A) Perreault averages over 4 more minutes per night on a better line.   B) Perreault's P/60 last year (without the 4 goals but 1 instead) was 2.26 while Rakell's was 2.08 - again, linemates matter. And this puts him middle of the pack for top six forwards in the league which is actually really good. The problem is that he played 15-20 fewer games than the rest of those guys and he has a history of durability issues. Interestingly enough, in Perreault's real rookie season he was a 2.01 P/60 guy and three years older in his debut. Rackell is a 2.08 so it'll be interesting to see what his ceiling is.   C) Their advanced stat numbers are very similar even though one plays on the 3rd line and the other the second.   D) Rickard Rackell earns less than a 1/3rd of what Perreault does. It's not immaterial that he's on an ELC. That's kind of the point. Free agents are expensive where close-to-replacement guys on ELCs are cheap. If you had three Rakells you would be much better off than having one Matthieu Perreault and Rakells aren't that hard to find. Value matters in a cap system. And I'm not saying Perreault is a bad value, 'cause he's not. He's a good value. I'm saying the idea that he's an otherworldly value isn't anywhere close to true. He's middle of the pack at best.   E) Rackell is 22 years old, Perreault is 27."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,WpgTroglodyte,1 point,Sat May 30 15:50:44 2015 UTC,"Coulda, woulda, shoulda man... the four goal game happened. You cant dismiss it. Thats like assuming Schiefele should have scored five more goals because he hit ao many posts  to start the year.  Look Rakell seems like a pretty good player no doubt. Its not  like the Jets had a shot at him and every Ducks fan I know is choked they let Perrault walk. Its not like the ducks are near the cap.  Perrault was an elite player for us last season. He is the reason our powerplay clicked when he was in the lineup. His contract  is incredible value and you're  really kidding yourself for thinking otherwise."
winnipegjets,37n7wg,TheFlappyGiraffe,0,Sat May 30 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"I'm removing it as consideration for normalization. If we were working towards the median of a reasonable sample set, we'd be throwing out the outliers both to the top and bottom. He scored 22% of his season total in one game on almost 60% shooting against a team on the back end of a 6 game road trip. I don't think that's the sort of thing we build a case for long-term value upon.  Don't take this to suggest that he's bad value - I've made the opposite point that he's good value for a top six guy and I'm only using Rackell as an example because that's who he was given up for, but Perreault is not elite by any measure no matter what. If that argument is that he's good value at $3MM, point taken. If the argument is that he's elite and unreplaceable at $3MM, that's simply not true as proven by a guy like Rackell.  That was the point I was originally trying to make."

winnipegjets,377eif,Hero_of_Brandon,2,Tue May 26 05:32:13 2015 UTC,The weirdest part is that I don't like the show Sherlock because Cumberbatch is too much like House.... even though House is based off of Sherlock Holmes.  :S  Old habits die hard.

You will greatly reduce the chance of you getting skin cancer.   My mom had skin cancer, she ended up having to have a chunk of the skin on her leg cut off, and had to graft skin from her back onto it.  Then it was many many years of checkups.  It's worth it for me to take a minute or two every few hours I'm out in the sun to put some on."

winnipegjets,370pkl,Harborcoat84,11,Sat May 23 19:51:55 2015 UTC,"Our current lines:  Forwards:  Ladd -- Little -- Wheeler  Perreault -- Schiefele -- [a]  [b] -- Lowry -- [c]  Thornburn -- [d] -- [e]   Defense:  Myers -- Enstrom Trobua -- Stuart Byfuglien -- [f]   [a] --> Our biggest concern this off-season by far. Getting a UFA top 6 forward is a big gamble and will probably require paying a lot. Either Frolik or Stafford would be a good choice for this but considering that they haven't been resigned yet it isn't looking good. Burmistrov looks like he is coming back, if he is willing to play with Winnipeg he could be a good backup plan and Chevy can try to catch a UFA(I'd prefer Burmi start on the third line). Trading Buff for a top 6 forward is another option we could consider.  [b] and [c] --> Ehlers will most likely fill one of these spots. Signing Stempniak or Tlusty would be good for the other. We probably could sign a UFA as well.  [d] --> Copp, might fill this spot.  [e] --> Armia, Halischuk, Tlusty (if we get both Stemp and him), Peluso. Lots of options here. Keep at least one to be the 13th forward.  [f] --> Chiarot, sign Postma as well. Morrissey starts on the Moose and is the first call up."

winnipegjets,370pkl,deus216,2,Sun May 24 01:23:58 2015 UTC,"I think moving Buff is a necessity.  We have a log jam at D with our other top 5 under control for 3 years and Morrissey and Kostalek being ready for 2016-2017.  I'd look at Tampa as a team in win now mode who needs to make a lot of cap room after next season to resign all their young studs.  Taking Buff's expiring contract for this year and sending us one of their big contracts like Ryan Callahan back could help both teams and fill our need [a]. Possibly include Hutch in a deal and have Hellebuyck start with the big club.  [B] [c] Resign Frolik.  Resign Stempniak or another aging Jagr type player willing to take a one year contract.  okay to overpay in this spot as long as it's one year.  [d] [e] Burmi gets one spot other goes to Copp unless Kosmachuk or one of the other guys from the A has a great camp.  [f] and Buff's empty spot go to pardy and a resigned Chairot.  Morrissey and Kostalek are possible Pardy/injury replacements mid season.  Sets our team up for conference runs starting in 2017 with a team that looks like the following and should be cap managable through 2019  Wheeler-Sheifele-Ladd  Callahan-Lowry-Ehlers  Perrault-Little-Petan  Frolik-Burmi-Copp  (De Leo, Armia, Lemieux)  Trouba--Morrissey  Myers--Enstrom  Kostalek--Chairot  Hellebucyk Comrie"

winnipegjets,370pkl,IronRook,1 point,Sat May 23 23:10:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for this
winnipegjets,370pkl,Not_Jacob_Trouba,5,Sun May 24 02:51:16 2015 UTC,Please based Chevy. Resign Stempniak. Him and Burmi on the pk would be ridiculous and he really solidifies our bottom 6.
winnipegjets,370pkl,BrawnyJohnny,4,Sun May 24 18:01:01 2015 UTC,"Misc thoughts:  -Fro is probably a lost cause. He didn't extend when he could and looks like he's going to be costly, meanwhile we need to pay Ladd, Lowry, Shuffles, Trouba and Hutch next year  -Retaining Stafford should be the biggest priority as re-signs go. Keep him playing with Scheifele and Wheels.  -Galiardi, Tlusty, Cormier can walk.  -Stempniak should, and likely will be re-signed and is key for our bottom 6.  -Sign Chiarot to 2 years, see how good he can be without Buff. I'd like to keep both Postma and Pardy but I feel they'll take Postma and let Pardy walk.  -Extend Ladd this summer so Lawless won't spend next season questioning his commitment.  -Sign Lemieux, he's going to be great.  -1 year deal for Slater while we develop Copp. While Maurice said he doesn't want to bring in young guys to play 4th line minutes, someone has to and we have no scorers on the 4th."
winnipegjets,370pkl,ComplexChristian,3,Sun May 24 03:06:27 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Lemieux get signed, the guy is a young goal scorer and has size."
winnipegjets,370pkl,ComplexChristian,3,Sat May 23 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"Please resign Stempniak, he's really good in our bottom 6.   Here's the possible forward lines in my opinion:  Ladd -- Little -- Wheeler/Frolik Perreault/Ehlers/Stafford -- Schiefele -- Wheeler/Burmi  Perreault/Ehlers -- Lowry -- Burmi/Stempniak  Thorburn -- Copp/Slater -- Stempniak/Armia   If we resign Frolik but not Stafford  Ladd -- Little -- Frolik Perreault/Ehlers -- Schiefele -- Wheeler Perreault/Ehlers -- Lowry -- Burmi Thorburn -- Copp/Slater -- Stempniak/Armia   If we resign Stafford but not Frolik  Ladd -- Little -- Wheeler Perreault/Ehlers -- Schiefele -- Stafford  Perreault/Ehlers -- Lowry -- Burmi Thorburn -- Copp/Slater -- Stempniak/Armia   Here's the possible defense lines in my opinion:  Myers -- Enstrom Trouba -- Stuart Byfuglien -- Chiarot   Resign Pardy for cheap. Sign Lemieux, and De Leo on an ELC and have them play for the Moose. Sign Olkinuora to backup for the Moose. Never ever resign Ellerby."
winnipegjets,370pkl,TheFlappyGiraffe,1 point,Sun May 24 22:52:10 2015 UTC,Sign Olkinuora to backup for the Moose.    Isn't it going to be Hellebuyck / Comrie?
winnipegjets,370pkl,ComplexChristian,2,Sun May 24 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"Is Comrie's junior career done? I'm not that sure... because if so, then I'd have Comrie backup for the moose."
winnipegjets,370pkl,TheFlappyGiraffe,2,Mon May 25 00:47:40 2015 UTC,"He's d+2, so he's eligible for AHL."
winnipegjets,370pkl,KaytinGreyshade,1 point,Mon May 25 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have him jump to the AHL then, have him develop and learn the system there before he goes to the Jets and becomes our own Carey Price :D"

winnipegjets,370pkl,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Mon May 25 04:22:08 2015 UTC,"Personally I think we'll see Fro walk and have Ehlers fill the hole that would create. He's a great player but his salary would hit hard and getting Ehlers some NHL experience outside of the pre-season would be great.  Other than that I'm not certain of anything. I think getting Staff and Stemp back would be good moves, but we'll have to wait and see what they want to do."
winnipegjets,370pkl,EnigmaticTortoise,2,Sun May 24 01:39:43 2015 UTC,"For the love of all that is holy, sign Stafford."
winnipegjets,370pkl,Becau5eRea5on5,8,Sun May 24 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer Frolik. Lately I've even been getting crazy thoughts in my head the we just let those two go and put Burmi, Stempniak, and Ehlers in their places."
winnipegjets,370pkl,EnigmaticTortoise,1 point,Sun May 24 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a big Frolik fan, but Stafford put up fairly reliable scoring, which I still think is one of the biggest issues facing the team."
winnipegjets,370pkl,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Sun May 24 13:31:09 2015 UTC,The most ironic thing about Stafford's scoring is that long term it wouldn't be very reliable. Just look at his shot percentage numbers from the last 5 seasons. You can even see which ones are contract seasons by the huge bumps. Maybe the key is just to give him a ton of one year contracts?
winnipegjets,370pkl,Sumtinwong,2,Sun May 24 16:07:56 2015 UTC,"Hopefully enough of our promising prospects turn out that we only need him for a couple years. I think it's hard to base that on his time in buffalo though, both him and Myers put up much better numbers here."
winnipegjets,370pkl,Becau5eRea5on5,0,Sun May 24 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"I've said this before though: Buffalo only blew chunks the last two seasons. 4 seasons ago they were in the playoffs, three seasons ago they were a point from making it away. Stafford is also at the age where you can start to expect his production to go down."
winnipegjets,370pkl,Sumtinwong,1 point,Sun May 24 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"You could also use a similar argument about Myers.  But I would assume you are high on Myers (as you should be).  I don't think Stafford will be a point per game player, but he seems to have good chemistry with the team and shouldn't be written off.  His age is a valid concern but he is only 2years + 3months older than frolik, unless my match sucks.  Full Disclosure:  Sabres fan pre Jets 2.0"
winnipegjets,370pkl,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Wed May 27 01:53:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Myers doesn't have great fancy stats either. Part of the reason I  want to keep Enstrom is to mentor Myers, then maybe we'll see that number go up. Also, Myers is reaching the height of his career, while Stafford is going to start to decline. Frolik meanwhile, is roughly 1/2 to 1 contract younger than Stafford to look at it another way.  Like I said though, I've been getting crazy thoughts lately, and while I prefer Frolik, I won't be torn up if we don't land either of them."
winnipegjets,370pkl,brock0791,1 point,Wed May 27 01:59:59 2015 UTC,"Thats fair, I hope we get at least 1 of the 2.  I just don't see Burmi being anything more than a bottom 6 player (at this point)... I mean the KHL isn't exactly known for IMPROVING players lol.  As for Ehlers i think he would be a gamble on the 2nd line, some players transition to the NHL better than others.   Edit: And because of his size I would feel more comfortable having him on the 3rd line playing with Lowry and Stempniak/thorbs."
winnipegjets,370pkl,QueefLatinaTheThird,1 point,Wed May 27 02:54:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my big thing about doing that. We don't have a genuine, proven 2nd line RW in this scenario. That's a problem."
winnipegjets,36tpah,carsonbiz,8,Fri May 22 01:11:50 2015 UTC,"We have a wealth of goaltender prospects, but otherwise..the position is still up in the air."
winnipegjets,36tpah,Reed_Solomon,2,Fri May 22 02:03:55 2015 UTC,"We have a wealth of goaltender prospects, but our goalie coach sucks."
winnipegjets,36tpah,ComplexChristian,5,Fri May 22 16:21:26 2015 UTC,This.  The best thing we could do this offseason is show Wade Flaherty the door.
winnipegjets,36tpah,mysticsavage,5,Fri May 22 16:34:26 2015 UTC,Dusty Imoo deserves that job.
winnipegjets,36tpah,pinkpools,2,Fri May 22 19:49:51 2015 UTC,Who is Dusty Imoo?  If he's the goalie coach for the IceCaps (now Moose) then I agree.
winnipegjets,36tpah,HollowWiener,2,Sat May 23 23:25:20 2015 UTC,You would be correct.
winnipegjets,36tpah,KillEmAll83,3,Sun May 24 04:22:34 2015 UTC,"And then after he sees the door, we light him on fire, right?"
winnipegjets,36tpah,IronRook,5,Fri May 22 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly though, we rushed Hutch to fill our goaltending gap, and might have broken him under a too heavy workload too soon.  Let Hutch develop as a backup, maybe to take over starter once Pav's contract is up, then call up Helly after he's had time to develop in the A, maybe spark a goalie controversy with two legit starters."
winnipegjets,36tpah,HollowWiener,4,Fri May 22 16:31:41 2015 UTC,Let's just not screw it up like Vancouver always seems to.
winnipegjets,36tpah,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Fri May 22 23:19:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should rush him either, but I think the more important thing to not do is put too much pressure on him too quickly.  Playing in front of Winnipeg fans next year is going to help these young guys out so much in their development, the last thing we need to do is expect too much too quickly."
winnipegjets,36tpah,Imthecoolestdudeever,4,Fri May 22 08:47:39 2015 UTC,I feel sorry for anyone who starts their NHL career with Winnipeg then gets traded away.  It'll be disappointing to learn that not all fans are as awesome
winnipegjets,36tpah,MannoSlimmins,3,Fri May 22 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"Dumb headline. We have a wealth of prospects but no set starter, which is exactly why people want to rush Hellebuyck. Given his performance so far, I'm honestly not sure its fair to call it ""rushing"""
winnipegjets,36tpah,rookie-mistake,3,Fri May 22 03:52:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Halles performance in the AHL and the IIHF World Championship, it's not rushing.  But I agree with the other commentators, too. Let Hutch prove that he can continue to be a brick wall in the net.  It's better to have 2 amazing goalies than 1 amazing, and one okay"
winnipegjets,36tpah,MannoSlimmins,2,Fri May 22 13:27:48 2015 UTC,That's sort of the definition of rushing
winnipegjets,36tpah,QueefLatinaTheThird,2,Fri May 22 20:18:56 2015 UTC,Letting him play (and dominate) against men for a few seasons before introducing him to the NHL as a backup? You must have a strange dictionary if thats your definition
winnipegjets,36tpah,rookie-mistake,0,Fri May 22 20:24:20 2015 UTC,He didn't dominate at the ahl and didn't dominate at iihf.  He was the goalie for team USA.  They had one of the best defensive teams in the league so he wasn't facing very legit shots from dangerous spots until they faced Russia and got obliterated
winnipegjets,36tpah,QueefLatinaTheThird,1 point,Fri May 22 20:36:10 2015 UTC,"He still had the best numbers of any goalie at the tourney while being named to the All-star team, all on a team no one had making the medal round. You wouldn't call that dominating?"
winnipegjets,36tpah,Becau5eRea5on5,0,Fri May 22 23:17:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he didn't have a good tournament.  I'm excited to have him be a part of the team.  He was just on one of the top teams in the tournament with solid defense, and there wasn't many games where he was under siege from a better team.  I just don't see the point of rushing him to the NHL because he had a good stretch of like 6 games in international hockey.  He had a save percentage of 92% and 2.6 GAA in St. Johns, which isn't exactly studly numbers yet, although he's clear that he's the type of keeper who can catch fire.  And putting him on the bench for most of his games won't really help the guys game out either.  Goalies just take type to develop.  Pavy still has two years left on his contract, and doesn't exactly have trade value, or time remaining on his contract to entice other teams.  We'd just be eating salary.  Just be patient.  We aren't making a cup run next year, but we might in 4 years.  He'll be at the MTS centre, regardless, and I'm sure they'd let him practice with the team to see how it works out for him."
winnipegjets,36tpah,QueefLatinaTheThird,1 point,Fri May 22 23:32:42 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see him stay with the Moose for next year absolutely. I just don't think you're giving him enough credit as far as his numbers go. The IceCaps were pretty bad last season, which helps explain the GAA number, but to post a .921 SV% in your first pro season is pretty impressive. But you're right, let's keep him with the Moose and see what happens next year, and maybe the year after that."
winnipegjets,36tpah,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Fri May 22 23:39:54 2015 UTC,"Hey, my hats off to the guy.  He played amazing for an AHL goalie at the worlds, and he seemed to fit right in.  I've just been reading a lot of stuff about people saying they want to have a Hutch/Hellboy combo and get rid of Pav next year which would seem insane, Oilers level management choices to have a sophomore/rookie combo in the NHL."
winnipegjets,36tpah,QueefLatinaTheThird,1 point,Fri May 22 23:42:41 2015 UTC,Pretty sure USA got out shot almost every game - see the bronze medal game against Pav and a Czechs especially...
winnipegjets,36tpah,kingofspoonerisms,1 point,Mon May 25 15:36:58 2015 UTC,"I'd give him another year in the AHL, and let Hutch show his worth since he is battling for a new contract.  If by the deadline Hutch isn't preforming ship him out as a rental backup and then call up Hellebuyck to the squad for the playoff push."
winnipegjets,36tpah,BrawnyJohnny,7,Fri May 22 02:59:34 2015 UTC,Nope never let hutch go. He's going to be something special.. same with helly. Goalies just take a bit to find their game
winnipegjets,36tpah,ReverseOrange,1 point,Fri May 22 04:58:32 2015 UTC,Hence give him the year to prove his worth.
winnipegjets,36tpah,BrawnyJohnny,3,Fri May 22 13:23:23 2015 UTC,In my opinion a years not enough for a goalie
winnipegjets,36tpah,ReverseOrange,2,Fri May 22 17:03:39 2015 UTC,"IIRC it's a sample size of about 3000 shots to get results that are actually meaningful, which is something like 2-3 seasons."

winnipegjets,36r0vl,rookie-mistake,1 point,Thu May 21 15:42:21 2015 UTC,3-4th line wing probably. He can replace Halischuk

winnipegjets,36podq,BrawnyJohnny,5,Thu May 21 03:13:40 2015 UTC,Getzlaf and Perry were selected by the Ducks 19th and 28th respectively. In the same draft. Close enough?

winnipegjets,36podq,randylaheyjr,3,Fri May 22 17:18:12 2015 UTC,How was Pastrnak only drafted at 25th? Seems like quite a big miss by most teams.
winnipegjets,36podq,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Thu May 21 03:21:23 2015 UTC,"A draft deep with North American skaters, in combination with a general tendency of north American teams to underscout the smaller European leagues (Pastrnak was playing in Allsvenskan, the 2nd tier Swedish league, when he was drafted). Also, even for Europeans, Pastrnak was only the 5th ranked European Skater coming into the draft last season, and it's not like the guys ranked higher than him (Ehlers, Nylander, Vrana, or Kapanen) look bad.  For comparison, most mock drafts for this year don't even have the top 4 European skaters going in the first round."

The Jets do almost nothing 'extra' outside of the game whereas many other arenas have plenty of events, live music, contests, face painting, beer gardens, etc. outside of the arena and in the lobby.   During the playoffs especially, where the white out was fantastic, but nothing else was supported or done to improve the fan experience outside of or around the arena. Therefore, props to the fans.

The Fans are great and the arena small, but there's just not all that much to do elsewhere. We hit Boston pizza, but it's not like say columbus where there's 50 bars within walking distance, and the prices of getting don't help either (easily the most expensive arena I've been to!).

winnipegjets,369uqy,TomServoMST3K,2,Sun May 17 19:55:42 2015 UTC,"Kinda hyped for the Pav/Hellebuyck duo next year, hopefully we can get something solid in return for Hutch."
winnipegjets,369uqy,BrawnyJohnny,4,Sun May 17 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"Why not try and get value for Pav? Annoying contract. .920 is unsustainable, the late season heroics were, in large part a fortunate convenience. Hutch/ Hell is what I want, hell looks like the favourite between those two. Maybe start pav/hell, hutch starts moose. At any half decent, money-saving trade for Pav we take. Need bolstering elsewhere and any cap available for ladd/buff."
winnipegjets,369uqy,Reddiohead,4,Mon May 18 01:26:27 2015 UTC,"The reasons you gave (contract, gaa unsustainable), are why teams won't trade for him. Remember, any complaint you have about a player is forefront for any GM considering a trade."
winnipegjets,369uqy,monkey_bojangles,1 point,Mon May 18 03:16:53 2015 UTC,"Not everyone considers pavelec redundant. Any given team's circumstance dictates needs for different moves, and what is considered a palatable player/move. Something will come up eventually. Especially after that sexy .920, which again, ~90% chance it's unsustainable IMO."
winnipegjets,369uqy,Reddiohead,3,Mon May 18 03:43:03 2015 UTC,Smith only let in one goal for Canada. I don't want Smith near any team I cheer for.
winnipegjets,369uqy,Cannibalheart,0,Mon May 18 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly I just wrote my first comment to see what type of response I would get back before going on with my true thought.  As much as I would like to see the Jets make it to a cup final next year, I can't see it happening at all before we acquire or develop another T3 forward and a reliable goalie. With this in mind the Jets will still be a cup contender but still in that grey zone of being a development team.  Just wanted to state the Jets needs before we get into the whole goaltending situation.  Contracts:   Pav (27) $3.9M UFA 2017-18 Hutch (25) $575,000 RFA 2016-17 Hellebuyck (21) $667,500 RFA 2017-18 Comrie (19) $636,667 RFA 2017-18   Next year will be a huge year for the Jets to make a decision for who they will go with in the future as far as goaltending. Hutch is playing for a new contract, Pav is proving to everyone why he should be number one, Connor is making a statement as to why he deserves to be on the Jets roster, and Comrie is doing his thing (developing) maybe even for the Moose.  For this season I can't see Pav getting traded because its very rare to see two unexperienced goalies make up the backend. So it comes down to who whether we keep all three other goalies for this year, or make a trade on one either at the draft (which I doubt) or at the deadline.  If Hutch is having a mediocre year I wouldn't be surprised to see a trade with him at the deadline in another blockbuster trade, to address some of the Jets needs similar to this past deadline, maybe in a package deal with Scheifele if we don't see improvement in his development. Or watch Hutch play for the Moose, to see Hellebuyck get called up and start some for the Jets.  When it comes down to it this season is biggest for Hutch because his contract is up at the end of the year.  I don't want to speculate for every goalie so I'll leave it at that for the time. I love discussing though so I appreciate feedback and at the end of the day the Jets are in a good spot!  GO JETS GO!"
winnipegjets,369uqy,BrawnyJohnny,3,Mon May 18 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"Package Sheif???  He is still young and his attitude exhibits everything the jets, and every other team in the league desperately want in a player.  Plus he is a pretty decent player, I will take his growing pains over trading and potentially getting another locker room cancer."
winnipegjets,369uqy,mello__yello,1 point,Mon May 18 20:09:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly, this is what makes him so valuable to any team. With his contract expiring at the end of next season, the Jets will have to resign him for at least $4M, to go along with this Ladd, Lowry, Buff, and Trouba will all need new contracts too.  Lets also keep in mind the Jets wealth of centre prospects, including Copp, Petan, and Lodge.  At the end of the day the Jets are going to have to make some type of move because they'll be hitting the cap pretty quickly with all these prospects growing up."
winnipegjets,369uqy,BrawnyJohnny,2,Mon May 18 20:28:31 2015 UTC,Pavelec had 13 saves and was scored on 3 times. Hellebuyck made 38 saves and had a SHUTOUT. They were playing each other..   Who would YOU rather have start for the Winnipeg Jets next year?
winnipegjets,369uqy,fxcker,6,Mon May 18 00:56:49 2015 UTC,It's one game. Pavs saved 38/40 versus Canada in the best goalie game versus Canada in the tourney.
winnipegjets,369uqy,Bernden,1 point,Mon May 18 04:05:37 2015 UTC,It's hard. Pavelec can be so good but he is so inconsistent. I would love to be loyal to him but he just hasn't proven that he can do it.

winnipegjets,366m7s,brazeau,5,Sat May 16 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't like Pavelec most of the season.  But I do think he deserves another shot with the Jets. The playoff mistakes were mostly because of Buff not being where he should (If you see a hotspot of goals against the jets, you'll see they mostly came from directly to his right). I won't fault him for that.  I do think we need to play Connor next year, though. I have a feeling he will be our Carey Price"
winnipegjets,366m7s,MannoSlimmins,5,Sat May 16 20:57:36 2015 UTC,I don't think you can count on someone to be Carey price. Jussayin
winnipegjets,366m7s,Not_Jacob_Trouba,2,Sun May 17 00:23:54 2015 UTC,"I think that if, after a season or two of experience, he can play as well in the NHL as he did the AHL, he will be our most important player."
winnipegjets,366m7s,MannoSlimmins,5,Sun May 17 00:25:14 2015 UTC,He's young still. Don't put all that hope into a guy who has never played a game in the NHL. Stranger things have happened than a decent prospect not panning out.
winnipegjets,366m7s,Not_Jacob_Trouba,1 point,Sun May 17 00:32:07 2015 UTC,True. I just think i'd be heartbroken if he wasn't amazing in net.
winnipegjets,366m7s,MannoSlimmins,3,Sun May 17 00:39:47 2015 UTC,Agreed.   even as a Pav hater in the past two seasons.
winnipegjets,366m7s,Vuldr,11,Sat May 16 20:01:21 2015 UTC,"These articles are becoming click bait.   Im sick and tired of reading peoples opinions on the team, or its players, who never even watch a Jets game. They are quick to tell us strengths and weaknesses without even knowing a damn thing about the chemistry of the team, or a specific players long term playing history.  No, we should not trade Pavs. He's been a great guy on and off the ice, he's been our strongest player at times, and I don't think he's that sought after.  We keep playing him, he's shown he's quality when the team in front of him plays solid defensively, we don't rush our young talent, and all ends well. We have great prospects, and there is ZERO fucking reason to rush a young goalie who isn't ready. It barely, if ever works out well for anyone involved."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Imthecoolestdudeever,2,Sat May 16 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"Our recent success has new people looking at us. A lot of people aren't gonna understand what we're going for in the long term. It's easy to write a ""trade Pavelec "" article right now. Most of these articles are just scratching the surface and haven't really paid attention to what Chevy has been trying to do in the last few years.  Quick edit though... I'm not implying Winnipeg whiteout is bad or anything. This isn't the only article I've read about Pavelec lately haha. Trading Pavelec now has a lot of good points but I just don't see it happening... Chevy is a wizard though so we'll see what goes down this off season."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Vuldr,1 point,Sat May 16 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"Oh Winnipeg white out isn't bad at all, it just seems like something to get visits because both Helle and Pavs are playing hockey today. Almost as we speak.  There's no sense in trading Pavs, unless they get some insane offer for him. We keep him, let our next gen of goalies develop, and do as most successful franchises do when addressing their goal situations."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Imthecoolestdudeever,1 point,Sat May 16 21:22:09 2015 UTC,"It's fair to say it was written because both are playing, it was meant to be topical. To the point of will they trade him was not the point. I've been following the team since they came back, Chevy is not one to build a team through trades, so I don't think it will happen, but if they have thought about it, now is the best time."

winnipegjets,366m7s,Reed_Solomon,6,Wed May 20 23:53:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I think we should trade everyone who has Allan Walsh for an agent.

winnipegjets,366m7s,RagingIce,-4,Sat May 16 18:19:22 2015 UTC,"Trade him, retain 50%, and call up Hellebuyck. Still paying less for better goaltending."

winnipegjets,366m7s,watertattoo,2,Sat May 16 20:58:48 2015 UTC,I think we'd see Connor when Hutch has more experience under his belt. Just as Pav was doing for Hutch this past season.
winnipegjets,366m7s,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Sat May 16 21:22:40 2015 UTC,"All Atlanta. We're only now starting to see the Fruits of our dafting, there hasn't been a single prospect play more than 7 games (the  amount of games before it counts under an ELC) after they've moved."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Cannibalheart,5,Sat May 16 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I am completely aware that's all Atlanta. Just pointing out our franchise past and how well it worked for them."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Becau5eRea5on5,4,Sat May 16 19:25:02 2015 UTC,"But you said Winnipeg Fans. That implies the Jets. If you had said ""this franchise liked to rush players"", that would be closer to what you mean. All of this is pointless though because the front office was gutted during relocation and replaced with True North's own guys. It's very disingenuous to say that the Jets liked to rush prospects."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Cannibalheart,6,Sat May 16 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"No, follow me here.   Winnipeg fans like to rush young players. Fans. Look at this subreddit and count how many times Ehlers is going to be in the lineup. Or how many times the Jets should have traded Pav becuse Hutch is the next Price. Winnipeg fans love to rush their ypouth.   The franchise does not, which is why we are seeing success.   Pointing out Atlanta players, was to display what happens when you rush young talent."
winnipegjets,366m7s,ConqueringCanada,1 point,Sat May 16 20:47:39 2015 UTC,"Fans don't make the decision, so fans can't rush anyone."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Sun May 17 02:50:50 2015 UTC,"But at the same time, Ehlers is going into his Draft+2 year, and Hutch spent a few seasons in the Bruins system before we signed him here, then spent another season in our system. We're not throwing these guys straight into the fire like Atlanta did with Bogo, Kane, and Burmi, who all joined the team right after the draft. FWIW though, I'll wait until pre-season to offer my opinion on Ehlers. If he doesn't pan out this year though, I hope we loan him to Europe. He has nothing to prove in the Q anymore, and the players and refs hate him. It would be bad for his development if we sent him back IMO."
winnipegjets,366m7s,RagingIce,-1,Sat May 16 21:19:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, a 22 year old playing in the NHL is totally rushing them"

winnipegjets,366m7s,Vuldr,0,Sat May 16 20:45:11 2015 UTC,"He means they were rushed into the league as rookies,  he didn't mean last season."
winnipegjets,366m7s,RagingIce,-2,Sat May 16 19:37:08 2015 UTC,He's saying that calling him up next year is rushing him. It's absolutely not.
winnipegjets,366m7s,ehr0c,1 point,Sat May 16 19:49:28 2015 UTC,It is for a goalie.
winnipegjets,366m7s,Vuldr,0,Sun May 17 02:07:28 2015 UTC,When you said 22 year old I thought you were talking about Kane or one of the other guys you mentioned were rushed. They were brought right after being drafted I think. (not sure about Bogo)  22 is young for a goalie. Their development is even slower than defencemen.
winnipegjets,366m7s,watertattoo,0,Sat May 16 20:00:51 2015 UTC,"imo i agree with that saying ""winnipeg fans sure love rushing young talent"". idk what you mean't with burmi, kane, and bogo tho. but, anyways yeah I keep reading people say that morrissey, petan, ehlers, and now connor should be on the big club next year.. and I dont know why. theyre unproven in the nhl level. you got two undersized (well talented) fwds who are better off getting some seasoning in the ahl (petan) and europe beause he's too talented for the Q (ehlers), a defensemen that most people are saying should just replace enstrom because enstrom is too small.. last time i remembered enstrom is our most talented LD, and if we switch morrissey with him your asking a kid to play top minutes for us on the left side.. and then we have connor who should replace pav now. yes the guy is a hell of a talent, but how would that look with our rotation for goalies next year having a total of what 38 games under their belt. actually make that under hutchs belt because connor hasn't played one game in the nhl. all I'm saying is we should let our prospects develop the right way instead of assuming our prospects (because of the reputation in the juniors or college/ahl) should get a free pass on to the big club team because we can't wait to see them. I'd like to use Lowry as an example who was well seasoned before making the jump to the big club and look at how well he worked out. and then there's scheif's last I remember it didnt work out so well for him when the Jet's tried transitioning him from juniors to the NHL right away and then he had his fair share of AHL time during the playoffs and a few NHL call ups, quite a few ppl were thinking he was developing too slow. With the team we have now we should just let our prospects develop and be ""overripe"". pavelec has like 2 years remaining at 4.25 this upcoming season and 4.75 the year after and if he's as bad as his haters say he is idk who would be willing to take that on in a trade, cause as someone stated earlier i don't see management willing to eat some of his salary. and for Fro's replacement if we don't get him back, as much as I'd love to see Ehlers play for the Jets cause he's so damn amazing to watch on the ice I wouldn't hate it if he didn't play for us next season cause he is small in stature, and he'd be better off spending time in europe and developing there. What would make more sense is if Armia (6'3""/210 lbs) can make the jump next year to the Jets, he plays RW just as Frolik put him on the 3rd line with Lowry (6'5""/205 lbs) as he can add a scoring touch to the third line. here's his evaluation from elite prospects: A large forward, Armia plays a simple and solid game. He likes to head towards the net and is very strong in one-on-one situations. Armia is extremely dangerous in the slot where he can create space for himself with a simple deke and then use his sharp and accurate shot to finish the play. Armia has good stickhandling and puck skills but could share the puck more often. He has built his physique well and added a new dimension to his game with improved defensive skills. (Matias Strozyk, 2012). And if the Jets can bring back Burmi for next season to play LW on the 3rd line, he can add a bit of play making on that line. Not sure how ready Armia is, and if Burmi will even play for the Jets again, but that could be a pretty decent 3rd line instead of rushing our other prospects with no pro experience into. just my own personal opinion."

winnipegjets,366m7s,RagingIce,1 point,Sat May 16 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"right, but you're paying less money than keeping Pav's contract. Not sure on the numbers, but I think Pav gets 4M. If you retain 2M and pay Hellebuyck, you're freeing up some money."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Vuldr,2,Sat May 16 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"I think we'd rather pay the money than throw in two relatively unproven goaltenders. The Jets will be under a microscope this season. Lots of pressure to make the playoffs again in a -STILL- retarded central division.   We need to remember that Chevy's strategy is draft AND develop. Yes, hutch did well last year but he faltered under a heavy workload. Yes, Helle is looking sexy as fuck but if he threw him in and he lost his confidence what would happen to his long term potential? We even got another highly touted goalie prospect in Comrie.   Chevy would be smart to ride out Pavs' contract and play Hutchinson and Hellebuyuk while Comrie comes up. When Comrie is ready we can flip one of them for way more than we can get for Pavelec even at his currently higher than usual status."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Imthecoolestdudeever,2,Sat May 16 19:58:00 2015 UTC,Preach brother. This man understands the development process.
winnipegjets,366m7s,Canadaisfullgohome,1 point,Sat May 16 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"We have deep pockets and a GM that has shown he means to win and can deal to get there. Playoffs is a huge thing and it generates a lot of money for True North, they will spend to get there you can count on it. We have been waiting because it takes time to rebuild and reformat, the time is now the window has been cracked open and soon it will be fully open, with a time when players like Ladd and little and wheeler will be peaking in their careers with our youth movement starting to flourish.   If we had a consistent goalie we would be the best team in the league in two years, at least one of the most talented. The Dcore is insane, the forward get better and better, that can't be argued."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Vuldr,1 point,Thu May 21 19:35:00 2015 UTC,"I don't see them abandoning their draft and develop mentality just Because we've made the playoffs one year. Yes we CAN spend money but that doesn't mean we WILL. You make us sound like Toronto used to be. Throwing money at F/As to make the playoffs and it just won't happen.  Chevy is smart and will wait for the right time to make moves. The Kane deal was perfect timing for a tanking buffalo. He's not gonna throw money at free agents like Statsny last year when he can pick up Perrault for 3x3.  Playoffs generate lots of money, sure. Chevy won't be desperate for the playoffs though because he's more focused on building this team. We made it once and that doesn't make us cup contenders."
winnipegjets,366m7s,Canadaisfullgohome,1 point,Thu May 21 20:12:50 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with what a playoff window is? I'll refer you to how to screw one up in Vancouver if you would like.   We develop in order to get here, you don't develop just for the sake of development, it's in order to get somewhere you want to be, and we're here after years and years of growing. Making it once shows how far we have come, I never once said we were cup contenders , I just said we would be very talented, which we are and will be even if the league won't notice. We came out of the hardest division in hockey and looked good doing it, but unfortunately we played the best team in the west and they didn't get that way by accident as we saw."
winnipegjets,366m7s,rookie-mistake,3,Thu May 21 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"Tough question. There's two inarguable facts about Pavs:    He's been terrible for us in the past  He was fucking great this season.   I simultaneously think that a) he's earned another year and b) that I kinda don't want to blow another playoff year with him. If we aren't going to succeed next year, let's get our goalies of the future some playoff experience.  I honestly don't know how to reconcile the two views though :/"
winnipegjets,366m7s,Vuldr,2,Sun May 17 04:41:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think Pavs will be traded. Not this year, at least. Maybe someone will take him next season to see how he does in a year but taking him for 2 years after one solid half season in Winnipeg would be too risky.   We'll probably end up waiting out Pavs while Hellebuyuk and Hutchinson develop more. In two years we'll have a H&H tandem with a solid team in front of them. I have faith in Chevy and Maurice."

winnipegjets,366m7s,ComplexChristian,1 point,Sat May 16 18:16:55 2015 UTC,Trade him while he currently has good value then retain a part of his salary. Once he gets a bad season again you can't trade him away. Maybe EDM would take him.
winnipegjets,366m7s,ATinyBoatInMyTeacup,-2,Sat May 16 19:36:15 2015 UTC,"They totally would, but Chevy would ask for Eberle or Yak which would be a HUGE overpayment. Maybe flip Pavs for a couple 2nds and a prospect"

winnipegjets,366m7s,ATinyBoatInMyTeacup,1 point,Sat May 16 20:19:25 2015 UTC,Just a guess basing on what Edmonton media has said GM's are asking for!
winnipegjets,360q74,therealgeegay,6,Fri May 15 02:54:07 2015 UTC,I think we should be looking at teams that will need to shed salary. We could pick up some valuable pieces for cheap just like NYI did with Boychuk and Leddy.
winnipegjets,360q74,deus216,3,Fri May 15 05:32:22 2015 UTC,"Reimer wasn't really happy in Toronto after the whole ""Just okay"" fiasco last season. We tried to trade him in the 2013-14 off-season but couldn't find any takers. That said, he wants to be a starter, so I don't know that a trade with the Jets would fly if it means having to play backup again. Bernier isn't off the table but is a pending RFA so we'll have to see what happens there.  JVR is an interesting idea, but it may be difficult. Certainly if you threw in Uncle Leo. I don't see that two man happening unless a couple prospects or young guns get thrown in as well, and Chevy doesn't seem like the type to trade away the future. The thing with JVR is that there would have to be a pretty good return for Shanny to bite. He's a talented player and is young enough to be part of our rebuild. It would be like trading away Kadri. Sure it's possible but the return would have to be sizable and I don't think it would happen in a 1-for-1"
winnipegjets,360q74,le_canuck,1 point,Fri May 15 11:18:49 2015 UTC,4 years left I'm not so sure he fits the window. You're going to be two years at least for draft picks to hit the big club and another year or two for them to mature enough to make an impact.  Maybe the last year of JVR's contract is feasible for a playoff spot but not as a serious contender.
winnipegjets,360q74,brock0791,5,Mon May 25 04:55:18 2015 UTC,"JVR would be awesome on the Jets! I feel like him and Schief would have good chemistry and he plays that Jets style of play. I think for maybe our later 1st rounder and the rights to Burmi would be a good trade for both teams, maybe even possibly bumping the pick to the 17th and getting Leo Komarov.  I don't think the Jets would be interested in a goalie, considering that Pav had a good last season and we still have Hutch and Helly in the wings, but you never know."
winnipegjets,360q74,Kezreal,2,Fri May 15 04:11:25 2015 UTC,"Can we start an ""ACQUIRE JVR"" petition somewhere? I feel like he would be a second wheeler on the team. I love wheeler."

winnipegjets,360q74,ComplexChristian,-1,Fri May 22 05:38:38 2015 UTC,Lol what a terrible trade for us. JVR is a former #2 pick and a 25-30 goal scorer on an amazing contract and he's young. Leafs aren't giving him up unless it's a massive overpayment.
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Tue May 26 00:57:09 2015 UTC,"I've really seen alot of people talk about landing JVR for a 1st, mostly from HFBoards. It would be damn interesting if we land him. Would be nice to see him play for us."
winnipegjets,360q74,ComplexChristian,3,Fri May 15 03:22:19 2015 UTC,It's an enticing trade for sure.
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Fri May 15 05:29:27 2015 UTC,If you were Chevy would you do that trade or would you rather use it to draft a prospect?
winnipegjets,360q74,ComplexChristian,3,Fri May 15 05:33:13 2015 UTC,"I'd use it as a starting point at least, but I suspect it would take more to get him. But if I am Chevy, I also have no problem holding on to that pick and using to draft someone, especially if I can get Kylington with 25th. So what I'm saying is, it could go either way."
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Fri May 15 05:36:57 2015 UTC,"Just curious, where do you think would Burmi play if he ever comes back here, we resign either Frolik/Staff, and if Ehlers also makes the team next year? Cuz IIRC Burmi doesn't want to play on the third line, and you're not gonna wanna ruin the chemistry between S-L-W if we resign Staff."
winnipegjets,360q74,ComplexChristian,3,Fri May 15 05:46:11 2015 UTC,"I would put him on the third line and tell him tough. I don't think he's permanent top 6 on this roster right now, but I think him, Lowry, and Stempniak/Ehlers would make a great shutdown line. I also really hope we choose Frolik over Stafford. Stafford's gonna get paid, but he's not gonna produce like he did at the end of the season. I think Frolik's the safer bet since he consistently makes everyone around him better.  Also, the chemistry between Wheeler, Scheifele, and Stafford isn't that great. I'm trying to find a line graph that shows this, but I'm having a hard time. But basically, Corsi after Stafford arrives = not great."
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Fri May 15 06:04:42 2015 UTC,"Actually looking at it, that kinda makes sense now. You have some really good and interesting points. We could resign Fro and put him on the 1st, (maybe) trade a pick for JVR and put him on the second line, and like you've said Ehlers/Lowry/Burmi on the third, then Stempniak on the fourth line. Look at those lines. Wow."
winnipegjets,360q74,Sumtinwong,3,Fri May 15 06:09:18 2015 UTC,"And if JVR-Scheif-Wheeler weren't able to click (JVR and Wheeler strike me as similar players, like Kane-Wheeler), you just swap Frolik and Wheeler, and You have two lines that should put up positive possession easy peasy! Now if it weren't for that hole in the top 4..."
winnipegjets,360q74,bansheeguitars,1 point,Fri May 15 06:14:03 2015 UTC,"Full disclosure: Sabres fan pre jets 2.0  I think Chevy will do his best to sign frolik over stafford.  But if the rumours are true that frolik wants to cash in, I don't think they would want to pay him in the 5-6M range.  If by chance stafford is willing to sign for ~2M less than what frolik will, I think they will sign stafford over frolik.  I do think frolik is the better option.  I like him as a player, finds success no matter who he plays with.  I am also high on stafford though.  He was there in the buffalo glory days when they were actually a respectable team.  He had some good seasons those years and showed flashes of it when he joined up with the jets, similar to how tyler myers started producing again once he was surrounded by better quality players, coaches, or whatever.  He is a bit of a gamble though as he is 29, going on 30 and could potentially be on the decline in the coming years.   Not to mention we do not know if his good form at the end of the season will translate into a good year this year.  Edit: bonus, he was born in Wisconsin and presumably gets along well with the Minnesota born guys"
winnipegjets,360q74,h0twired,1 point,Fri May 22 05:52:07 2015 UTC,I really hope we sign Frolik over Stafford as well. He played well down the stretch but Frolik is younger and better! Plus he's good buddies with Pav! And hes been here longer. We need to reward him for his service!!
winnipegjets,360q74,DGSTEE,1 point,Fri May 15 12:38:16 2015 UTC,If I had to pick.  I would keep Stafford.
winnipegjets,360q74,ComplexChristian,4,Fri May 15 18:49:56 2015 UTC,"Lets move Enstrom. I'd even be ok with paying out half of his huge contract. EDM needs defense, maybe we could get one of their many talented centre prospects (dreistal) or even Eberle/RNH/Hall ???"
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Fri May 15 04:49:56 2015 UTC,I'd never see them trading away Draisitl for Enstrom straight up.
winnipegjets,360q74,ComplexChristian,2,Fri May 15 05:35:24 2015 UTC,That's a trade that bad for us and worse for them.
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Fri May 15 05:41:10 2015 UTC,Exactly.
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,7,Fri May 15 05:43:36 2015 UTC,"I think we would sooner see them move buff than Enstrom. The jets are weak on the left side (aside from enstrom), but they luckily have a bunch of RHD (buff, Myers, and Trouba) so loosing buff wouldn't be too bad. I can see them trading Eberle for buff if the jets throw a 3rd rounder in."
winnipegjets,360q74,brock0791,7,Fri May 15 05:17:24 2015 UTC,I think you're undervaluing Buff quite a bit there.
winnipegjets,360q74,BrawnyJohnny,9,Fri May 15 05:18:02 2015 UTC,"I do like buff but I don't think he is worth as much as Eberle for a few reasons. Buff I think is the better player at his best but he is really inconsistent, and some games he looks brilliant, well others not so much (not to say Eberle isn't inconsistent).   Eberle is also only 24 years old, compared to buff who is 30. Additionally, Buff is only signed till the end of the upcoming season(and may walk away for nothing), well Eberle is signed for 4 more years at 6 million. Buff I think will want somewhere close to 7 million a year (maybe even more) and will want to be signed long term as well. Yes I like buff, but for the jets I think Eberle would be the better option (I am also liking watching Eberle at the IIHF)."
winnipegjets,360q74,brock0791,0,Fri May 15 05:34:07 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with that, but I think throwing in a third rounder is a bit much. If anything I'd start with Edmonton giving us their third rounder and working it out from there.  But if I'm being really honest, I'd rather get a LW. That's where we need more depth."
winnipegjets,360q74,jaredbfehr,1 point,Fri May 15 05:39:32 2015 UTC,I'm not sure Edmonton would give up a long term asset for a rental this year
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Mon May 25 05:08:16 2015 UTC,"Enstrom has a tough contract because he has a no-movement clause, not sure if it expires after so many years or what, but as of the end of the season he had the clause."
winnipegjets,360q74,jaredbfehr,1 point,Sat May 16 15:47:48 2015 UTC,I've been pushing for a Morrissey for Draisaitl trade for a while and everyone shuts it down.  Yes Morrissey is a stud but so is Leon and you have to give up something to get something and no way Enstrom is even worth his contract never mind brings back a top 6 forward when he has 3 years aav 5.75m left
winnipegjets,360q74,ehr0c,0,Mon May 25 04:57:41 2015 UTC,"Yes. We have plenty of defense to fill the void, and we need a highly skilled guy like Eberle (I just really like him, can we get him please please please)"
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Fri May 15 04:59:54 2015 UTC,"Problem is, all our depth is on the right side. If we move Enstrom, we need to get a top 4 back or else our top guy is Stuart, and then behind that, well..."
winnipegjets,360q74,Mister_Kurtz,-6,Fri May 15 05:10:46 2015 UTC,"But if we bring in a guy like Eberle, and assuming Ehlers makes the jump next year, we could trade someone like Stempniak or Tlusty for a top 4 D man."
winnipegjets,360q74,peskysens,7,Fri May 15 05:23:47 2015 UTC,I want to live in this fantasy world you're in where either stempniak or tlusty are worth a top 4 defenseman.
winnipegjets,360q74,brock0791,2,Fri May 15 13:12:05 2015 UTC,"Stempniak and Tlusty are both UFA's right now. They have no trade value unless we re-sign them. Even then, assuming we re-sign them and for some strange reason decide to trade them, Stempniak and Tlusty aren't worth a top 4 dman by themselves, it would have to be a package deal."

winnipegjets,360q74,Galbi11,1 point,Fri May 22 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"Two teams I'd target this off season.  1st is Tampa through trade.  They have a ton of upcoming RFA's Stamkos included and need to shed salary.  We have way too many playmakers (Scheif, Ehlers, Petan) and not enough scoring wingers.  With Stamkos, Kucherov, Johnson untouchable I'd look at Callahan as we can afford to take on his contract.  Second move I'd look at is RFA's in the division with teams against the cap.  Brandon Saad for example."
winnipegjets,360q74,Sumtinwong,0,Mon May 25 05:04:55 2015 UTC,"goalies - i think we can ride out what we've got so far, we've got amazing prospects coming, don't need to give too much away for a position we're already sitting well with.  Defense - i think enstrom has to go, at least from a playoff standpoint, he's smaller than everyone else and he can't reach that level of physicality that his teammates do. just my opinion. But yes, i would love to see an Eberle - Enstrom trade  JVR would be sweet, we could use a top scorer on the team. With Burmistrov set to return to the NHL i'd like to say see you later, thanks for nothing, and get a nice return for him"
winnipegjets,360q74,Galbi11,12,Fri May 15 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"I wrote a bit here on why it would be bad to trade Enstrom here, but here's what the argument boils down to:   We are absolutely bare on the left side without Enstrom He has eaten 1st pair minutes for breakfast despite being tied to possession anchors like Bogo and Myers this season Enstrom makes up for his size by constantly being the smartest player on the ice. Because of his smarts he can hang back and let players like Buff and Myers do their thang He would make a great mentor for Myers who is not and will not be the next Chara Size bias is a bullshit argument"
winnipegjets,360q74,brock0791,6,Fri May 15 05:47:36 2015 UTC,"I am so sick of hearing that Enstrom is a small dude. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. He has been our most reliable Dman since he got off the plane.  Who cares that he will get overpowered when his body positioning and smart play allows him to keep us in control of the puck. He has great awareness which allows him to use his partners very well.   Just so sick of hearing people say he's a crap defender because he's not 6'5 220. He's been great, and the drop off from him to Stu and Chiarot is so steep, it's insane to consider trading him for a forward."
winnipegjets,360q74,Sumtinwong,0,Fri May 15 18:08:20 2015 UTC,"comparing Toby Enstrom, the 30 year old 544 NHL game veteran to Ben Chiarot, the 24 year old 41 NHL game rookie is kind of a silly thing to do though isn't it?"
winnipegjets,360q74,Sumtinwong,1 point,Sun May 17 19:47:58 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. Ben Chiarot would have to replace him if we traded him, so it's relevant to compare each of them. If Toby Enstorm was a overpriced asset, there's no way we'd be able to both acquire a forward and a equal replacement for him on the blueline, leaving Ben Chiarot as most likely our Top pairing LHD paired with Buff."
winnipegjets,360q74,BrawnyJohnny,1 point,Wed May 20 13:53:05 2015 UTC,That's why Buff should go this off season.  We aren't serious conference finals contenders this year... we are in 2017.  Don't lose Buff for nothing next off season
winnipegjets,360q74,Sumtinwong,0,Mon May 25 04:59:54 2015 UTC,I think you are confused.  I never said I wanted a forward for Enstrom.  Ideally I would trade him for a LHD.  Obviously not a 1 for 1 trade though
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,0,Wed May 20 13:57:37 2015 UTC,Just curious what people think might be attractive trade bait this summer.   Do you understand the meaning of this sentence?
winnipegjets,360q74,Sumtinwong,1 point,Wed May 20 14:12:24 2015 UTC,"Enstrom has a no-movement clause, that is why you haven't seen any action on him."
winnipegjets,360q74,Sumtinwong,1 point,Fri May 22 02:33:28 2015 UTC,"Note: i did not read the original, just going to cue on the bullet points made here.  The counter arguements to trade enstrom is the fact his contract sucks, no matter how you look at it.  Edit: i will also note that if I were to trade him it would be in a package deal to get a better LHD and not a forward*  Contract Issues:  He is 30, with 3 years left on the contract as the HIGHEST PAID winnipeg jet at 5.75M / year not to mention the 1.15M signing bonus per remaining year.  Nothing about this contract looks good to me.  Furthermore lets compare this to some other d-men around that price tag.  Brent Seabrook 5.8M (cap hit) same age as toby, 1 year left on his contract.  Brent Bruns 5.76M (cap hit) same age as toby 2 years left on his contract.  Marc Staal 2 years younger than toby, 5.7M (cap hit) 6 years left on his contract.  I'm not going to argue X player over Y player.  But I will say that there are many other defence-men I would choose ahead of Toby Enstrom  The thing that i always say about Enstrom is that i would love to have him if he wasn't getting paid more than anyone on the team.  EX if he was on a 3M/year contract, nobody... or at least I wouldn't have anything negative to say about the guy.  TL:DR Toby is the highest paid JET but (imo) does not play like it."
winnipegjets,360q74,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Sat May 16 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"The only one I'd probably take over Enstrom is Burns. Toby and Seasbrook put up similar figures this year, although I believe Seabrook was on Chicago's 2nd pairing this year. Staal just isn't the same player he was before his eye injury. If Enstrom was getting paid even a mil less than what he is right now I don't think he would pick up nearly as much flak. As it stands right now though, he's getting paid about as much as people who put up the same numbers as him do. I don't think it's fair to expect more out of him because he's the highest paid jet right now, because we have some damn good contracts on this team."
winnipegjets,360q74,Sumtinwong,1 point,Sun May 17 19:41:01 2015 UTC,"Also some stat comparisons  Toby Enstrom Last 3 seasons: 164 games played, 68 points, +/- (-4)  Brent Bruns Last 3 Seasons:  181 games played, 128 points, +/- (+17)  Marc Staal Last 3 Seasons:  173 games played, 45 points, +/- (+21)  Brent Seabrook: Last 3 Seasons:  211 games played, 92 points, +/- (+32)"
winnipegjets,360q74,brock0791,0,Sun May 17 19:53:47 2015 UTC,"i just don't think Enstrom has the level defensive presence/impact as the men listed.  To use your words, he does get paid about as much as people who put up similar numbers.  However the numbers don't necessarily tell you how the player is defensively.  Beyond that you make a good polnt that we have some damn good contracts with Ladd, Little, Wheeler, etc.  Noting that Enstrom's contract is not one of the good ones...  Also to note; Buff and trouba are up for renewal next season.  Does Enstrom's contract drive up what the other guys ask for?  Pure speculation.  But there's many a reason to get rid of him just as there are many reasons to keep him.  Jacob Trouba had 22 Points this year over 65 games.  While Toby Enstrom had 23 points over 60 games.  If Trouba matches or surpasses Enstrom in points next season does that push him to a huge contract?"
winnipegjets,360q74,Sumtinwong,1 point,Fri May 22 03:01:18 2015 UTC,"Enstrom was signed when he was consistently putting up 30-40 points a season. That's the argument I'd use if I were GM. And I think that he does have the same defensive impact, it's just not in the hit/shot blocking competition. Also, +/- is a bed stat. It uses goals which have a small sample size, and the circumstances it uses are weird (not counting PP goals against but counting SH goals against, allowing empty net goals). That's where shot metrics really shine is as a replacement for +/-.   Here's war-on-ice's standard graph.  It's all data from the 2011-12 season until this one. As you can see, Enstrom has similar TOI's to Seabrook and Staal (Burns spent a lot of time at forward so this skews his numbers a bit) and had the largest fraction of offensive zone starts between the three of them. However, he also has the toughest TOI and has the best CorsiRel of the three of them (measuring how much better a team is shot wise with a player on the ice compared to without).   So he doesn't produce the points anymore and could be had for cheaper on his next contract, I think we both agree on that. But it would still be a mistake to trade him, because he's still a competent first pair defenseman. And really, what will we replace him with?"
winnipegjets,360q74,Imthecoolestdudeever,1 point,Fri May 22 02:51:39 2015 UTC,"The only thing I (emphasis on I) would want to trade him for is in a package deal for a Number 1 or 2 LHD with a better contract.  I suppose where we differ most in opinion is simply that I would prefer to take care of the cap situation first, potentialy leaving a hole on LD...  Maybe hope that Josh Morrissey is the real deal (although as stated before I would prefer to trade Enstrom for a LHD, perhaps a ~2-4M /year type player).  Where you would rather retain him for the value he still brings to the team.,, As well as seeing him as a key player on the team."

winnipegjets,35lovq,Cannibalheart,2,Mon May 11 22:48:04 2015 UTC,He was the first star of that game. That should say something.   Let's just enjoy how good he's doing without comparing him to pavelec. What's the point? Be happy we have goalies.
winnipegjets,35lovq,Cannibalheart,2,Tue May 12 04:23:27 2015 UTC,"The point of comparing him to Pav, is that he's a known commodity.  Alot of people might see these stats and think we've got the next Carey Price. Granted its a very small sample size, but we know what we've got in Pavelec, and Hellebuyck just continues to win at every level,  so it's exciting to follow!"
winnipegjets,35lovq,Sumtinwong,0,Tue May 12 17:05:16 2015 UTC,"Did you watch today's game?  Also, it doesn't have to be an either or scenario. Winnipeg fans seem obsessed with - this guy is better, trade the other! Where would we be if the Jets listened and traded Pav early on, and ran with Hutch?  Well, we might have Mc David, I guess."
winnipegjets,35lovq,monkey_bojangles,2,Tue May 12 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"The only way I would see them trading Pavelec is if they were to sign a cheaper, proven, goalie through Free Agency.  People want Pavelec to be traded because his perceived value is at an all time high right now. I am skeptical that he is magically an elite goalie now. The guy rode a convenient hot streak, and we reaped the benefits of it. I do not think Pavelec is going to be our goalie of the future. He will ride out his contract here for 2 more seasons and then we will have our goaltending prospects ideally be ready by then.  What we need is a consistently average to above average goalie. Hopefully Hellebuyck can be that guy. Or Hutch, Comrie, or Phillips."
winnipegjets,35lovq,Becau5eRea5on5,2,Tue May 12 20:05:48 2015 UTC,"On point right here.  I would like to see Pavelec get moved in terms of the large cap space he takes up in comparison to what he offers ( also Toby Enstrom but that's another story).  However i think you are right for the most part.  I think there is a very very slim chance of him being moved for the upcoming season.  He is not the goalie of the future, but we do not have a proven + consistant replacement.  We have Hutch who has shown to be hot and cold, with unproven rookies beyond that.  In short, it wouldn't make sense to move pavelec now.  But depending how the rookies do next year, I see him being forced out for the last year on his contract.  Actually I predict that Toby Enstrom and/or pavelec will be moved before the start of the 2016/2017 season.  why?  Because Ladd, Byfuglien, Trouba, Scheiffele and Lowry all need to be re-signed that year."
winnipegjets,35lovq,ehr0c,3,Wed May 13 04:41:31 2015 UTC,I think this supports my theory that Hutch will be traded.
winnipegjets,35lovq,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Mon May 11 21:57:19 2015 UTC,Can we trade Pavs instead? He came off a career year and there's only two more seasons left on his contract!

If you're off the shore you will still want to reel and cast with a jig though. Pull the rod, and then reel the line. Imagine how a fish swims in little spurts. Fish like to bite when the hook is dropping between pulls.  If you don't want to cast at all, pickerel rigs are good for just sitting there. That's what we were using yesterday.   If you're off a boat then you can just drop a jig straight down and leave it like a foot off the bottom and jig it every now and then."

Off the top of my head though, I'd say Slater and one of Stafford/Frolik are gone (please don't let it be Frolik). I can see Tlusty staying even though he wasn't that good with us, but he's probably out too. I think Stempniak will be back. Ehlers and Burmistrov are both wildcards IMO, for Ehlers it depends on his camp. I think he'll get a few games in the regular season too, but after that not sure.

winnipegjets,35lhh6,RedDorf,13,Mon May 11 15:46:24 2015 UTC,"Really obvious, but... holy crap is Connor Hellebuyck good for the USA team. Really expecting a Canada/US final now.  Some really great 'hard' decisions for the Jets coming in the next few years."
winnipegjets,35lhh6,Harborcoat84,3,Mon May 11 15:04:32 2015 UTC,"Hutch, Hellebuyck, Comrie and Phillips. We better get a nice return for one of them."
winnipegjets,35lhh6,1337nerd,4,Mon May 11 15:04:09 2015 UTC,This must be how Ottawa feels all the time.
winnipegjets,35lhh6,mysticsavage,8,Mon May 11 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"It's nice to be able to have hard decisions rather than ""fuck, when the hell can we get rid of Antropov and Wellwood for a box of used Sears catalogues!"""
winnipegjets,35lhh6,nukacola12,2,Mon May 11 19:07:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, I thought they were decent players. Our scoring depth took a huge hit without them."
winnipegjets,35lhh6,sneezypenguin,3,Mon May 11 15:14:33 2015 UTC,Do people actually use the Sears catalog anymore?
winnipegjets,35lhh6,IronRook,8,Fri May 15 16:36:27 2015 UTC,More than we used Wellwood.
winnipegjets,35lhh6,mysticsavage,2,Mon May 11 15:59:18 2015 UTC,More like more useful than Wellwood.
winnipegjets,35lhh6,IronRook,5,Mon May 11 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"Remember our local superstar, Derek Meech? I hope not."

winnipegjets,35jwnk,xChicoDusty,1 point,Mon May 11 02:47:47 2015 UTC,They are usually only carried by hockey stores. My local shop has some of the more popular local teams but no Jets. It's just weird none of the big online places have any.

winnipegjets,35izay,insane66666,2,Sun May 10 21:48:01 2015 UTC,so that's why he always missed the net...

winnipegjets,35bw2l,mysticsavage,3,Sat May 9 02:31:41 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

winnipegjets,34xu1p,watertattoo,11,Tue May 5 13:35:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think we can afford him after next season. Both Schiefele and Trouba's entry level contracts are up meaning will need to pay each of them around 4 mil or more depending on how they play next year. So this means we either pay Buff,  and sacrifice somewhere else or, let Buff go and use the saved salary to patch up a position we probably need more than a 3rd top pairing quality RHD. Trade him if a deal comes along. But keeping him and seeing if something happens that allows us to keep him (ie a few prospects step up, saving us money) and letting him walk if it doesn't, isn't a bad option either."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,I_am_a_zebra,9,Tue May 5 14:14:07 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see him stick around. We're a better team with him. Yeah he has his moments good and bad, but he's a big part of the team's persona and we are more of a beast of a team to square up against when he's out there. That can't be denied. If Chevy gets a super offer for him, well sure. Do it up. But someone will have to overpay to trade for him, or he's best kept around."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,double-k,4,Tue May 5 14:24:54 2015 UTC,"I completely agree and I have heard people saying "" we won 3/4 without him"" and yeah, sure we did do that, but are you forgetting the rest of the season? Hell the OT goal in Minnesota was all him!!! (And a little but of Minnesota making a goof). But at the end of the day he is too big a part to be moving away. Just look at who left between Kane and Buff"
winnipegjets,34xu1p,HakunaMatata94,2,Tue May 5 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but let's not forget that within the next couple of seasons we are serious playoff contenders. Buff was a big part in his win with the hawks. Also, he's a big part of our defense, and power play. Yeah he's made some bone head moves and hits, but in all reality we do need him. He's one of my favourite players (he knocked himself down a peg or two with his bad moves) and has been since his days with the hawks. I vote on keeping Big Buff"
winnipegjets,34xu1p,epurcell5023,8,Wed May 6 02:01:14 2015 UTC,"Shitty Buff is better than most other players, especially since he can play forward in a pinch, which is great, because our style of play tends to lend itself to frequent injuries."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,1337nerd,7,Tue May 5 15:27:55 2015 UTC,"I say trade because: 1- he's ufa next year,  had a good season and his value wont be higher. The contract he would be able to ask for would be too long/too much and be an anchor in the later years  2- its been mentioned already but we have two great young d men to take the minutes on RD with Trouba and Myers 3- Buff has always been pretty inconsistent so there's no guarantee we get good Buff   I agree with the trade Entrom argument as well since Morrisey plays the same kind of style but Entrom has a no trade which would make him harder to move. I don't think moving both at the same time would be a good idea, so that makes trading Buff for a big return in the off season the best option IMO"
winnipegjets,34xu1p,Bittrexx,6,Tue May 5 14:21:13 2015 UTC,The second you trade Buff is the second you have to start playing against him.  Think about that...

As skilled as he can be, he was getting tossed around like nothing in the Anaheim series and a bigger body would have been helpful."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,Becau5eRea5on5,4,Tue May 5 15:38:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think either of them should be moved yet. If we move Enstrom, it shouldn't be because he's small. He's a smart player who almost always manages to find himself in the right place at the right time. If anything I think we need him around for a couple more seasons so that he can help fine tune Myers, because as great as Myers is, he's still a little rough around the edges."

winnipegjets,34xu1p,lordderplythethird,2,Wed May 6 06:01:48 2015 UTC,"wait until Chia takes over. Chia loves big physical guys, and liked to stack defense, which is 100% Buff. Old Edmonton leadership might not of been for it, but Chia just might be"
winnipegjets,34xu1p,haterbehatin,2,Thu May 7 23:07:12 2015 UTC,Not necessarily he already said in his introduction press conference that he's not actually all about big players just guys who are hard on the puck and win battles.  I just thought their post was ridiculous. They basically asked for Taylor Hall for Buff who's a year away from free agency.
winnipegjets,34xu1p,lordderplythethird,2,Thu May 7 23:11:58 2015 UTC,"What he said, contradicts virtually all his moves and decisions in Boston, but maybe he's changing his playbook; who knows. Yeah I agree that expecting 2 top 6s or a top 3 and a pick for Buff is crazy."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,Hero_of_Brandon,2,Thu May 7 23:14:09 2015 UTC,(He's an UFA next offseason) so do we pay him or trade him?
winnipegjets,34xu1p,klevenisms204,3,Tue May 5 13:37:22 2015 UTC,If we don't extend him by the deadline he's getting traded. No way we let an asset like that walk into UFA
winnipegjets,34xu1p,stazy,2,Tue May 5 19:23:15 2015 UTC,"tough call, in the last games of the season, it appeared we play better without him in the line up  however, id rather keep buff over toby"
winnipegjets,34xu1p,sneezypenguin,2,Tue May 5 13:50:10 2015 UTC,"to his credit, he did have a shifted rib or something like that.  It was noticible in the game where he took a 2 minute shift.  He was hit in the corner, then was hunched over in pain for a bit..... then somehow decided it was a good idea to stay on for another minute (I don't give him credit for that part)."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,TOBlueJays,2,Tue May 5 15:18:51 2015 UTC,"If Chevy can find value for him on the scale of the value he got for Kane, he may have to go. My rough calculations have him eating up ~10% of the cap after his new contract and that isn't going to mesh with also re-signing The Captain. I understand what Byfuglien brings to the table and his game-changing qualities but I don't think they're worth 10% of the cap."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,ehr0c,2,Tue May 5 16:39:33 2015 UTC,"I would honestly be content either way. I think he's dynamic to our chemistry, on top of being one of our best players. On the other hand he does have consistency issues, and will probably be worth too much for us to take on a couple years from now. If we could get him playing as a forward more often then I say we sign him, since we need more support there then we do on defence. But if we keep him strictly as a defenceman, I think he could be replaced."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,stazy,2,Tue May 5 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"IMO the best thing that could happen would be to extend him for 4 or so years at or below $7M/year, or even 5 or 6 years at 6-6.5M wouldn't be the worst thing. If he's looking for a long-term deal in the >$7M range then I think we try and move him over the summer or at the deadline next year."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,Becau5eRea5on5,3,Tue May 5 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"Keep him.   I'd much rather have him for us, than against us.   He fits in well with the team and is probably a huge presence in the dressing room.    He's a great player.   I would like to see him back on forward than on D though.  It was all that energy on forward that made him really shine as a player.  On D, he's great, but not the same cailber."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,folkdeath95,2,Tue May 5 15:20:50 2015 UTC,"Buff is actually a much worse player on forward than on defense. On forward his average SA% is around 49% while on defense his average SA% is somewhere around 52-53%. That is the difference between a legit top 2 defenseman and a bottom six guy. Also, when he's on defense he can play with anyone and make them better, on forward he tends to bring his team down. I always like to link to this article to show the difference between Byfuglien the defender and Byfuglien the forward."

winnipegjets,34xu1p,ehr0c,1 point,Tue May 5 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"All depends on what he wants contract-wise.  I think Byfuglien has been well worth the $5 - $6 million per year.  But he's 29.  It's likely that he'll start declining.  If they could get him for another 3 years at $5.5 million, I'd say go for it.  If he's demanding $7.5 million per year for the next 6 years, then that's just not a smart deal.  He'll be really overpaid at the tail end and that's not something a smart team can afford."
winnipegjets,34xu1p,Reed_Solomon,1 point,Tue May 5 20:36:40 2015 UTC,"You won't sign Buff for 5.5 a year. He knows he can probably ask for 7.5 on the UFA market and get it, with term."

winnipegjets,34xu1p,pegcity,1 point,Wed May 6 00:03:36 2015 UTC,"imo Byfuglien could command 7+ million (considering recent big name defensemen signings over the years), given he is one of the most dominating players when he wants to be. and then there's term.. which I'm assuming he'll want some security financially, cause there's little chance he signs a short deal because when he does slow down he's not really in a position to command more money at that point. Also the return for Buff would be much greater than a return from enstrom, also consider that we have other RD so we could spare buff, but if we let go of enstrom.. we have next to nothing on the left side. I don't see morrisey jumping up to the NHL next year (Chevy was quoted saying he wants his guys overripe) plus we can't expect him to just jump into our system and get it without ever having played a game in the NHL. Being a FWD maybe there's an exception (or if your names aaron ekblad) but the kid plays defense and it will be a tough go for him if we just rush him into the NHL game. I just can't see our small market team giving Buff the kind of money he'll want and deserves, and that sucks ass but given the situation ^ I could see them moving him to help bolster our team in other areas. also I read somewhere that apparently Fro wants $5 mill a season..which is why he wasn't signed before the deadline. But don't quote me on that one. So comparing Buff to Fro if Fro believes he deserves $5 mill how much more does Buff get...."
winnipegjets,34vo7r,WpgMikos,28,Mon May 4 23:05:28 2015 UTC,Some of you guys were calling for his C literally two weeks ago
winnipegjets,34vo7r,jeryarr,5,Mon May 4 23:08:37 2015 UTC,"Just curious. Who were these people proposing we replace him with? 2 Cups. Tons of experience in the playoffs. Class act. Good dude. Well liked and respected in the community. And now just nominated for the Mark Messier Leadership Award... Who else could there be?   Edit: I recognize you said ""2 weeks ago"" but I added the award he was just nominated for as a clear sign that the team, the league and who ever makes these decisions on the awards, obviously sees him as one of the TOP 3 leaders in the ENTIRE league. Silly fair weather fans is my guess..."
winnipegjets,34vo7r,Hip_Hop_Orangutan,-1,Mon May 4 23:47:17 2015 UTC,"I wasn't calling for his C, but I was upset that the team would practice and the captain wasn't even there, let alone wasn't practicing. With the context of the injuries added, I can understand and respect the not practicing, but not even showing up still doesn't sit well with me, as he still could of displayed leadership from the bench/etc... but that's just my 2 cents. There was never a time I thought his C should be gone, because he's been a good captain and there's no one I can see filling that role right now."
winnipegjets,34vo7r,lordderplythethird,3,Tue May 5 03:00:46 2015 UTC,To be fair. Maurice turned down any and ALL proposals that Ladd wasn't there for his team at ALL possible opportunities. He shut down any possibility that Ladd isn't a great captain extremely quickly in his post season interview.
winnipegjets,34vo7r,fxcker,11,Tue May 5 15:22:21 2015 UTC,"That was me, and it was lacking context of the injuries he was playing with. I can understand getting pissed playing with an injury, and having it made worse by bad plays and dirty hits.  So, I beg the subs forgiveness for my transgression. However, at the time, I couldn't believe the captain of all players did it.  I could understand Buff, Schieffle, or Myers doing it. But I felt that the team captain should be held to a higher level of accountability, and something that may be acceptable for other players may not always be acceptable for a leader to do."

I feel the logo lends itself to keeping with the IceCaps by leaving the red out.  Surprised they aren't selling anything in the upperdeck since it's almost guaranteed $$$....They could probably sellout for at least the first year.  Edit:  After seeing the jersey 'demo', I'm not sure. The logo almost looks too big and like it's missing something."

Martin St. Louis, and he's managed a pretty good career. Now I'm not saying that Enstrom is literally St. Louis but smarts can get you a lot of places in this league. Size, on the other hand, is one of the worst arguments I've seen for roster moves. Size is why Petan and Ehlers fell to us in the draft, and why Crouse is projected so high in this one despite his lack of production.  Another thing about Enstrom is that he makes the players around him better. He plays a safe, predictable play, and that lets others do their thing without having to worry so much about the blue line. Buffstrom was the best D-pairing the Jets have had, he managed to make Bogo look pretty good this year, and he's the kind of player that Myers can really learn some things from. Toby just does a lot of small things, positioning and the like, that it makes up for his lack of physical play. He does all this while still maintaining a 51.3 SA% (AKA Corsi%). Now at the risk of sounding like Billy Beane, I don't care about size or point totals, I just care that he outposesses the opposition, and he does it at a top 4, if not top 2, rate. By that metric, you can also justify his salary a bit better. It's still a little high but it's not the worst contract in the world.  One more thing. People are saying he doesn't fit this team's style of play. I don't think you're wrong, but look at who's coming up in the pipeline. Morrissey, Ehlers, Petan, and even Myers aren't physical guys. There's going to be a shift in this team in a couple of years, and it's going to be towards a more skill game. That's just something to keep in mind for the next few years. Thanks for reading.  TL;DR: Go read the whole thing, I don't feel like diminishing my argument for the sake of making it easier to read."
winnipegjets,34tqp8,jesuswolf,2,Tue May 5 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with anything you've said.  The reason it's being considered though is the Jets have a major position of strength in defense depth. Consider that Trouba and Myers are locks for now and the next several seasons at the very least. Chiarot is in the same situation, but not as talented as the above, so throw him down as a bottom pairing lock for now. That leaves Stuart, Enstrom and Bfugylien for the final three spots, plus Morrisey, Harrison, Pardy, either as spares, or pieces for the future.  That's starting to push into too-many-bodies territory. Combine that with some weaknesses on the wings, and it's easy in principle to imagine a trade working out with somebody. At that point, the reason people might point to Enstrom as a trade-target is largely because he is a solid player and he might fetch a good return.  All in all, I'm not against the Jets shopping Enstrom this offseason and seeing what he's worth. Not because I want him gone by any stretch, and if they don't find a good offer, I'd be happy to see him on the Jets next season. But I could see a good puck-moving defenceman on a decent contract fetching a good return, and I think the Jets have enough depth at D to replace him and still make the team better."
winnipegjets,34tqp8,IronRook,4,Tue May 5 23:39:07 2015 UTC,"As far as defense goes, we're actually pretty thin on the left side. Stuart is not a top 4 defenseman. He is absolutely not a top 2 defenseman. Any move we make for Enstrom will be lateral at best, and probably end up hurting us. I've also never heard anyone say we should trade Enstrom because he's a solid piece. It's always because he's small, he doesn't fit in the system, etc. But really, our lack of depth on the left side is what makes Enstrom untouchable, and I can't believe I forgot that when I was writing, because that's really the biggest to keep him."
winnipegjets,34tqp8,Becau5eRea5on5,1 point,Tue May 5 23:51:13 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Josh Morrissey can make the squad, he plays left side if I'm not mistaken. I know he'll be a rookie blah blah blah. But if he is who Chevy says he is/will be, then we are in for a treat for the coming years. As for Enstrom, I'm on the fence. I'll leave it to Chevy."
winnipegjets,34tqp8,UncleBogo,3,Thu May 7 23:46:27 2015 UTC,I want to dispute you but.. you actually make me question where I stand now. All I can say is that we're going to have to choose between Buff and Enstrom at some point.
winnipegjets,34tqp8,sneezypenguin,2,Tue May 5 21:55:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with that too, we can't afford both of them after this season with Lowry, Scheif, and Trouba coming off their ELC's after next season. I think it'll really depend on where we are in the standings next season."

winnipegjets,34ldis,azadle,10,Sat May 2 04:30:39 2015 UTC,"Ladd is a hard worker. Takes some I'll timed penalities, but he shows up to play every game. On a blue collar team, he represents us well as Captain.   Frolik is a solid, versatile player, but has quickly faded into the middle of the team talent wise. He stood out when first arriving here, but he's either slid back a bit,  or the rest of the team has grown and is playing better hockey. I like what he does and what he brings to the table, but, Halischuk, Perreault, Galliardi, Stempniak, and even Tlusti all seem to have similar styles and bring some of the same things to the table. With Ehlers, Petan, and Co coming up quickly, I see Frolik being moved/unsigned."
winnipegjets,34ldis,Imthecoolestdudeever,5,Sat May 2 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"Ladd sometimes catches some flak, but I think that's because he's the captain, but not a superstar.

winnipegjets,34ldis,Hero_of_Brandon,4,Sat May 2 14:35:57 2015 UTC,"Technically Ladd is always our best player, usually he's up there for points overall even though I watch every game and don't even notice. He scores early and often and now that we're a playoff team he's going to be placed at an elite standard, which you could argue he deserves."

winnipegjets,34ldis,jeryarr,3,Sat May 2 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"You know, people sometimes rip Ladd, Little and Wheeler for not being a true #1 line, but their point production says that they are.  Over the last 4 years,  Wheeler is 22nd in the NHL in scoring.  Ladd is 42nd.  Little is 54th.  Ladd and Little move up one if you exclude Erik Karlsson ( a defenceman)  http://www.quanthockey.com/nhl/seasons/last-4-nhl-seasons-players-stats.html  That's better than most NHL teams.  An average team would have one guy at 15th, another at 45th and a 3rd guy at 75th.  Regarding your question, I really like Ladd.  He works hard and scores points.  Frolik is a versatile guy that can play 2nd line or 3rd line.  Works hard, good defence and some offensive skill. I thought he was ill-suited to a 1st line role.  Hope he re-signs, but he's only worth so much money."
winnipegjets,34ldis,dejour,3,Sun May 3 12:56:28 2015 UTC,"Frolik is just all-around good. He's got some hands, he can make passes, he can backcheck, forecheck, score goals.

Ladd's not the best player on the ice but I don't think anyone can reasonably question his commitment to the team and the guys in the room."
winnipegjets,34ldis,ehr0c,2,Sat May 2 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"I like Frolik and hope they re-sign him.  I like Ladd too.  A good, hard nosed leader.  I kinda feel like if we got a true star, that Ladd should maybe get bumped to wearing an A."
winnipegjets,34ldis,poop-chalupa,14,Sat May 2 17:29:11 2015 UTC,I don't see why a star should get the c. The best leader on the team should get the c no matter where in the line up he plays

winnipegjets,34ldis,Imthecoolestdudeever,-2,Sat May 2 18:15:51 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, but the Jets don't exactly have a franchise player yet.  They have a bunch of role players, but not someone that they can really build a team around yet.  I think if they got that player to build the team around, then giving that player the C might be appropriate.  Often those superstar type players like Toews or Crosby and go in to a team and completely change the worth ethic of everyone around them."
winnipegjets,34ldis,poop-chalupa,4,Sat May 2 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"But those players have the c because of how much leadership they bring not just because they are a star player.

winnipegjets,346zrt,13531,5,Tue Apr 28 20:27:35 2015 UTC,That's pretty awesome. Guess it has been done after all...
winnipegjets,346zrt,Gouranga,8,Tue Apr 28 20:29:09 2015 UTC,"Its a slick mask,  but its not on the same level of awesome as the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band tribute Pavelec rocks like a... boss...."
winnipegjets,346zrt,Xanick,3,Tue Apr 28 23:35:40 2015 UTC,Pavelec's first Jets mask had it as well.

winnipegjets,343tzi,ComplexChristian,10,Tue Apr 28 02:10:27 2015 UTC,"RIP my bracket, 2015-2015.  On the plus side, we get two solid picks! Yay!"
winnipegjets,343tzi,verify_deez_nuts,5,Tue Apr 28 02:57:48 2015 UTC,WOOHOOO! At least something went right for us!
winnipegjets,343tzi,jesuswolf,8,Tue Apr 28 02:12:32 2015 UTC,"We don't have enough information to know exactly which draft picks the Jets will get in the first round next year.  NHL Entry Draft Order Rules  First, the 14 non-playoff teams pick. Second, the 12 teams that do not make the conference finals pick in order of worst regular season points total to best. Third, the 3 teams remaining that do not win the cup pick in order of increasing regular season points. Finally, the 30th pick belongs to the Stanley Cup champion.  There is still one round of playoff hockey left to be played before we know which picks exactly belong to the Jets, since there are teams left that finished both above the Blues still playing and teams that finished below the Jets in terms of regular season points.  Edit: crazye97 has it exactly right"
winnipegjets,343tzi,supmang,7,Tue Apr 28 02:35:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that page is a bit old. If I recall correctly, the 30th pick belongs to the Cup winners, the 29th to the Finalist. 27 and 28 are to the Conference Finalists, by increasing order of points. 15-26 go to the teams eliminated before the Conference Finals, and are determined first by non-divisional winners, in increasing order of points, then by divisional winners in increasing order of points. At least, that's how it's been the past few years (2011 on), with exception to NJ's 30th pick. So, right now, the traded pick is guaranteed to be no better than the 23rd. For each of Montreal, Anaheim and NYR that make the Conference Finals, we fall one more pick down. If Calgary makes it to the Conference Finals, we will get the 16th pick, otherwise we get the 17th."
winnipegjets,343tzi,crazye97,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:07:05 2015 UTC,I appreciate this. Thank you.
winnipegjets,343tzi,sneezypenguin,5,Tue Apr 28 13:51:50 2015 UTC,If Calgary wins the cup I believe we would leapfrog them and get the 16th pick.  So.. go Calgary.
winnipegjets,343tzi,KillEmAll83,6,Tue Apr 28 02:13:40 2015 UTC,"As long as Calgary makes the Conference Final, we'd get the 16th pick."
winnipegjets,343tzi,crazye97,2,Tue Apr 28 04:07:48 2015 UTC,But that means lesser chance of PoMo winning the Jack Adams....  Oh well I'll take the pick!
winnipegjets,343tzi,UpVotes4Worst,7,Tue Apr 28 02:15:45 2015 UTC,There's no way he wins the coach award. Not without a single play off win. The boys didn't do him a solid in that regard.
winnipegjets,343tzi,sugaredpeaches,6,Tue Apr 28 02:26:43 2015 UTC,All the awards/trophies are voted on before the playoffs. They're just taking their sweet time with the top 3 reveal.
winnipegjets,343tzi,UpVotes4Worst,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:47:31 2015 UTC,Oooooo! The plot thickens. I didn't know that. I guess it is regarding the regular season. Well maybe PoMo still has a shot.
winnipegjets,343tzi,KillEmAll83,3,Tue Apr 28 14:36:46 2015 UTC,At any rate those are pretty solid first round picks. :)
winnipegjets,343tzi,triplejk,3,Tue Apr 28 02:18:22 2015 UTC,Chevy do your magic!
winnipegjets,343tzi,Becau5eRea5on5,0,Tue Apr 28 02:13:43 2015 UTC,"Was there another trade I was unaware of? Because we only get the lesser of those two picks, not both."
winnipegjets,343tzi,Becau5eRea5on5,6,Tue Apr 28 02:26:01 2015 UTC,The 17th is our actual pick. The 22nd was from the BUF trade.
winnipegjets,343tzi,cgwinnipeg,2,Tue Apr 28 02:31:40 2015 UTC,Ohh...
