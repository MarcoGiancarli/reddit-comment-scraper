cowboys,3e2t5a,itsaboat,8,Tue Jul 21 14:59:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with every single aspect of this except for the LBs.  They have me the most worried.  Lee can be great but he and his return are still completely a question mark as we have no idea what we'll get out of him after missing a year and don't really know how long we might have him.  McClain is a question mark as well.  Will miss the first 4 games of the season and again, we have no idea what we'll get from him mentally.  Hitchens is solid across the board and can play every position IMO... but with McClain out the first 4, he'll likely start at MLB... that leaves Wilber to start at SLB.   During Mini Camp and OTAs Wilber was already penciled in as the starter at SLB...  IMO, this guy is not an NFL starter... at all.  Maybe Wilson can mature as quickly as Hitchens and show some position flex, but otherwise, I'm not sure what our starting LB squad will look like week 1... and thereafter tbh."
cowboys,3e2t5a,rthaw,6,Tue Jul 21 16:35:17 2015 UTC,"came here to say this. Durant and carter are pretty big losses IMO, and we have no idea if lee and ro are going to play the entire season. If lee manages to play every game this year I would be surprised."
cowboys,3e2t5a,ReMiCkS_25,5,Tue Jul 21 18:27:37 2015 UTC,"Durant played well when he was on the field but he wasn't on the field enough. In his two seasons here he only played 16 games out of 34. Carter is an athletic freak and made some plays but about half way through the 2014 season Hitchens, a rookie, was starting over him. We signed Brinkley and Gackhar. They both have been starters and best thing about them is they stay healthy. They have only missed 1 game in their career."
cowboys,3e2t5a,jasoncongo,5,Tue Jul 21 19:34:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about the position because of the depth they have acquired.  Lee may play 16 games he may not play any but right now he's ready for TC. I hope Dallas minimizes his use in the preseason because we need him in the regular season.  We know McClain will be out the first four games of the season but if his knee isn't fully healed he can use that time to rest.    I'm not sure what our starting LB squad will look like week 1... and thereafter tbh.   This is how I see it before training camps:    Will Mike Sam    Lee McClain Hitchens   Hitchens Brinkley Wilber   Rvers Hitchens Rivers   Wilson Gackhar Wilson    Dallas only played in their base package about 35% of the time last season, 20ish snaps a game. Will and Mike are more important. When Dallas is in base, while McClain is gone, Brinkley makes the most sense to put at Mike. In nickel Lee and Hitchens would be the LBs.   edit: spelling"
cowboys,3e2t5a,someedude,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:02 2015 UTC,Love this counter-point and the table showing the depth that we picked up with those guys. I don't worry at all about Lee if he's on the field. He has been amazing when he is and seeing this table helps me feel better about it if he does miss some time.
cowboys,3e2t5a,Von_Skyhawk,5,Tue Jul 21 22:15:35 2015 UTC,"Great stuff but if you give me the choice between Jeremy Parnell and a 1st rd T/G + a 3rd rd T/G, I'm taking Collins and Green. I think our depth overall for OL actually improved but that's my only real disagreement with this list.  edit meant Jeremy not Darren lol"
cowboys,3e2t5a,Dr_Irrelephant,2,Tue Jul 21 21:13:10 2015 UTC,"Swing tackle is a really important position considering Free is hurt and has had his season ended with injury the past two years. Parnell is a proven player. Weems and Collins have little/no in game experience which is a bit worrisome  when we are trying to go deep into the playoffs. In a year or two the young guys will probably be much more valuable but for 2015, Parnell gives you more security."

cowboys,3e2t5a,mushpuppy,3,Tue Jul 21 17:17:16 2015 UTC,He's only been a safety for four years in his entire life. He definitely looks the part. A lot of his mistakes are mental ones. I think the pass rush can help him tremendously as well.

cowboys,3e2t5a,nokarmawhore,2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:07 2015 UTC,"Wilcox' problem is that he's playing out of position due to his athleticism. If we could have him start at SS and get a true FS, he would be a pro-bowler. Dude's fantastic when he knows what he needs to do and go straight down hill."

cowboys,3e4mhr,mushpuppy,2,Tue Jul 21 22:38:14 2015 UTC,Alright here's the list (removing players posted as a joke i.e. Quincy & Orton):  Offense:  Romo-11  Staubach-10  Allen-7  Emmitt-6  Aikman-2  Irvin-2  Dez-2  Dorsett-1  Erik Williams-1  Tyron-1  Woodson-1  Herschel-1  DeMarco-1  Defense:  Lilly-13  Sanders-8  White-6  Ware-6  For the final results I took the players receiving the highest votes from offense and defense and then took the player who received the third most votes...this would've been Staubach but since the starting quarterback role was already filled that left Primetime next on the list. Thanks everyone this was fun!

cowboys,3e4sqb,casmith07,5,Tue Jul 21 23:24:16 2015 UTC,"Should definitely continue pressing for a shorter suspension, he already sat out so many games last season."
cowboys,3e4sqb,gdaman22,2,Tue Jul 21 23:49:37 2015 UTC,Might as well go for it. Every game counts in the NFL and having him for as many games as possible helps a lot. Not like he can receive more games if he appeals...right?
cowboys,3e2ha8,lucusmarcus,12,Tue Jul 21 13:21:14 2015 UTC,"I do not care how sexy he looks throwing, he is a 2 to me because I know if it ends up in his hands, it is 50-50 [whether] he is going to make the big mistake.   Followed up by this...   The numbers don't necessarily support Romo being unreliable in crunch time. In fact, since 2011, Romo ranks second to Brees in Total QBR among 11 qualifying quarterbacks during fourth quarters and overtimes with the score tied or his team trailing by no more than eight points.   Good one, ESPN.  EDIT: Apparently these two comments are two different people's opinions."
cowboys,3e2ha8,Von_Skyhawk,7,Tue Jul 21 13:33:51 2015 UTC,"it is 50-50 [whether] he is going to make the big mistake.   This is the part that I think is funny b/c it is apparently very accurate, yet so misinformed at the same time.   His .500 winning percentage in those games (16-16 record) is best in the league over that span among those 11 quarterbacks.   So, in reality 50-50 is actually quite a compliment, but apparently that person doesn't realize it."
cowboys,3e2ha8,jasoncongo,13,Tue Jul 21 16:34:36 2015 UTC,"Andrew Luck is the #3 QB in the NFL right now, only behind Rogers and Brady. But Romo threw that interception a couple years back, so he can be #9."
cowboys,3e2ha8,Gunderik,6,Tue Jul 21 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"In fairness, the first thing you posted is a quote by one of the dozens of people who was questioned. The second is editorial statistic, so it makes sense that the article would offer a countering argument."
cowboys,3e2ha8,Nation911,10,Tue Jul 21 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"Welcome to our second annual ""Quarterback Tiers"" project, with a voting panel of 35 league insiders (up from 26 last year). The process was straightforward: The coaches and evaluators I polled placed each of the 32 projected starters into one of five tiers, with Tier 1 reserved for the very best and Tier 5 reserved for the very worst.  While it's far from rigid, our NFL front office and coach voters typically categorized the tiers as follows:  • Tier 1 quarterbacks can carry their teams week after week and contend for championships without as much help. • Tier 2 QBs are less consistent and need more help, but good enough to figure prominently into a championship equation. • Tier 3 are quarterbacks who are good enough to start but need lots of support, making it tougher to contend at the highest level. • Tier 4 is typically reserved for unproven starters or those who might not be expected to last in the lineup all season. Voters used the fifth tier sparingly.  We gave each insider anonymity so they could speak candidly. They did not disappoint. The 35th and final insider, a longtime defensive coordinator, could not believe it when I told him five of the previous 34 had left Andrew Luck outside the top tier on their ballots. ""Those five guys didn't play against him. He is a 1, I am telling you. He is f------ good. Nobody blocks anybody up front, and he is still good.""  In the end, we averaged the tier rankings for each quarterback to produce a 1-32 ranking across four tiers (no starting QBs received enough Tier 5 votes to fall into the fifth tier). There was movement in the pecking order from our piece last year. Peyton Manning and Drew Brees slipped. Luck and Ben Roethlisberger surged. Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady held firm and were the only unanimous Tier 1 players. And perhaps surprisingly, Derek Carr holds an early lead on Teddy Bridgewater among the 2014 draftees.  There's a lot to digest, so we won't delay any longer. First, though, a big thank you to our panel: eight personnel directors, six general managers, four head coaches, five offensive coordinators, five defensive coordinators, three salary-cap managers, two ex-GMs, two ex-head coaches, and one offensive assistant coach.  Tier 1 (6 QBs total)"
cowboys,3e2ha8,bwill05,5,Tue Jul 21 13:21:34 2015 UTC,"T-1. Aaron Rodgers | Green Bay Packers   Average rating: 1.0 | Change in rating: +3.7%  2014 Rank: T-1  Rodgers tied with Brady in the voting as a unanimous Tier 1 choice, but he gets top billing based on feedback from voters. A personnel director with NFC North experience called him ""unequivocally"" the best in the league. An offensive coach who studied every offensive snap for Green Bay and New England last season called Rodgers better than Brady by a noticeable notch.  ""I hate playing against him,"" a defensive coordinator said.  There is lots to like about Rodgers if you don't have to face him. He seems unflappable. He saves plays with his legs. He ranks as arguably the game's best back-shoulder fade thrower. He possesses superior vision when forced to move. And he knows where his receivers are going to be in a pinch. These are some of the qualities one veteran coach rattled off.  ""From the time he decides to throw the ball to the time it comes off his hand is the quickest in the NFL by a lot,"" this coach said. ""Tony Romo is also quick, but Rodgers throws spirals down the field that carry. Romo will do it and it will float. Rodgers doesn't even have to try. He is so explosively quick. He can hold the ball longer and he knows it.""  It's no revelation seeing Rodgers atop a list of NFL quarterbacks, so I pressed this offensive coach for additional details.  ""Andrew Luck has the best technique and Rodgers is a little more toesy [in his stance], but it makes no difference because Rodgers is so lightning quick and so accurate and confident of where the ball is going to go,"" he said. ""There is an attention to detail there that Mike McCarthy coaches and gets everyone to understand the importance of. Rodgers cuts everything loose all the time because he knows where everyone is going to be. It does not feel like a defeat to him to run it or throw the 2-yard check-down. He throws it joyfully because he knows he is moving the offense. There is also never any drama, ever. That is another best part of him. He does not say much, but he is so focused and so passionate that he gets it done with his eyeballs.""  One head coach on Brady: ""His command is there. He still has the arm strength and accuracy."" Elsa/Getty Images                                 T-1. Tom Brady | New England Patriots   Average rating: 1.0 | Change in rating: +3.7%  2014 Rank: T-1  None of the voters had reservations about placing Brady into the top tier as the quarterback's 38th birthday approaches, and likewise, none raised the Deflategate scandal as a factor in voting.  ""Brady is still on another level because he just mentally dominates every game, every time,"" an offensive coach said.  Brady struggled early last season when his line faltered and his best receiving target, Rob Gronkowski, was still rounding into form following injury. But he didn't let a brutal outing against Kansas City in Week 4 define his season.  ""K.C. knocked the s--- out of him and you could see he got frustrated in that game,"" a personnel director said. ""He came back the next week against Cincinnati and was unbelievable. I was like, 'Holy s---, this guy is unreal.' He is still a 1. He is doing it with very average weapons other than Gronk.""  Another personnel director said he thought Peyton Manning might have suffered a meltdown by now if forced to go through as many weapons as Brady has over the years. This director hailed Brady for functioning at a high level with Wes Welker, Julian Edelman and even undrafted free agents at receiver.  ""If anybody is a 1, he is a 1,"" the director said. ""I do not know if we could name all the guys who have started at the skill positions for them over the past three years. I'd probably leave out three guys.""  The Patriots have had 25 different players start at running back, wide receiver or tight end since 2012, counting playoffs. That ties for the fifth-highest total in the league and is above the 20.9 average. The number is 15 for Manning's Denver Broncos, the second-lowest figure in the NFL (Philadelphia, 14). Brady has had 12 different wide receivers start over that span, the second-highest figure in the league (Jacksonville, 14). Denver has had six, tied for the league low.  ""He is still a 1,"" a head coach said. ""His command is there. He still has the arm strength and accuracy. He never was a great move guy, but he still makes a play or two with his feet as needed."""
cowboys,3e2ha8,americanrealism,5,Tue Jul 21 13:21:55 2015 UTC,"3. Andrew Luck | Indianapolis Colts   Average rating: 1.14 | Change in rating: +23.8%  2014 Rank: 5  Luck went from a disputed Tier 1 QB one year ago to a resounding choice after again carrying a weak roster to the postseason.  ""Luck didn't get a 1 from everybody?"" a GM asked. He was incredulous. ""You want to talk about a guy who makes the team? He is Michael Jordan. Their defense sucks. Every game, he has to outscore everybody. He is the epitome of a 1. If I was to draft tomorrow any player in the NFL, it would be Andrew Luck one, Aaron Rodgers two.""  The five voters who placed Luck in the second tier cited a few reasons. Some thought Luck needed to do a better job protecting the football. Others pointed to Luck's underwhelming resume in the postseason. Luck also benefits from playing in a weak division. (One defensive coordinator's response: ""Those five guys didn't play against him."")  ""It is almost like we are giving him the benefit of the doubt just in terms of numbers, but he has won games,"" another GM said. ""Yes, he is in an easy division, but he won, even as a rookie. They would not win without him.""  Some quarterbacks with winning records benefit from top-flight defenses and/or strong running games. Luck has won even with the Colts being especially weak in those complementary phases.  ""I don't know who didn't give Luck a 1, but he is better than all of them,"" a head coach said. ""He is as smart as Peyton, he is as accurate as Brady, he is tougher than Ben and he is as athletic as RG III.""  Even those who thought Luck deserved a second-tier vote at this point felt as though he would ascend into the top tier before long.  ""Luck is one of the great pressure performers in our league,"" a personnel director said. ""He might have spells where accuracy is not great, but when the chips are on the line, he performs. For a young quarterback to survive some of the hits he has taken behind that line, not everyone would have done that. He is strong. He has an even head, which you have to have to be special at that position. I'd be surprised if soon we're not talking about him in same breath we talk about Aaron.""  One head coach on Roethlisberger: ""The productivity is unbelievable. He is clearly a 1 to me.""                                   4. Ben Roethlisberger | Pittsburgh Steelers   Average rating: 1.37 | Change in rating: +25.7%  2014 Rank: 7  Roethlisberger ascended into the top tier after ranking with Philip Rivers atop the second tier one year ago. His ability to carry the Steelers without support from a strong defense raised Big Ben's profile for some. A head coach said he thought Roethlisberger would have belonged in the top tier for most of his career if the Steelers had run a more wide-open offense earlier in his career.  ""He throws to win games by himself and he can do it every week,"" an offensive coach said. ""He could throw for 350 every week. I did not give him his due until I really saw this past year, with the average defense and only one top receiver, getting it done every week and keeping his interceptions down.""  An evaluator with coaching experience who saw Roethlisberger play live twice last season moved him into the top tier on his ballot.  ""He is back to standing there, shrugging off the blitz, sliding over, making the pass, over and over,"" this evaluator said. ""He threw for over 600 yards with six touchdowns against Baltimore. When you can do that against what has been a good defense historically, that is a 1, and I don't want to play him.""  Roethlisberger has topped 630 drop-backs in each of the past two regular seasons, while averaging 37.3 pass attempts per game, up from 29.6 per game previously in his career. Roethlisberger also has the playing strength and arm to carry the offense in poor weather.  ""Ben can beat you in any part of the country,"" a head coach said. ""Who was in a more productive offense last year? The productivity is unbelievable. He is clearly a 1 to me.""  A defensive coordinator placed Roethlisberger among the 2s because he thought consistency over time was an issue.  ""I could see why people would say he is a 1,"" this coordinator said. ""On some days, I could see it. I would see him spending more time in the 2 category, and that is why I put him there."""
cowboys,3e2ha8,Tomcat1108,4,Tue Jul 21 13:22:43 2015 UTC,"5. Peyton Manning | Denver Broncos   Average rating: 1.43 | Change in rating: -37.6%  2014 Rank: T-1  Some of the voters who placed Manning in the top tier did so reluctantly because they questioned whether he could still carry an offense for a full season given what they saw as obviously diminished throwing ability.  ""I'm going to give him the lowest 1 that there is,"" one voter said.  A GM who placed Manning in the top tier added this disclaimer: ""I can see people saying he is a 2. The arm strength is such an issue. It is all about how you play in January, in the cold weather and big games.""  A head coach who placed Manning in the second tier said he no longer thought Manning could lead a team to a championship without getting considerably more help than he has needed in the past. Still, voters expressed amazement over Manning's ability to play at such a high level in recent seasons after enduring a career-threatening neck injury. And he still received enough votes to remain in this category.  ""Until they lose and don't go to the playoffs, he is a 1,"" a defensive coach said, ""because he is the one winning all the games. He has gotta be a 1. He is one of those guys, too, that the people around him play at a much higher level because of him.""  One defensive coordinator pointed to Manning's 2014 stat line -- 4,727 yards passing with 39 touchdowns and a 101.5 passer rating -- while asking what more a quarterback needed to do for voters to place him in the top tier. One counter: Manning's late-season struggles. He had 10 interceptions over the final eight regular-season games, tied for third-most in the NFL.  ""I think he is a clear 2,"" another defensive coordinator said. ""It's arm strength, mobility, everything. He is still smart and that will never change, but you have to get the ball there, too.""  One offensive coordinator on Brees: ""He is just losing his juice. Things have to be perfect for him to be himself.""                                    6. Drew Brees | New Orleans Saints   Average rating: 1.49 | Change in rating: -43.1%  2014 Rank: T-1  Brees nearly fell out of the top tier even though his 71.6 Total QBR score in 2014 was the third-highest mark of his nine-year tenure with the Saints. Some thought he deserved another year as a 1 because the team's struggles last season had more to do with a diminished supporting cast on both sides of the ball.  ""Brees was one of the hardest,"" an offensive coordinator said. ""He doesn't throw as well. His lower body is not as good. He's been nicked up a little bit. He is just losing his juice. Things have to be perfect for him to be himself.""  The consensus was that Brees had fallen off and that he was sliding into the second tier if he hadn't quite reached it at this point. His drop from a 1.04 average rating among voters in 2014 to a 1.49 average this year marked a 43.1-percent decline, the largest for any of the 27 returning starters.  Voters acknowledged the diminished weaponry around Brees. A coach who studied the Saints this offseason said it was striking to see Brees ""hung out to dry"" playing for a team that no longer had as many opportunities to shift into its four-minute offense while protecting leads.  ""Physically, he is a 2, but I think you have to give him a 1 because he can carry a team,"" a head coach said, still thinking through his decision. ""He may dip into the 2s this year. When guys get older and start getting hit, especially guys with vision problems, they start playing a lot faster, almost too fast, and panic shows up. I saw some of that in Drew last season.""  By the end of the conversation, the head coach had talked himself out of putting Brees in the top tier.

cowboys,3e0gsh,uniquee1,-6,Tue Jul 21 01:53:56 2015 UTC,Tates way overrated and way overpaid imho.
cowboys,3e0gsh,Washington_Fitz,3,Tue Jul 21 11:20:42 2015 UTC,Someone with 100 receptions and 1300 yards shouldn't be called overrated and with those stats to be making $31M over 5 years is a great deal.
cowboys,3e0gsh,jlacomb17,2,Tue Jul 21 11:27:21 2015 UTC,"Brett Perriman once had 108 catches in a season. TJ Houshmandzadeh had 112 one year. When you throw a lot or don't have anybody else to throw to, somebody has to catch it. Tate was just in a perfect situation last year with a team that threw the ball 600 times and with Calvin Johnson being hobbled all season."
cowboys,3e0gsh,WallyMetropolis,3,Tue Jul 21 13:18:07 2015 UTC,Housh was a really really good #2. That's a pretty good comparison.
cowboys,3e0gsh,jlacomb17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:41 2015 UTC,"I thought so too, and he got paid like a number 2. Tate gets paid like a number one. Houshmandzadeh was the 49th highest paid WR in 2007, when he had 112 catches. Tate is the 19th highest paid receiver."
cowboys,3e0gsh,WallyMetropolis,3,Tue Jul 21 16:08:24 2015 UTC,"He may be overpaid, but for the overall question of who has the best set of receivers, I think you have to say Detroit is in that mix."
cowboys,3e0gsh,jlacomb17,3,Tue Jul 21 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure. I think the Lions have a great receiving core. Top 5 to 10 in the league."
cowboys,3e0gsh,Washington_Fitz,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:11 2015 UTC,His average yards per catch has been the same so that doesn't make sense. Of course he is getting more receptions after leaving Seattle and going to a pass heavy team.   That doesn't mean he is overrated as the numbers don't even support that notion.
cowboys,3e0gsh,jlacomb17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:50 2015 UTC,"The numbers do support that. He was 24th in the NFL in expected pointed added (EPA) per play and 13th in total EPA despite having the 10th highest target percentage. Calvin Johnson had a higher EPA, even though he played less games."
cowboys,3e0gsh,Washington_Fitz,3,Tue Jul 21 13:28:32 2015 UTC,The point isn't that he is better than Calvin... The point is he is a good second receiver and as such makes the Lions receiving core one of the most potent.  Also CJ only had a slightly better EPA which makes sense as Calvin is the best WR in the game. And Calvin only missed 3 games.  Tate is Top 10 in receptions and yards. He isn't some scrub.
cowboys,3e0gsh,jlacomb17,0,Tue Jul 21 13:35:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he was a scrub, I said he was overpaid.  Edited to say what I actually meant"
cowboys,3e0gsh,Drugs_and_Hugs,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:11 2015 UTC,"Yea, as Fitz said, Tate. They also have multiple good receiving backs, and a 2nd year receiving TE in Ebron. He was a first round pick so he could pan out. I'm not sure I would put them in the list as a complete receiving core though. Their TE and slot are unproven."
cowboys,3e0gsh,HiveNode,0,Tue Jul 21 04:04:09 2015 UTC,"Packers and Falcons are the only ones I can definitely say are better than us right now. Cruz may not be the receiver he once was when he comes back to the game, Odell might not be as good as he was in his rookie year, but if Cruz does make a comeback and Odell lives up to the hype then they're better than us.  Denver has DT and a bunch of no-names that people are hyping based on physical traits alone. I feel that pick is living in the past since they had such a beastly unit 2 years ago.  Lions have a great #1 and #2 but nothing really legitimate outside of that.  Colts are probably better than us but I'll wait on this one because our guys have just as much potential as theirs, along with Dez being much better than Hilton and Witten being much better Allen or Fleener."

cowboys,3dyw2h,JRog13,36,Mon Jul 20 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"It's all a domino effect, if we franchised Murray then Dez could have heard other offers and maybe left. The money guaranteed to Murray would have been a large chunk of change too. Maybe no deals for some of are additions this off season or retention of players like Beasley.   I think the FO made the smart decision here, one thing I think I gets overlooked often  is that Murray had a lot of injuries in the past and even was injured this previous year. Who knows what next year looks like for him,  if our line is as good as we think it is, well then we may be alright in the end."
cowboys,3dyw2h,jmlives27,20,Mon Jul 20 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"Also, it is a lot easier to get production out of a mediocre runningback than a mediocre wide receiver. To elaborate runningbacks can succeed as one trick ponies, while if a wide receiver is a one trick pony, they're easier to shut down. With runningbacks you can find ways to utilize them that will compliment their playstyle. Wide receivers are more limited though. No matter what, receivers must be able to get off the line of scrimmage, run a route, and catch a ball. You can try to use reverses, but it will only work so many times. Look at Devin Hester who is a talented football player, but struggled in receiving. It just made sense to invest in Dez, because it would be a lot harder to replace him than Murray."

cowboys,3dyw2h,ElGoddamnDorado,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"Oxford dictionary defines ""Argument"" as - An exchange of diverging or opposite views, typically a heated or angry one  Merriam Webster defines ""Argument"" as -a statement or series of statements for or against something  : a discussion in which people express different opinions about something  : an angry disagreement  thefreedictionary.com defines ""Argument"" as  ar·gu·ment  (är′gyə-mənt) n.  1. a. A discussion in which the parties involved express disagreement with one another; a debate: philosophical arguments over the nature of existence.  b. An angry discussion involving disagreement among the participants; a quarrel: The roommates had an argument about whose turn it was to wash the dishes.  c. Archaic A reason or matter for dispute or contention: ""sheath'd their swords for lack of argument"" (Shakespeare).  Dictionary.com defines ""Argument"" as  1. an oral disagreement; verbal opposition; contention; altercation: a violent argument.  2. a discussion involving differing points of view; debate: They were deeply involved in an argument about inflation.  3. a process of reasoning; series of reasons: I couldn't follow his argument.  4. a statement, reason, or fact for or against a point: This is a strong argument in favor of her theory.  5. an address or composition intended to convince or persuade; persuasive discourse.  6. subject matter; theme: The central argument of his paper was presented clearly.  Urbandictionary defines argument as:  A discussion that occurs in which I'm right, but he/she/they haven't realized it yet.  So unless you're reaching for the 6th definition from dictionary.com I'm not really sure what you're trying to get at. Regardless, using common vernacular when in a discussion online is the best way to go about communicating, not stretching for semantics.  The reason I pointed it out here is because in common every day use the word ""argument"" places a negative or at least contentious connotation on /u/SuperKerfuz's point, when in reality /u/SuperKerfuz was agreeing with and expanding on the post above.

That's a steep hit, if you're going to do that, you may just want to give him the deal philly gave him.  I'm glad we didn't sign him, he's earned a long term contract, glad he got it somewhere."
cowboys,3dyw2h,Lycaon_,9,Mon Jul 20 17:37:23 2015 UTC,It was bigger. Almost 11 million.
cowboys,3dyw2h,verossiraptors,5,Mon Jul 20 17:39:18 2015 UTC,I just know it was a crazy high amount that no one in their right mind would give a RB
cowboys,3dyw2h,sharknado88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:31 2015 UTC,http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/demarco-murray/  5 year $40m.
cowboys,3dyw2h,mattw3344,4,Mon Jul 20 19:59:24 2015 UTC,Only $21 guaranteed over 5 years. People were asking us to give him 12 million guaranteed (the franchise tag) over 1 year.
cowboys,3dyw2h,verossiraptors,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:55 2015 UTC,"10.9 for RB, 12.8 for WR"
cowboys,3dyw2h,ocr1,4,Tue Jul 21 02:20:08 2015 UTC,"Like you, I'm glad the Cowboys didn't sign him.  He'd shown ability in his career, but he'd also shown a troublesome proclivity to seek contact, which is not good for a RB, as constant pounding wears even the best RB down (vz. Earl Campbell, the best power runner I've seen).  In that regard, Murray's injury history speaks for itself.  He had a year for the ages last season, but I doubt he'll ever come close to doing anything like that again, even behind the Eagles' excellent line.  As I've said many times, I expect the Eagles (and their fans) to regret signing Murray to that deal.  The Cowboys needed to move on; I expect they'll get excellent production from the RBs they do have.  In any event, it'll be interesting to see what Randle, McFadden, Williams, Dunbar can do."
cowboys,3dyw2h,mushpuppy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:17 2015 UTC,"The franchise tag would have been the perfect contract for Dallas to give Murray (assuming they could have worked out a long term deal with Dez before the start of free agency.)  11 million is a lot of money for one year, yes, but a top 3 running back is always going to come at a premium.  11 million isn't too much to pay a productive player, but when that player quits churning out the yards in 2 years after 700+ additional touches, now you're on the line for the rest of the guaranteed money that had been spread out over the next 5 years comes as a cap hit all at once if you want to cut him."
cowboys,3dyw2h,ocr1,7,Tue Jul 21 02:34:25 2015 UTC,"No, the reason we were able to secure a deal with Dez is being we franchise tagged him, therefor allowing the cowboys more time to work out a deal with him, plus on top of that we became the only team that was allowed to make a deal with him so probably ended up giving him a lot less money compared to what some other teams would have given a WR of that caliber.  If we franchised tag Murray I bet you some other team would of given Megatron level worth of money."
cowboys,3dyw2h,WhiteLightning1107,3,Mon Jul 20 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"I agree. If Dez hit free agency, then he would've made Calvin Johnson money."
cowboys,3dyw2h,SuperKerfuz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"Actually the franchise tag we used in Dez was a non exclusive one meaning any team could negotiate with him. The franchise tag only meant we could match whatever deal he would get and he had to accept it, or if we didn't want to match the offer the team that would sign Dez would have to give us 2 first round picks in next 2 years drafts."
cowboys,3dyw2h,tiagom0702,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:16:46 2015 UTC,but lets me real here no team is going to give up 2 first round draft pick for a WR of any caliber.
cowboys,3dyw2h,WhiteLightning1107,0,Tue Jul 21 13:09:57 2015 UTC,"I know, but you said no one could negotiate with Dez, I just wanted you to know that wasn't true. Obviously no one wanted to negotiate with him and give up 2 first round picks."
cowboys,3dyw2h,tiagom0702,7,Tue Jul 21 13:17:06 2015 UTC,"They were never going to pay him over their final offer. period. It's over johnny, over."
cowboys,3dyw2h,protoplast,4,Mon Jul 20 17:42:48 2015 UTC,Could have? Sure. Worth it? Not at all. Dez is the better player and there's no guarantee we would have been able to work out a deal with him. Check overthecap.com if you need cap info and Mike Fisher is a great follow on twitter for help
cowboys,3dyw2h,-chadillac,3,Mon Jul 20 19:00:47 2015 UTC,"Well seeing how Murray isn't Eric Dickerson, he will fall to the curse of 370 carries...so I'm glad we didn't keep him"
cowboys,3dyw2h,Khal_Half_Chub,4,Mon Jul 20 19:45:46 2015 UTC,Everyone blames the Dez catch for that game @ GB but no one seems to remember that massive fumble Murray had right before that... The one where he had a massive hole to run through and Peppers was able to sneak his hand in there right as he was about to break free to pay dirt
cowboys,3dyw2h,DemHardyBoys,5,Tue Jul 21 19:02:43 2015 UTC,The Dez situation had zero to do with us letting Murray go.  The FO let Murray go because they didn't think his future production would be worth what the Eagles paid.
cowboys,3dyw2h,fightintxag13,5,Mon Jul 20 18:22:11 2015 UTC,I think the rest of the league would of rather have seen us sign Murray and trade/release/cut/etc Dez.
cowboys,3dyw2h,emackn,18,Mon Jul 20 18:31:53 2015 UTC,You know Eagles fans would be laughing at injury-prone Murray being a product of the line and letting the best receiver in the NFL walk if that happened.
cowboys,3dyw2h,HiveNode,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:52 2015 UTC,I wanted Murray to get paid... and he did..... but I also hope he works out as well for Philly as Felix Jones did. I like it when our table scraps taste like tears of regret.
cowboys,3dyw2h,MostlyAnnoying,2,Mon Jul 20 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Cowboys would have franchised Murray. They had a number in mind and the franchise tag is obviously above that number. Even with Murray, the running game was bound to regress anyways."
cowboys,3dyw2h,zsxecorp,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:37 2015 UTC,signing or franchiseing murray would probably have meant we couldn't have signed Hardy....(guessing...i can't back this up) ....I'd take Hardy all day.
cowboys,3dyw2h,oldboot,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:08 2015 UTC,"Murray would have held out just like dez did. An RB that had a year like Murray did needs to get a contract and gauranteed money. Dez could stay top of his game much longer than a RB like murray  (with his injury history). Only way for Murray to get payed is to make a deal now off his huge season.  Basically, Murray would have done the same deal negotialtung that Dez did. Only Murray wanted the contract sooner and was not above going to another team to make his money."
cowboys,3dyw2h,Slammybutt,0,Mon Jul 20 17:45:10 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Murray wouldn't have held out, because he wouldn't have had the luxury to be able to use that as an effective negotiating tactic. If I remember correctly, Murray was asked about how he'd feel about Dallas francising him during last season... As it was widely speculated that would happen.  He just said ""I understand it's a business."""
cowboys,3dyw2h,tuitilidie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:42 2015 UTC,"That means literally nothing. He understood it was a business, so he shopped around for a better deal. If he wanted to stay a cowboy he would have held out like Dez did and not taken the franchise tag. No running back after last years performance takes a 1 year deal. Historically, their production plummets setting up for a bad contract the next. RB's only usually get one chance to land a great deal. With Murrays injury history, it was all or nothing this year."
cowboys,3dyw2h,Slammybutt,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"Or just have signed him, yes."

I guess I'm in the minority but when I see his game he looks fast and has very underrated power. He's been in the top 100 (fwiw) before the wheels fell off. There's been several guys come to Dallas recently that weren't considered very good and they played great. Durant was considered a jag by some, he was arguably our best player on defense down the stretch.  You never know.  Hopefully since he sucks no one will pay him any attention./s"
cowboys,3duv0q,devontg,3,Mon Jul 20 17:02:46 2015 UTC,I actually am right with you. I've always been a big McFadden fan and I was thrilled with the price they paid for him. I could see this being a McClain/Durant kind of deal.

I don't know what happened to him, people forget he's no machine if he wasn't inspired having season after shitty season on a team that Al Davis made a laughing stock, having the Jamarcus Russell fiasco as your QB or none at all, no pass game to speak of that shit could wear you down.

Besides, im a huge dallas fan - been that way for my entire life - and even i know that John Daly wouldnt bet that in vegas. Lets pull our heads out of the clouds and focus. Its about the TEAM.   If he does, id be pleasantly wrong. I do think however if they choose to keep all 3 backs, a rotating trio of sorts.  I would really like it if they found a way to use 2 of the backs for, say, 3 quarters with good success.   Then, pulling out a trick from the old marion baber days, bring in your savage in the 4th quarter so hes super fresh, and now that the OLine has beat the other teams front into submission, the fresh back will have freeway sized lanes to run through and smash through the secondary with pure speed due to his freshness.  That, and a whats could be one of the best years for the passing game with witten, cole-train, dez and crew.. Wow.   Now only if the defense plays even better than they did last year. They have the staff, guys just need to play to their level.  Yep, im looking at you secondary. You better fucking lock it down this year. And Sean Lee... DONT get fucking hurt again."

cowboys,3dvba3,moogie_boogie,21,Sun Jul 19 20:41:59 2015 UTC,"If I was an NFL player I would want a security detail on me at all times. We act like the Cowboys putting Dez with a security detail was a bad thing and should have been stopped, but I see it a little differently.   To be clear, he was not being babysat by these people. They wouldn't sit around and say, ""No Dez, you aren't allowed to go in there."" ""No Dez, you aren't allowed to do that."" Dez had his own free will to do as he pleased. They were there for his own protection. So that if Dez did get into something, they could step in and take over or get him out of there.  For example, he was allowed to go to the club. But if some guy started harassing Dez, his detail would step in. They weren't ever telling him he couldn't do something.   Just seems smart to me. But Dez probably does have himself surrounded by some level of security. Even if it's just his boys hanging around. I'm sure they all know to keep Dez far away from anything that could potentially hurt him. Hopefully."

cowboys,3dvba3,mo0op,2,Sun Jul 19 20:56:04 2015 UTC,"They stopped that some time ago. I remember reading about it when somebody else picked up someone they thought might make trouble and the media said he was under ""Dez-like restrictions."" Which was ironic because at the time Dez wasn't even under watch anymore.  Also I think its equal protection for the player and the franchise. Its like a daycare where they have the 2 adults rule. Every child is overseen by 2 adults at a time at all times to ensure that no child is ever alone with 1 adult. Every NFL player should know to never find themselves alone in certain situations that would be normal to people like us."

cowboys,3dsfrq,keanex,3,Sun Jul 19 15:57:34 2015 UTC,That's not true. Diamonds are a terrible investment because they aren't supply constrained (and they can now be made synthetically).
cowboys,3dsfrq,glengarryglenzach,-3,Sun Jul 19 14:29:11 2015 UTC,"Depends on the diamond.  Synthetic diamonds do not fetch the same price as ""real"" diamonds."
cowboys,3dsfrq,schoolsbelly,5,Sun Jul 19 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"Right, although they're chemically identical. Which makes the ""real"" diamonds a poor investment."
cowboys,3dsfrq,glengarryglenzach,4,Sun Jul 19 15:02:40 2015 UTC,Except synthetic diamonds have a lower resale value compared to real diamonds. You could do some research
cowboys,3dsfrq,schoolsbelly,6,Sun Jul 19 15:09:53 2015 UTC,Jelwery never resells for more than you bought it for unless it is special in some way. A gold chain is a poor investment as are diamonds. You'd be better off buying gold stocks.
cowboys,3dsfrq,keanex,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:59:00 2015 UTC,That would depend on the price of gold at purchase and at resale.

cowboys,3dsfrq,keanex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:58:16 2015 UTC,"I have done research, there's no need to be combative. What I'm getting at is there's a market imbalance in diamonds - they are made to seem rare when they aren't, and they can be created artificially. Economically, artificial diamonds are a perfect substitute for natural diamonds, which caps the possible appreciation for natural diamonds as consumers will just buy identical synthetics if natural prices get out of control. These factors combined make diamonds a poor investment vehicle."

cowboys,3dsfrq,NoHuddle,5,Sun Jul 19 02:26:09 2015 UTC,"Your making some big assumptions on my part there. You don't know exactly how I feel about Dez.   I think he's done a phenomenal job of moulding himself into the person he is off the field since when he came into the league. He is an adult, and he seems to be doing real well in his personal life.  But if we are being completely real, Dez is at a predisposition to be caught up in something based on the sole fact of who he is. The man just got paid and is rich as fuck. He came from a lower economic society than the average person, and that alone puts him at a disadvantage. It's a sad fact of this American life unfortunately. There are tons of studies on this.   In the end, Dez has about a million ""yes"" people around him, and all I hope is that he's watching out for himself. Because in the end, there is nobody who has his personal interest at heart more than him.   None of that needed to be said though. I think Dez will end up being fine.

cowboys,3dswy7,elshiznato,4,Sun Jul 19 18:30:32 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, Staubach was before my time so I don't have a ton to go off of. Aikman lead his team to multiple super bowls because of his accuracy and decision making which I think is key. Romo is probably more skilled but until he gets a super bowl, I'd have to go with Aikman.  It's obvious Aikman had better teams but he played the role of what was required as a quarterback to a tee."

cowboys,3dswy7,Dumpster_jedi71,4,Mon Jul 20 16:04:49 2015 UTC,"I've been watching the Cowboys since 1971.  The top two (for me) are easy: Bob Lilly and Randy White.  They're two of the very few in the whole league who are in the running for greatest NFL player of all time (though Jim Brown still would have to win that (with Lawrence Taylor probably a close second)).  In any event, the third is a lot tougher, as there are so many possibilities: Bob Hayes, Roger Staubach, Tony Dorsett, Rayfield Wright, Cornell Green, Mel Renfro, Ed Jones, Charlie Waters, Cliff Harris, Harvey Martin (who had a motor that never quit), and more recent guys like Aikman, Emmitt, Irvin, Larry Allen, Leon Lett, Charles Haley, Deion Sanders.  Many of those of course are Hall of Famers; those who aren't should be (and probably would be if they'd played for any other team).  I'm tempted to say Ed Jones to complete my triumvirate; Sanders because with Lilly/White he'd have 15 INTs/season.  Hard to pick the third.  FYI in time Tyron Smith, Travis Frederick, Zack Martin may join that list.  Just not yet.  Romo, I dunno.  As terrific a career as he's had, well, I dunno.  Also FYI Dorsett was a better RB than Smith.  Different styles and a different age.  But Dorsett was the best RB the Cowboys ever had.  Smooth moves, extremely quick, fast, and tough.  And Bob Hayes was so good he changed the game.  Not many players you could say that about.    Anyhow a fun exercise for the offseason.  P.S. To Easy: you should go through and add up who all got the most votes!"

But if there's one guy on offense that I can guarantee I have that will be great would have to be a QB. I just couldn't trust that I'd have Emmitt with someone like Quincy Carter ruining it all instead of a Staubach, Aikman, or Romo that could get the job done. Same with a wideout, lineman, or Witten.  For defense there's no one that could stop Ware and Bob Lilly together. You'd just have to give up hope since one or both is coming to kill you."

But these days, I feel like the organization is definitely going to make better decisions than I would. So I have confidence. And that's weird."

cowboys,3dr651,candleruse,3,Sat Jul 18 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good deal for both sides, but didn't Dez get a signing bonus that's prorated over the life of the contract? I think that means that there's 4 mil in guaranteed money already for that year. Also, if they restructure his deal, like they've done with Romo and Smith, that could add more guaranteed dead money to the later years of the contract. Then again, they've become more selective with that, recently, but he could require a pretty hefty cap hit in years 3-4 of the contract.  I'm a little surprised that they've reduced Dez's cap number over 5 mil this year when they already made room for his cap hit under the franchise tag. They could have frontloaded the guaranteed money and the cap hit earlier, taking off some of the cap hit in the later years of the contract. I wonder if that means they're trying to get other players done/extended this season.  Edit: apparently, the 2016 and 2017 salaries are fully guaranteed, which means that they wouldn't be able to reduce his cap hits through a restructure until the 2018 year, I think."

cowboys,3drdie,dcb1221,6,Sat Jul 18 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's out of the question, but it makes more sense for us to hold on to other guys who won't be as costly, while our young DEs progress. If Hardy goes for similar money to this year, I'd seriously consider it. He might like playing under Rod and his fit in our team and takes a fair offer from us, rather than the best. His off the field concerns could scare a few people off as well.  But for the cost of Hardy, we could probably get Crawford, Ro, and maybe even a decent corner or good rb. We can probably spend 15-20 million comfortably next year if we cut Carr of he takes a paycut, but there are a number of ways we could go about it. Ro could go and we could pick up early LB talent that's usually available in the second, Our DEs show up and we retain Crawford so we have a solid D-Line for a number of years, Carr takes the Paycut and we draft a corner high to replace Mo's spot, Randle/McFadden work brilliantly and we don't need RB help.   I think we'll lose or let go a couple of our depth guys (Bernadeau, Dunbar, Wilber, Hanna) and it just becomes a game of who shows up next season, who wants too much money, and what do we think we can do with the draft prospects next year."
cowboys,3drdie,Drearian,4,Sat Jul 18 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"I remember someone asked if he'd like to keep playing with Dallas after his contract is up and he said, ""If Dallas will have me.""

I mean, we got him for a good price this time, maybe playing for a good team is more valuable to him than making top dollar? Maybe I'm just being optimistic."
cowboys,3drdie,imnotedwardcullen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:29:20 2015 UTC,"If we make a good run in to the playoffs, I wouldn't be surprised. It's not like he's not at the top end of the payscale anyway. I don't think anyone will be willing to offer him 16/yr like Watt or Houston or Quinn or anything, unless he racks up some massive numbers. If you count his bonuses he's likely to make something like 12.5 I think. It's a fair price for him."

cowboys,3drdie,Slayer1791,2,Sat Jul 18 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"he absolutely will not give a discount becuase we ""took a chance,"" that is the reason he negotiated a no franchise tag...he is gonna go where they pay him the most after this year, which most likely wont' be dallas."

cowboys,3drdie,Slayer1791,2,Mon Jul 20 19:33:57 2015 UTC,"fair enough, but I dont' see us matching any offers, expecially since we have invested high draft picks in the line... Hardy is a stop-gap unless he is willing to sign a more reasonable deal."
cowboys,3drdie,oldboot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:32 2015 UTC,"I imagine him wanting Houston money, not being able to get it, but still being too much for us to re-sign him. The only way I see this happening is if Romo comes out and says he only sees himself playing a couple more years, because if we re-sign Hardy and Romo is still on the books by the time our O-Lineman are due for extensions, that's going to make it almost impossible to keep everyone we're going to want to keep."
cowboys,3drdie,smot,3,Sun Jul 19 00:18:28 2015 UTC,"I think our chances are low to medium because 1) We have invested in Lawrence and Gregory already, and Crawford is coming up for a re-sign. Our money may be spent better on other positions. 2) Marinelli is able to get the most out of basic defensive ends, so it might be a better value approach to let Hardy go and spend light money on a moldable player. With that said, I hope Hardy has a fantastic year and some desire to stay with the Cowboys beyond 2015."
cowboys,3drdie,josephbuttons,3,Sun Jul 19 00:30:17 2015 UTC,"Lately we've been locking up core guys for long term deals (Dez, Romo, Tyron) and other ""replaceable"" guys to 1 or 2 year deals (McClain, Hardy, DMC, etc).  I like how we aren't overreacting and handing out big time deals to guys that had one good year and then looking dumb when their production drops off (Marion Barber, Miles Austin). I'd say they consider Tyrone Crawford to be a core guy and want to get him long term sooner than later. I'm expecting a pro-bowl caliber year from Hardy and it wouldn't surprise me if the FO makes a move to keep him. He probably appreciates that Dallas took a ""risky"" shot at him when it seemed like no other team would. Total guess here but I could see him staying for 12-13 mil a year."

cowboys,3drdie,josephbuttons,2,Sat Jul 18 23:25:05 2015 UTC,"It's not really about chance, it's about priorities. If Lawrence and Gregory develop into the kinds of players they have the potential to become, then Dallas can have a great defensive line paying rookie contracts. In that case, there's probably no need to pay what Hardy would cost.   On the other hand, if Dallas's defense just doesn't work without him, and the FO thinks they have a real shot to repeat (cause, well, come on!) by keeping him around, then they'll make it work."
cowboys,3drdie,WallyMetropolis,2,Sat Jul 18 21:57:35 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. I see Greg Hardy as more of a bridge for Randy Gregory. Once Gregory gets his weight up and fine tunes his game, I don't think there is much of a need for Hardy.   However, there is that possibility that Hardy could move inside and play the 3 tech. If the Cowboys want to go that route, I think they do resign him at the right price."
cowboys,3drdie,Uncle_Tom1,2,Sun Jul 19 16:45:40 2015 UTC,If we win the super bowl i would let him walk too expensive

cowboys,3drdie,IDontShareMyOpinions,3,Mon Jul 20 14:29:20 2015 UTC,"Now that we have Dez back, zero. Hardy is a Super Bowl rental while DLaw, Gregory, and a couple of our other DLine projects are coached up. There is serious potential between all our young guys - and they're cheaper than the 16m+ per year that Hardy is worth if he gets back to where he was pre-DV accusation."
cowboys,3drdie,HiveNode,4,Sat Jul 18 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"Ya, here's hoping this rental's intensity and work ethic leave a lasting influence with the young guys."

It was so stupid when that story blew up, like, Hardy became an elite rusher because he busts his ass every fucking day. If he thinks Coleman is wasting his chance to make an impact in the NFL and tells him to suck it up then I'm all for it."
cowboys,3drdie,HiveNode,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:57:21 2015 UTC,You have to remember Hardy comes with alot of baggage. You can't expect to sign him and not hear anything from the media after what Dallas went through;  especially if he doesn't have a monster year. He'll be cheaper than people think..
cowboys,3drdie,fatboygixxer,2,Sat Jul 18 23:26:52 2015 UTC,"I hope that happens but, if he has a monster year there will be other teams that won't care. We'll see what happens."

cowboys,3dqmi1,kuntslayer,10,Sun Jul 19 19:24:58 2015 UTC,"My dad and my grandpa didnt get along. My grandpa was a Steelers fan so my dad become a Cowboys. This was LONG before i was born. I was born in 88, so due to that I grew up watching the 90's Cowboys. I kinda fell out of being interested in Football during school till around high school. I moved and meet some new friends and there were all into football.  SIDE STORY - I had cool Parents who let me and my friends drink and smoke weed at our house aslong as no one drove and all we did was drink and smoke.  So they needed a place to get fucked up and watch Football, I was new and trying to make friends so I offered my place. Growing up watching Football I knew all the rules and teams and what not but because my dad was a Dallas fan and I grew up watching Dallas that's who I went with whenever I was asked my favorite team. It wouldn't be long before I learned about our amazing history in the NFL.  Smash cut to 10 years later, my Dad has just got over beating cancer and is still kind of sickly but NOTHING gives him so much joy then good news about the Cowboys. I swear he was as excited as a little girl who just got a pony when Dez finally signed.  ""The 2nd Coming Of Irvin is here!"" - My Father about Dez Bryant  TBH I never once visited Dallas, never even been in Texas aside form changing flights in the Dallas airport but The Dallas Cowboys have been able to give me a relationship with my Father that he never had with his and for that reason I am and always will be a Dallas Cowboys fan."

So one Day my Dad got free Tickets and asked me if i wanted to come with him.  After that Game i started to learn more about Football and, of course, started watching the NFL. So in 2005 i just watched some Games and was looking for a favorite team, fast forward to 2006, a guy named Tony Romo got me to watch every Dallas Cowboys Game for the rest of the Season. So here i am Rooting for the Boys ever since. I'm actually building my own Cowboy family, my three nephews  love watching the ""Captain Cowboys"", as they call it, with me."

I waited months if not years for the bears to play live in my area so I could watch them(utah doent get much football coverage and my family was too poor for cable)  finally one Sunday the bears came onand I was so excited. they were playing the cowboys whom I knew little about at the time.  I watched that game in absolute AWE as the cowboys destroyed this team I had been waiting to watch. The sheer majesty of the cowboys command of the field was astonishing! that day triggered something in me I couldn't turn off.  ever since then I Drove/walked/skated anywhere I could to watch this team that rose above what at the time was my football world. They weren't just a team to root for. they WERE football!!! they are what made me fall in love with football.   Die hard fan ever since."

I have always looked up to him and it was something we both have that we can talk about on a daily basis. But since I was little it has transformed. But not it's a lot more than just that, I love their legacy (I'm not living in the past) I love the swagger that comes with the players. From what I have also heard is the Cowboys reporters on their website get away with a lot more than most of teams. They can pretty much do and say what they want. It's cool to have such a realistic prospective. They just carry their self in a different way than every other team."

Because of that he would frequently get free tickets to the games and became a big fan of the Cowboys.  My dad, who was born in 59, became a fan through my grandfather and passed the love of the team down to me.  I started paying attention to the team in 1990, when I was 9.  Before that I hadn't really cared and all I knew about the Cowboys was that when the game was on, I didn't talk, I didn't walk in front of the TV, and my dad and uncle would be screaming.  In 90 I watched a few games.  At the end of the season the Cowboys needed another team to win so that they could make the playoffs (Seattle I think?) I remember watching that other game and finally feeling a strong desire for something good to happen for the Cowboys and knowing disappointment when it didn't happen.  Even though my dad said the Cowboys didn't deserve to get into the playoffs, didn't deserve to back in, I could tell he was disappointed also.  That was a moment of bonding and we've watched the team together ever since."

I live next to DC and Philly. I could've switched at any time during the season, but I didn't.

We had no hockey team, but our soccer team (which made the playoffs every year) had to practice in the grass next to the bus loop while the football team (which sucked ass every year) took up all four fields. So, I hated all things football for years and years. In 2009 I moved in with a buddy and he was a huge Cowboys fan. It had been a few years since I left high school, so I wasn't pissed off at all things football anymore, and his passion for football was infectious. That alone got me interested in the Cowboys, but the kick-ass Cowboys parties we would throw pushed me over the edge into being a full blown cowboys fan. We built a 17 foot projection screen, set it up in the backyard, and put the projector on the roof. We hardly told anybody about it. Neighbors would just poke their heads over the fence and through the gate and see the set-up. Before we knew it, we would have 30 people sitting in the backyard. After the game we would play Madden on that bad boy. Good times. Also, one of my best friends has a cousin that plays for the Packers. So, I get it from that angle too.

Wasn't old enough to experience our Super Bowl days, but it's 10 years now watching this team and went to my first NFL game last fall, in Dallas. Best experience ever being there with more than 5 other Cowboy fans in one room for the first time."

cowboys,3dqmi1,tiagom0702,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:07:07 2015 UTC,"I am Portuguese and football isn't yet a big thing in Portugal. However, the Super Bowl is always broadcasted on cable over here and in 2011 I have decided to give it a shot. It was the Green Bay Packers against Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl at our stadium. I remember the commenter explaining the rules as the game progressed. I was in love by the sport and the game ended at 3 am here at Portugal and I had to go to college next day for lectures but I simply couldn't go to sleep. I went online searching for the whole rules so I could have better knowledge than that acquired by watching one game. As soon as I ended reading the rules I started reading the history of NFL and all 32 teams history too. I remember the Cowboys was the last team I read about but it was my favorite. I was astonished with Roger Staubach, Tom Landry, Jerry Jones, Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Deion Sanders. I knew it was my favorite team and I became a fan. I started to watch 3 to 4 games every week in the 2011 season and football became my favorite sport despite I'm a semi professional soccer referee here at Europe and the fact I love FC Barcelona. Now I am a 23 years old Portuguese that absolutely loves football and the Cowboys that is waiting for the 6th Super Bowl! Let's get it done lads, this has to be the year!"

We seemed to get more Cowboys games on TV so that probably had the most to do with it. It was a dream come true when my employer moved me to Dallas and we lived through the 80's/90's with some of those dominating teams. Moved away but really depressed when the Cowboys announced they were moving their headquarters to the town I lived in while in Texas! Oh, the fun that would have been!"
cowboys,3dqmi1,EL_Senor_Guapo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:22 2015 UTC,I'm a child of the 80s and grew up watching the Cowboys win titles in the 90s.  Being 10 years old and no one else watching sports in my house I picked the Cowboys but have stuck with them the past 22 years. I'm a weird Philly hybrid where once I picked the Cowboys I picked all Philly teams for the other sports a few years later since I grew up in that area.   I always get shit for this but I feel picking a sports team is permanent..  would it be easier to be a eagle's fan..sure but I'm way to emotionally invested in the boys.   The moral of the story is we all take different roads to get here and even if you get on the bus with a bandwagon ticket.. it's ok as you never get off
cowboys,3dqmi1,Von_Skyhawk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:07 2015 UTC,"Born in Dallas. Moved around after the 92 Superbowl and ended up in DC. So many people up here think that once you've spent the majority of your life outside of Dallas, you're no longer a ""real fan""."

cowboys,3dpumw,Meatmuskett,19,Sat Jul 18 07:39:04 2015 UTC,"The difference is Romo plays for the Cowboys. The Packers are really likable, with their goofy cheeseheads and down home Midwestern sensibilities. The Cowboys are seen as corporate and arrogant. If Romo wins a Super Bowl, the narrative will be how he came out of nowhere after a career of being a bumbling failure to win a Super Bowl.   TL;DR: The media is dumb and they should feel bad"
cowboys,3dpumw,jlacomb17,2,Sat Jul 18 13:32:53 2015 UTC,No one worth citing calls Romo a bumbling failure.

cowboys,3dpxyw,NotDrGiggleFairies,4,Sat Jul 18 16:36:51 2015 UTC,Lucky Whitehead. Hehas the best chance with his special teams play

cowboys,3dpxyw,daemon616,-4,Sun Jul 19 02:10:14 2015 UTC,I like Antwan Goodley over Lucky Whitehead. We signed Danny McCray to be our returner and Antwan Goodley is a better receiver. He's big and fast.
cowboys,3dpxyw,Runna4life,3,Sat Jul 18 12:58:57 2015 UTC,"Danny McCray has never returned a kick or punt in his 5 year career. I doubt they signed him to return kicks. They probably signed him to cover kicks. I think Beasley is gonna return kicks, personally."
cowboys,3dpxyw,jlacomb17,3,Sat Jul 18 13:29:01 2015 UTC,I hope. That's a real shifty dude and he rarely gets absolutely tagged on a tackle. Only time I can think of was the Detroit game over the middle.
cowboys,3dpxyw,DALcowboys,2,Sat Jul 18 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"To me, he's the perfect return man."
cowboys,3dpxyw,jlacomb17,2,Sat Jul 18 13:39:19 2015 UTC,Beasley is far too valuable to return kicks. They'll send out Street before Bease.
cowboys,3dpxyw,HiveNode,3,Sat Jul 18 15:48:18 2015 UTC,My guess is Dunbar is gonna be the guy taking kicks.
cowboys,3dpxyw,Von_Skyhawk,2,Sat Jul 18 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"Kickoffs, at least. I still see another guy doing punts, could even be a guy like Wilcox."
cowboys,3dpxyw,gdaman22,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:09:17 2015 UTC,Wilcox is too valuable as well. Criminally underrated around these parts.
cowboys,3dpxyw,HiveNode,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:11:48 2015 UTC,How? The only reason his stat line isn't awful is because he's playing 25 yards deep off the snap.
cowboys,3dpxyw,gdaman22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:27:07 2015 UTC,"He does a good job in coverage, and has lost weight this offseason. Just weight, you'll be celebrating Wilcox in a few months."
cowboys,3dpxyw,HiveNode,2,Sun Jul 19 00:30:26 2015 UTC,"I love Beasley as much as the next guy, but he is our fourth target on offense. People act like making him the punt returner automatically means he will get injured. Teams make good players punt returners for a reason. Is Julian Edelman not too valuable to the Patriots? Is Antonio Brown not too valuable to the Steelers?"
cowboys,3dpxyw,jlacomb17,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:16:49 2015 UTC,I think they're paying him too much to be a returner.
cowboys,3dpxyw,Runna4life,0,Sat Jul 18 14:10:14 2015 UTC,I think they're paying him too much to be a returner.
cowboys,3dpxyw,Runna4life,3,Sat Jul 18 14:10:15 2015 UTC,He's also gonna be their slot receiver.
cowboys,3dpxyw,jlacomb17,3,Sat Jul 18 14:40:35 2015 UTC,Danny McCray as a returner? No way.
cowboys,3dphf9,tiretred,9,Sat Jul 18 04:49:21 2015 UTC,"The difference is that our 2007 team relied on the big play far too much, which was ultimately our downfall since it only worked 13/17 games in that season. The 2014 (and soon 2015) Cowboys rely on grinding down the field and taking the big shot when it's available. I know it technically worked less than our 2007 offense, but, it'll beat defenses more consistently since it's less about their mistakes and more about our skill."
cowboys,3dphf9,HiveNode,7,Sat Jul 18 05:00:27 2015 UTC,When I see them grind the ball this year I'll be totally on board with you.
cowboys,3dphf9,HiveNode,4,Sat Jul 18 05:02:41 2015 UTC,I don't think we need one great back to do the job. 3 or 4 good ones should be fine IMO.

cowboys,3dphf9,ReMiCkS_25,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:22:59 2015 UTC,I'd be fine with that. I think our receiving group will be even better this year as well as Tony having a full offseason to prepare.
cowboys,3dphf9,SuperKerfuz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:24:33 2015 UTC,"could not agree more, as long as we have the same approach as last year which is controlling TOP with running the ball and being able to get first downs un 3 or less running plays I will be happy. Leaning on tony to throw the ball 30 times a game will not work."
cowboys,3dphf9,flipmangoflip,3,Sat Jul 18 18:05:06 2015 UTC,"To counter your points, what about our defense? I think you could argue that they rely on big plays at crucial moments. They forced a lot of turnovers, which is a stat that varies from year to year."
cowboys,3dphf9,zsxecorp,2,Sat Jul 18 16:35:42 2015 UTC,I really feel like our defense got their act together at the end of last season. That plus everyone we have signed this off season. I have a feeling they're going to blow away everyone's expectations.
cowboys,3dphf9,lucusmarcus,6,Sat Jul 18 17:19:30 2015 UTC,"I think this team has more depth overall than in 2008. Also, the OL in 2008 wasn't imposing and Terrell Owens had a drastic decline. I think the culture is different. Though still grounded, this is the most excited I have been about this team in over 20 years. I think the offense can be top 5 in points and I think the defense can be top 10 in points allowed. Barring any barrage of catastrophic injuries. I think the formula is there for a championship run. All we can do is be hopeful and watch."
cowboys,3dphf9,jlacomb17,3,Sat Jul 18 06:36:49 2015 UTC,Culture is correct answer
cowboys,3dphf9,protoplast,7,Sat Jul 18 13:15:56 2015 UTC,"Most people I know, including myself, saw 2007 as kind of flukey. That was the year they had to win it. Wade wasn't a good coach, the offense was reliant on the big play, and the defense was shaky in situations where they had to make a stop. Last year just seemed like we were one year ahead of a schedule that really seems to be working. This team is building, that team was holding on."
cowboys,3dphf9,DemonSpeed,2,Sat Jul 18 13:35:42 2015 UTC,I agree that we are so much better coached now.
cowboys,3dphf9,RomoSpinMove,0,Tue Jul 21 12:52:07 2015 UTC,I truly think that's the difference but I've been burned before so I'm very cautiously optimistic.

Don't get me wrong, I love his voice, I love his excitement and his sometimes sarcastic remarks.  However, I feel like there are so many times in a game where he gives so little detail that I don't have a clear picture of what is happening.  There are a lot of calls that go ""Romo back to pass, Witten makes the grab.""  And then we have to wait 30 seconds for the next play to find out what yard line they're on and whether or not they made a first.   I will admit that it's especially infuriating for me because I'm big into fantasy football and I'd really like to know that my running back gained 7 yards and not have to wait for that information."

cowboys,3dmgl3,emackn,7,Fri Jul 17 15:25:12 2015 UTC,"I was at this game. It was my first ever Cowboys game. I sat on the side opposite the catch. At first I thought he dropped it, it didn't seem possibly he could have pulled that in for the score. Next thing I know, the other half of the stadium erupted in cheers. I was sitting around mostly other Cowboys fans who let out a collective sigh. I remember thinking ""this is my first game, and this happens"", when we finally won I was never so excited in my entire life."

cowboys,3dmgl3,Leonbethyname,4,Fri Jul 17 13:55:12 2015 UTC,"Was a great catch, done with it.  G-men lost.    With that said; I'm actually surprised that there hasn't been an effort to change the gloves WR's are allowed wear.  The tacky rubberized or whatever material that's used on the gloves make catches like this 'easier'.  Just not as ugly as stickum, so i guess its OK."
cowboys,3dmgl3,emackn,5,Fri Jul 17 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"If it increases the scoring, the current NFL will let it happen."

cowboys,3dmgl3,jswilson64,3,Fri Jul 17 17:10:06 2015 UTC,"It's the only thing that makes sense, right?  It's like when MLB prostituted itself to steroids to increase revenue.  Cowboys have been beneficiaries, too--I remember several catches in the playoffs that clearly were, if not caused by, at least heavily influenced by gloves.  Eventually baseball always seems to get it act together--it banned sticky on bats, banned steroids.  But I'm not so sure the NFL ever will."
cowboys,3dmgl3,mushpuppy,2,Fri Jul 17 16:07:57 2015 UTC,"I think an AFL level competition is the only thing that is going to prevent the NFL from becoming a bloated, uncontrollable good ol' boys network (more so than it already is.) Eventually, the popularity will wane if they continue making rules just for the sake of making rules and allowing anything that increases scoring. The market has been prime for competition for a while now. The competitor would just have to do it right, like the USFL (before Trump.)"

Take away the context of them losing the game and all that other shiet.  It's the catch itself that will never be repeated.

cowboys,3dktud,Leonbethyname,15,Fri Jul 17 02:09:30 2015 UTC,Crawford deserves to be paid and Dallas would be smart to pay him now and not after the monster season he is about to have. Then again top defensive tackles make around 4m a season so it wouldn't kill the cap if they waited
cowboys,3dktud,InconditeMudlark,4,Fri Jul 17 02:12:59 2015 UTC,"Crawford would make more than that, considering he knows he is the most important player on the defense in our particular scheme. I mean, he wouldn't be a bank-breaking 13m a year DLaw, but it's still a significant cap hit we can avoid by paying him now."
cowboys,3dktud,HiveNode,8,Fri Jul 17 02:15:04 2015 UTC,"He isn't going to get paid more than a top 5 DT in the league. He has like >5 career sacks. He has enormous potential, but he won't be getting paid 5 million a year. That'd be ridiculous."
cowboys,3dktud,Drugs_and_Hugs,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:18:57 2015 UTC,"it's still a significant cap hit we can avoid by paying him now.   Yes, let's sign him now, before he (or his agent) figures out how free agency works."
cowboys,3dktud,ocr1,12,Fri Jul 17 02:39:51 2015 UTC,"Don't be a cunt. Some players prefer to play it safe and take the deal on the table. Plenty of players have bet on themselves and lost a lot of money on that bet, plenty have taken the safe deal and outplayed their contract. It's simply a matter of how a player wants to handle himself."

cowboys,3dktud,WalrusRider,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:44:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, but Scandrick did deserve his new deal, which I still think is a great one for us. He's locked up through the rest of his best years, and that's all I care about. If Crawford outplayed his next deal and wanted a high paid extension for another 2-3 years I'd be totally fine with that."
cowboys,3dktud,HiveNode,-2,Fri Jul 17 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"You don't have to call people cunts.  It's a good idea to take the money, a player could do something like rupture his achilles on the first day of camp going into a contract year and never see that kind of money.   However, he knows what he's worth, he's not going to take less just because he's signing an extension instead of a new deal."
cowboys,3dktud,ocr1,-1,Fri Jul 17 03:22:47 2015 UTC,"He doesn't know what he's worth, actually. He already missed a season due to a torn ACL, and after a player tears an ACL it becomes more prone to being torn again. How does he know it won't happen again this season and cause him to lose out on millions?  Also: ;_;"

cowboys,3dktud,Von_Skyhawk,14,Fri Jul 17 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"Right under them? For a guy with 3 career sacks (though a fuckton of potential), he's a bit father than 'right under them'. Suh's contract was galactic, so I can't expect Crawford to be anywhere close to his."
cowboys,3dktud,jeremy_280,5,Fri Jul 17 03:28:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like we live in crazy town where everyone who plays for us is a ""monster"" and all the fans are over-valuing even our backup punter at this point.

cowboys,3dktud,HiveNode,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:39:09 2015 UTC,Well we sure as hell aren't gonna pay him like that without substantial reasoning to and his current resume on PAPER doesn't come close and the agent knows that's what matters.
cowboys,3dktud,nokarmawhore,3,Fri Jul 17 15:44:19 2015 UTC,"Suh is a monster that can play 1 and 3 tech as well as any position on a 3-4 line, so of course he got handsomely paid. Gerald McCoy makes roughly 8m a year on his deal, which is why I want to get Crawford signed for 4-5m a year ASAP."

I'd try and sign him now to a reasonable deal like 4yr/ 20 mil. We'd be overpaying if you only look at sacks, which is all anyone looks at in the media but that'd be more than a fair price for him which might sway him from waiting to be a FA.  List of current DT contracts"
cowboys,3dktud,sleepyCOLLEGEstudent,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:42:08 2015 UTC,Crawford only had 3 sacks last year
cowboys,3dktud,Drearian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:33:41 2015 UTC,"Looking at those numbers, I think his agent would want a per year salary between Kyle Williams and Arthur Jones. There's a huge gap between those two contracts, and I think Crawford has shown he's better than the contracts at 5m/year, but not as good as the 10m+/year players."
cowboys,3dktud,Von_Skyhawk,0,Fri Jul 17 18:55:18 2015 UTC,Exactly
cowboys,3dktud,HiveNode,3,Fri Jul 17 12:20:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not inclined to believe he'll take a deal. If he has a pro-bowl season, he could command big money, and eliminating him as an option makes it much, much easier to squeeze in Hardy. It's possible to have both I guess, but it would involve some best case scenarios. We'll pick one or the other next year. Logically, Crawford makes more sense, since we're sort of flush with young DEs, but Hardy can also work inside. He's also more of a known entity, at least right now, but neither are especially proven at this precise moment, since Hardy's been off the field and Crawford only has the 1 season.  If we could get him for like 4-6 for a few years right now, I say go for it, but we just don't know enough about our D line. D Law and Gregory's progress is going to influence how we approach signing Hardy again, and Crawford's still got something to prove. I've said it before and I'll say it again: D Law balling out is the best thing that could happen to us roster wise this year. Ditch Hardy and have a real solid tandem with him and Groggy, then pick Crawford back up and we got us a D-Line for a good long time. We can go with a first round CB/S in 2016 and probably a replacement for Ro. If we pick Hardy back up, we still probably do this, but our interior line becomes a real weak spot, with Hayden and maybe a rookie, or one of the depth DTs that have been pretty underwhelming."
cowboys,3dktud,MastaSpoofa,3,Fri Jul 17 02:56:09 2015 UTC,"I doubt he has any interest in signing an extension right now. If he knows what's good for him, he'll play out this season and ask for big money. That's assuming he's as productive as everyone expects, of course."
cowboys,3dktud,drywater,0,Fri Jul 17 03:25:35 2015 UTC,"The only reason it's even a question/theory is because he has already missed a season due to a serious injury (torn ACL). It's like Murray last year in a way; Murray missed 3 or so games every season up until his contract year in which we low-balled him before the season started. He bet on his injury-prone self, which could have easily backfired, but he won that bet.   Will Crawford be that lucky? Does he believe he will be that lucky? It's up to his personality, really."
cowboys,3dktud,NotMattWong,3,Fri Jul 17 04:53:32 2015 UTC,He tore his Achilles not his ACL.
cowboys,3dktud,jlacomb17,2,Fri Jul 17 15:46:28 2015 UTC,Which actually makes a huge difference.
cowboys,3dktud,jlacomb17,2,Fri Jul 17 16:58:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe we should wait for him to put up some better numbers. Sure his price may be higher, but I'd rather pay a premium price for proven results rather than try to lock down someone that may not pan out. He's had 3 sacks in his entire career. Sure he can pressure the qb but he needs to reach them before they can make a play. He shows flashes of skill but it may be early. I'd rather wait to see how hardy pans out and offer him and Rolando extensions since we know they can impact the team in a bigger way."
cowboys,3dktud,cowboyup12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:45:46 2015 UTC,"If this was baseball and contracts were guaranteed, I would agree with you. But in a world of non-guaranteed, salary cap driven contracts, I would want to sign a guy with potential before he puts up big numbers, so you can afford to sign everyone else when their contracts are up. It's a smart, albeit risky move that could pay off huge."
cowboys,3dkbw6,RickSmith123,31,Thu Jul 16 23:32:30 2015 UTC,No question and he will be first ballot. His character has set him above the rest.
cowboys,3dkbw6,hllywdcurbstomp,9,Thu Jul 16 23:55:25 2015 UTC,"His character has set him above the rest.    Great point. The NFL loves a great role model and you couldn't ask for a better one in Witten. I think first ballot is debatable, but he's in for sure."
cowboys,3dkbw6,Von_Skyhawk,8,Thu Jul 16 23:58:56 2015 UTC,Well you kind have to think about who would go with him. Don't they take 6 guys a year?
cowboys,3dkbw6,hllywdcurbstomp,3,Fri Jul 17 00:04:39 2015 UTC,"They take seven, I think. The article brings up a good point that TE's aren't really a priority in Canton, so he might have to wait. I think we'll have to wait and see how long it takes Goatzalez to get in. Sharpe didn't have to wait long though and Witten is definitely the better TE."
cowboys,3dkbw6,Von_Skyhawk,6,Fri Jul 17 00:10:02 2015 UTC,How long it will take Gonzalez to get in? He will be a 1st ballot HOF'er. He is 5th all time in yards and only 165 yards from being 3rd. 2nd all time in receptions. 6th all time in TD's. I would bet any amount of money he will be in the first year he is eligible.
cowboys,3dkbw6,mattw3344,5,Fri Jul 17 00:55:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. I can't imagine him not being first ballot. I guess we'll see in 2018."
cowboys,3dkbw6,Von_Skyhawk,7,Fri Jul 17 01:02:42 2015 UTC,Never have I hated but respected an NFL player more than this guy. If he doesn't make it on the first ballot then the whole HOF should be ashamed.
cowboys,3dkbw6,hashsview,5,Fri Jul 17 13:51:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. Probably not first ballot, but I do believe he's got a spot in Canton.  EDIT: I didn't even realize this was a link. I just answered the question."
cowboys,3dkbw6,Von_Skyhawk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:52:35 2015 UTC,you take that back. He is a first ballot all day.
cowboys,3dkbw6,ReMiCkS_25,4,Fri Jul 17 15:13:44 2015 UTC,Hes the king of 3rd down=first down.  I think he's in there eventually.  Probably not first ballot but he deserves to be in there.  Has exuded nothing but class since in the league and has been extremely consistent throughout his career
cowboys,3dkbw6,lurker2080,3,Fri Jul 17 00:47:35 2015 UTC,"I think currently only Tony Gonzalez could claim to be a more hall of fame worthy TE, of those who played in this century. Maaaaaybe Gates... Gronk may get there, I don't think graham will."
cowboys,3dkbw6,oskie6,2,Fri Jul 17 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"No, although he should be, he has to retire and wait 5 years."
cowboys,3dkbw6,E-Man67,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:36:49 2015 UTC,"Witten certainly is a Hall of Famer. It's just basically if he's first ballot of not like many have said. An interesting discussion would be who gets in first between Witten and Ware. Both are pretty much going to make it, and both played mostly on the same teams. Ware probably has a bit of a bigger name and at a position that the Hall favors, but Witten could be higher in terms of stats at his respective position when it's all said and done."
cowboys,3dkbw6,BoogTKE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:49:43 2015 UTC,"Ring on Honor, instantly.  However, I think a ring is needed to get him in the Hall early.  I'm sure he will get in eventually, but it will be years after he retires unless he gets that ring or improves his TD numbers.  His character, longevity, and talent will be something the league wants to honor in the Hall I'm just not sure he will have to wait."
cowboys,3dkbw6,Von_Skyhawk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think a ring is going to matter as much for a tight ends future in the HoF. I doubt he waits more than 10 years after he retires."

cowboys,3dkbw6,Hadriagh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:53:55 2015 UTC,I found it strange that the article focused 100% on receiving stats when a large part of a TE's job is pass protection and run blocking as well.  Witten happens to do a fantastic job at both of those and there's no doubt in my mind he's a future hall of famer.

cowboys,3djqhg,Geohalbert,-10,Fri Jul 17 05:08:45 2015 UTC,Roc Nation got lots of shit from Cowboy fans but they are the reason Dez ultimately got the deal done because the Jones trusted them with Dez.
cowboys,3djqhg,Washington_Fitz,7,Thu Jul 16 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you are being downvoted, you are right. Jerry mentioned Jay-Z in the phone call but he also had plenty to say in a seperate phone call to Dallas:   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones spoke glowingly of the work done by the folks at Roc Nation on Wednesday.  “I must emphasize, Roc Nation, Jay-Z, the key people in Roc Nation did a marvelous job of convincing us that managing Dez and managing him with his off the field, with his marketing opportunities, with his finances, that they’re a group that will really make a contribution to Dez,” Jerry Jones said during a Wednesday conference call. “They were very significant in us doing this deal with Dez.”  “They sold me on their commitment to have an associate in Dez that makes them proud, that makes Dez proud to be associated with them, and that makes Roc Nation proud,” Jerry Jones said. “I see that. I see they have a lot to gain and a lot to lose by giving good advice and by helping not only athletes but having entertainers reach their goals and, if you will, keep the money they earn. They’re good at it. They have the perfect textbook. It’s called their book. So they’re good at it. They’re genuine at it and I’m very, very impressed.”   During a Thursday morning radio interview on 105.3 The Fan [KRLD-FM], the Cowboys owner told the New School show that Jay-Z was not personally involved with the contract negotiations, but he was involved with the “painting of the picture of off the field decisions.”   “That’s where Jay-Z is such an example,” Jerry Jones said. “The main thing is that people listen to him. Dez listens to him. Dez will listen to him. Why? We all should listen to him, he’s had tremendous success apart from being a great talent.”"
cowboys,3djqhg,IYIENACE,2,Fri Jul 17 01:19:23 2015 UTC,Damn I've been hard on Roc Nation but that just changed my mind.

cowboys,3djqhg,laidback88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:30:08 2015 UTC,But RocNation doesn't represent Dez in contract negotiations. Tom Condon does.   RocNation was there talking about how they would work with Dez in managing his finances and himself off the field.
cowboys,3djqhg,Doctor_Worm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely true. Kim Miale, who's employed by Roc Nation, is co-representing Dez and collaborating with Tom Condon in contract negotations - here's an example of how it worked with Hakeem Nicks:   She did most of the background work,” Condon said. “Looking at the teams and making the determination of which teams would have a need [for a wide receiver], what their salary cap situation looked like.” He said that they shared the work of contacting the teams and doing the deal and that he was impressed with her smarts.   Ari Nissim also works for Roc Nation and is involved in the background, he previously did a 7-year stint at New York Jets and negotiated over a $1 billion in player and coaching contracts."
cowboys,3djqhg,AdolfGoodell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:58:13 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but Condon still takes lead on contract negotiations with teams and Miale takes lead on endorsement deals.

cowboys,3djqhg,laidback88,-7,Tue Jul 21 12:56:50 2015 UTC,Sure but the reason they feel comfortable giving him the huge guarantees which led to the contract being signed is they trust them.  People kept saying Roc Nation was going to ruin the deal when in fact they helped it the most probably.

cowboys,3dj2re,HiveNode,2,Thu Jul 16 18:06:10 2015 UTC,haha. #5 wr most mostly about returner
cowboys,3dj2re,lucusmarcus,2,Thu Jul 16 18:10:11 2015 UTC,"If Collins is still the player everyone thought he was pre-draft, he should be able to win this position battle without too much trouble.    I disagree. Leary is an elite run blocker who can handle power in the pass game but has a little trouble with guys who move well and have length. In order for Collins to win the job he has to show his pass blocking is better than Leary but also not be a big drop off in the run game. That's asking a lot from a rookie LT who has played LG to move back inside his rookie season."
cowboys,3dj2re,itsaboat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:33:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I honestly don't even think there's much competition at all. Leary has proven he can handle elite players like JJ Watt. Collins has lots to learn.
cowboys,3dj2re,drywater,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"I'm interested to see how Collins handles the RT spot(they've worked him there as well so far) and if he could replace Free. Granted, I think Collins is expected to be a backup this year and be Leary's replacement next year. Leary's only on a one year deal, and I'm betting he gets a nice big payday from some other team next off-season."
cowboys,3dj2re,lordjollygreen,2,Thu Jul 16 21:47:48 2015 UTC,Dez vs Jones. I want to see that and how good Jones can get being matched up on the best receiver in the NFL. Especially in the red zone
cowboys,3dj2re,FlyMolo_A,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:26 2015 UTC,Also Jones vs. Beasley. I want to see how he does against quick players even if he doesn't actually play the slot much.

cowboys,3dj2re,lucusmarcus,2,Thu Jul 16 19:58:55 2015 UTC,luckily most of them are for backup positions. not including RB of course. How is Ryan Williams the most talented but has been on practice squad?
cowboys,3dj2re,lucusmarcus,2,Thu Jul 16 18:00:44 2015 UTC,I'm assuming it's because of injuries
cowboys,3dj2re,tash3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:32 2015 UTC,Was last year his first year with Dallas?
cowboys,3dj2re,lucusmarcus,2,Thu Jul 16 18:47:31 2015 UTC,Yes
cowboys,3dj2re,tash3r,2,Thu Jul 16 19:34:07 2015 UTC,I also just remembered that one of the main reasons he didn't make the team last year was because he wasn't good on special teams.
cowboys,3dj2re,tash3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"yea, if you're not starting you gotta do special teams."
cowboys,3dj2re,lucusmarcus,2,Thu Jul 16 19:51:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I had to chuckle at that one. How's a dude that hasn't finished a full season the most talented back on the team? I get potential and I get he's had injuries but we have game tape of the other backs on in the team.

cowboys,3dirlt,NJknick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:50:47 2015 UTC,"That was my first question.   It also depends a lot on how camp/the season plays out. Are Randle, McFadden, Dunbar and Williams in a neck-to-neck-to-neck-to-neck race to see who is first to break 1000 yards? Or does Dallas really miss Murray?  Is Bradford lighting up the league, living up to his potential in the fast paced offense? Or was he injured in week 2, Sanchez is wearing a baseball cap, Tebow is ready to take the field, and Barkley is warming up his arm?"

cowboys,3dirlt,tiamdi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:14:35 2015 UTC,"Yea, you have to be able to trust your defense at some point. Philly can definitely get down the field in less than a minute and a half. But that means DeMarco is likely not going to be running the ball. They will be passing it with Bradford, who is throwing to Matthews and Angholor. I'll take my chances there.   If you go for it with our unproven running game then you are risking the game right there. Not to mention that there is no guarantee of getting to the end zone. And you might end up having to kick a FG anyways. You always take the points if they ensure you'll be winning."
cowboys,3dirlt,Drugs_and_Hugs,8,Fri Jul 17 13:27:11 2015 UTC,"Kick the field goal and play defense. It's the NFL not madden. You always have to play conservative in this league. Imagine the ""fire garret"" backlash if you go for it and fail."

cowboys,3dirlt,jmlives27,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:32:27 2015 UTC,"Dude, you can't take a timeout in the middle of the play lol. If you're play call doesn't work then it's turnover on downs."
cowboys,3dirlt,Drugs_and_Hugs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:29:24 2015 UTC,...before the snap obviously. Tony would be reading the defense. You can tell if they play tight pre snap
cowboys,3dirlt,jmlives27,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yea, I kind of misread that. But I doubt the CBs would play off at all considering its 4th and 1. 99% chance they are jamming at the line."

cowboys,3deyqk,zbaile1074,2,Wed Jul 15 19:20:32 2015 UTC,"honestly, I don't think the linked story is that much better than the tweet.

cowboys,3deyqk,sportsteambfan,2,Wed Jul 15 19:50:14 2015 UTC,"It's easy to get wrapped up in the whole ""internet points"" of it, but it just comes down to crappy moderating.  You can't delete someone's post, post something similar, and never message him an explanation.  And now the thread of comments above has been deleted with no response or explanation.  It's not something worth rioting over, but it definitely lowered my opinion of the mods here (or at least of /u/itsaboat).  I mean, how long would they have to wait for an article link to the story to be submitted?  Check out /r/cowboys/new, the sub is plenty active during big stories.  If you're going to remove a user's post in favor of a better but later one, at least let it be another user's, if only for propriety's sake."

cowboys,3di4cb,aaronclements,2,Fri Jul 17 12:51:44 2015 UTC,No slight to Tony as I love the dude. However after Dez signed that fat contract. It better be him this year.
cowboys,3dnbme,Kingdariush,11,Fri Jul 17 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"Eh why not.   The Cowboys' offensive line is massively overrated. Their pass blocking can definitely improve, but I don't really think it matters what it's ""rated"". Many signs point to the unit getting better next year which is great, and I can't wait. I don't think most Cowboys fans particularly care if it's overrated if they're as good or better than last year. The Cowboys are indeed going to miss DeMarco Murray. Sure, I'm not expecting the Cowboys to have the same running game as they did last year. But it's okay. I have no problem with Romo throwing the ball a bit more. I don't buy the belief that he had a career season solely because ""they took the ball out of his hands."" It helps but Romo will still, I think, have close to a career-best season again.  The Cowboys haven't been able to get to the quarterback. Last year yeah, but they get DeMarcus Lawrence (who as a rookie barely participated in any training camp last year and was out most of the season), Greg Hardy, Randy Gregory, a now definite 3-tech tackle in Crawford (he says it's helped his off season preparation substantially knowing where he's playing). The sacks will come. Sean Lee's soft tissue is made out of dandelions and papier-mâché. It would be hard to disagree but remember that he had been playing in the NFL with a partially torn ACL and that is believed to have helped cause all the other injuries. I wouldn't bet on Lee not getting injured, but I'm cautiously optimistic about his health. He's had a long time to rehab.  Tony Romo DID have a pair of back surgeries in 2013. If he made it through last year, I'm not worried about this year. It's his first regular offseason in three years and Romo says he feels great. The Cowboys don't have a competent backup quarterback. I'd lose all hope if Romo went down anyway. The Cowboys have to play the Seahawks and Packers, and the rest of the NFC East doesn't. Dallas will hopefully have to play them at one point anyway. ""Super Bowl contenders"" shouldn't let a couple harder games stop them from winning the division.  Jason Witten is old. I have yet to see any sign of him slowing down. His receptions can stay ""low"" for all I care if his blocking keeps being so outstanding.  The Cowboys pay their corners a lot for very little. The secondary is definitely Dallas' biggest weakness. The salary argument is dumb IMO. They have like $13M in cap room or something around there. The addition of Byron Jones and an improved pass rush should help a lot.  The Cowboys' defense still isn't good. It was nearly good enough for a deep playoff run last year. A vastly improved pass rush, Byron Jones, a possibly Pro-Bowl level 3-tech (very important in Marinelli's defense) and Sean Lee's return (plays the Will LB spot, also very important in Marinelli's defense). Have me very optimistic about this season.   So I guess some points are valid, but every team always has weaknesses going into a season, and others that come up as the season goes on. However, while still being cautious about my optimism about the upcoming season, I haven't been this excited for a season in a long time."
cowboys,3dnbme,drywater,3,Fri Jul 17 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, even though Lee has missed a ton of games, he still leads the league in interceptions by a LB."
cowboys,3dnbme,fartsandpoops,4,Sat Jul 18 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"The Cowboys have to play the Seahawks and Packers, and the rest of the NFC East doesn't.    Haha that's funny. We beat the Seahawks and were an overturned catch away from beating the Packers. How did you guys do against Green Bay? 55-20? I'm expecting the Lions to blow out the Eagles on Thanksgiving and the Cardinals to stomp on those fucks next season...as usual."

cowboys,3dnbme,drywater,2,Fri Jul 17 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah no problem, figured you were actually curious how legit these points are."
cowboys,3dnbme,BleedingBlue44,21,Fri Jul 17 20:06:45 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the classic eagles article trashing the cowboys.   ""Defense is bad""... Season has NOT started yet. Defense was fine last year and only going to be better with the new additions that we made, plus injured players returning (Hardy, Lee, Lawrence, Gregory). The d-line will also help the pass coverage as quarterbacks will likely have less time to pick us apart.   Can't get to the qb? Once again, our new d-line has yet to play a game.   We know Sean Lee is fragile, but we were pretty good without him last year. When he is on the field, he can be a game changer.   Romo's surgeries happened in 2013.. It's 2015. He had a hell of a season last year and is the healthiest he has been in a while.   I can't believe anyone would even think that the cowboys would struggle with a tight end.  Witten may be declining in production, but I'll take him on a 3rd down all day long. He doesn't need to have Gronk numbers to be productive for us.   The o-line is not overrated. Yes they gave up sacks last year and have room for pass protection improvement, but to say that they are overrated for that is false. They are damn good in run blocking and will only improve with a year under their belt together.   Dallas will miss Murray, but all of cowboys nation won't miss those fumbles.   Forgot this: FUCK THE EAGLES!"
cowboys,3dnbme,nomnomnompizza,5,Fri Jul 17 18:36:14 2015 UTC,They are trying to justify signing Murray for such a big contract by saying it was him and not the o-line.
cowboys,3dnbme,jlacomb17,4,Fri Jul 17 22:34:27 2015 UTC,Completely agree. The Witten one kind of blew my mind. His EPA (expected points added) per play was the highest of his career last year: http://www.advancedfootballanalytics.com/index.php/offensive-player-page/index.php?playerid=82-J.Witten&season=all&pos=TE . The reason his numbers are down is because this offense is stacked and we don't have to throw to him 15 times a game like we used to. He is as good as he's ever been. And he's only 33. It's not like he's 37 or 38.
cowboys,3dnbme,Dcowboys09,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:48 2015 UTC,People act like Romo needs a walker. He had a cyst removed. Go to /r/popping it's no big deal.  Not fucking back surgery.

cowboys,3dnbme,A_Trustworthy_Pear,-9,Sat Jul 18 07:13:41 2015 UTC,"Dallas will miss Murray, but all of cowboys nation won't miss those fumbles.   Good thing Randle fumbled twice in 50 touches right?    Romo's surgeries happened in 2013.. It's 2015. He had a hell of a season last year and is the healthiest he has been in a while.   He directly blamed his poor play in the Thanksgiving game on not being able to take his back medication. How is that irrelevant?  Also, OP is a bundle of sticks. No Eagles fan comes in peace.

cowboys,3dnbme,CC2560,3,Fri Jul 17 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"some of the points he made are valid, however he would have said the exact same things last year (and probably talk about an injury prone Murray and horrific defense in addition). Funny, I don't see any mention of the several times our offensive line gave tony 5+ seconds of time to throw in the pocket, or the fact that we just signed one of the best receivers in the league for the next 5 years, or the fact that tony is coming off one of his best years statistically ever.  the dude is a quality troll though, I can see how this would upset a lot of cowboys fans."

cowboys,3dnbme,surviva316,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:15:01 2015 UTC,Oh so he made the points I thought he would make.... Considering he does this every year it's even harder to take anything he says seriously.
cowboys,3dnbme,Capn_Cook,2,Sat Jul 18 02:43:21 2015 UTC,"The improvements made on defense are well undersold by this article.  1) Greg Hardy won't get to the QB because he owns guns.  Do I really need to rebut this point?  That is a massive FA addition at what was (as he shrewdly points out) the Cowboys' biggest weakness.  2) His point against Randy Gregory being a big addition is support for Tyrone Crawford and Demarcus Lawrence increasing their production this upcoming year.  If pass rushers never help out until their 2nd or 3rd season, then surely we should be looking at players that were added 2 or 3 drafts ago?  In that case, fine, take Gregory out of the conversation, and insert Lawrence and Crawford.  Either way, the Cowboys have been stockpiling at their biggest weakness for years.  3) How many additions does he need to the pass rush for him to be satisfied?  The most productive sack producer on the open market, a first round talent, and 2 emerging vets isn't enough?  If that's the case, then by the balls of Satan, the Eagles' secondary must be in for a world of hurt.  4) This article never even mentions the Cowboys' first-round pick.  To continue the comparison, would an article trashing how little the Eagles improved this offseason be received well if we pretended like Eric Rowe didn't exist?  The Eagles first improvement to their secondary came 20 picks after the Cowboys' ...  5) Sean Lee cannot play less than the 0 plays he played last season.  This isn't a hopeful truism that I'm throwing out like how Eagles fans suppose that their secondary can't possibly be worse this year, but an actual unavoidable fact of how counting snaps works.  It starts at 0, and it can only go up.  There are several other things to quibble about: sack rate isn't the best measurement for a line because eg: any team with Rodgers as QB is going to have a higher sack rate than any team with Peyton Manning as QB pretty much regardless of O-Lines.  Tony Romo is always going to take all the time he'd like and basically doesn't believe in throwing the ball away.  The Cowboys O-Line was well short of brilliant in blitz recognition last year, but let's not forget that 60% of the unit was 23 years old (including the LT and C).  They'll only get better.  But let's not get distracted from the main thing overlooked by this article: the Cowboys' defense improved immensely, and this article's article's one-sided, often-self-contradictory choosiness about which facts to harp on does not change the fact that they added a ton of talent."
cowboys,3dnbme,HiveNode,3,Sat Jul 18 06:10:26 2015 UTC,"So yes our sack rate may be what it is listed as there, but that is also part of Romo playing more conservatively. He's less of a gunslinger and is playing more like Rodgers where it's better to fall and take the sack rather than risk a pick. And not to mention our line is fucking good. You can call it overrated all you want but it's a damn good offensive line that is only going to get better. Frederick even responded to Collins after what he said pretty much saying shut your mouth and let's just play the game.  Yeah, losing Murray will hurt, but I think we can manage, especially if our new guys can handle not fumbling. It's a tradeoff mostly against us, but not as bad as this article makes it out to be.  Our sacks sucked these past few seasons, but we've added Greg Hardy. Lawrence was on fire at the end of the season. Sean Lee will be back. Not to mention we drafted defense all day.  Sean Lee is injury prone. Yeah, we know. That doesn't mean we're a dumpster fire. We went 12-4 without him last year and our defense was not terrible.  Romo had back surgeries... 2 years ago... He is constantly saying he feels better than ever. Unless he has a career ending injury, we're fine there.  Backup quarterback. If we have to go there, then we're done. We've shown that our backups can't handle the reins.  We beat the Seahawks last year and the Green Bay game was a damn close one and everyone knows that. We can tough it through a rough schedule.  Witten's old, but he's still ol' reliable. He's still a great blocker. People don't give him credit for when he blocks up like an OLineman.  We pay our corners a lot... so? Our corner situation is iffy, but we drafted guys like Byron Jones to try and help that. Every team has a weak point.  Our defense isn't good, but it damn isn't bad. Also, if our defense stays healthy, then any team playing us better watch out. Marinelli's coming for you and coming for you hard."

cowboys,3dnbme,romosgotthis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:57:24 2015 UTC,"I thought he made a convincing argument for how things could go wrong.   I think we will have a worse record than last year- too many things went our way to expect 12 wins again.   However, like Green Bay when they won the Superbowl, I think that we will be a better more experienced and focused team even if we have more losses. One playoff win at least- with all the right breaks a Superbowl appearance or win."
cowboys,3dnbme,LessASnowmanThanAGod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:53:29 2015 UTC,If Romo goes down there is no recovering from that. He got that one right. Our defense is not great but all his arguments were based on last year and there are quite a few new pieces in the mix. We'll see.
cowboys,3dnbme,zsxecorp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:53:56 2015 UTC,I agree with every point on this list...just dialed down a fair bit.  I am wondering how much of our pass blocking numbers suffered due to the Parnell games.
cowboys,3dnbme,Diamond_Body,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:27:30 2015 UTC,"I think that this article is a little out of control. There are some valid points but every team, even the best teams, have flaws. Heck, if the Packers were better in run blocking, they would have beat Seattle.  Obviously, the OL is elite in run blocking. I agree that the pass protection was close to average. However, there are a few things to consider to add context.  Tony Romo, as good as he is, has a tendency to hold the ball a little too long to make something happen. I think the sacks were a result of him and the average pass protection. Also, this OL is very young. There are three All-Pro players 24 or younger. This is only going to get better, and that is scary for other teams.  As with any player at any position in the NFL, you win some and you lose some. With that said, you can take 15 plays of the 1000s of plays and create any narrative you want.  I agree that they will miss Murray, but they have so many other pieces on offense, that there identity will be different. They still have Witten and Beasley in crucial situations to make an extension of the running game, considering the fact that they will face 1-on-1 coverage for the most part due to the presence of Dez Bryant.  Also, Romo's perceived threat to throw, and Dez Bryant's presence opened up running lanes for Murray. It goes both ways. Without Romo, you see what happened in the Cardinals game last season. And when the Eagles solely committed to limiting Murray in that second meeting, we all saw what happened. That threat is still there and Dez Bryant is only getting better.  Yes the pass rush was bad last season. That was the glaring weakness on the roster. However, it was much improved from 2013. That was arguably the worst pass rush in the history of the league from games 4-16. It was horrific. Last year, they added a lot of new faces on the DL unit. That was in fact a little improvement from 2013. However, many point to the offense as to why the defense wasn't horrible last season. I think in general, the defense was better last season than 2013 in it of itself. The marginal improvement in the pass rush from 2013 to 2014 had a domino effect on the defense as a whole, as they forced many turnovers last season, 1st in the NFC in fact.  With that said, the pass rush from 2014 to 2015 looks markedly improved. Jeremy Mincey was the top edge rusher for most of 2014. Now he is the 4th. When Jeremy Mincey is your fourth, moving inside in pass rush situations, that alone spells massive improvement in the pass rush. Randy Gregory is young yes. However, with the presence of Greg Hardy for most of the season now, that will allows Gregory to solely be on the field in pass rush situations. The presence of Hardy alone should make Gregory much more productive, due to the fact he will come in fresh, and his main job will be to sack the QB. I think that alone makes the Gregory argument invalid. They will have Hardy, Lawrence, Gardner, Russell, and Mincey on the field during running situations to spell Gregory for what he does best.  I agree about Sean Lee's injury history, but the Cowboys have prepared themselves for life without him. Even without Lee, the LB corps should still be competent and having Lee, an elite player when healthy, will just be an added bonus.  As far as backup Quarterbacks go, most teams don't even have a competent starting quarterback, yet alone a competent backup.  Yes Romo had surgeries in 2013, but for the first time in three years, he has been able to participate in a full offseason. He'll be ready to go and pick up where he left off in his MVP caliber season from last season.  As far as the Cowboys having to play the Packers and Seahawks, the Eagles will also have to play the Lions, and Cardinals, both of which will challenge the Packers and Seahawks in their respective divisions. All I have to say is that you have to beat the best to be the best. Dallas dominated Seattle last season and Green Bay isn't far and away better than the Cowboys to where the Cowboys have no chance.  The Jason Witten getting old narrative is a bit of a reach. Yes he is getting older, but he is an elite run blocking TE. Also, he still gets open in crucial situations. The Cowboys don't need him to be the Jason Witten of old when they have those other weapons. Jason Witten is a crucial piece in this offense and will continue to be for a few more years.  As far as over paying their corners, the only corner that was a sought after free agent was Brandon Carr. Yes, I agree he is overpaid. However, he came on at the end of last season and limited Calvin Johnson and Jordy Nelson. The pass defense was 26th in the league mostly due to the fact of the ineffective pass rush from last season. An improvement in the pass rush will only help the secondary. Brandon Carr is competent enough, but besides Corey White, the rest of the CBs are who they drafted.   The defense still isn't good argument remains to be seen. There defensive philosophy is a bend but don't break philosophy. They will give up yards. They gave up a lot of yards to the Bears last season, but that was after going up 35-7. Same with the Saints after going up 31-3. Yards don't matter like points do. When it comes to stats in general, you have to think of context. I have been a fan of plenty of Cowboys teams who were statistically good like the 2012 offense, but due to a horrible OL, Romo threw for 4900 yards. Does that mean the offense was better? No. Context, people. Last season the Cowboys were 15th in points allowed, 1st in takeways in the NFC, and one point away from being in the top 10. Points and takeaways are what matter in this scheme and with the improvement of the pass rush, there should be an improvement on all fronts, and it would not surprise me one bit to see the Cowboys lead the league in takeways, and be top 10 in points allowed, while giving up a shit ton of yards.  That is all."

cowboys,3dnbme,positivebeats,8,Fri Jul 17 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"the cowboys were ranked 18th last year in defense, had a ton of takeaways, while still dealing with injuries, and the redskins were 19th...the eagles have been bottom 5 both years since chip kelly became coach, the 2 best coaches in the NFL who happen to be defensive gurus thought fletcher and williams were good enough for their team respectively ...i trust them way more than you guys should be trusting chip kelly. you guys have been force fed ideas like lesean mccoy, your all time rushing leader wasnt a system fit and downgrading talent/blowing up your roster is the right thing to do since its about culture and not talent,   you do realize the miracles that happened in 2013 to allow the eagles to win the division right? besides having the weakest schedule in the division your team also was lucky enough to play 5 backup qbs including beating the cowboys backup by 2 points when the cowboys had the worst defense in the nfl under monte kiffin. a huge part of the reason your team was able to get to 10 wins  last year was the success of the eagles special teams unit which changes every year.  the idea that romo is one hit away from his career ending is ridiculous, i mean if thats what you want to bank on thats fine but every qb is one hit away from that, save maybe cam newton who would be 2 hits away from that because hes such a tank, heck..every player in the nfl is one hit away from their career ending, fortunately the cowboys have one of the toughest qbs to play in the nfl...hes also better than any qb the eagles have ever had, and better than all the qbs the eagles have now combined...so im very cool rolling with him. there is no such thing as a qb proof system like you fanboys have been lead to believe...talent matters in the nfl."

The unreasonable expectation that whoever you throw in ur backfield will produce amazing numbers, and Murray fumbled ALL the time and therefore good riddance.

We don't really have any good depth at safety now that Spillman is gone, either. The addition of Jones is going to help and hopefully Patmon shows us more this year.  Overall, I think it could be an improved unit in 2015, but I do say it's our weakest link."

cowboys,3dhu32,smot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:43:01 2015 UTC,"The silver lining is that he knows he's #4, and it's a contract year. So he should at least be giving 100% when he is on the field to try and prove himself."
cowboys,3dhu32,mr_feenys_car,9,Fri Jul 17 05:18:27 2015 UTC,"agreed.  i do think, however, that we will play above our talent level for a few reasons   wilcox and church may not be fantastic, but consistency will help them.  wilcox was new to the position and has gotten more practice.  church is getting older, but his game was never really dependent on athleticism our pass rush should be much improved, which should help them"
cowboys,3dhu32,Von_Skyhawk,7,Thu Jul 16 13:05:19 2015 UTC,A good pass rush makes an average secondary look good
cowboys,3dhu32,Sturgesg,6,Thu Jul 16 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"That's true, but it doesn't stop Wilcox and Church from taking poor angles and letting big plays go."

cowboys,3dhu32,Von_Skyhawk,4,Thu Jul 16 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not hating on the guy. He's an average safety in an average secondary. He's a great tackler, but when your SS leads a team in tackles, it's not a good thing."
cowboys,3dhu32,someedude,3,Thu Jul 16 21:38:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is not a good thing when your SS leads the team in tackles, but doesn't that speak more to the front-seven than it does the secondary?"
cowboys,3dhu32,Von_Skyhawk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:14:55 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. That's definitely on the front seven. Church picks up the slack in the second level for sure. He's always been great at that.
cowboys,3dhu32,someedude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:27:43 2015 UTC,"Church is a good open fielder tackler, probably the best on the team. Angles are not one of his weaknesses. Unless you mean in coverage then my bad."

cowboys,3dhu32,Von_Skyhawk,4,Thu Jul 16 19:07:43 2015 UTC,"He's great in the box and is one of the more sure tackling safeties in the league, but he can be sketchy in coverage. He could start for most teams in the league, but I don't think he's any better than an average SS."
cowboys,3dhu32,ocr1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"Spillman played less than Heath, and only because Heath was hurt for a few games. He's a special teamer who would probably be behind Jones, White and Heath on the depth chart."
cowboys,3dhu32,Von_Skyhawk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:37:46 2015 UTC,I'm not saying he's any better than Heath. His departure is just one less safety on the roster. I had forgotten we picked McCray back up when I made the original comment. I figured all we had backing Wilcox/Church up was White/Heath and Jones if we need him there.
cowboys,3dhu32,fisherjoe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:48:38 2015 UTC,I doubt McCray plays 40 snaps on defense this year.
cowboys,3dhu32,JasonThomas12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:29:05 2015 UTC,I'm sure he won't. Especially not behind White/Heath. The Danny McCray experiment was pretty bad a few years ago. Hopefully he can still ball on S/T.
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,4,Fri Jul 17 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"Running back and safety. We only have question marks at RB, though being a team sport our elite O-line will hopefully help us there. At safety, we lack speed and coverage ability. That was masked last year by our run game milking clock, so I'm expecting it to show a bit more this year."
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,5,Thu Jul 16 16:55:12 2015 UTC,Back up QB.  It's the only roster spot where disaster is only one play away.
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,2,Thu Jul 16 19:41:58 2015 UTC,nobody ever thinks of that. I just assume that if Romo goes down for an extended period then it's over.
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,15,Thu Jul 16 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"RB. It has the steepest drop in talent, we just lost the Offensive Player of the Year who was an integral part of why we went 12-4. He is so smart and saved us in pass protections as well.  And don't give me that OL is great nonsense so anyone can run behind this line nonsense. Murray had the most yards AFTER contact as well, this man is the real deal."
cowboys,3dhu32,Von_Skyhawk,7,Thu Jul 16 13:22:53 2015 UTC,Do you believe that it is possible for the Cowboys to have a top-10 running game in 2015 in spite of the departure of Murray?
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,2,Thu Jul 16 13:32:21 2015 UTC,"If we are doing RBBC probably not as they are going to be sharing the ball, if Randle or McFadden prove that they can take 20 carries a game then that is probably a high possibility."
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,4,Thu Jul 16 13:35:20 2015 UTC,"What is the basis of a stable of backs not succeeding?  In 2009, DeAngelo Williams ran for 1,117 yards while Jonathan Stewart had 1,133 total yards. Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott were a staple for Tampa Bay. Christian Okoye and Barry Word were killing it for KC.  I understand that McFadden has underachieved and that we don't know what Randle can do with a larger workload but shouldn't we give them the benefit of the doubt?"
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:46:09 2015 UTC,"Stewart, Alstott, and Okoye were all bruisers. They could punish a D-line and wear them down for the next guy up. We don't have that guy. That's my concern."
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,2,Thu Jul 16 13:48:21 2015 UTC,I don't think that is a necessity as much as it was a luxury for those teams.
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,-2,Thu Jul 16 13:52:03 2015 UTC,The basis is that these guys aren't good RBs. McFadden has fallen off the last two years and Randle is immature and has shown he isn't too prone to carrying the load.  I personally not giving the benefit of the doubt but I also know I could be wrong.
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,3,Thu Jul 16 13:57:41 2015 UTC,"Randle has only played 2 seasons and was behind Murray for both. While I agree that his stupidity off the field can indicate immaturity, I don't think that would preclude his ability to take on a larger role. 4.8 YPC for his career is pretty good. Other than off the field, why would he not be able to ""carry the load?"""
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,-4,Thu Jul 16 14:03:09 2015 UTC,His 4.8 number is inflated by this year's numbers as a fresh runner. We will see if he can get more than a few carries a game.  He has shown in the prior year he isn't that good when given sustained carries.  There is nothing to show me optimism about these RBs.
cowboys,3dhu32,Mekhami,3,Thu Jul 16 14:05:33 2015 UTC,I respect your opinion but I can't share it. I'm a little more optimistic when you consider the entire dynamic of the offense.

cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,-2,Thu Jul 16 14:32:25 2015 UTC,yea and how many of those runs were draws on third and 10+. those are easy runs to get 6+ yards on but no first down.
cowboys,3dhu32,verossiraptors,5,Thu Jul 16 14:20:57 2015 UTC,"According to his splits, the answer to your question is ... exactly one run.   He had 32 carries on first down, 15 carries on second down, and 4 carries on third down. Of the third down carries, two were on 3rd-and-1, one was on 3rd-and-7, and one was on 3rd-and-11 (he picked up 12 yards on that one, if you were wondering)."

cowboys,3dhu32,mexikaos,2,Thu Jul 16 14:30:28 2015 UTC,"I was agreeing with you, about his carries at least."
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,6,Thu Jul 16 14:46:00 2015 UTC,"Murray had the most yards after contact because of volume. Any back that runs an extra 100 carries is going to accumulate more yards after contact.   When you break it down on a per carry basis, he wasn't even top 15 after contact."
cowboys,3dhu32,mexikaos,0,Thu Jul 16 18:57:31 2015 UTC,Yes if you run alot you get more stats. If he didn't run +350 he wouldn't have 1800 yards.
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,3,Thu Jul 16 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"Yes but his YPC was still great. So I can't knock him for having 1800 yards on 392 carries. The carry volume doesn't hurt his argument.   But on yards after contact...absolutely. His YAC was average at best. He just had a ton of chances to accumulate it.   What that also tells you is that if we gave an RB that was average at best at YAC, had the OL give him a 3 yard push, we have an RB that can do around 80% of what Murray did or more.   The statistics are not in Murray's favor. And it's why coaches who are a lot smarter than us let him go over a few million guaranteed dollars overs 4 year deal."

cowboys,3dhu32,Doctor_Worm,3,Thu Jul 16 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"I don't see how you can't factor arguably the best O line in history in his stats. plus the addition of Collins only improved it... I bet you if Run DMC and Randle both get 200 carries each, they combine over 2000 yards rushing."
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,-5,Thu Jul 16 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"I don't see how you can't factor arguably the best O line in history in his stats.   Murray has been the same really good RB since he got here. They simply refused to run the ball. The stats back that up.   plus the addition of Collins only improved it...   This dude may not even start   I bet you if Run DMC and Randle both get 200 carries each, they combine over 2000 yards rushing.   So you think both will average about 5 yards per carry.. I'd take that bet."
cowboys,3dhu32,Doctor_Worm,2,Thu Jul 16 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"So you think Free, Leary or Bernardeau is better than Collins??? Plus Randle averaged over 5 ypc with only 50 or so attempts. McFadden is short of 5 ypc but... its the fucking raiders. Here is the biggest thing, they finish runs, take it to the house, Murray looked for more people to run over and had issues handling the ball in open field.  Edit: Randle 2014 6.7 ypc on 51 carries, 2014 DMC 4.1 ypc on 155 carries."
cowboys,3dhu32,mexikaos,-2,Thu Jul 16 15:51:08 2015 UTC,"So you think Free, Leary or Bernardeau is better than Collins???   He only is fighting against Leary and right now Leary is probably better.   Plus Randle averaged over 5 ypc with only 50 or so attempts.   Which is normal for change of pace backs. Also we don't even know if that was an anomaly he was given the same amounts of touches the year before but only had 3.0 average.   Here is the biggest thing, they finish runs, take it to the house, Murray looked for more people to run over and had issues handling the ball in open field.   Yes they can take it to the house. Murray is still better as he is smart, physical, great run blocker and has been great since he got in the league."
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,3,Thu Jul 16 15:58:27 2015 UTC,"Which is normal for change of pace backs.   That's just not true.   Since 2000, a running back has had between 40 and 60 rushing attempts in a season 122 times. Only 18 of those (less than 15%) averaged more than 5 yards per carry, and the best YPC of that entire group was Randle's 6.73 ypc. [Source] Of course, we can nitpick what the exact range of carries should be to define a ""change of pace back,"" but anyway I've tried to slice it, the results are the same -- only a small fraction of the qualifying players topped 5 ypc, and Randle is at or near the very top.  Obviously last year could have been an anomaly and he may not be able to keep up the same pace, but let's not pretend Randle just had a typical season for a change of pace back."
cowboys,3dhu32,mexikaos,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:18:14 2015 UTC,If you look at his 54 attempts the year before he had 3.0 average.
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,3,Thu Jul 16 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"I know, but that wasn't the question. You said it's ""normal"" for a change of pace back to have 5+ ypc in a season. The fact that he had a subpar season as a rookie doesn't change the fact that he had a great season last year."
cowboys,3dhu32,mexikaos,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:36:49 2015 UTC,I don't think that constitutes as a great year. Too limited number of carries to call it great.  If he carries it 200+ and 5.0 average I'm wrong.
cowboys,3dhu32,SmittenWitten,2,Thu Jul 16 18:37:59 2015 UTC,"No, I meant a great year for a change of pace back, which is what we were talking about. You said his YPC was ""normal"" for someone with his number of carries, which isn't true at all."
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,2,Thu Jul 16 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wouldn't expect Randle to have done much in his rookie year, I just can't see how you can dismiss their running game based off of one person, who yes is very talented, but not by any means the game changing caliber you portray him."
cowboys,3dhu32,Von_Skyhawk,3,Thu Jul 16 16:09:21 2015 UTC,Are you saying Murray isn't game changing? If so you aren't watching Cowboy games.
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,3,Thu Jul 16 16:11:58 2015 UTC,"haha yeah I saw how his fumble changed the game last year in the playoffs that is what cost us the game not the Dez catch. I saw open field in front of him maaaaaany times only to be run down by the defense. I saw a just above average back who had issues knowing when and where to cut but excellent blocking and his power compensated for it. Backs like him are a dime a dozen, that's why the cowboys didn't pay him."
cowboys,3dhu32,Von_Skyhawk,2,Thu Jul 16 16:20:41 2015 UTC,exactly that. he never could break away. hopefully DMac still has that gear.
cowboys,3dhu32,Washington_Fitz,2,Thu Jul 16 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"You can't use mistakes as a way to discredit people because if that was the case many great players have made blunders.  If you think someone who got 1,800 yards average and led the league in yards after contact an above average RB then I have nothing more to say to you as you are clearly either bias or blind."
cowboys,3dhu32,EffYourCouch,0,Thu Jul 16 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"Bias? You're talking about my team. If I was bias, I would sound like.... you?! Its not a discredit, its stating facts. He had/has an issue fumbling and injury which I didn't even mention, since he was a Sooner. But if you think having a historical offensive line has nothing to do with run production or that getting close to 400 carries isn't going to boost overall yardage then I'll leave you to your armchair quarterbacking."
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:04:35 2015 UTC,"Murray was hurt, yes he has always been a good RB, I knew it when he first ran at OU but he would not have had those yards behind a different line, period.   Collins will not start but depth is everything in this league.   No need to comment on the last part because that will show in a few months."

cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,2,Fri Jul 17 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"RB is a position where someone can come in and immediately contribute since it doesn't have the steepest learning curve. I'm not 100% confident in our stable of mediocre backs, but that at least gives us fans some reason to be optimistic about the RB situation. I don't think production will be affected on a catastrophic level, though."
cowboys,3dhu32,EffYourCouch,-1,Thu Jul 16 13:43:16 2015 UTC,Will it be catastrophic? No but on paper right now that is the weakest position on this team.
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,3,Thu Jul 16 13:59:01 2015 UTC,Meh. On paper doesn't really matter. It's much easier to excel at RB than it is at CB or S. IMO the secondary is the bigger liability.
cowboys,3dhu32,EffYourCouch,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:44:11 2015 UTC,And that's your opinion.
cowboys,3dhu32,SuperKerfuz,6,Thu Jul 16 18:08:24 2015 UTC,Running back.   Seriously.  We have no idea how it's going to play out without Murray.  Hopefully one of the guys we have pans out but we really won't know until the season starts.
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,2,Thu Jul 16 13:14:06 2015 UTC,"If Dallas goes with a RBC, are you optimistic that it can be successful?"
cowboys,3dhu32,EffYourCouch,3,Thu Jul 16 13:33:26 2015 UTC,Not really.  We need a main RB.  Right now we don't have one.  I hope one of our RBs breaks out during training camp.
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,2,Thu Jul 16 13:42:01 2015 UTC,Why? Why would a tandem not work?
cowboys,3dhu32,Von_Skyhawk,2,Thu Jul 16 13:47:02 2015 UTC,"It very well might but I don't remember a successful team using a RBC.  IMO there's too many variables using multiple RBs throughout a game.  It's better to have a MAIN RB that knows his role, knows he's getting the rock double digit times and knows how to block.    If we use multiple backs it's easier for a D to determine what type of play we'll run."

cowboys,3dhu32,Von_Skyhawk,2,Thu Jul 16 13:55:22 2015 UTC,Did they use RBC? I thought Blount was their guy.

The Saints ran a good RBBC for a while with Ingram, Sproles/Robinson, Thomas, and Ivory. The Colts ran with Bradshaw, Richardson, and Herron. Last year the Ravens started off with a RBBC with Pierce, Forsett, and Taliaferro. Forsett eventually took the job because he played well. The Raiders also experienced a similar situation by using MJD, McFadden, and Murray. Eventually Murray was their guy. If we're lucky, we might find our starter after a few weeks like the Raiders and Ravens."
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,2,Thu Jul 16 14:51:38 2015 UTC,Not when you look at the distribution of carries.
cowboys,3dhu32,Tomcat1108,2,Thu Jul 16 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the Pats are the exception not the rule."
cowboys,3dhu32,squatreferee69,2,Thu Jul 16 14:15:55 2015 UTC,Very possible. Having Tom Brady makes a lot of things easier.
cowboys,3dhu32,rthaw,3,Thu Jul 16 14:32:34 2015 UTC,I think whoever shines the most in camp is going to be getting a bulk of the carries. I'm not sure the Cowboys plan on splitting the workload among the backs.
cowboys,3dhu32,MrHighlight,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:45:46 2015 UTC,What are you basing this on?
cowboys,3dhu32,someedude,4,Thu Jul 16 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"I just don't think that was ever the plan based on the current roster of backs. Rhythm is huge in the run game. Especially when you're team relies on controlling the clock. It's just a hunch/opinion, but I think someone is getting 20 carries a game this year."
cowboys,3dhu32,J0llyR0dger,2,Thu Jul 16 13:52:40 2015 UTC,I respect your opinion but I will have to wait and see if that comes to fruition.
cowboys,3dhu32,Mmiller9374,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"that's my biggest problem with RBBC, a RB's rhythm. They all say it's hard to get a flow when you're in and out every other possession."
cowboys,3dhu32,OhhDavie,2,Thu Jul 16 14:19:45 2015 UTC,"To me the ""rhythm"" thing is over-rated. I think it's more of an excuse for a starter when he is underperforming."

cowboys,3dftxf,yeeerrrp,3,Wed Jul 15 23:19:09 2015 UTC,Not for me. You gotta get into soccer (US MENS National Team) if you're American of course. I know it's not for everyone. I didn't even understand it until after 2010 but it has greatly helped with the football off season.
cowboys,3dftxf,TexasLAWdog,2,Thu Jul 16 11:31:07 2015 UTC,"On that, soccer fans in stadium have as good if not better atmosphere than the NFL, even in MLS. The games are way cheaper and rarely longer than 2 hours including halftime. Awesome way to keep your hype up year round. I started liking soccer when I lived in Kansas City so Sporting KC is my futbol team in the football offseason."

cowboys,3dftxf,TexasLAWdog,2,Thu Jul 16 15:49:05 2015 UTC,I've done the same!! I just decided to start following the MLS this season (I live in NY so I decided to become a fan of NYCFC) and I have REALLY enjoyed it. It really is the perfect complement to football season. Not to mention the WWC and the Gold Cup for the US national teams. I highly recommend getting into soccer during the NFL offseasons.

cowboys,3dftxf,hardNheavy,6,Thu Jul 16 16:27:28 2015 UTC,"Since I only got to see Dez torch the eagles secondary mostly, how do you guys feel his production will be effected if/when Romo retires?"
cowboys,3dftxf,NintenJew,8,Thu Jul 16 00:50:43 2015 UTC,When Romo was injured Kitna had some huge plays with Dez. That was with the terrible mix & match oline we had. If we can get a QB that will put it out there I feel pretty good about it.  For all the flack he gets Romo doesn't often throw it up for grabs like Eli or Stafford. INTs would go up but so would Dez's highlight reel.

cowboys,3dftxf,I3eastmode,3,Thu Jul 16 01:12:15 2015 UTC,"Not talking about w/l record or anything, but after Romo's gone there is a good possibility it could increase Dez's production.  Of course Dez will be older then, so who knows.  But I think a lesser QB would not spread the ball around and use fewer reads, throwing it up to Dez more often.  And Dez can make those plays, it's just that Tony tends to find the more open target, and even avoids looking at Dez when he knows there's double coverage."
cowboys,3dftxf,Sparkasaurusmex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:02:37 2015 UTC,"Romo is our guy. We see how it is without him, bad. The other QBs just don't have that chemistry with Dez. I think the only that came close was Kitna. Other than that, no one comes close."
cowboys,3dftxf,sleepyCOLLEGEstudent,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:39:42 2015 UTC,"if/when Romo retires?   He won't. He will become the bionic man.  All joking aside, I see Dez filling the security blanket role that Jason Witten  has right now, especially with a change of QB."

I did some research on them before I ordered and heard reviews saying they're pretty good with replacing shitty products but I've never had the need to put it to the test. Some things I did notice such as the Star on the arm of the Tyron Smith jersey was stitched on while the others were part on the band. These come equipped with Nike logos and tags for ""authenticity"". Overall I'm happy with these jerseys, nobody has yet to spot the difference and I get to enjoy the fact that I spent roughly $130 rather than $600+.

I understand trying to get more yards, but I find myself yelling at the TV for him to just get downed."

cowboys,3de6ge,jckiker,13,Wed Jul 15 15:57:45 2015 UTC,"There has never been any justice in the court of public opinion.  If you aren't Greg Hardy or Nicole Holder, you have no idea what happened and probably shouldn't act like you do.  All we really know is that, for whatever reason, the prosecutors didn't think they had strong enough evidence to obtain a conviction in a jury trial.  A lot of people argue that this is because Hardy ""paid her off,"" which isn't remotely true. He settled her separate civil case, as most civil defendants do. Without knowing how much she received, we can never know whether the settlement was a reflection of evidence in her favor or simply a reflection of the cost of defense. It's frequently a good business decision to settle a case even if you could successfully defend it, simply because lawsuits tend to be rather expensive even if you win.  Settlement or no settlement, the prosecutors were free to push forward with his criminal case. They were also free to introduce her testimony from the first trial into evidence, so the fact that she wasn't going to show up is not as significant as it's often made out to be.  Bottom line: We don't know what happened, and can't draw any strong conclusions from the circumstantial evidence available. It's a pretty basic staple of American law that you shouldn't be treated as though guilty under those circumstances. Maybe he beat her up and should be in jail. Maybe she lied about the whole thing for a payday. The one thing that's certain is that no online journalist knows any better than the rest of us do. They should probably all chill out a bit."
cowboys,3de6ge,jrharvey4,7,Wed Jul 15 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"They were also free to introduce her testimony from the first trial into evidence, so the fact that she wasn't going to show up is not as significant as it's often made out to be.   It's very significant.  A good defense attorney would get that thrown out if the witness is not available for cross-examination.  This is why cases get thrown out when witnesses get dead; even if a witness has been deposed and cross-examined there, the defense  has a right to confront the accuser(s)."
cowboys,3de6ge,jswilson64,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"You'd definitely be right if we were talking about admitting her deposition testimony, but I don't think it necessarily works that way in this context. We're talking about trial testimony. She was there for cross-examination—in the original trial, when the testimony was taken.  It's possible the judge might have sustained some objection from Hardy's attorneys, but it's also possible the evidence could well have come in. Hardy has the right to face his accuser but he was afforded the right at the time she actually testified. Her absence goes more to credibility than admissibility in this context, although I have no doubt Hardy's counsel would make the same argument you have.  Beyond that, prosecutors take domestic violence cases to trial despite the absence of the victim all the time. They'd have done so here if they felt they could get a conviction out of it. No prosecutor is going to voluntarily drop a potentially meritorious domestic violence case against a high-profile athlete."

The guy can say he cares about playing and wants to be a Cowboy all he wants but he really only cares about the recognition of being the highest paid.

cowboys,3dcnas,LampBrain,3,Wed Jul 15 06:12:53 2015 UTC,Not under contract but the Cowboys have exclusive rights to his contract.  If the tag is signed it guarantees him 12+ million dollars.  However Dez knows his value is higher and would like more guaranteed over a long period of time.  Dallas has made a couple offers but Dez has been unhappy with the money he's been offered.  Today is the last day that a long term deal can be negotiated so after today a long term deal could not be reached until next season.

cowboys,3dg1p5,moogie_boogie,6,Thu Jul 16 00:01:22 2015 UTC,"Upvoting because this is well thought out and written, but it eeks of the same old ""Jerry Sucks"" hivemind.  Romo is gone in three years freeing up 20 mil a year roughly. We have to pay Hardy a superstar contract next year. Additionally, Dez is objectively much better than D.T., and should play that way for the duration of his contract. Also, the cap will continue to increase in the coming years."
cowboys,3dg1p5,Call_the_Law,3,Thu Jul 16 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of that previous jerry contract nonsense, as I understand it, was paying bookoo money to guys like Brandon Carr who didn't necessarily deserve it, and overpaying for guys that did.  I personally think the amount were paying Dez is pretty fair, if tenuous on our cap hit.  The more ""classic jerry"" thing to do would have been to keep demarco and dez, and Dez got Megatron money, and also we signed Beasley for a fuck ton more.    This contract was a lot about faith and trust, and I think the way it's structured helps keep the overall price down, while giving Dez thay faith and trust he wanted.  Sure it's dangerous, but it was always going to be for Dez's talent level."
cowboys,3dg1p5,Necroxenomorph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:23:24 2015 UTC,Pluse only singing Hardy for one year and not a multi year deal impressed me
cowboys,3dg1p5,Leonbethyname,2,Thu Jul 16 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to understand how the cap works year to year. Extra cap space rolls over so if you save now you have more later which is rolling over. By giving Dez the lower cap number in year 1 we saved $6m against the cap compared to the Broncos. Also I like how you added a bogus $1m to Dez's contract to make it not look similar on those final 2 years. His cap hit would be $16.5m those final years, not $17 - so very similar to demaryius."
cowboys,3dg1p5,jasoncongo,2,Thu Jul 16 03:43:26 2015 UTC,"In a bubble, you are correct, but in practice, my guess is that this is structured this way to give the cowboys more flexibility in the next 2 years to either sign hardy, resign crawford, or add one more peice to make a playoff run..."
cowboys,3dg1p5,oldboot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:20:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, now that I think about it... maybe the Cowboys had to do this to account for Greg Hardy's reduced suspension.  Hardy playing 6 extra games means the Cowboys will need to pay him for 6 more games than anticipated.  Maybe they freed up this extra cap space, in preparation for that."
cowboys,3dg1p5,oldboot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:40:55 2015 UTC,"I think Dez contract was laid out this way by design, to fit into the puzzle of their Cap...assuming JJ doesn't know how to structure a contract is absurd. They may even be planning on squeezing as much of romos contract out of the cap in the next 2 years as well, that was the plan this year- to carry a huge cap hit for him to get some relief in future years, but i guess the possibility of Hardy was too good to pass up so they restructured."
cowboys,3dg1p5,nyuhokie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:30:15 2015 UTC,"Where did you get your numbers from?  OTC is showing different numbers in terms of cap hits and dead money.    Regardless, this doesn't seem like same ol' Jerry to me at all. What I felt when I first saw the deal, and everything I've read, was that it was pretty reasonable.  It makes a lot of sense for the contract to escalate in the later years of the deal, because of the steady increase we've seen in the salary cap."

cowboys,3dbu7p,HiveNode,3,Wed Jul 15 03:01:41 2015 UTC,I'm too young to know him but he doesn't seem likable
cowboys,3dbu7p,HiveNode,3,Wed Jul 15 03:05:14 2015 UTC,He's a lot less likable when he isn't helping your team win games. Also when he's being a traitor. I used to like how much of a blind homer he was; nobody in the Ring of Honor should ever say the Eagles are better than the Cowboys unless it's like in 2005 when we sucked and they just got off another Super Bowl loss.
cowboys,3dbu7p,DondeEstaLaPlaya,2,Wed Jul 15 04:53:53 2015 UTC,If you are talking about him picking the Eagles to win the division he's not being a traitor he's just trying to do his job as an analyst.
cowboys,3dbu7p,HiveNode,2,Wed Jul 15 16:36:31 2015 UTC,Key word: trying. He's doing a bad job in this situation.
cowboys,3dbu7p,reyggg,2,Wed Jul 15 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"When he said the Eagles are better than the Cowboys this off-season I was like what. Seriously, we finished 12-4, tied for best record in the NFL, and strengthened our defense immensely. I don't care if we lost Murray, we were just as good on offense when we were throwing it 50 times a game, offense has never been our problem.   Now if we lose Bryant that's a different story. We will definitely be worse off, but Idk about 8-8. However what I do know is that there's no way dez misses more than 2 games tops... just to put things into perspective, his rookie contract was 5 years 11.8 million and he has a chance to make 12 million this season, no way he sits out the year."

We still went 8-8 with him 3 out of the 4 years he has been here. What has changed? Our suspect defense has been upgraded on paper and the oline continues to improve. There is so much hope left either way this plays out. I just hope it's the one where he gets signed and not the drama one. Keep hope alive!

cowboys,3d81h7,pumadude321,18,Tue Jul 14 16:12:37 2015 UTC,Who was throwing to johnson his first three years though?
cowboys,3d81h7,zsxecorp,37,Tue Jul 14 06:37:55 2015 UTC,"Jon ""the Cowboys Legend"" Kitna.   Edit: Among others"
cowboys,3d81h7,gdaman22,13,Tue Jul 14 06:44:27 2015 UTC,And he also threw to Dez!
cowboys,3d81h7,DiscoKitten,6,Tue Jul 14 06:57:12 2015 UTC,I should say better part of four seasons though. Johnson didn't have romo for 90% of his career like Dez.
cowboys,3d81h7,zsxecorp,2,Tue Jul 14 11:09:53 2015 UTC,"this is being overlooked, I feel. Look at fantasy football, you can get away with a WR3 as a starter assuming you have a prolific passer throwing to him. No one has benefited more from having Romo at the helm than Dez. While his YAC would likely still be high without an elite QB feeding him, his other numbers would likely be down."
cowboys,3d81h7,Patron_St_of_Liars,2,Tue Jul 14 14:10:52 2015 UTC,You should also look at the other receiving options on those detroit teams.
cowboys,3d81h7,thabe331,8,Tue Jul 14 17:07:08 2015 UTC,Also Dez is way healthier than CJ.
cowboys,3d81h7,flordeliest,3,Tue Jul 14 12:19:32 2015 UTC,No dez missed 7 games and cj missed 4.
cowboys,3d81h7,Aytenlol,5,Tue Jul 14 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Ding ding ding here's the right answer.  People use stats in a sports argument like a drunk uses a lightpole walking home. For support, not illumination."

cowboys,3d81h7,Mekhami,2,Tue Jul 14 13:58:42 2015 UTC,i appreciated it.
cowboys,3d81h7,newaccount73,2,Tue Jul 14 14:24:22 2015 UTC,Haha.  Well that went right over my head.
cowboys,3d81h7,trillustrator,6,Tue Jul 14 14:25:14 2015 UTC,I was just looking at this yesterday. Here is a table I made with the other highest paid WR for 2015.
cowboys,3d81h7,jlacomb17,4,Tue Jul 14 13:18:16 2015 UTC,"Dez is most similar to Calvin Johnson and Larry Fitzgerald on that chart. If you average their contracts and adjust for salary cap inflation, that would make Dez's contract somewhere around 7 years/$162.1 million. The guaranteed money comes out funny because Fitzgerald's contract is fully guaranteed, so if you just use Johnson's guaranteed money as a base, it would be around $57.8 million."
cowboys,3d81h7,Wyn6,14,Tue Jul 14 14:17:27 2015 UTC,Pay that man his money
cowboys,3d81h7,SFThirdStrike,9,Tue Jul 14 07:27:12 2015 UTC,Johnson also gets benefit of garbage time coverage. I think Johnson is the best receiver in the NFL but that year he broke records was bullshit. The lions were shitty and they basically always had to pass to keep up[sound familiar?]
cowboys,3d81h7,oldboot,5,Tue Jul 14 13:16:03 2015 UTC,"This isn't justification for paying him CJ $$, if that is what you are implying, a team just can't remain competetive if you allot that much $$ to one non- QB player, and really, even to a QB unless he is a major difference maker. How deep have the lions ever gone in the playoffs with CJ?"
cowboys,3d81h7,supposedly_laid_back,11,Tue Jul 14 14:50:30 2015 UTC,The Lions are the exact reason you don't bet the franchise on a reciever.
cowboys,3d81h7,wild_thingy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:56:52 2015 UTC,"We aren't the Lions and Dez deserves to get paid. Or, you know, fuck it. Let's not sign him. Franchise him. Piss him off and let's watch Tonys window for a super bowl go out the window.   The Lions had bigger issues than giving CJ a big contract. We aren't in the same boat and we don't go if Dez doesn't go."
cowboys,3d81h7,krvv98,3,Tue Jul 14 23:05:30 2015 UTC,This is really good considering he was just average his first couple years. He's exploded since then.
cowboys,3d81h7,HiveNode,4,Tue Jul 14 14:07:55 2015 UTC,Still not worth what Megatron got paid.
cowboys,3d9qi3,davisj4989,23,Tue Jul 14 16:33:10 2015 UTC,"If Dez is willing to abandon his team and teammates then so be it. It will be his tarnished legacy, not the club's.   From all credible info Dez has been offered a very lucrative deal, if he wishes to hold out for the best deal ever that's his right, but it's my right as a fan to tell him to suck it."
cowboys,3d9qi3,GremmieCowboy,9,Tue Jul 14 17:01:21 2015 UTC,You don't think that it looks poorly on the club that we let our top RB and possibly top WR walk because we wouldn't pay them? I am just asking as far as the tone that sets.
cowboys,3d9qi3,yaychristy,10,Tue Jul 14 17:36:32 2015 UTC,Jerry has just recently emerged from the giant hole he dug himself by overpaying other players. Some fiscal responsibility from him is a refreshing change.
cowboys,3d9qi3,jswilson64,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:35:23 2015 UTC,Thats because it's not Jerry doing this
cowboys,3d9qi3,NotDrGiggleFairies,-1,Wed Jul 15 14:59:12 2015 UTC,"True. My personal feelings are that Jerry, Jerry Jr., and Stephen are figure heads, and Charlotte is the true brains behind the operation now. She's the only one that seems like she has more than half a brain in her head."
cowboys,3d9qi3,jswilson64,5,Wed Jul 15 15:16:19 2015 UTC,what? It's Stephen who's in charge
cowboys,3d9qi3,NotDrGiggleFairies,9,Wed Jul 15 15:34:53 2015 UTC,Dez is still franchised. He has to play in at the extreme least 7 games (weeks 11-17) if he wants any money.
cowboys,3d9qi3,Capn_Cook,3,Tue Jul 14 17:38:05 2015 UTC,"well if he doesn't play in those seven games, he can just get franchised next year for the same right, if I'm not mistaken."
cowboys,3d9qi3,sag969,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"And the Cowboys need Dez if they want to be Super Bowl contenders.  That is the dance Dez is playing. I have $$ already, but you need me"
cowboys,3d9qi3,hMJem,13,Wed Jul 15 02:28:38 2015 UTC,"I was never in favor of paying Murray what the Eagles gave him. They can have him for that price.   As for Dez, nowhere that I'm aware has anyone said we are willing to ""let him walk"" because we won't pay him. The way I understand it, a very good offer was made to Dez and he refused it. If he wants the kind of money that will handicap the club in future years, then he can ultimately sit out if that's what he's threatening to do because no player is bigger than the club (except maybe the QB)."
cowboys,3d9qi3,GremmieCowboy,3,Tue Jul 14 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"I remember hearing about offers going back and forth during the season, but those had low guarantees according to the insiders.  The first one I heard about was a 10 year, $114 million contract with $20 million guaranteed.  Have there been more contracts since then with details made public?"
cowboys,3d9qi3,pumadude321,3,Tue Jul 14 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"I remember that one, that would've been a terrible contract for Dez.  I think the numbers right now are looking at the $40 million guaranteed range."
cowboys,3d9qi3,candleruse,3,Tue Jul 14 18:48:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, unless that's a 3 year deal with guaranteed money in the 40s, it's still probably a bad deal for him.  He was definitely top 3 by the end of the season, and that puts him around the $16 million mark.  Why doesn't the FO just pay him?  The Boys have around $12 million in cap space.  Give the guy $3 million more this year, and that still leaves the team with $9 million in cap space which is plenty."
cowboys,3d9qi3,pumadude321,3,Tue Jul 14 18:55:42 2015 UTC,¯\(ツ)/¯
cowboys,3d9qi3,candleruse,5,Tue Jul 14 19:25:13 2015 UTC,"Dez doesn't deserve near what Calvin or Fitz got, they only got those because their obscene rookie deals made their franchise tags unwieldy (upper 20m range, like Suh). Give Dez 14m a year, that's about what he's worth."
cowboys,3d9qi3,HiveNode,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:21:48 2015 UTC,"So Calvin is making an average of $16.2 million a year on his contract, and Fitz is making an average of $11 million.  Fitz has a back loaded contract, but nonetheless averages $11 million a year over the next 4 years.    When you have a guy like Maclin commanding $11 million a year, you're going to have to pay much higher.  I don't think $14 is reasonable for what Bryant is worth to the team.  He's the main force on that offense, and performed at a top 3 WR level last year.  That'll get him at least $15 million alone.  I think the best case scenario for the FO is 5 years, $75 million ($37.5 million guaranteed).  Timing is everything.  He performed really well in his contract year, and he wants to be payed for it.  Timing of that performance sucked for management and was great for him, but that doesn't matter.  The man wants his pay check now that he's off his rookie contract."
cowboys,3d9qi3,pumadude321,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"My usual question in all of this is: why does Maclin being overpaid mean we should follow a bad deal as if it were ""the market price""?"
cowboys,3d9qi3,not_hitler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:29:24 2015 UTC,"The whole market for wideouts is shifting to cost more, not just Maclin.  That means you have to pay guys like Dez and Demaryius more."
cowboys,3d9qi3,pumadude321,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:43:11 2015 UTC,The point is that the CBA is flawed. They got what they were worth because the franchise tag was not an option.for Dez he essentially has no leverage because the team can franchise him for relatively cheap
cowboys,3d9qi3,prince-kunta,0,Tue Jul 14 21:37:33 2015 UTC,"Umm.. I come from a very poor family. I would take that contract in a heart beat. Why do these players need so much money? Are they horrible with their money? If I was in Dez position, 20 million is all I need to be set for life. Buy a nice small house, a nice car and then save the rest of my money. Are these players buying 20 Bugatti cars or something that they need so much?"
cowboys,3d9qi3,BardMusical,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:03:00 2015 UTC,"It's about the market, and respect.  And keeping salaries up there so the other guys in the league have that benchmark. If you take less, you're screwing the other guys.  So goes the logic."
cowboys,3d9qi3,jswilson64,0,Wed Jul 15 15:28:58 2015 UTC,Sounds like Dez is being greedy. I'm hearing Cowboys offered him 14 to 15 million a year? That's very good money. What does he want to get paid? 20 million a year?
cowboys,3d9qi3,BardMusical,3,Wed Jul 15 16:37:50 2015 UTC,I don't because I feel like the club is being smart and not giving away contracts that would hurt the club. It's not like Jerry has a reputation for being cheap where he's letting guys go because he's cheap.
cowboys,3d9qi3,sportsteambfan,2,Tue Jul 14 18:29:14 2015 UTC,"I think it reflects well on the front office. The best teams are smart with their money. They offered DeMarco a fair deal and someone else offered him more. I assume that they have offered Dez a fair deal. In the past, Jerry would have given the player whatever he wanted. I love this new way of thinking. It will be hugely successful in the long run."
cowboys,3d9qi3,jlacomb17,2,Tue Jul 14 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"meh I dno. I think it sets the tone that the Cowboys are different now. They're about winning smartly, not splurging money that negatively affects the whole franchise. They did it last year with Demarcus Ware, they did it this year with Murray. The team is obviously worse off without Dez, but at the same time I don't want to overspend for him and have him handicapping our team 3-5 years down the road when Romo is gone and we are undergoing a QB transition."
cowboys,3d9qi3,sag969,2,Tue Jul 14 20:40:30 2015 UTC,"i think it looks positive for the club, remember when everyone was bashing us for spending lavishly and overpaying on contracts? that looked bad. No one thinks the patriots look bad for letting their players walk..."
cowboys,3d9qi3,oldboot,2,Tue Jul 14 20:55:03 2015 UTC,the problem i have is that demarco ran good every time he got a chance. when the line was bad he still produced. i just don't trust randle to carry it and if the cowboys trust randle this year than why not last year when demarco played with a cast.
cowboys,3d9qi3,ruffus4life,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:57:20 2015 UTC,"The draw back was that he couldn't stay healthy. Last season was the first time he didn't miss a game because of injury, and he did get injured. It's possible he would have missed some time last season if he wasn't playing for a contract. One good season doesn't make him worth big money long term, and that's what he wanted. If it were just for this season, maybe the Cowboys would have stepped up with the money, but for four years, it just wasn't going to happen."
cowboys,3d9qi3,T-Luv,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:31:05 2015 UTC,i just don't understand why you run him to death then last year if this year you go with a bunch of what ifs at rb.
cowboys,3d9qi3,ruffus4life,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:34:47 2015 UTC,Why not run him to death if you aren't bringing him back?
cowboys,3d9qi3,T-Luv,0,Tue Jul 14 21:36:27 2015 UTC,you don't run him to death and use your rb depth and you get demarco for a lower price. feels dirty and not good business.
cowboys,3d9qi3,ruffus4life,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you were watching, but Demarco was much better than those other guys, and the Cowboys were making a playoff run and needed Demarco to make that happen. Randle just wasn't there yet. Could he be better this season? Maybe, but he certainly wasn't going to carry the team the way Demarco did last season."
cowboys,3d9qi3,T-Luv,0,Tue Jul 14 21:43:15 2015 UTC,yes i know which is why i am pretty worried about the rb's the cowboys have. i think demarco is a better back than people give him credit and i see no one that can really even come close to his production even with 3-4 guys getting carries.  are they not making a playoff run this year?
cowboys,3d9qi3,ruffus4life,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's very good, but not durable. The issue wasn't paying him a lot of money next year. The issue was paying him a lot of money four years from now. It was too much of a risk for that much money down the road considering his injury history. The Eagles were willing to take the risk and the Cowboys weren't. Unless he has a major turn around in durability, then the Cowboys made the right choice. He had one good season and expected to be paid based on that single season, rather than looking at his entire body of work and paying based on that. It's just a risky move. The type of move the Cowboys are trying to stay away from. Paying players big money based on one season is exactly why they've been mediocre at best for the past 2 decades."

cowboys,3d9qi3,jswilson64,3,Tue Jul 14 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"He has leverage if he holds out into the regular season and we're losing. At that point he should be able to get a guarantee of no tag for 2016 to return. Hell, he could get that in the middle of training camp if it looks like we're seriously screwed without him."

cowboys,3d9qi3,jswilson64,4,Tue Jul 14 17:22:14 2015 UTC,"I think you hit the panic button mid season.  /u/theparallelogram is right in saying at this point it's out of our hands.  But you posed the question, so I'll answer it with a proper response based on my opinion.  If the deal doesn't get done, I think you're right, I think Dez will be too prideful to go back on his word, and I think he will sit out games in the regular season.  There is no point, as it only loses money for him, but it brings me right to the panic button point.  I think he wont sit out for long.  1-4 games I think, before he realizes reluctantly that he's losing too much money.  But at that point the damage will be done.  Dez will feel betrayed by Dallas, whom he has called home, and given his heart to.   I hit the panic button personally mid season if he holds out, and contract discussions aren't heard of (because in this day and age something always gets reported ""off the record"", even when teams say they wont discuss until end of season).  I hit the panic button then because I think Dez will be so hurt that he may just leave.  Dallas can keep franchise tagging him obviously, but it'll only lead to furthering the strained relationship.  I think he'll leave Dallas and we will wonder why this deal just didn't get done.  That said I think the deal gets done by the 4pm deadline on Wednesday."

cowboys,3d9qi3,tonyprent22,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"The right kind of guy doesn't really have anything to do with off the field shit like contracts, behavior, etc. Dez loves and is passionate about football, and works hard. That's the RKoG."
cowboys,3d9qi3,HiveNode,0,Tue Jul 14 20:25:31 2015 UTC,Dez will take the deal or he will be there week 1 (week 2 at the latest) under the tag. I'm willing to bet that the Cowboys know he NEEDS the money. The Roc Nation contract bonus is probably running thin by now.

I don't know if it's technically ""being a cheap ass,"" but Jerry learned his lesson about paying too much, otherwise Demarcus Ware would still be a Cowboy.  And Dez is being selfish - that's the definition of negotiation from the player's perspective. But Dez doesn't want to admit that his prior off the field behavior is hurting him now. Sort of a ""past nucklehead"" tax."

cowboys,3d9qi3,therhymerr,3,Tue Jul 14 18:22:15 2015 UTC,He put his hand down to help break his fall. I remember that game vividly (cost me a fantasy football matchup since I had Romo and Dez). He still ended up with a hip pointer if I'm remembering correctly.  It would have been dumb to take an injury there. Of course a player is going to try and not get hurt.

cowboys,3d80ix,status02,-11,Tue Jul 14 13:31:31 2015 UTC,"Hell no, this ain't a joke.  I would sign and trade Dez for Adrian Peterson and Minnesotas 1st round draft pick.  Dallas would be great for another 4 years if they made a move like that. Use the pick next year to draft another badass young reciever that you sign for the Rookie contract money. Then you're in good shape for another three years.  At that point Romo retires and you hopefully usher in the new QB.  See Dallas fans don't be so short sighted. Look at New England. Tom Brady was the 1 face of the franchise.  They won 4 super bowls and they're motto... next man up. Dallas is in the position to do they same thing.  Who the hell builds a team around a reciever and actually WINS?"
cowboys,3d80ix,supposedly_laid_back,6,Tue Jul 14 14:08:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're looking at this clearly. We'd still be strapped for cash taking AP's contract. So it's not like we'd be in much better shape financially. AP is basically a year removed from playing, plus we'd be paying a 30+ year old running back (big dollars), and hoping/praying that he's the AP of old. Teams would just stack the box against us since there would be no ""Dez threat"".   This ""potential"" badass rookie receiver of the future ""might"" be good but he's not going to come into the league playing better than Dez. That's just ridiculous. Who were the best rookie receivers last year? Go ahead and name them (OBJ, Watkins, etc.). Were ANY of them even close to Dez? Hell no.  So it's not about being short sighted. Even thinking long term, getting Dez under contract is the best option for the team going forward."
cowboys,3d80ix,status02,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but Odell Beckham Junior has similar numbers to Dez Bryant's, and Odell has Eli Manning throwing to him, not Romo.

cowboys,3d80ix,tiagom0702,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:31:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough and you're right. However, I would say even with the similar stats Dez produced those numbers against a lot of double teams. They didn't double team Beckham nowhere near as much Dez. Only reason I know that is because I had OBJ on my fantasy team and basically watched all of his games. But again, you're right that their stats were comparable."
cowboys,3d7hhu,J0llyR0dger,14,Tue Jul 14 02:58:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think Dez is trying to leverage this for more money at all.

cowboys,3d5pkf,I3eastmode,23,Mon Jul 13 20:21:17 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree. Dez deserves his money. He's put his life on the line every week and proved his self. Now he's protecting his biggest asset. If he goes out there in week 1 and, god forbid, hurts his back again and can never play again, and never gets his chance to earn the money he's worth he would spend his whole life regretting not waiting for the big money. As much as I want him to play, I can't be mad at a man who doesn't want to risk his career for much less than he's worth. Holding out for the big guaranteed money is the right way to go and it really doesn't make him the biggest idiot in the NFL, especially in the same off season where two players have lost a combined 3 fingers to fireworks. But I really hope it doesn't come to him holding out."
cowboys,3d5pkf,raylewisdidit,5,Mon Jul 13 23:20:23 2015 UTC,"Yea yea we all know this perspective. But there is no way we haven't even thrown him a long term deal idea.

Let alone, at 450 per year you would work 28 years to earn the amount in this years Franchise Tender alone.  I get that he stand to lose guaranteed money -not really though, as the tender is fully guaranteed the moment he signs it- but the front office has made overtures of their intent to have Dez be a lifetime Cowboy.  Neither of us know why they are stuck on terms, but this isn't the first time Roc Nation has had deals go bad because they want more that the market will prudently bear."
cowboys,3d5pkf,I3eastmode,3,Tue Jul 14 01:45:58 2015 UTC,I don't think it's just the money for him. I think he doesn't feel like his effort isn't being respected in the negotiations. And I feel your point about the average salary in Texas has nothing to do with it. He doesn't have an average job and he's not average at his job. He one of the best in one of the highest paying industries in the world.   I'm 1000% sure that he's been offered a long term contract and the reason that he hasn't signed is because he hasn't heard the correct number yet. But I can't fault him for that. He's holding out for something in the area of what he thinks he's earned.

Demonstrating to the other 52 guys that Jerry, Stephen and Jason are in charge, and that nobody - no matter how good they are - is more important than the team. Every extra dollar that goes to Dez (over and above the 2nd or 3rd largest WR contract ever, which is likely what's being offered) is a dollar that one of those 52 guys won't be earning."

cowboys,3d5pkf,I3eastmode,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:47:00 2015 UTC,"I totally understand your point but I think they all understand that Dez is arguably the best player on this team. I believe that this would alienate most other players. If they're not willing to pay Dez or Demarco, even though I think that we'd all agree that Demarco is overpaid, why would they pay me?"
cowboys,3d5pkf,Phinnegan,10,Mon Jul 13 23:26:43 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, if they overpay Dez, then they can't pay the other guys. There's only so much to go around.  FO has done the math and placed a value expressed in % of the overall cap that they believe Dez's likely future production is worth. That translates to a dollar value based on current and anticipated cap. If they go over that number, it hurts the team. If Dez gets too much of that pie, somebody else is getting none of it.  But also, the agents for guys like Frederick and Martin are watching carefully. If they see the FO getting pushed around for Dez, you can bet they'll be wanting to play hardball when their turn comes."
cowboys,3d5pkf,I3eastmode,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:33 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying but my point is that if they are so stubborn that they would let Dez and Demarco walk Frederick, martin, and other FAs won't want to negotiate at all. If you pay Dez a fair price and make sure that he's taken care of other FAs will take less money in order to play with someone like Dez. Dez isn't just a receiver, he's a leader and a superstar. He's the kind of player that other players come to win with."
cowboys,3d5pkf,Phinnegan,10,Tue Jul 14 00:21:33 2015 UTC,"If you pay Dez a fair price   This is the key. What makes you think they're not offering a ""fair"" price? And on the other side of the coin, what makes me think that Dez is asking for too much?   Dez is unarguably a top 5 receiver. It's a pretty easy argument to put him in the top 3. A strong case can be made for top 2. And you wouldn't be crazy to argue he's the best... but that's more difficult to defend.   I believe he's being offered the 2nd highest WR contract ever (in terms of guaranteed money). I also believe he's asking for the highest ever - and there's a very big gap between the two (CJ's $48m guaranteed to Mike Wallace's $27m guaranteed) I have no actual knowledge of the situation of course, but just from observing the posturing on both sides, and what is being fed to the media and when - that's where it seems to me that they are.  If we later find out that the Cowboys offer is less than $27m of guaranteed money, I'll definitely say I was wrong to doubt Dez, and the Cowboys should pay up. I believe (again, based on practically nothing - but hey, opinions are like assholes) the offer is somewhere around $33m of guarantees over 5 or 6 years of total length right now. If that's right (who knows?) I'd definitely call that fair. AND I can see Dez and his team wanting more, and putting forth a good argument to get it.  But if Dez holds out and misses games over that - then I'll blame him (which will be really hurtful to him, I'm sure)."
cowboys,3d5pkf,I3eastmode,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:40:43 2015 UTC,"Most of the things I've heard makes me believe that they're offering him a big contract with not much guaranteed. But you're right, we don't know what he was offered or what he's asking for. I'm usually on the players' side because of the lack of leverage though. If it comes out that he was asking for qb money, then I agree with you."
cowboys,3d5pkf,jlacomb17,20,Tue Jul 14 02:56:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe they want to pay him what he's worth and he wants more. If that's the case, I hope they call his bluff."

cowboys,3d5pkf,The_Impresario,2,Tue Jul 14 20:59:13 2015 UTC,"Hijacking the top comment to add that it was just suggested that the collusion allegation stems from a conversation between Dez and Stephen Jones. In that conversation Jones allegedly admitted to speaking with John Elway about Dez.   If that is true, then I'd say that Dez is not bluffing."
cowboys,3d5pkf,ImNotGayImAnActor,27,Mon Jul 13 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"Until the deadline has come and gone, this is all a play for leverage with the clock running out. Sitting games is the only leverage Dez has. He has nothing to gain from sitting games other than sending a message. But hey, the Cowboys would be stupid to just ignore that, right?  The Cowboys leverage is they don't have to get a deal done. They are comfortable paying him 12mil to play this year. Publicly, they can call his bluff. It only hurts him in the pockets, and in the eyes of the fans if he sits games.   So just don't get too caught up in the back and forth the next couple days. The time to panic is after the deadline Weds."
cowboys,3d5pkf,BatmanDavey1986,4,Mon Jul 13 19:17:34 2015 UTC,After the deadline we may as well accept he won't be there for all of camp at the very minimum.
cowboys,3d5pkf,sportsteambfan,12,Mon Jul 13 19:23:48 2015 UTC,I would rather he miss camp than be saddled with a really bad deal for the team. I'm hoping it doesn't come to that and both sides can agree to a deal that's favorable to both sides
cowboys,3d5pkf,jlacomb17,12,Mon Jul 13 19:37:50 2015 UTC,"Finally someone that gets it. People want the team to just throw money at him, but they will be upset in a few years when we can't re-sign guys like Frederick and Martin."
cowboys,3d5pkf,ImNotGayImAnActor,3,Mon Jul 13 20:29:20 2015 UTC,"No doubt. If a deal doesn't get done, he really SHOULDN'T go to camp because he won't be fined. Sure it'll suck not to have him there, competing, but at the end of the day it's not the end of the world. The true test of his commitment to this is the games, for both financial and competitive reasons."

cowboys,3d5pkf,ImNotGayImAnActor,6,Mon Jul 13 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"It's a bluff. Just like any negotiation, he's going to use any leverage he can. If he says it and Jerry believes him even a little bit, it helps him. It's just a week bluff because sitting out only hurts him."
cowboys,3d5pkf,BatmanDavey1986,0,Mon Jul 13 19:55:23 2015 UTC,He seems very steadfast. I can see him sitting out games unless they promise no franchise tag next year.
cowboys,3d5pkf,ImNotGayImAnActor,3,Mon Jul 13 19:29:04 2015 UTC,Why? What will he gain? He can't sign a new deal and the Cowboys will just franchise him again. He has no leverage.
cowboys,3d5pkf,art_con,2,Mon Jul 13 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"Bryant basically has to weigh the cost of losing money on the game checks vs. the risk of getting injured and then losing money on his next deal. He can sit out most of the season and still have it count as a year toward FA, so that's his leverage."

cowboys,3d5pkf,ImNotGayImAnActor,7,Mon Jul 13 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"He'd lose 1.5 million dollars to do that, so I would say it's a pretty big bluff. Until Wednesday both sides are going to say a lot. Dez has almost no leverage, so he's going play the only card he can."

If a team wants to pay him, the Cowboys have to option to match the offer or receive two first round draft picks as compensation.  The Cowboys have zero incentive to cave.  They will call Dez's bluff and he will either sign the offer or end up not getting paid.  I'm willing to wager that Dez needs the money more than the cowboys need him on the field."

cowboys,3d5pkf,AintSayinShit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:17:35 2015 UTC,"and in the eyes of the fans if he sits games   I understand that fans get passionate about their sports, but the thing to remember here is that Dez is not currently under contract to the Cowboys.  The Cowboys have made him an offer ""granted it's the franchise tag at this point"" and he has declined to sign that offer.  In my opinion, you can't get mad at someone for not taking a deal he doesn't think is fair."
cowboys,3d5pkf,ImNotGayImAnActor,10,Mon Jul 13 19:37:51 2015 UTC,"He has an offer on the table to play a season for 13 mil. Come week one, with two division games staring this team in the face, you will be singing a very different tune."
cowboys,3d5pkf,AintSayinShit,0,Mon Jul 13 19:40:11 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I want him out there.  But at the same time he's not under contract.  It's not right to expect someone to play for us for terms he doesn't like just because he's good and was previously under contract to us."
cowboys,3d5pkf,ImNotGayImAnActor,8,Mon Jul 13 20:19:41 2015 UTC,"The franchise tag is a specific designation under the CBA. It's the only contract he can sign after Wednesday. Legal language says he has no contract, but he's under a one year deal whether he likes it or not. Plus, there are 4 players who were tagged this offseason, so it's not like this is some cruel and unusual loophole. This shit happens every year and no one sits games."
cowboys,3d5pkf,AintSayinShit,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:24:58 2015 UTC,"Bullshit.  He is not under a one year deal whether he likes it or not.  The franchise tag means that is the deal that's on the table for him and he is not able to negotiate with other teams.  He doesn't have to sign the deal.  He can choose not to play...and he can keep choosing not to play right up until week 6 when the deadline hits and then either sign the deal or sit the rest of the season and become an unrestricted free agent next year.  Edit:  Correction, it would appear week 10 is the deadline to sign, not week 6."
cowboys,3d5pkf,ImNotGayImAnActor,7,Mon Jul 13 20:31:53 2015 UTC,He can choose not to play and not get paid. He has no other option. Then they can place the tag on him next year as well. Educate yourself on how it works.
cowboys,3d5pkf,HiveNode,16,Mon Jul 13 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"As much as I am for Dez getting paid, because he so obviously deserves it, I'll lose a sizeable amount of respect for Dez if he misses any games.  The days where Dallas overpays their star receivers are gone; sorry you got to the party late, Dez."
cowboys,3d5pkf,Washington_Fitz,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:04:58 2015 UTC,You still have less respect for Emmitt Smith?
cowboys,3d5pkf,HiveNode,9,Mon Jul 13 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"Nah, he got that contract when their wasn't a salary cap. Jerry had no reason to be responsible with money management."
cowboys,3d5pkf,Washington_Fitz,-2,Mon Jul 13 22:21:02 2015 UTC,So it is okay to sit out games when there wasn't a salary cap. Hmm... Not talking about money just the act of sitting out on your team.
cowboys,3d5pkf,HiveNode,11,Mon Jul 13 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, but Smith was worth a lot more to the team then than Dez is now. Most important position in the game back then, unarguably the best RB when he played, and never had an issue off the field."
cowboys,3d5pkf,Washington_Fitz,4,Mon Jul 13 22:27:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed,which makes it even more selfish for him to sit out. I'm not understanding your position.  You are saying it is okay for him to sit out because he was way more important to the Cowboys.  But Dez can't because he isn't as important."
cowboys,3d5pkf,HiveNode,7,Mon Jul 13 22:29:52 2015 UTC,"Dez can, but shouldn't, because he has a $13m check which is fully guaranteed to injury waiting for him. The franchise tag, and free agency, didn't exist when Emmitt sat out, so he was basically being low-balled with no other option."
cowboys,3d5pkf,Washington_Fitz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, and if he gets hurt he is screwed past this year. I just don't see how you can lose respect for Dez for doing what is best for him financially.  The Cowboys can cut people at anytime and other stuff, it's a business."
cowboys,3d5pkf,HiveNode,3,Mon Jul 13 22:37:36 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible that Dez is just being selfish. If he wants 14m/year and Dallas won't pay him that, then Dez is right to sit out. If he wants Fitz/Calvin money (both of whom are grossly overpaid), then Dez can take a seat on the couch and watch us roll over a couple teams. If he accepts the tag and has yet another season where he improves upon his last, then he's just going to be worth even more money next year. If he sits around and we keep winning, he is suddenly worth less money than before (well, unless he wants to go to a bottom feeder like the Browns or Eagles).  It's up to Dez if he wants to gamble."
cowboys,3d5pkf,wild_thingy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:46:07 2015 UTC,"How do you figure Dez is not important to us? Between him, Romo and Witten that is all the proven offense we have. I can understand the Murray situation. Running backs are a dime a dozen, but Dez Bryants don't just grow on trees."
cowboys,3d5pkf,HiveNode,2,Tue Jul 14 02:57:48 2015 UTC,"Important, but Romo is by far the most valuable piece. If we lose Romo but not Dez, how many games do we win? Maybe like 6, if we're lucky. If we lose Dez but not Romo? Could be 10 or 11."

cowboys,3d5pkf,HiveNode,10,Mon Jul 13 19:41:39 2015 UTC,"Half his Instagram posts are Roc Nation related. They definitely have an influence on him. They always push for the most player friendly deal. Not a bad thing for him, just bad for us if we want him as a Cowboys because this team of late has been making wise financial decisions and signing a wide receiver about to turn 27 to a huge long term deal is not a wise financial decision."
cowboys,3d5pkf,Dcowboys09,4,Mon Jul 13 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree on it not being a wise financial decision. As long as Dez isn't grossly overpaid, then it's fine. All that matters is signing bonus + guaranteed money, which is all paid out in the first 4-5 years of the deal. After that Dez can be cut loose with no penalty to the team. Safe to say Dez will still be balling out into his early 30s.   That's why he (and every other player) is so concerned with guaranteed money."

Second, the NFLPA and owners agreed to a CBA with a franchise tag so they exist and they will be used. Also, as of today, I love Dez and can't imagine the team without him.   With that in mind, if Dez wants to cause a scene in hopes of getting a better deal, fine. If he wants to sit out after the deadline it's basically just sabotaging the team because you're a pouting little kid. They can't renegotiate anymore.   If he pulls a Vincent Jackson and sits out 10 games he'll only cost about $4.5M for the last 6 games. Then I'd consider the bridge burned and franchise him the next season out of spite and not negotiate at all. Find a new team in 2017.   Edit: Also, my #1 preference by a long shot is for Dez to be a Cowboy for the next 6 or 7 years before we're talking about a new contract."

cowboys,3d5pkf,TexasLAWdog,8,Mon Jul 13 23:13:14 2015 UTC,"I'd tell him fuck off to be fair. No matter how good he is.  Bottom line is that the bloke should be professional and do his job. Let his agent do the deal and he should concentrate on the football. It what he pays his agent for.  If he's sitting out games I'd make him rot for the season, we'll see how good you are with a year long worth of rust on you Dez."
cowboys,3d5pkf,emackn,8,Mon Jul 13 20:16:44 2015 UTC,I'd be down for that but I'm too much of a Romoholic. Dez gives us so much for just being on the field. I don't think we could make a superbowl run without him and Romo doesn't have much time left.
cowboys,3d5pkf,TheManDapperDan,2,Tue Jul 14 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"Why would he not play?  He can't get a long term deal during the season right?  With him franchised, Doesn't he have to play under those terms for the year, and then restart the process next off-season?  Guess he could sit out for the season, but that would be the dumbest thing ever."

Does Jerry want to pay him 12 mil for another season to see if he's ""worth"" a big pay day or do they simply not think he's worth a large contract? In the meantime, is Dez saying ""pay me now or else?"" Can he play somewhere else after this season?"
cowboys,3d5pkf,krvv98,2,Mon Jul 13 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"Fuck it. Call his Bluff, I love the man and have his Jersey but I don't think any receiver is worth calvin money. Calvin isn't even worth Calvin money. I don't know what Dallas is offering him but it has to be over 12mil per year since that's what the franchise tag is. Now I'm not saying dez should settle, but why sit out games.? That hurts you and your value as much as it does the Cowboys. Childish,and the fact that jayzs agency (or whoever represents him) supports this is ridiculous"
cowboys,3d5pkf,tripplethreat88,2,Mon Jul 13 20:35:20 2015 UTC,I'm starting to not like Dez as much as I used to. All his talk of loyalty seems to have been lies. Maybe I'm just salty and still overreacting because of Murray though.

cowboys,3d5pkf,BatmanDavey1986,4,Mon Jul 13 19:04:31 2015 UTC,"He would have to sign the franchise tag contract first, which I'm pretty sure he has no intention of doing."

I don't (want to) see it getting to that point though.  EDIT: This is not correct."
cowboys,3d5pkf,alphamini,3,Mon Jul 13 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"He can't play for another team, he's been tagged.  Even if he doesn't sign it at all this year the cowboys still own him. Also there is absolutely no deal that can be reached after July 15th for this Season."
cowboys,3d5pkf,Drew56,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:55:40 2015 UTC,"I guess I misunderstood the whole concept of him refusing to sign his franchise tender. So if he doesn't sign, he's technically not under contract with anyone, but the Cowboys have exclusive rights to him for the year?"
cowboys,3d5pkf,alphamini,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:43:26 2015 UTC,That's the way I understand it.  After July 15 he has absolutely no reason not to sign it because they can't negotiate a long term contract after that anyway.    This is him going all out to get a long term contract for the year before he has no other options.  If he sits he loses millions a game with nothing at all to gain.

He's proven he is one of the best if not the best at his position. So what's the problem? And on the other hand I don't understand why Dez doesn't just shut up and play. I mean he's due for a big paycheck for this upcoming season so why not just play it out. I just don't get it....

I mean, if he wants to set an example for these young guys, it doesn't get much bigger than Dez and Stephen IS NOT Jerry. Dude might be as stingy as Mike Brown up in Cincinnati.   Plus, Romo may only play a couple more years. Maybe they are thinking about Dez being another Fitz with a 100 mil contract and year after year of no QB to get him the ball. And, wasn't it when Dez broke his ankle that they picked up Laurent Robinson as an unknown and Romo had him looking like a true #1. After that he got paid and where is he now? You have to consider that the FO just might think Romo could win with the WRs in camp. o_0"
cowboys,3d5pkf,DonMakaveli,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:13:03 2015 UTC,So he wants to sit out on his final year and not get paid $12 million? That is some huge money. You know he needs to rethink that. If he has a great year. Teams will line up next season and want to pay him a lot more. Sitting out just hurts your future commodity. Dallas should sign him now or else face losing him next year.
cowboys,3d5pkf,GatorDontPlayThatSht,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:40:49 2015 UTC,"From a financial standpoint, this makes no sense for Dez. Even if he does, God forbid, sit this season out, he'll have lost a substantial amount of leverage. If he were to put up a monster year this coming season, it wouldn't be too surprising to see him get offers in the $17MM-$20MM range as a free agent. By sitting out, teams won't be nearly as likely to shell out a long term deal for a guy who's just sat out of football for an entire season and is getting closer to the age of 30(He'll be 28 next November)."

If you want to act like a spoiled kid, then you will lose fan support. We were the one organization that was equipped (and we were willing) to take on his off the field issues/maturity issues and we've stood by him and Jerry has done things for him that most players would never have done by their owners. This team has nurtured and supported him through everything and this is how he repays?  For all of you saying he deserves his money, do you really think that Jerry isn't offering him a VERY GOOD deal? Maybe it's not his ideal offer, but I can't imagine that it's not a VERY GOOD contract offer.   And furthermore.....can you see Roger Staubach acting like this? How about Troy Aikman? Tony Romo? Yes Emmitt Smith did, but he was able to use a minute amount of leverage (missing just a couple of games) without having to use a nuclear option of sitting out a season.   I still don't believe that Dez sits out, he loves football too much to do that and if he's willing to sit out a whole year (or more) then I don't want him on my football team to start with because winning with this group of guys isn't that important to him."
cowboys,3d5pkf,DashThePunk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"I don't buy that he won't play for one bit. If the stories of Dez being strapped for money are true, he's giving up $800,000 every game he misses. He can't sign a new deal at that point anyways."
cowboys,3d5pkf,IMStealthy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot if people are forgiving Dez or saying they understand stand him, because he's a Cowboy. If another player acted like this on a different team, he would be called a traitor and selfish by the people supporting Dez.  If Dez is asking for too much money and won't compromise, then let him walk (or whatever the equivalent of that is at this point). Lately the cowboys have been trying to build a team of people that care about the sport and the team, not the money. That's why they didn't chase down Murrey right?  I get it. Dez it one of the best receivers right now, but I personally don't think he's worth this drama. Sure, it would be harder to win, but not impossible.  I hope a good deal for both sides happens at the end of all this."

Dez deserves to be paid at the price that the market sets. In the open market he would likely get Megatron money. If you can get him for less than that because this offseason you get to hold the extremely unfair ""Fuck you Tag"" over his head, then good for you.  But Dez is under no obligation to take less than what the market will bear, and anyone who suggests he should is wrong.  He's been nothing but a great leader, team player, and of course one the best players in the game.  He deserves to have his future secured.  If they force him to walk, and thus lose the NFL leading rusher and receiving touchdown leader in the same offseason, I'm out."
cowboys,3d5pkf,cowboyup12,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"First, the franchise tag used on Dez Bryant is non exclusive, which means he can negotiate with other teams. Nobody is throwing at him the deal he wants so he can go fuck himself in this situation. He has almost 0 leverage and he has two options: sit out and decrease his own value and miss almost 2 years (there's no way the Cowboys don't franchise tag him next hear if there's no deal until tomorrow), or he can play and continue to battle for a deal as good as he wants.   Second, the franchise tags are not that unfair. The players have accepted it so they can't whine against it.   Third, most people are on the ownership side because we would prefer to have Dez tagged two years in a row and then let him walk (he'll be 27 by then and we all know what will happen) rather than having Dez on a deal that hurts then team's future. I thought all Cowboys fans had already learned from the past when we gave crazy deals to our star receivers!"

We have a very promising team going into this season and he wants to jeopardize that to be a selfish bitch. Fuck him. Let him sit it. Next man up then we can draft a wr first round next year.

Street has soft hands and has said to be a good route runner while Williams has speed and makes big plays at key moments of a game. Swole Beastly and Witten are two great 3rd down targets. Maybe they go with more 2 tight end packages with Escobar. He had a huge game against New York last season so he can produce if given the chance. Losing Dez for any amount of time would be bad but I feel confident we will still succeed without him.
cowboys,3da08l,InconditeMudlark,6,Tue Jul 14 17:52:38 2015 UTC,"While I agree with what you're saying, a lot of that has to do with Dez getting doubled."
cowboys,3da08l,SeaworldOE,2,Tue Jul 14 19:46:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think we lose some of our explosive plays. And maybe a little quieter on the sidelines when we're behind."
cowboys,3d9vfo,BrandonGowton,4,Tue Jul 14 17:06:45 2015 UTC,I am going to suggest that maybe Eagles fans don't have the best intentions for the Cowboys organization long term.
cowboys,3d9vfo,trillustrator,5,Tue Jul 14 17:15:47 2015 UTC,"""dear dez, either don't play or take up all of dallas' cap space so they can't build a team around you and tony"" - eagles fans everywhere  The FO isn't being cheap, they are trying to leave space to build a team, we're spending draft picks on offensive linemen to build a running game, we're finally playing smart financially, sure Megatron gets paid a shit-ton but what rings does he have to show for it, I'm all for paying dez, he deserves it, but not at the cost of crippling our cap space and costing us players that could help dez get a ring or two (or three, please god) within the timeframe covered under his new contract, Tim Duncan repeatedly takes paycuts because he wants the spurs to be able to afford other contributing players for title seasons, dez is the best receiver playing the game now, but i feel he may have a little to learn from the best power foward of all time"
cowboys,3d9vfo,a594109,4,Tue Jul 14 17:57:51 2015 UTC,"basketball contracts are fully guaranteed, so it's not that big of a deal taking a paycut for him. from what I've read, that's the issue with dez's contract is not that they aren't offering him enough anually, it's that he wants more guaranteed money. 1 play and his career could be over, he's looking out for his long term future. can't blame him"
cowboys,3d9vfo,xeneize368,3,Tue Jul 14 19:56:51 2015 UTC,"Also, one play and his career could be over. So the front office has to be smart and not overpay."
cowboys,3d9vfo,jlacomb17,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:35:20 2015 UTC,And Dez has to be smart and demand his worth.
cowboys,3d9vfo,fisherjoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:44:24 2015 UTC,"the problem with that is that part of football contracts are indeed guaranteed. should they all be fully guaranteed? sure, but I don't necessarily see anything wrong with incentive bonuses.   And it's really not easy to compare contracts across sports, especially when there are 5 times as many players in the nfl as the nba sharing roughly half the revenue."
cowboys,3d9vfo,Antilles_Fel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:31:17 2015 UTC,"""dear dez, either don't play or take up all of dallas' cap space so they can't build a team around you and tony"" - eagles fans everywhere   That sounds kind of ludicrous, especially considering how absolutely stacked we are right now. Eagles fans just realize Dez deserves money and long term at this point in his career. And the nfl is very different than the NBA (also fuck you for not using Dirk in this example). Tim Duncan has been playing for an eternity and has earned more money than Dez in one year than in Dez's entire career. Best believe no prime NBA player is taking cuts like that. We have the roster to win a superbowl, or at the very least had last year. Dez getting paid isn't going to prevent us from being able to win."
cowboys,3d9vfo,fisherjoe,2,Tue Jul 14 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"technically Lebron, wade, and bosh all took cuts to play with each other in miami. And I don't think anyone would label us as ""stacked."" Our defense was decidedly average last year and while hopefully better, probably won't be dominant. Our offense is indeed stacked, but that would point towards not overpaying for dez."
cowboys,3d9vfo,Antilles_Fel,0,Tue Jul 14 23:32:55 2015 UTC,"I would label us as stacked, even if it is mostly on offense. We are gaining Hardy, Gregory, Jones, and Lee as improvements from various positions last year. I have some questions at a few positions but we're about as stacked as you can be.  And like I said the NBA is different. Bosh and Lebron have max deals, Lebron will command such for a long time, and even Wade at 33 is asking for max. Dez gets one shot at a career contract. 4 years from now he will be paid less."
cowboys,3d9vfo,fisherjoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:42:49 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree on the stacked definition. but yeah, he has one shot, the unfortunate part is that he wants the contract guaranteed for much longer than 4 years, which is bad business.  And I was talking several years ago arguably in their primes they took pay cuts, but yeah they have a very different situation in the NBA, and Lebron is by far the best player on the planet, don't think you can say that for Dez"
cowboys,3d9vfo,Antilles_Fel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:02:50 2015 UTC,"NBA players can make much more than NFL players in general with less chance of career ending injury, more money in general, longer careers in general and more player friendly contracts. Lebron, Wade, Bosh, Duncan, Dirk. That's way they were okay with taking cuts."

cowboys,3d9vfo,ThadCastle_,2,Tue Jul 14 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this will set a big precedent for skill positions in the future so I'm interested as a football fan to see it happen. Also, yeah it's not hard to see that Dez deserves to get paid and obviously wants to stay on the Cowboys. Jerry should take care of his own"
cowboys,3d9vfo,dsol1,2,Tue Jul 14 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"The worst thing about Jerry as a GM is that he ALWAYS takes care of his own, to the detriment of the salary cap and the teams future. I like the way they have been moving the past few years. They offer to pay the players full market value and they don't bend to any pressure."
cowboys,3d9vfo,jlacomb17,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:37:02 2015 UTC,Jerry makes a lot of stupid decisions when it comes to WR's.  Taking care of Roy Williams and not Dez wouldn't surprise me.  I'd be pretty peeved about it.
cowboys,3d9vfo,nerdvernacular,0,Tue Jul 14 21:50:46 2015 UTC,"He has never not taken care of a player. If this deal doesn't get done, it's on Dez. Jerry has a 26 year track record of paying players what they are worth. The Cowboys will offer Dez a fair deal, he just might not accept it."
cowboys,3d9vfo,jlacomb17,2,Tue Jul 14 21:56:02 2015 UTC,"Worth is relative.  Dez is arguably as good as Calvin, so his agent wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't ask for that sort of contract.  I doubt Jerry offered that much."
cowboys,3d9vfo,nerdvernacular,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:19:21 2015 UTC,Eagles want us to overpay Dez so they have something to throw back at us when we point out that Murray is worth quite a bit less than the ole Chipster paid him.

Dez is a damn good receiver, and he'll be worth the money, but boy is he going to fuck up your cap space. If they give him a $17MM/yr contract, you guys are going to be paying your top 5 guys 41% of the cap this year. That nice OL you got? If you think you're going to be able to pay them, then I'm afraid I've got some bad news."

cowboys,3d6psc,jlacomb17,3,Tue Jul 14 01:37:08 2015 UTC,They could make a ton of money too. Charge $100 for a home team collectors edition. That's like a 30% mark up without changing much.
cowboys,3d6psc,I3eastmode,3,Tue Jul 14 02:25:24 2015 UTC,"I think it might work if they did it once, but I don't see a lot of folks shelling out extra cash every year for the fancy editions. Maybe a limited release depending on fanbase size, like 25k copies for the Cowboys, 2k copies for the Buccs, and everyone else somewhere in between.  From a distribution point of view, it's a nightmare, but if they kept it as an online-order-only thing, I think there's a way to make it work.   I still maintain the novelty would wear off fast, they do make this game every year, after all.  Edit: And on that note, I'd rather we DIDN'T have our star quarterback on the cover, if the Madden Curse has anything to say. Put someone we have depth at on the front of that voodoo."

cowboys,3d6psc,andrewrapp,3,Tue Jul 14 02:50:45 2015 UTC,Weddle and his beard would have been perfect. And Terrell Suggs in his gladiator mask.
cowboys,3d6psc,WalrusRider,3,Tue Jul 14 04:11:46 2015 UTC,Agree! Isn't Ed Reed retired? I think Sizzle or Flacco would be more appropriate. Manti Te'o hasn't made enough of an impact to warrant cover status when the Chargers have Filipe Rios and Weddle.  Jordan Matthews for the Eagles seems premature. I'd pick Kahlil Mack over Derek Carr for the Raiders.
cowboys,3d6psc,ArizonaSecrets,2,Tue Jul 14 14:10:00 2015 UTC,Ed reed did retire and he was on the Texans last anyways. It'd make more sense to put Suggs or flacco on the cover. I'm not sure how rivers wasn't on the Chargers cover or either Antonio gates.

cowboys,3d7bnr,oldboot,9,Tue Jul 14 02:11:17 2015 UTC,"Of all those receivers you mention, here are some things to consider.  Moss was no longer in his prime when the patriots got rid of him in 2010. The patriots saw that and moved on. They do it to a lot of key players, regardless of position.  Ben roethlisberger made mike Wallace look good. He's a one trick pony.   Brandon Marshall was a head case in Denver, and not worth the risk.  However, franchise receivers like dez Bryant don't grow on trees. Without dez, the Cowboys don't have the same success. Franchise players are rare. You keep your own, as long as it's affordable. You don't run the risk of letting them loose, because the odds of finding any franchise player at any position are slim to none. He's a player that you build your team around. Those are rare.   You invest in known commodities in their primes, not get rid of them. Without dez, the WRs. Dez Bryant's presence opens things up for the offense. Williams, Beasley Escobar have the success they have from the presence dez Bryant.   He's one of the best in the game if not the best. Calvin Johnson is bound to slow down soon. There will be about three seasons where dez Bryant will be the undisputed number one receiver. He's a touchdown machine. Do you want to let that go? This isn't exactly like investing in murray who had 400+ touches last season."
cowboys,3d7bnr,zsxecorp,3,Tue Jul 14 02:34:30 2015 UTC,"Your post is more applicable to a team that doesn't have several franchise players already. Our whole offensive line are franchise players, we have a franchise QB, a franchise TE, a couple of franchise players on D (CB, DE, LB). We can afford to keep Dez and definitely should, he's a huge difference maker, but I still think we can win games without him."
cowboys,3d7bnr,HiveNode,3,Tue Jul 14 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"Another thing to take into account is how Cowboys players talk all the time how practice isn't the same without Dez.

cowboys,3d7bnr,Runna4life,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:06:58 2015 UTC,"Scandrick and, though a rental, Hardy bring that on D. I suppose nobody really brings that on O besides Dez; Romo and Witten are both respected leaders but they lead in a different way."

cowboys,3d7bnr,boilerblaze,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:09:56 2015 UTC,I thought we had most of our oline locked up for at least 4 years? If so I don't think it'll be as hard to resign them as you're anticipating.   If I'm wrong though it could definitely make things tricky but oline doesn't make the numbers that skill players do so I don't anticipate losing more than 1 of them.   Edit: plus under the new cba the salary cap increases every year which would make it easier.
cowboys,3d7bnr,zsxecorp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:04:55 2015 UTC,"i dont' want to let it go no, but I think that a CJ type contract is more detrimental to long term success for the team, than having Dez."

cowboys,3d7bnr,mister_james_halpert,0,Tue Jul 14 02:35:53 2015 UTC,"I think this helps the point of letting Dez walk, however. If the cowboys hadn't busted their cap by 1999 trying to keep the stars together, they would have had a much better all around team and have been able to sustain an injury to a reciever. Dez getting a huge contract makes it difficult to acquire and keep other star players as well as quality depth, thereby makeing us an average team, and making it devestating if he gets hurt and misses time."
cowboys,3d7bnr,mister_james_halpert,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:12:09 2015 UTC,"Signing any player to a huge contract, and then them getting hurt would be devastating. With the cap due to rise, players like dez, Crawford, Martin, and Frederick can all be affordable."

In fact this is a great change from the profligate days in which Jerry threw money at free agents.  Plus, the fact that Bryant will be getting paid the average of the top 5 WRs in the game means he's not getting peanuts.  Also, of course, he will earn over the next year more than a large number of us will earn in our lives.    Plus historically WR output begins to decline at 27, which Bryant will turn this year.    So I do see the value in the strategy of franchising him, then possibly franchising him again next year.    However, I also see the situation from Dez's perspective: he may only get one shot at guaranteed money, and he doesn't want to miss it.  He thinks he's earned it; he's definitely one of the best WRs in the game, and he probably wants to feel recognized as such financially.  Plus, as some said back when he changed agents, his current agency is known for playing hard-ball with contracts.    And there are times for teams to be cheap and times at which teams must pay market value.  But I still don't mind that the Cowboys are being conservative."

With that being said, my guess is the FO is bookmarking 2017/18 as a restructuring year(s) - they'll either get Dez to agree to a four year deal, or franchise him this year and next and try to make a superbowl run in those two years."
cowboys,3d56p7,sag969,4,Mon Jul 13 18:45:07 2015 UTC,"Beach, your opinion may not be popular among those who want beloved Cowboys to stay, no matter what, simply because they're beloved.  But I think we'll see the problem with that approach with respect to Murray this year.  I've been pretty happy w/how the front office has handled its business since Garrett became HC.  In fact the only personnel issue that has troubled me was its handling of Orton--but that may have been due to details that weren't public knowledge.  Jerry used to pay guys a lot because he loved them.  That almost never worked out.  Now they'll only pay a guy a lot if they have to.  They don't have to yet with Dez, and as impressive as his performance and growth have been over the years, he's approaching the age at which WRs' output traditionally declines.    So the Cowboys clearly are attempting to apply analysis to these otherwise emotional decisions.  It's a good approach.  They may get burned occasionally (say if Dez walks in 2 years).  But in 2 years Dez will be 28 going on 29.  And while what I'm about to say makes old-timers (like me) shake our heads in wonder, 29 for a WR in the NFL is old."
cowboys,3d56p7,mushpuppy,6,Mon Jul 13 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"29 for any position in the NFL is old.    Michael Irvin had his best season for the Cowboys at 29.  Terrel Owens had 6 more 1000+ yard seasons after he turned 29.  Owens could have kept on producing if he hadn't been a prima donna.    Michael Irvin would have kept on producing if he hadn't had a career ending neck injury (e.g., a freak injury).    And today's receivers don't take near the violent hits that receivers were taking 5 or 10 years ago, much less 15 years ago.  I'm not in the sign Dez at any cost camp, because I think Romo has shown time and time again the ability to be successful with just-a-guy receivers, but Dez isn't necessarily on the verge of a production fall-off cliff."

Also, i'm with you, if he misses games... that is accomplishing nothing becuase he can't negotiate anyway at that point, is literally just abandoning his teammates and his fans....that is disgusting...i wouldn't want him back either. For the record, I think this is just negotiation pandering... but if he does this, then fuck him, we should get rid of  him."
cowboys,3d56p7,oldboot,2,Mon Jul 13 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"Ah they just love guys and sometimes tend to view teams as static, with ageless players.  It's only over time that, as fans age, we come to recognize that players do too, that teams actually are simply logos, colors, and collective memories of joy and pain.  When even the most fanatical supporters have time to think about it, they often recognize the validity of what you're saying.  I think it's simply human to want our heroes never to age."

cowboys,3d56p7,oldboot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:31:55 2015 UTC,"True. Except for the fact that 3 years might be all we have, because as soon as Romo is gone (I don't even wanna think about it) we will suck until we find our next franchise QB. So question is do we risk crippling our franchise 5 years down the road to win a superbowl now? Or bet on him playing disgruntled yet still productive for 2 years? I'm just glad I'm not Steven to be honest.."

cowboys,3d4xm0,yaychristy,7,Mon Jul 13 16:06:49 2015 UTC,I grabbed it from here. The total cost plus shipping was 20 something dollars.

cowboys,3d5o29,_xander_ball,2,Mon Jul 13 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"Well, I think most of those were signed AFTER Romo signed his deal, which doesn't surprise me. Agents use existing deals all the time to build framework for larger deals, so it makes sense. Because of his age, he has no room to re-negotiate much either."
cowboys,3d5o29,ImNotGayImAnActor,3,Mon Jul 13 19:30:09 2015 UTC,"Romo does have decent leverage to renegotiate, seeing as his cap hit takes off the next few seasons and he's practically uncuttable till 2018. So the issue at his point is less about total contract value and more about the proration on it, the fact that so much over the years has been converted to signing bonuses which basically guarantees him more money."
cowboys,3d5o29,MrJoobJoob,3,Mon Jul 13 20:12:35 2015 UTC,"But Romo has 3-4 years max left to actually play. He can't get an extension, like Big Ben or Matt Ryan did. He's going to play out this contract and that is likely it for him."

cowboys,3d52o2,squatreferee69,7,Mon Jul 13 16:16:37 2015 UTC,McFadden & Randle mix. Keeps them both rested and ready to go.  Dunbar back-up.
cowboys,3d52o2,bp1108,10,Mon Jul 13 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"Joseph Randle will be the lead guy. In limited touches, he's been just fine and will show why Dallas trusts him as a starter. He averaged over 5+ yards at OK State and scored 40+ TD's in only 3 years. I have friends that are OKST fans and he was a TD machine with a knack for finding the end zone.  Darren McFadden will compliment well to ensure Randle doesn't have to carry the ball a ridiculous amount of times per game. He's looked good in camp and I fully expect him to make an immediate impact.  Lance Dunbar will continue to be used as a 'specialist' on 3rd downs and will line up as a HB and in the slot. Dallas should look to get him in space and make people miss as he's shown flashes of. Think Darren Sproles with the Saints...  Unfortunately, I think Ryan Williams affirmed the 'can't stay healthy' label and won't make the team, which is a shame bc he could be the best back on the team.  We'll be fine at RB this year.   Now please give Dez his long term deal and pay up!"
cowboys,3d52o2,smellaroma,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:37 2015 UTC,Go Pokes baby!
cowboys,3d52o2,SeaworldOE,3,Tue Jul 14 19:41:13 2015 UTC,What really made the cowboys contenders last year was the run game. Above all else including a very improved defense. Dallas managed to control the clock all year. Romo played better because of it. The defense played better because of it. I would have them ranked in the order OP has them. Right now it looks to be a timeshare between Randle and McFadden. I'm not sold as believers in them. They will have the best line in football so we will have to wait until week one to really see.
cowboys,3d52o2,_Cowboys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:45:19 2015 UTC,"I just don't see McFadden producing...I think they'll end up trying him to start the season and he'll slowly fade away until Randle gets the majority of the carries.  I'd like to see more of Ryan Williams in the pre-season because Randle and Dunbar would take a beating as every down back.  However, in saying all of this I would love to see McFadden prove me wrong and put up some numbers for us."
cowboys,3d52o2,EasyDezit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:07:02 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSK_uHVW78s  He can pass too!
cowboys,3d52o2,daemon616,-1,Sun Jul 19 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"I want Randle as my starter. He's got the ability to get 4 or 5 yards on first down and potentially break a big one every now and then. However, he couldn't handle the workload that Demarco had last season. But he is good enough to pick up the first on 3rd and short.   McFadden has the ability to do what Randle did last year. If he has limited touches, maybe toward the end of long drives, he has a huge chance to break off massive runs in my opinion. He absolutely should be used in passing situations though. He can square up and block well enough to keep Romo on his feet.  I still like Dunbar being the number 3 guy. Plus his pass catching ability gives him a good chance to make some plays.  As for Seastrunk and Williams, I will have to see how they do in training camp before really decided on them."
cowboys,3d52o2,Rush2112AW,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"Darren McFadden does not have ball carrier vision, he sucked when his team tried to implement a zone scheme, he's never healthy, and he has averaged under 4 YPC behind the same line that his other RBs did better. He wasn't even the starter on the Raiders, consistently getting beaten out. No thank you."
cowboys,3d52o2,verossiraptors,5,Mon Jul 13 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"he's never healthy   He's missed, on average, only ~1.4 games per season more than DeMarco Murray.   he has averaged under 4 YPC behind the same line that his other RBs did better   That's a little misleading. a) He actually averaged MORE than 4 yards per carry during his 7 seasons with the Raiders. b) There was only one season where another RB had a better YPC on a similar number of carries, and that was during a year where he missed 6 games due to injury. That's like faulting Murray for having a lower YPC than Randle last year on way more carries."
cowboys,3d52o2,armadachamp,-3,Mon Jul 13 17:25:03 2015 UTC,"He's missed, on average, only ~1.4 games per season more than DeMarco Murray.   Yeah...and Demarco Murray was shit at being healthy which means McFadden was even worse. Telling me he's even worse than McFadden doesn't make me feel any better.  Over the last 3 years he's averaged under 3.5ypc. Last year, he had the same ypc as trent richardson."
cowboys,3d52o2,verossiraptors,5,Mon Jul 13 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"Over the last 3 years he's averaged under 3.5ypc. Last year, he had the same ypc as trent richardson.   He was nearly 2 tenths of a point better than Richardson behind only the 24th best run-blocking line according to PFF (they graded Indy as the 13th best). You're also comparing one of McFadden's worst season-YPC averages with one that matches Richardson's career average. That's a bit of a stretch comparison."
cowboys,3d52o2,armadachamp,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:44:45 2015 UTC,But it's not one of his worst career averages. He is in a stretch of production that extends all the way back to 2012. 3 years of under 3.5ypc. That's not encouraging.

So can we incorporate that Tecmo Bowl helmet, the landry Snoo and some of the other designs together to mock up a t-shirt?

Bailey was the first jersey I ever bought. Get a lot of heckling for wearing a kicker's jersey but I love me some King Bailey. He seemed a bit off towards the end of the season last year so hoping he's back to normal this year.
cowboys,3d235i,kisstroyer,9,Sun Jul 12 22:20:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no. We regretted it immediately.   Those hecklers are just jealous they don't have the most accurate kicker in NFL history on their team. I actually got my husband a Bailey jersey last season. He wears it more often than his Bryant jersey, so you aren't alone in your support of Bootenant Dan. Hopefully it brings him good luck this year."

cowboys,3d235i,kisstroyer,2,Mon Jul 13 03:38:16 2015 UTC,Now I'm torn between King Bailey or Bootenant Dan. Long as he doesn't end up like Lt Dan I guess we can have both :D
cowboys,3d235i,kisstroyer,2,Mon Jul 13 03:53:02 2015 UTC,"Only ignorant plebeians would mistake his name for ""Lieutenant Dan"".  ""King Bailey"" definitely grants the man the praise and honor he deserves, given his greatness. In my opinion, ""Bootenant Dan"" is more original (kudos to the guy who came up with that) and suggests his fighting spirit, if you will. Needless to say, they're both great."
cowboys,3d235i,GoingPole2Pole,2,Mon Jul 13 14:09:53 2015 UTC,long as he doesn't end up like Lt Dan    Was referring to Forrest Gump in which Lieutenant Dan lost both his legs :/ i assume Lieutenant Dan was the inspiration behind Bootenant Dan :P

cowboys,3d235i,Drugs_and_Hugs,11,Sun Jul 12 23:04:47 2015 UTC,"It was actually pretty amazing. The credit all goes to my husband – a die hard Cowboys fan.  We were walking through the mall rather briskly, but somehow my husband caught a glance of a guy about his size and stature walking towards us. After a quick double-take of the passing guy, there was a sudden rush of suspicion. Immediately we did the whole, ""Wait, was that...? No, it couldn't be. But that's about how tall he is..."". We continued walking for a few more seconds before my husband's curiosity and excitement convinced us to turn around and find out if it was indeed Dan Bailey. What did we have to lose anyway?   We managed to catch up to him, despite fighting against the current of several shoppers. Once we were out in the open and about 10 feet away from the legend, my husband called out ""Bailey!"" trying to be as discreet as one could while yelling. There was a moment of silence. We stood motionless, hopefully awaiting the guy to respond to the call. The suspense continued to build. The guy finally turned around, looking for whoever called out. My husband walked over to him and asked if he was Dan Bailey. And indeed he was."

This season is different. I don't feel really excited. What I do feel is very certain. The Cowboys are going to the playoffs this year, and they will not stop in the first round. That is all I could ask for right now."
cowboys,3d11pm,Legit_Apple,6,Sun Jul 12 20:07:40 2015 UTC,I'm cautiously optimistic. Our defense exceeded expectations last year and has improved a lot this year. The reason I'm putting cautiously is that without murray no one really knows exactly how our running back situation is going to work out. I think randle and DMC can do fine but who knows with DMC's health and how randle will do with more of the work load than last year.

I just had a feeling that we will do it. But with that being said ....  Our offense last season thrived on the run game. A lot of that was on Murray and a lot of that was on the offensive line as well. The big questions going into the season are how well will our run game be and can our running backs stay healthy enough. The second question is will our offense line stay dominant without Bill Callahan?

cowboys,3d11pm,oiadscient,2,Sun Jul 12 19:39:22 2015 UTC,We started off very weak in the beginning of the season and much of it had to do with Romo  being rusty from previous injuries. I think that's our biggest weakness -- we need Romo to stay healthy.   I think the biggest factor to promote a healthy Romo will be the run game and the defense.
cowboys,3d11pm,lurkingallday,2,Sun Jul 12 18:46:25 2015 UTC,I haven't been this excited to see Dallas D on the field since Parcells's pups matured into rabid grizzlies. I'll reserve my judgement for the offense until I see the RBBC click and Dez be a happy rich monster.

My god, we nearly embarrassed many teams (sometimes masked by very poor mistakes we made evening the match).  Our running sans Murray was quite good and not something I really worry about.  Our D was occasionally dynamic and with all the new and returning pieces back, I think it will shine.  Always remember the Sean Lee interception stat.  There's no reason not to be bursting with optimism with the load of distinguished young talent we have coupled with the Garrett-Marinelli generals.  It's all about playing hard."

A runningback by committee can succeed with this offensive line. Defense, im more optimistic about, i just worry about how many games sean lee will play. If its 12+, we can have a top 10 defense.

cowboys,3cyips,Leonbethyname,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:41:08 2015 UTC,No.  Super Bowls are 100% a TEAM achievement and using them to evaluate individual players is the dumbest thing that happens in these types of discussions.

cowboys,3cyips,HiveNode,11,Sun Jul 12 05:35:57 2015 UTC,"As of now, he is definitely ahead of Moon, who is basically ""muh racism"" the quarterback.    ??? No he's not.   He made 9 Pro Bowls, won Offensive Player of the Year, retired with the 3rd most passing yards, 4th most passing TDs, and 3rd most completed passes of all time, and his numbers stack up favorably with other HOF QBs of his era like Fouts and Elway (minus the rings).  You can argue that he was the beneficiary of a pass happy system (like Fouts was), but for a QB in the 80s/90s, the production was undeniably there for him to be considered an all time great. By attributing his fame to ""muh racism"" rather than his objectively elite accomplishments, you're making his race a bigger issue than the people who support him ever did."

cowboys,3cyips,Doctor_Worm,15,Mon Jul 13 13:26:05 2015 UTC,"I think the moment when I decided that I was ride-or-die for Romo was the 2006 Thanksgiving game against Tampa Bay.

First people thought I was nuts, then (logical) people began to catch up but say there's still at least 5 better than him, and now it's reality. I fucking love Romo, and even if in the next year I land my dream job, meet my dream girl, win the lottery and then cheat on my dream girl for a foursome with Scarlett Johansson, Katy Perry and Katrina Bowden, my life won't be complete until I see Romo and Witten hoist that Lombardi Trophy."

cowboys,3cyips,forreal_dude,2,Mon Jul 13 08:19:30 2015 UTC,"For me it was one of the next games against the Redskins. I vividly remember him in the redzone, in the 4th quarter, desperately trying to win the game despite being injured. He threw the ball to Ogletree, but Ogletree ran the wrong route.

cowboys,3cyips,TheAngryCowboy,2,Mon Jul 13 21:38:35 2015 UTC,"Already under terrible scrutiny, Tony Romo walks into Buffalo and posts 6 turnovers (5 INT, 1 FUM) on a Monday night. In a game - on the road/under the spotlight - in which he could have easily folded; he never gives up, keeps ""plugging away"", and Dallas hangs around just long enough to sneak out of Ralph Wilson Stadium with a win.  I had always liked Romo up to that point. Anybody who couldn't see how much better he was than the garbage we had been recently serving up at the QB position, was (and may still be) a damn fool. He became one of my favorite Cowboys of all-time that Monday night, in Buffalo."
cowboys,3cyips,markarie,2,Sun Jul 12 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"That Monday night game was incredible, and it's a perfect glimpse at what we used to call the Romo coaster. I've been a fan of the guy for a long time, but after meeting him at Pebble Beach a couple of years ago and finding out how genuine he is in person, he has become one of my all time favorites. I'll be very sad when it's time for him to hang up the cleats, and I really hope it doesn't happen before he gets a Lombardi."

cowboys,3cwzcw,unknown_name,40,Sat Jul 11 14:43:20 2015 UTC,"As he should.  The precedent has been set at 2 games.  The NFL used an anchoring tactic by setting the suspension to 10 so that when in got reduced to 4 it looks significant.  However, that 4 game suspension is still double what he should have received."
cowboys,3cwzcw,Slayer1791,15,Sat Jul 11 15:01:07 2015 UTC,That's not even including the 14 games he sat on the exempt list.
cowboys,3cwzcw,blablabla9876,8,Sat Jul 11 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"Hardy was paid for it and part of being on the exempt list, I believe, is that the player and team agree to him being placed on it.  I don't think the NFLPA will be making an argument, if this goes further, that touches on that issue.  They didn't mention it at all in their contempt filing.  ETA: I don't care about internet points, but if someone has an issue with what I'm saying, they should probably just say something about it."
cowboys,3cwzcw,sighclone,8,Sat Jul 11 15:50:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, under the current bylaws that's the way it is and it's something they just have to accept. Doesn't make it right."
cowboys,3cwzcw,blablabla9876,5,Sat Jul 11 16:07:54 2015 UTC,"Didn't Adrian Peterson being on the exempt list get his suspension overturned by a judge? That was what the whole ""not being given a chance to apply his trade"" thing was about? If I'm remembering this right, then Hardy absolutely should use that point, too."
cowboys,3cwzcw,Differoba,4,Sat Jul 11 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"Just rechecked the decision and I don't believe it mentions that argument.  The NFL and the NFLPA, (the latter on Peterson's behalf) agreed to put him on the list."
cowboys,3cwzcw,sighclone,3,Sat Jul 11 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't follow the Peterson thing, I just heard people talking about it. I remember hearing that argument, but I don't know how effective it was."
cowboys,3cwzcw,Differoba,2,Sat Jul 11 18:47:22 2015 UTC,The argument involving that AP had was that it was insinuated the time on the exempt list would count toward time served IIRC.
cowboys,3cwzcw,MrHighlight,3,Sat Jul 11 22:24:19 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what was the 2-game precedent? Ray Rice?"
cowboys,3cwzcw,kylerm42,9,Sat Jul 11 17:26:09 2015 UTC,"That and dozens other suspensions.  Take a look at the list, mainly the personal conduct stemming from domestic violence.  Most are 1 game.  Not listed are all the first time offenders that didn't even get suspended.  You can see just how out of policy 10 games was under the old system and how 4 would even be considered high."
cowboys,3cwzcw,Slayer1791,4,Sat Jul 11 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"So...I'm no expert, please someone help me. If he appeals it and it is not finished (trial drags on maybe...is there a chance of this?) by the time he can play those two games, what then?"
cowboys,3cwzcw,Bandoozle,3,Sat Jul 11 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"If he gets an injunction against the suspension, whenever the injunction is lifted, he will have to stay out of however many games the judge decides (2 to 4). So it could come mid-season, or later."
cowboys,3cwzcw,sfoxy,3,Sat Jul 11 15:46:02 2015 UTC,And if this goes into the season does he play during the injunction or go to exempt?
cowboys,3cwzcw,Bandoozle,3,Sat Jul 11 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"an injunction would suspend the.. suspension, during the duration of the injunction. Once the injunction is over, the suspension starts (for whatever duration)  can't speak to the CBA's terms regarding the exempt list, but I'm pretty sure that is only used before a punishment has been determined."
cowboys,3cwzcw,Differoba,3,Sat Jul 11 19:10:02 2015 UTC,"He would likely file an injunction. That would allow him to play until the new punishment is ruled. He would serve the suspension starting when the ruling is made.   How could this affect the Cowboys? Well, to start, we'd have him to start the season for the Eagles and Giants games, which would be great. But, he could have to serve a suspension later in the season, during a playoff push or worse, a playoff run. That could end up as well as  the suspension getting reduced to 2, 1, or possibly 0 games during the stretch that we play the Buccaneers, Dolphins, Panthers and  Redskins. Or it could end as badly as losing him for 4 games, starting with the Bills or Packers games or during that stretch where we play the Patriots, Giants, Seahawks and Eagles.  As you can see, there's a lot to think about. It would be a high risk, high reward situation. It'll be interesting to see what they do."

Schefter was mostly respected and the Dez Bryant thing was ridiculous. Basically, Schefter ""confirmed"" that a video may or may not exist of the incident. What does that even mean? He milked that story like it was the next Ray Rice during the time the Cowboys franchised tagged him. Then, nothing. The story just died. The JPP thing was just disrespectful.

cowboys,3cwq1k,Kwarizmi,2,Sat Jul 11 18:13:33 2015 UTC,The opponents stats are embarrassing.  Give Romo a Top D that can hold a lead and his stats would be even better.

cowboys,3cuc91,idgaf_neverreallydid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:07:37 2015 UTC,You don't seem to understand what the NFL is or how it works. The teams are the NFL. The owners appoint the commissioner to oversee everything and ensure that all teams are operating under the AGREED upon rules and regulations. If they don't like the job he is doing then they replace him. If they didn't want the NFL punishing players then it wouldn't be doing it. The NFL has a vested interest in the players off field behavior because it has a certain image it wants to maintain. When a bunch of players do stupid shit and get in trouble they negatively affect that. Welcome to the real world.
cowboys,3cuc91,Pappy091,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:34:21 2015 UTC,I understand all that. I'm just stating how it should work.

cowboys,3cuc91,HiveNode,6,Sun Jul 12 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"Have you read the 911 calls? Hardy is begging the police to show up and remove her from his house cause she won't leave. He is telling them that his friend is holding her back because she is trying to attack him. Besides the victim the only person who said she was attacked was a very drunk lady also there who was in a different room and only heard the fighting later saying she saw it. The guy who called for the lady who said she saw it tell the operator that she's drinking and that her story has been changing.   I do not know if you have ever tried keep a 100 pound frantic women from swinging at you or trying to cause you arm but something as simple as holding her arms to herself to protect yourself will leave bruises. Short of him leaving his own home where she was breaking items he was in a losing situation. If he is at fault for protecting his possession from an ex girlfriend in his own house, then that seems similar to victim blaming to me."
cowboys,3cuc91,sweetssweetie,2,Sun Jul 12 03:30:10 2015 UTC,"The NFL allegedly  has pictures of her with bruises.   Have you ever been in a fight? I've only been in a few but even when I won I had bruises.  She was definitely coked up, a state known for making people aggressive.  Hardy called the cops.  Not too many dudes who just slammed a chick into a bathtub and threw them on loaded assault rifles are going to do that.  She ran away from the police and wouldn't cooperate once the trial went to a jury.  Could it be because she didn't think she could win?  I'm not saying hardy is an angel, he clearly isn't but he doesn't deserve 4 games when ray rice got 2.  Since he's already had to sit out 15 games, but was paid, he should be fined a few game checks and everyone should move on."
cowboys,3cuc91,boilerblaze,0,Sun Jul 12 03:58:53 2015 UTC,I don't have a full understanding of this situation but I think I agree with you.  Hardy hasn't played on the Cowboys before and we signed him to a pay per game sort of thing so I don't feel too much allegiance to him.
cowboys,3cuc91,Tomoromo9,3,Sun Jul 12 04:42:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd agree with that.  Except he did get paid for last year.  So he missed a lot of games, but he still was paid for them.  These are the first 4 for which he won't get paid."

I'll preface with that I've been drinking for the past 9 hours, but I've wanted to ask for some time...booze clears the anxiety. How does one who has had to deal with a history of domestic abuse be okay with this guy? It's obvious that 99% of this subreddit is. I've read the posts and supposed excerpts from court documents about the case, but it seems way more like she was paid to run and hide than he didn't do it. I love this team, grew up with it. I want to like this guy because I know he's about to do great things on the field, but can't muster anything other than hate for a guy who hit a woman.

cowboys,3cuc91,sweetssweetie,5,Sat Jul 11 03:33:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, so if you have read up on the situation then you know that the police reports correspond almost identically to Hardy's version of the story. On the other side, her story didn't add up at all, with regard to the police.  Now think of how this countries mentality on women are. The man in almost any domestic violence, rape, or other gender on gender crime immediately blames the man without evidence (keep in mind I'm talking about public opinion, not the judicial process). It's  just the go to mindset atm.  Now lets go to the trial. North Carolina law is a little screwy. From what I understand they have a bench trial to determine if it should go to a jury trial. Hardy gets a judge that is notorious for slamming the hammer down on domestic violence cases. The judge finds him guilty (meaning he has enough evidence to send the bench trial to a jury trial of his peers). Regardless of how any of this would have worked out Hardy would have been trying to pay his way out. He wanted to play. Regardless of if he was actually innocent or guilty he would have been trying to settle things outside of court. So we can't really assume he is guilty based off of paying his girlfriend off.  Well she didnt show up to the jury trial and by all rights that means the charges are dropped amd he is innocent.  For anyone that has paid attention to this whole story there just isn't enough  proof that he actually manhandled her as opposed to defending himself from a drugged up aggresive woman. People that say he did it only look at the surface. Big mean football dude. Scrawny little bruised up woman. He did it end of story. When in reality the facts support his story in an unbiased judgement. The trial would have brought out more evidence, but we will never know what.   That's why this sub is okay with this dude. Everyone just automatically assumed guilty until proven innocent, when in reality it should be the other way around. This sub has talked about the Hardy case since the rumors of aquiring him. Enough has been debated that most people here agree that even if he did do it, its up to the judicial system to judge him, not us."

cowboys,3cvub2,gdaman22,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:36:50 2015 UTC,That would be great.  Not sure what his long term prospect would be.  He looked great against the Cowboys last year too.  I'd have more faith with him from what I saw than with Weeden.  Honestly I'd be ok with Redskins - Cousins/Simms as well.   Edit - I have zero faith with Weeden.  I'd take a flyer on Manziel.
cowboys,3cvub2,keanex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:00:32 2015 UTC,What I mean about Manziel is I think Browns would unload him cheap.  I could be wrong.  Maybe a 6th or something.  Why not.  He cant be as bad as Weeden.  And I'd have to think he is comparable to Romo as far as how he plays the game.  I am no GM though....

cowboys,3cvub2,Tomcat1108,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:48:50 2015 UTC,When I brought up Simms/Cousins/Manziel I figured they could be had somewhat cheap.  Looking back I probably wouldn't do Simms.  Cousins if he was late round just like Manziel.  I think I posted something about Matt Moore last year but dolphins signed him.  I didn't watch a lot of Manziel in College but what I did I think his play would be comparable to Romo in a way.

cowboys,3cvub2,cowboyup12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:56:56 2015 UTC,That's the assumption that he can be had cheap.  And it really sounds like he would be.  I think the Browns would unload him cheap

cowboys,3cvub2,keanex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:29:34 2015 UTC,I think Romo and him can be quite comparable but I wouldn't trade for him unless it was a very late pick considering he is on the outs.  I think he could be had cheap.

If you want to narrow down losing home field last year, you need to look no further than losing a home game to the Washington Redskins who were QB'd by rag armed Colt McCoy. That is the one game Dallas had no business losing last season.   Anyway, with the salary cap, no team will ever have the luxury that the 49ers had when Steve Young was backing up Joe Montana. You place your money in the starter and then you attempt to find a competent backup. Dallas has done this. Backup QB is a very LOW position of concern."

cowboys,3cu96a,err0r101,5,Fri Jul 10 21:54:24 2015 UTC,"Cowboys call broncos up and ask what are you going to pay demarius thomas? Broncos give them the number they're looking at and what dt is asking.  The Cowboys then return the favor.  It helps prevent the teams from overpaying.  Edit: in this instance, it's technically just any illegal cooperation or conspiracy according to google."
cowboys,3cu96a,boilerblaze,2,Fri Jul 10 22:02:13 2015 UTC,"I think the expectations are Broncos sign DT first because Dez is worth more.  So instead of it being a bid war between DT and Dez, between the teams they go ""Hey Broncos, you do __ amount and we'll go this slight amount over it instead of us both outbidding the others star WR"""

cowboys,3cu96a,markarie,9,Fri Jul 10 21:04:29 2015 UTC,"This is bad...very, very bad!  Why would Dez want to re-sign with the Cowboys, if they're going behind his back pulling this shit?  I really hope this isn't true!"

cowboys,3cu96a,tjc815,2,Fri Jul 10 23:42:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds like NFLPA speculation....    Even the fans know Dallas and/or Denver doesn't want to pay those WRs Calvin Johnson money or set an even higher new standard for WRs.  They are pretty much using the salary cap as leverage.   If Dez or Thomas don't sign for less than Calvin Johnson they'll play next season for the franchise tag amount, no need to collude."
cowboys,3cu96a,Dday22t,2,Sat Jul 11 08:52:24 2015 UTC,Yeah good luck proving that.  You are going to have to have witnesses to a GM conversion and if it was taped without consent the it is illegal wiretapping

cowboys,3cupym,zsxecorp,-4,Sun Jul 12 01:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you should start with controlling your own stadium.  Taking over other stadiums is all fun and games, but controlling your own stadium should be a given."

Last year, they were coming off another 8-8 season but later in the season against the Colts and Lions, the stadium was insane and taken over by Cowboys fans."
cowboys,3cupym,zsxecorp,2,Sun Jul 12 01:39:12 2015 UTC,"You do know that local fans don't really fill up their own stadiums in the majority of venues because it's pretty fucking expensive to go to every game, right? Season ticket holders generally sell half their tickets to be able to afford to go to the other 8 games (usually the divisionals and 5 best games)."
cowboys,3cupym,HiveNode,-3,Sun Jul 12 02:12:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know Jerry Jones prefers money over his own fanbase taking back the stadium.  Still, though.  Philly sports fans work their asses off and spend every last penny of their bank account to see their teams play."

I think they want to reduce it but will wait until Greg files a lawsuit so they can reduce it with an excuse for doing so and avoid backlash.  EDIT I am so happy to have been wrong!

cowboys,3cpjrd,Runna4life,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:21:35 2015 UTC,"I think they're delaying the decision until the last possible moment even though they already know they're going to hand out a 6-game suspension. The reason being that they know Hardy will sue and win, and the punishment will be reduced to 2 games. By delaying they're hoping it'll take 4-6 weeks to get a court decision, so they'll lose but he'll still be effectively suspended."
cowboys,3cpjrd,koofti,3,Thu Jul 9 21:42:25 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of people saying that's what they're doing. But Hardy will just file an injunction which will let him play until the decision comes around. Of course, the downside to that is that he could be suspended possibly into the playoffs if the timing is bad enough with the court ruling. That being said, it's unfavorable for the NFL because they're going to have to justify to the court what's taking so long with this decision. ""As soon as practicable"" is a legal term that has actual meaning."
cowboys,3cpjrd,Differoba,2,Fri Jul 10 00:04:14 2015 UTC,Then do you know why they're delaying if Hardy can just get around it easily?
cowboys,3cpjrd,koofti,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:48:16 2015 UTC,No idea. One can only speculate. I've heard the idea that they're putting it off until the media kind of forgets about it and it doesn't make a big splash. That's an iffy theory but your guess is as good as mine.

cowboys,3co9b8,tash3r,6,Fri Jul 10 17:44:44 2015 UTC,"I have a similar background as you, I grew up in NJ surrounded by Giants and Eagles fans. I've been to a bunch of cowboys games at the old Giants Stadium, Metlife Stadium, and even one game at the old Veterans Stadium (needless to say, I'd never travel to Philly again). But I've traveled to AT&T Stadium twice now and all I can say is, you HAVE to go. One of the games I went to was Cowboys v Dolphins on Thanksgiving a couple years ago. One of my friends is a hardcore Dolphins fan. Everyone in the area was super friendly to him, a bunch of people came up to him and told him it was a good game afterwards (we did win though, and I've actually never experienced AT&T stadium after a loss, it could be more salty). It's just a completely different atmosphere than stadiums up here in the northeast. Which isn't necessarily a good thing because most people don't bother making noise on defense. Most fans just want to sit there, relax, and watch a football game."
cowboys,3co9b8,ender0887,4,Thu Jul 9 13:56:05 2015 UTC,Woa I wouldn't think about going to Philly to watch a game. I am planing to go to Dallas next Thanksgiving and am hoping to get great seats for the game. And may I ask what part of NJ do you live because I don't know many Eagles fans mainly Jet and Giants fans since I am in Northern New Jersey?
cowboys,3co9b8,ThadCastle_,3,Thu Jul 9 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"ha i live in philly. the last cowboys eagles game i went to was the 44 - 6 debacle.  i was wearing my romo jersey and was getting harassed in the parking lot before the game. my friends stepped in before any idiots tried to get violent. needless to say, ill watch the cowboys from home lol"
cowboys,3co9b8,ender0887,4,Thu Jul 9 14:55:06 2015 UTC,The only Cowboys v Eagles game I went to was when Michael Irvin hurt his neck and had to be carted off the field while Eagles fans were cheering. I'll never go back to Philly for a game.

cowboys,3co9b8,ender0887,2,Thu Jul 9 18:03:57 2015 UTC,Nice! A little consolation for the money you spend on a ticket for the Thanksgiving game is that you get to watch a shitty concert at halftime! When I went they had Pitbull and if I wasn't drinking it would have been unbearable haha. I grew up in north Jersey but went to college at Rutgers where I got a lot of shit from Eagles fans. The further south you go the more Philly influence you will find.

I was just shaking my head at the fact Demarco was averaging like 6 ypc and we only ran it 6 times the second half.   But yeah, it's a downer to see a loss, but it was still worth going to a game."
cowboys,3co9b8,udaillestshawty,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"Two years ago I went to the Dallas game in Philly. Everyone was heavily trash talking me throughout the game due to my Cowboys gear, but once the tide of the game shifted (we won) everyone got very quiet.   What made me laugh the most were all the incognito Dallas fans. You'd see them react subtly to a good play but didn't feel like dealing with the wrath of the Philly fans. It wasn't the horror story I was expecting and I would go to a game at Lincoln Field again."
cowboys,3co9b8,Voyager_,4,Fri Jul 10 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"Fans are great, always willing to have a drink with everyone around them regardless of the team. They are usually more into and passionate when its a division game or later in the season. It's hard for the die hard fans to get in every game due to how in demand a ticket at the stadium is, the stadium is amazing by the way. Best in the world."

cowboys,3co9b8,DwayneDickler,2,Thu Jul 9 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"I went there a few years back to see them play the Bears on Monday Night. The stadium felt like it was close to 50% Bears fans but I never felt any tension even though they were winning the whole game. The issue came AFTER the game when they were chanting and celebrating through the stadium corridors on the way out. Nothing out of line but as the fan of the losing team it's a horrible experience.   Overall, the atmosphere is great and the stadium is just insane to be in. You'll catch yourself just looking around and admiring it. If you go, obviously you HAVE to take the tour. Being able to stand on the star, in the end zone, in the locker rooms, and on the press stage, are all moments that I'll remember for the rest of my life."
cowboys,3co9b8,Bootyfan69,2,Thu Jul 9 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"It's gotten better. I remember the first couple years when I would go, my buddy and I seemed to be the only ones screaming and standing up for the whole games. It was overran by rich folks who don't care much for football, just wanted the status of sitting up close at a game, on their phones for a large portion of it.  This past season, things were different. The Cowboys have taken steps to address their weak crowd by creating these awesome hype up videos with Michael Irvin, and even (embarassingly) sending out a letter to season ticket holders on the issue if my memory serves me correctly. I was at the Giants and Eagles games this past season and that was the loudest I have ever heard Cowboys Stadium. It was awesome."

cowboys,3cmmct,RomoSpinMove,5,Thu Jul 9 22:21:15 2015 UTC,I'd would almost put McCoy ahead of Murray.. dude has been a game changer for YEARS.. and killed us on numerous occasions throughout the years.
cowboys,3cmmct,tripplethreat88,8,Thu Jul 9 03:53:27 2015 UTC,I'll take Murrays north south style over McCoy's dancing anyday of the week. Exactly why I think Emmitt is a better player than Barry.
cowboys,3cmmct,DondeEstaLaPlaya,0,Thu Jul 9 05:51:57 2015 UTC,"Not even close and you're 100% wrong in every regard about that. Sanders averaged 6 yards per carry during his 2,000 yard season (a feat Smith never accomplished on either front) while not having half the line that we had. 90s Cowboys have arguably the best line to ever exist in the NFL and Smith never came close to Sanders accomplishments. You'd be a fool to take Smith over Sanders in hindsight.  Sanders is hands down the better rusher and I say this as a fan who grew up during the 90s idolizing everything about the Cowboys."
cowboys,3cmmct,keanex,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:24:17 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you're arguing a different point: you're discussing who is a better rusher /u/DondeEstaLaPlaya is arguing Smith was a better player.  the implication is that Smith was more rounded; he was probably a better pass protector, caught more passes (some of that is longevity, but you balance that with how Dallas had a WAY better WR core, and yet Smith still caught more passes)."
cowboys,3cmmct,igrulks,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"Barry Sanders averaged 5 yards per carry for his lifetime career. He was 6.1 yards per carry in his 2,000 yard season. If he were in the Cowboys there is no doubt in my mind that Sanders would have been looking at 6 yards per carry on his career.  Sorry dudes but Sanders was the better player and its silly as heck to argue otherwise. He did much more with much less.  Edit: Sanders was also more efficient in the passing game than Smith was so that doesn't hold much merit either."
cowboys,3cmmct,keanex,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:14:36 2015 UTC,"Barry Sanders had pro-bowlers on his line..  it just didn't matter because he notoriously didn't follow his blocks so much it frustrated his lineman, this is what I mean by being a better player.   Probably should also add Barry's horrid playoff stats and the fact that Emmitt didn't have to be taken out on 3rd down.   Don't get me wrong Sanders is a generational talent and if I had one ticket to see someone in his prime it would be him but if I wanted to win a football game I'd pick Smith 9 out of 10 times."

cowboys,3cmmct,Shart_Film,15,Fri Jul 10 13:34:22 2015 UTC,My initial thought was that he wasn't even the 4th best player on the team how could he be 4th best in the entire league? But skill positions get all the love.
cowboys,3cmmct,OhRealOriginal,6,Thu Jul 9 02:30:59 2015 UTC,My initial thought was that he wasn't even the 4th best player on the team   Arguably not even the 4th best player on the offence.

I did get chills when Dez told DeMarco we could go into the playoffs with the way he was running. But other than that, I've come to acceptance that he's now just another player in the league.

I haven't looked at the whole list yet, but I am having a hard time knowing guys like Jamaal Charles and Marshawn Lynch are ranked lower than him at his position, let alone all positions.

cowboys,3cmmct,imnotedwardcullen,2,Thu Jul 9 19:23:33 2015 UTC,"Considering Romo was dismissed due to having a phenomenal receiving corp and having a great running game, I think there's some cognitive dissonance putting Murray at #4 when Romo was arguably more of a factor to our winning than Murray.

cowboys,3cmmct,keanex,2,Thu Jul 9 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is actually voted on by NFL players, but it sure as heck isn't voted on by NFL GMs.  The 4th best player in the league surely signs for more than just (effectively) 2 years/$18M.  There were entire tiers and echelons and strata of CBs that weren't even considered for the top 100 list who get more than that AAV, and 12 CBs who have higher guaranteed figures.  Murray's home team wouldn't budge past $6M AAV, and yet they're talking about giving the supposed 15th best player in the league $100M.  They already pay the supposed 34th best player in the league $18M per year, and many argue that that's one helluva steal of a deal.  Something tells me that nobody who's any kind of expert on talent evaluation thinks that Demarco Murray is better than all but 3 players in the NFL."

cowboys,3cmmct,tiamdi,0,Thu Jul 9 03:30:18 2015 UTC,"The only way I could see Murray being legitimately ranked 4th is if it was a ranking of just offensive skill position players in Dallas last year. He'd be 4th on that list, behind (in no particular order) Romo, Witten, and Dez.  Don't get me wrong, he had a big year. But it wasn't that far out of line from what you'd expect from any league-average back if you give them 400 carries behind our line. I mean, a 4ypc average on 400 carries is a 1,600 yard season. His yards before contact were only a few hundred shy of the #2 rusher's total yards gained.   I really don't want to take away from what he accomplished but I also don't want to give him more credit than he's due. He belongs somewhere in the 40s if we're talking best players in the entire NFL."

White rock lake is a neat place to kayak and there's places you can rent them from if that's your cup of tea. There's the galleria if you are into shopping for really expensive stuff you don't need.

cowboys,3ck5k5,Dworkin_Barimen,9,Thu Jul 9 00:27:29 2015 UTC,"Please don't listen to these fools suggesting the shit Pert museum. It's embarassing that they'd suggest such a thing, it clearly speaks volumes to how deprived these people are from decent museums, which Pert isn't close to being in the slightest bit. Here, I'll save you $20, you walk up in 100 degree heat after parking half a mile away and having to walk down a fucking service road, then you see a ship that's made out of old trash, go downstairs and you can wait in line 45 minutes with children to see of you can outrun a dimly lit non HD projection of a 1996 graphic designed trex, go up stairs and look at about 40 feet worth of tiny rocks you can find in the mall, then over to the bird exhibit which consists of another 1996 graphic design eagle game where you hold yours arms out to pretend to fly (after waiting in line with children of course) then you get to look at PICTURES of birds. It's a pathetic museum and anybody who's foolish enough to recommend it has absolutely no idea what a natural history museum is supposed to have in it. The very fact that such a suggestion has up votes in this threat really discredits everyone's alternative suggestions... like deep elum, a shit hole with no parking (or valet bc it's too sketchy of an area) that has maybe one decent restaurant in it.  Here's what you do in Dallas. Check out SMU campus, its one of the prettiest in the nation and it's very small. Then drive up, look at all the houses in Highland park, and go eat at Hillstone on Preston & Northwest Highway. Order the Hawaiian ribeye, you'll thank me later. Then go to a place called the Bowen House in Uptown and enjoy a high quality cocktail, walk down the street to the Crescent Hotel and check out their shops and lobby area, grab a coffee, maybe eat or grab a coctail at Nobu, and then hang out in and around uptown for the afternoon, as that's where all the decent people and bars are. It'll get really crowded, but Bowen house is always a good spot of you feel overwhelmed.   The next day grab brunch at Nick & Sam's in uptown, maybe check out a place called Sisu, its a pool/bar/dance place with a lot of beautiful women, if you're into that sorta thing.  Other suggestions: down town fort Worth is pretty you should walk around there, Jakes hamburgers is a safe place to eat, idk too many restaurants there. CLYDE Warren park is a nice place to hang out. The truck yard has good food trucks and is supposed to be fun, but I've honestly never been. White Rock lake is nice if you want to run, bike, or kyack.   You should defiantly hit up the Katy trail one day, it's only like 4 miles long, it starts in Highland park and ends at the American Airlines Center.   The Katy Trail Ice House is an absolute must. Go during the day. BeautifuL scene there. Get a ""beer-rita"" you'll thank me later.  If you want to see something extremely Big Texas, go to Nebraska Furniture Mart, its like the largest store ever built or some shit. Lots of furniture.   Northpark mall is nice, but during the summer you get a big crowd for that AC.  MiCocina is the best Mexican restaurant in town, so is Rafas.   Don't go to down town Dallas, its horrible. Nothing but one way streets and homeless people. Nothing to do at all.  Reunion tower (the ball) is okay, but the food isn't worth the price, and there's nothing to do after besides take a cab somewhere else.  Little Katana has the best sushi in town, outside of Nobu, I highly recommend it.  Other good bars to check out: Renfields, Black Friar, Kung Fu Saloon, 6th Street, Idle Rich, Milo Butterfingers,   Good tacos = Rusty Taco and Torchy's taco.  Good burgers = Maple Motor co., Rodeo Goat, Twisted Root on SMU Boulevard.  Places to stay away from that might seem nice when you're around some of the places I suggested: Concrete Cowboy (very douche, many fights), Avenue (only club worth going to if you absolutely insist on doing so, but all clubs are trash so I'm putting it here), Liars Den (or whatever new sketch name it has now, it's a 3 story trash club full of idiots in uotown) Lower Greenville (after 7pm) Deep Elum (after 4pm)   I started this post a little agressive, so I know I'll get downvoted, but I promise you these are the best places in dallas."

What if nobody in Dallas had seen any Marvel movies besides Spiderman 3, would it be okay to sit around and let everyone suggest he see it just because people don't know any better? no... If the guy is spending a week in a city he doesn't know much about, it stands to reason that he has experience traveling, which means he knows what real Natural Science & History museums should be like. It would be a shame for all of us to suggest the Perot museum and upvote it like it's something special only for him to be disappointed. It makes us look foolish and out city look bad. The place is cool for kids who don't know any better, not adults on vacation."
cowboys,3ck5k5,xanju,5,Wed Jul 8 22:06:10 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of stuff to do here! Definitely check out the Perot Museum, maybe go up on the Reunion Tower (as a native Dallasite I've never actually been there), Dallas World Aquarium, http://attstadium.com/tours/tourInfo.cfm for the stadium tour, be sure to eat some Tex-Mex, there's a bunch of Breweries here if you want to do a tour of one.   That's a good starting list right there."
cowboys,3ck5k5,locotxwork,5,Wed Jul 8 16:38:42 2015 UTC,"Ok this is off topic but that aquarium is fucking cool. You enter into this big ass room at like the top of this 'mountain?' over looking this pool and at the top they have birds and monkeys and shit, and you work your way down the mountain and see all the crocodiles, snakes, otters. Then you start going below ground and can see all the big ass creatures that were in the pool the whole time. Manatees and shit. The animal exhibits are better than most zoos I've gone to.   I was gonna babysit my friends kid and take him there. Now they don't need a baby sitter but I'll probably end up going by myself now that I worked my self up."

Arlington Dude, tour the stadium. It's so cheap and you get to see so much. That place is just awesome. They take you everywhere from the locker room to Jerry's suite. The stadium is badass by itself, the history and memorabilia are awesome by itself, that field is awesome to be on, plus you love the Cowboys, it's a no brainer.   Also, I can't tell when you're gonna be in town but try and catch a ranger game if you can. Tickets are pretty cheap, especially if you get them off seat geek or something. I love the food in centerfield, there bbq, I think, is actually badass. Also, even if you just get a cheap seat, just go over to the Jack Daniels club in left field. They have a buffet which I've heard is great and then you get to sit in what might be my favorite experience at park. The ultimate stadium bar/restaurant. The windows are huge and your right there like you have left field seats. It's like the wall just starts behind some row and all of a sudden you in seats with A/C, TVs everywhere, and listening to HOF Eric Nadel call the game for you.   Nightlife and restaurants are pretty standard in Arlington, tho I use to eat a Dino's Subs on Collins 4 times a week. Seriously they put more meat on a sandwich there than I've ever seen.   Dallas  The aquarium is awesome, I got excited about it earlier in this thread lol. The museums in the area are great too. You can definitely spend a day checking out the Perot and the Dallas art museum. I feel like they're surprisingly under-rated tho I guess I don't know that much about art. Other than some Van Goghs I couldn't tell you what was there.   It's really great seeing deep ellum all over this thread! That place is seriously blowing up! So many new places are opening up there (what like 9 places opened up in the last year?) I won't get into all the cool history about Deep Ellum but you can go there and check out blues, jazz, reggae, country, hip-hop, rock, punk rock, metal, all in the same night. The bars are great down there. Even going during the day, it's the perfect place to lounge around and drink. Very cool place. It's still kind of a hidden gem even to some locals due to its recent past but that place won't stay hidden long   All these places in Dallas are also seriously in a couple miles from each other. Hell even a mile or so down from Deep Ellum is where Kennedy was shot. You can go check that out too. It's pretty erie, it looks a lot like it did in the 60s but it's not like they have a big sign there. I drove past that place 20 times before I knew it was there. There's also ""x""s on the ground where Kennedy was shot both times. It's worth going to but your really gonna find it just looks like an old busy street, maybe that's weirder but you won't spend time at it like you would a museum."

You can't deny a place when they have 100% Mexicano painted on the side of their building!  Then on the other side of Collins on still on 303 across from Electronic discount sales (might be closed down now) there is a place called Tacos La Banqueta Puro DF (pure district federal). It's just tacos, tortas and quesadillas.  It's not fancy smancy, but it's cheap and it's good.    Wanna know where good Mexican food is?  Eat where there's a lot of mexicans in the place. PS . .

There was this place back in the day I used to go to, in North Oak Cliff near Bishop Arts called Chano's, but I don't know if it's good anymore. But if the joint is full and no one is speaking English, that's the place to be.   These threads are always full of ""Where can I find Mexican???"" Shit is straight up plentiful and good most of the time. I just went to La Ventana in Addison a week ago, and it was awesome, and I can always find something around Oak Cliff or Pleasant Grove.

A friend and I were talking about it, both out of the South Oak Cliff area, and we really want a place where a black big mama is cooking and putting her foot in it!  But I'm very picky when it comes to my collards! I went to Kenny's Smoke House a few weeks back and it was all divine except for the Carolina BBQ sauce (not my deal) and the greens were gritty."

There's a ton of great cheap Mexican and Vietnamese food in that area I just can't remember any of their names. There's a Mexican place by the kroger there that has the best burritos.

We tried to go to La Banqueta after a night at Lone Star Park and they were closed at 11pm, so we went next door and it's wasn't bad  . .AND that place sold beer.

I was planning a family trip there and it was cheaper to go to the movies.  Rangers games are a blast and tickets are so inexpensive. It's worth it. It's summer, so you can consider going to Hurricane Harbor or Six Flags, but do that in the middle of the week if you must. There are too many children here, and the weather has been off lately too. This weekend, they're having the big slide here.   Deep Ellum is amazing tbh, and you could split your trip between there, downtown, and Arlington.   I'd recommend checking out Central Market on Lovers and Greenville if you're not from Texas, but do it during the week as well. It's awful on the weekends."

From there, go around the corner to the Bishops Art District and grab you a slice of pie from Emporium Pies.  There's also the Fuel City street tacos. Great tacos inside a gas station of all places.  Also, the Smoked Bone for some good BBQ. Try the Cornbread Pudding.   The food truck park (I forget the name) in East Dallas is cool, too.  Don't forget to check out Sprinkles cupcakes off of Northwest Hwy and Preston and/or Bakery on a Hill in Cedar Hill. They've got some fantastic cupcakes.  Here's something cool many people who were born and raised in Dallas don't know exist. Beneath Downtown, there are a series of tunnels that run a good length under the streets. There's a bevy of shops and eateries along the route.  At many of the area lakes, you can rent watercraft ranging from jet skis to party barges.  I could go on and on. But, I have no idea what you like to do/want to do. So, I'll leave those few suggestions there."

cowboys,3ck3bq,verossiraptors,3,Wed Jul 8 17:21:18 2015 UTC,"There is legal precedent for players to file for a ""stay"" also called an ""injunction"". It allows players to play while the court case goes through proceedings."
cowboys,3ck3bq,_tx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:45:57 2015 UTC,file.   How long does that take? The NFL has already shown they will find loopholes in the CBA to enforce their will.
cowboys,3ck3bq,verossiraptors,2,Wed Jul 8 18:09:26 2015 UTC,A court injunction is a relatively simple process. It typically takes less than 48 hours.
cowboys,3ck3bq,mushpuppy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:21:15 2015 UTC,"It's actually really fast. By design it's meant to be fast and avoid undue delay.   As far as the NFL goes, they can't do much. Once it goes to a court of law, all they can do is hope their case is strong enough to avoid an injunction."
cowboys,3ck3bq,Neilmev,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"There won't be a court case per se, as arbitration by definition does not involve courts.  However, generally, I think you're right.  The longer the NFL waits, the more likely Hardy will miss time.  Remember: even when Hardy submits to arbitration, it'll still take time to get that hearing held.  There are a number of egregious issues here: the sheer arbitrariness of the penalty imposed and the fact that Hardy already agreed to miss so many games last year suggests that (1) ultimately he could miss far more than one season; and (2) he's not being treated the same as everyone else.    Compared to other penalties imposed by the NFL, Hardy's seems unduly harsh."
cowboys,3ck3bq,mushpuppy,3,Wed Jul 8 18:46:27 2015 UTC,I think it's already been submitted to arbitration. They are just waiting for the arbitrators ruling but he's dragging his feet. If the arbitrator's ruling is inconsistent with the nfl policy that the players union and the nfl agreed on then hardy can sue in court to overturn the arbitrator's ruling. I believe thats what happened with AP.
cowboys,3ck3bq,Ferndezmond,0,Wed Jul 8 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"Huh--I think you're right.  My understanding was that this just was the appeal to the NFL, which was being overseen by an arbitrator.

cowboys,3cjor1,jrharvey4,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"That's almost exactly where I would put him at this point. I disagree with a few of the individual choices of people over Romo, but as an average, I'd say most franchises have had about one QB better than him during the Super Bowl era.   A few—the 49ers and Packers, for instance—have had more than one. Others—such as the Panthers, Bucs, Texans, Falcons, Seahawks, and Lions—have never had a QB of Romo's caliber in their history (unless I'm inadvertently omitting someone from way back in the day).  Given that I have the author's permission, I'm moving Romo up to where Rivers is, moving Roethlisberger up to where Romo is, and moving Rivers back to where Roethlisberger is. But in general, it's a pretty solid list. In particular, the author did a good job of avoiding the complete fallacy that good QB play = SB wins. This isn't basketball where LeBron can turn any team into a contender by himself. It's football, where you could drop Joe Montana in his prime on last year's Raiders and they probably still wouldn't make the playoffs."

cowboys,3ci02d,SuperKerfuz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:07:14 2015 UTC,What does 3 tech mean?
cowboys,3ci02d,keanex,2,Wed Jul 8 16:27:13 2015 UTC,A 3 technique is a type of defensive lineman used in 4-3 defensive fronts. It refers to an interior defensive tackle who will typically shade over the guard as opposed to a 1 technique which refers to a prototypical nose tackle common in 3-4 fronts who shades over the center.
cowboys,3ci02d,european_son,2,Wed Jul 8 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure a 3-4 nose tackle is actually a 0-tech. 1-tech would be shading over one of the center's shoulder, favoring one of the A gaps."

cowboys,3ci02d,rthaw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily a huge fan of taking on the extra risk in locking someone up before they breakout, and I don't get the sense Jerry is either.  Even if we assume he turns into the beast we think he's going to be, and we've got him locked into a steal of a deal, the player will come swaggering back to the negotiation table talking about how underpaid they are.  You see it all the time.  You probably still end up paying them less than what you have to pay them once they make a Pro Bowl (eg), but it's not enough to offset the risk that you pay a guy guaranteed money and he never does reach the level you expected.  Of course, if we signed him tomorrow, I wouldn't complain because I like the player and I think he'll do great things for us, but I don't mind waiting for him to prove that he can play like a top 5 3-tech, and the trying to talk him into staying for top 10 3-tech money (especially if we lock up Dez and have the Franchise Tag in our back pocket)."

My husband and I went in October of last year and we had a blast.  It is directly across from the stadium and its all you can drink (beer & margaritas) and all you can eat (BBQ buffet). They also had a bar where you could buy shots or whatever you wanted.  They have a DJ and do silly games, give away prizes and have a dance floor.  Its super chill, so if that is your thing, I'd highly recommend.  There was a good mix of fans and tons of people.  Feel free to ask any questions, I'd for sure go again.  There was also a more expensive ticket where you could meet Bill Bates and get his autograph, but we didn't do that.       Also, be sure to do a stadium tour and book it in advance."
cowboys,3chk2j,chefbsba,6,Wed Jul 8 02:28:48 2015 UTC,all you can drink (beer & margaritas) and all you can eat (BBQ buffet).   For 50 bucks? That's amazing!

cowboys,3cf5y0,wesdub,5,Tue Jul 7 12:58:09 2015 UTC,Amazing article. But personally i think the toe tap in the washington game is his best TD of last season.

Throw up the X!

cowboys,3cf5y0,HiveNode,2,Wed Jul 8 13:09:53 2015 UTC,I just enjoy seeing how many catches he had last year. Gets me every time.
cowboys,3cflsv,itsaboat,8,Tue Jul 7 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"So right off the bat, the biggest thing I question with him is his vision. Which would then make sense why he is primarily used in passing situations, because too many times on the tape, I felt like he was either too focused on following the play or picked a bad hole. He is good at taking defenders on and being a pain to bring down though.      As we have expected most of the offseason, I think he remains #2 or #3 back. If Williams performs well, I think he is cut. Randle apparently had the best hands in OTAs, and I think that does not bode well for Dunbar, as that was his biggest strength."
cowboys,3cflsv,LordEfan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:27:30 2015 UTC,I would be a worried if Dunbar was our #2. I think McFadden does similar things but looks better in the ground game. I think Dunbar would be a good secondary 3rd down back and #3 RB.
cowboys,3cflsv,biggoof,6,Wed Jul 8 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, he's best at playing the screens and check downs, but when you bring him in you're pretty much telegraphing that play, so mix it up. I think we'll be ok if we run by committee. Randle hits the hole hard on his runs, which I don't see from Dunbar. TWill is a great downfield blocker."
cowboys,3cflsv,SuperKerfuz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:08:53 2015 UTC,It's easy for the defense to sit on pass bc Dunbar hasn't made teams pay in the run game
cowboys,3cflsv,_Cowboys,5,Wed Jul 8 14:16:07 2015 UTC,"I'm excited to watch this later. I have a feeling I won't be too impressed with his carries. He'll probably show some flashes, but I think his real highlights are from his checkdown and screen receptions."
cowboys,3cflsv,elpasowestside,6,Tue Jul 7 15:41:45 2015 UTC,"Only watched a couple minutes (I'll finish It later) I'm not very impressed. I think he only averaged 3.3 yards a carry last year which isn't going to cut it. Hopefully he's improved but I really only see his value as a receiver. Good work on the tape boat, it's very well done."
cowboys,3cflsv,_Cowboys,2,Tue Jul 7 16:46:19 2015 UTC,that may be true but in the majority of his carries he got positive yardage.  Could have been the O line but I thought it was good enough to open up the playbook
cowboys,3cflsv,rthaw,3,Tue Jul 7 21:45:06 2015 UTC,I mean 22 carries isn't a big enough sample size. I'm just saying behind the line the Cowboys have you should have at least 4 YPC.
cowboys,3cflsv,someedude,3,Tue Jul 7 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"TIL Dunbar should be catching passes out of the slot or something and not running the ball out of the backfield.  He's always been fast and quick with good hands, but his vision from behind the line looked terrible here.  I saw in another post that someone said he averaged 3.3yds per carry, but I honestly think that even that 3.3 came from our O line.  The only time he really gained positive yards was when the O line blocked the play wide open and he didn't get touched until 3 or 4 yds down field, or when the play was gimmicky or the D completely played it wrong.  tl:dr; he didn't make a single play on a handoff last year."
cowboys,3cflsv,ocr1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:08:32 2015 UTC,"He's only been impressive with his ability to catch a ball out of the backfield. I can't really say what his ability as a blocker is, as I'm sure he had limited opportunities. If he can block his viability as a 3rd down back goes up."
cowboys,3cflsv,VaderNocturnus,2,Tue Jul 7 21:48:23 2015 UTC,"While making the video I saw a couple of blitz pickups, Kendricks at Philly specifically, where he did a good job finding the blitzer and picking them up but bc he's small he got blown up. I feel like Dunbar could be a good backup 3rd down back but would be a little worried if he was the primary bc of the lack of production running"
cowboys,3cflsv,SlingyDoe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:08:49 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating to watch. So many times if he could just make the unblocked guy miss, or break the tackle, he'd be off to the races, but he always just only gets exactly what's there."
cowboys,3cflsv,Got_Engineers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:03:15 2015 UTC,"He has no rhythm with the line.   Always hated the fact Dallas could never seem to fit these type of players in their scheme consistently. I agree he should be catching passes out of the back field more in space than running. Sweep right/left and draw plays looked pretty predictable, so he just might need more packages to play out of."

cowboys,3cbpfj,itsmuddy,3,Tue Jul 7 17:35:42 2015 UTC,"I'll answer the assumed rhetorical question with a Nope.  The Eagles completely dismantled their horrible secondary - which is good. They needed to do that. And in the long run, they should be better. But playing both their games against the Cowboys in the first half of the season doesn't help them. It will take a bit to get their legs under them, and by the time they do, the Cowboys will be 2-0 against them.  The Giants haven't added anything to their defense of note. Amukamara is good if he's healthy. JPP is a giant question mark currently. And the Cowboys have swept the Giants the last two years. I expect this year to be another sweep as Romo and Dez dice up that defense some more.  Redskins are the closest. Kerrigan is a beast and Romo gets his shit pushed in constantly against them. That being said, we'll likely split the series and be the only win for the Redskins as they go 1-15."

This year, aside from Byron Maxwell and Walter Thurmond, the Eagles are trying to build a secondary through the draft.   Did he even re-read that statement? He basically said ""outside of the new #1 and #2 on the team, who form the core of the secondary, who the Eagles got in free agency this year, the Eagles are building their secondary through the draft"".   Uh..."
cowboys,3cbpfj,verossiraptors,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:39:11 2015 UTC,Uh...   Eric Rowe and JaCorey Shepard are in an open competition for the 2nd CB spot.  Earl Wolff is in an open competition for the R. Safety spot.  No definitive depth chart has been released.
cowboys,3cbpfj,A_Trustworthy_Pear,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:28:20 2015 UTC,"You're really going to act like the team didn't address their secondary via free agency? Any time you add a new #1 CB and another CB you're converting to your safety, you went to free agency to provide the foundation of your defensive backfield.   That'd be like someone going out and getting Brandom Marshall and Eric Decker in free agency and then claiming ""we're building through the draft...look at our crappy players who have yet to solidify as our #2/3 yet"""
cowboys,3cbpfj,verossiraptors,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:07:11 2015 UTC,Nobody has been named as a starter yet at those positions......acting like there are solidified #1's at any position besides Left Safety and CB1 is incorrect.
cowboys,3cbpfj,A_Trustworthy_Pear,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:41:39 2015 UTC,"Thurmond and Maxwell are your absolute, day 1 starters. They're also the top 2 players in your defensive backfield and are forming the foundation of it. So 2 out of your 4 starters in the defensive backfield were acquired this year in free agency. That's hardly ""building through the draft""."
cowboys,3cbpfj,verossiraptors,0,Thu Jul 9 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Eagles are throwing a pot full of spaghetti at the wall and hoping something sticks instead of actually building a secondary.  Redskins lost Haslett, who hopefully took his Romo blitzing kryptonite with him.  The Giants will probably have half their team on IR again by the time the season starts."

cowboys,3cbgcz,elshiznato,-4,Wed Jul 8 14:21:29 2015 UTC,"Everyone is so excited to see Dez get a long-term deal, but I think we should be careful what we wish for. I know I am certainly worried that they are going to overpay. Historically, We can expect Dez to have 1, maybe 2 real big years before he starts a drastic decline. The last thing I want is to look at our cap situation 5 years from now and see Dez counting $20M+ against it. They need to not jeopardize their future on a rash decision. There is no harm in using the franchise tag."
cowboys,3cbgcz,manbearpigdog23,4,Thu Jul 9 17:03:08 2015 UTC,"Dez is 26... he will be dominating for 4 more years at least. He doesn't rely on his speed as much as other aspects of his game, he's kinda like a super charged Anquan Boldin, as far as playstyle goes."
cowboys,3cbgcz,HiveNode,2,Mon Jul 6 20:52:23 2015 UTC,I cant wait until his Randy Moss 22 touchdown year.  I expect its still coming
cowboys,3cbgcz,AvoidNoiderman,2,Mon Jul 6 23:10:26 2015 UTC,but they might franchise him again next year. That's already like $28mil guaranteed. Might as well give him a $100mil contract now with $35mil guaranteed.
cowboys,3cbgcz,TheManDapperDan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:09:07 2015 UTC,Yeah and if you're worried how many years he has left get the contract started now rather than a year later. If you wait a year he's getting the same contract then that he would be now and he's a year older.
cowboys,3cbgcz,drumberg,2,Mon Jul 6 21:24:59 2015 UTC,dez is way better then TO and he played well into his 30s...to say hes only going to have 2 real big years left in his whole career is absolutely ridiculous.
cowboys,3cbgcz,uniquee1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:41:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, WR years are not equivalent to RB years. Top receivers generally don't start to decline until after their 10th season. Dez is a decent bet to make the Pro Bowl in 2020 if he stays healthy."

cowboys,3c8386,Lightford,2,Wed Jul 8 06:25:54 2015 UTC,"Plan on tailgating. Get a parking pass and come early. There are always great tailgate parties, but Thanksgiving goes up a notch IMO. Even if you don't bring food, chat up some people nearby, I'm sure they will share. We're friendly down here, especially to other Cowboy fans. :) There will be plenty of people with TVs to watch the early game. Beats any sports bar hands down!"
cowboys,3c8386,jamesg68,2,Mon Jul 6 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"There isn't a bad seat in the house. 50 yard line or 10 yard line, it doesn't really matter. All the site lines are good.  If you're really uncertain, look for some tickets you're interested in, then go to this interactive seating chart and you should be able to see the view from those seats."
cowboys,3c8386,boomshalock,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"I recommend getting there early enough to find cheap parking. There are many bars around the area where they allow paying customers to park there during the game as long as they spend a certain amount of money at there bar.  Visit the gift shop before the game starts. It will be crowded during the entire game, but it is well worth it to take a look around.  If you plan on eating at the Stadium, I recommend trying something a little high on the price range. The food is pretty decent, especially the specialty items.  Finally, as someone mentioned before, do your best to not stare at the giant screen too much. It does catch the eye, but the best times to really look at those are only during replays. I also believe many fans forget they are at the game and stare at the screens which causes them to not cheer (but that is just one of my theories).   Good luck finding tickets though. I believe $250 a ticket might get you about eye level with the giant screen. I think the 50 yard line would be incredible, but those are easily the most expensive. My buddy has season tickets 2nd row behind one of the goal posts and it is still incredible from there."

The story goes Teague was walking down the tunnel with the team prior to the game, and noticed someone carrying the American flag. He grabbed it, and ran out on to the field representing America's Team, and reassuring a wounded nation, we won't be intimidated. I'll never forget watching it on TV. Happy 4th of July, r/cowboys"
cowboys,3c37xo,jlacomb17,8,Sat Jul 4 09:23:57 2015 UTC,"I loved George Teague. He loved being a Cowboy. He had two stints as a Cowboy. First in 1996 and then again from 1998 through 2001. There is the story about the flag, knocking the stupid out of T.O. when he disrespected the star, and also my favorite George Teague story: A few years after he retired (I think it may have been 2004), the Cowboys were having injury and talent issues with their safeties. Since he was still living in Dallas, George Teague said that he would come out of retirement to help the Cowboys with their safety issues. It never happened, but it showed how much Teague cared about the Cowboys.  Edit: Another interesting fact about George Teague. In 1998, the Cowboys signed Teague to replace Brock Marion and the Dolphins signed Brock Marion to replace George Teague."

cowboys,3bwhoi,verossiraptors,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"I've seen PFF rank them better at different points. I think the rankings you looking at there is for the OL over the course of the season (ratings at positions, not on players).   This accounts for injuries. If Peters is replaced by a backup during injury, the PFF ratings continue to accumulate for the position because it's player-neutral.   But if you put their starting OL in, and put them against ours, theirs wins. That will obviously be different next year with Mathis gone.   Also, you could argue that the way PFF ranks overall by position and not player is appropriate for this scenario. They have an OL of very old players. Once players get up to the age of their OL, their injury likelihood increases a lot.   So it's probably appropriate to evaluate their OL overall, including their depth players who will likely be on the field at some point."

I'm going to come off as a Roland apologist but in reality my work involves seeing a lot of people with mental health/substance abuse issues.  There have been whispers this summer that Ro checked into a rehab facility and that's why he missed OTA activity and has been 'rehabbing his knee in Alabama.'  I don't know the guy at all but I'm guessing from what I've read about his past that he has some serious emotional/psychological damage at play.  My guess is the front office has known about this for a while and it resulted in us picking up Brinkley, Rivers, etc and drafting Wilson. If his suspension is due to something other than PEDs then I hope he can get his shit together eventually before his life completely falls apart regardless of his contribution to the team."

cowboys,3bwhoi,jasoncongo,2,Thu Jul 2 19:17:46 2015 UTC,Does this effect salary cap at all?
cowboys,3bwhoi,Zazi751,3,Thu Jul 2 19:24:49 2015 UTC,"I know a fair amount about the salary cap, but am not an expert. The guys over at otc mentioned that Sheldon Richardson has to pay back a portion of his signing bonus due to his suspension for the same reason.   I don't know if that was specifically in Richardson's contract but not McClains or if that is a blanket contract thing in the NFL. If it is a blanket thing then I would expect it to affect next year's cap in the form of a cap credit in the amount of his signing bonus (just $500k).   I believe the snap count bonus would have been a NLTBE incentive (due to playing just 61.6% of snaps last year) meaning we would have had to settle up cap wise at the end of the year (and possibly count against next year's cap). So, while it doesn't necessarily change the cap, it does ultimately mean we most likely will not have to account for paying that bonus from a money or cap perspective."

He claimed to have smoked constantly throughout his career but he never failed a drug test. Why? Because they warn you months in advance of your test. They only way to fail is if you're a complete moron or just don't give a fuck.

The NFLPA gives a 30 day notice to players before the random drug testing period begins. http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/nfl-players-union-gives-friendly-warning-players-about-upcoming-drug-tests  Players failing drug tests is terrible PA for them.

This is already his second failed test within a five-month period. Plus, his contract is team-friendly, so it wouldn't be very costly to let him go. I expect the Cowboys to give the roster spot to a guy who actually attends camp and stays on the field."
cowboys,3bwhoi,Fallen_Milkman,2,Thu Jul 2 20:30:18 2015 UTC,McClain won't be cut. He doesn't count against the roster when he's suspended there would be no reason to cut him.
cowboys,3bwhoi,someedude,0,Thu Jul 2 23:18:24 2015 UTC,"The Cowboys seem to be willing to cut and paste players, filling one in for another as they can.  Probably this is a result of the roster churn from a couple of years ago.    No difference, really, between finding a Walmart guy who can play reasonably well for a few games (Selvie) and plugging McClain in after a 4 game suspension.  This seems to be the idea with Hardy, too; for whatever number of games he'll be available, he'll be better than anyone else on the roster.    So might as well treat him/them as if they're simply injured, provide contracts that protect the team in case of unavailability, and take the chance."

There was some stat floating around here that in his four games with 10 or more carries, his ypc was like 2.5. Extremely small sample size, but that's my question. The article did a good job answering some questions I hadn't thought of though."
cowboys,3bw0a7,HiBillyMaysHere69,18,Thu Jul 2 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"I can try to answer those questions directly here. You're right, those are common complaints. Here are some of the most common complaints about Joseph Randle:   He got most of his carries in garbage time (answered here) He played mostly against defenses who were trying to stop the pass (also answered here) I'm not sure his body can stand up to a starter workload If you take away his 3 biggest carries, his YPC is league-average He can't pass-block. He's not a 3-down back We can't trust him off the field. Every time he's had over 10 carries a game he's had under 3 YPC.   The first two were answered in the article so I'll ignore those. Let me address the last five.    I'm not sure his body can stand up to a starter workload.  Where exactly does this concern come from? Randle doesn't have an injury history. Nothing in his background says he can't handle a workload. For some reason, people think he's tiny. He was listed at 6'0"" with weight between 205-210 coming into the league. And he's probably put on a few more pounds of muscle after being around a couple of years with an NFL nutrition program.   Sure he's no Eddie Lacy or Leveon Bell. But he's not tiny. Demarco weighed 217. Adrian Peterson is 217. Marshawn is 215 (fucking crazy, man). Shady McCoy is 207. Matt Forte is 218. Jamaal Charles is 199. Between 200-220 is the sweet spot for RBs. Sure you'd like to see him closer to 215...but his weight doesn't make him a liability.    If you take away his 3 best carries, his YPC is league average.  Yeah...him and everybody else in the league. Including Lesean Mccoy (1), Marshawn Lynch (4), Leveon Bell (3), Eddie Lacy (4), Jeremy Hill (4), and more. Even Jamaal Charles, who is the KING of ypc, only takes FIVE carries to bring his YPC down to league average.  The fact that you can take away Randle's 3-4 best carries and bring his YPC down isn't a bad thing. It's actually a good thing. That can happen to all the best RBs. Why? because all of the elite RBs break a game open with a long TD run at least a few times a year...and that inflates their averages.    He can't pass-block  This is one of those things that people always say about RBs, even when they haven't been in the film room or evaluated. He didn't give up a single sack all last year on 17 pass-blocking attempts. I believe he didn't even give up a pressure. I don't have a PFF subscription, but the last article I read has said nothing about it being a serious issue. Just because media people say it (parrot it, more likely), doesn't make it true.    He's not a 3-down back  Why not? He can run on 1st and 2nd. He doesn't have serious issues with pass blocking (see above). The reports out of camp this year said he was the best pass-catcher on the field (even better than Dunbar and McFadden. And if you go back to his old scouting reports, his ability to catch passes and do work was one of his advantages. In his final year, he had ~280 yards on ~28 catches. A 10YPC receiver out of the back field is awesome. Not to mention he has the wiggle and acceleration to excel out of the back field anyways.    We can't trust him off the field  This one has more stock, but it still doesn't totally stand up to scrutiny. When the domestic incident happened, one of the dallascowboys.com media guys (from Randle's hometown) called around his hometown contacts to get a character evaluation. Everyone said he was a great kid, with a stellar work ethic, and no character concerns. His scouting reports listed no character concerns.   The underwear incident, the more you think about it, sounds like he shit his pants. He stole cologne and underwear. It legit seems like he shit his pants and was too embarrassed (and probably stinky) to stomach going through a checkout line like that. I can believe it. Now whether we want a pant-shitter on our team is another matter altogether ;)  The domestic issue is more concerning. But there were issues with that which made it seem non-credible...and lo and behold it's a problem that has just dissipated.    Every time he's had over 10 carries a game he's had under 3 YPC.  This is just not fair. He only had a single game this year with over 10 carries. Against the Colts. And he had 2.8 ypc that game. Guess which RB also had over 10 carries and ended up with a lower ypc for that game? Demarco Murray. The colts had our number...which is why Romo fucking wrecked them in the passing game.  The other couple of games that fit this criteria was when he was younger and inexperienced. He clearly turned a corner talent- and production-wise this past year...so I'm less likely to judge him for a 10-carry game his rookie year.    TL:DR The assessments of Randle are unfair, and generally don't hold up to further scrutiny."
cowboys,3bw0a7,SkeadLegend,2,Thu Jul 2 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"You make some great points and I agree with every single one. This is Randle's prove it season. I really think he will step up to the plate and become the sure fire starter, if he doesn't get a starting role this season odds are he will be a lock for #2 for a while."

That doesn't sound like a guy embarrassed by being covered in fecal matter"
cowboys,3bw0a7,Mange-Tout,3,Thu Jul 2 19:50:17 2015 UTC,"I can buy it. Let's imagine that Randle ate at Chipotle at the mall. Then he heads over to Hot Topic to buy a My Chemical Romance t-shirt when suddenly his stomach starts to rumble and a deep, throbbing pressure builds in his bowels. He desperately looks for a bathroom, but none are nearby. He quick-steps towards an advertising pillar looking for a map, but all they have are ads on all four sides! He starts running for the exit, and lo and behold there is Macy's. Randle ducks past the cologne samplers, jukes at women's shoes, and finally finds the men's room deep in the shoe department. He is so relived that when he grabs the men's room handle he relaxes slightly and ""PHHHHTTT!"" shits his pants.   Now he is mortified and not thinking straight. He gingerly walks towards the underwear department and grabs a package of boxer briefs. He also swipes a bottle of cologne. Then he retreats to the men's bathroom and manages to clean up reasonably well. He doesn't want anyone to know this, of course, so he dumps all the evidence and heads for the exit. Of course, because he is a black male Macy's security has been watching him like a hawk and they are waiting for him at the door. Randle, when faced with the choice of being shamed in public for being either a thief or a pants shitter, choses the former. It makes total sense to me!"
cowboys,3bw0a7,Gobias-Ind,3,Fri Jul 3 12:18:27 2015 UTC,The only thing more ridiculous than this explanation is the idea of an NFL player being caught stealing Cologne and underwear. I'm going to go ahead and assume your account of the event is true.
cowboys,3bw0a7,luvs_T0_spooge,4,Fri Jul 3 20:40:14 2015 UTC,"I would think the only way to truly answer that question is to see how he plays over the course of a season as a lead back, which kind of ruins the point of this kind of speculation. Short of that, I guess the best data we have is his performance in college, which is not a particularly good indicator of nfl success."

You might want to book a hotel in Dallas for Friday night to explore there and then one of the hotels/motels near the stadium the rest of the days.  If you don't care about luxury there are a few motels/hotels within walking distance of the stadium that are affordable.

Everything in the DFW metroplex is very far away from everything else. These cities were built with cars in mind not walkability. If you want to fully explore and take advantage of your time here you'll need the flexibility and comfort of a personal car."
cowboys,3bvl9v,jamesg68,3,Thu Jul 2 16:46:52 2015 UTC,"Parking is ridiculously expensive. I would stay near the stadium if you don't plan on visiting Dallas or Fort Worth. There is practically every brand of hotel on Lamar, which is the street across the freeway from the Stadium. I see several people walk to the stadium from here on game day. It is a bit of a hike, so depending on your dad's desire to walk, may need to take that in to account. This hotel is probably the closest to the stadium. Even with a rental car, I probably would not want to pay for parking.   As for places to go, there are several and it depends what you are looking for. Dallas is great if you looking for ""big city"", urban type. But if you want a more ""Texas"" feel, go to Fort Worth. I prefer Downtown Fort Worth to Downtown Dallas. There are great places to eat all around. I hope you are not vegetarians, because you can not leave without having any barbecue, steak or Chicken Fried Steak. Beef. It's what's for dinner! And Texas is serious about it. Just ask Oprah. :)   That said, hope you have a great trip. Post again when game time comes and let us know how it was."

If you're bored and there isn't much to do, you could also probably get some really cheap Rangers tickets, right next to the Cowboys' stadium. I believe MLB regular season ends early October, so you might be able to catch a home game.  And on the food situation, make sure you hit a good BBQ spot and a good Tex-Mex spot. I'm not super familiar with the restaurant options near Cowboys' stadium or in Dallas, but it shouldn't be hard to find some good restaurants if you do quick search on the internet or something.

cowboys,3bvfbs,Uncle_Tom1,17,Thu Jul 2 15:13:49 2015 UTC,I disagree. I think the most improved position group is D-Line.
cowboys,3bvfbs,WeDemBoyz88,4,Thu Jul 2 13:57:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't think the D-Line played that awful last year especially due to all the injuries (D-Law in the first half of the season, both McClains being injured, Lee, Whaley, etc). We ranked near the middle overall and ranked pretty well in run defense."
cowboys,3bvfbs,GorillaWarfare_,4,Thu Jul 2 14:00:48 2015 UTC,"CB on the other hand was one of our biggest issue, along with Safety. Only Scandrick really played well and up to the standards of his contract (Moore too)."

cowboys,3bvfbs,Phinnegan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:15:12 2015 UTC,"I think the stats are misleading. Our run defense was very suspect, and it seemed like any back we faced had the potential to break away huge runs. It didn't happen that often, but it was a serious liability. And let's not forget how much we struggled at times to get to the QB.   Our defense wasn't bad (considering the 2013 season) but it wasn't good either. It was mediocre. They made some huge stops at clutch moments and I respect the hell out of them for doing it, but I think the dline is going to take a huge step forward this year."
cowboys,3bvfbs,Runna4life,7,Thu Jul 2 19:46:46 2015 UTC,Improve: D-Line  Digress: RB
cowboys,3bvfbs,Drugs_and_Hugs,6,Thu Jul 2 13:59:21 2015 UTC,"I mean this in the friendliest and most supportive way - the word you're looking for is regress.  http://cat.wordpandit.com/digress-regress/  But I digress - I think the group most likely to regress is running back, for obvious reasons. The group I fear regression from is the OLine - they played at such a high level last year it may be difficult to maintain, despite getting even more talented with Collins, and everyone with another year under the belt.  I believe DLine will be most improved. They played well above expectations last year, but I think T Crawford is going to continue to improve to pro-bowl level. No reason to think Lawrence won't continue the pace he set in his last few games last year, and Hardy, when he plays, is an elite talent."
cowboys,3bvfbs,jjm214,3,Thu Jul 2 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"Secondary and D-line will improve the most.   Brandon Carr was playing really well at the end of last season so I think the coaches have learned how to utilize him.   Claiborne could step up and potentially be a starter, he was our 2nd corner going into the season last year. It was less than a year ago when he was our starter.   Corey White is, from what I've heard from Saints fans, an average slot corner so I expect he's there for depth if Scandrick goes down or for him to rest.   Drafted Byron Jones who can play Safety or corner so that adds a lot of flexibility to the defensive scheme.   Additions of Gregory and Hardy could result in an elite pass rush, Lawrence goes I to his second season and looked great in the playoffs last year, wouldn't be surprised if he hit double digit sacks.   Increased skill at defensive end will help Tyrone Crawford in the interior. Really haven't list anybody important on the line, could possibly get much better there and really can't get any worse.   The mist regression will be at the HB position because well... We lost the rushing champion and offensive Ayer of the year. Eagles fans think our run game will collapse and we'll get 1 YPC overall. But I don't see a huge drop off, around 4 YPC is what I expect but 4.5 is optimistic and I think high 3's is worst case."
cowboys,3bvfbs,itsaboat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"Claiborne was only our starter at the beginning of last year because Scandrick was suspended. The second he came back, he took the starting position. He was a liability while out there, and the main reason we went down 21-0 quick to the Rams.   Hoping he can turn his career around though."

cowboys,3bvfbs,Stringdaddy27,3,Thu Jul 2 16:18:10 2015 UTC,"Improve: Defensive End  We didn't get much, especially from the left side, from our outside rushers in 2014 aside from Mincey. Lawrence should be able to produce more than Spencer and Selvie did combined. Hardy is one of the best at his position and Gregory was probably the best pass rusher in this years draft.   On paper I don't see a position spot that will lose much from last year to this season.   People immediately think about RB but I like who we have and I think will have more explosive plays with Randle, McFadden and Dunbar.  Special teams coverage could be something to watch because we lost Harris and Spillman made a lot of plays for us last season. Fortunately we brought back McCray, Gachkar is known for his ST play, and we have some rookies like Gregory, Wilson, Russell, Nzeocha who could excel at it. So I'm not too worried.  Right now I like the team we have."
cowboys,3bvfbs,cowboyup12,4,Thu Jul 2 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"Digress: RB No one on the roster will replace Murray and that's why this group will digress, I still predict the Boys to have a top 10 run game (possibly top 5)? But for now this group is clearly the one that digressed the most overall.  Randle: To me is the clear #1 atm but the coaches won't admit it. His breakaway speed is fantastic and has great vision IMO. Needs to work on his blocking, but is improving.  DMC: Injuries have slowed him down so far but he's an excellent blocker and does everything else very well. A little older than Murray but I expect him to get around 500-750 yards and 3-4 TD's.  Dunbar:I think he will improve the most but will mostly be used in 3rd down situations and some specially designed plays.  Williams: I expect a lot out of him but injuries have slowed him down, hoping for the best but not expecting it."

Hell romo is ranked #34 behind qb's that didnt even make the playoffs and tons of players that arent even in the ballpark as important as romo is. And last season was one of his best ( might have been THE best ) season ever. Won when they needed to, led the league in QBR, was in the MVP discussion, etc.  But you're right. The list is jacked to generate traffic and thats it. Definitely sounds like something the NFL would do."

cowboys,3btwtk,quiznex,0,Thu Jul 2 18:19:52 2015 UTC,"dez is one of my favorite players, but you have to realize that other teams have superstars as well.  i would say its without question that dez is, at this point, indisputably the most DYNAMIC receiver in the game.  he has freakish strength and speed.  he makes miraculous catches and finishes YAC like a madman.  but dynamic doesnt always equal best.  guys like brown and jones may not have the same highlight real as dez...but they have fantastic hands, routinely burn CBs for HUGE chunks of yardage, position themselves and cut so well its scary.  im not saying dez isnt #1.  at this point, and with out offensive scheme i'd take him above the others...but its not a blowout."
cowboys,3btwtk,mr_feenys_car,2,Thu Jul 2 13:35:22 2015 UTC,"Well, Dez is a significantly better Red zone threat than Julio or Brown, and he can burn defenders, cut fast, and breaks tackles like a tailback."
cowboys,3btwtk,Runna4life,0,Thu Jul 2 13:42:59 2015 UTC,"im not saying otherwise. its not an all or nothing argument.  all these players are fantastic at almost every aspect of their position, its why they are in the top 20.  it just feels like this sub gets a victim complex whenever these lists come out.  like people are purposely underrating our players.  im just saying thats not the case.  dez is fantastic.  he has more TDs than either jones or brown.  but they must be pretty fantastic as well to rack up more catches, yards, first downs, etc."
cowboys,3btwtk,mr_feenys_car,3,Thu Jul 2 13:56:51 2015 UTC,"They also had a lot more opportunities than Dez, when you have an 1800 yard rusher o  your team the need for a pass game is reduced, so of course he's going to get less targets, less receptions, less yards etc. We'll see what he does without Murray.

cowboys,3btod9,gaseouspartdeux,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:28:40 2015 UTC,Foles threw 18 interceptable passes in his 27-2 campaign. He very well could've gone 27-20; Foles is mediocre. Funny how Eagles fans are starting to accept this now that he isn't their guy anymore.
cowboys,3btod9,gdaman22,4,Thu Jul 2 18:33:28 2015 UTC,NFL.com can rank every Cowboys player and coach worst in the league for all I care. We know who we are.
cowboys,3btod9,Fallen_Milkman,2,Thu Jul 2 12:40:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I don't want the media coverage, I don't want to press telling us how great (insert player here) is, I just want the wins...all the wins.  They can finally realize how great the team is when we're hoisting the Lombardi up..."
cowboys,3btod9,Runna4life,2,Fri Jul 3 15:58:53 2015 UTC,I mean JG finally had a good season only this year.
cowboys,3btod9,SyphiliticMonk,2,Thu Jul 2 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He had a good season. Which means he should be ahead of the coach who coached a team that collapsed at the end of the season. If the roles were reversed and the Cowboys went 3-4 in the last 7 games, including 1-3 in December, people would be calling for Garrett's head."
cowboys,3btod9,SyphiliticMonk,2,Thu Jul 2 16:09:55 2015 UTC,But he has had winning seasons in his two  seasons.  People would be calling for Garretts head because that is typical Cowboys.  Garrett has had one good season since being our head coach.  Chip has more in less time.  I understand the ranking.

cowboys,3btod9,HiveNode,2,Thu Jul 2 23:29:42 2015 UTC,I'd rank Linehan and Marenelli over Kelly
cowboys,3btod9,Honztastic,2,Thu Jul 2 02:34:36 2015 UTC,"From a technical standpoint, I can't knock them too hard. Jason Garrett is a hell of a leader and a great personality, but I think most of the 'technical' coaching (player roles, schemes, etc.) has been put on the sholders of our coordinators."
cowboys,3btod9,rugthrowa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:55:47 2015 UTC,"I can see that....  Hear me out.  A few years of 8-8 and one successful 12-4 season hardly makes you top 10 material. However, the way they have been rebuilding and if last year's success bleeds over to this season, I think he has a solid top 10 argument.  As for Chip... he turned around what seemed like a floundering team rather quickly. BUT, I think this year will be very telling for him with all the offseason (some questionable) decisions he made. If they turn out to win the division and have a 11 or 12 win season, then I would argue that 13 might be too high. If they bomb this season and go sub 8 wins, the 13 might be way too low."
cowboys,3btod9,rugthrowa,3,Thu Jul 2 20:11:54 2015 UTC,"I think Garrett is ranked about right, considering he has just had the one good season. But Kelly has literally done nothing. He took over a team that had 8-9 win talent, that was coming off a season where they had injury issues (just on offense they had a rookie start 6 games at QB, McCoy missed 4 games, and DeSean Jackson missed 5 games) and just plain gave up on Andy Reid. If he had at least won a playoff game, I wouldn't mind that ranking. But he is ranked ahead of coaches that have won more than he has, just based on what people think is going to happen. I would personally have him around 20, with a chance to move WAY up if he can put it together after the crazy offseason they had. I don't see it happening though. I think they finish 3rd, behind the Cowboys and Giants."
cowboys,3btod9,Dplymkr88,-2,Thu Jul 2 20:37:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it'll cause Cowboys fans to get angry and share it so they get more clicks, right? I doubt they really think Kelly is better, they just want clicks."
cowboys,3btf1m,Beacon_of_Blue,18,Thu Jul 2 00:18:02 2015 UTC,Pass to Witten. This is always the answer on 3rd down.
cowboys,3btf1m,jlacomb17,7,Thu Jul 2 00:34:02 2015 UTC,But would that work with them double covering Witten near the end zone.  I feel like a pass on double coverage would end in quick interception.
cowboys,3btf1m,jlacomb17,9,Thu Jul 2 00:43:10 2015 UTC,"He always seems to find a way to get open. If he is being double covered, Beasley would be my second look if I were Tony."
cowboys,3btf1m,gdaman22,9,Thu Jul 2 00:45:27 2015 UTC,"I think the best bet here is to just rely on Romo's check down.  Read one: Witten  Read two: Escobar on the fade where Dez should be  Read three: Throw a crossing to Swole or Twill, maybe look for the RB out the backfield  Read four: Throw it to Witten anyway"
cowboys,3btf1m,Browserof,14,Thu Jul 2 02:59:52 2015 UTC,"WR screen to Beasley or Dunbar on the opposite side of the blitzer. Or a Rub route with Terrance. like the one in the SF game and Rams game. He scored on both targets.  If one of these doesn't work, I'd do the other."

cowboys,3btf1m,barneyblitz88,5,Thu Jul 2 01:35:16 2015 UTC,"We're in fourth down territory so we have two plays. I think trying to go endzone both downs is everyone's gut instinct, but I actually think utilizing both downs to get guaranteed yardage is ideal. If we're inside the 5, they HAVE to respect the run and we open up our passing game. So, we need to at least get 2 yards minimum out of this play.  I'd prefer to set up in a spread formation with Williams, Beasley on the right, Witten and Street on the left. Dunbar in the backfield, as I think he has better vision than both Randle and Run DMC. Instinctively, the Giants defense is going to read Dunbar's presence and a spread formation as a passing play, leaving them spread thin to protect their box.   Zone blocking and let Dunbar get a one on one match up with their Mike.   I think it's reasonable to assume a 3 yard gain out of this on average. Occasionally Dunbar wins that one on one and scores. However, we now have the clock running which is good. Giants should be calling a timeout in this situation, giving us extra time to set up personnel.   Bring in a heavy set, keep Witten, Beasley, and Williams on the field. Double TE on left, Slot Right is Beasley, Wide right is Williams. Bring Escobar in motion to the right, drop him off inside of BEasley, get a good rub route from Escobar over and Beasley under. Witten runs a 2 yard out. RB hits the flat on the right side. Williams deep cross on the back of the end zone. Progression should be Beasley, Witten, Williams, RB, Escobar.   Seattle fucked this up in the SB though, so maybe we do something else."

cowboys,3bnrsx,_tx,2,Tue Jun 30 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"Their rolls are amazing. Strips are good, they taste really salty which I enjoy. Fries and regular chicken pieces are pretty bland imo.   My chicken power rankings is 1. KFC 2.  Popeyes 3. Bill Miller's. 4. Bush's 5. Church's"
cowboys,3bnrsx,WalrusRider,9,Tue Jun 30 23:33:18 2015 UTC,"Must be a regional thing, but I haven't had even a halfway decent bucket from KFC in years. I'd actually rather pick up some fried chicken at the deli at Albertsons than KFC. Popeye's at #2 checks out though. That shit's delicious for a chain fast food joint."
cowboys,3bnrsx,jesus_freak69,3,Tue Jun 30 23:48:03 2015 UTC,Maybe it's just the ones close by me but my KFC kills it. Oh lawd their hot wings.  My popeyes always gives me the tiniest chicken pieces known to man. But I could eat their fries all day long. They do move up to #1 when it's the time of the year they sell crawfish. Nothing like chicken and crawfish

cowboys,3bnrsx,tatorface,5,Tue Jun 30 22:12:19 2015 UTC,Cutler and G. McCoy both signed 7 year contracts last year. They're not rare.

cowboys,3bnrsx,krvv98,2,Tue Jun 30 20:29:00 2015 UTC,It may be a 7 year extension on to this year.
cowboys,3bnrsx,Leonbethyname,2,Tue Jun 30 20:45:24 2015 UTC,Can't be an extension on the franchise tag. It will be interesting to see if they count the 13 million into the first year though. Would make later years less expensive towards the cap.
cowboys,3bnrsx,cowboys9366,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:25:59 2015 UTC,They probably will. The 13 million is already counting against the cap. We don't really need the space.

cowboys,3bnrsx,IMStealthy,6,Tue Jun 30 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"Seems like a solid deal, I just hope his agents don't screw this up."
cowboys,3bnrsx,emackn,3,Tue Jun 30 20:23:21 2015 UTC,Does deal like this help us cap wise this year?  Would it lower his number from the 12 mil franchise number?
cowboys,3bnrsx,Kalanar,7,Tue Jun 30 20:38:13 2015 UTC,It could it just all depends on how they set it up. There isn't really reason for it to free up additional cap room however.  We have enough cap room currently and will probably be rolling some over to next year depending on what happens with Hardy.
cowboys,3bnrsx,WallyMetropolis,3,Tue Jun 30 21:10:39 2015 UTC,"I doubt Dallas intends to go spend a bunch of money in FA after this, this season. Freeing up this year's cap is not a huge priority. And, really, making next year's more friendly to the team is probably a better thing to focus on."
cowboys,3bnrsx,protoplast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:59:47 2015 UTC,It should be about a 7mil cap hit this year.
cowboys,3bnrsx,kylerm42,3,Wed Jul 1 01:42:04 2015 UTC,Seems like the team got what they wanted. It's closer to the $40m guaranteed they were offering than the $60m he supposedly wanted. Hopefully none of it matters and we get to see him retire with us after getting a couple rings and then make a move to Canton.

I gave him the usual bullshit, and we bet on Dez jerseys if there was any news in the next 3 days. Day 3 comes, and there's news about a close contract. It's ok, he's a great friend, so I don't mind buying him a jersey."

cowboys,3bnrsx,nu1stunna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:44:57 2015 UTC,This is actually a pretty reasonable deal for the Cowboys. I hope they don't choose to load the money into the years where they know Romo is retired and then we suck ass for 4 years because we are handicapped.

cowboys,3bnrsx,WallyMetropolis,5,Tue Jun 30 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"AP makes the franchise tag for a RB really expensive. If Dallas wanted to pay that much for Murray, he'd have agreed. No need to resort to using a tag. The issue wasn't that Dallas couldn't put together the money to keep Murray. The issue was that they didn't think he was worth paying what it would take to keep him."
cowboys,3bnrsx,Legit_Apple,-2,Wed Jul 1 00:02:02 2015 UTC,I don’t know why you’re being downvoted. That’s what I’ve been saying since the end of the season. I still think we could have kept both and I really don’t get why we didn’t try harder to. I am kind of worried about our running back situation this year but I guess we’ll just see what happens when the season comes.
cowboys,3bnrsx,Mithrawn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:51:19 2015 UTC,I think it is an unpopular opinion because people didn't want to see Murray get paid a lot because of the perceived lack of value in a RB and in part out of a forced optimism (that I share) that what we have on the team can get the job done with that O-line. Nobody wants to be wrong about Murray because it means we are back in the 8-8 shit storm and we could have kept him.
