Unlikely however, because it is LCD-based A NES knockoff, NES is a go-to for Chinese pirates, the multicart makes it more likely."

I wish I'd bought them but my parents wouldn't let me for obvious reasons
crappyoffbrands,3dqt4z,jtcglasson,2,Sat Jul 18 17:00:57 2015 UTC,Did you inform them of the potential investment value of selling them to game paraphernalia collectors?

Its even better when they accidentally grab some weird fetishy fan art
