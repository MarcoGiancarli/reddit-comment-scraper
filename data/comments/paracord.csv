paracord,3dt80k,jshin44,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:47:35 2015 UTC,"You'd need two pieces of paracord, maybe about one foot for the black piece and three feet for the white.    Fold the white piece in half and hold it at the bend together with one end of the black piece.  You might use a small rubber band to hold them all together.    Start braiding until you're almost out of black (1-2 inches left) and stick another rubber band to hold that end together.    Take the two loose white ends and feed them back through the bend where you started. Tie them off with an overhand knot.    I can't quite see how they tied the black ends off but it also looks like just a simple overhand knot.  You'll probable need to make one or two to figure out the exact lengths of paracord you need."

The bearings I used for this were 5/8"". I didn't use a ""jig,"" I just wrapped the cord around two fingers on my left hand, leaving it loose enough to slip the ball inside.  I thought an easy way to make a jig would be to simply drive four nails into a piece of wood. But honestly, wrapping the cord around my fingers worked pretty well. (I saw a youtube video where a guy did it that way).  I was just playing around, and didn't know what to do with it when it was finished so I added it to the handle of this leather sap.  My first monkey fists  I've got some more paracord, some larger steel balls, and a ""fid"" ordered from Amazon. I plan to play around with it this weekend and make a couple more monkey fists, with  four-strand braid handles.  These were my first attempts at braids, finished with crown knots:  4-strand braids"

Mora sheaths are pretty ugly and this didn't require a ton of skill so I thought it was a no-brainer. Used 10 feet of TOUGH-GRID 750lb paracord on a Morakniv Companion HD sheath. Figured out the technique from here and here. This was actually my 3rd attempt (screwed up the direction of some of the loops on the first try and the 2nd try slid off the sheath after I was done with it).  Quesiton: What should I do with the loose ends? I've got them tucked in on the back side of the sheath where they're out of the way, but is there something better I could do with them?"

In this version I fucked up so when adjusting you're sliding the metal bead up and down the cord which seemed nice but it would sometimes snag on the cord. This is the proper way of how it should work. You can kind of figure out how I put it together here. The adjustable loop works much better this way."

paracord,3d0rg7,otter_bots,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:58:04 2015 UTC,Would you go into s little more detail on the tubing to bead process and where you got the tubing?
paracord,3d0rg7,otter_bots,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:16:13 2015 UTC,I had a feeling someone would ask. When I replied to this dude I was in a huge hurry to meet up with family so I apologize for the shitty tutorial.  So I'm really new to this so bear with me.   I ordered a bunch of cord and some tubing and the clasps I use are from various sources like amazon and aliexpress.  I don't have a workbench so I just use my weak ass IKEA desk and my tube cutting jig that I ordered had not came in yet so I was sawing free hand so If you were to look at these up close you would notice some really uneven edges though I think it works since I patina/distress the beads anyway.   Once I've scored and cut my beads to size I sand down the uneven edges to make them less so. I sanded them down until the edges are somewhat rounded. I use a medium grit paper to sand the surface of the bead to give it a more distressed look. This effect looks much better when you patina the beads like I did in this bracelet. In that link there should be another link to how to patina the bead if you're interested in that.   Let me know if this helps! I feel like this subreddit doesn't get nearly enough loving as it should and I love talking to people about it.

paracord,3adwir,Sgt_45Bravo,2,Sat Jun 20 05:35:22 2015 UTC,"I melt and crimp the cord ends with my hemostats, which makes the end of the paracord strand hard and wider than the bead hole, so they will not slide off the end.  Some folks will heat the paracord ends and flatten them out against the bottom of the lanyard bead with the side of their lighter or a knife blade for the same effect.    You could tie stopper knot for a more decorative finish, like a Celtic button knot, as an alternative to the simpler ends I've used on this project."

paracord,392gso,onyxsamurai,3,Mon Jun 8 19:46:17 2015 UTC,My answer for most finishes is the diamond knot. I haven't worked with waxed thread before but I think if you use 4 strands to make a crown sinnet and whip it into a diamond knot then thread the remaining 2 strands through the middle of the 4 strand diamond knot and finish with a 2 strand diamond knot it would hold up nicely and look pretty good. However I'm not sure of the bulk it would add and it would be difficult work at that size.

The thread is definitely strong enough, adds a little color, and isn't bulky and create bulges in my pockets.   However, the knots I've used to finish the braid failed once and the second variation I have now looks stronger but is bulky.   What would be the most secure and least bulky way to tie of this braid to make a circle like a bracelet?

My hands/fingers do bother me a good bit, so limited time with each tying session.

But I think it'll hold nicely and looks cool.  I also added a clove hitch since I had extra cord and didn't want to cut it off.  I wrapped it because the head was a little loose from throwing it (notice wear marks on wood at bottom of lashing).  I won't be throwing it anymore and will mainly use it for camping but that head is on there tight now.  Love how it looks and can't wait to do the wrap up the handle on it.  Probably going to go about half way up from the bottom.  Unsure of how much cord I used, had a ball of 100 feet lying around and just took what I needed."

paracord,3784d2,randarrow,2,Mon May 25 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know about others but I think that you need roughly 1.25 feet per inch. I know that you will end up having extra length at the end, but it is so much easier to have more length than to have not enough length."

paracord,373ydb,dia_outro,2,Sun May 24 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"Ah. Ball cord is basically ceiling fan pull chains. They come in several sizes. I used it in a snake whip because they were smaller and would fit readily into a gutted length of paracord whereas the standard BBs are a total pain in the ass. Even when I used a bigger diameter rope as my core, they still snagged,I guess because of the loose braid. The size of the ball cord don't matter as much as getting it to fit in your core, in my opinion. I hope I helped a bit, making the whip is frustrating but the finished result and the crack is very satisfying."

paracord,36aud4,pixelpusha,9,Sun May 17 21:31:55 2015 UTC,I'm interested in your waxing process. Mine takes quite a while. Do you wax before or after ? And do you pre-shrink your cord ?
paracord,36aud4,andy-the-englishman,5,Sun May 17 22:24:32 2015 UTC,OP! The people demand answers!!!
paracord,36aud4,Curlaub,3,Mon May 18 00:20:27 2015 UTC,I didn't know you could pre-shrink paracord. What does pre-shrinking do and how does one go about doing so?  My Waxing Process  I just take the smallest pot I have and pour maybe a cup of the beeswax in and melt it down. I should have about an inch of melted wax. While the wax is still warm I toss the bracelet (in its locked state shackle and all) in and let it soak for a minute or so then I flip it and do the same. I then fish it out with a chopstick and let it dry off for a bit. You'll notice that some of the excess wax drys up and creates lumps. To get rid of the excess I toss it in my toaster oven on it's lowest toast setting to melt off the excess at this point I just eyeball it. While it's warm after toasting I go through and wipe any excess off of the shackle with a paper towel and some qtips. That's pretty much it.  If anyone has other/easier ways of waxing please let me know!
paracord,36aud4,andy-the-englishman,1 point,Mon May 18 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i pre-shrink all my paracord. I've done a few experiments and found on a 10ft length you can expect to lose on average around 6 inches of cord.    My shrinking Process    Basically just a pan of water, bring to a roiling boil, fully submerge desired length of cord in the water for a couple of minutes and then let dry naturally.    My Waxing Process    I use a slow cooker. I use bees wax for wearable items and paraffin wax for anything else. I set the slow cooker up with the wax in and wait until it has reached a temperture of around 180 F/85 C (Anything much over that and it seems to ruin the cord). I'll leave it in for about 15 minutes keeping a constant temperature giving it a real good soak. When dry I'll make my paracord creation. After i will wax again. Any excess or unwanted build up i will remove gently with a heat gun.     I learnt this method off a guy that makes paracord bull whips and it works great ! A little long winded but the extra time and the results are awesome."
paracord,36aud4,coltonapo,1 point,Mon May 18 16:41:57 2015 UTC,Hmm intersting. I'll have to try that out for my next one. I need to invest in a slow cooker and a heat gun. I live an an apartment so the desk in my room and my porch are the only work areas I have.
paracord,36aud4,hilld1,3,Mon May 18 17:00:11 2015 UTC,What does the wax do for paracord?
paracord,36aud4,hilld1,6,Sun May 17 21:41:58 2015 UTC,"From the looks of it, it just adds a bit of gloss to the finish. I imagine it would aid in waterproofing as well."
paracord,36aud4,andy-the-englishman,1 point,Sun May 17 21:59:24 2015 UTC,I think it actually loses some of its gloss after the waxing process. Almost looks like a semi-matte finish to me. It def helps with waterproofing but I've heard that the cord actually loses some of it's strength when it's treated with heat so I wouldn't bank on it being very helpful in survival situations.
paracord,36aud4,IronBallsMcGinty,1 point,Mon May 18 17:06:23 2015 UTC,Ah okay. Looking at the pictures on mobile made them look shinier.

I tried one once, but it just took too long, and I'm a neophyte knot-maker, so it just dragged on and on.  I wasn't happy with the aesthetics either, so I just scrapped it.  Do you have much experience with knots before you tried this, or did you just start here and persevere?    Anyhow, Good Luck!"
paracord,35rvx2,Rocksteady2R,1 point,Wed May 13 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks and it depends on the whip  The little 3 footer took about 3-4 hours work while the 5.5 footers took up to 7-8 hours and the 15 footer was almost a months solid work so about 120 hours or more. It also depends how many plaits, a 16 plait 6 foot bullwhip I made took maybe 12 hours work.  Then decorating the whips can take about 2-3 hours alone and then there's working time to get them supple and usable which can take a couple of hours after leaving it over night.  As for the knots I had almost no experience before I started making whips and now I'm learning a couple of new knots a month as they are great for decorating the whips with :)"

If I may ask, do you know how much more abuse or how much longer life a paracord whip has compared to mass produced nylon and other polymer braided whips? I feel like we used to get a good 8 months to a year with a regular whip on the old ranch when my family did Dressage. I know these are bull whips mostly, so how do they compare to leather as well?  Very cool."
paracord,35rvx2,HighSpeed556,0,Wed May 13 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot but they're far from perfect, the whips themselves are solid and good but I need to get better at decorating the handles :)  As for use I can tell you a little. Leather whips have the shortest lives as they need more care and looking after, I have a leather signal whip which I've had close to two years but rarely use, then there's my nylon bullwhip which is coming up to 6 years this winter and have used regularly and has only lasted this long through care and cleaning regularly. A paracord whip has a longer life and needs less care than the other two because while it is resilient and doesn't weather like a nylon whip it is not made of hundreds of little strands which can easily be damaged or broken.  Also if you use your whips as much as my boss and her daughter then I can imagine them running out that quickly. :)"

Three tips:   Until you get used to and learn the right amount of force, don't just strike once strike lots/rapidly, try different levels of force/speed.  Now, I can do it on the second strike with just a flick of the wrist. The first strike does nothing, apparently you need rub off an oxide first. The striker is the flat serrated part and is angled on one side.  Try turning the striker around and trying the other side.  Not sure of the best way to describe it, you push with the sharp side down and the flat side up (angle with most friction).  I can not make sparks with the striker facing up one side, but I can with if facing up the other.   Now, it's just two flips of the wrist and I have a lot of sparks.  I scrub/scrape/shave the ferrosteel rather than strike it now, is the best way to get sparks."

This way when you melt the tip, you're certain that the inner stands don't get shifted back. Im kinda having a hard time saying exactly what im thinking. Think of it like tying a knot in the end of a drawstring on your hooded sweatshirt, to ensure you dont lose the drawstring (core) into the rim of the hood (sheath). Hope that makes sense.

The short black sections attached to the camera body are cobra weaves, about seven inches long and needing about six feet of cord per side.    The neck section of the strap is trilobite, about 24 inches, and about 60 total feet of cord, 30 feet per color. I used a slip joint to couple the two colors together, providing a two toned rope off the starting knot.  All of the rings used are sturdy 1/2"" (If I remember correctly) key rings, and are all weaved in to the design for durability."

Reading your other responses you're doing everything you can but I've found a dumb way that has helped me a lot.    Take a length of paper (about an inch thick) then measuring out the wrist.  Wrap is around her wrist (or clients w/e) and mark how long around the wrist they are.  With that as your guide measure out your cord.  I don't have a formula for you I have just done what you're doing now, trial and error. It also depends on how you're making your weave and buckle.  I get the cord set up through the buckle and add about half an inch for how tight I do the weave.  If you don't give yourself enough slack and you make your bracelet tight, like I do, it will end up short.  Take the paper, add your buckle on either end and add half an inch.  then as you're tying you can compare as you go.  I'll post an album once I get home on how I do it (you don't need a board or template)  but in the mean time, try the paper method"
paracord,340l6k,Jackyll,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:55:25 2015 UTC,Are you doing these by hand?  Or do you have a board made for weaving these?  I built a bracelet board out of scraps in about 30 minutes.

paracord,340l6k,Sgt_45Bravo,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"Well the length is fine, but I think because of the thickness of the paracord (I'm guessing), when it curves around the wrist the interior size gets a lot smaller. I've tried google and some people recommend adding an inch, I've seen charts where only half an inch is added, etc, so I think I'm on the right track with that, but I added a full two inches to this last one and it wasn't enough."
paracord,340l6k,Sgt_45Bravo,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"Are you accounting for the buckle being used? How are you measuring their wrists? How tight you weave makes a difference too.   Obviously, with a king cobra bracelet will need to have more length added to make it comfortable to wear so try this: Let's say you'll be making a king cobra for your wife. Take more paracord than you would usually use to make the bracelet but make sure you measure the lengths. Then start weaving the bracelet as you normally would, but don't finish it. As you get close to the end, put it around your wife's wrist and ask her what is comfortable. Make sure to account for whatever fastening system you are using. Now you'll need to do some measuring. First, measure how much paracord is left over. This will give you an approximate ratio of X inches of paracord is needed for Y inches of woven bracelet. Then measure the length of the woven braid. This should give you an idea of how much length you'll need to add measurements people give you.   You'll also have to be consistent in how you measure people. Make sure you do it the same way every time. I always tell people to measure their wrists with a string, but to leave enough slack that would make it comfortable for them to wear."
paracord,340l6k,Akparacord,2,Mon Apr 27 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"I am accounting for the buckle.

X"" wrist = Y"" bracelet  for each size and a card like that for each style."
paracord,340l6k,tsgilvary,2,Mon Apr 27 21:15:08 2015 UTC,Pretty much though I use a notebook to track my creations. This helps make sure that I keep wasted paracord to a minimum. I do the same for monkey fists and just about anything else that you can make out paracord. It doesn't hurt to tie your favorite knots and have an idea of how much you need to make each project.

I'd go with a paracord strap that's connected to two of these leather patches, or some sort of adjustable loop at the end so you can hook it around and tighten it. Or you could try chancing it and having a loop that's just tight enough to fit around the peg without coming off easily again."

The starting cobra stitch/Solomon bar/Portuguese sinnet tied in red paracord was 15.5 inches long to fit around the deck of cards, using just a tad over 15 feet of cord, and after working the slack out and straightening the woven sections, a little over 38 feet of navy blue paracord was used of the 40 foot length I started with.  More paracord would certainly be needed for a larger pouch, it really will vary depending on the object you're tying it around.

It takes a little practice to nail which ""corner"" to best have the loop exit from, but once you get it, it's pretty easy. It's also better to tie the ball with 3 winds when doing this, 4 gets a bit too tricky, altho it does depend on the size of the knot you use to create the loop."

paracord,336fs8,mynameisalso,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"I'll try. For a 3 strand ball you begin by tying a slip knot in the starting end of the cord, this will allow you to adjust the length of the loop later if you require.   Now start winding the monkeyball, I do this by spreading 2 fingers apart and winding the cord around them 3 times (keep the slip knot out of it for the time being), then wind between my fingers around the middle of those first 3 winds. Now I slide it off my fingers and put the slip knot into the beginning of the cage where you'd normally put a ball with the loop poking out of one of the open sides. Now I'd wind the final 3 loops and tighten it all up. Trim and singe the exiting cord and you should have a finished 3 strand monkeyball with a loop.  It takes practice and a bit of thought to get it right, but it does make a good keychain.  edit: explaining how to do a complex knot is not easy."

These have a load of at least 400 pounds I'm guessing, and your cord isn't going to fail until around 1/2 ton minimum.

Add some extra length in case you need a bit more. Better to have lots of extra length than be short.  If you're doing more than 1 weave pattern for the whole thing, do a 1"" test strip for each pattern then calculate accordingly."

paracord,3294v2,xPLATINUMxDOGx,2,Sat Apr 11 23:31:21 2015 UTC,It's good to do a test like said earlier but the rule of thumb for the cobra weave is this: (Bracelet length in inches)x(7)=(amount of total cord needed in inches) Again this is just a rule of thumb so if you like to make the weave tighter or looser it will change.

paracord,314zf7,V1P8R1,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:12:22 2015 UTC,This is a fighting knife not a box opener. It has the 'Wave' feature on it which assists you opening the knife as you bring it out of your pocket. Usually carried on a tip up configuration. Look up Southnarc's Reverse Edge methods to learn how to deploy it. If you're going to have it on you better train on it.

But I wouldn't bet on it, I just don't think a curved edge would be helpful in any usual task.  As for fighting, its not long enough, the Wave feature only adds utility. This knife should be considered a tool, not a weapon.  Its funny, I just started carrying a Leatherman in a holster on my hip, and I prefer using the serrated blade because it cuts boxes an tape less aggresivly, it is also ideal for sawing cardboard into any shap I need. The straight blade is too sharp and long. I also carry a Kershaw Cryo, and it is handy enough to take care of any urgent and one handed tasks, I carry that one in my pocket."

paracord,2z6w0p,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:00:21 2015 UTC,"Turk's head knot:       A Turk's head knot is a decorative knot with a variable number of interwoven strands, forming a closed loop. The name is used to describe the general family of all such knots rather than one individual knot. While generally seen made around a cylinder, the knot can also be deformed into a flat, mat-like shape. Some variants can be arranged into a roughly spherical shape, akin to a monkey's fist knot.   The knot is used primarily for decoration and occasionally as anti-chafing protection. A notable practical use for the Turk's head is to mark the ""king spoke"" of a ship's wheel; when this spoke is upright the rudder is in a central position. The knot takes its name from a notional resemblance to a turban (Tr: sarık), though a turban is wound rather than interwoven.  The Turk's head knot is used as a woggle by Scout Leaders who completed their training course and were thus awarded with the Wood Badge insignia.

paracord,2z1d26,twistedtat,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:47:37 2015 UTC,Thanks. I made it a few months ago before I made mine.

paracord,2yxrhf,satanonaskateboard,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:55:58 2015 UTC,What is the knot second from the top?
paracord,2yy0n8,reverends3rvo,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:56:22 2015 UTC,"Shockcord.  Either knotted with a bow-line-esque knot, or closed down with a taught line hitch.  Shockcord is a nice alternative to paracord."
paracord,2yqnlu,sireddisonthethird,16,Thu Mar 12 00:23:05 2015 UTC,Wooo! You're a twentyonaire!!
paracord,2yqnlu,FlowersForMegatron,7,Thu Mar 12 02:44:54 2015 UTC,"Good for you. Considering I've seen them sold for a buck or two at places like Home Depot, its hard to make any money on them unless they have some other sort of novelty to them (Ex: handcuff key, Ferro rod, integrated fire cord or fishing line). Otherwise you almost have to price them no more than $2 since everyone and their mother are making them these days."
paracord,2yqnlu,cywren2550,2,Thu Mar 12 05:42:44 2015 UTC,"Me Ma's selling 'em at her work. They make requests, but soon with the money I just made I'm gonna buy some accessories for it so I could make charms, keychains, etc."

paracord,2yqnlu,eightabove,4,Thu Mar 12 22:33:17 2015 UTC,I'd probably call a bank or an investment company ASAP. You don't just want that kind of cash laying around.
paracord,2yqnlu,TarbuckTransom,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:07:59 2015 UTC,I put it in my wallet. This was really just posing for a picture.
paracord,2yqnlu,TarbuckTransom,2,Thu Mar 12 11:10:15 2015 UTC,How many bracelets does that equate to?
paracord,2yqduz,Havoc1887,2,Wed Mar 11 22:57:28 2015 UTC,"what were you thinking? a cobra braid with a little pendant at the end of it? not a bad idea, not really practical but kinda cool"
paracord,2yqduz,jmonday7814,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:52:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't have a clue what I want. Was just looking for ideas on something cool."
paracord,2yqduz,jmonday7814,2,Thu Mar 12 03:55:20 2015 UTC,alright well now you have my idea...run with it!!
paracord,2yqduz,Freerange_Guitar,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"Cool, once I figure it out I will try to get a post up on here. Thanks!"
paracord,2yqduz,Freerange_Guitar,2,Thu Mar 12 13:19:08 2015 UTC,Actually just saw a car with a short cobra weave leading to a monkey fist and a paracord cross hanging from a guys mirror. Thought the idea was kinda cool.  I work at a car dealership and see this kind of thing relatively often. Still waiting to see a paracord wrapped steering wheel come in. Now THAT would be cool!
paracord,2yqduz,cash-only,1 point,Thu Mar 12 07:09:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. Might have to look into a monkey fist like that. Thanks!"
paracord,2yqduz,cash-only,2,Thu Mar 12 13:18:35 2015 UTC,"Just to clear up a bit it was two different fobs. One monkey fist and one cross. May have worded it a bit wrong there. If you can connect those two that would actually be pretty cool, at least in my head.  Happy tying!"
paracord,2yo4l3,Ohyeahitsbatman,1 point,Wed Mar 11 12:10:13 2015 UTC,"You might want to buy a sheet of the material and cut it yourself. If you are set on having something glow in the dark, some paracord styles have glow in the dark tracers in it like here"
paracord,2yo4l3,Elitexdaniel,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:16:51 2015 UTC,"That site is pretty darn rad, if you ask me.  I remember checking it out months back and forgetting about it.  I think I'll order a few things (will report back)."
paracord,2yeaxg,Bohemous,2,Mon Mar 9 01:46:29 2015 UTC,"I basically want to stop there, with just the chunk of deer antler on the end.  I thought about cutting the two ends short and melting them into blobs that wouldn't fit through the hole, but thought I'd see if anybody has another suggestion."
paracord,2yeaxg,jwthewtfkid,3,Mon Mar 9 01:47:30 2015 UTC,I think a Celtic button knot might do the trick.
paracord,2yeaxg,neilplatform1,3,Mon Mar 9 02:58:35 2015 UTC,A stopper knot like the double overhand or oysterman's
paracord,2yeaxg,freedoomed,2,Mon Mar 9 11:50:08 2015 UTC,wrap a turks head around it!
paracord,2yeaxg,satanonaskateboard,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:01:51 2015 UTC,"That's a knot, right....?"
paracord,2yeaxg,freedoomed,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:57:27 2015 UTC,yes
paracord,2yeaxg,AKBIGCAL,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:41:55 2015 UTC,Do two snake knots around the antler from the holes and melt the ends into it a little.
paracord,2y7ofr,jwthewtfkid,3,Sat Mar 7 04:45:28 2015 UTC,"That is a sexy steering wheel. And if im not mistaken, is that a YJ jeep wrangler?"
paracord,2y7ofr,MercenaryZ93,3,Sat Mar 7 05:26:48 2015 UTC,It's a Grant Challenger series. And yes it's a YJ.
paracord,2y7ofr,awesomeificationist,2,Sat Mar 7 05:46:53 2015 UTC,Should be a YJ
paracord,2y7ofr,ExpiredPlate,2,Sat Mar 7 05:30:50 2015 UTC,You are correct! It's a 1995 Wrangler YJ.
paracord,2y7ofr,lordroy,3,Sat Mar 7 05:45:57 2015 UTC,"Assuming you offroad in your YJ, that'll give you quite a burn if you catch a rut or track and the steering wheel pulls. Not talking shit, just warning you."
paracord,2y7ofr,dweck451,2,Sat Mar 7 09:03:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the warning! I'll definitely keep that in mind.
paracord,2y7ofr,DV_Jellyfish,2,Sat Mar 7 19:44:48 2015 UTC,Looks awesome! Showed it to my girlfriend and now she wants to wrap mine.
paracord,2y7bvc,Smokey347,2,Sat Mar 7 02:34:08 2015 UTC,Nice craftsmanship.
paracord,2y7bvc,setthehook,2,Sat Mar 7 04:48:19 2015 UTC,Thank you! I made this for my aunt's new camera.
paracord,2y5i8d,Smokey347,4,Fri Mar 6 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"Tying It All Together might be the obvious answer, but I like it anyway.  I generally prefer picture-based guides so I can do it at my own pace, instead of having to pause, rewind and resume ad nauseam."
paracord,2y5i8d,Hellrespawn,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:44:04 2015 UTC,That's why I put one clean quick uninterrupted demo at the beginning of all my instructionals now.
paracord,2y5i8d,TarbuckTransom,2,Fri Mar 6 23:50:45 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know a good source with compilations of the different weaves, braids, knots with their proper name?  Doesn't have to be youtube. In fact i prefer it not to be youtube. Looking at pictures is better than maipulating the progress bar to go between steps."
paracord,2y1773,Bobble_Macrocephaly,5,Thu Mar 5 16:14:16 2015 UTC,Depends on the size wrist. Multiple Solomon bar bracelets use the most.
paracord,2y1773,bigpapajon,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:06:28 2015 UTC,"Isn't it also referred to as a double cobra? Either way this guy is most likely right, Solomon bar with another Solomon bar over it. Also you can use gutted paracord and do a third or fourth layer and not lose any real usefulness of the cord."
paracord,2y1773,flamefreak01,2,Fri Mar 6 12:21:27 2015 UTC,"This isn't going to be real helpful, but I've tested 40+ patterns and nothing beats a SpineCoil for density. A 7in bracelet 3/4in thick is ~16ft. I sell them, but it's one of my only revenue streams right now so I don't teach people how to tie them.  Edit: Yup, how dare I try to pay for food. Thanks guys."
paracord,2y1773,TarbuckTransom,2,Thu Mar 5 21:14:46 2015 UTC,Where do you sell them? Interested to support you.
paracord,2y1773,johnmydietsoda,2,Sat Mar 7 07:13:22 2015 UTC,"That's very kind. My etsy and my YouTube where I discuss new products, host knot tying how-to videos, and review gear. I believe there are some things in the shop I need to renew, but the SpineCoil should still be up."
paracord,2y1773,TarbuckTransom,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:49:39 2015 UTC,Next time I get paid I'll pick one up. And I've been looking for a good tutorial series so I'll sub to your channel too. Good luck friend.
paracord,2y1773,johnmydietsoda,2,Sat Mar 7 22:13:58 2015 UTC,"Thankyou so much. If you have any how-to requests I'd be happy to fill them. There's a short list of patterns for quick-release bracelets I plan to post eventually for example, and I can move that further up the queue if you want."
paracord,2xx6y1,Murphking,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:45:52 2015 UTC,Thats cool! How did you  make that braided looking part on the end there?
paracord,2xx6y1,Mister_Critter,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:09:45 2015 UTC,Which end? The knot itself is called a snake knot.
paracord,2xx6y1,Mister_Critter,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"Right on! Its like a badass, good looking version of mine.  I made this lanyard years ago.  http://i.imgur.com/U354x3Y.jpg"

paracord,2xthyk,ExecutiveSkiBum,3,Tue Mar 3 19:30:31 2015 UTC,I pretty much did it free form following concepts like these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAMqZA27iA0 http://www.instructables.com/id/Paracord-multipurpose-bag/  I used a thief knot as my knot
paracord,2xthyk,IAMNOTAMUFFIN,4,Tue Mar 3 20:22:28 2015 UTC,Hub needed a way to carry his helmet while ski touring in the back country. Voila Another pic

paracord,2xthyk,between2,2,Tue Mar 3 20:01:55 2015 UTC,You do realize how awesome this is right?
paracord,2xthyk,marinquake70,2,Tue Mar 3 23:40:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I blush!"
paracord,2xucgz,Classicwgn86,2,Tue Mar 3 23:08:16 2015 UTC,I replaced the broken leather cord with para cord so the treadle would be functional again. Nothing special just thought y'all might get a kick out of it.
paracord,2xoc5d,bobbyrms,2,Mon Mar 2 15:35:17 2015 UTC,have you seen this tutorial? ;)
paracord,2xoc5d,sklicky,1 point,Tue Mar 3 08:12:36 2015 UTC,Thanks!!! I just got in some lanyards and beads and thankfully now I also have an awesome tutorial!!!
paracord,2xoc5d,Ohyeahitsbatman,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:48:57 2015 UTC,Did you put dragonfly paracord on a dragonfly ? Good combo. Looks nice
paracord,2xoc5d,JustforKicks77,1 point,Tue Mar 3 08:41:06 2015 UTC,That's the one
paracord,2xn307,KurtVV,3,Mon Mar 2 05:22:23 2015 UTC,"Mate that's awesome. Gonna do one for myself. I've a similar one for when I scuba dive, but it has a surfing ankle strap for the wrist instead."

paracord,2xiwx3,sireddisonthethird,1 point,Sun Mar 1 02:57:46 2015 UTC,I've thought about doing this.
paracord,2xiwx3,griffinjn,1 point,Sun Mar 1 03:13:38 2015 UTC,It took me two hours and a little over eighty feet of paracord. I'd recommend it during your downtime.
paracord,2xiwx3,griffinjn,1 point,Sun Mar 1 03:27:46 2015 UTC,But what will you do when you wear it out.
paracord,2xiwx3,TheReddition,1 point,Sun Mar 1 03:41:29 2015 UTC,I didn't consider that... maybe choose another color and do it again.
paracord,2xiwx3,Tchrspest,1 point,Sun Mar 1 04:35:08 2015 UTC,"Nope, I wanted this as tight as possible, also I did my longest phone cord. It could be a bad guestimate, but it is a pretty good bit."
paracord,2xiwx3,Tchrspest,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:49:18 2015 UTC,"Damn. I just don't know if I could dedicate that much cordage to a single project man. Haha, it looks awesome though!"
paracord,2xiwx3,merrell056,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I found what I'm doing at work tomorrow.  Edit: Is that two separate cobra braids? I seem to see a small gap right around the middle."
paracord,2xiwx3,merrell056,2,Sun Mar 1 19:58:56 2015 UTC,"Good eye! Yes it is, this took a butt-load of cord, but I underestimated then overestimated the other. I might fix it when I purchase more cord."
paracord,2xiwx3,soreil57,1 point,Mon Mar 2 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"Eh, looks fine to me. I don't even know how it saw it, it blends in nearly perfectly. In any case, that probably made it much more manageable."
paracord,2xjk9m,Casizzle93,1 point,Sun Mar 1 07:19:16 2015 UTC,Aren't you just supposed to put the split ring on the d ring in the collar? Have I really been missing this extra accessory all my dog owning life?
paracord,2xjk9m,Hazelip,2,Sun Mar 1 13:04:32 2015 UTC,I saw this little gadget on another dogs collar so they could switch collars easier but keep the ID tags on.  You have been doing it right so far. This is just a fun add on to make things easier if your like me and change your dogs collar way too often.
paracord,2xi7dq,corpsejelly,4,Sat Feb 28 22:52:58 2015 UTC,"nice man, looks like the inside of my silverado...lol"
paracord,2xi7dq,bayoumetal,5,Sun Mar 1 00:12:59 2015 UTC,This is my very first attempt at using paracord. Let me know if I can improve on anything I did!!
paracord,2xi7dq,KurtVV,5,Sat Feb 28 22:56:28 2015 UTC,How's the grip feel? Improved or more slippery?
paracord,2xi7dq,KurtVV,2,Sun Mar 1 02:41:18 2015 UTC,Definitely more grip. I'm having to get used to having so much more.
paracord,2xi7dq,Littlemoby,2,Sun Mar 1 04:23:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, something to consider I guess"
paracord,2xi7dq,richierich925,3,Sun Mar 1 04:52:53 2015 UTC,That came out real good dude
paracord,2xi7dq,jwthewtfkid,2,Sun Mar 1 19:29:15 2015 UTC,Thanks!
paracord,2xi7dq,jwthewtfkid,2,Mon Mar 2 00:27:04 2015 UTC,How did you secure it so it won't unravel?  I have the same steering wheel in my 03 suburban and I kept having them unravel. Now I have about 2 inches of extra cord hanging that I tug on every once and a while to keep it tight. I love the clean look you have. I did mine all black
paracord,2xh46j,YEE_YEE_2015,2,Sat Feb 28 17:16:56 2015 UTC,Sorry for the late comment but what knot did you use to tie this?

paracord,2xh46j,IronBallsMcGinty,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"It's a doohickey, not the best bottle opener I've ever used but it works. It's quite nice for $5. Edit also it has a box opener on the edge, but it's not as sharp as I'd like."
paracord,2xeosb,Snsbzd,3,Fri Feb 27 23:27:03 2015 UTC,Looks like a simple overhand loop on both sides with the end melted down
paracord,2xeosb,yarboots,3,Sat Feb 28 01:28:12 2015 UTC,Can I buy this bracelet somewhere? It's pretty awesome!
paracord,2xeosb,outta_my_element,2,Sat Feb 28 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"Here you go. There are other similar ones around Etsy under ""anchor paracord nautical bracelet"" but this should be the same one pictured.   Personally, if you can find that brass anchor I would just try and make one myself since as /u/yarboots said, it is only 2 pretty simple knots."
paracord,2xeosb,PattonMagroin,2,Sat Feb 28 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"Google ""anchor charm"" and you'll find the exact charms he used. Though take note, they're pewter with different finishes on them and pewter isn't particularly known for its strength."
paracord,2xeosb,Azbragi,2,Wed Mar 4 06:52:44 2015 UTC,"I think that, fittingly, that knot is an anchor bend: http://www.netknots.com/files/5713/2990/8344/anchor-bend.jpg"

paracord,2xc7yn,ocdsloth,2,Fri Feb 27 10:15:00 2015 UTC,"i have to say i'm more than happy how it looks.  i had only black cord and it ended up looking great. i used cca 6ft of cord for the sheath, and only by luck ended with a great length for the endings. i started from a top, made a twist on the bottom, returned to the top, made another twist than started to wrap around. the first wrap went through the bottom twist and ended it through the top one. tied it with an overhang knot for easy unwrapping.   for the clip i did a cobra, only 3 rows, it holds great and its easy to pull it over the handle but it keeps the knife from getting out.  pls feel free to comment and say what you think  i did try other kinds of ending knots on the clip but the all looked bad (im bad at that :) )"
paracord,2xc7yn,LukeImYourStepfather,1 point,Fri Feb 27 10:25:24 2015 UTC,I have a Mora companion also. I like your work and might follow your lead.

paracord,2x8vwn,soreil57,9,Thu Feb 26 16:39:02 2015 UTC,I tried that with my labs.  They busted the cord in about a day.  2/10  Would not recommend.

paracord,2x8vwn,fidelitypdx,0,Thu Feb 26 23:10:09 2015 UTC,what's the reason you made that site? You neither seem to sell them nor provide instructions on how to make them. Or are you planning on doing one of those things?

paracord,2wws1i,Curlaub,2,Mon Feb 23 20:46:33 2015 UTC,It looks more like they ran both trailing ends of the monkey fist head up and under the two passes for the facemask and melted the ends into eyes.
paracord,2wws1i,gunzor,1 point,Tue Feb 24 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"Im sorry, Im not sure I understand what you mean with the trailing ends? And how would I melt the ends without it running? Melting was my thought, too, but when I try it it runs and looks messy. It looks pretty clean in the pic.  Also, I kinda dont think it was melted into place because if you look at the edge of the eye, you can still see the texture of the cord. I think they cut off the end and glued it. I just havent gotten a chance to try it yet."

paracord,2wws1i,asking-the-questions,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:10:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've tried that, but the results are inconsistent and often hideous... It looks like they've melted the end of a length of cord, cut it off and maybe used an adhesive?"

paracord,2wsi9r,zsiwpoprod,3,Sun Feb 22 21:29:39 2015 UTC,arent some none milspec brands doing that now to try and get in on the market?
paracord,2wsi9r,wilkiag,5,Sun Feb 22 21:37:35 2015 UTC,I'd be surprised if there weren't. But so far most haven't so it's an easy way to dismiss 90% of the fakes out there.
paracord,2wsi9r,zsiwpoprod,3,Sun Feb 22 21:39:04 2015 UTC,true.
paracord,2wsi9r,wilkiag,3,Sun Feb 22 22:16:15 2015 UTC,"I use different paracord in different places.  Crafts look very different with/without mil-spec paracord.  EG, because the non-mil-spec is softer it bends better into strange shapes.  But, mil-spec paracord holds it's shape better.  So, my standard cobra bracelet made with cheap walmart paracord looks like square tiles on top, where my black mil-spec cobra bracelet looks like a series of criss-crossing loops, both are cool in their own way....  Doing actual knot work (tying clothes lines, tying guy lines, practicing knots...) with mil-spec cord is a pain, the knots don't hold.  But, if you want knots that are easy to release, go with mil-spec....  Unfortunately, the mil-spec I have taken is black, so it doesn't turn out well in pictures otherwise I would show you....  Another thing to keep in mind, you planning on using this or just displaying it?"
paracord,2wsi9r,randarrow,2,Mon Feb 23 03:16:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Well it depends on what you would consider using or displaying, I'm intending on making a few bracelets out of it for EDC and wrap the handle of my two EDC backpacks(5.11 Rush24 and Moab6) so that it is useful for when I need some paracord but also looks good."

paracord,2wg9i0,xPLATINUMxDOGx,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:16:53 2015 UTC,"Reliable method for joining ends. Using a fid or a Kelly clamp is necessary, you won't be able to just feed the ends through."
paracord,2wg9i0,JustforKicks77,1 point,Fri Feb 20 02:44:16 2015 UTC,"When I originally started using paracord I used these small heat shrink wraps that would go over fused ends which would give it a better hold, I can find out more about those when I get back home.  Also I usually like to fuse the ends and then melt the fused joint one last time and roll it between my fingers or crimp it with pliers or something of that sort, which will sometimes give it a better hold.  And lastly, it may not be you, because if you try to get away with cheaper paracord I have noticed it really doesn't fuse well with other cords.  Hope this helps"
paracord,2wfk4j,suarezzcrew,2,Thu Feb 19 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"I'd go for about 3 colours totalling ~60m in your position. Enough colours to mix and match, enough length to experiment with things. Also get maybe 2 dozen buckles total across a few sizes. Biggest recommendation is that you keep trying new patterns after you get it down."
paracord,2wfk4j,TarbuckTransom,2,Thu Feb 19 16:52:10 2015 UTC,"Great advice! How many bracelets would you say 60m would give me? I know it depends on what kids of weave patterns etc, but would it be around 15/30/45/60 ? So far I have 30 buckles of 3 different sizes(they were cheaper to buy in 10's).   I have seen so many different patterns and they all look cool. So I will try to do them all at one point. Actually just did a Ring of the cobra weave for my thumb while waiting for my eggs to boil. Its a bit uneven but good for a first try since i used a pair of extra shoelaces."
paracord,2wfk4j,TarbuckTransom,2,Thu Feb 19 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"A bracelet is 2-5m each depending on pattern, usually ~3.2m on average for what I see most people make. I recommend FusionKnots.com for cool patterns and charms."

paracord,2wfk4j,Broccolli1500,2,Thu Feb 19 21:08:20 2015 UTC,"I would say keep it to 3-5 colors, but try to have them all match/contrast. After that, get a selection of buckles, and maybe some beads if they have some more inexpensive ones.
