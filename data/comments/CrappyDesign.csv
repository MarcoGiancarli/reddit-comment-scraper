CrappyDesign,3dy3zi,MonsieurCandie,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:50 2015 UTC,I see the KKK very easily. The reason you don't is because your mind alread thinks it's kickboxing when it sees K##K Boxing.   edit: Here it is without the 'boxing': KKK

CrappyDesign,3dy3zi,daimposter,0,Mon Jul 20 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"It's not really a matter of viewpoints rather basic psychology. In situations with ambiguity such as in this, your brain can be manipulated quite easily to see one or another.  In this case your brain is naturally inclined to fill in the letters I and C due to the context (as in Kick). However the title of the post primes you to increase the chances that you see KKK. I can almost guarantee that if the title wasn't there you would have read it as Kick.  If you want further evidence on this, there is a chapter dedicated to ambiguity in the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahnemn. There is an example almost exactly like this one which shows exactly how context affects ambiguity."
