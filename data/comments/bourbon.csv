bourbon,3e3shd,DamienStark,2,Tue Jul 21 20:21:45 2015 UTC,I may even go buy a bottle of this soon as a local store has a private Barrel of it.
bourbon,3e3shd,signde,4,Tue Jul 21 23:08:18 2015 UTC,"Good afternoon all! I have not enjoyed Knob Creek very much to this point as you may have seen in my previous reviews of the bourbon and the rye. There's still one product under this label that has a chance, Knob Creek Smoked Maple Single Barrel! I acquired this sample in a swap with /u/1StrongPT and today I present my review of it!     Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve, 9 years old, 60% ABV, Usually around $45 by me  Nose Heavy on the caramel, some vanilla, roasted peanuts, spicy oak, pepper. Any nuance that it may have is being covered by the alcohol presence. This is a step way above that of the standard bourbon, but still not my favorite. 7/10  Taste Honey roasted peanuts, plenty of oak, caramel, cola, slightly sour yeast, cocoa. This reminds me a lot of what Booker's tastes like, only not as refined. This is bold and aggressive and pretty enjoyable overall. 44/50  Body A nice medium body that leaves behind minimal oil. Definitely a win here. 10/10  Finish A deep burn that seemingly will never end. Having not been prepared for it I would liken this to a bad episode of acid re-flux. Once the overwhelming heat dies it takes much of the flavor with it. 12/20  Value I see this vary in price from $40-$55 here, there is a store that has a private barrel of it at $40. I would say that is a more than fair price for this whiskey. 8/10    Overall This whiskey was almost a homerun for me. I really liked the flavors it has, the mouth feel is great, and it's reasonably priced most places by me. However I just can't look past the overwhelming finish. This reminds me quite a bit of Booker's but more rough around the edge and aggressive as opposed to intense. If you like Knob Creek you'll likely love this. Hell, even if you're like me and HATE Knob Creek you'll find something you can enjoy (for the most part) in their Single Barrel Reserve. Total: 81/100  Bourbon Review 81  Network Review 123"
bourbon,3e3shd,rapidcalm,2,Tue Jul 21 19:05:09 2015 UTC,i'm a big booker's fan but i actually feel like this is more refined than booker's. booker's is pretty rough and tumble. i like how the extra few years in the wood have smoothed out some the youngness booker's brings. there's both great bourbons though and like you said at $40 it's well priced.
bourbon,3e5d1n,Ethanized,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:10:21 2015 UTC,"NOT a blind tasting, but a sample that was gifted to me. I’ve considered picking up a bottle of Johnny before, so this was a pleasant surprise.     Johnny Drum Private Stock – 50.5%    Category Blind Notes Score    Setup: Neat, INAO, rested 20 minutes.    Color: Amber.    Nose: Very light nose, have to work really hard to pick up the oak and some caramel-apples in the background. Some char shows up there as well. 21/30   Taste: The oak and apples come through quite nicely, more than I would expect based on the nose. 24/30   Body: Warm on the palate, a little sharp at first. Light-ish body. 7/10   Finish: The finish is pleasantly warm and lingering. Just a touch sweet - but not overwhelmingly so. A hint of bitter char shows up as well, out of balance. 19/30   Score: ~ 71/100   Value: @$33 for 750ml (5 = must buy; 4 = good buy; 3 = priced right; 2 = overpriced; 1 = avoid). 2/5       Average bourbon score to date: 80     So Johnny boy has some character, but it’s primarily in the form of char. I’ve found that I pick up two forms of char: the good kind is this earthy, natural char. Think of a good BBQ smoker with natural wood that’s just fully started cooking. It’s a natural, wood-smoke, kind of flavor. I get hints of this in nice bottles of bourbon like a good FR store pick.  The other is more of a charcoal flavor. Like a fire that’s gone out and cooled off. Instead of earthy, it’s more medicinal/chemical, and I find it a detractor. The Drum, sadly, is the latter kind of char. Glad I got to try this one for free, I won’t be buying a bottle."
bourbon,3e46jx,BDK235,4,Tue Jul 21 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"This question gets asked almost daily here so doing a quick search in this subreddit will get you a lot more responses and opinions. Also, the sidebar has some useful information for bottle recommendations.   If they really like Woodford, I'd go with Woodford Double Oaked or Single Barrel they're basically nicer, more expensive versions of the standard offering"
bourbon,3e46jx,Razzafrachen,3,Tue Jul 21 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to impress, then look for a Four Roses, Single Barrel, Barrel Strength bottle (recipes OBSV or OBSK will likely fit their tastes).  The bottles will have that letter-designated recipe printed on the side.    Those single barrel, barrel strength bottles are considered ""great"" in the bourbon community, they usually run about $65, and your co-worker will think you are amazing.  Like was mentioned, Blanton's is a safe choice with a bottle that is just perfect for gifting (you will see what I mean when you see the bottle).  It is a good bourbon that won't disappoint and usually runs $55-$60.  Bourbons that will also wow, but are not as much bang for the buck, are more expensive offerings like Barterhouse, Rhetoric, Forged Oak and Jefferson's Ocean Voyage.  Those bottles often have more buzz surrounding them due to their higher price tags, but they are not considered as good in this rbourbon community as ANY of the Four Roses, Single Barrel, Barrel Strength bottles.  On the wow factor again, a gorgeous looking bottle is Willet Pot Still Reserve bourbon.  It gets decent reviews (again, not as good as the Four Roses, Single Barrel, Barrel Strength bottles) and makes an impression with its unique, very tall bottle.  Hope that helps."

bourbon,3e1l53,ReadyWillingAndAbe,6,Tue Jul 21 06:41:15 2015 UTC,"Greetings fellow /r/bourbon aficionados! – This is rbourbon review #5, from me.  Four Roses, Store Select, Single Barrel, Barrel Strength OBSF – Aged 11 Years, 1 Month (60% corn, 35% rye, 5% barley) – Selected by Downtown Fine Spirits and Wines in Colorado Springs, CO.  Barrel Strength at 120 Proof (60%) – Warehouse No. GW (so this was aged in the West end of warehouse G), Barrel No. 81-4K (which means it was aged on the 81st Rack, the 4th tier, and the 11th Barrel).  The first three pours over five days from this bottle, all neat in a glencairn glass.  Color:  Amber (of course).  Not as dark as I would have guessed after 11+ years in the barrel.  Nose:  I get real sugar (not white sugar, or even honey, but something else sweet like agave nectar), and typical bourbon stuff like brown sugar and vanilla.  The side of the bottle has descriptors for the OBSF recipe of “herbal” and “smooth.”  They aren’t kidding.  There are grassy, fresh garden herbs, and rye/dill notes that are all easily perceived.  For being 120 proof, there is very little burn to the nose.  The only burn in the nostrils I received was when I inhaled very deep, and that wasn’t much of an alcohol burn, even then.  Palate:  Mouthfeel is medium+.  Good, solid feel to this bourbon.  You certainly taste the 35% rye in the palate.  It’s got a dill flavor you get with some ryes, similar to a rye whiskey I have had in the past (High West Rendezvous Rye), but not as pronounced, of course.  This OBSF isn’t as sweet as standard bourbons.  There’s an initial flash of sugar that is very brief, but then it moves quick into drier spices, dill, and a peppery quality that is well integrated.  If you are looking for a sweeter caramel or butterscotch kind of bourbon profile, you should skip this OBSF.  It’s got sweetness, but it is well in the background versus the foreground.  Finish:  A very nice, warming finish.  It heats the entire tongue (without it being too much) and even leaves some heat on the lips.  But there is little to no heat or burn in the throat.  It’s right where the heat should be.  This is about as smooth as 120 proof gets, I believe.  No rough edges, whatsoever.  Rating: 87/100   A solid B/B+ grade from me.  I get what it is trying to do with the herbal and dill flavors, and it does those really well.  It is also super smooth.  But I’m not a big fan of the dill-pickle-in-my-whiskey flavor, so the strength of this particular OBSF recipe was not in my wheelhouse.  Honestly, I almost felt like I was drinking a smooth rye whiskey, at times.  I still enjoy it and will have a good time finishing the bottle, don’t get me wrong.  It’s just not knocking my socks off and curling my toes.  But that is also not the fault of the bourbon.  It’s very good stuff.  If you are a fan of rye whiskey that has that solid dill profile, you will no doubt adore this OBSF barrel strength recipe from Downtown Fine Spirits and Wine in Colorado Springs.  And your grade will be higher than mine.  Value:  The store was selling this for $67+, I believe, but they give a 3% discount for cash purchases.  It’s a smidge on the higher end for these Four Roses, Single Barrel, Barrel Strength bottles, but it is still a good value for these bottles.  And it’s a fantastic store for bourbon and even scotch.  Greg, the owner, is awesome and knows his stuff.  Stop in, if you ever get the chance.  [Edit to correct spelling and add minor details]"

You say that as if people with enough money to drop $2-500 on a bottle of whiskey couldn't possibly be speculators..... Raising the bar of entry can only do so much to deter people who know that something they can afford will grow in value. When the bubble pops, fuck am!you may not have gotten to try that run of whiskey you wanted to try, but you're not sitting on a $150 bottle of hooch that potentially sucks and may be worthless in a few years. And if you don't miss put, you're not paying an arm and a leg for bottles set at reactionary prices meant to deter people who wouldn't drink it..."

If Sazerac were to double or triple the price of BTAC and VW, the flipperz and speculators would just expect to capture that in their overhead, too, and I'm not sure it makes the stuff any more available than it already is.   At the end of the day, the difference between a $315 Willett C barrel marked up to $630 and an $80 PVW15 marked up to $630 is that there's actually a chance that I can hard work or luck my way into a PVW15 out in the wild for $80."

The average buyer still can't get a WFE C barrel any easier than WLW or Saz 18.

This is known as a veblen good https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good. This is basically the argument that increasjng retail will increase the secondary. But in a perfect market increasing retail should actually lower the secondary. It's unclear exactly what would happen if BT does increase prices, but that's also because the market is screwed up in how bottles are allocated and not just price. It's no surprise that prices keep going up in NYC retail; cost ofnliving is higher and people with higher income will pay more. But then there's also the wild card that is restaurants. I don't think the secondary is going to burst for several more years precisely because people have no issues paying the secondary (or more) for 1 or 2 oz drinks."

bourbon,3dyzrj,Ethanized,14,Mon Jul 20 20:21:03 2015 UTC,"I am very glad that Buffalo Trace is conducting these experiments in a reasonably scientific manner.  The due the knowledge is gained, I believe that none of the whiskeys that are produced can be called failures.  It's also nice that they are sharing the results of many of these experiments openly -- other distillers can also improve the quality of their product based on the results of the Buffalo Trace experiments.  It's also interesting to note that the experiments are largely resulting in confirmation that ""yup, we've been doing it the right way for a long time now."""

bourbon,3dyzrj,BourbonNerd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. As a scientist I wouldn't categorize these as ""failures"". They successfully demonstrated the effects of varying the particular parameter(s) being tested. It just so happens that in these cases the resulting product did not have a sufficiently appealing profile to merit its sale. There was still important data obtained, so no failure.   To me, a failed experiment would be one in which no useful data was obtained, such as if a barrel leaked out all the contents and so could not be sampled. At worst these experiments disproved some hypothesis about the effects of the particular variations (though we don't know the hypotheses that were being tested so some of them could actually have been confirmed).  As you said, if nothing else these ""failures"" show why current practices work, and at least some scientific rigor has been applied to understanding the process better and allowed several variation pathways to be checked off the list of potential adjustments to making better product.

They have 4000 experimental barrels - that would mean tasting more than 20 barrels a day (given 200 working days) - and that it would be a teams full time job (and doesn't account for the actual job of picking whisky that actually goes in real products!).

bourbon,3dydqe,stringfellow-hawke,9,Mon Jul 20 15:24:10 2015 UTC,"Greeting /r/bourbon. Today I wanted to share my thoughts on Larceny from Heaven Hill. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this solid wheater.  Background  Every great Bourbon needs a great story, and as we know, sometimes these stories can stretch the truth if not be an outright fantasy. Old Fitzgerald was a fantasy of the best distiller (John E. Fitzgerald) making the best Bourbon in the land that most can't buy. As it turns out, there actually may have been a John E. Fitzgerald, but he wasn't a distiller. Fitzgerald was actually a Treasury agency working for the Feds. The new story goes that John E. Fitzgerald was charged with safeguarding stocks of whiskey, but he happened to have a taste for the brown stuff. He was known to have “sampled” barrels to the extent some barrels became pretty light. When these barrels were removed from the warehouses, staff called them Fitzgerald barrels due to the considerable loss.  Heaven Hill branded Larceny with this new legend.  Details None, Barrels aged 6-12 Years Old. 92-proof. Wheated Bourbon. Paid $25.  Aroma Brown sugar, nail polish, charred oak, fruity, cherries and bananas. Vanilla.  Flavor Sweet up front with bunches of caramel and vanilla. Cinnamon. Some harshness sort of medicinal. Roasted corn. Some alcohol heat. Thick oak flavors with a little astringency. Nice thick mouthfeel.  Overall Larceny is a nice Bourbon and given it’s wheated and a good price are bonuses. If you're a fan of wheated Bourbons, that is Bourbons with a recipe of wheat rather than spicy rye, you don't have a lot options that are both budget friendly and found on shelves. Larceny isn't as widely available as many mainstream Bourbons, but where it is distributed it seems to be on the shelves.  Larceny is lively with some bite, but also carries some age with nice oak profile. The lively side I’m getting the roasted corn and rougher alcohols I usually get from younger Bourbons, but nice dulled oak profiles from more aged Bourbons. The first few sips I get a little harshness, but once I ease into Larceny the palate adjusts and it’s more enjoyable. If needed, a little splash of water helps.  Being about $25 is a nice price for a quality Bourbon and certainly worth checking out.  Recommendation Buy a Glass - 3.5 out of 5.0 Rating  (My 5 point scale: Pass, Try a Glass, Buy a Bottle, Buy Again, Shut Up and Take My Money - Bottle price is taken into consideration for recommendations.)  Buying Options and Further Research  If you’re looking to check out other wheated Bourbons in this price range, I’d suggest looking at Weller 12, Old Weller Antique, and Maker’s Mark.

bourbon,3dydqe,an_actual_lawyer,4,Mon Jul 20 15:26:04 2015 UTC,This is ~$33 for a 1.75 at Costco.  Excellent value at that price.
bourbon,3dydqe,PaperCow,3,Mon Jul 20 18:42:04 2015 UTC,Good review. At first I wasn't a big fan of this one but my bottle is slowly growing on me. The slightly medicinal quality you pointed out kind of turned me off and I hadn't retried it for a couple weeks after I got it. Tried it again last night and got a really strong flavor of walnuts that I enjoyed but I had been drinking some other stuff so my palate might have been a bit wrecked.
bourbon,3dydqe,fromkentucky,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"I usually have a bottle of this sitting around. It's not my favorite, but I prefer it to Weller for a standard bourbon."
bourbon,3dydqe,kbphoto,2,Mon Jul 20 18:53:34 2015 UTC,This is one of only two bottles I've ever bought and gave away.  I just didn't like it from the first pour.  I had a pour a few days later and it just didn't agree with me.  Glad someone out there digs it.
bourbon,3dydqe,trickmonkey25,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"I found this for about $23 in Tennessee. I really enjoy the taste, but I found that it did not agree with me. After 2 glasses, I could feel it the next morning, which is not common for me"

bourbon,3dz5de,tnpoplar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:19:43 2015 UTC,This. I have a couple of meh bottles in the collection but the Black Maple Hill Rye 2014 is without question the worst. It just tastes like someone's bad idea of what a rye should taste like.
bourbon,3dz5de,radiozip,2,Tue Jul 21 17:56:32 2015 UTC,Are Old Crow and Rebel Yell still the low shelfs to avoid? Or has the bourbon shortage made those acceptable lol

bourbon,3dz5de,1nn0v8r,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:12 2015 UTC,Stay away from whisky flavored with anything that isn't a barrel finish. First bottle of Copper Fox Rye I ever had (one of their first batches) was about as bad as its been for me. Subsequently I have had a more recent bottling of the Rye (2013) and it was much improved and certainly presented an interesting take on rye whisky.
bourbon,3dz5de,Anyoldcard,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:30 2015 UTC,Smooth Ambler Yearling left me gagging.   I gifted the remainder to a friend with an indomitable palate.

bourbon,3dz5de,slanderousu,3,Tue Jul 21 13:56:14 2015 UTC,I have heard ....not good things about Larceny. But it always seems to be on sampling lists and tasting menu's.... almost as though it is being pushed a bit by the distiller.
bourbon,3dz5de,Doneeb,6,Mon Jul 20 19:00:25 2015 UTC,A lot of people like Larceny though.  Bourbon doesn't have a good/bad dichotomy like you're looking for.
bourbon,3dz5de,reallifedog,3,Mon Jul 20 19:06:14 2015 UTC,Larceny is harmless.
bourbon,3dz5de,SimonBeard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:49:37 2015 UTC,Actually just polished off a bottle of Larceny with my roommate. It gets a lot of hard here but for a cheap wheated bourbon I do enjoy it every once in a while.
bourbon,3dz5de,yobotomy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:05 2015 UTC,I like to recommend Larceny to people who are super into Jack Daniels and the like. It seems to appeal to the commercial whiskey palate while being marginally better.
bourbon,3dz5de,whiskeydragon,2,Wed Jul 22 00:55:31 2015 UTC,Larceny isn't very good. But the only thing about Rowan's creek I don't like is the price. Should be a bit cheaper.
bourbon,3dz5de,radicaleggnog,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"In my opinion you didn't receive good advice from the whisky guy.  Corner Creek is actually quite good, especially for the price. I haven't tried Duke so I can't say if he was 1 for 2 or 0 for 2 on recs. :-)"

bourbon,3dz5de,slanderousu,4,Mon Jul 20 19:06:56 2015 UTC,Fireball doesn't claim to be bourbon - it's liqeur blended with cinnamon and whiskey.
bourbon,3dz5de,MiguelKantorito,2,Mon Jul 20 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, fair, it doesn't say bourbon, and it definitely doesn't say liqueur.  It says Cinnamon Whisky.  Which is to say, it claims to be a whisky and not a liqueur.  I say bullshit to that too though."
bourbon,3dz5de,slanderousu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:17 2015 UTC,I looked at some labels and it looks like on international labels it says liqueur and domestic says cinnamon whiskey.
bourbon,3dz5de,terrapincaboose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:14 2015 UTC,Yeah in the US its labeled a whisky.  It appears to skirt the definition by being imported from Canada.  The website though clearly says whisky so that's how they are advertising themselves.

bourbon,3dz5de,Initiative232,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:32 2015 UTC,Border Bourbon. Being a Wisconsinite I wanted to support a WI distillery but it is absolutely terrible.  I've tried vatting it with everything from EC12 & Stagg Jr to Old Blowhard & WT101 and it ends up soiling everything it touches. Not a bad looking bottle though.
bourbon,3dz5de,casually_indifferent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:03 2015 UTC,"Wonder if it is made by the same out fit I am seeing new spirits from up here in Alberta.

bourbon,3dz5de,adenzerda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"They are not, Border Bourbon is from 45'th parallel a small little micro distillery towards Minneapolis. I have heard decent things about some of the 45'th stuff though i guess i wont go out of my way to try the bourbon. Minhas is the former Joseph Huber beer company facility in southern WI, that was bought to provide crappy beer for originally a Canadian gas station chain owned by the guy that bought the brewery(boxer and mountain creek i think are their larger brands), now since expanded to produce liquor as well with just as poor results."

Utterly boring nose and flavor, then this huge bitterness comes rolling up from the back and leaves a sour taste in your mouth for way too long. Gave it away for mixing.  In fairness, it's a single barrel product, I believe."
bourbon,3dz5de,terrapincaboose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:19 2015 UTC,"Jim Beam white label is horrible to me, just tastes like cheap, pale, bourbon flavored whiskey. I'm sure there's plenty of disagreement, but for me, this is a ""never again.""  I also bought Stetson's Bourbon on a whim. Simple, boring, average with nothing special about it. Not getting better the more I drink it, in fact, I've drank better stuff recently which is making Stetson taste even more inadequate. I woulda gotten cheaper stuff if I wanted to mix it with soda, but that seems to be Stetson's destiny."
bourbon,3dz5de,Mail_Me_Yuengling,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"I truly dislike Jim Beam. It's boring, bland, and leaves a pretty nasty aftertaste in my mouth for up to an hour after consuming it."
bourbon,3dz5de,terrapincaboose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:58:27 2015 UTC,Knob Creek Smoked Maple. I was gifted a bottle and the maple flavor is so strong and overpowering that it ruined the drink. Might be useful as a small part of a mixer but as a bourbon it is horrible.
bourbon,3dz5de,adenzerda,3,Mon Jul 20 21:17:29 2015 UTC,Throw a cup of it in a double boiler and reduce it into a syrup and it goes very well on a lot of things.
bourbon,3dz5de,snaffler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:13 2015 UTC,I come from the land of real maple syrup. That said if it ends up sitting on the shelf for a long time I might give it a try.

bourbon,3dz5de,Neversafeforlife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:58 2015 UTC,The worst bourbon I've ever had was a 12 year version of the one bourbon everybody likes to say is the best -- other than some white dog whisky I finished off myself in new oak barrels. That was truly undrinkable. Like turpentine.
bourbon,3dwe7g,WhiskeyMasterRace,6,Mon Jul 20 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"/r/bourbon, I ask that you ask yourself this question...what does the bourbon world need? Anyone? Alright, I'll go...MORE WHEATED BOURBON! I'm a big fan on the Weller line up and I've enjoyed Maker's on a number of occasions, but beyond that, there is little left in the consumer realm. I've yet to try Larceny or Bernheim (though it's a wheat whisky), but those to my knowledge round out the affordable and semi-plentiful options. Recently 1792 announced a Sweet Wheat bourbon that had me instantly excited to try it! Thanks to a swap with /u/Ethanized I am pleased to bring you another review!     1792 Sweet Wheat, 45.6% ABV, Price unknown as it's not available in CT yet  Nose Warm and inviting! Vanilla, oak, honey, orange peel, faint clove, nutmeg. A tad one dimensional with the orange peel note sticking out the most, but all in all this is a nice nose! 8/10  Taste Vanilla pudding, charred oak, pepper, dried fruits, brown sugar, toasted wheat bread. The youth is rearing it's ugly head as the notes are pretty rough around the edges, but these flavors play well together. 40/50  Body Medium-thin and leaves behind lots of oil. I would like it to be more full to compliment the rich sweet flavors. 7/10  Finish The finish starts very hot, fireworks on the tongue almost! And then quickly fades to a subdued level where a raisin and vanilla pudding note hang around. 15/20  Value As I'm doing some searching it looks like the MSRP is about $32 which puts this guy right in line with Maker's in my area. I would reach for this bottle over the more ""name brand"" Maker's any day! However, the Weller line is still less expensive (when available...for now) which does knock this down a little bit. 8/10    Overall I was very excited to hear about a new wheater entering the market. Despite my rather lukewarm ratings, I would say this is a solid product worth the pick up! I would take this over Maker's most days, but I would still keep some Maker's around for those only looking for ""smooth"" in their drink as this can be a little rough around the edges. If you see it, snag one! Total: 78/100  Bourbon review 79  Network review 120"
bourbon,3dwe7g,Ethanized,2,Mon Jul 20 02:21:57 2015 UTC,"Solid review! I agree - for the value the Weller SR line is a better bet for a wheater, but this one is a nice change of pace."

bourbon,3dwe7g,deprived,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:40:25 2015 UTC,I had a small sample at a recent gathering.  In terms of wheaters I'd rank it above Weller SR and below W12.
