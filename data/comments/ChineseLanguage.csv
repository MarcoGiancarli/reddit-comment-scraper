Is 待 the verb for looking after the 倉庫?   本來 means originally or at first.  Not sure what you mean with the second question, but the sentence as a whole says something like ""Because of your pretty face, the manager selected you (who had originally been supposed to stay in the storeroom) to work with customers at the counter.""   1:52 那個票亭比這個圓圈還要小 What does the 還要 do, why is it necessary?   ""That ticket counter was even smaller than this circle."" The 還要 emphasizes that it's even smaller.   2:02 有玻璃罩著 What does the 著 do, why is it necessary?   著 (when used after a verb) is kind of like -ing.  She's saying the glass is covering it.    2:03 你要來買票啦 Who’s 你? What does the 要 do, why is it necessary. What does the 啦 do, why is it necessary?   ""If you wanted to come buy tickets . . "" 你 is a general ""you"" in this case.  The 要 is the wanted part. The 啦, as far as I know, is mostly just for emphasis, it's just a stylistic difference that's common in spoken Taiwanese Mandarin.   2:17 我就介紹我們要演什麼劇 Why 就？   The 就 is saying that she's about to do it, it's going to happen right now.   2:27 那就每天到了中午的時候 What’s the difference between 到了中午的時候 and 中午?   At noon (or maybe when it struck noon/when it reached noon) vs ""noon"".   2:27 你就看到一堆男人在那邊排 why 排 and not 排隊?   She could have said 排隊 there.     2:29 排妳 When you 排 a person, does that mean you’re waiting in line to see them, or does it mean something else?   Yeah, it's still meaning line up here.   2:34 就覺得說怎麼會一個票亭裡面 what does 就覺得說 mean?   In the context of the sentence it's something ""I mean, why else would they all be lining up at a ticket counter"".  But it's a filler, so it doesn't really have a fixed meaning."
ChineseLanguage,3e665w,eskeTrixa,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:51:55 2015 UTC,"First off, forgive me for using simplified. I'm just more familiar with the characters, and I can't be bothered to switch.  1) 本来  This modifier most closely translates to ""originally"" in English. For example:  我本来今天想跑步，结果一直没有时间。  Translates to: ""I originally wanted to run today, but I never had the time""  2)待  This is a verb that means to stay. In context, 待在仓库means to stay in a warehouse (implying that she was originally working within the warehouse).  When you string the entire sentence, not just the phrase you wrote, together you get:  ""Your beauty made an originally staying-in-a-warehouse you promoted to the counter, dealing with guests."" (It's a very rough translation).  3)还要  It's an adverb that means ""even."" In this context it means even smaller. Not particularly necessary, but adds meaning.  4)着  This is a bit tricky, because it goes into the intricacies of how people describe actions in Chinese. Chinese doesn't have conjugations like English; instead it has what is called aspect. In this case, 着 is best described as indicating that the action was happening continually. It's closest English analogue is the conjugation -ing, as in ""He is looking at you.""  5)你  In this context, it is a non-specific ""you,"" just like if you hear on the PA someone saying, ""if you are having trouble...etc."" It can mean anyone.  6)要  In this context, 要 means ""need to."" It's actually the verb in the sentence.  7)啦  This is a bit tricky to explain, but the best way I can describe it as is just a filler exclamation, kind of like the proverbial Canadian ""eh."" It just reflects the mood of the sentence.  8) 就  It means ""then"" in the majority of the cases (as in, I would then explain what it was about). It has other uses as well, but is mostly used in a transitional capacity  9)Difference between 中午的时候 and 中午  One means ""the time of noon"" and the other means ""noon."" Simply put, the first is just a more verbose version of the second, done for more dramatic storytelling effect.  10)排 vs. 排队  Both are grammatically, semantically, and colloquially correct. There is no intrinsic difference between the two. 排 just intrinsically means to line up. 排队 just means to line up a group of people (its just more specific).  As for 排你, this means lining up to see someone, in this context.  11) 就觉得说  就 in this case really doesn't have much intrinsic meaning. It's kind of like how many people use ""so"" in conversation (as in, so he did that, so he did this, etc.)  觉得说 I think can be best translated as ""feeling that.""  I may have committed some errors, so do let me know."

A motivational aid from me: You should consider to make recordings quit often. I'm saying this because it personally helps me when I feel like I'm not making progress at all.

ChineseLanguage,3e3kna,kschang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"Although I am no expert on language learning, I highly doubt the average person could reach a fluent level in any language in a year without intensive learning experience within the country of interest. Unfortunately for you, this seems to be impossible since you are working :/   However, I do think it is possible to learn the basic grammar structures and basic survival skills necessary if you keep up good work for that year. Now, there is no alphabet in Chinese, so learning characters will take a LONG time. I highly recommend stressing pronunciation from day 1. Tones are especially difficult (in the beginning), and there are some sounds that sound very similar (also in the beginning). However, once you master this, the rest of the way will be a lot smoother. Good luck!   P.S. The north and south have different accents. This isn't something you should worry about now, but something to keep in mind after a year or so."

Can you imagine if people in other countries were going nuts every time their politicians spoke English?   That's not a fair comparison because English is the unofficial international language so a non-white face speaking English isn't rare.   Good for Rudd, but seriously people, politicians should be able to speak 2 or 3 or even more languages. We live in a multicultural and therefore multilingual world.   Not ALL politicians SHOULD be multilingual, just those where their job deals with international matters. I could care less if my city's mayor speaks something other than English.  With that said, a smart politician from an English-speaking country would learn another language, but it's not necessary. But if you are a diplomat or high-level politician from a non-English speaking country, you probably would be out of a job if you didn't speak English.

Sample size is a problem since it was only a handful of Taiwanese but they all seemed to have that opinion.  They could also just be trying to be encouraging.

The prob seems to be the longest top bottom stroke of the 'second' door that is only a single one in Jap, in Chin two parallel vertical strokes seem to be drawn and only then is the second 'door' filled in, very strange...  edit: ...thanks for that article btw, I was already seriously worried that I had written all those charas 'wrong' these yrs, YET, a secret tip!, I have discovered that the Chinese stroke order for 馬 will turn out prettier results, at least in my case. ;) Also: for any writing beginner, those differences are not that big anyway, the general rules for stroke order seem to be quite the same."

Then they write it however they feel like. In real life almost no one writes anything by hand except for greetings cards and grocery lists. Use Skritter for a month before an exam and you'll basically never need to write things by hand in actual life. I just let students look up characters when writing by hand and half the time they just type it.  Why waste time memorizing stroke order when you could be focused on meaning and communication?"

ChineseLanguage,3dxbpa,tapkap,3,Tue Jul 21 02:16:13 2015 UTC,"I'm learning on my own and at college. Many universities use the Integrated Chinese books, which actually aren't too expensive, $40-50 each and can be found on Amazon, and cover a lot of material. There is a textbook and a workbook for each level. Personally I don't get much out of the workbook, but friends of mine do. I think the textbook is great. Following along in the books keeps you on a solid progression.   I also have the chineseskill app on my phone, which is free, and is a lot like duolingo if you know what that is. There is a lot of content on there and is fun and an easy way to learn.   If you're good at finding things online, I've heard the pimsleur audio files are easy to find without having to pay hundreds of dollars and are great for speaking and listening.   There is another book on Amazon I think is excellent and is pretty cheap and covers 800 most basic characters. It teaches stroke order and progresses in a way that characters build off previously learned characters. That book is about $20 and is worth it to me if you want to learn characters.   There is another characters book called chineasy, which looks great and the idea behind it is wonderful, but I got absolutely nothing out of. The book I previously mentioned is far superior.   I hope all that helps!"

They can also point out your flaws, so you know what you need to work on. I've used a few from italki  I'm pretty similar to you, in that I'm always changing how I learn.

Since you're already in China there should be plenty to learn (the beliefs, culture, customs etc). Just keep an open mind, explore more and communicate with different types of locals and see how well you connect. Its okay to hit a plateau after 2 years, but keep at it / absorb everything, soon your tipping point will come :)"

That way you can get exposed formally to vocab, grammar and writing in increasing complexity.   Of course, you wouldn't be limited to learning from the textbook but it will put some rough guide rails around your learning and provide you with a modicum of structure."
ChineseLanguage,3dxbpa,Viktor333,2,Tue Jul 21 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"I am in the same boat as you and my recommendation is to give yourself a goal.  Right now you are just (like I was) learning aimlessly with the ultimate goal of being fluent in Mandarin, and that goal is so long you need something else. So you can;  1) Pick a HSK exam and prepare for it Vocabulary and grammar lists are really easy to find for specific HSK levels, take a mock test to see where you are then work towards the next level.  2) I want to read a Chinese book. Pick a book, start reading it and translating the words you don't know/adding to a flashcard program. This is 1000x easier with e-books and online transcripts (copy and pasting into 百度翻译 is much faster than writing them out from your book).  3) Make your own goal"

As for sentences, I know Chinesepod is a great resource for sentences. Basic sentence structure is really easy in Chinese. Just enter complete sentences into an SRS program (like Anki or Repetitions) and read everything you can (convert your phone to Mandarin, your computer, box up your English language books, etc.). Pretty soon you'll be able to ""sense"" Chinese grammar, which is a pretty cool feeling.  Honestly, though, you need around 1500 characters to start to be able to understand stuff.

I try to do 15-20 a day then use Memrise all day everyday to keep track.  Luckily HSK5 will be done on the computer with Pinyin, as long as I recognise the characters I should pass it this September.  I consider learning a character knowing:  A) Recognising the Hanzi  B) Knowing the tones, Pinyin  C) How it can be applied in a sentence  I only ever write Chinese with my hand in note taking.

I tried it once a while ago but from what I understood all the courses are user created (and therefore of varying quality).

When I was in an intensive summer program I probably learned about 50 per week. It was doable, especially since I had Skritter and not a lot of other homework to focus on."
ChineseLanguage,3dvge3,J_HF,2,Sun Jul 19 22:16:22 2015 UTC,"When I learned the characters a few years ago I went through the two Heisig Remembering the Traditional Hanzi books. I did the first 1500 in 2-3 months, and the next 1500 in about the same amount of time. However, I took a 4 month break between the two books (because the 2nd one hadn't been released yet).   I was working at a farm at the time, reviewing on my SRS as I walked between places and learning while on my 30 minute lunch break. During that time I learned around 20-30 characters a day, but only the writing/English meaning, no Chinese pronunciation so as to speed up the process. I learned the pronunciation of characters through example sentences (after I learned the first 1500) and watching dubbed Pixar movies A LOT."
ChineseLanguage,3dvge3,olsonbro,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:29 2015 UTC,"I'm also in an intensive summer program but for fourth year chinese. We learn around 30 unique characters a day and around 120+ vocabulary words a day. Here is my personal advice:   I find that learning about the parts of each character helps me remember the meaning and makes it way easier to remember how to write them. Instead of thinking of 藝 as 19(?) individual strokes I think of it as 4 parts corresponding to the top, left, right, and bottom. In this way a 19 stroke character becomes a 4 ""stroke"" character. You will get more familiar with common ""chunks"". I think learning about the meaning of each individual character is really, really important. When you leave class and try to read the newspaper you will run across tons of vocab you have never seen before but you might recognize some of the individual characters. If you understand the meaning of individual characters you can infer some of the meaning. This also makes learning 成語 and different conjunctions or short phrases easier to memorize. For example, the grammar pattern 非...不可 means you can't not do whatever you are taking about. Why? Because 非 means not and 不可 means 不可以. You would be surprised how many people at this level learn the whole pattern but don't really understand what they are saying."
ChineseLanguage,3dvge3,J_HF,3,Mon Jul 20 03:07:44 2015 UTC,"120 words a day? That sounds insane. I mean, I could imagine looking at that many new words briefly in a day, but can you really understand them? Can you produce them in speech and writing? Can you remember them in the long term?  I'm genuinely interested in your specific study methodology for this program. Could you share some details?  As for me, I learn about 20-25 words a day using Skritter. Learning new characters is easy, it's retaining them in my memory which is more problematic. I spend a lot of time reviewing and re-learning words I had forgotten how to write."

ChineseLanguage,3dvge3,lin1380,2,Mon Jul 20 04:23:40 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: I wrote way more than I thought I would. My personal system took around 2 years and an intensive summer program in Beijing to come to fruition. It hinges around understanding individual characters and quick recall. My strategy is to focus on learning the meaning of individual characters, the meaning of larger words, and the pronunciation of said characters and words. I do this via the app Pleco. I purchased the flashcard add-on so I have an organized folder system (currently) containing 9195 flashcards 6584 of which I have ""learned"" according to Pleco. There are of course many other characters I haven't bothered to put in but I have learned. My routine is as follows:   Read my source material without looking up any characters. Guess what the main ideas are (write them down so you can compare later). Highlight any words that fit the following criteria: I am not 100% confident I can write the character in less than 3 seconds or I cannot provide an accurate definition within 5 seconds. Collect these words into a Pleco flashcard folder. Look at the pinyin and definition and write the characters. Make sure to pronounce the characters as you write them. While doing this step, identify and parts of the characters you recognize. For example, if you know 能 and 心 then 態 is simply the combination of those two. Give the ""chunk"" an interesting name in your mind to remember it (bonus points if it's the actual meaning). For example, 心 is heart and 石 is stone. Also pay attention to the stroke order. It really helps me remember how to write each character. Now split the deck into sets of 5-10 and write the characters based on the pinyin and definition. Keep doing this until you make two flawless passes. Then do them all together. Now that you know how to write all of them look up each individual character you do not know. See what words have that character as a part. See what the character means on its own. This may not seem important initially but as you progress this will become invaluable. Now that you know what each individual character means, do a dry run of the meaning of all your vocab that day. Try can guess the overall meaning. I mean actually try to guess, not some half-assed try. Sometimes you will be pretty wrong. Other times you will be spot on. If you are spot on you will never forget that character again. Lastly, learn the definitions. Personally, I split my vocab into groups of 5 or 10 (5 when I was in first or second year) and drill each group until I can get all of them exactly right twice through. Then I combine them all and go for all exactly right twice through.   This probably seems like a lot. It usually takes me 1 hour total to do this. But I DO NOT do this in one sitting. Instead I spend 10-20 minutes here and there continuing the process. That way I have to keep retrieving what I was just working to memorize. This constant retrieval has benefited me greatly.  Strong points of this system: I can write 90%+ of the characters I have learned. I recognize a lot of standalone characters and can infer the meaning of words I haven't learned with reasonable accuracy. Grammar patterns make sense as a whole because each character in the pattern makes sense. You are always reviewing because if you don't remember the definition or how to write the character you throw it in with the rest of the vocab.   Weak points of this system: It's cumbersome if you don't want to learn how to write characters. The rate of review is based on the vocab within the source text.  What I have below is a continuation of my ideas. Feel free to stop here if I answered your question.  The rest of my answer:  Bear with me if this gets a bit dense. Here it goes:  I think we should first begin by defining ""learned"" in the context of my post. I've always felt the question ""How many characters have you learned"" a bit confusing because there are so many ways to define ""learned"". For the context of this post, I will say I ""learned"" a character or word if upon recognition:   I know how to pronounce it and can successfully do so. I know the English meaning within a few seconds.   Note I am specifically leaving out the ability to write or think of the character when I'm speaking. I can write 90% of the characters I have learned in either 简体字 or 繁體字 but that is because I love writing characters :D. I can't really quantify how many characters I use in daily conversation much in the same way I can't quantify how many English words I use in daily conversation. But that doesn't mean I haven't learned the characters. People always can recognize and understand far more words than they can use themselves.  My personal system took around 2 years and an intensive summer program in Beijing to come to fruition. It hinges around understanding individual characters and quick recall.  I split my vocab into three parts:   Proper nouns, people, places, historical events etc. 書面語 (characters and grammar patterns more often found in writing as opposed to speaking) Everything else   For each group I have a different routine:   Proper nouns: You will find that many words related to the Western world are ""loan words"" that sound a lot like the English counterpart. Also, these words are composed of a finite set of characters (examples include 羅，克，拉，亞，尼). Due to the context, the only important thing about these characters is the pronunciation. Why? The actual characters don't carry a particularly useful meaning. Plus, since the idea is to sound like the English counterpart, if you know how to pronounce each individual character you will be guess the meaning. It's really quite magical! These I don't focus on recalling during conversation. Since they are mostly never spoken I simply do my system and leave it at that. Everything else goes by the system in my tl;dr.   Good lord I wrote a lot. Hopefully you found it helpful. If you have any questions or suggestions for me I would love to answer/hear them!"
ChineseLanguage,3dvge3,ShanghaiFever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:11:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your long and detailed reply.   It’s interesting to read your method and it sounds like it has really worked for you. Fantastic!  There are some similarities in our methods. Both rely heavily on using software to organise study, which I believe is a good idea. I use Skritter though. (I use Pleco as a dictionary, but I don’t use the flashcard system. Previously I dabbled in Memrise, but didn’t really like that lists weren’t easily customisable.)  Right now I’m at a crossroads with my learning, since I will have studied all 5000 or so words in HSK1 to HSK6 by Monday next week. I’ve been thinking a lot about where to go from here.  I have been using Skritter as my method of learning characters, in terms of reading, writing and tones, for a number of reasons.  Firstly, it’s an extremely efficient way of adding new vocabulary and reviewing systematically. I spend about an hour and a half using Skritter every day, usually listening to Chinese radio at the same time. I’ve tried not to get too stressed about “needing” to remember. If I can’t remember how to write a word within a few seconds, for instance, I will check it and go to the next one. I mostly add words manually, usually between 10 and 25 a day. Sometimes I’ll stop reviewing for a few weeks, which will mean perhaps an even longer period of reviews before I can add new words. After a particularly long absence from study, I might even delete the review data of a list and start from scratch to keep my “items needing review” number at a manageable level. But all in all, I’ve been pretty consistent and it has worked.  Secondly, the HSK lists (as well as a range of textbooks) can be easily added into my Skritter account. I can block words I deem not useful (e.g. proper nouns and 成语). I can search lists easily. Within the Skritter app, I can breakdown a character into its smaller components. If I come across a word I want to look up in more details, it can bring up the Pleco entry with one click.  Thirdly, I use Skritter on my iPad. It looks and feels great. It can be a great conversation starter with Chinese people in a public place as well.  One mistake I’ve made has been that I’d studied characters in Skritter out of context. As such, my passive skills are much stronger than my active skills. Your method, using words found in texts, sounds like a much better strategy. On the other hand, my rationale has been that I wanted to learn by rote the HSK word lists as quickly as possible. As such, most words, particularly HSK5 and HSK6 words, I can use passively but not actively.  When studying textbooks or authentic Chinese materials, I’ve found this passive skills knowledge has really helped. I remember my early days of learning, when my constant forgetting how to read and write characters hindered me from digesting other information on the page. The fact I’ve learned a word passively means I can more effectively pick up its usage when I finally come across it in context.   I’ve also avoided learning practically all proper nouns, except for very commonly used names of countries, for example. Basically, I haven’t wanted to waste time writing out proper nouns repeatedly when others words could take precedent. The same goes for 成语, except insofar as a 成语 has already passed into my active knowledge and reviewing it barely requires effort. (In other words, I won’t “learn” 成语 with Skritter, just review 成语 I’ve already internalised.)  One major difference between our approaches is that you seem to focus on the meaning of individual characters and even radicals in helping you remember. I haven’t studied individual characters much (except when they also have a standalone meaning, perhaps in other contexts). Similarly, radicals. However, I have developed an innate “feeling” for individual characters based on their uses in other words. In my mind, I usually have a “default word” for a character, from which I can understand other words which also share that character.  My approach has been based on several reasons. Firstly, I want to take the HSK 6 exam, so having at least passive skills knowledge of HSK words has been prioritised. Secondly, I live in China and already have no problem communicating most of the time. I am conscious that my vocab and use of sentence patterns is limited, however. Thirdly, I work a lot, and although using Skritter as the main means of vocab acquisition has obvious drawbacks, my daily hour and a half on Skritter is strong habit I have developed, and I’ve been of the opinion that it’s better to study with, say, 75% efficiency every day without having to put much effort in, than study with 100% efficiency but get stressed out about it and keep missing days. In other words, it is a regimen that has worked for me personally in the long term.  My task now is to continue learning in various ways:  (1) Develop my passive skills knowledge into active skills knowledge  (2) Continue to expand my passive skills knowledge  (3) Transfer my focus on new words away from writing to reading/speaking. (I don’t need to write much in daily life.)  Here’s what I’m going to focus on to develop my skills in this area. Any suggestions are welcome.  (1) As I will have stopped adding HSK list words, my time spent reviewing characters should gradually decrease. I’ll still set aside an hour and a half “vocabularly study time” daily, but as Skritter begins to occupy a smaller part of this time, I’ll spend the remaining time reading authentic texts.  (2) When reading authentic texts, I’ll do two things:  (a) I’ll highlight words I don’t recognise (i.e. completely new vocabulary). After I’ve finished reading, I’ll write out all those characters on paper and try to guess the meaning (using context and character associations.) After that, I’ll search the meaning using a dictionary. I’ll choose what I believe to be the 5 most useful words that I imagine I will want to use actively in speech and writing. The other words, I will disregard. I’ll add to 5 new words to a custom Skritter list and then review them.  (b) I’ll also highlight words I recognise, but perhaps don’t feel 100% confident about. Perhaps I’ll be unsure of the tones, or will know the approximately Chinese meaning but don’t feel confident about explaining that meaning in English. I’ll write out these words and look them up too.  As for developing other areas, particularly active skills such as speaking and writing (including grammar acquisition and sentence patterns), I’ll continue to use higher level textbooks and occasional sessions with a private tutor. Of course all this will be in addition to watching TV shows, reading for leisure (e.g. no word lookups unless absolutely necessary) and talking to Chinese people on a daily basis here in China.  Sound good?  (Edited for formatting and typos.)"

ChineseLanguage,3dx1g6,forgottendinosaur,2,Tue Jul 21 14:01:30 2015 UTC,"A radical is one of 214 base components that make up all Chinese characters. Each has its own meaning and sound, and knowing those can help you learn characters (which about 80% are one semantic radical and some number of phonetic radicals). I've never heard of roots or sub-roots before, so I suspect it's either really rare or specific to this program, but it seems like sub-roots are individual strokes and roots are basically radicals?  AFAIK the only way to figure out how many words a group of characters has is experience - like if I was typing in syllables; you-could-pro-bab-ly-un-der-stand-this-sen-tence-e-ven-though-there-are-no-spa-ces. Just like you would see un-der-stand as one word, when you're familiar with Chinese you see 开始 (start, begin) as one word.   英文 means exactly what you think, English language. So if you hit that, you're going to be typing in English (not Chinese).   全形字符 means a fully formed character. I can't figure out what that does for this input system, though. I would suggest you use a pinyin input system rather than this one at least until you learn more Chinese; it's much more straightforward and helps you associate the pinyin with the character. Even the people I've seen type in China have used pinyin input."

There will be multiple characters that are different words with the same pronounciation and therefore identical pinyin.   Yes.   I don't know of any that have split this way.

It's worth noting that while many Chinese words are polysyllabic, very few Chinese morphemes are more than one syllable/one character long (mostly native names of certain plants and animals like 蝴蝶 and 珊瑚, see wiki). The vast majority of characters correspond to monosyllabic morphemes, which then combine into disyllabic words.   We also have the case of polysyllabic characters, which mostly exist as informal contractions of certain phrases or polysyllabic words, see LanguageLog. Again, the vast majority of characters you encounter will be monosyllabic."

Bopomofo seems easier for me.  /ʂ/ = sh = ㄕ  Notice that 1 Bopomofo character equals 1 sound, but 2 Pinyin characters equal 1 sound.  My Esperanto books which are for learning Chinese use Pinyin. Even Chinese-Esperanto dictionaries have the order according to Pinyin instead of Chinese characters.  I doubt that a Chinese book about the Chinese grammar or the Chinese orthography has Ruby characters everywhere where there are Chinese characters, so I must learn Chinese characters.   did you just start learning chinese?

A2: In general, yes  A3: Yes, a character can be pronounced more than one way, and thus would have different pinyin  A4: Yes, that's why when you enter something there's a lookup table that is displayed.   A5 / A6: Generally, simplified and traditional characters are one-to-one.   A7: The doubled version has more emphasis. Furthermore, you can't say ""xie"" by itself. You usually say 謝了 (Thanks ) or 多謝 (Thanks a lot ) xiexie 謝謝 is more of an expression, than just a verb.   A8:"

Great app, exactly what I want, nice design and ui. I often want to read articles, but don't want to spend half my time flicking to the dictionary, and you've found a great solution. You've also done a very neat trick which is to slightly separate out words from each other, something really useful for beginners.   I really really really want to 'import' my own articles. The article set is too limited, and too short. I did this before myself for a private webapp I ised, please PM me if you want to know details!  Some kind of basic testing for the word list is essential. Even just being able to toggle pinyin and English/Chinese so I can test myself, although a full on SRS system will be an absolute killer feature.   User added words/vocab?  Save articles so I can keep a personal list.   Suggested articles based on my reading level?

Since it linked me to Manhuaren, I ended installing the application anyway...  Well it's awesome! I would say it's almost as good as Zhuizhui, the only feature I am missing so far is a night mode (I can set the light to minimum on the system and in the app but it's still too bright to read at night).

I think all the Listening book series for Chinese suck, but it is better than nothing.  I recommend using FluentU website to learn listening.  The book series like Developing Chinese, Boya and Integrated start from the beginning with ni hao, so you don't have to worry about starting from scratch.  Skritter, an amazing app, has the word lists from the book, so you can use the app to memorize the defenitions, tones, and writing the characters.

I would see the flash card, and hear it spoken 3 times, and move on.  Going through the new chapter vocab a few times would get the sounds in my head pretty well, and I'd have a good idea of the characters when I started playing the writer.  I'd play the writer whenever I was idle somewhere and needed to kill a minute.  Sigh...I'm probably just going to get trainchinese back.

ChineseLanguage,3dcp9v,Dr-Aunt-Jessica,3,Wed Jul 15 06:56:45 2015 UTC,"Correct, 华 means ""China"". Many Chinese organizations use 中华 to mean ""Chinese"", including in the official name of the People's Republic of China, 中华人民共和国.  On the difference between 话 and 语, it's complex, but 语 tends to be used for larger groups and 话 for subgroups within them. Both emphasize spoken rather than written speech. But you need to understand that Chinese uses word, not characters, to convey meaning. The English letter ""a"" is usually a grammatical term, but it in ""Gary"" and it does not have any special grammatical meaning. So all the Chinese characters that we have discussed are usually used as part of words, which determines the meaning.  EDIT: Thanks to u/ayylmaoXX89 for spotting a typo."
ChineseLanguage,3dcp9v,SeekTruthFromFacts,2,Wed Jul 15 07:10:35 2015 UTC,"I hear this a lot, but in most words, don't characters work more like roots than letters? I.e. the roots of ""encyclopedia"" are ""en"", ""cyclos"", and ""paedia"". If you look up the ancient Greek versions of these roots, you find that ""en"" means ""in"", ""cyclos"" means ""circle"", and ""paedia"" means ""education"" or ""child-rearing"". In turn, ""encyclos"" means ""general"", so ""encyclopedia"" contains roots that mean ""general education."" Now, that's not exactly what ""encyclopedia"" means in modern English, but it sheds some light on things. Similarly, don't 话 in 普通话 and 语 in 华语 carry more meaning than the ""a"" in ""Gary""?"
ChineseLanguage,3dcp9v,imd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:20:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, they do, but I deliberately went to the other extreme because so many people have been mistaught that characters = words.

Remember, PRC's full name is 中华人民共和国 though they kinda borrowed the original name, 中华民国 which was the Republic of China established after Sun Yat Seng overthrew the Qing Dynasty.  Any way, hua-ren 华人 just means Chinese (the race), so 华语 is Chinese language. Hua is more about the ""culture"" is probably the best way to think about it, but it's very context specific.   (FWIW, in Taiwan, it's called 國語 national language)  As for difference between hua 话 and yu 语, hua is more about spoken speech (note that there's the character ""tongue"" 舌 as a part of the character), while yu is more about written language, but the two are often used interchangeably."
ChineseLanguage,3dcp9v,kschang,0,Sun Jul 19 19:48:24 2015 UTC,"I can explain why both terms are used to refer to standard mandarin.  China during its republic years used to use 国语 (national language) to refer to standard mandarin (which taiwan still does). However, to elevate mandarin to official status would be viewed as a slight to the other native languages the other 55 ethnic groups speak. Thus, in an attempt to remain neutral, 普通话 (common speech) was used to refer to standard mandarin.  On the other hand, 华语 (language of the chinese) is used to refer to standard mandarin in South East Asia. This decision was relatively simple. There wasnt any political desire or need to incorporate other groups ( Malays, Arabs, Indians etc) under the umbrella of the chinese people, thus 华语 is used to differentiate between the Bahasa / Melayu / Tagalog / Hindi / Tamil / Urdu that other local populations speak."

ChineseLanguage,3da46n,A-Magyar,6,Tue Jul 14 18:06:27 2015 UTC,"It is not drawing. It is writing the characters. It's as simple as that. If you want to avoid learning to write them at all costs, you sure can. Nowadays using intelligent input we can basically say that writing = speaking + reading. However, memorising the shape of the characters without ever writing might work for the first 100 characters but in general the characters stick better in your brains if you write them out (using the correct stroke order anyways). You don't even have to write them using a pen. Tracing the strokes with your finger is usually enough. But writing by hand from time to time is a good exercise to remember the characters better.  TL;DR: I would advise you to learn to write in any case."

ChineseLanguage,3da46n,coldminnesotan,3,Wed Jul 15 01:33:20 2015 UTC,"I am a relative beginner, but I will tell you this. It is very helpful to learn the correct stroke order of characters. Even if you never write them many keyboards are very dependent on knowing the stroke order (although your argument that using a pinyin entry method is an option is valid, sometimes it is not easy/available. or sometimes I need to type a character I don't know the pinyin of, such as into a dictionary). I use an electronic keyboard a lot, and the most common type I use is the 繁體筆畫 keyboard on my iphone. I rarely write characters, but I find this input method both fast and a great tool for learning/remembering stroke order.  The other thing is learning stroke order is not an extremely rote, painful task. the finite number of elements of characters that are used to build the 2000-3000 commonly used characters are fairly easy to pick up, rules of how characters are usually written, all add up to it being a task that accelerates pretty quickly.  Just my $0.02"
ChineseLanguage,3da46n,KillYourCar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:25:57 2015 UTC,"For the longest time I thought that learning to write would be exhausting, time consuming, and boring. I was able to skate by in my classes at school because the teacher wasn't one to challenge us. Now that I'm moving on to a four year university, I'm almost positive that I'll be expected to hand write, so I started using skritter and it is amazing.  Stroke order does not take long to be intuitive, and it absolutely helps you remember the characters. Plus, the more characters you learn, the easier it will be to learn new ones once when you start recognizing radicals. Often, a character is formed from multiple radicals, and since you will know how to write many of them already, they just need to be assembled next to one another in several variations. Writing is totally worth learning in my opinion."
ChineseLanguage,3da46n,gingerbreaddave,0,Wed Jul 15 21:27:26 2015 UTC,Not true. Chinese keyboards are just as capable of using pinyin as they are stroke order.
ChineseLanguage,3da46n,SilverNightingale,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:24:39 2015 UTC,I never said they weren't. Some input methods use stroke some use pinyin. My point was that sometimes it is useful/necessary to input a character based on strokes.

ChineseLanguage,3da46n,SilverNightingale,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:04 2015 UTC,Not that I am aware of. But it could certainly come up that you encounter a character you aren't familiar with that you want to type or look up. In this case if you do not know the pinyin entering it by stroke is a viable option.

The Internet and access_network_state permissions are for Google Analytics (so I know which countries my users are coming from and what Android version/phone model they are using) as well as the banner ad for the free version.    The billing permission is for the optional upgrade to the full version.  The SD Card read/write is for the apps database which stores all of the phrases/categories/favorites on the device. Every time a favorite is added, it open the database and writes to it (which requires that Android permission).  I wish Google made the permissions a little bit more transparent so users actually knew what their phone was doing, but that's all my app uses."

I would think a slightly lower price would mean a greater volume of upgrades, but thats just my ideas. I am not a business man or developer and I mean no disrespect.

But if you are ordering dish that is on a menu that has no choice of spicy level then you say  我想要加辣 (I want to add spicy) or ask if they can make it 很辣. so basically 大辣 is more like a noun and 很辣 is an adjective. depending how you are using it in a sentence.

ChineseLanguage,3d74a5,ChinaFunn,3,Tue Jul 14 01:13:10 2015 UTC,"我爸爸就在这屋子里去世: My father died in this very room.  In this sentence, the 就 functions as the ""very"" you are looking to express.  一年之后我又碰上了同一个男子:  A year later I met the very same man.  Here, the very is expressed sufficiently by the “同一个"".  不仅是实行不实行的问题，而且是这个主意还有理论的问题。 It's not just putting it into practice, the very idea is wrong in theory.  Sort of a clunky translation, but it should suffice to show that ""不仅"" expresses the desired ""not just""  As a general rule of thumb, ""very"" in its positive form is usually expressed by words such as 就 or 正, whereas in it's negative form, very is expressed by ""不仅,"" ""不只,"" or ""不光"" (depending on formality).   Lastly, overlapping meanings in some languages don't carry into others, for example the overlap of ""identical"" and ""very"" in English. Your second sentence demonstrates this: In Chinese, ""同"" is the go to character for expressing the ""the exact same"" (i.e. identical) meaning which you are looking to express."

ChineseLanguage,3cuktg,Yalen,5,Fri Jul 10 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"Research shows (and if people are really interested, I can find it) that for English speakers, 4th tone is the hardest.  Two things to consider with tones: onset and contour. Onset is the starting pitch and contour is the shape of the tone i.e. where it goes after the onset.  Remember with 4th (falling tone) to start high, go low and go relatively quickly. Some people don't start high enough (onset) and some people don't go down far enough (contour).  Also remember that the depiction of 3rd tone is wrong (2-1-4). It's more accurately shaped like a tub 2-1-1-(3). Most 3rd tones don't go up at all (so-called ""half 3rd tone""), except if the third tone is the last syllable in a phrase.  Also remember, over longer phrases, rhythm is more important. As in English, Chinese speakers stress the important syllables. The stressed syllables get full tonal value, but the unstressed syllables tend towards neutral. Work on your rhythm, stressing the most important syllables and you'll automatically sound ""more Chinese"" than if you try to sound out every tone for every syllable. After you've got the rhythm right, you can focus on tone to hone your sound. Try it. It's a great trick."

ChineseLanguage,3cv6xb,muciflex,8,Sat Jul 11 01:17:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, take a class. Many people need one-on-one practice to even hear all the tones, never mind pronounce them.  Basic rundown: there's four tones and one neutral. Neutral tone is pronounced very briefly, on unaccented syllables or grammatical particles.   1st tone, shown in pinyin by a ¯ mark over the vowel: high level tone, often held for a bit longer. In English: the sound you make when someone says ""who wants ice cream?"" and you say ""Meeee!"" 2nd tone, shown in pinyin with a ´ mark, rising tone. This is the easiest one, I think. In English it sounds exactly like a question. ""huh?"" 3rd tone, shown in pinyin by a ˇ mark, low tone or falling-rising tone, like 1st tone often held for a little longer. In English: sounds kind of angry, like the growly half-question in ""He did what. I'mma kick his ass."" 4th tone, shown in pinyin by a ` mark, falling tone. In English: sounds like disappointment. ""Aw, rats."""
ChineseLanguage,3cv6xb,bunnicula9000,2,Sat Jul 11 05:59:34 2015 UTC,"I think this explains it pretty well, the neutral tones are often in characters with a 口 字旁 e.g. 啊,吗,啦 and these are pronounced very short.  Try doing exercises with just the 'a' vowel like ā  á  ǎ  à.  I do find that most people struggle with the third tone, but its just a falling and rising tone and longer than the others. Try it out with different consonants and vowels to get a feel but ü is probably one of the more difficult ones to do."

ChineseLanguage,3cs7eo,FillyVinyl,5,Fri Jul 10 10:10:42 2015 UTC,"I started learning Chinese with Pimsleur, and it gives you a good sense of the basic sounds and how sentences are put together. Doesn't give much vocabulary, but you can add that later.   The frustrating part with it is that it's all audio, so you are constantly wondering how to represent these sounds you are hearing on paper (or maybe it's just me). It would help to look into pinyin for this. I think there are some videos on YouTube.   Eventually I realized that if I wanted to learn Chinese I needed to move to China, so I did!"
ChineseLanguage,3cs7eo,mjklin,2,Fri Jul 10 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"Agree. I've gone all the way through Pimsleur lvl 4 and found it useful. As to the audio only part of things I found this word list for all the vocabulary in lvls 1-3. It is simplified characters, and I'm focusing on traditional characters. I've started to go through the file and make a traditional version of it. If I get that finished I'll try to post it at some point. I find it very helpful from a character/vocabulary perspective to go through the written vocabulary as I'm reviewing Pimsleur lessons. The visual imagery in my brain of the written characters as I'm listening to the audio is a great memory tool in my opinion."

It's great for providing a foundation and the progressive aspect really worked for me.  Like one of the previous posters said, it's audio only so you miss out on learning characters. I found I learn better when I can see what is being spoken.  You can also try out CLO. Uses a similar approach to Pimsleur but with transcripts and exercises."

The important thing is that the character itself is a ""da"" sound. If you go to this website, next to the 大 character are two >> arrows. Click them and then click the megaphone.

ChineseLanguage,3cri20,transparentink,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:51:54 2015 UTC,"The Forvo link sounds more like bà than dà to my ears too.

I went to Taiwan to study for a while and never saw anyone else besides me with a kindle.  I found a few Taiwanese reviews online saying not to buy kindles because there weren't any Chinese books available to read on them.  Taiwanese people do read ebooks, but they're more likely to read EPUB versions on their smartphones or computer.  If that'll work for you, check out sites like airitiBooks or Pubu, but keep in mind these sites are more likely to have original Chinese material, and what translated books they have won't be brand new.  For the type of translated books you want, you may need to buy actual books.  Eslite is the big Taiwanese bookstore.  I've never tried ordering off their site, but the stores had a great selection.   Good luck!"

The Mandarin Training Center he studied at, at National Taiwan Normal University, is government run; which means the Mandarin it teaches is not Taiwanese style, but Guoyu, a standard of the ROC government, which sounds far closer to Beijing/Putonghua speech (you can still hear this on, for example, Taiwanese news programs). Teachers there intentionally speak and teach students to speak to this standard, even today (although many teachers now will point out what is ""standard"" and what Taiwanese people actually speak). Additionally, at the time he arrived, especially in Taipei, the amount of people from the mainland with their home accents would've been relatively higher."

When you are a foreigner speaking Chinese for a purpose (business/politics/etc) you need to make a trade off between: What can I say (ability), what must I say (purpose/goal), what should I say (culture).    I have been in this situation many times - and I'd love to say something really culturally relevant and aligning to my goal, but I simply don't have any special vocabulary to do it, so I sound a bit rude or uncultured."

ChineseLanguage,3cmh86,ChinaFunn,3,Thu Jul 9 01:33:39 2015 UTC,"学 and 学习 are fairy interchangeable in meaning. As for when you should say one or the other?  学 is usually used to talk about broad learning. Often times a resultative compliment will be tacked on to the end, as in the following examples  这些生词你学过吗？Have you learned these vocab words?  你今天学到什么东西了? What things did you learn about today?  学习 on the other hand often refers to the act of ""studying"" or ""practicing."" Since it is a two syllable word, it often follows or comes after other two syllable words to provide a sentence rhythm which a single syllable word would otherwise break. Here are some examples:  他还是在学习阶段; He's still in the learning stage  培养良好的学习习惯; develop excellent study habits"
ChineseLanguage,3cmh86,TheHenanist,3,Thu Jul 9 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"忘 and 忘记 is a slightly different matter, since 忘 seldom appears by itself in modern Chinese. However, what you will see is 忘了 vs 忘记. AFAIK they are fairly interchangeable, with the only differences between the two being 1) 忘记 is a bit more formal， 2）忘记 is used for rhythmic purposes more than 忘了   Some examples can be found below  我忘了带书包 I forgot to bring my bag  你别忘了吃个早饭 Don't forget to eat a breakfast  他忘记了自己的名字 He forgot his own name  Maybe to Chinese speakers the difference between the two is comparable to the difference between ""let it slip,"" or ""spaced,"" which might correspond to 忘了, and ""forgot,"" which might correspond to 忘记"
ChineseLanguage,3cmh86,TheHenanist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:30:07 2015 UTC,I agree that for most purposes it's 忘了 or 忘记 but I don't know whether it's true that 忘 is never used alone. How about 王力宏's song 忘我? Beyond the title it also says 让自己忘我 in the lyrics. Would this sound weird in daily speech? Would it sound better with 记 and that is just a special musical case?  Edit: clarification
ChineseLanguage,3cmh86,selery,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:16:57 2015 UTC,"I think it works in the song title because:  a) The title is a two character expression, so adding the single character 忘 instead of 忘记 etc. makes the title a bit more symmetric and elegant  b) Song titles, in addition to other things such as news headlines, book titles, etc tend to have a bit of a literary flare, which is often expressed in single characters, such as 忘, which can sufficiently represent the meaning of the two character words in which they usually are found.  As for the 让自己忘我 line, it makes sense, but its not something you would hear in everyday speech. My guess is 忘 as a single character fit the rhythm scheme WLH had in mind for the song.  EDIT: just listened to the song - the lyrics are all fairly formal, so in this context it might be a bit more acceptable to use 忘 as a standalone character.  Nice find on the song though, I should edit my above comment to say that it's usually not used instead of never used :)"
ChineseLanguage,3cmh86,TheHenanist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:41:19 2015 UTC,"學 is a verb, 學習 can be a verb as well as adverb, gerund or infinitive or in conjunction with these. Same with 忘 and 忘記.

ChineseLanguage,3chtix,MeinAusfahrt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:43:54 2015 UTC,"It's certainly good, but it's kind of a waste of money on the trip.  Get a language exchange partner and use skype or something, set up regular topics forcing you to learn different common topics.  When you're comfortable talking about basic daily life things, places, people, describing objects, directions and locations, shapes, sizes, clothing, basic stores, and you can talk a bit about grammar in order for someone to help you learn a new concept in chinese, that is the time to be ""immersed"".  If you go with A1/A2 vocabulary, you're going to find that you understand nobody, people are frustrated to talk to you, and the ones that do just try to ""HALUO"" you into teaching their child English."
ChineseLanguage,3chtix,baozichi,2,Thu Jul 9 11:44:07 2015 UTC,IMO you will never be comfortable talking about daily life until you are immersed in the language itself.  Language exchanges are not a substitute for the reality of even a simple 2-hour immersion class in Taiwan.
ChineseLanguage,3chtix,SilverNightingale,3,Fri Jul 10 16:53:55 2015 UTC,I actually am in Taiwan right now doing a 2-month immersive training course at the Mandarin Training Center at 師大. Totally totally recommend it; it has been fantastic so far. Feel free to ask me any questions you have about it!  As far as a 2 week trip? I'm not sure if it'll be that effective; it almost seems like it'd be a waste of money (but it's always awesome visiting Taiwan!!). I recommend at least a month or more stay.

I also agree that you're gonna need more than 2 weeks to have a super effective stay in terms of amount of Chinese learned.

ChineseLanguage,3chtix,hebeard,2,Wed Jul 8 15:31:57 2015 UTC,"I studied several months at 師大 back in 2004 in their intensive classes at the Mandarin Training Center. I highly recommend it. At the time I had studied for one summer in an intensive program in the US, and this was sufficient for me to make good use of my time in Taiwan. I wouldn't call it a full-blown immersion program though. It's much less rigorous than the summer program at Middlebury College (I did the Arabic program, I assume Chinese is similar). In Taiwan, it's easy to spend too much time with expats and not practice Chinese much out of class, so you really need to make an effort to meet friends and find language exchanges and get out on the streets and talk to people (pretending you're lost is a great way to talk to lots of people and get really good at asking directions and related vocabulary). I also recommend a longer stay. 2 months minimum if you really want to make progress with the language."

I've suffered through so many Chinese shows, and the only one I've liked is 潜伏。It's actually one of my favorite shows of all time. The story and acting are absolutely brilliant. It's a spy drama taking place during the Chinese Civil War, with the main character acting as a double agent.  The production quality is admittedly low budget, but I think this is partially on purpose because the result is that the show has an old fashioned feel to it, really makes it seem like an authentic socialist-drama.

You might recognize some of their films such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Farewell My Concubine because they have won at major film festivals, even the Oscars. If you are into anything done well media-wise , these directors are for you. The movies they make are usually quite depressing because they take place during national hardships (think 228 or the Cultural Revolution), but they are also masterpieces that pushed some extraordinarily difficult boundaries and paved the way to address sensitive topics. Definitely check them out at some point. My personal favorites are Farewell My Concubine 霸王別姬 (Chen Kaige), Raise the Red Lantern 大紅燈籠高高掛 (Zhang Yimo), Home Coming 歸來 (Zhang Yimo), and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 據虎藏龍 (Li An)."

ChineseLanguage,3cfeh5,darcmosch,6,Tue Jul 7 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"So the reasons why China has crappy film industry:    You gotta know people, and those people have expensive tastes. To get your film to be released in China takes a metric ton of red tape. You can bypass it, but it gets expensive. Cuts into your bottom line.  Money. Damn do people here like money and everyone wants their share, and they don't want it to be small. So what sells? Formulaic romcoms and Anti-Japanese War stuff.  Creativity and individuality are buzzwords thrown around to no effect. Do you know how many times I've read these words in official reports? At least 300 in the last month according to my search function. They want innovative stuff, but the only products I have translated are tweaks to ideas that have already made money.* Numbers. Chinese people love numbers. They have since Confucian times used numbers and titles to judge someone's worth, but a piece of art cannot be boiled down to ROI or ticket sales, which means there is a big chance it can fail, and they'd rather get monetary worth than cultural worth out of a production.  Product placement is a good way to make your production profitable no matter the movie , just ask Adam Sandler. Those new interests want to appeal to as many people as possible. How do they do that? Nothing edgy or extreme now we don't want to alienate customers.    I will say that there are talented men and women in this field, but you have to look for them and they could be hiding right in front of your eyes.   About 2 years ago I watched a movie with Little Bingbing called I  Do which was a completely sappy romcom that was sponsored by a jewelry store and Red Bull. There was one part where the mail lead explained that the reason he was divorced, his wife left him was because his original company failed when they were about to have a kid. She aborted her because she didn't think they could afford her. I tearbent hard that night. Very anti-business/monopolistic sentiment for a movie that had to both spend and guarantee quite a bit to get made. Also very pro-life for a country dominated by the One Child Policy   In a movie full of product placement, sappy romance and basically everything I hate about the movie industry which China exemplifies, a ray of light shone through that night. There is talent and creativity no matter how hard you try and stamp it out, you just gotta really look for it."
ChineseLanguage,3cfeh5,samsonkeane,4,Tue Jul 7 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"Is there a good reason why chinese media is so underdeveloped?   I've thought a lot about this because it really bothers me how China's film and TV industry is so awful compared to its neighbors, so here is a summary of my thoughts on it:  Partially its censorship. The time periods Chinese people can talk about basically are all either before the 18th century, during WWII, or after the 1980's. Its a really bad idea to talk about Maoist China unless you're able to twist it to make it appear much better than it actually was (like in Wolf Totem, but even in that movie they cut out the parts in the book where the destruction of nature was being used as a symbol of the incompetence and damage of the Communist regime, and turned it into a simplistic environmentalist theme)  It seems like WWII shows are constantly being produced (and made fun of) because they are blatant and absurd propaganda meant to perpetuate the national hatred of the Japanese.  You can't make anything with any kind of philosophy that could be interpreted as opposing the regime. Also the Chinese government has a desire for the ""soft power"" that American and Japanese culture has on the world, but like a banker at a nightclub they only know how to throw money at it, funding music concerts and films that are exactly as bad as you would expect ""government issue media"" to be.  I do think that, like it or not, American influence really changes a country's pop culture. Japan and Korea both make all kinds of fabulous and fascinating films, and both of these countries have had... lets say... a long history with America. Their pop culture is a mixture of their own historical cultures mixed with the glamour and dramatization that comes out of American film and TV. I also think the widespread depression in Japan churns out more creative artists which is partly why they have such a huge global cultural influence.  What probably also factors into it is part of the larger issue China faces with its education system: lack of creativity. Chinese students are extremely skilled at memorizing and regurgitating but they just don't develop a lot of creativity. Music is all about learning to play other people's music. Art is all about making your art look as close as possible to the art of the greats. It creates this culture of imitation that makes it extremely hard for China to develop its own unique pop culture, so instead their pop culture is just constantly retelling the same stories over and over (lots of Chinese dramas get remade. Exact same storyline, just new actors) and this either means talking about ""clean"" topics like pre-colonized China or ""political"" topics like ripping Japanese people in half or showing how evil Japanese people were to Chinese people 80 years ago.  EDIT: spelling"
ChineseLanguage,3cfeh5,doranws,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"While I agree with many of your sentiments, it's also worth looking at the media/tradition situation in China in another way. Why do we, as Americans, think that Chinese media is underdeveloped? Because it's not the same as what our American culture has come to respect as ""great"" art.   Let's be honest, America has a pretty short attention span in regards to the arts. Every ten to twenty years or so music changes a lot, movies styles change a lot (ex. orange and teal everywhere!!), we're always on the search for something new.   In older Japanese and Chinese societies, often the goal of the arts was the perfection of your movements, getting to the point that while performing or creating, a self-less zen/Chan state can be attained. Through the drawing of calligraphy, for example, the characters that are drawn are not the real goal, the goal is the state of mind created through concentration. You can read ""Zen in the Art of Archery"" for more information on this.   As a by-product of this searching for the Zen-state, usually the artist has technical perfection. I think this is part of the reason that technique is so valued in Chinese pianists/musicians, partly because it was the sign of a great artist reaching their self-less state in the past.  In the end, besides the points you mentioned, I think there are big Aesthetic differences between China and the West. We value dark, gritty stories where the hero doesn't always end up happy (itself becoming a cliché) and new-ness. I think Eastern societies might value more the retelling of a story in a constant effort to reach technical perfection. Or they may believe it more important to remember the past and its traditions, offering up constant reminders, lest its populace forget. Despite the nature of the original question, neither approach is really ""better"" than the other, both are valid.   tl;dr: I think in America we're used to certain story arcs, camera angles, lighting, etc. so whether we think of it this way or not, we view media that doesn't have these same values (or budget) as ""underdeveloped"" or not as good. It could just as easily be that China values the retelling of stories because they value their history more. Maybe they don't want every sad/gritty story to be digitally colored brown like in the U.S. Or maybe everything you said is absolutely right. I don't know, ha ha."
ChineseLanguage,3cfeh5,samsonkeane,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:51:37 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking at a lack of creativity and skill and ascribing it to a conscious effort on the part of the Chinese film industry.  I would feel more inclined to agree with your point if other countries that were still culturally Chinese also had a horrible film industry. However, you may note that while Taiwanese TV is not very well funded they still make dramas that aren't just the same story repeated over and over. They actually make up their own characters and plots and modernize their filming techniques. They are good enough that there is a demand for them outside Taiwan, which is why subtitled Taiwanese shows are easy to find and people only seem to subtitle a small handful of mainland Chinese shows for the specific purpose of learning Mandarin.  I guess my main response to this would be that in my experience not only does everybody outside China think Chinese TV is awful, but people in China also think it sucks. People are happy whenever a decent film comes out, but they understand that movies and shows made outside China are just typically better. I'm unsure how much bad Chinese TV is responding to Chinese demand, as opposed to film makers just not knowing how to make anything better (and are restricted by the government from really trying out new things).  Zen exists in China, but it was suppressed by the Communist Party for a time and now it is a minority within a minority (other, older Buddhist sects seem to be more popular). Zen in Japan is the mainstream and its effects seem to be in nearly every aspect of Japanese culture. Akira Kurosawa was a master at combining Japanese culture and values with wonderful storytelling and visuals. China has nothing like that, but I guarantee you: if they did, people would be watching everything such a director would make."

Even though you can stream edited versions in China, it's a long time before you'll see a Game of Thrones made in China.  Also, China is still a developing country.

So speaking and casual reading, use 忘记, and in more formal writing use 忘却."

ChineseLanguage,3cdii7,Meihuajiancai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:36:16 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, 忘 and 忘记 are essentially the same. Just bear in mind that when speaking Chinese, it's rare to say 忘. That's why you usually see it combined with another character, ie. 忘记, 忘了.   As for 忘却, that was explained pretty well. I can't recall ever hearing anyone use it in day to day life."

If you go with '阿姨' it may put distance between you - this is something you would call strangers and/or the cook/cleaner.  A lot also really depends on her age.  If for example there is a larger age gap between your dad and your step-mom than there is between you and your step-mom (I don't know anything about your situation, but I know of cases like this), then both 阿姨 and 妈 are going to be strange.  Honestly though, I would speak to her and ask her what she thinks is the most appropriate thing for you to call her.  Explain that you know Chinese naming of relatives is very complex compared to English and you're not sure what is the most appropriate way to address her.

Second, when and if you leave China, you absolutely will have to be certified in order to continue translating (note: the test is expensive and doesn't allow much room for error, at least in Australia).

The countries where Mandarin is an official language is typically for/because of the quantifiable Chinese population there, unlike the chances of people of various ethnicity being able to speak English.  Also, Mandarin is far harder to learn, and has not traditionally been taught in schools, unlike English in China, which is a core subject (for now).

ChineseLanguage,3c86jd,Unrelated_Respons,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:12:52 2015 UTC,"Although doing this might seem useful, once you are beyond HSK6 (and in fact even before) frequency lists will be less and less relevant because what you are reading quite probably is different from the materials used to gather the frequency statistics.  For example, if your interest is in financial news then the frequency of certain financial terms is going to be higher in financial news than it would be in say science fiction (which will have it's own set of frequently occurring words).  This is especially true for Chinese which has a very, very long tail for rarely used words.  You're better off picking some text you find interesting to read and then extracting the frequency statistics and vocabulary from that instead, because it will be directly relevant to what you want to read, rather than based on general frequency.  I made a tool that can help you do that here.  You can use it to analyse Chinese text and then export unknown words based on frequency and first occurence and several other fields for use in flashcarding programs such as Anki.  As a separate note from you question, keep in mind that reading as a skill requires far more than just raw vocabulary acquisition and once you reach a certain vocabulary size, flashcarding more vocabulary doesn't actually help much with reading comprehension (because the extra words you are learning affect only a very small percent of the words you are reading).  If you want to be able to read, then at some point you just need to start reading.  Initially it will always be difficult (regardless of vocab level), but like anything it gets easier with practice."

ChineseLanguage,3c8bud,treskro,2,Sun Jul 5 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"While uncommon, 雨 pronounced with the falling tone means ""to rain"" or ""to fall"" in formal literary usage. http://www.zdic.net/z/27/js/96E8.htm"
ChineseLanguage,3c8bud,yiji,2,Sun Jul 5 21:39:19 2015 UTC,"Not so with the spoken language.  ""Rain"" in Chinese doesn't carry the potential to be a noun or verb.  That actually is a pretty unique characteristic of English, changing a noun into a verb by adding -ing.  But since Chinese doesn't have that conjugation, you need to have 下 to say what the rain is doing in the verb-object structure.    If you say yu4, people are probably going to mistake you for 遇 （which still would need to have a resultative complement)."
ChineseLanguage,3c8bud,SerialATA_Killer,2,Sun Jul 5 22:37:25 2015 UTC,"Not a linguist, but you can can also change many nouns to verbs in Dutch by adding -en.  For example:  kleur - keleuren (to color)  boek - boeken (to book)  damp - dampen (to steam)  baas - bazen (to boss, as changes to z)  And once again, I'm not a linguist, but as a L1 Chinese/English speaker, I feel that 下 (to drop, to fall) is the verb here, while 雨 is the object. What is falling? 雨. Of course, real linguists might consider this an example of 'coverb'."

ChineseLanguage,3c7pbu,xindas,6,Mon Jul 6 00:51:29 2015 UTC,"You're right about the percentages, but discounts work a bit differently.  Whereas in English we express discounts in terms of how much the price has been reduced (ie 30% off), Chinese expresses the positive amount (70% of the original price).  The basic format for this is 打[positive amount]折. These amounts are expressed in terms of multiples of 10 for convenience, so something that is 30% off (70% of original price) is 打七折. Anything that isn't a multiple of 10 will have a decimal, so 25% off (75% price) would be 打7.5折 (打七點五折) or 打七五折.    Multiples are expressed using [number]倍.   今天在這的人數比昨天多了一倍。(The number of people here today is twice as many as yesterday. [one time as many as yesterday plus yesterday's amount])  這個東西的價錢比它多兩倍。(The price of this thing is three times as much. [two times as much as the original price added to the original price])"

Another example where it's not used in a negative sense: 我今天不会过来的，我明天才会过来的。I'm not coming over today, I'll be coming over TOMORROW.

(我昨天晚上2点才睡了)  Although not in your question, there are some other meanings of this character as well:  To show reason as to why you did something. It is specific to that reason and that reason only. For example, ""My girlfriend told me she doesn't love me any more, so I broke up with her."" (我的女朋友告诉我她不爱我了，所以我才跟她分手了)  The 才 in this sentence is saying only because she said she didn't love me any more, so you broke up. Just for that reason.

For some reason it's called a catty (kati) although in Mandarin it's jin (first tone)  The market catty (市斤) is an attempt to standardize things for the metric world and round it down to 500g. When you ask the butcher for 一斤叉烧 you're getting half a kilo of meat because the market catty is assumed.  The metric catty (公斤) is a kilogram. Again, living in a standardized metric world.  :)"

ChineseLanguage,3btmpu,mikailbadoula,12,Thu Jul 2 01:25:54 2015 UTC,"Living in non-Mandarin dominated areas is not a huge deal, but the air pollution is. I'd avoid the Northeast, but Dalian is supposed to be nice city. Being by the sea helps.  For an analogy, if you were learning English, would you avoid living in the rural South of the U.S. just because of a fear of picking up a Southern Twang? I don't think so. These days, especially in China, educated people try hard to speak Standard Mandarin. The only downside you'll have is not understanding when people speak their local dialect. However, when locals (especially older ones) speak Mandarin, they'll have an accent. This is actually good for improving your listening skills. I've met a few foreigners who lived and studied in Beijing for years, then when they re-located South they couldn't understand (or even be understood!) the accented Mandarin they met. Being familiar with how accents (not dialects, but accents: when Chinese people speak Mandarin even when it's not their local dialect) sound can really strengthen your Mandarin comprehension and comprehensibility."
ChineseLanguage,3btmpu,dahv,2,Thu Jul 2 05:03:01 2015 UTC,"This right here. Doesn't matter where you go, you'll always have an accent because you're a foreigner."

ChineseLanguage,3btmpu,dahv,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:48:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting, that wasn't my point, but I'll say the problem with being a foreigner speaking Chinese is that people often don't listen to what you have to say, they first must comment or think upon the fact that you speak Chinese to begin with. This prejudice is changing fast, but generally it stands true.   China is not an immigrant country, and so it doesn't have the cultural value of assimilation (excluding it's domestic minorities, of course). So a Westerner speaking Chinese is assumed to be doing so for the ""fun of it"" or just to show off. The idea that a person does it to integrate into their community is not the initial impression most Mainlanders have. To them it's a novelty, nothing more."
ChineseLanguage,3btmpu,roubingking,5,Fri Jul 3 02:11:51 2015 UTC,"Only thing with Taiwan might be the difficulty in finding a job. From what I've seen Taiwan requires actual teaching certification and significant experience.. the mainland tends to be more lenient in this regard. Of course this may be a non-issue depending on who you are, OP.   And I dunno, I've been living in Beijing for two years now, and looking at the pollution levels from before I got here, it seems to be dropping. It's not really any worse than other places in China. Beijing just has the few odd 300+ days from time to time.   Also there's nothing to do in Dalian. If you're someone who likes activity, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen are probably your best bets."

ChineseLanguage,3btmpu,sancho_bulge,2,Thu Jul 2 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"You will hear non-standard Mandarin wherever you go. And when people interact with you, they will use more or less standard Mandarin. (To be honest, if you don't have East Asian heritage most people will assume you can't speak Chinese anyway, let alone some dialect.) Interacting with people that have slight accents or use some dialect is, in my opinion, good and useful. China is a big place with a lot of people, and they all speak a bit differently. It's a nice (and realistic) counterbalance to the kind of ""pristine"" language you will hear in classrooms with Chinese teachers."

Not to mention the street level pollution from vendors, sewers and other miscellaneous that I can't think of now. Go where your lifestyle will be best suited. No matter where in China or Taiwan you go, they'll be fluent Mandarin speakers and you will have no choice but to communicate in Mandarin if you want to be independent. So I say pick wherever your heart desires. But if you want to avoid pollution, don't even bother coming. Even HK is filthy by most European and American suburban standards."

ChineseLanguage,3bqt9u,menevets,7,Wed Jul 1 12:08:00 2015 UTC,"/u/nomfood is, as usual, correct. English does something similar with phrases like ""in what sense"" where you're not really asking ""In what sense was this a good idea,"" you're making the negated point that things weren't thought out well. In Chinese, with proper context, ""where/哪儿/哪里"" will default at this negative function: 这哪儿是川菜啊: ""In what sense are you calling this (garbage) Sichuanese food?"" or until you get used to it, you could read it as implying ""(Show me) where is this (supposed to be) Sichuanese food,"" etc.  The implication is kinda that it doesn't matter ""where"" you look for it, you're not going to ""find"" a sufficient answer/explanation/justification.    The logic at work should be clearer in a phrase like 哪儿有那么简单的事: ""It's not as simple (as you think)/ It's not that simple."" English could also say ""When are things ever that easy?"" meaning they're never that easy, but with Chinese where/哪儿 covers a lot more of this kind of negative rhetorical ground. Translate 他哪里会真想当老师 as ""Where [in what sense/at what point/on what planet] could this guy actually be trying to be a teacher"" and you can probably still sense the vibe. It's almost a little like ""Yeah, right. As if."" If you were going for ""where can he go to become a teacher,"" you would add a 在 to clarify that you're actually asking where this could be done, and not rhetorically negating the possibility."
ChineseLanguage,3bqt9u,shkencorebreaks,6,Wed Jul 1 13:40:18 2015 UTC,"哪里 is the negative in that sentence. You may have seen 哪里哪里 used before as a way of modestly responding to a compliment. Or the phrase 哪儿啊 used to reply to something you want to dispute.  Example - A: 你汉语说得非常好！ B: 哪里哪里。  There, it means ""No, not at all. My Chinese isn't that great."
ChineseLanguage,3bqt9u,collectsparkles,5,Wed Jul 1 12:20:36 2015 UTC,"This. I would also add that you can think of it like a rhetorical question, like ""Why would he want to be a teacher? = He doesn't want to be a teacher. or 我哪知道, How would I know? = I don't know.  I think it's a little stronger than just using 不 or 没 or whatever, but I'm not 100% sure."

ChineseLanguage,3bqt9u,nomfood,2,Wed Jul 1 12:30:11 2015 UTC,"In this case you cannot take 哪里会 literally. It helps if you replace it with 怎么会 so it is like asking 'Why would he want to become a teacher!' This implies the negative.  Edit: On second thought, I think you can in fact take the literal meaning. Asking 'Where on Earth would he want to become a teacher' is like asking 'Why would he...' with a hint of negativity. Similarly, if I say 我哪里说过 (lit. Where have I said that before?), it would actually mean 'When have I ever said that'."

The PRC 迪拜 and ROC 杜拜 are just transliterated differently from the original Arabic pronunciation."
ChineseLanguage,3bq8mm,sampooo,3,Wed Jul 1 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting. This is an answer I was looking for. Now, Wikipedia (yes, I know, but what else can I do) does state the pronunciation of دبي  in Gulf Arabic, the region's variety, as [dʊˈbɑj]. Where do they pronounce this word in the other ways you have listed, and thus from which country has the PRC taken its source for phonetic transcription?"
ChineseLanguage,3bq8mm,Luomulanren,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:58:12 2015 UTC,What do you mean? It's probably just phonetically translated. That's how names are generally translated in Chinese.

ChineseLanguage,3bq8mm,sampooo,0,Wed Jul 1 09:21:43 2015 UTC,It's just another name for it. My dictionary cites 杜拜 as another name for it as well.
ChineseLanguage,3bq8mm,Luomulanren,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that is not the PRC's translation for Dubai. You wouldn't use that in the PRC. I know this from experience, but no PRC citizen I have asked knew why ""迪拜"" was chosen when even Emiratis pronounce it [dʊˈbɑj].  If ""迪拜"" is indeed a phonetic transcription, then it must phonetically resemble the name for Dubai in a language (or dialect) where the pronunciation is closer to ""Di Bai"", rather than ""Dubai"" per se. If ""迪拜"" is indeed purely phonetic, then I am asking where the PRC got something that sounds like ""Di Bai"" for their official translation of the city's name. Either they never talked to the Emiratis or they have chosen not to use their self-designation, possibly under political influence.  As you can see, I am interested in etymology."
ChineseLanguage,3bq8mm,sampooo,0,Wed Jul 1 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to resemble another language where it sound like ""dibai"". The etymology for names in Chinese is more skewed than it is in English. Don't think of everything having to do with the pinyin of the words, as that was adopted as a way to represent Chinese with Roman characters in more recent years. Rather, western words' representations are much more fluid to account for meaning as well as pronunciation.  The name for KFC in Chinese is 肯德基; that's just a phonetic translation, modified with to a few characters that are somewhat related to the meaning. It doesn't have to resemble the name for Kentucky in a language where the pronunciation is closer to ""kendeji"".  The word 迪 means ""to enlighten"", which might have just been adopted the same way 美 (beautiful) was adopted for the USA or 英 (brave) for England."
ChineseLanguage,3bq8mm,Shlapper,2,Wed Jul 1 19:18:19 2015 UTC,"That's not true, at least for more recent foreign names in PRC.  Your examples aren't very good. There are several countries, like the US and England that had their names transliterated into Chinese during the late Qing dynasty but most countries in the world had their names transliterated later. Even the earlier names had full names, for example England is 英格蘭 Yinggelan, which sounds similar to England to me. But to make it easier for most Chinese to say and remember, the abbreviations are generally used.  As for the example of KFC, it's a business name and most foreign businesses put extra effort into transliterate their own names to ensure their names in Chinese are easy to say, easy to remember and has good meaning. While most may resemble their original name, some may not. I won't go into too much detail here but needless to say it's not a good example to support your argument.  Finally, after the split of PRC & ROC in 1949, PRC adopted new names for some countries that resemble the original (not those in American English) pronunciation better. I can't think of any examples off the top of my head at the moment but I know there are. Maybe if I have spare time later I'll add some but they aren't difficult to find."
ChineseLanguage,3bq8mm,rtyuuytr,0,Wed Jul 1 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"My main point is simply that ""Dibai"" is a phonetic translation. I don't know what the confusion is. What about the names for Canada (jianada) and Mexico (mexige)? I'm saying that the Chinese pinyin isn't going to be exactly the same as the spellings in other languages, but they're still phonetic translations."
ChineseLanguage,3bnygb,anossXVIII,38,Tue Jun 30 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"This is an important topic in Chinese, and one of the interesting features of the language.  Read carefully what I say as it will become increasingly important as you progress.  是 always wants a noun.  你是一隻狗  (You're a dog).  (dog is a noun)   Makes sense right?  However, sometimes you want to also describe the noun.  In these cases you say  你是一隻可愛的狗 (You're a cute dog)   Since 的 is used to join adjectives to a noun (among other things), this works out.  Now, suppose everyone on the planet already knows you're a dog.  Why do I even have to say it?  Instead, I just say:  你是可愛的  (You're cute)   In this case, there is an implied noun.  狗, or if you are saying this to a person it's 人, etc..  But there is no need to say it, so you just don't.  Now, you might think ""hey, I can just say 你可愛 right""?  Yes you can, but 是__的 sentence pattern puts an emphasis on 可愛 (or whatever is between 是 and 的).  So consider this situation in which you would want to use this...  You want to ask someone ""Am I cute or not""?  Of course you can say:  我可愛嗎?   and that's fine,  but you are also probably familiar with one of the other basic ways of asking questions.   For example:  verb 不 verb....  你吃不吃西瓜  (Do you eat watermelon or not?)   Well, since we introduces 是___的 sentence pattern to sentences without a noun by giving them an implied noun, we can now use this to ask questions.  So, back to the original example:  我是不是可愛的?  (Am I cute, or not?)   This is just fine.  There are exceptions to this, sometimes (rarely) 是.. is used without a following noun or 的 with an implied noun after it.    about 有.  你沒有錯  (You weren't wrong)  Forget how ""have"" works in english.  This isn't English, it doesn't matter.  What you are seeing here is 有 (or 沒有 the negative of it) being used to denote something in the past.  我沒有借給你那輛汽車  I didn't loan you that car   Tenses are more complicated, and not always used.  If you're studying Chinese from a textbook or in a class, you should eventually cover how Chinese handles ""tense"" (and I use that term loosely) in more detail later.  But there is at least one example you have probably encountered.  That is the ""Have you ever been to China"" question.  You have probably seen  你去過中國嗎?   In this case the 過 after the verb (sort of means ""through"") acts as a way to say you have ""experienced"" whatever the verb is describing.  我去過中國  (I've been to China)   If you have not been to China, you can reply:  我沒去過中國 (I have not been to China)   This is actually the same as 我沒有去過中國, just the 有 is often omitted for brevity.  Both are correct though.  But ignore the coincidence that the previous sentence has ""有"" in the Chinese version and ""have"" in the English version.  That's not a good way to think about it.  Besides 錯 is NOT a noun, so you can't ""possess"" it.  The noun for mistake would be 錯誤 measured by 個 so that       三個錯誤 = 3 mistakes."
ChineseLanguage,3bnygb,baozichi,3,Tue Jun 30 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"Now, you might think ""hey, I can just say 你可愛 right""?  Yes you can, but 是__的 sentence pattern puts an emphasis on 可愛 (or whatever is between 是 and 的).   Would it be reasonable to think of this pattern as saying ""you're a cute one""?"
ChineseLanguage,3bnygb,stebrepar,2,Tue Jun 30 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, since in English there isn't a direct translation of the implied noun (but there would be in Japanese, for example)"

ChineseLanguage,3bnygb,mtg0921,2,Wed Jul 1 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"""笨蛋"" is a noun while ""笨"" is an adjective.  The structure of ""你是+Adj.+的"" doesn't actually translate in to ""you are ___  "". People would just say ""我很好"", ""你很可愛"" in that sense."
ChineseLanguage,3bnygb,shrewdster,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:49:01 2015 UTC,"Native speaker here.  The 的 particle is often used as a possessive particle.   In your example, when you say ""我是很好的..."" you're saying ""You're a very good (insert noun e.g. 人)"" but then that translate to ""I'm a very good person"". If someone asks how you are? You can simply reply with ""我很好啊"" which translates to ""I'm very good"".   The 是 particle often refers to ""is"" or ""are"" followed by a noun.   The insult ""你是笨蛋"" translate to ""You're an idiot"" or you can say ""你是(一)个笨蛋"" which translates to ""You are an idiot"".  In this context: ""你是 <noun>"" translates to ""You are a <noun>""  When you combine those two particles, the best way to understand it is like this:   我是 <adverb> 的 <noun> I'm a <adverb> <noun>   Example:   我是很高的人 I'm a very tall person   As for 你没有错, you can say both 你没有错 or 你没错. Do you have any other examples that I could be used?  Sorry but I'm in a hurry atm. If you need some more examples, let me know!"
ChineseLanguage,3bnygb,shengsu,0,Wed Jul 1 08:34:56 2015 UTC,"""我高兴"" isn't correct sentence. 高兴 is adjective. When simple sentence has adjective predicate, you should add 很 before it. In this situation it doesn't have ""very"" meaning, it is just grammatical particle. So, it should be 我很高兴."

ChineseLanguage,3bmdqy,FruitFarmer2,12,Tue Jun 30 11:39:40 2015 UTC,"Without context, this reads like something that can happen in conversational speech, where you'd expect there to have been a slight pause after the first 就: ""He just- the guy just disappeared."" It could also be a attempt at mid-utterance overcorrection, where the intention was to say something like ""他就那么消失了"" but then the speaker decided to use ""人就消失了"" instead, then it reads a bit awkwardly because 他 and 人, while referring to the same person, are fighting it out for the subject position.    Regardless, this doubled-up 就 isn't a pattern or anything. Again, without context, the most 'grammatically acceptable' reading you could give this sentence is probably to assume that the speaker is taking [人就消失了] as a standalone verbal clause in itself, then the structure is simply ""And like that, he just [verbed]."" Let us know where you're seeing this, that would be necessary for determining the actual meaning."

You couldn't get away with writing ""他就人就消失了"" without providing sufficient context because it's technically ungrammatical, but when talking informally like this, there's nothing wrong with stopping to collect your thoughts. She's just maybe a bit overexcited and kinda breathlessly speeding through her story. Also if you listen to the way she talks in general, 就 is somewhat overused in this kind of speech- it gets to border almost on US English ""like,"" ""y'know,"" etc (but more like Korean 그냥, in case that little tidbit is useful to anyone), where it's not really adding any semantic value and is just there to emphasize the ""this is how it was-ness"" of the situation. ""Then he just, you know, I just like never heard from him again,"" or whatever."

As for why she had to switch from a specific third-person pronoun to a more general noun, it is a sociolinguistic issue. My guess is that she wanted to make the unfortunate event sound less personal and thus herself less desperate. It is to signal that she's now cool with her ex being a dick.  td;dr: lazy subtitles"
