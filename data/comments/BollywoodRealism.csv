But most of the market is centered around 3 hours of mindless entertainment so you tend to get a lot of shit.   Another thing to note is that quite a few movies you see on this sub do really bad at the box office. A good mass entertainer needs to find that middle ground between acceptable story and engaging screenplay to be successful.

BollywoodRealism,3cpwvd,chantuaurbantu,8,Thu Jul 9 20:46:44 2015 UTC,"Usually all Indian movies are screened with sub titles afaik.  And I would suggest checking all the major movie theater's websites in your area for up coming movies. May be the Indian dominated areas with a lot Indian restaurants and stores and all that; movie screenings after all are about demand. If you are in the US, Fandango is a good app for this."

BollywoodRealism,3cmd6n,mutantratking,2,Thu Jul 9 20:14:38 2015 UTC,HAHA the arms on the left guy!
BollywoodRealism,3cmd6n,mikeyhoffy,2,Thu Jul 9 20:06:47 2015 UTC,This looks like an imitation/tribute/parody of the final fight scene from Ong Bak.  http://youtu.be/crjyOwHfH6w  See around the 1:47 mark.
BollywoodRealism,3cmd6n,nuanimal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:23:19 2015 UTC,That fight was brutal.. the amount of work that went into the choreography is just unfathomable.

BollywoodRealism,3cjcj3,HydroCabron,3,Wed Jul 8 17:34:34 2015 UTC,"I imagine there is only one stunt coordinator out there, and The Matrix is his favorite movie from the west. Everything is in slow motion and defies physics and gravity in the most ridiculous fashion."
BollywoodRealism,3cjcj3,chantuaurbantu,2,Wed Jul 8 17:46:04 2015 UTC,Is he like a superhero or god or something? I really don't understand the ridiculous power levels in these movies.  He could probably kick Superman's ass.
