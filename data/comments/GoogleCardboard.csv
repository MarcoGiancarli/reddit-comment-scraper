GoogleCardboard,3e3w9h,OutsourcedToTheWest,8,Tue Jul 21 19:30:30 2015 UTC,Why are you getting rid of buttons?
GoogleCardboard,3e3w9h,In_Film,10,Tue Jul 21 21:19:18 2015 UTC,The capacitive button is one of the key features of Cardboard v2.0.  How will your users interact with their apps without a button?
GoogleCardboard,3e3w9h,sous_v,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:41:47 2015 UTC,"While not including any type of button will pretty much ruin the chances for the product, I'd actually like to see more devices without one, and VR software shouldn't require one. The Google View Profile Generator includes this as a valid option, the ""Primary button type"" can be set to NONE, MAGNET, TOUCH and INDIRECT_TOUCH. The selected value can be read from the Cardboard SDK by any app, so a Cardboard app that doesn't have a proper way to react to a ""NONE"" setting isn't really compatible to Cardboard. There are already a number of viewers that don't feature one (e.g. the Homido), in general placing the button on the viewer is a bad solution for anything with head straps. And since neither the magnet nor capacitative button work reliably for all users even if they are present, developers should always include an alternative anyway. More devices without buttons will make the need for alternatives more obvious.   How will your users interact with their apps without a button?   The button on Cardboard was and is a hack, and a large number of the existing VR apps don't require it. Any viewer that doesn't include a button can work with apps that require one by giving the user access to the screen for tapping, but there are a large number of alternative interface options and apps that use these exclusively:   Head tracking only: VR Volcano Flythrough Android Gaze control: Froggy VR Android/iOS Gamepad: SpaceTerrorVR Android Audio input: Virtual Kaiju 3D where you have to roar into the microphone to make your Godzilla-like character spit fire Android/iOS Head gestures (nodding, head tilt controls walking etc.): VR Jump n Run Android Tapping Cardboard (no the screen, but the case, sideways movement measured by accelerometers): was included in an experimental version of Proton Pulse for the Oculus Rift. Any combination of the above. Bluetooth mouse as a simple hack to ""tap"" the screen without touching it.   There are many things that could be improved with Cardboard, and while getting rid of the button will limit the use cases, a button isn't strictly a must-have."
GoogleCardboard,3e3w9h,faduci,6,Wed Jul 22 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"Improving usability   You should clarify what you mean by getting ""rid of buttons of any kind"". If you mean not including either a magnet switch or a conductive lever, at least provide an opening in the bottom for users to touch the screen. Print ""Touch the screen to click"" onto the Cardboard. Extra cardboard flap in areas where something has to be lifted from velcro. Current designs lead to bending the cardboard almost immediately, which could be solved by adding a small piece of cardboard already bend in the direction of the pull, ideally directly behind the velcro. This would allow to apply most of the force directly to pulling of the velcro. Make sure the velcro is not too strong and bonds well with the surface, otherwise the whole construction will bend and the velcro will detach after some time. If you don't include the Cardboard 2.0 button, use two small velcro patches at the edges instead of one large one in the middle. If you make the top velcro a little longer and provide two extra 8mm folds at the top, you can make the front flap higher for larger phones while still providing a way to get a large velcro contact area to ensure it won't accidentally open. Provide a few long and slim straps of 2mm thick Cardboard with notches at the small ends to be placed below the phone and held in place with the rubber band. These can be used to lift smaller phone slightly higher, so their screen is actually centered instead of being stuck at the bottom. Print an URL as text and QR code on the viewer that leads to a page that includes assembly instructions and first steps. Print ""First steps"" in bold letters above the URL/QR code, so users without any clue will have a place to go to. Print markers where to place the velcro for cheap head straps, even if you do not include them. Precut opening for camera holes, or just printed markers where to cut for several cameras. As the camera is located at different places and very few users will ever use the function, while it decreases stability, the cardboard should only be removed on demand. By providing 1-3 precut holes on each side the user can determine the right position for the camera hole on his/her phone. Only printing markers might actually be the best option regarding stability.   Improving visuals   Optional optical divider. The Cardboard 2.0 design has enough space for one, despite the lever/button and larger nose hole, it just will be more complicated to fix it and helps some users. Make the round cutouts slightly larger. They are the right size for 50mm FL lenses for someone who is normal sighted, but short sighted users will actually see the cardboard cutouts. This will also require the extra optical divider, as moving close enough to see more than the cutout shows also leads to the two image to overlap. Make sure that the inside of the Cardboard is black and doesn't reflect light. The sides in Cardboard 2.0 have been shortened to allow folding it down, but this increases light bleeding. It would be possible to go back to the Cardboard 1.0 length by folding it once more along the part with the round cutout. Not sure if this wouldn't make it to complicate to a) produce and b) assemble for new users. Consider including some extra cardboard going from the nose hole towards the screen. While the larger hole in Cardboard 2.0 has many advantages, it is possible to look through it, causing very irritating artifacts. The best way to solve this would be to have it fully closed, going right up to the screen. It will still be outside the visible area.   Feel free to ask for more details if the items listed above aren't unclear."
GoogleCardboard,3e3w9h,faduci,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:25:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Three additional things   there should be a better way of loading than the velcro flap, fold down locking tabs maybe? I think not allowing the flap to open so far might well open new options (eg only a cm or two) You also shouldn't risk phantom touches of the screen whilst loading. the area around the nose bridge and forehead need to both be more comfortable, and easier the clean for grease etc. The 'plastic coated' should help with the second, but I can see the place for cheap molded clip on plastic bits as well. storage, it should either be collapsible, or be able to 'stand' in some suitably rakish way."
GoogleCardboard,3e3w9h,canyouhearme,6,Wed Jul 22 02:18:27 2015 UTC,Not sure I agree with getting rid of buttons.  Biggest thing for me would be a good FOV

GoogleCardboard,3e3w9h,guimmer,2,Tue Jul 21 20:56:20 2015 UTC,One problem you should take care of is the fact that there aren't any downloadable plans for the V2.0 cardboard.

GoogleCardboard,3e4nbe,legodude2,3,Tue Jul 21 22:41:53 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest issues with AR on Google Cardboard is latency.

GoogleCardboard,3e48jf,srpntmage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:13 2015 UTC,"I had the Homido for my Oneplus One and ended up sending it back. It just did not work with it like I would expect for that price. My wife has a 6+ and it wasn't truly big enough for that either.  I just got in the IAmCardboard XG Headset and... it's awesome. I love the fit, it's way more comfortable, the quality just seems better overall. There are some weird quirks (No IPD adjustment, removable panels for the headphone / charger spots) but it is a solid headset that can be comfortable to wear for a while."
GoogleCardboard,3e48jf,motioneso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"The Homido is better for displays 5"" or less.  Homido is not being very forthright in saying displays bigger than 5"" actually ""fit"".  IMO the best non Gear VR at the moment is Freefly VR, but probably best if you do not need reading glasses (fixed lenses)."
GoogleCardboard,3e48jf,rushmore69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:40:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think it has anything to do with the phones size. I can see the inside walls of the VR unit itself. I'm guessing that is because the FOV is only 100 degrees. Video just looks grainy and low res. Is this just the way Mobile VR is right now? Are Oculous, Morpheus, Vive etc... much better than this?"
GoogleCardboard,3e4iva,roberh,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"A lot of/all apps right now are gonna be kind of clunky, atleast for cardboard. Most quality apps are for the Samsung gear vr although I'm not sure how much of an improvement they are. I had to lower my expectations a bit before I could begin to enjoy cardboard apps."
GoogleCardboard,3e4iva,lost_in_thesauce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:37:38 2015 UTC,"I thought gear vr was more demanding gpu and cpu wise, so the s6 should get 60 fps at least on cardboard apps. Guess Im wrong?"
GoogleCardboard,3e4iva,lost_in_thesauce,3,Tue Jul 21 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"My guess is that Samsung gear apps have much higher quality developers than cardboard apps, which should improve FPS among other things. You may also want to make sure to close out all other apps while using cardboard apps. I have an s6 edge and it seems to lag a lot when multiple apps are open, especially cardboard ones which are very demanding."
GoogleCardboard,3e4iva,faduci,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:43:26 2015 UTC,"Oculus implemented a number of changes to Android that significantly improve the motion-to-photon latency, i.e. the time it takes to render a picture that matches the current head rotation. They pushed it down to about 20ms, while it is technically impossible to get below about 75ms on Cardboard. Low persistence and time wrapping require altered display/sensor drivers, so unless they are implemented in the AndroidVR OS, Gear VR apps will remain a lot better than their Cardboard equivalent even on the same phone.  Besides these technical improvements the Oculus SDK is much more advanced, e.g. it allows to dynamically alter the rendered resolution. If the frame rate drops, the SDK starts rendering at a lower than native solution to reduce the performance and lets the GPU up-sample the image, while Cardboard apps always render at native solution. In effect this means that many Gear VR apps run at much lower resolutions than the phone actually displays, which is a small price to pay for keeping the frame rate high. The SDK is also allowed to stop Android from throttling CPU and GPU to safe energy/prevent overheating, so Gear VR apps get ""guaranteed"" power, while Cardboard apps have to deal with the fact that phones get slower once they are hot. These features only work in the presence of Gear VR, they aren't available for any Cardboard app on the S6. This is an artificial limitation, not a technical one, Oculus/Samsung simply keep them exclusive.  Gear VR developers are usually (a lot) better and more experienced than Cardboard developers, most of them have been developing for the Oculus Rift before, but as Titans of Space appeared first for the Rift DK1, then DK2, Gear VR and finally for Cardboard, lack of competence/experience most certainly isn't a problem for /u/DrashVR, the developer of Titans of Space. As Cardboard numbers are growing at a more than a magnitude faster than Gear VR, it becomes more likely that developers try to cover both platforms to maximize their potential market, so the average developer competence should increase over time."

GoogleCardboard,3e1ntd,DemonicDream,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"The Alcatel Idol X has no gyroscope sensor, so Cardboard software will not work, or at least head tracking will not work, making it pointless. The accelerometer, compass or orientation sensors found in many phones cannot replace the gyro, so unfortunately you are out of luck for VR. The QR code only adjusts the rendering to lens position and magnification, it doesn't influence the basic functionality. On a phone without a gyroscope all you can do is watch side-by-side videos, which can be interesting by itself to get some impression of VR, but it is not really the same."
GoogleCardboard,3dzep1,truthusd,5,Mon Jul 20 19:45:20 2015 UTC,"I tried to find out some time ago, without any real results. ""Valencia Quality"" pops up in numerous descriptions on different sites, always refering to some kind of Cardboard made out of cardboard. There is never any explanation, and it doesn't show up in any other contexts. Despite looking I can't find any special surface finishing or other process related to Valencia, it seems to be complete random.  My best guess is that this is was initially a mistranslation from Chinese that keeps being copied without anybody ever checking what it means. And why should they? It contains the word ""quality"" in a non-questionable way, so even if it is an error, it is useful for marketing.  It also wouldn't be the first time something like this happens, e.g. a large number of plastic 3D viewers are sold as ""NEJE"" viewers. This looks like the name of the manufacturer, but in reality it is derived from a sticker placed on them which lists several production certificates like CE or ROHS, NEJE just happens to be the first on the list. So what might mean something like ""was produced according to Chinese manufacturing requirements"" now has become a virtual producer of Virtual Reality equipment. Very meta."

It's going to be really exciting as more content makers create experiences specifically for VR. You should definitely develop new stuff for VR :)   Also I think mobile VR is going to be a big part of it. I've tried Oculus Rift (crescent bay) and Valve/HTC Vive, and those are fantastic, but it's hard to beat the Cardboard's accessibility. You don't even need to buy a new device! How great is that?"
GoogleCardboard,3dzzac,seanshin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"VR I believe is the next step in terms of immersion- mainly gaming, possibly home movies, and possibly going in to mainstream movies.  As for gaming, head-tracking crosshairs need to die and be replaced with a setup similar to Wii shooters- your head controls where the camera is pointed, and your controller dictates where the crosshairs are within the camera's frame. Either that, or go for full immersion and completely eliminate crosshairs so that shots are more erratic."
GoogleCardboard,3dzzac,Farren246,0,Tue Jul 21 14:53:15 2015 UTC,"So I think it is the beginning.  The tech isn't good enough for triple a titles.  Simply not possible with current phones.  I personally think Microsoft and Sony are best positioned to make VR huge.  Ubiquity is everything in terms of creating a new genre, and most people won't pay $1500.00 or more for occulus.  I wish I could say cardboard will be huge, but almost no one in the mainstream knows it exists, and Google appears largely uninterested in cardboard.  Google is half a billion dollars interested in magic leap however, and I have no doubt that VR and AR are the interfaces of the  future."

GoogleCardboard,3dyfj5,Seattle-Skies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:22 2015 UTC,"From Tinydeal Cardbord basics, tips and modifications (magnets, centering, grease protection):   Google recommends neodymium magnets, while those from Tinydeal are regular and much weaker magnets. The magnets aren't particularly useful anyway, since almost no apps support them, but if you want to use them, you may have to modify your Cardboard. I use one of the officially supported phones and had tried it with different magnets before. From this I knew that the position of the magnets has to be very precise to work as a trigger. The Tinydeal magnets were too weak and too far away, but worked if I placed the phone slightly higher. So I extended the holes for both magnets by about 5mm/0.2inch downwards and everything worked fine. You have to extend both holes, because the magnets hold each other in position, and if the are pulled too far apart, one of them will flip over. As a side effect the magnet became easier to grab due to the extra space above it. The Tutorial part of the Cardboard app can be used to try the magnets. Try first without Cardboard by moving the magnet across your phone with your fingers to determine if it works at all. If not, you can simply double tap the screen instead of pulling the magnet to trigger something in the Cardboard app."

GoogleCardboard,3dv8mt,YesICannabis420,3,Mon Jul 20 17:12:10 2015 UTC,No offence taken. I think Android has the same problem> Currently 360º YouTube videos only support 1080p on mobile whether it's in the native application (without VR) or in the application mentioned above. 1080p just isn't high enough for a reasonable experience in VR. It's going to be a while before we start seeing high quality 360º YT videos on our mobile HMDs. Have a look at some of the content on your computer and set the resolution to maximum (anything above 1080p) and you'll see even at 1440p it's still not good enough to make out people's faces in crowds or see any detail in anything that's not close to the camera.

If possible, wait for a similar headset with better lenses. But this is also a good temporary headset. This and the predecessor will be my main HMDs until the Vive or a better affordable Mobile HMD is available. I think Freefly VR is pretty popular, and VR Box has received mixed reviews. I've only owned the two headsets (Storm II and III) so my opinion is limited."
GoogleCardboard,3dtcqd,rushmore69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:39:50 2015 UTC,"Looking at the size of the view portal suggests cut-off beyond 5"" displays- if you want maximum resolution.  This would mean lower resolution to get the split images to fit correctly and increase screen door as a result (less resolution).  All VR units have compromises.  The Freefly has very clear anamorphic lenses with no refractive issues, no cut-off, but can not manually focus lenses (fixed).  This means folks that wear reading glasses might have issues.  FOV is the same as the Gear VR Note 4 (wish it were more like the S6 version- less FOV and less SDE).  High FOV is not always a good thing- especially for movies even on a 1440p device.  Less than 1440p (720p split) would be even more funky with higher FOV."

I understand those have been used in Project Tango ""VR"" demos. I have a modded Colorcross working with KindleFire HDX. I may soon post a video. The idea is that you unhinge the connecting plates at the corners and then stretch the 4 side plates. To keep everything stable, you cut the middle separating sections at an angle and attach a piece of cardboard with a trapezoid shape that holds them and the top and bottom side plates in place. You fix the tablet against that structure and strap it with velcro. The IPD adjustment of the Colorcross is shorter than necessary, so you remove the lens holding plate and substitute it with a cardboard shaped to hold the Colorcross lenses. You will need and IPD between your eyes around 7cm, so this would not work for people with smaller IPDs. Durovis have an adjustment for tablets in their plugin. Finally, to compensate for the slightly shorter focal distance from the stretching of the plates, you fix +3 dioptre lenses from a pair of cheap reading glasses."

Usually your brain is constantly checking for details and due to the current state of Cardboard VR the result is usually ""this isn't real"", limiting the experience.  If you have problems to even talk or walk due to intoxication, your brain is simply to busy to also check the level of reality. Distraction works too. In a discussion on /r/oculus someone described the first time he felt ""presence"" (forgetting that you are in VR). At the time he was using Gear VR to watch a movie in a virtual cinema, but was thinking about something else, when some people in the same (real) room started talking. Annoyed that someone was talking during a movie he looked in their direction and was surprised to see only empty cinema seats. Other users had very impressive experiences when falling asleep with the HMD on and waking up in VR, simply because it takes a couple of seconds to realize that this might not be real."

I've grown past the stigmatisms of my youth. But boy howdy... when I get tired, it near completely closes when the ""good"" eye is only about half closed.  ... just call me Timmy!  As for the VR stuff, they need to allow individual lenses to move across the X and Y planes individually. Not everyone's eyes are even, let alone things like droopy eyelids. If I could find that kind of headset, I'd even consider paying a lot more for it because it takes a dynamic approach to being able to use it in the first place."
GoogleCardboard,3dn8ub,Kyrkogrim,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:43 2015 UTC,"Ptosis surgeries have come a long way, also there are many treatments for dry eye even going as far as punctal plugs.   Back in the day they use to solder/weld on a ptosis crutch to an eyeglass frame. You might be able to find an eyeglass repair shop to make that type of add-on for you. You will want at least a plastic headset if you are going that far obviously. :-)"

I find 2D movies more than fine on VR,  but have gone back to using mainly the Gear VR for now due to the issues with Cmoar movie playback.   I find the other movie apps inadequate, so no decent option IMO.  I have tried them all.  I think  the format is actually 2.35:1.  Added: It is.  Cmoar needs big time work, since seems more focused on filling the display rather than format accuracy."

GoogleCardboard,3dmbml,mvkishoresr,5,Fri Jul 17 12:54:02 2015 UTC,"I just received my Baofeng Gen III today.   The overall construction is quite good As far as I can tell, it appears to actually be pretty close to the advertised 98 degree FOV It has individual IPD adjustments per eye It has a focal distance adjustment The chromatic aberration is very noticeable in the outer 2/3 of the FoV, but this could be compensated for in software. You don't notice any looking straight ahead It does feel front-heavy after 10+ minutes of use, and can put some stress on the bridge of your nose. You may find yourself re-adjusting it a bit just to keep things comfortable.   I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about it as best I can  EDIT: I should mention that I am using it with a Nexus 5, and this is my first plastic ""Cardboard"" headset that I've purchased. I have never used the alternatives (GearVR, Zeiss VR One, ColorCross etc). The only HMDs I have experience with are the Oculus DK1 and the original Google Cardboard."
GoogleCardboard,3dmbml,fizz_pop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:50:42 2015 UTC,"If this is your first cardboard, how can you compare if is 98 degrees?  The Gear VR Note 10 is 98 degrees, so have to turn head left and right to capture entire movie view.  I actually wish it were not such high FOV due to screen door effect.  Based on the lenses and view portal, seems the FOV would be a lot less than 98 degrees."
GoogleCardboard,3dmbml,rushmore69,2,Sat Jul 18 12:30:30 2015 UTC,"I used the test chart in VRCinema to compare the FoV between the devices. My Google Cardboard yielded an ~80° FoV where my Baofeng Gen III HMD yielded a ~96° FoV. The magnification is noticeably stronger with the Baofeng and obviously makes the ""screen door effect"" more obvious.  I do notice that it feels a bit like I'm looking through a pair of wide binoculars, with dark circles on the extreme boundaries of my peripheral vision. Additionally, the chromatic aberration I'm seeing on the fringes of the image is REALLY strong and distracting. In terms of clarity, the Google Cardboard looks much more natural with very minimal color fringing and much less ""screen door effect"", as would be expected.  This is not a bad headset for the price, but I think for a little bit more it would be smarter to just get the Zeiss VR One (or for a lot more, get the GearVR). I think that if you're looking for a very solid HMD for daily use, you would be happier putting out a little extra money for a much better headset.  Here's a side-by-side of the Baofeng vs. Google Cardboard: http://i.imgur.com/wds92uK.jpg  I figured I should show off a small gallery of images of the device itself while I'm at it: http://imgur.com/a/PnBeH"

GoogleCardboard,3dmbml,rushmore69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:01:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but making the image smaller to fit for less head moving means more screen door effect since even lower resolution.

Played any Games, and positive or negative response  ?  10 mins implies bad for movies..Not suggested ?  How does it hold the phone ? In the images you posted(4th image), the view to the smartphone is obstructed..How does it work  ? Adjustable sliders for holding the phone ?  All in all, rating out of 10 ?  I want to use for movies, so personal recommendation  ?"
GoogleCardboard,3dmbml,fizz_pop,2,Sat Jul 18 15:26:23 2015 UTC,"Like with all HMDs, just because the FoV is higher does not mean it will necessarily have a better experience. This headset is a good example of that.  The way the headphone jack works is really quite simple: it has a female 3.5mm jack on the outside of the device that goes through the headset into the phone compartment where it becomes a 3.5mm male connector. It does make having headphones connected to the headset a little more comfortable, although I find the outer port to be a little wobbly when plugging/unplugging my headphones. This hopefully helps show the headphone jack works a little better: http://imgur.com/a/AARke  I have not played any games with it yet, mostly just a few movies (2D, SBS and 3D) and the Google Cardboard demos for now. I bought the headset for development purposes (I was getting tired of holding my Google Cardboard by hand while debugging all the time, and wanted a more ergonomic option) and figured I might as well try out this fun little GearVR clone just for the fun of it! :)  It's not terrible for long sessions but it may start to put light pressure on your cheek bones and the bridge of your nose. The size/weight of your phone will obviously play a big part in the overall comfort. I find that it feels similar to the Oculus developer kits.  There are two silicone ""L"" brackets on the bottom of the phone compartment. They can be moved left or right to accommodate phone widths of between 5.2"" and 6.4"" (I just measured). They do a good job of keeping the phone secure when in use.  My overall thoughts are that the product itself is actually quite nice in terms of quality. Good build quality, sleek look (obviously taking some strong design cues from Samsung/Oculus!) and decent ergonomics.  The part where this headset really fails is the optical performance. As you could probably see in the gallery I posted above, the chromatic aberration from the lenses is really noticeable. I had a suspicion that this would be the case considering that the magnification on this headset would have had to be much higher in order to claim ~90° FoV, and for $50 I knew sacrifices would have to be made somewhere. It's a bit of a shame, really :(  In summary, I would rate the Baofeng Storm III somewhere around 6.5/10. Good overall design, poor optical performance. Sometimes it's best just to spend a little more to get a lot more :)  If you're looking for a good movie experience, I would look at the Zeiss VR One. It seems to be the best reasonably priced version currently. I may very well end up ordering one for myself in the coming weeks, too!"
GoogleCardboard,3dmbml,rushmore69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks, fizz_pop..  Wired connection,it is  :) Yes, I observed from your picture that the chromatic aberration is slightly on the intolerable side..  See if you can change the lenses.. If that can be done, I am sure we got something awesome on our hands..  The build seems pretty decent - it has sliders, good adjustments everything..  For comfort, I guess I can adjust cuz I will lie down to watch movies, removing the pressure from the nose..  Any info on the lenses ? Focal length and diameter ?  And, final question.. 5.2 to 6.4 is the total phone size, and not screen size - right  ?"
GoogleCardboard,3dmbml,piculi,2,Sat Jul 18 17:07:12 2015 UTC,"I may very well try to mod this headset to use different lenses sometime. First, however, I want to first see if I can compensate for the chromatic aberration with software.   The lenses themselves are ~2.7"" in diameter http://i.imgur.com/2DgULXo.jpg Focal length appears to be ~1.6"" The 5.2"" to 6.4"" tolerance I mentioned relates to the measured distance between the holders. Here is an image that should help clarify things: http://i.imgur.com/RyA666V.jpg   For me, I think that by the time I consider the cost of supplies to mod this headset into something that is more optically pleasing, I will be approaching the cost of a higher-end HMD like the Homido or Zeiss VR One. For that reason, I would suggest to you that you consider just spending the extra money and getting something that works better straight out of the box :)"
GoogleCardboard,3dmbml,fizz_pop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:40:02 2015 UTC,"The actual view portal dimensions arer key.  Homido is infamous for quoting ""fits"" up to 6"" displays, but they do not tell people the view portal is cut off on displays bigger than 4.9"".  5"" display users will not notice, but G3, G4, iPhone 6 + and Note 4 users have to shrink the image to avoid cut-off.

I ordered a powis viewer at the end of June, and despite the ""please allow 1 week production time"", and the 2 day shipping I paid for, I still haven't heard a word about it. It's disappointing, but their product seems so good, and as long as you expect it to be a bit of a wait before receiving it, I think you'll be fine. It's one of the expectations of buying from a relatively small business. Hopfully as they get more business they will clear this all up."

It would be much better if they were realistic about their shipping times and didn't continue to keep the 1 week production warning on the product page, since I'm guessing not 1 person got their viewer within 2 weeks of buying it.

Only thought I have would be if the light coming in would be noticeable where the phone doesn't fill up the gap in the back.  Any options with straps on them?"
GoogleCardboard,3ddxbe,msmouse05,4,Wed Jul 15 15:17:18 2015 UTC,"During our tests, we didn't really notice too much light coming in but that's a valid point we identified too and we hope to close the gaps during the final design phase. We are also coming up with a list of phones that are most compatible with our design.   We created holes or slots where straps can go in, but we don't intend right now to have it as a reward but as a stretch goal reward."
GoogleCardboard,3ddxbe,thomasthetanker,4,Wed Jul 15 16:06:41 2015 UTC,I would leave some hole in the back though for the camera. Its only a matter of time before we get apps that effectively use the camera aswell.
GoogleCardboard,3ddxbe,scott_ci,6,Wed Jul 15 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"First, your design is very pretty!  The adjustable lenses on cardboard 2.0 (specifically ""Unofficial Cardboard""'s version) enabled me to not see double for the first time on cardboard. I never had any issues on Gear VR.  Being able to handle a 5"" screen also greatly enhances the experience for me, almost getting close to Gear VR if I don't count the latency.  Consider putting a hole somewhere so you can stick your finger in and tap the screen. iOS doesn't support the magnet.  We give tons of demos, and therefore never use the straps."
GoogleCardboard,3ddxbe,Farren246,7,Wed Jul 15 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"Forgive me, but my unused business degree gets itchy sometimes... My big question is how you're going to differentiate yourself. Your design may be durable, but that won't be enough.  I just got a plastic set from China for $11 with a head strap (3 cords for left/right/top of head), adjustable lens position, large enough to fit a 6"" phablet, and fully blocks light while still allowing cords for charging or headphones. Granted it has no camera-out ability, which yours has in abundance.  So does yours include straps to up its value? Is it durable enough that it'll last longer? Will it provide THAT much of a better fit, vs. the foam pads on my cheap China set (which feels very comfortable, btw)? What about compatibility with whatever device I have, both now and in the future? What if I want a phablet, or a tiny, cheap 4"" phone? You can 3D print them, but that's a lot of silicone and plastic pieces (bought in bulk) could be cheaper... is yours cheap enough to compete with my China headset's price-point?"
GoogleCardboard,3ddxbe,MairusuPawa,4,Wed Jul 15 17:22:05 2015 UTC,"Every single cheap plastic set I tried so far had a very, very poor FoV.

GoogleCardboard,3ddxbe,MairusuPawa,2,Wed Jul 15 20:54:03 2015 UTC,Yeah this was our concern too. We would love to have a bigger FoV but that involves buying lenses that are much more expensive thus raising our intended price point. It has been noted though as we seek to further develop this.

GoogleCardboard,3ddxbe,zaphodp3,4,Wed Jul 15 18:11:24 2015 UTC,"Really good questions.  The headset you described sounds pretty good. Can you provide a link or the name of the product you bought out of curiosity?  1) Our vision was similar to the Cardboard where we felt it should be a casual experience. Users looking to use it for extended time have better options-HMDs that can provide a better user experience. We didn't want our product to immediately deter people from VR. That said we did include holes to have straps if we create them.  2) from tests we done, the silicon feels more comfortable than cardboard. Versus foam pads, I can't objectively say, more surveys need to be done. I would say it's akin to feeling like you are wearing the rubber from swimming goggles versus foam.   3) Compatibility will always be an issue in this space. Change is the only constant in technology. We are working on a compatibility chart that provides transparency into which device works best - but generally anything you can use with the Google Cardboard V1 should work on our prototype.  4) 4""phones work but the screen resolution is not optimal. Phablets - hopefully in the future we can create a new model that fits the resolution  5) We hope to raise funds through Kickstarter so we can create the molds that leads to the production run of the first editions.   6) Tentatively right now, early bird would be around $30 including shipping to U.S. We just need to confirm with our suppliers, etc.   7) Thanks for the tip on voilà!"

GoogleCardboard,3df475,TecktonikMuffin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:59:00 2015 UTC,"I would assume it would work.  As for the NFC tag, (at least for me) I have to ""install"" part of the app which then requires a reboot, then have to ""load"" the app each time I want to use which also requires a reboot. After that there's just a big button in the middle of the screen to toggle it on and off.  I don't know why I have to reinstall the app/framework for it each time (as it should just keep working but doesn't for me). There is also an option to load it every time on boot but this option softbricks my phone so I can't use it.  Theoretically, it should be as simple as opening the app and pressing the toggle but depending on your luck it may be much more complicated than that.  If you plan on testing it out I highly suggest backing up your ROM beforehand and it is well known to softbrick it if it doesn't work in your configuration."

GoogleCardboard,3dan7l,monstergeek,2,Tue Jul 14 23:21:32 2015 UTC,"so, 5 inch phones should get smaller?"
GoogleCardboard,3dan7l,faduci,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I am no expert, I used it with my S5, that's why I said it depends. I think it's screen size and the quality of the display in addition to the lens size."
GoogleCardboard,3dan7l,monstergeek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:36:24 2015 UTC,"Bigger lenses with the same focal length will usually be better. I have both Cardboard v1 clones with 25mm diameter/45mm FL lenses and Cardboard v2 clones with 34mm diameter/50mm FL lenses. In theory the smaller focal length in v1 should provide a higher FoV, but due to a number of factors (including lens diameter) the FoV in Cardboard v2 subjectively feels larger.  Unless you really need the button, because your phone doesn't support magnets, I'd currently recommend staying away from the TinyDeal Cardboard v1.5 with 25mm lenses or similar versions on AliExpress. I have no idea why these even exist, as is should have been much easier to find a source for larger lenses than finding a way to automatically build the rather complicated Cardboard 2 button."
GoogleCardboard,3dan7l,faduci,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:02:24 2015 UTC,"So, basically, for iPhones and iPods, it's the v2. But for android it's best if it's just the normal one with the magnet button thingy, and bigger diameter = bigger fun? also, i appreciate the response, thanks."
GoogleCardboard,3dan7l,monstergeek,6,Tue Jul 14 23:16:22 2015 UTC,"The iPhones have a compass that can be used with the magnets, the iPod touch available until today doesn't have one, but this may change within the next few hours when the rumored new version is presented. The Cardboard SDK that supports the magnets was only recently released for iOS, so the existing VR apps simply never supported the magnets, even if the hardware would have allowed it. AFAIK the magnets work in the Cardboard app on iPhones, but I couldn't test it with an iPhone, because for some reasons the app isn't available in the German Apple App store.  I tried Cardboard 2 with an iPhone 5s, and interestingly this works better than Cardboard v1, because the small 4"" screen doesn't really work well with the default lens-lens distance in the older version, causing double images. FoV on 4"" iPhones will be smaller in v2, but it will work without modifications. The ""right"" Cardboard is actually a surprisingly difficult question and it mostly depends on screen size:   Cardboard v1 can only hold phones up to about 5.7"", so for larger ones you need v2 or an enlarged v1 clone. Cardboard v2 comes with a cardboard vignette which cuts of parts of the screen for any phone larger than 5.3"". The 25mm lenses in Cardboard v1 have a similar effect. For phones larger than about 5.5"" the magnification in Cardboard v1 is so high that you cannot see the whole screen, so you want something with 50mm FL instead of 45mm FL. In many cases a larger v1 clone with 37mm diameter/50mm FL lenses will work best for larger phones, as v1 has no vignette. For phones about 4"" or smaller the lens-lens distance is too small in Cardboard 1, so you want something with larger lenses, a smaller v1 clone with reduced lens-lens distance or something with adjustable lenses. For phones that have no compass or on which the compass is too far from the magnets, you want a v2 style touch button.   And to make all this more complicated, it also depends on your eyesight, the size of your nose and your IPD (eye-to-eye distance), but the major factor is screen size. You always want to get your eyes close to the lenses to increase the effective FoV, so the larger nose hole in v2 helps, as does enlarging the one in v1. Ideally we would see a number of different Cardboards, all using larger lens diameters, but different magnification/focal length that can be matched to a specific screen size. The current ""one size fits all"" approach doesn't really work that well. Going for average values of 5"" screen size and 64mm IPD was the easiest way to create a very cheap VR viewer, not necessarily the best way."

Sum of average latency plus time to transfer a frame, assuming the available bandwidth is fully used. Assuming the phone can uncompress a stream at 60FPS (could be shorter)   This is just to give you a rough idea where the latency comes from. Some of the numbers are best guesses and there are other factors that cause the real world latency to be higher than the calculated one, I don't know if there are some reliable numbers for measured latency with Trinus VR.  The latency in phones is high to begin with. Streaming from a PC adds to this, and the problem usually isn't the speed of the PC, but the speed of the connection. Phones with USB3 are just coming out, so the limit is either USB 2 with a (purely theoretical) bandwidth of about 480MBit/sec or e.g. Wifi 802.11n with 150MBit/sec. WiFi has a much higher latency, and while all other options (HDMI, LVDS connector) send the image directly from the GPU to the screen, the USB/WiFi bandwidth limit requires extra steps for compression/decompression. Bandwidth is a principal limit, which is why Trinus VR cannot go much above 30FPS @ 720P resolution. You can improve it slightly by using other streaming options like Nvidia's Moonlight (probably due to faster compression) or multi-channel WiFi, but with current technology you will always hit a wall. The best hope for phones is that the dedicated DisplayPort channel that is part of the USB 3.1 definition and capable of streaming 8K video not only allows treaming from phone to PC/display, but also the other way around. This would have enough bandwidth to a) send a decent resolution and b) reduce latency, as the streamed VR app wouldn't nearly saturate it."
GoogleCardboard,3d9w3w,faduci,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:00:11 2015 UTC,Ok wow that's a lot of numbers. But essentially you're saying as phones are now there will always be a bit of lag?
GoogleCardboard,3d9w3w,faduci,3,Tue Jul 14 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. Much of what makes the Oculus Rift/Gear VR so good are all the (extremely clever) tricks Oculus implemented to squeeze latency below 20ms. We will hopefully see something similar in the AndroidVR OS Google is working on, but right now any phone comes with a high latency, even the Note 4/S6 when used without GearVR and the Oculus optimizations. Streaming just makes it a lot worse, which is why e.g. the Gameface, which is basically a HMD with a build in Android phone, comes with a dedicated HDMI input to connect it directly to a graphics card.  How bad this is depends on your sensitivity. The 20ms limit Oculus is aiming for is the latency at which most (but not all) people will no longer notice it or feel sick after some time. But some people can tolerate much higher latencies. I can handle VR apps running at 10FPS and lower without complaints from my stomach, I've seen others that couldn't even handle 60FPS apps in Cardboard. Streaming with Trinus VR currently requires making a number of compromises, and there is no way to really predict how well you'll handle it, you basically have to test it to see what works for you."

Are you using the right IPD?  I developed the app on a 5S, so it should work with your phone, just has to be a setting error.  If your seeing double, that sounds like an IPD problem."

GoogleCardboard,3dbr7s,konstantin_lozev,3,Wed Jul 15 11:07:06 2015 UTC,"""Worst"" is just as ambiguous as ""best"" without a list of requirements to test against. In the end it completely depends on the intended use and if it has to work out of the box. The ColorCross is very uncomfortable without extra padding, but the lens mounts are very useful for modifications. The Ritech II has a miserable FoV for VR and no adjustable lens-screen distance, but works well with glasses and is better out of the box for pure movie watching than all the expensive viewers. A cheap Cardboard clone is still the best device to impress people, because they don't have to hassle with head straps, it is small and compact and can be easily passed around in a group. The fact that it looks very cheap makes the wow effect even bigger, despite the rather low quality.  Like many I am kind of annoyed by the ""What is the best plastic viewer?"" posts, mostly because people don't (want to) see that everything will be a compromise. Depending on their phone, budget, eye sight, intended usage or willingness to modify it the answer will change drastically, but they never specify their priorities, making the question unanswerable beyond ""it depends""."

I'm assuming some others have similar views here.  I have watched a whole 3d SBS movie with the VR Box without discomfort and without the need for my glasses so that's a big plus for me.

It is ridiculous from today's perspective, but that is what was available then for experimenting. Now I have advanced that into a fully modded 20 EUR ColorCross that can hold a Kindle Fire HDX and while ergonomics are not really good, the screen-door effect is much, much less noticeable than DK1 or DK2 even. I learned a lot during that time about the do's and and mostly about the don'ts of VR. I have another ColorCross that I plan to mod for my Galaxy S4, maybe even with the famous lenses from the MTBS3D forums that you linked.

GoogleCardboard,3d8835,karstux,2,Tue Jul 14 07:21:52 2015 UTC,"Today I recieved my VRIZZMO from Amazon. It is the red one without the black front panel. Well first the good thing: the FOV is definatly a step forward in comparison to the colorcross HMD. I tried a few videos and games and everything feels more like VR should be (again in comparison to colorcross).  Now the bad part: this HMD is extremly uncomfortable. Even on the lowest strap setting it gives a lot of pressure to the face. The small foam doesn't help a lot. After 1 minute it started to hurt and I had red marks on my face. No way you can use this for more then 10 minutes to play a game or watch a video. The 2nd annoying thing is to mount the phone in the HMD. There is a plastic part which holds the phone in place and it has some foam on the inside. It's pretty dificult to get your phone in there because it's very tight and the foam makes it hard to slide it in. Also you have to adjust the phone position while it's inside to get a clear image.  Light bleeding is there but not as much as I expected (but I tested it in a darker room) but still to much to enjoy a good VR session.  In comparison to my colorcross I think I like the colorcross better, because even if this one is also uncomfortable it isn't as bad as the VRIZZMO. The FOV is the only plus but the pain in the face isn't worth it.  I will send this one back and order a freefly VR instead. Hopefully this one is better, but as far as it sounds in other threads it seems to be much much better."
GoogleCardboard,3d8835,5kyNet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:04:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this review. I canceled my order for it right after reading this :) The bad FOV and the reflecting plastic is too bad. Why do they all use mirroring plastic inside?  How is the FOV compared to a regular cardboard one? Do you have a Homido HMD and can compare them?  I don't understand why there isn't any really usefull cardboard HMD with a decent FOV and good build quality. I'm willing to pay a good one but it seems that all are just as crappy as the chinese ones (like colorcross).  EDIT: Damn, Amazon wasn't able to cancel the order anymore. So I guess I will give it a little try and send it back if it's bad."
GoogleCardboard,3d8835,5kyNet,2,Tue Jul 14 08:53:01 2015 UTC,"The FoV is significantly larger than in both Cardboard 1 and 2. Objectively comparing FoV has turned out to be much harder than I expected, which is one of several reasons while a number of VR viewers are currently stuck in my review queue. But it is without doubt an improvement over Cardboard, and the image quality of the stacked lens configuration is way better.  All in all I agree with many of the points mentioned by karstux, but my conclusion is different, esp. concerning the FoV. Partly because a) for me FoV numbers are the new megapixels/megahertz, the primary value is marketing (I have argued that for now using the wearality lenses makes no sense), and b) bigger isn't necessarily better. You pay a price for a higher FoV, and if Oculus went for 90° FoV in the DK2 after 100° FoV in the DK1, it is safe to assume that this was not an accident. So the important factor for me is the improvement in image quality, reduced distortions and actually larger (and ""big enough"") FoV, I don't really care if it matches a certain number.  I have the smaller (and lighter) version for phones up to 5.7"". It weights 416g, which is heavy, but this is partly due to the maxi sized head straps. The vignette is similar to Cardboard 2 and means that on phones larger than 5.3"" parts of the screen become invisible. For me the buttons work, but they aren't very ergonomic, the area you press on is rather small.  The mirror polish is indeed a major fuck-up. Interestingly the sides are covered with a kind of light absorbing cloth on the inside, but the area surrounding the lenses reflects like hell, which is very irritating when used in a bright room. It can be fixed with a piece of black cardboard, but it is an astonishing design flaw, esp. as they solved the problem pretty well on the sides. All in all the open construction leads to a lot of light bleeding.  My main problem with it is the smell: I can stomach pretty much everything in VR, but am extremely sensitive to all smells (not just chemicals, also food). A friend of mine who was visiting during the unboxing mentioned that she actually liked the smell (printer ink), but currently I can only use it for short bursts during tests before the smell makes me feel sick. Most of the times the Vrizzmo is banned to another room close to an open window. I've had it for a few weeks, the smell is getting better and hopefully by the time I get my act together sufficiently to write a review, it will be compatible with my squeamish olfactory system."
GoogleCardboard,3d8835,faduci,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:31:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting how the FOV perception varies from person to person. I definitely did not notice an improvement over the Cardboard v2. Because of the small inner lenses, I actually felt more constrained in that regard. I wish there were a more objective way to measure it than guesstimating.  No argument regarding image quality, the lens stack is very good at reducing distortion and chromatic aberration artifacts.  At the current state of the technology, I don't feel that FoV is ""the new megahertz"". If I were to extend the metaphor, I'd say that 90-100 degrees is equivalent to the 486DX-66 - where every small increase is still a hugely perceptible improvement. As a developer myself, I don't think that the added rendering workload of 150+ deg can't be managed with today's mobile phones, you just need to budget the complexity accordingly. Heck, I remember playing with the FOV cvar in Quake 2, all those years ago, setting it as high as it would go. No performance problems then, and today's mobile GPUs are far more powerful than my yesteryear's Voodoo2... but I'm digressing, sorry.  The smell, I kind of liked it. Smelled ""new"" to me, but not enough to notice in either a good or a bad way.  So do the capacitative lever buttons work for you? I found them unreliable at best."
GoogleCardboard,3d8835,5kyNet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:59:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't have them side-by-side so can't compare directly, but the FoV seems a little better on my IAMCARDBOARD v2.  Yeah, the state of plastic cardboards right now is a pretty sad affair. The chinese ones don't offer good FOV, the good ones are pretty expensive, and near all have an input deficiency problem.  If you don't mind the missing input, and don't wear glasses, I can recommend the FreeFly VR. It's light, comfortable, has a really good phone locking and centering mechanism, and has a decent FOV (not sure if it's really 120 degrees, but it's good). And right now you can get a pretty good discount. I bought one, but unfortunately it's useless to me as it doesn't fit over glasses (didn't realise that until I received it). :-( And it does look somewhat goofy.  Right now, I think I'll wait for the OSVR phone holder faceplate. That should open up a lot of possibilities - they will offer Wearality 140 deg FOV lenses, and probably Lighthouse tracking."

GoogleCardboard,3d8835,rushmore69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:51:04 2015 UTC,"Jeepers, unless the device has a 4k display, 120 and 140 FOV would have massive SDE and look rough.  The Freely is close to or the same FOV as the Note 4 Gear VR, so 96 to 98 FOV.  That is IMO already too much and should be no more than 90 degrees to reduce FOV and still be fairly immersive.  JMO."

There are a couple of other SDKs available from other providers, but by now the Google Cardboard SDK is the most advanced and the only one that allows adjusting viewer settings like FoV and lens-lens distance, important to get VR software to work with the increasing variety of viewers. There are also VR specific assets like No Touch GUI for VR available for Unity, which can speed up VR development. The Unity Asset Store in general is an invaluable source with tons of free and cheap packages that can help, esp. someone new to Unity.  And with the release of Unity 5 a lot of important features like occlusion culling, level of detail and an improved profiler that help with keeping performance high, and render-to-texture, (most likely still) required for lens distortion correction, are now available in the free version too. As VR is quite demanding performance-wise, these features help a lot, so this removed another argument against using Unity. Previously they were only available in Unity Pro, causing license costs of USD 4,500 for Unity 4 Pro plus the Android and iOS Pro plugins. These costs still apply if you generate more than USD 100K in revenue per year, no matter with what."

GoogleCardboard,3d5rox,faduci,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"I assume that you are talking about 360° video. With a  rough estimate from YouTube videos I'd say you'd need a 12800 × 4320 video to prevent any upscaling on the S6, so both your test images (16:9, so 3200 × 1800 and 1920 × 1080?) would still appear rather low res. It wouldn't explain why there is no visible difference between them.  You could try some of the high quality 360° videos provided by the European Southern Observatory for dome projection with up to 8192 × 8192. They provide multiple resolutions, at least the lower ones work in VR Player, so they could be used for comparing image quality at close(r) to native resolution."

These occur with increasing frequency, as many advertising  departments have discovered Cardboard as a cool and very cheap gadget for marketing. It is to be expected that a lot more movies will be promoted with 360° YouTube videos or dedicated VR apps in the future. Many of these promotions have been posted about on /r/GoogleCardboard, so checking from time to time might help. Cardboard v1 clone for USD 1.56 from Aliexpress. These have a lens-lens distance of 61mm and work best with phones smaller than 5"" and/or if your IPD (eye-eye distance) is lower than the average 64mm. Cardboard v1 clone for USD 2.79 from Tinydeal. These have a lens-lens distance of 66mm, work better for larger phones or IPD and also have a slightly better build quality.   All three options will come with a rather long waiting time. There are other options, but prices below USD 3 should be affordable even for a broke VR loving student. If you are so broke that you are actually starving, I cannot recommend VR anyway, as the primitive state of mobile VR can induce nausea, and you don't want to throw up whatever food you could afford."

Unofficial Cardboard costs the same, still only taking preorders. DODOCase is even more expensive and will ship four weeks after you've ordered. TinyDeal offers a cheap pseudo Cardboard 2.0, which features the button, but not the 37mm lenses. Instead it uses the same 25mm lenses as Cardboard 1. Similar ""fakes"" are available on other sites like AliExpress, and the offers are confusing, because they use some pictures of actual Cardboard 2.0 clones with large lenses. I'd stay away from these, they basically sell to people who want a cheap v2 and don't realize that these only look similar, but aren't the same. They may actually turn out to be usable for smaller phones, because the magnification in v1 lenses is higher than in v2, but no one has reviewed one yet.   Not sure if there are any other sources, but pretty sure that there is no cheap source for good Cardboard 2.0 clones yet."

GoogleCardboard,3d500d,phemark,2,Mon Jul 13 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"When you look straight through the center of the lens, the distance between lens and screen measured along the optical axis is shorter than if you look slightly to the side. So if the sides are in focus, but the center is not, then the focal length of the lenses is too short for your eyes. The easiest way to fix this is to increase the lens-screen distance by adding a little spacer, e.g. a folded piece of cardboard fixed on the front side of the optical divider in Cardboard 1 or  four small patches of cardboard in the corners of Cardboard 2, in each case moving the screen a little further away. You should be able to test this by not closing the flap and instead moving the phone back and forward until you get a clear image.  If everything is zoomed in too far, you would actually want to decrease the FoV/magnification. Most users have the opposite problem: they see the edges of the screen and/or parts of Cardboard, so the image doesn't fill the field of view provided by the lenses. You didn't write which version of Cardboard and which phone you are using, but usually a ""too high"" FoV occurs with a phone > 5.7"" and Cardboard 1, which user 5.6x/45mm focal length lenses, preventing the whole screen from being visible. One option is to switch to Cardboard 2 with 5x/50mm FL lenses, but this cuts of parts of the screen too. So an important question is what exactly you are using and if you are usually wearing glasses.  In general changing the FoV requires swapping the lenses to a pair with different focal length, which also requires altering the lens-screen distance. Effective FoV is also influenced by screen size, eye-lens distance and lens diameter, but only as limiting factors that can reduce the max FoV the lenses could deliver.  EDIT: I just realized that you posted in another thread that you are using a 5"" Asus Padfone S. This makes it pretty unlikely that FoV/magnification is too high. Could you give a more detailed description of what you are actually seeing?"

GoogleCardboard,3d5pem,Rhasaar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"First some terminology:   A side-by-side video is a 2D video that shows two images next to each other, no matter where you play it. Watched in Cardboard, you should always see a stereoscopic image, i.e. there is depth information. An example: Five interesting Virtual Reality experiments demos from Tore Knabe  A 360° VR video is recorded with a special camera, so the image is actually a sphere, projected into a rectangle. If you watch one with e.g. the Chrome browser on Windows/OSX, the player detects that this is a 360° video and lets you change the camera rotation angle with the mouse. If you call the same video with the YouTube app on Android or iOS, it lets you move the camera by moving the phone around, but this requires a gyroscope in the phone. I don't know if there is an option to move the camera by dragging with a finger instead. An example: Nike Hypervenom II - The Neymar Jr. Effect, A Virtual Reality Experience The Android YouTube app has a special feature that is available neither on iOS (yet) nor in a desktop browser. If a 360° video is running, a small Cardboard icon in the lower right corner allows switching the view into a fake-stereoscopic mode. Fake because only one image was recorded, the images shown to the eyes are only moved slightly sideways, there is no depth information in the video. The icon will only show if it already plays as a 360° video, so if this depends on the presence of a gyro sensor, it will not work on a phone without one.   The LG Stylo has accelerometers, but these are not enough, you need a gyroscope. You should still be able to see all SBS videos, but 360° videos will not allow moving the camera or switching to stereoscopic Cardboard mode. So my guess is that by    Youtube turns every single side-by-side video into a mono video. Automatically or something too, because I can watch them side-by-side on my computer.   you actually mean  Youtube turns every single 360° video into a mono video. Automatically or something too, because I can watch them with camera movement on my computer.  This would be expected behavior on your phone, no way to work around it without the required sensor."
GoogleCardboard,3d5pem,faduci,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the information, but I think I may not be making myself clear.  I can watch the 360 video just fine. it turns when I drag my finger around. What I can NOT do is watch it on the google cardboard, because it fails to split the video into a side by side presentation. No phone, no matter how many gyros, can view a single image video on a cardboard. It must show a video for each eye.  Youtube on the LG Stylo simply does not do this. Not on 360 videos, and not on normal stereoscopic videos. It shows one image. Which is particularly baffling when it shows two images on my desktop. It literally combines them into one center image when played on the youtube app. Bizarre.  As an example, your second example video, with the picture of the google cardboard on it, does not work on the cardboard. It has no option to switch to 3D mode. This is of course the case whether or not I can turn the phone to move the image."

Usually the flatter side of the lenses should face the eyes, otherwise the image will get very distorted, and having the lenses facing in the wrong direction is one of the major of bad images with Cardboard 1. Cardboard 2 was supposed to fix this by having the lenses preassembled, which of course only works if they don't mess it up in production.  Usually the different parts of Cardboard 2 are connected with double sided adhesive tape and it is actually possible to separate them by very carefully lifting them with a knife placed between the cardboard layers. I haven't tried to take out the lenses out of one yet, so I cannot tell how well this would actually work."

GoogleCardboard,3d1qo6,fonzitheman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"I couldnt find any magnifying glasses locally,not any that would allow easy removal of the lenses anyway. So I bought cheap magnifying sheet. Cut it into sizes needed and tried that. It kinda worked in that the plastic ones have those fine lines in it so not the best,need to get glass ones I think so will try ebay. FoV was larger though. Also the sheet I tried was 3x magification. I noticed this time I had to pull the focal adjuster all the way in and the pic clarity seemed OK.Without it I have to adjust it all the way out and pic still not clear. So if I got lenses with 5x magification wouldnt it be worse for pic clarity cause with 3x as I said I had to adjust it all the way close."

After winning some rewards for the innovative UI concept, Google acquired it, so hopefully there will be a full release for Cardboard in the future. The currently available Tilt Brush Gallery for Android shown in the video allows looking at VR images painted in the original Tilt Brush, an interesting experience by itself.""

It's the one with the green title that says: ""basic Cardboard questions and answers"".    The answer to your question is under the following question on that page. It's about one scroll's length down screen on a computer, or about a tenth of the page down on mobile:    ""What is the cheapest (used from ebay) phone that works?""                   VR is very demanding, so you need a rather powerful phone, the larger and faster, the better. You can try VR on existing, older phones, but the experience will be rather limited. Search for comments on a model before buying. Some examples: Samsung Galaxy S2, 4.3"" @ 800 * 480, ~ USD 45, can run some older software. Samsung Galaxy Nexus, 4.65"" @ 1280 * 720, ~ USD 65, this is the slowest phone officially supported, cannot run many newer VR applications. LG G2, 5.2"" @ 1920 * 1080, ~ USD 140, will run all current software with good quality, consider this as the best entry option, below it the experience will be a lot worse. LG G3, 5.3"" @ 2560 * 1440, ~ USD 270, will significantly reduce seeing single pixels.                   https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/39t5tl/7000_subscribers_extra_basic_cardboard_questions/"

GoogleCardboard,3cxtlg,Strongpillow,5,Sat Jul 11 20:08:41 2015 UTC,"I have a generic ""big phone"" cardboard and a zmax.  You're going to have a bad time.  Firstly, The zmax doesn't have a gyro. This WILL drive you insane.  Also, the flap that keeps my cardboard closed always presses the power button on the zmax.  ALSO also, the zmax is only 720p, and the screen door effect is very very noticeable on mine.  I have since switched to my wifes note 4 and it's night/day, now I want a nicer cardboard.  On an unrelated note, tmo dropped the trade value of the zmax from 90 and change to one dollar.  Zmax knocks the socks off of basically everything for battery life though."

Probably because I also one a OnePlus One so it fits better, but the build quality is spectacular for the OnePlus Cardboard.   There is a thin film that covers the forehead area that prevents oils from soaking into it. The cardboard cuts are very sharp and precise. This thing feels like it's machine made. The trigger on the top right is f****** brilliant. It came already built with a little bit of packaging around it to protect and for easily able to slide it in and out.   Conardboard feels too stiff and kinda hurts my face using it. NOT GLASSES COMPATIBLE. Uses Cardboard V1 specs I think. Putting it together was a fun little puzzle though."

GoogleCardboard,3cskyj,sbozzie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:58:20 2015 UTC,Could the responsive foam stuff be lightly taping your screen? Maybe you can try and trim it down a bit. My phone (galaxy s6 edge) gets really hot using cardboard apps aswell. I'm assuming it's because the phone is trying to do so many operations at once and I think it's normal for most people.
GoogleCardboard,3cskyj,lost_in_thesauce,2,Fri Jul 10 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"I get the same effect if the phone is outside of the case as well - It seems to be picking something up as a touch, but I can't work out what.

GoogleCardboard,3cskyj,lost_in_thesauce,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:08:02 2015 UTC,"Is your phone in a case? If it is, try taking off the case. Maybe it's picking up something from the case.

GoogleCardboard,3cskyj,In_Film,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"Some further investigation: the youtube app seems to suffer from the same issues - when a 360 video is opened, I see a white circle with blue glow in the middle of the screen.  As I enter full screen mode, this white circle moves to the bottom left, and appears to be like someone hammering a touch on the screen. This is resulting in the seek bar being repeatedly triggered, and the phone locks up as a result."
GoogleCardboard,3cskyj,smdol,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:48:50 2015 UTC,What happens if you take your phone outside of the cardboard viewer? If it's still wonky outside the viewer then there's an issue with your phone.   If it only happens inside the viewer then something is touching your phone screen while it's inside.

There's no way to make selections in game,which is quite annoying.  I mean I could go on, but it's a solid piece of equipment for the price. I would advise anyone in the market for a headset to save their money for a better one.  But compared to just having the cardboard, being able to adjust the lenses and have it attached to my head is a nice change.   In my opinion, if you own a Note 4 or S6 and you buy a headset like this, you're doing yourself an indecency. Just save your nickels and dimes and buy a GearVR.  Using this is just a tease"

GoogleCardboard,3cpza2,faduci,2,Fri Jul 10 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"Just got mine. While the FoV is miserable, the construction itself is interesting, as the whole phone holding tray/cover/optical divider is only screwed in, so it should be possible to shorten the case by at least 15mm without losing any functionality or requiring a lot of rebuilding. The lens-mounts are about the right size to simply tape cheap credit card sized Fresnel magnifiers to their back, allowing for a simple lens setup.

GoogleCardboard,3csty6,redskins78,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:19:43 2015 UTC,in the latest android OS the webview is updated as any other app. You are generally using the same as the latest chrome. So it should work pretty well.  The only thing is that the shader used to produce the double image does not deform the render to take into account lens deformation. Or something like that. I read about it and tried some simple experiments a few months ago with good results.

Using the phone also allowed for it to work while not facing the sensor bar, which is a must have feature for a system like this. It has it's downsides, but overall the phone is a better choice."
GoogleCardboard,3copi1,konstantin_lozev,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:30:18 2015 UTC,"Cool, good job once more. On the wiimote, if you have wiimote-plus, you can use it facing any direction based on the built in gyro and accelerometer. It is possible to make the wiimote control the view only when you are holding a button, but this is useful when the game has ADS. You can still use it in Portal to fine tune your aim, but it can be a bit nauseating."

GoogleCardboard,3cnkmv,hessian_tank,2,Thu Jul 9 16:55:20 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I usually do the whole area I'm facing - up/down/left/right. Then, I take a step or so around my camera and capture the next area. It sounds like you make a big horizontal circle and then try to fill in the top and bottom. Maybe that's common, but it's not how I do it."
GoogleCardboard,3cnkmv,yneos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:06:11 2015 UTC,I'll try that.  I just got my cardboard.  What app do you use to view the photosphere image with the cardboard?   The headtracking works for me but it's showing a full image so it looks weird through the lens
GoogleCardboard,3cnkmv,hessian_tank,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:08:46 2015 UTC,"In the cardboard app had a photosphere option, but I know my buddy's iPhone doesn't have the option."
GoogleCardboard,3cnkmv,Gremmward,0,Fri Jul 10 19:25:43 2015 UTC,"When you go to the next row, move your upper body, not just your head and the camera.   Turn with your waist and use your back when you're taking a shot higher up... Don't just flip your wrist with the phone in hand.   I lock my wrists and shoulders in place and turn my upper body."
GoogleCardboard,3cnkmv,yneos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:03:10 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the recommendation is to keep the camera in the same location while you move around it.
GoogleCardboard,3cnkmv,yneos,2,Thu Jul 9 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"Keep the camera in the same spot. Move your body around it and move the camera's angle, but keep the camera in the same basic spot. Use portrait orientation. Small spaces like rooms don't stitch well. Google Cardboard usually displays mine perfectly (even if they have a black incomplete spot), but Gear VR only likes a few of my photospheres. One of the Gear VR apps doesn't detect a lot of the photospheres. Another app recognizes them all, but crashes on many of them."

Have you stacked the new lenses on top of the old ones? Or replaced them entirely? I want to try and remove the old lenses but they're proving tricky to get out. Wondering if there's a layer of glue holding them in aswell as the plastic tabs?
GoogleCardboard,3cla4q,wookiehowk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:05:09 2015 UTC,"Unless it is supported by the specific cardboard app itself, no. Are you talking of a gyro mouse strapped to the top of your headphones? In any event, you can still try to play PC games with TrinusVR without the phone's gyro using a gyro mouse, or even a normal mouse connected to your computer. It won't be the best experience, but you will get a taste of VR at least."

I don't know what kind of phone or what resolution screen you have, but keep in mind that you're using magnifying lenses to view the screen.  Pixels are going to be visible.

GoogleCardboard,3cjm3e,digitreal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"Isn't this what Body Swap does? The app only works on the same wifi network atm. But, the developer is working on internet functionality (iirc, he's thinking about adding NAT traversal by using a TURN server due to issues with firewalls). Once that's finished, it seems to be exactly what you were thinking of doing.  In regards to the 3D, you could always go with fake 3D. Apart from the HTC Evo 3D and LG Optimus 3D (both released in 2011), there aren't many phones with 3D cameras. You could possibly use HTC's Dual Lens SDK (for the M8) to work out depth and, so, create a 3D image. But, that approach might add too much lag into the equation. I suppose that doesn't really matter if you don't want to add head tracking.  The webcam approach is probably the easiest. It would be best to make a 3D webcam using two HD cameras. Otherwise, you'll be limited to something like the Minoru which has a pretty poor resolution.  Apart from that, most AR Cardboard apps (e.g. Glitcher VR, Cmoar AR, VR AR) aren't multiplayer. They're all limited to a single user."

The magnetic trigger doesn't work for me though. I also have the Dodo Case Virtual Reality Kit but it caused some eye strain and wasn't as comfortable. It's also a huge pain to put together and I could never get the trigger button (which is an earlier version of the V2 cardboard button) to work. I ended up modding the Mi3D with these lenses (http://www.amazon.com/MAGNIFIER-Drafting-Engineering-General-Catalog/dp/B004IMFSUS/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1436389176&sr=8-2&keywords=optix+7x+magnifier) They give a slightly better FOV and you don't see the edges of the lenses since these are 35mm in diameter.

GoogleCardboard,3chx18,Marr_Mar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:15:40 2015 UTC,"I guess? It's likely not what you want. 75mm out, the image from your phone will be a lot smaller (i.e. lower FOV) than the 40mm Cardboard v1 standard. You could probably stack two 75mm lenses and get a focal length slightly shorter than 40mm, but unless you happen to have a pile of 75mm lenses already I'm not sure why you'd use them instead of what you want in the first place.  edit: added FOV parenthetical"

I just want to say, I got a I Am Cardboard V2 headset a few days ago and I think head tracking adds a lot to the VR experience.  Thing is, my T-Mobile Galaxy S4 has a piece of shit uncalibrated gyroscope.  I get very bad drift in most everything I try.  I'm aware that it's a fault of this phone's hardware and never give poor ratings due to drift since I'm aware it's not really the app developers fault.  Many people don't understand this from what I've seen and they'll rate the app poorly.  Titans of Space is one of the few I've tried where drift is almost nonexistent.  They say they use a newer Google SDK that includes better drift correction, so perhaps that would be helpful?  I'm not a programmer so I don't really know,  I just know that Titans was pretty nice and almost no drift for me.  Edit:  I've discovered an app, ""ball compass"".  I did all the calibrations and it mostly got rid of drift.  Then if I leave the app running and start a VR app, put the phone down on it's back and leave it for about 20 seconds.  Drift totally eliminated!  It's made my experience with cardboard so much better!  Just putting this out there in case it can help someone else."

The one suggested by Infligo is actually included with some head mounts like the Freefly. So I'd say it is a safe bet for mobile VR.  And as for TrinusVR, yes you will be able to play your PC games in VR with it. I highly recommend trying the free version first to make sure it works for you (the app is still under development). It can be a bit tricky to setup, so it is best to read the help and use the forums in case of trouble.  This free version of TrinusVR is limited to about 10mins per session, but upcoming release (very soon!) will have extended playtime. I'm the dev, btw :)"

GoogleCardboard,3cajwt,mptp,3,Mon Jul 6 11:53:26 2015 UTC,"I've used a fair few plastic cardboards. I've not used the Homido specifically. My personal favourite of what I've tried so far (I have like 5 different kickstarter headsets coming in over the next few months) is the Zeiss VR One.  In general, they're quite a bit better than Cardboard, and utter shit compared to the DK2 and Gear VR. The headtracking latency on my Galaxy S5 is somewhere between 70 and 120ms, compared to the 20ms necessary for presence. Not to mention the mediocre distortion correction, low latency and drift. It's still VR, and therefore awesome, but it's definitely not comparable to a serious HMD.  But if you don't want to shell out for a DK2 or Gear VR, something like a Homido / Zeiss VR One is a good choice."
GoogleCardboard,3cajwt,mptp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:15:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the breakdown. I was expecting something to the extend of what you said. As a developer I think a laying down on your back and looking up, might be the best experience with these HMDs until latency improves.   What was your best sense of presence with the mobile HMDs? VR Movies, Rollercoaster, starring at the night sky type demos?"
GoogleCardboard,3cajwt,rushmore69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:32:46 2015 UTC,"I've never experienced anything close to presence using Cardboard-like devices.  My best presence was a demo where I had a DK2 running off a laptop in my backpack, and a large tracking volume that I could walk around with, with a similarly tracked gun peripheral.  After that, Elite:Dangerous on DK2 with HOTAS for long periods is probably as good as I've gotten."
GoogleCardboard,3cajwt,rushmore69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:36:25 2015 UTC,"If your phone display is bigger than 5"" you will have cut-off since the view portal is really designed for the iPhone 6.  A reason Homido has a good browser app for the iPhone, but not Android.  The focus has mainly been the iPhone and it's 4.7"" display, which the portal fits perfectly."
GoogleCardboard,3c7zx9,MengKongRui,5,Sun Jul 5 19:27:11 2015 UTC,"One way to get a bigger field of view would be to have the lenses closer to your eyes. You could see this by taking the lenses out of the cardboard, laying your phone on a table with a VR app open and holding one lens in each hand as close as possible to your eyes and leaning over so that the lenses are about 45mm distance from your phone.   If that would be satisfactory you could probably just cut out a bigger nose opening which would make it possible for you to hold the lenses while in the cardboard closer to your eyes.   Bigger diameter lenses could be an option, but since they would probably have the same focal length as the current lenses you have you'd only benefit from them if you can't see the edges of your screen through the current lenses. Otherwise you would just fill the extra FOV with the edges of your phone where there's no screen which would be useless. If that's the case you would also need stronger lenses (shorter focal length) in order to have a bigger magnification to still fill that extra FOV with screen space, but that would also require your phone to be placed closer to the lenses and you'll need to modify your cardboard even more.   If still you want bigger diameter lenses: looking at Ebay there are some cheap 37mm diameter 45mm focal length lenses that are specifically targeted for use with a Google Cardboard. Although shipping takes a while those are probably the best value for money larger lenses you could get. Not optically as good as Edmund Optics, but probably still really good for use in a google cardboard.  But remember that a wider field of view will always be at the cost of image quality. You'll spread out the pixels over a wider field of view resulting in less pixels per degree so the image will appear more pixellated to your eyes. Also if you'd use stronger lenses to get a wider FOV you'll get more comatic abberation and more field curvature, resulting in a lesser quality image."

GoogleCardboard,3c56ft,OldBeforeHisTime,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:08:55 2015 UTC,"I don't have a lot of optical knowledge so I might have gotten some things wrong, but as far as I know:  You can add your prescription lens strength to a 45mm lens by this formula: 1/f=1/f1+1/f2  Assuming both lenses would be thin lenses and the are in direct contact with each other, so this would simulate the combined lens strengths when wearing glasses under a Google Cardboard.   The -1.75 diopter can be converted to a focal length in mm like this, which would give you 1000 / -1.75 ≈ -571mm focal length.  Putting that in the formula adding it with a 45mm lens gives you a combined focal length of: 1 / ((1/45)+(1/-571)) ≈ 48.85mm.  So for a person without a spherical prescription they would be able to see the an image placed at 45mm distance from a 45mm lens sharp.  You will need that image placed at 45mm distance from the lens but using a 48.85mm lens to see it sharp.   Although I think it would be a lot cheaper for you to just use 45mm lenses and place your phone closer to the lenses. By using the formula the other way around you get: 1 / ((1/45)+(1/-571)) ≈ 41.71mm.   So if you already have a 45mm focal length lens try holding it at 41.71mm from your phone screen (or a bit closer, 40mm would probably be just as fine too) and see if it's relaxing for you to look at and if you can see everything sharp. If that's the case, find a way to modify a Google Cardboard so that your phone screen is located at that distance from the lenses."

GoogleCardboard,3c0pte,DrLetharga,5,Fri Jul 3 18:28:21 2015 UTC,"By now I have kind of accepted that people simply refuse to believe that there are currently no cheap VR viewers with a FoV better than Cardboard, let alone 100°, no matter how many threads and FAQs there are. So here we go:  The first is a Baofeng Mirror/Storm II, the second a VR BOX, the third another movie viewer sold under lots of names, I don't know the manufacturer. They all have a lower FoV (around 55°) than Cardboard (about 80°) and are available cheaper elsewhere. Pretty much any crappy movie viewer is sold with the Sunnypeak or Destek label, as these are all sold on Alibaba to OEMs for cheap. Of these three, the Baofeng Storm II is the most comfortable for watching movies.  The VR BOX is the newest and was what many of us were hoping for due to the claim for a high FoV. I'm still waiting for one, but by now several reviews have been posted on /r/GoogleCardboard, and it seems they simply lied about the FoV. So unless you are willing to alter the lenses and the screen-lens distance, all of them are bad for VR. Use the search function with their original names to find bad reviews for all of them."
GoogleCardboard,3c0pte,faduci,2,Fri Jul 3 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I had not seen that post from the sticky until you posted it.  This is what I was afraid of.  I'll likely just hold out until I can purchase something better."
GoogleCardboard,3c0pte,konstantin_lozev,2,Fri Jul 3 20:09:12 2015 UTC,"What about durovis dive? I bought some time ago the open dive lens kit and it is similar to cardboard's, but now I see they have ""better"" lenses on their website."
GoogleCardboard,3c0pte,faduci,2,Fri Jul 3 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"The ""better"" lenses have a 32mm diameter, compared to 25mm for the original lenses, but as they are intended as an upgrade for the Dive 5, they cannot have a different focal length. I bought the Open Dive Lens kit for my early Cardboard attempts, because it was recommended for DIY by Google. It uses the same 45mm FL lenses as Cardboard, resulting in the same FoV of up to 80°. They use slightly better asymmetric biconvex lenses than e.g. the TinyDeal clones, but this helps mostly with reducing the distortions.  The Durovis lenses weren't exactly high end to begin with. As I started building Cardboard before clones became available, I've bought a lot of different lenses for testing, including a number of cheap magnifying glasses. It turns out that these ones for USD 0.44 use exactly the same lenses as Durovis provided in their lens kit.  Larger lenses with the same FL can actually help with the FoV, as the FoV depends on a number of factors, one of them being a limitation due to the keyhole effect caused by a large eye-lens distance and a small lens diameter. So the larger lens doesn't increase the FoV, it just prevents that the FoV is reduced below what would be possible with lenses of that particular FL. Which is why the FoV is subjectively larger in Cardboard 2 despite using a lower magnification."
GoogleCardboard,3c0pte,BigBadP,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:39:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the VR BOX was a let down.  The build quality is really good, the thing is by far the most comfortable.  Unfortunatly, the FOV is bloody awful.  You can move the lenses forward, back, and side to side, but the FOV is just so bad.  I was going to try and stack lenses, but apparently the ones it comes with are even larger than the colorcross/X360 ones."

However, the FOV is pretty low (~55ish degree with my G3), and it is very uncomfortable. The padding you see in the picture is actually not foam but rubber that digs into your face, and there's absolutely no padding the nose area.   I had to buy some foam and stick it on it to make it usable for more than 5 minutes. It's pretty good for movie watching, but not much other than that."
GoogleCardboard,3c18yb,MrMidgie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:56:52 2015 UTC,"Short remark: Unity (used for most apps developed for both Cardboard and GearVR) changed the handling of gamepads after Unity 4.2.2. Since then only buttons with keycodes below 20 are accessible, rendering e.g. the Snakebyte idroid:con bluetooth controller initially recommended for VR apps and many other controllers only partially supported. Unfortunately none of the remapping assets available from the Unity asset store solve this, as it would require a dedicated plugin for Android to work around this restriction in Unity. As the three buttons on the controller returned keycodes from 102 - 104, they will be unusable for Unity developers."

GoogleCardboard,3bxxd6,knalpot,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:54:14 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you intend to do this, but in a case of doubt use the smaller lenses. I'd suggest cutting two 50mm/60mm cardboard circles and actually trying how well this would work within the Ritech.  I added a pair of cheap 37mm dia/32mm FL(6.25x) lenses to the Ritech I by simply placing them in the existing lens holders from the front and fixing them there with some tape. After reducing the screen-lens distance, this worked acceptably, but the distortions around the edges are very bad. With the lens holders moved close together, there is only a 22mm distance between the lenses, so 60mm lenses would basically touch. That is bad, considering that you need some space for your nose between them. Larger lenses help against the keyhole effect up to a certain point, but beyond 40mm diameter the disadvantages are probably bigger. You won't see an increase in FoV when using the same magnification, but the lenses have to become thicker, adding more distortions, and heavier."

GoogleCardboard,3bxwgl,neverbetterthanlate,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:05:34 2015 UTC,It's a ski-goggle style elastic strap. It only clips onto the sides of the viewer. Three-point attachment systems are the same with an additional strap that goes over the top of the head. Not sure if I'm understanding your issue correctly. Does the Cardboard viewer not have places on the sides to clip onto? You could just carve a bit out if that is the case.

GoogleCardboard,3bvd89,neverbetterthanlate,3,Fri Jul 3 02:40:52 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear, IMHO.   Unless specified, a cardboard Cardboard is going to be a V1. They're generally fine, the magnet might be finicky or not work with your phone, the FOV is OK.   If you order a Cardboard V2, you'll maybe get a slightly improved FOV (Larger lenses, but longer focal length). The capacitive button should work reliably. It fits larger phones.  Buy a v2 Cardboard. iamcardboard seems to be reliable, shipping-wise. People make this a lot harder than it is, and there isn't a perfect item out there to buy, there are always trade-offs.

GoogleCardboard,3buevv,Milenko2121,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:09:05 2015 UTC,"/u/faduci has a review which includes modding this viewer with magnifying glasses here  Short answer, The Xiaozhai and basically all Chinese plastic viewers are designed for movie watching, and have a smaller FOV than Cardboard v1. This looks sharper as the pixels are less magnified. Add in some generic magnifying glasses to your viewer and you'll get an increased FOV at the expense of clarity (and since it'll be jury-rigged, possibly more clarity than strictly necessary).  edit: capitalization"
GoogleCardboard,3buevv,neverbetterthanlate,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:21:44 2015 UTC,"I messaged him about it already, and I don't want to stack lenses. So I think I'll buy the 34mm 50FL lens and see how it goes. I use an S4 active with 1080p screen so I'm not too worried about pixelization."
GoogleCardboard,3buevv,neverbetterthanlate,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:11:11 2015 UTC,"Changing the focal length is going to require modding the case to move the phone to match, and does not by itself increase FOV. You want higher magnification and/or larger diameter and/or moving the lens and phone closer to your eyes.  Edit: I was wrong — reducing the FL will effectively magnify the phone screen, but you still need to mod the case the get the phone closer so it is in focus."
GoogleCardboard,3buevv,frogduck1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:46:59 2015 UTC,That's some interesting conversation in that post. So should i grab some magnifying glasses or just a pair of really strong reading glasses? Kind of got lost towards the end of the conversation :(

GoogleCardboard,3buevv,frogduck1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:09:48 2015 UTC,"Will do, although I haven't received my set and I ordered a VR Box (was assuming same principles would apply)."
GoogleCardboard,3buevv,faduci,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:46:01 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that neither reading nor magnifying glasses are a great choice. Cheap reading glasses are too weak, cheap magnifying glasses usually give fantasy values, making it very hard to pick them besides a lot of try and error. The lenses I used where ~ 75mm FL from another viewer that used the same lens diameter, which isn't a particular practical source for lenses. To get the same magnification, you'd need reading glasses with about +13 diopters. The magnification/lenses you'll need also depend on the size of your phone.  Also be aware that the conversion with the Xiaozhai I only works for rather small phones, as the case tightens if you move the phone closer to the lenses. I haven't seen the (larger) Xiaozhai II yet. My current favorite modification is a Ritech II with some simple 3x Fresnel credit card magnifying lenses, available in on ebay and not featuring anywhere near 3x magnification. Not because it is necessarily the best option, but because it is very easy and the parts are available very cheap. I will post a guide (hopefully soon)."
GoogleCardboard,3buevv,frogduck1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:12:10 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks for the detailed description faduci. For those Fresnel credit card lenses, how did you deal with the (specified but not sure how true) 18cm focal length versus the focal length of the built in lenses? I'm still trying to get my head around the stacking of lenses."
GoogleCardboard,3buevv,faduci,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"Where did you find the 18cm focal length? I measured the lenses with a laser pointer and the focal point is indeed about 180mm behind the lenses, but I never found any specs beyond the (obviously untrue) 3x claim.  I'm not sure what you mean by dealing with the focal length. It is possibly to calculate the total focal length for stacked lenses:  1/total FL = 1/lens_1 FL + 1/lens_2 FL   So by stacking 75mm FL and 180mm FL lenses, you end up with about 53mm FL. Worse than the 45mm in Cardboard 1, close to the 50mm in Cardboard 2. As my primary goal with this hack wasn't to improve the FoV over Cardboard, but to find a very cheap and easy modification for a movie viewer that was usable with VR, the 53mm FL for less than USD 15 fit the bill. The larger, aspheric lenses in the Ritech II help to improve the effective FoV, similar to the larger lenses in Cardboard 2.  If by ""deal"" you mean fixing them: my first attempt was simply to attach them with Scotch tape in front of the existing lenses. This works just fine, as the Ritech II uses a flat plane on which the lenses are mounted, and the Fresnel lenses can be cut into any shape with scissors. I was astonished how usable the Fresnel lenses actually were, but they are more blurry than regular acrylic lenses and it is very important to look through the center to avoid pretty bad distortions, so fixing them causes problems if the IPD adjustment is used. I'm still tinkering with attaching them to the lens holders from the back, so they will move together with the lenses."
GoogleCardboard,3buevv,frogduck1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:22:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, when I said deal with, I meant the calculating of the new FL and also how you got it to work with the viewer (wasn't sure of the calculation and thought if it was near 18cm that would be far too long). All clearer now thanks.  The 18cm I found was in one of the many generic fresnel credit card magnifier descriptions on ebay so I assumed most if not all the cheapie magnifiers of the same size would have the same.  I also have placed an order for the magnifiers in question to play with when I receive my VR Box. Thanks for the info faduci!"

Whatever you decide, I'd suggest you get a ""v2"" cardboard as that is specced towards bigger phones.  I'm not sure the plastic viewers with head straps are a viable option at this point. The good ones are comparatively expensive and don't offer input, and Google made a deliberate decision not to allow head straps in their Carboard specification - hand-held viewers help mask the slow gyroscope response and screen update rate of standard phones."

GoogleCardboard,3br5dd,Xifar_,2,Wed Jul 1 14:39:43 2015 UTC,"I have a G3, in a SUPCASE (kind of similar sized to spigen, it has a frosted back and a black rim).   I only have a rebranded ColorCross, while it's not that great for VR (you know low FOV and all) it is incredible with movies, especially with my G3. The 1440p screen is really good.  I've tried Trinus VR on and off, I find it's best when you use moonlight streaming, there's hardly any latency with that even over wifi. (You'll need a nVidia GPU for it though). Only problem I've had with is when I use moonlight I can't get it to track my head movements. It's probably fixable, I've just been too lazy to try.  Here's how I understand it:   If you want it for movies/videos/bigscreen effect: get a plastic one If you want it for VR games/apps: Get a cardboard one or an expensive plastic one.   I'm personally eying the CMOAR headset since they have this modular system that lets you switch out the lenses module for different applications."

I'm pretty sure they will release a manufacturers kit for 2.0, so I see no reason to doubt the post on the Google+ Cardboard group announcing a release ""soon"" that you were probably referring to.  Cardboard 2 is more difficult to produce, but it isn't really complex. It still is folded Cardboard, this time glued together, lacking magnets, but adding a piece of conductive cloth (glued to the cardboard around a few corners) and a little foam. You can build one yourself with tin foil.

GoogleCardboard,3bohj0,eddieguy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:56:52 2015 UTC,Engineer here. Found a quick solution to the straps coming off.   I noticed the cardboard was thinning where the teeth latch on and it had very little friction. Just remove the straps and add 3 layers of duct tape right where the straps latch on (two on each side and one on the middle forehead slot). This will make the cardboard thicker on these areas and give you a lot more friction. Haven't slipped off since!  Make sure the strip of tape is long enough that the teeth do not latch past the tape. It will slowly peel the tape off.   Modding this thing is fun. If you already fixed it let me know how you did it.
GoogleCardboard,3bohj0,eddieguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:44:01 2015 UTC,I've been busy with work so haven't had a chance to delve in yet. I've been toying with the idea of cutting slits to function as a gripping point but that would require an epoxy or similar to keep the board from ripping apart. Then I thought of gluing a strip of Velcro with a key ring to each side to grab but am concerned about comfort. Leaning towards that one though

GoogleCardboard,3bohj0,reddog093,2,Wed Jul 1 12:59:35 2015 UTC,"I got mine the other day.  My general impressions aren't as positive as yours -- my HTC One M8 tends to slip and go askew in the viewbox (less so when I leave it in its Spigen case), the viewer digs aggressively into my nose, I can't figure out a good place to attach the headband clamps, etc -- but the biggest issue is the ""button"".  It generally just doesn't work.  There's a flap sticking up on top of the viewer, with copper-colored foil on one side and what seems to be adhesive on the other -- presumably it's meant to anchor the flap to the viewer, and the manufacturer just cheaped out on glue.  Regardless, when I push the ""button"" down, I get a result perhaps 30% of the time; sometimes when it doesn't register, my app just crashes.  Is it just my phone?  (It's pretty bad if last year's flagship can't run any apps stably)"

If you wear glasses the AliExpress version might be too small, but if your head isn't very wide, you'll get less light bleeding from the side. Flap means how high the actual phone can be, so the TinyDeal clone can handle slightly bigger phones, the width doesn't matter as much, as larger stick out to the left or right side anyway. The real critical part is the changed IPD: by reducing the inner distance between the lenses, the IPD automatically changes. Whether this is a problem depends on a) your IPD and b) the size of the screen. I have a below average IPD of about 59mm and tried both clones with the standard Cardboard QR code settings on a 4.65"" and 5.2"" screen, and I didn't notice the difference, but I may be simply lucky. The lens distance in the TinyDeal clone should work better with larger phones, while the AliExpress version should be better for e.g. iPhones with a 4"" screen (for which the Cardboard 2 works even better due to the smaller inner lens distance)."

In Birmingham's planetarium, and I was SO pissed off because they forgot to turn the lights off, and everything was washed out.  I'm eventually gonna make it straight, I guess.  My personal favourite is the show they played in Paris, two years ago, in the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie. I can't remember the title, but I remember I almost started CRYING.

The Samsung Galaxy S6 with GearVR is the best mobile experience available to date, and it doesn't have positional tracking.  The Nexus 5 was the phone the original Cardboard was designed around. IMO, you should Get a cheap one from TinyDeal, see how you like it, and branch out from there. There's no reason to spend more than $3 if you don't really know what you are getting into.   Nicer viewers are marginally better in many respects (lens quality, durability, comfort, magnet reliability), but overall the experience is fairly limited at this point.

GoogleCardboard,3bf588,faduci,9,Sun Jun 28 17:47:44 2015 UTC,"It also uses a much more powerful chipset than most phones, as the larger size allows to integrate a bigger battery. The GameFace, which the developers call a ""Head Mounted Console"", also comes with stereo cameras, which are used among other things for positional tracking. So you basically get a very powerful, untethered device running Cardboard software featuring not only head rotation tracking with sensors that will most likely be optimized for VR, but also sideways/up and down tracking.  And once you connect it to a PC, it works like a Valve/HTC Vive, giving you access to a huge library of Games with VR support on Steam. There it can be used with their positional tracking solution that also allows using separate  controllers with hand tracking. The Vive has a number of simple light detecting sensors on the HMD that measure the run time of the laser grid the Lighthouse tracking system generates, the current prototype as shown in the article doesn't seem to feature those yet. Very interesting concept, announced for Q2 2016, no price yet."

Apologies if you have answered this questions before; I have literally just learned of this today.  I haven't heard of many phones/mp4 players/tablets that actually function as an input device. Is this basically an input switch, or is this a part of your Android build? Faduci described applying some post-processing to the HMD chipset when you are using your graphics card input, but I imagine that wouldn't be possible if this was just a separate input...  Also 140 degrees FOV sounds awesome, but I imagine it produces more distortion on the edges than we are used to seeing. Do you have a way of adjusting apps that don't already have built in edge distortion correction?"

GoogleCardboard,3bf588,dabotsonline,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:04:00 2015 UTC,"Unlike other mobile headsets which dock with a smartphone to power the VR experience, GameFace’s ‘Developer Console’ (GFLDC) features an on-board nVidia Tegra K1, a mobile SoC (System on Chip) with quad-core ARM Cortex-A15 that clocks at 2.3 GHz—the same chip that powers nVidia’s Shield tablet—making the headset a completely self-contained VR headset.  GameFace has now announced that their device will be capable of connecting to a PC using Valve’s OpenVR API suite, handing the reins of its 75Hz 1440p OLED panel over to the PC’s greater horsepower. More importantly though, this also gives the device access to SteamVR games and Valve’s Lighthouse ‘room scale’ tracking and input solution, which the company is currently exploring for positional tracking.  The GFLDC is expected to be available in Q2 of 2016.   Hi /u/GameFaceLabs , won't the Tegra K1 be somewhat outdated by Q2 2016? The successor to the X1 will be shipping in products by then.

GoogleCardboard,3bf588,monstergeek,6,Sun Jun 28 20:28:33 2015 UTC,"I doubt that it would be cheaper than the OR CV1, but it could be a lot cheaper than e.g. Note 4 plus Gear VR. Compared to CV1, the GameFace uses only one screen instead of two, doesn't come with an external camera or XBOX ONE controller and has no build in speakers, so there is some way to reduce the cost, but it needs the additional ARM chipset, RAM, flash memory and battery. Interestingly the hardware itself isn't as expensive as one would expect, see this teardown comparing the build costs for Note 4 and iPhone 6/plus.  As it doesn't include the actual mobile phone network parts and needs no touch screen, it should be somewhat cheaper. A major saving would be the reduced license costs that usually apply to all devices that require some of many patents covering anything even remotely connected to mobile phones. I also guess they could get favorable conditions from Nvidia, who have been struggling to sell their chipsets (with very powerful GPUs) to any phone makers, because their energy consumption is too high. Their latest attempt was to market them to car manufacturers for autonomous vehicles instead.  Another neat option would be to apply some of the post processing in the HMD itself, allowing to use it in combination with a cheaper GPU in the PC, saving costs for the total system. How well all this works out remains to be seen."

GoogleCardboard,3bgw4z,faduci,2,Mon Jun 29 03:43:35 2015 UTC,"So you think the cardboard material here is going to be more comfortable than the colorcross?   Not without additional padding, which is also the way to make the ColorCross less uncomfortable. The distinction isn't comfort here: if you want something that is usable for VR, you cannot use the ColorCross without altering the lenses, and it is not a particularly good base for modification. Your options for something comfortable with head straps and an FoV > 75° are:   getting a Cardboard clone like the one you've linked to and adding padding. getting a comfortable plastic viewer like the Ritech II and altering the magnification. This is not trivial, changing the lenses alone is not enough, you have to modify the case to move the screen closer to the lenses.) paying more than USD 60 for one of the viewers linked in the basic questions and answers thread.   I'd recommend to always start with a cheap Cardboard clone. The fact that it is made of cardboard is actually an advantage, as you can modify it very easily. Based on this you can still decide if you need an upgrade and how much time and/or money you are willing to invest. I have a number of bought viewers, and the most comfortable one is still a DIY Cardboard, because I got it to match the form of my face exactly and added a thick layer of foam.   How about this one   Quoting the thread:     For everything else: no, you haven't found a new alternative, the viewers are just sold under hundreds of names.    ALL THE CHEAP PLASTIC VERSIONS ARE CRAP DUE TO THEIR LOW FOV.  I wrote (and stickied) that thread so that people wouldn't have to ask the same questions over and over again. Somehow this seems to be a very hard concept to grasp."

GoogleCardboard,3bf04h,Disaster_Hands,0,Sun Jun 28 17:01:48 2015 UTC,Have you tried just setting the mouse sensitivity in the game lower? Since Portal 2's on source you can customize it fairly well.
GoogleCardboard,3bfd7f,VRPill,4,Sun Jun 28 18:55:49 2015 UTC,"I regularly engage in arguments where someone considers Cardboard a joke, a 3D view finder or any other definition, as long as it is not related to Virtual Reality. Some people have made up their mind that VR means a high end PC with positional tracking, deny the label to anything that doesn't match their minimal requirement, and usually come up with a variation of the ""it will poison the well"" argument. If I shared this opinion, I probably wouldn't be on /r/GoogleCardboard.  The same applies to V.360 videos (I assume the V is for vertical, as you can only rotate around the vertical axis). I'm actually fine with these videos. Yes, they are more primitive, but similar to Cardboard VR apps in comparison to higher end products, they can still be fun and there is a much lower entry barrier, allowing more users to enjoy and create content. Technically they are all 360° videos, the difference is that a) the recorded image is a cylinder or a sphere and b) if the viewer can rotate around one or three axes while watching them. The V.360 YouTube videos actually allow a second axis (up and down). This leads to looking at a black bar due to a lack of image information in the video, but the more natural head tracking is important to avoid nausea, so the cut off video is the smaller price.  I understand why someone who invests a lot of time into creating high value content is pissed if s/he is suddenly tossed into the same corner as seemingly crappy versions, but my suggestion would be to embrace it instead of demanding a separation. Similar things have happened with instrumental vs. electronic music, DSLR vs phone cameras, TV vs YouTube, newspapers vs blogs, and it is not a winning strategy to bet against the cheap, mass compatible low end. Democratization of the means of production usually leads to a significant increase in interest in the subject, which in return leads to a higher demand for high end content, so there is a way for both the high and low end versions or ""true"" 360° video and V.360 to coexist and actually help each other."
GoogleCardboard,3bfd7f,faduci,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:30:52 2015 UTC,"I see nothing wrong with those videos. They are technically 360 videos (they rotate 360 degrees around a vertical axis). Sure, some of them are crappy, but does YouTube remove all the crap 2d or 3d videos on their site?... Absolutely not. I agree with the other commenter that this should be embraced. If there's a consumer demand for 360 cameras and an accessible website that allows their upload and viewing for free, then we should see more of these cameras hitting the market in better quality and lower prices. So sure, some of the videos now may be taken on sub par equipment, but you gotta start somewhere. No one is forcing you to watch the video, just skip it and move onto the next."
GoogleCardboard,3bd6rm,darkknightdetec,12,Sun Jun 28 02:41:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, such a tutorial was missing. Minecraft is one of the few games that I'm actually interested in for streaming to Cardboard. Not necessarily to play it, but to visit some of the insane creations of the Minecraft community. In many ways Minecraft is the best and largest virtual world building tool with more than 100M users, allowing to create the world from within the world. Which is the reason why last year Microsoft payed USD 2.5B for the company behind it, and why  Minecraft is now used to demonstrate the Microsoft Hololens (WATCH THIS VIDEO!!!) Augmented Reality glasses.  The link provided by the OP leads to a playlist with six video with a total runtime of about half an hour. I just watched through all of them. He provides a clear and detailed description, so this is a very useful tutorial for anybody who wants to give it a try. You'll need a Windows PC, Minecraft, the free Minecrift extension that adds head tracking and stereoscopic view to Minecraft plus some software to get these to run. The videos use IntuGame, available for Android and iOS, for streaming via Wifi from a PC, you should be able to use alternatives like Trinus VR too. Everything required is explained and linked to from the YouTube description.  I'm very interested what kind of reaction to this we'll see from /r/Minecraft. That is a rather big subreddit with more than 440K subscribers, and Minecraft is in many ways an extremely good fit for VR (and popular with the Oculus Rift), so if we see another jump in subscribers on /r/GoogleCardboard today, the post hit the mark."
GoogleCardboard,3bd6rm,faduci,3,Sun Jun 28 03:46:50 2015 UTC,"I scrubbed through all of the videos, and this appears to be using mouse emulation for head tracking.  Every experience I've had using mouse input for tracking has been absolutely terrible, as vertical and horizontal positioning is never spot on, and you have zero support for rotational tracking.  Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a Minecraft mod to support FreeTrack or TrackIR signals.  It's a damn shame.  Using Trinus Gyre (now Trinus VR) in Live For Speed and other games with proper tracking support is actually kind of magical.  This just seems like a recipe for nausea and a headache."
GoogleCardboard,3bd6rm,ronfar623,2,Sun Jun 28 14:41:52 2015 UTC,"Just spent the last hour working through the tutorials.  Using a Samsung Galaxy S6 with Zeiss VR One.  Did everything exactly as he did, but in the game the screens are too far apart.  It's sort of VR but because the screen distance is not exact hurts my eyes within minutes of playing.   The effect was much worse with IntuGame, along with much more lag.  TrinusVR was lag free but the screens being too far apart still hurt my eyes a lot.  Is there any setting to adjust this?  Going to go take a nap I think as my eyes feel really wonky now.  Also, I have played through multiple other games with Trinus with the display not too far apart."

GoogleCardboard,3bfil7,VRPill,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"It depends largely on where the crack is. In most cases cracks in the covering glass go down straight from the surface towards the display, so if the crack is in the middle of the screen in front of the eyes and you look straight at it, it will barely be visible. If it is somewhat to the side or above/below, the whole surface of the crack through the glass becomes visible, making it appear a lot larger. It's basically like a piece of paper: looks thin if you look at if from the side and large if you look at it from another angle.  The effect is similar to having a hair being stuck on the screen, it is mostly subjective how annoying this is. I'm usually too lazy to take out the phone to clean the screen or lenses if I notice some dust, but for others this might kill the illusion."

I think the 4k would be super helpful for a 360 video because it would obviously improve the overall resolution, but on my phones YouTube app the highest resolution it gives me is 720 (since that's my phones screen resolution). Is there any way to hack it and force a 4k resolution to take advantage of the full 360 image?"
GoogleCardboard,3bczgy,faduci,2,Sun Jun 28 06:09:01 2015 UTC,"If your phone's resolution is 720, you'll only get 720."
GoogleCardboard,3bczgy,Ls777,2,Sun Jun 28 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"That is currently true, but mostly a ""bug"" or lack of features in the YouTube app. As you only see a part of the total resolution in the 360° Cardboard mode, it would make sense to actually stream at a higher resolution than native for the phone. If you look at a 360° video in a non 360° capable viewer, you see that the area visible when looking straight forward in VR mode is about 1/3rd the height and 1/5th the width of the video. So if you streamed a 4K video (3840 * 2160) to a 720p phone, the screen resolution would fit the section of the movie that is actually shown pretty well.  Streaming any 360° video is currently wasteful, as you will only see about 1/15th of the movie at any time. Ideally YouTube would only stream the section that you are currently looking at plus some additional blocks at the edge for sudden changes in head movement.  We will probably see improved video streaming protocols capable of doing this in the future. Video codecs used today like h264/h265 already split the image into blocks of (usually) 16 * 16, so leaving out parts of the image would be possible, there simply hasn't been a need for something like this so far. With a sufficiently smart client/server combo, you could stream a 4K video to a 720p phone requiring less bandwidth than the currently used, very blocky unoptimized version."
GoogleCardboard,3bczgy,Ls777,-1,Sun Jun 28 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't be able to tell the difference (Even if you could do it, which you can't.).

That's like trying to put on a toddler's shoes as an adult.  Edit: Nice to know I'm being downvoted for being right."

GoogleCardboard,3beer1,Unidraulico,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:24:14 2015 UTC,"Could you please measure the distance between the lenses and the screen to provide an insight into the focal length of the lenses used? In a Cardboard 1 this is usually 40mm (45mm FL), in Cardboard 2 about 45mm (50mm FL). Most Cardboard clones with larger lens diameter (33mm) than Cardboard 1 (25mm) use 50mm FL, because they are intended for phones bigger than 5.5"". For these the magnification has to be lower, otherwise parts of the screen are not visible. The larger lens diameter and bigger nose hole in Cardboard 2 partially compensate for this by allowing to move the eyes closer to the lenses, so the effective FoV can be higher despite using lower magnification."

GoogleCardboard,3bfdow,PickleFart9,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:20:20 2015 UTC,Why can't you just get a lens same diameter with a higher focal length to magnify the screen more? Sorry if I have it understood wrong. I also have a dremel so it'd be no problem to bring the phone closer to the screen. I'm just looking for lenses of higher quality.
GoogleCardboard,3bfdow,faduci,2,Mon Jun 29 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"Magnification and focal length are the same. The diameter of the lens does not influence on magnification, only the curvature is important:   magnification = 200mm/focal length   Lens-screen distance has to be just below focal length to see a clear picture. So if you want to use a higher magnification for improved FoV, you need lenses with a shorter focal length and have to physically move the screen closer. The lenses in the Xiaozhai/ColorCross have a focal length of 75mm (3.3x), those in Cardboard 45mm (5.6x). I've modified a Xiaozhai by stacking a second pair of identical 75mm FL lenses inside the lens mounts, but this requires cutting away a large part of the optical divider, you can no longer use the phone mount and it only works for small phones because the case gets smaller towards the lenses.  You can make a simple try by taking the lens mounts out of the Xiaozhai and moving the lens from one of them on top of the other, they are only held by a simple plastic ring. You'll end up with a 37.5mm FL/6.6x lens that provides a much higher FoV. Stacking lenses causes less distortions than using thicker lenses with lower FL, esp. if you are using cheap, acrylic convex lenses. The question is always where to get the lenses, mine came from another viewer I had lying around."

GoogleCardboard,3b8ncr,standaloneinstaller,8,Fri Jun 26 22:37:16 2015 UTC,"This interestingly demonstrates an important limitation of VR: you can move both your eyes inwards, so they look towards the nose, but you cannot move them both outwards in different directions.  In VR you have to avoid overlap of the two image shown to the eyes, so you can ""fake"" a 3D image. Since you can at best look straight forward, the circle that each eye looks at can at most have a radius of half the distance between the eyes without overlapping with the circle for the other eye. Without using special optics this means that the total visible screen width cannot exceed twice the IPD. With an average IPD of 64mm this limits screen sized for VR to 128mm width, the equivalent of a 5.78"" screen.  It can be a little bit more, but this is pretty much the physiological limit. So a 5.7"" Note 4 is right at the edge, the 6"" Nexus 6 already beyond it. For someone crazy enough to plug a pair of nerd fun darts onto his eyes, there is of course the option to use these to pull the eyes outwards, so this might be a rather brutal way for those who want to use 7"" tablets for VR."

GoogleCardboard,3ba1io,thielonious,6,Sat Jun 27 05:33:24 2015 UTC,"There is some confusion about ""YouTube in Cardboard"":   The initial version of the Cardboard.app for Android, released about a year ago, featured a YouTube part, where you were surrounded by YouTube videos, placed on a sphere, and could start one by looking at it. This feature was removed a couple of months ago and replaced with a simple virtual cinema viewer that allows watching movies stored on the phone. A few months ago the YouTube app for both Android and iOS gained the option to watch 360° videos with either controlling the camera by swiping or with head tracking by holding the phone in the direction you want to look. The initial version didn't features (pseudo) stereoscopic view. At Google I/O in late May Google announced Cardboard support for iOS, including a version of Cardboard.app. This version differs from the one for Android, the tour through the Palace of Versailles is replaced by Explorer, a panoramic tour through museums and Mars, Urban hike offers something similar to the Street View mode in the Android Maps app, only with usable navigation, there is no cinema app or YouTube part, but the very cool Kaleidoscope viewer. A few weeks ago the YouTube.app for Android got an extra feature for 360° view: a small Cardboard icon in the lower right corner allows switching to a side-by-side mode, so that 360° videos can be watched within Cardboard. They aren't truly stereoscopic, but the effect is very nice, and there have been a lot of posts about this on /r/GoogleCardboard since the release. This feature isn't implemented in the YouTube.app for iOS yet, but it will probably show up soon, now that iOS is officially supported by Cardboard."

GoogleCardboard,3b721c,mynameisntjeffrey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"No, it is very unlikely that you will even see the edge. Compared to the Note Edge that featured a separate OLED strip for the edge display, the S6 Edge uses a part of the regular panel, so in theory it could reduce the vertical resolution a bit. But because phone screens have a ratio of 16:9, each eye gets a 8:9 image, slightly higher than wide. So if you have a perfect fit of lenses and screen that allows you to use the total width for the largest possible FoV, 1/9th on the top/bottom of the screen remains invisible anyway, and in this part lies the curved edge. Actually there is more loss, because the horizontal FoV of the eyes is larger than the vertical one."

Playing in a swivel chair at a desk is much easier (and by that I mean safer), especially for turning 360° around.   I think if you wanted to emulate the experience of someone's head moving back as they pick up speed, you could have the image move up.  The player would have to tilt their head back/lean back in their chair to maintain the same perspective as they accelerate.  The image could then slowly fall back to the baseline as their acceleration decreases.  Similarly, as they put on the brakes or accelerate backwards the image could shift down.  It might take a while to develop a story.  Something like Heavy Rain or one of the Telltale games would be great.  I think it would be hella fun to play something like Wheelchair Soccer VR.  How difficult would it be to make it multiplayer?"

I've been using Cardboard since about the time it was available, but the average phone user probably still doesn't know it's a thing.  Roller coasters are safe because they are limited in time (and can run on devices with less horsepower) so even if people get a little queasy, they can still enjoy the ride.  This could be because I've been searching the wrong places, but I feel there's a lack of good games with gamepad support.  Quake was a bitch to set up and only worked if I jumped through 4 or 5 hoops every time I opened the app.  The resolution was terrible, but it was really Quake.  Halls of Fear worked very well, but there was basically no gameplay.  Most of the VR racing games I've played have been super basic."

If all that was happening was the further development of a platform technology, things would be moving swiftly, but because the companies involved need walk on eggshells and proceed with so much care regarding the development of standards, patents, copyrights etc... the wheels will of necessity turn much slower.  fwiw, to hell with playing quake on a g-pad.

Now I use such a 27"", and have gotten used to it. I think using VR for such cases is the future, but whatever issues you have with size with a physical monitor would be the same or worse with VR, I think. With a Galaxy S6 and cardboard v2, for example, you'll get 1280x1440 monitor over a 110 degree FOV. With a 27"" monitor, you'll get 2560x1440 pixels at somewhere around 1/5th to 1/10th of that, without any need to turn your head depending on how you place it. I hopped on the VR train pretty late, but I picked up an Epson Moverio last year, and it has been quite interesting to use. Only 960x480, but wonderful for easy surfing on the couch.

Most streaming solutions do not sent back the gyro data, which is why dedicated solutions like Trinus VR exist. I know that it is possible to use FreePie on an Android phone to send the data to OpenTrack on a PC, but it would be interesting to know if Limelight actually provides such a solution itself.  And as Euro Truck Simulator 2 kind of requires a rather high resolution to read all the gauges in the cockpit, the restrictions that USB transfer of compressed video puts on the usable resolution, it would also be interesting to learn if Limelight allows resolutions above 720p without a horrible drop in frame rates.

It can lock the screen in a desired position for watching on back/counter drift etc One of the only players I've found that can play .mkv files It has 3 ""scene selections"" (Cinema+Void have a large, movie like screen size and ""Chamber"" has a slightly smaller screen size"" Magnet/tapping screen/Cardboard 2 input will reset screen position instantly for correcting drift Allows network streaming (Although I haven't got it working)   Cons are:   Menus can be difficult to navigate to find videos if they are located within many folders depending on the drift of your phone (as selection of interface is done through staring at it for ~2 seconds) Subtitles in containers are not yet supported it seems so if you want subs then you'll have to burn them in using software like HandBrake Costs 7USD :P   I'm not sure what DTS audio is so I can't comment on it and I don't have any x265 videos on me nor Opus videos. It has integrated 1080p youtube and 1080p 3d youtube support (although their interface for it is pretty terrible tbh). The developers claim to support for all video formats and seem to be working on adding new features as it was updated just a few days ago with some minor features.

There are a number of Cardboard versions made of EVA foam that all rely on several separate parts of foam being assembled together instead of one large piece being folded. This works fine due to the compressible and more stable foam.  And as I have build several Cardboards, including one cut from the blueprints, simply because the clones weren't available back then, I discourage building one yourself. Unless you use a laser cutter, cutting the blueprints into cardboard takes a lot of time.

GoogleCardboard,3b3r38,alan2500,6,Thu Jun 25 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am the author of TrinusVR Intugame is a bit misleading about the 3D wrapper. I tested it a few months ago and it didn't do any 3D at all, even though they do say so.  Several reviews on Google Play confirm that. Maybe that has changed, maybe they do add 3D to some specific game, but the fact that they'd promote it as such even when it wouldn't is... well, doesn't sound right to me. But then again, even though I'm being honest on my comments, I am the dev of TrinusVR so given the conflict of interest, you should not trust me blindly :) Both apps have a free version, so I think it'd be best if you try them both and decide. As for your other questions, TrinusVR will work with or without Moonlight. Without Moonlight, performance won't be as good, for now. But brace for it, improvements are coming. USB works better, but if you have Wifi AC you can still get quite good results (best via direct hotspot, without router). For the time being, I'd stick to 720 or lower resolutions (depending on hardware), unless you use the Fake3D mode (duplicating the image when real 3D is not available natively or using TriDef/Vireio). In that case you can set the resolution to something like 960x1080 (which is a non standard 8:9 ratio) or an alternative 4:3 resolution that is close to that. Since TrinusVR is under development, you can expect to need some tweaking and might get some bugs. But I try to be responsive with giving support and fixing issues, mainly through the forum (http://oddsheepgames.com/?page_id=208) where other users can lend a hand too, or quickly get solutions for problems already posted."
GoogleCardboard,3b3r38,loxai,2,Fri Jun 26 18:03:02 2015 UTC,I've tried TrinusVR on my Galaxy S4 and never got the USB tethering to work. Is there any guide for troubleshooting?
GoogleCardboard,3b3r38,123lurker456,3,Fri Jun 26 18:38:35 2015 UTC,"there are some tips that might help you in the help page: http://trinusvr.com/quick-guide-and-common-issues/ the main things to keep in mind: - make sure USB Tethering is enabled and working - an Android device item should appear on your windows Device Manager. If you get a yellow warning you might have an issue with USB driver. Try using the latest Samsung USB Android driver - If connection is valid, TrinusVR client (Android) should show a line like 'Client ready, using detected USB (IP:192.168.42.129) connection. Press the Start button to begin.' - The IP should always be that one, if it is different it might be a special case, and you will have to manually set such IP on the server (Advanced Mode>Network>Force IP on TrinusVR server) - Always start the client first - Make sure both client and server are up to date If that doesn't help, please post about it and the forums for better support (from myself or other users that might have experienced the problem)"

I had the same problem of not being able to usb tether my phone because of Verizon. My galaxy s5 was already rooted so I looked to see if there were any workarounds in Xposed. I found a module for tethering called Moto Tether. It let me enable tethering and use TrinusVR.  Xposed isn't on the play store, but can be found on xda http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3034811   Look for instructions on how to use it. I believe you need to restart your device after installing the framework and you will need to restart after enabling any modules. Look for X Tether under downloads. It is not guaranteed to work on your phone, but there is a short list that says which phones have been confirmed to have it working on."

GoogleCardboard,3b3r38,loxai,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:38:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment, i am gonna try your software since they lie(d?) about theirs, my specs are as follows Specs: Intel Core i5 3570 3.4GHZ CPU  H61, (PCI-E 3.0) Motherboard  2GB GTX660 MSI TWINFROZER III Graphic Card  8GB DDR3 HYPER-X KINGSTON Ram   Do you think i would have to go 720p with these specs, or would i be able to do 1920x1080? And let me get this right, your program does not have a 3d wrapper, but Tridef/Vireio can be used as one? Your program comes with streaming, but Moonlight is better? Do you have a setup guide/tutorial for using all these programs together? I am a bit confused. Thanks for having a look at reddit to see what people have to say/ask about your program, i appreciate that."
GoogleCardboard,3b3r38,loxai,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:25:18 2015 UTC,"With current build, I don't think you'll get enjoyable performance at 1920x1080. But do try, of course. Should be alright at 960x1080, with Fake3D enabled (it will, automatically when it detects such ratio). Also worth noting that, depending on the phone and head mount used, the detail difference between 720 and 1080 won't be that big. About 3D, yes you have to use one such external tool like Vireio or TriDef (unless the game has native support for 3D, like Crysis series or Doom 3 BFG). Since you need to run the game windowed and TriDef doesn't allow that, you will need to apply a registry trick (details on the TrinusVR help page). Moonlight is better in terms of speed, but you lose the lens correction (which is quite important for comfort and ensuring game is fully displayed, i.e. the corners are within the lens/eyes view area). Using the internal streaming is not as good (yet) but does have the lens correction and a few minor extra details. Keep in mind there are a few different internal streaming mechanisms, some faster, some slower. The latter (Compatible mode) is sometimes necessary depending on the game and windows hardware involve (e.g. Default/Fast mode can result in a blank screen for some setups). The help is a bit limited atm, sorry. But there's the trinusvr.com guide, a quick guide on the server (question mark) and detailed (although a bit outdated) clarifications when using the Advanced mode. At this stage of development, with changes and all, maintaining the guides/help is an extra overhead. But there's a good community on the forums that can help too (if I don't myself). In any case, once you have TriDef/Vireio up and running, there should not be any other complication to stream the content."

The magnification is the problem, not the screen size or centering.  I'd hoped that I'd have better results than /u/redoutreddit with his S5, but this video he posted shows the effect very well.

GoogleCardboard,3b05zk,TheEternalGoddess,2,Thu Jun 25 04:59:51 2015 UTC,"The tray, white plastic cover and the rest of the headset are all fit together tightly, so there's not really any way to get that closer to the lenses.  You could maybe take a bench grinder and grind the phone-facing side down to bring the phone closer, but then you're losing the tray and cover and would have to strap your phone on manually. There doesn't appear to be a way to remove the lenses without completely destroying the mechanism that holds them.

GoogleCardboard,3b05zk,redoutreddit,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:27:04 2015 UTC,"If it's your first set, I can see how you might be OK with it.  I let some people at the office try it, and they seemed to enjoy the experience, especially having nothing to compare it to.  The difference in FOV for me is this - On my balsa wood opendive kit, I'm able to adjust the lenses so that when I look through them, the edges of my phone's screen sit outside of the edge of the lenses.  So even though they're smaller lenses, I don't see any square edges, and it does a good job tricking my brain into forgetting about all the black space around them.  When I look through the VR Box lenses, all 4 edges of the screen are clearly visible unless I push the lenses far away from my eyes and decrease the FOV.  If I do this, I can almost eliminate the screen edges, but then it looks like watching the world through a toilet paper tube...it's just not immersive enough to be considered ""Virtual Reality"".  The clarity of the lenses themselves are fairly decent, which probably isn't hard to achieve with next to no magnification.  If the comfort could be improved, the VR box would be a decent stereo movie viewer."

Except on the far left side it seemed a little blurry or out of focus,its not bad but noticable.No amound of IPD adjusting or moving the phone left or right changed this. Also the screen size when watching movies seems a little more magnified than with the Storm II,so better as well. Only thing is the cushioning around the face area doesnt quite wrap around the way other VR headsets to,it seems to sit a little more flat on the face,after a min you dont really notice it though. It is quite comfortable though and while I only had it on for short periods it did'nt seem to press on my nose area. So yeah,for me Id rate it higher than the Storm II overall.Although the build quality on the Storm II feels higher.

GoogleCardboard,3b1o3l,kixpress,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:34:32 2015 UTC,I couldn't find any proof of concept as well. Really weird.
GoogleCardboard,3b1o3l,mptp,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:09:55 2015 UTC,"Sure it would be easy build that kind of thing as a fun little experiment. But that's all it would be - the positional tracking you'd get would be really awful for many reasons:   The camera you're using to record the position of the static object and therefore extract head position is using optical image stabilization, which makes tracking innacurate and swimmy If you turn or move your head such that the camera can no longer see the object being tracked, you instantly lose tracking. This can be compensated for with many, many fiducials, like in the original Valve Room, but this isn't practical The computer-vision processing required to correctly identify an image within a frame and extract its position and orientation introduces significant overhead which makes 60fps on mobile even more difficult to achieve than it already is   What you're referring to is often called 'inside-out positional tracking' and is very difficult to do well. There's an extremely high chance that Oculus is working very hard on solving this exact problem so that positional tracking can be brought to Gear VR. I expect it to be up and running sometime late next year."
GoogleCardboard,3b1jl7,Owyn_Merrilin,2,Thu Jun 25 05:38:13 2015 UTC,"Short answer - yes, you can use your freetrack setup, but there will either be occlusion issues or no 1:1 tracking"
GoogleCardboard,3b1jl7,konstantin_lozev,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"Now I'm curious about the occlusion issues -- that means it'll have problems with rendering things you're not supposed to see because they're covered up, right? Why would that be an issue?"
GoogleCardboard,3b1jl7,konstantin_lozev,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe I should have explained better. Since you have already used FreeTrack, you know that in the normal case your head rotation is exaggerated, so it is not 1:1 and your real life head yaw may be 5 degrees, while in game that translates to e.g. 15 degrees. If you make it 1:1, as you know, as you are turning, at least one of the LEDs becomes quickly occluded. BTW, also the latency and noise of Freetrack is not comparable to that of fusion-corrected IMU data. Some people use a cheap air mouse strapped to their audio headset, which does have drift issues, but is generally better for orientation tracking in VR than FreeTrack."
GoogleCardboard,3b1jl7,konstantin_lozev,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:34:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes more sense. True 1:1 doesn't work with freetrack, you're right. It's more like 1:3 at best. I'm surprised you're saying a cheap airmouse is a better option, though -- I thought one of the major drawbacks for using cardboard as a VR headset was the sensors in the phone aren't responsive enough. We actually have a couple of cheap air mice lying around the house, but I can't imagine something that cost, like, $5 and came on the slow boat from China would be very good for this.  Is it possible to feed the airmouse's sensors to the phone for use with native android demos? Because that might be worth trying. The only phone we've got with a true gyroscope is my dad's iPhone 4S, which has a lower resolution, smaller screen than my moto G."
GoogleCardboard,3b1jl7,konstantin_lozev,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:37:20 2015 UTC,"Well, there's only one way to find out, isn't it, just try it and compare, the polling rate and latency are not that bad, the problem is mainly drift."

GoogleCardboard,3ayf50,e-dosta,2,Wed Jun 24 14:34:56 2015 UTC,Why you should start with Unity and the Cardboard plugin. Why UE4 isn't an option (yet). Why WebVR (web based VR) will be an option for the (not yet near) future.
GoogleCardboard,3ayf50,faduci,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:59:52 2015 UTC,"This looks useful, thank you very much.  So if I'm getting it right, the most efficient way looks using the Unity3D engine and its tools (and mostly C#), creating the VR environment, then the Cardboard SDK plugin to script and connect it with the Android?"
GoogleCardboard,3ayf50,faduci,2,Wed Jun 24 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"Basically yes. The script that can be dropped onto the main camera is the simplest way if you already have an existing scene with a first person controller. If you start to build a new scene it makes more sense to directly use one of the camera prefabs provided by the Cardboard Unity SDK. The path will start with Unity and the Unity tutorials, in the end the Cardboard SDK just provides a head-tracking stereo camera to replace the regular camera in Unity. The connection to Android is done by Unity itself (after you have told Unity where the Android SDK is installed), and you could even read the gyroscope from within Unity and implement the head tracking yourself, but the Cardboard SDK also provides a lot of other useful things like checking the Cardboard button/magnets, adjusting the cameras to the lenses in the viewer etc.  Most of what you have to learn will be Unity (and other tools like Blender for modeling), but it makes a lot of sense to start early with testing even a very simple scene on a phone with Cardboard, because it is very hard to judge on a 2D monitor how well things will work in VR when looked upon from a short distance. There are many assets available that can improve development speed significantly once you've understood the basics, some free like Prototype for level building. Many of the most useful are not free like PlayMaker, which allows building the logic for complete games without writing any C# code, though it is best for creating basic functions very fast and then adding custom actions in C# for your specific needs.  Checking for existing solutions on the Unity asset store (and the regular sales with steep discounts) is something that can contribute a lot to increasing efficiency."
GoogleCardboard,3ayf50,konstantin_lozev,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:34:17 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting idea to read the gyro from the Unity Input class, but I am not sure whether it is raw or fusion-corrected (I think raw). What I was not able to figure out is where to get access to the Cardboard fusion, in case you want to implement a low-pass filter or to adjust the low pass filter, if there is such."
GoogleCardboard,3ayf50,faduci,2,Wed Jun 24 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"Unity doesn't allow direct access to all the sensors Android provides, including the virtual sensors that provide sensor fusion from e.g. gyroscope and accelerometer. You have to write (or buy) a Java plugin for Android to access these, which is what most mobile VR SDKs like the Dive SDK and Cardboard SDK do. The Oculus Rift developer guide strongly recommends not to query the gyroscope directly from within Unity, because there is a high draw call penalty. So while it it technically possible to develop without Cardboard SDK, it is not a good idea."
GoogleCardboard,3ayf50,konstantin_lozev,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:16:38 2015 UTC,"So it is not possible to tweak the sensor fusion of Cardboard SDK, that's a pity..."
GoogleCardboard,3ayf50,konstantin_lozev,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:51:53 2015 UTC,"Well, you can export to Android directly from Unity, so what you see in the Unity Player is (mostly) what you will get in the app."

Not very comfortable, I can wear it for long periods of time but you can clearly see the marks it leaves after I take it off. It takes some fumbling to get it on comfortably at first too. (I'm Asian with a very small nose though, so YMMV)    The way I hear it is:    If you want it for watching movies, then any of the cheap ones with low FOV will work. If you want it for VR/Games, then you'll have to spend some a decent amount of $."
GoogleCardboard,3au0ub,andymcadam2,2,Tue Jun 23 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried that particular combination, but a number of other ones, so some remarks:   Focal length is another way to describe magnification, so if you use lenses with 45mm FL like those in Cardboard, it doesn't make a difference if they have 25mm or 37mm diameter (actually 34mm lens plus 3mm edge for mounting), magnification be the same. Consequently FoV will be the same if the eyes are close enough to the lenses.  Effective FoV depends on several factors, including magnification, screen size and eye-lens distance. I've tried to figure out the math for it for some time, and it turns out that there isn't even a clear definition of what the effective FoV is in terms of what you really see. Which is why e.g. Oculus doesn't want to give a number for CV1, only saying that it is larger than DK2, for which both 90° FoV and 100° FoV have been given. Versions of Cardboard for larger phones with 34/37mm lenses most often use 50mm FL instead of 45mm FL, because otherwise it wouldn't be possible to see the whole screen.   I'm currently reviewing the Cardboard 2.0 from I AM CARDBOARD with 34/37mm diameter and 50mm FL and a Vrizzmo HMD that is advertised as having a 105° FoV. Both compared to Cardboard 1.0 with 25mm diameter and 45mm FL, tested on 4"", 4.65"" and 5.2"" phones.  What I expected to be a straight forward comparison turns out to be rather hard in regard of FoV, and there are very weird side effects due to the nature of human vision, e.g. I see phantom images in the peripheral vision in Cardboard v2 that vanish if I look straight in their direction. As expected the Vrizzmo wins in many aspects, but on a larger phone the Cardboard v2 provides a larger FoV than v1 despite using lower magnification. On a small phone the FoV seems larger in Cardboard v1.  I'll probably end up creating phone dummies to rely less on my subjective assessment, but the short version is that …   FoV is a little overrated, or to be more precise, the numbers associated with it are overrated. You need to have a minimal level to achieve immersion, but above that a few degrees more or less are very hard to notice, and the required values change from person to person. In many ways the screen size and the way the viewer is constructed are more important for the resulting FoV than the actual lenses. A viewer has a maximum FoV, but you will only get it if you have the exact right combination of factors. If the screen is too small, using larger diameter lenses won't help. If the screen is too large, using higher magnification lenses will make things worse.   So will using 37mm lenses with 45mm FL improve the FoV? Maybe, maybe not, depends on your phone, the size of your nose and the question if these are really 45mm FL lenses."
GoogleCardboard,3au0ub,faduci,2,Tue Jun 23 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"I've tried the 37mm diameter with 45mm FL lens.  I haven't noticed a change in FOV, but it felt more comfortable than the 25mm Cardboard 1.0.  The new viewer construct with slightly larger lens made it more comfortable.  The biggest improvement from Cardboard 1.0 to 2.0 is the button.  I really hated the magnetic button on 1.0 because it was very unreliable, the copper foil button works almost 100% of the time for me."

So the predictions will prove to be correct, it just took longer than expected. While the release of iOS 3.0 cited in the article was indeed what allowed 3rd party developers to create VR software for the iPhone in the first place, it was the HiRes ""Retina"" display on the iPhone 4 that really triggered VR for mobile phones, basically all of the early VR viewers targeted it for this reason. In a way this subreddit just exists because many of the things the article hints at actually happened."
GoogleCardboard,3ark9j,faduci,2,Tue Jun 23 09:15:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was more addressing the cheerful assumption that 2009 mobile hardware would be good enough to deliver the metaverse with all the VR and AR aspects we'd expect from it.  I just hope that we're not deluding ourselves as well in our little VR bubble. Realistically, as cool as Cardboard VR is, I don't think it will be mainstream until low-latency robust camera-based positional tracking in unstructured spaces is a solved problem - and that's still a while away, Project Tango nonwithstanding."
GoogleCardboard,3ark9j,karstux,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:30:44 2015 UTC,"I agree that mainstream VR is pretty far away, but for completely different reasons. My worry isn't really the hardware. While I expect things to improve a lot with next gen VR optimized phone, positional and hand tracking, the remaining problem will be software. So far VR is mostly good for WOW moments. Roller coasters or horror games are a great way to scare your friends and get YouTube views, but we are still missing anything that people really want to use VR for. Google had a reason to focus on 360° video with the latest YouTube app and Expeditions.  Technical limits always exist, but can often be countered by design. While the 4"" screen, lack of CPU/GPU power and still low resolutions were problems on the iPhone 4 (the gyro was pretty good), some of the very early VR software like Refugio Space Station (Android/iOS) or  The Height (Android/iOS) ran smoothly on it. There was some initial rejection of the Samsung Gear VR from PC/Rift users claiming that VR required at least a current high end PC. John Carmack countered this by pointing out that game developers had created enjoyable 3D experiences for what are now decades, on hardware that was much slower than smartphones.  I've played Carmack's Doom I on a 486 in 320*200 on a graphics card without 3D acceleration and I fully agree with him. Once you have the basic hardware running, all improvements are welcome, but to become interesting for a large group you first of all need software that provides a lasting use case. The educational direction that Google is moving towards with the View Master and Expeditions may even provide such a first reason for mass adaption during the next holiday season. So I see the delusion within the VR bubble more in the assumption that VR is primarily a hardware problem and once all the technological checkboxes are ticked, people will just use it. People will start using it once they consider it useful, and they will deal with the limits because they want to use it. And we are much further from this point than from usable VR hardware."
GoogleCardboard,3ark9j,faduci,2,Tue Jun 23 10:11:05 2015 UTC,"There were ""consumer"" VR headsets in the 1990s that didn't really sell well to VR users due to high prices and miserable hardware, but a lot of them were bought by dentists who used them to distract their patients with videos during dental treatment, so the idea of using VR equipment as TV viewers and vice versa is quite old. Dedicated stereo TV viewers were available before smartphones appeared, e.g. the Sony Glasstron from 1997.  Google Cardboard is indeed a ""rip off"", but not of some TV viewer hardware. In early 2012 the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California released the FOV2GO viewer, a cheap, hand held VR viewer to be used with a smartphone. They actually produced about 5,000 of them which were sold for USD 5. They also created a software development kit that allowed creating VR software for the viewer and published instructions and blueprints how to build your own. Sounds familiar?  To put a cherry on top, Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus VR, was one of the guys involved in the FOV2GO project, as were a number of very prominent figures in VR. People aren't really aware of this, but Virtual Reality is very old. It has been in active use in industry and research for more than 30 years now. The first VR HMD will be 50 years old 2018: Ivan Sutherland, 1968 ""Sword of damocles"" A HEAD-MOUNTED THREE-DIMENSIONAL DISPLAY, PDF. It was based on two small, monochrome CRTs suspended from the ceiling, showed 3000 lines per display at 30fps with 40° FoV, had positional tracking accurate to 1/100 inch and rotational tracking accurate to 0.036°. Here are some images of the HMD. A more modern one that was light enough to be actually worn was the NASA Ames Virtual environment display system, 1986, PDF with 120° horizontal and vertical FoV, 6DoF tracking, using two 640x200 LCDs. The software supported up to 1000x1000 pixel real time graphics. NASA build it themselves because they were asked a seven figure sum for existing HMDs, most likely available for military purposes.  A lot of people have been thinking about VR technology for a long time. The primary problem for the first few decades of VR were the excessive computational requirements, something that was mostly solved by modern GPUs created for gaming. After this the biggest problem for consumer/affordable VR was a lack of cheap, high resolution displays, now solved by smartphone screens. But the basics concepts and ideas have been around at least since Morton Heilig's Sensorama/The cinema of the future from 1955. As with most things in technology there isn't really any ""ripping off"" going on, instead there is a very long upwards slope where people improve upon each others ideas. For those unaware of these developments things like VR seem to suddenly pop up, but in reality it began long before most VR enthusiasts (or their parents) were even born. And thanks to all that development the entry price to VR has fallen from initially millions to now below USD 2 for owners of smartphones."

GoogleCardboard,3aq6im,faduci,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:43:10 2015 UTC,"A clever promotion for the Terminator Genesis movie. The 360° video is part of a mini series, each one posted by a big YouTuber and filled with cameos from other YouTubers. It was shot in the Los Angeles YouTube Space, making this most likely a cooperation between Google and Paramount Pictures as part of their social media marketing campaign.  Only the last of the videos was (also) produced in a 360° version by Specular Theory, so Google took the opportunity to introduce this new YouTube option to a lot of teenagers by pushing it through the channels of YouTubers that usually only do comedy/vlog/challenge/collab videos. And it seems to work, most of the comments are of the ""WTF is going on?"" kind before realizing the concept and then of the ""Holy cow, I didn't know that was possible, this is the future!"" kind after.  This thing was expensive, even if Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't get payed anything (extra), because this was part of the movie promotion deal. So we probably won't see a lot of similar videos from regular YouTubers anytime soon, but it is a safe bet that Specular Theory and similar production houses will get a lot of jobs from companies with big marketing budgets to create similar experiences."

I've seen enough vids to know there should be SOME type of magnification showing. Still tempted, though. Maybe to modify.  http://youtu.be/5yLu1YxYgIU Skip to 5:00"
GoogleCardboard,3alwid,TheEternalGoddess,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think we can conclude much since watching from third person.  The Colorcross is not bad at all if you zoom the FOV to 100.  I ordered a VR Box, but the supplier said they were out of stock in the US, so canceled the order rather than wait weeks for China shipment.  More time for others to provide feedback now before I order :)  That said, I agree that a device that is designed for multiple display sizes can not be too magnified, so would not surprised if similar to the Colorcross.  I like the Colorcross for movies since less SDE than my Gear VR Note 4 and no fogging like the Gear VR.  The Colorcross is nowhere near immersive though, but the price for that immersion is more SDE.  Both units have good and bad points."

While we QC test every single viewer that leaves our factory, some slip through the cracks. You can try pushing on the cardboard on the inside to alleviate the pressure and allow the button to move freely. Just a little bit of pressure is all it takes sometimes. If your button is still not working please contact us for a replacement HERE.   I contacted them using the link above, explained the situation, and got a response within a couple hours that they're sending a replacement.  Hope that helps!"

GoogleCardboard,3alak0,gingerblackbird,3,Wed Jul 8 18:41:26 2015 UTC,"Hi all.  Dave here, from Unofficial Cardboard. Sorry it's taken so long for me to see this and submit a response. Yes, we had a problem with our button right out of the gate. Not all, but some viewers were affected. Enough to matter, that's for sure. To clear things up, yes the button is supposed to move and tap the screen each time you press it. If the pad only rests against the screen, it will not register the tap.   So what happened? Why is the button sticking? Two possible reasons. One, there is glue overage that is rubbing and causing it. Two, and more likely, it was compressed too tightly when the final glue was applied to the bottom. If it's compressed too loosely, the whole thing is wobbly, too tight and the button might stick. It has to be done just right and that is a skill our assemblers have now mastered.   We have no excuse however for the bad button viewers getting into your hands. It was simply a fact that not every viewer was being checked like it should have been. That has since been changed and each viewer’s button is given a more rigorous quality control check by multiple team members.  If you have a button that is defective, please contact us on our website and we will ship you a replacement right away.   In the meantime, to get the button working you can try slightly pressing inside where the button touches the frame and crush the cardboard a little. Enough to increase the gap to allow the button to move freely, but not enough to show on the outside.  I’ll be sure to keep this browser open and logged in if you have any questions.  Thank you for being such a gracious customer and for your helpful feedback.   edit: spelling"
GoogleCardboard,3alak0,UnofficialCardboard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:13:33 2015 UTC,On my unit it didn't seem like the button had any give. Pressing the button with any force meant separating it from the glue.

I have a LG G3 with 5.5 inch screen and the edges are clearly visible. With generation 3 they claim a fov of 98 degrees, so that is a huge improvement. The rest of generation 2 is great. Good build quality, very comfortable, good lenses. I would say, go for generation 3, I am! Just get a controller if you do, the one that shipped with gen 2 is useless."

What I've found is I don't use the head strap too often with the cardboard.  It might be less of a problem on the EVA foam or aluminum kits (but those are more expensive), but the cardboard really isn't sturdy enough to handle the constant pressure from a head strap stretched taut- it tends to feel like it's just going to pull the cardboard apart.  The biggest problem is the upper left edge (this is a cardboard 1.0, I can't speak for the 2.0 kits)- since there's not a solid edge there, what I've done is beef up the adhesive by taping that edge together along the outside.  It's not pretty, but at least it doesn't come apart every time I put on the head strap."

GoogleCardboard,3agunp,jrddit,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:00:26 2015 UTC,"Not too sure about poking a hole through the cardboard. I'm sure it can be done, but it might be a bit more difficult. (Correct me if I'm wrong) If you're using Google's model of cardboard, you're better off just getting Bluetooth headphones.  And to answer your other question, there are many models that have 'slots' for headphones. Depending on how much you're willing to spend, the Homido ones would most definitely let you connect your headphones. (I've never owned them, so I can't give a review on them).  Another option would be the Vigica headset. They're about 30 bucks (36 with shipping), and have slots on both ends for your headphones. They do an alright job, but for me at least the quality of the lenses isn't too great. However, they fit marvelously and even come with a small Bluetooth control. 7/10  All in all, it's up to you to decide, but if your dead set on getting the Google Cardboard then I'm pretty sure you can try and squeeze in a small headphone cord."
GoogleCardboard,3agunp,jerryTcunt,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't bought anything yet. I'd like to be able to plug in the humble ol' Radio Shack headphones I always use and not buy new stuff of any sort. I've got a Galaxy S5, so I'm not worried much about compatibility with my phone (should I be?). Ideally, for right now I'd like to spend $10-$30 for the cardboard headset and have that be it. Maybe down the road I'll look at a headstrap or other things.  I've got my eye on Unofficial Cardboard's 2.0 Plus. From photos I'm looking at, it looks like the top and bottom ends of the phone are both fully exposed, so I guess a headphone connection should be easy as it usually is. Am I guessing correctly?"
GoogleCardboard,3agunp,jerryTcunt,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:49:24 2015 UTC,"Hm, if you're sticking with that price range the only other option I could find was this one. They're relatively cheap compared to other headsets, but I'm not sure the S5 would fit.  Also, depending on the size of the Cardboard you chose, you could try and squeeze the headphone's cord. They (the headphones)should be relatively thin so that shouldn't be a problem. Secure it with a rubber band just to be sure the phone won't fall.  And as for your phone, you should be fine using the Galaxy S5 (the Zeiss VR1 was practically made for it)."

Cardboard - very smooth at what it does, but the iOS version lacks the Windy Day and photosphere demos.  My favorite is the Urban Hike demo. Dive City Coaster - just one coaster that loops endlessly (no start/stop mechanism).  That one coaster is really well done, though. The Height - I can't recommend this one; it's an actual game, but the ""look and hold"" control to start/stop running makes it so you have to deliberately run into walls to stop. Offshore VR - My favorite so far.  It's an interactive ad for an oil company that lets you explore around an oil rig in a scavenger hunt, but it's the most polished VR app I've come across on the iPhone. VR ONE Cinema - Unfortunately, I didn't get far with this one.  No ability to watch by URL, and it seems the IPD on the VR ONE is different than the Cardboard, so the double vision was really bad while looking around the theater.   Currently, my favorite thing to do with my Cardboard is to use it as a poor man's Oculus Rift- combining Vireio Perception with VR Streamer and its companion server exe.  It takes a lot of patience to get it up and running, but once everything clicks into place for you,  it's incredibly fun.

GoogleCardboard,3a6owv,faduci,5,Wed Jun 17 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"My personal experience (I own a DK 2, Gear VR and Cardboard) is that 360 degree videos are among the best experiences I have had. I think for a lot of the mainstream, it will be the first application they will enjoy. It's pretty much the easiest way of experiencing VR, doesn't need any control schemes at all, and can be made as comfortable as possible.   I also think that both on the filmmaking side and on the consumer side, a language will evolve, just like it did with any new medium. The earliest movies were just composed of one long shot, and over time, directors came upon different kinds of shots, cuts, etc. I think it will be enjoyable when well-made longer movies (20 minutes? 90 minutes? who knows) come out, and I think that one of the enjoyable things will be your personal experience with the video. Did you choose to look at some things in the ""background"" or did you always look where the main action was happening? Will you find a new aspects when you re-watch the video?  Of course this doesn't mean that games and other applications will not be equally awesome. I just think that 360 video is a very natural transition to VR."

GoogleCardboard,3a6owv,Ryan86me,7,Mon Jun 22 00:51:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Video is a way of presenting a story to the viewer. It's difficult to do that when the viewer could very well be engrossed in watching a cloud as it passes overhead.  That said, 360 video has great potential if someone can figure out how to use it properly. Imagine a horror movie where instead of the shot changing to the door as the monster crashes through it, you hear the crash and have to turn to the door yourself to see what caused the sound. Of course there would be downsides- you'd have to rewatch the scene later if you wanted to see how the characters reacted to the sound."

GoogleCardboard,3a6owv,Ryan86me,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:16:06 2015 UTC,"Cardboard in general is more suited to experiences that are under half an hour or so. However that's not a bad thing, as it's going to be how most people use most VR out of the box until it becomes more everyday. As far as video I've been pretty impressed with what I have seen so far. The thing to remember about VR Video is that it is at it's extreme infancy at this point. Full spherical video is just working out things like where do you put the camera and where does the director and crew hide during the shoot. But what you are seeing now is just the beginning and not the end. Experiences that are more 180 and direction driven (so it's not your job to spin around to where the action is) are just around the corner as are more interactive movies where you can make choices that effect the outcome of the film. (think choose your own adventures) It's pretty good right now but it's only going to become better."

GoogleCardboard,3a6owv,konstantin_lozev,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:55:39 2015 UTC,"The 360° video experience won't be good enough for it to justify people obtaining new hardware (even if the hardware is inexpensive) for a little while yet. It falls over in a few ways:   Resolution: We just don't have the resolution capable of displaying nice VR video yet. 8K is a decent starting point - 4K is definitely too low, and below that is double definitely too low. Right now, few people have camera set ups to take spherical video of that quality, and even desktop hardware struggles with 60fps 8K video Storage size: A relatively full-length (say 30 minutes) video in 4K takes up something in the neighborhood of 5GB. A 2 hour film would take up 20. If people want to cultivate a movie collection of 360° films, they'll find themselves filling up terabyte hard-drives in no-time. Unless of course content is streamed, introducing a third problem: Bandwidth: Everybody gets content by downloading it now. If a single 360° film is 20GB, most people will be looking at waiting overnight for it to download, and being limited to only downloading a few of them a month (due to data caps). If content is being streamed, you're looking at multiple MB/s download speeds for the player to keep up, and many people just don't have internet speeds that fast.   Ultimately, VR video is pretty cool, but I don't think it's ever going to be much more than a fun little toy to bring more people to VR. By the time it gets feasible (i.e. resolution of source media is high enough, storage in devices is higher, bandwidth is greater), rendered VR content is going to be so much more compelling (not to mention interactive) that I doubt there'll be a huge market for it.  That all being said, I love VR video and have a crapton on my hard-drive, so I won't be sad if I'm wrong and it takes off massively. :)"

GoogleCardboard,3a7ze0,Ryan86me,4,Wed Jun 17 23:04:41 2015 UTC,"Im so torn with this company. Let me start off by saying that I did recieve my ViewR on Tuesday and I can see why it would take longer than the two weeks that were estimated to build and ship their back-order. If you look at the website they've updated the pictures to show the upgrades that they made from the prototype which include a rubber trim around the face for comfort, shaping around the nose, and wrapping the whole thing in a thin leather like material. They also changed the backing that holds the phone so instead of completely surrounding your phone its concave, this is a plus and minus because if your phone isn't huge you're going to see light shining through the sides but this also gives you the ability to adjust the phone without having to open the back. Mine arrived with some minor damage that I believe happened in shipping, the piece of cardboard that connects the button to the screen had become completely unglued and fallen inside,  with cardboard I wasnt surprised and just used a craft glue that I let cure for 24hrs and it now works perfectly.  So I do believe that the product itself is actually really good and probably the best google cardboard out there for the price but the customer service was extremely frustrating. If they had stated from the beginning that it could take a month to receive all of the frustration could have been avoided . Instead it was weeks of false shipping dates, when I finally did get a response, and an excited email stating ""your order has shipped"" when they had very clearly just printed out a label. I work for a large company so I understand that bulk pickups arent usually scheduled for until around 6 or 7 that night but this took two days to be turned over to fedex after I was told that it had been shipped that day. Im also very weary of a company that deletes any review that isn't 5 stars from its website...how are people suppose to make an informed decision before purchasing?"

Aside from the terrible wait, and misleading customer service, here is what I think of the product:  Immediately out of the box, it feels like a quality product.  Solid, nice to hold, well built.  Really, it is hard to believe I got it for the price, it doesn't feel like cardboard!  (even though it is of course)  I placed my phone in with no trouble situating it, and the strap secures the phone nice and snug.  On first use, I noticed a bit of blur.  I was able to quickly adjust each lens, rotating them until I had optimal clarity for each eye.  This is a big plus, in my opinion.  The lenses are big and clear, they even include a microfiber cloth to clean them with.  Holding it to your face is comfortable due to the soft rubber lip, and gripping it is nice, as it has a soft touch coating over the cardboard, as jellybean_o_o mentioned.  Overall, I'm very impressed with this product.  It is miles better than the cardboard v1 that I built myself. (which wasn't very great of course)  If you can handle the poor service, it really is a superior product in my opinion."

GC can't take off as a gaming platform if devs don't play ball as well, and almost all VR-interested devs brush GC as a media viewer.

GoogleCardboard,3a8yar,Guennor,0,Thu Jun 18 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"Google cardboard is designed for other kinds of experiences instead of gaming. With cardboard, the ONLY input you have while using it is looking around and the magnet ring, so it's very hard to design a good game with intresting player-world interaction and things like that. Sadly cardboard doesn't have too much gaming potential.   I'm a game designer and I'm really thinking of trying to make some simple games to be played with cardboard, but I know for sure I won't be able to do something extraordinary."
GoogleCardboard,3a8yar,Guennor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:02:39 2015 UTC,"You can use a wireless controller on any android phone, IOS too I'm sure.

But it is also the only vr headset you can purchase today for 18 dollars, which makes it very compatible with the ""electronic entertainment expo"". Sad fact is Google does not seem interested in promoting the device- very few people have ever heard of it.  P.s. objectively we all think both our games- skeet shoot vr, and duck shoot vr are fun- otherwise we wouldn't have published them."
GoogleCardboard,3a8yar,Guennor,2,Fri Jun 19 04:21:40 2015 UTC,"I know about controllers, but the thing is, you can't expect your players to have any kind of extra equipment except for, you know, google cardboard (as we're talking about cardboard games, so it's no surprise that having a cardboard is necessary). I like the concept of smartphone controllers as a PLAYER, but as a DEVELOPER I will never make a game that is only playable with controllers - only games that are compatible with controllers (like yours, for example), because I know that a tiny, TINY fraction of smartphone users have a controller. The thing about this is that smartphones are meant to be simple. You take them out of your pocket and start playing. Simple stuff with simple commands. Swiping, tapping, etc. That's why candy crush and angry birds are so popular. Usually if people want more complex experiences that need a controller, well, they play on consoles.  I just don't get your ""WTF?!"". Seriously, look for VR apps on the playstore and give me one actually GOOD game that is at least good in all of its aspects (visuals, mechanics, etc). There are some games with good graphics, but are shit in gameplay. For example - there's this first person zombie shooter game, the graphics are pretty good for a mobile game, but you literally just look around. The character moves by himself, and shoots (""pulls the trigger"") by himself too, so basically you just look at zombies to kill them. It's pretty boring. As far as i've searched, there are no games that are decent all around. There's always a flaw - usually a gameplay one (and almost always the visuals suck).  So, how can you be so impressed that there was nothing about cardboard on E3, if there is nothing really good in terms of cardboard gaming? Like seriously, have you seen the hololens demo? Imagine that demo, and then next on google's showcase, someone showing, uh, I don't know, the shitty rollercoaster demos that we have?   I downloaded your game and played for a bit. I have to congratulate you, FINALLY a VR game that uses the god damn magnet ring as input (like in the zombie example that I said before - WHY didn't they add the magnet ring as a ""pull trigger"" command?! This bugs me). Your game is simple, but it uses every kind of input that cardboard experiences offer, so I guess it's alright. But it's a short experience... like really short. I don't see me coming back to play it in the future, for example. It simply does not keeps me interested... but that's just me.  Anyway, there are not many cardboard games, and the few that we have, well, are shitty, so I don't think there will be anything about google cardboard in huge events like E3."

But wouldn't it have been great to see something about cardboard and what interesting apps were out there?  Even just show some of the awesome experience style apps like orbulus or 3d 360° videos?  I think people would have been excited by that- especially since they could have that experience at home today.  As a developer it feels like- well there went one million potential users...

GoogleCardboard,3a8yar,Guennor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:06:17 2015 UTC,"Don't worry dude. :)  Yeah, it would be great if google promoted the cardboard more. But this promotion would have to be before E3 or any big expo like that, so there would be time for people to make something good for cardboard, so they could have good things to show.  About your game, I feel there is some kind of delay when trying to shoot - I pull the magnet ring and it feels like it takes a tiny fraction  of a second for the game to respond. Is it because of the magnet ring response itself? I'm planning on making a game where you use the magnet ring and  I want the response to be immediate, but i'm afraid that it's not going to be possible and that's why other games don't use it as input."

All that said, this might actually be a better choice for people with 5 inch phones than a proper v2, as the new lenses and geometry in v2 actually reduce FOV for anything less than a huge phone. Assuming this box has v1 lenses (meaning 45mm focal length, in addition to the 25mm diameter - a likely conclusion since those particular lenses are cheap currently), and is built right (ie has the correct geometry for the v1 lenses) then it will give more FOV to 5 inch phone users than a proper v2 - while giving the added benefit of the new button and sturdier build."
GoogleCardboard,3a6dbm,In_Film,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"I have the Cardboard 2.0 from I AM CARDBOARD which is also ""Inspired by Google Cardboard v2"", but looks identical to what Google showed at I/O 2015. My guess is that ""inspired"" is mostly a legal term, indicating that the viewer has not been certified by Google, which would allow it to use the ""Works with Google Cardboard"" label.  The FoV is a difficult question. Screen-lens distance is 42mm in Cardboard v1 and 45mm in Cardboard v2, officially the focal length is 45mm for v1 and 50mm for v2. I'm still in the process of testing and measuring, but for reasons I cannot really explain the FoV with a 4.65"" in Cardboard v2 seems to be larger. Measuring the focal length with a laser pointer shows that the v2 lenses have indeed a longer focal length and should magnify less, I'm still waiting for a 4"" and 5.2"" phone to show up here to compare them. It may still turn out that the FoV is indeed larger in v1 once I improve my measuring methods, but at least subjectively there is no significant difference and the benefits of larger lenses would outweigh any loss in FoV.  And while Cardboard 2.0 may be more usable than expected for smaller phones, it may be less usable than expected for larger phones. The round cutouts work pretty well for me, I can barely see them, so the area visible through the two circles is the area that is visible through the lenses. But the max width is 118mm, the equivalent of a 5.33"" 16:9 screen. You can add a little for the vignette, but if you actually try to use a 6"" Nexus 6 with Cardboard v2, a significant part of the screen will be invisible. Cardboard v2 is a few mm higher than v1, so you can fit in a 6"" phone, but it suffers from the same constraints as e.g. the Homido with large screens. Detailed review is coming.  The images on Aliexpress are somewhat confusing, the one shown in the icon contains their v2 clone with 25mm lenses on top, but the official v2 with 34mm lenses at the bottom.

GoogleCardboard,3a25wo,AlvaroB,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:10:30 2015 UTC,"Well, it says it will transform that video in stereoscopic vr, but it is like some TV's transform 2d content to 3d, using algorithms, but recording in 360 3d implies placing two cameras in every direction, like we see with our eyes. The rig I mentioned above does really record in 3d 360, and you can see what I'm saying."
GoogleCardboard,3a25wo,faduci,8,Wed Jun 17 14:30:06 2015 UTC,"It's a lot more advanced than that. Google said that it is the equivalent of recording a scene with about 1000 cameras, so they are creating something like a light field camera with a lot of micro lenses algorithmically. With two cameras you can only see the stereoscopic perspective view of the camera, while Jump can recreate hidden objects that would be obscured from a certain perspective if it has passed them before. So if the camera moved sideways, the software can basically recreate every perspective along that axis, even if it wasn't recorded directly. Pretty fancy stuff, extremely expensive computationally, they said that you have to use their data centers for this.  The approach isn't completely new, the MIT media lab researched algorithmic approaches to extract 3D scene info from video in the 90s and Microsoft Photosynth does something similar with static images. Google Jump does it for 360° stereoscopic video. If you only move the camera forward, the range how far you can move your head left or right is limited by the width of the camera rig. See this Verge video about Jump, after about a minute you see several scenes with lateral head movement."
GoogleCardboard,3a25wo,In_Film,2,Wed Jun 17 15:06:59 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of misconceptions about Jump, and Google's PR videos aren't helping clear that up.  The ""thousands of in-between"" images aren't going to be used for lateral head movements, they are only used to get a more accurate seamless 3D stitch - a big enough deal on it's own. If you watch any of Jaunt or VRSE's 3D 360 videos, you'll see how people are struggling with that - Google did solve a big problem with stitching 360 3D here, but that's about as far as it goes.  There is no way to stream video onto YouTube that you can move your head laterally in - that won't happen anytime soon, Google's render farms or no. That requires a ton of data and 3D processing and rendering on the client side - that's not within the parameters of what streaming video can do, that will require a dedicated download for each video with more than just video data included.  YouTube's upcoming ""3D"" 360 support, that they announced at the same time as the Jump camera, will consist of a stereo pair of 360 images - and as such, it's still a hack as you cannot tilt your head or look up/down without breaking the 3D. It is just the stitching that Google has upgraded, not the playback."
GoogleCardboard,3a25wo,faduci,3,Wed Jun 17 17:26:37 2015 UTC,"There is indeed a serious lack of information about Jump, but I am very sure that it is a lot more than seamless stitching. They really seem to create something similar to a light field, which can actually be rendered into different perspectives in the HMD. What they showed so far with Expeditions superficially looks like conventional 360° streaming, which would  benefit from the improved base material, but that wouldn't really use the full potential.  Most conversions from 2D to 3D just extract object depth by observing parallax during movement, allowing them to create separate 2D layers that can be moved slightly to create a 3D effect, but the data remains 2D. What light fields do and what Jumps seems to do also is to create an actual 3D representation. That is much more than Jaunt or VRSE do, and I'm sure the ridiculous amount of Google employees with PhDs is one of the reasons why it works at all. If you have a 3D representation, you can actually use it for lateral head movements if you render the perspective live instead of relying on something pre-recorded. You couldn't move it very far, but enough to lean in and look around objects, which makes it much more real than simple stereoscopic recordings, stitched together.  A client that support this locally will take some time to show up, but the demonstration of Expeditions in the video I've linked to is a hint how they will do this with current phones: in Expeditions a group of students is visiting the same place, but they are not standing in the same location. Every student has a distinct perspective from a different spot in the place they visit together, something emphasized (and easily overlooked) in the video. This would be impossible if they had used a regular 360° recording rig, everybody would end up in the same location. Unless they made dozens of almost identical recordings in one place with only slightly moved positions, the only way to do this is if every view isn't really recorded, but reconstructed from the 3D data extracted from the recording. Which would also explain the insane computational requirements. The rendering itself isn't anywhere near as expensive, so they most likely generate a dedicated 360° video stream for each individual student/spot on the server, each with its own perspective. For now they are probably pre-rendered, so they make one recording, run the analysis and then render e.g. 20 different 360° videos for different spots, but given enough power the streams could be generated live, allowing the student to actually move around. This is impossible with conventional 360° recordings, which at most move the user on rails. Throw enough rendering power at it and it becomes possible. This is something Google (and very few others) would actually be able to provide.  So my guess is that Jump is a lot more than most people assume. It may look just like a fancy rig for 16 GoPros, but this part is completely irrelevant. They found to record and analyze real-world 3D environments and recreate them from any perspective. Which is extremely impressive."

GoogleCardboard,3a25wo,AlvaroB,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:04:42 2015 UTC,Just checked again; you are correct.
GoogleCardboard,3a0mmf,AvaVR,5,Tue Jun 16 08:16:00 2015 UTC,"That is an extremely clever idea. As the concept may not be obvious to everybody:  Google calls 360° panorama pictures ""Photospheres"" and included a way to watch them from within the Android Cardboard app. You have to load the picture onto your phone, e.g. into the DCIM/Camera folder. Once you enter the photosphere viewer in Cardboard app, you can turn around and look at the panorama surrounding you,  forwarding through all found panoramas with switch/button/touch. This is a very nice way to explore a different location like Mars or the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.  This is of course an elaborate process, starting with the need to find the pictures. This video is just 150 of these panoramas, each shown for about four seconds. Doesn't make much sense if you watch it on a PC, but if you use the latest version of the Android YouTube app (no iOS support yet), it detects the 360° video format and a) lets you look around to and b) provides a Cardboard button to switch to a stereoscopic view. Switch/button/touch pause and restart the video, so you can use it as a slide show too, stopping whenever you want to look around.  The quality will not be as good as with most photospheres, because a) the video resolution streamed to a phone will top at 1920 * 1080, while images can be much larger and b) YouTube videos use a high compression rate, removing many details. But nonetheless this is a great and very user friendly way to let people experience photospheres. Kudos for coming up with this elegant solution. And check AvaVR's YouTube playlists for more 360° videos."
GoogleCardboard,3a0mmf,faduci,2,Tue Jun 16 10:16:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I figured, since 360º video cameras are not widespread yet, anyone can take panoramas with their phone. And then there's the Cardboard app that you have to rename downloaded panoramas to be able to watch them. It's very complicated. So I thought why not just find lots of interesting photospheres and put them all together in a YouTube video since it's so easy to watch them with Cardboard on the mobile app now. Took me 5 hours to find ones I liked (chose mostly odd ones that make you wanna pause and see what the hell is going on because who wants to look at sunsets and beaches only).   Kinda messed up with the very last one though cause it was shorter in height so the entire video ended up with a black bar on top and bottom which translates to a black circle in 360. If it hadn't been for that one every single panorama would be perfect looking up and down. It was too late before I noticed but I'll improve next time.  Also need to find a video editor that can support higher resolution. I used VSDC and the limit was 1080p.... But then again some panoramas weren't high quality enough. Like the rainbow houses, but I really liked it despite that so I put it in there.  This was more of a quick experiment. I'm gonna start collecting more interesting panoramas so I can make an even better video sometime soon :P"
GoogleCardboard,3a0mmf,faduci,2,Tue Jun 16 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest making them shorter. The current one with about 12min is already long if the viewer never stops to look around, but to really look at everything it would take at least three times at long, probably a lot more. I doubt that many people will make it to the end.  You could split them into bundles of e.g. 25 photospheres, sorted by subjects like nature, city life, architecture, weird things etc., which would give viewers a hint what to expect and increase the chance that they will see one or several completely. It's a really good approach to give people access to photospheres, so I'm sure there will be interest."
GoogleCardboard,3a0mmf,faduci,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:10:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. Yeah watching it entirely the first time made me a little dizzy.

GoogleCardboard,3a0mmf,mvbeust,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:29:39 2015 UTC,"I initially thought that 12sec would be too long, as people might get annoyed if they aren't interested in one particular photosphere and would have to wait for a long time for it to be changed. Pausing is easy, skipping is hard. But I just watched the Seven Wonders of the world video/photospheres, and this worked pretty well, both for the total duration and the time each image was shown. Also a good choice of subject, so I'd say you have found a good balance. I subscribed and am curious what you will come up with next. Good job!"

GoogleCardboard,3a04km,faduci,2,Tue Jun 16 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"The only way to use software for the Oculus Rift that is written with the Oculus SDK (instead of being forced into VR mode with an injector like vireio or Tridef 3D like most commercial games) without having a Rift is building a DK1 clone that a) provides an external sensor that the Oculus SDK queries, b) a HMDI device that sends a fake EDID signature that the SDK uses to check for the presence of the Rift and c) a headset using a small HDMI monitor. There is and will be no way to stream native Oculus software to a phone, because it tests for the presence of multiple hardware components the phone doesn't have.  Some Oculus demos provide an alternative head tracking simulation with the mouse, e.g. Chicken Walk and can be used with something like IntuGames, TrinusVR or solutions based on FreePie and OpenTrack, but these aren't really ""Oculus games"", as the mouse controlled camera is completely separated from the Oculus SDK. If the developers didn't include such a mode (usually to present the demo on a regular screen), there is no way to control the software without a Rift.  The injectors do this the other ways around: they take the gyro data from either a Rift or a phone and translate it into mouse movements for non-VR games that already support looking around with the mouse, then get the game to render two stereoscopic images that can be sent do the Rift/phone. This obviously only works for games that allow moving the camera with the mouse."
GoogleCardboard,39wznk,ethicalfive,5,Mon Jun 15 14:12:07 2015 UTC,"I just received the Cardboard v2.0 from I AM CARDBOARD, and my first impression is a lot better. For me the lack of optical divider wasn't a problem, and because my main fear was lack of durability, I started abusing it pretty much immediately. The velcro on top is indeed too strong, it started to lift from the double sided adhesive tape on the first attempt, but pressing it firmly against Cardboard helps. This was required 3-4 times during a stress run, where I opened and closed Cardboard more than 50 times in short order. The top part will definitely show wear, but all in all it seems rather stable. My primary concern was the button/lever, which by now has already withstood about 400 rather aggressive presses without problems (as mentioned, I went for abuse immediately).

I'm a huge fan of the original design, I do hope people realize it's still the best option for phones in the 5 inch range.

GoogleCardboard,39wznk,mr_completely,2,Tue Jun 16 11:31:44 2015 UTC,"I received my IAMCARDBOARD v2 today which I use with my iPhone 6.  I noticed quite a few similar issues:   Velco is so strong that it is deforming the cardboard - getting bent and actually the top cardboard flap has opened up/pulled apart and will need gluing back together, after only a dozen uses. Pressure pad needed pressing back into the case as it was protruding onto the phone screen and wasn't working. I can see the vertical edges of the phone screen on both sides I can see the edge of the opposite eye's screen in each eye, so when moving around, I can see bits of the other screen the whole time in my edge vision.   Not a great experience really but for only £20 not bad either. I didn't realise that v1 was better for iPhone 6 sizes - can anyone else confirm that is correct? If so, I'll wait and see if more apps start coming out then probably buy a v1."

It's gyro sensor is all messed up (not sure if it's due to hardware or software but either way Motorola are in no hurry to sort it out) so it's pretty horrific for VR apps as it jitters and shakes all over the place.  There's one strand of hope in that a person on here a while ago mentioned they were developing an app or code that would correct this but it think it also involved rooting the phone which isn't as easy to do on the Moto G 2nd Gen than most other phones.
GoogleCardboard,39x81j,JoeFilms,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:07:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm fine with rooting, but what about cinema apps, where I can lock the gyro so I just look in one place?

GoogleCardboard,39x81j,JoeFilms,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:37:05 2015 UTC,There's apps like SBS player which are decent for watching movies on that don't require the gyro.  Finding a cheap alternative is rather tough though. Ideally you want a 1080p display or beyond and a decent gyro.   There's lots of cheap phones with decent gyros that have extremely low res screen or there's lots of cheap phones with 1080p screens with no gyroscopes.  I've been making do with the Moto G 2nd Gen just to quickly test apps and then using my girlfriends Galaxy S5 for proper use.  I'd be happy to see if anyone else has some affordable suggestions though?

GoogleCardboard,39w0so,karstux,2,Mon Jun 15 06:46:04 2015 UTC,"AFAIK there is no Cardboard plugin for UE4, but it shouldn't be too hard to use the regular Android Cardboard SDK in Java via the Native Development Kit from C++ with UE4. The main problem is that UE4 isn't really optimized for mobile development right now, resulting in very large build sizes and pretty bad performance on anything that isn't high end.   Compared to the Unity engine, UE4 is often technically better, e.g. the lighting looks spectacular out of the box, and even though Unity 5 improved this a lot, the difference is still noticeable. But you pay for it with higher system requirements and the need to tune the app a lot. This allows teams with a lot of experience to create incredible things with UE4, but makes it rather hard for a small developer new to VR to achieve anything that works on the current Android installation base. Unity has such a stronghold in VR, because most developers working on VR titles are indies that have to fight to keep performance requirements down, since everything has to be rendered for two eyes instead of one camera."

Most streaming solutions will not do this, so head tracking will be impossible, you'd have to turn the camera with a mouse, which is a very bad idea, because this is one of the main causes for nausea in VR.  IntuGames and Gagagu VR streamer are currently the only streaming solutions available for iOS of which I'm sure that they support head tracking. Both can only stream via Wifi (due to some Apple restrictions, enabling USB streaming is very expensive for developers) and are not as stable/polished as Trinus VR. I do not know if the Duet Display streaming app mentioned here will support head tracking, after taking a look at their website I seriously doubt it."

Are you using a 3D injector like vireio that will actually make the game VR compatible? Without one you'll only see the same image twice.  EDIT: I should add that I don't use any of the streaming solutions. It might be possible that IntuGames comes with an integrated 3D injector, but this would be astonishing, as creating one isn't trivial and requires special settings for a large number of games."

Yes I downloaded it but its extremely confusing because it only works with a certain list of games and its only like 20 games and none of them are really games anyone plays. Why is there not some program that just makes the image side by side and 3d? the great thing is that the intugame app allows you to turn off split screen so you can just use the 3d injector on your computer to create the two images, but sadly I am having a lot of trouble with vireio"
GoogleCardboard,39rbqz,on999hihihi,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:28:33 2015 UTC,"That's probably a problem with the small screen again. The SBS version with the dolphin is actually the worse one, you want something like whatever the image on wordpress shows. The reason is that the lenses introduce distortions, the edges are bend. Injectors ""project"" the image in a way that compensates the lens distortion, so if you look at it in the HMD the edges are straight. You should be able to configure the injector so that the image width fills your screen completely.   The black vignette will remain, because the parts of the image that usually wouldn't have been visible have been ""squeezed"" into the middle, leaving the border black, but on a large enough screen you wouldn't see it. Because the lenses in Cardboard don't magnify high enough for a 4"" screen, the vignette will be visible, so SBS without distortion correction may be the lesser evil. I don't know how to disable the lens-correction, but assume that it is configurable. Look for something called barrel or cushion distortion correction.  This is basically what I meant by not as stable/polished as Trinus VR: streaming games to a phone is kind of a stack of hacks. The games aren't designed for stereoscopy, the phones aren't designed to receive streaming video, the gyroscopes aren't designed to be sampled fast enough, so you end up with something that requires a lot of tinkering and tuning to become usable, and even then it remains limited. Trinus VR was the first solution for Android and has become better over time, while both IntoGames and VR Streamer were released not long ago and have a much smaller user base. Injector configuration is difficult, as you have to adapt it for each game. Not much you can do about it but a lot of try and error."
GoogleCardboard,39rbqz,GreatSchnide,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:55:27 2015 UTC,"Okay I understand now. So basically there is no all in one solution for SBS 3D and iPhone streaming. Do you have any idea as to why Trinus VR has not also made an app for iOS? I know I would pay a good amount for it. So I guess my best bet is just normal SBS for video games if they dont have VR support, which I feel might still have a pretty cool effect, does it? So I guess the most I will be doing is using apps that are SBS 3D ready. Thank you Faduci!"
GoogleCardboard,39rbqz,GreatSchnide,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:07:40 2015 UTC,"Injectors are a pain even with the Oculus Rift, which is much better equipped, as it connects via HDMI as a monitor. And even if you get everything to run, some things will look horrible, e.g. the distance of the sky in Skyrim. Games contain a lot of visual cheats to improve performance, on a regular monitor you will not notice them, but in VR they look horrible. Games with native VR support are therefore a lot better, but there are so few that injectors are used as a crutch.  I don't remember if iOS support was/is planned for Trinus VR or if the increased interest for VR on iOS after the release of Cardboard SDK for iOS will lead to porting it. VR for phones is still extremely experimental in every aspect, streaming is even worse. Initially the more open nature of Android was simply better suited for all the required hacks and tinkering, so many solutions are still Android only, and many of the developers are/were using Windows, making iOS support difficult. While game engines like Unity can switch between Android and iOS with one click, porting something like Trines VR to another OS is a lot more complicated and will take a significant amount of time. There is a forum on the Trinus VR support site that would be the best place to mention that you would be willing to pay a good amount for it, it might push the issue. But Trinus VR won't solve your problems with the injectors, you will still run into a lot of problems. Basically there is no all in one solution for SBS 3D streaming for any platform, the iPhone is just the least supported platform."

The Zeiss VR ONE officially supports phones from 4.7"" to 5.2"" and doesn't even work with the Note 4, which smaller than the Nexus, the Homido will cut off any screen beyond 5"". The best/only option with high FoV so far seems to be the VR BOX with a tray for phones up to 163 mm * 83 mm, probably designed with the Nexus 6 in mind (159.26 mm * 82.98 mm), but there are no reviews yet verifying the high FoV."

GoogleCardboard,39r5yo,SoHuangry,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:41:33 2015 UTC,"If you have a large head I recommend you avoid it. I have what I consider an average size head but the Homido still feels very tight. Its not comfortable to wear for more than a few minutes, I don't know if its the thin foam or the tightness of the strap. You'll also notice a lot of light coming in from the nose slot if you have a small nose.  If you are looking at different headsets, I would pay attention to how easy it is to remove the phone. With the Homido, I have to take it out and re-position/center it ever time I need to change the app/setting. It's very cumbersome.  To be fair this is my first VR experience. I have no comparisons with the FOV but I do notice the edge of the screen of my Nexus 5. So I'm guessing it would be better with the 6 as it has a larger screen."

GoogleCardboard,39p6b9,basilect,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:03:32 2015 UTC,"I have no instructions, just some remarks. I'm also checking regularly if Google has replaced the v1.2 blueprints with those for 2.0, not to build one, but to see the specs for the lenses and see the lever construction. There are conflicting informations about the lenses, Unofficial Cardboard lists them with 45mm FL (like v1.0), I AM CARDBOARD with 50mm FL, both with 37mm diameter (34mm visible). 50mm is actually more likely, as existing versions of Cardboard for larger phones also switch to 50mm lenses, because otherwise the screen wouldn't be fully visible in some phones.  Cardboard 2.0 supports 6"" phones, indicating the use of lenses with less magnification. This unfortunately would mean that the (lens based) FoV would be reduced for smaller phones compared to v1.x. The larger diameter and larger nose hole in Cardboard 2.0 should reduce the keyhole effect that previously limited FoV if you couldn't get your eyes close to the lenses, so the effective FoV might still be the same or larger in Cardboard 2.0 even for smaller phones.  If someone wants to try to build a lever button: it is rather easy with a piece of Cardboard, folded twice to form a triangle, covered with tin foil, and a little foam to increase the touch area. Cardboard V2.0 uses conductive cloth instead and will probably more durable, but the construction itself seem to be very simple."

There is currently no way to run Gear VR software on any phone besides the Note 4 and Galaxy S6(edge). And even on these it only works with Gear VR, which provides external, USB connected sensors for which the Oculus SDK checks when launching an app. The Open Gear project tries to create an alternative by building a compatible sensor set and later finding a way to run the software on other phones than the Note 4/S6, but so far they haven't come very far, and it may never work. ""No"" may be a somewhat short answer, but it is still the correct answer. Only apps ported by the developers from Gear VR to Cardboard SDK like Titans of Space will work on other phones."

GoogleCardboard,39pnff,Sh-t_Shower_Shave,11,Sat Jun 13 15:10:19 2015 UTC,Yes.  The main purpose of the cardboard is to hold the lenses in front of the phone. They are what goes the assistance of distance and depth.
GoogleCardboard,39pnff,riplikash,-1,Sat Jun 13 15:24:07 2015 UTC,Its still cool if it isnt though right? even to have two of the same screen in both eyes creates a cool feeling doesnt it?
GoogleCardboard,39pnff,trkh,4,Sat Jun 13 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"Not really. You can't focus on something an inch from your face, and the pictures are distorted because they assume you have a lense."
GoogleCardboard,39pnff,riplikash,5,Sat Jun 13 20:02:10 2015 UTC,"To correct some ideas:  The primary purpose of the convex, not concave lenses is not to allow you to focus on the phone at a short distance, this is just a side effect. The most important job of the lenses is to enlarge the center of your vision sufficiently that the images the left and right eye see no longer overlap. This enables stereoscopic vision and VR, and is also the reason why there is an optical divider between the lenses in Cardboard. Due to the small IPD (eye-to-eye distance) it is necessary to move the eyes very close to the phone to avoid overlap, closer than you'd usually be able to focus on, so the lenses help there too.  And yes, it is possible to see 3D with Cardboard apps without the lenses, but it isn't trivial, doesn't work within Cardboard and is only useful as an impressive experiment how flexible the brain is. Separation of the images is still necessary, so you'll need something that can be used as an optical divider, e.g. a piece of Cardboard about 15cm/6"" wide. Place it on the phone between the two images, so each eye will only see one image. Go to a completely dark room, so there are no other image parts that could give the brain a hint about the real perspective, then look ""through"" the phone. Initially you will see two different images, but with some trying (close the eyes for several seconds) it is possible to get the images to slowly move closer to each other until they merge into one 3D image. Which will be so small that it is completely useless."

GoogleCardboard,39jnyo,Monkoton,6,Fri Jun 12 04:55:57 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Use the Cardboard Unity SDK  They are slightly different concepts. The Android SDK is more what you'd expect from an SDK if you have experience with Java: it provides a number of Java interfaces and classes that deal mostly with stereoscopic rendering and head tracking, but provides nothing else that would support building 3D applications. You could either use OpenGL directly or use a game engine like jMonkey.  The Unity SDK comes as a plugin to the game engine Unity 3D, which already provides everything you need to build 3D applications. A developer already using Unity can create a Cardboard app by simply attaching a single script to the main camera. There are of course more and better options, the Unity plugin sits on top of the Android SDK and basically translates it from Java to C# in Unity, with adding a few goodies like gaze control.  I have been programming in Java for a long time, only started using Unity and C# for VR, and clearly prefer the Unity version. In theory you are more flexible with the Android SDK, but you have to build everything yourself. Unity in some way constrains what you can create, but provides so much of the basics that you'd be insane to start from scratch if you want to develop a typical VR experience. If you are aiming for something very special like procedurally generated demo scene like experiences or already have an established game development pipeline, the Android SDK will be better.  For most new developers the Unity way will be a lot easier. The tutorials provided by Unity are actually very, very good. A Java background will help picking up C# quickly, alternatively one can use JavaScript (slowly being phased out, it is better to stick to C#) or a visual programming system like PlayMaker that is powerful enough to create full fledged games like Dear Esther.  Unity Personal Edition is free for commercial use for entities that generate less than USD 100K in revenues per year. Since the release of Unity 5 many features important for VR that were previously restricted to the Pro version are now available in all version, and the latest 5.1 release puts a focus on VR, mostly for Oculus Rift so far, but even mentioning Cardboard SDK:   UNITY FOR VR AND AR  Designed from the ground up to support a range of hardware, Unity’s VR/AR API allows you to handle all your platform-independent settings. Plus, Unity also comes with built-in support for Oculus-Rift-specific features and one-click Oculus Rift deployment.  In addition, Samsung Gear VR and Microsoft HoloLens support are on the way, a Unity-developed Morpheus plugin is available directly from Sony, and further unannounced platforms are in the pipeline.  While we’re busy working to provide an integrated and optimized VR/AR development experience with our partners, Unity extensibility also allows any third party hardware manufacturer to develop their own plugins and SDKs.  You won’t get all the benefits of the new optimized pipeline, but you can still use Unity to create an impressive VR/AR experience. Third party plugins already available include the Steam VR SDK, the Cardboard SDK for Unity, OSVR and MergeVR."
GoogleCardboard,39jnyo,faduci,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:41:04 2015 UTC,Can unity only be used to create games?
GoogleCardboard,39jnyo,jellevdv,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"No. The main use cases are interactive 2D/3D experiences that rely heavily on graphics and audio reacting to user input, games, VR experiences or art installations being typical examples. But you can also create things like non-interactive machinima movies with cinema assets that are intended to create game cut scenes.  In theory you could use Unity to develop a word processor, which would be about as smart as using a Porsche to plough a field, there are much better tools for this. The 04:07 non-game showreel from the Unity showcase page demonstrates some industrial uses, but e.g. for architecture and interior design visualization the Unreal Engine is better due to its superior lighting."

GoogleCardboard,39hck7,faduci,7,Thu Jun 11 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"This is by far the best written & most level headed summary/response to the stream in all of the VR related subreddits I am subscribed to.  I was similarly disappointed with the situation regarding input. Oculus have been telling us for years how important input is, how hard it is, and how much time, money & effort they have put into solving it. For them to reveal their first consumer HMD without bundling it with the result of that investment is saddening. For them not to  even demo the Touch controllers made me cringe. There is HTC/Valve with fully functional best-in-class tracked hand controllers, which have already been demoed to the public at trade shows & are now even in the hands of select developers, while Oculus could only shown us what may as well have been a non-functional 3D printed prototype.  Though, after the initial knee jerk reaction/disappointment, I reflected upon the fact that for many VR experiences a 'traditional' gamepad isn't just a viable option, but actually the preferable option. I can't imagine playing a cartoony third-person VR platformer using the HTC/Valve controllers - I would want a familiar gamepad."
GoogleCardboard,39hck7,cjdavies,4,Thu Jun 11 21:40:34 2015 UTC,"This was a press conference, demos of the Touch will be given during the next week on E3, so it isn't just a non-functional dummy. I actually believe Oculus that they have been working on it for a long time and came up with a good solution. As it is supposed to be available a few months after CV1, the reason for not including it with CV1 cannot really be that it isn't sufficiently developed. They delayed CV1 for a very long time, missing the 2015 holiday season. If hand tracking would have been considered essential, they could easily have waited for three more months, so this has to be a tactical decision.  My guess is that the primary reason is price: they have given a price range of USD 200-400 and to establish a VR platform, they have to sell huge numbers. Currently everybody is pointing at the Vive as sort of proof that these controllers could already be included, but these may come at a prohibitive high price. HTC hasn't given any price, the developer program isn't open, and the lucky few who got a developer unit got it for free. According to HTC the Vive will come at a ""slighly higher price point"", which probably means more than USD 500. Maybe a lot more. We'll see how many of those now saying they will pick up a Vive instead of a Rift will actually do so, if Oculus manages to keep the price below USD 300 due to the simpler input solution. Vive and CV1 come from different directions, Valve wants to cater to the high end gamers on Steam, Facebook wants to own social VR.  Similar important to the price may be that standing up and waving around your arms is great for immersion and an incredible cool concept, but most Rifts will be sold to gamers that so far could reduce their physical activity to sitting and moving a mouse a few inches. Very few people would be able to play Skyrim for more than a few minutes if it include a lot of live reenacting. The Kinect is also a very cool concept, but it works only with a very limited set of games that only a few gamers were actually interested in. I'd also bet that while Sony already has positional controller tracking with the PS Move, most of the games for Morpheus will actually use the PS4 controller (which has at least gyros and accelerometers, but might support positional tracking too).  So using the XBone controller is a boring, but safer and probably smarter bet. They can keep the price down, every user gets the controller that many of the games currently developed for the Rift rely on. Games can use established control mechanisms, the users don't have to relearn. Enthusiasts who really want the Touch could add them a little later for e.g. USD 75 per hand. Touch can linger in that corner for a while until prices come down and developers have learned how to create experiences for it that are attractive beyond an initial WOW effect. And in a year or two the roles are reversed: Touch gets bundled, the gamepads is available as add-on for ""legacy experiences""."

I'm personally quite happy that the Rift will come bundled with a gamepad, and I can easily see the spillover effects among the other VR platforms as you mentioned.   Sure, it can be a fun challenge to see how much can be done with very little in the way of input, but the fact is that many players get tired of holding their hand up to their headset to interact with it, and it simply opens the door to more functionality with a gamepad handy.  It's not the hand-tracked VR we all want, but that'll come soon enough.  Anyway, I've bought several wireless gamepads for Android to test and add support for them, and I keep coming back to the Red Samurai Gamestop gamepad.   It's dirt cheap, easy to charge, easy to turn on and off, connects quickly, has all the controls you expect, etc.   If you've previously been hesitant to buy a gamepad due to cost, this is the one I recommend hands-down."

Not supported on iOS, somewhere between useless and annoying on Android, unless you only ever want to use one app in Cardboard.  The magnet switch disturbes the compass in the phone, which Cardboard SDK interprets as a button.

The FoV of about 55° is too low for immersion in VR. They are okay for movies, actually better than Cardboard.  A simple rule for buying any viewer to be used for VR: everything currently available for below USD 50 that isn't either a direct Cardboard clone or the VR BOX is crap (for VR), do not buy it.

Both Android and iOS camera apps ""listen"" to certain keys, ""Volume down"" triggers on Android, I forgot which key code is send on iOS. So unless a VR app is checking for these key presses, either nothing happens or the default function of the key like ""Volume down"" is evoked in the OS. AFAIK no VR apps support them directly.  On Android you can run a background app that catches the key press and translates it into a faked screen tap which works the same as pulling the magnet switch. But this a) only works if your phone is rooted, b) requires you to use something like Headset Droid to fetch the key or button and c) Tasker to virtually tap the screen. Not really worth the trouble, cheap bluetooth remotes that also work as gamepads and mice (allowing clicks for screen tapping) are a better alternative."

The controller works out of the box on Android, is way more useful for VR as it worked with (almost) all VR apps that have gamepad support, and with a simple flip of a switch it can be used as a mouse to ""tap"" the screen, which Cardboard apps treat just like pulling the magnet.

GoogleCardboard,39akpd,DanD3n,3,Wed Jun 10 13:08:55 2015 UTC,"There is no single answer to this. 360° videos are supposed to surround you, so you want a viewer with higher FoV, possible the VR BOX (> 90°). For regular movies the higher magnification required for a high FoV is actually bad, because it introduces more distortions. You can use a virtual cinema app that will sort of render the image correctly, but if you are more interested in watching the movie in high quality than sitting in a virtual cinema, surrounded by empty seats, the Baofeng Storm II (< 60°) is probably a much better choice. This is a viewer designed for watching movies with a low FoV that blows up the image like a large screen TV in front of you, not wrapped around you, and it is very comfortable to wear, a lot more comfortable than either Cardboard or e.g. the ColorCross.  Even though a lot of users apparently use Cardboard for watching movies, it isn't really the best device for this, the requirements for 3D VR and 2D/3D movies are simply different. For someone who wants to do both, a combination of a dedicated movie viewer plus Cardboard may be the best option."
GoogleCardboard,39akpd,faduci,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"This is very interesting. Can I ask you more information?   Would the low FoV guarantee a distortion small enough to use, say, a word processor for an hour? I know it's crazy but bear with me. Sometimes I work on sensitive data and it would be great. Can you suggest some dedicated movie viewer?"
GoogleCardboard,39akpd,amrakkarma,3,Wed Jun 10 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"As the image is split into two halves, the resolution is much lower, so it is kind of wasteful to use any 3D viewer for things that aren't 3D. You'd also need something to stream your desktop in a split view, I don't think this exist for Android. Virtual Desktop is an application that allows using the regular Windows desktop within the Oculus Rift, but the main purpose is to allow starting/configuring VR apps from within VR, not using it for desktop work. A better option for sensitive data are privacy screens like MyPrivateDisplay. These are polarizing sheets of plastic, similar to those used in LCDs and some sun glasses. They act as a sort of FoV limiter, so you can only see the image while looking straight at the screen. Someone looking over your shoulder would see only a black screen. A lot of banks use those on computer screens for employees that talk to customers who could take a glance at the screen. I don't really use any virtual cinema apps in HMDs, but a lot of people seem to like Cardboard Cinema, which is free without any run time limits and supports 2D/3D/180°/360° movies. To simply display SBS video, I use MX Player on Android, also free and capable to show videos in any aspect ratio, important to ""un-squeeze"" many 16:9 SBS videos by playing them at 32:9."
GoogleCardboard,39akpd,faduci,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:52:32 2015 UTC,Would it be possible to use a lens that covers the whole screen instead of using two of them? Projecting on one eye only would be OK for work...
GoogleCardboard,39akpd,amrakkarma,2,Wed Jun 10 21:23:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, this can work. The lenses in Cardboard have to magnify a lot, so that each eye gets a different picture, enabling stereoscopy, so you have to pick other lenses to see the whole screen. The number of lenses isn't really the relevant part, so you can either use one large lens or two smaller lenses, but in contrast to the 5.6x lenses in Cardboard magnification has to be very low, I guess about 2x.  The Cmoar HMD Kickstarter had three switchable optic sets: high FoV (similar to Cardboard), low FoV (similar to Baofeng) and 2D for regular video. The 2D optics seemed to consist of only one large Fresnel lens plus a plastic part to keep the phone at the right distance. Since I had recently ordered a pack of cheap, business card sized Fresnel lenses to experiment with increasing FoV in viewers, I gave it a try by simply holding one in front of a phone with a 4.65 screen.  It worked, but as the Fresnel lenses looked rather blurry when not looking through the center, it worked much better when placing a lens in front of each eye. As both eyes see the full screen, the full resolution is kept and no special player software is required, but due to the low magnification the image is much smaller than e.g. in the Baofeng. The primary problem is that lower magnification means higher focal length, the lenses have to be further away from the screen, in my tests about 90mm compared to 45mm in Cardboard. This means you cannot simply replace the lenses in Cardboard, you'd have to build a matching viewer yourself.  Building something like this isn't difficult, see my second DIY Cardboard assembled and unfolded with all components, improvised in a couple of minutes shortly after Google I/O 2014, before any clones were available. Take some cardboard, add cheap Fresnel lenses, head straps and some foam, and you have a working (but not very good) head mounted viewer for watching regular video for less than USD 5 plus work. The primary use of such a construction would be watching a movie in bed or on a train, neither of which I am really interested in, therefore I didn't try it beyond some short experiments to verify that the concept would work and have no instructions. There may even be similar viewers (besides the Cmoar one) available for sale, I just never looked for them."
GoogleCardboard,39akpd,faduci,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:14:56 2015 UTC,That's a great answer! Thanks! 90mm is a lot but I guess it's still ok...maybe I can try with different fresnel lens to reduce a bit the distance!

GoogleCardboard,39akpd,konstantin_lozev,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:20:58 2015 UTC,"Baofeng produces movie viewers (and Walkie Talkies), but primarily they are a media company and run a large video streaming portal in China, similar to YouTube. So the Storm II is intended to be used with their proprietary media portal application which allows users to watch/rent videos on their video streaming site. VR apps are sort of an extra goodie they mention to sell the device, but they assume that you spend almost all your time in their video viewer, just skipping forward, selecting movies or controlling menus with the remote.  They could have made the controller compatible to a regular bluetooth gamepad, but then it would work for other streaming portals too, which isn't in their interest. The predecessor Storm I came with a Zeemote, a gamepad compatible controller not developed by Baofeng, so they (intentionally) removed compatibility with the newer version. We see these devices similar to Cardboard, but they are intended as part of a media bundle, used to sell streaming services. And they sell a lot of both viewers and streams, about 100K of the Storm I within a few months, replaced by the Storm II about half a year ago, with plans to sell 1M of it in 2015."

If you just want the big screen effect, get something with a somewhat low FOV (like the aforementioned ColorCross).  ps; if you do get the ColorCross, I recommend you also get some foam with it, the cushioning around it's edges is rubber that really doesn't do much and there's nothing at all around the nose bridge area."

The lenses and build quality are very good, it is comfortable and can be used with glasses. Zeiss went a little further and provided a couple of apps that seemingly allow installing/launching VR apps from within VR, something that is missing with Android/Cardboard app. It of course works with other Cardboard VR apps too.  They also have a dedicated SDK that was the first that supported correction of lens distortion in software, which works well for the VR ONE because the phone tray allows predicting the exact position of the screen in relation to the lenses. By now the Google viewer profile generator makes it possible to provide Cardboard apps with information about the physical properties of the viewer, achieving something similar on another way.

GoogleCardboard,39adiw,cjdavies,3,Wed Jun 10 11:59:44 2015 UTC,Hi! I know you want something nore ligjtweight but unity makes things so much simpler...With unity you could layout a horizontal set of buttons in front of the camera and shine a light behind them when the user looks at them. I haven't tried it myself but a good place to start with is the demo scene provided by their unity package
GoogleCardboard,39adiw,zmanx88,2,Wed Jun 10 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by ""shine a light behind them"", but I guess you are referring to a raycast. In Unity you'd use a raycast to test if a straight line hits any objects. For gaze controls in VR you add a collider to the selectable objects and send kind of an invisible laser ray in the direction the user is looking. If the ray hits an object with a collider, it reports back this object, so it is very simple to select something by looking at it.  Cardboard SDK does the head tracking, for a menu like the one in Cardboard app you'd simply ignore the X and Z rotation by setting them to zero in each frame. You can now use the raycast to check if the user gazes at one of the icons and highlight it. A raycast would actually be overkill for this particular case, as you a) know the position of each icon and b) know the Y rotation, so if all your icons are placed on a circle with 15° distance, you only have to compare the angles. The raycast is still a nice option, because it would work in menus where the head tracking isn't restricted and allows to use any object in the scene as a trigger, which is considered good VR design (Don't use GUIs, integrate the controls into the world.)"
GoogleCardboard,39adiw,faduci,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:26:23 2015 UTC,"i didnt mean a raycast.. i was referring to the light effect around each icon in the cardboard app when you gaze at them. I thought you could use an actual light to achieve that effect but just having 2 images for the button state might be better. As far as the gaze mechanism, the sdk already gives you that for free. Just look at how the example scene changes the color of the sphere when you gaze at it"

I started reading through some Android OpenGL ES tutorials & it began to look as though just to learn enough to render a few icons/images in a line/circle around the Cardboard camera would take ages. I opened up the Unity Cardboard demoscene & have already managed to write a quick script that renders items at set intervals in a circle around the camera object & disable the pitch/roll in the camera, using the provided GazePointer script to determine when they are being looked at."

GoogleCardboard,397abf,zmanx_88,7,Tue Jun 9 19:41:45 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: if this is too long to read, don't even try to make money as a VR developer, because it will a very long and hard road.  I'll split it into four sections, continuing the numbering scheme, options already mentioned in italics. The order is just for consistency with the OP, not an indicator of importance.  Donations   One time, e.g. PayPal Donate button (1) Repeated, per release, e.g. Patreon (2) Subscription, e.g. flattr [6]   Direct Sales   Subscription for content (3) In-app purchases for additional content (4) In-app purchases for consumables [7] App store sales [8] Advertising [9] Cross-Sales [10]   Services   Development of custom VR experiences (5) Training [11] Consulting [12] Asset sales [13] Support [14]   Others   Sponsoring [15] Merchandising/Licensing [16] Affiliate programs [17] Journalism [18] Hardware [19]   Remarks on sections/options, order the same as above:   1, 2, 6) Donations: these are hard in any case and you usually need either a very large or a very dedicated fan base. Both require producing a lot of content that the same group will consume over a long time. Not the typical scenario for VR app development, could work for e.g. a photographer creating and releasing great photospheres on a regular basis. 3) Subscriptions for content: similar to donations you need a large base of long term users. Payed subscriptions are dangerous, because you might end up having to invest a lot of time to create new content for only a few subscribers, unless you want to cancel all subscriptions and pay the money back. 4) In-app purchases for additional content: This might actually work pretty well, the biggest problem being low app sales to base them on. Because VR is so much experience driven, people may be enticed to pay for things that allow to experiment with the experience. Strange example: regular FPC is of normal height, child sized avatar and giant available as add-ons. This would never work with a regular game, but as body height radically alters the experience while exploring a world, it might be enough for some to pay just to see the world from another perspective. Sims-like customization will probably generate a lot of money in VR, once longer experiences become usable. 7) In-app consumables: The Dots etc. approach, paying for convenience. This works best for casual gaming, could work the same in VR as anywhere else. Requires a huge user base, as very few will ever pay. 8) App store sales: kind of the most obvious option, but for now pretty hard. Taking a look at the sales for the commercial VR apps listed on the hand-picked recommendations list also shown in Cardboard app, which makes them the most promoted Cardboard apps: Caaaaardboard! 5K-10K, WAA! VR 1K-5K, Eden River 100-500, Nightmares VR 50-100, Proton Pulse 5K-10K, Go Show 5K-10K. Caaaaardboard also exists in (non VR) mobile and desktop versions that cost and sell more, Eden River is well known relaxation experience, not a game, ported from the Rift, Proton Pulse a port of a popular Rift game. Go Pro is a video player, the category that sells the most on Cardboard, e.g. VR Player 10K-50K. The app stores take 30%, all games currently selling in significant numbers are ports that just had to be adapted to Cardboard instead of being newly developed, so they may actually have made some money for the developers. Sales for most VR apps are negligible. 9) Advertising: Some apps contain mobile adds, but these will work pretty bad in a VR-only app, so you'd need parts that are used outside of Cardboard. Also require a very huge user base and long usage periods in which the ads can be ""clicked"". 10) Cross-Sales, here meaning selling non VR versions, spreading developing costs. The best example is Caaaaardboard that also sells as AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for Android and AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome on Steam with optional Rift support. Non-VR apps sell a lot better and one Oculus developer posted that he had stopped mentioning Rift compatibility, because people would buy less, as they were confused if they needed the Rift. 5) Development on contract: may be more lucrative for some time. The wow factor of VR/Cardboard makes it an interesting and cheap tool for marketing, and it doesn't matter that the experiences are short, which in other cases would stop users from paying for it. We've already seen very high quality promotion apps for cars and movies. 11) Training: could be for developers or users. Developers in companies that want to add VR to existing problems may be a market, end users probably only in the context of promotion, e.g. a company hands out Cardboards at a PR event and needs a number of people to sell the Kool-Aid to the participants. 12) Consulting: technical or conceptual. The first isn't really consulting, more free-lance development, where a developer is hired to solve a particular technical part. The second is ""classic"" consulting which requires a lot of project experience and background knowledge. You also need guts, as an important part is telling your customers that their ideas won't work and/or are total crap (and they often will be). As everybody believes that their ideas are brilliant, cutting blue-eyed concepts down to something that could actually work and be done in a finite amount of time isn't popular, but absolutely necessary. 13) Asset sales: VR development is hip, a lot of new developers enter the market, many of them with very limited experience, so there is an opportunity to sell building blocks, an example being No Touch GUI for VR. So far I haven't released a single app, but if I had to re-buy all the Unity assets I've bought since I started VR development, I'd currently have to pay just under USD 2400. I payed less, as many of them were bought during sales, but it was still a lot, so I am very sure that there is a market for selling to developers. 14) Support: You can always try to sell your time directly, e.g. Skype sessions for setting up VR equipment, billed by the minute. 15) Sponsoring: Part of promotion, e.g. Proton Pulse some time ago found a sponsor that ""bought"" a month, during which Proton Pulse was available for free on the Play store. 16) Merchandising: If VR goes big and you come up with the Angry Birds of VR, you'll make more money from licensed plush toys than from app sales. 17) Affiliate: if you can convince a lot of people that they need to buy an Homido on Amazon and they use an Affiliate link you gave them, you'll earn on every sale. Having a successful app allows you to end each session with ""works best with ... (click here to buy)"". 18) Journalism: VR is a new, massively hyped subject, not many technical writes have a clue about it, so there is a market for people who can explain the subject to the masses. 19) You can create your own VR hardware and/or add ons, or find and distribute items produced by others. Cardboard 2.0 is much more retail compatible than the first version, and even if you are a software developer, adding the option to buy some items on your products page might entice some users that want to try your app and need a Cardboard for it. Affiliate links would be the easiest way.   In case you didn't guess: I've spend some time thinking about the subject. A mix of approaches will probably work best. There is a big hype surrounding VR/Cardboard, but not much of a market, the numbers are simply too low. So while an indie developer on Windows might actually have a tiny chance to just release a game and have it go viral, there are simply too few Cardboard users for mouth-to-mouth to work as a marketing strategy. A big part of the job for indies is networking. You probably won't have a huge marketing, so be prepared to interact heavily with your user community on all available channels, and learn to promote your product.  Also make sure you have a plan B, you have to be in it for the long run. Things will change over time, and I am extremely curious how well the Mattel VR View-Master will sell during the coming holiday season, which may send a lot of parents to the Play/App store looking for VR experiences to occupy their kids with their new toy. Parents pay a lot for toys.

As hard as it seems I see there's real possibilities within 2-10 years which is fine for me. For now I'll treat it as a side hobby but not my main gig.

For journals apps I could find an app like the paid version or wait for the price to go down but there isn't that option with vr apps, so yes I would be more likely to buy a vr app"
GoogleCardboard,397abf,tarkam,2,Wed Jun 10 17:34:09 2015 UTC,"Hello, I'm bulding a VR company and have explored a couple of ways to make money via VR. I'm actually looking for VR developers and have even messaged a couple of them but unfortunately have had very bad responses from them. Anyway read on for my thoughts on how I think you can have a secondary form of income from your VR apps.  VR on phones  (the cardboard variation) is very new, very exciting and people tend to love it when they try it, but the problem with most VR apps is that the average user can only use your app for so long until he/she gets dizzy and has to stop using the headset. The way my business partner and I are starting to market VR is for product placement. In my country and in my part of the world (Latin America) , big companies constantly rent floor space of high profile shopping malls where they set up a temporary stand showcasing their product via huge screens, models and product placement. What we do is sell branded VR experiences.   Lets say you developed a cool roller coaster for Cardboard in Unity. We offer our clients your roller coaster by showcasing your traditional app and offer them that they could integrate their product, logos and brand inside your app. It can be something as small as a digital billboard or a splash screen before starting the ride. It's mostly replacing some of the model's textures inside unity and recompiling the APK. For this we charge the company money and create a custom APK (closed source and not for redestribution) for that experience.  So basically they get a cool VR experience that their visitors can use for a couple of minutes , it's great for their PR and word of mouth, and the developer (and us) get to make some money on the side. . So what we are trying to do is get a catalog of games or experiences where the developer could brand the game with our client's logo and products and we help them set up the VR experience on their stand.   With the couple of developers we now have on our portfolio we are looking to book ""VR experiences"" for the rest of the year that could net up to US$125K . I know it's still not that much but it's a start!    Send me a PM if you would be interested in us offering your games as part of our portfolio or you could try and do it yourself. The key is to have high level clients and have worked with them in the past in setting BTL showcases and events."

I'm from Venezuela living in Orlando, Florida.US. So there's a lot of tourism & retail spaces with people from all over the world where this might work. Seems like the apps would have to be designed with the fact that textures and models will be swapped to tailor different brands.  I actually see this working out as long as you can convince the store, I also wonder how much they would be willing to pay for adding VR to their booth for a day... I will send you a PM to further enter the discussion, although at the moment I do not yet have a fully complete VR experience to provide."

We've worked with Carolina Herrera, Google, Ferrari, McDonalds, Pepsi, Nike, etc... this is why we are now starting to offer  VR experiences!  The trick is not convicing the store, you have to talk directly with headquarters and the people charge of marketing. What has also worked with us is when we partner with big name agencies.   It's ok if you don't have any ""full"" VR experiences ready, just let me know when you do and if you would be willing to work this way with our clients!"
GoogleCardboard,396v9x,Spectrabox,2,Tue Jun 9 18:03:55 2015 UTC,"It happens to me as well.  When using a cardboard compatible with 3,5'' to 6'' what you are buying is a cardboard that will fill its entire field of view IF and only IF the smatphone has 6'', and if it is less, you'll see black borders. So, the solution is to use a cardboard meant for up to the inches of your phone.  For example, if your phone is 5'', you have to buy a cardboard that says ""up to 5 inches''."

GoogleCardboard,393dqv,swampgiant,2,Mon Jun 8 23:37:35 2015 UTC,Luckily I just built a VR app with 360 video. Check out CorvusVR.com or message me.
GoogleCardboard,393dqv,CorvusVR,2,Tue Jun 9 00:52:56 2015 UTC,"In this case the 360° video is the more exotic part. Most Cardboard developers work ""conventionally"" with game engines, and for someone coming from game development, adding Cardboard SDK support is very simple, as it basically replaces the main camera with two cameras for stereoscopy and adds head tracking. Game design for VR has some special requirements, but the basics are the same.  Similarly I'd assume that for something largely based on 360° video, the best approach would be finding people who already work in this area and ask if they could support Cardboard too. There are already a number of 360° video producing agencies, e.g. http://www.konceptvr.com who offer 360° video production and VR development. Since the entry barrier for 360° video is much higher than for Cardboard game development, hiring such an agency might be most efficient way to get a project going, as they would only have to alter a few details in their workflow to also support Cardboard."
GoogleCardboard,393aci,InfamousCthulu,2,Mon Jun 8 23:11:39 2015 UTC,An alternative/supplement to using scotch tape is placing a twisted tissue on the cardboard as detailed in this post. It protects the cardboard from oils from your face and protects your nose.

Found a bunch of other Vocaloid cardboard apps (f.ex. this developer had a bunch of them), but the one I linked to was particularly interesting because you can ""initialize"" it on any image/surface you want, and Miku will do a dance show on top of that image. (Though if the image is not clear enough, the tracking might get confused.) Kind of fun when it works, in any case.  Would be cool if more games used AR, though even Nintendo didn't really do more with that idea besides the AR demos that came with the first 3DS... Image/surface tracking is probably still too resource-intensive for use in actual games."

I had found a lot of very good reviews for it (in Chinese), so it is definitely the safer bet. Unfortunately the SVR Glass didn't show up on the usual sites for months. On suggestion Gearbest added it to their line of products for USD 58.74, which is a lot more than you'd pay within China on e.g. taobao, but so far they are the only ones selling it internationally.  One remaining problem is that there are two versions, one including a bluetooth remote on the headset itself, the other not. The reviews I found were for the first (because it shipped first), Gearbest sells the second. I assume that the FoV is be the same in both, and because all the other bluetooth remotes that came with Chinese 3D viewers where not compatible to gamepads anyway and required special software, it probably isn't a loss.  The SVR Glass allows only adjusting lens-screen distance while the VR BOX also features adjustable IPD, but this is less of a problem now due to configurable IPD in Cardboard SDK and the larger lenses used. The ""sliders"" used for adjustment in VR BOX will be harder to adjust precisely than the screw based solution in the SVR Glass. Phones are mounted similar to the way the Homido does it in SVR Glass and in a tray similar to the VR ONE in VR BOX. A tray can be better if it fits your phone exactly, because it allows putting it into the right position very fast, but it makes it very hard to move the phone once it is placed in the viewer, which is easy to do with a clamping mount.  So assuming they both feature a similar FoV, they are both valid options with different strengths. Based on my experience with Aliexpress I hope that I will receive my VR BOX in June, but there is no guarantee and it could arrive in July, so at least waiting for my review will require some patience."

The padding around the face looks different than the Vietnamese video and different than pictured on aliexpress.  Interesting, wonder if they have multiple manufacturers?  It almost looks like the plastic ring that holds the lens has a plastic tab that could pop open with a jeweler's screwdriver.  Might have to give that a try when I get mine.  If the FOV is as narrow as you say, and it appears as looking at a 4:3 tv vs a 16:9, it'd be nice to have an easy way to swap the lens out with a higher magnification one of the same diameter and bump up the FoV, albeit at the cost of increased screen door."

GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,profa42,2,Tue Jun 9 14:58:23 2015 UTC,"I did, but so far it doesn't show anything. That is kind of expected. I've ordered a lot of stuff from China, they usually provide some kind of tracking number, but in many cases it turns out to be rather useless. Often they only work while the package is still within China, and for the first few days after shipping they aren't shown, so rather often I never get any tracking because the package is out of China long before the tracking site would have registered it. Somewhat strange, but after spending a lot of time trying to figure out the system I simply gave up and now just wait until the package arrives. So far everything showed up eventually, even if it took up to six weeks."

GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,bios_hazard,2,Wed Jun 17 16:12:51 2015 UTC,"Why what's the FoV on the cardboard? I was thinking today about how the field of vision on my cardboard being not very wide is the reason I'm struggling to feel like what I'm seeing is ""reality"".   I understand the screen size has a lot to do with it but the lens should be able to provide you with as much FoV as they want as long as the apps are working with them too.   I'm curious though, did you find that Google Cardboard is better than other viewers using the same techniques? Does that include all the unofficial cardboards or just the Google cardboard?"
GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,rushmore69,8,Sun Jun 7 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Up to now Cardboard and clones (no difference between them) were much better for VR than any viewer below ~ USD 60  The effective field of view depends on a number of factors: screen size, lens magnification, and as limiting factors lens diameter and eye-lens distance. Including eye movement, humans have a horizontal FoV of up to 270°. Without optics that wrap around the eyes, it is impossible to display 180° or more, and due to a number of technical constraints, the best compromise for FoV is currently about 90°-100°, which is what most VR head mounted display are aiming for.  If the FoV is too low, the world stops feeling real. There are a number of cheap plastic viewers available that were designed for watching movies on a phone. Their lenses generate an image that looks like a big TV screen, so for their intended purpose they work fine, but the impression in VR apps is similar to looking at the world through a window, not being in the world. The cut-off for immersion depends on the individual users and a number of other factors, but in general about 75° will be required.  As FoV practically means how much of your eyes vision is filled with the image, you can increase it by several measures: increase the image size, i.e. use a larger phone, or use higher magnification. By picking the right combination of lens and screen, you could get the same FoV with every phone. In reality that doesn't work so well, because higher magnifications introduce a lot of distortions. A larger screen is therefore better up to the point where each eye sits exactly above the center of its part of the screen, so there is another sweet spot that depends on the distance of your eyes.  All regular Cardboards and clones use lenses with 25mm diameter and 45mm focal length, the later being another way to express a 5.6x magnification. With the largest phones you can use in Cardboard you can get up 80° FoV (there are no ""official"" numbers, because there is no fixed FoV). If your eyes are so far away from the lenses that you cannot see the screen borders, you are losing some of the image, thus reducing effective FoV. This can be prevented by a) using lenses with larger diameters and b) moving the eyes closer to the lenses.   HMDs like the Oculus Rift use a fixed screen size with larger lenses using higher magnification on lens mounts that place the lens close to the eye. For them it makes sense to give a fixed FoV. Some phone based VR viewers like the Homido and (possibly) VR BOX also use higher magnification lenses and lens mounts, but any FoV given in the specs is the highest value you can achieve in that viewer, so it is only valid for the largest phone the viewer can handle. Cardboard tops at about 5.5"", Homido at 5.7"" and VR BOX at 6.0"". A top value of 100° in both the VR BOX and Homido would mean that the effective FoV in the Homido is larger for a specific screen size than in VR BOX. FoV and screen size scale roughly linear, so the given FoV can be translated for viewers that measure their FoV assuming different screen sizes."
GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,bios_hazard,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:26:23 2015 UTC,"From the google cardboard talk from the 2015 I/O conference:  Nexus 5 + Cardboard: 12 pixels per degree, 85 degree FOV  Nexus 6 + Cardboard v2: 13 pixels per degree, 100 degree FOV  Ideal would be: ~60 pixels per degree, ~210 degree FOV"
GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,bios_hazard,4,Mon Jun 8 15:09:32 2015 UTC,"Google cleverly avoided comparing Cardboard 1.0 and 2.0 under the same conditions (screen size). In v2.0 they changed a number of things that influence the FoV, but the one thing they didn't change (according to Unofficial Cardboard) is the magnification/focal length of the lenses, which is still 5.6x/45mm and therefore should result in the same FoV. The new Cardboard blueprints (which specify the focal length) still aren't out, so we don't really know yet if the new lenses use higher magnification.  Already known is that besides allowing using larger phones, they increased the lens diameter from 25mm to 37mm, which limits the keyhole effect that reduces FoV. One interesting change that has gone pretty much unnoticed so far is that Cardboard 2.0 has a larger nose hole, my best guestimation from the pictures is 37mm instead of 30mm height. This would mean that someone with a larger nose can move Cardboard closer to the eyes, again reducing the keyhole effect. So the increase from 85° to 100° could be achieved without using different lenses the lenses, and if you used e.g. a 5"" phone in Cardboard 1.0 and the shape of your face allowed you to get close enough to the lenses to see the full screen, FoV wouldn't increase for you with the same phone by switching to Cardboard 2.0."

GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,racife,2,Sun Jun 7 02:30:34 2015 UTC,"The catch though is the Note 4 is 5"" wide, but the Homido view area is only 4,1"".  This means almost an inch of display is cut off, so the image has to be even smaller to compensate for this.  This means less display resolution dedicated to an image already split in two.  Homido needs to offer a frame bezel that is thinner and truly fits larger display devices."
GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,perrycox86,2,Mon Jun 8 03:20:55 2015 UTC,"Not quite as bad, the Note 4 has a 5.9"" screen (5.14"" width) and the Homido supports up to 5.7"" (4.97"" width), but you will lose some of the screen area in the Homido. 5"" is recommended as the best screen size by Homido.  EDIT: Turns out that the 5.7"" compatibility mostly means that you can squeeze a 5.7"" phone into the Homido, but a lot of the outer pixels will in fact not be visible with larger phones."

GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,phrase,6,Sun Jun 7 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"I order a lot of stuff that hasn't been reviewed, some of it turns out to be useless, so I tend to go for the cheapest seller to keep losses low. I also try to keep orders below the amount at which the custom office asks me to drive across town just to open the damn package, which takes more than an hour. The price for the one I ordered was just below that limit. Due to my low price policy, I rather often buy from ""new sellers"". It is mostly useless to compare their ratings, as just one bad rating of a total of 20 will reduce the score by 5%, there are simply to few data points to distinguish this from noise. These rates are only useful if there are at least a couple of hundreds of them, and in my experience new sellers are not only the cheapest, but also attempt not mess it up, since they are desperately seeking to get more good ratings, because otherwise buyers who play it more safe will avoid them.   So I'm taking a higher risk in both picking untested products and unestablished sellers, but all in all it has worked pretty well so far and I get a lot of interesting gadgets very early for a low price."

Something interesting I found on the multiple listings for this headset on ebay - The lenses are apparently 42mm diameter.  This is even bigger than the cardboard v2 specs (37mm).  Once again, I'll believe it when i see it.  I've seen listings like this before on ebay, and they're often copy-pasted from others' poorly translated specifications and riddled with errors.

GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,linkup90,2,Tue Jul 14 03:31:21 2015 UTC,"Received mine today, can confirm again that this has low FOV when used with most phones.  IF you had a very large phone (maybe the Nexus 6 or iPhone 6 Plus if they fit, Note 4), it would actually have decent FOV. But with any normal phone (mine being an LG G2) it's just like looking at a big screen. edit: It's not even that wide with a Note 4.  I'm also disappointed that the holding mechanism is just held together by clips which look like they'll wear out quickly (quite a contrast from the build quality of the rest of it), and that the design prevents you from using it while the phone is in a case.  However I do think this can potentially be modded. Would have to think through this, but the following might work:  1) Tack large diameter, lower magnification lenses on the inside of the lens mounts.   2) Remove the interior box enclosure (secured by screws) and dremel the center mount down. That would give space to mount a ~5.2"" phone closer.  3) Put thick foam or the like in the holding mechanism, which would push the phone closer. Result would be two sets of lenses separated by ~.75"", and the second set would ~.75-1"" away from the phone."

I can't fully test it until I put something in there to hold the phone, but at least I know I can get the phone closer. I just wanted some info in case I need to look for a different lens once I'm done.  I know next to nothing about combining lens and how it affects focal length etc so now I'm looking for replacement lenses that can focus at a closer distance. Also going to take a closer look and see how difficult it is to take the lens out and if it even is possible to do without destroying the adjuster parts. Even if I can find the right lens it would still be easier if I had a larger phone screen. 5"" phone moved all the way in, you can still see the edges, but you can move it in a bit farther and that should make a replacement with the same diameter a good match."

GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,karstux,2,Mon Jul 6 14:45:06 2015 UTC,"My lenses are plano-convex on the VR Box. Are you saying the lenses you got on the VR Box are biconvex?  By the way, I received the lenses from the seller. They are plano-convex. I don't have a laser pointer to test the focal length, but they turned out to be perfect for this mod. A little difficult to mount perfectly but the resulting FOV is much bigger and more clear than cardboard."
GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,Simeonico,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:29:22 2015 UTC,"No, mine are certainly plano convex. I thought the ones you bought were biconvex.   A simple way to test the focal length is to take a ruler and place it pointing straight outward in your view through the lens, then just take something else like a pencil that you can move along the ruler, moving it forward and back until it comes into focus, once in focus move to the side while holding the pencil in place and you have the distance at which objects will focus with that lens. Make sure this is done in the center area of the lens.  Sounds like it worked out for you though so I have a backup. I found a pair of 44mm lens that should be great to switch out. Right now I'm just using a sponge cut in half with a half on each side of the phone to mount it in place, works."

And usually there are lower limits below which you don't have to pay any duty, and a minimal amount below which customs will not bother collecting even VAT, because the collection process would be more expensive than the VAT to be payed.

Of the other available phone based HMDs with a FoV larger than Cardboard the Vrizzmo (EUR 60) is the only one with a buttons. It actually has two, one on each side, that AFAIK work in the same way as the new button in Cardboard 2.0, e.g. they are capacitative levers that allow touching the screen from outside the case, so they work on phones that have troubles with magnets. The Homido (EUR 70), I AM CARDBOARD XG (USD 80) and Zeiss VR ONE (EUR 129) all come without any input solution.  You can get an external button that sends a mouse click  (USD 20) for the XG (will work with any viewer), or an external magnet switch (USD 9) that you could also build with a pair of existing magnets from Cardboard within a few minutes. An interesting alternative is this tiny bluetooth remote/gamepad (USD 7) that works as both a gamepad (you want at least one for any HMD) and a mouse."

As it is placed on a product sticker that otherwise contains certification labels like ROSH and CE, it might simply be the name of a certification (that I can't find either).

GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,profa42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:14:49 2015 UTC,"I don't have the Homido, so I sort of ""believed"" the claims that Homido makes about usable phone sizes on their compatibility page, and never bothered to check what exactly this means. They lists 89mm - 126mm/3.5"" - 4.96"" width as compatible. The optimum width is given as 111mm/4.37"", which is close to the 4.1"" you mentioned, assuming a few millimeters being lost anyway to the vignette often used to soften the edge. I've now looked at some reviews on Amazon, and they confirm what you wrote about severely limiting the visible image in large phones.  My definitions of optimum and compatibility usually do not amount to everything above the optimum being partly cut off, but I have to admit that I never thought about what optimum might mean besides ""highest FoV with best use of pixels"", which would fit the 4.1"" visible width. So far I assumed that compatibility implied full screen visibility, not only the options to fit the phone inside the case. This kind of topples my whole strategy on comparing FoV in different viewers, making it close to impossible to derive any useful values without measuring the focal length of the lenses with e.g. a laser pointer yourself.  As if things weren't complicated enough already. The 16:9 aspect ratio of phone screen isn't ideal anyway, as you end up with two 8:9 images for the eyes, so if you can see the full width, you waste 1/9th of the pixels at the top/bottom, if you see the full height, you lose 1/8th of the horizontal FoV, so there isn't really an optimum, only a compromise between losing pixels and losing FoV. In reality it is worse, because the FoV for each eye is different in every direction, with the one going outwards being the largest. The Freefly VR viewer (USD 84) uses lenses with different vertical and horizontal magnification to achieve a 120° FoV without wasting a lot of resolution, but as a consequence all apps that do not support this will look squished, currently not a particularly useful solution."

Most of what I know is already in the thread I've linked too and in the review linked from there, I haven't tried the Freefly myself. With support up to 6.1"" the Note 4 should work, and in contrast to Homido who somehow forgot to mention that screens larger than 5"" will be partly cut of, FreeFly states: ""The larger the screen size, the greater the immersion, but great results are still achieved with phones featuring smaller display sizes.""  The Freefly would most definitely use more of the screen of the Note 4 and feel more immersive than the Xiaozhai with only about 55° FoV (I have one of these), and for streaming the atypical aspect ratio might actually be solvable. I don't use Trinus VR (or any other streaming solution) myself, simply because I am not really a gamer, but if you can set a custom display ratio and FoV in either the game, the 3D injector or Trinus VR, it should display correctly on the Freefly with a very large FoV.  The value of the hassle is kind of subjective. Currently all streaming options are seriously limited by technical constraints, e.g. limited to 720p, so you cannot get anywhere near to the quality of the Oculus Rift, but a lot of users seemingly are willing to live with that and quite happy (while others rip it as unusable). Setup isn't very difficult, and you can try the free test version that will stream for a few minutes before buying.  Thanks for the praise. I'll actually take the reddit gold. I've been gilded before, and the main benefit was that reddit shows which comments are new in a thread visited before. This is so useful to keep up with large threads that reddit permanently gave this option to all mods for their subreddits, so I am kind of always on gold on /r/GoogleCardboard.

GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,rushmore69,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:59:02 2015 UTC,This HMD really looks interesting and I'm thinking about ordering one to give it a try. Before I found this discussion I was thinking about getting a Homido but the pricing is pretty high for a bit of plastic with lensens. So this one looks like an interesting alternative. Can't wait for your first reviews if you get this one.  Right now I have a colorcross and use it with my S3. I'm aware that the resolution of the S3 istn't the best for a good VR experience but I'm planning to buy a new phone soon (G4 or S6). Mostly I want to use the HMD for 360 Videos and on the colorcross it's ok but not really good. It just doesn't feel like you were in it. It's more like looking into a box.  Does anyone know if the slightly curved screen of the G4 may cause issues with a VR experience?   Thanks faduci for your detailed comments. I finally understand the details for VR HMDs much better now!
GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,PickleFart9,2,Mon Jun 8 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"The FoV in the ColorCross is a lot more limiting for VR that the 1280 * 720 resolution, but quadrupling the pixel count will without doubt improve the experience. At least in theory a curved screen like the one in the LG G4 should be an advantage for VR (two curved screen, one for each eye would be even better, two spheres wrapping around the eyes would be best). The focal length of the spheric lens determines how far away from the lens the screen should be, but with a flat screen projecting onto the spheric retina, screen-lens distance actually varies with view direction. A curved screen could reduce this effect. There are aspheric lenses that are much better at reducing a number of artifacts like varying focal length, but these are a) more expensive and b) would have to be matched to a specific screen and position, so phone based viewer don't features particularly optimized optics, the adaptable eye does a large part of the job."
GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,redoutreddit,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:04:45 2015 UTC,Thank you again for your detailed explanations. So you think the slightly curved screen doesn't affect the VR/3D experience in a negative way?  I guess I will try a new HMD as soon as possible with my S3. So the VR Box or the SVR Glass might be a godd and not so expensive choice. I found this article about the SVR Glass but the comments aren't pretty good about it. http://www.cnet.com/news/meet-the-svr-glass-headset-a-cheaper-galaxy-gear-vr/ We'll see.
GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,PickleFart9,2,Mon Jun 8 20:30:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, curved screen should be fine.  The comments to this article weren't really directed against the SVR Glass, but the ridiculous claim that it is a cheaper Gear VR. Oculus added much improved external sensors and a ton of optimizations to Gear VR, so it plays in another league than regular VR viewers used for Cardboard apps like the SVR Glass or VR BOX, which basically only provide a comfortable way to strap two lenses and a phone to your face.  The FoV and comfort may be similar to Gear VR, but I seriously doubt that even the lenses are anywhere near as good in a product that sells for 1/8th the price, and the Oculus optimizations are what really makes the Gear VR worth the USD 200 for Samsung Note 4 and S6 owners. Cardboard and Homido are better benchmarks for other phone based viewers, so the author of that article was rightfully flamed for making clueless comparisons."
GoogleCardboard,38uf2e,redoutreddit,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:51:25 2015 UTC,Thank you.   Yes this comparison doesn't make much sense. Too bad the gear vr is linked to a s6 or a note 4. After almost 3 years with my S3 I wanted to try something different then Samsung. I also don't like the S6 with all the glass and no sd card stuff.   But I guess it doesn't make sense to buy a phone just because of gear vr. The other upcoming HMD's look pretty interesting to me and even if the experience isn't completly the same the immersion will still be good. So I'm pretty curious about the upcoming reviews for the VR Box.

GoogleCardboard,38tcfb,konstantin_lozev,2,Sat Jun 6 17:20:05 2015 UTC,"This basically exists, there are already a number of projects that use a second phone in a similar way, by querying the gyroscope in that phone and also reading other sensors like accelerometer and the touch screen, which can be used for buttons. There is even a Unity asset to do this. The problem with this approach is that the gyro only replaces a single analog stick on a controller while requiring to hold the gyro mouse/phone parallel to the ground in a stable position, which is a lot more trying than moving the sticks with the thumbs on a controller that can rest in your lap or moved around if the arms get stiff.  Almost all other new input schemes for VR aim tracking not only rotational, but also positional data, to allow the users to see and use their hands in VR, which greatly enhances immersion. They use either IR tracking (PS Move), magnetic fields (Razor Hydra), some kind of volumetric camera (Kinect, Leap Motion, Nimble) or light runtime measuring (Hive), but all of them require an absolute reference point in space to determine the position, something that isn't easy to achieve in a simple, handheld device. Kinect-like sensors are now integrated into phones (for Google's Project Tango), these will enable in-device positional tracking."
GoogleCardboard,38tcfb,faduci,2,Sat Jun 6 20:07:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I will try and take your points one by one. (1) Second phone. The use of a second phone sounds very interesting, not so much for the gyro (another phone with a gyro is already around 150-200 EUR, so not in the same price range, but even 50 EUR phones do have good touchscreens), but for the touchscreen. Can you link me to a working solution with an .apk and instructions that would enable that? Do you need WiFi for that solution (I  guess so, which is not a big, but still limitation)? Or can it be done similarly to a Windows Virtual Router? Another limitation of phones is that they have no buttons nowadays, so the demo would be impossible to finish with a phone (2) Motion controls vs gamepad. That's an argument beyond this thread. You have a preference for gamepads to motion controls. The gyro mouse has a similar functionality (different tech in the standard wiimote) to a wiimote when used as a pointer and I would argue that the wiimote is much more natural (not perfect though) than a gamepad, which is even more important for VR. Give me a platformer and I am all in for a gamepad, but give me a shooter, golf game or physics game and I would always go for motion controls. (3) Positional tracking. You are right, I mentioned that in my post and I am perfectly aware of that. I think that we are at least 5 years away from a working optical solution for positional tracking in Mobile VR (that excludes using hacked Vive controllers, since you have to carry around the base strations). And I'd say even more, since even none of the Mobile VR headsets has positional tracking itself. If your headset has no absolute positional tracking it would not be very useful to have it only on your motion controller. (4) Project Tango. It's amazing tech on its own, but I think the mesh builder does show the latency and depth perception resolution are still insufficient. At this moment that would not enable even lag-free positional tracking of the headset itself, see https://youtu.be/iP9m9a2KEN4?t=35m38s, let alone tracking small fast-moving objects in front of it (hands/fingers). In 5 years, though, it looks very, very interesting for Mobile VR."

No, I have no APK, because I considered the concept to be not particular useful in the first place and therefore never spend any time investigation the pros and cons of different implementation. Not sure why the ""motion controls vs. game pad"" is beyond the scope of the thread. You may have decided that motion control is the only option you like, so you only leave the choice between gyro mouse, phone and Wii Mote (ignoring the PS 3/4 SIXAXIS gamepad controller that has a gyro and accelerometer), but the thread title refers to ""mobile VR control scheme"", so a comparison to existing controllers was inevitable. As both your hands and your head are connected to your body, hand tracking doesn't actually require positional tracking on the HMD, relative hand-head position is sufficient. A Leap Motion mounted onto Cardboard can do this already (badly, if you have access to the alpha release Android SDK). In general HMD positional tracking is easier than hand tracking, so it is unlikely that we will see the later first, but both most likely won't take five years to arrive. Tango in its current incarnation isn't intended for hand tracking, but the basic technology is the same, so it is very likely that a few phone generations down we will see both positional and hand tracking realized by the same dedicated sensors in mobile VR. Due to the extremely limited VR use cases for a gyro mouse I am pretty sure that gaze based controls and gamepads (including Cardboard button input) will remain the dominant input forms till then, the rest only used experimentally."

I'll be shorter this time: (1) You started with ""This basically exists"" and now you are like ""never spend any time investigation"", I think the touch options are really interesting; (2) Everyone his own, this is a post for a proposal for a New Mobile VR control scheme, not how it compares to gamepads, as I said, to some maybe a gamepad is preferable, but I dare to say that gamepads are not as good for the scenarios that I mentioned; (3) You have a point there, it should be possible to have positional tracking in the headset's coordinate system and then we naturally go to (4) I think we are both converging around the 5-year mark. On your last point ""extremely limited VR use cases for a gyro mouse"", I will have to disagree, 99% of the desktop VR stuff uses a regular mouse, so tracking along x and y axes has proven actually the opposite of ""extremely limited""."

GoogleCardboard,38td3e,Xifar_,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"I've used Trinus VR, it's pretty decent.I could never get the USB mode to work with my phone though.  I tried Intugame once, but it didn't do the barrel distortion thing."
GoogleCardboard,38td3e,faduci,3,Sat Jun 6 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"A large part of the lag comes from streaming the data, either over WiFi or USB 2.0, with USB being faster. The bandwidth of USB isn't large enough to transport the image uncompressed, so it has to be compressed on the PC, transferred via USB and decompressed on the phone, which severely limits the usable image resolution.  There is some discussion if Trinus VR does a good or bad job at streaming over USB. I don't know if anybody actually streams more than 720p with any software, but any other streaming solution like duet display (which I don't know) will be bound by the same hardware constraints. This may improve once (more) phones support USB-C with USB 3.1 speeds, which would a) be much faster and b) includes a DisplayPort channel that could transfer uncompressed 8K video. It remains to be seen if the DP channel works only from phone to PC/TV or in both directions.  Getting the gyro data from the phone sensor takes about 8ms, transfer over USB to the PC about 1ms, this is a small part of the total latency, so using another type of tracking wouldn't significantly reduce lag. And while the gyro is queried about 125-150 times per second (already slow compared to 1000 times in Oculus products), IR tracking uses cameras that record only 30 or 60 pictures per second, introducing a lot more lag than the gyro and increasing the chance of nausea. IR tracking has several other disadvantages, e.g. you have to ensure that you always stay within the view of the camera, which Oculus solves by placing a lot of IR LEDs on the front and back of the Rift DK2.  The big advantage would be positional tracking, allowing sideways movement, while the gyro only provides rotational data. Positional tracking can significantly reduce nausea for some, so the ideal combination for Cardboard would be the faster rotation data from the gyro plus the position data from the IR tracker, which would also correct any drift.  But I'm afraid the available streaming options are about as good as it gets until we get better hardware, and IR tracking could only be used as a (valuable) add-on."

The cardboard versions of google cardboard are mostly superior to the plastic versions. Also you could buy these: http://m.gearbest.com/mount-holder/pp_168951.html which you can easily attach to your cardboard. This makes using it a lot easier so that you don't have to hold it up all the time. I would also recommend using some scoth tape on the places where the cardboard touches the face because it sits more comfortable and you can easily clean it to prevent grease marks.

Basically, you'd have to be holding the controller up directly in front of your face the whole time.  Edit: just tested the range that my phone's camera can see. At arms length, you have about a 6-8 inch square of range. Not gonna work.  Neat concept, but no chance of actually being useful. For this to work well, you'd have to have a camera lens with an FOV comparable to the HMD you are using it with - that's a wiiiiiiiiiiiiide lens, not something that any phone has."
GoogleCardboard,38nmiw,In_Film,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"Basically, you'd have to be holding the controller up directly in front of your face the whole time.   Like you'd do with a gun. Which is probably the reason why the controller grip is shaped like a gun and the demo app uses a (bubble) gun. It certainly cannot be compared to something like the hydra and has a very limited set of use cases, but for these it could be fun. Pretty sure you could play something like portal with it, which would be enough for many.  The primary problem of a small tracking area would be that it would be very easy to move the hand out of the tracked area, and it would feel weird if the virtual arm suddenly stopped while the real arm is still moving. Could be solved by a matching UI, i.e. the arm becomes transparent the moment tracking is lost. Oculus recommends something similar for situations where users to physically impossible things, e.g. fade to black if the user sticks his head inside a wall.  RealTrigger is a very limited concept and would require experiences designed within its limits, but as we are using phones with slow, uncalibrated sensors and pieces of Cardboard strapped to our faces to experience some kind of VR, we are obviously willing to deal will primitive solutions, even if the experience they provide is extremely restricted."
GoogleCardboard,38nmiw,In_Film,2,Fri Jun 5 20:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess a gun would be the use for which it would work best. I'm not a fan of shooting games, so even though I read ""gun"", I realize now that I was thinking about more of a general purpose controller.  Maybe part of the package could be a snap on wide angle adapter lens. There are some decent ones that don't cut resolution too much.  You always have good insights, thank you for sharing them :)"
GoogleCardboard,38nmiw,SETHW,2,Fri Jun 5 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. I had thought about the wide angle adapter lens, but have no clue how well this would work. Marker detection relies on finding straight edges and corners, so anything that introduces significant geometric distortion would be a problem. As your background in cinematography probably comes with a lot more experience regarding the distortion introduced by wide angle lenses, you are in a much better position than I am to estimate if this could be an option. Reduced resolution shouldn't be that much of a problem, as the marker will always be at arm's length distance, AR apps can detect sufficiently large markers that are much further away."

GoogleCardboard,38kezv,faduci,7,Fri Jun 5 12:34:46 2015 UTC,"I have the iDroid:con, and it a very nice controller that works with most of the Cardboard apps that support a controller. It was the first bluetooth controller compatible with the gamepad support introduced in Android 3.X, so initially many apps required one. Unfortunately the Unity game engine, which is used for most VR apps, changed controller support some time ago, leaving only the analog sticks and the ABXY buttons accessible. You probably won't run into any problems with existing apps, and having the iDroid is nice because it can also emulate a keyboard and mouse, so you can use it as an alternative to the magnets in Cardboard (mouse click = magnet pull).  Button mapping in gamepads is a sad modern horror story anyway, so there is no perfect controller that works flawlessly everywhere, but other controllers have the advantage that all the controls are accessible for VR apps, even if almost none of them make use of it. Current recommendations are the Red Samurai and Lemon S600, both fully supported in the current version of Unity. Technically they are identical, but the cheaper Red Samurai is only available within the USA from Gamestop and often sold out. I'll update the wiki.  And reposting an incomplete list of apps with controller support (all tested with iDroid):   Shadowgun VR, VR demo scene from the game Shadowgun Refugio 3D Space Station, exploring a space station and the planet below it Alien Apartment VR, a virtual apartment to explore The Height: multi-level game about collecting cubes and not falling of edges, was better before they introduced magnet support, as one could control movements speed, now movement is too slow Lapso, a world breaking down while you are walking through it SpaceTerror VR: this one made me jump pretty high when I realized ""something"" was there Tuscany Dive, exploring a villa in Tuscany, classic Oculus Rift demo Hall of Fear VR - Demo, simple horror game Stellar Dive Experience VR, multiple games/demo in one, forgot the details 4 Rooms: commercial, for a long time considered to be the best game available for Cardboard/Durovis Dive, and the only game that also supports the right analog stick for rotation. Angry Bots SBS, a VR adaption of the Unity mobile game demo project Angry Bots that works great in first person. The game will give you roughly half an hour of exploring and shooting at angry robots, and is fun enough to do this several times. Only available as APK from the developer."

They're held between two folds in the eye assembly. They're a little loose but I haven't had them fall out of place while using it.

I've posted about the FullDive in April, back then they were preparing a Kickstarter and the estimated delivery time was September 2015.  The advantages the OP mentioned are mostly marketing babble, the FullDive isn't really a replacement for Cardboard, at 628g/1.39lb it is heavier than even a Gear VR with Note 4. The weight comes from the Sony Morpheus like head mount, so it may actually be very useful for those using Trinus VR for Android or VR Streamer for iOS to stream games from a PC. These require less head movements and the fact that FullDive will not press against the face, instead distributing the weight of HMD and phone on the top of the head, will make it more comfortable for longer play sessions. The just need to sell it to the right audience."
GoogleCardboard,38lbbq,faduci,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:46:51 2015 UTC,"Trinus and such apps have awful latency. It's really not acceptable for halfway decent VR.  If people are looking for something lower cost than Rift/Vive/Morpehus, they'll just go down the OSVR route."
GoogleCardboard,38lbbq,Heaney555,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"The OSVR will have the same face strap approach as all the other HMDs, and will be just as (un-)comfortable for long play sessions. I trust Sony that they spend a lot of time thinking about comfort, because this is what sells the PS4 (and potentially the Morpheus), so the non-face touching mount is kind of the unique selling point for the FullDive. I agree that streaming even via USB is a pretty horrible solution, but a lot of users like and use it nonetheless, and you can get it running for less than USD 15 if you already have a phone and PC. OSVR still targets USD 200 and the initial reactions from those that tried it weren't all that great, we'll have to see how it turns out."

GoogleCardboard,38igig,InfamousCthulu,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:12:30 2015 UTC,"I've tried to figure this out for some time, but never found out who the manufacturer is. The generic name makes it pretty hard to find any useful information, all I find are seller pages, all showing the same few images. My Chinese is (almost) non existing, and unfortunately most of the descriptions on sites like taobao are only embedded in the pictures, so to extract anything I usually have to take a screenshot of the text, run it through an OCR and than through Google translate, which in most cases creates some very ambiguous, error riddled marketing babble.  The reason why I kept searching is a single image:  http://img01.taobaocdn.com/imgextra/i1/68022398/TB2KBSBcVXXXXXgXXXXXXXXXXXX-68022398.jpg  Run through the OCR this results in   视场角度 95一100度 带给你身灵其境的3D体验   Run through Google Translate:   Field of view 95 to 100 degrees Bring your spiritual body immersive 3D experience   So it might be 95°-100° FoV for a 6"" screen. Compared to this Cardboard provides about 80° with a 5.5"" phone. The VR-BOX would provide about 87° - 92° with the same 5.5"" phone, so it would show about 10% more FoV than Cardboard. More important than having a higher FoV than Cardboard would be that it at least wouldn't have one much worse, like almost all the cheap plastic viewers with ~ 55° I've bought so far.  In the end I caved in and recently ordered one, adding to my already large collection, but it probably will not arrive for several weeks. It may be very interesting, but be aware that all this is based on a single picture and a very flawed way to extract information from it, I've seen neither specs nor reviews. I will post a review here once it arrives."

Mostly cause I, personally, want to see your thoughts on all the ones you've tried.  haha"
GoogleCardboard,38igig,dronpes,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:00:53 2015 UTC,"Counting every VR viewer with head straps, I currently have six, waiting for the VR-BOX, plus a number of Cardboards and a large collection of lenses and failed experiments. I bought most of the viewers for modification, knowing they weren't directly usable for VR, so many of them have altered lenses to improve the FoV. I've already posted a lot about them and the modifications, but the short version and my usual answer to this is ""Don't buy any of them, unless you want to tinker with them or use them for movie watching only"".  A VR related site is in the making, which will initially consist mostly of updated posts I've written about VR in the last few years. I recently copied all of my posts into OpenOffice to get an estimate how much I had typed, and ended up with 360 pages. A lot of that is about basics, e.g. what influences FoV, technical limits, what causes nausea etc., so subject that are all still valid. The plan to do this isn't exactly new, which is why I had a copy of all the posts that I could paste into a word processor.  It will not take the form of a Wiki, simply because most Wikis tend to become very unreadable, just large, inconsistent collections of partly random subject and links, not weighted by importance. What I want is a structured resource accessible for those new to VR with a ""the basics in 5 min"" section and compact explanations of the most important subject, many of which I've already written a lot about. The initial motivation for this was that some questions pop up all the time, about an hour ago I explained IPD adjustment in Cardboard for probably the 20th time, so creating something that I can refer to myself would simply be more efficient.  There will be a section about viewers, but it will mainly be ""ignore them"". I've taken pictures of the viewers and the modifications, they will all end up on the site. Reviews will become more interesting once there are more viewers out that are actually usable for VR, up to now Cardboard was simply the best option if you weren't willing to pay more than USD 60 (Homido, VRizzmo, XinGear). This will change within the next few months.  I will make no promises about when the site will be ready, not even that it will ever be, but I'm working on it."

If you're looking for a hand getting that content organized and published, I'd be happy to join you.  It could easily be done in a Reddit Wiki (see /r/DigitalConvergence/wiki/start for an example of one I'm working on), but if you're looking to launch a standalone site I'd be game to help with that as well.  This has become a huge passion project of mine.  I'd be happy to PM a bit more about myself, but suffice it to say I would have no problem creating, launching, and hosting the site.

There were already custom versions available (different colors, covered in PU leather, with headstraps etc.) The ColorCross and similar viewers were available before Cardboard, sold for watching movies on smartphones. 2014-09-13 (Day 80) First threads about Cardboard clones from TinyDeal for USD 3.66 with free shipping appear. I ordered several immediately, but was already somewhat late and was informed by TinyDeal on 2014-09-18 that they had been completely overrun and I would receive the Cardboards from a second batch a few days later. The product page indicated that they were sold old. As promised they shipped my Cardboard on 2014-09-22, so creating the second batch didn't take long. 2014-09-14 (Day 81) A hugely popular thread on /r/Android announces the TinyDeal Cardboards, there are hundreds of ""I bought X"" comments. My guess it that TinyDeal sold a five figure amount of clones within a few days. 2014-10-10 (Day 107) Several of mine arrive at different locations in Germany. 2014-10-11 (Day 108) TinyDeal posts an image showing a room full of boxes filled with Cardboards on their products page to prove that they are trying to fulfill all the orders. It looks like 100 Cardboard per box, 65 boxes visible, so at least 6500, more likely 25,000+. (I went looking for that image today and Google directed me to my own thread about the newly arrived clones.)   I'm pretty sure the TinyDeal Cardboards were the first big wave of clones, but thanks to the blueprints creating clones was very easy, all you really need is a (laser) cutter. The biggest problem was getting lenses, I went through several types in DIY clones, procuring these would have caused the biggest delay for clone makers. This is not a problem today, but in contrast to Cardboard 1.0 the new version isn't a kit that has to be assembled by the user, instead it comes in a retail ready box, meaning there is a lot more setup and expensive machinery involved in getting Cardboard 2.0 clones out. The fact that Cardboard is already considered a success will make it easier to justify the necessary investment, but the entry barrier to produce the new version is much higher due to manufacturing costs. The materials in 2.0 might even be cheaper than 1.0 due to the missing magnets.  And for some giggles: My ""Cardboards"" before clones were available:   SBS viewer based on iPad, build on day 0 DIY Cardboard using magnifying glasses from Amazon, a few days later HMD based on Cardboard blueprints using 25mm/45mm FL lenses, a few weeks later, after I finally got my hands on the USD 10 lens kit for the Durovis Dive that Google recommended for DIY Cardboards, causing it to sell out immediately. Cutting the Cardboard took more than an hour."

I'm using note 4 and I need to squeeze it in without case. Occasionally it will press onto the volume or power button which is irritating.   I'm not sure what this means exactly. Due to the construction of the SVR Glass there shouldn't be any limit to how wide (in the viewer) the phone can be, but the bracket pressing the phone against the viewer will limit the height. The Nexus 6 is even larger than the Note 4 with 159.3 mm × 83 mm × 10.1 mm compared to 153.5 mm × 78.6 mm × 8.5 mm, so even though the SVR Glass is supposed to support 6"" phones, the Nexus 6 may be too large. The FAQ for SVR Glass do not mention any exact dimensions for supported phones, only a 4.7"" - 6"" range, so it may be better to wait for some reviews."

But 3D effect is inferior compared to Colorcross"
GoogleCardboard,38e3hf,Farren246,2,Fri Jun 5 00:42:50 2015 UTC,"I'm sure 96 degree FOV is with a 6 inch phone, as FOV on phone-based HMDs is highly dependent on what phone you put in it - so long as the HMD design properly supports it, then bigger phone means more FOV. I think that's why the Go4D C1-Glass underwhelmed me with my Nexus 5.  I'm curious what the FOV is with a 5 inch phone, as I will never be stuffing a 6 inch phone in my pocket. I'd be surprised if the FOV with a 5 inch phone is any better than original Cardboard (and probably worse), but that's pretty speculative I admit.  I really think all the latest designs are intended to be used with bigger than 5 inch phones :("
GoogleCardboard,38e3hf,Farren246,2,Wed Jun 3 23:34:12 2015 UTC,"The same is true for the Homido, which is advertised with 100° FoV and supporting phones up to 5.7"", and Cardboard, which provides up to 80° for a 5.5"" phone. If you use a phone that is smaller than the maximum size the viewer can handle, the effective FoV will decrease. For an FoV up to 100° the FoV should scale (roughly) linear with screen size, so using a 5.5"" that provides 80° FoV in Cardboard would reduce the FoV in SVR Glass by about 8% to 88°. As this is larger than the FoV in Cardboard, SVR Glass has to use lenses with higher magnification than Cardboard. For a 5"" screen you'd get 80° in SVR Glass and 72° in Cardboard. So the FoV would be larger in SVR Glass for any phone, but to get the maximum FoV of 96° you'll need the largest phone the viewer can handle.  In reality there are other factors besides the screen size and lens magnification that influence the FoV, all of which limit how much of the rather large FoV of the human eye is actually filled. One of the most important is eye-lens distance, and this is where Cardboard really fails because the lenses are placed in a flat plane. You cannot get very close, so combined with the small diameter of the lenses the maximum size of the screen you can use is simply limited by the construction. If you can see the borders of the lenses in Cardboard, the (too) large eye-lens distance is what limits your FoV. Cardboard 2.0 actually improves FoV simply by having a larger/higher hole for the nose, so you can get closer. Homido, SVR Glass, Gear VR, DK2 and several other all use elevated lens mounts to move the lens closer to the eyes, and also lenses with at least 34mm diameter, making sure that the ""keyhole"" effect isn't limiting the FoV.  Considering the higher magnification of the lenses and the improved mounting of the lenses, it is pretty safe to assume that FoV will be better than in the original Cardboard, even with a suboptimal 5"" phone. In the end the FoV given for any HMD always means ""highest value achievable under the right conditions"", not ""you'll get this value, no matter how you use it""."

GoogleCardboard,38e3hf,dabotsonline,3,Wed Jun 3 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"Short remark: You cannot simply use VLC to watch a regular 2D video on any of the viewers. The whole purpose of the construction is to send different images to the left and right eye, so you need to either watch videos that already come as side-by-side with two images, as all 3D movies do, or use one of the many VR cinema apps available for Cardboard that will take a regular video and split it so it is displayed twice, once for each eye. A simple VR video player that can do this is part of the Google Cardboard app, but there are others with more functions. The disadvantage is that only half the screen resolution is available for each of the images. But this doesn't interfere with your plan, which should work without problems.  There is one danger of using a viewer in bed: people have fallen asleep in VR and scared themselves shitless when they woke up in a different world, due to drowsiness not instantly realizing they were still wearing the HMD."

GoogleCardboard,38cc66,mptp,20,Wed Jun 3 08:27:38 2015 UTC,"Just some background about motion-to-photon latency: It describes the delay between the time you move your head and a new image that shows the altered view arrives at your eyes. This is critical, because the brain compares the image to its own rotation measurement, which comes from the vestibular system in the ear. If the results differ too much, the brain basically assumes that you ate something poisonous (which would mess up your sensory system) and suggests throwing up as a counter measure. Getting sea sick below the deck of a ship works similar, because you feel the movement, but the walls stay still.   There are several other things that can contribute to nausea in VR. People react very differently, some can stomach pretty much everything, others feel sick after seconds. Brendan Iribe, the CEO of Oculus VR, is one of the persons who are very sensitive and said that the latest Crescent Bay prototype of the Oculus Rift is the first one that he can actually use for more than a few minutes.  The latency occurs because several steps are required to generate the image:   Reading the rotation from the gyroscope sensor. This takes about 8ms in a phone vs. 1-2ms in Rift/Gear VR, which use special firmware for the sensors. Rendering the actual picture. Depends on hardware speed. Sending the image to the display. The usual organization of smartphone displays first ""collects"" several parts of the image and then switches the whole image. This reduces tearing effects, but introduces one frame/17ms of latency. Pixel switching time, i.e. frequency of screen update, usually 60Hz, so up to 17ms again.   Given the very rudimentary state of mobile VR I was surprised that the image showed ""only"" 75-85ms latency. ""Typical"" motion-to-photon latency for the Oculus Rift DK1 at 60Hz is about 50ms, for the DK2 running at 75Hz and Gear VR at 60Hz it is below 20ms, which Oculus considers the latency at which most people will no longer be effected by it. To achieve this they implemented a number of tricks. In Gear VR they altered the Android OS to skip the collection in step 3, removing 17ms of latency. And after the image is rendered, they query the (very fast) sensors again and move the image slightly sideways to match the rotational change that occurred during rendering. Gear VR software is also allowed to stop the CPU/GPU from entering power saving modes to guarantee that enough performance is available for step 2. It is expected that Google will implement similar improvements in their Android VR project.  Google is aware of the existing problems, which is why they call Cardboard ""bite-sized VR"" and recommend using it for shorter experiences. Cardboard is deliberately designed to be hand-held, as having your arms up to hold it slows the rotation speed, thereby reducing the probability of nausea. The requirements for the ""Works with Google Cardboard"" certification explicitly state that manufacturers mustn't include headbands if they want to display the certification marker."
GoogleCardboard,38cc66,faduci,2,Wed Jun 3 11:03:21 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent rundown of MTPL. I'm actually in the process of writing up a huge technical document for the less tech-savvy of my colleagues (VR startup), and made this video while writing up my own little section on MTPL.  I didn't know about the 8ms figure for gyroscope sensor readings on Android - do you mind if I ask you for source on that figure? I'd love to be able to include it. :)"
GoogleCardboard,38cc66,faduci,2,Wed Jun 3 11:38:37 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the exact source, but I am pretty sure it came from the context of the Foculus tracker firmware project. They reverse-engineered the DK1 tracker, which uses an IMU also used in smartphones. The only difference is that the typical firmware queries the sensors at 150Hz or 125Hz (hence the 8ms), because this is sufficient for normal operation, but the sensors themselves can sample at a much higher rate. The top sampling rate for any IMU should be rather easy to determine with a short program that queries the sensor 2000 times each second and then checks how often the reported values actually chance during rotation.  IMU boards with integrated ARM CPUs like the STM32F3 discovery board (similar to DK1) are available for about USD 15, and altering the firmware to query the sensors at 1000Hz like DK1/Gear VR is relatively simply. But as the IMU contains a separate processor, this change cannot be achieved with a change in Android, basically the IMU is running its own OS that AFAIK cannot be updated after production, which is why the Gear VR required the external sensors (they also calibrated them individually to reduce drift). Hopefully future VR optimized phones will simply come with IMU firmware that supports higher sampling rates out of the box."
GoogleCardboard,38cc66,faduci,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:59:26 2015 UTC,"That's some interesting stuff - thanks!  That sounds about right with the sensor polling rate, perhaps I'll just put that in my report and leave out a source for now. ;)  I'm hoping Samsung leads the charge on optimising phone hardware for VR support - I can't imagine how hard that sell would be for a VR-minded executive at Samsung. But hopefully little changes like gyroscope polling rate or drift calibration will get through in the near future. :)"
GoogleCardboard,38cc66,jd2504,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:05:03 2015 UTC,"I assume that the primary reason for the currently restricted rate was that higher frequencies increase computational and therefore power costs slightly, and before VR there simply was no practical use for them. So I'm actually pretty sure we'll see a lot of phones with higher sampling IMUs, simply because it only requires a firmware update, and it would be easy to integrate an additional option to switch between a VR and a normal, power saving mode. Being able to market a phone as ""VR optimized"" will probably provide enough motivation for manufacturers."

Depending on where I stopped and started it, I got anywhere from 18-21 frames. Each frame is 1/240 = 0.004167 seconds, so that gives a latency of 75-87ms"

GoogleCardboard,38c95j,mptp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:31:29 2015 UTC,"you'll be able to buy a Rift and a PC to run it for the price of two smartphones pretty soon! :)   I assume this refers to the USD 1,500 Oculus mentioned as the expected price for a sufficiently fast PC and the Oculus Rift vs. two smartphones in the Note 4 class, which is used in the first Gear VR. That is quite a lot and most people will not be willing to spend anything near that, considering that there isn't that much yet that you can actually to with VR equipment.  The price of Cardboard is appropriate considering the minimal costs for devices able to run Cardboard software. The Galaxy S2 with 4.3"" @ 800 * 480 sells for about USD 45 on ebay with a performance well below the slowest phone listed as supported by Google for the initial Cardboard, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus with 4.65"" @ 1280 * 720, which sells for about USD 65. Recommended as a usable entry level for current cardboard apps would be something like the LG G2 with 5.2"" @ 1920 * 1080 for about USD 130. The LG G3 with 5.3"" @ 2560 * 1440 most certainly will provides a much better Cardboard experience than the Galaxy S2, selling around USD 270.  I still question if viewers that cost almost as much as a used phone are worth it, esp. since the experience largely depends on software and phone anyway, so the advantages over Cardboard aren't groundbreaking. The experience you will get from Cardboard will in no way be able to match the Oculus Rift CV1, but neither will the price for a usable setup."

A $1500 buy-in for desktop VR vs. two $750ish smartphones. I agree that most people aren't going to be willing to spend anywhere near that. I disagree that there isn't much yet to actually do with VR equipment, however - there are easily 50+ full games that support DK2 already, and I imagine Oculus has a large list of release titles. There's going to be a heck of a lot more content compared to a new console release.  But I agree - Cardboard is very good for the price. A new phone able to run all Cardboard content will set someone back under $300 definitely, under $200 perhaps. It's a real shame that there aren't any reasonably priced headsets that are comfortable enough to be used for long periods of time with decent quality, but I stand by what I said about the two options.  $5 Cardboard is great for the price, but you can't sit and watch a 3D movie with it. All the $10-$30 Chinese plastic headsets are absolute garbage, and there's nothing in the $40-$100 range at all. So the only choice if one wants a better VR experience than stock Cardboard, but doesn't want to go ahead and buy a Note4/S6 + Gear VR or a DK2 is to buy an overpriced 'premium' Cardboard viewer."

GoogleCardboard,38c95j,Xifar_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"Would you mind to list some of the apps that worked decently on the Galaxy SII? Even though it is pretty much underpowered, there are probably a number of readers here that have similar phones and would like to give Cardboard a try nonetheless.  As the requirements for VR apps are actually increasing, having a short list of some apps that still work  on low end phones would be nice. There are a few that by now are rather old, but they support ancient hardware with old OS versions and are still worth a try. I've seen the following running on an iPhone 4 sufficiently well to be usable:   Refugio Space Station (explore a space station and planet) - Android 2.3/iOS 6 The Height - multi-level game across high platforms - Android 2.3/iOS 4 Dive City Roller Coaster - Android 2.3/iOS 4   You have probably tried a lot more. Because you used your S2 with Cardboard for a year and now can compare it to the LG G3, you are kind of in a unique position to comment on the lower end options for Cardboard, so you could help others looking for these a lot.  As for the ""higher end"" options: Homido (adjustable IPD, EUR 69), VRizzmo (stacked lenses, capacitative button like Cardboard 2.0, EUR 60, XinGear (should just have started shipping, USD 79) and Cmoar HMD (ships in fall, USD 99) are the options for now. All but the Homido support phones larger than 5.7"".  The 96° FoV SVR GLASS that was funded on a Chinese crowdfunding site a few months ago is now listed on taobao starting at CNY 100/USD 16 plus shipping. It is bound to show up on sites like Aliexpress sooner or later, initially probably around USD 50, but with other similarly priced viewers the price dropped to about 50% above the taobao price with free shipping after a few weeks. The Cardboard compatible Mattel View-Master, also featuring a capacitative button is expected in October for USD 30, which will set a marker for useable VR viewers and drive down prices, so the situation will improve in the next few months."

GoogleCardboard,38c95j,Minnesota_Winter,0,Fri Jun 5 01:16:18 2015 UTC,"i have a g2 and a g3 that i use for cardboard. My lg g3 is terrible, maybe it is just my model, but there are major issues with it and VR. Using apps like the fibrum rollercoaster or cmoar viewer, the view jumps around and changes position when i turn my head. ive recalibrated my gyro and accelerometers and VR player works well, but most other vr apps are unusable bc of it. I love the G2 though, wish it had sd card access."
GoogleCardboard,38c95j,google_search_expert,2,Wed Jun 3 14:56:11 2015 UTC,"hmm, I don't have any issues with my G3, VR experiences run smoothly.

GoogleCardboard,38acyw,s505,3,Tue Jun 2 22:38:18 2015 UTC,"At least one of the mods has thought about it, but so far the only change I've made to the CSS is controlling hovering for autowikibot comments. My primary objective would be increasing readability, for this reason I like e.g. the /r/Unity3D theme better than the default reddit theme.  As other things like the dire state of the FAQ are waiting to be fixed, the subject has no priority assigned. /r/virtualreality/ recently updated their ""CI"" and asked for submissions for a new header, which resulted in very few responses, and the result is now harder to read, so I am not sure how many actually care about this, but the discussion is of course welcome."
GoogleCardboard,38acyw,spiral6,3,Wed Jun 3 01:16:18 2015 UTC,"I mean, even Snoo could be wearing cardboard.  Mockup (probably make cardboard thinner): http://imgur.com/Za7Way1."
GoogleCardboard,38acyw,faduci,0,Wed Jun 3 02:43:11 2015 UTC,"That was my initial thought too, but this is kind of the obvious solution and /r/oculus and /r/virtualreality already use a Snoo wearing a very similar looking HMD, so it doesn't really distinguish /r/GoogleCardboard from other VR themed subreddits. Also Cardboard isn't really intended as an HMD, which is partly a strength. E.g. it is very easy to pass Cardboard around in a group, giving everybody a quick ""wow"", so it is more social than e.g. the Oculus Rift, and it would be nice to reflect these differences. (I also think that Cardboard would be the perfect device for a specific type of local multiplayer games to be played by drunk people at parties, but maybe the header shouldn't reflect this.)"
GoogleCardboard,38acyw,faduci,2,Wed Jun 3 03:03:29 2015 UTC,I think something that reflects the style of the official cardboard site would look fine. A solid orange header and white text + a centered white cardboard logo would probably look decent IMO.
GoogleCardboard,38acyw,faduci,5,Wed Jun 3 01:30:59 2015 UTC,"Google uses orange as a theme color for Cardboard, probably because it looks similar to Cardboard and brown would look literally like shit, but the white on orange design on the Cardboard web site is kind of a breach of good layout practice. Bright text on a darker background is always harder to read, and actually placing a thin font in white on the also very bright orange background completely kills contrast and readability, visible esp. in the footer, so I wouldn't consider this a particularly good template.  reddit is text driven, with a lot of often changing, small paragraphs that have to be distinguished. The ""job"" of the theme is to make things distinguishable, including immediately identifying the subreddit by its look, but also visually separating the different building blocks, directing the view to the most important parts and keeping the focus on the actual content. Creating a solid header in a signal color like orange pulls the attention towards the header, so I don't think that adopting the style Google picked for their Cardboard site would be particularly reader friendly.  It works on the Cardboard site because the reader is supposed to scroll down, hiding the orange, so the bright color functions as a the start and end indicator for a long page, but on reddit the header is visible a lot of the time. Google kept the theme in the text heavy developers documentation, and there the permanently visible orange top bar is very distracting. This doesn't mean that a header for /r/GoogleCardboard mustn't contain any orange, it just shouldn't be ""in your face""."
GoogleCardboard,38acyw,faduci,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:17:39 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, there probably should be some orange accents though.   the font weight against the orange doesnt have to be that light, in fact I agree with you on that part."
GoogleCardboard,38acyw,spiral6,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:31:52 2015 UTC,"We could steal the Works with Google Cardboard certification label, alter the text to ""Discuss Google Cardboard"" and include it in a banner. The certification label integrates the Google Cardboard logo and will appear on a lot of devices, so it should be very recognizable. Not sure how Google would like that though."

GoogleCardboard,388meu,gearbest_peter,3,Tue Jun 2 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"The head straps are actually pretty good and were sufficiently popular to sell out after being linked from reddit recently, which seems to have triggered the Virtual Reality Flash Sale."
GoogleCardboard,388meu,faduci,2,Tue Jun 2 19:15:56 2015 UTC,"I do agree. They are good for watching movies (I own the Ritech I and Ritech II, the newer one is a lot nicer), but their FoV of about 55° vs. 80° in Google Cardboard means immersion in VR will be very bad, esp. with smaller phones. You'll be looking at kind of a giant screen instead of being in the world. That is why they are actually better (and more comfortable) for movies than Cardboard, but without modifying the viewer, VR feels a lot more ""real"" in Cardboard. For someone who wants to watch a lot of movies on a large, virtual screen, they can be a useful addition to Cardboard, but not a replacement.  [DISCLAIMER: I contacted GearBest after they posted that there would be a Flash Sale and recommended they announce it on /r/GoogleCarboard too. I also warned them regarding the plastic viewers that for VR ""most of them will be ripped to pieces due to their low FoV"".]"
GoogleCardboard,388meu,faduci,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:29:19 2015 UTC,"Do you know of any higher FOV models in the same price point as the ritech, or are those yet to come out?  Someone in another thread posted a config QR for the Ri-II and said it had a big FOV.."
GoogleCardboard,388meu,s505,3,Tue Jun 2 19:32:58 2015 UTC,"There are none yet. A number of Chinese manufacturers are working on them, but similar to the currently available phone based VR viewers with higher FoV staring at about USD 60, these are more expensive and not yet available internationally. SVR GLASS and VR BOX look promising and some of them are now listed on taobao at prices not much above the Ritech II (they were at about USD 45 a few weeks ago), but unless you speak Mandarin and know someone in China, it will be complicated, expensive and due to a lack of reviews somewhat risky to order one. Basically we are waiting for these to show up on sites like GearBest.  As for the QR code: you can enter whatever FoV you like in the viewer profile generator, and the Cardboard SDK will render an image that would have the correct size if your lenses provided that FoV, but that doesn't change the magnification of the lenses. The Ritech and others are designed for watching movies, and for this purpose the lower FoV is actually better. Many of the viewers are sold in China with dedicated virtual cinema apps and remotes. The market for movie viewers is simply a lot larger than the one for VR, because few people actually have large screen TVs, so using something like the Ritech II with a smartphone is a pretty compelling option, and you can use it for VR too, it is just not as good as Cardboard for that purpose.  Technically it would be pretty easy to create a version of the Ritech with 90° FoV, there simply isn't enough demand yet (as in millions of buyers). Baofeng announced that they expect to sell one million Mirror/Storm II in 2015, that is the same number for just one viewer as all existing Cardboards together (according to Google, there are probably more than one million Cardboards out there, but only a small fraction of them is actually used), and about four to five times the number of all Oculus Rift sold since 2012. VR is still a very exotic niche technology."

Android Sisters: A Virtual Reality Ghost Story, a horror experience. Android Fibrum Roller Coaster VR, a roller coaster. Look at the lever to start. Android Cmoar Roller Coaster VR, USD 2.99, a commercial roller coaster, but a very good one, worth the money. Android Crazy Swing VR, another ride. Android VR Jump Tour, a strange app using 360° video recorded with a drone. You can jump/swing very high by acutally jumping or at least standing up very fast. Takes a long time to load the video data after the first start. [iOS only]  War of Words VR, a VR poem experience, companion app to a BBC documentary, very short. Android   Exploration   Refugio Space Station, a spacestation and planet to explore with auto-walk (look at your feet) Android Tuscany Villa, port of the classic Oculus Rift demo, (auto-)walk around in a villa in Tuscany Android London VR, a 360° photo based tour through London Android   Games   InMind VR, playable teaser for a brain themed shooter. Android The Height, a rather old game with multiple levels, the objective is to collect cubes, fast on slow phones, still interesting due to the use of height which is always impressive in VR. Android Froggy VR, a cartoon style kid friendly multi-level game involving eating flies and hopping around a pond. Android Virtual Kaiju 3D, USD 0.99, a strange commercial VR rampage game, played as a Godzilla like monster. You have to roar into the microphone to spit fire. Interesting primarily for the weird concept. Android Zombie Shooter VR, a shooter on rails. Android Moorente, simple duck shooting game. Android   Music   Paul McCartney, a virtual concert in 360°. Android Kris Menace Virtual Edition, sort of a VR music video. Android   Viewers   Vrse, a viewer for very impressive 360° videos available from within the app. Android Homido 360 VR player, stereoscopic movie, 360° video and VR web browser, working with YouTube [iOS only] Mobile VR Station, a movie viewer. [iOS only)] VR ONE Cinema, virtual cinema Android (there are better ones for Android)   The last two I included just for completeness, there may be better ones available."

GoogleCardboard,385wdu,yeahThatJustHappend,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:01:04 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to me at first, but I was able to fix it by moving my phone to the side a bit. You basically have to make sure that the split between the two pictures on your phone is exactly where the cardboard division between the two lenses is. Hope I helped!"
GoogleCardboard,385wdu,ChillinKillin247,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"I tried shifting it left and right slowly while looking through. It got blurrier as it slowly moved left or right. At the clearest spot it is clear looking directly ahead but the picture immediately around that is blurry even with one eye closed.  Example: (o) If that was the lense then inside the o would be clear while outside the o is blurry.  Is that normal? Also, the clear o itself is very small so it's more like (.) than (o).  I'm wondering if it's because these lenses are cheap and plastic. Are there glass ones that are better?  The effect works great, but the blurriness makes me motion sick so I can't use it."
GoogleCardboard,385wdu,In_Film,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"That is not normal. Something is wrong, but from your description I cannot tell what it is.  Did you perhaps get the lenses dirty/smudged during assembly?"
GoogleCardboard,385wdu,In_Film,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:23:12 2015 UTC,I tried cleaning them off with an exhale and a clean cloth. This seems like more of a focus blur though. The cardboard I have does not have adjustable eyes and it's the 1.0 version. I think my OnePlus One fits well enough but maybe not? Or maybe my eyes are too wide or narrow to match up with the set lenses position?  I was thinking about ordering the unofficial cardboard 2.0 plus so I could adjust the eyes. I'm not sure if that'll make a difference.  The important thing is now I know this blur is not normal. I'll try cutting up this cheap cardboard to see if pushing the phone closer or adjusting the eye width will fix it.  Thank you!!
GoogleCardboard,385wdu,In_Film,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"Do you wear glasses?  If closing one eye doesn't help, then adjustable lens width will not help either.  Perhaps the vendor you bought from included the wrong lenses in your kit? With the current race to the bottom on Cardboard prices, that's not out of the question."
GoogleCardboard,385wdu,In_Film,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:57:40 2015 UTC,I don't wear glasses so I guess it won't help. It was a $6 piece so no big deal to cut it up I just didn't know if this was normal to even try.  I guess I should just get the $25 official one so there's no issue. I wish there were reviews so I knew which was best. Do any have glass lenses or are all plastic?

GoogleCardboard,383e12,faduci,2,Sat Jul 11 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"I am guessing these values will be dependent on the phone you put in the headset, yes?   No, the QR code generated with the viewer profile generator only stores informations about the magnification and placement of the lenses, e.g. how far away they are from the base of the viewer (and therefore from the base of the phone). Cardboard SDK derives the screen size from the phone itself, which should give a DPI value for the screen, that combined with the resolution allows calculating the physical dimensions. So if your phone delivers correct values, all apps using the latest Cardboard SDK should automatically adapt the image to the size of the screen."

GoogleCardboard,382z3i,Lilyo,2,Mon Jun 1 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"The lack of head-strap is by design. Having people hold it up to their head makes it less likely they will get disorientated and fall over. A few people have had close calls while wearing mine. Its easy to add a head-strap or glue it to a hat, for those that use it for more than just a few minutes."
GoogleCardboard,382z3i,allensmoker,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:42:16 2015 UTC,"Apparently, it's also meant to limit angular (rotation) velocity. When holding the cardboard to your face, you must turn your whole upper body, not just the head, which is a lot slower and has more inertia. That masks the higher motion-to-photon latency of the system and reduces sim sickness.  But I'm pretty sure the next generation of phones will have a low-persistence display mode and better gyros, and you'll be able to strap it to your face just fine.."

GoogleCardboard,384ba5,Jmmcyclones,4,Mon Jun 1 19:27:41 2015 UTC,I'm near sighted and use my headset without needing glasses. It's actually pretty liberating since outside of reading I need glasses or Contacts for everything. There is a little blurriness in background figures in movies but I haven't had issues with android games and apps.   Could vary but my eyesight is pretty bad. I can't recognize faces a few feet away or read words unless really big letters. My contact prescription was the same for each eye so don't know if that's why it appears pretty clear to me.   Anyone else with poor vision find they can do cardboard without glasses?

GoogleCardboard,382kn1,Th3angryman,2,Mon Jun 1 15:47:10 2015 UTC,"Larger lenses, meaning a larger viewing area, and a new conductive foam button in place of the magnet switch. It also folds up nicely so it takes up less space when not in use and it's apparently easier to assemble."

GoogleCardboard,382kn1,triciti,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:19:00 2015 UTC,Is this going to improve the angle of view? I believe the v1 has a 90 degrees angle of view.
GoogleCardboard,382kn1,Th3angryman,2,Mon Jun 1 16:29:25 2015 UTC,I'd have thought so. A larger lens means it can collect more light from the phone screen.
GoogleCardboard,383ap7,alheim,3,Mon Jun 1 15:29:13 2015 UTC,"They aren't based on either cardboard version. All the cheap plastic headsets have lower magnification lenses and therefore a lower field of view, which is less immersive. They make good virtual screens though since they are generally more comfortable than a regular cardboard. I'd recommend getting a plastic headset and a cardboard one.   The first headset you linked to is called the Ritech 3D, which now has a new version out. A review of the new version and a link to buy it for $11 can be found here."
GoogleCardboard,383ap7,3015,4,Mon Jun 1 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"Seconded. Some extra details: the first is a Ritech I, the second is a ColorCross. The review is for the Ritech II, which is a lot better than the first version and features a magnetic switch, but all of them provide the same miserable FoV, only about 60% of what you'd get with the same phone in Cardboard. This kills immersion, making them very bad for VR, the same is true pretty much for everything below USD 60.  The Ritech versions are more comfortable than the ColorCross and good for watching movies. Decent VR HMDs are the Homido, VRizzmo, XinGear or Cmoar HMD, all of which provide a higher FoV than Cardboard for a much higher price.  Each of the viewers has been discussed here, so the search function will come up with more information. The short version: stick with Cardboard. Waiting for v2 might be worth it if your phone has no compass, as the new version uses another type of switch, but otherwise v1 or a modified version of v1 for phones larger than 5.7"" will do. Cardboard software internally treats the magnet switch, the new conductive lever button and screen touches the same, so apps using the Cardboard SDK are and will remain compatible with either version."
GoogleCardboard,383ap7,faduci,2,Mon Jun 1 16:30:09 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, will Google be able to reduce drift on the Cardboard 2.0? The lack of magnet makes me wonder if sensor fusion could be used with the magnetometer to further enhance tracking accuracy."
GoogleCardboard,383ap7,Ryan86me,3,Mon Jun 1 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"Google already introduced a statistics based method to compensate for drift in one of the last SDK releases. I haven't looked into the implementation, but what it most likely does is tracking the gyro data and looking for small, constant movements. As human usually don't turn their head very slowly for a long time, these movements are most likely caused by the uncalibrated gyroscope, causing the phantom rotation we call drift. The Durovis Dive SDK does something similar, but require placing the phone on a table for about 10 sec to measure the phantom rotation. The big advantage of this approach is that it works with phones without a compass or in Cardboards with magnets messing up the compass.  Subjectively this works pretty well for me in most apps. I once asked here how it worked for others, and at least one user with a Samsung Galaxy S4 that usually drifts horrible confirmed it worked there too. Assuming that the gyroscope error is constant, this could solve the drift problem all on its own. I'm not sure that there aren't any side effects, as I see very weird effects in a game I am working on that involves a lot of head tilting and sideways acceleration. There I end up with a not drifting, but extremely sideways tilted world after a while, which might be caused by the SDK trying to compensate for what it assumes are faulty gyro data, not sure yet.  Android already features several sensor fusion modes to increase accuracy. Will Google use sensor fusion with the compass in the near future? Maybe, but at best to support their statistical approach. Compass data is extremely jumpy, so you have to smoothen it first, making it harder to use to real-time correct the gyro which is already introducing too much latency. Also only a small part of the viewers will be magnet free for a while. It will take some time for cheap Cardboard 2.0 clones to arrive and longer for them to get to the price of 1.0, so the magnets won't vanish overnight. It also remains to be seen how durable a button/lever made out of cardboard plus conductive fabric/foam will be with longer use. The magnets are crap, but for all practical purposes indestructible, so it isn't even sure that Cardboard 2.0 will fully replace 1.0.  The big jump for the capacitative button will be the Mattel VR View-Master coming out in October. Made of plastic and designed for kids, they probably build their capacitative button to withstand a lot of abuse. They are officially partnered with Google, so selling a shitload of magnet free View-Masters on christmas may be the best motivation for integrating compass sensor fusion into Cardboard SDK."

GoogleCardboard,38077q,desktop_version_bot,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:41:41 2015 UTC,"The original blueprints for the cardboard headset that came out last year were just a suggestion. Dozens of vendors have made numerous alterations to that design.  https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/get-cardboard/  Just browse the vendors.  And spending $3 on a cheap headset, you can expect a $3 experience. There's nothing surprising there. It's a great entry point for those that are curious, as you won't be out a whole lot of money if you don't see the potential.  Watching movies is neat, but you're taking your phone's screen and splicing it in half to send the video to each eye. If you're in a ""virtual cinema"" app, you're getting even less pixels of detail than if you were just playing the source video file flat up against your face.  Take a look at how a 1080p smartphone display would be divided up inside the viewer.  You're basically watching the movie at a resolution of 540x300. That's worse than SD. Mathematically, that works out to needing a 2560x1440p smartphone display to watch 720x400 in that example. So at best right now, you can't even get DVD quality."

That said, the original (now-smaller) Cardboard headset design was made for the Nexus 5, which has a screen that's only 4mm shorter on the diagonal. I think either headset size will work, but the bigger headset says the following:    Securely fits any size phone with or without most cases. Double width (10mm) phone gap to accommodate almost every phone and case.    It sounds like the bigger model would work fine on just about any size device."

GoogleCardboard,37wuyu,Fourteen_of_Twelve,5,Sun May 31 04:55:51 2015 UTC,"No, they all seem to use cheap ceramic magnets and plano-convex lenses. These clones are created by using cutting blueprints provided by Google and adding cheap acrylic 25mm diameter/45mm focal length lenses that are available for a few cents on Alibaba if bought in large numbers. Cardboard is an extremely primitive construction, basically a lens holder, all the interesting parts are in the phone, so there isn't even a lot of room for significant improvements. You can buy a Homido for USD 70 and it will be more comfortable and have better lenses with a higher FoV, but the basic experience will still be the same, as it is determined by phone and software, not the viewer."

GoogleCardboard,37wdy2,Xifar_,5,Sat May 30 23:21:33 2015 UTC,"TL; DR: Buy these very cheap Fresnel lenses, fasten them in front of your existing ColorCross lenses, shorten the lens-phone distance. You'll get a FoV better than with Cardboard, but the image quality will suffer.  Increasing the FoV comes with a number of problems, some now reduced with the option to define the FoV in the viewer profile generator and fast phones capable to do lens barrel distortion correction, but keep in mind that higher isn't always better. But unless you pay a lot for high quality optics, larger magnification will always lead to more image distortion, picking the right FoV is a question of balance.  A higher effective FoV can be achieved in three ways:   Use a larger screen Use lenses with higher magnification/lower focal length. Move the eyes closer to the lenses.   All three come with their own problems. Obviously getting a larger screen means buying another phone. Moving the eyes closer requires flexible lens mounts, making it a big problem in Cardboard, pretty easy to do with the screw-in lens mounts in the ColorCross. If the lenses get too close, moisture from the eyes will start to fog the lenses and long lashes will smudge them.  Changing the lenses is the most effective way, but there are some road blocks. The primary problem is usually where to get the lenses, as getting a pair with a specific focal length is important, and the magnification declaration for most lenses is pretty much pure fantasy. Potential sources are Surplus Shed with a large selection of lenses for USD 5 each or Aliexpress with a somewhat random collection of cheap acrylic lenses. I bought enough viewers to simply combine existing lenses, but this isn't really an option for others. Recently I started experimenting with stacking (see below) with cheap Fresnel lenses (sold as Fresnel 3x lens in packs of 10pcs for less than USD 3 on ebay from numerous vendors), and the results are surprisingly good, so this may be a good start for experiments.  Changing the focal length always requires changing the lens-screen distance, which usually means cutting away part of the optical divider, finding a new way to keep the phone in place and may be simply impossible if there isn't enough room inside the viewer. It barely worked with my 135mm wide phone in the Xiaozhai, but there is a lot more space in the Ritech II, so picking the right base for the modification is important.  The magnification to pick depends on the size of your screen, I've posted about the math behind this a couple of times. One of the critical factors with lenses of higher magnification is increased distortions, so instead of using one stronger lens I prefer to use two stacked lenses, which reduces distortion. Posted about these too, can't find the link right now. You can simply try it by taking one of the lenses of the ColorCross (they are held by a simple plastic ring, easy to remove), placing it at the end of the other lens holder (fix it by jamming a piece of paper between lens and holder) and hold it in front of the phone. The lenses have a focal length of about 75mm, stacked you get 37,5mm FL, a significant improvement over the 45mm FL in Cardboard, giving a much higher FoV. The rest is a lot of try and error."
GoogleCardboard,37wdy2,faduci,1 point,Sun May 31 05:41:30 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the detailed explanation.  So, I should try putting hte two lenses over each other. That way it would be similar to what I'd get from using stacked fresnel lenses?  As I've mentioned above, I might just use foam to make it more comfortable, and just make do with the FOV for now. Then later down the road, just get a more polished headset."
GoogleCardboard,37wdy2,Th3angryman,1 point,Sun May 31 08:04:21 2015 UTC,"If you want to increase the FOV of your viewer you'll need new lenses. Moving the current ones closer to the screen will just put them out of focus. The new Cardboard design from Google uses lenses with a focal length of 37mm instead of 45mm like in the old version, so see if you can get ahold of them from somewhere if you want a better FOV."
GoogleCardboard,37wdy2,faduci,1 point,Sun May 31 00:25:02 2015 UTC,"The new lenses have a diameter of 37mm (with 34mm visible) instead of 25mm in Cardboard 1.0, but the focal length is the same 45mm as in the older version, so FoV should be the same. As the FoV not only depends on the lens but also on screen size and eye-lense distance, the actual FoV is rather fuzzy."

GoogleCardboard,37uzhe,faduci,1 point,Sat May 30 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"Reducing the latency was the motivation for streaming via USB instead of WiFi, which caused the problem in the first place, so he most certainly intended to keep the USB cable plugged in, solving the battery problem. So these complains probably won't come.  I use Set Orientation for one particular app that runs upside down, and only if I don't want to rotate the phone due to having cables already plugged in, but otherwise I avoid it, as it prevents auto-rotation, which is actually useful for starting/changing/configuring VR apps. My viewers have holes wherever I needed them to be and I consider headset modification the better solution, but maybe simply because I had enough time to get annoyed by all the small quirks to value convenience over the integrity of my headsets."

GoogleCardboard,37uzhe,thesuperevilclown,1 point,Sun May 31 03:27:01 2015 UTC,"Why should it increase latency and lag? All the app does is set the rotation and prevent Android from changing it, so there isn't really any difference in performance whether you rotate the phone by hand or the app rotated it. Rotating the screen is something that modern GPUs can to without any real performance cost.  Just to be sure I ran the Epic Citadel benchmark in landscape, landscape reverse (by flipping the phone, supported by the app) and landscape reverse forced (by using Set Orientation), the result is always the exact same frame rate (44.9). The only way to get it to drop by almost 25% (36.3) is to start the app in one orientation and then flip the phone over before running the benchmark. It doesn't matter in which orientation it is started, the problem is caused by changing the orientation while the app is running. In this case the app itself seems to rotate the image, which seemingly comes with a large penalty, while having Android rotate the image doesn't. I ran all tests twice to be sure, the results were always identical, including the performance drop."

If you haven't, running through the Google Design Lab app demonstrating ten VR design principles (also listed in the description) will be a faster and funnier introduction than the 42 min presentation. [If you both view the talk and test the app: I actually missed the owl, because I didn't look into the fire. So much for principle six.]  As usually Google emphasize that Cardboard cannot handle full VR experiences, so they recommend very simple and short experiences, avoiding sudden movements etc. During the GDC they called it ""bite-sized VR"", this time it was ""snack-sized VR"". The usual VR recommendations were given again: objects at comfortable viewing distance, avoid situations that would feel uncomfortable in real life, constant head tracking and high FPS have the highest priority etc.  It was interesting how much time they spend to push the message that testing directly in VR is essential. Not just at the end, but even in early concept stages and then all the time. They showed a number of simple prototypes they build just to test some aspects of VR design, which is also the whole point of the Google Design Lab. And the only part that got me really exited was closely related to this: the latest Cardboard SDK has support for Unity Remote, which allows running your game in the Unity editor, but displaying it on the phone, including head tracking. I tried this before and failed to get it to work, but this is something that could improve development a lot by making test cycles much less painful.  All in all the talk is probably worth watching if you haven't looked into VR design before, but there isn't anything Cardboard specific you'd miss if you get your VR design guidelines somewhere else."

I have a number of Cardboards and headsets with head straps, but when I recently found very cheap head straps, I ordered a couple just in case. To test them I attached one to a regular Cardboard, which took about 30 seconds, as they come with three adhesive velcro strips that have to be placed on the side and top of Cardboard, the head straps themselves than connect to the velcro. This allows removing the head straps during regular use, which is actually an important feature, as fixed straps tend to dangle in front of your face whenever you just hold Cardboard with your hands. It also allows washing them from time to time. The straps aren't very long and there is no way to change the length, but as they are flexible this isn't much of a problem unless you have a very large head.  Google discourages attaching head straps and emphasizes that technical limitations make the use a smartphone plus Cardboard not a viable option for a full blown VR HMD. I still think that their points are very valid and for now using Cardboard hand held is the better option for most. This obviously doesn't stop me from continuously doing and enjoying the things Google advices against, and for USD 0.71 I'd recommend the head straps to anyone else interested in giving a Cardboard HMD a try. To actually use it for a longer time you'd have to add some foam padding for comfort. You should be aware that strapping Cardboard to your face increases the chance of nausea. Enjoy at your own risk."

It won't be in 3D, but you'll get the big screen feel.  Edit: I was actually doing that for a while on PCSX2, but my phone can barely hold a charge, so I couldn't really play for more than 30-40 minutes."

GoogleCardboard,37r8m1,faduci,2,Sat May 30 04:45:06 2015 UTC,"I never really use head tracking, I just like cardboard because it makes it look like a giant screen in front of me.   I could lay down and it would still be in front of me."
