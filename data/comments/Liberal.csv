When someone points at men and says all men need to learn to stop hitting people, in my mind it is not only a factually inaccurate statement (because all men do not have violent tendencies) but it's also excluding women from being considered violent.

I feel like a lot of the aggression is misplaced, since - as the article pointed out - Bernie has consistently fought to reduce racial inequality, and a lot of the ""missing the point"" seems to be coming from his supporters. At the same time, however, it does seem like he doesn't want to acknowledge that racial inequality and racism exist as separate issues from economic inequality and classism, much less that they are similar in harm they cause.

She was caught in several lies while campaigning in the last presidential election cycle (anyone remember her claims of being shot at while exiting a helicopter that turned out to be bogus?) She's cozy with Wall Street in a big way that turns many working people off as well.  Hilary has a whole closet full of skeletons that can be used against her in a general election. I personally think she is the most unelectable Democrat if a smart republican gets the right angles.  Sanders is pretty straight up, doesn't care about wall street and has the right messages for the time.  I know that due to his lack of insider connections in the Democratic Party it will be a long shot, that is the real difference between Obama and Sanders.

I don't get what these people are upset about. The flag coming off of a government office? The fact that people recognize it correctly as a symbol of hate before anything else? You don't see non-proliferation advocates pissing their pants over the use of the Nuclear Disarmament logo as a ""peace"" sign (I understand that symbols with positive connotations are different).  They can wear all the confederate flag shit they want. People can also wear nazi regalia. Free speech doesn't entitle you to protection from criticism. If you wear something that symbolizes racism (and as a symbol prominently used by both the KKK and American Hate Groups, it certainly does) then it's your right (to look like an asshole).  What I gather from these reactions is that people want to be vindicated for their own racism, and lack the subtlety to understand that they're not being the least bit coy about it by talking about ""southern pride"". If you wanted to wear a swastika in the ancient style and describe it as a symbol of piece, you might have some technical ground to stand on but the reality is that it is perceived, for good reason, as a symbol of abhorrent hate. Nothing they say or do will change that for the very same reason they argue for their use of the flag: ""real history""."

Oklahoma didn't even exist as a state during the American Civil War.  It wasn't even officially opened to white settlement (through an act of Congress which disenfranchised of their ancestral homeland the Native Americans living there) until 1889 - some 24 years after the Civil War.  In short, Oklahoma could not have participated in the Civil War.  What these people are left with is a symbol of hatred, not something that is pat of the history or heritage of that state.  Though I'm not Jewish, I'd help you to escort anybody in an SS uniform off the property - and none too gently.  Glorifying any dead (or current) institution which existed to promote hatred and murder (like the slave south of the 1800's and the Nazis) is something we have to permit, yet we have the right to purge our nation of this through ridicule and criticism.

Liberal,3df4bf,ulffy,5,Wed Jul 15 19:53:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any other TV alternative, but you might say that the right-wing Wall Street Journal (a newspaper) is generally factual with fairly good journalistic practices (with the exception of their op-ed page). When they report a story, they do generally report both sides. But the story lede (the first sentence) and first few paras sometimes do show some right-leaning bias on political stories in the wording.  Their less subtle bias can be seen, however, in the selection and placement of their articles and in the headlines. A Supreme Court decision that goes against the Obama administration is usually trumpeted on the front page, above the fold with a banner headline, as is any bad news affecting the White House. They always made sure to run stories on the IRS ""scandal"" and other such fodder. Conversely, good news for the administration is less prominently placed with vaguer headlines, often either on the front page but below the fold or on an inside early page.  They are neutral in the so-called ""culture"" war with issues like gay marriage. In their softer news stories, like real estate and living, they have featured lifestyle stories on gay culture. They have a fairly high percentage of Jewish readers, so you don't see pro-Christian, pro-traditional family promotion like you do with the usual right-wing media.  The only exception is the WSJ's op-ed section, which is the usual cesspool of right-wing doom-and-gloom. While they will usually feature one guest piece from the left side, everything else is very right wing. Karl Rove and Peggy Noonan, for instance, are regular columnists.  I get the WSJ for free so I'm fairly familiar with it although I am left-wing not right-wing."

Otherwise the network is too sensational for me, but their actual website is pretty good. I don't mean to come across as bitter saying this, but the media, whether TV, Facebook, reddit, leans overwhelmingly to the left here in the states, so it is hard finding reliable conservative sources. I'm not complaining, that's just how it is.

Liberal,3df4bf,informedpatriotism,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:15:04 2015 UTC,"fair enough about Kelly, just thought I'd throw it out there  yea Drudge Report pools together conservative sources from around the internet, major or not. no articles are directly from Drudge, it's kinda like the meeting zone for a bunch of conservative articles. that's why I like it, there's various sources represented each day, although they are all on one side of the spectrum of course  the only major television news site I have a problem with is MSNBC. this was especially apparent during the 2012 election and President Obama has criticized both it and Fox. I don't have too much of a problem with CNN, I love Anderson Cooper! The network leans to the left, but could be much worse  where are you from?"

Liberal,3df4bf,super_ag,0,Wed Jul 15 22:54:23 2015 UTC,"On a spectrum of Left to Right, you have MSNBC falling off of the left edge, ABC, CBS and NBC News solidly on the Left and CNN near the middle leaning Left. And then Fox News is way to the Right all by itself (unless you count One America News Network)."
Liberal,3df4bf,fishosaurus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:28:30 2015 UTC,"Left/Right is actually relative.  The reason the major networks & CNN are so often labeled as ""leaning left"" is because Fox went so far to the right.  Taken by themselves, I think the networks are only reflecting the tides of popular culture, and they still show more factual reporting than the stuff you'll see on Fox.  Exceptions on the networks are few."
Liberal,3df4bf,super_ag,0,Thu Jul 16 15:22:35 2015 UTC,"Sure, Left and Right are relative and not set in stone. But there are examples of CNN and major networks showing their Liberal bias whereas there are very few where they show a Conservative one.  Examples:   Rathergate - Dan Rather lost his job with CBS because he rushed to get out a fake story that made George Bush look bad. ABC News was caught editing the George Zimmerman 911 tape to make him look like he had racist motives When looking at how CNN 2007 election coverage treated the candidates, one study found, ""The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates – by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain faring the worst (63% negative) and Romney faring a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. With the exception of Obama, Democrats tended not to fare well either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator’s stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative, but both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. While Democrats on average tended to have more positive coverage, the trend was skewed by particularly positive coverage of Obama. ABC News has as an ""unbiased anchor"" former Clinton speechwriter George Stephanopoulos, who got caught donating to the Clintons without disclosing it. Comments from Sharyl Attkisson on CBS's Liberal Bias The morning after the memorial service for Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, Claire Shipman (wife of Obama Press Secretary Jay Carney) criticized Sarah Palin on Good Morning America for comments interpreted by the left as inciting and encouraging violence without a shred of evidence that Jared Loughner was influenced by right-wing media.   Dammit, this took too long and I've got to leave for work now. So in parting, I'll just leave this breakdown of the audiences for a dozen or so media outlets. All ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN have a left-leaning audiences. CNN's average audience is almost as far to the Left as Fox News' is far to the Right. I may come back later to add some more when I have more time."

Liberal,3d9b9e,reddbullish,0,Tue Jul 14 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"So here are Trump's actual positions.  Healthcare for everyone. ""conservatives ,  yeah i said everyone"".  ""I'm prochoice""  Break up the big banks.(long discussion how big banks arent lending the money the government gave them for free and its holding back the economy)  ""Pay people enough that they have incentive to work .""  ""we shouldn't cut social security. We can make it work if we bring back the economy""  ""Wipe out Isis by taking away their oil.""  ""Jeb bush is owned by his donors as are all the other politicians. I have 8 billion dollars. I won't be swayed by lobbists."" Paraphrased shorter version of actual quotes  We have to fight cheap imports with tariffs. ""i'd call the president of Ford motor company who just announced a 2.5 billion dollar plant in Mexico instead of Tennessee and say 'fine, but we are slapping a 35% tax on everything you bring into the usa from there.'""  "" I put a tariff on cheap products from China as long as they keep manipulating their currency to make things artificially cheap. They put illegal tariffs on our goods . We should do the same"".  As long as mexico is sending us their prisoners over the border i would charge mexico $100,000 for each person that crosses. Mexico will pay to stop it because they make billions from us every year in trade.   Those are quote I heard him say when I took the time to watch his speeches and interviews on youtube from the past month or so .  If you think he is an idiot then you are the idiot.  He is bernie sanders  with strength and military toughness and experience negotiating who knows how to stop bad corrupt business practices while incentivizing new real business growth (and you can't have social programs without both)  Yeah it surprised me too.  Watch the pheonix speech.  His announcement.  The interview will bill oreilly (no seriously.)  And his interview with hannity (again seriously).  Then watch his old appaearances on david letterman. You'll see he is honest. His opinions havent changed. He isnt making this stuff up as he goes along. He is uncannily correct even back in the 80's when he talks about what will cause upcoming economic problems.  Its time to get over his hair and his bravado. He admits them both. So what? Do you want a shrinking violet for President? This guy is our best shot.  Hillary is owned by wall street lobbists and jeb is owned by saudi arabian lobbists. Bernie is great but he is half the package. Good domestic social policies but a complete unknown in  his ability to actually get things done and negotiate.  Take two or three hours to watch the videos i suggested and he will win you over too. Trump is the o ly person who has stepped up to the plate that won't just be a continuation of the long slow national death spiral. He is common sense and good humour combined with money and ability to take on the status quo and WIN - not just the election but actually win policy changes in Washington. (politicians will run to support him in legislation like flies to honey becuase politicians are weasals who areattracted to real leaders who take the heat for them while letting them stand on the podium and keep their jobs.)

He will say or do anything that serves those ends. Period.   I do think he's going to take a flamethrower to the Republican debates if they let him in and I'm going to have plenty of popcorn.
Liberal,3d9b9e,reddbullish,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:08:56 2015 UTC,I can't watch that proprietary crappy video feed on my phone? What does it say he changed on?  Because when i watched all the way back to david letterman appearances in the 80's the guy was expressing the same core beliefs.  Now many things have changed in the usa since then so maybe he once was for more or less taxes or something but hell the whole world has changed. That doesnt mean his core beliefs have changed as to how and why he beleives in policies.  What did they say he changed on?  By the way the oligarchs who own the media know they cant control him like they can other politicians so they will try to make him put to be an idiot. If nbc is assembling edited half footage to make him look bad (like they already did on his mexico illegal immigration quotes) then that shojld tell you the big money oligarchs who own the other politicians dont like him and than means he is good for you.  So he is an egomaniac. So what? What do you think leaders ARE? They stand out and take the lead. They have self confidence. So what? You want a shrinking violet to win and then beg a congress that is completely controlled by lobbists to do what he wants? No. You want a huge personality that can dare congress to defy him becuase if they do the public will vote them out of office in two years.  Obama was weak. He didnt have it.  He looked like he might but in the end he didnt. We need an egomaniac. We need a crusher.  We aredamn lucky we have one and that he is socially a moderate to liberal while possessing the business experince to be able to negotiate good foreign trade deals while giving businesses reason to rebound and rehire.  Frankly he is the candidate most of us have been waiting for and we just didnt know it.

I find him irrational, obnoxious, and... let's say 'not presidential'. He's perfect for reality tv. He should stay there."
Liberal,3d9b9e,MoroccoBotix,0,Tue Jul 14 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"But none of those ARE flip flops.  Look at what they said.  Trump on Clinton 2015: ""I think Hillary would be a terrible president. She was the worst secretary of state in the history of our nation. Why would she be a good president?""  2012: ""Hillary Clinton, I think, is a terrific woman.… I just like her. I like her, and I like her husband.""  He liked her but said she sucked at her job after five years.  Trump on Obama 2015: ""Some people would say he's incompetent. I would not say that. Eh, yes, I would.""  2010: ""I think [former Secretary of the Treasury] Tim Geithner has done a good job. I think that the whole group has really done a good job. When you look at what's happened, at least we have an economy. You wouldn't have had an economy had they not come up with some very drastic steps two years ago.""  He thoguht geitner saved the economy and then botched it. Correct.  Trump on health care 2015: ""I'm almost more disappointed with the Republicans. … They have to toughen up on Obamacare, which is a total lie, and which is a total and complete disaster.""  1999: ""Liberal on health care. We have to take care of people that are sick. … I like universal. We have to take care. There's nothing else. What's the country all about if we're not going to take care of our sick?""  He hates obamacare and wants universal care. Obamacare isnt universla care. He is right and its not inconsistent.  Note: Trump told the Washington Post's Robert Costa on Saturday, ""You heard what I said today about health care. I said, 'I'm sorry, folks, but we have to take care people that don't have money.' I know it's not the conservative thing to say, but I got a standing ovation — and these were very conservative people. We can't let people down when they can't get any medical care, when they're sick and don't have money to go to a doctor. You help them.""  Trump on taxes 2015: ""Let me tell you, everybody wants to pay as little as possible — including Warren Buffett, by the way, just by what he says. And somebody said, 'What's your tax rate?' I don't know. I pay as little as possible.""  1999: ""I would tax people of wealth — of great wealth, people over $10 million — by 14.25 percent.""  Duh. Everyone wants to pay as little as is legally possible but he thinks the legal taxes on millionaires should be higher. Again not inconsistent at all.  Trump on abortion 2015: ""I'm very pro-life, and feel strongly about it.""  1999: ""I'm very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But, still, I just believe in choice.""  Lots of people personally would not like an abortion but beleive others should have the choice.  Totally normal and not inconsistent. Its actually the majority opinion in the usa by far. Keep it legal but rare.  None of those are changes in position!  He said obamacare is a disaster and he wants universla health care. That snot a flipflop or a contradiction.  He said ue pays as little in taxes as possible but beleives the tax rate on millionaires shpuld be higher. Thats not a contradiction.  Do people even pay attention or just watch the headline?  And the fact that nbc is doing such an obviously incorrect hit peice shows you they dont want him. And that tells you he wont serve the billionaires that own nbc.  Yeah i have to say after watching his stuf over the weekend i was extremely happy to see what he stands for  and how he is and has been. ( i watched some videos of him from back in the 80's)  I was all for bernie sanders and now i think trump has the best of bernie but wrapped in a bigger and more effective package ."

Liberal,3d6gmu,chubwagon,2,Tue Jul 14 05:50:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly? It wouldn't have helped. Really.  Glass-Steagall did nothing to regulate the way CDOs are packaged and sold, and how transactions and derivative markets have become too complex and fast-moving for even those who invented them to understand what goes on.  Breaking up the banks-- while I personally support and she should, too --and reinstating Glass-Steagall is, at this point, a red herring. It solves a different problem. It's increasingly a populist position to support bringing the policy back, but it's not what we need at this point.  As long as there is a global financial system-- as long as LIBOR is still a benchmark, and as long as transactions involving the securitization of unstable debt can occur within a millionth of a second, it does not matter how many trusts we bust.  And furthermore, as demonstrated with the Volcker rule, the Congress is very effective at hammering away the types of rules that Glass-Steagall included, with each spending bill it passes. Couple that with the fact that the Democrats are very unlikely to control the House of Representative until 2022 at the earliest, and it makes no sense for her to consider Glass-Steagall to be a policy she needs to pursue.  Rather, I think it's quite smart of her to not talk about it. It is irrelevant."

Bernie is great but he is half the package. Good domestic social policies but a complete unknown in  his ability to actually get things done and negotiate.

I was pretty sure that Texas or any state have plenty of bases, soldiers all the time, so why is this operation so particularly dire? Because these are special forces? That does not make any sense. The military will use any terrain or grounds to train troops for anything they might encounter.  They sent special forces to jungles, forest, mountains, swamps, deserts to train and there are probably hundred of bases scattered throughout the country set up for the purposes of training troops all the time. Not to mention, air force bases and naval ports are all over the place anyway. This uproar is completely irrational. It is like these people fantasize about violent revolutions and rebellion all the time and every little thing to them is some sign or omen. It is like they are just finding any excuse to start something. It is almost religious in their irrationality, while the rest of the country watched them in puzzlement and disgust.  These are the type of people that usually morphed into a paramilitary thug group when lead by a charismatic leader because they are so easy to hijack and they are willing, even eager to do violence on others who disagree with them. Once they become an in-group and the rest of the country become the enemy, you get stuff like the SS and PNF forming, eventually leading to stuff like Beer Hall Putsch.   On Saturday in San Antonio, protesters gathered outside the Alamo to decry its new designation as a Unesco World Heritage site, on the less-than-rational basis that this honour could be the prelude to a United Nations takeover of Texas’ most sacred landmark.

Liberal,3d4dmn,Didicet,3,Mon Jul 13 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"This is really Economics 101 stuff. Unions ensure that workers receive fair compensation for their labor. Workers with fair pay spend more money than underpaid workers. More consumer spending means more economic growth.  Look at a town when a factory closes down, particularly when that factory was a major employer (or the only one). Incomes shrink drastically, so people spend less money. Local businesses are crippled and many of them fold, thereby throwing more people out of work. Now compound this effect across the whole country: with employers closing union factories and moving to deceptively named ""right to work"" states, the number of underpaid workers increases nationally and suppresses demand for goods and services, thereby reducing GNP growth."

That's not a particularly bold claim: if you understand the 3/5ths compromise, you'll understand why this has to be true.  The government established by the constitution allocated legislative representation based on population. The more people your state had, the more representatives your state sent to Congress. States with a high proportion of slaves wanted to include those slaves in their census counts so they'd be entitled to more votes in the legislature.   Liberals didn't want slave states to have that advantage, so they basically said ""Sure, you can hold slaves. But, only free people get to be counted for representation""."

Liberal,3d3m7k,rivalarrival,2,Mon Jul 13 19:04:02 2015 UTC,"Son, go educate yourself on the 3/5ths compromise, because you obviously do not understand it.   I'll try to explain it again. Suppose we've got two communities coming together to form a more perfect Union. We're writing the constitution for this union. You're deciding how to count the people in this union for purposes of representation. You've got three options available to you:   Option 1: Count all the people equally, without regard to race or condition of servitude. Option 2: Count only Freemen.  Option 3. Count all Freemen, plus a fraction of any slaves.    Your arguments thus far suggest that liberals would select Option 1. You would count each and every person, black or white, free or slave. All men are created equal, right?  Well, let's apply your selection:  Community Alpha is a slave-owning community comprised of 10 plantations. Each plantation has a family of 10 people, and 90 slaves. There are a total of 1000 individuals in this community, 100 freemen and 900 slaves.  Community Bravo is a freehold farming community. There are 100 farms, each farm has an average of 10 family members working the land. Total: 1000 free individuals in this community, no slaves.  We've decided that we should establish a legislative council based on our population. We've decided that the representation ratio in our Union should be 100:1.  We're going to have one elected representative for every 100 people in our union. All that's left to decide is how we'll do the counting.   Through your arguments, you selected Option 1. You contend that Liberals would count slaves as people, so you count each and every individual in the union and come up with a total of 2000 people, 1000 in each state. If you do that, the legislature in our union will be comprised of 10 farmers representing Community Bravo, and 10 slave owners representing Community Alpha. Half of your union's legislature will be pro-slavery, even though only 1/10th 1/11th  of the free people in the union actually own slaves.   I contend that Liberals would not count slaves as people. I contend that Liberals would want Option 2, and would count only Freemen. My count comes to 1100 people: 100 from Community Alpha (slave owners) and 1000 from Community Bravo (Freemen). I don't count a single slave; I don't recognize a single one as a person for purposes of allocating legislative representation. The legislature in this union would be comprised of 10 people from Bravo and 1 person from Alpha. Bravo is a free community, and they've now got a 10-to-1 voting advantage over slave-owning Alpha. Free Bravo's policy decisions would always be supported; Alpha's policy decisions would not.   Ultimately, Freemen won't agree to Option 1; Slave-owners won't agree to Option 2. The Constitutional Congress was at an impasse, so they came up with Option 3, and negotiated a compromise where slaves would be considered 3/5ths of a person. When we do this, we come up with a population of 1640 people. Bravo gets 10 seats, Alpha gets 6 seats, and the constitution gets ratified.   The only way that Liberals would want the census to count slaves as people in this situation is if liberals were pro slavery. I know that's not what you're claiming, which means that you were simply ignorant of what the 3/5ths compromise actually accomplished when you made your argument.  Liberals did NOT want to count slaves as people, conservatives did."
Liberal,3d3m7k,m1sterlurk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"Everything you write assumes Democrats were always liberal when it came to social issues, and Republicans were always conservative.  Democrats of the slavery era wanted to count slaves so they could get votes even with members of the populace who didn't get the rights that their representatives granted to the freemen.  Republicans of the slavery era didn't want them counted because they felt that Democrats shouldn't get extra representation in a government for free people when not all of their people are free.  Democrats started abandoning racist ideals when George Wallace started up with his segregationist garbage.  Meanwhile, Republicans started adopting ideas such as ""tough on crime"" laws, slashing of government benefits for the poor, and so on in the 80's with Reagan...and if you can make up a reason to be prejudiced against somebody that you can deflect away from race it's apparently ok to be an asshole."

Liberal,3cwqtc,pateras,9,Sat Jul 11 13:06:22 2015 UTC,"I clicked on this article because it hits so close to home for me, especially this week.  For background, I am a 21 year old female with various mental illnesses including but not limited to mixed bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder due to being raped when I was 15. I also suffer from chronic pain, pretty much all over my body. I didn't start smoking weed regularly until after I was 18, and I've always (for the most part, anyway) been very responsible about my use. I NEED weed to function as a person, to get through my pain and my anxiety mostly.  I cannot get a medical card because I live in PA and tom corbett is a giant cocksucker.  I worked at a gas station where, even after 2 raises, I made $8/hour. And I worked my ass off. I covered when no one else would. I made sure that store ran to the best of my ability. I worked 14 hour days. I trained new employees who would work there for 2 weeks and then we'd never see them again. I have forced myself to clean human feces out of a sink it was clogged with. Long story short, I was very dedicated to this company and loyal and I cared a lot about them and my customers.  Well, in the last month they were bought by another company and all the employees who already worked there were drug tested. Naturally, I failed. I'm NOT some party girl who smokes for fun. I don't do any other drugs besides my anti depressants but I dont think that counts. I don't even drink.  I was fired. I was fired knowing I worked twice as hard as everyone in that store except my poor manager that now has NO ONE to help her and knowing that I was the best employee there. By the way, at least one of the other employees is a known meth fiend, and another is an alcoholic who finally just completed her sentence for her DUI. I have never been in any sort of legal trouble.  For $8 an hour, I wasn't allowed to have something that I needed to get through a day at their gas station. I can see certain government employees, those who operate heavy machinery, truck drivers, etc, being prohibited from any sort of drug use.  But come on, you all know at least one guy that works at the local 7-11 or what have you that is constantly blazed as fuck when you go in. I at least have the decency to leave my drug use at home.  tl;dr: It's fucking stupid to drug test people doing menial labor and it really needs to stop. Sorry for the rant."
Liberal,3cwqtc,ktqueenofknots,3,Sat Jul 11 20:31:21 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize, I think we don't hear enough about the nonsensical nature and practical failure (as is evident in your situation) of this particular practice when we talk about the fallout from the Drug War.   UA's are variably accurate, there is no universal standard because of the unique way THC metabolizes, users of harder and more damaging drugs go undetected, and the threshold for THCOOH is far too low to actually target people who are presently high or use enough to inhibit their performance even when sober at work.   Part of it is even though the arguments against pre-employment and random screenings especially when it comes to marijuana are reasonable, you can't say anything against it without drawing attention and potentially invasions of privacy to yourself.   It's fucking stupid to drug test people doing menial labor and it really needs to stop.   It is fucking stupid. It's also expensive.   Employers collectively spend billions of dollars a year on testing programs when there are no studies showing whether or not private usage of marijuana (especially in states where its usage has been legalized) has any impact on workplace productivity. Drug testing companies cite one study (if any at all) and give employers the vague sales line ""Drug abuse costs employers in the US up to Xmillion dollars a year"" when the actual cost comes from employers refusing to hire qualified people because they happen to test positive for marijuana, or hiring qualified people who test clean and then losing them to random testing policies and being forced to retrain and rehire.   Employers who fire people for use of marijuana are losing money and end up hiring people who drink excessively or use things like meth and coke, plain and simple."
Liberal,3cwqtc,VLDT,2,Sat Jul 11 21:03:08 2015 UTC,My opposition to employee drug testing is different.  Drug use is a crime.  Employee drug testing is in essence investigating you for a crime...  Criminal investigations should not be done by anything other than law enforcement agencies.
Liberal,3cwqtc,Procean,3,Tue Jul 14 23:24:56 2015 UTC,"The title is overly vague, and the arguments should be better organized but on the whole Takash makes some reasonable points. However, the tone is preaching to the choir, rather than making arguments that might sway employers who could conceivably eliminate drug testing, or at the very least do away with pre-employment screens.  While I agree with the central premise that employers who aren't required to prohibit marijuana use (and, subjectively, even those who are) should allow employees to use marijuana outside of work by simply avoiding invading that real of privacy and focusing on work behaviors, the terms in this article are overly vague and unlikely to convince any drug warrior types.   Is Takash saying that there should be a pass for medical users? Or all marijuana users? Or that employment-affiliated drug testing is wholly useless? I could be convinced of the latter, but will someone who maintains a testing policy really reconsider it?   It’s not clear that drug testing is necessary to ensure a safe, productive workplace.    Again, I agree, but where is your evidence (there is quite a bit available showing that drug testing doesn't improve anything and actually harms companies' bottom lines) to convince stalwart advocates for the Drug War, Mr. Takash?  The thing is, drug testing is part of the drug war culture. It's not a single uniform policy, and indeed is practiced differently by different employers with the only standards being those of the manufacturers of tests and labs that profit from this invasion of privacy.  Pre-employment screens are a practice as common to employment in America as reference checking, albeit with different purposes and differing levels of efficacy. The major difference is that checking a reference is actually a reasonable use of an employer's time and resources, whereas drug testing is inaccurate and essentially useless due to its bias against marijuana while allowing users of harder drugs to test clean on a shorter timeframe.  This is especially bothersome considering that even if federal legalization happens soon, employers will continue to drug test and an employee will have to file suit for an employer restricting legal activities outside of work (for which only 20 or so states have protective laws in place).   Ironically, where courts are now ruling for employers because they're abiding by federal law, if marijuana were federally legal the courts would still probably rule for the employers on the grounds that there are as of yet no laws saying they can't prohibit legal activity (like drinking or tobacco use) in at least half of the states.  Some companies' insurance providers require it (although they rarely specify what kind, and saliva testing is a better option) while others just have the vague requirement of ""a drug-free workplace"". Rather than define ""a drug-free workplace"" by loose and legally flimsy terms of using subjective signs that someone might be high, employers just want an easy and legally defensible way to maintain that ""drug-free workplace"". Even if drug testing invades an employees private life, the law is on the side of the employer and will likely continue to be without legislative action.  This is where this particular argument falls apart:   This determination doesn’t require a drug test. If an employee is behaving in a way that would indicate they’re under the influence of some substance in a way that interferes with productivity or safety of the workplace, they can, and probably should, be sent home or fired. This is hardly a novel concept. An employer would treat an employee the exact same way if they were drunk. There’s no reason they wouldn’t adopt a similar procedure for drug use.    This determination most definitely requires a drug test, for legal purposes. Would you really be willing to allow employers to say ""He looked high, so I fired him""? Moreover, if an employer thought an employee was high, fired him, and the employee went and got an independent drug test and sued the fuck out of the employer, it would have seemed easier and less risky for the employer to have just used a drug test in the first place. Using Drug Tests basically removes the chance that the employers can get into some shit for making a subjective judgement about whether someone is high at work (again, saliva testing alleviates this issue in a more fair and cost-effective manner).  However, this is the real point of the argument, and the part you will have to work the hardest to convince employers of:   Moreover, there’s no reason an employer should care about an employee’s drug use. Notwithstanding any personal relationship the two parties may have, the personal conduct of an employee is no business of the employer if the employee is able to perform at work.    True, but employers certainly have a right to accurate knowledge of what occurs in the workplace. Convincing employers to limit or eliminate drug testing requires some kind of alternative that provides them with the ability to unequivocally determine inebriation during work hours. Saliva tests are really the best option for this.   As long as an employee can do their job, there’s no reason to penalize them for drug use, especially for medical reasons.    Sure...   Even the moral arguments for drug testing fall flat. Could anyone imagine a company that would fire an employee for adultery?    And here is the impractical false equivalency. Simply put, use of certain drugs is federally illegal. Adultery is not."

Sure she will. I'll bet it's her top priority."
Liberal,3czeut,Thangleby_Slapdiback,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:09:43 2015 UTC,"Look at her voting record in the senate.    Hillary Clinton supports increasing the minimum wage and voted repeatedly to protect and increase it. She was an original cosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 and authored the 2006 and 2007 Standing With Minimum Wage Act to tie congressional salary increases to an increase in the minimum wage.  Hillary has said that ""inherited wealth and concentrated wealth is not good for America,"" and she consistently voted against repealing the estate tax on millionaires, doing so in 2001, 2002, and 2006.  Hillary Clinton has long advocated for a fairer tax system that works for all Americans, not just the most fortunate. In the Senate she consistently fought for middle-class tax cuts, including tax credits for student loan recipients, and keeping in place the tax cuts for those who make under $250,000 a year.  She worked to make millionaires pay their fair share by closing the ""carried interest"" tax loophole that allows Wall Street executives to pay a lesser percentage of their income than regular working Americans.  She has fought to crack down on CEO compensation, introducing legislation to let shareholders have a say in the companies they invest in.   Also the 2008 primaries:    In keeping with her voting record, Clinton ran to Obama's left on economic issues in the 2008 primaries. This manifested itself most clearly on the subject of health care, where Clinton was willing to include a politically unpopular individual mandate to buy health insurance as part of a program for universal coverage. Obama was not willing to go so far, and came in for substantial criticism from liberals for it. Less famously, Clinton proposed a Cabinet-level poverty czar position — an idea that might make a comeback in 2016.   http://www.vox.com/2015/6/15/8779449/hillary-clinton-populist-record  It'd be ignorant to assume donors would influence her so largely that she would be unwilling or incapable of carrying out proposed policies she believes in. That's the difference between the GOP and Democrats (generally), the GOP will throw average Americans under the bus to support the wealthy and corporations, we haven't seen that from Hillary and pointing to her donors doesn't make it true either. Obama had the same and similar donors, as well as other major candidates for the Presidency on both sides of the aisle, yet major differences remain between them. If you're going to look at her donors you should probably also look at the whole picture, instead of part of it."
Liberal,3czeut,Thangleby_Slapdiback,2,Sun Jul 12 16:28:18 2015 UTC,"Tell you what. I will stipulate that Ms. Clinton has impeccable progressive credentials in most ways. In fact, she's such an accomplished woman that I had to use the honorific ""Ms. Clinton"" because I didn't know how else to address such an accomplished woman? Should it be Secretary Clinton? Senator Clinton? I really don't know.   I will stipulate that Ms. Clinton's foreign policy credentials are much better than Senator Sanders in that she has served as Secretary of State and has interacted closely w/ leaders around the world. I question her judgement in foreign policy because of her vote on the Iraq War (something Senator Sanders famously voted against while in the House).   I question her commitment to civil liberties because of her vote on the Patriot Act. Yes, she admits that she voted the wrong way on both Iraq and the Patriot Act, but Senator Sanders has had to make no such admission. He voted the right way both times and has been a champion of civil liberties all his life. He was a participant in the Civil Rights Movement in the 60's. He went to jail for his commitment to a cause. His entire political career is built on civil rights and income/wealth inequality.   And it's on income/wealth inequality that I feel much more comfortable with Senator Sanders as the Democratic nominee than Senator Clinton. There's no questioning Bernie's commitment to that cause. It's been at the heart of his pursuits for 50 years. For his entire adult life he has made this his cause.   Ms. Clinton might  have an impressive voting record there, but when I look at her palatial homes (all of them worth well into the millions - estates, really), when I look at her income from speaking fees and who pays them, when I look at the donor list that helped her political career during her time in the Senate it makes me uncomfortable.  You see, with Ms. Clinton, I have to make myself believe that she's not simply another Wall St. Democrat, all in favor of easing up on people when it comes to social issues whilst ignoring the biggest social issue of all - poverty. I have to look at her enormous wealth (one of the wealthiest - if not THE wealthiest person in the Senate), her palatial estates, her coziness w/ donors who worked at some of the main players in the crash of '08, allegations of monies pouring into the Clinton Foundation from foreign donors while she was Secretary of State dealing w/ the very issues that concerned those donors. I have to remind myself that she was ""only the First Lady"" when NAFTA, GATT, the WTO all came into being. I have to forget about the repeal of Glass-Stegall. I have to forget about the seemingly encouraged outsourcing, the ""Walmartization"" of the workforce. She was, after all, only the first lady. But I believe she was very influential in the White House. How could a First Lady be anything but - especially as driven a woman as she obviously is.  With Senator Sanders, there's no making myself believe anything. There is no need to suspend disbelief. This is obviously his life's work. What kind of house does Bernie live in? I don't know. I can't find a photo at the moment. I know his net worth is around $500k - likely much of it tied up in his house. I know the proceeds from books he has written and speeches he has given have gone to charity. I  know that he doesn't charge $100k+ to give a speech. Sure, he probably couldn't get that much, but that's hardly the point, is it?  I know Bernie grew up in poverty, and has made poverty an issue his whole life. Remember, he agreed w/ ML King when Mr. King said that civil rights had an economic component as well.   Senator Sanders has to be able to pull independent votes to win. He routinely pulls conservative working class votes all over Vermont because conservatives in Vermont are convinced he's not coming after their guns, he wants to let them live their lives in peace, and he wants to make sure the economy is good for all people. They're convinced of it. That's why he wins by huge margins in VT.  What kind of crossover appeal does Hillary have? She's got 25 years of vilification from the right. They loathe her. They would rather shoot themselves than vote for a Clinton - especially Hillary. Most of that isn't her fault. Some of it is - even if explicable. Still - how does a candidate overcome 25 years of animosity to pull votes from the GOP side?  Look - I'm not saying that Hillary is a bad candidate to represent the party. I'm saying she's not nearly as good a candidate to represent the party as Bernie is.   And every time someone tried to force something down my throat, it wound up being bad for me. Our presumptive front runner seems to have media and the Democratic Party solidly in her pocket. I believe all of those parties would like to see a coronation because those who are loyal to the Clintons are rewarded by them, those who aren't are punished. This is legendary in DC.   Sorry. I'll take the Sanders every day of the week. And if we - as a party - are wise, that's what we will choose to do."
Liberal,3czeut,Thangleby_Slapdiback,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:55:12 2015 UTC,"You've raised some fair and interesting points. At the same time though I would say that Bernie and Hillary aren't all that different when it comes to the policies that they are advocating for. Depending on who becomes the nominee is who is more likely to win. Bernie Sanders has a lot of great ideas and policy positions as well, he's passionate and determined.   Let's see this on the flip side for a second though, I have 2 major questions/contentions when it comes to who we choose as the nominee:  1.) Who's more likely to actually win the general election: Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton? This is a big one, that seems to favor Hillary at this point due to her massive and sophisticated campaign coalition some of which she inherited from Obama, as well as her 100% name recognition. Hillary may be the Democratic party's best chance to holding onto the White House.  2.) Bernie Sanders' has great ideas but those ideas are also polarizing and ideological, to be fair Hillary's are too. But wouldn't Hillary be more capable than Sanders to get passed a gridlocked Congress and accomplish aspects of her agenda? Some people even speculate she would've done a better job than Obama at legislative accomplishments due to her experience. She said this of Obama back on the 2008 campaign trail:   ""Now, I could stand up here and say, 'Let's just get everybody together. Let's get unified. The sky will open. The light will come down. Celestial choirs will be singing, and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect.'""  ""Maybe I've just lived a little long, but I have no illusions about how hard this is going to be."" ""You are not going to wave a magic wand and have the special interests disappear.""   She had no illusions to how difficult the GOP would be after watching her husband's Presidency, and she seemed better equipped to deal with them.  I feel like she's a bit more realistic/capable of actually getting things done. She dealt with the GOP as First Lady and saw how they acted during her husband's Presidency, and during Obama's Presidency. She served in the Senate herself and dealt with leaders across the globe as Secretary of State, negotiating tough issues. I feel like she'd be more capable to actually get things done."
Liberal,3czeut,kilgore_trout87,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:07:27 2015 UTC,"...I would say that Bernie and Hillary aren't all that different when it comes to the policies that they are advocating for.   I've listened to politicians advocate stuff for 50 years. One thing I've learned, it's not so hard to advocate something when you are part of the minority in a house dominated by people of a different persuasion. It's not so much of a question of what they advocate, it's what I believe they will push and what I believe they will stand against. Remember, the GOP will still hold the House. Who is the fighter? Who will fight for his/her cause? With Bernie, there's no question. With Hillary there is.   1.) Who's more likely to actually win the general election: Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton? This is a big one, that seems to favor Hillary at this point due to her massive and sophisticated campaign coalition some of which she inherited from Obama, as well as her 100% name recognition. Hillary may be the Democratic party's best chance to holding onto the White House.   I think Bernie is more likely to win than Hillary. You are absolutely right that polling right now seems to favor Ms. Clinton. I'm equally sure, given that a significant number of those polled replied ""Bernie Who?"" that much of her numbers are the result of superior name recognition and the cult of personality that always surrounds politics. Many people remember her husband's presidency fondly, especially given the subsequent decade.   She does have a formidable machine on her side. He has ~$60m to spend (between her and her PAC) and much of the party hierarchy sewn up. I want you to understand something, though. From the perspective of this Bernie supporter (and, I suspect, many others) this is as much a fight for the Democratic Party as it is an attempt to wrest control of the government from the ""billionaire class"" that Sanders references so often in his stump speech.  Look at it from this perspective for a moment. Let's say the party nominates Clinton. Aside from those Bernie supporters living in safe red or blue states, we have little choice but hold our noses and vote for whomever the party has as it's nominee. As I said - Clinton is a far better choice for any thinking human being than anyone in the GOP field. This is even more true when one considers that the GOP holds the Senate, the House, a majority on the Supreme Court and the likelihood of several Supreme Court nominations in the near future.  What we can do is turn the tide on the limousine liberals of the Democratic Party and give them the same choice they've given the rest of us for a very, very long time.   We can also lay that aside to consider the general election. Hillary has the antipathy of the GOP. She will get most of the Democrats, aside from those pissed off that Bernie isn't the nominee. She will get some independents (who lean left on social issues, are comfortable that she'll do a little bit to help the poor w/out impacting the independent's pocketbook too much, and those subject to identity politics). She will not reach working class voters on the GOP side of the house. She might get GOP moderates who aren't religious and aren't concerned that she'll upset the money train too much.  Here's Bernie's coalition:   Students. His career - forget about his stated positions - is right up their alley.  Working class voters who watched the jobs go away and now are up to their eyeballs in debt, work, and worry. That's big GOP crossover. That's the sort of thing that Reagan did. That's what kind of potential we have there. Democrats. Who else they gonna vote for? Ted Cruz? The minority vote - I know there's been much made of Bernie's lack of penetration there, but it's early yet and we only have to look at engagement among Latinos to know that Ms. Clinton does not have the Latino vote sewn up. Why should we believe she is any less vulnerable among any other voter - especially when you consider that minority voters are generally working class voters - right up Bernie's alley. Veterans. Look up the last congress. The only major legislation pushed through was Sander's Veterans bill. He constantly gets high marks from Veteran's groups. That's a very red constituency. Let's also not forget that while we have all kinds of lofty rhetoric about supporting our troops - the greatest support we can give our troops is to use them spareingly since the cost to them - and our nation - is so dear. Bernie voted against that war. Hillary didn't - mistake or no - how many people died or were maimed in that war? Believe this - that kind of thing matters to vets. If we're going to give, don't ask us to give in vain. We fight/fought for all of us. The cost has to be worth it. I know Bernie is strong there. I know it for a fact.   That's one helluva coalition.    2.) Bernie Sanders' has great ideas but those ideas are also polarizing and ideological, to be fair Hillary's are too. But wouldn't Hillary be more capable than Sanders to get passed a gridlocked Congress and accomplish aspects of her agenda? Some people even speculate she would've done a better job than Obama at legislative accomplishments due to her experience.    Yes, this is true. They both have polarizing ideas. I don't think Hillary could push a damned thing through a GOP-dominated House. She is the GOP boogeyman. Literally. I think that the GOP will fight her every step of the way on every proposal she makes. They are dishonorable people. They will fight her in the most underhanded ways imaginable.   They'll do the same thing to Sanders.  Who's the more effective? Bernie is well-known in the House and the Senate for being able to hammer out deals. I've seen that referenced in several articles written about him. Yes, he's hard-boiled, but he will work with someone, if someone is willing to work with him in good faith.  The question is, who will be better suited to fighting those recalcitrant bastards when they buck?  Again, Bernie. Who do you think will handle a bully pulpit better? Every time Obama reached out to them, he got his hand bitten. Let's see how they like our junkyard dog.  I don't see Hillary carrying the fight to the GOP/Monied set like I see Bernie doing it.  And all of us are tired of those people - working class republicans included.   Anybody that thinks Hillary could have gotten more through the Tea Party congress from '11-today is fooling himself. If Jesus (D) himself was President, they'd have the Fox watchers convinced he was Satan.   She dealt with the GOP as First Lady and saw how they acted during her husband's Presidency, and during Obama's Presidency. She served in the Senate herself and dealt with leaders across the globe as Secretary of State, negotiating tough issues. I feel like she'd be more capable to actually get things done.   And mark my words, her Administration would be one of manufactured scandal and the Ghost of Vince Foster. It'll be all about ""Billary"", Lewinski, Whitewater, Benghazi, you name it. The scandals don't have to be real for them to pound them. You sound as though you believe that the GOP in congress are reasonable people, or the GOP itself is honorable. They're not. The truth is that they need to be shattered. They need their coalition broken into pieces. The wealthy have to be separated from the zealots, and the working class is our wedge. Poverty is afflicting working class regardless of affiliation, and now is the time to drive that wedge home.   They aren't fools, you know.  They know that 35 years of the same old supply side, free trade stuff isn't working for them and hasn't for a long while. Even those that are later in life who did OK are looking at their kids, the debt they're loading up from school or their struggles in finding work, and wondering what the hell is going on.  Can't blame Obama, really, it's better than it was when  he took office and it's better than Mitt promised to do when he ran.  I think they're ready to listen to someone else for a change. Now is when we decide who to put in front of them to speak.  They're polling for Bush or Trump. Think about that. Jeb ""Y'all need to work more hours"" Bush or Donald ""Mexicans love me but I don't love Mexicans"" Trump.   We have a grand opportunity here if we don't fuck it up.  Name the last time we sent a fighter to the White House. An honest-to-God, floor stompin' unapologetic FDR type? Truman? FDR himself?  We're overdue."

In the United States, you cannot sue someone in a civil action which results in the defendant being incarcerated. So you obviously misstated the facts in the situation that you did not source.  Are you referring to the Vermont case from several years ago where two lesbians sued a zoning officer for discrimination and the zoning officer also happened to be a Baptist minister? If so, then that case has utterly nothing to do with so-called religious freedom. They sued the zoning officer in his capacity as a zoning officer. The fact that he is also a minister is irrelevant; he cannot ignore the law to suit his personal religious beliefs. If he can't reconcile the two, then he has a duty to resign as a zoning officer.   Why can't a restaurant owner refuse to bake a wedding cake without getting their livelihood destroyed?   Because you have no constitutional right to discriminate. If you own a business open to the public, then you must accept all paying customers. You cannot turn away a gay couple wanting a wedding cake just like you cannot turn away a black couple wanting a wedding cake."

Liberal,3d0nrv,secondarycontrol,-3,Sun Jul 12 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"One of the things coming up is an American version of the 'Russian antigay propaganda' Law. Basically its simple: It treats homosexual images or literature the same as we treat any kind of pornography. Anything advocating or selling or promoting homosexual behavior can't be shown in any public spaces. Again, much like pornography this is more about keeping sex away from children more than adults. Not that I want my grandmother having to see sick homosexual stuff on her walks either.  This is really a huge 'win-win' for everyone and the ultimate concession that effectively ends the decades of homosexual obsessions and debates and timewasting court games etc.   For the homosexuals there is nothing they can't do. They are 100% absolutely free to hold 'gay parades' in their private gay sex clubs. They are 100% free to hold gay sex indoctrination meetings in their homes. They can watch their slavery and degradation porn all night long at home.   Meanwhile, the majority of people who find homosexuality a vile abomination, a sick weird thing, a mental disorder, a social disease etc... they are just happy. They don't have to see it or hear about it.   It therefore can't be on cakes or ""wedding announcements"" or in any businesses open to the public (over 18 adult clubs are fine to do what they want).  Everyone is happy. Nobody loses. It ends any and all talk about this. It totally takes the wind out of the sales of those who say we should now start treating homosexuals with hostility and begin major counter-attack movements etc.   Everyone wins. Nobody loses. absolutely nobody has to be offended by anyone else. The 'Antigay propaganda' law (so-called) is being written up by citizens groups in the UK, Canada and USA as we speak.  - The key of course is introducing it into law which is being done very keenly and with great planning. Its likely a Republican (probably Trump) may be in the White House branch for 8 upcoming years. This will be the time to introduce it.   Look for some States to introduce it first."

So, why would a legal scholar say this when there's no way in hell this is going to happen?  My first thought was he's got a book coming out.  And, lo and behold... his biography has been republished.  TL;DR:  This guy has a book coming out and needed to get people's attention so he started making stuff up.

Liberal,3cfsdf,dockerhate,6,Tue Jul 7 19:18:21 2015 UTC,"They can't without amending the treaty that created the ICC. As written, the defendant must be present for the trial and can only be tried in absentia when the defendant has repeatedly disrupted the proceedings and had to be removed.  This is similar to the United States, in a way. A defendant has a right to be present for his trial, but if he is disruptive or flees mid-trial, he can be tried in absentia.  Trying in absentia is rarely done because it flies in the face of Due Process. Most judges won't continue a trial even when they could. If the ICC did this, it would give the U.S. another reason to think it's a kangaroo court."

Would it not be impartial of a Bush appointee presided over the case in the US? I'd say that judge could be impartial, but who knows what a judge from the Czech Republic would have to say?

There is a narrative in this country that we must incentivize greed for society to prosper and unfortunately the greedy have chosen to extrapolate the capital from our country rather than reinvest it in their workers.

To relate this to small businesses, I can only reference my personal experience as a dish washer for a tiny Greek place that only had 4 employees, including the cook/owner, during busy weekend nights and 3 during the rest of the week. The owner's son had left to pursue his career as a tattoo artist, meaning he needed a new dishwasher. I must have been the fifteenth guy he tried out, and soon after I failed to close up before midnight several nights in a row, I was also fired.  The business was such that he could not afford to keep someone who needed to adjust to the learning curve. The wage was such that I simply wasn't motivated to work hard enough to close before midnight because the job simply wasn't worth keeping. More than that, though, the economy and the purchasing power of the average person was such that he simply wasn't getting the revenue to deal with training a new employee. He tried several after me and his business eventually failed.  This business was well loved by people all over town, and held a great reputation. The problem is that people couldn't afford to eat there because they weren't being paid enough at their current jobs. Had everyone in town received good paying jobs, then they could have afforded to support it, and it would have been no big deal for him if his new employee needed an extra hour or so to figure out how to close up properly, and it would have been no big deal for the guy the receive a few extra dollars and hour overcoming that learning curve."

So your counterargument is irrelevant. The fact remains, Sanders is running on, ""I'm going to give you free things.""   And most of my information on Sanders' positions come from a pretty unbiased pbs.org. Here is the ""Taxes"" excerpt from that page.   Taxes: Raise some taxes on the wealthy. Cut taxes for middle class.  The current ranking minority member on the Senate Budget Committee, Sanders would nearly double taxes on capital gains and dividends for the wealthiest two percent of Americans. In addition, this year Sanders asked President Obama to use executive action to close six tax deductions benefitting corporations and hedge funds. The Vermont senator would use some of the revenue gained from higher taxes on the rich to lower taxes for middle and lower class Americans.   As for ""avoid paying their fair share like they do now,"" would it surprise you to find out that the top 10% pay 70% of the nation's income taxes? Compare that to the bottom 50% who pay 2.3% of the nation's income taxes. Not to mention that it's not the 10% who benefit the most from government spending. When you look at taxes and government transfer payments, it's essentially the top quintile why pays a net amount in taxes while the other quintiles get more money back than they pay. So forgive me if I don't buy the ""the rich don't pay their fair share"" narrative. It is not based in reality."

He says what he thinks and follows up. That authenticity is sorely missed and I think can draw a lot of people in. His message isn't focus grouped, his ideas have been consistent and validated, he doesn't need or want those who can twist messages to their own devices.

To my mind, economic  and military issues are paramount, and Hillary is only slightly better than, say, a Mitt Romney on this front.    Elites have managed to control the left by throwing them bones on social issues, while working doggedly to cement in place the neoliberal program.  Hillary Clinton is a part of this.  Her role will be to manage expectations of the left.  The money she takes from Goldman, Walmart and god knows who else, is to protect their interests.  Her behavior on TPP was absolutely disgusting -- giving the impression of opposition, while actually being one of the actors who was pushing it through.  We've had 40 years of this kind of behavior from Democrats.  In the long game, it leads to increased cynicism (look at voter turnout and ratings of our government).  I'm uninterested in another liar in the bully pulpit."
Liberal,3c4s79,abudabu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:11:33 2015 UTC,"don't get me wrong. i agree with your position here. and thats why I'm supporting bernie in the primary. But if she becomes the nominee, we need to be prepared to support her. although some of her positions aren't what I would like them to be, there are plenty of issues where Clinton and I are on the same page. I would be hard pressed to think of one thing where I agree with any GOP nominee aside from stupidly obvious things that everyone agrees on, like rapists and those who commit sexual assault should be in prison. Oh wait, Huckabee gave Josh Duggar a pass on that.  I think one of the biggest reasons to support her is the fact that the next president will likely nominate one, two or maybe even three judges to the supreme court (should they be a two term president). Forget all other issues for a moment. What kind of person will Clinton put up there? Who would Bush or Christie or Rubio put up there. Think about how those new judges will influence the court and the entire political process for two decades or longer and you realize it isn't just about the president. its about all the branches of government. Think we would have such a problem with campaign fianance if someone more liberal had been out up there instead of John Roberts? think the gutting of the civil rights act would have happened? Do you think we would have gotten the ruling on the ACA (either of them) or gay marriage if a Republican president had the say when souter or stevens retired?   a vote for clinton (if she is the nominee) is clearly a vote against the other guy, but would we have a choice? Look at how Nader fucked things up for Al Gore (along with a butterfly ballots and a deeply flawed supreme court ruling). Not voting or voting third party could easily hand the presidency to the GOP and we can't allow that to happen"
Liberal,3c4s79,iwasinmybunk,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:03:17 2015 UTC,"I think one of the biggest reasons to support her is the fact that the next president will likely nominate one, two or maybe even three judges to the supreme court (should they be a two term president).    Yeh, I totally hear you on that.   Forget all other issues for a moment.    That is exactly what the DLC is hoping we all do.  It's a devil's bargain.   Not voting or voting third party could easily hand the presidency to the GOP and we can't allow that to happen   You know, I'm genuinely torn on this.  On the one hand, you're absolutely right --- the Republicans will be a disaster zone.  On the other hand, so will Clinton --- just not as much.  And it's important we look at it from that perspective.    The American system has been tweaked by wealthy elites so that we now have two parties which serve the same basic interests, with small variations between the two to give the appearance of choice, like Coke versus Pepsi.  The more similar the two are, the more hot and intemperate the debate becomes on the side issues.    Gaming this out - if Clinton wins, it strengthens the hand of the DLC.  They'll argue that their economically right wing, hawkish policies are the only way that Democrats can win.  And the elites win again.  And from another perspective, pledging your vote to someone --- no matter what --- means that you've given up your bargaining power.  The reliable Democratic voter can be ignored.  That's why things keep drifting further and further right on the economic front.    Rachel Maddow had a great think piece on this several years back: http://www.salon.com/2011/04/05/democrats_51/   The Republicans may not love their base, but they fear them and play to them. The Democratic Party institutional structures of D.C., and the Beltway press in particular, not only hate the Democratic base — they think it’s good politics for Democratic politicians to kick that base publicly whenever possible.  Only the base itself will ever change that."

Liberal,3c6fwa,justthatguy9,7,Sun Jul 5 07:36:44 2015 UTC,"Looking through your comment history, it seems you may not be as conservative as the average person who uses that label today.  No liberal, but not like the average neocon of today.  You do, however, seem to have succumbed to tribalism.  Sticking to your side, and opposing the other guys, even when it makes no logical sense.  This is a serious problem in today's political climate.  It's what makes people jump onto bandwagons that they otherwise would avoid.    Just look at your OP.  You said you don't understand the support for Sanders, then listed seven ways he has earned the support of conservatives.  Can you say the same for any Republican candidate?  Keep in mind that Sanders is not a Democrat.  He's an independent, who cannot run as a third-party candidate because that just doesn't work in America.  Give him another look.  And decide your issues based on their merits, not on which side that might align you with.  Full disclosure:  I'm a registered Republican who broke out of tribal thinking because of George W. Bush.  I was deeply embarrassed by him and what he was doing to the country, even though I had voted for him twice.  When he ran for reelection, I did not want to vote for him, but I suffered from tribalism, and just couldn't see myself ever voting for a Democrat.  I voted for him yet again (and I apologize for that), but by the midterm elections two years later, I was voting Democrat, and haven't seen any reason to go back.  Because of Bush, I started listening to what liberals have to say, rather than letting conservatives tell me ""what liberals really believe.""  Turns out, I agreed with them more than I agreed with the people I had been voting for.  I now consider myself a liberal, and can proudly say that it comes from seriously considering both sides."

I've just watched his presidential announcement speech along with quite a few others and read his website + nytimes + pbs' article on his views. I can say that I do agree on quite a few points, (view on breaking up the Banks and Bank Presidents sitting on the Board of the Federal Reserve + Big Business and Government forming too tight of a relationship). Where I'm coming to disagree with him is on ""climate change"", him being pro-choice, and his voting record on increasing government spending. One thing I noticed that he refrains from stating exactly how he is going to accomplish his goals. I realize it may be too soon in the race to provide specific solutions for political reasons. That said, do you recommend any articles to read up on how he is going to achieve what he's running on?  Lastly, I'll keep in mind the tribalism aspect of my media consumption...I do need to add more alternative points of view."

Name another one who does.  Certainly not the Republicans.    No. 1 on your list... Republicans are the embodiment of corporate control of government.  No. 4...  seriously?

In researching more about Mr. Sanders, I'm coming to find out that I'm agreeing with some of statements and disagreeing with others.   As for No 1: Conservatives are anti-Big Business/Corporate control of Government. May be this is something we can all agree on!   No 4.: The party is split here. However, if we are to stand by our values: 'you do your thing, I do my thing' then we should pro-whatever happens. The thing quite a few people are worried about is the government forcing churches + businesses to shutdown as a result. Not sure if this is paranoia or real...but, based off the last verdict regarding the Klein's it seems not to be paranoia.   No 6.

The closer we get to November 2016, and the louder his message becomes will have more people paying him some attention. Hell, he's getting large crowds now, and as I said, it's still early. I saw him in Minneapolis about a month ago and the line was snaked around the building for 2 blocks.   He's got a message that people want to hear. I would encourage anyone who plans on voting to take a listen to it, particularly if you really think that he's ""too far left"".

I have only donated to a campaign once in my life before. I donated to Ron Paul when he was running for the GOP nod in a campaign, mostly because I found him being a thorn in the side of the GOP wildly amusing.   I donate money to the Sanders campaign every time I get paid. Every two weeks I get paid. Every two weeks Bernie gets paid.   And I am living paycheck to paycheck. I have little in the way of savings. I am exactly the voter that Bernie is designed to appeal to and it shows in my bank account.   But still, I donate to him every two weeks.

But this can't stop us from trying."
Liberal,3byus9,R_A_H,0,Fri Jul 3 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how well the voters inform themselves. They are not going to be inundated with unavoidable campaign ads touting Sanders because Sanders can't afford it. But Sanders is speaking out about everything that is turning America into a third-world country for the vast majority of Americans: Electoral corruption, Wall Street corruption, Banking corruption, student debt, a health care system mainly concerned about maintaining the health of the corporate profits, pointless and immoral wars designed to drain taxpayers' pockets directly into the military-industrial complex. All of these concerns are popular with Americans and none are meaningfully addressed by the current crop of presidential wannabes because you can't talk about anything that is going to hurt the profits of the people that own you. Sanders is the only one that can and does talk about these things and pledge to do something about them (which is a pledge we can believe because he's been walking the walk for forty years) because Sanders is unowned.  So moving forward, if Sanders begins to be seen as more of a threat, more of the candidates - particularly Clinton - are going to shift their rhetoric left. Which means nothing, of course. Talk is cheap and her voting record says it all. The only way that people are going to be made aware that there is someone out there talking about the forces making their lives progressively shittier is either investigating on the internet, mainly (the corporate-owned MSM is worthless), or word-of-mouth. But there are a lot of internet articles out there on Sanders voting record and there are a lot of people out there talking.  The question is whether an honest message addressing the real concerns of the vast majority of American voters can be heard over the corporate-financed bullhorn of, say, Hillary bellowing poll-driven bullshit, and whether Americans are capable of distinguishing between volume and integrity.  I think we are, and I think now is the time. I think it's completely possible that by 2020 corporate control of everything - including the internet - will be complete. There will be no more genuine 'grass roots' candidates. We will be 'led' by whomever the corporations choose and our elections will be no more meaningful than those in Myanmar."

Certainly the threads need to untangled because someone is always being put down.  I am very happy for gay marriage equality.  At the same time I have reservations about entire denominations that would call themselves 'christian' embracing doctrine and liturgy that is clearly not passable as anything but a betrayal of their roots.  I can criticize the 'church' -- the christian church deviated from christianity a very long time ago, perhaps even from the days of it's beginning.

I don't agree with their economic views but I definitely see merit in the ideas. Ayn Rand inspired a lot of their ideas and her work was interesting.

Its indisputable that free speech can be highly dangerous on many levels but if there were ANY restrictions on free speech where would one draw the line on whats OK? and who draws it? Things are bad enough without liberals of all people bitching about other's rights to speak. Whatever ignorant bastard you're referring to has the right to be a dick, just like you have the right to dispute and most importantly you have the right not to listen. What people seem to forget about speech is that it has no power if you ignore it, people seem to think you must have the last word on something or you have somehow ""lost"" when you could just as easily continue letting whoever make an idiot out of themselves. If you take one step towards repressing another's views they become the victim and you the oppressor, after all you only seek to prevent that which you fear. The fact that you suggest we ""combat"" free speech of all things scares the shit out of me and you have lost me as an ally in your otherwise righteous fight. There will always be those who disagree, often irrationally if they want enlightenment they will seek it pushing it upon them only causes them to dispute things all the more, often violently. Difference in opinion stems from difference in perspective not fact if you are already correct then there is nothing more to be said, just be sure you are before you speak else you are engaging in the same ignorance."

I thought people on welfare were lazy, white people didn't have an unfair advantage, and socialism was communism. Then someone got angry with me and told me I was wrong and should educate myself. Well, after a while I questioned what I actually knew and here I am today. I'm asking how do you combat stupidity and useless victimization, coming from the left and now apparently also the right. Not how do you get people to shut up but instead how do you reason with them.  To oppress someone's opinion I would have to make sure it's not heard, which is impossible for the average person to do. They're going to spread ignorance with or without me. But maybe just maybe, they'll actually look beyond themselves like I did at one time. That is what I'm asking. How do you get them to actually look beyond themselves and understand the error in their ways?

Did you feel it necessary to ridicule others for their ""stupid"" beliefs? For someone to change they have to want to change, you didn't change either did you? Just swapped sides when you could no longer rationalize the irrational. So all those dullards out there should ""look beyond themselves"" to find your enlightened viewpoint? Is that it? If you can't see whats wrong with you trying to organize the infliction of your beliefs on others then I shall take my own advice and simply ignore you.

That's literally all this comes down to - restricting marriage is both unconstitutional (equal protection), pointless (because there's no reason to do it), and worse, hurtful (to the LGBT folks out there who just want to live their lives).   As for ridicule, I'm ridiculing your beliefs right now does it make them less valid to you?   Less valid to me? No, of course not, they're my beliefs. However, your goal is probably not to convince me of anything, else you wouldn't have taken this hostile, holier-than-thou tone.

With 5-10% of the population homo or bi sexual, it's unlikely to have become an adult without associating with LGTBQ, so it's not ignorance.  If the quote had been about God's Will not being followed, I would be more understanding, but that smacks of Westboro.  So the question is, if not hate, then what?

Case in point, you mentioned that banning guns was a central part of the Dem platform, when it isn't. That's the first instinct for many of us, but really what most Democrats want is no different from what conservatives want - a way to ensure that firearms are used safely and responsibly.  I would also like to point out that most of us on the far left (compared to the Democrats, who we consider center and center-left) are pro firearm ownership, believing that allowing the individual to do whatever they wish as long as they aren't harming others, e.g. owning firearms, is a cornerstone of liberal values."

After all, the anti-gun organizations that promote these kinds of political efforts used to be frank about their desire to go after private firearm ownership as whole.  That desire to attack gun ownership as a whole has not changed whatsoever, all that has changed is they've wised up on the tactics.  They've realized they can't get support for a full and outright ban of too much, including their favorite starting point, the ""assault weapons"" ban.

If not on the hope of him being elected, then on the hope that it'll prove that there's a portion of the population that is buying what he's selling.  If we keep voting for the sole purpose of keeping x candidate out, everyone will be disappointed in the results.

America will then have a Republican President again.  As for me, I'm British and in British terms i'm a left of centre Conservative which places me as almost extreme left wing by American standards and if I were an American I'd support Sanders' platform almost totally. However, I think the Republican party is a greater danger, both to the world and to the USA and my first priority (both as a Brit and theoretically if I was an American) would be to keep the raging lunatics of the GOP out of power, at least until they move out of the lunatic right wing stance their Septuagenarian majority currently keep them in. Once they move slightly to the centre, then the Democrats could try it too. I believe the USA may be ready for a 'son of Sanders' in perhaps 16 years time."

If you're a Brit, you may be unaware that there's a bit of an ebb and flow with American politics. It's fairly rare for a president to be succeeded by his own party. I believe Bush Sr. is the only exception in quite some time and that was because the Democrats were split between two candidates (so yeah, your concern isn't unfounded). I personally see this as an opportunity. I don't particularly like Hillary and I'm fairly certain she wouldn't win anyway, so I'm gonna feel free to take my vote elsewhere.

Liberal,3bjawi,Anzat,-3,Tue Jun 30 01:58:51 2015 UTC,"Tl;Dr: forcing the south to have gay marriage so gays can get married is like forcing India to produce beef so meat eaters can eat beef. This argument is made on the basis of states rights, which is literally the equivalent of local autonomy. If you don't believe in American Exceptionalism or that the United States should control every nation-state on the planet, you should support states rights and local autonomy. If you somehow associate states rights with slavery, please check this TrueReddit post about why this is wrong.  The moral paradigm in the United States has shifted in such a way that the majority of the population across the union believes that gays should have the right to marry and women should have access to abortions. However, at the same time, there is a significant portion of the population that does not hold these values or beliefs. I live in California, so what The South does (generally speaking) has no effect on my life whatsoever. However, when we start enacting policies that affect the whole of the United States - specifically through the federal government - things start getting more complicated and things start giving me a headache.  I'm glad that you cite the examples of gay marriage and women's access to abortions, because it's the perfect example that captures the polarity and resistance to federal policies and oversight.  Liberals were trying to push the rights for gays to marry through the federal government.  At the same time, conservatives were trying to push federal legislation that would remove the ability of women to have access to abortions nationwide.  So on one hand we have the liberals pushing a social issue through the federal government at the expense of conservatives, and the other we have the conservatives pushing a social issue through the federal government at the expense of everyone else.  At this point it could be argued that the South is in the wrong and they should stop trying to limit the liberties of gays and homosexuals and should stop trying to push legislation that would remove women's access to abortions. Obviously they're in the wrong and they should stop limiting the rights of people. However, by taking this stance, we make a couple of presumptions: the first being that rights of individuals should preside over the rights of institutions; and second, the institution of marriage in general is one that should be preserved.  The second presumption is an entirely different debate (Should we keep marriage although - at around 50% failure rate - the institution itself appears to be failing?).  The first presumption naturally brings up a more existential question. What is a ""right""? Is it a human right? Is it a right under the law? Or is it a ""right"" because it is what is ""morally just"" or ""morally correct""?   To this question I pose another: Should we force the whole of India to start producing beef even though a significant portion of the population is morally opposed to the production and consumption of beef? They hold this belief based on religious principles; the same measure through which the Religious South in the United States reject and resist gay marriage and abortion.   Should we force the whole of India to start producing beef because meat eaters can't get access to beef in specific states in India? Or should we allow the specific states and unions in India to decide whether they want to produce beef?   This is the conundrum we face in the United States, although with different faces and names.  Slavery was a completely different ball game. When we look at history, slavery was heavily immoral, but it was an institution that was ingrained into the southern economy. The South was benefiting off the free work and enslavement of an entire race of people.   The war was about slavery, but indirectly it was about state rights. In this case, state rights were perpetuating an immoral institution that was also a cornerstone of the southern economy; creating an intensely unfair market advantage for the south. I would argue the only reason we had a civil war was because of this. Imagine that market advantage - free labor to produce everything in the economy.   I do not think making the comparison of gay rights to slavery is a fair comparison for that reason, and I would like to readdress the question of why state rights over federal government is a bad idea.  Do you want to talk about environmental regulation? I can talk about that for days.   I'm green party, by the way, so please don't make presumptions that I'm biased for republicans. Because I'm not."

Yes it just happens to fall on the Conservative side of the issue, but, my understanding is that he is fighting for something larger than marriage equality here.   It appears to me that he is instead fighting to limit large Federal Government and to limit the reach Federal Government has on the American people. He personally sides with gay people, he's defended them, and will fight for them. But, he is also and even more so, an advocate for individualism. Instead of the Federal Government telling the states what to do, he is reminding everyone that marriage isn't an issue Federal Government should be dealing with anyway.   It was never mentioned in the original Constitution, it was never mentioned in the Bill of Rights, and, to my knowledge, it was never made an amendment.   I believe that he is arguing that it is the responsibility of the states to determine how they individually want to handle marriage. Yes, that will end up with certain states not recognizing marriage equality, but that isn't anything that can't be changed.   All it would take is strong societal support. Eventually, I don't see why all 50 states won't recognize marriage equality, but I don't think forcing states to do so is the answer."

People are being incarcerated daily for something that's ""legal"" in another state.

Some states would probably still be segregated and have bans on interracial marriage. Marriage equality would still be a pipe dream, and businesses or even government employers would have institutionalized discrimination.   If you really value liberty, you should hold that individuals have fundamental rights that should be respected no matter who they happen to share state boundaries with. Individual liberties are far more important than the non-existent right of dumbasses to oppress other people by majority vote.    Who's to tell anyone that they are wrong? Yes they are oppressing minorities in their cities, yes they are only slowing us down as a society, but do we need to pay them attention? Why not just let them fester in their hate boiled lives    Because the stupid bigots aren't the ones suffering from festering in their hate boiled lives. Perfectly good American citizens around them are suffering for their stupidity. Gay people or minorities who may live in places like Alabama and Texas for family reasons, or job reasons, or any other reason should not be treated as less human or have fewer fundamental rights than their counterparts in New York or California just because their neighbors vote for idiots.

Liberal,3bjawi,amyts,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:57:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I agree. Marriage is totally incompatible with the increasing urbanization and ending of gender roles in our society. It needs to be fundamentally thought out to support our modern needs. In my opinion, it's an old tradition that costs more than it's worth. Just look hoe many more divorces are happening. Look how many more children are being split. I might think this for different reasons than him, but marriage needs some serious work."
Liberal,3bjawi,SeismicAltop,3,Mon Jun 29 20:05:10 2015 UTC,Do you have any thoughts on how the institution of marriage could be reformed and improved?
Liberal,3bjawi,amyts,0,Mon Jun 29 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"This is probably a very facile point and has been easily argued against before, but here goes. I think we should get rid of every single incentive that comes with being married. The only incentive of marriage should be that a couple gets to be together and to also have a child. Instead, incentives should be based on some kind of gauge of the child's well-being. Although I have no idea of how this would be implemented, it seems like a good idea. I think the main problem now is that there are a lot of incentives to getting married: tax benefits and such. That seems contradictory to the idea of marriage. I feel that right now we have shortsighted people getting married and they're not looking at the long term effects that really matter: a child and love. That's my two-cents. I'm no lawyer, no politician, and I'm not married, but I still think marriage needs some serious change.    Edit: apostrophe"

Marriage extends into every aspect of our society.  It affects property rights, inheritance, power of attorney, medical power of attorney, taxes, custody, domestic violence laws, and so much more.    If government wasn't involved in marriage at all, what would happen if two parents divorce with children?  Who gets the children, and who gets the assets?  If you expect this to be answered in the courts, congratulations, you just brought the government back into marriage.  Getting the government out of marriage would mean all of those laws go away.

Liberal,3bjawi,nikdahl,2,Tue Jun 30 02:39:56 2015 UTC,The term is of French origin and is much younger than the concept. The concept of a formal legal union between two people predates Christianity and Judaism. By no means do Christians have any sort of monopoly on either the term or the concept.
Liberal,3bjawi,bokono,-2,Tue Jun 30 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"I'm already aware of everything you are saying. Here's what I'm saying.  To you and me, it doesn't matter what it's called. Civil Union, Legal Partnership, Marriage, Jail, etc.  To the religious and to conservatives, it most definitely DOES matter. Marriage is obviously a sacred concept to some/most of them (right or wrong, it does not matter).  Why continue to use the word, when the easiest possible solution for everyone involved, would be to use a different word. Then you no longer have to be concerned with ruining the ""Sanctity of marriage"", because there is no longer and government sanctioned marriage, only government sanctioned legal partnerships."
Liberal,3bjawi,amyts,2,Tue Jun 30 03:01:50 2015 UTC,"To me it definitely matters what it's called. It's called equality for a reason. LGBT people deserve the same treatment and rights as everyone else. Christians don't own the word marriage and they don't own the concept.   As I said before, the concept of marriage predates Abrahamic religion. There have been various times in history when gay and lesbian people were allowed to marry. It's fine that Christians consider their marriage ceremonies to be holy. No one is contesting their beliefs. But marriage is the formal legal union between two people. They have no expectation that others should share their beliefs."
Liberal,3bjawi,nikdahl,4,Tue Jun 30 03:09:39 2015 UTC,"Religious institutions don't own the concept of marriage, nor should they.  They will also continue their objections, no matter what you rename it to."
Liberal,3bjawi,Valendr0s,-5,Mon Jun 29 21:15:47 2015 UTC,"No one should own it, that's the whole point. When you have an institution (government) telling people who can and can't marry, then that institution ""owns"" marriage. If government no longer owns it, then the term itself is meaningless to anyone that doesn't care about the ""sanctity"". Religions can go on espousing the sanctity, and continue denying same sex marriages, because that is their right. They can define marriage how they want, and that's really all they want.  ""Sanctity"" being one of the major objections to same-sex marriage, you have just eliminated one of their primary arguments. Then it becomes much more clear that this debate isn't really about the sanctity of marriage, it's about bigotry and homophobia. They can try to make that argument if they want, but it won't end well.  Meanwhile, we have this other defined legal union, which has no connotations, and is simply a legal union."
Liberal,3bjawi,amyts,-1,Mon Jun 29 21:23:47 2015 UTC,You shouldn't need government to bless your decision to marry. At most it should be a form akin to getting a passport or starting a corporation.
Liberal,3bjawi,Valendr0s,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:07:42 2015 UTC,"The government isn't ""blessing"" your decision to marry anymore than it blesses the formation of a corporation.

Liberal,3bjawi,Player_17,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you, but on my marriage form there was a location that it took either a justice of the peace or an ordained minister to sign. If it were the same as articles of incorporation, any notary could do it.  So it is 'similar', but it is most certainly not 'precisely' the same. And those differences matter greatly.    As for government getting out of marriage completely - At this point, with all the added benefits that come from marriage, it's impossible. It'd be like not getting a child a birth certificate or a social security number.  Besides, the civil union is precisely what you do the registration for. Anybody could just have any ceremony they want (or not) and say they're married. There just aren't any laws around granting the rights provided to married couples when you don't have the proof.  It's like changing your name. You can have anybody call you whatever you want - but the government has you down legally as your birth name until you change it.    At any rate. From a libertarian perspective, Rand Paul doesn't think that the government should be granting married couples any special rights anyway - so that's why he's so fine with dropping civil marriage completely.  And I'm not too sure I completely disagree. Does the government need to step in and grant further incentive to marriage? The best argument I can think of for civilly-recognized marriage is for inheritance. The rest is politicians trying to look 'pro family', whatever that means."
Liberal,3bjawi,SeismicAltop,-2,Tue Jun 30 19:08:25 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you don't really understand what's being discussed here. When people say that the government should get out of the business of marriage, it doesn't mean that the government shouldn't recognize marriage. It means that the government shouldn't be licensing marriage. The idea is that you shouldn't have to apply/pay for the privalege of getting a license from the state allowing you to marry. In the proposed system getting married is considered a right, not something you have to have permission to do.   No one is saying the government shouldn't be able to adjudicate custody disputes, or enact laws concerning joint property. They are just saying that you should be able to enter into the contract of marriage without having to get a license from the state, because if the government can allow you to marry, that means they can also not allow it."

Liberal,3bjawi,swannsonite,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:31:42 2015 UTC,"About 15 years ago (before even Civil Unions in the UK) a friend of mine who happens to be Lesbian had a disturbingly traumatic experience.  She'd had a difficult life, born in Australia her mother was Vietnamese her father Australian. When she was about 14 she moved with her Military family to Germany, a couple of years later she 'came out' as Lesbian, her father was supportive but her mother threw an eeby jeeby fit; long story short her mother left her father and set up with an American officer, (eventually marrying and settling in USA). This of course loaded her with an enormous amount of guilt. Two years after this she settled down with a German partner and took up domicile in Germany. This partnership didn't last and eventually she met a second partner a Brit, (this is where I met her).  She moved to Britain with her new 'partner' and together they bought a family home, but due to the laws at that time they couldn't co-own the house so it was put in her partners name, even though they both paid equally for the mortgage and upkeep. Her partner's parents were totally against their partnership and cut off all relations with their daughter and her partner.  Then disaster struck, her partner was diagnosed with highly developed terminal cancer (I don't know what type) and given less than 6 months to live. Due to the law at the time my friend had no legal access to her partner and due to her partners parents virulent anti-gay stance they prevented her from gaining any access to her partner, her partner died a few months later and she never saw her and was even barred from the funeral. To make matters worse, her parents were now owners of their house and they kicked her out into the streets and sold 'her' house from under her, (she shared my home for a few months until her father flew in from Australia).  This to me is one very powerful reason why marriage protection in law is central to equality, and is why I'm totally against Rand Paul's stupid reasoning that state-wide bigotry should be permitted. It is a  prime role of governments to protect the vulnerable against the tyranny of the majority and so long as doing so causes no physical harm to any other mandatory protection is a moral duty."

Liberal,3bj0lt,spaceghoti,5,Mon Jun 29 16:56:57 2015 UTC,Some on the right have proposed eliminating SCOTUS. That would certainly open the door to all kinds of gun restriction laws.
Liberal,3bj0lt,rivalarrival,9,Mon Jun 29 20:15:38 2015 UTC,"The only major gun control efforts presented at the federal level in the past several years have been Manchin-Toomey and Grassley-Cruz. Manchin-Toomey would have established ""Universal"" background checks. Considering that only Manchin-Toomey is strongly opposed by ""gun nuts"", I'm pretty sure that's what the author thinks should have been enacted.     Manchin-Toomey would have expanded the background check requirement from just FFL dealers to include all private ""sellers"", save those closely related to the ""buyer"".    Grassley-Cruz would not have mandated background checks, but would have made NICS available to the public directly, instead of only through FFL dealers as it is currently limited. For the first time, private sellers would have direct access to NICS ""go/no-go"" verification.   (It is important to note that the terms ""buyer"" and ""seller"" are misnomers as used in regards to this legislation, as they apply not just to buyers and sellers, but also lenders, borrowers, and anyone else who might find themselves in physical possession of a firearm with little regard to who actually owns it.)  A simple analogy makes obvious the problem with Manchin-Toomey.  Look at the rules for transferring cars.  Under current law, you can't just give a random person some money in exchange for their car. You have to contact your state's title agency and formally transfer the car from the seller before you can call it yours. This title transfer is analogous to a background check. Here's the problem: Have you ever driven a car that was owned by someone else?  Have you ever borrowed a car from a friend? Ever lent your truck to a friend?  I've got a utility trailer in my driveway right now that I have been borrowing from a distant relative. If we applied Manchin-Toomey to vehicles, you'd have to go down to the DMV before you could move your friend's car out of the driveway so his car isn't blocking your sister from getting to work.   Here's the important thing to remember: Regardless of Manchin-Toomey or Grassley-Cruz, the law currently says you can't sell to felons. (Also, persons adjudicated mentally incompetent, but for simplicity, I'll simply use the word ""felon"" to refer to persons legally prohibited from owning guns for any reason.) The courts have interpreted that law to mean you can't knowingly sell to a felon. They made this interpretation long before NICS came into existence, and it was a reasonable interpretation in light of the fact that there is still no reasonably accessible, sufficiently reliable means for a layperson to distinguish between a law-abiding citizen and a formerly convicted felon unless that felon discloses his status as a felon. What this means is that so long as the seller doesn't ask if the buyer is a felon, and the buyer doesn't voluntarily disclose that fact either, the seller cannot be convicted of selling to this felon.   Manchin-Toomey is an attempt to close the so-called ""gun show loophole"", where a buyer can purchase a gun from a private seller without requiring a background check. But, what a background check is actually doing is enforcing the law against selling to felons.   I don't think Grassley-Cruz realized what exactly they were doing when they suggested opening NICS up to the public. Cruz promoted it as a way for sellers to voluntarily take personal responsibility for their sales, but there would have been a major change in the courts. With a reasonable method available to any seller for verifying any buyer's status, the courts would have stripped knowingly from their earlier interpretation. They would have said ""As sellers are prohibited from selling to felons, and as sellers now have a reasonable means of reliably distinguishing lawful buyers from prohibited buyers, sellers now have a duty to ensure their buyers are not felons. A seller who fails to make a reasonable attempt at verifying a buyer is not a felon has behaved recklessly and negligently.""  (Of course, the fact that a buyer could have passed a check at the time of transfer is prima facie evidence that the seller has done his due diligence.)  Grassley-Cruz would not have been just about personal responsibility. In practice, Grassley-Cruz would have enacted universal checks by allowing the judiciary to re-interpret the law prohibiting all sales to felons, and not just in cases where the seller knew the buyer was a felon.   Grassley-Cruz would not have merely given the public access to NICS. It would have established a simple framework that would have markedly improved the current law without impinging on the typical, inoffensive activities of law-abiding Americans. Grassley-Cruz would have closed the so-called ""Gun Show Loophole"" by making it an act of gross criminal negligence for a seller to sell a gun to an anonymous buyer without conducting a background check, but without criminalizing two law-abiding friends simply trading guns with eachother.   tl;dr: If you wanted to enact a sensible gun restriction law, you should support something like Grassley-Cruz, the bill that gave gun control advocates everything they claimed they wanted; gave sellers a reliable means of identifying responsible buyers from felons; and did this without negatively affecting responsible, law-abiding gun owners.  If instead your actual intention is simply to harass law-abiding gun owners and create a massive bureaucracy where none is actually needed, you're looking for Manchin-Toomey, or a comparable ""'Universal' Background Check"" bill.  And if that was still too long for you: Fuck UBCs, give me access to NICS."

It's solely a progressive endeavor. But prohibition of firearms isn't how we'll fix it, not by a long shot. Solving the social problems that cause people to want to commit violent crime is the only way we'll ever win that battle.   ...the gun people become unhinged and declare that there's a war being waged on them.   ""...the impossibility of passing any sort of gun restriction laws.""  Restricting firearms is a war on firearms. It's the same kind of prohibition that has failed us every step of the way in the War on Drugs. You can't prevent people from doing something they want to do, you can only hope to change their minds about wanting to do it.   In no other first world country are gun deaths so prevalent.   Because in no other first world country is the desire to commit violent crime so prevalent. That has nothing at all to do with the presence of firearms, and everything to do with the fact that also in no other first world country is social inequality, poverty, lack of education, and lack of comprehensive and accessible mental healthcare so prevalent.  If you want to fight violent crime, solve those problems, and no one will have a reason to use a firearm against their fellow citizens.  If you think you can ban firearms without eliminating the desire to misuse them, you'll just create a black market, like for drugs and alcohol during Prohibition.   And where is this talk about funding health care any other time?   What are you talking about? I'm a tax and spend liberal and a socialist. It's basically all I ever talk about... I was talking about it three hours ago.   Where's the NRA backed mental health bill?

You're not having a debate about that. If you were, you'd be talking about the social problems I mentioned above, rather than asserting that the mere existence of firearms causes people to act violently.  [copy/paste]  The US may have the highest gun proliferation of any other country, but many of the most peaceful countries also have extremely high firearms proliferation as well. [A],[B]  1 in 2 citizens in Switzerland owns or has access to a firearm (this isn't counting government owned firearms that civilians have access to.) The homicide rate is .52/100,000 annually.  There's 1 firearm for every 2 citizens of Finland. The homicide by firearms rate in Finland is .26/100,000 annually.  1/3 for Sweden. The homicide rate is .19/100,000 annually.  1/3 for Norway. The homicide rate is .04/100,000 annually.  1/3 for France. The homicide rate is .22/100,000 annually.  1/3 for Canada. The homicide rate is .51/100,000 annually.  1/3 for Austria. The homicide rate is .18/100,000 annually.  1/3 for Germany. The homicide rate is .20/100,000 annually.  1/3 for Iceland. The homicide rate is .32/100,000 annually.  Meanwhile, some countries with low firearm proliferation have extremely high homicide rates -  There's only 1 firearm for every 16 citizens of Honduras, yet the homicide by firearms rate is the highest in the world at 64.8/100,000 annually.  1/16 for El Salvador. The homicide rate is 40/100,000 annually.  1/12 for Jamaica. The homicide rate is 40/100,000 annually.  1/10 for Venezuela. The homicide rate is 39/100,000 annually.  1/15 for Swaziland. The homicide rate is 37/100,000 annually.  1/8 for Guatemala. The homicide rate is 35/100,000 annually.  1/16 for Colombia. The homicide rate is 27/100,000 annually.  1/12 for Brazil. The homicide rate is 18/100,000 annually.  The fact remains, one way or the other, that firearm ownership simply isn't a very good indicator of the prevalence of violent crime; and why would it be? The mere presence of firearms in and of itself doesn't make people want to murder one another, and the data clearly demonstrates this fact.  If countries with extremely high levels of firearms proliferation can have low levels of violent crime, and countries with low levels of firearms proliferation can be the most violent countries in the world, it should be obvious that the presence of firearms isn't the common factor causing violent crime.  On the other hand, another pattern is glaringly obvious - countries with relatively low levels of inequality and poverty, like the Nordic countries, and Canada, Austria, and Germany, have low levels of violent crime.  Likewise, countries with higher levels of inequality and poverty, El Salvador, Jamaica, Swaziland, Guatemala, Colombia, and Brazil all have higher levels of violent crime."

Liberal,3bj0lt,spookyjohnathan,-1,Mon Jun 29 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"Much in the same way saying Happy Holidays is a War on Christmas.   Absolutely incorrect. No one is trying to infringe anyone's right to celebrate Christmas when they say happy holidays. On the other hand, restricting the rights of Americans to own and use firearms is exactly what it sounds like.   ""You're not saying what I demand you say, therefore you're wrong.""   Wrong again. My point is that you're not talking about what causes violent crime. You think you already know what causes violent crime, firearms, and what you want to talk about is how to restrict them.  To use Charleston as an example, you're asserting that firearms are what caused a racist white supremacist, looking for someone to blame for America's social problems, to want to attack black Americans. I think lack of education is one of the main reasons racists are racists, and that the presence firearms isn't what makes them that way."

Liberal,3bj0lt,rivalarrival,2,Mon Jun 29 21:48:38 2015 UTC,"You literally just told me I'm not having the debate you want me to have as to why I'm wrong.    Ok. Let's have your debate. You opened it up with this comment:   Small wonder there's no calm, reasoned discussion about guns in America. At the slightest suggestion of ""hey, people are dying for no reason. Maybe we could work together and fix that?"" the gun people become unhinged and declare that there's a war being waged on them.   There have been two major federal-level gun control proposals made in the last few years.  The first was Manchin-Toomey, which was a so-called ""Universal"" background check bill. The other was Grassley-Cruz, which would have opened up NICS to the general public, providing private sellers with the ability to conduct background checks on their buyers.   The real ""loophole"" is that sellers can potentially sell to felons without committing a crime. This isn't due to the ""gun show loophole"", where a private sale doesn't require a background check. This is actually due to the ""ignorant seller loophole"", where the courts have basically decided that a private seller hasn't committed a crime until he has knowingly sold a gun to a felon. He's free to sell a gun to a felon, provided he doesn't know he's a felon. He's essentially free to remain willfully ignorant about his buyer's status. In some ways, he's enticed to do so.   Manchin-Toomey attempts to close this loophole directly, by requiring ""sellers"" to conduct a background check before transferring a gun. The problem with Manchin-Toomey is that it doesn't just obligate ""sellers"" to conduct background checks. It also requires ""transferers"" to conduct background checks. If we applied Manchin-Toomey to automobiles, you'd have to run down to the DMV before moving your buddy's car out of your driveway so your sister could get her car out and go to work. If this was the way that ""borrowing a car"" worked, you'd agree that there was a war being waged on responsible drivers.    The effect of Grassley-Cruz is a little less direct in its approach, but much more narrowly focused on the problematic behavior. I doubt Grassley and Cruz even considered this ramification of their bill, but it would certainly have happened:  The courts currently have to give sellers the benefit of the doubt because there is no feasible means for a private seller to verify a buyer's status.  Grassley-Cruz would have provided such a means, so the courts could - and would - reinterpret the law prohibiting sale to felons as an obligation of the seller to perform his due diligence in ensuring the buyer is not a felon. With public access to NICS, not only can sellers know, sellers are also assumed to know. Effectively, any seller who actually sells to a felon must be able to prove that he performed his due diligence, or he will be convicted. But, the fact that the buyer is a non-felon is prima facie evidence that the seller performed his due diligence.  If their actual intention was to make it riskier for irresponsible sellers to sell guns; if their actual intention was to make it harder for felons to buy guns; then Liberals, Progressives, and Democrats should have immediately abandoned Manchin-Toomey, and jumped all over the Grassley-Cruz plan. They should have made it very clear in the legislative record the courts would use to interpret the law that the law was intended to both provide a means, and create a duty, for sellers to verify a buyer's background.  They should have hijacked Grassley's and Cruz's initial intention, and stated their own reasons for why such a bill should be supported. They should have made it clear to the courts how the Grassley-Cruz bill should be interpreted, and either watched the GOP pass a sensible gun control bill, or backpedal away from their own bill.   Grassley-Cruz would have made it infinitely easier to charge and convict irresponsible sellers, but it would not have affected responsible gun owners in the slightest: the fact that a buyer could have passed a background check at the time of transfer is prima facie evidence that the seller performed his due diligence. I could continue to trade guns with my shooting buddies with impunity, but the moment I start dealing with an anonymous buyer, I risk a prison sentence if I don't conduct a check.   Now, I have made calm, reasoned arguments regarding both of the major, federal-level gun control proposals made in the past few years. Both of those proposals would have achieved the same basic goals: making it easier to prosecute irresponsible sellers, and making it harder for prohibited persons from obtaining guns. The two proposals operate in significantly different manners. One of these proposals will garner support from responsible gun owners; the other will cause those same responsible gun owners to come unhinged and declare that there is a war being waged on them.   You're now well aware of both plans. I've had numerous anti-gun fuckwits bash my head in with UBC bills, and most of them have more or less claimed they don't want to declare war on gun owners. You say you want calm, reasonable discussion on these issues. Are you going to continue to support the kind of bills declaring war on responsible gun owners, or are you going to push for a mutually beneficial bill providing public access to NICS?"

Consider the UK, with much stricter gun control, but a thriving firearms black market and extremely high illegal firearms proliferation.  Yet the UK has far less violent crime than the US, because criminals in the UK have less reason to want to commit violence thanks to (relatively) progressive social policies including better education, economic opportunity, welfare, and accessible healthcare.  Educate and inform a person and they won't fall for racist misinformation. Give a person a good job, and he won't become involved in crime. Feed a starving person, and he won't consider robbing to get a bite to eat. Make it easier to diagnose and treat antisocial mental disorders, and people suffering from them won't have a chance to act on them.  Even if we could afford to waste our political capital trying to ban firearms, we would only succeed in spurring the already present firearms black market.

Very rarely can police actually intervene in a violent crime in progress. Over the past 15 years or so, our society has come to understand this. We have come to understand that when seconds count, police are just minutes away. We've come to understand that yes, the police will come to our aid when called, but it's our responsibility to survive until they show up.  ""Doors"" are a feature of homes, cars, etc. They are not a feature available to pedestrians, and they are readily defeated by a determined adversary.  The purpose of an alarm is to ask armed people to intervene on your behalf. Why not simply be one of those armed people in the first place? Furthermore, the prevalence of false alarms has rendered any type of alarm nearly worthless. Dogs are suitable for defending a home, not an individual. Dogs bring with them much greater liability than guns.  Each year, more than 4.5 million people are bitten by dogs, 350,000 people visit the emergency room, and 850,000 receive some sort of professional medical treatment for dog bites. Because guns require human involvement to cause injury and dogs do not, you are far more likely to be unintentionally injured by a dog than a gun.  Pepper spray can be a feasible defensive weapon, but its range, effectiveness, and mode of stopping an attack is extremely limited compared to a firearm. Pepper can be just as viable as, and even superior to guns in certain situations. Unfortunately, the victim of a violent crime is extremely limited in her ability to define those circumstances.

Surely responsible firearm ownership saves more lives than the 700 a year caused by irresponsible firearm use...  It seems likely that the trope doesn't take into consideration the distinction between accidental firearms deaths and firearms related homicide, i.e. the trope is that you're more likely to be killed by a firearm someone else is using than to be able to defend yourself with one that you own, but in that case, we're talking about something that is beyond your control, and has no bearing on your own decision to own a firearm or not.

So far in support of your claim you've suggested such scientific methods as looking at the number of results of a google search to determine the gravity of the firearms problem.   You can just ""gun control""...   This isn't a post about gun control, it's a post about ""gun restriction"", i.e. banning firearms and eliminating the right of Americans to keep them. If we wanted to talk about gun control, we'd be talking about background checks and licensing, neither of which are relevant to Charleston or the vast majority of firearms related violent crime.   Even young progressive minded people have lost the plot and now equate any gun control advocates with the kind of words usually used to describe anti-vaxxers or climate deniers.   That's funny, because as a young progressive and gun-control advocate, I'm the one arguing on the pro-firearms side here.  Progressives are supposed to be the ones who consider the facts and information, and carefully consider the implications of our policy decisions.

There's a damn good reason for that:  In 1993, there were fewer than one million concealed carry permits issued in the US, and the violent crime and murder rates were at their highest points in the 20th century. Now, 22 years later, we have more than 15 million concealed carry permits issued, and violent crime rates are lower than they were at any point in the 20th century.  Remember that number: 15 million concealed carriers. 15 million men and women, carrying guns on a daily basis, exposing their children to lawful, responsible gun use. 15 million. To put that number into perspective, the NRA has only around 4 million members.  Read the writing on the wall: Gun control's last hurrah was the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 1994, which expired a decade ago.  Gun control has been dying for 21 years. The people currently ""fucking"" us on gun control issues are those people who have been ignoring the reality of the situation for two decades and keep pushing regressive gun policies.  You're absolutely right: Gun control is the liberal equivalent of anti-vax and climate denial, and we would be much better off ignoring these fuckwits than embracing their philosophies."

But, this is also irrelevant to the actual point I was making. I wasn't trying to prove there was a causal relationship between increasing guns and decreasing crimes. I was merely disproving the idea that increasing guns increases crime. It does not. There is no evidence that suggests decreasing guns will decrease crime rates. The fundamental premise of ""gun control"" is faulty. Carry rates are higher than ever and climbing, while crime rates are lower than ever and continuing to fall.   In light of these facts, it seems the real reason that people are calling for additional gun restrictions is not due to the rapidly diminishing actual threat of gun crime, but merely out of fear of guns themselves."

Read things to learn and understand them, and if you arrive at a liberal viewpoint then all the better. But you cannot expect to convince others of your opinion if you don't know how you formed it in the first place.   To expand, when I first got interested in politics I thought my views were very right-libertarian. But the more I learned about the actual philosophy behind the policies and ideas, the more I realized that wasn't for me. That's not to say I disagree with everything that would be considered a conservative view, I don't, but I know what I agree with and what I don't.   It really just comes from researching things from unbiased sources, or as many different biases as you can. Some things like Fox News are garbage, but WSJ and Economist are conservative leaning journals that are worth reading even if you're a liberal.   On the tangible side of things, Pikkety is one of the big names in economics right now, and learning at least some basic principles of economics is essential to talking intelligently about politics. Reading both Marx and Ayn Rand, and critiques by both sides against them, might help you decide just how far to one side you fall economically. There's tons of resources for that online, but a lot will require some heavy reading.   Concerning actual issues, getting lost in Wikipedia or university lectures you can find online and learning the underlying reasons behind them, not just the stuff you'll see in headlines or discussed on a major news channel, can be a great place to start. If your friends are talking about for example, Middle Eastern tensions, and are listing off all these random statistics and strategies but don't even know which countries are Sunni and which are Shia, they're likely not going to be discussing these things very deeply. That's why you do that should instead. Non-biased history is a fantastic teacher, and history is never as far away as you think it is."

Or this is what I would have guessed.  I just went there and one of the first things that pops up is a swastika t-shirt.  You're right, this is fucked up."
Liberal,3bg22e,Homerpaintbucket,2,Sun Jun 28 22:35:13 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested in seeing the items with swastikas. It's a shame Americans don't know that swastikas pre-date the Nazi theft of the symbol -- by thousands of years. It was used both in Asia and in pre-Columbian America. We often see outraged postings of photos of ceramics and other ancient Asian artworks that have swastikas in the design, and they're hundreds or thousands of years old. I'm sorry that the meaning of the symbol has been corrupted (apparently forever) by the evil that the Nazis still represent.  Two other things: the flag being hated lately is not the flag of the Confederate States of America. Wikipedia shows several of the variants, all similar but for the number of stars in the circle. The flag being vilified lately is the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia, shown here.  Second, the recent flap over that battle flag will die out shortly. Personally, I support removing it from state properties and where it is flown by a state or local government given that the battle flag represents the fight to maintain slavery; private persons may fly the flag as they wish, again in my personal opinion. Private persons may have their opinion on what it means, and I may have my opinion about what that says about those private persons. It's a more or less free country."

So the fact that it was just a battle flag for a few brigades doesn't change what its meaning is nowadays.  The main thing that perplexes me is why is the flag now so controversial? I remember watching Dukes of Hazzard as a kid and don't remember one single claim of outrage that the General Lee had a Confederate flag paint job. Many of our Universities and High Schools still have ""Rebels"" as their official mascot. It would be like Germany being ambivalent about the Nazi flag until recently when a few Jews get killed by a Neo-Nazi, and then all of a sudden it has to be removed 60 years after the Holocaust. Are we just that more sensitive as a society where things that didn't bother us 30 years ago are intolerable today? Are people simply offended much more easily for some reason?"
Liberal,3bg22e,super_ag,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:27:06 2015 UTC,"Are we just that more sensitive as a society where things that didn't bother us 30 years ago are intolerable today? Are people simply offended much more easily for some reason?   Times change, and acceptable behavior varies, too. You'll find as you grow older, you'll notice more changes.  Some of us recall when schools were segregated, and the words used for references to black people in the south could be said in polite white company. You don't know about the days of casual racism when a southern jokes were all in dialect and black people were excluded from white residential areas.   To say that people are 'simply offended more easily' betrays your lack of the experiences of living in a stratified, racist world where black people were excluded from restaurants, movie theaters, and other public places on the basis of their skin.  The problem is that racism has moved to more subtle means than outright bans based on skin color. The use of 'rebels' as the official mascot is still racist, even as excluding black people from the restaurants was. Thankfully, times have changed so that the last fruit of the overt red-necked racism are now being plucked. And rightfully so.   In a way, I'm happy you're so blind to the racism in celebrating the 'confederacy,' which attempted to destroy America so that its states could continue owning, selling, and maiming people on the basis of their skin color. To continue to celebrate that tradition as something other than brutal inhumanity to Man is to be blind to what the confederacy existed for.   Each state gave its reasons for secession. South Carolina's statement lives here. The basic reason for withdrawal from the Union was the violation by northern states of the Constitutional requirement to return escaped slaves (which gives examples for several paragraphs).  Whatever other reasons people now give (states rights, for example) ignores the stated reason of the continued existence of slavery in South Carolina. For example,    These ends it endeavored to accomplish by a Federal Government, in which each State was recognized as an equal, and had separate control over its own institutions. The right of property in slaves was recognized by giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor.     It is clear that the reason for secession is slavery and the refusal of sister states in the north to recognize the rights of citizens (white, of course) to have the return of their escaped property enforced in northern states.  But let's look again at current racism represented by the battle flag. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church has a long history in Charleston, which I fear you don't know. Wikipedia's article on the Emanuel AME Church points out that it was established in 1816 (members of the Emanuel AME left their original church because it was white and refused burial to black congregants). South Carolina laws required black churches to have services only during daylight and required a majority membership of whites. For violations of these laws, Charleston officials arrested over a hundred members of the black church and carried out lashings and fines against the leaders of the church. In 1822, members of the church were accused of aiding black slaves to escape and after a secret trial, the church was burned to the ground, and several members of the church were executed. In 1834, all-black churches were outlawed in Charleston, so the congregation met in secret.  At the end of the Civil War, the congregation could come out of hiding and meet in public again. The church building was rebuilt after the war; the current building was put up in 1891.   I will point out that the murders taking place in the historic church this month were carried out with the announced view of starting a race war, and that the murderer drove a long distance to carry out the murders at the Emanuel AME Church; I believe he'll be found to have done the murders at this particular church because of its history as  a black church. I'm sure you've seen all the photos the murderer posted showing himself with the battle flag.   For you now to miss his point and be unable to see why his use of the rebel flag to symbolize his desire to resegregate the US and to start a race war is depressing. It's not that we're more sensitive, it's that racism in the south is becoming more blatant and the symbol of that more blatant racism is the battle flag. It's not that we're ""simply offended much more easily for some reason."" It's that the use of the flag by this murderer is more blatant, more pointed, and more obviously tied to his goal of driving black people out of American through a race war than ever before.  It's time to stop the use of the confederate battle flag in government displays on government buildings and grounds, because it's use by the state appears to enforce the use of the battle flag by the lunatics who murder nine people in a historic black church in order to start a race war.  It's not 'sensitivity' to recognize black people as fellow humans and not a chattel to be bought and sold and maimed at the owner's pleasure.   It would be like Germany being ambivalent about the Nazi flag until recently when a few Jews get killed by a Neo-Nazi, and then all of a sudden it has to be removed 60 years after the Holocaust.   Yeah, tough luck for 'a few Jews,' huh? Your callous disregard of the lives of 'a few Jews' gives me some understanding of your blindness to what the battle flag represents.  TL;DR: the confederate battle flag is so controversial now because the mass murderer of black people in a historic black church is tied to that murderers posting of several photos of him holding that flag and saying his goal is to resegregate America by starting a race war with his murders."

I'm not celebrating the Confederacy. I have never worn, owned or even identified with the Confederate flag or the Confederacy. Despite living in Texas, I don't really identify myself as a Southerner. So don't confuse my curiosity why something that was perfectly acceptable and inoffensive 10, 20 and 30 years ago is now completely unacceptable now.   Does Dylan Roof's heinous act change the meaning of the flag? Does it mean something now that it didn't last month? Why was it okay to be the paint job for the Duke Brother's car in the 1980's, but is now it's the most offensive symbol ever? Where was the outrage back then? Maybe my question shouldn't be why is it offensive now but why hasn't it always been offensive? Were Liberals not as concerned for minorities and what that flag represented for the past few decades until now?   Yeah, tough luck for 'a few Jews,' huh? Your callous disregard of the lives of 'a few Jews' gives me some understanding of your blindness to what the battle flag represents.   I can see the similarities between the Nazi Swastika and the Confederate flag. But the two have historically been treated differently. The Swastika was all but eradicated from Germany shortly after the war. But the Confederate flag has been proudly flown in one form or another since 1864. . .until now. Would it not strike you as bizarre if Germany had regions where the Swastika flew proudly and represented German heritage and culture. . .until the Munich Olympics in 1972? And then all of a sudden there was an outcry to remove and ban the Nazi Swastika in light of the murder of Jewish athletes? Is it not reasonable to ask, ""Hey, why was this symbol not offensive between 1946 and 1972? Why is it the epitome of offense now?"""

An argument could be made that more racial atrocities have occurred under the current US flag than under the Confederate flag. Would Root's murder have changed the meaning of the US flag if that were the symbol he chose to identify with?  I don't think you did answer why the Confederate flag was not offensive between 1864 and 2015. If it stands only for racism and treason today, it should have stood for that for the past 150 years."

But Hindus and Buddhists live somewhere far off, their cultures and symbols aren't seen as important.

On the other hand the KKK use of the burning cross was approved by many christians of the times.   Exactly! So logically, the cross should be an even more severe sign of bigotry than the Swastika, because you folks felt its effects on a more personal level. It becomes easy to vilify the Swastika because it is not held sacred by many western people, and is a symbol of distant lands. The same did not happen with the cross because Christians who lived right there held it sacred.    at least not seen and identified as more than just pretty decoration in some rugs or artworks.    This is exactly what I implied when I said the aren't seen as important. For the average western person, it is difficult to consider that many followers of eastern religions hold the Swastika as important and positive. Check this TIL thread and OP's views.   I'm sorry you're splitting the world into us and them, just as we Americans do on a daily basis. It's a shame to view 'others' as 'against us' when it probably is better seen as an opportunity to enlighten those 'others.'   Woah...that's a sharp interpretation of my comment, and quite unnecessary I must say. Are you reading more into my comment than what I have written? I do not split the world into 'us' versus 'them', I merely pointed out what is evident to me.

Personally, I do not much care about this issue; I think the states should not be flying confederate flags or have them incorporated into their state flags, but if a bunch of backwards rednecks want to wear them, that is their prerogative.  The whole issue has become, in my opinion, a smokescreen to keep people occupied, rather than addressing the real issue: how do openly racist teenagers/20+21 year olds have unrestrained access to guns?

Winning breeds complacency. The anger of losing motivates. Especially right wing types who build entire world views around fear. So, in spite of your analysis being more generally correct, the initial effects will be some backtracking.  This has no bearing on the longer term trend though. The reaction of the left to this backtracking will be the motivation to push forward again. Thus the longer term trend will continue.    I've watched the things occur for decades. I remember Carter and the Reagan revolution quiet well. The change in social norms in school between 1979 and 1980, with Reagan's election, was palpable.  The social conservative push over the last 35 years was a reactionary effect of the major civil rights gains over the previous couple of decades, i.e., conservative losses. The back-reaction has played out in everything from laissez faire economics to case law created qualified immunity for cops. Which, mixed with other case law, largely guts 42 U.S.C Section 1983.  This back-reaction was greatly amplified by the fact that the economy became supply constrained in the 1970s, in which capital returns as a ratio reached historical lows. Thus a push-back on demand side policies (labor) became an economic necessity. Just as the historical lows on labor returns, as a ratio, now require the opposite.  So just as a perfect storm lifted the right following 1980 the same perfect storm is set to lift the left following 2020. The backtracking associated with this SCOTUS ruling will be a short lived chorus of stupidity, but that's just what it's going to take for the longer term trend to re-energize."

Liberal,3b99oh,mywan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:16:41 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. Regardless of what the flag stands for, it is not a flag that unites the people, and thus it shouldn't be present on a building of the people. However, for some it is a symbol of pride, and though it is a very controversial symbol it cannot be banned. I was browsing /r/conservative today (for the lols) and though hilarious they did make one good point about how certain businesses have stopped selling anything with the confederate flag but still sell things with fucking swastikas. I mean, it is their prerogative, but really? The confederate flag is indisputably at least in part a symbol of oppression and hate, but it is nowhere near as bad as a fucking swastika. I'm all for not selling symbols of hate, as is your right, but don't discriminate in your discrimination against hateful groups and symbols. And if you are going to, please refuse to sell the greater of the two evils above the lesser."

To those downvoting me I guess you don't know what being liberal means so I'll just leave this definition here:   Liberals believe in government action to achieve equal opportunity and equality for all. It is the duty of the government to alleviate social ills and to protect civil liberties and individual and human rights. Believe the role of the government should be to guarantee that no one is in need.  Source  Also Reddit is made up of liberal community we got subs promoting hate, we had a sub promoting fatpeoplehate, we have sub hating men, we got sub hate Jews, and we got disgusting subs showing gores and dead people.

Liberals have long fought for many minorities, including the poor (income inequality issues), the falsely incarcerated (drug war issues, among others), and uneducated (urban planning/funding for schools). I can't think of any examples of molestation issues right off the bat that liberal politicians or grassroots organizations support.  This is a way over-simplification of very complex issues, but at least in the US, Conservatives are generally anti-LGBT whereas Liberals are generally pro-LGBT. There's also some pretty significant parts of the Republican movement in the US (the Log Cabin Republicans, for instance http://www.logcabin.org/) who are pro-LGBT and Democrat groups (http://bluedogdems.ngpvanhost.com/) who are anti-LGBT. No one is saying that LGBT people are perfect, and that isn't a Liberal stance.  Why do Conservatives care so much about the set of behaviors of other people, such as gays? Also, there are plenty of Liberal Christians (myself included.) The notion that we don't exist comes from (in part) Reddit, where the vocal majority are Liberal Athiests.  As there are way more Christians in this country than there are Jews, the Christian treatment of LGBT folks is a little more pressing. But not all Christians are crooks on this front. Homophobes are homophobes.  People who do that on Reddit do it because they think it's funny. People who generalize in real life do it because they aren't exposed to other cultures and traditions.    Again, these questions were framed not in a way to invite discussion of these issues. You wanted a fight, not a discussion."
Liberal,3bc4ax,zubatman4,11,Sat Jun 27 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"They are prominent in the news now because one of their struggles came to an historic end yesterday. Celebrating victory for one doesn't negate the struggles of others. There are all types of LGBT people - most who choose politics choose the side which accepts them as equals, and accepts their acts not as sins. Liberals care when Christians think their view should be law, despite the separation of Church & State on which the country was founded. 83% of America identifies as Christian. Just 4% identifies as another religion — Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, etc. Thus Jews oppressing LGBT is less likely to be endemic, but liberals would oppose any encroachment of religion onto law. You'd be taken more seriously if you refained from the generalizing you seem opposed to yourself.   Some liberals generalize about the South because it's easy to pick on the poor. ""White trash"" / ""trailer- trash"" are class-ist remarks and remarks denigrating the poor are unfortunately too accepted IMO.  Some liberals generalize about the South as backward because those in power in the South have historically been the last to accept and/or still don't many modern concepts that appear to be obvious, including:   America is founded with a wall between Church & State science should help determine energy policy science should help determine how we teach science, non-whites should be treated equally non-straights should be treated equally non-males should be treated equally"

However, after reading it three times, my reaction is still the same.  Heritage is a lame excuse.  I'm going to copy/paste from my own FB rant:  ""There is a chance that I am a bit emboldened by the activities of the day, and perhaps I'm allowing all of the rainbows to put me in the spirit of taking on the world.... but here I go. Prepare for the rant. I am an American. Specifically I am a privileged American who lives in the glory of its progress and basks in the sunlight of sacrifice. The brave people who died for the freedoms I enjoy did not die for a flag... they did not die for a national anthem... they did not die for the colors red white and blue. They died for me... for Americans. I wish this didn't have to be said, but I think it does; People who live in this country are also Americans, and the color of the skin or the conditions under-which their forefathers arrived here do not make them less American. As such, to hold on to a flag the flew in honor of that oppression is to deny them of the legitimacy of their equality.  I have heard the phrase we all know so well... 'Heritage, not hate'. However, this equally bares being called out, because a heritage that flies in the face of the standard we have chosen to defend as a nation is not a heritage that needs to be represented. We do not fly the British flag to honor the memories of the troops that we fought against to escape tyranny, because tyranny is what we, as a nation, have moved beyond. Slavery, and the war to defend it, is not a heritage to be proud of... it is something we should look back on and feel the shame of our failures as a nation, and proud of our ability to overcome.  In no other circumstance would we pay homage to a society who committed acts of oppression and victimized an entire group of people. If the cause that the Confederacy had staked it's claim on was pedophilia, would you place their flag on your front lawn? Would you dare to say that you are honoring the 'heritage' of people who molested children? Or, would you ride off the atrocities of the acts by saying things like 'Well, the child-rape wasn't that bad for most of the children... it was mostly just light fondling for the vast majority of them.' To say that this heritage is one to be honored is dismissing the atrocity the institutionalized slavery caused. Can someone explain to be how being a slave owner is less offensive than being a child molester?  And I challenge everyone out there to find just ONE black american who does not feel that- at BEST- the Rebel flag serves as a reminder of that oppression or a reminder of oppression that still exists. Or, at worst, a warning of danger that could fall onto them because of their skin color. Would you want your kid playing out front of the house with the guy with the child-rape-country-from-150-years-ago flag out front?  I am stating- very plainly and very simply, that if you pick a flag.. a piece of cloth or a picture placed on a license plate, over an ACTUAL American, you are a poor example of what it means to be an American. You are systematically reducing down what happened as a blip... an inconsequential nothing, when to many many people, it is not. And if you don't believe me, next time you see that dear rebel flag you love, just imagine if it stood for pedophilia instead of slavery, and then you might understand what it means to live under the weight of that kind of fear. And then tell me that it's just a flag."""

Liberal,3b7fem,redking125,2,Fri Jun 26 16:03:21 2015 UTC,"This seems like cherry picked statistics. The claim is that illegal immigrants are contributing more to Medicare than taking out. That may be true. But it's a drop in the bucket. Illegal immigrants provided a surplus of $35.1 billion to Medicare between 2001-2011. In that time, the Federal Government spent $3.94 trillion on Medicare. So we're talking about 0.89% of Medicare spending in that same time frame.   First of all, illegal immigrants are not eligible for Medicare, nonemergency Medicaid, or CHIP. They are eligible for emergency care under federal law and eligible for emergency Medicaid if low-income. So no shit that illegal immigrants who often steal social security identities and pay FICA taxes are paying more into specifically Medicare than they get out of it.  And then the article completely ignores non-Medicare medical expenses incurred by illegal immigrants. According to federal law, illegal immigrants are eligible for emergency care. In other words, hospitals cannot turn them away for being in country illegally and/or not being able to pay for service. The Center for Immigration Studies has estimated that providing emergency and clinic healthcare for immigrants costs the tax payer $4.3 billion annually, and that doesn't even count inpatient costs for hospitals.  So great, illegal immigrants are helping make up for 0.89% of a program they aren't supposed to be eligible for while the article's author ignores the vast majority of expenses illegal immigrants incur that the taxpayer has to pick up the bill for.

Liberal,3b2q7j,DragonflyRider,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:29:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you get what I mean when I say democratic socialism is different than socialism.  In America, many people think socialism automatically means a state-run economy.  That's not what democratic socialism is about at all.  Democratic socialist has a specific meaning:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism   Democratic socialism is a political ideology advocating a democratic political system alongside a socialist economic system, involving a combination of political democracy with social ownership of the means of production.   This sort of fits, since he does support giving workers more control over the means of production--think coops, employee-owned businesses, etc.  However, given the policies he's voted for and proposed, social democracy seems like a better fit.   social democracy is defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the latter half of the 20th century."

But it very much does. Still voting for him lol!  I think the difference has been muddled in America, but to me, after listening to him speak for a lot of years, he is a Democratic Socialist.  He is very much against anyone but the employees owning their companies. And I agree.  I have worked for Co-Ops before and it is a much better experience than working for a corporation. Working for Kinkos (I was an assistant manager in Santa Cruz and later LA) and going through the privatization process as they sold out to FeEx was awful."

One time I was eating at a Vietnamese buffet in town and wound up sitting next to and talking to this musician about how much I liked Big Star since I'd recently watched their (at the time) newly released documentary.  About 10-15 minutes into eating lunch with him, I realized I was talking to Big Star's drummer Jody Stephens.  I'm sure that must've sucked going from a co-op to a huge, anti-union, privately owned corporation.

Liberal,3b2q7j,joy_actual,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:38:53 2015 UTC,"No.  He says he's a ""democratic socialist.""   Socialism, as commonly understood by Americans, means widespread government ownership of business. A candidate or a party seemingly calling for that would alienate most of the public -- even in a lefty, earthy-crunchy state like Vermont.  But that’s not the agenda Sanders has actually been promoting. Sanders doesn’t shrink from the label socialist, Andrew Prokop pointed out in a profile for Vox last year, but he generally identifies himself as a democratic socialist. The distinction matters.  Democratic socialism, as generally conceived in the U.S., is a milder, more aspirational form of the ideology. Democratic socialists might not recoil at the thought of government running large industries, but they don’t actively pursue that goal. Instead, they focus on decidedly less radical objectives -- like making the welfare state more generous, giving workers more power, limiting the influence of money on politics and policing the practices of business more closely.   I would add that though he self-identifies as a ""democratic socialist""  his policy platforms are more reminiscent of social democracy (like in Scandinavian countries).  If you actually listen to the policies he advocates, you'll learn that all this means is that he favors a stronger social safety net--higher minimum wage, paid parental leave, etc., reforming taxes so that the super rich and corporations (many of which pay no taxes at all) pay their fair share, and giving workers more control over the means of production--encouraging employee owned businesses, co-ops, that sort of thing.  Not the same thing as ""Socialism"" at all.  Please read more than headlines when forming your political opinions.  Don't let the shills in the mainstream media fool you into recoiling in horror at the mention of the ""s-word.""  That's exactly what they want so a corporate-owned candidate like Clinton can waltz to the White House.  Prove to them that you're too smart to merely take them at their word when they employ these scare-tactics.    Whether or not you wind up agreeing with me or Sanders, I'd encourage you to do your own research; draw your own conclusions before you merely accept whatever the headlines say at face value."

First off I'm a social liberal meaning that I'm open to new ideas and view points and tolerant of them. I'm also in support of absolute free speech and the notion of all men are created equal. I differ from classical liberals in the way that I believe it's the governments responsibility to provide all citizens with their basic necessities and I believe in regulated economies albeit with a core capitalist market. Next off I'm a progressive because I want change. Simple as that. The middle class has lost it's voice due to the top 1% getting whatever they want(I blame you saint Reagan) and that needs to change. I believe in social and fiscal reforms so that the ""all men are created equal"" is actually something that exists.

Liberal,3b626n,20quid,2,Fri Jun 26 19:11:16 2015 UTC,"No that's absolutely not what I'm saying, civil disobedience has its place but only if it works to achieve its aims. Otherwise you usually end up annoying a whole bunch of people who should be agreeing with you (note the countless strikes on the London Underground and the sort of reception they now receive)  This heckler was in a room full of people who agreed with them, who were listening to a speech they wanted to listen to given by a president who agrees with you on this issue probably more than any other. In that regard civil disobedience served no purpose other than to undermine their argument.  Civil disobedience should not be used like a child uses tantrums, it should be planned and thought through such that it actually works towards achieving your aims. Nobody's saying civil disobedience isn't a right, but if people keep passing people off with it that public opinion will change. (again, see London Underground strikes)"

But are you blind enough to miss the fact that civil disobedience contains the word ""disobedience"" (as in ""misbehaving""... as in ""bad behavior"") in it?  Civil disobedience is a tool in which one person acts badly in order to be heard.    You can separate the perpetrator's message from the bad behavior if you want (in fact, you should), but don't be ignorant enough to then ascribe a message to the victim's reaction to the bad behavior at the same time.  Like I said:  It's just opportunism.

Does socialism mean the nationalization and common ownership of the means of production? Or does it simply mean a strongly progressive tax scheme geared towards supporting robust cradle to grave welfare programs for every citizen? Does anarchism mean the abolition of wage slavery and the hierarchical state in favor of a voluntary, horizontally administered direct democracy? Is it mutualist, collectivist, or syndicalist?

Liberal,3aysv6,Brettster,4,Wed Jun 24 16:48:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There should be a healthy debate for sure, but strategically it's insane to drag it out this long. Think of the Republican debates in '12. It was a bloodbath. They spent so much time and money attacking each other that very little time was actually spent supporting their platform. In the end they all came away from that process looking terrible and it was mostly self inflicted by their own party.   90% of the population already knows who they are voting for because they are voting for a party (mostly to keep the other party out of power not to necessarily keep the one they vote for in).   It's that last 10% that can be convinced and they will (as polls show) mostly make their minds up based on ""character"" ""personality"" and ""likeability"" of the candidate not so much on their platform. Spend two years trashing each other within your own party and no one comes out of that with more favorable character, personality, or likeability ratings. You are only dragging down your own nominee in front of that 10% who will decide.   What you want is to have 3-4 debates in the couple months heading into the party primaries. Those debates will energize party voters and still be brief enough to not leave the eventual nominee looking like hot garbage. The rest of the time before and after is spent by the candidates personally espousing their agenda and platform.   TLDR: Please don't start the debates now. Voter apathy will only increase as the negative party infighting is dragged out over two years."

How can liberals claim to defend children while supporting abortion?  Given how most liberals don't see the fetus as a child, and are quite vocal about this, I don't see the confusion here.   ""right-to-life advocates are mostly in favor of capital punishment.""  This is easily understood if you believe the pro-life movement is not speaking in good faith.  This is a pet issue of mine, it's fascinating, try to even mention to a pro-lifer that childbirth, even in the best of cases, risks the life of the mother and they'll go apoplectic.   They will fight tooth and nail to claim that childbirth is a safe, largely painless, and trauma free thing. This is of course absurd, but it's the enforcement of the absurdity which is the assertion of authority.  The life of the fetus is an excuse to them, what they really want is punishment of the mother, to assert authority over a 'lesser', in this case a pregnant woman.  Ergo the enforcement of absurdities (childbirth is safe, never discuss childbirth in any way involving two lives, with a weighing between them, etc).    Capital punishment is similarly an enforcement of authority over a lesser.    It's similarly why their opposition to abortion is so... anemic.  They 'say' abortion is like The Holocaust, but The Holocaust literally inspired treason amongst many Germans, Germany had to close its borders to stop people leaving, Germany declared a police state because what we would call a 'free society' could not stand in these conditions.  Men like Einstein left Germany, signed up with Germany's enemies, and helped bring it down....  And the pro-lifers?  Well, they wag their fingers at us, they yell.  It's the anger at an 'uppity subordinate' they wield.  We really 'should' be doing what they say, we're 'bad people' for not doing what they say. They still wave their flags on July 4th, in fact they wave them even harder than we do...  Imagine that sort of moral reasoning in Nazi Germany.  ""Nazi opponents seek legislation requiring a waiting period before you nerve gas a jew"", ""Another law is proposed, a doctor needs hospital admitting privileges before nerve gassing a jew""..  And after decades of failing to control The Holocaust, they wave their German Flags and talk about how Germany is the greatest country in the world.... would you take these people seriously?  It's why conservatism irks me, when you say what they do, it's obviously they don't think what they say they think..."

The desire to bring pain to others, and the wherewithal to do it, is nothing if not the manifestation of mental illness, or the result of some kind of psychotic imbalance.   In the same line of thought, could not racism, sexism, really any -ism, be attributed to mental illness, mental immaturity, or any similar affliction that might explain the lack of compassion and empathy present in those who hate and hurt?  I'd say white killings are associated with mental illness, because unlike gang violence, robbery, theft, or other stereotypical ""minority"" gun-involving activities, shooting up a school/theater/church lacks the ""reactionary/projection of force"" element of ""thug"" violence, and is instead fueled by hatred and a sole desire to kill.

It's an apples to oranges comparison.  Libertarian is not ""the extreme version of Republican"" (some Libertarian ideas, especially on social issues, actually fall to the left of Republican ideas).  Just like the Green Party is not the extreme version of the Democratic Party.  They are all different parties.  In the U.S. liberal and conservative are different ends of an ideological spectrum, thus my explanation that there are liberal, moderate, and even some conservative-leaning democrats.    Perhaps another analogy can help explain why your question doesn't make sense.  Essentially, you're failing to grasp how taxonomy works.  Gorillas are both mammals (they belong to the class mammalia) and hominids (they belong to the family hominidae).  You more or less keep asking me to explain how mammals are different than hominids, and I keep trying to tell you that the two are completely different categories.  If you can explain to me what you're not getting, perhaps I can clear this up for you, but continuing to throw tantrums is entirely unproductive."

Liberal,3asl7x,WiseCynic,-2,Tue Jun 23 12:38:31 2015 UTC,"I suspect the racial supremacy conflict started gaining steam towards the end as African descendants were buying slaves, farmland, and marrying outside their ""race"" could have been the proverbial straw that got the southern generals moving. Race and slavery were not fundamentally connected initially but there was a lot of overlap between the two issues."
Liberal,3asl7x,TheLastHonestMan,2,Tue Jun 23 13:37:22 2015 UTC,"I was taught Bacon's Rebellion had a lot to do with slavery as a racial component.  Basically the Irish and Blacks, as indentured servitude, were rising up together against the British. The British, to make quelling the rebellion easier, pitted the Irish and Blacks together, using race as a divider.   An important quote of a different article on the Rebellion:   How did Bacon's Rebellion mark a turning point in American ideas of race, giving birth to, as Edmund Morgan says, both black slavery and American freedom? Bacon's Rebellion is an event which begins to redefine notions of race on the North American continent, or at least in the Chesapeake region. Before Bacon's Rebellion we certainly have distinctions made between blacks and whites, and we certainly have attitudes on the part of whites and presumably on the part of blacks where they differentiate themselves and where they probably think each is superior to the other. Nonetheless, we see them behaving pretty much the same way. Some numbers of people of African descent have moved into the land owning class, are sometimes owning the servants, are connected with churches, are cognizant of the legal system and so on. And of course substantial numbers of people of European descent are caught in a system of coerced labor called indentured servitude. And indentured servants, whether they are black or white, are pretty much treated the same way as slaves. Very badly. Bacon's Rebellion changes that, and what seems to be crucial in changing that is the consolidation after Bacon's Rebellion of a planter class. The planters had not been able to control this rowdy labor force of servants and slaves. But soon after Bacon's Rebellion they increasingly distinguish between people of African descent and people of European descent. They enact laws which say that people of African descent are hereditary slaves. And they increasingly give some power to white independent white farmers and land holders. That increased power is not equality. Dirt farmers are not elected to the House of Burgess in Virginia; the planters monopolize those offices. But they do participate in the political system. In other words we see slavery and freedom being invented at the same moment. Now what is interesting about this is that we normally say that slavery and freedom are opposite things -that they are diametrically opposed. But what we see here in Virginia in the late 17th century, around Bacon's Rebellion, is that freedom and slavery are created at the same moment."
Liberal,3asl7x,HowAboutThisThough,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:48:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that's just too much to read right now but I will.   Royalist hegemony was once a big deal and the British were but one of the key players. Racial leveraging was one card in their sleeve. Their position in the slave trade was another. Would you like to include religion as a factor? There are plenty of other factors if you would like to further complicate the matter but it's usually best to be concise, right?  Ultimately my point is that the instruments of a spectacularly massive social order scheme (we're talking about something a lot bigger than simple racism) with a long history was not undone by one simple revolution. Clearly we're still picking away at it today. The shadow of authority by divine right blankets all of recorded history leading up to maybe the 17th century by my estimation.  I think the fact that we've done as well as we have is pretty amazing."

Liberal,3asl7x,tones2013,-3,Tue Jun 23 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"So, why did the South succeed? Just for slavery? But then the North attacked them to preserve the union, and not end slavery?   I am still under the impression that buying out all the slaves freedom would have been much better than succession.   This article tries to refute that, but it leaves some holes.   Although it claims:   ""Claudia Goldin estimates that the cost of having the government buy all the slaves in the United States in 1860, would be about $2.7 billion (1973: 85, Table 1). Obviously, such a large sum could not be paid all at once. Yet even if the payments were spread over 25 years, the annual costs of such a scheme would involve a tripling of federal government outlays (Ransom and Sutch 1990: 39-42)! The costs could be reduced substantially if instead of freeing all the slaves at once, children were left in bondage until the age of 18 or 21 (Goldin 1973:85)""   But, they had an even more expensive war in its place, clearly it could have been afforded. Infact, since slaves were then freed after the civil war, all slave owners lost even more wealth from that.  The article sights how the South was so attached to slavery - but it was also seen as a necessary evil. Don't get me wrong, plenty of southern slave owners, if not all, were brutal, awful, despicable people.   Second, I believe the civil war increased racism in South, at least at first. Now, whites had to actually compete with blacks for things like jobs, and start to pay them, when their cities and environment had been destroyed. Clearly they would not just switch ""okay, fine"" Things would get worse. Having bought out all the slaves would not have nearly as much resentment towards blacks, and allow a better healing process.  Again though, don't get me wrong about any of this - the act of slavery was inhumane, and needed to be stopped. Overall though, the civil war did happen, and we see the results of it all today. So, I guess...what's the point of even my comment :P"

Fox and other Republicans literally accused Obama of being a Muslim terrorist sympathizer because he supported the overthrow of Mubarak a while ago and gave a thumbs up to the Muslim Brotherhood, who have some questionable members and ties to extremist groups. They aren't, and he definitely didn't support Islamic extremism, but its the same logic. Its a silly way to try and trash somebody you disagree with."

His lack of action was not an endorsement of the Muslim Brotherhood, it was an endorsement of Egyptian democracy.   And I'm not sure how this is an analogy for the article I posted. When a hate group donates money to a candidate, it is fair to assume they did so for a reason, namely that they thought this person would serve their interests.

This reflects one of the points made by criminal justice experts to me last week: the US incarceration rate is significantly higher than other developed countries' in large part because America has so much more deadly violence.    Really it's because you have a retarded racist drug war where well over half the arrests are for possession. You had whites during prohibition driving the homicide rate up to 10 per 100,000 in cities. You've created an unregulated, dangerous black market where the only means of recourse is violence.

If you get caught breaking the law and are in posession of a handgun the penalty should be double the length of the maximum penalty for whatever crime you commit.  And like our three strikes laws, there should be no ability to lower it.  It should be a rock solid doubling of your incarceration if your crime includes a handgun.  Then we should get rid of the three strikes law, which has been proved to basically put non violent offenders away and do little to keep the violent ones away from society where they need to be.

I contend that the display of the confederate flag is an incitement to imminent lawless action.  There is no question in my mind that at a bare minimum it should be removed from all public government buildings. It is the symbol of the acts of sedition and rebellion by the traitorous South. That is what Ta-Nehisi Coates is advocating. I think that is the minimum. ALL public display should be banned.   I do not think we should ban Nazi insignia however because we do not have the same historical relationship to that symbol as we do to the confederate flag. But I think it is perfectly reasonable that France and Germany do ban Nazi symbols for the obvious reason those who used those symbols caused great suffering to their people.

We recognize that we lack the proper training - not in the use of guns or gun safety, but in the appropriate rules of engagement in deadly confrontations, and upkeep of preparedness for making the right choice in a split second. As recent events show, even some police officers seem to lack the proper ethical training for this.  We have no interest at all in guns either as tools, objects of desire, or self-defense weapons. We would not feel safer if we carried guns. We would feel safer if nobody did - or short of that, if those who did had been properly screened and trained.  Arming the rest of the population is not a solution because we are not interested. Remember that we already have the choice. There is nothing preventing me from purchasing a gun, getting a concealed carry license, and carrying it. I just won't. I would prefer to be shot and killed than to have it in my conscience that I made a mistake and killed an innocent person.  Finally, please correct me if I am wrong. I may not be looking in the right place, but I seem to see mass shootings with many innocent dead on a regular basis, and I don't remember seeing news anywhere on the same scale of instances when an armed citizen prevented a mass shooting."

Liberal,3a9vch,Holinyx,26,Thu Jun 18 22:58:39 2015 UTC,"No, those facts state that self defense users don't kill as many people as criminals do. It is reasonable to assume that a legal gun owner, interested in self defense, would hesitate to kill when brandishing is enough to stop a threat. Appart from caring about life, there is a court case to avoid and the life long thoughts about whether pulling the trigger was the best option."
Liberal,3a9vch,fewdo,19,Thu Jun 18 11:41:37 2015 UTC,Except it also doesn't count all the crimes where someone uses a gun but doesn't kill someone. The article is comparing apples to apples.   Also if you pull a gun and point it at something your life is supposed to be in danger. Why are all these gun owners pulling a gun and living without shooting?   You are just asking for completely different numbers. That problem is Congress has blocked almost all federal research into gun use. However we do know how many gun related homicides there are because you have to record cause of death. So this article used the only verifiable numbers they could use and it's a pretty staggering difference.
Liberal,3a9vch,wh3873,14,Thu Jun 18 13:03:22 2015 UTC,"Also if you pull a gun and point it at something your life is supposed to be in danger.   Mostly correct. Self Defense laws typically specify that a reasonable person must feel there was an credible, criminal, imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm to justify the use of lethal force in self defense.    ""Imminent"" depends partially on the capability of the victim to repel the attack. A victim with his gun in his hand needs less time to utilize lethal force than a victim with a gun in an OWB holster (""outside waistband"" - a holster comparable to a police duty holster). A victim carrying OWB needs less time than a victim carrying IWB (""inside waistband"" - a concealed carry holster designed to be worn inside the pants), or a victim carrying on his ankle.  We're talking about a couple seconds difference here, but an awful lot can happen in two seconds.    Why are all these gun owners pulling a gun and living without shooting?   They aren't shooting because more than 99% of the time, the act of drawing a weapon is sufficient to convince the attacker to stop his attack.    That problem is Congress has blocked almost all federal research into gun use.    No. Congress reined in the CDC, a public health organization, when it decided it wanted to promote a particular criminal justice policy. Congress did not stop the Justice Department from conducting this same research, nor did they stop the CDC from conducting research into the mechanism and treatment of gun injuries, nor the health risks of exposure to the chemicals in bullets, primers, propellants, solvents, lubricants, etc.   NASA doesn't study school lunches, the EPA doesn't study radio spectrum allocation. If they tried, they'd be formally rebuked for their efforts. The CDC was rebuked for going outside its public health mission and tackling a criminal justice issue.    The article is comparing apples to apples.   In a criminal homicide case, the attacker is fully in control over the circumstances leading up to the use of lethal force.  If this were apples-to-apples, in a justifiable homicide case, the defender would have to be fully in control over the circumstances leading up to the use of lethal force. But he's not. The defender cannot act independently, he can only react to the actions of the attacker. In both criminal and defensive scenarios, the attacker is fully in control over who gets shot, and he tends not to act in a manner that will end in his own perforation.   In both cases, the attacker is fully in control over all lethal force used during an attack. The defender cannot compel the attacker to create a situation justifying lethal force.   There's also another confounding variable you haven't considered: the overwhelming majority of gunshot wounds are survivable with medical intervention. If the injured party can survive until the paramedics arrive, there's a very high probability of long-term survival. Defenders immediately call police and paramedics after a shooting; attackers do not.  No, this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison."

I could very easily argue that the act of pulling a weapon or brandishing  one increase the danger of deadly gun fire confrontation by 20 times over not having a weapon and let the criminal rob you so they get out of your location faster. Which of us is right? No one knows because there is inadequate research. I could also argue that when both sides brandish weapons, the likelihood of hurting bystanders increase 50 times. We can keep on going."
Liberal,3a9vch,gelinrefira,5,Thu Jun 18 18:05:21 2015 UTC,"Yea you are just pulling that out of your ass.   Nah, that number came from Lott's research.   I could very easily argue that the act of pulling a weapon or brandishing one increase the danger of deadly gun fire confrontation by 20 times over not having a weapon and let the criminal rob you so they get out of your location faster   Not very easily, no. The CDC published a study a couple years ago indicating that armed victims suffered fewer and less severe injuries than unarmed victims, which would directly contradict your ""20 times"" claim.    No one knows because there is inadequate research.    Sure, if ""adequate"" and ""inadequate"" are arbitrarily defined to suit your needs.   Here's the bottom line: The claim that is the title of this thread and this article is NOT supported by the data in this study. This study looks only at justifiable homicides, not all forms of self defense. For example, a person accused of brandishing a weapon can argue that such brandishing was justified under self defense laws. If a prosecutor and/or a judge and/or a jury agrees, this is an instance where a gun was used in self defense that did not result in a homicide.   A person firing a gun at an attacker and missing, or non-fatally injuring him can be found to have fired the gun in self defense without ever having caused a justifiable homicide.   The claim the guns are rarely used in self defense is NOT supported by this data. The claim that guns are rarely used to commit a justifiable homicide is supported by this data, but that's not the claim being made."

I specifically mentioned several areas in which the CDC does have authority as a public health organization to study other aspects of guns and their use:   Congress did not stop the Justice Department from conducting this same research, nor did they stop the CDC from conducting research into the mechanism and treatment of gun injuries, nor the health risks of exposure to the chemicals in bullets, primers, propellants, solvents, lubricants, etc.    I have no problem with the CDC in general. I have a problem with the broad recommendations they made that were based on an extremely narrow study they made into an area well outside their field of expertise."
Liberal,3a9vch,rivalarrival,5,Thu Jun 18 20:38:21 2015 UTC,CDC is tasked with studying anything that harms or kills Americans. That it is a gun or a cop doing the damage does not take it outside their charter.

The best possible conclusion from Lott's studies is that public ownership rate of guns does not really appear to affect crime rate or gun crimes in any meaningful way and at worst could have make things even worse. Guns do not really affect crime rate nor does it really decrease injury to victims or really deter criminals, so stop trying to shoehorn it in. You like guns, fine, go shoot off a few rounds.

The only part of Lott's research I relied upon were his conclusions on the rates of defensive gun use.     I don't have the delusion that in a confrontation that just because I have a gun will really increase my chance of coming out unscathed.   The CDC disagrees with you. According to their research, armed individuals who fight back against their attackers suffer both fewer and less severe injuries than unarmed individuals.     You have an obvious bias to want guns to appear to be a public asset beyond Constitutional rights, as though they are actually beneficial to society at large.   Please support this. My position is merely that the article's claim that defensive gun use is rare is based entirely on their idea that anything defensive gun use other than ""justifiable homicide"" is not ""self defense"".   I raised a number of issues in my comment.   Would you care to discuss the author's conflation of ""justifiable homicide"" with ""self defense""?  Would you care to discuss my claim that justifiable homicides to criminal homicides is not an apples-to-apples comparison?   Would you care to discuss the disparity of control in an attacker's use of force vs a defender's use of force?   Would you care to cite any numbers contradicting Lott's numbers on the rate of defensive gun use, or are you satisfied with your ad hominem rebuttal of his claims?"
Liberal,3a9vch,rivalarrival,2,Thu Jun 18 22:04:21 2015 UTC,"You did make claims that 99% of simply brandishing weapon can deter would be criminals which is suppose to reduce the crime from happening in the first place, based precisely on Lott's research. Lott's research and models ha been debunked many times, a cursory googling will find many evidence and criticism on his work. Lott is a person worthy of ad hominem attacks because his indefensible lies trying to salvage whatever is left f his credibility has make everything about his work personal. To examine his work will almost inevitably leads to examining his conduct, which is deplorable.  Despite this, CDC research is interesting because one of its conclusions is that defensive use of gun can result in victim having more favorable outcomes, I won't dispute that particular part, though I think the research is premature and there is simply needed research in this area and better data collecting. I reserved my judgement on that.  I did not attack you on other points regarding justifiable homicide or self defense. I only attack you on using some number that seem completely bogus and then you went on to cite Lott, which simply confirmed that you are already using a lousy source.  If you want to argue hypothetical, then sure attackers can choose to attack and defenders have to response. But beyond that, whether a confrontation, or running away or any other kinds of response is beyond the purview of this discussion. If you want to justify that guns do allow you better chance of coming out alive, then you cite sources from Lott who is a disgraced researcher, and CDC which is a government ran agency both seem to suggest so. That is not a confirmation and in fact, just shows two widely different quality (one really bad, and one good) of studies have reach similar conclusions, which simply means, we don't have a fucking idea. Which is why, again, I reserved judgement even on the CDC report.   Beyond that, the problem with your argument about attacker having control over the situation is again hypothetical. How about cases that brandishing actually lead to a gun fight? How about cases where robbers rob people with no guns simply take the money and go. How about cases where gun fire from both sides injury and/or kill both sides. How about cases where the defender shot bystanders instead? There are many scenarios which can happen during a potential confrontation between a defender and attacker. Did the CDC report account for all of these possible scenarios? Suffice to say, this is a difficult area of research considering that data is sparse and more often than not, misreported, underreport or even over represented because there is no real national standards on reporting these cases. FBI get their data from police departments which is arguably not very reliable on reporting cases. The fact that you have to even argue about semantics shows a lack of standards in reporting cases. Again, I reserved my judgement even on the CDC report until there are more money being channeled to researching this area.  Instead of arguing on useless hypothetical on attacker vs defender, justifiable homicides vs self defense. There are plenty of other examples that show that crime rate is mostly affected by poverty level, education, social mobility, community stability which in turn leads to other factors like organized crime, gangs, drugs usage. There are countries and places where there is low crime rate, with no guns, and high crime rate with high ownership of guns, low crime rate with high ownership of guns, and high crime rate with little to no gun ownership. It is simply delusional to think that just because the a community owns a lot of guns, will automatically bring down crime rate, which is what this Lott thing or CDC report is often used politically to justify pushing for more guns to solve inherently social problems. It does not solve the core problems and just make people more paranoid about their neighbors and if the indication is true for supposedly highly trained police officers using excessive force all the time, I fear for my life from a stupid neighbor than a would be criminal."

I relied solely on his findings for number of defensive gun uses.  Nearly every other study I've looked at focuses solely on guns that have been fired in self defense. I've never fired a gun in self defense, but I have brandished a gun shortly after being threatened with physical violence, and those threats were immediately withdrawn. The only researcher I'm aware of who has attempted to quantify this sort of gun use has been John Lott, which is why I relied on his number.   Seeing as how you have a problem with Lott's methodology, surely you see the far more serious problem with the topical study:  It's conclusion that self defense is rare is based on the idea that ""justifiable homicide"" and ""self defense"" are synonymous. It simply ignores any form of self defense that does not conclude with a fatality."

Lott has failed to produce the data from the study, claiming to have lost it in a computer crash. From Lindgren's letter:   His conclusions aren't why he's a cook, its that he manipulated and fabricated data to produce a conclusion he already had.

If you are only going to count justifiable homicides as self defense then neither of those would count but they were both a defensive application of a gun.  The only statement you can make from the data here is that most times where a gun was used to kill someone  were illegal and presumably not in self defense.  That's a distinctly different statement than saying guns are more often used to commit murder than to protect yourself and it is CERTAINLY a different statement than saying guns are rarely used to protect yourself."

We understand that attackers keep shooting until their target is dead, while defenders shoot until their target is stopped. We understand that attackers don't seek medical attention for their perforated targets, but defenders immediately call emergency services and get police and paramedics rolling quickly. We understand that attackers tend to stop their attack and run away at the first sign of serious resistance from a defender, but that victims of attackers don't usually have the same option.

That's not true at all. Four criteria must be met. There must be a 1. Credible; 2. Criminal; 3. Imminent, 4. Threat of death or grievous bodily harm to justify lethal force in self defense.   Once an attacker stops his attack, the threat is no longer imminent. Lethal force at this point is not justified. I don't agree with /u/Fewdo's ""least amount of force necessary"" position, but I do agree with his conclusion: if the bad guy backs off, the shot is no longer justifiable.    I was just saying you are asking for unverifiable numbers and ignoring the hard numbers here.   A ""Self Defense"" claim is a legal defense against an accusation that the actor used criminal force against another person. The defendant could be accused of assault, aggravated assault, battery, attempted murder, or just about any violent crime.   The ""hard numbers"" don't support the claim that guns are rarely used for self-defense.  They support the claim that guns are rarely used to commit a justifiable homicide, but that's it."

Also if you've pulled a gun on someone to defend your life how did the guy have time to back down? I mean your life was in danger or are people illegally threatening other people with guns and calling it self defense? My guess is that is the case. There are a lot of stories I've heard in person and second had of gun owners using their guns as a threat in situations that don't call for it. It's illegal but accepted behavior by a lot of gun people I know
Liberal,3a9vch,wh3873,0,Thu Jun 18 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"I've definately heard of bad branishing too.  Because few people do quick draws, you'd have to start drawing several seconds before the potential attacker was actually dangerous."
Liberal,3a9vch,fewdo,4,Thu Jun 18 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"This is somewhat true.   There are 4 criteria necessary for the use of lethal force to be justified in self defense. There must be a credible, criminal, imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm. ""Imminent"" is not calculated in terms of seconds, but on the reasonable person standard that incorporates the capability of the victim to repel that force.   If a reasonable person would believe a threat meets the other 3 criteria, and it takes 2 minutes to get your gun out of your safe, ""imminent"" means at least 2 minutes away. But, the ""imminence"" issue is constantly under consideration: Once you have your gun out of that safe and in your hand, ""imminent"" might mean a fraction of a second. With an attacker trying to break down your front door, you'd be justified in getting your gun out of your safe, carrying it in your hand, and pointing it at the attacker through the door, but you probably wouldn't be justified in firing it through the door."

Liberal,3a9vch,JohnnyBeagle,2,Thu Jun 18 16:04:27 2015 UTC,False equivalency. Guns are designed to kill people. Pools are not. Pools require a permit and there are strict laws regarding how big your pool can be and what kind of protections need to be put in place to keep children out when unattended. In most states guns have no such restrictions. I like the heart disease and cancer analogy since we pour billions into finding ways to eradicate these things much like we should be doing with citizen gun ownership.
Liberal,3a9vch,fewdo,10,Thu Jun 18 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"It is reasonable to assume that a legal gun owner, interested in self defense, would hesitate to kill when brandishing is enough to stop a threat.    Oh this is my favorite argument! If you approach something with a number that is nearly impossible to calculate (harder so when the NRA won't even let you try) you are free to make up any number and come to any conclusion you want. It is usually called the John Lott effect. It is also called specious reasoning.  And why does the NRA force politicians to block research into gun violence? I would suppose it to be the same reason natural gas drillers try and block research into fracking. Because they know the results will be damaging to their horrible product."

Personally I think gun ownership for self defense is stupid but I also think it's not the worst thing on earth.

At the time of the American Revolution, rifles were too slow to reload for conventional warfare. Muskets ruled the conventional battlefields. The guns most Americans owned at the time were rifles, as they were better for hunting. In order to get around this problem, France gave the revolutionaries 30,000 muskets. Gunpowder supplies were also an issue, so France supplied roughly 90% of the gunpowder used in the Revolutionary War. France also provided money, logistical support, naval interference, the uniforms for the revolutionary army, and even some of its soldiers. There was some guerrilla warfare using rifles to harass the British troops, but the war was primarily won via the day's conventional tactics. Simply calling the revolution a rebellion within the British empire is akin to calling the Vietnam War just a civil war.   The colonies also had their own governments with their own organized and government trained militias. The power structures of the states were already in place. These states crushed rebellions of their own soon after the revolutionary war, such as Shays' Rebellion."

In fact, public armories were very common. I don't really have a problem with community armories where guns are used at the consent of the community. We certainly have the technology to collectivize weapon ownership with directly democratic local armory federations.

The variation in these numbers remains a controversy in the field. The estimate of 3 million defensive uses per year is based on an extrapolation from a small number of responses taken from more than 19 national surveys. The former estimate of 108,000 is difficult to interpret because respondents were not asked specifically about defensive gun use.

If I am poor, every penny of my income goes to pay for basic survival, whereas if I'm middle class or rich I have a certain degree of disposable income. If the flat tax rate is 10% then the poor guy making $10K pays $1,000 in taxes. The rich guy making $100K pays $10 grand in taxes. That $1,000 means the difference between eating and not eating for the poor guy, while the $10 grand for the rich guy might effect the type of car he gets to drive.

So unless you can find some hidden myriad of actual people proposing flat taxes that do not have exemptions or deductions for the first portion of income, then your charge that I am ""outright lying to everyone"" is baseless and the actual lie.

I'm going to assume you're linking to Ted Cruz. There is also Huckabee in your URL, so I'll deal with him below. Ted Cruz hasn't released many details for his Flat Tax plan, only that there would be deductions for mortgages and charitable contributions. So for now, yes his tax plan does not have an income exemption, but that doesn't mean his plan won't have a standard decuction. In his statement, he has said, ""We will roll it out with precise details in the coming weeks or months. There are trade-offs to be had and we're right now internally having those debates, in terms of whether you have a couple of deductions or exemptions or not, at what rate the flat rate is set, what level of standard deductions and so those trade-offs we're currently debating."" So his plan will most likely include a standard deduction like virtually all other Flat Tax proposals.  Mike Huckabee - Proposes a FairTax or Federal Sales Tax. This is not a flat income tax, so his proposal is irrelevant to this conversation.  Rick Perry - ""taxpayers could claim a standard exemption of $12,500 for each individual and dependent.""  So of the four examples (in contrast to my nine examples), you could only find one real person who is proposing a ""true"" flat tax that does not have a standard deduction or exemption for a portion of income. Last time I checked, 11 out of 12 qualifies as ""the majority of people proposing a Flat Tax.""

Ted Cruz is a piece of shit and any plan that he comes up with would fuck the working poor and would be bad for America.   You're still ignoring the fact that all of these proposals, including the ones you provided would amount to huge tax breaks for the wealthy resulting in budget deficits and underfunding for countless federal programs.

Sure a Federal Sales Tax has its own problems, but it is irrelevant to this conversation when talking about Flat Taxes. So you cannot honestly call Huckabee's FairTax a ""Flat Tax."" It should be noted that even the FairTax has a prebate that offsets the burden of the tax with a monthly check from the government to make sure people living at or below poverty pay a net $0 or less in taxes  And Perry's and Cruz's plans may be shit in your view, but they still offer standard deductions, which was my initial claim, for which you called me a liar. I'm still waiting for a retraction of that claim BTW in light of all the evidence that I've provided that I'm right. The majority of Flat Tax proposals in real life include a deduction for the first $XX,000 of income. You said I'm lying. I provided multiple sources that support this. You've provided one that doesn't. Again 11 of 12 is ""the majority of proposals.""   And I'm not ignoring the problems with the Flat Taxes proposed. My one and only point is that it's intellectually dishonest and a straw man fallacy to criticize a Flat Tax that taxes every single dollar of income earned while ignoring the majority of Flat Tax plans that have exemptions.

Liberal,3acmsh,Karunamon,-1,Fri Jun 19 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"So, let's say we bump the minimum wage up to $15/hr. If the poor are paying, let's say 20% right now in taxes (I'm a bit ignorant on actual tax rates so please forgive me). Once they see this increase in money, negating any possible raise in cost of living, they would still have more net money than before the increase. If we raised the amount of the rich's tax to 20%, as I assume it is currently a lesser percentage, would it not remain relatively better for the poor and still increase the taxes the rich pay?   Sorry for the confusing question, but tl;dr: it would be relatively the same for the poor or better if minimum wage increases, but ""harder"" on the rich."
Liberal,3acmsh,TWISTYLIKEDAT,5,Fri Jun 19 02:00:19 2015 UTC,"Let's do some math - let's assume that our $15/hr minimum wage worker gets paid for 40 hrs & 52 weeks.

If they paid an actual 20% rate on every penny of that income, they'd be left with $24,960($2,080 per month) with which they would pay their State Income tax, Social Security withholding, sales taxes, rent ('cuz you can't buy on that income, anywhere in this country), groceries, car payment, fuel, utilities, etc..  On the other hand, let's say you make a (mere) five times more than this $15/hr worker - that is, $156,000 per year.   Again, assume a 20% tax rate. You are left with $124,000 with which to meet your other obligations & needs - $10,400 per month.  Do you think you'd be feeling much pain with that kind of monthly income? Even with a very comfortable lifestyle, I wouldn't.   Edit: To be truly fair, a rich person ought to feel a roughly comparable amount of ""pain"" from paying their taxes as a poor person. But rich people have to decide that they'd better buy a BMW 3 series instead of a 5 or a 7, where a poor person has to decide whether to buy a 10 year old Toyota Corolla, or take the bus."

Yes, if there was a flat tax on ""every single penny"" of someone's income, a flat tax would hurt the lowest income earners the most. But if you only tax after the first, let's say, $20,000 on someone's income, anyone making equal or less than $20,000 a year pays nothing in taxes. That hypothetical person making $31,200 only pays an effective tax rate of 7.2%, while the person making $156,000 pays an effective tax rate of 17.4%.  I'm not saying that the flat tax is the best system and we should adopt it. I'm just pointing out a bit of a straw man in your argument.

What you are describing above is similar to the current American tax scheme, where a certain base amount is not taxed at all & then income is tax at some rate (or rates, once their income rises enough to be taxed at something higher than the lowest rate). Any person's effective rate is lower than their nominal rate, rich or poor.   But the poor feel the 'pain' of the loss of that income far more than the richer person. In your example, our $15/hr worker, making $31,200 gross, is left with 29,760 (or 2,480/mo) to make ends meet. Better than before, but still tight.   Our $156,000 earner is left with $128,000 after his Federal tax is paid, or $10,700/mo, very comfortable indeed, imho."

Although the high income guy is paying a higher absolute amount & a higher percentage, he feels much less 'pain' from loss of income than the poorer person.  This is just a gimmick - it's not a 'flat' tax, it's current US tax system reduced to two brackets: $20,000 & below, tax rate = 0%, $20,001 and up, tax rate =20%.

I think the problem is people look at every issue as isolated.  The problem isn't with a flat tax.  The problem is with a system which concentrates business ownership and hence economic control in as few hands as possible.  Done alone, a flat tax would make that problem worse.  Of course it doesn't have to be that way.  If a big part of the taxes are going into economic commons that everyone can use to start a business, then a flat tax would be helpful.  But that would require deep rethinking of how we address poverty in the US, and a recognition that the Left has failed dramatically on this issue and I don't see that happening on this subreddit.  The real solutions are to tax and legislate against scale of economic production, to tax heavily but provide strong economic commons, to ensure that if you have very little you still can easily go into business for yourself without losing any social anti-poverty benefits.  That means less means testing, more commons, more local approach to government.  Avoiding the problems of segregation in the past would probably also mean real reparations for slavery."

In this case, you only pay the flat tax on the $10,000 you made above $20K. Your effective tax rate on a 15% flat tax is 5%. If you make $50K a year, you only pay taxes on the $30,000 you made on top of the $20K. Your effective tax rate is 9%.   So a flat tax with a ""poverty level"" exemption is progressive.

Let's say it's calculated that someone living at poverty level pays an average of $1200 a year on the consumption tax. The government offsets that expenditure by giving every taxpayer a monthly prebate of $100. So someone at poverty level who pays around the average tax on expenditures gets $100 and pays $100 each month. Their effective tax rate is 0%. The actual prebate is higher than my example. I used $1200 because it's divisible by 12. The actual proposed prebate is closer to $2,700 a year or $226 for a single individual, with higher prebates for married couples and children.  The more money you spend on new items (used items are not taxed) and services above that poverty level of spending, the more you pay in consumption tax, starting at 0%.

Liberal,3a1xmd,barelyonhere,5,Wed Jun 17 00:04:26 2015 UTC,"One problem with explaining socialism to the layman is that it typically means at least one of three separate ideas:   The transitional state between capitalism and communism (most people rarely use it this way except when discussing Marxism or as a way to equate all socialists with communists as a means to undermine their position). Putting the means of production in the hands of the laborers (what most self-described socialists are talking about including myself). A policy of heavy regulations & taxes in a welfare state often seen as a bridge to the second definition (how most people including Bernie are using the term).

I don't think ""taxing the rich more"" is the right slogan.  In theory that's a good thing.  But the real problem is the way we privilege unearned income in taxes over earned income.  Just get rid of capital gains tax and find some way to equitably fold it into taxable income (maybe you can amortize gains as income over the number of years you owned the asset?).  Breaking up banks is good.  Undo citizens united?  The devil is in the details there.  Imagine a world where the government effectively made sure that no unincoirporated businesses could survive, but no incorporated businesses could act as proxies for the rights of their owners.....  That would be worse than Citizens United....   That says he seems to want to fight for the working class like FDR and undo some of the corporate control.   But FDR increased corporate control, just tried to balance with unions.  Read up in the NIRA and why the Supreme Court struck it down.

That's what I am getting at.  Corporate personhood was historically a way of preserving a subset of owners' rights, saying that we'd treat the owners not has having their own rights, but the corporation as a proxy for a subset of them.  The government can't just come and seize the steel mill because it is convenient because that deprives the owner of property.  But the steel mill doesn't get religious liberties either even though the owners might.  If you move away from corporate personhood now suddenly, the owners are the only ones with rights, and so there is no middle ground.  Either the owners win every time (example, Hobby Lobby) where they assert their rights or they win none of the time (Youngstown Steel and Tube, and Dartmouth College would both have been seized by the state with no recourse at all).  That's why I say the devil is in the details.  It isn't that I like Citizens United, but that I am concerned that in the rush to do something, anything, that we will simply take a loaded howitzer and fire it squarely at our own feet.  I think a better approach is:    Raise the corporate income tax rate to the individual tax rate and exempt dividends from taxes.  Exempt from capital gains tax shares owned by non-officer workers in a firm as well as one's primary residence, but fold capital gains into income (some amortization rules might need to be penned, perhaps allow gains to be amortized going forward over the period of time one held the asset?).  Require employers' bonus plans to be uniform or failing that require mandatory, statutory bonuses as a portion of salary.  Deregulate self-employment, and fold over the employer's share of social security and medicare to the employee (but mandate during hte switchover that the employee has a right to the same take-home pay).  Regulate against scale.  Deregulate small farms and businesses, and more aggressively regulate factory farms and huge food processing plants,  Same with banks etc.   Don't make the mistake of thinking I am pro-corporate.  But I think the government likes corporations because they are easier to use as proxies for regulation and so unless rules for unincorporated businesses are loosened, I become concerned that restricting corporations will simply be a power grab with nothing given back."

Better to send troops over now while they are relatively small then when the are huge and have a much bigger influence.   You really don't get it, do you? ISIS didn't grow because we didn't attack them enough. They grew because US military presence kept fucking with their heads and making them angrier and more extreme.   Everything the left does makes me fear for the day when they are in total control of this country.   That's the keyword - because you are told to fear the left (for all the idiotic lies that you mentioned), not because that's a rational fear.   A lot more people in this country are right to fear the extreme right wing, which took over the Republican party and made it completely dysfunctional.

That's all he's focusing on. Money in politics, corruption, healthcare as a right, education as a right. He's direct and honest and doesn't sound like he's bullshitting you and that IS resonating with people - especially because Clinton's message is the exact opposite. No democrat I've heard has a bad word to say against Bernie except ""he can't win,"" and nobody has anything good to say about Clinton except she's ""better than any Republican.""   Shit happens of course, but watch what happens in the debates. He'll rip the shit out of Clinton, and he'll do it by attacking her position and her politics. When that happens, the polls will swing in his favor, because Clinton can't hide from her scandals (even if they're bullshit); she can't hide from her donors; and she can't hide from her stock portfolio or her board member positions.

Liberal,39yvfd,muddypaws,7,Tue Jun 16 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"First of all, you are implying a misunderstanding of what she wants to accomplish and your implication suggests that you are following the flawed ""all or nothing"" conservative logic which says that the only alternative to the current state of affairs is total socialistic equality.    She absolutely is not saying that she wants rich people to become middle class -- she's not saying she thinks rich people should give away their money or whatever.  She's saying that the gap is too wide -- that the inequality distribution is too steep.  She can still be very wealthy but we basically need some reengineering of the economy to make it so wealth is less unequally distributed.  The way I see it, there are two types of rich elites.  (1) There are the rich elites who don't want to talk about wealth inequality because they want to stay just as ultrawealthy forever as they already are and they don't care about society. (2) Then there are the rich elites who believe in fighting for less inequality for two reasons: it's the healthiest thing to do for the economy and society and it's also the morally right thing to do.  And so here's the thing:  we're never going to have meaningful change on wealth inequality without some leaders who are rich elites.  So basically, if we believe that rich elites can't decry wealth inequality, we'll never get anywhere."

Color me unimpressed"
Liberal,39yvfd,wiking85,0,Tue Jun 16 14:27:26 2015 UTC,"She hasn't really been dodging the media.  She decided she wanted to wait before starting her public campaign.  Campaigning is expensive and she did not want/need to start earlier than this.  We're 8 months away from the earliest primaries so she's got plenty of time to make her plans very, very clear.  Bernie Sanders is great.  He got started early because he had to.  That's the only way he was going to have any chance.  And look at what's happened -- in some places he's closing the gap.  Nationally, he's still way behind and all past knowledge of polls and elections says that he's too far behind.  But can something extraordinary happen this time?   Who knows.  Will be fun to watch."

Liberal,39yvfd,kennewickman,0,Tue Jun 16 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even call myself a big fan of hers -- not at all actually.  I'm moreso a fan of dealing with truths.  One truth is that Bernie Sanders, as much as I love him (more than I like her, for sure), will be a vulnerable candidate in the general election.  That's just a fact -- the more extreme candidate will always have trouble in the general election because more moderates would then vote for the Republican.  And the presidential election is almost entirely about attracting moderate voters.  Think of it like this.  I think there's about 35% of the public who are hardcore Republicans -- they know today that they will vote for the Republican in November 2016.  And there's about 35% of the public who are hardcore Democrats -- they know today that they will vote for the Democrat.  That leaves 30% in the middle who are persuadable.  Call them moderates, independents, indecisives, weirdos, whatever -- but it's a political reality that this is the center that you win.  And I don't care if you're the biggest Bernie Sanders fan in the world -- you'd have to agree with me that Hillary is going to have a better chance to win that center.  Now even if you agree with me you'll probably say ""yeah, that's true, but I don't want to settle for the moderate -- I want the guy who is really going to push a genuine agenda to fight for the middle class.""  And I can't really say you are exactly wrong there.  What I can say is that I think Hillary will or already does see that the president who wins the next election will need to fight hard to reduce wealth inequality.  And I will also say that you might be short-sighted if you think that Bernie Sanders will have the best ideas about how to go about fighting wealth inequality.  I think Hillary has some ideas too and her ideas might be more successful than Bernie's would be.  Basically, as much as you or I may like Bernie, you have to acknowledge what Obama has found out, which is that WANTING to do things as president does not equal being able to do all of those things.  And so it's not just that I worry about Bernie losing the general election to a terrible Republican -- although this is the main worry.  The other worry is that if Bernie gets elected he would have the same trouble as Obama has had in implementing his agenda."

In all honesty if someone such as Bernie wasn't running I wouldn't even vote or be mildly interested. I've grown tired of our system where democracy and capitalism are pushed as one and the same.   That all said, if it were Bush and Clinton I'd go Clinton but I'm still a Bernie champion."

I'm pretty sure it will be Walker or Rubio.  I would not discourage you at all from championing Bernie.  Hell, I am still trying to figure out how to feel about it all.  I would only lightly encourage you, at some point, to consider the realistic view that most elections end up becoming a matter of voting AGAINST the worst candidate and not FOR a candidate you love.  Call that cynicism or realism or whatever but these things tend to have patterns and the pattern in these elections is that you are often -- if not always -- unsatisfied with the candidates.  Which is all another way of saying that you should still want to vote in fall 2016 even if your choice is Hillary -- not because you love or even like her but because you are scared of what a Republican would do.  I mean, imagine if all millenials just got disaffected and didn't vote in 2016.  Republicans would sweep into power and they'd get the message that voters don't care about things like inequality.  We need massive numbers of millennials to come out against that kind of bullshit, whoever the Democratic candidate is.

Being a member of one underprivileged group isn't going to rally all under privileged groups behind you, especially when you're a VERY privileged person to begin with.

In your post, you go right to the social issues which seem to get conservatives (note, i said conservatives and not republican. They are different things in this political climate) riled up the quickest, so I will only reply to your points.   It is simply my belief that homosexuality is unnatural   This is factually incorrect.  Homosexual (and many other types of sexual behavior) is commonly observed among all animals; humans are not unique in this. And yes, humans are animals too. We are not separate from the animal kingdom.   and wrong   This is an opinion. You are free to have it, and no one of maturity will gain say you for it (other than to disagree).  This is where the division lies:  It is OK to feel that homosexual behavior is abhorrent or want to be away from it.  That is your right as a human being - to feel or believe as you like, so long as it does not harm another.   It is NOT OK to opress a population because you find them personally disgusting.  This is the same as lynching a white woman and a black man because they chose to marry, or imprisoning a japanese family because they are japanese.    It is not how you feel about homosexuals that makes you a bigot, its supporting laws or culture that excludes them from the same rights and privileges that you enjoy that does.     I believe that marriage is a God ordained union that was designed to be between one man and one woman.   This is factually incorrect.  Marriage existed for thousands of years before the birth of christianity, or any other abrahamic religion.  Furthermore, your own bible defines marriage as anything but one man and one woman.  (Conversely, it also doesn't state anything about homosexual marriage either).   My belief is that God alone creates life   This is factually incorrect. We have been creating life and its component ingredients for quite some time in laboratory settings.  Let me be clear - on the topics discussed your beliefs are irrelevant in the face of indisputable fact.  What you believe has no relevance to reality. This is not an attack on you, your character, your religion or anything else. It simply is.   On the subject of Republicans; for a party that prides itself on its goal of limiting government interference in the lives of the governed - they sure seem to do everything they can to restrict the behavior and attitude of others.    Liberals heap scorn on republicans for this reason - the constant attacks against individual liberty by the very party claiming to preserve them is FRIGHTENING.  To many, republicans are seeking to enforce a bronze age level of scientific advancement and culture on the american populace - thus destroying everything America has fought to gain.  Ironically, this is what conservatives accuse liberals of.    However, whether Liberal or Conservative, Republican or Democrat, Christian, Jew, Muslim or Athiest, we are all Americans,   Precisely the reason why your religious ideals have no place in any government, ever.

Liberal,39pzez,kilgore_trout87,0,Wed Jun 24 22:35:01 2015 UTC,"The increase in over head costs for businesses would cause prices to increase which would be a wealth transfer from consumers to employees.  The consumers all pay the same price but the employees see gains proportional to their income so it's regressive.  Or instead of prices increasing we see wages decrease, which would be a wealth transfer from those who do not plan on having children to those who do.  Or the increase of costs on employers cause some with very slim profit margins to go out of business, so we are helping working parents at the detriment of some people who will lose their job.  In all likely hood it will be some combination of the three depending on the industry.  Though this is all assuming that parental leave is coming from a government mandate that all businesses have to follow.  You could instead have a flat payment to all families regardless of their income during the time of their leave (paid for by an appropriate tax increase) or by trying to find ways to increase worker bargaining power."

The ""everyone hates socialism"" take on the Gallup poll ignores the fact that the overall results are wildly skewed by conservatives' lock-step opposition to the word.  Furthermore Sanders isn't a ""Socialist"" in the way a lot of people understand the term.  He self-identifies as a democratic socialist, but in actuality his policy platforms and the countries he points toward are social democratic.

Sanders would be better than Clinton, and if Sanders can beat Clinton in the primary, there's no reason to believe he would stand a worse chance then her in the general.  You're looking at this election through a 90s lens.  That's not the way they've worked out for the past decade.  Modern national elections are about motivating voters to get off their asses and vote for their team, not convincing them to change teams.  If Hillary wins the nomination, then we're fucked for the next decade.

That's why I said ""Brand Socialism,"" because regardless of how mainstream his views are, regardless of whether he's a socialist or not, Bernie insists on using the word ""socialist,"" as though he's intentionally labeling and compartmentalizing himself as something most Americans say they oppose.    The majority of democrat-leaning voters have a positive view of the word socialism.   Logically, if only Democrats are allowed to vote in 2016, we'll win.

Physicians already practice under certain rules where they must provide healthcare to patients IN A HEALTHCARE SETTING such as a hospital.  EMTALA already provides some governance on when/how a patient can be refused treatment, and guidelines on patient transfers.  RNs cannot walk out in the middle of their shift without transferring care of their patients, or else they risk losing their license for patient desertion.  There are all kinds of existing legal and ethical rules about practitioner -patient relationships, including no duty to treat if there is no physician-patient relationship (for example, someone cannot go to a doctor's or RN's house and knock on their door and say ""I know you're a doctor, you have to remove this wart right now because I say so!"")  As far as private practice, physicians get to refuse new patients all of the time.  Following certain guidelines and documenting reasons, they can fire patients they already have established relationships with.  And never are they dragged out of their homes and forced to provide care.  Giving every American a right to pursue exams and treatment by giving them the right to FUNDED healthcare has nothing to do with slavery of physicians, or the right to home invasions, and Rand Paul knows that.  What he said was not only flat-out LYING, but was hugely irresponsible."

As we have already seen in the education system, transportation, and law enforcement...As well as many  examples where an implemented social health care system has created long waits for specialists, and just generally demotivated healthcare workers...   No they aren't being conscripted, they are not being arrested for not providing services or anything like that... But once you force someone to become a public servant...

He believes that from the bottom of his heart.  A friend of mine likes to use the phrase ""market fundie"" for this type of thinking, a reference to the shorthand of referring to fundamentalist Christians as ""fundies"".  The similarities are striking.  The free market is their ""god"".  It's taken as dogma that the market will solve everything, therefore by definition anything that restricts the market in any way is the enemy.  They also have persecution fetishes just like your average fundamentalist Christian, only to them it's things like ""taxation is violence"", and they fetishize the use of the word ""force"" as a simile to ""slavery"", as in Paul's statement about ""force me to take care of you'.

And if you have a good doctor, he can patiently tell you what the latest research is saying.  For example, I was having acid reflux.  My doctor was concerned about the purple pill whatever it's called, raising your Ph too much because he knew I know what that means.  So he put me on Zantac instead because it only raises your Ph about 1 and does the job.  He was right. (There were other reasons too).

The same people who rail against Monsanto and GMO's, claim that aspartame causes cancer or thinks anything not organic is poison are the usually same people who think vaccines cause autism or are harmful.

There are 234 million people in the US of voting age. So at the very best, you're using one person who speaks for 380,000 people and applying it to 89 million people.  As I said, we have our own wingnuts who think that vaccines are dangerous. Bachman is one of them.

There are dozens of complete morons with (D) behind their name currently in congress who have said some insanely stupid things. Should their idiotic rants be applied to all Liberals. Should I conclude that the majority of Liberals don't know that islands can't tip over because one Democrat congressman thinks so?  So instead of focusing on one person and painting an entire group of millions with that brush, let's look at statewide exemptions for vaccines, which is a better representative sample size than one person. Of the top 12 states with the highest exemption rate, 8 are blue states. Of the 8 states with <1% vaccine exemption rate, 5 are solid Conservative states. So when looking at actual rates at which people refuse vaccines, those who are on the Left decidedly outnumber those on the Right."

You're assuming that everyone who supported Bachman as Rep and as President agreed with her stance on vaccinations. It's not like Bachmann was running in a single issue and that issue was vaccinations.  By that logic, should I conclude that anyone who supports Hillary Clinton supported or at least agreed to military intervention in Iraq in 2003? Or how about the Left is anti-gay because Candidate Barack Obama back in 2008 said that marriage is between a man and a woman?  Ted Kennedy killed a woman, so I guess the Left is misogynistic. 2008 Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich says he had an encounter with an alien craft and ""felt a connection in his heart and heard directions in his mind."" So obviously the entire Left must believe aliens are visiting us and communicating telepathically with us. With your logic, you can draw all sorts of erroneous conclusions by applying one candidate's beliefs to the entire party he/she runs for.  You don't think you have wingnuts who are representatives? How about Maxine Waters who said sequestration would cost 170 million jobs, despite only 134 jobs available at the time or who thinks that Sharia Law is compatible with the Constitution? Or how about Hank Johnson who thought that too many US troops on Guam would make it tip over? Then there's Diana DeGette who thinks that, by banning high capacity magazines, bullets used in them will eventually won't be available anymore. Robert Byrd was a former KKK Wizard, so I guess Liberals are racist against blacks and Jews.  So sure, you can cherry pick one anti-vax Republican politician and use that brush to paint the entire Conservative population, but to do so is intellectually lazy and dishonest. Instead, let's look at the states who have laws exempting vaccines and their respective exemption rates. 8 of the top 12 states with the highest exemption rates for vaccines are blue states. Of the 8 states with the lowest exemption rates, 5 were Red states. So millions of people in deep blue states have chosen not to get vaccines (for whatever reason) while the states with the lowest exemption rates are solidly Conservative, but no you're right, just because one person has an anti-vaccine opinion and she ran for President, the anti-vax movement must be the a right-wing movement."

Nope, you can point to one former and bimboesque Congresswoman and that's all you need to declare that it is the Right who is anti-vaccine.  There is plenty of things Michele Bachmann represents Conservatives on, smaller government, individual liberty, lower taxes, etc. But you're mistaken in assuming that she represents the majority of Conservatives with her stance on vaccinations. The data do not reflect that. Again the highest exemption rates are in solid blue states while the lowest exemption rates occur in solid red states. You're saying that one person's opinion on everything must be applicable to an entire group. This is just false. I don't know why you're focusing solely on politicians and ignoring the millions of people who choose not to get vaccines. Would you like to be judged by the stupid shit Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden have said?  And I said Bachmann represents 300,000 people because you literally said, ""Bachmann represents all conservatives because ""Representative"" is literally in her title. By that logic, are all Liberals represented by Maxine Waters? Nancy Pelosi? William Jefferson? Each party has their idiots, many of them run for President.

Liberal,39dlos,ReservoirHotdogs,4,Thu Jun 11 01:25:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, it seems that you have really thought out most of this.  I will not address all of your concerns, but just try to give you might point of view on a few things that led me to liberalism.  1) Environmentalism - removing oil subsidies would definitely help, but that does not address the pollution that oil causes, which renewables do not.  Everyone suffers and pays for the pollution.  Without ownership of this pollution, you get a tragedy of the commons problem. I am not automatically averse to taxes or think government is the worst option, but many feel this way no matter what facts may say.  I only point this out to say that if you are averse to government and trust private companies or churches more, then maybe you are not liberal...this always seems to be the biggest deciding factor.  You may distrust all 3, but usually there is one that is the least bad option to some people (and those who say the people should have all the power are just deluding themselves, it is not possible IMHO).  2) Gun control - Honestly, how long has the right wing been telling people to hoard guns and ammo because Obama is coming for them?  They said the same of Clinton.  Even after Sandy Hook nothing happened...and nothing major is going to happen.  The left is pretty divided on this actually, I don't really ever see anything major on this ever happening.  Maybe a national registry, but even then people would think black helicopters will be coming for their .22's so even that would probably never happen.  3) Healthcare - So ACA was basically an idea from the Heritage Foundation in the 90's.  Before ACA, anyone without health insurance could go to an ER, rack up thousands in debt and then not pay.  The ER has to take everyone.  So you are stuck with a situation in my mind that is similar to liability insurance in a car, in that someone could rack up $1000's in expenses, unintentionally, and may not be able to pay.  But basically, ACA is just regulations on private health insurance that they must cover everyone and provide certain minimum levels of coverage, in exchange, everyone must buy insurance.  Is it perfect, no, but I'd prefer that the people visiting the ER have their own insurance instead of me paying for it with ever growing premiums.  (Personally I would love a government/Medicare style option, but that will never happen).  But - 'I do think that if we wanted universal healthcare in this country we would have to cut funding in a lot of other areas' - Why?  If govt provided universal coverage, wouldn't I just pay my premium to the government?  If Aetna and Blue Cross can pay their CEO's millions and have profits to give shareholders, and Medicaid already takes care of the poor and very sick/most expensive patients, then why wouldn't the government be able to provide me insurance at a reasonable rate (again, I don't buy the magical, government is always 10x more expensive crap, actually the VA is generally much cheaper than private services). 4) Welfare - Actually, after Clinton reformed welfare, there are work requirements.  Some of the problems you get though, if you have a single mother with 2 small kids and push her to get a job at McD's, taxpayers are paying more to put her kids in daycare than she is making and contributing to society flipping those burgers.  I agree with you that people should work, but as a taxpayer it is not always cost effective.  Does it piss me off that she is sitting there watching daytime tv, getting free money....honestly, not really.  I think more of her kids, sure she may be a piece of shit, but give her kids a chance.  Besides, that money is peanuts compared to the subsidies and handouts our government gives to millionaires.  Hell, the capital gains rate we give to titans of industry that outsource our jobs is more of a give away than all of the welfare we give.  I'm going to stop there, others can address your other points.  In general, I believe in government leveling the playing field (so to speak), then letting the free market work, which is what I believe the majority of liberals really want."
Liberal,39dlos,Canttakethewhyfromme,2,Thu Jun 11 02:42:50 2015 UTC,"I'm actually in favor of the government doing the majority of the work when it comes to addressing climate change, but I also think an important part of it is private companies creating green options. I don't trust churches at all. I think it will take a combined effort of both government and businesses to solve the issue. And I absolutely put saving the planet above political ideology, so there's that.  Your points about gun control are reasonable. I don't think I'd be opposed to a registry and keeping people with a history of mental illness from getting weapons. I just think the issue is more complex than just restricting gun ownership which, in my view, wouldn't do the trick. I don't think Obama is going to be coming for our guns, and I admit that the tyrannical government situation is pretty unlikely, but I think the right to arms should still be protected, just in case a tyrannical government should happen to arise.  On healthcare, I think we could get a single-payer system with Bernie Sanders (who I'm voting for if I get the chance) and I honestly wouldn't mind it.   Your arguments on welfare actually made me question my own views, which is exactly what I wanted from this thread. Thanks!  EDIT: btw, I'm completely in favor of regulating wall street and convicting the people who trashed the economy. I'm with you on that one."

You're certainly entitled to your opinion, but I'd like to point out that ""a June 2014 survey found that more than 3 out of 5 small business owners support increasing the minimum wage to $10.10."".  A higher minimum wage is better for pretty much everyone.  Sure, small business owners wind up paying their employees more, but a higher federal minimum wage means everyone has more disposable income.  If anything, I'd argue this disproportionately helps, not harms small businesses (since more people can afford to pay for their goods and services if the minimum wage is raised)."

Which is ironic as they were fresh out of the forest themselves when Rome came tumbling. This may be partly why Jesus is the zero A.D. starting line by which the enlightened and the dirty pagans are divided because that was literally what their history was (as literacy was a recent development) and nobody could possibly be wiser or more experienced than newly converted oaknuts.  Then came abolitionism and to maintain a sense of superiority all ""white"" people were lumped together to form a bloc in favor of monoculture and white supremacy was born, though it did not apply to everybody with roughly the same shade of beige until later.  In the scope of human history a couple hundred years (if that) is fairly recent and not very broad.  My point is this: ""white"" is not a majority, and definitely not an ethnicity but a lack thereof. It is a construct to create an imagined majority where there is none and as such majority/minority politics work towards the end of reinforcing the problem.  Which definitely means job security when you're in the business of selling books on the subject of monoculturalism on one hand and individualism on the other."

Early modern science used to designate plants and animals as distinct species based on superficial identifiers for the sake of simplifying identification.

Liberal,399bk5,bokono,3,Wed Jun 10 19:30:33 2015 UTC,"Then by the same token one could make the argument that ""black is a lack of ethnicity"", because not all black people share the same history, nationality, language , or cultural experience.

The article says it would potentially reduce the worker's hours and possibly affect their benefits.  However, this would only be for workers who are working more than 40 hours a week, so why wouldn't their benefits apply?  Is it because there is hypothetically 50 hours of work, so one person does it all with no overtime, but if they were to be paid overtime the work would be split between two employees (meaning neither one is full-time), thus making them unable to get benefits?   I would potentially be inline to start receiving overtime at my job if this would go through.  I work an average of 45 hours a week, so either my employer is cutting back my hours to never work more than 40 (a plus) or I'm getting paid more due to overtime.  I see this as a Win-Win.  Bernstein's quote echos the same: “Their salary is the same but they have more time with their families.”  I think I would be very happy if that happened."

However, this would only be for workers who are working more than 40 hours a week, so why wouldn't their benefits apply?   Employers consider labor cost on a total compensation basis, if one element of that compensation (in this case wages) increases without a corresponding increase in productivity or the market cost of labor they will seek to shift the increase in wage cost from other areas of compensation. They may, for instance, switch to a cheaper health insurance policy, reduce retirement benefits etc.  This policy is likely going to exchange a wage boost today for wage growth tomorrow. The cost of hiring is high enough that they wont seek to take on part time labor instead of paying the additional OT, they will attempt to reconfigure benefits in the short-run but in the long-run its just going to flatten wage growth in covered roles."

Quote from the article   By law, any salaried worker who earns below a threshold set by the Labor Department must receive overtime. The current threshold of $23,660 lies below the poverty line for a family four. The proposed rule is expected to raise that to somewhere between $45,000 and $52,000—closer to the median household income—greatly expanding the pool of Americans who qualify for overtime pay."

It's insanely common these days for employers to hire an entry level  person at salary and work them 50+ hours a week just because they can. Salary used to mean you were being compensated well and you may need to work outside of normal hours from time to time.

Liberal,391kxv,Kerplonk,-5,Wed Jun 10 11:39:54 2015 UTC,Yes. Let's ask someone standing in the unemployment line if they would be willing to take that job for 33k and 55 hrs per week. If the answer is no then you quit and then the employer has to raise the pay to get someone to work that job.  If the answer is yes then you either take or lose it to the person wanting it worse than you do. That's called market efficiency and it ensures companies pay what people are worth. If that ideology is tampered with AT ALL then someone is getting screwed.   In your scenario it's the guy that's getting paid salary just above the income level this is getting adjusted to but working his ass off for 55 hrs a week but the guy with less skill just leap frogged him in pay.

The definition of someone who wants the state to provide positive rights (ie, food, water, shelter, backrubs, computers, porn, whatever) is socialist.  Someone who wants negative rights only (government can't: Spy, throw you in jail without due process, etc) is a liberal.  US terminology confuses this all up for historical reasons - the term 'liberal' has been taken by groups who are not liberal, or do not have liberalism as their primary goal."

Liberal,38ul9n,wsppan,4,Wed Jun 10 13:33:15 2015 UTC,"Liberalism is the philosophy of individual freedom and capitalism. It began as classical liberalism, which advocated free markets and free trade. This isn't in the sort of free market touted today, it's more of a fight against monopoly and oligarchy. In Europe, liberalism still retains many of its original qualities, but have been tempered by modern economics to some degree. Additionally, there is another strain in Europe called Ordoliberalism, which is the intellectual backbone of the social market model of Germany. In America, social liberalism is the dominant form, which seeks to remediate the ills of capitalism with an activist government. I find that mainstream American liberals are somewhat between Keynesianism and Social Democracy."

Liberal,38ul9n,einhverfr,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"Isn't corporate capitalism a product historically of liberalism?   Its a product of modern liberalism and the progressiv area. If there is no government that regulates some industry X then no cooperation can use the regulatory agency to give it a better market position.  Lobbying does not make sense if there is nothing to lobby for. If the government has a strong commitment to not care about the steel market, its going to be much harder to lobby for a steel quality rule (a rule that is of course bias towards the steel that the company that does the lobbying). This also applies to tariffs and tax breaks.  Can you honestly say that you know what the government does (and therefore vote correctly) when there are literally millions of rules that you have never ever heard of. One of the main lobbying representatives for a group of peanut producers once said to a public choice professor ""There are only two people who know everything about peanut regulation, and my job is to keep it that way"".     And aren't neoliberals a subtype of liberal?   Neoliberal is not really a coherent concept. Everybody defines it differently. Its roughly a combination of everything that actually happened during the 70-90s.  Some 'neoliberal' policies were done by right parties others by leftists. For some its more about large macro policy, such as monetary policy for others its all about financial  re-regulation.  So 'neoliberal' is more of a political word, not a clear statement of political philosophy, and therefore I do not think its makes sense to call it a 'subtype'. Its not a type at all."
Liberal,38ul9n,nickik,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"Can you honestly say that you know what the government does (and therefore vote correctly) when there are literally millions of rules that you have never ever heard of.    Everywhere I have lived, there are rules and then there are rules, and this is always a disconnect between what are the stated rules and what are the actual rules.  So I am not entirely sure I get your point.  It doesn't take that long to figure out the basics, for example, of how Indonesian traffic rules actually work (the rules are all unspoken).  The actual rules end up being:   Drive carefully. First at the uncontrolled intersection usually gets right or way. Traffic cops are the law, whether they are law enforcement or just someone directing traffic for tips More luxurious vehicle presumed at fault in the event of collision because with wealth comes responsibility.   Now none of that is in the traffic code anywhere.  It's all by social convention and until you have lived there a bit you don't know the rules (you can't read them anywhere).   Neoliberal is not really a coherent concept.   I disagree there.  You have liberalization of markets, and neoliberal policies are an effort to further that through lowering marginal tax rates, globalization, and and deregulation.   This includes Carter-era deregulation, Reagan's tax reform, Clinton's NAFTA, etc.   Some 'neoliberal' policies were done by right parties others by leftists.   Right and left though are not coherent concepts across time.  The sort of nationalism that the Right espouses today for example began in the Left.  Obama has expanded many of Bush's policies and many left of center folks who opposed them under Bush now support the same policies under Obama.  I don't think reference to some imaginary center makes a useful definition of a concept.  Unless you are saying that ""liberal"" isn't really a set of ideas, but really just a political label (much like neoliberal) but I think that's not that satisfying.  My alternative would be to say that Liberalism starts with the individualist liberation theories of folks like Locke and Rousseau and includes all political movements which stand on their shoulders.  In this regard both parties in the US are very liberal, but a country like Indonesia is not at all (there is a move to liberalize Indonesia but I think that would be a horrible mistake)."

Liberal,38ul9n,ReckZero,3,Sun Jun 7 04:40:33 2015 UTC,"Liberal means recognizing that the government can be a useful force in helping achieve the equality promised by the US Constitution, and a necessary force in achieving some measure of societal fairness.  While it's incorrect to say that liberals think government qua government is good, it is correct to say that liberals recognize that government can be good, and is the only tool really able to help solve or reduce some problems.  If you want to put it in a bumper sticker, liberals are the people more afraid of corporations and the social inequity than they are of government, while conservatives are the people more afraid of government than they are of corporations and social inequity.  Liberals, basically, see a number of problems and wish to enlist the government in helping address those problems.  And this approach has a long history of working.  The national highway system was produced by liberals recognizing that there was a need to move people stuff around quickly, to tie small towns into a larger transporation grid, and it worked.  Rural electrification was the result of liberals recognizing that there were a lot of rural people who didn't have the benefits of electricity and spending tax money mostly raised in cities to benefit the rural people, and it worked. Public education is a recognition by liberals that an uneducated population has a lot of problems and funding education, and it worked.  Generally, liberals have a desire to expand freedom and equality to marginalized or minority groups, while conservatives tend to be indifferent to or actively hostile to the idea of bringing marginalized groups into the benefits of society.    Both groups use the government as a tool for achieving their ends, to claim that conservatives are anti-government, or in favor of small government, is simply factually incorrect.  During the era of Jim Crow, for example, liberals wanted to use the power of government to expand freedom to include black people, which mainly involved ending the existing use of government by conservatives to keep black people marginalized.    I'd say that to a large extent American history is the story of the struggle between liberals trying to expand who got the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, and conservatives trying to restrict who got those freedoms.   More generally, and in a nutshell, conservatives favor a strongly enforced social hierarchy, while liberals favor a more equal society."

Those people are now Heros of modern liberals."
Liberal,38ul9n,nickik,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:04:44 2015 UTC,"People, including politicians, are generally complex and often have viewpoints which don't all fit on a neat division.  From my POV as a liberal Roosevelt had some positive points, and a lot of negative ones. These days people who haven't studied him much tend to remember only the trust busting, which appeals to modern liberals due to concerns about growing corporate aristocracy.  The other aspects of his presidency, his rabid xenophobia, his Bush-esque love of war as a means of providing an image of macho manhood [1].  So I'd argue that he's hardly an icon of liberalism, despite some less knowledgeable modern liberals trying to embrace him as such.  Same with Woodrow Wilson.    But, also, don't forget that like conservatism liberalism is a constantly shifting thing.  A liberal from the 1850's would likely have been an abolitionist, but probably also a racist and not at all a believer in racial equality [2].  Similarly, the average liberal then wouldn't likely have been a women's rights activist.  Liberalism, at that time, was mostly looking at getting equality for all white men.  There were, of course, liberals who were feminists, favored civil rights, etc, but at that time those goals were essentially unattainable and thus the focus was on the possible (equal rights for all white men regardless of wealth).    [1] Actually, I'd argue that the parallels between Bush jr and TR are rather striking.  Both grew up as the privileged children of wealth who, for political reasons, reinvented themselves as hyper macho types with cowboy personalities.  TR's detractors often used homophobic terms and images to describe him prior to his own reinvention.  [2] Though that's not always the case, John Brown was not only an abolitionist he was a staunch believer in racial equality, as were several others.  But the majority of liberals back in that era were opposed to slavery but not particularly open to the idea of blacks as equals."
Liberal,38ul9n,sotonohito,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:43:59 2015 UTC,"Bush-esque love of war   Did Bush ever say things like:   “War is not merely justifiable, but imperative upon honorable men, upon an honorable nation, where peace can only be obtained by the sacrifice of conscientious conviction or of national welfare”   I have not heard many Bush speeches, but I have never heard him or anybody since WW2 say things like that. He despised people who did not like war.   But, also, don't forget that like conservatism liberalism is a constantly shifting thing.   Sort of. The people we know call classical liberals/libertarians are largely the same as they were in the days of Smith (and co) and they feel that modern liberals a traitors, just as social democrats are the traitors of socialism (a split that happened largely in WW1).  My point is that liberalism is not changing in a block but rather that they are branching, and modern liberals have managed to secure the word for them selfs (in the US at least)."
Liberal,38ul9n,nickik,3,Wed Jun 10 14:23:19 2015 UTC,"Liberalism is a social and economic theory tied to the dominant ruling class structures within capitalism. Liberalism, as economic theory, believes in the primacy of the capitalist class and in their right to their ownership over the means of production. Liberal Economics comes into its own with Smith and further with Ricardo and later Keynes, amongst others. Thus in the realm of economics Liberals are right of centre to far right.   Social theory is harder to pinpoint because of how varied the liberal side of the aisle is. Liberals support ""rights"" but at the end of the day rights are only for those of the ruling class. Support for feel-good policies, like petitions and walks, are rampant amongst ""left""-liberals but do not actually change anything. They often coopt and deflect working class anger away from the system and derail conversations with oppressed groups.

Liberal is such a broad concept that people will have to use words like ""liberty"" and ""equality"". Getting more specific will get into a particular brand of liberalism, which will necessarily exclude others.   Things which tend to be liberal: policies which tax the wealthy in order to pay for a social safety net, limits on campaign finance, access to things like healthcare for everyone, importance of education, social systems, equal protection under the law, social equality, and such.   Things which are generally not seen as liberal are rugged individualism where you're only out for yourself, social darwinism, unregulated capitalism, money as an ends instead of a means, wars of aggression and using the military for private profit, and such."
Liberal,38ul9n,Willravel,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:26:13 2015 UTC,"But isn't liberalism necessarily individualistic at its core?  I mean liberals see society as a union of individuals, and therefore there is what Philip Blond called the government takeover of society, where the government becomes the responsible for ensuring that everyone can be individualistic.  That's why there is a hostility towards things like strong families, family legacies, and community norms, because communities might oppress those who believe of act differently, or because with strong families, who you are born to determines what life you live, or am I missing something?  Is that not why the Progressive Era and New Deal liberals effectively sought to ensure regulated corporations would supplant family businesses as the social norm?"

Liberal,38ul9n,einhverfr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"I suspect that depends on a number of additional factors. A dear friend of mine from back in college moved to Israel after graduation and currently has found a good life for himself in a lovely kibbutz. This is about as close to pure communism as I am aware humanity has ever achieved, but both the success and freedom of this system are dependent on a number of religious, social, legal, and political realities. Yes, it could be a liberal society with economic freedom, to a degree, but that's not necessarily the case.   What I think you're asking, though, is less real-world and more theoretical. My best answer would have to be ""possibly"". To play libertarian's advocate, what if my farm is seeing significant success and I'd like to purchase the land of the family adjacent in order to expand? Allowing that would be economic freedom, but it would also present the possibilities of significant inequality and eventually a natural monopoly if I continued expanding. Or what if I was born to a family of farmers but wanted to pursue a career as a concert pianist or in banking?   All that said, I think you're right in your implication that people are fooled into thinking that a corporate society is free. I've been impoverished before, and, to paraphrase Nick Fury, I didn't feel an overabundance of freedom. I felt the opposite. I was disempowered, I had virtually no avenues open to me, and I was absolutely at the mercy of the system. When your only choices are homelessness, living off the social safety net, or taking a full time job which pays a good 30% below the poverty line, you're not free."

Liberal,38ul9n,einhverfr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:15:01 2015 UTC,"I think the term is both more broad and dynamic than that. It's nice to think about historical context of liberalism and the perspectives of the great thinkers, but applying Aristotle or Locke to something like transgender medical rights or gerrymandering of congressional districts or global climate change seems like an exercise in stretching them beyond their breaking point.   Like individualism, the concept of liberalism isn't the same for everyone, and can even be contradictory going from one person to the next, with neither necessarily being wrong. That's why it's difficult to give a concrete answer not just to this thread's prompt, but also saying it's the same as Locke or Hobbes or Aristotle. In some ways, I would interpret Aristotle as liberal, but someone could probably make a strong opposing case."
Liberal,38ul9n,Willravel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:43:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can call Aristotle a liberal though.  Sure he was fine with certain forms of same-sex sexual contact, but his concept of society, as a union of procreative family households, is what Rousseau and Locke were trying to get away from.  Certainly Aristotle would have sided against same-sex marriage (same-sex relationships in ancient Greece occurred as a separate set of institutions from marriage) but I dont think one could call him a bigot for that.  I do think you can apply Rousseau to all the issues you mention.  After all the problem from that viewpoint is that people are entitled to freedom but are everywhere in chains, right?  That's what transsexual rights are all about, what same-sex marriage is all about, etc. right?  We must free people from the chains of family and community using the power of the state, from Rousseau's viewpoint.  But if you go that way, then it is worth noting that rights theory and liberalism are philosophical outgrowths of, primarily, Calvinism, while Catholicism tends to be much more Aristotelian and Hinduism tends to arrive at a social order even more traditionalist than that."

And those people should be grateful.  A liberal outlook, on the other hand, begins from a place of empathy, that it's valuable to understand that most everyone else has had a life experience different from yours and that civilization should understand and accept those differences, and offer help to those who want opportunities to change or improve the station assigned to them by birth or other circumstance.

His argument still stands that a person who commits a heinous crime , using that crime as an example, deserves the death penalty. The fact that we found out that the man was innocent (which is great), does not change the circumstances of that crime, which is what Scalia based his argument on.  Now you could very easily argue that the fact that we found this man was innocent shows that having the death penalty makes the chances of killing an innocent man too great, but this article doesn't make that argument."

If they were to actually stone gay people, some liberals would stand there and tell us their religion had nothing to do with it.  Now...I get the liberal resistance, I really do. There are people, typically conservatives, that are legitimately bigoted towards Muslims and Arabs and they really have discriminated against both groups, even violently. Do not let that fact cloud your judgment about the separate and distinct issue of Islam, the extremism it inspires, and the extent to which Islam is compatible with Western values.  It is logically consistent, and I argue the correct stance, to decry bigotry and extremism towards Muslims while simultaneously decrying the same from them. And no, pointing out that Islam really does motivate 'extremism,' espouses dogma that contradicts with Western values, and that a large number of Muslims maintain these beliefs is not extreme, it's just being candid.  I believe what we're ultimately dealing with is the mindset Eric Hoffer called ""The True Believer,"" from his book of the same name. It's a human problem, one that can afflict almost any group, religious or secular. Any ideology that promotes an adversarial view of others and has a pattern of welcoming or excusing violence for its own benefit will attract the worst of the true believers. Religion is an especially fertile field, and all of the Abrahamic religions contain at their core these adversarial views of others, complete with rationalizations and justifications for welcoming and excusing violence. We're just in a time where more Muslims (who are not the majority) embrace those views and patterns than Jews or Christians."

Different social Darwinists have different views about which groups of people are the strong and the weak, and they also hold different opinions about the precise mechanism that should be used to promote strength and punish weakness.

Says Damon Watson, one of Cruz’s law-school roommates: “He said he didn’t want anybody from ‘minor Ivies’ like Penn or Brown.”   Another:   In one debate, he proposed a method to detect infidelity, in which God should “give women a hymen that grows back every time she has intercourse with a different guy, because that will be a ‘visible sign’ of the breach of trust,” according to a recollection by David Kennedy published in a Harvard debate team reunion booklet in 2001.

He said that they ONLY recruited from Harvard; they found that they got their best and brightest minds from there.  I opined that they were kidding themselves, and at the very least all they were doing was outsourcing their HR function to Harvard's recruiting personnel.  I felt that they had no idea what they might be missing by being so exclusive.

Yeah, if you are the son of a multimillionaire donor, money can get you into any elite university but in today's world, white, affluent males are the last thing colleges want (hint: affirmative action).  You really are quite delusional if you think money is the only factor required to get accepted to college. Also, yes, Cruz was ""technically brilliant"".  It requires extensive talent, knowledge and oratory skill to be a national debate champion and extremely well respected professors have commented on his superior intelligence amongst his classmates.  He was also magna cum laude at Harvard Law which has nothing to do with being more privileged."

The problems in question are much more serious in the humanities than in the STEM fields. I'm a post-doc in math now and I'm not really worried about these issues, but it is clear that some of my colleagues in sociology, English and some other fields are finding real concerns about what is going on. It helps to remember that no one is saying that they are afraid of students who question them: the entire problem is students using academic bureaucracies as responses to statements made by professors that make them feel uncomfortable or they disagree with.

I mean, if you're going to roll around in a barrel and run from a bull, you might as well take pride in your work.   I don't understand why no one sees the drama and pageantry that is the modern GOP. Are contemporary Republicans that involved and invested in soup operas and TV dramas that they are unable to see through this garbage?   I recently had a conversation with my mother. She's seemingly far-right. She's very religious in her her personal life but she respects the value or secularism. Upon political disection, she understands and appreciates all of the issues the same way that I do.   I feel like the US is sitting on a powder keg of progressivism. I still believe in American exceptionalism. I know that our elected president, FDR was able to meld the best of capitalism and socialism. That success wasn't his alone. Millions of socialist, communist, and downtrodden capitalist Americans organized, struck, agitated, and elected leaders that effected change for the common man. We (our predecessors) fought at home for fair treatment, and overseas for international political power. There was a reason that Roosevelt was the US's only four term president."

Each of these fools are nothing more than the bought and paid for sock puppets of their respective billionaire donors.  Pete Peterson owns Chris Christie, at least until Christie gets indited. Peterson's issue has long been to privatize Social Security. Christie doesn't have to get many votes for Peterson to ""win"". He just has to shift the debate. Same goes for the other billionaires.   There is no upside for them in a debate with Democrats. Therefore I really doubt it will happen. I kind of half wonder if the GOP nominee will debate in the presidential campaign. Who would they accept as a moderator? The GOP is so divorced from reality and their world view is so fragile no one other than a Fox commentator would be acceptable to them to moderate the debates.

This proves two things:    The Media has no idea what Americans want.  Americans desperately crave a real progressive.  Another FDR.   The only reason why Hillary's poll numbers are high is because there was no one running against her and she is still a better candidate than ANY Republican.  I've said it before, the presidency was Elizabeth Warren's for the taking.  But for her own reasons she decided not to run. I love Bernie Sanders but I wish he was younger.

Those kind of assumptions sound strange to me, because people in my country really don't care about whether you fit in a traditional gender role or not. Could you give me some studeies and examples on this and tell me - if you want to- in which country you live? Another thing: the choices are really not that complex, some people may value money (i.e. work) as more essential in pursuing happiness, some may want it just to survive and may want more time with their family. And from a statistical stance it's not unreasonable to assume men would be more eager to obtain money as women tend to like men with more money.

Liberal,38i2zs,daddysgun,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:59:12 2015 UTC,"In Texas, for example, the family court system places a clause in every divorce decree by default that says the custodial parent (the woman) may not move her residence out of the state with the children unless the other parent (her ex-husband) approves.  So a woman must choose between her career, better job in another state, for example, and her children.  Society stacks the deck so that she really has no choice, she can only choose the children.   And then claim she chose that because that's what makes women happy. Most people believe this is fair and that the court is trying to give the kids the best circumstance, having both parents living near enough to be active and involved. If that were true, however, the court would impose a similar incentive on fathers to make it less desirable for them to move away, such as increased child support.  But fathers can move away from their kids and the court doesn't see a need to step in and make that choice more difficult."

It's certainly not like you have no other workplace options in Texas a state with the population, it seems like a good compromise to set the limit at the state boundaries so that the other parent can still see his child, but you can work somewhere else. And I guess as soon as the non-custodial parent goes to another state or country you're free to go as well and don't have to follow. Anyway since it can be applied to both parents where does the discrimination come into play, especially considering you don't have to answer personal questions about you to you boss (at least in my country)?"
Liberal,38i2zs,daddysgun,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:22:44 2015 UTC,"The discrimination is 1) most custodial parents are women; and 2) when fathers have custody, they are more likely to be given permission by the court to move away for a better job over the objections of the other parent; and 3) men are more likely to have money to hire an attorney to appeal to the courts for what they want than women.  Also, the boundary is actually the county.  I said ""state"" because most people are interested in moving to another state.  The courts actually restrict you to living in contiguous counties.   This is a father's rights issue, not a matter of what's best for the children.  Because if it were about what's best for the children, then the courts would also discourage fathers from moving away too. They don't do that at all."

One psychologist interviewed by ABC News said what the Santorums did was encouraged at the time, although no longer recommended; another told the media outlet: ""It's not far out of the norm at all ... There is nothing pathological about it or particularly alarming.""[242] Writers who had experienced a stillbirth defended the Santorums' actions, with columnist Charles Lane writing that he personally regretted not showing the body of his stillborn baby to his then six-year-old son,[243] and Jessica Heslam, writing that holding her own stillborn baby brought her ""much peace"".

Liberal,38csg3,nogodsorkings1,3,Wed Jun 3 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"Given how the '97%' figure comes from, among other sources, a peer reviewed paper in a top quality journal (Anderegg et all, PNAS, Vol 107, p12107,), I'm curious at your statement of 'laughably unrepresentative'.  I've read that paper, beginning to end, its methodology is exactly how one would determine whether there is consensus, at least among climate scientists (in fact it goes above and beyond what would normally be done to determine consensus I am a scientist and the only scientific issue I know where the consensus was more clearly demonstrated is evolution).  Which again, the same people denying climate change are in too many cases literally the same people saying the jury is still out on evolution (Talking to you Marco Rubio!)  My issue in reading conservative 'rebuttals' to it is that they're either utterly inaccurate (A favorite attack is that the number is not mathematically determined, when it genuinely is) or bizarre (""They think it's 97% well what about Richard Lindzen!"", which, while he exists, mentioning him by name does nothing to address the figure).  This is further bolstered by the response I don't see, which would be 'if the 97% methodology is so flawed, repeat the estimation using a less flawed method and determine what the consensus number genuinely is', this response is genuinely absent.    You think a top tier journal could publish that 97% of researchers in a given field are in agreement on a scientific issue and not have a revolt on their hands if any sizable portion weren't in that group?    Where are the large numbers of climatologists saying 'this is not our field's viewpoint!'  I've not seen any and I've looked."

Powell is a smart guy. What I am saying is that in this type of survey, the results could not be reasonably interpreted as lending support to a certain position. Powell seems to avoid explicitly saying that it does. But, some consumers of science media did make that connection, and presented the headline figure in a very misleading way. I further suspect, but cannot conclusively prove, that Powell intended for the message to be simplified and abused, because getting the masses to convert to the good side requires a dumbed down message.   Nothing in your analysis addresses Anderegg's methodology in the slightest.    No, I can't simultaneously address every similar study. I used Powell as typical of the studies I been directed to at the time I looked at it.  Anderegg is paywalled and I can't find where to read it. Summaries I have read from supportive sites do not lead me to believe it is much better, but I can't say for sure. For example, the version of the consensus statement it finds a high agreement with seems very watered down, and the sort of thing that even many self-identified skeptics would find uncontroversial."

I apologize; I replied to the comment threads in a different context. I had no initial opinion on the study you mentioned, but wrote out my thoughts on Powell first in response to the broader topic of ""X% consensus"" studies as such, showing a problem in interpretation I found typical of them. I then linked you that to explain where I was coming from. It was not meant as a specific response to the exact thing you said.  But since you asked ... it wasn't paywalled, I just misread the button on the new site layout. I've read through it and the source list.  I do like Anderegg in the fact that it avoids the sweeping classification problems present in something like Cook or Powell. I am mixed on using Google Scholar citations as a proxy for academic merit but recognize that it's probably the only feasible way to do something like this, and is an improvement.  That said, I think it ultimately has a similar problem of not being consistent in defining who is and is not on the side of consensus. The paper sets out the following as the consensus position:   it is ""very likely"" that anthropogenic greenhouse gases have been responsible for ""most"" of the ""unequivocal"" warming of the Earth's average global temperature in the second half of the 20th century.   Alright then, although many self-identified skeptics have no problem with that statement. The CE (agree) group is then drawn from various public statements that support something close to this. But the UE (unconvinced) group is drawn from public statements that aren't always addressing the same thing.  For example, the 2009 Cato advertisement had signatories agreeing to the following:   the case for alarm regarding climate change is grossly overstated surface temperature changes have been modest over the past century and have not increased on net from 1999-2009 there has been no increase in weather-related damages relative to the size of the economy recent trends belie computer models President Obama was unjustified in stating ""The science [was] beyond dispute"" that warming was one of the most urgent threats facing America and the world.   While one can disagree with all of those, it should be noted that not a single one of those positions is necessarily in conflict with the established consensus statement. One can believe humans are responsible for most 20th century warming while believing it has slowed as of late, or is not an overwhelming economic threat, or has diverged from forecasts. The consensus statement the Anderegg paper presents takes no position on the effects or future of global warming whatsoever, but now researchers are labeled as ""unconvinced"" of that consensus because of their agreement that the President was exaggerating the consensus on future effects.  More ambiguous is the 2008 ""Manhattan Declaration on Climate Change"", a decidedly fringe-y publication which agrees that, in brief:   the consensus is overstated catastrophic AGW is not proven adaptation is preferable to abatement taxes and regulation suck   This is again not necessarily contrary to the Anderegg consensus statement, which doesn't address the effects of AGW, or the costs and benefits of any proposal to address it.  You get the point. There isn't a consistent standard, and nothing akin to a survey statement that is asked of all subjects. This strikes me as highly unscientific, even if it was done in good faith. I also worry about selection bias in selecting these lists. The UE lists go as far back as two decades, while the CE lists were almost all within a year or two of the study's publication. A huge amount changed since 1992."

Liberal,38csg3,Procean,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, but the CE side of the paper was drawn from open letters and public petitions too. There was even a pair of CE/UE open letters from different members within the same organization. That was the point of the paper, to use each side's public lists to build rosters, and assess the credibility of the scientists within those groups.  The consensus roster was not sourced from peer reviewed anything. The goal was the aggregation of various lists of people who had made a public commitment on either side, and then to see which group had more numerous and oft-cited literature. Both sides did indeed have such literature, just not in equal quantity or (inferred) quality.  The credibility of those public statements either way is not central to the point I was making. Indeed, it isn't even central to the point Anderegg was making. The point, which I had thought was apparent in context, was that the lists Anderegg had gathered weren't consistently taking a side on the same thing. Anderegg defined a ""consensus position"", then started finding lists of people who had signed onto publications, letters, etc expressing an opinion on said position. My problem was that the statements in question didn't consistently address the same thing."

If there is a reliable consensus that ""humans are responsible for more than half of 20th century warming"", it is not justified to drop that context and say something to the effect of ""AGW poses a severe threat that must be remedied with X policy proposal, and 97% of scientists are with me""."

Liberal,38csg3,no_en,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:30:51 2015 UTC,"I've read that page. It doesn't address the most relevant criticism of such studies. It doesn't matter how many times the study is replicated, because the objection is not that the answer is wrong, but rather that the question asked is unhelpful.  Some time ago, I looked into one such survey myself (Powell, which is slightly different than Cook but not in ways that pertain to this conversation). I downloaded his table of papers surveyed, then used a random number generator to select 50 papers for a closer look.  The way these X% figures are used in argument creates the impression that they are analogous to a survey intended to measure agreement with a certain opinion statement. In this case, that statement might be something like:   Global warming is real, primarily human-caused, and has negative effects.   It is strongly implied, in comment threads such as this, that such studies go something like this:   Of the studies which investigate Opinion X, what percent conclude with agreement?   or more loosely:   Of the studies which express a view on Opinion X, what percent agree?   And if the X% consensus is to mean anything at all for settling internet arguments, it had better refer to something like that. But it doesn't.  I spent an entire Saturday reading those randomly-selected papers, of which 99.xx% were interpreted as supporting the consensus. Only one of the fifty could be charitably interpreted as coming to any sort of conclusion on the matter. The rest were things like this:   Recently, Gas A has been targeted for phase-out of industrial use due to it's high GHG potential. Gas B has been proposed as a potential replacement. This paper will investigate the magnetic properties of Gas B and its suitability for use in Industrial Process X.      Previous investigations on the lifecycle carbon emissions of Consumer Product X have relied on simplified models of their transportation cost. This paper proposes a more nuanced model of transportation usage in lifecycle emissions estimates.      Our team has been investigating the growth of Plant X under varying CO2 levels. This paper describes our new testing apparatus for controlling CO2 levels in the vicinity of Plant X, which we will be using in future studies.   And so on. No reasonable person could say that papers such as these could be drawn upon to judge the truthfulness of the climate consensus statement that the audience is being trained to connect with the X% headline figure. The real headline should be ""99% of papers tagged with climate change express no opinion on climate change, or its anthropogenic nature.""  However, to the author, because they had been tagged with climate change or similar in online searches, they were therefore ""climate change papers"", 99.xx% of which were then classified as ""implicitly agreeing"" with the author's version of the consensus statement, which is something like ""climate change is real and humans are the cause"". He then paired this widest possible conception of agreement with the narrowest possible conception of disagreement, which demanded explicit rejection to be counted.  All of this adds up to a study that answers a question nobody was asking and doesn't advance the conversation at all. However, the study was intended to presented in a misleading context, because when he published it, Powell also distributed a set of pie-charts showing this overwhelming consensus, targeting social media. This meaningless figure was shamelessly regurgitated on various sympathetic media outlets, shared widely on Facebook, and upvoted on reddit.  For the past couple years, these various absurd percent-consensus numbers have been used as a cudgel in debates by people who don't know what they actually represent, which works against the uninitiated, but hardens the opposition, who are invested in the issue and know how shallow the studies' conclusions are. It's totally unnecessary, and could be remedied by a more reliable and straightforward opinion poll with unambiguous terms."

Okay, but you can't use that as proof in the same way. The way you determine what X% of a group of people think is by polling that group and reporting the number. The standard of ""implicit agreement"" can be used to justify far more than the people in question might actually believe.  Still, I can't even give you that much in the parallel you are drawing. A researcher working in biology or physics will likely be doing work that necessary builds or relies on the fact of evolution or relativity respectively. This is not the case with someone investigating the industrial applications of a new welding gas that is being phased in for environmental reasons. Unless the scope of meta-analysis is limited to climate scientists specifically, the work in the case of these ""consensus surveys"" is very frequently tangential at best to climate change and does not depend on the truth or falsehood of the consensus as stated."

There was a point that we reached a few decades ago, where no state will challenge us. This is what a group such as ISIL feeds on. They're actively waiting on our assault.  Everything they've done, from their inception up til now has been hinged one insulting and influencing the west. They know as well as most well educated school children, that further US involvement in the region will create more regional and religious ire, and therefore more recruitment to their cause. Everyone who calls for more US involvement is ignoring this central fact. These people are neither religious or political. They are strategic and powerful. They will use any means necessary and available. In the meanwhile, they hold 5,000 - 7,000 young girls and women as slaves.  At what point? At what point does the region take responsibility for itself? I understand that everyone on the right wants us to declare war on this non-entity. I say non-entity because that's the way the Muslim world thinks of them.  I'm am goddamned sick of my country policing the world. There is no way of calculating the cost or expense of our recent irresponsible wars on foreign soil. Perhaps it's time we encouraged, enabled, and allowed people to solve their own problems. I for one support an alliance with Iran."
Liberal,38eog7,bokono,2,Thu Jun 4 06:33:10 2015 UTC,"Superpower has super responsibilities. I, for one, is not condoning US to go all over the world using a sledgehammer in a china shop. It is often very easy to see failures and forget the successes. US have in many ways, secure the peace in most places for a long time.   For one thing, whether you agree or not, US policies regarding the Cold War is a success due to the simple fact that it remained cold. Cold Wars are the exceptions, not the norm in affairs of states, when back in 20th century and before that, countries go to war at a drop of the hat and dragged everyone into it. The world wars are as much an example of the failure of the old European order of shifting alliances as much as a juxtaposition to the way US handled Soviet in the Cold War; it never got hot!   And US lead the world on a new type of international politics, that the developed world has a responsibility to the lesser fortunate, which by itself is a sublime show of compassion (or naivety as some might called it) based on the idea that prosperity and peace should be universal, and people have the right to self-determine. No time in history have such philosophy being acted upon.   The failure of Middle East, or the perception of its failure, I believe lies in the inability for the US, and to a certain extent the entire West to understand the nuances of the region, and sometimes the direct exploitation of local conflict for our short term benefits. The rest is history. Whether we should intervene is not really the question. The question is how. Far too much is at stake for a superpower like US to quietly standby and ignore Middle East when so much is tied to the region.   When you build the tools to protect your interests, you are tempted to use it. But my problem is that politicians, and Americans themselves have no ability to direct a foreign policies on a volatile and complicated region such as ME, but inevitably domestic politics and public opinions dominated these policies in the first place. There is no easy answer, precisely because we live in a democracy. If we lived in an authoritative, then you can very well just not think for our country and blame the government. But honestly, who will want that?"

Liberal,38f73j,CrossBowGuy237,0,Wed Jun 3 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"As well, if you want to join us officially and help us continue to build the Model US Government, just message me (the party chairman) to join the party! Here's the official platform as well if you're interested:   Domestic  Gun Control The Democratic Party endorses the limiting of gun availability. While we support the right of any individual to own a gun, we also support the institution of common-sense regulations of firearms, such as a national gun registry, as well as the reinstitution of the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 and the barring of terrorists from owning weapons.  Crime The Democratic Party calls for the softening of criminal charges and convictions, as well as a decreased focus on punishment and a widespread adoption of rehabilitation. The Party believes that it often is the harsh nature of the prison and criminal justice system that all-too-often creates a cycle of crime causing a criminal to never fully escape that way of life. As well, we call for the granting of felons their right to vote after they have served their time, as well as the complete elimination of for-profit private prisons.  Drugs The Democratic Party recognizes the American War on Drugs for what it truly is: one of our greatest failures. We call for the complete abandonment of the War on Drugs, and instead realign our focus on rehabilitation of drug addicts, the decriminalization of illegal narcotics, and the complete legalization and taxation of cannabis.  Civil Rights The Democratic Party believes in the equality of all human beings, regardless of gender, sex, skin color, or sexual orientation. We believe any unnecessary restriction based on these conditions to be an affront to basic decency. As such, it is the party policy that no human being be denied the right to marry whomever it is that they love, regardless of skin color or sex. Marriage is a basic human right, one that must be afforded to gay couples nation-wide through federal legislation.  Environment The Democratic Party affirms the necessity of taking care of the one planet humanity has: Planet Earth. We accept climate change as a scientific fact, and that humanity is its cause. As such, we accept the responsibility of humanity to fix its mess through appropriate legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions, expand green renewable energy while moving away from dirty fossil fuel energy, and to fight climate change to build a lasting future for all future generations.  Homeland Security The Democratic Party believes that while protecting the American homeland is a top priority, we do not believe that it supersedes our fundamental liberties that so many generations of Americans have fought and died for. It is the Party's belief that the National Security Agency must be reigned in. Its phone and Internet data collection programs must immediately cease, and the PATRIOT ACT should be immediately repealed.   Campaign Finance The Democratic Party believes that money is not free speech, and as such the federal and state governments should be entirely allowed to regulate all elections however they see fit. We want to see the overturning of Supreme Court decisions such as Buckley v. Valeo and Citizens United v. FEC, and the institution of solely publicly financed elections to guarantee that all candidates are on a level playing field.  Economics  Budget & Economy The Democratic Party supports the drastic decrease in the amount of money we send to the Pentagon and instead want to see that money forwarded to domestic programs to help the nation's less well-off. As well, we want to couple this Pentagon cut with the increasing of taxes, primarily on the top income brackets and the .1% of Americans who have avoided paying their fair share of taxes for too long.  Business & Workers' Rights The Democratic Party is a firmly capitalist party that supports growth and aiding of small businesses in America, which we recognize as one of the driving forces behind America's success. As well, we recognize the American worker's right to unionization and collective bargaining. The American unions have been squeezed for decades now, and it is the Party's belief that workers and small businesses have been overshadowed by big business on Wall Street for too long. The Democratic Party is for a realignment towards workers' rights expansion and away from Wall Street to Main Street.  Minimum Wage The Democratic Party advocates for the raising of the minimum wage from its current paltry sum of $7.25/h to $10.10/h, and that sum's tying to inflation so that Americans will not have to wait on the unreliable Congress to get the raise they deserve. As well, we support the mandating of equal pay for equal work for women.  Tax Reform The Democratic Party supports the simplification of the tax code to remove the many loopholes that big businesses use to get out of paying taxes to the nation that they owe their existence and wealth to. As well, we support the lowering of the corporate tax rate from its current level of 35% in accordance with the closing of tax loopholes. We also support the repeal of the Bush tax cuts, especially on households making $250,000+ a year.  Earned Benefits & Welfare The Democratic Party believes that our social safety net should be protected at all costs. As well, we also firmly believe in the necessity of its expansion. We do not buy into the belief that social security, medicare, or medicaid must be cut for it to survive. The safety net should be expanded and protected, not dashed to ribbons.  Technology & Infrastructure The Democratic Party holds that for too long, our infrastructure has been neglected. We want to see the rebuilding and expansion of our infrastructure. As well, we believe that access to the Internet is a necessity to succeed in the modern world, and as such it is a human right. As well, we fully support the reclassification of the Internet as a public utility, and the preservation of net neutrality.  Social Issues  Education The Democratic Party believes that education is a fundamental right for all human beings. We believe that public education provided by the government should be universally available and equal in all aspects. Education is the gateway to the American Dream, and it must be supported everywhere. As well, higher education is likewise a fundamental right, and we believe in the institution of tuition-free higher education in America.   Health Care The Democratic Party believes that every human being has a fundamental right to good health. As such, we believe in healthcare being a free, publicly funded service for all Americans. We want to see the expansion of Medicare to cover every American instead of just retirees, with the ability to negotiate medical costs as is done in every other developed nation. As well, we fundamentally believe in the right to paid maternity and paternity leave for all new parents, and the institution of a system to aid new parents financially to help raise their children.  Abortion The Democratic Party believes in the right to have an abortion as laid out in Roe v. Wade. Women have the right to do with their body as they wish, and that women are responsible enough adults to decide what is right for them in their personal lives, even if that includes attaining an abortion.   Religion The Democratic Party believes unequivocally in the 1st Amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion. However, we likewise fully believe in the founders' intention for the United States to be a secular government. We thus reject any attempts to associate the government with any form of religion, and believe in replacing ""In God We Trust"" with ""E Pluribus Unum"" as the national motto.  Foreign Affairs  Interventionism The Democratic Party maintains a diplomacy-first policy to world affairs. We believe that through coalition-building and discussions, we can find a solution to just about any problem. We are against the cowboy-style diplomacy that has gotten us into situations like the Iraq War. While military action may be required sometimes, we believe diplomacy and cooperation should always be Plan A, while military action should be considered a last resort.  Trade The Democratic Party believes in the expansion of trade with other nations. However, we are skeptical of free trade agreements such as NAFTA, TPP, and TTIP. In order to support such agreements, major safeguards for workers and the environment would be a necessity for the Party to support such agreements, though we would prefer no such agreements at all.  Immigration The Democratic Party holds that immigration is the lifeblood of the nation. We want to see the protection and expansion of immigration to the United States. We want to see the passage of the DREAM Act and the creation of a pathway to citizenship, as well as the making of a completely free immigration system."

Almost all come from privileged backgrounds. They have connections that allow them to parlay their talents into success. None of their wealth was created in a vacuum. They had law enforcement and courts to keep people from stealing their products or ideas. They had emergency services to put out fires both figuratively and literally. They had a strong military defense and intelligence as well as diplomatic services to protect their products aboard. They have had an educated labor force to solve their problems and less educated to do their physical labor. They have had consumers who decided to use their products instead of their rivals. They had the benefits of elite educations (both their own and their employees) and research facilities. Most of this is brought to you in part by the U.S. tax system. In fact, almost all of the advantages are due to taxes. Without taxes, we wouldn't have the tech sector since computers and the internet were original military projects. The first was British and then US military funded for Navy submarines, the latter by France and UK and then ARPA (later renamed DARPA) of the U.S. DOD. Oil from Alaska would not be available without the Alcan Highway built by the Army. Wal-Mart and all the other big boxes couldn't import junk without the U.S. Navy scaring pirates. This continues today. Student loans help keep universities afloat, world governments are still the best source of research funds, world military and police still keep people from stealing. Billionaires of tomorrow will take advantage of stable governments especially in places like Russia and India where government can be a wealth builder and remover by themselves.

When one is worth $100 million, risking 10 and losing it makes not appreciable difference in ones life.

Government is a coercive entity designed to subject minorities(all kinds) to the will of those in power through their monopoly on violence. I think every human is a beautiful, free individual, and should live a life free of violence, especially the organized variety. You, rutledge2, are a free, beautiful, independent human being with inalienable rights who owns yourself. As a result, you can do what you want with your own body and own the product of your labor."

Liberal,389hb2,toms_face,2,Wed Jun 3 23:43:26 2015 UTC,"Without a state, how do you expect capitalism to survive?  How will property rights and liberties be upheld which allow capitalism to thrive.  How do you fight against monopolistic behavior or entrenched markets where change is being stifled?  Do you feel bargaining power of labour helps the capitalist system?  This is where libertarianism failed for me and I became a Keynesian liberal. I love the market system and the liberty it provides, but I also feel that schools like ordoliberalism have remediated the problems caused by  neoliberalism and its libertarian inspiration.   In short, I believe markets are energy and need regulation to prevent from irregularities and failures."
Liberal,389hb2,toms_face,0,Wed Jun 3 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"Capitalism is the natural state of life. In the voluntarist system property rights are your natural rights, and violators are subject to opposition and defense. If you're alleging that crony capitalism is the result of a truly free market, I could not disagree more. The bargaining power of people to trade only with the just and fair is the true power to protect capitalism."
Liberal,389hb2,toms_face,2,Wed Jun 3 23:29:33 2015 UTC,"Self preservation is the natural way of life. Whether it's an individual or an institution, the drive is to survive. Capitalism, at least in its non-imperialist forms, has been great at harnessing this motive. It succeeds in respecting the freedoms of the individual and the natural desire to own property towards productive ends.   So do you oppose legislation that prevents cronyism? Such as anti-monopoly law, trust busting, bargaining rights. In short, how does libertarianism address the reality of market failures and preservation of culture in the face of such change?  Do you consider yourself a right-libertarian or a left-libertarian?"
Liberal,389hb2,toms_face,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:39:29 2015 UTC,"I oppose all legislation(with possible exception to violent crime) on the basis that laws can only be enforced with violence or threat of violence. Libertarianism creates a system where there is no government to hand out unfair benefits, as well as promoting a society with a conscious  populace who only trades with organizations that preserve culture(natural and manmade). Additionally, libertarianism more than doubles the resources allocated to the private market, making market failures less common and eliminating true depression, while still experiencing a cyclical market structure.  Neither, my beliefs are simple. I believe in a voluntary system where people have complete control over their bodies and product of their labor, and are free from all kinds of coercion and organized violence.  You reason infinitely better than the vast majority of people, bravo my friend."
Liberal,389hb2,toms_face,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:23:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I appreciate that.   It sounds to me that you're more of anarchist than a libertarian. As I understand, libertarian (at least the American strain) allows for some minarchist state to enforce property rights. The whole idea of a stateless society seems to be impossible - I'd argue the state is an immortal and ever-changing artifact of human existence and interaction. This is a critique I have of both communist and anarcho-capitalist thought - in the absence of power, something else will take its place. For this reason, we need law.   Furthermore, let's say in this stateless society people begin eschewing the idea of property. The property is then at a loss by the implicit threat of a social change. His livelihood and economic freedom are on the line. With no state to enforce his rights, they in practice do not exist.   In terms of handing out benefits - I can at least sympathize there. Obviously corporate welfare is a problem and is leading towards economic inquality.   Also, without a state how do you provide for a common defense as well as advanced military research?"
Liberal,389hb2,The_Great_Grahambino,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:41:05 2015 UTC,"I replied to toms_face on this matter, and in short, I believe in the non-aggression principle and self ownership, both libertarian beliefs, and being a libertarian distinguishes me from anarcho-communists.  In a stateless society, people would obviously not accept an additional coercive structure because they have reaped the benefits of keeping more than twice their previous salary, and the freedom of self ownership.  In a stateless society, you have property rights as well as the right to defend them how you see fit. If someone steals your trashcan, then you are free to do what is needed to keep them from stealing your trashcan.  I have, recently, come to the idea that if ostracizing the violent criminals(including those who deprive others of property) and an extremely well-armed populace for deterrent effect do not work well enough, we could instate a voluntary violent crimes prevention and enforcement organization, with extreme levels of oversight, to only prevent and ""punish"" violent crime. This system is obviously second best to the former, and I suggest that we try the first system, though either method would be a wonderful miracle when compared to our police state.  Glad you asked, common defense is one of the easiest free solutions. Civilians would, with some of their newfound wealth, voluntarily defend the area and form defense collectives with others.The donations to these civilian controlled and heavily publicized defense collectives would also fund military research if need be.  I have a couple of questions for you. 1. Do you know why the Japanese didn't invade the mainland? 2. How can Costa Rica survive without any military force?"
Liberal,389hb2,kilgore_trout87,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"Do you know why the Japanese didn't invade the mainland?   Very well articulated response.   To answer your questions 1. There is substantial room for debate here. Truthfully, I'm not a WW2 buff so I can't articulate a well informed response. I would assume there's several reasons. a. an armed populace b. strategy - what would japan gain by attacked mainland? I suspect that their reasons for Pearl Harbor's attack may have just been provocation rather than a prelude to a national affront.  c. they were over-committed elsewhere.    Costa Rica can maintain that through trade alliances with the US and by laying low. They're an insignificant force in the global economy, and as such, not a threat or advantage to any national power.    Futhermore, a brief scan of their wikipedia page shows they're still fighting poverty.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica#Economy  In short, they're lucky and they're involved in the UN.   How would you answer those questions?"
Liberal,389hb2,kilgore_trout87,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"You too, sir(or madame) are quite articulate in your responses.  The Japanese Admiral Yamamoto refused the idea of invasion of the US because ""there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass"". Civilians throughout time have mounted effective defenses, just as a largely civilian and poorly equipped vietnamese force not only routed the joint forces, but took South Vietnam. This is the case for a voluntary defense collective.  15 countries have no military, with 6 more having no standing army but a military program in place. Most are small and maintain defense treaties, but Costa Rica, with arguably the most vast natural resources for it's area, has no defense plan, and rely only on civilians. They find a way to negotiate without violence, and their constitution prohibits any military force, obviously not an economic move. Keynes favors a strong military, for this ""stimulus"" nonsense."
Liberal,389hb2,kilgore_trout87,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:11:30 2015 UTC,"These are definitely some valid points on civil issues where libertarianism can apply. I certainly share your sentiment on these stances and they are viable, if not preferable. Your libertarianism is also different from the strains I experienced in college, having hallmarks of both left and right.   Some more topics, though. How do you view currency?  This is where I differ from my fellow orthodox economist/economics students - fiat to me seems to be a lie. While a gold-back currency is not the ideal, I'm open to the ideas of currency being backed in something. If you favor currency existing, how do regulate money supply and prevent debauchery?  In the absence of welfare provided by the state, how do you produce non-market assistance and allocation? I'm assuming in a similar fashion as consumer protection - but do you feel there needs to be some legal framework?"
Liberal,389hb2,kilgore_trout87,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"Indeed, any left-right-nonsense-libertarian isn't really a libertarian, at best they are a freedom minded conservative or liberal.  Fiat is a blatant lie, especially when your currency is ""backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government"". It does not make sense to trust the credit of a lying government, especially one with 18 trillion and counting in debt. I favor currency existing(or at least nothing stopping it), the ideal is a currency without inflation like bitcoin, but also a currency with material value like the gold standard. I would choose a currency with no inflation and tied to as many things as possible. A currency could easily be backed in every steady commodity(especially salt) so that it would be resistant to price changes with the fluctuation of commodities. As far as how you regulate it, like my other proposals for preventing crony capitalism, you use conscious capitalism with a population that only utilizes currency with no inflationary or other ridiculous control schemes. Also, barter is great, but currency is just a facilitator for trade, so steady and open currency is just as ideal.  I'm not clear on what you mean by welfare and consumer protection, but I assume you mean how do we aid the needy and protect the public. Consumer protection agencies and organizations that utilize open source information and reveal their information would function more effectively than corrupt and over-lobbied government. Welfare or aid or whatever you want to call it is obviously a private matter - Why should society be forced at gunpoint to help those they don't deem to need it? So in the my/the libertarian model, charities and NGOs and collectives will help whoever people are willing to help. There will be no shortage of aid because of the 50+% more money the average person has."

The libertarian party is dulled down to try to gain mainstream acceptance, and while that's all well and good, some of us stand to the precepts of self ownership and nonviolence."
Liberal,389hb2,kilgore_trout87,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:52:21 2015 UTC,"""true libertarian"" basically reveals which kind of libertarian you are.  There are three types, the first one is more for socioeconomic like Gary Johnson who are economically more centrist than anything anarchist and would happily use the force of government to tax marijuana and gay marriages.  Then there's the libertarianism that conservatives are now calling themselves because it's not popular to be a conservative nowadays. The ones that use economic arguments outside of the mainstream economics to basically justify supply-side (""trickle down"") economics.  Then there's you, the tax is theft, arrests are kidnapping libertarian, uploading YouTube videos of ""AM I BEING DETAINED OFFICER"" and attack the legitimacy of the state with words like ""no social contract"" and ""tyranny of the majority"". Typically associated with people calling themselves ""voluntaryist"" or ""anarcho-capitalist"". They like to make up words.

You can say it's immoral though, or something else that isn't defined legally, just not theft. I'm not going to respond to arguments that are trying to say that tax is still theft."

Liberal,37ne6h,johnmountain,1 point,Thu May 28 22:28:37 2015 UTC,"But that's the fundamental problem with free trade generally,  Free trade agreements are necessarily pro-corporate and I am not convinced that can be fixed.  Actually I am convinced it can't be.  Let's start with a couple basic observations, that the corporate economy depends on a ready work force and this means a population dispossessed to the point where they cannot pursue business opportunities themselves.  Let's also note that in the developed world they have largely succeeded but because of the concentration of wealth generally they can pay lower wages in a country like, say, Indonesia or Bangladesh.  Those countries are poor on paper also because they do not have corporate economies and therefore it is very hard to measure economic activity across the country (65% of Indonesians and 85% of Bangladeshis are self-employed).  I don't know how Bangladesh does it, but Indonesia has policies to discourage employment   Among other things corporations pay income taxes but the self-employed do not, and corporations are required to pay a statutory bonus (this is common in Ecuador too).  In this way, there is always room for the self-employed, and formal employment subsidizes self-employment and turns employees into investors in family members' businesses via the statutory system.  Now obviously in an economy like this, child labor is also a very different thing,  I assume we can all agree that generally there is a difference between a child working and learning a business he or she will take over later and working for a corporation for a paycheck and a bonus, but also where the former is normal it is harder to discourage the latter, so you have kids working in factories in Bangladesh.  So what do you do about it?  You can simply leave it up to the countries, in which case corporations will relocate to where they have to pay less.  Or, far worse, you can require signatories to agree on minimal wage conditions, child labor bans, and the like.  The problem is that once you go that route, and treat employment as normal, then you force the same corporate model that has caused so much poverty in the US on every other country in the agreement.  The right approach should be import duties, but those are ruled out by the agreement in the first place.  In my four years in Indonesia, I came to conclude there was no significant food insecurity and no homelessness as we think of it.  Poverty is on display there while carefully hidden in the US, but the poor have better nutrition and greater security in the necessities of life than in the US because the country does better regarding equality of productive property than we do in the US by a long shot.  TPP or any other trade agreement would almost certainly work to destroy that dispossessing masses and turning a mild form of poverty into abject destitution."

Liberal,37m21k,A_Google_User,2,Fri May 29 04:20:31 2015 UTC,"Didn't the right cause the great depression?   I think this may be debatable, but we would nonetheless probably be on the same side of that debate.  Of course, I'm assuming what you're actually getting at is whether the right was around before the Great Depression, and you would be correct. I didn't mean to suggest that they weren't; Despite being a modern concept, the right if not Rightism has always existed in its basic form. It is, at its core, hierarchic authoritarianism - a term which accurately describes most civilizations since the dawn of man.  But my point was about the disposition of the direction of the shifting paradigm. America may have been, from our perspective, relatively Rightist before and during the 30s, but until then, we were becoming steadily less so. Around that time, including during the New Deal, the pendulum had swung as far as it would to the left, and even if it hadn't stopped and began to return to the right, by then the right was laying plans to exploit human suffering in a new way that would prove to be successful, if only for a generation or two. It's my opinion that by the late 80s, in many regards, we were more Rightist than before the Great Depression thanks to their efforts.  Thankfully about that time, (I like to think because of the dawn of the information age,) the swinging pendulum began to stall once again, and aside from the brief resurgence after 9/11, has started returning rapidly to the left.   ...conservatism was all but dead in America until Barry Goldwater & co came along and figured out how to reverse our trajectory.   Conservatism, maybe, but I don't think Conservatism should be confused with Rightism.  Wouldn't you agree that especially the Goldwater Conservatives are fairly liberal, if not extremely naive, being concerned with the misguided notion that it's best to limit the power of government over the individual?  I would also argue that McCarthyism and the Red Scare beginning around 1950 demonstrates America's Rightism well before Goldwater's time.  But I guess I'd have to admit I don't know as much about Goldwater as I'd like to, and I'm not familiar with Rick Perlstein. Tell me more?"
Liberal,37m21k,spookyjohnathan,2,Fri May 29 05:18:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, very interesting stuff to consider.  A real quick sell on Perlstein:   He has three books (Before the Storm, Nixonland and The Invisible Bridge) where he outlines the nation's shift politically through the major figures Goldwater-Nixon-Reagan, and relates these changes to today's political climate.  They are enjoyable reads, interlaced with humor and little-known history bits. I'd say his narrative is suspiciously neat, but it never feels outlandish or forced. If you had to pick only one I'd say read Nixonland."
Liberal,37m21k,A_Google_User,1 point,Fri May 29 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"It wasn't the cons that pulled this off, in spite of repeated and persistent efforts to do so. What happened was in the 1970s the Bowley ratio, the ratio between capital and labor returns, hit historical lows for capital. This produced a supply constrained economy with high inflation or stagflation. The pull back on demand side policies was necessary, though the radical degree it's taken to today has created the opposite problem.   Economics created the shift, just as economics will push us back to the left as the economy becomes progressively demand constrained though lack of wages relative to cost. The opposite of a supply constrained economy in which the world has a large overproduction relative to demand. This induces deflationary pressures that even the monetary easing the Fed engages in to induce a 2% inflation target fails to hit its target.  Funny thing is that the Fed fears NAIRU due to its inflationary potential. Yet rather than use it to hit a 2% inflationary target it engages in monetary easing instead, which is a supply side strategy exacerbating the problem.   My long time prediction for many years of a political reversal to the left, on par with the shift to the right with Reagan in 1980, to occur in 2020 still stands. It'll create a massive economic boom."

Liberal,37j52r,super_ag,3,Thu May 28 02:26:20 2015 UTC,"The irony is you're using the same tactic to ""prove"" the opposite phenomena. You (rightfully) criticize people who say the New England blizzard last year is evidence global warming is fake, but then give a tacit nod of agreement to someone who says heavy rains in Texas prove global warming is real.   Why is it valid for one side to point to local weather phenomena as proof of their argument while it is invalid for the other side to point to other local weather phenomena as proof of their argument?  There is a distinct hypocrisy of the Left in this regards. They can point to floods, droughts, blizzards, hurricanes, tornadoes, heat waves, arctic vortices and earthquakes as proof of global warming, but the instant someone from the right does it, they don't understand science and are wrongly using local events to debunk a global phenomena."
Liberal,37j52r,EddieMcDowall,0,Fri May 29 04:39:48 2015 UTC,"Because the climate change deniers point to single events as 'proof' single events are 'weather'. Those who point to the increasing rate of severe events are not pointing to single events but the increased rate and severity of these events, that is climate (as opposed to weather) and is evidence of climate change."
Liberal,37j52r,super_ag,2,Fri May 29 04:49:36 2015 UTC,"So how is Nye's statement that the floods in Texas are due to Global Warming equivalent to pointing out an increase in ""extreme"" weather events? Nye didn't cite an increase in rate of torrential rains. He pointed to a single weather phenomenon and said, ""See! Global Warming did this.""  But somehow being critical of Nye's very unscientific tweet makes us out to be the assholes who are ""in a rage"", and people like you continue to defend him.  And just to address the other response you gave to one of my other comments in this thread, can you show me that there is an actual increase in severe weather events globally? You have made the claim that climatologists are demonstrating that severe events are becoming more frequent, so I'm wondering if you have a source that backs this claim up."
Liberal,37j52r,EddieMcDowall,1 point,Fri May 29 05:16:12 2015 UTC,Actually he didn't.

Liberal,37j52r,super_ag,2,Fri May 29 12:54:44 2015 UTC,"How convenient. Every weather phenomena supports your position and you can use it to further your agenda, but that exact same phenomena is off limits to the other side because ""they don't understand science."" That's quite the amazing golden goose you have there.  But of course what you mean when you say ""Global Climate Change,"" you're not necessarily referring to measurable surface temperatures. I think we can all agree on temperature measurements (that haven't been ""adjusted""). What you typically mean by ""Climate Change"" is a catastrophic vision of the future where weather events get more and more extreme. But you've left the scientific observation realm and have now ventured into speculation and conjecture. But you talk about them as if they're the same. You say, ""The Earth is getting warmer. That is scientific fact. So if we don't act now, we're all going to be roasting in our own juices by the end of the century. The debate is settled. We have a consensus.""   What you've done there is a bit of bait and switch. You use measurable science now to say, ""You cannot deny this"" and then substitute it with speculations and predictions on what will happen in the future and continue to claim ""The science is settled.""   That's what Nye was doing with his tweet. He's not saying, ""This rain is caused by an ever-changing and dynamic climate that has varied for eons."" He's saying, ""You see this bad thing happening? We did that! And more of it will happen in the future unless we take drastic action now."" If he's not saying that, it's the equivalent of a Neanderthal saying, ""Turok, it snow today.

Liberal,37j52r,super_ag,2,Fri May 29 22:24:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying that the Earth is experiencing warming, nor am I saying that CO2 emissions aren't contributing to it. What I deny, and what is not covered in the 90%+ consensus is the catastrophic predictions made by the Left. And here's why I'm skeptical.  In the now debunked Newsweek article ""A Cooling World"" the author used scientific measurements as a pretext to paint a bleak future where famines will kill millions (because of a new Ice Age) and used the same exact rhetoric you see the Left now use when talking about the exact opposite thing. Does this sound familiar?:   There are ominous signs that the Earth’s weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production – with serious political implications for just about every nation on Earth. . .The evidence in support of these predictions has now begun to accumulate so massively that meteorologists are hard-pressed to keep up with it. . .During the same time, the average temperature around the equator has risen by a fraction of a degree – a fraction that in some areas can mean drought and desolation. . .To scientists, these seemingly disparate incidents represent the advance signs of fundamental changes in the world’s weather. . .But they are almost unanimous in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century. If the climatic change is as profound as some of the pessimists fear, the resulting famines could be catastrophic. . .Climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climatic change, or even to allay its effects. . .But the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic projections of future food supplies. The longer the planners delay, the more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the results become grim reality.   So were the scientists who observed a slight decrease in global temperatures wrong? No. But the conclusions drawn from such observations are diametrically opposed to the current narrative but the tone is identical. It's this Chicken Little tone and catastrophic predictions that I would say are still up for debate. Notice that the author used scientific consensus to support his agenda as well. It's ""A dash of science and then massive amounts of rampant speculation. If you disagree, you deny science."""
Liberal,37j52r,barelyonhere,0,Fri May 29 22:34:45 2015 UTC,"The point where people that deny scientific discovery fail is their unwillingness to accept that science will be wrong. Scientists will get something wrong a hundred times before getting it right. We can't guarantee that is is 100% accurate every time something new is ""discovered."" That being said, it is generally the correct direction the science community needs to proceed. So we can't assume that because they've gotten it wrong before that it is wrong now. Climate change is real. This is the consensus. The exact difficulties experienced around the world may not be perfectly predicted, but that doesn't equate to bad science entirely. It is simply a deviation from the expected and reason to revisit the initial hypothesis and see where the incorrect data or experiment occurred."

I have no problem with citing actual measurements around the world and even pointing out global changes we can measure.  That is not what Nye did. He said, ""Look, it's raining a lot in Texas. Global warming is to blame."" And he gets a tacit nod of agreement and even is defended by people on the Left. Yet if someone says, ""Hey, it was extremely cold in New England last December. Global warming is a hoax,"" you same people criticize him. They are doing the exact same thing, but you criticize the guy you don't like and defend the one you do.   And it's always negative weather phenomena that people like Nye cite as results of global warming. They never say, ""In Texas, we had a remarkable mild winter this year, which allowed farmers to continue to produce crops well into November, resulting more food for Americans to enjoy."" Nope, all the good weather phenomena we experience are just Mother Nature doing it's thing. But should something bad happen, ""That's Global Warming!!!! Oh my God, we're all going to die!!!""

This is where I diverge from Global Warming activists. I don't deny that the world is getting warmer. Nor do I deny that CO2 emissions are contributing to the warming. What I don't buy is that it will always (or at least overwhelmingly) be negative.   In the now debunked ""A Cooling World"" article in Newsweek, the author used the same alarmist rhetoric you hear now regarding Global Warming. ""Crops will fail, billions will die, human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria! (my paraphrase)"" Just reread that article, not for it's science but for its tone and alarmism. I see no difference between that then and what people are saying now about Global Warming. Is it not possible that warmer global temperatures could have net positive impacts on humanity and the environment?

In actuality, there has been virtually no warming according to satellite temperature measurements.  In 2012, Peter Wadhams, head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group at University of Cambridge, predicted that the Arctic Circle would be come ice free by 2020 and maybe as early as 2015. Yet government data show that arctic sea ice has increased since then.  Michael Oppenheimer - ""[By] 1995, the greenhouse effect would be desolating the heartlands of North America and Eurasia with horrific drought, causing crop failures and food riots…[By 1996] The Platte River of Nebraska would be dry, while a continent-wide black blizzard of prairie topsoil will stop traffic on interstates, strip paint from houses and shut down computers.""  Srgjan Kerim, President of the UN General Assembly, predicted ""50 million climate refugees will be produced by climate change by the year 2010.

No  ""According to these models, there will be no sea ice left in the summer in the Arctic Ocean somewhere between 2010 and 2015. And it’s probably going to happen even faster than that,” Professor Louis Fortier - Université Laval, Director ArcticNet - November 16, 2007.  Whether it's warnings of rising oceans, ice free poles, famines, etc, there are lists of failed predictions made by climate alarmists, who were ""the best experts on the subject.""

Also, they use those same computer models to run predictions, i.e. set them up with data from 100 or 200 years ago and run them to today, and guess what? They get it remarkably close to what we see. The computer models have been making predictions that have been coming true for decades and as the science advances the accuracy only increases and they all say it's going to be bad for humanity. Of course you're free to ignore it, (as I'm sure you will), but the wonderful thing about science is it remains true whether you believe it or not."

There's a drought, it's global warming. There's a flood, it's global warming. There's a blizzard, it's global warming. There's an unseasonably warm winter, it's global warming. There's an unseasonably cool summer, it's global warming. There are hurricanes, it's global warming. There are few hurricanes, it's global warming. There are tornadoes, it's global warming. It's hot in an area, it's global warming. It's cold in an area, it's global warming. There's an earthquake, it's global warming.  But then whenever someone has the audacity to say, ""It's unseasonably cold in New England right now,"" the immediate response is, ""That's weather, you idiot, not climate. Weather is local and climate is global. It's not called local climate change."" Which is true, weather is not climate. But those same people are not at all critical of those, like Nye, who use local weather phenomena to support their claim.  You guys sure are inconsistent when criticizing people who use weather as proof/disproof of global warming.

Bill said this is an example of climate change, and he's right. The climate IS changing. The change is, in part, affected by the INCREASE in global temperature. There are other factors, like ocean current changes due to temperature and salinity changes (from the melting polar ice), which helps to change jet stream patterns, which changes how the lower air column moves, which affects the types and intensities of the storms we are experiencing.   Climate is a SYSTEM, made of many parts.   The real problem with trolls like you is that you couch your BS as wanting to have a civilized debate when you want nothing of the sort.

Sure, no debate there.   Bill said this is an example of climate change, and he's right. The climate IS changing. The change is, in part, affected by the INCREASE in global temperature.    Still no debate there, but for to what extent is anthropogenic carbon emissions contributing to that warming. I would say that is up for debate. Your side wants to say that the debate is over and that CO2 is the primary driver of the warming we have experienced and that we must take drastic action now before it's too late. That is where you diverge from measurable metric to speculation. And that's where we disagree.  When the Left says ""climate change,"" they don't mean the observable change in climate that we can measure. After all, the climate has always and will always continue change. What they are referring to is their predictions of the future of what the climate will change into. That, again, leaves the realm of scientific measurement and goes into speculation. And it's essentially what the Left and Right are debating, by in large. When Obama says that climate change is the greatest threat to our national security, he's not talking about today's global temperatures and how they're affecting things right now. He's talking about some catastrophic future that must be stopped at all costs.   When Bill Nye says, ""See these floods in Texas? That's climate change."" He's not saying that natural variations in the Earth's climate can produce a vast array of weather phenomena. I mean, what's the point in someone saying, ""Do you see this natural occurrence that has happened throughout the millennia? That's part of the ever changing climate that has occurred for eons""? He's essentially saying, ""These floods would have not happened if we didn't burn so many fossil fuels and put so much CO2 in the atmosphere."" If he's not making some conclusion like that, it's as useful as two Neanderthals saying, ""Turok, it snow today. Is because climate changing."" Sure, it's accurate, but what's the point of saying it?   There is NO (reputable) DEBATE as to the large issues.   By large issues, if you mean current temperatures and measurements, no. If you mean, the catastrophic predictions made that predict millions of ""environmental refugees"" by 2015 (which didn't happen) or an ice-free Arctic circle by 2015 (which didn't happen) or snow-less Europe by 2015 (which didn't happen), I'd say there is plenty of room for debate.   The discussions we SHOULD be having at this point (since we missed our chance for the 'slow/stop' talks) is how to adapt and prepare for the changes to mitigate loss.   You see, even you are not talking about current measurements and observations. You automatically assume that the current trend in climatic change is going to be bad and we must ""mitigate the loss."" It's why it's only bad weather phenomena that Leftists point out as caused by global warming. ""See that flood? It's GW. See that drought? It's GW. See that hurricane? It's GW."" You never hear, ""Did you see that unseasonably mild early winter we had that allowed farmers to continue to grow crops well into November and provided more food for the economy last year? That's global warming.""

I sometimes open carry (legal in my state), I have a concealed handgun permit (but believe that constitutional carry would be ideal), I reject the idea of background checks at gun shows, I've bought and sold guns in private sales.    This seems to be your big sticking point.  Gun control.  Does this one issue really outweigh all the other issues?  Additionally, how much have you looked into gun control proposals?  I've found a lot of gun people have no idea how gun laws work in other states that have tighter restrictions.  Honestly, a lot of restrictions are made out to be far more burdensome then they really are if you are hearing about them from the pro-gun side.  Also, not every democrat is in favor of gun control.     I'd suggest you do what you did with all of the other issues you've changed your mind on: look into what actual gun control organizations have to say about what they want.  The opposition doesn't always accurately represent what the other side wants to do.    I'll tell you, personally I have a fairly nuanced position on gun control.  I have worked with mentally ill people and I can honestly tell you, not everyone who wants a gun should have one.  At the same time, I would never be in favor of a blanket ban on even just semi-automatics.  My state has some regulations I think are fantastic, and others I think are absolutely fucking ridiculous.  As for abortion, there are kids going to bed hungry every night in this country.  Kids who won't have a chance to get a decent education.  Kids who are homeless and living in tents or out of cars with their family.  Where I come from we take care of what we have before we go looking for more.  Once all of those kids are clothed, fed, educated, and housed I will listen to any argument on abortion someone wants to make.  Until then, I will not be party to forcing someone to bring a life into this world they can't provide for.  edit; left out a ""do what you"" before a did."
Liberal,37jhs8,Homerpaintbucket,1 point,Thu May 28 03:27:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to address my primary sticking points. With the issue of gun control, I agree with you that mentally ill people shouldn't have guns. The issue boils down to how to determine who is mentally ill, and the procedures required to deprive someone of one of their constitutional rights. In my state, you are not allowed to own a firearm if you have been declared unfit by a court, or have been involuntarily committed. I believe this is appropriate. Some proponents of gun control would make someone pass a mental health exam. I believe this is an overreach. I have heard of some veterans (I'm a vet) who have had their firearms taken as a result of seeking counseling for PTSD. I think that this 1. discourages people from seeking help and 2. violates due process.  I also think that laws requiring all firearms to be stored w/o ammo, individually trigger locked, and in a safe defeats the primary purpose of having a firearm. At the same time, as a father, common sense says don't leave guns where kids can get ahold of them (but I don't need a law telling me that. How would you even enforce such a thing?)  I look forward to hearing some of your positions, and thanks again for being able to have a civil conversation on such a controversial topic. :)"
Liberal,37jhs8,Homerpaintbucket,2,Thu May 28 03:40:45 2015 UTC,"In my state, you are not allowed to own a firearm if you have been declared unfit by a court, or have been involuntarily committed.   I believe this is a federal law.  I agree that this appropriate.  The problem is, both of those things are very rare.  It's very difficult to involuntarily commit someone nowadays and generally requires a judge to commit them.  We moved towards a ""community based"" mental health care approach in this country about 20 to 25 years ago which made some of the language in some of our gun laws obsolete, essentially.    As for vets with PTSD;  This is a big problem currently.  The suicide rate for combat vets is sky high.  Guns make suicide much easier.  I would not be a fan of permanently removing a vet's rights (especially as the most responsible gun owners I know are vets), but they definitely shouldn't have access to them for a time.  I've heard that the precision and concentration involved in target shooting have helped some, which is fantastic, but there is also great potential for negative consequences.  I think that we need to adjust the laws to reflect the fact that some people's mental health conditions change throughout their lives.  Some people will be crazy for life, some will go through a rough spot.  We need to make it so both the full blown lifetimes and people in rough spots can't harm themselves or others, but figure out a way to not permanently remove the rights of the people who were in a rough patch.  If we could do that it would probably help to not discourage people from getting help when they need it.  As for the trigger lock and ammo storage laws, those are generally only enforced when an accidental shooting occurs.  Basically, it's a way to take guns out of the hands of people who proved themselves to be irresponsible gun owners.    One of my biggest problems with gun laws at the federal level currently is who is allowed and not allowed to buy guns.  Currently non-violent drug offenders lose the right to purchase a firearm.  So that means some kid gets caught with a joint at a Phish show when they're 18 they will permanently lose a Constitutional right.  Meanwhile, people on terrorist watch lists are allowed to buy weapons.  That's fucking ridiculous.  Also, currently gun manufacturers are shielded by law from lawsuits.  I believe this extends to lawsuits stemming from malfunctioning weapons and poor design.  Seems pretty unfriendly to the gun owning population to allow companies to knowingly sell dangerously defective products and allow the public no legal recourse.  But again, not every democrat would agree with me.  You'll find a lot more debate on this than most other subjects on the left, and you find a fair amount of debate on the left.  From what I've noticed, most democrats don't agree with everything the party is doing, they just agree with most of it.    By the way sorry if this is a bit rambly.

Now I'm a proud Democrat/liberal.   First off, the Left has been characterized as gun grabbers. That's simply not true. Many on the left just want common sense gun reforms that should be agreeable to most people. Example: the ban of fully automatic weapons, and background checks.  This isn't a gun grab-quite the contrary. And there are liberal people who have several guns for hunting OR protection, and don't favor theses ideas. You don't have to agree with everything the Democrats, or liberals on the whole say to be a liberal.   On Abortion: We do not LIKE abortion. We are NOT pro-abortion. We are pro-CHOICE. We want to give women reproductive rights, and that includes the right to access LEGAL and SAFE abortions. Personally, I think a ban on late-term abortions should be put in place, but otherwise, I believe as SCOTUS ruled in 1973, that women should have the right to terminate a pregnancy. Again, there are liberals who are not pro-choice, and that's fine. I happen to disagree, and think like President Clinton did: abortions should be safe, legal, and rare. Liberals strive for a day where people will face economic equality and therefore won't feel the need to have abortions anymore. Again, look at the common ground: maybe you can agree with us on allowing termination of pregnancies on rape, incest, mother's life in danger, etc. Several republicans feel that even those shouldn't be reasons for abortions. And if abortions are completely outlawed, women who wish to terminate their pregnancies will find other ways to do so-and they will be totally unsafe.   To be a liberal you don't have to agree on EVERYTHING. You say you're a Republican (or were), but you disagree with them on marriage and economic/domestic policies. My friend, I think you already ARE a liberal now. You desire economic equality, the abolishment of the death penalty, raising the minimum wage, the ACA (and hopefully on universal health care), public education reforms, entitlements, etc. You're basically there, you just disagree on one or two issues-are those enough to keep you voting for Republicans who would rather you be uninsured than to keep ACA? Or who want to abolish the minimum wage? Or keep student loan rates sky high? Or stop marriage equality? I think you're already with us!"

I already feel that abortions in those cases are ok, my hangup is with women who use abortions as a method of birth control. It just doesn't ""feel"" right. Again, it's head vs heart.  As far as gun control is concerned, I'm ok with background checks from licensed dealers (the status quo), and in my state, you can sell firearms in private sales without a background check. I've done it, and I ensure that the person isn't prohibited by verifying their voter registration (proves not a felon, unless they have had their rights restored). I don't believe in the ""gun show loophole."" And fully automatic weapons aren't typically used in crimes, since they are both expensive (I can't afford one), and require a VERY intense background check to purchase (including the chief law enforcement officer signoff, and a six month wait period due to the time it takes to do the background check.)   I've looked at how Bernie Sanders has voted on gun control, and I suppose he is more moderate than most democrats.  I like your argument that you don't have to agree on everything to be a liberal. I think I've been trying to fit neatly into a single category, when in reality it is more of a spectrum. I took the quiz someone suggested, and I'm a centrist, left leaning. I can live with that. I'm going to vote for Bernie Sanders in the primaries, and hope he get's the nomination. I wouldn't vote for Hillary if she was the last candidate though (but for reasons other than policy).  Thanks for your well reasoned response!"

And he has his heart in the right place, which is more than you can say right now than probably anyone else running.

Liberal,37jyl2,ConspiracyFox,1 point,Thu May 28 04:20:33 2015 UTC,"I think you're oversimplifying and over generalizing things a bit to suggest that as a group ""liberals are anti-capitalists"" or ""liberals are for mass immigration"".   Be that as it may, I consider myself a liberal, and I would say that while I do not believe that capitalism as an economic system, is inherently evil or wrong, it is far from perfect, and is ultimately prone to the same pitfalls and problems that every other economic model is vulnerable to- specifically, that wealth and economic power begets more wealth and economic power, that the wealthy have little incentive to help the poor and disadvantaged, that the ultimate outcome of such a system, left unchecked, is a huge disparity between a small but extremely wealthy and powerful few, and the vast majority of disenfranchised poor, which is precisely what we are seeing in capitalist societies globally, today.   As for immigration; again speaking as a self-proclaimed liberal, I believe that this country was founded on the principles of liberty and equality, that immigrants create diversity and community in this country, that we are a stronger and richer society with the inclusion and melding of many cultures and viewpoints, that there  is a place here for those who bring their ideas, talents, skills, traditions, and desires for prosperity and work to our shores, and that undocumented workers should have a clear and viable path to citizenship in this country.   I do not advocate porous or open borders, and maintain that the right to come to this country to live, work, and become a citizen is a right which should be earned, not a privilege to be universally granted without requirement or restriction.   But for those seeking opportunity,  freedom, and economic justice, who are willing and able to bring their skills and commit to doing the hard work, should have an opportunity to make their case and be heard."
Liberal,37jyl2,CylonSpring,1 point,Thu May 28 06:17:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment. Very well written - Almost comes across as a political speech, but I would like to unpack it a bit and discuss it further.    I think you're oversimplifying and over generalizing things a bit to suggest that as a group ""liberals are anti-capitalists"" or ""liberals are for mass immigration"".   You are right, I am generalizing here. Obviously as with any political group, individuals hold differing opinions.    that immigrants create diversity and community in this country   Could you elaborate on this some more? It is my understanding (and anecdotal experience) that importing large numbers of foreigners into a community divides and weakens it. Immigrants do not assimilate to the host society, but instead create conclaves of their own cultures within the host society (e.g China town, Muslim dominated areas, etc).    inclusion and melding of many cultures and viewpoints   Is this really what happens though? Cultures and viewpoints don't really ""meld"",  especially if the cultures hold fundamentally opposing values..  The way you write this seems to imply a kind of completely equal merging of cultures, which respects each culture and allows both cultures to propagate.   In reality, one culture becomes dominant over the other, and the ""losing"" culture is assimilated into the ""winning"" culture. Keep in mind I am speaking in terms of decades here rather than what is immediately visible in the short term.  Also, if diversity of culture is the aim - then shouldn't we be isolating and protecting different cultures so that they can continue to exist? Will merging every culture together into a kind of mega-culture result in the uniqueness of these cultures being lost?    Also Do you believe that all cultures are equal? Many fairly liberal intellectuals (For example, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris) Argue that some cultures are objectively better and worse than others - for example in the way they treat women, and thus appeasing these other cultures and wanting to merge them with our own will result in backwards progress.   Regardless -  I am not convinced that the idealism of ""Diversity"", justifies the reality of economic hardship caused by mass immigration."
Liberal,37jyl2,CylonSpring,1 point,Thu May 28 06:41:07 2015 UTC,"Let me respond to your comments. I suppose I should tell you that I did read your initial post with some amusement- it seemed to me that you were really generalizing/broadly categorizing ""liberals"", and inferring specific political motivations, while at the same time, asking potential responders not to do the same thing to you (refrain from implying that you are a conservative, etc. ).   Be that as it may, for my part, it does not matter to me about anyone's specific political leanings, since I do not feel the need to categorize or infer a motivation or agenda based on that; I try to deal just with the specific statements made and respond to those.   I would like to add that I for one appreciate opportunities to have civilized discourse about such topics, and even though I imagine that we hold differing opinions on this subject, it is not my intention to try to persuade or change anyone's mind about anything- but the actual conversation, even a spirited discussion, held respectfully, is, I believe, important, so thank you.   Now as to the specifics:   I do believe that immigrants do add to the diversity of our society and that they are for the most part an important factor in encouraging the generation and synthesis of new ideas and viewpoints, fostering a sense of belonging and cultural identity, and challenging the status quo- all of which to me seem to be a benefit.   It is true, as you point out, that immigrants tend to interact socially within their own communities primarily, and as such, can be resistant to pressures of conformity and assimilation. It is also true that interactions between such communities and with society at large can be fraught with potential opportunities for friction and misunderstanding. It is not always easy, and it does not always work. We have much work to do in this country to improve our relations with one another, and there will need to be many, many more discussions about those things which still can divide us- about race and gender, about ethnicity and the need for identity and belonging, about respect for the values of culture and tradition and the desire and need to preserve those ideas which are most sacred to us, while at the same time expanding beyond these things to embrace new ways of relating to, and engendering respect for, one another.   This country is a grand and magnificent social experiment; a microcosm of our global community, and as such, there are opportunities for exposure to a great variety of diverse cultural influences and exchanges, particularly in urban environments.   The very necessity of living in such close proximity with each other demands new ways to interact and relate, and while there are examples of drama and conflict in some of these exchanges, in many other cases ( I would argue in the vast majority of such interactions), there can be learnings, increased tolerance for different ideas, faiths, traditions, and conventions, built on the foundation of mutual respect and appreciation of our differences as well as our many similarities.   Blanketed as we are in our constitutional protections, we have the unique opportunity to relate not only as Arab Americans, Jewish Americans, Black or Asian or Hispanic Americans, but as AMERICANS, with strengths and collective identities which are inclusive rather than divisive; where we can take strength and pride not only in our cultural identities and ancestral past, but also in shared visions of a better collective future, with greater opportunities for our children and all who might come after us.   I am under no illusions that all of this is automatic, easy, or inevitable.  It is none of those things. The great social experiment is still young, unproven over the long haul, and very much a work in progress.   What I do believe is that it is worth conducting, and that many great things are potentially achievable within this framework. To find out, we must risk much- we must shake off our fears of our differences, and embrace the difficult road that lies before us- together. For better or worse, we human beings are stuck with each other, and we must find the strength and will to overcome our destructive and sometimes xenophobic tendencies, or else go out in a final gasp of technological self-destruction.   ""Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"" the great Iron Lady at the edge of our shore admonishes us. Turning away now from that counsel is not the way forward. Isolation is not the answer. The world is shrinking. How we choose to handle the realities of those changes is up to us."

One of my Republican questions is whether or not Walker can get some big money behind him. I think he is weak but I would not bet on it. But without some serious money he folds to Jeb. I think they stay at 4-6 serious candidate until after Super Tuesday. But it is likely either done or down to 2 after that. It is a fast calendar, 1 month from Iowa to Super Tuesday. You need the money up front for this.  As for Sanders he can easily ride with 20% or so through the primaries. As long as Warren does not enter, and she won't, he will get all of the left wing votes. Someone else might get other anti-Hillary votes depending. But it is hard to go after the mainstream space without money. I suspect that the issue will be does Sanders stay at below 20% or does he rise above 30%. If he gets 30% in serious places he gets a voice at the convention."

Liberal,376510,kilgore_trout87,0,Mon May 25 23:43:02 2015 UTC,"There;s a branch of conservatives, particularly within social conservatism, which sees the family not only as the basis for society but as the basis for the economy and community as well.  These are the anti-capitalist conservatives (and yes, they exist).  But they don't tend to be faithful to the Republican Party for relatively obvious reasons.  Some may see the Republican Party as a lesser evil, some are not sure.  The problem with Walmart is it sucks money from communities and hence families.  This leads people who see family and local community as the basis of society to be principally opposed to big business and central government both.  In fact I would say there is probably no more radical movement against the injustices of the modern world than anti-capitalist conservatism in the tradition of folks like Belloc, Chesterton, Gandhi, and Sukarno, and carried forth today by people like Philip Blond and John Medaille."

Liberal,376510,kilgore_trout87,1 point,Tue May 26 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"What are your platforms? Anti birth control and coherent thought?   I am glad you asked....  The platform would be localist, communitarian, and de-centralist.  In other words, the problem with the Left is that it vests all social power with the central government and therefore tries to erode all mediating institutions, but the central government is in turn dependent on an income tax that only corporations can facilitate in collecting (W2 and 1099 forms).  It is also conservative in the sense of looking to the past with an eye towards positive models we can use as a template going forward.  The problem with the Republican Party btw is that they are Conservative but what they are conserving is old-school Liberalism (the sort hat existed in, say, the 1920's).  There are a few principles that guide these thinkers (really starting with Chesterton and Belloc in the very early 1900's), namely that Capitalism dispossesses the masses and necessarily depends on keeping people without productive property and therefore is fundamentally unjust.  You can't make Capitalism just by throwing labor unions at it.  You have to go after the source and recapitalize the poor.  What this means is regulating against scale, trying to ensure that poor people have both means and resources to start their own businesses, and supporting cross-generational family businesses as the alternative to a corporations as the centerpiece of the economy. Where family businesses are impractical, worker cooperatives are the next best thing.  In other areas, we mostly push for localization but this has economic implications as well.  With more local variety of laws, it makes it harder for big business to out-compete small businesses, but it also vests communities with primary responsibility over things like welfare programs.  This, btw is how most Scandinavian countries implement socialism.  Sufficiently localist socialism is conservative.  But beyond Scandinavia, you also see Indonesia largely giving preference to family businesses over corporations and making it very hard to hire people (thus creating more opportunities for self-employment).  In terms of functional poverty (lack of access to necessities including food, water, shelter, and the ability to go into business), Indonesia does far better than the US does.  But you are right about the fact that we are a minority and a small one.  The US is liberal through its core and so the differnece between so-called Conservatives and so-called Liberals is how liberalism is to be implemented and where.  Are we to have social libertarianism with a dominating state?  Or economic libertarianism with dominating corporations?  I.e. do you believe in liberal democracy or liberal capitalism as the driving force of progress?  One hardly needs a brain to see that as a bad set of choices."

Clinton does deserve a lot of criticism for her actions and core values, which we don't really even know that much about other than who she has been taking money from.  This sort of video is a means to spur that debate.  The Hillary criticism goes back to 2008 and before.

Instead it's money to the Clinton Foundation, which isn't usable for campaign funds, but the stories just gloss over that.  It's private email use, quoting current State Department rules about it, but ignoring that when she used the server it wasn't required to not use private emails.  She got classified info!  But oh yeah it wasn't classified when it was sent, let's not mention that.  It's all the Benghazi shit, which even Issa's own investigation was forced to acknowledge was a complete witch hunt, then he disavowed his own report.

I get that the Clintons have been tarred by all sorts of made up conspiracy theories that they don't deserve, but Hillary's relationship to Walmart while they were outsourcing and costing American jobs while pretending to 'buy American' is very relevant to today, because it was happening while she was part of the company and an investor/director.  To me this is a relevant criticism of her motives, because it shows what she is involved with and what her actual governing philosophy would be and who she would favor.  She had a long history of service to power and just because she did something 25 years ago doesn't mean it isn't part of long character profile.    The Clinton Foundation issue isn't about money to be used for her campaign, but rather what favors are traded for those donations to Clinton initiatives (its not always about personal profit, rather prestige once you get enough money where money isn't the goal anymore).  Clearly the Clinton Cash book was made up, but it does raise issues that should be investigated more thoroughly.    Benghazi is a joke of course, same with the Vince Foster stuff.  The SD email stuff is a bit more murky though, as she had a second personal email she used for government business that she didn't announce and has been dodging the press for over a month now (i.e. not taking questions).  I too would love nothing more than to see more current actual issues rather than conspiracy theories, but the video in question does raise some issues about her past that may be relevant today."

It's impossible to have an actual discussion with Sanders people.   Way to move from the specific to the general.  All you seem to be saying so far is ""I like Hillary, and I don't like talking to people who don't like Hillary"" followed by ""I'm actually critical of Hillary on a few issues and people should only dislike her for the reasons I dislike her.""

They weren't the best bosses in the universe or anything like that, but they did pay and treat their non-union workers decently enough back at the start, by non-union standards at any rate.  And this was 25 years ago, when basically everyone was treated better.  The treatment of their staff didn't start decaying until he died."

If you advocate running a large debt to maintain a 'strong social safety net' do you think every nation should do the same, or just your own nation? Then as a follow-on, if you accept that every nation should have the same opportunities if all nations run a debt who do they borrow from?  I think the safety net, health systems, education et al must eventually be paid from the wealth of the nation (via taxes) and so should by necessity be limited to what the budget can balance over the medium term. That is we should spend (and tax) in the good times to set up the things we think a nation should provide and only borrow when absolutely essential in the lean times.  If a nation has debt it has interest to pay, wouldn't the money we pay on interest be better served going to the systems we want, such as that strong social safety net?  It's akin to the payday loan schemes the interest cripples the borrower. If you save then spend you spend 100% of your money. If you borrow then spend then repay you have less money to spend overall."

Liberal,36xovb,Law_Student,1 point,Sat May 23 13:58:25 2015 UTC,"What even China? Last I hear they were one of the largest owners of US Bonds in the world.  But if as you say, 'almost all borrowing is done from private individuals' I have to assume those individuals are extremely wealthy. If you then tax such people to punitive levels they won't be so able to 'invest' in such bonds will they?   Also, whoever invests in those bonds does so in the expectation of receiving interest. Therefore these payments have to come from government thereby reducing the money available for the things the nation should be spending our money on."
Liberal,36xovb,EddieMcDowall,7,Sat May 23 14:13:19 2015 UTC,"By 'China' people actually mean private individuals and corporations in China, not so much the government.  The whole 'China owns us' thing is repeated a lot but just not true.  Most of it isn't extremely wealthy individuals because treasury bonds have almost no interest return these days.  Wealthy individuals would much rather invest in things that give actual returns. Treasury bonds are primarily used as an investment device by things like investment funds for pensions and mutual funds as an alternative to holding cash that generates at least a little bit of interest.  They'll often hold some percentage of the fund as treasury bonds as a hedge against risk, since treasury bonds are essentially zero risk investments.  If you tax people you get the money anyway, obviously.  Yes when a government borrows they have to pay interest, but interest rates on treasury bonds are miniscule these days.  It's so small the cost of borrowing is essentially zero because of the progress of inflation over time.  In some cases it's actually negative."
Liberal,36xovb,Law_Student,0,Sat May 23 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"treasury bonds have almost no interest return these days   I'm sorry to question you, but I've done a little research and while the interest treasury bonds return may be very small per bond the amount the US government has to repay is considerable.  In the year 2014 the last full year for which figures are available interest on US national debt alone was $430,812,121,372.05  Offical US Government Source"
Liberal,36xovb,EddieMcDowall,2,Mon May 25 10:23:11 2015 UTC,"You know that the interest rate is set at the time the bond is issued, right?"
Liberal,36xovb,Law_Student,1 point,Mon May 25 10:31:16 2015 UTC,Yes I did but that's not the issue. Whatever the rate is somewhat irrelevant. The fact that the US taxpayer has to repay over $430 billion per year is the issue. I think it would be much better for all if that $430 billion were spent on the people rather than paying interest.  The result of a government living off debt is that every year the US government effectively throws away over $430 billion. That's a lot of healthcare or welfare payments or dare I say free college education.
Liberal,36xovb,EddieMcDowall,2,Mon May 25 11:01:05 2015 UTC,If you don't understand why the rate is important or why borrowing can be more beneficial to society than not borrowing then you've a lot of reading to do still.
Liberal,36xovb,Law_Student,0,Mon May 25 11:12:10 2015 UTC,So you think it's better for the people if the US repays over $430 billion a year in interest rather than use that money on social welfare issues? If that is what all your reading does for you I don't think I want to read it.

The problem is saying you're this way fiscally and that way socially implies that fiscal & social are orthogonal dimensions that make convenient little charts to plot people's stances.  That mental model is completely naive, the two are very closely intertwined to the point that treating them as independent is just nonsense.    It might make more sense as a stance if we already lived in an egalitarian utopia where all wrongs have been settled and everyone gets a fair shake.  Unfortunately, of course, in reality there's plenty of imperiled classes or subsets of society that need assistance in order to be liberated from the systemic and/or historical pressures unfairly placed on them over generations.  Solving those problems are going to come with some costs, simple as that.  Someone truly after social liberation would look at programs to address that based on feasibility and effectiveness, not what color ink it has on a balance sheet.   Fiscal conservatism is social conservatism .  Legalizing drugs and generally staying out of people's personal lives may be good stances, but the fiscal part will still have you batting down real forms of change and progress over and over again."
Liberal,36xovb,JohnnyBeagle,9,Sat May 23 06:48:17 2015 UTC,"I have problems with some of the broad brush attacks in this article.  By American standards I'd label myself 'liberal' (I class myself as a left of centre Conservative by my native UK standards). I'm pro-choice, I'm an egalitarian in that I think all people should have equal rights, to live, marry, eat and consume whatever they want (including drugs) so long as it harms no other person, I'm pro gun control.  However, I'm against big government, as far as possible I want government out of business (and business out of government). But to me that does not mean not helping the rich at the expense of the poorest in society.  I believe in government control regulations, (EPA etc) I believe in a welfare social net, I believe in a health system that serves all regardless of wealth. However I don't think punitive tax rates are fair nor do I believe they will achieve what this article suggests they will.  I think the key is reasonable taxation and fiscal responsibility in the good years, build up a welfare net for the bad years and provide the education to a level where  it can equalize opportunities for all. Restrict legislation to the spheres where it prevents unfair practices and limits opportunities for all but don't punish success.  I also think it's a basic right that we should all be free to pass on the results of our  life's labour to our children (free from tax or at least at a reasonable tax rate not a punitive one), and of course believing that such is a right means I have to accept that often the children of those who have been successful will have a head start in their life financially, we just have to try to ensure they cannot use this financial start to falsely oppress those who don't have such a start."

I think governments should restrict themselves to ensuring safety both for workers and customers, set a corporation tax rate that encourages growth and some tax rebate to encourage R&D and not much else.  I think businesses should be barred from government entirely and donations of over a set  figure (e.g. $10,000) must be totally anonymous. If government needs advice on a business related matter and it doesn't have it's own experts then it can seek advice but government must go to industry not vice versa. Of course anything like this would need to be policed for I'm sure many business people would try to persuade their workers to 'privately' lobby their politician.

Liberal,36xovb,Sikor_Seraph,2,Sat May 23 05:17:42 2015 UTC,"I must admit I don't fit on either side of this debate well I think the fundamental problem in all the issues mentioned is a corporate economy and a dispossessed mass of people which includes almost everyone in the US. One of the reasons I oppose the Affordable Care Act for example is that the subsidy system assumes stability of total income, which leaves hourly workers and the self-employed out in the cold (which may in fact be the point). In essence, the ACA hurts poor people in the name of helping the middle class.  Service rich government relies on income taxes, which are only really enforceable when people are not the sole source of information the government gets about how much they made. Corporations thus have to file W2's to say how much their employees made, and 1099's on how much they paid pretty much everyone else. This sort of surveillance is necessary for taxes to be at all enforced and is only possible when government conscripts corporations to do so.  Not to sound too Marxist but corporations depend on the dispossession of the masses, and by that I mean excluding most people from owning their own businesses, either by restricting access to productive property, tax policy that treats corporations better than family businesses, or by legislative barriers to entry. The primary competitor to the corporation economically is the family (mom and pop stores, family farms) and not just as a married household unit but extended families and across generations. The Soviet experiment was nothing other than a corporate economy with direct ownership by the state, so is actually an example of how things go wrong. The great irony is that government antipoverty programs depend for their existence on even stronger poverty-creating forces. And the US economy is now too centralized with too few companies holding too much control for real structural reform.  But such reform is also made impossible by how we think about poverty. What is poverty? Is it an income level? That is a pro-corporate definition. Or is it functional? Is it lack of security of necessities and lack of access to capital and productive property sufficient for business opportunities? If the latter, most Americans are in poverty, while there is very little poverty in, say, Botswana or Indonesia.  But we are left with what Hilaire Belloc called a servile state, a state where people are forced, under penalty of law, to work for the profit of someone else. If you are middle class and you refuse (say because you want to be self-employed), you will be poor. If you are poor and you refuse, you will lose your welfare If you are on welfare and you lose this, you will be eventually run amok with some laws or another and thrown in prison where, increasingly, you will stay longer if you are unwilling to work in prison industries.

To me, going to war isn't a conservative choice in the manner with which our government has done so. They've been very liberal with their policy of making up false flags to justify enormous waste of life and resources. The US military is one of the largest social programs in the world.

I don't think you can look at what Stalin did to the Ukraine (policies aimed at mass starvation with a million starving to death) and expect that the Ukranians are going to see the Allies as good guys.  Many countries and regions have complex relationships with WWII and not the black and white depictions we get in our history books.  For example, Indonesia was occupied by the Japanese who treated the population pretty much like they did everywhere else (rein of terror including rape), but a key thing they did was they also trained an Indonesian army and protected the independence movement.  Of course the Japanese hoped to have a client state, but when they were defeated, Indonesia had an army, a Constitution, and and infrastructure capable of fighting off the Dutch and British (with the help of Japanese soldiers who opted to stay instead of return home).  It is said that three years under the Japanese were harder than three hundred years under the Dutch, but that at the end, Indonesia became free.  Those were of course rivers of blood with up to two hundred thousand Indonesians giving up their lives for freedom.  But they prevailed, prevailed despite the fact that the British offered military support and troops to the Dutch, and prevailed despite the fact that the US financed the re-invasion by the allies.  Let me repeat that:  Up to two hundred thousand Indonesians died in the war of independence at the hands of the Allies.  Over a million Ukranians were killed by Stalin.  Do you really expect either one to adopt a simply ""yeah the allies were GREAT"" narrative of the war?  These are painful memories and if Ukrainians had an open dialog, the West would not like it.  Same with the Indonesians."

So what do we do about it?  Embrace wage and welfare slavery as a capitalism with a dash of humanity added?

Possibly, even if it's not a guarantee, but it should still be part of the discussion.  Basically measures that will give the American people a larger share of the wealth that they've been creating for so long, despite getting so little in return.

Every time a transaction takes place, whether buy or sell, an 0.5% tax is applied.

I think they should all be like WIC with food coupons for specific healthy foods and if you want pop, candy, cupcakes for class, go out and get a job or go walk on the side of the road and collect bottle deposits that way.

There are genuinely bigoted conservatives and some liberals think that by being honest about the role Islam, like any other religion, has in inspiring extremism and illiberalism that they're somehow siding with them.  Of course, I think you can be critical of both; in my mind, the best stance is to denounce bigotry and violence towards Muslims as well as denounce the same from them.  I believe what we're ultimately dealing with is the mindset Eric Hoffer called ""The True Believer,"" from his book of the same name. It's a human problem, one that can afflict almost any group, religious or secular. Any ideology that promotes an adversarial view of others and has a pattern of welcoming or excusing violence for its own benefit will attract the worst of the true believers. Religion is an especially fertile field, and all of the Abrahamic religions contain at their core these adversarial views of others, complete with rationalizations and justifications for welcoming and excusing violence. We're just in a time where more Muslims (who are not the majority) embrace those views and patterns than Jews or Christians."

Those are examples of things that Americans dislike about all the republicans.  You think the other republican candidates are for the little guy somehow?  Not 1%ers? You're crazy.
Liberal,36gl0x,workerbee77,-1,Tue May 19 19:37:26 2015 UTC,"You sound like you think Americans are some unified block on those opinions. Far from it.  The majority, including many democrats, voted gay marriage down. Prop 8 California ring a bell? Obamacare has been an aggravation and increased burden for many Americans, particularly small business people. Many Americans think abortion is morally and ethically wrong.  Even so, this is basically the left's version of fear mongering. Actual Republican positions vary, and are more nuanced than you suggest.   For instance, abortion laws are unlikely to be drastically altered and certainly there will be no attempt to overturn them outright. The only real push is against late term abortions where the nervous system is developed and the child feels the pain of the procedure. In situations where the mother's health is in danger she'll get preference. This is a reasonable compromise on a difficult subject.  Gay marriage isn't going to be challenged further. The supreme court is going to rule for it under equal treatment under the law. Most Republicans personally believe, as do most humans, in the traditional definition of marriage. Obama and Hillary held the same belief, and probably still do privately. They only revised their public stance for political expediency, Hillary as late as November 2013. It's wedge issue pandering.   At any rate Rubio, Jeb, Christie, Paul, and Walker have all backed off the issue or stated deference, regardless of their personal views.   Obamacare is a complicated issue. I think Republicans are more likely to revise and restructure it than repeal it outright. Too much of a logistical nightmare for everyone to just rip it out. I'd expect provisions to let people opt out without penalty, and changes to make it less onerous for small business people who are struggling already without the added burden.  As for the 1% thing, yes I think some of the other candidates are much more in tune with and sympathetic toward the populace. There's a reason the DNC and GoP want Hillary or Jeb. They're already groomed to advance the globalist agenda.   But there are many other issues more important than gay marriage and abortion. The Republicans will succeed on the economy, defense, and foreign policy, where the current administration, including Hillary, have looked like foolish amateurs."

If you think that Republicans are better on defense and foreign policy...do you mind if I bring up Iraq?  Or are we still doing the ""support the troops!"" thing?  Yes, yes, all the candidates agree that Iraq was a mistake, knowing what we know now.  And all the candidates supported it at one time.  However, it was a Republican who launched that war.

In order to gerrymander in your favor, you need a majority of your party in your state legislature, and that is going to be far less gerrymandered, which means that these states really are red. The districts are redrawn every ten years following each census. If it is only gerrymandering keeping the Republicans in power, the redistricting in 2020 will fix that. So we can revisit this issue in five years."
Liberal,36d6nz,guitar_vigilante,0,Tue May 19 02:58:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, once one party does it everybody has to.  It's like nuclear weapons.  To gerrymander you do need a majority in a census year.  The problem is that the party can use the gerrymandering to maintain that majority for ten years even if it would lose the popular vote by a considerable margin.  This in turn makes it difficult for the opposition to win a majority in the next census year, so things get gerrymandered again, etc.  We won't have election results that represent the popular vote until we draw districts some other way.  My favorite proposal is to use some algorithm that doesn't change and essentially just draws rectangles with the right number of people in them regardless of who lives there."

Liberal,36gdlm,vince1445,11,Tue May 19 04:29:59 2015 UTC,"Sanders. He is saying the same shit I have been saying since 1980. Hillary seems a corporate Democrat to me. Corporate interests have entirely too much power in the US. They are not people. Money is not speech. Free trade agreements that abandon  workers in the US to trying to compete for wages against people making $10 p/day are treasonous.  Bernie, because I am not a serf.  Edited because autocorrect."
Liberal,36gdlm,Thangleby_Slapdiback,15,Tue May 19 12:14:03 2015 UTC,Sanders. Clinton is bought and paid for by the banks and refuses to answer questions. We don't need a Clinton or Bush dynasty we need plans to move us forward

Liberal,36gdlm,WiseCynic,9,Tue May 19 12:41:41 2015 UTC,"Sanders is the candidate I want, and I actually think he could win a primary, but never a general election. Clinton is the candidate I will take because she could win both a primary and a general. The biggest issue of this election is the supreme court. The next president will likely select a minimum of 2 justices. The country NEEDS a democratic win in order to tip the courts in our favor for the long term. As much as I love Sanders, we need a win in the general too much. Clinton can accomplish that. Perhaps with some sort of massive grassroots uprising Bernie would have a shot, but that's not something I'm willing to risk with supreme court seats at stake.   TL;DR: Sanders is the candidate I want, Clinton is the candidate I will take, and the one who can win a general election."

That is definitely a concern, but I think Sanders is too far left for more moderate voters. The number of moderate voters who dislike Clinton enough to vote republican is far less than those who would be put off by Sanders far left policies (That's a personal guess, I have zero data to back that up so I could be completely wrong) As much as I would love Sanders, and he has my vote... it just feels like fantasy :-/"
Liberal,36gdlm,DenyingEverything,1 point,Tue May 19 15:27:58 2015 UTC,"I respectively disagree. The Tea Party movement was initially built upon anger at the establishment. People see Clinton and Bush as the establishment. His big ticket issues are money in politics and wealth inequality—both aren't partisan.   A lot of people are attracted to him simply because of how honest a guy he is. People like that in politics. He says something and he actually tries to get it done. He has only the people at heart.  All we need to do is get a discussion going. If you ask a Republican if they want politicians bought and sold like produce, they'll say no; if you ask them if they think it's acceptable for their paychecks to be stagnating and their children to go thousands of dollars in debt for the crime of getting a higher education while the richest in this nation are doing better than ever, they'll say no. Once you get past the dirty socialism, they turn out to like Bernie's issues."

They already do. The moderates however are the ones that can be swayed, and anyone who maybe leans right economically, but left socially (a large number of moderates), is gonna have a problem with Sanders. I think the key is his ability to motivate young people. If he can do the same thing in that department that Obama did in 2008 then he is golden. Considering you are such a Sanders stan, I have a question out of genuine curiosity. How do you respond to critics who claim he is too old, and the nation is more likely voting for his potential VP nominee should they get to cast a vote for him in the general? It's the same thing Dems said about McCain in the 2008 general and I feel slightly hypocritical about it now should I support Sanders."

Grassroots media on reddit or facebook and talking to friends, family, colleagues, and strangers on the street will win this fight.   I think the key is his ability to motivate young people.   Absolutely. A big reason for Obama's success is that he motivated young people to vote in droves. Good thing is though that Sanders is already well established on the internet and gets more likes on his photos than Clinton got on her campaign announcement video. It's funny you mention this because this is actually one of the most important things I am talking about in my speech come graduation in a couple of weeks.   How do you respond to critics who claim he is too old, and the nation is more likely voting for his potential VP nominee should they get to cast a vote for him in the general?   I wasn't politically aware in 2008, I'm only 17, but I can say that ageism is the last accepted prejudice in America. The man is perfectly healthy and can weather a fair few more fights. Their boy Reagan was elected at 69 and Clinton's 67—he's not old at 73.  In short, he is extraordinarily experienced and I think we need that right about now.

He, unlike Hillary Clinton, has said the same things over and over again for the last 30 years. She's putting on a progressive face right now but we all know she's in the pockets of Wall Street and a war hawk.   He, unlike Hillary Clinton, will be raising a few million dollars with average donations of $50 from actual people. She will be raising possibly over a billion from PACs.   He, unlike Hillary Clinton, only cares about making the United States a better place for its citizens. She has to bow to her campaign contributors.  So long as you're contempt with someone who doesn't care about you, that's who you'll get. As soon as you stand up and fight, spread his name, his message, donate to his campaign, volunteer in your community, you get him in office.  I'll leave you with his own words: ""Nobody thought I'd be elected Mayor of Burlington, Vermont. Very few people thought I'd beat an incumbent Republican to become a U.S. congressmen for Vermont by 16 points. And people weren't so sure I could beat the richest person in Vermont to become a United States senator. So I would say: Don't underestimate me."""

But according to current polls, Sanders stands little chance in the general election. I'm not saying I prefer Clinton in any way.

Nonetheless, I apologize if I came across as condescending but I assure you that is not at all what I intended.   As to your comments on polls: It is very early in this race. We have many, many months to go. I think it is prudent to note President Obama had much of the same standing in comparison to Clinton in 2008. He, too, was thought to have no chance of winning. What happened? People talked about him, they volunteered, they spread his issues, and he got elected president. Now imagine if people heard about this guy named Bernie Sanders who actually has a voting record and doesn't become a corporatist once elected.  This is my point: The U.S. political system is not a medium through which a Bush or a Clinton can be coronated. Sanders' numbers have been shooting up in recent weeks because people are learning who he is.   Put bluntly, you can either write Sanders off as our inept media is doing now and did with Obama or you can help us change this country."

Of course when Hillary wins the primary, I'd rather she won then a Republican. It's a certainty a Republican would get conservative justices that will continue to allow money to poison politics. While Hillary is certainly in bed with corporations, the justices she'd choose are less likely to be.  Since I live in NY I'll vote for a 3rd party liberal, because if Hillary allows NY to be a swing state, she already lost it.

This video isn't a commercial for less gun control because it gives cops less opportunity to be racist, it's a commercial for the fact that cops are racist. Institutionally, not individually.

Liberal,36armr,SamuraiRafiki,4,Mon May 18 10:33:40 2015 UTC,"No. I'm not saying that.     Someone carrying a rifle down the street should be cause for some kind of alarm; and should engender some kind of response or investigation from law enforcement. I think if we're going to have these open carry laws, you should be required to show your license to an officer upon request.      Would you even be able to define what an assault weapon is and how it is different in its function and ""deadliness"" from ""some other kind"" of weapon?     I can think of a few characteristics that differentiate ""guns that ought be banned"" from the rest of them. The capacity to deal mass casualties, for one.      Hint: a 12 gauge buckshot is a lot more deadly than a 5.56x45. And I mean a lot more deadly.     You also don't have as many bullets, nor do they come out of your gun as fast. Yes, someone hit with buckshot is more likely to die from that injury than someone hit with 5.56 ammo, but being hit by 5-7 rounds of 5.56, or even just one, means you're having a bad day and need immediate medical attention or you could die. And someone with an AR-15 or a similar assault weapon can shoot multiple people in quick succession. That's the differentiating factor.     If you need a gun for protection, are you expecting to be attacked by a gang of marauders? No. One or two guys in an alley with small arms, or a guy robbing your house at night. A shotgun would be perfectly sufficient for dissuading the second person, and a handgun would be sufficient for delaying or dissuading the first two. The ability to fire 30 or 45 rounds in a minute or less with an AR-15 is not conducive to that endeavor. It's conducive to shooting at first graders.      You really shouldn't project your insecurities onto others. If your mind just comes up with an association from a gun to a penis, then you really have problems.     Wow. Why don't you just TL;DR that into ""I'm rubber and you're glue"" to save us all some time. Just another conservative, gun-toting coward too obsessed with protecting himself and his wife/sister from the guvmint to think about the collective harm caused by your firearm fetish.

I live in a state with open carry - this may shock you, but the major cities haven't noticed an uptick in any kind of gun related crime.  Your fear is irrational. The guy with a gun on his back is no more likely to shoot you than the guy wearing a turban on the airplane is to blow you up. The least you could do is acknowledge that."
Liberal,36armr,SamuraiRafiki,1 point,Mon May 18 13:55:20 2015 UTC,"not as long as ""the right to keep and bear arms"" is right next to ""the right to free speech"".      This is precisely what I'm arguing against. I think the Second Amendment needs to go the way of the eighteenth.      The guy with a gun on his back is no more likely to shoot you than the guy wearing a turban on the airplane is to blow you up.      The guy with the turban is probably Sikh, not Islamic, so that's a bad example. Even if the guy is Arabic, your example still fails. If someone was holding a 4lb drum of fertilizer with a fuse sticking out of the top and a lighter then it would be a better analogy to the asshole with the gun.  The guy with the gun is way more likely to shoot me than all the people without guns. How am I supposed to differentiate between an active shooter that hasn't started his day and an asshole who thinks he looks cool carrying around a big gun and doesn't realize he looks like an asshole.

Liberal,36armr,Karunamon,1 point,Mon May 18 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"I think the Second Amendment needs to go the way of the eighteenth.   Fine - start rolling on the constitutional convention then. Until then, you kind of have no business being scandalized that someone does something they're explicitly allowed to do by the supreme law of the land. Shooting people and brandishing is already against the law - what you propose criminalizing is no different than criminalizing the guy shouting about religion on the street corner (the first amendment) because he might hurt someone.   If someone was holding a 4lb drum of fertilizer with a fuse sticking out of the top and a lighter   Which is not even close to a fair analogy. The fact of the matter is, most people open carrying are not a threat.   The guy with the gun is way more likely to shoot me than all the people without guns.   And the muslim is, strictly speaking, more likely to suicide bomb you than all of the non muslims.   How am I supposed to differentiate between an active shooter that hasn't started his day and an asshole who thinks he looks cool carrying around a big gun and doesn't realize he looks like an asshole.   You're supposed to realize that ""active shooters"" happen only slightly more often than ""terrorist plots"", which is to say, not very often at all. Your fear is not rational and is not borne out by facts.   What I'm saying is when an asshole shows up in a public place with a big gun   Why is he an asshole, again? Or is this just you projecting your irrational fear onto perfect strangers?   a cop should talk to him and find out if he's a whackadoodle getting ready to kill people or an asshole   Considering the first isn't very likely, and in the off chance you got fantastically unlucky on that day it is, that scenario is likely to end in the death of the cop.  There is no rational reason to worry about someone open carrying who's minding their own business."
Liberal,36armr,Aero72,-1,Mon May 18 20:15:26 2015 UTC,"Someone carrying a rifle down the street should be cause for some kind of alarm   Yeah, ""someone should do something"". True motto of a liberal. :)   I can think of a few characteristics that differentiate ""guns that ought be banned"" from the rest of them.   It's a pity you went really vague after that...   The capacity to deal mass casualties, for one.    And what should the limiting capacity be? How do we define or quantify it? In number of people killed per unit time?  Or do we just keep it vague for the sake of not exposing how ridiculous this whole debate is?   That's the differentiating factor.    If you really want to see how brainwashed you are and how stupid this argument is, then do this:  Grab yourself a 12g. Something semi-auto, cylinder bore (for better spread), with 7 rounds capacity. Get some buckshot, say, 8mm ones with 10 pellets.  Go to a gun range. Put some large sheets of paper downrange. A bunch of newspapers would do just fine.  Then walk back 20-30 yards. And fire a round.  Then check how far those pellets spread out. From just one shot.  Now, with 7 rounds, that's something like 70 pellets of  firepower. (Compare than to 30-45 rounds you mentioned.) Each of those pellets carries energy similar to that of a pistol at such range.  If you were to shoot into a crowd, you would hit more than one person with one shot. As a matter of fact, you would most likely kill more people.  Mass shooters are using ar15s not because ar15s are more effective at mass shooting, but because mass shooters are mostly morons. If they had their shit together, they wouldn't be doing shit like that in the first place.  So if you outlaw the ar15s, then you'll have crazies with shotguns doing a lot more damage.

Just like the first cop did.      It's a pity you went really vague after that...     Kindly continue reading. Guns that can cause mass casualties in a short period of time are the ones we need to be focusing on. The ATF or some duly appointed agency can make the determination about exactly which guns fall into that category.      And what should the limiting capacity be? How do we define or quantify it? In number of people killed per unit time?   I'm sorry, are you legitimately expecting me to do a job that should be done by a committee, congressional or otherwise, over a series of months with input from both the industry and victim advocacy groups? Be realistic. It's a complex question, but the answer is not ""ALL GUNS ALL THE TIME CAN'T BAN ANY OF 'EM JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL.""     Grab yourself a 12g.     Nah. I'm confident in my masculinity, don't need to compensate.      Go to a gun range.     There are literally dozens of things I'd rather do. There's a Molly Moons near my house. Why jack off to Guns and Ammo magazines with a bunch of other emotionally insecure assholes when I can have ice cream?     If you were to shoot into a crowd, you would hit more than one person with one shot. As a matter of fact, you would most likely kill more people.     So why does the military use rifles? Accuracy, ease of use, rate of fire, etc. The Sandy Hook shooter went from shooting out the front window to eating a bullet in a few minutes, killing 20 kids and 6 adults in that time, using the extended magazines he had for his AR-15 to fire up to 30 bullets at a time. It would not have been as easy with a shotgun. Or maybe it would, and you're making an excellent case for banning shotguns that fire 7-9 rounds at a time. Who needs more than 2 or 3 for hunting or protection?       Who would be paying taxes and supporting your broke ass then?   Oh wow, will you really jump in a ditch and die if I say you don't have to pay taxes anymore?

Maybe it's because I don't have a problem with that. You, on the other hand...   So why does the military use rifles?   Not to commit mass shootings against civilians in closed spaces....  The characteristics that make a weapon good for war don't automatically make that same weapon somehow more dangerous in a mass shooting scenario.   extended magazines he had   There is a good video of a Democrat councilman in some shithole meeting arguing with a sheriff over gun laws. And he makes the same point to. To which the sheriff replied that they ran simulations on that, and found that having a larger number of smaller-capacity magazines would slow down the shooter insignificantly, especially compared to police response time.  It's basically winning seconds while losing minutes.  And you know what they councilman did?  Nothing. He just pretended he didn't hear it and continued repeating his mantra of ""smaller capacity magazines would save lives....blah-blah.""  So please stop repeating bullshit.  The difference between two 30-round mags and six 10-round magazines is insignificant when hunting down two-legged, unarmed cattle.  So if you choose to be two-legged cattle, then a smaller magazine carried by someone about to shoot you won't save you.   making an excellent case for banning Who needs more than   Ah, yes.

I think that if Bernie gets a platform to speak from, he will change a bunch of minds. I also think that he would eat any of the announced GOP candidates alive in the debates and would win in a big way in the general election.   What makes me think so is the continued leftward drift of the American populace (Obama's election & reelection, occupy wall st, the sudden shift on marriage equality and marijuana). I think that Bernie has a better shot because from what I can see his negative numbers aren't anything approaching Hillary's, and, unlike Hillary, much of the nation has never heard of him. Hillary has a long way to fall, and not much potential to rise at this point. Bernie is popular, gaining in popularity, has the potential to grab a whole bunch more voters than Hillary has the potential to grab (in the primaries), and I think in the general election.   I think the mouth breathers and the top percentage bought Mitt's ""47%"" thing. I think Many in the GOP, who work hard but don't make big bucks, know it was not true.

You can hear it in the beliefs that they espouse. Deeply patriotic, yes, but tempered in their patriotism in that they won't jump on any bullshit bandwagon because someone drapes some flags over it.  Bill Moyers is a good example of what I'm talking about. That deep decency.   I think we have a shot @ Ohio. Dunno, maybe Virginia.   Saw something the other day. reliable blue state vs. reliable red state sort of thing. End of the day, going by what's reliably/likely blue vs what's reliably/likely red, Democrats need to pick up 20-something electoral votes. GOP? 160 something.   I think the  left is poised on their ""Reagan"" moment. We won't see a blue field like we saw in '84, but we'll see something nearly as monumental. That's my prediction if Bernie is the nominee.

Let me ask you something - who do you think has a better shot at leading us toward a country with the better future, Bernie or Hillary? This is strictly your opinion, now, not who you think is more electable. Your opinion. Who would be the better President?  Given the nature of our future (global climate change, artificial intelligence, automatic automobiles, advances in robotic), I think Senator Sanders is the better choice. Therefore it is my duty, as a citizen, as a human being, as a father and grandfather, to do what wee little I can to help him make it to the White House.  Other people think Hillary is that leader. Many think Walker. Regardless of the candidate, the above is true.  Maybe we don't get the desired result, but we have to try.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali has the mental and physical scars of the abuse Islam perpetuates on women and apostates. Due to this first hand experience she is worth listening to, and of course we need to weigh her negative experiences when listening to her.  When people denounce a religion (Islam in this case) too many people automatically raise the islamophobia / racism / bigotry label without listening to the arguments, (Ben Affleck syndrome). From my experience it is extremely rare for any of the more educated critics of Islam to fall into the trap of labelling all muslims as x,y or z, more often they point out that Islam encourages such beliefs and very often are at pains to praise the majority that don't follow the religion to the full. However, still, all too often, they are attacked as islamophobic. (Why don't we have Atheistophobic or Christianophobic?)

The religion itself is the threat and if we don't face that we will suffer the consequences.

WHy not mention that you are talking about third world muslim countries in the Middle East/Africa that filled with extremists largely due to Western intervention?   First off, Maher and Harris have.  Second, it's not limited to third world countries.  Indonesia is not a third world country.  Britain isn't either; something like 25% of British Muslims said that violence against artists who draw Muhammad is justifiable.

Liberal,368g38,Manuel___Calavera,1 point,Sat May 30 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"Lets back track.  I said:   Sam Harris literally says that Islam is worse than any other religion.   You said:    He has stated that it needs to go through another Enlightenment,    No where did you mention a specific muslim group or country. You just said Islam. You see how what you are saying can be seen that way? This is what Harris and Maher do. They say ""there is a serious problem with islam. Islam is worst than any other religion"". But when you get to specifics: they backtrack and claim they never meant all of islam.   They use islam/muslims so generically because they know so little about muslim countries/foreign policies.  No, you're using that straw man again.   It's the exact opposite. I want Harris and Maher to be more specific when talking about muslim countries. Instead of saying ""problem is islam"". Or ""islam needs to be enlightened"", mention specific example/countries of what you are talking. You can't blame people for criticizing you when you make broad claims.   . Indonesia is not a third world country. Britain isn't either; something like 25% of British Muslims said that violence against artists who draw Muhammad is justifiable.   What is wrong with Indonesia? They are a fairly secular state. Certainly way more humane and tolerant than Saudi Arabia. *insert something here you dislike in indonesia which you could do for ANY country""   25% of British Muslims said that violence against artists who draw Muhammad is justifiable.   This means 75% did not. The vast majority. This is a problem with Islam? If it a problem with Islam the vast majority should be in agreement right?  How does your criticism work? It is only islam if it is something you disagree with and find appalling?  the majority of Americans supported invading Iraq, which had nothing to do with terrorism. How many christians in the south support abortion clinic bombings? How many Americans support bombing X country on a given day? I'd range there is a conservative base which 25% would at least support bombing any middle eastern country.   straw men   You keep using that phrase. I do not think it means what you think it means. Muslims are the ones fighting against the extremists muslims. In your own statistic 75% of muslims did not support the killing of the cartoonist.   So this idea that criticizing Harris/Maher for generalizing muslims means we don't criticize muslim extremists is just a false equivalency."
Liberal,368g38,ThisPenguinFlies,1 point,Sat May 30 04:45:15 2015 UTC,"No where did you mention a specific muslim group or country.   I did.  I said in another comment that ""that a large number of Muslims maintain these beliefs.""  If they don't ""maintain these beliefs,"" I'm not talking about them.   You just said Islam.   I didn't.  Two things need to change: Islam, the religion itself, and Muslims who literally believe the horrible parts of it.   You see how what you are saying can be seen that way?   By people who want to straw man, sure.   This is what Harris and Maher do. They say ""there is a serious problem with islam. Islam is worst than any other religion"". But when you get to specifics: they backtrack and claim they never meant all of islam.   They're not backtracking; they never made the claim that it was all Muslims in the first place.   It's the exact opposite.   It's literally not.   I want Harris and Maher to be more specific when talking about muslim countries.   They're so specific they cite numbers from research organizations.  You spout off straw men.   You can't blame people for criticizing you when you make broad claims.   They never made broad claims.  You and your ilk are assuming they're talking in broad strokes.  And at this point it isn't assuming anymore.  They've repeatedly stated they are not, so now you're spreading lies.   What is wrong with Indonesia?   I explained this to you in another comment: ""in a recent episode of Real Time, Bill Maher quoted research data that found large percentages of Muslims in countries like Indonesia believe Sharia should be the law, that death is appropriate for apostasy, that adulterers should be stoned, and etc...)""   This means 75% did not.   I know how to subtract 25 from 100, thank you.   This is a problem with Islam?   It sure is.  The religious texts prohibit it.  The 25% aren't ignoring the text.   How does your criticism work?   If the religion says it, it's a problem with the religion.  Christianity says gay people should be stoned.  That's a problem with the religion, even though a majority of Christians gloss right over it.   You keep using that phrase. I do not think it means what you think it means.   I do, I provided you a link to it.  You're going after positions that Harris and Maher do not hold, therefore you are attacking straw men.   So this idea that criticizing Harris/Maher for generalizing muslims means we don't criticize muslim extremists is just a false equivalency.   Another straw man, as no one said you don't criticize Muslim extremists.  The point is that you equate criticism of Islam, the religion, with Muslims.  Maher and Harris are attacking the illiberalism within the religion, and there are liberals who think they're criticizing all Muslims when they do that; they aren't, they're going after the religion, as in the dogma/creed, and the Muslims who don't gloss over the bad parts of it."

If the religion says it, it's a problem with the religion. Christianity says gay people should be stoned. That's a problem with the religion, even though a majority of Christians gloss right over it.   I know you're going to backtrack when I point this out because that's what Harris defenders are great it. So if the issue is Christianity, why did the majority not support it? Clearly Christian interpretation is flexible enough to allow for different interpretation within the majority of christian communities.  The problem is the SOME communities are not tolerant. You seem to lack sociological imagine. So when you see a group of religious people acting in a way you disagree with, you say that's Christianity. Rather than that is a specific group of christian extremists.  You just contradicted yourself again.  You said ""Maher and Harris are attacking the illiberalism within the religion"". But they aren't. They are criticizing certain cultures and countries and calling that islam when they disagree with it.  If it is liberal and accepting, that's not islam.

All of those can be avoided without a device on your wrist.  Can a watch help your health?  Sure.  Track your blood pressure, your pulse, count your calories, any number of things.  Develop some kind of system similar to insulin checks and it could probably do a whole lot more.  As is it could still be set up to call 911 the second you have something like a heart attack or stroke, I think those vitals could be easily tracked; GPS sends the ambulance right to you.  If he had said something like that, nobody would be mocking him.  He'd probably get tech points for being innovative.  But he had to go and say something like a watch can replace health insurance.

I ""get"" that when you oppose the Death Penalty you must be principled & oppose every execution, but where do we get the fucking resources?  Denying him a ""martyr"" 's death & having him rot in solitary, even sensory deprivation - seems to be my best argument for opposing the death penalty in this case.  Nothing but Propaganda considerations.

Answer it, bonehead!   Since its founding in 1971, Amtrak has received roughly $1 billion in annual federal funding, an amount that officials argue has been grossly insufficient to support the sprawling railroad network. “The federal investment in Amtrak is currently and has always been extremely limited, compared with federal investments in other modes of transportation,” Amtrak Chairman Anthony Coscia said in testimony before a Senate subcommittee in December, referring to federal spending on highways. He said the railroad service had had to put off so many improvements of its tracks and other infrastructure that it was struggling simply to maintain what it had. He, too, described the Northeast Corridor as having “aging infrastructure” that nonetheless supported some 260 million trips every year.   cited from http://www.ibtimes.com/amtrak-crash-philadelphia-did-gop-funding-cuts-make-derailment-more-likely-1920720"

Liberal,35y08t,Dixzon,6,Thu May 14 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"Ask yourself how you would know if you were infringing on a secret patent.   Ok. An inventor working for a small defense contractor came up with a novel approach to an avionics problem.  Perhaps he invented a new radar, IFF system, drone computer, etc. Anyway, he wants a patent.  The government want to use his approach in products manufactured by large defense contractors like Boeing, McDonnell-Douglass, Lockheed-Martin, etc. The government doesn't want his approach being given to potential adversaries.   So, the government issues the patent, but classifies it. The inventor doesn't have the ability to manufacture it himself, nor does the small defense contractor he's working for. So, in coordination with the government, he approaches the big defense contractors with his idea. They license it from him, manufacture it themselves, and cut him a paycheck for every unit built.   Basically, if you're working on this sort of problem, you've already got the security clearance and need-to-know to access relevant patents, and there's already a contractual mechanism in place for the inventor to secure licensing fees for your use of his patent."
Liberal,35y08t,rivalarrival,1 point,Thu May 14 18:13:23 2015 UTC,That's assuming a lot.

The UK has 4 systems (Wales, England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland all have their own devolved systems).  Denmark has 7 different systems (one for each of the European regions, one for the Faroe Islands, and one for Greenland).  Sweden may have a single pool of money but primary decision making power happens on the municipality level.  The ACA was a giveaway to corporations and a prison for the self-employed.  A truly public and communitarian health care system would be a step forward, but I do think we have to be careful about the idea that the federal government here is the answer.  The federal government acts best when it enables more social solutions (for example by state and local government).  That is what most other developed countries actually do, and even Communist China places a lot of emphasis on local governance in health care.  So why is that not on the table in the US?

Chelan County (very Republican) in Eastern Washington State had fully vehicle-tax supported public transit until city Republicans said they couldn't and still has county-run fiber to the home that is then leased out to local ISP's.  Red states generally face one of two problems.  Either you have the legacy of the civil war and the inability of anyone to face up to the economic inequality that came with Johnson's insistence that the way for the newly freed slaves to advance was to get a job, or you have the fact that federal lands drain local resources and don't pay money back into local communities.  So that is why we need real slavery reparations and why the federal government should agree to pay state property taxes on federal lands.  Community can't exist when the resources are being drained away by Walmart and the federal government.  The federal government can be a part of the solution (by cultivating local empowerment) or it can be a part of the problem.  But part of the issue has to be addressing the economic legacy of Andrew Johnson's faith in wage labor to elevate newly freed slaves from poverty.  150 years has shown how well that has worked and you are right that particularly in the South, unless one can address that (Reparations), there is no hope for community empowerment.  But the federal government set the stage for that and, tokens of formal desegregation aside, has been far more of an oppressor than a savior precisely because when you are poor, family and community are often all you have and so the effort to liberate people from those is a disaster for them."

Employees entitled to a single payment at the end of every year or on termination of employment (whichever comes first) equal to two average months of wages awarded to that employee, with the provision that this does not apply to employees which have not worked more than three months for the employer.

Liberal,35wiox,einhverfr,2,Thu May 14 04:36:09 2015 UTC,"The idea is that the problem is not low wages.  The problem is too much control over the economy by big business.  The employer has a responsibility to pay a living wage, all things considered, and should be liable to the state when the state has to pick up the tab.  That way Walmart can't use Medicaid and food stamps to subsidize their business operations and effectively insist that mom and pop stores pay taxes to subsidize them in this way.  Points 3 and 4 are aimed at ensuring that the subsidy in fact goes the other direction, that people can quickly and easily become self-employed, that businesses have an incentive (no statutory bonuses) to contract with the self-employed rather than hiring employees, and that the bonuses also mean that it becomes possible to borrow money from relatives (or save up bonuses) to become self-employed.  (I would actually suggest those statutory bonuses be exempt from income taxes.)  What we have right now is an economic order where small business subsidizes big business.  This would turn it on its head, insisting that big business must subsidize very small business because one key predictor among similarly situated economies of economic equality (in terms of ownership of resources) is the self-employment rate.  More self-employment means less disparity of wealth.  This makes sense if you think about it:  employers want returns on investment (in the form of excess value) while workers just want economic security and the hope for a modestly better future.  Corporate employment, particularly when centralized in the hands of big business, thus generates economic inequality and poverty."

Liberal,35wiox,jake_fly,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:12:48 2015 UTC,"Mathematically sound, but if people want to make a living wage they can refuse to work for less, meaning no profit for the business.

It was a compromise and while it brought healthcare forward, it did not do enough which is also precisely why he can't get the health care he needs now. A single payer system would have taken care of his emergency and his healthcare without exceptions.   Now he knows the kind of stipulations that the repubs shovel into the bill. A taste of his own medicine. And he never even bought insurance when he was healthy, thinking that he does not need healthcare, exactly the type of shit thinking that infects the right. Where the so-called personal responsibility? He prided himself of paying all his healthcare bills? Only when he does not need major procedures, now he needs it he's blaming US for not doing enough?

Liberal,35qkcg,pateras,3,Tue May 12 18:14:57 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting article with a good point.  And I also believe that fixing the system cant be at the expense of the poor.  I think all of us (frankly including many on the right) can look around us and realize the system must be fixed because it isn't saving people from poverty  What I see in the last hundred years in the US is a set of dialogs our nation has had on the question of the interaction between state and corporation.  Gilbert Chesterton once said that the business of progressives was to go about making mistakes and the business of conservatives was to make sure those mistakes could never be corrected.  That is remarkably on-point.  The most crucial disasters came from the Progressive era and tax policies that treated corporations better than family businesses (the income tax sets employers up as gatekeepers of the tax system, and the estate tax is paid by family businesses but never by corporations).   Now look at what we have, and of course it is the Conservatives defending the corporations.  The New Deal strengthened this understanding but with the crucial concession by labor that (out of fear of communism) labor would not get a real say in the ownership of the means of production.  (That concession btw was partially undone by Reagan of all people, with the focus on employee stock purchase plans and employee ownership of business.) What we were left with was total governmental support for corporations, with the caveat that support for big labor would somehow contain the problems.  I actually think Ronald Reagan and Margeret Thatcher tried to fix the system (in the UK workers' wages as share of GDP had peaked in the late 1960's and there is no reason to think this was different in the US), but they made a crucial and disastrous mistake  In the name of an ownership society we didn't get real structural reform, but instead just the same support for corporations but now with the government favoring capital instead of labor.  How well has that worked out?  Well, if you were very wealthy before now you are extremely wealthy and if you were poor before now you are extremely poor.  If you were Middle Class, now you are in economic uncertainty.  In this regard the article is totally right.  But if corporate control is the problem then frankly we have to go back and at least rethink the legacy of the Progressive Era and New Deal because these are the periods when the deep link was formed between corporation and government.  Going back to the 1950's era solutions or the 1969 lines in the war on poverty won't solve the issues.  Those didn't actually work (WWII however had transferred downward a huge amount of wealth in the form of payments to service members and THAT is what gave the illusion of these policies working so well).  So speaking as someone who loves tradition, memory, social connections, family, and all the other things that Russeau thought were chains on the man born free (because they are better than the corporate/government pair we have created in the name of freeing people from those chains), this is what I think we need to do.  I also think there is room to make a real alliance with social conservatives on these reforms:    Regulate against scale.  Deregulate small business and re-regulate big business.  Break up businesses that are too big to fail.  Treat family businesses better than corporations.  Give states a right to take over federal programs and budgets, provided that they deliver the same or better results (if they don't give the feds the right to take that back).  Now you have local power, objective standards, and accountability.  States might even be able to use Medicare and Medicaid money to set up single payer systems if they want.  Add an additional small filial duty benefit to Social Security.  It doesn't matter how small but give a small thank you benefit (could even be a tax credit, though this often excludes the poorest, so would prefer a check in the mail) for people who have retired parents or parents-in-law living with them.  This frees up money that people can invest in their children, and in the long run may even structurally discourage divorce (another good thing, given how Elizabeth Warren has shown how divorce and poverty are linked).  We need to talk about poverty differently.  Instead of income levels and wage levels, we need to start talking about it functionally, and in particular I would suggest that poverty consists of the following factors: insecurity in necessities (food, water, shelter), and lack of access to capital and business opportunity.  While I won't claim to have all the answers, I do think we need to have a serious discussion in how to avoid those problems without the traditional answers of putting centralized banking or central government as the gatekeeper of the system.  I.e. how can we structurally prevent those evils from happening?   The system cannot be fixed without rethinking the legacy not only of Reagan and Clinton but also Johnson (both!  Remember Andrew Johnson failed to support Sherman's call for land reform in the South) and FDR."

There has been more attacks on Pamela Geller since the shooting than there have been against the assholes who shot a cop and tried to terrorize the event. Juan Williams even went so far as to say Geller is responsible for the two deaths of the jihadis.  And it illustrates the double standard the Left has with Islam and other beliefs. If Mormons killed people involved in the Broadway Play ""The Book of Mormon"" nobody would be calling its creators provocateurs and claim the play is ""hate speech."" The artist who created ""Piss Christ"" where a crucifix was dipped in the artist's urine does not need body guards to protect him from irate Catholics who were offended. The US government even paid for that piece of shit ""art."" When ""The Last Temptation of the Christ"" came out, there were no attacks on the lives of Martin Scorsese or Willem Defoe, despite having a graphic fantasy sex scene between Jesus and Mary Magdeline. There was even a play called Corpus Christi where Jesus and His disciples were all gay. Nobody on the Left called that provocative hate speech and attacked the playwright. Yet one woman holds an obscure ""Draw Mohammed"" contest, two assholes are so offended they travel 500 miles to kill people involved and somehow Geller is the bad person in this whole equation.

It's the equivalent of victim blaming after a rape. ""Of course rape is wrong, but let me spend the next hour telling you how you brought it upon yourself.""   The Left was never this critical of the artist who made Piss Christ, the creators of The Book of Mormon play, the playwright who wrote Corpus Christie, Scorsese for The Last Temptation of Christ or even Charlie Hebdo. Every one of those are just as provocative as the Muhamad cartoon contest, yet if some Christian/Mormon asshole decided to kill them, there wouldn't be a peep from the Left about how they shouldn't have provoked Christians.

Liberal,35lhds,OMG_its_JasonE,1 point,Wed May 13 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"Backing up your claims with sources is also a thing. So now let's look at your source.  Example 1 - Wisconsin Sikh Temple massacre - Feel free to show me where this guy was a Christian or shot up the temple ""in the name of the Christian faith."" It would seem like he was merely a stupid racist redneck who wanted to get even with the 9/11 terrorists and couldn't tell Muslim from Sikh.   Example 2 - Murder of George Tiller - Yes, this asshole claimed to be a Christian and killed Tiller in the name of Christianity.  Example 3 - Knoxville Unitarian Univerasalist Church Shooting - Salon calls him a ""Christian Right sympathizer"" but there is no mention of any religious motivations for the killing. Yes, the killer did hate Democrats and gays, but Christianity never appears in any of his claims of why he did it.  Example 4 - Murder of John Britton - Another murder of an abortion doctor by a self-described Christian done in the name of Christianity.  Example 5 - Centennial Olympic Park Bombing - From his manifesto, Eric Rudolph, has no mention of religion or Christianity. However, he is also guilty of previous bombings of abortion clinics and a lesbian bar, so I'll also acknowledge that he has committed violence in the name of Christianity, even if it wasn't the specific bombing mentioned by Salon.  Example 6 - Murder of Barnett Slepian - Another murder of an abortion doctor by a self-described Chrsitian done in the name of Christianity.  Example 7 - Planned Parenthood Bombing - Same as 2, 4 and 6.  Example 8 - Suicide attack on IRS building Austin - This was a politically motivated attack, no mention of religion or Christianity in Stack's manifesto.  Example 9 - Murder of Alan Berg - This murder was motivated by racism and politics, not religion or Christianity.  Example 10 - Oklahoma City Bombing - Again, another political far-right terrorist attack that had nothing to do with Christianity and was not done in the name of Christianity.  So out of the 10 ""worst examples of Christian terrorism"" only 5 could be said to have been carried out in the name of Christianity. And considering that the earliest attack on abortionists listed happened in 1994, I could make the argument that there have been only 5 such incidents of violence in the past 20 years, each of them focused on the issue of abortion, which some view as a genocide of over 1 million per year.  So let's compare the differences between Christian murderers and Islamic murderers. What are the Christians killing for? In their fucked up and misguided way, they kill and murder because they oppose what they perceive as the murder of millions of innocent lives each year. But they're not doing it because someone insulted Jesus, burned a Bible or simply stopped becoming a Christian.   Now, why are Islamic murderers killing for?   * Moore, Oklahoma (9/25/2014) - Sharia advocate beheads coworker after calling for Islamic terror   West Orange, New Jersey (6/25/2014) - A 4 people were killed in retaliation for the Muslims killed in the Middle East Seattle, Washington (6/1/2014) - Three homosexuals murdered by self-styled jihadist. Port Bolivar, Texas (4/27/2014) - Muslim man shoots his lesbian daughter and her lover, citing Quran passage condemning homosexuality Richmond, Virginia (4/27/2014) - New convert to Islam stabs to death hardware clerk because he was ""on a mission from Allah."" Boston, Massachusetts (4/15-4/19/2015) - ""Very religious"" Muslims bomb finish line of the Boston Marathon and murder a cop sitting in his car as part of their own religious war against the West. Ashtabula, Ohio (3/24/2013) - A Muslim convert walks into a church carrying a Quran and shoots and kills his Christian father while praising Allah Houston, Texas (1/15/2012) - Muslim man kills outspoken Iranian activist because she ""influenced his daughter to marry without his permission."" Warren, Michigan (4/3/2011) - Muslim man follows and shoots to death his stepdaughter because ""she was not following Islam."" Marquette Park, Illinois (4/14/2010) - Muslim man shoots and kills wife and two daughters after argument about her not wanting to wear Muslim clothing. He claims Allah told him to kill his family. Binghampton, New York (12/4/2009) - Muslim graduate student stabs professor to death because he thought he was being persecuted as a Muslim. Fort Hood, Texas (11/5/2009) - Muslim psychiatrist kills 13, and injures 31 after opening fire on army base, yelling ""Allahu Ackbar!"" Glendale, Arizona (6/1/2009) - Muslim man runs over his daughter with his car because she was ""becoming too Westernized.""   Unfortunately the list goes on. . .and on. . .and on. So the reason Christians kill in the name of Christ is to stop abortion. The reason Muslims kill in the name of Islam and Allah is because other people aren't Muslim enough. While I agree that both forms of killing are wrong and should be condemned wholeheartedly, there is a huge difference between the motivations of the two groups. One is ostensibly to save lives, while the other is simply for insulting or not living up to Islamic ideals enough."

A conservative and a liberal posting busily for a year to /r/politics, a theoretically neutral subreddit, are going to have very different karma scores. Even the topics there are skewed way left. The only way conservative opinion is heard, is in the comments of a liberally biased article post.  I've often thought if I cared about karma, I could go around posting about Faux News, the ""war on women"", and this republican is  ""scary"" and that one is ""batshit crazy"". The language and modus operandi are all pretty redundant and predictable, but enthusiastically reinforced day in and day out. I appreciate your spirit, but if liberals really wanted an open market of ideas there wouldn't be so much ad hominem and smear tactics. I mean liberals are responsible for confining controversial thoughts to ""free speech zones"" on campuses, and ""safe spaces"" where they can hide from candor and ideologies whose nonconformity might upset them.  I hate to use the term, but liberals, with their multi-channel narrow band media, shaming, silencing, and suppressing, have become the closest thing I've seen to fascist, in my 40+ years watching the American climate. Just take an honest eye and look at how much labels and hyperbole are thrown about. It's little wonder liberal rhetoric is so similar. Dissent can cost you your job, or the destruction of your business. How does that promote discourse?"

So, an incomplete background, simplified, and shortened lesson on the mechanism that  causes climate change.  Our planet  receives the vast majority of it's energy from the sun. The radiation (light and other wavelengths) that reaches the earth gives energy to the system as a whole. When the energy reaches the earth, a portion of the energy is absorbed by the gas in the atmosphere. Another portion is absorbed either by oceans, the earth, plant life, etc. The remainder is reflected off the ground and back up into the atmosphere. Here it has 2 possible destinations. Some of the energy will be reflected through the atmosphere and back out into space, and some will be absorbed into the gasses of the atmosphere.   If you  get into  the chemistry you  will find that some gasses are  better at absorbing this energy than others. The gasses that absorb energy well also tend to re-emit energy into the space around it, much like the heat coming off of a frying pan after you put it on the stove. Specifically, Carbon Dioxide (CO2) tends to absorb and re-emit this energy at a much higher rate than oxygen (O2). So, if you have an atmosphere rich in CO2 you will find a that it traps much more of the energy than an atmosphere filled with O2.   Why does this matter? Well fossil fuels are chemical compounds made of almost exclusively Carbon and Hydrogen. These compounds, called hydrocarbons, are extremely good at burning, blowing up, and lighting on fire. That is why they are such great fuels for engines. You get a lot of energy out of a very small volume. The problem is that combustion reactions with fossil fuels (Hydrocarbons) always leave you with two byproducts: Water (H2O) and our buddy Carbon Dioxide (CO2).   The entire world runs on this fuel, so that means the entire world is pumping out HUGE amounts of Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere. This is the main driver of increasing Carbon Dioxide levels in the atmosphere, which leads to an increased amount of energy trapped on earth rather than dissipating into space, which leads to rising global temperatures.   Now we must ask what the global implication of rising temperatures are. Temperature is essentially the measure of the energy of motion that individual particles in an object have. It's basically a roundabout way of measuring the energy in an object.   We also must remember that global warming refers to the overall change of the temperature throughout the world from year to year. Not any one location or day, but the  change averaged over the entire  earth on an annual basis.   As we said, temperature measures the energy in an object, therefore global temperatures reflect the energy in the earth. When we say the earth is warming, it is more accurate  to say that the earth is becoming more energetic. Based on this logic you would expect to see more extreme  weather patterns that average themselves out across the globe to reflect an increase in temperatures. Drought, hurricanes, blizzards, storms and a whole host of other extreme weather events could be expected to increase.    Why is this a problem? The ecosystem is very fragile. To give you an idea of how fragile (although this is unrelated to climate change) I suggest watching this short video about the wolves of Yellowstone National Park. As the video shows, disrupting only one or two key species can have disastrous effects on the entire ecosystem.  Studies have suggested that recent deforestation and overhunting coupled with increasing global temperatures have caused and/or worsened one of the earth's few great Extinction Events.  There is much debate on our role in this event, but  it is a major cause for concern. Many of the world's people (including the poor Philipinoes) rely on thriving ecosystems to provide the food needed to survive. If more ecosystems continue to collapse, there could be widespread famine, and the United State's role in recent natural disasters would probably lead to us offering aid to these countries. In fact the CIA believes the potential widespread famine and natural disasters will be so destabilizing to certain parts of the world that we may see an increase in wars and national security threats in the coming years."

It's a problem with many Americans that isn't specific to one group of people. But let me clarify: when it comes to strictly economics, conservatives are often seen by the public as the more logical-thinking ones. I think this applies even more so to Libertarians, as they are generally assumed to have the most fact-based beliefs, even if a lot of highly educated people are debunking most of the claims they make. The main point I'm trying to make is that if we want to win over conservatives, we can't do it by making fun of them or calling them heartless and mean people. I want to see more people calling them out on how they are factually wrong. I have seen a lot of liberals do this already but I still think it needs to be done more often."
Liberal,358j7y,wenchette,14,Fri May 8 02:34:11 2015 UTC,"when it comes to strictly economics, conservatives are often seen by the public as the more logical-thinking ones   That's your opinion. I disagree. My undergraduate degree is in economics so I know a thing or two about that subject. Conservative economic arguments are, almost without exception, built on magical thinking. Even more so for libertarians. The whole magical free market and trickle down fantasies are great examples. Krugman regularly debunks the conservative economic gibberish and that's habitually ignored by the right wing.  Then there's the law and the whole conservative fiction of ""originalism."" And then there's science, where the right wing just conveniently ignores the massive body of evidence about climate change and instead believes some putz who they think is a genius because he funded The Weather Channel, even though he has utterly no scientific training and is a climate denier."
Liberal,358j7y,SouthrnComfort,-1,Fri May 8 02:52:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the right-wing economic beliefs are not more logical, I'm just saying that they are often seen that way by the general public. The point I'm making is that we need more people like you to step up and debunk what these people are saying, and bring a logical discussion to the table. Because right now, all I'm seeing from the left (at least on the internet-- I'm not talking about the well-known intellectuals like Chomsky, Krugman, and Zinn) is just whining, bickering, and name-calling, and I know that Liberals are better than that. I would encourage you to visit some of the conservative subreddits and argue your points there, because like I said in my original post, the right-wing thinks that all of our arguments come from our emotions and we need to convince them that that's not true."

But that being said, Vox.com tends to be quite wonky in its arguments as are Paul Krugman's articles on the NY times site.  You'll find good individual articles on Talking Points Memo, Daily Kos, and other traditionally liberal sites, but its important to keep in mind that those tend to be opinion based.  I find that liberal arguments tend not be be reducible to a bumper sticker statement; they tend to require nuanced thought and evidence to be taken seriously.  Emotional statements can sometimes become a shorthand for that underlying logic, but its important not to strawman all liberal thinking as unfounded."

Conservative ideas about economics, social welfare, and international relations is ungrounded in reality, it is simply taken on faith.  Take Kansas.  Governor Brownback argued that he would prove that conservative economic principles work by cutting taxes on corporations and the wealthy.  The result is a massive deficit forcing terrible cuts to the state budget, but are Republicans in the state deterred?  Of course not.  Brownback was handily reelected and he refuses to even consider that his policies have failed to work.  Obamacare is another example.  After nearly 18 months in force, it is proving to reduce the uninsured rate without harming the economy and is in fact coming in significantly under budget, yet Republicans still insist it's job killing socialized medicine and unaffordable.  This isn't necessarily all Republicans, but it's a lot. You sometimes see this referred to as the crazification factor.

The first reply in this thread just gave you a massive list of mainstream conservative beliefs which are completely emotion-based. I'd love to see you (or anyone else) post an equivalent list of mainstream liberal beliefs which are equally emotion based. My implication is that anyone undertaking that task will have a very hard time doing so.

Second of all, I never said that our beliefs themselves are emotion based, I stated that sometimes the way we argue them can be emotion based. For example, ""If you dislike Obama then you're a racist!"", ""How could you be so heartless to say poor people don't deserve welfare?"", ""Conservatives are evil and greedy!"". I may be exaggerating a little, but this is basically how I have seen some liberals argue. Logically, the things that we are fighting for make perfect sense, I'm not denying that. But some of us really need to rethink our methods of debate.   So don't get butthurt just because I pointed out a possible flaw that some liberals have. Don't act like I'm just criticizing liberals for no reason. I'm on your side.

My rule of thumb is if the article title contains the word destroys, slams, obliterates, or a count of something like ""10 times x did y"", I treat it as propaganda.  The title might as well be ""never mind the facts, here's why you should be angry."" The only sane way to parse the madness is to read the articles they cite for their outrage....on either side of the political divide.  Too many people on both sides let these websites and blogs form their opinions for them with out ever actually reading the factual source.    I subscribe to both /r/conservative and /r/liberal and while I have found the the subscribers of the former will usually believe anything, illustrated by the multiple times I have pointed out that they have been enraged by satire....again, folks on the left are not above getting bent out of shape about some non issue wrapped up in some rhetoric.   The point is, if you want to be informed and form your own ideals and opinions and not have them spoon fed to you, you will likely have to do some digging.  And do some real fact checking on those conservative ""facts"" they use to back up their ""logical"" arguments. Seriously, take a stroll through my comment history.  A good chunk of it is calling BS on posts in that sub.   The funny thing is, I lean left...depending on who you talk to maybe even far left.

I don't want to give up hope on this country just yet (I'm still in high school, I want to try and stay optimistic for at least a few years)"

I mean, seriously if politicians can get excessive campaign funding, let's just start a crowd-sourced campaign for studying climate change."
Liberal,356gv6,cj5,4,Thu May 7 15:56:22 2015 UTC,"I was performing research in new photovoltaic technology. Specifically I was working on exciton and polaron theory in organic photovoltaic devices.  They exhibit strong vibronic coupling, and so my work is also easily applicable to perovskite solar devices as well.  I have moved to the Denver area recently after I got my Ph.D because my fiance' has always wanted to live here.  So far one professor at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden and two at CU Boulder who work along these same lines have told me, after I presented my work to them, that they would love to work with me.  However since NSF and DoE funding for such research has been cut, they simply don't have the money to hire me.  If I started a gofundme to raise the money myself to work with one of these men, how much would you donate?"
Liberal,356gv6,Dixzon,1 point,Thu May 7 16:06:43 2015 UTC,"Well for one, I am in no financial position to donate large sums, but if I was, I would not hesitate to do so. But to answer your question, $100.00  Scientists need to stop depending on government funding. It's apparent that corporations lobby til no end D.C., in order to get anything that goes against their profits, by simply defunding it. If we were to fight money, we fight it with money. There are plenty fo businesses out there that benefit from reducing the negative effects of climate change, so I recommend that scientists approach these companies. The biggest one I can think of is Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, who stands to benefit the most from effective climate change policies, because it basically would shut down their old world competitors. Look to Google, who supports sustainable resources to run its infrastructure. They're out there, so those of us who want to succeed at fighting ignorant greed, need to fight money with money!  It's a cold harsh reality to those who have been sitting pretty for 100 years, but money needs to start wising up, and stop destroying our economy."
Liberal,356gv6,cj5,3,Thu May 7 16:20:30 2015 UTC,"I have been considering doing something like this anyway, and contacting wealthy people who do care about the environment to ask for a donation. I think I might just do that now.  I saw that Mark Ruffalo is on reddit now, and I also saw that he is vehemently opposed to Koch brother style manipulations you mentioned.  The situation with the government right now is just so frustrating.  All I need is a salary and a computer, since my work is theoretical.  But even with those scant few resources I would publish every year and generate a lot of scientific knowledge.  All of science funding including NASA makes up 2% of the budget.  You could literally cut all of it and not make a dent in the deficit.  And most research funding these days comes from the government, so it would of course be disastrous if you were to cut all of it.  Meanwhile the same government considers 2 trillion spent on a war in Iraq that accomplished nothing except creating ISIS as money well spent.  Farnsworth said it best"

Finally, someone with a enormous sense of sound reason. Yes, yes, yes. I just cannot understand how $2 trillion on a oil security mission is a better investment than, investing in creating more options for civilization as whole. Who are these people to halt research? Why is it that learning more about our existence is set so far behind destroying it?"
Liberal,356gv6,cj5,2,Thu May 7 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"Well, for what it's worth, Monsanto had its own scientists look into it, and they were categorical: man-made global warming is real, and happening."
