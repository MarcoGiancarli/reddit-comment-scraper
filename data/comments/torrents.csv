And once again to add to this you could then setup a 'managed host' through a service like https://www.noip.com/. This is handy if your external IP address is changed by your ISP from time to time as it updates your host (which could be something along the lines of host.noip.me).  So instead of your external IP address in the transdroid settings it would be host.noip.me (or whatever your personal host would be).

EDIT:Yes I know, non-conform but there are plenty out there.    MP4 is is a container that supports a very narrow selection of audio/video streams. MKV is a general purpose container that is meant to accept any/all media streams for maximum compatibility.    Still to this day there are uses where MP4 is easier (not better) but this is quickly diminishing as it is mostly paid content distributors and users with old hardware/software who are using MP4.    Some perspective: mpeg-4 part something was awesome in the late 90s xvid/divx were awesome in the 00s mkv is awesome in the 10s ??? will be awesome in the 20s"

Another notable difference is the difference in chapters and subtitles. MKV supports many more formats for both of these as well. Also adding multiple audio tracks of different codecs is as simple as shoving them into the MKV.   Just because its not natively supported on windows doesn't mean its not honestly the best media container. I personally love it and wish ALL media came in MKV."

What device can't play an MKV file in this day and age? I've not run into one.   TL:DR: .mkv why?! It works on practically nothing that it needs to, and it's always shit quality anyways.   This statement is wrong on many levels. I'm not sure what your hostility to MKVs is stemming from?  I'm not too eductated on this issue, but I'm pretty sure that MKV is a lot more allowing for different codecs, subtitle combos, etc. that make it better for a wide variety of users.

torrents,3e1cjh,Shepherd7X,-2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:44 2015 UTC,"This is a bit offtopic, but the real reason is fairly simple. The .mkv format is seen by the community as being ""cool"" and a mark of a clued up user. This is mostly because it is less widely supported, and can be harder to use than the more mainstream container formats. In communities like the movie/episode piracy community, technical merit is only one of two requirements on a technology - the other is community perception.  I've been far away from that community for a long time, and the culture may have changed, but the use of some formats rather than others as a ""secret handshake"" was fairly common. One example is .mp2 - some groups used it long after MP3 was shown to be technically superior. I know other regulars around here have a history in the scene, and probably have similar experiences.    This describes .mkv perfectly. And to be honest... it pisses me off WAY MORE than is socially acceptable.   Why does it have to be this way? It's so dumb..."

( that's why most seedbox provider don't allow those tracker on their bandwidth) ptp users also got when peer stealing happened few months ago."

torrents,3dugl0,Manky_Dingo,7,Mon Jul 20 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"The biggest one for me is: no torrent traffic on your home line by using a seedbox. The seedbox  should be in another country other than where you live, preferably in another continent."
torrents,3dugl0,culdesacked,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:49:50 2015 UTC,"The seedbox should be in another country other than where you live, preferably in another continent.   I think this should be explained further. I wouldn't say there is a definite need for a seedbox to be in a different country/continent that being said it should be in a country which are more tolerant of torrenting/p2p/privacy for example Holland, Sweden.  You will find a lot of seedbox providers are based in Holland for this reason."
torrents,3dugl0,KTIDsco,11,Mon Jul 20 10:06:37 2015 UTC,"Safest way: DO All of this on someone else's Internet network!!!!!!!!!!!! .......... Use cash to buy a laptop of Craigslist and have someone you know pick it up for you, wipe the laptop, install tails, use tails and tor to access Craigslist again, buy a second laptop and have a different person pick it up, wipe this laptop too, install tails, buy Bitcoins through local Bitcoins, have someone who you don't even know pick them up, send these Bitcoins through tumblers for around a month so they are good and unanimous, purchase a subscription to Private Internet access through tor on your second tails computer using Bitcoins. Now gain access to a private tracker, again through tor/tails/and now vpn. Lastly torrent on your tails machine, through the vpn with heavy encryption (still on someone else's network). Switch the network you are using, and vpn location as often as you can. This method will leave you close to untraceable, of course anyone in this day and age if they put there mind to it can track you down, but this method will most likely stump even the most agressive copyright troll."

torrents,3dugl0,Quatr0,16,Mon Jul 20 03:13:40 2015 UTC,The safest? Private tracker + seedbox + VPN + SFTP.  Safest for public tracker: any paid VPN with a killswitch and DNS leak protection.
torrents,3dugl0,Shepherd7X,6,Sun Jul 19 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly a VPN should be enough to protect you. All the other stuff is like adding multiple locks to a door. One will do the trick, however it doesn't hurt to add more."
torrents,3dugl0,mrkrabz1991,3,Sun Jul 19 20:31:50 2015 UTC,Even safer would be a laptop used only on public WiFi and never turned on anywhere near your home.  But that might be a bit extreme.
torrents,3dugl0,zman0900,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:24:55 2015 UTC,"I know this thread is about ""the safest"" behavior, however I've always wondered why people care about DNS leak protection for copyright infringement. When you download a torrent, you're going to ask for DNS resolution (the IP address to use) for kat.cr, tracker.publicbt.com, that kind of thing. Just wanting to resolve those names doesn't implicate you in anything. You could have just been pinging them."
torrents,3dugl0,tvtb,-6,Mon Jul 20 02:06:33 2015 UTC,You call private trackers safe? Best of luck. Its like going naked to private party where you think everyone will be your friends and just suddenly someone takes out his mobile and click your nude pics and post it online.

torrents,3dugl0,iaTeALL,8,Sun Jul 19 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"Okay here's a challenge for you. Download the top 100 on a public tracker and the top 100 on a private tracker, without masking your IP, and tell me which one you get a copyright notice on."

torrents,3dugl0,Inmute,0,Mon Jul 20 04:08:45 2015 UTC,I'm downloading from top 100 since last 4 years. And guess what!  I  upload too sometimes on tpb etc. Without masking the damn IP. My point is you are moving to private trackers due to so-called surveillance of copyright ghouls in public by thinking you'll become mutant. And you think on private tracker no one will know anything what you'll download. Ha that's saying like incident never happened because you didn't see it. A frog of well think no one know what he'll do but that's what he think. Think buddy. Piracy MUST come with privacy. PRIVACY. Those golden words are life blood of every internet jerk but people fail to follow it when it's real necessesty comes in.

Those golden words are life blood of every internet jerk but people fail to follow it when it's real necessesty comes in.   I use private trackers with a seedbox, how is that not enough privacy? You're the one uploading to public trackers with no protection. You seem to be hostile towards private trackers for no apparent reason."
torrents,3dugl0,Shepherd7X,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:24:08 2015 UTC,"Okay let me give two examples  When you use Facebook you have the liberty to hide from whom you want to show your activity and from whom you prefer to hidden but but staff can see everything Mr. Zuckerberg can see everything. Didn't he? There's very beautiful proverb in marketing ""if you are not paying for service than you are product "" yes you are. You sign-up tracker sometimes bother to read their user agreement   Sub example   Read bitme's agreement. They have clearly written that  that BitMe.ORG is authorized to act on behalf of the owners of the exclusive rights which are being infringed as set out in the notification.   Which means if MAFIAA found anything infringed stuff on their tracker than they will simply handover them your IP not the IP of your seedbox but your IP from which you had uploaded the content not from where you have seeded. Practically thats why they dont allow MPAA RIAA cintent. .bz network (theplace.bz, thegeeks Bz etc) also remove content related to DMCA, EUCD so basically your socall private trackers are under continous survelliance evn if you think you have becime 'mutant' grow up.   And 2nd example  You know in country how farmers catch their stray sheeps from the fields. They actually block evry other path and send their dogs after them and first sheep (usually most fearful and timid) sheep sees one path and go there and other start follow her (coz they are sheep) and than whole flock of sheep struck in cage ( which at one time they thought was a path of their liberty). now you only need to replace the words with your best intelligence and try to heed on it. Otherwise best of luck with 'your private top 100'.  P.s: sometimes wonder why wcd removed Salinger's unpublished work and why they don't allow to reup.   Edit: ignore the grammar mistakes and typos I'm on mobile. But you'll get the idea what I'm trying say if you are 'enlighted'!  P.s. 1: at least when using VPN your IP got unmasked due to some technical glitches than you can sue your VPN provider but if tracker got 'infringed' and you go naked than believe me you won't be having any place to hid.  Another example: when oink was raided then every oink users in U.K got letters from their isps to stop doin g piracy. (Torrenfreak)  So piracy with privacy GOOD  Otherwise you are even more exposed in private tracker comparing in public."

torrents,3dugl0,Impaled_,7,Mon Jul 20 10:42:33 2015 UTC,"do you want a conventional setup or unconventional?   I always get shit on by other posters for this, but IMO the only way to make sure you never get caught is to use a clean laptop wholly dedicated to torrenting (no accessing email or similar on it), a powerful wifi dongle/adapter, antenna aiming software, a long range wifi yagi antenna and an unsecure or public wifi source that is not your own. Having your own vehicle too you can use to hide said setup if you dont have an unsecure or public wifi source in reach of your antenna from your residence.   Basically you set this all up in your vehicle, hidden so that you can go shopping while you download torrents.   Yes, it is unconventional, doesnt require paying for a VPN, using tor, etc etc... but it is the only TRUE way to torrent without getting caught.   IMO you gotta go the extra mile if you want true anonymity when torrenting things that will likely get you caught."

torrents,3dugl0,dirtymoney,-6,Sun Jul 19 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"No, the method matters, at least to me.  If you're so greedy that you won't pay for your media and instead pirate and risk getting businesses and other individuals sent letters from copyright trolls, it makes you an asshole.  Let's not kid ourselves that downloading copyrighted material on your own connection with a VPN is the same as stealing somebody's bandwidth to do your dirty work.  There are many reasons for downloading copyrighted content that have more to do with availability and georestrictions than just beign cheap.  If you're going to be a pirate then at least have some balls, intelligence and empathy not to do it on other people's connections."
torrents,3dugl0,blindpet,5,Sun Jul 19 17:04:17 2015 UTC,are businesses and private people legally obligated to protect their wifi from illicit use like torrenting?  because if not they'll simply throw such letters a  in the garbage and forget about them as the copyright trolls won't be able to prove anything.
torrents,3dugl0,evgenetic,-4,Sun Jul 19 17:17:19 2015 UTC,The end legal result is not what I'm concerned about if the threat turns out to be benign. If you are stealing some Grandma's internet she could have a fucking heart attack when she gets a legal letter. Then Grandma dies cause some cheap pussy wouldn't VPN on his own connection.

torrents,3dvkat,pjcnet,2,Sun Jul 19 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"Services that convert torrents to direct links are like having a tiny free seedbox that normally isn't close to being big enough for even 1 good quality movie and wouldn't be big enough for much more than music downloads, but also beware of any service that claims to offer you security and/or privacy when it's a free service as they need to pay for the service from somewhere. Are they selling your information for instance, are they advertising or perhaps they're only offering a very poor and/or restricted free service to plug their paid service? Do they keep logs as they probably do and a free service will normal hand over your real information on request by copyright trolls in seconds. Edit: You will most probably find a free service very slow too.  Either get a paid VPN that doesn't keep logs (recommended more for public trackers - always check the rules if using with private trackers as many don't allow them for accessing their website and a couple don't allow them at all) or a decent secure seedbox (recommended more for private trackers - many don't allow public trackers or they severely throttle upload speeds)."
