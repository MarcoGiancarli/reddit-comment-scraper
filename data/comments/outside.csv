Having played for years thinking the game was populated solely by NPCs, I discovered another player after unlocking co-op play, and sufficiently leveling up the relationship skill. If you grind the relationship skill to the marriage skill, and then grind THAT skill successfully, you can unlock the respawn weapon. The respawn weapon is levelled up version of the sexual intercourse weapon, except it uses live ammunition. (Using the sexual intercourse weapon without having first learning how manage the ammunition is not recommended based on my observation of other NPCs) Using live ammunition allows you to make copies of you and the other player's original OS and hardware, and then you have to load appropriate apps, prevent malware, and eventually allow the new player to filter spam for themselves.  Leading this clan with the player partner in ""parent"" class through lengthy co-op campaigns for over 15 years now has been easily the most rewarding part of playing Outside.  Some players believe that successfully managing the clan skill long enough allows you to actually save your player when Outside crashes, but i have not actually experienced myself. It has been my experience that the respawned players are players unto themselves and not true copies, although with many of the same ATTs.  Personally, i was not aware of my membership in a previous clan until after i had really established my own.   TLDR: By grinding the relationship skill, you can unlock Co-op and discover other players, generate other playable characters, and even form and manage clans.    Edits: grammar, discovery of the recursive nature of the clan upgrade."

But on the other hand, it's as close to a single player experience as I can imagine, and I'm impressed with how well they can pull it off sometimes.

outside,3dn9ev,Pineapple26,4,Sat Jul 18 03:27:05 2015 UTC,"Although my classes are common ones, a combination of these classes is very rare - I'm playing as a programmer/theatrical actor multiclass. Many people have the false belief that there aren't many synergy bonuses (as you would have with, say, a carpenter/electrician multiclass) or that it makes for a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none situation, but I've discovered this isn't quite true. The downside of being either just a programmer or just an actor is that you tend toward certain idealogical extremes. You also tend to focus on the abilities that relate to your specific class, while totally ignoring those that don't (for example, actors tend toward boosting Social, Wisdom, and Athletics, while totally ignoring Logic). Multiclassing in two classes with opposing tendencies of extremes has an interesting way of enhancing your abilities in both.  The perks of this multiclass include having financial stability while also being a creative class; you receive synergetic diplomatic bonuses when interacting with almost any other class because you are sure to find some common ground somewhere; you get insanely broken bonuses to team-related abilities and leadership because you tend to have a broader view and grasp the bigger picture, you have great organizational and logical abilities from the programmer class, and a very high social stat from the acting class; the perks of the programmer class almost totally eliminate the traditional drawbacks of the creative classes (financial stability, upward mobility, ease of finding work); the perks of the actor class almost totally eliminate the traditional drawbacks of the programmer class (high-social-status job, new and interesting work everyday, fun, lots of social interaction, applause at the end of a days work).  This multiclass combination is a little min-maxy, bit I've found many good story and roleplay opportunities, so if your DM or a familial NPC tries to shut you down from going down this path (either because they think it is too overpowered or underpowered), you can ensure them that it will at least make the game interesting."

I entered the ""Publishing"" guild and got the ""Book Editor"" class. It is a very fun class, the gold output from the ""Regular Job"" questline is below average, but the thing about this class is that you get access to an alternate questline, called ""Freelance Works"", where you play an endless amount of mini-quests. If you do enough of those, you can skip the ""Regular Job"" questline altogether. Really gives you the feel of a sandbox class.  I also should mention that I had to spend a few skill points in the ""Design"" skill tree to be accepted on the guild, but I just got the ones that unlocked some mixed tree spells like ""Book Design"", I didn't venture further in that tree because the Design-related mini-quests are horrible, the NPCs are always telling you to do it all over again because they didn't like what you crafted. Seems to be a random chance thing and I still don't know which stat influences it.

You can spend gold to have someone from the Publishing guild to check your grammar (someone doing the ""Freelance Works"" alternate questline) before submiting it to the guild itself. And since your chances of getting the achievement are higher if you craft the book with a high grammar stat, spending a small amount of gold to hire another player to cast the Editing spell for you is a boost too good to be ignored, even if your Grammar stat is already high, it is a small investment that gives a huge boost to your chances. Other than that, just don't give up if you fail a few times when submiting the work you crafted to the Publishing guilds. The guilds are run by players after all, so there is no exact stat requirement during the crafting, sometimes the players are just picky for no reason, you should just keep trying in different Publishing guilds."

The disease was previously called dementia pugilistica (DP), i.e. ""punch-drunk"", as it was initially found in those with a history of boxing. CTE has been most commonly found in professional athletes participating in American football, ice hockey, professional wrestling and other contact sports who have experienced repetitive brain trauma. It has also been found in soldiers exposed to a blast or a concussive injury,  in both cases resulting in characteristic degeneration of brain tissue and the accumulation of tau protein.

It's very rough at first and some people have a tougher time than others building up DISCIPLINE (I was level 25 before I got any significant points into it) but it is paramount in successfully making a good and solid transition into ADULTHOOD. Don't try to push for things that require lots of DISCIPLINE right away instead start small like get better at a video game by training some aspect of it even though it isn't fun or get a routine in like doing 5 push-ups before bed.

Some players consider health points to be ""macronutrients"", which consist of the fat, protein, and carbohydrate stats. Apples tend to be high in the carb stat, low in the protein stat, and almost nothing in the fat stat.  A simplification of that system is the measurement of ""calories"". These provide energy to your character (that may or may not be immediately accessible) or mass if the energy is not used.  Other considerations are specific nutrient contents, such as vitamins and minerals. I'm not well versed enough in that topic to tell you an apple's stats, but they're generally thought of as having a high vitamin content.  If you're going on an intense quest, then I would guess that you're going to need access to a lot of energy for your character. Apples are a good way to get a quick boost of energy that is quickly depleted (look up the ""glycemic index"" mechanic and you'll see what I mean). If that's what you want, great.

The one most people believe in is God, and his son Jesus_Born_In_0. Nobody can decide if Jesus, the part-time devs (angels), and the ban manager, Evil_Satan, are part of the team.   Another, older belief has about 12 main devs (Jupiter being the head dev), and lots of part-timers. They had different names in different places, and God used a lot of their source code.   There's a belief called Buddhism in which the game has no devs, it just generated itself, and the code writes new features into itself with an advanced AI. This sometimes mingles with Hinduism, found in the same region, and Hindus believe that there's one very, very bipolar dev. He has lots of personalities, and a lot of them have been given names.  There are two beliefs (called ""religions"") very similar to Christianity, called Islam and Judaism, that believe in Allah_Akbar_570, and an anonymous dev. They're pretty much identical to Christianity, but Islam is a lot younger. Islamic clans have a reputation for killing lots of other players, but I think that's down to how young the religion is.

outside,3c2pdi,SpookyLlama,2,Fri Jul 17 23:00:59 2015 UTC,"I heard most of these items were originally placed in the game as joke items or FlavorEquipment. Before you try any, bear in mind:   They gave no actual stat increases (and sometimes even decrease certain stats). They can create a filter on the graphics that made it harder to see the world properly, including NPCs and AOEs. Many such substances placed a hidden addiction curse on the player which takes a lot of willpower to break (like, enough that most players simply don't have the stat that high) and can become a serious drain on gold and stats. Often being under the effects of such a substance, especially while doing some activities (driving, playing competitive sports) or even owning the items makes you a target for law enforcement guilds, which is the kind of PvP a lot of players prefer to avoid.   For all these reasons these consumables are not recommended, at least not for optimal play, and experienced minmaxers (who are not very experienced at making convincing ads...) leave the ads as tips for less experienced players.  But there are lots of ways to play the game, and a lot of players aren't really going for optimal play, and think fun filters and flavor equipment are actually the whole point. Just make sure you do your research on whatever you want to try so you're not surprised by a stat decrease or an unbreakable addiction curse."

They'll give you low level quests and jobs, like sitting on boards of local libraries and schools, and you can use the xp to unlock higher and higher missions (town, county, state, country).  The difficulty is in that low level quests don't have a gp reward, which can make it difficult if your class requires you to spend a lot of time grinding for gold.  Most people think that the choice of guild should be based on ideology, but really it's pretty arbitrary.  You'll be expected to tout the guild philosophy, but in action, you'll have tons of flexibility.  What's more important is the relative power of the opposing faction.  If you join the dominating local guild, you might find it impossible to get entry-level quests without donating massive amounts of gp.  If you join the underdog, you'll find entry-level quests to be much easier, but breaking past the opposition in higher level quests becomes much harder.  Helpful skills to have maxed out to pursue the class are ambition, charisma and bluff.  It's also nice to have a genuine desire to do good, but not necessary."

Location on map will help, if you find a location where NPCs charge less money for repairs, like in the United Kingdom area they have a guild called NHS which is free repairs!!!  You can also start saving your gold inside of other players banks that are managed by NPCs. A better way to handle your spare gold is to spend it on other players guilds. They call it stocks or something.  If you have enough parts of guilds that grow, you can make more gold back which will help you retire faster.

A lot of the mishaps my character experienced were due to not really understanding how the characters interacted, and about halfway through I realized I had the difficulty setting on expert. I called home, used rosebud:;:;:;, and set the difficulty on novice. Lo and behold, a lot of my problems which I was experiencing disappeared, but gameplay became boring because the game wasn't really challenging anymore. I quit using the rosebud cheat and set the difficulty on medium.

I hadn't lved my STR stat at all before picking up the Swordsmanship skill, so I think it might have something to do with that.

However the fight was well worth the struggle, my Popularity stat increased tremendously, I also gained +2 to poison resistance from the bosses special attack.  However I'm now halfway to level 16, which is when I'll be able to take on the raid <Tenth Grade Camp>. I expect it to be Quite the difficult challenge compared to the last raid.  My favourite skill to grind is the Swordsmanship skill, specifically the Kendo Branch. I wen't through almost 6 levels before maxing out the Basic and Intermediate sections of the Branch, I haven't gone to the trainer since level 13, so It's taking quite a while to get through the advanced section, And at this rate, I have no hope of maxing out the branch completely all the way to Master. However the skill has improved my stats considerably.  Due to training the skill, my STR stat has tripled, maybe even quadrupled that of the average for my level, and my Reaction Time as well as Stopping Power stats are also quite high.

I saw a couple of signs that said it was dangerous, but I figured that large dogs were too and I'd already conquered those so I'd give it a shot. As I approached the bison it started snorting, just like a horse, so I just backed away.  When one had its back turned, I walked up beside it and put my hand along its side like a horse. It snorted a bit and started to freak out, so I decided then was the time to get on.  I jumped on it and it started bucking like wild. It managed to throw me off, and then decided to run at me.  I had gotten up by then, and decided that I knew how to handle this. As it approached, I put my hands on its head and was going to launch myself onto its back and do a backflip-spin to land correctly.  Next thing I knew I woke up at a healing center. Some of my money was taken and I lost some of my stats from the encounter, but my Fame rose (maybe my Infamy too). I got in the local paper and even got on a warning sign in Yellowstone. I thought this would help me connect with other parties but it didn't work out that way.  Not worth it, but a great story! I should've spent more time leveling up on the horse before trying for the bison. I was really hoping to jump up to Grizzly Bear and Moose soon after, but it just didn't work out that way.

Occasionally, the game's world will cease to render altogether, putting your avatar in a perpetually falling animation, but from the perspective of other players your avatar is left in the game world controlled by a computer. It's rudimentary AI, and very easy for griefers to exploit.  It's supposed to be a neat feature, and some players have an easier time rendering the effect than others, especially those in the RUS or EU2-3 servers, but I'd advise trying not to stack the effect so high in the future."

Just keep in mind that the only format that makes sense mathematically is 1.YYYY.MM.DD  That is, the only format they can be in where every daily patch would always result in a higher numeric value of the version for Outside.  For example, if it is Jan 1, 2015: 1.2015.1.1 And then the next day on Jan 2, the current version would be: 1.2015.1.2 (a higher value and thus a logical new version number)  However, following the European date format, January 1, 2015 would be represented as: 1.2015.1.1 January 2 would be: 1.2015.2.1 February 1 would be 1.2015.1.2  Which is actually a smaller number than the number representing January 2. This makes that numbering format very confusing and inconsistent."
outside,37xxe7,dc-russ,6,Tue Jun 16 04:06:46 2015 UTC,I prefer to use a weekly version system similar to OP. e.g the current patch at the time of writing is 2015.22; simpler and neater. You could also append a 'w' at the end to differentiate from other formats.  Although the standard seems to be Millennia.Century.Decade.Year.

outside,37xxe7,SemanticDisambiguity,4,Sat Jun 13 19:05:51 2015 UTC,I believe that's what the 'ISO-8601' format clarified although not all players respect that plug-in. Requiring players to utilize the 'ISO-8601' plug-in would ensure the patch levels and date values are properly displayed as YYYY.MM.DD and we could then proceed that with 0 for beta or 1 for alpha.

Now the spinning is caused by the rotation of the bullet as it is fired through the gun.  So recap, bullet spins from gun and get's hot, hits cold ice and starts to ""bounce"" as it is spinning."

This could only happen with water at very low pressures, and even then I don't think it could cause the bullet to act in this way, but I don't know enough about fluids to be sure. It's much more likely that it's just the really low friction doesn't stop the bullet spinning, and it jumps around because of imperfections on it's surface and the surface of the ice."

outside,37goru,Matech,8,Sat Jun 6 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"The ""Illuminati"" of today is just a popular misappropriated name given to the ruling globalist warmongering elite. Those are not mythical creatures, but regular players themselves. Some of them are publicly known, such as George W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, Jacob Rothschild, etc. They don't control all player events serverwide, but they strive to, by creating a World Government. Do some research and you will be able to understand their agenda."
outside,37goru,cannabinoid420,3,Wed Jun 3 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"There's a ton of rumors surrounding them, most of which are baseless.  They were a social guild that sprung up in the Bavaria region (now a sub-region of Germany), and were dedicated to spreading ideals of free thought and gender equality.  They were forcefully disbanded somewhere between Version 1.0 build 1785 and build 1816 due to opposition to and from the leadership of Bavaria's governing guild and failure to meet their regulations on social guilds.  A ton of modern guilds claim to have roots in the original Illuminati guild, but they're mostly just social clubs.  They don't have any real social or political power, they're just around for people to hang out, get drunk, and talk politics."

outside,37goru,SockN1nja,3,Mon Jun 8 22:01:54 2015 UTC,"Don't think of it as leveling your ""Conspiracy"" skill, but rather your ""Critical Thinking"" skill, by doing your research (seeing different, alternative point of views) and drawing your own conclusions. Many conspiracies are crazy, so you have to tread carefully. Look not only to the conspiracies but also to the whistleblowers and public actions from the government and corporations. And given the way the world is heading, I would greatly recommend that you join this faction (if you have the required power, of course). Always better to side with the winners."
outside,37goru,_Bussey_,2,Tue Jun 9 21:23:18 2015 UTC,"The illuminati is one of the original clans founded in the early alpha. Instead of partaking in the aggressive melee tournaments that were popular back then, they took a more secretive and diplomatic approach to the game, starting wars between larger guilds and using physics exploits to further scientific progress. Nowdays, Outside is less combat oriented and more focused on politics and diplomacy, the Illuminati are able to flourish and easily control the higher positions without people being able to gather intel on them. Not much is known about them, but you can find more info here.  EDIT: Turns out they have a website"

Although you may not be able to start the quest (or turn it in for that matter), you can FINISH NEARLY ALL of the quest without even starting it. What's more is that this is true for nearly all quests in the game, but people don't realize it. You need to be proactive, be motivated and disciplined, and you will gain so much more experience than those who wait for the quests to open up.  Visit us at r/languagelearning!!!"

outside,3718j0,heychrisfox,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:37:31 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about just general skill quests in learning more of the skills required to complete it, or are you talking specialty career quests? Because if you're talking about the latter, that's not a bug. There are lots of people wanting to join those questlines, and there are limited players offering slots to fill. It will make any questline highly competitive, and your skills will need to be A+ to get another player's attention."

Go with a different specialization, it's more worth your time.  You might still want to research the ""language"" tree, though."

Perhaps if it's for the money quest, you can delegate this skill, but make sure you've tested their Loyalty EXP."

I enjoyed it a lot more than some of the other grinds in the game. It's almost kind of an art rather than a grind. Some of the quests are really simple and boring, but the main ones are pretty enjoyable, again, if you like the grind.  Oh, and it's worth getting the special achievements.

My INT is high enough but my Focus isn't so I keep getting distracted with trying to level other skills.
outside,3718j0,j0ej0em0nkey,1 point,Thu May 28 18:31:39 2015 UTC,I have heard that this quest is actually easier at lower levels and less INT and Focus are needed. I'm thinking this might be your issue. I suggest you reevaluate the quest and if you really want to complete it invest plenty of points in the Focus skill and maybe even some into INT while holding off on some other skills.

I am satisfied with my progress thus far as I have enough completed to engage in small talk with other players of the same specialization. I'm re-evaluating how far into this specialization I want to go as it isn't something heavily used in my primary map area."
