syriancivilwar,3e2xkl,strawberry_SON,0,Tue Jul 21 15:45:04 2015 UTC,"Not in Iraq and Syria. People are routinely paying thousands of dollars for an $800 Colt M-4. AKs are going for as high as $2000 a piece in northern Syria. We've seen bullet prices surge to $2 a round for 7.62x39 (that was a year ago, no idea if it's settled since then). ""Normal"" gun prices don't exist in Iraq and Syria.  What I'm really wondering is where he's getting a steady source of 5.45x39 ammo for that rifle. That's not a common round in Syria at all and even the government only stocks a minimal amount. Though we did see some 50+ AK74s get captured in Mastoumeh...  Anyway, what a franken-gun. Terrible paint job. Foregrip from an AKM. Oversized nightsight."

Not having any direct or indirect links to terrorist groups -- but then Isil and Ahrar ash Sham are not terrorist groups they're Syrian patriots fighting the illegitimate Nusayri regime.  It's not part of official policy to maintain links to those groups, but they turn a blind eye to Turkish patriots supporting the downfall of Assad through providing arms, finance, meeting quarters, and critical intelligence info to terrorist groups.  Just like how Putin cannot control the patriotism of Russian military personnel vacationing in Ukraine.  The Turkish government needs to take a clear and unambiguous stance -- anyone found supporting terrorist groups and rebel groups will face prison time and their assets seized. Absolutely no exceptions, not from the border guards all the way to the highest levels of government.  Yes that includes supporters of PKK, a known terrorist group that has no qualms with using random violence to achieve their means.  The Kurds have a political outlet now -- the HDP. If they want to remain a legitimate authority in Turkish politics then they need to rally around the HDP instead of the PKK."

AKP lost a whole lot of kurdish voters over the Syria/ Rojava situation. Those votes won't come back anytime soon. AKP will focus on the Turkish right probably, and those don't want to give a quarter to the Kurds.  Also if they coalition with MHP, they will probably go on an anti-kurdish course. AKP being challenged in their power will in my opinion lead to a harder course of the Turkish government on the Kurds.  But, we'll see. I just think that the Kurds (and the Turkish left) should be ready to defend themselves eventually."
syriancivilwar,3e27fa,Beansareno1,3,Tue Jul 21 18:47:21 2015 UTC,"Erdogan does not want the Kurds to achieve legitimacy through peaceful diplomatic means. The HDP is Erdogan's worst nightmare because the Kurds are gaining international acceptance as they move away from the PKK. The world is awakening to the reality that Erdogan is not the right guy for a unified, peaceful, functional and cooperative Turkey. If the PKK lashes out it will set back the peaceful progress made by those supporting the HDP and it could actually grant Erdogan's regime more international sympathy. If Kurds can keep their composure Erdogan will only get more desperate and more elaborate in his attacks until he slips up."

I'd wager the mortar rounds were to have their fuses removed (or simply have the round drilled) and then packed in a container full of fragmentation materials.  Mortar rounds are, possibly, a good vehicle for transporting HEs. You've got a relatively inert explosive (especially if you remove the fuse). It's not the most dimensionaly efficient way to move, but it definitely beats any Daesh packaging methods, so I say they're easy to smuggle.  You've also got a shell that will fragment (and vaporize.)"

You are correct that killing them outright would only motivate others in the future to fight to the death and possibly inspire further recruitment. Keep in mind that these guys also believe that paradise is waiting on the other side of death so they may very well except a death sentence as a positive step towards that end.

ISIS/L can only get so far with blood sacrifice, its a propaganda tactic that appeals to the lunatic fringe, whilst the majority of Muslims might like Sharia, they don't want blood sacrifice and torture in the streets, sadists wallowing in the brutality of it, distributed through glossy videos.  What AAS are doing is very clever, they're saying western paradigm of the nation state won't work, strongmen dictators only cover up the problem and worst of all they allow the cancer of Da3sh to grow inside it. They're presenting themselves as a palatable Pan-Sunni alternative to a brutal authoritarian or a gang of perverse and sadistic lunatics."

Beyond the distaste for his politics I never had a great deal of respect for Bush Sr.'s son, George W.

In contrast however, 600 barrel bombs have dropped on Zabadani. 200 people have died in barrel bombing incidents over the past 15 days (a brief subreddit search and twitter search). Thousands of people a year are killed in barrel bombing raids.  Sectarian shelling is disgusting and those 7 people, be they SAA or civilians don't deserve to be targeted for their religion.  But neither do the tens of thousands of civilians the Syrian government had chosen to indiscriminately target when they lob 1,000  lb tubs of explosives into neighborhood after neighborhood. You won't find any excuse making from me over choosing to shell a civilian area without a clear intention to hit specific military targets. But you certainly won't find me equating that same shelling, which has resulted in 7 casualties with the systemic policy of terror bombing. Because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if your child/brother/mother/friend died from sectarian mortar shell or a totalitarian barrel bomb. All that matters is they're dead.

Any settler-colonial nation (US, Canada, Australia, Israel) has had far more ethnic cleansing than Russia. Especially if you're talking about the ""nation"". Almost all ethnic cleansing took place under the Stalinist dictatorship during or around WWII, when small ethnic groups deemed disloyal were moved and dispossessed. The Russian nation didn't vote for it - the Politburo, which was explicitly anti-nationalist and driven by a German/European ideology, decided it by itself. There hasn't been justice for the targeted groups, but they have been able to return home or migrate freely throughout the country ever since the end of the USSR.  Whether one should ally with Russia is a separate question and it highly depends on other circumstances, but anti-Russian propaganda and prejudice shouldn't be the deciding factor."

syriancivilwar,3e1tai,Neosantana,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"Did you read the rest of my post? How does that history make Russians ""10x more barbaric"" today?  Bringing up the Ainu shows you're not serious. There were literally only a few hundred Ainu in Russian/Soviet territory. In the 19th century, they were classified as a related ethnic group because Japan claimed hegemony over the Ainu and their territory. Calling that ethnic cleansing is really watering down the definition.  The Adyghe* and Circassians were conquered, expelled, and abused. I make no excuses for that. But that was in the middle of the 19th century when brutal imperialist wars were common and kosher. Today the remaining Adyghe in Russia have an autonomous Republic run by Sunni Adyghe politicians.  Americans were fighting natives into the 1910s-20s. Canadians and Australians were kidnapping native children only a few decades ago. Israelis claim the full right to carry out ethnic cleansing to this day. And yet Russians are ""10x more barbaric"" as a nation."

The Ainu were kicked out of their islands when the Soviets took over control of Sakhalin from the Japanese Empire.   Israel has shit policy and everyone knows that. The United States was built on butchery and they don't deny that. The Soviet Union was far larger and included far more cultures and was far more recent, and seeing as how the Russian Federation is the only real successor state to the Soviet Union while sweeping all the atrocities under the rug, excuse me if I show massive distrust towards them, especially under the rule of Putin.   The shit that the Soviets did was on a whole different scale."

syriancivilwar,3e2igl,TanDeng,5,Tue Jul 21 13:31:42 2015 UTC,SAA has more armored vehicles and aircrafts. they have been around longer while the Iraqi army is brand new. but the iraqi army has more potential.
syriancivilwar,3e2igl,DickCheneyProfited1b,5,Tue Jul 21 13:42:48 2015 UTC,I would have to say the SAA. Unlike the Iraqis they don't have western airstrikes and intel helping them. When they want to take out a suicide truck bomb they have to use an RPG which means allowing the truck to get close enough to kill the shooter and the spotter. They're also fighting an enemy that is actively being helped by western countries and neighbours. No doubt their positions and communications are being monitored.
syriancivilwar,3e2igl,sharklazers99,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:36 2015 UTC,When they want to take out a suicide truck bomb they have to use an RPG which means allowing the truck to get close enough to kill the shooter and the spotter.   Or the hundreds of aircraft they possess.  Or the thousands of ATGM missiles they possess.  Or the thousands of heavy machine guns and cannon they possess.  Or tremendous amount of anti-armor weapons they possess.  Or the tanks and armored vehicles with heavy cannon they possess.  They have literally ever single means of attacking SVBIEDs that the Iraqi army has.
syriancivilwar,3e2igl,LiesAboutKnowingYou,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:59 2015 UTC,"This, I think people severely underestimate the sheer incompetence of the SAA. the ISF is much much better than them.

syriancivilwar,3e2igl,Nmathmaster123,7,Tue Jul 21 17:26:27 2015 UTC,They don't have aircraft flying above every engagement and ones that can make a quick and precise hit. The biggest victims of Suicide trucks tend to be isolated and fortified positions. Places that aren't exactly full of well maintained tanks and ATGM missiles. These trucks don't just come out in a straight line as well. Sending a tank to take out a suicide truck is just asking for a rebel TOW/ATGM to shred it.  The American military thinks the best solution for the pesh merga and ISF to take these trucks out is to give them AT-4s. I don't see them teaching these guys how to use tanks to take out suicide trucks.
syriancivilwar,3e2igl,sharklazers99,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"They don't have aircraft flying above every engagement and ones that can make a quick and precise hit.   Neither does the ISF as evidenced by the numerous SVBIEDs that make it through. An SVBIED isn't an obvious target from the air and airstrikes tend to be either reactionary in nature or against pre-planned target, which as you might guess, doesn't usually involve a parking lot full of SVBIEDs.   The biggest victims of Suicide trucks tend to be isolated and fortified positions.    You mean the kind of places that should have excellent overwatch and positions of observation to see SVBIEDs headed towards their position so they have early warning to try and take it out?   Places that aren't exactly full of well maintained tanks and ATGM missiles.   Fortified positions aren't the kind of places where ATGMs necessary to prevent this kind of attack are located? Are you kidding me? Do you not remember Idlib? Every other position that got taken over had an ATGM system either still in the box or in various states of assembly. And that's LITERALLY how the SAA employs tanks. At a fortified positions to act as extra fire support ala ""mobile bunker"" concept. Again, evidenced by how many tanks are left sitting around when they positions are overrun. Qarmeed (the Brick Factory) was captured by use of two SVBIEDs coupled with shelling and infantry assault. Do you remember what they found when they captured Qarmeed? Because besides MILLIONS of rounds of ammunition, tank ammo, artillery and artillery ammo, they captured six intact tanks, Metis-M, Konkurs, and Kornet ATGM launchers and many missiles for each. The defense in depth of SAA positions EXPLICITLY involves using tanks and ATGMs for base defense.   These trucks don't just come out in a straight line as well. Sending a tank to take out a suicide truck is just asking for a rebel TOW/ATGM to shred it.   Yes, they do. When moving down a narrow street that's exactly what they do. They're generally WAY overloaded with explosives and armor and have limited mobility. Their purpose is to drive as fast as they can from Point of Origin to Point of Impact.   The American military thinks the best solution for the pesh merga and ISF to take these trucks out is to give them AT-4s. I don't see them teaching these guys how to use tanks to take out suicide trucks.   I'm gonna wager you don't see anything other than what you want to see. How on earth would you see the US military teaching them from your spot on the internet. And there isn't anything to teach. Once you've taught a tanker how to use the main gun and apply it towards tanks he knows exactly how to apply it to other vehicles. You point. And you fire.  Lots of excuses for why the SAA can't do the same things the ISF can do, not a lot of acknowledgement that the biggest problem here is the fact that the SAA simply isn't a competent military force and that's compounded by four plus years of war taking their toll on manpower, equipment, and morale."

syriancivilwar,3e2igl,Makaveli533,4,Tue Jul 21 14:54:52 2015 UTC,One of the main problems with the ISF is that sometimes they seem to lack the will to fight. Earlier on they used to flee from ISIS but they are started to make progress. I guess they had low morale due to their losses and the mass executions that happened.
syriancivilwar,3e2igl,Bacojyam,3,Tue Jul 21 13:47:02 2015 UTC,This is hardly any different than the SAA. Mass retreats and abandoning prepared and well stocked positions have become a hallmark of SAA defensive operations. That doesn't really differentiate the SAA from the ISF.

syriancivilwar,3e2igl,DickCheneyProfited1b,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. That's a corruption problem, not a lack of will on the part of the troops.  RE: Mosul. It was also a case of corruption and failures of command. A good article with primary sources:  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/14/us-mideast-crisis-gharawi-special-report-idUSKCN0I30Z820141014  In all, there were supposed to be close to 25,000 soldiers and police in the city; the reality, several local officials and security officers say, was at best 10,000. In the district of Musherfa, one of the city's main entry points, there were just 40 soldiers on duty the night of June 6.  As the militants infiltrated the city, they seized military vehicles and weapons. The sergeant based there said they also hanged soldiers and lit them ablaze, crucified them, and torched them on the hoods of Humvees.  On the western edge of Tamoz 17 neighborhood, police from the fourth battalion saw two Humvees and 15 pickup trucks approach, spraying machine gun fire.  ""In my entire battalion we have one machine gun. In each pickup they had one,"" said head of the battalion, Colonel Dhiyab Ahmed al-Assi al-Obeidi.  Gharawi ordered his forces to form a defensive line to cordon off the besieged western Mosul neighbourhoods from the Tigris River. Gharawi said he received a call from Maliki to hold things until the arrival of Qanbar, the deputy chief of staff at the defense ministry, and Ghaidan, who commanded Iraqi ground forces.  Qanbar is a member of Maliki's tribe, while Ghaidan had long assisted Maliki in security operations, according to senior officers and Iraqi officials. The two men outranked Gharawi and automatically took formal charge of the Mosul command on June 7.  On the morning of June 8, Gharawi met Nineveh governor Atheel Nujaifi. The governor was no friend – he had previously accused Gharawi of corruption, an allegation the general rejected.  Now the city's fate hinged on Gharawi. One of Nujaifi's advisers asked the general why he had not counter-attacked.  ""There are not enough forces,"" Gharawi told them.  General Babakir Zebari was Gharawi's superior and chief of staff for Iraq's armed forces back in Baghdad. He agrees there were not enough men to defeat the jihadists. And Maliki had already rejected a chance to change that.  On June 7, Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani had offered to send Kurdish peshmerga fighters to help. The offer went all the way up to Maliki, who rejected it twice through his defense minister, according to Zebari.  United Nations and U.S. diplomats also attempted to broker an arrangement acceptable to Maliki, who remained suspicious of the Kurds' intent. Maliki insisted there were more than enough Iraqi forces. Barzani's office confirmed Kurdish offers of help were rejected.  On the afternoon of June 8, the Islamic State surged. More than 100 vehicles, carrying at least 400 men, had crossed to Mosul from Syria since the start of the battle. Sleeper cells hiding in the city had been activated and neighbourhoods rallied to them, according to police and military.  The insurgents bombed a police station in the al-Uraybi neighborhood and charged into the area around the Mosul Hotel, an abandoned building on the western bank of the Tigris transformed into a battle post for 30 men from SWAT, an emergency police unit.  Gharawi and his federal police pounded Islamic State-controlled areas with artillery.  For a moment, ""the morale of Mosul got higher,"" Gharawi said.  Within hours, though, Gharawi's command was thrown into disarray. Multiple military sources say Ghaidan and Qanbar sacked a divisional commander after he refused to send men to defend the Mosul Hotel. The sacked general, who reported to Gharawi, theoretically commanded 6,000 men, though many were AWOL.  General Zebari calls the order another huge mistake: ""In crisis, you can't replace the commander."""

It means everything, of course it matters.  The difference in Hasakah is that the YPG is only a low-level opponent in this war, and at times even a co-belligerent, because while the government and YPG's ultimate goals for Syrian Kurdistan are irreconcilable, they are not for Syria as a whole (as the PYD does not have any pretense of national aspirations and will live within the Syrian Arab Republic or even a kind of Muslim Brotherhood rebel polity if only they are allowed autonomy).   This is becoming increasingly acceptable to the (Syrian) leadership as it's not at all an existential threat to long-term viability of Syria and may even be beneficial as if the Kurds of Syria and Iraq (and who knows if the PKK becomes restive again, maybe even parts of Turkey down the line) are intent on governing their own local affairs then accommodation with this ensures they remain out of the NATO-Western-Turkey orbit unlike Barzani's Erbil. It's obviously not the situation Syria would have ideally chose pre-war but war shatters ideals and renews focus on practical realities. And the reality here is that even though it would be a loss in the sense of territory 100% under central authority, it's just not much of a loss as this area is only of moderate value to Syria insofar as it is not used as a staging area against it in concert with hostile foreign regimes like the one in Turkey. YPG helping to clean ISIL from the Turkish border actually aids that.  In Iraqi Kurdistan President Assad has no control over influencing the course of events but in Syrian Kurdistan or what the Kurdish nationalists call their ""Rojava"", quality political maneuvering will ensure they're no threat to Syria in defense matters and in a geopolitical sense while being given the right to cultural and linguistic expression and embrace of traditional and new ways of living alike promoted by figures from their own community that they've earned."
syriancivilwar,3dzuxz,MachinaExDeus_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:38 2015 UTC,"The problem from Assad's point of view is that the PYD aren't really Kurdish nationalists. They've made it clear they will accept participants of any ethnicity or religion, which is why there are Yazidi and Arab tribal militias fighting alongside the YPG. A PYD autonomous zone in Northern Syria would become a magnet for anyone unhappy with Assad's rule, which considering he's a brutal oppressive dictator would be a lot of people. On top of that, supporting Kurds would complicate any attempt at reconciliation with Turkey. You could well be right that that's Assad's best case scenario right now, but it's hard to imagine him putting up with it any longer than he has to."

syriancivilwar,3e1zkk,Goldilocks-smile,3,Tue Jul 21 09:54:42 2015 UTC,"IS is the biggest threat to Syrian children. Sure, SAA are guilty of horrible war crimes indiscriminately bombing children, but IS actively targets and recruits them as an integral part of their ideology. The children are essential for IS to continue their state, indoctrinated and trained in Jihad in order to provide the next generation of front line soldiers. Their use of child soldiers isn't just widespread, it's absolutely everywhere in their 'state'. IS has an entire industry aimed at targeting and recruiting kids and has clamped down hard on education in order to reduce it to state-run indoctrination center.  It's pretty frightening. There's nothing we can do to stop besides eliminating IS militarily, but in doing so we'll have to fight many of these children themselves."

It's not rocket science.  It's amazing why so many remain blind to such a simple fact and expect Assad, at some time in the future to be able to bring the country together again.

syriancivilwar,3e0l2d,Balak_Jewboma,-23,Tue Jul 21 11:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not holding much faith in the SAA here. They're horrible at urban combat, and the only way that they'd even see a chance of success is if they put Tiger Forces and the Republican Guard into this attack. Which it looks like they're doing, so they're putting all their cards into this battle. They better not lose it, or else they better say goodbye to everything east of Homs."
syriancivilwar,3e0l2d,IgorForHire,6,Tue Jul 21 12:25:53 2015 UTC,"They have to cross a bunch of open territory with vehicles to get close first. Going to be extremely costly if ISIS has any supply of ATGMs in that city. They are also going to have some massive SVBIEDs for when they get close to, remember all those aerial dumb bombs they captured? Only one use for those now. I think the SAA can do it but they need to attack from at least 2 different sides of the city. It also has to be relatively fast operation because the SAA cant afford to be trapped out in the open over night far away from any bases."
syriancivilwar,3e0l2d,Balak_Jewboma,0,Tue Jul 21 04:13:30 2015 UTC,"Yep. There are only 2 ways that the SAA could possibly take the city. 1, through a months-long bloody battle which would devastate their special forces. And 2, a complete and utter IS withdrawal. The latter being very unlikely saying that the next defensive position is al-Sukhnah and that losing Tadmur would be an enormous propaganda defeat for them.   Chances are that IS still has a significant stock of artillery and ATGMs left to stop the SAA from taking Tadmur in full, and maybe once the SAA is exhausted, IS can finally put all their effort towards T4 airbase and cripple the SyAAF in the long term."
syriancivilwar,3e0l2d,fartwhat,-7,Tue Jul 21 04:27:46 2015 UTC,"Eh, I hope they fail. If it was Sinjar, Latakia, or Suwayda, I'd feel differently but Tadmur is a sunni town and if the SAA takes it they'll probably grab and execute ""collaborators"". Daesh has already done all the damage its going to do, so I'd rather the SAA fail and lose the ability to use T4 airbase.   Not a fan of Daesh, just think that nothing good will come of the SAA taking back Palmyra."
syriancivilwar,3e0l2d,degestani,0,Tue Jul 21 04:34:46 2015 UTC,Such a limited and sectarian view of things... Look at how ISIS managed to implant these sectarian thoughts even in far away Americans .... now imagine how successful they are with disgruntled locals.

syriancivilwar,3e0l2d,degestani,-2,Tue Jul 21 06:30:53 2015 UTC,You dont understand what happened in Houla and I am not really surprised at all.  And what Houla has to do with Palmyra is only known to you.

syriancivilwar,3e0l2d,Balak_Jewboma,14,Tue Jul 21 16:27:52 2015 UTC,"Nice to see we're in agreement. SAA's gonna expand Tadmur prison to encompass the entire city itself if they retake it (metaphorically of course). And if they fail to take Tadmur, the SAA's special forces will be irreversibly damaged in terms of prestige and capability."
syriancivilwar,3e0l2d,fartwhat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, as long as ISIS doesn't actually take T4, I'm fine with them sticking around and forcing regime helicopters to stay on the ground until the rebels are strong enough to take Palmyra."

If it was Sinjar, Latakia, or Suwayda, I'd feel differently but Tadmur is a sunni town and if the SAA takes it they'll probably grab and execute ""collaborators"".   Uh...that's going to happen in any village, town, city, or area where and when any faction in this war enters it. ISIL itself already did so in Palmyra a few months ago. Smaller towns or neighborhoods of towns which have changed hands through multiple parties have experienced this several times. It's hardly a well thought out or reasonable reason for rooting for or against anyone in a battle.   I'm not too concerned with the fate of ISIL collaborators whether in Palmyra or in any centimeter of space within Syria (or Iraq for that matter) and I'm sure I'm accompanied in that sentiment by many. It's not just about the fate of those minority of Salafist-inclined individuals but the well-being of the population as a whole, and unless someone is a woman-beating, slaving Salafi fundamentalist who wants to extinguish all intellectual, social, and cultural light in Syria, life under ISIL's flag is worse for everyone than under Syrian authority."

syriancivilwar,3dxffs,ugurozturk,63,Mon Jul 20 09:37:13 2015 UTC,"Information about explosion so far:   32 dead, near 100 wounded Location of the explosion There was a ""Rojava Event"" in the center yesterday. Some of the people who attended this event was staying in the center. The culture center, which is run by the Suruç Municipality under the control of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), frequently hosts visiting journalists and volunteers who work with refugees from Kobane. At least 300 members of the Federation of Socialist Youth Associations (SGDF) were staying at the Amara Culture Center as part of a summer expedition to help rebuild Kobane, which lies directly across the border from Suruç. There is speculation that the blast was caused by a 18-year-old female suicide bomber from the ISIS. ""If it is Daesh, it will not stay in Suruç. Very soon we could end up like Syria,"" said Muhsin Kızılkaya, a deputy from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Photo before explosion ,  and after Video of explosion from Doğan News Agency  Video showing aftermath of explosion (NSFL) İsmail Kaplan, the HDP's deputy head in Suruç district, told journalists that a simultaneous suicide bombing hit the town center of Kobane, which had been repeatedly attacked by ISIS in the past months, too. Speaking to daily Hürriyet, security sources in Ankara have confirmed this claim. Davutoğlu confirmed ISIS was the prime suspect, adding that 43 people, 9 of them with serious injuries, were hospitalized after the attack. He also called on all political parties to come together and issue a joint statement condemning terrorism. Following the attack, the U.K. Embassy in Ankara has also updated its travel advice for Turkey, underlining that terrorist attacks by various groups could be indiscriminate and could affect places visited by foreigners."

When the US military praises the YPG fighting IS, they don't recognize their economic and social beliefs. When socialists and other political opponents are victims of terror, they're left anonymous so as not to create sympathy.  On the other hand, they'll happily highlight that the PKK is Marxist/socialist when discussing its (terrorist) activities in Turkey. Similarly Christian shooters are seldom referred to as terrorists by the media, while Muslim shooters are called terrorists even before their identity is discovered."

syriancivilwar,3dxffs,redrojava,6,Mon Jul 20 10:16:00 2015 UTC,"Just to explain something: Jihadists have only an in-group morality system. People outside of Sunni Muslims (and their very specific definition of that) are perfectly valid for targetting. And these were the enemies of Islam. YPG-PKK worked with USA air force which has bombed and killed Sunnis, and IS fighters. YPG-PKK has killed fighters directly and defeated them militarily.   Jihadists see no distinction between a journalist, a humanitarian worker or a soldier. All are fair game, and all are dehumanized in their eyes. They do not believe in any kind of concept of solidarity with other groups. It's a very black/white view of the world. Us vs. Them.

They voted against him in the last election (as they should).   Erdogan is the one pushing for support of Jihadists in Syria to attack Syrian Kurds in Rojava. He has said that he will not tolerate a Kurdish state on the border of Turkey. He's pushing for the invasion and occuplation of Jarabulus, in northern Syria to deny it to the Kurds. Erdogan never pushed for intervention when Kobani was under attack for months, but if Kurds threaten to take over all of Northern Syria and create a united mini-state then that's too much for him. It shows where their priorities really are."

Instability, no matter who the victim is, is something not in the interest of anyone including Erdoğan . Turkey, unlike Iraq and Syria, is still a functioning partially westernized country that is not in a state of total war, thus things like this severely hurt the economy and financial sector.

syriancivilwar,3dxffs,el_beelo_reborn,11,Mon Jul 20 12:55:46 2015 UTC,"I should also add that one of the most important factors contributing to the AKP's past election successes were its ability to get more Kurdish votes than the PKK-affiliated parties (HADEP, DTP, BDP, HDP etc). Likewise, one of the major factors in AKP's relatively poor performance in the latest election was the desertion of this Kurdish vote to the HDP.   Those calling Erdoğan a dictator and the AKP as an oppressive one party does not realise that their power is entirely dependent upon him and AKP winning elections that are regarded as ""free and fair"" by foreign election monitors. Hence, it is in both Erdoğan's and AKP's interest NOT to alienate the Kurds in Turkey."

Go through all that trouble and risk their lives to save enemies? I think: No.   This exactly. Turkish intelligence has enough people inside ISIS who inform them. That's also why Turkey started with a bufferzone at the border with Kobane 1 week before ISIS started the attack on Kobane city."

syriancivilwar,3dxffs,vanulovesyou,3,Mon Jul 20 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"Since at least 2007, Erdoğan and the AKP government has been continually accused of high treason because they allegedly went soft on PKK&the Kurds. Just before the 2007 elections, when PKK was attacking border garrisons every other day and killing many Turkish soldiers, the AKP ministers and MPs got booed during their funerals.  When news of the deliberations between the Turkish intelligence officials and PKK representatives at Oslo surfaces, the opposition claimed Erdoğan&AKP were traitors.   In the last 5 years, a lot of democratic reforms were passed in Turkey, giving many rights to the Kurds.  So there is this side of the story."
syriancivilwar,3dxffs,ou-est-charlie,0,Mon Jul 20 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"Let's consider this was done very likely and also claimed by ISIS, because the people of Suruc, Turkey, were very active in helping drive ISIS out of Kobane/Ayn Al Arab. That's the priority here. Turkey has a very difficult strategy to work esp. in the Middle East, where "" herding elephants over eggs""  without EVER breaking a single one is the daily requirement there.  We need to strike this kind of terrorism at its roots in the human brain. The capacity for such acts as this is built into the human brain. Very few are going to be immune to terror, anywhere in the world, as in the hills of Chattanooga, US this last week. When many terrorists were released from guantanamo and prisons in iraq, about 30% went back to terrorist groups. Using the method below, much of that perhaps 60-70% of that recidivism can be prevented. That's a VERY good start at the grass roots.  Here's a better approach to more in the long term get RID of much of this terrorism, by realizing its sources and that it can be controlled by medications we already have and known very well for 30 years how to use.  https://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2014/08/12/dealing-with-sociopaths-terrorists-and-riots/"

syriancivilwar,3dxffs,Reditski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"Thats called guerilla warfare. You cant blame the pkk for using tactics that work.   It's not guerilla warfare, it's opportunistic attacks. The PKK takes out a soft target and the Turkish army kills a couple of them now and then. There isn't any type of committed military action. The vast majority of PKK-Turkey encounters is through Syria. If there was a war Kurds in Syria and Qandil would be busy burying bodies.  Guerilla warfare has already been tried before. The Turks pushed out the  vast majority of the PKK before and they have failed to bring down or undermine the Turkish state in SE Anatolia. Every year the opportunity to bring down the state becomes harder and harder. We live in an era of drones and mass surveillance. Insurgency in a place like Turkey is not easy.   Of course, turkish army has a conventional 10000 times overweight. But okk now uses ambushes, those actually work.   The war stopped being conventional a long time ago. It stopped being guerilla as well. The battlefield has changed. The battle I was talking about ended with heavy lopsided casualties for the PKK when drones over the area identified their fighters. In the 80s they may have been able to take over the entire area for a few days until a large force comes to oust them. In todays battles the Turks can surgically attack them without needing as much men and equipment as before.   I truely believe, and with me the akp-led government of turkey too since they participatd in the peace process, that PKK want peace. You mean, turkey is finally doing what kurds and pkk wanted all the time? Nice. Every kurd will be happy about that. War comes out of necisittiy, not out of pleasure.   AKP wants peace because they want to develop Turkey. Having a terrorist group causing problem in a region is bad for the entire country. Having an undeveloped region is bad for the nation as well as it reduces the economic opportunities for the entire country and brings in thousands of migrants to the West who will need jobs, schools and houses.  PKK wants peace because they are losing and fading away.They didn't start the war because they wanted to see a developed SE Anatolia within Turkey.   I am agreeing that pkk should lay down arms unless turkey does a big ""fuck you"" and starts the '80s opressions, but you got to remember thst the pkk hssnt come out of nowhere.    The PKK was born in an era of Kemalist oppression. When left wing and right wing militants along with the state security were going around and killing each other. Those days are long over. The age of secular extremism in Turkey is dead. Erdogan and AKP have changed the entire game. Turkish Marxist, Ultranationalists and Kurdish nationalists are something from a different era.   The best way to destroy pkk is not by waging war, but by improving the lives of the people and listening to their demands. If the Kurdish people will be happy, which they are slowly beginning to be, there is no need for the PKK.   You are on the right track but make the mistake of assuming that the PKK wants to see kurds prosper and do well. The PKK at the end of the day uses the grievances of others to their own advantage. For them Kurds prospering is a bad thing. It leaves them with less grievances to use and less recruits.  The worst thing to happen to the PKK wasn't the military defeats they suffered but AKP coming along and treating Kurds better than the Kemalists. The fact that places in Turkey that have lived in the same condition for thousands of years are getting bridges, dams and roads are a bad thing for them.  Now that the Iran deal has been made. SE Anatolia has a bright future as a transit area. Their already tiny following in Iran will disappear even further. The future is really bad for the PKK unless they become a legitimate political actor that can meaningfully affect the daily lives of Kurds."

syriancivilwar,3dydhh,Balak_Jewboma,3,Mon Jul 20 16:49:17 2015 UTC,The regime likely does not have enough soldiers to properly hold the territory that the YPG has captured from Daesh anyway.

syriancivilwar,3dydhh,footballma56,3,Tue Jul 21 00:32:23 2015 UTC,"That is the only reason they're fighting. I don't think that YPG has the capability to fight both the regime and IS at the same time, and the regime has no interest in losing their last presence in northeast Syria. It's this mutual connection of interests that stops them from all-out war with eachother. Let's not forget that the regime did go to war with the Kurds when they had strong presence in the north and east of the country."

syriancivilwar,3dykbg,sunbolts,8,Mon Jul 20 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"Most of what the article discusses is civilian deaths. It's not even clear when it talks about combatant casualties because it uses the word ""people"" instead of soldiers or militants or fighters.  In fact the article doesn't even specifically mention military casualties. It admits it's unclear whether released figures include military casualties or not.   The press report didn’t say whether this was just civilian casualties or included members of the security forces.   Of course, this sort of thing is problematic when determining proper statistics and numbers."
syriancivilwar,3dykbg,Yasu3,-6,Mon Jul 20 18:32:23 2015 UTC,Why do you even defend Baghdad? What have they done for Assyrians besides appropriate your history?
syriancivilwar,3dykbg,sunbolts,8,Mon Jul 20 20:29:08 2015 UTC,"With the current administration, they have not done anything at all. Previous regimes and the monarchy (at least after Simele) tended to leave the villagers be and included the urbanites decently. I guess not annihilating them and keeping them protected was a big thing as well. You know what the Ottomans did. No surpriseeven on the basis of ethnoreligious groups, you find Chaldeans, Syriacs, and even some Assyrians (by this I mean adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East, and not the Assyrian ethnicity) were generally supportive of secular government, even when they didnt like the actual administrations itself necessarily, and the nation for these reasons.   No surprise that many Chaldeans and Syriacs were some of the most Iraq-focused people, especially in the cities. There was no motivation for them to engage in ethnic/religious divisive practices, policies, and even aggression like some Arab and Kurdish organizations and tribes, so that state and being Iraqi usually became an important part of their identity especially for the urbanites. You do see some ethnonationalism among Assyrians through. Much of this also applies for the Christian groups in Syria too.  Of course nowadays this has mostly been reversed as the Iraqi government has done nothing to protect these groups, particularly in the cities, and just in the last decade the Christians in general have been mostly eliminated from the country. Everyone's lost some big degree of faith really.  Yes Iraq today has one of the most corrupt and incompetent regimes in the world nowadays, but people always hope for improvement across the board, including the plight of religious minorities. Even with Christians mostly displaced from the country for good, it's still the old country and heritage. This cannot easily be discredited."
syriancivilwar,3dykbg,LiesAboutKnowingYou,2,Mon Jul 20 20:59:06 2015 UTC,What a useless criticism of his support. Perhaps he feels his nationalism more than his religious or ethnic identity as do many Iraqis? Reducing him to simply Assyrian and not Iraqi or Arab or whatever he feels the the closest to identity wise is absurd.
syriancivilwar,3dykbg,Yasu3,0,Tue Jul 21 03:54:31 2015 UTC,The concept of Iraq means nothing to Assyrians. It placed onto them via conquest. I don't see Kurds caring for Iraq and the irony is Assyrians unlike Kurds and Arabs are the original Mesopotamian. So why should he?  All I'm saying Iraq and any Muslims for that matter aren't going to advance his people.
syriancivilwar,3dykbg,LiesAboutKnowingYou,2,Tue Jul 21 03:56:39 2015 UTC,There are several Kurds here who identify as Iraqi. Including a Feyli Kurdi who identifies first as an Iraqi then as a Kurd. You're projecting your own notions of identity on others.
syriancivilwar,3dykbg,larektundir,7,Tue Jul 21 03:58:32 2015 UTC,The article also argues that the Peshmerga have been under reporting their casualties. The title made me assume it was just ISF or PMU.

syriancivilwar,3dykbg,Reditski,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:03 2015 UTC,"Likewise, there have been 2,657 peshmerga deaths in the newspapers, more than double the amount the Peshmerga Ministry mentioned. The true numbers are probably even much higher. As a recent Al Mada article speculated there might have been up to 50,000 casualties from June 2014 to June 2015. The government however has been scared to report the real figures fearing that it would undermine morale.    What newspapers do say that? Is he really relying on Kurdish newspapers? Kurdish newspapers are very unreliable and often times antagonize other parties(pro-PUK parties lie about KDP all the time). Relying on Kurdish newspapers for casualties is not the type of research a good journalist would do.   n all wars government’s revert to propaganda to maintain the public’s support and portray an air of victory. Baghdad and Irbil are no different. Their announcements are always filled with reports of hundreds of Islamic State fighters being killed and captured, one strategic town after another being taken all creating a relentless story of success. What is lost in that narrative is the costs of the war.    When has the Ministry of Peshmerga announced that hundreds of ISIS terrorists has been killed in a single day? I only see Kurdish newspapers saying that, not Kurdidsh authorities.  In Kurdistan, there has been a portrayal of thousands of Kurdish martyrs. I don't think the KRG is so cold-hearted to exclude some martyrs just for the sake of propaganda."

You can't drink a cup of tea in Urfa-Suruç line without MİT's knowledge. MİT is basically Erdoğan's private property at this point. At the very least, he knew about it and has done nothing. It does little difference if he had anything to do with it, because his government is completely silent about all the obvious jihadi cells literally everywhere. Plus attacking the peaceful rallies condemning the massacre didn't help his cause. He was so eager to get involved in the civil war, now the civil war is getting involved with us. People are pissed. Not to mention that he did say that the government will do ""literally anything"" to stop a Kurdish state formation in Syria. It's not just political rivalry. AKP is now hated by pretty much everyone except their own supporters, no Turkish government has faced this. Political rivalry is not enough to blame someone for a terrorist attack. Me saying that he will face retaliation is not a slogan. Turkish left has been mostly unarmed since the 90's. This will probably change this. Plus, Kurds are talking about mass arming in the cities.

Links between AKP government and JaN are pretty obvious   It's also pretty obvious that turkey is slowly loosing control over the islamists. His agreements with ISIS are known to have specifically included a ""no terror in turkey"" clause. I doubt he wouldn't have pushed the same on Nusra , the islamist front or whatever.   At the very least, he knew about it and has done nothing.   His attitude during the siege of Kobane or Tel Abyad was very different. He was aggressive, threathening, and making up rumors of ethnic cleansing. He went as far as paying and pressuring and blackmailing part of the FSA to repeat it.   Plus attacking the peaceful rallies condemning the massacre didn't help his cause.    I do agree. Tho for all it's worth, Turkey's cops are beating everyone as an equal opportunity. Hundreds of people were beaten bloody in Taksim 2y ago and water from the lances was cut with pepper and shit like that to make you blind and debilitated sometime for days. So it's not just the kurds.   Not to mention that he did say that the government will do ""literally anything"" to stop a Kurdish state formation in Syria.

I can hear it from here, the cheesy ""it's not a threat it's a promise"". Dude. And what killing more people will do ? Will it help fixing the dead in that one ? No it wont. And the injured will need time to recover in an hospital in quiet, not another civil war.   Turkish left has been mostly unarmed since the 90's   Right. Like the unarmed PKK and unarmed MLKP. You think i'm that much of an idiot really ?   About the war we can't win: we are already winning   Uhhh. The war didn't started. And the moment it really start, there'll be litterally a couple thousand tanks sent your way, with hundreds of planes and half a million soldier. Then what ? Everybody dies gloriously in a glorious last stand at 1vs10'000 ?

They are different. First one was an uprising. Yesterday's rallies were peaceful protests. By the way, yesterdays rallies in the west were Turkish dominated, Kurds sent a skeleton crew. When Kurds get on the streets en masse, they don't just protest. He hasn't sent tanks to Rojava, and he never will. Operating in his own country is a different story. Dude, the ""retaliation"" thing is not a promise either. I think armed political struggle is pretty stupid at this level in Turkey. But it is becoming a fact. I know some major leftist organizations that started discussing it. PKK is a force close to, but outside the Turkish left. MLKP is strong organizationwise, but doesn't have mass support. Until very recently they were pretty marginal. Main bodies of the Turkish left are still unarmed. I was born and raised in Turkey and involved with socialist organizations since I was 15. I think its fair to say that I may know a bit more about this than you.  If you can read Turkish or have a friend that can translate for you, look at todays leftist newspapers. People are talking about arming themselves, and these guys are not guerilla leaders, they are mostly ex-academy moderate respected leftist writers.

And it'll be a massacre. What stays Erdogan's arm now is that the kurds are painted as victims of his oppressive regime and he gets called hitler every 2 days. If you (re)start terrorism, that'll evaporate like a snowball in the sun. And if you actually face the turkish army on the field, you'll simply get slaughtered. Sorry. The idea gives me honestly nausea; please don't get killed that way after all this.   I think armed political struggle is pretty stupid at this level in Turkey.   By the ""war"" I obviously meant a political confrontation.    Okay, i hope so"

syriancivilwar,3dxyld,nickfury27,6,Mon Jul 20 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I struggle to really call that terrorism. You can't just define every violent action by a non-state actor against a state terrorism. The problem with that one is that the marines couldn't expect an attack, while the Turkish army certainly can expect attacks.  The difference between PKK and ISIS is that the former doesn't explicitly endorse the attacks on civilians and it has been a while since the group explicitly planned some. That car bombing is probably just a lone actor.  For example PKK denied they were behind the car bombing and we don't even know they were, unbiased and neutral Turkish army claims it. That's the difference to ISIS."

This bit too much, so the public too clearly perceives it for what it is.  Have you read that other statement, quoted in CNN from an unnamed AKP source, that this terror attack was meant to punish Erdogan for his pretended strict policies against islamist terror organisations? Well, that even tops the cynicism of Mr. Erdogan's remarks.  To return your compliment: I do not know about your country competence concerning Turkey (I would agree with your analysis of what Erdogan wanted to, but does not, achieve with such a statement).

syriancivilwar,3dzaq9,DimitriRavinoff,6,Mon Jul 20 19:15:45 2015 UTC,"This is just being smart. One of ISIS's biggest strengths has always been its decentralised nature which makes sure the organisation survives even through hard times, such as the 2010/2011 period. In my opinion the best way to cripple ISIS isn't through the targeting of religious figureheads like Al Baghdadi but through taking out ISIS's ""number threes"". The Americans had a lot success doing this against Al Qaeda and by taking out the likes of Afri and Turkmani I think you could do some real damage to the organisation."
syriancivilwar,3dzaq9,Watnot,2,Mon Jul 20 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"Taking out Al Baghdadi is still going to be highly destabilizing now, though. ISIS isn't just some run of the mill terror group anymore, it is now a rogue state in charge of eight million people spread across a large swathe of territory. Some one must give orders from the center for it to be able to survive, and Baghdadi dying with no undisputed successor will cause an internal power vacuum."
syriancivilwar,3dzaq9,BrainBlowX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:37:14 2015 UTC,"Militarily, it's the mid-level commanders that are most important to cell-based militias like IS and the Taliban. They're the people that actually coordinate and lead operations, and neutralizing them robs those organizations of their most valuable experienced personnel. Killing Baghdadi would have great propaganda value, but its effects would be largely on morale, not operational effectiveness. These mid-level commanders have been the primary targets of the US's drone program in Pakistan and the widespread special forces raids in Afghanistan. Lacking the number of troops needed for high-density counterinsurgency, neutralizing those commanders is the next-best means of degrading the Taliban's capabilities. It's obviously not completely adequate, of course, which presents a lot of lessons for the fight against IS."
syriancivilwar,3dzaq9,ofarrizzle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:45 2015 UTC,"I hear this repeated a lot, but is it actually true? Let me be more specific about what I am thinking:  I don't doubt that the operational effectiveness of ISIS probably comes as a result of its mid-level commanders. But people like Baghdadi and the other senior leadership are presumably doing all sorts of other important high-level things. They may not be organizing offensives or commanding troops on the battlefield, but presumably they are making major strategic decisions, making high-level decisions about how ISIS is run (such as the decision to declare a caliphate or to be a decentralized organization where mid-level commanders have a lot of authority), and in general having a huge influence on the organization. My intuition is that killing Baghdadi might not have an immediate impact on ISIS' operational capacity (though a severe morale hit could have such an impact, I would think) but could nevertheless have a huge overall impact on the group over time.  For example, it seems from what I have read that Zarqawi has had a lot of trouble keeping various clients of Al Qaeda in line, which is a role he is only playing because Bin Laden was killed -- even though Bin Laden's death likely had little impact on things like the day-to-day or even month-to-month operations of the various AQ-affiliated groups."

Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about how the United States gathers information on militants. A main result is that group’s top leaders now use couriers or encrypted channels that Western analysts cannot crack to communicate, intelligence and military officials said.   I consider myself a hacker. So I am very conflicted about this.  Part of me is thinking ""cryptography yay, Snowden awesome!"", the other part of me is seeing that he might have actually directly help chaos and blood and murder in Middle East. (Not to say Russia, but that is still somehow better.)  In other words, I'm currently experiencing very high degree of cognitive dissonance."
syriancivilwar,3dzaq9,throwmebone,4,Tue Jul 21 00:44:36 2015 UTC,"Any source from an unnamed intelligence official is just the intelligence services/government pushing their agenda.  Al-Qaeda knew full well that most electronic communications were monitored and couriers were the only ""safe"" option while Bin Laden was in hiding. And as IS is an offshoot, one would expect them to know the same.  Unnamed sources, which by design can never be verified or questioned, are always propaganda."

I won't speak to the degree to which Snowden  may have helped ISIS through leaks, but not having to name sources is one of the bastions of the free press. With anything, you need to be skeptical, but you shouldn't write everything off due to anonymity."
syriancivilwar,3dzaq9,Coaste12ama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:13 2015 UTC,"I never said you should write it off, just that there is a reason they don't put a name to those words - it is so they cannot be questioned or verified. You have to ask why it is being leaked and not publicly stated.  The information may be true or it may not, but they leaked it to serve their agenda.  I'm sure groups like IS have learned things from the Snowden leaks they did not previously consider. However, blaming him for their use of encryption and couriers is utter rubbish."

However successful terror groups have known about encryption and using couriers for more than a decade - blaming Snowden for this is just the intelligence services pushing their agenda.  With regard to Watergate, they were leaked against the government, and most importantly provided lots of details that could be verified. That's very different to an unnamed security service person leaking information for the government, often at the behest of the government.  When the government or intelligence services leak something it may or may not be true - all I'm saying is that it is done with an agenda, not just to provide information."

Iraq's seeing hundreds and thousands of Iraqi Army and Popular Mobilization soldiers dying to retake each major IS stronghold (Tikrit), not including dead IS fighters and the damage done to civilians on both sides. A huge swath of the country is controlled by IS, the country is quite literally in shambles.   Tack onto that the absolute chaos of Syria, where you've got a near free-for-all between moderate FSA, Kurds, IS, other Jihadists (Nursa, etc.), and the SSA, and you start to get a sense of really just how bleak the situation is.   Don't get me wrong, the US occupation of Iraq was bloody, but keep in mind that it also lasted a lot longer than the Syrian Civil War and IS's expansion into Iraq has gone on. In modern Syria/Iraq we're seeing a lot more blood packed into a smaller time frame, as well as an expansion of the conflict from just one country to two."

Your own president by the way has admitted that the US was itself responsible for the rise of ISIS. It is also no secret that the US has funded/organised and used Islamic fundamentalism at all stages since the 50's. Former US top strategist Sergei Brzezinski proudly admits this  (http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/coldwar/interviews/episode-17/brzezinski1.html) and so have others.

You don't have to fill up trucks with aid to gain intelligence, particularly when you have the IDF's sophisticated technology:   During the evening of 20 January, in the area north of observation post 54, UNDOF observed two trucks crossing from the [Syrian] side to the [Israeli] side, where they were received by IDF [Israeli military] personnel,” the report states. “The trucks were loaded with sacks before returning to the [Syrian] side.”   Israel is/was supporting JN (Al Qaida) for the principal reason that they were fighting Hezbollah. The fact they're Wahhabi extremists just makes it all the more palatable for the decision makers, as Gilad Sharon, son of the late Israeli PM Ariel Sharon said it:   “There would be no international pressure for Israel to give back the Golan Heights either [in the event of an ISIS takeover] — and that’s a very good thing. The Golan will remain an important part of Israel forever.”   You also stated:   such actions are codified in many nations moral compass as ""These are things we are required to do"" whether out of selflessness, alternative motives, or whatever   I didn't know that Israel merely strives to match the morality of it's autocratic, dictatorial neighbors like the Saudis, Qataris    But the net result is someone doesn't die when they otherwise would. I see that as a positive.   Keep in mind Israel is saving people who do things like this. I don't know if that means that ""someone doesn't die when they otherwise would"" is necessarily true."

The thing is that Syrian support to Hamas or Hezbollah didn't lead to such a drastic turn of events, if anything it was minimal. Hamas would have existed simply by the Gaza tunnels and those would have been working wherever Syria was involved or not.  In Syria however the Israeli support or neutral stance towards Al Qaeda's Nusra front has led to it's thriving in the southern parts of Syria to the dismay of Druze and Christian civilians in the area, Micheal Oren's remarks in which he said Israel would rather have ISIS and Al Qaeda over a known entity (Assad) alienated many Christians in Druze which had heard the horror stories of what was ongoing wherever from JAN or FSA groups.  I'm not saying Israel should help the Syrians but remaining neutral would have been better, they wouldn't have given these minorities the impression that it is colluding with Sunni radicals and between me and you better the devil you know.  The Syrian Israeli border was a secure one, having a tiny potential of JAN or even ISIS eventually locate itself there isn't convenient to the Syria minorities or Israelis near that border, I think we can both agree on this."

JaN is a tiny player in the south and doesn't have a significant presence in the Quneitirah areas that border the Golan Heights.

The  UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), the peacekeeping mission responsible for monitoring the 1974 ceasefire line between Israeli and Syrian forces in the Golan Heights has documented dozens of interactions between Israel and opposition fighters:   According to the December 2014 report, UNDOF observed two Israeli soldiers “opening the technical fence gate and letting two individuals pass from the [Syrian] to the [Israeli] side” on 27 October. Unlike most fighters seen entering the Israeli side, these individuals were not wounded and the purpose of their visit remains a mystery. The next UNDOF report, released in March, notes that UN forces witnessed Israeli soldiers delivering material aid to armed Syrian opposition groups. “During the evening of 20 January, in the area north of observation post 54, UNDOF observed two trucks crossing from the [Syrian] side to the [Israeli] side, where they were received by IDF [Israeli military] personnel,” the report states. “The trucks were loaded with sacks before returning to the [Syrian] side.”   Pretty convenient for Netanyahu to assist Al Qaida conquering the border region  and then point to the glut of Islamist militias surrounding Israel as reason why he can't withdraw (or stop settling) the occupied territories.  Gilad Sharon, son of the late Israeli PM Ariel Sharon said it best:   “There would be no international pressure for Israel to give back the Golan Heights either [in the event of an ISIS takeover] — and that’s a very good thing.

There is one where he says reports of a aircraft being shot down over Latakia (which he is not confirming just mentioning those reports) and then later in the day that was clarified as being a drone by other sources.   Let's go back another day shall we?  More reports with sources and videos, hmm. Where are the two lies? There was a tweet about a shilka being captured with no evidence, maybe take that with a grain of salt but at the same time it is likely. Still no lies though.  Even further to two days ago? Why not?  Not many tweets on the 18th but the ones tweeted then have video's and pictures to back them up. And the 17th? Oh shit what is that? More pictures and videos to back up his claims! Wow, Markito, so unreliable (/s). Even going as far as the 16th and 15th, no lies, and more tweets with pictures and videos (plus corroborating tweets from others to help confirm the claims of that day).   But...but...muh Markito lies narrative. I think it's more that people don't like him because he is more pro-rebel. Which is fine, but calling his information lies at every mention is just stupid and a lie itself. Like I said earlier, he's not right all the time, who is? Yet time and time again, despite being wrong occasionally, Mark has proven himself to be reliable with pictures, videos, and information.    Edit: Just to clarify one thing, I'm aware on his tweets & replies page that there are more claims without videos and pictures, I was more or less talking about the ones on his tweets tab. While it would be nice to see more evidence for those other tweets, it doesn't make him any less reliable.

To have truly effective close air support you need people on the ground calling it in. The coalition has that with the Pesh, YPG, and some ISF units but not with Hashd who are leading some of the biggest operations. The US doesnt have enough aircraft in the region to be able to stop every ISIS attack against a weakspot on the hundreds of km frontlines. US carrier in the gulf just had to leave for port so theres no longer carrier support and one of the northern European countries just dropped out of the coalition, that's like at least 25 planes fewer a day the coalition will have at its disposal. B1s are perfect against ISIS but there's only like one squadron stationed in the UAE  To be fair, SyAAF, IrAF, and coalition have all destroyed ISIS convoys and troop movements but just destroying a couple isnt enough when they send 15 convoys a week or something. Also, IS isnt dumb so there are ways they can help their chances against aerial foes. Like traveling at night against the SyAAF or during sandstorms against the coalition. US Rules of Engagement also prohibit targeting civilian vehicles so if they just use like sedans or minivans stretched over over hours they probably could move their troops around.

syriancivilwar,3e170o,degestani,2,Tue Jul 21 05:11:28 2015 UTC,Satellites only work a couple times a day and then you would have to scramble jets to destory the target in time. It works but I think most of the U.S. sats are focused on ISIS strongholds mapping defenses and tracking VIPs. If you could just use satellites and air power there would be no Taliban left. Air power can play significant roles in winning a war but it cannot win a war.
syriancivilwar,3e170o,Ian_W,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:54 2015 UTC,"SAF does not have enough jets to monitor the huge desert. The US of course did see the the convoy.  ISIS and SAA command hetched a bet:  SAA bet that any large ISIS convoy traveling through hundreds of KM of empty desert would be nuked by the US.  ISIS bet that as long as the convoy was heading to a front with SAA, USAF would not touch the convoy.  ISIS won that bet and with it the city."

If Assad is going to bet that the USAF will do his air force's job for them, he is even dumber than he showed with his reaction to Idlib."

syriancivilwar,3dxgo9,LockedOnTarget,8,Mon Jul 20 09:55:25 2015 UTC,"The problem with Lebanese Christians is they are the most divided group in Lebanon.  While Sunnis are usually together, and Shi'ites are usually together, Christians are split into two camps, one allied with the Sunnis and one allied with the Shi'ites.  Basically, the reason for this is because one sees the biggest cause of Lebanon's problems as Israeli/Western/Saudi intervention, and the other one sees it as due to Syrian intervention.  Given the history of Lebanon, both are true.  So even though you see Hezbollah battling ISIS, there are many Christians who still oppose Hezbollah because of Syria's history of interference in Lebanon."
syriancivilwar,3dxgo9,baghdadi_guy,4,Mon Jul 20 18:29:55 2015 UTC,"Christians in Lebanon are divided by religion too, historically orthodox christians tended to pursue a more arab nationalist line (with ties to Syria) and Maronites a more distinctly lebanese identity with ties to the west."
syriancivilwar,3dxgo9,LefordMurphy,23,Mon Jul 20 19:54:50 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that Hezbollah has been gradually moving away from a religious dominated rhetoric to lay more emphasis on non-sectarianism, mainly as a means of trying to expand its popular base in the region.   Yep. I recall hearing in a lecture that covered Hezbollah that they initially had parts about wanting an Islamic state in Lebanon around the time of their formation, but by the time of their entry into politics had abandoned it. Hezbollah is arming and training Christian self-defense militias around Arsal/Qalamoun in their villages.   I really doubt Hezbollah is trying to recruit Christians into the organisations itself - that would irrevocably compromise their 100% Twelver Shia credentials - but I could definitely see them creating formal Christian militias that they ally with, train and command in and around Lebanon.  When Islamic State is around, Christians and Shias are natural allies after all."
syriancivilwar,3dxgo9,Leadback,3,Mon Jul 20 10:27:22 2015 UTC,"It is quite similar to a development taking place in Iran.

syriancivilwar,3dxgo9,Leadback,9,Mon Jul 20 10:37:08 2015 UTC,Hezbollah are arming Christians threatened by IS and other salafists.  That's basically the gist of what I've heard so far; they're arming Christians and working with them near the border.

syriancivilwar,3dxgo9,gesreddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:49 2015 UTC,"Who said it was? I said, that during the early days the whole tilt of the official rhetoric was strongly in religious/populist terms (ie. oppressors vs. oppressed etc.) and consciously non-nationalist. For instance, the ""revolution"" was termed the Islamic revolution and not the Iranian revolution. I don't know if you remember that. Today however and especially in the past period, there has been a significant shift towards a more nationalist, ie. the nation of Iran, non-sectarian rhetoric in the official channels."
syriancivilwar,3dxgo9,umakemefunny,11,Tue Jul 21 09:52:29 2015 UTC,"You are right, they started out as a continuation of Iranian revolution ideology. But the civil war in Lebanon taught them that this would just cause all sorts of headaches, tensions and violence in a diverse country like Lebanon. Sometime in the mid-2000s they made the official switch to supporting a non-religious, democratic government with religious parties like themselves (and other parties). This has kept things in a balance (also because Iran, US and gulf states have various proxies in Lebanon and agree that keeping it stable is a priority). Christians have been their political allies for some time, which is smart because 40% of Lebanon are Christians.  They would never allow Christians in Hezbollah itself, as they are a 12er Shia party. If they would allow that it would be a major, major change in policy. Of course they might train Christians to have their own militias though. There have been some rumors about this, but I have not seen anything specific so far.  It's important to remember that Hezbollah at its core is a anti-Israel resistance movement, so their support for Shia-Sunni-Christian unity is also geared at that."
syriancivilwar,3dxgo9,LefordMurphy,11,Mon Jul 20 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"As long as they fight terrorists in Syria and do not try to impose their way of life in Lebanon the Christian community will accept them more and more. Already now you can see EX Phalangists or LFers which hated them with a passion start accepting and supporting their Syrian cause. Slowly but surely this will become the norm  The war in Syria has united Christians, Shia, Druze and moderate Sunnis which view extremist Sunni groups as a real threat which needs to be faced head on, that's the one positive from this conflict.  The Christians of Lebanon know they can't survive in the region without allies, we've seen what happened with the Christians in Iraq and rebel parts of Syria, can't have that in Lebanon so we'll ally with whoever is fighting our enemies, it used to be states such as Israel but nowadays it's Hezbollah, Syria and Iran mainly. The US too to a certain degree but then they've got terror supporters in their coallition such as SA and Qatar, so they lose some credibility. Funny how things change.  Take an example what happened in Turkey today, JAN had targeted this meeting and looks like ISIS committed the act, everyone is being pushed to side together against the Salafi/Wahhabi groups which are opposed to everything everywhere."

It was a principal participant in Geneva II and held several rounds of talks between representatives of the two sides in Moscow. Saying that Russia waited until JaN and IS became dominant to start talking is a lie.  If this is indeed a significant shift in Russian policy toward a more neutral position, it has far more to do with Russia needing to improve relations with the West, Turkey, and the Gulf States, and not with the situation on the ground in Syria.  The other premise of your post is also wrong. 2015 is a much better year for the Syrian opposition than 2014. The wildcard Daesh has gotten weaker. The Kurdish YPG prefers the US to the Syrian state and has gotten stronger. The Southern Front has gotten stronger. Al-Nusra and all the other assorted Salafi/Wahhabi/Islamist groups in Syria have also gotten stronger, and they're more friendly to Turkey, Qatar, KSA, and the other Gulf States.

They compete in the Caucasus and their interests are somewhat aligned in the Middle East. On the other hand Turkey - which also has a strained relationship with Russian on many issues (especially Caucasus and Balkans) - is becoming an important factor in Russias economic diversification plans.

syriancivilwar,3dwysu,finsareluminous,34,Mon Jul 20 13:58:10 2015 UTC,Probably not IMO.

syriancivilwar,3dwysu,Bunglateer,12,Mon Jul 20 07:09:57 2015 UTC,"Resources and casualties are replaceable, especially for a group like hezbollah which has the resources of a nation state. Combat experience however cannot be bought or otherwise easily acquired."

syriancivilwar,3dwysu,LiesAboutKnowingYou,17,Mon Jul 20 13:38:20 2015 UTC,Of course but Hezbollah casualties are hardly high enough to suggest they won't come out of this with a net increase in combat experience.   Some of the first Hezbollah fighters to enter Syria back in 2012 are probably already training the new recruits in 2015.
syriancivilwar,3dwysu,VCGS,14,Mon Jul 20 13:43:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's a mistake to think that experience gained fighting as a counter-insurgency force, which is more or less Hezbollah primary role in Syria, especially in the Qalamouns and Zabadani, which is proving to be their Fallujah (tough to clear, but with an end in sight) will be very applicable to a war with Israel. If Israel invades Lebanon, then it becomes the reverse- with Hezbollah the insurgency / guerrilla and Israel the COIN player. At which point, Hezbollah has to fall back on ATGM strikes and hope they do more to Trophy equipped Merkava's than al-Nusra's T-55s, ambushes and IEDs, which hasn't been their primary focus in Syria at all.  And if we're discussing a land incursion into Israel, this experience really doesn't help that at all. Faced against static defenses that simply aren't going to be overwhelmed, Hezbollah's best case scenario is cross-border raids to net more captives. Ultimately, Hezbollah's greatest bargaining chip has not shifted at all. No one, serious, in Israel fears a Hezbollah land invasion. Because such a thing is absurd. They fear the rockets, as they always have. They fear one of their sons serving compulsory service gets sniped while patrolling the border. They fear a cross border raid that leaves civilians dead or captured. And Hezbollah knows this. They aren't sharpening their knives and zeroing their rifles to bring the fight into Israel proper, because such a war would be absurd.  All Israel has to do is wait it out. Combat experience is a skill that atrophies. You don't retain that knowledge and skill forever. And it is rapidly changing. Even a US veteran of the Iraq invasion who is suddenly thrust back into the mix of war with no experience or training since then, would be hopelessly lost and require significant catch up to regain their skill.  The experience they've gained in Syria no doubt inform their training processes and battle doctrine and should be of concern to Israel. But this has not fundamentally altered them as an organization nor created an unmanageable threat for Israel. Honestly, the equipment they're gaining out of this is probably of the greatest benefit of all."
syriancivilwar,3dwysu,LiesAboutKnowingYou,8,Mon Jul 20 14:05:38 2015 UTC,I think you're needlessly complicating this.  New recruits with no combat experience at all < Veterans of Syrian battlefields. That's all I'm saying. I'm not saying this:    But this has not fundamentally altered them as an organization nor created an unmanageable threat for Israel.    Also it's not like Hezbollah veterans from 2006 are all dead too. Hezbollah veterans of Syria can learn from them and vice versa. No one is saying this exactly the type of combat experience they needed but it's certainly a hell of a lot better than no experience at all.   As for this:   Combat experience is a skill that atrophies.   Surely that applies to the IDF too?
syriancivilwar,3dwysu,VCGS,9,Mon Jul 20 14:12:41 2015 UTC,"The difference is that the IDF, or any modern military, is constantly training for those eventualities in a manner that non-state actors cannot replicate at the same level. The combat experience itself goes away, but the training does not. Israel possesses one of the best trained infantry forces on earth and they maintain that training whether there is a war or not.  That is not to suggest Hezbollah doesn't do its own training, but it is not on par with what a modern military in a secure nation-state can provide. No one questions that the individuals in Hezbollah who are recipients of Quds force training or specialized camps are most definitely in the more advanced category. But they can't compete with the training provided by the IDF, the partners and joint training ops the IDF does with foreign militaries, nor the training and infrastructure to sustain such a long term training program.  Combat experience most certainly atrophies, which is why modern militaries full-time job for combat troops not actively engaged in war, is the day-to-day training for the next war. The Marine Corps has a saying that as an infantryman you are either preparing for war, at war, or returning from war. There is no ""rest"" per se."
syriancivilwar,3dwysu,LiesAboutKnowingYou,2,Mon Jul 20 14:17:29 2015 UTC,"Do you really think Hezbollah will fight again with Israel?   It's time for Hezbollah to move away further from terrorist tactics and history, and further integrate into the Lebanese political scene, which it is doing. I think eventually it will more fully integrate into Lebanon and the LAF. I think neither Israel or Hezb want a battle with each other, and I think if Hezb sustains the path that it is on, then it won't happen in the future either.  Also, respectfully, please try and maintain your impartiality. You've said before that you're biased against Hezbollah, and your comments here are all very negative.

But I'm not going to slam an organization just because I don't like it. I dislike Hezbollah. I dislike Jabhat al-Nusra. But I have respect for each of their capabilities as non-state actors who have adapted to the rigors of war. (No I'm not comparing Hezbollah to al-Qaeda ideologically, I'm just using two non-military actors for comparison).  I will absolutely bring my biases to the table. But nothing I've said is incorrect or an attempt to try and degrade or denigrate Hezbollah's ability or standing. It's an honest assessment of how little impact fighting a counter-insurgency has on how you'd fight when you're the insurgency.  The reverse is try for major nations- if the West suddenly had to shift from the counter-insurgency mission that we've been fighting for the past 15 years to fighting Russian tanks flooding through the Fulda Gap, we'd be in a WORLD of hurt. There's enough generalized training and competency that it would quickly stabilize, but the lack of focus on training for a fight against tanks, aircraft, and the accouterments of a modern and conventional military would quickly cause massed casualties against troops who haven't practiced anti-tank warfare but once a year or so and who haven't dug a fighting hole since School Of Infantry.  Experience is useful. But it's not the end all be all if it doesn't apply to your given scenario.   But absolutely not, I don't think Israel and Hezbollah are gonna come to some massive blows. And I agree, Hezbollah integrating into the LAF would be of massive benefit to Lebanon as a whole and would help legitimize Hezbollah as an organization and disarm Israeli opponents of them."

Now of course you might argue that wouldn't have happened had Hezbollah stayed out of the war but the truth is their entry merely accelerated the process.

syriancivilwar,3dwysu,WendellSchadenfreude,6,Mon Jul 20 12:11:23 2015 UTC,"Yes,i know. my point is that there are Muslims who hate their fellow Muslims as much as they hate Israel,and many of them can be found in Hezbollah."
syriancivilwar,3dwysu,Lord_Khamul,2,Mon Jul 20 12:46:43 2015 UTC,Show me some of these many ultra-sectarian Hezbollah fighters. I'm sure that a party that has Sunni fighters and strictly prohibits that kind of sectarian bullshit is full of them.
syriancivilwar,3dwysu,Labayka,6,Mon Jul 20 13:07:13 2015 UTC,"The Atlantic Council released a really good essay a while back that addressed this topic.   The Shi’ite group has sustained heavy losses, with perhaps seven hundred dead and many more wounded, and veteran commanders counted among the casualties. Roughly five thousand Hezbollah soldiers fight at a time, but the organization regularly rotates its forces to spread the burden evenly. Nevertheless, to keep its numbers up, Hezbollah deploys younger recruits who are less trained.    and   Hezbollah is both battle weary and battle hardened. The Syria experience has blooded its forces, making them more skilled and allowing Hezbollah to test its commanders. At the same time, the heavy death toll and the constant strain are overwhelming, and Hezbollah cannot easily take on a new foe. The fighting in Syria is also different from fighting Israel. Hezbollah is in essence a counterinsurgency force, taking on less organized, poorly trained, and lightly armed rebels. The IDF is a different, and far more dangerous, kettle of fish. As a result, Hezbollah’s military threat to Israel is uncertain. Despite the drain of the Syrian conflict, parts of Hezbollah still focus on rockets and other means of striking Israel. Indeed, Hezbollah has warned that, should there be another conflict, it might adjust its military strategy and conduct cross-border operations. The growing range of Hezbollah’s rockets puts all of Israel in danger, though the relative success of the Israeli missile defense systems offers Israelis some comfort. Nevertheless, Hezbollah is in no mood for a clash with Israel.    I recommend reading the report in full: Hezbollah in Transition"
syriancivilwar,3dwysu,Meroghar,12,Mon Jul 20 12:35:55 2015 UTC,"ISIS got a ton of combat experience too in the civil war, specially vs Hezbollah. And then they were bombed to pieces. Same will happen to Hezbollah if they should make any funny moves."
syriancivilwar,3dwysu,monopixel,9,Mon Jul 20 08:34:05 2015 UTC,"ISIS got a ton of combat experience too in the civil war   This is ignoring the second point Clausewitz wrote on the topic. He wrote that actual combat experience, if survived by an Army, is the best possible form of training. With ISIS the prime term here is ""if survived"". ISIS I doubt will live long enough past the war to apply all the experience they have learned.   This doesn't just apply to Hezbollah but also (and possibly greater) the SAA. Drilling soldiers and conducting annual war games is a poor substitute for actual combat experience. With officers no amount of sitting in a classroom reading about military tactics beats being in the Lattakia mountains seizing hilltops from an enemy.   It's the best possible training environment a military can hope for... if they survive. SAA have evolved from a decaying Soviet model army to an adaptive leaner Army.    And then they were bombed to pieces. Same will happen to Hezbollah   If Israel were capable of bombing Hezbollah ""to pieces"", Hezbollah wouldn't have survived past the 1990's. You think if Israel was confident they could get rid of Hezbollah they wouldn't have done it already? What are they waiting for?   On the other topic someone posted on ""draining"" Hezbollah, they will be waiting a long time. Any Syrian death toll that Hezbollah is suffering is a fraction of what they lost during the 1980's civil war or the 1990's Israeli occupation. And came out of both of them stronger."

But sure a lot of the ground troops have had to adapt to guerrilla warfare, become more mobile and fast to respond, learned a lot more on both urban and rural warfare, probably how to move well in their units.   Also likely many commanders/generals coming up who are more competent than the previous generation. Overall its an adapt or die situation for the SAA."

The SAA have lost the ability to effectivly use combined arms.  SAA have degraded massively."
syriancivilwar,3dwysu,dragon_nipples,-11,Mon Jul 20 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"I think there'd be a lot of uproar if Hezbollah was attacked by U.S/Israel given how popular it is online, and as a reflection, probably in real life. Hell, they seem to still have Christian support in Lebanon as well, and do not seem to be anti-Jewish, but rather anti-Zionist and anti-Imperialist. As Israel is acting, in there eyes, as an imperialist-Zionist state, they see it as a target that must be destroyed. That's not to be confused with them wanting to destroy Judaism or all Jews.   But, at the same time, who's really there to stand up against the United States or Israel? That would be a step towards war if another country opposed a U.S-Israeli attack on Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon.   EDIT: Ok, I'm really sick of debating this shit with you guys. It was actually kind of good at first, but now that you're starting to simply dismiss all of my arguments on the basis that I'm ""brainwashed"", trolling, or kidding, then I refuse to continue debating this.

syriancivilwar,3dwysu,uncannylizard,13,Mon Jul 20 14:33:22 2015 UTC,Two bombings in Argentina and one in London during the 90s have been widely attributed to them. One of the Argentinian bombings was against a Jewish Cultural Centre killing 85 whereas the other one and the London bombing were against the Israeli embassies. I could possibly see the distinction you try to make when it comes to attacking embassies but there is no way attacking a Jewish cultural centre is not anti-semitic in nature - likewise the 2012 Bulgaria bombing of a tourist bus.   However much people on this site might like it to be otherwise (and do their best to try and argue it so) the facts are plain - Hezbollah are an anti-semitic terrorist organisation.
syriancivilwar,3dwysu,Phil_Sayers,-6,Mon Jul 20 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"To my understanding, as having gained from this sub, the Bulgaria bus bombings is actually very weakly linked. It's quite possible that that didn't happen. Along with Hezb diwavowing Suicide attacks and moving closer and closer to Lebanon and the Lebanese establishment, it seems Hezbollah have shifted from their terrorist history. How completely is anyone's guess.  Besides that, let's not forget that the the Israeli invasion of and actions in Lebanon could definitely be referred to as terrorism."

I don't know how likely a preemptive strike by Israel vs Hezbollah is. I just want to point out, regarding OP question, that Hezbollah's combat experience is not worth a lot, considering what happens to ground forces without any air support or good AA (like, better than manpad) when they meet a decent air force (which I believe Israel has), as showcased by US air force vs ISIS. And that doesn't even factor in that the US air force would also massively support Israel if Hezbollah should make any serious aggressive moves vs Israel."

Israel is the one most likely to make a ""funny move"" given the support Israel has behind it. Israel can practically act with impunity, but only to an extent. If they were to go too far with an invasion or an attack, Hezbollah would be the first to take up arms and fight them, whether it is on their land or in coordination with the governing body of the land that was attacked."

That's like saying by the Americans invading Germany, that they were against the German people and wanted to kill all of them. If a religion establishes a state, and then acts in unfavorable terms to their neighboring countries by taking their land, and that neighbor decides to attack them, then that does not mean the neighbor is anti-state's religion. They are against the actions of that state.   Israel's nation is modern. It is not secular, by any stretch, however.

There's also a fair few videos of Christians and Muslims being harassed in orthodox Jewish areas, but I won't count those in my decision on whether I think Israel is secular or not.   There's also plenty of videos of secular jews, IDF soldiers, police officers, and government employees being harassed in orthodox Jewish areas. These guys aren't exactly friendly towards outsiders, and are not the norm.  The point i'm trying to stress is that saying ""Israel isn't secular"" is waaaaay more of a stretch than people make it to be. The only possible point in Israeli law in which religion clashes with secular values in a way that actually affects anyone is marriage, and that's a hotly debated topic within Israel itself.

The United States is probably the most ""secular"" country you and I can think of, but even they have ""in god we trust"" on their money.   Countries can be more secular or less secular.

I can violate the sabbath, in every way I want to, and no state institution is allowed to do anything about that. Same with fasts and holidays.  I can buy pork. In fact, I can buy pretty much any non kosher product I want, and consume it whenever I want.  If I apply for a job, and the person interviewing me decides to deny me of that job because I am Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Atheist, or any other religious denomination or lack of religious denomination, I can take him to court.   But I can't marry someone who has a different faith than me. It's not illegal per se, there's no law which says ""Palestinians and Jews can't marry!"". It's simply a consequence of the fact that civil marriage does not exist in Israel. However, Israel does recognize any marriage done abroad, so that's basically a giant loophole for anyone who wants to get married anyway. It's also a topic of great controversy, and it's pretty clear to me that with increasing public support, civil marriage is going to come to Israel sooner rather than later.  One facet. One single facet of the country, marriage, is not secular. That doesn't mean the country, as a whole, is more religious than it is secular."

Notice how the FBI aided in the investigation of the first suspect, a 29 year old Hezbollah operative, while they did not investigate the other suspects, who did not have Hezbollah connections. Seeing as how Hezbollah is anti-Zionism and anti-Israeli (Israel STATE, not Judaism!) the United States would have a lot to gain from doing a poor job of an investigation with little evidence to convict the Hezbollah operative of the attack.

Unless we're gonna call Jabhat al-Nusra and like equipped groups (who actually operate armor and artillery on a large scale) armies as well.

syriancivilwar,3dwysu,ElBurroLoc0,8,Mon Jul 20 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"I think he was leaning towards the latter. But I completey agree with you. Like its undeniable that Israel is the most powerful millitary force in the region, with its nuclear arsenal being only the tip of ice berg when it comes to millitary strength.   Iremember during the last Gaza intervention from purely a military point of view I was very impressed with certain IDF weapons. In particular those aiitstrikes that could dig through a certain amount of floors of a building, destroy the floors devoted to Hamas, whilst leaving the other civilian floors intact. I hadn't seen that quality of precision weaponry before (and yes I know acknowlege that civilian deaths also occurred during this conflict but I am specifically talking about millitary strength of s particular weapon right now for those reading this)  How ever like you said, Despite IDF's military superiority, occupying South Lebanon is still a very daunting. Arguably impossible if one was to consider the fact that Israeli political support would for any conflict in Lebanon would only have a finite amount of time, and I'd argue thaf a successful Israeli operation would require more time than that.   Wars like post-911 Afghanistan and Iraq went along way to supporting the narrative that conventional millitary strength and can only be useful to a certain extent. Extremely successful for removing regimes like Saddam and The Taliban, but not as successful in maintaining a sustained presence, and operating in counter-insurgency. I think this narrative, carries onto your example, I am sure Isrsel could bring down shock and awe on South Lebanon like no other country in the region could, but I think if they were to try and occupy and fight Hezbollah now within their territory of South Lebanon they would bring engaging a much more difficult challenge than during 2006z  Despite sustaining hundreds of deaths, Hezbollah has and will emerge from the conflict stronger in millitary terms. The conflict has been a perfect training ground for a whole new generation of Hezbollah recruits, meanwhile they have been able to train and hone thier tactics and military training.  Using thier drones in the Qalamoun offensively is a good example as Israeli would destroy I would bet almost every drone that crosses their border hence why Syria is a good training ground.As a result I think Hezbollah would be much more millitary trained, armed experienced and prepared for another Israeli intervention than earlier periods in modern history"

syriancivilwar,3e08wg,Goldilocks-smile,5,Mon Jul 20 23:25:17 2015 UTC,"As is typical with articles on Hezbollah's state of affairs this too is filled with suppositions, rumour and hearsay.   One example:   Perhaps that’s why 60 percent of Shiites say they’d like to see the Army have a monopoly on weapons in Lebanon by 2025—a stunning sentiment given that Nasrallah said in 2006 that Hezbollah would “cut the hand and head of those who attempt to disarm it by force and rip their souls out.”       Firstly the article gives no details on how this polling was carried out or how many people were in fact polled. Secondly even assuming it is an accurate reflection of Shia sentiments it's completely misinterpreted.   To start with Nasrallah's quote is taken out of context, a context in which he is clearly speaking in the short-medium term. Furthermore the idea that hezbollah will one day cede its weapons and military capabilities to the army is not a ""stunning sentiment"" as the article states. It is in fact an end goal of Hezbollah. Hezbollah justifies its weapons on the basis that the army is not capable of defending against an Israeli attack which we all know to be true. In addition it is clear that the army in it's current state could not function without the support of nations strongly allied with Israel. When such a time arrives that the army is largely reliant on the state's own resources and the resources of nations friendly to Lebanon and not israel or when Israel is no longer a threat to Lebanon (i.e via peace treaties), then Hezbollah will gladly give up its weapons. This is known and spoken about among the party and it's supporters. It's nothing new, but also not going to happen anytime soon, hence the 2025 thing.  And to be clear here, because I'm sure I have to be, I'm not saying I support or agree with the logic or merits of any of this, I'm simply stating what I know to be the general beliefs among the party's supporters and members and how that contradicts what this article is trying to say."
syriancivilwar,3e08wg,VCGS,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:24:02 2015 UTC,"Hezbollah isn't there to defend Lebanon. It's turned it into a Iranian missile base to further Iran's foreign policy objectives. Nasrallah clearly states (in public) his intention is the destruction of Israel, and that no Arab leader has the right to give up any land from the river to the sea.  Hezbollah launched the 2006 war by kidnapping 2 solders in order to get Sami Kuntar back. Israel didn't just randomly decide one day to attack Lebanon. Was this in Lebanon's interest? Who gave Hezbollah the right to determine whether Lebanon launches a war or not? Did Israel respond by attacking all of Lebanon or just Hezbollah? What sort of defence of Lebanon is this? What did they actually defend? Does Hezbollah have the right to murder Lebanon's Prime Minister? I know Hezbollah fans have a difficult time answering these questions but what you've written takes the cake in justifying Hezbollah which is Lebanon's cancer."

This is actually pretty good for Hezbollah - if the organisation shifts from ""resisting Zionism"" to ""defending the interests of Lebanese Shi'ites"" by focusing more on salafist groups, that's a big way to drop the remaining heat on their back from the west. The only people that have an issue with Hezbollah killing members of Al-Qaeda are those in Doha and Riyadh."

As LiesAboutknowingyou once analysed, an ATGM can't be used well in urban scenarios, so VBIEDS can unleash their onslaught unchecked. With the AT4 the Iraqi Army has a potent anti VBIED weapon that is easy and fast to use.   The thing I don't get is why the Iraqi Army doesn't buy old RPG-29s."

syriancivilwar,3dxcu0,rudimentarypolitics,3,Mon Jul 20 18:55:25 2015 UTC,"That's one of the worst parts about facing VBIED's in urban areas, is that by the time you are able to engage it, you are likely in a dangerous radius. If you're an optimist, you might argue that the second shot he took (at the dumb truck VBIED) was intended for the wheels, but I have heard that they are more difficult to aim due to the lack of a barrel, unlike the AT-4.  /u/LiesAboutKnowingYou did an excellent write up on why ATGM systems are great, but not practical in urban areas such as this one. Main points:   ATMGs often require 100-300m to stabalize Due to battery life and optic sensitivity, they cannot be setup indefinitely Cost, training, and availability are much worse in comparison to shoulder launched AT"
syriancivilwar,3dxcu0,Cammanjam,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:40:09 2015 UTC,"Took a single hit not ""hits"", and honestly it looks like he hit one of the tires or something low to the ground.

syriancivilwar,3dxcu0,SaxonMeister,7,Mon Jul 20 09:46:56 2015 UTC,I suspect that has more to do with the far greater effective range and chances of hitting the VBIED than it does with penetration. AT4 is just another unguided shoulder-launched weapon so that's not much of an improvement.

You're comparing apples and oranges though. Neither a pickup nor a safir-1 are competitors to a HMMWV. They aren't the same class of vehicle.   There are other armoured vehicles that are cheaper and offer similar capability to the HMMWVs. So while they are good, they aren't all that cheap when there are plenty of alternatives. If we want to go down the ""saves valuable lives"" mantra then you can justify just about any exorbitant military purchase. Iraq recently had it's first locally manufactured Russian MRAP.

The commanders left, and the soldiers followed. The division had lots of Sunni Arabs disillusioned with Maliki's regime and many Sunni Kurds some of whom were previously in peshmerga. You can see why this would cause problems. Some concise info on the division's organization is here  In terms of the commanders, Maliki was making purges to put his personal loyalists into commanding positions in the military (who tended to be pretty incompetent and corrupt, and when Abadi become PM and Obeidi became Def. Min., they had their own reorganization of the military which included sacking many officers). However, I don't know whether or not the commanding officers of the 2nd division were Maliki's guys, but either way, they just deserted once ISIS came."
syriancivilwar,3du9n9,sunbolts,0,Sun Jul 19 20:15:23 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons for the failure of Iraqi army in the north was the makeup of the divisions in control of the city. The two military divisions in the Mosul area were the 3rd division on the western side of the Tigris and the 2rd division on the eastern. Both of these divisions were heavily Kurdish Sunni and Sunni Arab. The Sunni Arabs soldiers in western Mosul were a mix of loyal servants of the country and ex jihadist's. By the time ISIS made their way into Mosul most of the loyal ones were dead and the ones left sympathetic to the jihadist and ready to join or flee ISIS when the time came. On the eastern side of the river the 2nd Division was an utter shambles, full of disloyal former Peshmerga that had no loyalty at all to Iraq and ready to flee at any sign of trouble , which is exactly what they did. So as you can see it's not as simple as, the whole Iraqi army is full of cowards ready to flee at a moment's notice, you have to look at the local dynamics to really understand what happened in the north.  I will leave you with this quote about the loyalty of the Kurdish soldiers in Mosul which should tell you a lot about some of the soldiers in Mosul before its fall.   The soldiers admit that while they wear Iraqi army uniforms they still consider themselves members of the Peshmerga and are awaiting orders from Kurdish leaders to break ranks. There have been persistent doubts among Iraqi Arabs as to the loyalty of the heavily Kurdish units in IA   Link: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7Fxn2L6YxM8C&pg=PA572&lpg=PA572&dq=2nd+Division+Iraqi+army+kurdish&source=bl&ots=4NkspsAw3x&sig=pkM-L_VheHFIBi4wcLZEwwxoabU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8dEBVcO1G8nqau35grAP&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=2nd%20Division%20Iraqi%20army%20kurdish&f=false"

Kurds didnt even compromise 20% of the fighters in mosul.   That is a 2006 article. Maliki changed the whole structure of the army and put in a sectarian shiite army.   Even before the departure of US troops, Prime Minister Maliki sought to put people loyal to him in key command positions. With the Americans gone, this phenomenon accelerated. Command positions became increasingly prone to decisions taken on sectarian or family lines. Corruption was rife - the very antithesis of the sort of professional military the US had hoped to create. Increasingly, the military came to be seen as a sectarian force - one used by the Maliki government for its own ends. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27838435   Arab Iraqi soldier who fled to Kurdistan after fleeing from ISIS and are waiting to be transformed home meaning that they aren't kurds:   Most of the fleeing soldiers sought refuge in Erbil, the capital of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, where they are waiting to be transferred back home. Fahd thanked “[Kurdish] Peshmerga forces for saving us from ISIS.” Another quote:  The Iraqi Ministry of Defense has said it will offer free flights back home to soldiers stuck in Erbil. However not all Iraqi soldiers were able to flee the ISIS advance, with local and international media reporting that the militant group killed hundreds of soldiers. http://www.aawsat.net/2014/06/article55333248/iraqi-soldiers-who-fled-isis-advance-accuse-officers-of-treason   Hmm, strange that Kurds are supposed to be the one that fled but the Iraqis get offered free flights to their own places from Kurdistan after fleeing ISIS."
syriancivilwar,3du9n9,Reditski,4,Sun Jul 19 22:04:58 2015 UTC,"To be fair, almost all of the remaining territory in Iraq is overwhelmingly Shia or Kurdish at this point so ISIS is fairly limited in what they can actually achieve. They can't expect to get more recruits from any territory they potentially take in Iraq and everyone living there is extremely hostile to them."

syriancivilwar,3du9n9,DoubleVincent,17,Sun Jul 19 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"It's referring to the percentage of fighting incidents between IS and Sunni rebels, rather than the FSA being 57% of the total rebel manpower, and it's probably an accurate figure. FSA groups led the offensives that expelled IS from Idlib and much of Aleppo, and man most of the front in northern Aleppo. Then there are the FSA groups operating alongside the YPG, which have seen the most sustained fighting against IS of any rebel groups in the past year or so.   Salafist-oriented groups have a greater tendency to avoid fighting, and have some internal issues of certain groups and commanders refusing to fight IS."

syriancivilwar,3du9n9,AlexanderTheLame,9,Sun Jul 19 19:26:36 2015 UTC,"In Syria, the Kurds will finish off Sarrin and advance on the Tishrin Dam, take ground south of Hasakah after ISIS is pushed out of the city in order to provide a buffer zone for their territory, but I don't think the Kurds will go any further than that. In the rest of Syria the place to watch is Palmyra where the government's current primary offensive against ISIS is going on, which will essentially be the goverment's main contribution to defeating ISIS. In Iraq there is much more room for expansion for the coalition against ISIS. Although unlikely, you could see Kurdish move against Sinjar and the surrounding area, the place to watch however is Anbar. Iraqi forces are planning major offensives on both Ramadi and Fallujah which could provide us with some of the biggest gains against ISIS of this war. As for losses, I do believe ISIS can only go downhill from here, but if I did have to choose areas vulnerable to ISIS expansion I would pick the Haditha pocket in Anbar and the Deir al zor and eastern Qalamoun pockets in Syria."

I wonder if normal armies tried that tactic how many volunteers they could get. WW2 Japan would do well... but beyond that I'm not sure.   I'm guessing the Vikings or other non-modern armies might be willing to suicide bomb. The vikings because of their belief system, and the others because a lot of times if you lost the battle it means you were dead, your wife raped, and your house burned down.  If the US army had people volunteer for some type of anti-ISIS suicide bombing that was guaranteed to kill 1000 of their soldiers it might workout.

I only say that for two reasons; firstly, I was under the impression that most, if not all of IS' recruits were willing and ready to be martyred.  Secondly, the seemingly static and slow nature of IS' advances recently may indicate that they're finding it harder to gain ground as fast as they're used to for various reasons.

Other than Arabs/Kurd areas of influence (which are not at all clear-cut either), no “acceptable” separation line will be possible to implement. Certainly not the Alawite/sunni crap we hear from “middle east experts”.  The thing is both sides want Syria, the whole of Syria, to themselves.

The major difference was that back then there was a state of Aleppo, and a state of Damascus, and that was pretty much it. Aleppo was the jewel, and Damascus was kind of reclusive sitting in the shadow of Aleppo.   I think there is an end to the conflict in sight, an end that won't dissolve the union. I think that solution begins with the changing of the constitution, holding parliamentary elections, dissolving the military, and the election of someone like Mouaz Al-Khatib who is a respected pro-opposition figure by both loyalists and supporters of the opposition. He has no blood on his hands, he called for a political solution long long ago and reiteratted that call a few days ago, and he respects Syria's sovereignty and diversity."

Now that was what made the opposition politicians furious, but really only pissed off a minority of opposition supporters. Opposition supporters and loyalist supporters alike like Mouaz Al-Khatib because he's willing to talk and to take the middle ground that will appease opposition supporters and loyalists alike.   He's very well respected among the armed opposition because of his calmness and his religious background. They may disagree with him, but he's respected nevertheless.   I don't think an existing loyalist figure can become a future leader of Syria. Those who've publicly criticized the regime and been subsequently exiled or imprisoned can become effective future leaders. In the same way that Zahran Alloush could not be a leader of Syria, Jaafari and Mustafa cannot either.

The current de facto lines are terrible. You have cities split in half (good luck getting a side to give up their half of Aleppo); you have no way to link up the northern rebel areas (Idlib, Aleppo) with the south (Daraa) via land swaps alone . Not to mention the half of the country under Daesh control which is totally impredictable.  Tell me what in terms of population separates northern Hama from Southern Idlib? what separates eastern Aleppo from Western Aleppo? You will have families split across two countries, within the same city. What could be more artificial?   Your solution could stop the war now..

Iran, Turkey and maybe Iraq taking a section each. Current government wont be a factor at all towards the end. Their downfall will come very suddenly when they reach exhaustion level, and front after front quickly implodes. If they are what I think they are, very near that point they will attempt a grand offensive on a scale hitherto not seen, but far too late, and once that stonewalls theyll have no reserves to shore up the counter.

syriancivilwar,3dvccz,Messicus,5,Sun Jul 19 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"The Old Testament is part of the bible. So saying their is no stoning in the bible is factually wrong. Christianity has and always will be tied to Mosaic law. Why do you think every modern bible still contains no less than 24 books of the Hebrew bible. Jesus didn't outline a lot on the daily affairs or circumstances of people, he was basically just a hippy who focused on the spiritual and internal domains. However when questioned on certain things pertaining to those domains he usually differed to mosaic laws and gave answers that make modern Christians very uneasy:  “Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets; I came not to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished” (Mt. 5:17-18).  15:4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. 15:5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; 15:6 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. 15:7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,   [Jesus admonishing the Pharisees for their hypocrisy in not stoning disobedient children, seemingly given tacit support to Mosaic law]  10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 10:35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. 10:36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. 10:37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.   [Not as peaceful as some would wish you to think. Here Jesus is stating his intention to break apart families because of the faith, seemingly with violence.]  Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; Ephesians 6:5   [A little bonus Paul supporting Mosaic slavery laws by telling slaves to serve their masters well.]  Also the cognitive dissonance with some modern Christians is pretty funny, they decry the old testament as though it has no power and think that Jesus overturned it. then recite the necessary ten commandments that any good Christian should follow without even stopping to think about the contradiction."
syriancivilwar,3dvccz,Commisar,2,Sun Jul 19 22:37:46 2015 UTC,I am a little dated on my religion but I do believe he is right.  The old testament is a carry over from the Jews and their torah that gives a base.  The new testament is the what Christians follow.  This is why main stream Christianity preach Job over Leviticus.
syriancivilwar,3dvccz,DoctorExplosion,0,Sun Jul 19 21:59:26 2015 UTC,"My comment was an attempt to show that the two testaments are inseparable. you can't have a religion based on another without their being crossover, and this crossover is much more prevalent than OP or other modern Christians would wish it to be. I outlined in my comment multiple circumstances in the New Testament where Jesus and Paul specifically endorse or give support to certain Mosaic law in order to show that They did not decry, but supported such things. Many modern Christians do what all other moderate religious people do, they carry the baggage of an ancient barbaric book with them and try to cherry pick it to make it fit with their modern life and secular society. Basic cafeterias religion; Christians want all the gentle Jesus meek and mild without the cruel and frankly evil aspects that come along with the worship of the bible. It would have been much better for modern Christians if the Catholic Church and other schools had dropped the Old Testament and started anew as theologians like Marcian wished in the early days of christianity, however the others knew that do to so would be disingenuous. You can't have Jesus without mosaic law, despite what modern Christians WISH, the two are connected. Just an aside to your point about Job instead of Leviticus. One could argue that Job is a much more evil and callous book than Leviticus. God tortures and punishes an innocent man for not being enough of a slave, then becomes even more angry when the man who he just took everything from still doesn't like him for some reason. The whole book is a about a jealous God who punishes people for not being his slaves so that he can enlarge his own ego. Disgusting stuff really, and the last stuff that should be taught to children as the truth."

That would be starting another proxy conflict just like Iraq. Obama knows this, Israel knows this, and at this point I think Iran and Assad know it.  Look at the facts: The US has explicitly avoided striking the SAA, SyAAF and Assad personally. There are certainly plans laid out for a coup or some 'regime change' operation and the CIA is probably itching to implement it, as they always are, but it's not going to happen because Assad has de-facto approval of the State department... basically because he's a lot better that IS  or the islamists. The US would much rather deal with Assad and his secular government than some new levant wahhabi deal.  The only way the rebels are going to win now is if Iran breaks the treaty, they have no chance of beating Assad without US help and sadly for them it's not coming. The sad part for the FSA and the rebels is the US is just using them as cannon fodder against ISIS. They are going to be mighty pissed in 2025 when Syria still exists, ISIS is gone, and the US military has abandoned them to their fate.   Turkey would rather support ISIS than the FSA, and Qatar is just $, no real technical or logistical or even labor help. KSA is tied down by it's obligations to the US and even if it wasn't, they're hardly a match for the SAA/SyAAF/Hezbollah  Edit: Would like to add that I recognize Assad is a Tyrant and he runs a police/surveillance state that abuses and murders and tortures it's citizens on a whim. Guess what other government does all these things too? We're just better about cleaning up after ourselves. Why do you think Obama refuses to release the tapes from Guantanamo? We have to keep our clean image. So don't think that Assad is somehow unique. In many ways the US government and the Assad Regime will get along swimmingly, especially in regards to surveillance and policing."
syriancivilwar,3dvigt,EWbroWTF,8,Mon Jul 20 00:34:25 2015 UTC,Good summary. I'd also like to add that we already have confirmation of Assad working with the US government in their extraordinary rendition program.
syriancivilwar,3dvigt,Leadback,2,Mon Jul 20 01:32:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I read the cables. They helped out, I believe a few other rogue states are/were involved too (Libya?). I know Egypt has been a favorite place for the CIA for like 30 years now..."
syriancivilwar,3dvigt,EWbroWTF,3,Mon Jul 20 01:44:08 2015 UTC,"I believe so, yeah. Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me at all if Syria returned to being an unfriendly-but-useful state to the west after the war ends. Look at modern Vietnam - a one-party authoritarian communist state that handed the US their only comprehensive defeat of the 20th century, yet today they're cozying up to Washington and taking military support to counterbalance China's rise. And Syria hasn't killed 60k US military personnel either.   If a greater threat arose in the Middle East - for example, a belligerent Gulf axis that no longer stayed in the west's pocket or a Turkey pushing regional hegemony in spite of Israel - we could easily see the west return to using Assad. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if the CIA was looking at elements of the regime that have vocally disapproved of Iran's influence, like that MP or the now-deceased security chief, in order to undermine the resistance axis."
syriancivilwar,3dvigt,Leadback,-5,Mon Jul 20 01:49:28 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a US defeat because the US left before South Vietnam even fell. And the only reason the US ""lost"" was because it had a lousy strategy which made an invasion of North Vietnam, the only way to win was a big NO.  Counterbalancing China is just an excuse to gain more aid, their is no way Vietnam can beat China in a military conflict. Plus China is Vietnam largest source of imported good."

This option would had required more troops and a better strategy to succeed.  2. Invade NV and removed the source of weapons, supply and troops that was invading the south. This plan was never used because the US was always afraid of wider war with China."
syriancivilwar,3dvigt,defend435,3,Mon Jul 20 03:19:41 2015 UTC,"True.  And unfortunately for the US, it turned out to be a misplaced fear. The CCP was far too pre-occupied with the cultural revolution to mount an effective war against the US. But even that aside, the US was so scared of China they didn't even aggressively start bombing the Sino-Vietnamese rail links until the Christmas bombing. And the port in Haiphong was left relatively untouched for most of the war. The US made little to no effort, for most of the war, in trying to interdict and sever Sino-Vietnamese supply routes out of political fear.  ..And yet, the US had no qualms about bombing dirt paths in the HCM trail in neutral Laos and Cambodia, or annihilating vast swathes of jungle in the very nation they were suppose to be defending."
syriancivilwar,3dvigt,DoctorWitten,-3,Mon Jul 20 06:47:53 2015 UTC,Learn your history again. The US left in 1973. Hence Nixion was rushing the peace plan so that he could withdraw the troops with honor. South Vietnam was the one who truly lost.
syriancivilwar,3dvigt,defend435,8,Mon Jul 20 03:17:17 2015 UTC,"South Vietnam also lost, yes. The fact that North Vietnam overran the South and formed a communist government that has lasted to this day was an unequivocal defeat for Washington. Spin that any way you like."
syriancivilwar,3dvigt,Leadback,-5,Mon Jul 20 03:20:15 2015 UTC,Your used of defeat implied the US lost the war to 3rd world nation and suffered greatly from that failure. On the contrary the US just choose to pick a new investment that was more worthwhile for it foreign policy China. The soviet union invading Afghanistan was a defeat because that led directly to the collapse of the government.   I don't have to spin anything.
syriancivilwar,3dvigt,defend435,6,Mon Jul 20 03:26:07 2015 UTC,US strategic political aims in Vietnam were comprehensively defeated. Is that more specific for you? Since your argument rests on the basis of inferences that few others make.

syriancivilwar,3dvigt,EWbroWTF,0,Mon Jul 20 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"This analysis doesn't make a lot of sense to me. The US isn't switching to Iran's side, rather it is switching to focusing on a balance of powers model in the middle east.  It's ""status"" whatever that is, won't protect Assad.  The US wants to make sure that no sides are so much stronger than the other side in order to prevent a regional super power.  The US is going to step up its support of the Gulf states for that reason.  Assad may want to use this as a propaganda victory so that it increases the morale of his supporters, but nothing has really changed for him.  Iran was already giving him as much support as it could without endangering a war with the gulf states. After the deal, Iran has even more reason to be cautious of war with the gulf states.  Of course, Iran will be a part of a negotiated solution to Syria (if one ever happens).  But that won't happen because of the deal, that will happen because the war is a stalemate.  It has been before the deal and it will be after the deal."

I think it is hard to underestimate how much the Gulf States hate-fear Iran.  I think it would start w/ Jordan establishing a buffer zone and then the gulf states start airstrikes against Assad, and Iran retaliating w/ missile strikes on GCC oil production.  How much of a risk is there for that? I don't know but it is pretty horrible outcome to mess around with.  This is especially true because a stalemate suits Iran's needs just fine.  Iran needs Syria to have a guaranteed way of supplying Hezbollah.  Iran doesn't need a strong an vibrant Syria.  It needs a Syria w/ a safe port and a safe supply route to Lebanon.  If Syria is broken up or severely weakened in the long term it would be even better because then it will be completely dependent on Iran and Hezbollah."

Weren't there reports they were rounding up and arresting Ba'ath loyalists within Mosul months ago? And after everything that's happened how can any legitimate Iraqi Ba'athist remain silent and countenance what ISIL's doing? They have an open intention to destroy Iraq."

syriancivilwar,3dwzto,ShiteDog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:57:56 2015 UTC,"First of all, chlorine is a relatively harmless chemical weapon when compared to other CWs, such as sarin. Also, the delivery mechanism (suicide bombs) is incredibly ineffective - the gas won't dissipate. Mortars might be effective as long as there is no explosion.   Assad uses chlorine barrel bombs, but without explosives (which is why they work). Any other delivery mechanism would not work. So overall, this is more of a 'terror' weapon, then something that will gain an actual tactical advantage.  An issue with this investigation is that it is being carried out by two UK based groups. Absolutely nobody will take this investigation seriously; at best it will be a piece of evidence that the US can use. I doubt Russia would be opposed to investigating this issue (unlike defending Assad), but these two organizations do not have the credibility, or the expertise when compared to the OPCW.   Overall interesting developments, but it won't lead to much unless picked up by the OPCW."

Why do Damascus Sunnis recieve rockets? 74% of syria is sunni, but that doesn't mean 74% is Takfiri Islamist. The urban Sunnis dispise the opposition.   The opposition bedded with Extremists and let them in, and so lost all approval of those million syrians who still live under thd government.

Sigh Goldilocks I can't believe you are still pushing this same narrative. Like being a Sunni in Syria means you are anti-Assad. There are Sunnis from Aleppo, to Homs, to Damascus and Dier Ez Zour who fight for Assad or at least his version of Syria. If 74% of the population was automatically against Assad because they were Sunni; then this war would have ended a long time ago. But no that was simply not the case because whether you can accept it or not, There are a significant amount of Sunni's that support Assad.   It's honestly sad you cling to pushing something which has so universally been accepted as false. 3/4 Syrians are not automatically against Assad simply because they are Sunni. That completely ignores historical facts regarding Assads support amongst Sunni populations all over Syria"

Don't forget thousands of Kurds live in Al-Asad areas like Damascus. Without fighting the same enemy, without working (not together) but in tandem, we would be fighting them and they would be rounding up Kurds in their areas faster than you could count them"".  Hardly a recommendation for the nation's future unity?   It genuinely grieves me to witness the continuing levels of death and destruction when it's all too apparent that the regime of Bashar al-Assad will never be capable of bringing the country together.   It's a slow war of attrition - mathematically, it's simply a numbers game. Why wait for that eventual tipping point?  The extended Assad family and their regime echelons remain safe within their Damascus stronghold.  But what of the cannon fodder?  The nation's husbands, sons, brothers, nephews - all of whom are fighting and dying on a DAILY basis for a lost cause?  Simply an unforgivable waste of human life.

syriancivilwar,3duosa,Goldilocks-smile,-1,Tue Jul 21 07:54:10 2015 UTC,"I fully understand that there are many Sunni's within Syria who support Assad.  Particularly so, the more affluent amongst those citizens.  But I would strongly suggest there are MILLIONS more who certainly don't.  The vast majority of citizens who took to their streets were Sunni.  Sunni's who had lived for decades and who were forced to suffer quietly under the heel of their nepotistic Alawite masters.   As with most countries within the ME - religion forms a massively important and exponential component within the fabric of Syrian society.  The average Sunni family is comprised of six people. Over three million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries while a further 6.5 million citizens are displaced.  Assad has made this a sectarian war and remains in power only because of his bankers, the Mullahs of Iran and its host of Shiite proxies.                                           Each time an explosive barrel-bomb reduces their homes to rubble, those seething levels of Sunni hatred reverberate exponentially throughout the nation.  And too, across those neighbouring camps where many millions look on from afar - aghast.   They remember the destruction of Baba Amr, the chemical attack on Ghouta, the Houla massacre, the 'Caesar' torture report and yes even the Hama massacre of 1982.   To suggest that the majority of Sunni's support this Shiite-fed regime is an insult to one's intelligence.  Pure propaganda.  No more. No less.

In general the opposition has been on the back foot in the southern front this year. The government made gains in southern Riff Damishiq, and eastern Deraa Gov south of the Lajat region, and in Qunietra along the border. This was much earlier in the year and besides the opposition being forced to abandon any moves into Suwayda Governorate nothing much has happened.  I wouldn't say the rebels are on the back foot but considering the southern front is going to the governments major target once it's operations in the Qalamoun region are finished expect to see some renewed fighting sometime in the next year or so."

syriancivilwar,3dusqw,iComeWithBadNews,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:06:52 2015 UTC,The locals probably just hope after 4 years of war that they and their homes dont come between the frontlines. And Zahrredine is still most likely more feared by the local population than admired.

syriancivilwar,3dvuqn,mindblues,2,Mon Jul 20 02:58:03 2015 UTC,"I need to put an edit on my original post. I'm talking about well known news here in the States. You and I, and every other American on this sub, are obviously interested in this conflict and are much more likely to seek out breaking news from the region.  However, when it comes to the general American public being informed through traditional media? Yes, I'm entirely serious and I stand behind that. How many Americans do you think are seeking Kurdish news out whether it be via YouTube (like this interview), liking the Lions of Rojava Facebook, or downloading news apps that carry these articles (much less reading them)? Very few IMO.  This isn't in the forefront of American news in any way shape or form, again, unless you are interested and seek it out on your own; few exceptions aside."

Especially among military communities and their families (which is in the millions) the memes of US fighters going off to fight with the Kurds, the memory from veterans who fought in Iraq, the nascent knowledge that Saddam gassed the Kurds, even my incredibly redneck father-in-law in rural rural south knows who the Kurds are and thinks of them as America's friends.  I think there's considerably more consciousness of who the Kurds are, at least in this abstract ""They're the good Muslims in the Middle East, right?"" fantasy manner than you seem to believe to be the case. Perhaps we just exist in different circles but I can't think of a single person I know who couldn't at least tell you ""Kurds are a people group in the Middle East and they've helped the US"".

If you want any information, by and large, you need to search for it here. There are some exceptions, as you have pointed out.

In that regard, there is nothing exceptional about this (although hearing the ginger guy speak Arabic with a lisp was unique).  But what caught my attention was the defensive works. For whatever reason I have always been fascinated by the defensive works of militaries around the world. The US and Britain have made an art form out of it in our conventional doctrine (and in our non-conventional doctrine). But in the Syrian conflict few sides seem to know how to build decent fortifications including two groups you'd expect to be great at it: Da3sh and Hezbollah.  The groups I've noticed who appear to be most proficient at building decent defensive works are actual SAA units (especially Republican Guard at DeZ) and JaN.

It's incredibly important to the people who live there. And it's hardly an inconvenience to have to know that cities have multiple names. If we were discussing war in Germany no one would be disturbed that both Cologne / Koeln or Munich / Muenchen were used. Different languages, different names. It is important to knowing the different names if one is to be even remotely informed on the conflict. Especially when it comes to border regions. During the siege of Kobani knowing that Mursitpinar, Murshid Binar, and the corresponding Arabic spelling were all the same place was of significant usage as different sources referred to it by different names.  Being an informed conflict observer in a land where multiple languages are spoken and multiple historic narratives are adhered to, means understanding that names change by the people who live there. I can speak wholeheartedly on behalf of the moderator team, there will be no policy to restrict the usage of geographical nomenclature to a single standard. Case closed."

Syrians of Kurdish ethnicity tend to see themselves as a part of Syria. Not all Kurds hate Arabs you know.  One of the presidents of Syria, I believe, was Kurdish (Before Hafez al assad of course, I don't remember his name). But I do not think the ypg would do something like this. They probably would, if they found evidence of the FSA doing some stupid stuff. But in the long term, after this war is over, Rojave will be free, and the FSA and non Kurdish forces will be expelled anyway afterwards, it just takes time. Plus I do not think the FSA is that big of a faction in Rojave to pose as much of a threat anyway. The FSA presence, from my observations, is probably really small."

syriancivilwar,3dumlz,777yourface,2,Sun Jul 19 17:52:47 2015 UTC,Around 500 according to Al-Dorar.
syriancivilwar,3dumlz,kebabji,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:23:51 2015 UTC,"Nope they dont need  to,. It is no primary target, because the airbase is disabled and the troops there are no threat at all for the rebels, so there is no need to sacrifice men and equipment there. They will continue besieging it till the spirit of the SAA there is broken and they surrender or till the are all dead, due to the bad humanitarian situation there. The government will also not be able to break the siege anytime soon. The overall number of troops is around 400-700 there."
syriancivilwar,3dumlz,Boerek1,2,Sun Jul 19 18:40:28 2015 UTC,"very true, there is only so much the regime can resupply the base with by air. Now that im thinking about it, it must be horrible to be besieged in that airfield for so long and being cut off from the world."
syriancivilwar,3dumlz,777yourface,2,Sun Jul 19 18:59:52 2015 UTC,"Actually I am very surprised how long Syrians are able to endure such besiegments. The SAA controls their a little village in the vicinity of the airport as well and this probaly ease up a little bit the hygenic problems there. I believe neverless that the airbase will fall this winter, because heating will be very difficult and the small rations of food and water will probably demand its tribute, so that the situation becomes unbearable."
syriancivilwar,3dumlz,Boerek1,2,Sun Jul 19 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered how resupply by air even works for them. Unless the area they control is pretty large airdrops are not going to cut it, since they might fall into rebel hands, right? And landing planes there must pretty risky since they have to get down into MANPAD range, which the rebels have plenty of. So how do they do it?"
syriancivilwar,3dumlz,MaslinuPoimal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"Unless the area they control is pretty large airdrops    They are exactley doing this. And they dont care if some of them are falling into the hands of the rebels, it is just water, food and probably some medecine and cigarettes.    And landing planes there must pretty risky since    No planes are landing there anymore since this January, because a horrible accident/shotdown of an Antonov carrier accured there and all 35 crewmembers died. The soldiers there get supplied via helicopter drops now. Nusra has antiaircraft guns there which work if you are just aiming at a landing plane."
syriancivilwar,3dumlz,Boerek1,4,Sun Jul 19 21:10:13 2015 UTC,Notice how these defections are becoming increasingly more common.

syriancivilwar,3dtpd6,P3TC0CK,10,Sun Jul 19 12:22:58 2015 UTC,She doesn't wear a Hijab normally going by her normal tweets. A lot of non-Muslims will wear it out of respect or for safety concerns with certain groups.

In Lebanon, regarding Jabhat Al Nusra (not even going to count your FSA seizing Arsal), there really isn't any shade of grey at all. They are unwanted, unwelcome and an aggressor force that has carried out car-bombings and terrorist attacks and has vowed many more. It really is that simple.

syriancivilwar,3dtpd6,AnaLaha89,6,Sun Jul 19 19:19:46 2015 UTC,What?
syriancivilwar,3dtpd6,iComeWithBadNews,8,Sun Jul 19 11:27:53 2015 UTC,"My God! She's a journalist, man! Interrogate her for doing her job? For showing Lebanese people how their POW are doing in captivity?"
syriancivilwar,3dtpd6,reebs81,15,Sun Jul 19 11:44:00 2015 UTC,"It would be fine if she did only what you said (with regards to showing the POW's being safe and unharmed), but if you follow her on twitter you will know her anti-Assad stance has translated into an anti-LAF stance and she is generally very complimentary towards Nusra (she visited them after Idlib fell as well if I'm not mistaken). How would Americans feel if an American journalist visited a terrorist group where they were keeping American soldiers hostage, and she took a picture like this, and was generally very supportive about them on twitter and visited hypothetical terrorist group and maintained friendly relations with them while they held American soldiers as hostages? Come on.  Like I said, theres no moral ambiguity. Taking the LAF hostages and ransoming them is a crime and will always be a crime. A journalist should know better than to legitimize Nusra's actions by doing something like this. This isn't Syria where people (non-Syrians) considers Al Nusra as a legitimate group challenging the Syrian government for power. In Lebanon Al Nusra doesn't want to set up a state or overthrow the government (despite whatever they say in their propaganda), they just want to sow violence and chaos and have said so as much."
syriancivilwar,3dtpd6,iComeWithBadNews,5,Sun Jul 19 12:23:29 2015 UTC,"I read through 20 days of her tweets to find tweets that support Nusra or terrorism in general and found nothing. Maybe didn't go far enough. He is certainly a march 14 supporter and refugees supporter and Hezbollah critic who has been granted the exclusive of being with the families of the refugees during their visit which is NOT incriminating unless you want to take her and all the parents to jail. Regarding her other visits, that's not incriminating. VICE news reporters have done the same.  I haven't heard of her, nor do I support her political affiliations... But she seems to be a non sectarian Lebanese Christian and I fully support that part. Based on what I've read she's a  Lebanese citizen with political views that disagree with yours.  To make things clear, I see the Nusra close to ISIS and disagree with what they've done in Qalamoon and do consider them enemies of LAF. They are, however, considered by many to be closer to FSA then ISIS and she seems to be one of those. I couldn't find anything that proves her to support Nusra over LAF, but she might have."
syriancivilwar,3dtpd6,AnaLaha89,3,Sun Jul 19 12:45:44 2015 UTC,"Check @Syricide for screenshots of her more infamous outbursts. In short she has made the following statements (paraphrasing):   Nusra are really ""ok"" and the US was too hasty with regards to listing them as a terrorist organization Nusra doesn't use suicide bombings against civilians (obviously misleading because regardless if they use suicide bombings or not they still do carry out bombings specifically targetting civilians with carbombs and such like they did in Dahiyeh and Homs). Nusra is a grass roots organisation and if the US had supported it they would have won the hearts and minds of syrians.   It's enough to give you an idea of how she really perceives Nusra. Bear in mind that she is Lebanese and is well aware of the bombings in Beirut as well as LAF Nusra clashes and every other dirty thing Nusra does to destabalise Lebanon. And unlike in Syria Nusra has no plans or grand designs for Lebanon. They have no intention of taking over the country and running it (because they know they have no chance, US/Israel/Iran/Gulf would never allow Leb to fall), they simply want to sow chaos and disorder."

Yeah, she a terrorist sympathizer when she tweets something like this: ""I don't see nationality, religion, colour, race, sex. I only see people. And I love them. All of them."" does she sound like a terrorist sympathizer to you?   How would Americans feel if an American journalist visited a terrorist group where they were keeping American soldiers hostage,   I don't know.. maybe get excited.. that they have a chance to see how they're prisoners are doing!   Most journalists have sources inside terrorist organizations. That's an essential part of their work. That doesn't make her a terrorist, that makes her a bloody good, brave journalist."

Please, she's a beiruti yuppy with a habshi or malaysian housemaid that she barks orders to. ""I only see people. And I love them. All of them"" unless your March 8 or pro-Assad.   How would Americans feel if an American journalist visited a terrorist group where they were keeping American soldiers hostage, I don't know.. maybe get excited.. that they have a chance to see how they're prisoners are doing!   Yeah sure. If Nusra was holding a single American hostage and an American reporter dared say anything remotely complimentary about them on twitter or even considered them as legitimate group (as Maloof does) he or she would be ostracised, outcast and very possibly charged with supporting terrorism. Having contacts within terrorist organizations is one thing and shilling for them and promoting their cause as legitimate is something else entirely, especially when said group has taken several soldiers hostage from your own country's armed forces."

A lot of American journalists did interviews with Al Qaida members. ABC did an interview with Bin laden even though he was wanted by the US government, German reporter who spent sometime with ISIS, Vice with their documentary on IS, remember when that first came out? How people accused Vice of supporting ISIS! etc.. Happens all the time. Nothing happened to those, as it should be.   And the US did like every government in the world prosecute journalists for simply doing their work. That's not right. Journalists have the right of speech just like others.

syriancivilwar,3dtpd6,eggalitarian,-3,Sun Jul 19 13:40:11 2015 UTC,"That by no means tells you she supports Nusra. If it tell you something, it tells of her worry for Syrians from the brutal Assad dictator and that she recognizes Al Nusra's vital rule in helping the rebels in their fight to gain freedom. She even says, ""Al Nusra are OK compared to others"" And she absolutely right, Al Nusra compared to Assad and Daish is an ANGEL not just ""OK"" . Why doesn't she support ISIS if she's that evil like you guys say!  And indeed, To me Al Nusra is not a terrorist organization. They're mostly Syrian with a Syrian Emir. They fight for Syrians not to establish an emirate or plot attacks against civilians targets or overseas. They issued an apology to the Druze community after the incident that happened, and promised them that those responsible will be brought to justice. They visit Christian churches to assure them that their sacred places are safe and nothing will harm them, gave orders of that.   That's not your typical Daish/AlQaida doings. That tells me they're serious and they're goal is to help in the fight to topple Assad.  And yes I am a Sunni Muslim. I don't see how it's relevant but..to satisfy you curiosity, I answered."

Also no matter how much I abhor Vice at least their journalists try to act neutral and maintain a documentary feel. If Vice journalists praised Daesh on twitter after visiting them then I would have supported prosecuting them too. Calling yourself a journalist isn't a free pass to do whatever you want and form friendships with groups that are actively attacking civilians in your country and are holding hostages from your army.

syriancivilwar,3dtwk0,Dutchbag1402,3,Sun Jul 19 13:53:28 2015 UTC,If Assad cedes autonomy to the entire Syrian-Turkey border to the YPG then Turkeys ways of entering the country become greatly limited.

syriancivilwar,3dti9o,Balak_Jewboma,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:56:44 2015 UTC,Almasdar again...  If this is true it'd be good to know how 'guided' these attacks were.
syriancivilwar,3dti9o,Weekdaze,2,Sun Jul 19 10:12:13 2015 UTC,Saw similar comments on twitter. Numbers could be (are?) exagerated obviously but they did strikes.
syriancivilwar,3dti9o,justkjfrost,-11,Sun Jul 19 10:17:05 2015 UTC,"Funny how all of news of Palmyra are from Masdar...  Although i have to agree this one is partly true, there have been over 90 airstrikes since the liberation of Palmyra, however most of them were on Tadmur itself and many civilians were killed and injured."
syriancivilwar,3dti9o,thelord4444,13,Sun Jul 19 11:17:23 2015 UTC,liberation   Is that why most people fled the city?
syriancivilwar,3dti9o,lux_sartor,-10,Sun Jul 19 11:32:58 2015 UTC,"They fled because of the bombs, there is no liberation with flowers and roses.  If we would follow your logic then nothing ever was a liberation."
syriancivilwar,3dti9o,thelord4444,2,Sun Jul 19 14:08:53 2015 UTC,"Although people will probably downvote you, you're absolutely correct that almost all reports on Palmyra have been from the 'news source' al Masdar. I'd wager what's actually happening is the SAA is hunkered down somewhere west of the city lobbing shells in its general direction while the SyAAF is doing what it excels at, unloading lots of ordinance with little tactical or strategic effect."
syriancivilwar,3dti9o,occupykony,0,Sun Jul 19 14:59:05 2015 UTC,But don't you know!? Any controversial opinion is a wrong opinion! The only fact is that the Syrian Arab Army will retake all of Syria shortly!

Hell, good battle experience is a serious investment. So you want to keep them alive and in one piece and sound of mind as long as possible and beyond that. Even ridiculously risky missions have an exit where they get out of it alive and in one piece.   Going behind the lines with no backup to rescue somebody commando from a sep basement with 50% failure risk ? Okay. Making a run in open ground and risking to get blown by arty ? Okay. You want to hold the ground at 1v10 ? Okay.   But i don't think i'd know any western or allied commander that would ever ask their own men to do outright explosive suicide (and if i did and were asked my opinion i'd outright fire/arrest them on the spot and i don't think i'm the only one). That's plain horrible and simply a no go."

On the other hand, fighting more conservatively using a smaller number of well-trained and equipped soldiers also works, and IMO is highly preferable.   Of course if you have an authoritarian government, it's a lot easier to do what the USSR dos since you don't have to answer to voters (aka the families of all the dead soldiers)."

From a military perspective the invasion was almost perfect.   Of course, American political leaders had no idea what they were doing and went into a country whose culture and religious divide they didn't understand at all. And then they made their job even harder by making stupid decisions like disbanding the army."

If you were right, it would be very easy for you to show that it was SF doing the thwarting. SF are more than eager to show everyone it is them doing the fighting. But they don't which is why you will not find more than 5 videos of them in close combat or post combat with captured weapons or prisoners. (you will only find them firing cannons from far away).  The people who take prisoners are the ones actually fighting in the South. Another example."
syriancivilwar,3dx92e,BigDickDaddy0779,6,Mon Jul 20 08:01:28 2015 UTC,"Contain them where?  In Syria, in Iraq, how about their new affiliates in North Africa, Sub Saharan Africa, Afghanistan?  How many millions should be expected to die in the name of some bringing Sunni together so they can slaughter minorities nationalism?  Besides they don't bring the Sunni's together.  The Kurds are mostly Sunni and they were happy to attempt a genocide of them.  And why should their neighbors tolerate them?  They send car bombs to Baghdad, and Karbala, kidnap women and children and sell them in sex slave markets in Raqqa all because slavery was allowed in the 7th century.  Jeeze man open your eyes and see them for what they are.  Are we supposed to abandon all the people there to live under this idiocy for generations in the naive hope that unspecified ""reforms"" will happen generations from now after they have genocided everyone who isn't a Sunni Arab willing to live a lifestyle from the 7th century?"
syriancivilwar,3dx92e,tacticoolant123,7,Mon Jul 20 08:28:38 2015 UTC,"Containing them tacitly legitimises their existence. It basically means everyone who participated in the Iraq War, particularly the US, admits defeat in the Iraqi nation-building project. It means that we have another Saddam-style totalitarian regime in the region, replacing Ba'athist nationalism with Islamic governance.   The Islamic State brings Sunni's together under one banner, one leader.   Easy to ""bring Sunnis together"" when you kill or exile all the ethnoreligious minorities and the Sunnis who don't accept a salafist government.   This is the beginning of nationalism in the Middle East.   Absolutely incorrect. Islamic State's entire ideological legitimacy is staked on destroying the Sykes-Picot national borders and re-establishing an Islamic caliphate that governs all Muslims, principally those in the Middle East but claiming to eventually do so the world over. Even the name ""Islamic State"" is somewhat of a misnomer as a ""state"" is a political arrangement foreign to the kind of Islamic governance Baghdadi claims to be following. That name is only for international recognition as such.   Also.. ""Crimes against humanity""..What country/State throughout history didn't commit those crimes while establishing a state?   If you accept that logic, it means we should never, as a species, move on from the genocidal warfare and oppression of early humanity and accept that this is an integral and permanent part of our species. As analytical as my perspective is, even I recoil at that proposition. How can we claim to desire world peace or, at least, the elimination of inter-state warfare if we accept Islamic State's formation?  There is a world of difference between accepting that Islamic State might become a permanent part of the Levantine landscape and legitimising that formation. Your theory is realistically impossible, intellectually regressive and emotionally repulsive."
syriancivilwar,3dx92e,Leadback,3,Mon Jul 20 08:11:29 2015 UTC,"They will always, until the end of time, be fighting for an Islamic state.   Hard to approve. Religions have died in the past and religions will continue to die. If the Middle East gets better prospects for it's children and future generations then they would have no need to run off and join and genocidal insurgency.   Insurgency after insurgency.. Why not let them have it and contain them?....Allow everyone around the globe to travel to the Islamic State if that's their desire, legally. Now we know where they're at, and if they try anything, we know what to target.   Having citizens run off  and join a state which actively wants to take over the world? Even from a Geopolitical standpoint there is no reason to have your enemies survive through containment.    They will know they cannot expand once confronted with the worlds military might.   Their borders are actively shrinking right now. Why give up when Iraq is close to destroying this scum? Should we allow the YPG/J to just sit at their own borders and await another attack from ISIS again and again while not be allowed to launch attacks of their own?   Through time, generation after generation, reforms will happen.   That's a pretty optimistic outlook. I'm sure reforms would have happened in Nazi Germany too.    Americans complain about Iraqi's not being ""nationalistic"", well, why should they be when their country was formed by conquerors after the Ottoman empire was split up?   And the only solution is to let the Islamic State survive? What does this even have to do with anything? How will letting the Islamic State survive? If there's one good way to unite a people it's through war against a common enemy. By the end of this war I'm sure the Iraqi people will be more united than ever.     The Islamic State brings Sunni's together under one banner, one leader. This is the beginning of nationalism in the Middle East.   Debatable since a lot of Muslim Europeans go back to, or try to go back to, Europe. On top of that, what's the point of an Islamic State for just one type of Muslim? Where are the Shia? The Alawite? No true Muslim? So much for an Islamic State, why not just a Sunni state?   Mujahideen fighting the American proxy to establish a state. THAT is something to be proud of. Patriotism is born.   The Iraqi people are fighting the Islamic State to help retain their state. THAT is something to be proud of. Patriotism is born.    Also.. ""Crimes against humanity""..What country/State throughout history didn't commit those crimes while establishing a state?   Because a country has committed crimes in the past then ISIS should be allowed to commit theirs? What's the point of stopping any genocides or massacres when every country has committed at least one? Terrible suggestion that will not help anyone on earth as we passively look away from genocides because ""I can't back my argument because my late ancestors committed genocide.""   America comes to mind..the genocide of Native Americans, Christopher Columbus raping Indians and chopping off their limbs if they didn't bring him gold....The terrorist insurgency against the British...""American Revolution""..   Horrible events that should be condemned in history and look to be amended. That does not mean that the United States should never be able to help others in their time of need.    It's part of the process of establishing a state. It's brutal.   This is not how Modern States should start if we can help it. A state whom's foundation is on Genocide and Massacres should not be allowed to survive and it should be stopped if all the countries can help bring its end."

syriancivilwar,3duhh7,TanDeng,5,Sun Jul 19 16:28:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely nothing, because the Kurd's have successfully taken their territories. Assad declaring them autonomy, would be him stating the obvious, it would literally be a de da dee moment for him. The Kurds wouldn't care. The Kurds don't need Assad or anyone to grant them autonomy anymore."

syriancivilwar,3duhh7,Skilldy,4,Sun Jul 19 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"A control freak like Bashar would never give them autonomy. He'd give them ""autonomy"" until the end of the war, then order the SAA and shabiha north."
syriancivilwar,3duhh7,Smaugswaywardscale,3,Sun Jul 19 16:33:12 2015 UTC,They already have that.
syriancivilwar,3duhh7,degestani,6,Sun Jul 19 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"They have de facto autonomy not de jure autonomy. Assad granting actual autonomy would definitely be big news. It would cause considerably more hostility from opposition forces towards the Kurds who they'd now see as coparticipants with the Syrian government. It could potentially see a return to open hostilities by opposition groups against the Kurds, which would help divide the opposition yet again and give the Syrian government another point at which to hurt the opposition.  Honestly, Hasakah is gone either way. Cutting a deal to retain Qamishlo airport and giving up their positions in Hasakah would allow the Syrian military to redouble their efforts in DeZ, without having to worry about maintaining a cut off and continually attacked outpost like Hasakah. If I was Assad, I'd make a magnanimous gesture about the sacrifices of the Kurds and their commitment against extremists like Da3sh and JaN, award them autonomy, and re-evaluate when hostilities cease. It would perhaps look like weakness initially, but it would signal to the west ""You're not the only ones helping the Kurds, that's one less propaganda point you can score with your home bases"" and it's not as if such a thing has to be permanent. The war ends, the Syria military regroups, they use the banner of ""Minorities in Rojava are being repressed"" and they regarrison the north, if for no other reason than to extract taxes and regain control of the (limited) oil resources in Rojava.  Worst case scenario, Rojava becomes a KRG and is an annoyance to the central government. But at the price of freeing considerable troops for defense of far more important areas (like DeZ), better a long term problem late than the existential threat your existence now."
syriancivilwar,3duhh7,LiesAboutKnowingYou,2,Sun Jul 19 16:55:24 2015 UTC,"giving up their positions in Hasakah would allow the Syrian military to redouble their efforts in DeZ,   Very doubtful.  Furthermore why should Assad make any voluntary concessions to the Kurds. He is an Arab nationalist and wasnt even willing do minor compromises, for example to fire his corrupt cousin in Daraa to calm down the upbrewing unrest among his OWN population.    their commitment against extremists like Da3sh and JaN   That is something you honor the YPG for. For Assad on the other hand everyone is an estremist who wants to topple him, no matter if this is ISIS or the 1costal division."

syriancivilwar,3duhh7,Dutchbag1402,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:40:00 2015 UTC,"It's not as dangerous a move as it would seem. To my knowledge, a very big part of of Rojava isn't actually Kurdish, and I've sometimes heard that the majority isn't. Basically, the potential for them breaking away at a later date isn't as big as it could be.  What'd it do? Well, it'd embolden the Kurds and indebt the Government to them. As I said earlier today, Kurdish autonomy is the elephant in the room when it comes to the SAA-YPG/J working relationship. If the Government pulls through, they are going give the Kurds their autonomy. There is no way known that Syria and Rojava will go to war. It'd only keep the wounds, for lack of a better word, open for longer meaning that rebels-to-be have breathing room to organise and rise up elsewhere. It'd be costly. And frankly, neither side has the stomach for it after all these years. So the Government and Rojava will negotiate somehow.   However, keeping it an elephant in the room means that no word has been given, and officially there is nothing to be expected. From that position, the Kurds won't be as mouthy as they would be if the Syrian Government says they'll give them autonomy. Then the Kurds aren't standing on nothing, they're standing on promises of autonomy. And they could start demanding exactly what they want and whip spirits up for that. I'm not saying they can't do that anyway, but this would open the gates for that.  It'd also, in a way, indebt the Kurds to the Syrian Government. The latter would scream ""We have only the best intentions towards you"". Whether or not that's genuine is up for the reader to decide, so don't come to me with that, but the Syrian Army, the NDF, and the related militias would have to act the part. And the YPG would this be given a chance they'd have to take immediately, because a combined SAA/YPG front will vanquish Daesh. Across Rojava the SyAAF could fly the odd CAS for the YPG, but it also allows both groups to go beyond Hasakah and move down the Khabur. SAA/NDF units in Qamishli and Hasakah will serve as the Arab face for the Kurdish force across Rojava. (so that bullhorning 'ethnic cleansing' will become a lot less viable)  Tiny problem: Euphrates Volcano. They're going to have to tear those guys limb from limb, or they dissolve with fighters either joining the YPG/NDF or going home. But considering that it's so closely integrated with the YPG, a confrontation with them wouldn't take long.  In conclusion: I need to lay off the Mary Jane, but this sounds like something I'd dig. What do you lot think?"

Second, I wasn't specifically referring to TOWs.  That's a strawman.  Third, let's remember how this line of discussion started.  You asked how it could possibly be a waste.  I told you.  Fact is they have a limited number available and they are dependent on outsiders to give them.

David Cameron has insisted that there is a fundamental difference between fighting for the Kurds and joining Isis.  Although the Home Office states that taking part in a conflict overseas could be an offence under both criminal and anti-terrorism laws, it clarifies: “UK law makes provisions to deal with different conflicts in different ways – fighting in a foreign war is not automatically an offence but will depend on the nature of the conflict and the individual’s own activities.”   The U.K has yet to prosecute anyone for joining the YPG. I do remember a story about some girls being arrested for joining the PKK instead but they're two separate groups so they're two different situations."

We get the job done, almost zero people from either India or Iran, and only a handful from China. A job well done . . .

The problem with the propaganda, its no where close to the level ISIS has theirs, its definitely not as bold and the medium is not new. Another thing is coalition has the challenge of explaining how peace can be achieved once the war is over. I might be wrong, but people over there have gotten used to death, and when death is all around, they might not care too much about freedom."

To the best of my knowledge atheist and secular Jews became the majority after the Holocaust. Even including the Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews which tend to be religious  the majority of the world's Jews have consistently been secular since 1945.  The USA's Jewish population, which is more religious than Israel's, is about 40% religious by stated affiliation (i.e. self-reporting which Synagogue they belong to) and perhaps 25% properly religious in terms of belief and practice.  The majority of the world's Jews are secular while a plurality (i.e. the largest single subgrouping) are fully atheist."
syriancivilwar,3drg4o,oreng,3,Sun Jul 19 00:57:52 2015 UTC,"Source for US being more religious? I'm a quarter Jewish, and I've known many actual Jews and very very few are religious. I think that many Americans with some/all Jewish ancestry hardly consider themselves Jewish because they are so far removed from the religion and culture. Only in parts of New York might that be different. By contrast, the Jewish part of my family (which lives in Europe) is much more religious."
syriancivilwar,3drg4o,DoctorExplosion,5,Sat Jul 18 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"Your experience is entirely shaped by where you live. Truly observant Jews need to live within walking distance of their synagogues which tends to concentrate them in clusters, usually within specific neighborhoods. If you lived in Queens you'd probably find it hard to believe that secular Jews exist, for example.  Read this for some indication regarding religiosity in America's Jewish population.  Then for a comparison look at the religious makeup of Israel's Knesset for an indication of religiosity amongst Israelis, it's significantly lower (religious Jews voting for general parties are balanced out by secular Jews who vote for Shas or Jewish Home, for the most part, so it's fairly indicative. The numbers also mesh with the breakdown by school enrollment.)"

Then when ISIS took over there were loads of people opposed. ISIS simply tortured/killed all powerful and critical people until they chose their side, which left the locals with little other options.  Also we should realize that these people are mostly illiterate individuals with little to none understanding of politics, strategy, or even religion, which obviously renders them less critical.  Nonetheless I agree with you that for many Sunni's in depleted rural areas have more to lose from Assad than from ISIS, and consequently will rightfully favor them. Now let the down voting begin."

You could say that teens, especially people in their twenties hate IS because it enforces a lot of strict rules, Syrians used to be a lot free and there are lot of smokers and alcholicls, and talking with girls, when IS came all of that was removed, so teens hate it.  However children and elder people, since those only want security and a good life, love IS very much.  There are teens who love IS of course but i dont know how much.  There was this great interview with a person who went to Denmark and used to live in Raqqah, greatly described the place."
syriancivilwar,3dxc0o,sgamsterdam,2,Mon Jul 20 11:44:47 2015 UTC,"Here is a detailed description of the fall of Raqqa, which supports my view. It's part of the Spiegel's report on Haji Bakr's documents (ISIS' master plan). Here's the link http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/islamic-state-files-show-structure-of-islamist-terror-group-a-1029274.html   The Capture of Raqqa  Raqqa, a once sleepy provincial city on the Euphrates River, was to become the prototype of the complete IS conquest. The operation began subtly, gradually became more brutal and, in the end, IS prevailed over larger opponents without much of a fight. ""We were never very political,"" explained one doctor who had fled Raqqa for Turkey. ""We also weren't religious and didn't pray much.""  When Raqqa fell to the rebels in March 2013, a city council was rapidly elected. Lawyers, doctors and journalists organized themselves. Women's groups were established. The Free Youth Assembly was founded, as was the movement ""For Our Rights"" and dozens of other initiatives. Anything seemed possible in Raqqa. But in the view of some who fled the city, it also marked the start of its downfall.  True to Haji Bakr's plan, the phase of infiltration was followed by the elimination of every person who might have been a potential leader or opponent. The first person hit was the head of the city council, who was kidnapped in mid-May 2013 by masked men. The next person to disappear was the brother of a prominent novelist. Two days later, the man who had led the group that painted a revolutionary flag on the city walls vanished.  ""We had an idea who kidnapped him,"" one of his friends explains, ""but no one dared any longer to do anything."" The system of fear began to take hold. Starting in July, first dozens and then hundreds of people disappeared. Sometimes their bodies were found, but they usually disappeared without a trace. In August, the IS military leadership dispatched several cars driven by suicide bombers to the headquarters of the FSA brigade, the ""Grandsons of the Prophet,"" killing dozens of fighters and leading the rest to flee. The other rebels merely looked on. IS leadership had spun a web of secret deals with the brigades so that each thought it was only the others who might be the targets of IS attacks.  On Oct. 17, 2013, Islamic State called all civic leaders, clerics and lawyers in the city to a meeting. At the time, some thought it might be a gesture of conciliation. Of the 300 people who attended the meeting, only two spoke out against the ongoing takeover, the kidnappings and the murders committed by IS.  One of the two was Muhannad Habayebna, a civil rights activist and journalist well known in the city. He was found five days later tied up and executed with a gunshot wound to his head. Friends received an anonymous email with a photo of his body. The message included only one sentence: ""Are you sad about your friend now?"" Within hours around 20 leading members of the opposition fled to Turkey. The revolution in Raqqa had come to an end.  A short time later, the 14 chiefs of the largest clans gave an oath of allegiance to Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. There's even a film of the ceremony. They were sheiks with the same clans that had sworn their steadfast loyalty to Syrian President Bashar Assad only two years earlier."

This is dangerous for the Turkish government as it increases a desire for independence and autonomy amongst Kurds in Turkey.

syriancivilwar,3dug9i,HardcoreBaathist,7,Sun Jul 19 16:16:58 2015 UTC,"Now ask yourself this: How come? If this was a popular sunni revolution ... where are their fighters? More importantly, where are their moderate fighters the US claims to support? Why are there so, so few compared to NDF fighters?   Firstly odd use of ""our"" for someone who's never set foot in Syria.  Secondly, where are their fighters? Look at a map. See the roughly 50% of that map that the SAA no longer controls? That's where those fighters are. Holding territory the government can't because it lacks the popularity. It's really that simple. I won't argue the moderate point because moderate means a million different things to different people, but it's not a secret where the forces arrayed against the Syrian government are. Nor is their growing list of successes a secret. The past year has seen almost exclusively government losses with continued seizure of land by opposition forces of all types. If theses 250,000 troops you believe exist still exist in numbers that large and the opposition is as small as you think, doesn't that speak to you about how atrocious of an organization the SAA and NDF are that they can't exercise control over half the country despite overwhelming firepower and manpower advantages? Surely, they could have just dumped more troops and tanks into Idlib and the Sunnis there who have been rebelling since the 1980s would have welcomed them with open arms and pushed out the tiny opposition forces lined up against them.  The opposition compromises a massive and complex assortment of fighters, equipped with enough SAA equipment to gain parity of arms on many battlefields and sufficient to not only hold ground but capture new ground from the SAA. You seem oddly obsessed with showing that the opposition is a failure but your principal argument is ""you haven't won the war yet so you failed"". By that line of thinking the Syrian government has been failing for four years to stop the violence in their country despite every advantage including one of the most well equipped (in raw firepower) militaries in the region. 5th largest tank army on earth is being defeated by this disorganized rabble of opposition fighters that you seem to think couldn't possible capture an ant hill much less entire governorates"

Those who suffered the most, largely the rural, and usually disenfranchised, elements of society are those most likely to rise up.    Yet, including ISIS and al Qaeda they only break even. That is a problem.   It sure doesn't seem to be a problem for all the land they've captured. I'm not sure what this ""problem"" your alluding to is. Despite a massive population majority and the bulk of the countries industry and infrastructure, the opposition has managed to seize half the country and continue to make gains even in areas closer to the government's power base. Military bases that fall aren't regained. Military equipment destroyed or captured isn't replaced. Land seized in broad sweeping offensives remains unreclaimed.   There is absolutely a problem. And the problem is that the SAA is reaching a breaking point, the NDF isn't powerful enough to offset it, and the opposition is gaining momentum and arms faster than the SAA can replenish its lost arms and men. The problem is that despite years of warfare the SAA is not adapting while the opposition is. Two years ago we all laughed at Hell Cannons as absurd weapons that couldn't impact a war. We smirked at the random opposition groups crewing a tank or two. Most of us remarked that capturing a few Kornets and Konkurs missile launchers couldn't stop the never ending tide of SAA tanks and armored vehicles.  And yet here we are in 2015. The Syrian armored force is less than half of what it was at the war's start, the Syrian air force is almost cut in two from losses to enemy fire, bases being overrun, mechanical failure, or plain old retirement from overworked air frames. The Syrian government is completely absent from Kurdish Syria save for one base that is constantly at risk of being overrun. The heartland of resources necessary for economic development and recovery has been captured, the north is nearly overrun with Aleppo the only remaining government stronghold, Idlib is overrun, Daraa is in the process of falling, and the sole extension of government power in eastern Syria is a single city which is locked in deadlock.  It's far from game over for the Syrian government. There is plenty of fight left in them. But it's certainly game over for a united Syria under a Ba'athist government. There is no coming back from the point they are at now. Reclamation of the heartland and a defense against future land losses is the best hope for the Syrian government at the present time.  For all your derision of the armed Syrian opposition, despite them being too small to effectively achieve anything by your metrics, they've fought the Syrian government to a standstill, gained the momentum and begun consolidating their gains instead of fighting for survival anymore."
syriancivilwar,3dug9i,LiesAboutKnowingYou,-3,Sun Jul 19 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"Almost all the successes were made by terrorists. There are two big sides in this war, terrorists and government. Sure, you can lump it all into one pot and sell the ISIS and al Qaeda success in Tadmour and Idlib as opposition victories, but they are not.  For any opposition worthy of the name these success should be as much of a headache as for the government.  The recruitment comes from rural villages that have always been terrorists. But there are plenty and plenty and plenty people on those villages. Most of them go to terrorists groups. They just have no incentive of going to FSA just from their background of being rural and poor and conservative.  So yeah, you can say terrorists are successful. I would even say terrorists are winning right now. But this cannot be in anyone interest, opposition or otherwise. The ""we will use terrorists to defeat the army and then takeover"" narrative has hopefully died in the ISIS disaster.  Bottom line is: Only SAA/NDF and terrorists are popular, so only SAA is a choice."
syriancivilwar,3dug9i,kamikazegas,2,Sun Jul 19 18:45:50 2015 UTC,"Do you understand what the word opposition means? ANYONE opposition the Syrian government is the opposition. Whether they're ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" if you take up arms against the Syrian government, you are the opposition. And with that in mind, the armed opposition has made tremendous gains against the government. You can draw your pretty little pictures where you try and prove only turrrrorists are fighting in Syria all you want. I'm not here to argue the opposition is some monolithic entity of goodie-goods who only want secular democracy and happiness and flowers for everyone. I'm well beyond thinking that either side fights for any sort of moral good. But pretending the Syrian government isn't getting a mudhole stomped in it's ass by a highly dangerous and well armed opposition is like sticking your head in the sand.  I'm not sure what point you're trying to prove with numbers. If numbers were all that mattered than the SAA would have never needed to create the NDF because they'd have shattered the opposition years ago."
syriancivilwar,3dug9i,turkeater,-2,Sun Jul 19 18:52:17 2015 UTC,In the all of this is about one question: Support the government or support the opposition?  All I am trying to show is that the Baathist government is much much more popular than any supportable opposition.

syriancivilwar,3dug9i,SaxonMeister,0,Sun Jul 19 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"despite claiming to have more men than the SAA, the opposition struggles to make considerable progress. Apart from Idlib which was a miracle how it even lasted that long being in the middle of pro-rebel areas, the rebels have yet to capture a major city. In fact if we are to look at the FSA alone, they have nothing. The southern front spent months preparing for Daraa and was stomped to dust in 4 days, they were too ashamed to even say the operation failed. What a disaster.   Damascus is safe as long as Jordan/Israel/Turkey do not directly intervene on behalf of rebels and terror elements"
syriancivilwar,3dug9i,100100145,3,Sun Jul 19 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"I see where you're getting at. Rather than answer your question, I just want to bring up two more variables that can possible skew the numbers of fighters willing to die for the government vs. against it inside Syria itself, since I assume this is what you are comparing. 1) Conscription inflates the number of pro-gov fighters, a lot of them may not want to fight for the government but are forced to. 2) The government controls the most populated areas in the country, if people in these areas want to join the NDF, who's to stop them? Now if someone deep in gov-controlled territory wants to join the opposition they will have many barriers, including getting the proper connections, securing an exit, worrying what the government might do to their families, etc."
syriancivilwar,3dug9i,Luakey,0,Sun Jul 19 16:42:03 2015 UTC,"1) As I said, volunteers in NDF have the same amount of fighters as the actual army, both conscript and professional.  2) That is because the army has already pushed them away from those centers (mostly Homs and Hamah)."
syriancivilwar,3dug9i,Luakey,2,Sun Jul 19 16:47:50 2015 UTC,Does the government conscript members of the NDF into the army?
syriancivilwar,3dug9i,Luakey,0,Sun Jul 19 18:52:14 2015 UTC,No.
syriancivilwar,3dug9i,kamikazegas,3,Sun Jul 19 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"So, if one lived in government controlled territory and wished to avoid fighting for the government, the most convenient way to do it is to join the NDF. I really don't see how you can consider the size of the NDF as a sign of the government's popularity."
syriancivilwar,3dug9i,degestani,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:27:42 2015 UTC,"No, that would cause uproar. The idea of the NDF is local-based fighters. Very effective, because they know the areas, that gives them a huge advantage.   However, the big downside to the NDF is that they are exactly what I said: Local based. In some areas, where fighting is scarce, you have very big NDF units (Tartous, Damascus, Homs, formerly Sweida) while in the critical areas of Syria, where the fighting is the most intense, where they desperately need manpower, there are small and highly unreliable or no NDF units. Idlib and Palmyra both had NDF units but they were very incompetent and undermanned.   This further disintegrates the SAA, who still bears the biggest brunt, while some NDF are sitting duck all day long."
syriancivilwar,3dug9i,Daario1,3,Sun Jul 19 19:12:16 2015 UTC,"Well, if one refuses to fight outside of his immediate locality, the question is how committed they are to the cause in the first place. As I mentioned in another reply, the NDF is the most convenient way to avoid fighting for the government. I assume the SAA won't reject any volunteers that show up at its recruitment centers. The fact that gathering volunteers necessitates an explicit promise they won't be sent fighting too far from home signals an enormous lack of trust in the government's conduct of the war, rather than anything else."

After hundreds of years of immigrants pouring into our country, inciting racial tension & sometimes down right war on our streets, we have refined much of the immigration system.  The US never sends immigrant to where they're mostly concentrated already. Arab immigrants are largely located in California & Michigan. And thus, they will spread them out into other areas, like MN, Nebraska, ID, etc.  If they're surrounded by their fellow countrymen, they will use their native tongue to communicate, largely stick to their own ethnicity because once again, they have not learned the language, & may never assimilate. For one, this will force the immigrants to learn the language & assimilate quickly.  With what I stated above as the preliminary deciding factor of where they can't go, second is which states & counties offer the best social services to help these immigrants learn the system, the language, the culture, & also other necessities until they're on their feet, like Welfare & healthcare.  By the time these families have the capital to seek to relocate to where their fellow ethnicity is located because of many benefiting factors for them, they have worked long enough & must have learned enough of the language to be capable of doing such a task.  Different topic, but by these families relocating to where they're located mainly, they know enough of the language & have assimilated enough to feel belonging to the country of the United States & our people.  From there, they create local businesses & thrive like the majority of the Arab immigrants."

You'll see USAF blow up anywhere Da3sh try and make a stand.  But it'll be Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa who make the press announcements, and it'll be their flags you see advancing down from Ayn Issa, which they took from Da3sh fair and square."
syriancivilwar,3dro89,Ian_W,2,Sun Jul 19 00:31:02 2015 UTC,"I think you're simplifying the many concerns surrounding the situation a bit. The YPG understands just how politically sensitive their advances have been and they understand the consequences of inflaming ethnic tensions. Arabs in the north are already concerned and see the YPG as the vanguard (which they are) of Euphrates Volcano. Raqqa's civilian population would not look kindly upon Kurds invading the city, the rebels right now aren't in a position to work as the spearhead, so the costs of an incursion into the city would be nigh untenable for the YPG, given their methodical approach to warfare and aversion to casualties."
syriancivilwar,3dro89,ShiteDog,7,Sun Jul 19 00:53:13 2015 UTC,"The Arabs in the north in PYD-influenced areas are fine with the new order.  Yes, you have whining from people whose paychecks come from Istanbul, but thats expected.  As the recent attacks on Kobane and Hasakah show, Rojava is not secure while Da3sh is a state.  Therefore, the Da3sh state must be destroyed.  Incidentally, the rebels are already in position to be the spearhead, being in Ain Issa about 40km north of Raqqa."
syriancivilwar,3dro89,Ian_W,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"The Arabs in the north in PYD-influenced areas are fine with the new order.   In areas where the PYD has had time to consolidate its presence, especially where the areas are Kurdish majority, yes. In newly conquered areas, particularly northern Raqqa, not so much.   Incidentally, the rebels are already in position to be the spearhead, being in Ain Issa about 40km north of Raqqa.   They aren't. They need to be the ones actually leading the charge into the city, they aren't ready for that. The YPG cannot do this for them."
syriancivilwar,3dro89,ShiteDog,4,Sun Jul 19 02:37:46 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that as people get used to the new order, the problem goes away, and the people that have advanced within 40km of the city arent the ones leading the charge.  Okay.  I'll also note that, even if it true that YPG destroying Da3sh and installing YPG-friendly FSA groups as a buffer zone makes some Arabs unhappy, this does not effect the grim fact that while Da3sh exists as a state, Rojava is not secure."
syriancivilwar,3dro89,Ian_W,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:49:05 2015 UTC,"No. I'm saying they have a solid support base in the areas where they initially took control from 2012 to 2014. The Kurdish majority towns, cities, and countryside in Aleppo and Hasakah provided the PYD with the opportunity to go forward with their experiment in democratic confederalism and Arabs living there for the most (emphasis on most) part had and have no issue. Now they're moving beyond this, into areas that are traditionally Arab, where there is significant animosity towards PYD rule.   The people leading the charge right now are the Kurds, rebels have always been the junior partner in this coalition. Rojava certainly isn't secure so long as the Islamic State remains, but the rebels can't keep getting carried forever."
syriancivilwar,3dro89,ShiteDog,3,Sun Jul 19 03:06:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, but the area they have already advanced into is between Hasakah and Kobane, and isnt Kurd-majority, and Im yet to see significant animosity.  The Shammar tribe in north-east Syria raising their colors with the YPG is big, btw. Between them and the various FSA groups in Euphrates Volcano, it shows it's not just Kurd thing.  But I think if the PYD has to choose between the known risk of Da3sh in Raqqa and 'significant animosity', then they'll cop the animosity."
syriancivilwar,3dro89,Ian_W,2,Sun Jul 19 03:28:00 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking they might go for the Tishrin dam, to cut off another supply route to Raqqa (supplies would have to go all the way around on the other side of the Euphrates river and through Maskanah and on towards Raqqa). Anything that forces ISIS to move supplies along a smaller number of supply routes (more vulnerable to airstrikes) is a good thing.   Or they might go for the ISIS held villages east of Hassakeh."
syriancivilwar,3dro89,inevitablelizard,2,Sat Jul 18 22:32:50 2015 UTC,"Take Khatuniyah, al-Hawl, Tishrin dam in that order. Afterwards, set up administrative structures in newly acquired territories + provide base for an FSA force to take Raqqa. Maybe incursions into Iraq to finally recapture Sinjar city from IS?"
syriancivilwar,3dro89,mindblues,2,Sun Jul 19 03:16:24 2015 UTC,"In terms of Kurdish inhabited areas, the YPG can still liberate regions south of Hasakah, and south and west of the Kobanê canton.

syriancivilwar,3dro89,flintsparc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:12:07 2015 UTC,"There is certainly room for expansion, but I doubt there'll be a linking of Kobane to Afrin.   There are majority Arab areas in between Afrin and Kobane.  These Arab areas are more densely populated than the areas taken in the Tall Abyad offensive, and includes major towns and a key supply line to Aleppo.  The relationship between the YPG and rebels is a bit more complicated because of Islamist groups between Afrin and Kobane - unlike in the Kobane area where the YPG and FSA work well together and there is no Nusra or Ahrar al Sham to mess things up."
syriancivilwar,3dro89,inevitablelizard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:20:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with ShiteDog, Kurdish expansion is reaching its limit. They're going to heckle Daesh and create a buffer for Kurdish territory and go to Tishrin Dam at the most, but not further.   When it comes to linking up with Afrin, that's indirectly inviting Turkey to crash the party. I haven't been following it as much as I should've (And I would appreciate articles to read up on it!), but to my knowledge the peace process there is under pressure. And the last thing Turkey would want is Kurdish forces on the other end of thousand kilometres of its southern borders. It would be unwise to stir up the hornet's nest here.  So after Hasakah and Sarrin I think we'll see the YPG expand its territory to make sure Daesh's incursions don't hurt Kurdish territories too much and make sure raids like those on Kobane don't happen again. And after that, I think they will not make large manoeuvres independently of other developments in Syria or Iraq."

syriancivilwar,3dqu9n,rSyrianCivilWarBot,9,Sat Jul 18 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"A majority? If that was even remotely true, I can't even imagine how different this conflict would be. Most of them don't want any part in the war, many are against ISIS, and some remainder actually support them. The same goes for Syria, where Sunni Arabs are an overwhelming majority at.  It reminds me of that misleading article that the whole of the 7 million Dulaimi tribe supports ISIS (when it was something like a single sheikh). All of Dulaimi backing ISIS would completely change the war."
syriancivilwar,3dqu9n,sunbolts,10,Sun Jul 19 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"1) Using a map is a poor argument, especially since this is incorrect anyways. It's nothing close to 90%. Most of the places where Sunni Arabs are majority are under Iraqi control. Many of the Sunni Arabs in ISIS territory left to other parts of Iraq as IDPs. If everyone wanted to leave their homes and ISIS didn't restrict anyone leaving, Mosul would be a ghost town. Then again, just in June 2014, 500,000 people left Mosul alone. It probably is significantly depopulated by this point.  Also, just because conquerors control some place doesn't mean they support them. It's like saying French supported Nazi Germany when they waltzed into Paris.   ISIS conquered majority Yazidi, Sunni Kurdish, Assyrian towns and were even pushing into majority Shi'a territory before being turned back by heavy US airstrikes and a determined counter-offensive.  Until recently, the whole of the Nineveh plains, which is largely inhabited by religious minorities, was controlled by ISIS. Are you saying non-Muslims support ISIS, the very people ISIS slaughters, just because ISIS controls them? Control =/= support. Anyways, this doesn't matter considering most Sunnis in Iraq are not in ISIS's control anyways.  Most of the majority Sunni land is not controlled by ISIS, so I don't know where you get this 90% is controlled by ISIS.  Also, almost everyone who escaped ISIS were Sunni Arabs.  2) That 90% claim is also very incorrect. The only places ISIS controls in Iraq is Hawija, Mosul, and several cities in Anbar.  Again, the same goes for Syria. Sunni Arabs are the overwhelming majority in Syria and yet ISIS's control is reserved to Raqqa, part of DeZ, and Palmyra (for now).  Again, is there anything to substantiate your claim that the majority of Sunni Arabs in Iraq and Syria support ISIS?   Al-Jazeera did a poll if people support ISIS it came back with 81%.   So you're saying AJ went into places like Fallujah and polled people on if they support ISIS?  EDIT: I remember what that was. It was an Internet poll that was literally trolled to death. It means nothing at all. It's like when 4chan trolled some poll to send Justin Bieber to North Korea. I remember when it was posted on this sub and it got torn a new one for being standard Internet shenanigans/BS."
syriancivilwar,3dqu9n,sunbolts,9,Sat Jul 18 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"I said 90% of Sunni Arab Majority areas in Iraq are ISIS   And I explained to you in my last comment why this are wrong. What's difficult to understand about that? If that was even remotely true, they'd be controlling the entire north and west of Iraq except Irbil and Suleimaniyah provinces, including most of Kirkuk province, and would also controls huge chunks of Baghdad. Of course, the reality is all ISIS controls is Hawija, Mosul, and several cities in Anbar, which is not 90% of Sunni Arab majority areas. It's not even half of Sunni Arabs they control (especially considering all the IDPs not in those zones anymore). Probably not even a quarter by this point.  And again, you are using the same poor logic that control equals support. Not sure why you continue to cling to this. I even tore up your ""81% of Sunni Arabs support ISIS"" claim as well lol. I mean, this sub already did that at the time anyways.   wonder why Saudi Arabia would support them    KSA doesn't support ISIS.. they may support JAN and other groups in Syria, but there has been nothing to show they support ISIS. Perhaps you can enlighten us?    you clearly don't know shit about Islamic history and the whole Idea of a caliphate. Majority of Sunni Arabs support ISIS it's clearly shown they want to target Shias.   Well, you have nothing to back this either. You're saying most of the Sunni Arabs in the Middle East and North Africa support ISIS and it is their collective goal to create a caliphate and want to target Shi'a, huh? Do you seriously believe this? If 100s of millions of people supported ISIS, the situation would be much different right now.   Anyways, I'm sure I'm far more knowledgeable of Islamic history than you are :) (though now you're trying to go on irrelevant tangents to somehow make an argument now). And given the kinds of incorrect things you've been stating, perhaps it is clear you don't know about this conflict or what's been going on."

I reckon most of the nut-jobs who are viable (they can make the journey) & feasible (they're excited about killing & raping enough to want to make the journey) recruits have been exhausted through current recruitment tactics - now we're seeing a pivot in Daesh towards recruiting from a more 'utopian' segment of the Islamist diaspora.  This is happening because the number of viable recruits is decreasing; as Turkey distances itself from daesh and makes smuggling trickier, as Kurds occupy more of the border with Turkey, and as the Jihadi export countries, especially in Europe, are imposing stricter limitations on the would be Jihaddies looking to enter Syria.  With the manpower churn rate necessitated by Daesh battlefield strategies and the number of people they're currently subjugating increases the only option is to widen the feasibility net (as the top-tier loons who see a beheading or a few foreign fighters chatting about which 9 year old girl they want to rape and think, 'I wouldn't mind some of that' are finite and starting to dry up).  Daesh appear to be doing this through a general anything goes attitude to who they stick on the front lines (those poor brainwashed suicide bombing Jihadi kids club 'Cubs of the Khalifate') and a gradual shift in the type of propaganda they put out (remember the Islamic Health Service video?) in order to attract less sadistic recruits.  Just my thoughts..."
syriancivilwar,3dqikr,Weekdaze,2,Sat Jul 18 17:24:32 2015 UTC,"I've noticed a similar shift in their propaganda. It also comes on the heels of the other Jihadist groups like al-Nusra going for that more 'utopian' narrative. But I view it more as complementing rather than replacing their butcher image.  That said, without hard data, saying that they've run out of loons is unverifiable. Part of the propaganda strategy daesh employs is create a bubble within which people can be revel vicariously in their brutality. They produce voyeristic snuff films for a reason.

Even if they were ""legitimately"" executed those scenes just didn't help anyone. It looked too brutal for people who are not used to war.

Turkey's hands are also tied. They have a habit when it comes to the border area of helping terrorists launch attacks on the SAA from Turkish soil while their army shells the SAA. For them it doesn't matter if the terrorist massacre countless civilians or desecrate church's. However Qamishili and Kessab are places with Christians and Kessab is an Armenian village that survived the genocide. When they got attacked Christians in west pressured their governments to stop this.   Unlike Alawites and Shias who many western people don't care for, Armenians and Syriacs have a lot of people in diaspora and a big voice.  When Kessab was attacked there was even a point where the Turkish PM went to visit old Armenians to boast about how Turkey had helped save them when their village got attacked. Armenians in the west didn't buy that especially since the attack came from Turkey and put pressure on our governments. Kim Kardashian got involved and the genocide was constantly mentioned."

syriancivilwar,3dq7i6,MesmerizingMe,17,Sat Jul 18 11:19:55 2015 UTC,Drawing from their experience ambushing IDF patrols it seems Hezbollah ambushes tend to lead to high casualties (see the Otaiba  ambush).
syriancivilwar,3dq7i6,VCGS,18,Sat Jul 18 12:00:39 2015 UTC,"Good, hopefully they put to bed the rebels in Zabadani once and for all so those civilians still there can get back to life and those who have fled can return."
syriancivilwar,3dq7i6,TanDeng,10,Sat Jul 18 12:59:19 2015 UTC,Now that the noose gets tighter and tighter death toll among the terrorists is bound to increase dramatically.  They should have taken the offer to surrender.
syriancivilwar,3dq7i6,ButlerianJihadist,3,Sat Jul 18 11:51:18 2015 UTC,What offer is this?! I've been without internet for a while and am really out the loop.
syriancivilwar,3dq7i6,alesismk2,8,Sat Jul 18 12:58:10 2015 UTC,"About a week ago the SAA airdropped leaflets to the rebels telling them to put down their weapons, surrender, and repatriate into Syria...Probably meaning join the NDF or something, not sure how many took the offer but I bet some are wishing they did now."

syriancivilwar,3dq7i6,redrojava,4,Sat Jul 18 13:38:37 2015 UTC,"Which fantasy world do you live in where terrorists are automatically just allowed to go back to civilian lives. Without questioning them of their activities, which group they are in, disarming them, gathering intelligence from them and getting promises from relatives and notables that they won't go back to their previous activities.  The SAA has done this a lot of times. Personally in my opinion the only way to stop terrorism is by being extremely brutal and eradicating them from the earth. Set an example so brutal that the next time they are in danger they will either surrender quickly or run away. Kind of like how ISIS got the Iraqi army and Pesh merga to collapse."

syriancivilwar,3dq7i6,kolal2,2,Sat Jul 18 13:35:13 2015 UTC,He probably means the Nursa terrorists; the primary opposition group in the Qalamoun.

syriancivilwar,3dq1v6,joeyadams,0,Sat Jul 18 16:36:50 2015 UTC,The majority of soldiers are carrying more than one weapon and very few are not carrying weapons.   Anyone know why they would be lugging around that much extra gear?
syriancivilwar,3dq1v6,LetsTalkCareer,5,Sat Jul 18 12:35:45 2015 UTC,I could only see 2 or 3 guys carrying more than 1 weapon - everyone else were carrying various kinds of ammo.
syriancivilwar,3dq1v6,Guck_Mal,8,Sat Jul 18 13:12:28 2015 UTC,"Edit: just watched it. I only saw four people carrying two weapons, the rest who were carrying something other than their rifle were carrying ammo. The four I saw were: the first guy carrying a rifle and an RPK. The RPK fills the role of the SAW in most Sov/Com bloc equipped militaries. It is a longer version of the AK, with a heavier barrel, a machine gun stuck, a heavier receiver, and bipods. It's meant to be paired with 40 rd magazines or 75 round drums, and is intended to be a stop-gap between the regular AKM and the PKM medium machine gun. It's significantly heavier (especially with a full 75 round drum) than a regular AKM and if you were carrying it you might want a ""regular"" assault rifle to use for regular works. The RPK might be getting carried until they go firm at which point it gets setup in a position of overwatch that multiple people man over a night.  The next guy observed is indeed carrying two rifles. He might be carrying it for someone behind him who is carrying a heavy load or is scared to cross the water, or for someone who hasn't arrived yet, who knows. The third is someone carrying an AKM and an RPG-7. For pretty obvious reasons, you don't want your only weapon to be an RPG, because you're gonna be out of ammo REALLY fast and you have almost zero protection if someone rushes you. The last guy was again just carrying two rifles.  Machine gunners carry a second weapon because machine guns are open bolt weapons that are far more prone to have serious jams that require time to clear than a closed bolt weapon (the difference is where the bolt rests. In an AK or M-16, the bolt is IN the chamber, with a bullet already resting on the bolt face, anytime it's not being fired. In most machine guns, the bolt is to the rear under tension waiting for a trigger pull to fly forward, strip a round from the belt, feed it into the chamber and fire, all in one motion. By the ""open bolt"" nature there is a lot of empty space where dirt, debris, or even foreign options can get in the way and cause jams).  Others may be carrying spares or weapons for troops who are coming along later. In the US military, officers, senior NCOs, and crew served weapon crews (TOW, heavy machine gun, artillery etc etc) carry a pistol so that they can set their primary firearm aside so it doesn't get in the way and not be unarmed. Lots of reason for multiple weapons."

syriancivilwar,3dq1v6,Coaste12ama,2,Sat Jul 18 18:44:52 2015 UTC,"They won't. They'll move on to their sidearm, grenades, or they'll clear the weapon."
syriancivilwar,3dq1v6,LiesAboutKnowingYou,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"Probably because they can. Left to themselves soldiers will tend to overload themselves. Usually with food, water and ammunition but if there have been issues with guns jamming then they might carry extra guns.

syriancivilwar,3dq951,ButlerianJihadist,5,Sat Jul 18 12:01:24 2015 UTC,"That average is meaningless, though. There were almost no tanks destroyed in 2011 and over 100 in a month of the Idlib offensive this year. The rate of attrition has increased dramatically over the course of the war."
syriancivilwar,3dq951,occupykony,6,Sat Jul 18 14:43:33 2015 UTC,Was there really over 100 destroyed in the Idlib offensive?
syriancivilwar,3dq951,Ernest_Frawde,10,Sat Jul 18 15:19:20 2015 UTC,"No. There were roughly 100 tanks lost but only 35-40 were destroyed. The rest were captured when they overran SAA positions. Between Feb 8 and June 26, I recorded 66 tanks destroyed by ATGMs. That doesn't account for a nearly 30 day block in the middle where I wasn't recording, all the ATGMs not recorded (JaN only records them some times and a number of groups don't record at all), nor tanks destroyed by other means (other tanks, RPGs, mines, IEDs, recoilless rifles, etc etc), nor those that were captured that I didn't account for. Between January of this year and the present, somewhere in the range of 200-300 tanks have been either destroyed or captured with full 100 of those coming from the Idlib offensive from 22 April to 15 June."

Just look at the failed Southern front offensive which had been prepared for months, during the whole offensive they managed to destroy like 5-6 tanks (tho some might even be salvageable)."
syriancivilwar,3dq951,ButlerianJihadist,13,Sat Jul 18 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"It's not, though. LAKY did the math on it and the total was around 150 for 45-60 days of the offensive. On mobile so I can't link it but there's hard evidence for those numbers, whereas you've just cited some irrelevant battles in the south for your claim."
syriancivilwar,3dq951,occupykony,-10,Sat Jul 18 15:30:58 2015 UTC,Yeah forgive me for not taking his word or his math for granted. But please do link to that hard evidence when you get a chance.
syriancivilwar,3dq951,ButlerianJihadist,13,Sat Jul 18 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"Then by all means, please offer us statistics otherwise. I'm not making numbers up, all my data is recorded in posts on the subreddit. /u/occupykony is misremembering how I presented that data, because it wasn't 150 destroyed in the Idlib offensive, but it was roughly 100 lost. Between 35-40 were outright destroyed and another 60+ were captured. Roughly 50 BMPs (and variants) were captured and 25+ destroyed, with several more armored vehicles by way of Shilka's and Gvozdika's destroyed or captured. The Idlib salient was an absolute slaughter fest for Syrian armor. My ATGM data is freely available and I'll have a writeup about it completed in the next few weeks. In the meantime, I'd be happy to share the collected videos of captured weapons in the Idlib campaign with you. Mind you, a number of links are broken, but many will still work.  Edit: I tried to include the description I'd written for each link but it won't let me copy both at once and I'm too lazy. These are organized in chronological order, starting from the top on the first day of the offensive and ending at the bottom in Busanqul at the end of the salient. I hope this counts as sufficient proof to you.

Out of those 6 are counted based on a written announcement about Qarmeed camp while providing a photo of only one tank (the video I found also shows only one tank). There are other videos you list as evidence which show rebels driving a couple of tanks down the road with no clear context if those tanks were captured of were they already in rebel hands.   It seems to me that when in doubt you seem to choose to err on the side of the rebels, which would not make a good methodology."
syriancivilwar,3dq951,ButlerianJihadist,7,Sat Jul 18 16:19:29 2015 UTC,"I absolutely err on the side of the rebels, because they've been very good about providing proof for their claims. When it sounds outlandish, I disregard it, but if it adds up and makes sense (Qarmeed was a military warehouse with a tremendous amount gear stored there), but I didn't just take the written announcement. There were several stills released by JN's  Idlib account on Twitter (it was something like JN_Edleb5) that is since deletd. When I documented it and added it to my list, I put a tag on the URL in my bookmark that said ""JN Idlib, <stuff captured>"" or something like that, so that if it was deleted I could reference what was there. Because ultimately, this information is for me. I share it on reddit because you guys tend to appreciate it as well and we all learn from it. But I'm recording this data for me, and the people who want my data trust that I'm not lying to them.  My methodology on reddit is far from academic, because it doesn't have to be. It's reddit. When I'm writing reports, that's a very different case. You're absolutely right, if the opposition says ""We captured this tank,"" and I can understand the Arabic well enough, and then see them walk up to the tank, I call it a capture. Because there is no reason not to believe that. If there was compelling evidence for me to believe it was not theirs (i.e. had extensive stenciling of rebel logos on it, or I recognized the serial number from somewhere else) I'll not include it.  But this is reddit. I'm putting information out there for anyone interested in taking it. I rely on my reputation and the fact that I dump as much information as I can possibly find onto the subreddit. Some people are gonna trust me on it. Some are not."

And ""prepared for months""? It came RIGHT on the heels of capturing Brigade 52. It was an ad hoc and rapidly planned move and it certainly didn't net massive gains, but they own more territory NOW than they did BEFORE the offensive. If your offensive GAINS territory while killing your enemy, in what universe is that a failure? It's still an ongoing offensive."

Someone better wake up Napoleon and Hitler they would surely enjoy the news that they actually won because they too advanced.

I don't know, how long do we have to wait before labeling the SAA's advances everywhere in the country a failure? In eight months, their greatest achievement is Zabadani. Eight fucking months. Meanwhile, they lost control of:   Wadi al-Deif/Hamidiye (Idlib) Brigade 82 (Daraa) Busra alSham (Daraa) Jisr al-Shughour (Idlib) Qarmeed (Idlib) Musaybin (Idlib)  Mastoumeh (Idlib)  Ariha (Idlib)  a dozen plus little villages in Idlib and Hama Qiyasat (Idlib) Muhambal (Idlib) Busanqul (Idlib) Brigade 52 (Daraa) Tadmur/Palmyra (Homs) various gas production points (Homs) parts of Daraa city and most recently parts of Aleppo city including the Military Research Center.   Gains are incremental and slow going in major cities. This isn't a surprise, but calling advances that haven't stopped yet ""a failure"" because the have yet to strike the coup de grace is absurd. I don't know what it is about Daraa that triggers you so hard, but advances have been made and the SF is in a stronger position NOW than they were when the operation began. In no metric in the world is that considered a loss or a failure, whereas losing irreplaceable assets (which tanks have become for the Syrian government) along with losing ground, is losing. You keep ointing to these HUGE casualties, but other than the 80-100 released from the first couple days, there haven't been huge casualties (or we don't know about them, because neither side is releasing casualty data right now).    Oh and we're talking about tanks not bulldozers.   No, you're talking about tanks. I'm talking about the total picture. Bulldozers are a vital part of this war's conduct and their destruction is important to note. Along with the BMPs and Shilka that I also mentioned."

syriancivilwar,3dq951,LiesAboutKnowingYou,9,Sat Jul 18 14:14:34 2015 UTC,No. That number exists. But it's not the number of WORKING tanks. Many have been sold or transferred to other countries. Many are broken or beyond repair. Plenty are mothballed and would require significant investment to get them up and running again. The war began with closer to 2500. They had 1500 as of last Nov. They're somewhere around 1250 or lower today.
syriancivilwar,3dq951,LiesAboutKnowingYou,2,Sat Jul 18 14:46:00 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Has there been any additional tank shipments from Iran or Russia?
syriancivilwar,3dq951,oblivionrecurs,9,Sat Jul 18 15:07:47 2015 UTC,Iran doesn't have the tanks to spare (they've delivered a very small number to Iraq but Iran's tank force is very small even for their own needs). There have been no shipments from Russia and we don't have any reason to believe there will be.

syriancivilwar,3dq951,an_actual_lawyer,2,Sat Jul 18 17:07:36 2015 UTC,That was from a company in the Czech Republic and it went to Iraq. It was some 30 T-72s and a similar number of BMP-1s and it was delivered to the port of Umm Qasr a few weeks / month ago.

Usually, you can find estimated total tanks and a specific breakdown of the estimates of operational, non operational etc. on my phone now (and at work) so can't look it up properly."
syriancivilwar,3dq951,LiesAboutKnowingYou,0,Sat Jul 18 14:59:22 2015 UTC,I don't think it matters how many tanks got destroyed .Russia can send more then Rebels can destroy. Only problem seem to be is money but now soon Iran will have more to spend. Hardware will be replaced faster.
syriancivilwar,3dq951,ShootAK12,6,Sat Jul 18 17:21:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think it matters how many tanks got destroyed .Russia can send more then Rebels can destroy.   Then you don't understand this conflict. Russia isn't sending and hasn't been sending tanks. They're sending very minimal physical support to Syria, almost exclusively in the way of support for their aircraft (not new aircraft), ammunition, and upgrades for aircraft.   Hardware is NOT being replaced in Syria. Each lost tank is gone forever, unless it's captured by the opposition, in which case it's even worse than if it was destroyed. Armor was the strength upon which the Syrian military was built around. They had so many at the outstart of the war no one thought they could possibly run out of them. But they're beginning to feel the crunch and the war is running them out of tanks, without a reliable ally to replace them."
syriancivilwar,3dq951,LiesAboutKnowingYou,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:05:45 2015 UTC,"Russia isn't sending tanks that I know but it's not out of good heart ,it's because Syria doesn't have those 100s million to spend .soon that can change with Iran being free to do business with Asian and Western countries. If Russia get paid what will stop them from sending hardware in Syria?"
syriancivilwar,3dq951,TanDeng,5,Sat Jul 18 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"No, Russia isn't sending tanks because they're not selling them to Syria. It has nothing to do with cash. Russia is more or less committed to fiscal support and maintenance support, they're not sending heavy weapons, and they've been pretty clear about that since the beginning. It has never been about the money."

syriancivilwar,3dq951,Duke0fWellington,7,Sat Jul 18 12:44:40 2015 UTC,"That's extremely unlikely.  They have much more pressing operational needs than armor and the odds of them paying for and successfully receiving new tanks, even from NK, is exceedingly low.

syriancivilwar,3dq951,LiesAboutKnowingYou,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"The fuel issue seems to have been taken care as Russia is planning on sending 200,000 tonne a year from Crimea which will help the Government and civilians A LOT."
syriancivilwar,3dq951,MrBingBongs,8,Sat Jul 18 13:20:01 2015 UTC,"Let's use a T-62 as our baseline as it's in between the T-55 and the T-72. Average the range of the tank both with and without extra fuel tanks it averages 550 km on the road and 385 km cross country. That's with a fuel capacity of 1160 liters (an average of with/without the extra fuel tanks). To fully fuel that tank, you need to use 2250 lbs of fuel (each liter of diesel is roughly 1.94 lbs).   There are roughly 1250 MBT in active service and some 4,000 + armored and unarmored military vehicles of all types in Syria. If we assume and average that those remaining military vehicles only use 1/3 of the fuel that a tank does, that accounts for 3,000,000 lbs of fuel (1,500 tons), with another 2,812,500 lbs of fuel (1406 tons) going to Main Battle Tanks, that means that to fully fuel their military force, the Syrian government must expend 2,906 tonnes of fuel.  That's to fuel them ONCE. Multiply that by say 50 refuels a year a year (even just turning the engine on to provide power to the turret but not moving burns a TREMENDOUS amount of gas) and you are looking at roughly 150,000 tons of fuel spent on military vehicles alone. And this hasn't even begun to touch the fuel needs of their aircraft, the fuel needed to generate power at military bases, the fuel used by logistics trucks to ferry troops to and from, etc etc.  There is ZERO doubt that Russian oil is going to help a lot, certainly a lot more than if they didn't get it at all. But it's not a wonder cure and it hasn't ""been taken care of"". Things are dire. Very dire."
syriancivilwar,3dq951,LiesAboutKnowingYou,3,Sat Jul 18 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for doing the math and putting together that whole write up.

syriancivilwar,3dq951,TanDeng,6,Sat Jul 18 15:28:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't doubt that Russian fuel shipments will alleviate SOME of hte problems, but they need to recapture those gas and oil fields if for NO OTHER REASON than to keep their civilian populace from revolting. Heating, transportation, and cooking oil shortages are often the factors that lead to total revolt."

syriancivilwar,3dq951,orion4321,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"I was aiming for more of a total fuel consumption figure. There will be weeks where they'll need to refuel more than that. Anytime they travel from one spot to another they'll require more fuel than when they're just moving around a city. Offensives will require far more fuel. The winter will require them to turn the vehicle on and off multiple times a day to keep the engine warm enough to run if needed (especially in mountainous areas where it gets really cold). They'll have to run the engine frequently if they'r using it as a stationary position to prevent the vehicle's electronics from draining the battery banks (even just using power to turn the turret or operate the optics). And then of course the expenditure of fuel needed to do things like recovery missions, RTB for maintenance, etc etc. That number is obviously not a hard figure, but it gives a decent idea of the figures necessary for running a large armored force."

We could manually rotate teh turret in our LAVs but it legitimately took several minutes to do a full 360. Anything more time sensitive, or if you're called to look a certain direction, power on and turn.  As I said, the numbers were a rough idea and sure the pre-heater alleviates some problems (presuming it works as intended) but overall, the fuel expenditure of a military force is TREMENDOUS and 200,000 tons sounds like a lot more than it really is."

Iran has tons of oil, now even stored off-shore, that it still can't sell on the open market due to sanctions, I would think it would be way easier and more logical for Iran to be supplying them with oil."
syriancivilwar,3dq951,Vladamiur,8,Sat Jul 18 17:06:12 2015 UTC,"North Korea has a ton of tanks, something like 4,000 MBT that are still in existence. But NK is also locked in this existential (if only in their minds) battle for survival with South Korea and a large part of their military doctrine involves overwhelming force of arms and the ability to rain death on South Korea. For a North Korean resupply of Syrian armor to be effective it would need to be in the hundreds, if not greater (at which point we're talking a billion dollars just for hardware), which would severely deplete the military abilities of North Korea. They are not so cash strapped that they'll weaken their military abilities (perceived or otherwise). A few tanks? Especially a few of their more modern one (like the Pokpung-ho)? Perhaps. But that presumes that such items make it through sanctions to get smuggled all the way there and that North Korea is willing to suffer if the backlash if they're caught. Which for a couple of tanks, they may not be willing.  But a few tanks won't make a difference. Nor will raw equipment overall. Syria needs manpower, especially trained manpower. Mercenaries CAN make a big difference, the question is where they would come from. Aside from Russia supplying a thousand tank T-72 army or a fleet of Su-24s and Su-25s with accompanying drone and reconnaissance aircraft, it is not equipment that the SAA is hurting for (though they will begin to reach that cracking point soon, especially with the level of tanks and aircraft that they have hemorrhaged this past year)."
syriancivilwar,3dq951,LiesAboutKnowingYou,2,Sat Jul 18 15:04:41 2015 UTC,"I would think the one thing North Korea could theoretically supply that would probably not cost Assad to much would be soldiers specifically soldiers from North Korean Artillery units.  The North has an insane number, one imagines they could spare a few.  There would be far less risk of them being killed and appearing in videos being away from the front line and it would free Syrians up to go to forward units.  500 or something scattered around SAA units wouldn't cause to much trouble politically I would think."

Losing or winning a war is not linked to Baathism, in fact for winning wars religious takfiri terrori indoctrination would probably be the best way to go.

As such education and by extension not being dependent on oil for western imports for literally everything is a core principle of Baathism.

No no, wahhabism is strengthened because the baathist secular regimes that ruled Arab countries for a long time only brought dictatorship   The Saudi wahabi theocracy predates any Baathism by a long time.

First used in April 2013 by Arabic and Iranian media hostile to the jihadist movement, Daesh became a name commonly used by the enemies of IS, notably forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as well as activists and less fanatical rebel groups also fighting the Damascus regime.  A principal reason for using the acronym was to remove the words “Islamic” and “State” in reference to the group in a bid to stop Muslims in war-torn Syria and beyond flocking to its ranks.  Defiance and disrespect  It is also considered insulting, and the IS itself doesn’t like the name Daesh one bit.  Beyond the acronym, “Daesh” sounds lie the Arabic “Daes”, meaning “one who crushes something underfoot” as well as “Dahes”, which means “one who sows discord”.   http://www.thefederalistpapers.org/world/france-starts-calling-the-islamic-state-terror-group-a-name-they-hate-so-much-theyll-cut-out-the-tongue-of-anyone-saying-it  The second issue I have with this is, you're trying to portray them as a faction that's should have a place in the middle east, now I'm not saying they won't last (that's another subject), but to care about not offending them or being unbiased is just silly and really naive..

It's clear that he was translating with the intent to aid recruitment and incite violence."

But what if he was just translating for the sake of translating to help people know better about IS, would he get in trouble for that too? Or people like /purpleolive who edit IS combat footage and post them on the internet, does that count as an offence?"

Would probably depend on the laws of the country. However there are literally dozens of amateur analysts who have done the same sorts of thing and have not only faced no criminal charges but have become respected for their knowledge of the situation on the ground.  The most prominent of these armchair analysts is of course Elliot Higgins who started out analyzing and dissecting combat and weapons footage and broke major stories about chemical weapons uses and weapons shipments to various rebel groups.  Now he's a highly respected journalist who's sought after for his training on gaining information from social media."

But i despise them, their actions and what they stand for. I wonder if I was in a western country, would I be arrested? Would they really believe that I'm not a supporter of ISIS?

I absolutely despise their ideology though and will never support their cause. Naturally because I'm a muslim I am interested in watching their rise/fall. I've learnt a lot about the middle east and the Jihad aspects of Islam (which are never discussed in mosques for obvious reasons).   The intelligence agencies have their hands full already. Nothing will happen to those like us because we haven't done, don't plan on ever doing or shown any potential tendencies of doing any harm.

syriancivilwar,3dq54h,CIA_Shill,2,Sat Jul 18 13:10:33 2015 UTC,Extremist materials are liable to call for violence against others or include material to enact violence against others. Ergo by making this material available for an English speaking audience he's breaking the law.
syriancivilwar,3dq54h,MesmerizingMe,3,Sat Jul 18 13:24:15 2015 UTC,Freedom of speech doesn't work like that. It's not that you can say whatever the fuck you want without repercussions. Hate speech is still a thing.
syriancivilwar,3dq54h,tacticoolant123,2,Sat Jul 18 11:10:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on the country.  Europe may have hate speech laws, but not the US.  Hate speech here is just something college kids complain about while the rest of us roll our eyes.  You wouldn't be violating any laws here unless you were actively plotting an attack.  Translating propaganda might get you a material support of terrorism charge, but any competant attorney could get it thrown out.  The courts ruled decades ago that the Anarchists Cookbook was free speech and that's a book on how to build bombs.  It's on Amazon.  The rest is just religious beliefs, which no court here would ever touch with a ten foot pole."

syriancivilwar,3dp028,Ian_W,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:02:04 2015 UTC,Why didn't the YPG let ISIS take the SAA area of Hasakah and then clear ISIS from the area without any SAA troop remaining? Unless the news that the SAA is leaving the city is true.
syriancivilwar,3dp028,defend435,14,Sat Jul 18 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"At a guess:   SAA were doing a good job of holding ISIS in place to be encircled, if they waited for the SAA to be defeated, YPG would have had to commit their forces to the task of pinning ISIS instead. Splitting their forces and leading to many more YPG casualties. Much of the SAA forces are locals (NDF) if YPG callously allowed them to be massacred for the selfish gain of the YPD, Arabs both locally, and throughout YPD controlled Syria would look at the motives and actions of the YPD with more suspicion. It is likely that in a negotiated peace, the SAA (without Assad) will be one of the parties taking part. If the YPD burn their bridges with the SAA over a relatively small amount of land, that might end up being counter-productive in their negotiations for autonomy in the peace deal. Maybe there are actual friendships between some local SAA and YPG members, or at least good enough acquaintances that they don't think they deserve to be killed or worse, captured, by ISIS."

syriancivilwar,3dp028,steiner_math,14,Sat Jul 18 13:51:06 2015 UTC,"Because if the SAA routed, Da3sh may have done what they do very very well and kept overruning everything in sight.  People also need to remember that PYD is playing a long game, and that what happens in Hasake affects what happens in Aleppo.

(ISIS 'doesn't count' for a variety of reasons, chiefly: (1) They have no long term future. (2) They're still getting a stream of new recruits so it's not clear how much this kind of defeat hurts them.)"
syriancivilwar,3dp028,steiner_math,4,Sat Jul 18 13:48:23 2015 UTC,Their recruiting numbers are down quite a bit from their peak and training new members takes time. Losing 1200 members is going to hurt a lot.
syriancivilwar,3dp028,Deadleggg,2,Sat Jul 18 13:52:21 2015 UTC,Especially when the best estimates out there are 50-75000 of combatents.  That's a decent chunk of their overall force.

Also lets flip the question maybe ""Sunnis are losing the battle for the hearts of the West"".    On the ground, Sunni Arab residents of Tal Abyad minced no words about the Kurdish fighters who seized the city. Seyh Deham Haseki, 60, described IS as a ""much lesser evil compared to the Kurdish militants"".   This is the problem with to many Sunni's in ISIS-land. Willing to support ISIS or remain neutral in the face of ISIS crimes, and then when ISIS get beaten back play the victim and say they are the ones being oppressed (by the Kurds, by the Popular Mobilisation, by the SAA). Every single group that liberates a town or village from ISIS control is accused or looting and ethnic cleansing by these ISIS sympathisers."

If they don't get support from the West it's exactly because of attitudes like these. And before ISIS we had Nusra in the region that regularly attacke Kurdish regions which at the time didn't expand and only defended themselves.  There is a shitton of political will in USA, UK and France to get rid of Assad and the fact rebels didn't get more support for it is telling.  So, rebels, you want to overthrow Assad but replace the state with a sharia muslim-only one and oppress minorities just like Assad does with you?

Most of the people of Raqqa are against ISIS, maybe 90 percent. The other 10, ISIS gives them money, power, and because of that they want it in the city. After the airstrikes, a few more people said, ""I will be with ISIS against these strikes."" But most in the city just want them out.

It's not exactly a ""supportive"" or ""neutral"" attitude from the locals. Closer to the truth would be a negative attitude, which changes into fear after everyone critical, and particularly the powerful, are tortured/killed until they submiss to ISIS.  See this report on how ISIS took over Raqqa.   The Capture of Raqqa  Raqqa, a once sleepy provincial city on the Euphrates River, was to become the prototype of the complete IS conquest. The operation began subtly, gradually became more brutal and, in the end, IS prevailed over larger opponents without much of a fight. ""We were never very political,"" explained one doctor who had fled Raqqa for Turkey. ""We also weren't religious and didn't pray much.""  When Raqqa fell to the rebels in March 2013, a city council was rapidly elected. Lawyers, doctors and journalists organized themselves. Women's groups were established. The Free Youth Assembly was founded, as was the movement ""For Our Rights"" and dozens of other initiatives. Anything seemed possible in Raqqa. But in the view of some who fled the city, it also marked the start of its downfall.  True to Haji Bakr's plan, the phase of infiltration was followed by the elimination of every person who might have been a potential leader or opponent. The first person hit was the head of the city council, who was kidnapped in mid-May 2013 by masked men. The next person to disappear was the brother of a prominent novelist. Two days later, the man who had led the group that painted a revolutionary flag on the city walls vanished.  ""We had an idea who kidnapped him,"" one of his friends explains, ""but no one dared any longer to do anything."" The system of fear began to take hold. Starting in July, first dozens and then hundreds of people disappeared. Sometimes their bodies were found, but they usually disappeared without a trace. In August, the IS military leadership dispatched several cars driven by suicide bombers to the headquarters of the FSA brigade, the ""Grandsons of the Prophet,"" killing dozens of fighters and leading the rest to flee. The other rebels merely looked on. IS leadership had spun a web of secret deals with the brigades so that each thought it was only the others who might be the targets of IS attacks.  On Oct. 17, 2013, Islamic State called all civic leaders, clerics and lawyers in the city to a meeting. At the time, some thought it might be a gesture of conciliation. Of the 300 people who attended the meeting, only two spoke out against the ongoing takeover, the kidnappings and the murders committed by IS.  One of the two was Muhannad Habayebna, a civil rights activist and journalist well known in the city. He was found five days later tied up and executed with a gunshot wound to his head. Friends received an anonymous email with a photo of his body. The message included only one sentence: ""Are you sad about your friend now?"" Within hours around 20 leading members of the opposition fled to Turkey. The revolution in Raqqa had come to an end.  A short time later, the 14 chiefs of the largest clans gave an oath of allegiance to Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. There's even a film of the ceremony. They were sheiks with the same clans that had sworn their steadfast loyalty to Syrian President Bashar Assad only two years earlier.   http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/islamic-state-files-show-structure-of-islamist-terror-group-a-1029274.html  Here's another local, a sheikh from the local al-Brij tribe, who testifies that ISIS is unwelcome.   Raqqa city, which is completely under ISIS’s control, witnesses these days disturbance and tension inside the state, as news is circulated about cooperation between one of the biggest tribes in the region and many military groups and battalions, to attack ISIS’s centers and kick them out of the city. “people in Raqqa have fed up of ISIS and its acts in the city and against its people, every day we wake up on news of slaughtering one of our people, cutting their hand, or lashing others in public squares in the city or the countryside without providing any evidence for their decisions, which are usually taken for personal benefits”, A sheikh from al-Brij tribe reported to Zaman Alwasl.   https://en.zamanalwsl.net/news/4635.html  Wow! There's even more! Look at this anti-ISIS demonstration by the locals of Raqqa. Can you believe your eyes, Arab Sunni's getting from their couch leaving their house to unite and express their antipathy towards ISIS? And yes, it's true, ISIS responds by firing an RPG at them and gunning them down. Hey, you're right man, Arab Sunni's and ISIS are born for each other.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaL_ExmrSNY   Here's some local Arab Sunni's who founded a free media organization. Huh, they were not friends with ISIS? How come, locals love ISIS! So strange ISIS decided to torture Rami al Razzouk, a member of the ANA New Media Association network, most likely to death! That does not corroborate with your amazing evidence that locals love ISIS. Strange ...  https://www.facebook.com/ActivistsNewsAssociation/posts/560012304071230  Hmm I can't believe my eyes. Are the locals again demonstrating against ISIS? They must be confused, because they are such good friends. Well, ISIS shot them down and overran them with cars...  http://en.alalam.ir/news/1504314  The list goes on. Even the Australians take note of Arab Sunni's demonstrating ISIS, on a daily basis even!!!  http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/syrians-hold-protests-against-jihadists/story-fn3dxix6-1226695874126  Now it's true that you are being up voted and I'm being down voted. Yes, you feed on the popular idea that Arab Sunni's are crazy backward Salafi's. Nonetheless, at least I support my claims with quotations and sources. Now let the down voting continue.  Edit: ISIS members themselves even acknowledged they were not welcome in Raqqa.  https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/27bi9g/isis_fighter_abudujanamuhajr_isis_is_unpopular_in/?ref=share&ref_source=link"
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,sgamsterdam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"I don't generalise anyone as being backwards Salafi's. There is discontent in Raqqa as their is discontent amoung any population during war.   However if 90% of Raqqa's population were against ISIS, they would not be able to hold any ground in Raqqa. Every insurgency needs the support of the people to survive.  Raqqa province has a population just under 1 million. If 90% were opposed to ISIS they could have kicked them out. They kicked out the Syrian government well enough, why not ISIS?   Kurds in Kobane were able to do it with just a few thousand men.   Only 2 sides in this fight. Either you fight ISIS or you don't. The people of Raqqa have made their choice. None of this ""but ISIS killed all their leaders"" stuff. A million people can find new leaders.  Where are the car bombs attacking ISIS patrols in Raqqa? Where is the assassinations of ISIS fighters, or daily gun battles between Raqqa residents and ISIS? That lack of attacks on ISIS tell you where they stand.   Then there is the residents of Raqqa's disdain for any Army that would free them. Kurds free them and get accused of ethnic cleansing and called ""worse then ISIS"". SAA are met with the same reaction.   Seems they are not willing to accept anyone elses help but also not willing to free themselves. The people of Raqqa are not weak, they have guns, they have numbers. They proved that during the fight against the SAA. They could win easy against ISIS if they want... but they don't.   They chose to kick the government out. They chose to side with all sorts of Islamists. They chose not to fight ISIS when they took over."

You nothing but your own thoughts.  PS you seem very uninformed. You totally fail to notice that Raqqa greatly supported Assad. All tribal leaders actually expressed their support to Assad at the beginning of the conflict. If you don't even know such basic things and don't even care to take a moment to take my sources serious, than you are listening to nobody but yourself. I hope your voice is pleasant to hear."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,sgamsterdam,-2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:15 2015 UTC,What else can they do but play the victim? Aren't they the victim of both ISIS and Assad?

syriancivilwar,3dppm9,CallMeFierce,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:33:55 2015 UTC,Why? I imagine Daesh to you is the worst thing possible but it is entirely possible that Daesh didn't bother many Arab Sunni's isn't it?
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,sgamsterdam,8,Sat Jul 18 14:40:03 2015 UTC,"Yes that's my point, and we all know already how they act. The fact that these Sunni Arabs would prefer rule like that shows how hopeless it is to work with them."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,CallMeFierce,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:51:52 2015 UTC,So what is your point?
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,sgamsterdam,3,Sat Jul 18 15:41:33 2015 UTC,I just explained my point. What use is it to help people who enjoy rule by ISIS?
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,CallMeFierce,0,Sat Jul 18 15:43:58 2015 UTC,They didn't ask for Daesh. They suffered under Assad and now less under Daesh. It's human to care for other humans.
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,sgamsterdam,3,Sat Jul 18 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"Complained under Assad, understandable. No complaints under ISIS... less understandable. Complaints under YPG (who haven't even really done anything but kick out ISIS so far)... not understandable at all. Most likely they're just xenophobic and dislike Kurds, even though there's been much less harsh rule by them so far. I'm not sure what you're comment is trying to say, because in this war (unless you want some sort of Islamic based state) PYD rule is most preferable."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,CallMeFierce,15,Sat Jul 18 19:59:58 2015 UTC,"Most Kurds are Sunnis too. They aren't fanatic sectarians though and follow a different political idea than supremacist Islamism. Kurds are largely also not obsessed with their own victimhood while being an atrocity perpetrating majority, which helps. The biggest problem of Arab Sunnis is their own attitude, which is why they so readily turned on their neighbours when the Islamic state allowed it to them and which is why they were from the beginning unable to forge an alliance with the Kurds and other Syrian minorities against Assad."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,lemontolha,-3,Sat Jul 18 09:54:09 2015 UTC,"You blame the Arab Sunni's attitude. Attitude is such a hard thing to grasp though, how do you know the attitude of say 5 million people?  Arab Sunni's unable to forge an alliance with the Kurds? The Arab Sunni's biggest problem is with Assad who is targeting them indiscriminately on a daily basis with conventional weapons, earlier with chemical weapons, and now with barrel bombs. It's more like the Kurds don't want to join the Sunni's in their fight against Assad than the other way around isn't it?"
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,sgamsterdam,11,Sat Jul 18 09:58:43 2015 UTC,"I do remember how things looked back in 2011 when there were Kurds and Arabs demonstrating together. Kurds were btw. already fighting Assad or his father while quite some Sunni Arabs were happily accepting Kurdish agricultural lands handed to them by Assad and collaborating with his regime. When the civil war broke out there were many Kurds fighting on the side of Arabs of whom many more than today were back than still smart enough not to insist on being ""Sunni"", that turn to sectarianism came when the Muslim brotherhood and djihadist fighters with the help of Turkey and the Gulf states started to dominate the opposition. That was when the FSA together with Nusra and others attacked Kurdish villages to ""liberate"" them, even though those were already self-ruled. Fortunately the Kurdish leadership is wise enough not to bring this kind of stories up and instead allying with reasonable anti-Assad Arab forces (all of them ""Sunni"" btw., but not necessarily ""Sunni enough"" to be supremacist Islamist)."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,lemontolha,2,Sat Jul 18 10:09:45 2015 UTC,"It is laudable that the Kurdish leadership is not feeding on the Kurdish-Sunni conflict. But then, it's easy to relax and not complain when you're on the winning side.  Thanks for the background info."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,sgamsterdam,4,Sat Jul 18 12:59:55 2015 UTC,"Actually the problem in the beginning was that no rebel group recognized Kurdish wishes for autonomy, which is why neither the KNC nor PYD is a member of the SNC.(which used to be more relevant)"

The Kurds fought an on and off war against the regime back in 2004, when the sunni arab Islamists were quite content to watch and hope for more Kurdish land. Furthermore, the YPG fought a series of violent offensives in 2012 and 2013 when ISIS, Ahrar and Nusra were still on the same side."

syriancivilwar,3dppm9,sgamsterdam,4,Sat Jul 18 12:53:17 2015 UTC,Kurds are mostly sunni?
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,SP-Sandbag,2,Sat Jul 18 09:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yes. But i think it is fair to claim, that most kurmanci speakers, even religious ones, have a weak sunni identity but a strong kurdish identity. To them it makes no difference if their opressors are sunnis, twelvers or alawites, because kurds are treated the same by all. For zaza speakers I think it is a bit different, but I am no expert."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,Pismakron,3,Sat Jul 18 10:28:22 2015 UTC,"Let's be even more fair and accept that ""Sunnism"" doesn't even qualify as identity. We are talking political ideologies here, there are Islamists, of the Khomeini (""Shia"") or the Qutb (""Sunni"") variation or others and than there are secular political ideologies such as Nationalism, Socialism, Liberalism and so on. To pretend that suddenly the adherents of those ideologies represent whole ethnicites is absurd, especially because you have Arabs, Kurds and others - also adherents of different variations of Islam - are on all sides of those political divides."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,lemontolha,2,Sat Jul 18 11:09:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that. Even non-religious people with a muslim background can identity strongly with sunnis og shias. But you rarely se sunni-kurds identify strongly with either side in a conflict between sunni and shia arabs, in Yemen, Syria or Iraq for example."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,Pismakron,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:51:22 2015 UTC,"Even non-religious people with a muslim background can identity strongly with sunnis og shias.   That even underscores my point that this is about political ideology and not about theology. Of course you are against becoming a disenfranchised minority in the theocracy of a sect you aren't member of, even though you don't even practise ""your"" sects creed. The problem I see is that instead of being against the ideology of sectarianism and theocracy as such, people (Western spectators like you included) see this as a ""this group vs. that group"" issue, which it is not. It could perfectly easy be resolved by individual religious freedom and religious equality."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,lemontolha,3,Sat Jul 18 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"Nothing, is my guess. What do you think should or could be done?  And why do you think that helping kurds is alienating sunnis ( which technically should include most kurds)"
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,Pismakron,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:29:22 2015 UTC,"Well a big thing would've been if Obama followed up on his promise to bomb the Syrian Arab Air Force after they scaled up their chemical attacks and crossed Obama's ""red line."" Then Assad wouldn't have been able to continue his indiscriminate bombing of Arab Sunni's and scored credit among them.  I didn't come up with the idea that the help to the Kurds alienates the Sunnis, that info is in the article. Among others a spokesman of the FSA says so.   ""The US coalition strategy has favoured the Kurds and, in the process, has alienated important Arab constituencies,"" Hokayem said."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,sgamsterdam,4,Sat Jul 18 12:57:25 2015 UTC,Part of me thinks we can never win their hearts. Some of them are just opposed to our way of life.
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,foodyboi,2,Sat Jul 18 09:46:51 2015 UTC,"Islamism is monolithic - it is not compatible with many other ideologies, (maybe Arab supremacism?).  The mistake we often make on this sub is being reductive and using Sunni and Islamist interchangeably."
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,Weekdaze,-3,Sat Jul 18 13:01:07 2015 UTC,Syrian Sunni's you mean? 90% of muslims are Sunni and many if not most of them have a Western way of life.

syriancivilwar,3dppm9,Ynwe,-1,Sat Jul 18 10:06:02 2015 UTC,Interesting thought. Please explain/elaborate.
syriancivilwar,3dppm9,sgamsterdam,10,Sat Jul 18 10:16:16 2015 UTC,"different standards is so many ways. What we share at the very core, is what most humans on the world share, and I would say that is rather humanity, than a ""style/Way of living"" or culture.  I was born in Istanbul, my family lived a while in Kuwait too and I have been to international schools my whole life. For me, it is very clear, that the cultures that are the most ""UnEuropean like"" (or lets say different) are African cultures and Middle Eastern. Its a full tray of things, tolerance being a big one.  For example, I went to a VERY wealthy school and we had a very rich Omani kid in my grade. Really cool guy and I really liked him. However, he became REALLY weird when around a good female friend of mine, just because she was Jewish. He wanted to discuss things, but then said things like ""He doesn't believe in the State Of Israel""  She has no ties to Israel and is actually originally from the Caucausus region and now full Austrian. This isn'T just a single case, gross interloerance, especially antisemitism (along with the MOST WACKY crazy theories! Talk to Arabic Taxi drivers in Vienna, you would think you would be somewhere in the Egyptian Desert, because no way someone in such a modern place could be so misinformed) is a big issue in the Arabic world. Personally I am quite critical of Israel and its dealings of the Palestinians, and it fucking annoys me when it becomes harder to discuss this subject, because instead of being rationally critical, people just go full crazy. (recent example: Holland, where after a death of a Muslim kid, a protest crowd just ""randomly"" went into the Jewish district protesting, even though they had NOTHING to deal with it"" (oh and just for the sake of it, I wouldn't classify Israel as a full Western Country either, only partially)  Another thing is Woman. This point won't even be discussed, the different ways how women can or have to live between our cultures is just insane. A friend of my mom is living in S.A because her Husband has work there. She and her 3 daughters HAVE to wear the full black burka as soon as they are out of the compound. That is insane that you would force women to wear something like that. Even the head scarf, don'T give me the BS that they wear it freely, no other women in a different culture in the world, From the Americas to far Asia just decided ""yup, would be cool to cover up my hair."" Then you have cases, as recently as in my country Germany, where a school had to send a warning letter to parents to not let their daughters dress to revealing (meaning hotpants, how that is too sexual is beyond me) because close by SYRIAN refugees had been sheltered and girls were being harassed (there was a reported case, where a boy was stalking girls in the public baths, because she was wearing a freaking bikini) while the refugees are experiencing a huge cultural shock, it really pisses me off, that instead of teaching the Syrians that this is the accepted standard and they need to live by it, the school has to warn parents because in short they are scared that something much worse may happen.  to quote Sayyid Qutb: If free sexual relationships and illegitimate children become the basis of a society; and if the relationship between man and woman is based on lust, passion and impulse, and the division of work is not based on family responsibility and natural gifts; and if the woman is freed from her basic responsibility of bringing up children; and if, on her own or under social demand, she prefers to spend her ability working for material productivity rather than in the training of human beings, because material production is considered more important, more valuable and more honorable than the development of human character, then such a civilization…cannot be considered civilized, no matter how much progress it makes in history or science.”  ""From the Muslim point of view, any culture that threatens the truly devout Muslim’s religious commitment is considered the “enemy”. Therefore, Western culture is the obvious enemy of Islam and America is the leader of all the Western countries.""  no no no, The middle East isn't even close to being Western, it is the most stark contarst of a Western way of life. Besides maybe Africa, the Middle East is the region that is the furthest away from being able to called Western.   You have certain areas that are certainly Western in cultures. Just like I mentioned Israel, that has parts that are Western, so does the Muslim world, prominent example being Istanbul, which given its direct proximity on the European continent isn't surprising.  Also from my experience, Muslims and especially Sunni Arabs are the cultures that are the most likely to NOT integrate into a Western society. Just as a example from Germany: The ethnic group that has the HIGHEST % of completing school with 18 (and not doing something else like an apprenticeship or failing) are the Vietnamese, which are the most prominent immigrant group in East Germany. On the lowest on that list by far are Turks and Arabs.   Our cultures are extremely different and sadly in many cases in Europe, we are seeing more and more the segregation instead of integration of our two cultures. Personally I believe, besides just opting for less and more focused on qualified immigration, we should also prefer South Eastern Asian immigrant groups that are more likely to integrate well into our society than Muslim ones. Just look at the obvious Indian vs Pakistani integration process in UK.  Also Muhammad Cartoons: Yeah, if can't tolerate that, and if that leads to members of your community wanting to kill others, than I don't know what more I can show you to show the vast difference between West and Middle East  Sorry for the long text. You may feel free to criticize me, since I am no where near perfect or fully free of prejudice."

syriancivilwar,3dppm9,Ynwe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:07:22 2015 UTC,"Again thanks for the elaborate and sincere reply. You argue along many examples that Islamic culture and Western culture are rather opposite, particularly when it comes to the stance towards Israel/Judaism and the role of women.  I cannot argue against your examples, and also here at r/syriancivilwar I get a strong notion that people believe in a conflict between Islam and the West. I agree with this, yet I think it’s a temporary thing that will last perhaps a couple decades but not much longer. If we look at history we see many conflicts coming and going. We’ve seen massive wars between the Greek and the Persians, the Romans and the Persians, the Muslims and the Sassanids, the Christians and the Muslims, the Protestants and the Catholics, the Dutch and the Portuguese, the Fascists and the Liberalists, Communism and Capitalism. Throughout history you see recurring conflicts, and indeed one of them is conflict between the big religions. But after these conflicts you always see a return to a period of rest and tolerance, and more often than not have people of different religion lived in tolerance together.  Now my point with the list of global wars is that big conflicts can arise for pretty much any reason. The common denominator, in my view, is power.  People longing for power abuse differences between people to create conflict which they can use to try to expand their power.  Ultimately, I believe, it’s a matter of belief that can’t be spoken out. Do you believe Muslims are essential enemies of Christians and Jews or not? I believe people are fundamentally peaceful and good, but I can’t prove it.  Also may I remind you that two of the examples you gave for successful immigration (i.e. Pakistan and India) are actually the 2nd and 3rd largest Muslim countries in the world! Together they account for 22% of the Muslims world wide. The Middle East and North Africa account for only 20%."

syriancivilwar,3dppm9,komnene,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"No I do not see Muslims as enemies as I do not believe this, at its core, is a issue or conflict over power. I believe that certain characteristics that the West and the Muslim world has puts it at odds. The West is currently the most advanced region in the world, technological, socially and health wise. So its logical that we see a current migration towards the west from other regions. However, especially the immigrants from the Middle East/Muslims overall, are looked at pretty negatively since many Europeans, and me partially included, believe that these cultures not only share the same values (Work ethics, women rights etc) but also try to spread their culture from within ours instead of integrating after coming to our culture. Especially the last point brings up many hostilities within Europe since we don't understand, why someone can expect to come here, work here, live here, enjoy this country with all its benefits, yet still live as he was in Baghdad, Cairo, Riad etc.  In Germany, we have lots of immigrant groups. Many have very high success stories (examples, Poles and Vietnamese) while others have much more issues, mainly Muslim/Arabic ones. If you look throughout Europe, you can see the immigrant groups that are the most prominent ones with issues are those from the Middle East or Northern Africa. So you get this universal feeling that people from that region do not want to integrate and thus are harmful to our society.  So no, I do not believe in a power conflict. If somehow we could manage to get Muslims better integrated, we would solve a lot of these issues. (side note: The second generation of immigrants overall has been very well integrated! now the third generation is the one where issues are rising, plus the newer immigrants are more troublesome)  Also, I do not see the current migration wave towards Europe as one that can be sustainable, many share this sentiments. At the same time we do not vote for right wing parties but we are seeing their rise across Europe. It puts a lot of us in a hard spot, since we want reasonable parties to get this sorted, but they are ignoring it, wile the more authoritarian right wing party that must of us hate or passionately dislike, are the ones addressing it. Its also an issue within our own culture how we handle these things"

Among other issues, dangers of chemical warfare include the fact that a shift in the wind, the contamination of water, or merely missing a target can kill countless noncombatants, thus every use of chemical weapons should be rejected, documented, and cause alarm."

If you criticize Shi'a in a mature manner, then I would hope  the mods wouldn't delete such a post.  In regards to why Sunnis are criticized more often, it is because (at least to my perception) more extremist interpretations of Islam come from the Sunni branch. The most obvious example of this are the Salafis/Wahhabists, (whose ideology originated in the Hanbali fiqh), inspiring much of the foreign jihadists in Syria. But no doubt you already know this. And it doesnt help when these sects call Shi'a or other minorities heretics.  Of course, that isn't to say Shi'a are always victims or have no flaws. PMUs in Iraq have been accused of atrocities against Sunnis, and Shi'a inaurgents in the Iraq War were just as guilty as their Sunni counterparts. I have spoken a few times on this sub of my dislike for Hezbollah, a group which is only recently being taken off of terrorist lists. I commented because I do not think Sharia should be used to undermine the status of minorities  in society, and that Christians, Shi'a, etc. should be treated fairly. I will admit that I have a limited understanding of Sharia and that the person I replied to mentioned the sunnah, yet a version of Islamic law that would intentionally create a lower class for minorities is just wrong. I abhor Sharia in general yet I realize that many Muslims in the middle east actually do support it.  Anyway, those were a few of my opinions. What do you think of Shi'a Islam? Surely you won't get banned over a rational discussion over it."

syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,HardcoreBaathist,-2,Sat Jul 18 19:53:24 2015 UTC,Why doesn't it surprise me in the slightest that the opposition leader might cheer on al-Qaeda victories?
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,uberkami,-3,Sun Jul 19 02:35:47 2015 UTC,"Well maybe because ""the kurds"" are not fighting for syria. They fight for Kurdistan. And how can you count them to the opposition if they are in fact aligned with assad?"
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,the_red_wheelbarrow,3,Sun Jul 19 10:09:05 2015 UTC,"How are they aligned with the SAA? At best they are occasional co-belligerants, but there is very little support for President Assad in Rojava, and the YPG doctrine has always been to tolerate the SAA in Hasakeh and Qamishli only until there is no need for them to act as a first line of defence against IS. We're already seeing YPG fighters taking over formerly SAA positions in Hasakeh."
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,defend435,2,Sat Jul 18 12:49:04 2015 UTC,But officially they hadn't join the rebels. Since the beginning they had fought other rebels groups and occasionally the saa for their own political goals. None of which is to overthrow Assad officially from power. That why turkey been mad at the ypd.
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,the_red_wheelbarrow,0,Sat Jul 18 10:24:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, but they definitely aren't aligned with the SAA. They don't care who runs Syria as long as Rojava retains autonomy, and wouldn't lift a finger to save Assad unless it furthered their cause. All of which is fair enough from their perspective."
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,uberkami,2,Sat Jul 18 10:34:43 2015 UTC,"Ypg are cooperating in hasake with saa/ndf. And throughout the conflict they were not really fighting assad. As I said ""the kurds"" only fight for rojava and don't care about the rest of syria."
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,the_red_wheelbarrow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:51:24 2015 UTC,"Right now the YPG realises that having the SAA controlling south Hasakeh is useful, as it saves YPG troops from having to garrison the city and it keeps the Arab residents happy. If there was an opposition militia/administration which was trustworthy, popularly supported and well-armed, the YPG wouldn't hesitate to kick the SAA out and invite the opposition in. But at present no such opposition exists."
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,defend435,2,Sat Jul 18 13:09:36 2015 UTC,But we both know that leaving any SAA forces in the Cizire canton will eventually mean trouble for the YPD. If the SAA is allowed to build up it troops in the canton then the eventual showdown will hurt the YPG because the SAA have more heavy weapon and an air forces.
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,uberkami,3,Sat Jul 18 14:34:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe you didn't understand my point. The tweet / thread title criticises that ""the kurds"" are left out of the Eid speech that praised the opposition gains. My point is that Ypg is not really part of the opposition. They could have fought assad from the beginning and helped oust assad but they choose not to care about the syrian problems. So it just makes sense that they are ignored in said speech. Every Ypg gain is a rojava / Kurdistan gain, not a syrian one."
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,MesmerizingMe,3,Sat Jul 18 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"It's a bit naive to say that the rebels (or the SAA for that matter) are fighting for Syria, while you say that the Kurdish are fighting Rojava/themeselves. That's all just nationalistic rhetoric used to gain what all aspects in this conflict are fighting for; power."
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,LiesAboutKnowingYou,4,Sat Jul 18 17:10:22 2015 UTC,"Is it really though? The opposition want to control all of Syria. The PYD only wants to have autonomous control of Rojava. One group is fighting for Syria (good or bad) and the other group is fighting for control of their neighborhoods and enclaves. It's a VERY different end-game. If the SAA wins and the Kurds get autonomy, the Kurds win. If the opposition wins and the Kurds get autonomy, the Kurds win. The Kurds don't have a real stake in the future of Syria at large, they only care about what happens in their enclaves. It's an important distinction to make, as it separates them entirely from ""the opposition"" against the Syrian government."
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,defend435,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:55:46 2015 UTC,"Both faction has different goal, one is to overthrow Assad the other is to establish Kurdish autonomy. They sometime overlap but both have different goal to power as you said."
syriancivilwar,3dq1gn,AtomicDryad,2,Sat Jul 18 11:16:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say:   'Opposition' seeks to establish an arab state and/or an islamic state. There is no guarantee that the rights of minorities or women will be respected, indeed many of the factions seek otherwise. The Rojava factions seek to establish a multi-ethnic autonomy free of the concepts of ethnic, religious, or gender supremacy. This is primarily a Kurdish movement, but these goals serve the interests of Kurds and the interests of non-kurds, as opposed to those that struggle for their interests at the expense of others, like a crab in a bucket."

syriancivilwar,3do8dw,Paragon23100,14,Sat Jul 18 00:42:00 2015 UTC,"Seriously? What percentage of Shias or Shia militias do this? I guarantee you it is less or equivalent to the non-group sanctioned persecution of Shias by Sunnis (meaning the persecution not organized by any one group, as attacks by Shia Militias that you're claiming exist are certainly not sanctioned and led by any agency). If Shia militias are truly so horrible, then why are Sunni tribal elders in Anbar openly calling and requesting for the Shia Militias to come support and liberate them? How much did it hurt you on the inside when they did that and it went against this false narrative you're trying to create?  Here's a short comment I wrote refuting anti-Shia militia propaganda in Tikrit.   Jazeera itself testified that the majority of looting and burning was conducted by Sunnis returning with the PMUs or who were members of PMUs seeking revenge. What makes this clear is the fact that the Shia soldiers, having never lived there, had no idea who's houses were whose. It was the Sunni soldiers who targeted and attacked these different houses. The NY times also attested to the fact that the majority of apprehensions people had about the PMUs largely did not materialize. Al-Arabiya in a desperate attempt listed the Shia fighters stealing Shampoo and toothpaste from Tikrit. That's ridiculous.  The reason you're getting downvoted is because you're trying to accomplish an impossible task; finding a way to equate Shia Militias with the absolutely barbaric ISIS in attempt to justify mass Sunni support for the group. Your replies gradually get more and more shrill and non-sensical each time, often founded upon flawed premises. The problem is not everyone has the time or patience or knowledge to rectify these things again and again.  When talking about Iran, I don't have any real protestations, though I severely doubt whatever you say. I'm an American before I'm anything else--and oppose those who act against us. I also don't really trust them at all.   The vast, VAST majority of Shia crimes are made up, exaggerated, and are all put into a propaganda machine that attempts to magnify and multiply incidents of Shia crimes to the point of equivalence with Shia persecution--which is really difficult seeing as how widespread Shia persecution is.  Kindly, have some respect for the Shia men dying in the thousands to liberate Sunni only areas, areas that would refuse to even give Shia pilgrims water before."
syriancivilwar,3do8dw,ofarrizzle,-5,Sat Jul 18 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"You're trying to underplay the systematic atrocities of Shia militias just as much as others overplay them. In total, they've committed fewer violations than IS, but they've done everything from massacres to endemic extrajudicial killings to ethnic cleansing to systematic kidnapping and torture. Most frightening is the fact that the biggest, most influential and powerful militias in the Hashd are those most seriously implicated in these atrocities, like Badr, KH and AAS. Badr is principally responsible for the cleansing of Sunnis from most of Baghdad, and has held the Interior Ministry for much of post-2003 Iraq, for instance. Turning to IS is beyond the pale, but can anyone fault Iraq's Sunnis for hating a government whose most important ministers are the leaders of sectarian death squads?  Saying that Hashd is ""literally IS"" is stupid, but so is pretending that all of them are valiant humanitarians fighting for all Iraqis.  Their records prove otherwise, and failing to address the fact that Hashd is principally led by the leader of a sectarian terrorist group like Amiri, let alone that the man is a minister, is absurd. Worse, many Hashd supporters imply or state that pointing these facts out is akin to sympathizing with IS, which is absolutely asinine.    All that said, the reports of atrocities against Sunni civilians, as far as I can tell, is nothing like what it was during the clearing operations in Diyala, let alone what it was during the American occupation.  So there does appear to be improvement, though with what's happened, it will be a long time before Sunnis can trust a government that relies so heavily on the militias, militarily and politically."
syriancivilwar,3do8dw,Paragon23100,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:53:39 2015 UTC,"You're trying to underplay the systematic atrocities of Shia militias just as much as others overplay them.   I haven't seen substantial evidence for them, aside from a few isolated incidents covered by HRW. If you show me the opposite, then I will change my stance.  For example, people try and paint this false picture of Tikrit, and that type of propaganda is all that I've seen. I've refuted it here:    more militia beheading Daesh, executions, and the rampant looting that we saw in Tikrit   Outright, this calls into question your entire argument. Al Jazeera itself testified that the majority of looting and burning was conducted by Sunnis returning with the PMUs or who were members of PMUs seeking revenge. What makes this clear is the fact that the Shia soldiers, having never lived there, had no idea who's houses were whose. It was the Sunni soldiers who targeted and attacked these different houses. The NY times also attested to the fact that the majority of apprehensions people had about the PMUs largely did not materialize. Al-Arabiya in a desperate attempt listed the Shia fighters stealing Shampoo and toothpaste from Tikrit. That's ridiculous.   I'm not super familiar with Shia Militia work prior to this war, though the context in which battle happened then was in response to an absolutely genocidal Sunni insurgency, which resulted in extremely high sectarian tensions, in which tactics like car bombings were used by the insurgency (as high as 17 car bombings in one day in Baghdad on one Shia area), killing Shias by the score. This does not for a second justify any harm done to innocent Sunni civilians, but changes the narrative people would like to push. It's not like these militias came out of no where, and that sectarian attacks came out of no where, but were in the context of what was essentially a war between these two groups. And Shias faced the brunt of the brutality, and still do until this day. Even now these groups retain mass support in Sunni communities, as they did then.   Their records prove otherwise, and failing to address the fact that Hashd is principally led by the leader of a sectarian terrorist group like Amiri, let alone that the man is a minister,   I'm not super familiar with him, but have read Sunni leaders now recognize him as one of the principal fighters against ISIS and praise him, now. However, I can't really comment as I'm mostly ignorant.   So there does appear to be improvement, though with what's happened, it will be a long time before Sunnis can trust a government that relies so heavily on the militias, militarily and politically.   I agree on the Militia point, but let's not pretend Iraq is a nordic stable state that can provide perfection to these citizens. Even so, I feel that the narrative that Sunnis are absolutely marginalized by the government and that somehow justifies the support for ISIS is false, when you look at these FACTS.   The whole blame Maliki for everything narrative is convenient but ultimately untrue. Sunnis had disproportionately high political representation, equal economic development to the Shia (the areas with the highest Economic development being in the Sunni Kurdish areas) with far fewer resources, and made unfair and non-tenable demands (like demands for the defense porfolio) they knew would never fly. They also blocked everything in parliament so nothing could get passed. It has also now been proven that Sunni leaders supported ISIS prior to their rise. Not to mention the absolutely brutal genocidal insurgency that massacred Shia in an unprecedented scale, that Sunnis were aware of but still supported, right up until Baghdadi in Mosul. Even now there is massive support for ISIS in these communities."
syriancivilwar,3do8dw,ofarrizzle,3,Sat Jul 18 02:21:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen substantial evidence for them, aside from a few isolated incidents covered by HRW. If you show me the opposite, then I will change my stance.   They're fairly widespread, especially in mixed areas like Diyala.  The general trend appeared to be cleansing Sunnis from mixed areas, which makes COIN easier for the militias.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/31/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-idUSKBN0K909K20141231  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/24/iraq-frontline-shia-fighters-war-isis  https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/02/15/iraq-militias-escalate-abuses-possibly-war-crimes  Calling HRW's reports ""isolated incidents"" rings a little hollow when those isolated incidents are massive violations.  After the siege of Amirli was broken, for instance, 30 out of 35 Sunni villages surrounding the town suffered home demolitions after the siege was lifted.  Being the biggest single operation before Tikrit, its a damning statistic.  https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/03/18/after-liberation-came-destruction/iraqi-militias-and-aftermath-amerli  This article details the sectarian stratification in Baghdad during the height of the war, much of which Badr was responsible for:   http://musingsoniraq.blogspot.com/2009/11/blog-post.html   was in response to an absolutely genocidal Sunni insurgency   I really wouldn't disagree with that.  But that's IS's whole strategy.  The bombings of the shrines in 2006 was explicitly and deliberately intended to kick off a sectarian war, and was wildly successful as Shia militias returned the favor, driving Sunnis towards IS as a protector.  It's some sick cynicism, but its the bedrock upon which IS is built.   I'm not super familiar with him, but have read Sunni leaders now recognize him as one of the principal fighters against ISIS and praise him, now.   Calling him the leader of a sectarian terrorist group and a principal leader in the fight against IS are both accurate statements.  Badr is a sectarian terrorist group, and also one of the most important groups in Hashd, which Ameri heads.   Even so, I feel that the narrative that Sunnis are absolutely marginalized by the government and that somehow justifies the support for ISIS is false, when you look at these FACTS.   Like everything in this conflict, pushing each perspective into mutually exclusive extremes is inaccurate.  Sunni Arabs were broadly marginalized from the decision-making process and security forces.  They were also statistically over-represented in Parliament, though having 30% of seats instead of the proportional 20% doesn't exactly guarantee them a voice; they're simply a larger minority shut out from the process.   It has also now been proven that Sunni leaders supported ISIS prior to their rise.   That's massively oversimplified.  Some figures in the regional government in Nineva had connections to IS, but most of those connections were criminal in nature rather than because those officials believed in the caliphate nonsense.  IS operated like a mafia organization, offering a ""plata o plomo"" choice to officials.  Even if that was the case, Maliki responded by targeting rivals that had nothing to do with IS, like sentencing his Sunni VP to death a day after the Americans left.  These are not the actions of a government interested in a pluralistic political landscape.   Even now there is massive support for ISIS in these communities.   Which is a massive problem that Sunni communities have utterly failed to recognize beyond the myopic and simplistic ""Maliki made us do it"".  Iraq is complicated.  Sunnis accepted genocidal maniacs as brothers, and Shia militias gave IS every propaganda jewel they could ask for.  Democracy is about more than ""we're the majority, you'll get what we give you"", and minorities have to understand that they are, in fact, a minority.  Iraq's fledgling democracy has utterly failed to understand and implement these nuances, and there will never be stability unless it does."

syriancivilwar,3do8dw,thecake_is_a_lie1,4,Sat Jul 18 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"I posted this before and it seems like you haven't even watched the videos.  You see videos straight from sunnis and you don't want to hear it. It's a bit odd.   Iraqi government oppression so bad that they went and raped and commit genocide on the Yezidis?  Nice justification man.  First of all I want to make sure everyone is damn aware that the IRAQI GOVERNMENT is paying the salaries of Maslawis EVEN today. EVEN UNDER ISIS. Why? Because these people will starve. I personally know a christian shabaki from Mosul. His family get's their salary still from the government. This infuriates Iraqis that their money still goes to ISIS areas but damn our hides for having a sense of humanity and not leaving Iraqis for dead.   You might want to look up on the bloody leaks lately that are only proving what many of us iraqis have been screaming for over a decade now. Atheel Nujaifi (A sunni!) was the governor of Ninevah. He ensured that the defense in mosul was made up of maslawis. all the police and the army was maslawi. All that oppression they seem to scream about makes little sense when they literally ran mosul. Let's dig a bit deeper shall we? 30% of Parliament is Sunni ARAB. Despite Sunni Arabs making up 20%~ of the population. Let's keep moving on, the leaks showed the Nujaifi dealt with Daesh for years prior to the fall of mosul. Millions upon millions exchanged.   Him and his brother Usama (The current Vice President if my memory serves) happily stoop up to the media and parliament and proclaimed.  ""ISIS is not real! It is a creation of Maliki to oppress Sunnis!""  The slime ball had the audacity to deal with isis up to the point of his parliamentary powers. A traitor if there ever was a man to represent it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBcb7r1kgoo (ENGLISH SUBS)   Here is what the media of Iraq was saying on the Sunni sides. Denying ISIS exists. Happily. Denying the existence of ISIS and defending it under the guise of ""SUNNI REVOLUTIONARIES!""   Where are these revolutionaries? All we see today is Daesh.   The only noble Sunni revolutionaries are on the side of the Iraqi government. God bless them and their families for taking a stand against the ideology of ISIS.   Today we have hundreds of thousands of families in Karbala, Najaf, Erbil, Suleimaniyah and of course Baghdad. Almost all of them Sunni Arabs.  Why do these people flee the supposed saviors of Sunnis and go to the literal HEAD QUARTERS of Shia militias?   You want to talk about political oppression? Here is the damn Sunni Arab ex-Defense minister in Parliament pleading for his brothers to stop their support of ISIS.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GOyCy-P-hk  The man from Anbar. Bringing forward the realities that people try to hide.   Here it is for you to see. History will always look in the light of the winners and those that walk with ISIS will never be looking from this light.   The quote that rings to me the most from the ex-defense minister is this  (A sunni sheikh from anbar) - (sic) ""I swear, you always only speak like this to strip us of our source of power and disempower us""   Saadoun al-Dulaimi (ex-Defense minister) - What source of empowerment could ISIS bring? ISIS is only the source of humiliation and disgrace!"

I don't even support Iranian theocracy, and I didn't even mention them in that comment. Why link me to them, and then accuse me of being a shill when you're the one who mentioned them in the first place?  Anyways I'm going to repost my comment the last time you said this stupid shit, that you were unable to respond to    I think you are being willful ignorant and yes i think you are a big shill for Iran. That's all you talk about, and you post on iranpolitics. You clearly are not a American first, you don't care that Iranian backed shia terrorists killed 1,500 Americans in Iraq.   That was literally the first time I posted on Iranpolitics, and it was in response to your bullshit. I also do not often often comment all that much, and definitely do not comment or defend Iran all the time. The majority of my commenting is on nation subreddits, and non-political issues. You're either very misinformed or lying through your teeth.  And when did I say I didn't care about Iran's wrong? I don't like Iran's theocratic system, I'm a secularist, and I condemn their support of Assad--you're just making things up. I also brought up the Houthi killing of civilians in Yemen's south in my reply to you, when no one else had. Never once have I gone against those things. I say America first not only because it's my nationality, but because I belief it is the force for good in the world.  If Iran did bad things, it should be recognized. Fuck them for that. But I'm not talking about those things, or defending them. Our engagement has been on Shi'a Militias, and I have refuted your propaganda against them, specifically against Tikrit using Al Jazeera and the NY Times. As you've been unable to refute them you've resorted to calling me a shill, but you haven't been able to actually argue back. If anything, you're the Shill.   I've seen you in many other threads on main reddit, on any topic that has to do with Iran. I recognize your name, you shill for Iran, and you've done it for a long long time.   This is, simply put, a lie. If there is a place I spend it's r/Islam, and that's discussing historical issues on Shiism.   I guess you never asked the question now why these tribes support IS? Because of Maliki and their disenfranchisement from the political process.   So.......what about those facts I have listed on this topic twice now, that you still have not been able to address??  Again and again you've been unable to respond to my arguments and have made false accusations to try and make up for that. But it hasn't worked. It's just poor form.  It's clear, with your baseless accusations and unintelligent attacks (and the fact that you post far more on here than me), that YOU'RE the shill.  Edit: This comment of yours and the ensuing evisceration of your (lack of) logic reveals you as a sectarian, biased, and slanderous user. You have zero legitimacy, and zero basis to call anyone other than yourself a shill.   I'm just going to reiterate: the Sunni Anbar tribes asked for the Shia Militia Hashd to come support and liberate them. I know how much that eats away at you.  The rest of your comment honestly doesn't even warrant a response."

syriancivilwar,3dpt2l,Leadback,-2,Sat Jul 18 12:50:25 2015 UTC,Don't absolve us of responsibility. Any of the countries that participated in the Iraq War should be accepting Iraqi refugees.
syriancivilwar,3dpt2l,IgorForHire,2,Sat Jul 18 08:10:06 2015 UTC,Apparently Detroit has been a little success story with Iraqi refugees. There was that terrible case of the iraqi being gunned down in his yard but that comes with the territory with the random gang killings.
syriancivilwar,3dpt2l,sgamsterdam,2,Sat Jul 18 08:27:29 2015 UTC,"Why? I assume these Iraqi people would prefer to return to their home when things are safe again, so it would be best for them if they can stay in safety close to their homes."
syriancivilwar,3dpt2l,indiffe,0,Sat Jul 18 08:15:08 2015 UTC,"The idea is not that they abduct people against their will from Iraq, but to accept people that actively want to move to those countries."
syriancivilwar,3dpt2l,sgamsterdam,5,Sat Jul 18 08:27:00 2015 UTC,"But again, why? My country has been invaded many times by other countries (Spain, France, Germany, America) but nobody ever considered providing the Dutch with unlimited immigration to those respective countries. These are Iraqi's who belong in Iraq."
syriancivilwar,3dpt2l,Leadback,-1,Sat Jul 18 08:33:26 2015 UTC,"Who are you to tell the Iraqis what they want? If there are Iraqi Christians, for example, who no longer feel Iraq can be a safe home for them because of sectarian conflict, we should accept them as refugees. It's not ""unlimited immigration"" it's ""accepting refugees with genuine fear for their lives"", particularly since we created the conditions for that to occur."
syriancivilwar,3dpt2l,sgamsterdam,3,Sat Jul 18 08:49:38 2015 UTC,"I don't tell Iraqis what they want. I'm sure everyone wants to be happy wealthy successful go to heaven and what not. All I say is that they are Iraqi and belong in Iraq. You seem to imply that the invading countries should accept more or any Iraqi immigrant, which I disagree with. They are adapted to Iraqi society and will be left out in a totally different society. Each of the invading countries has an immigration policy that allows people who are in genuine danger, as far as I know. And Christians seem to be as safe in the Kurdish-controlled regions as the Kurdish themselves."

syriancivilwar,3dpt2l,sgamsterdam,2,Sat Jul 18 09:09:01 2015 UTC,I agree that the invading countries are responsible. Other than that I have no idea what you're trying to say.
syriancivilwar,3dpt2l,Leadback,-1,Sat Jul 18 09:13:50 2015 UTC,"Why do you keep saying ""immigrant""? I'm not advocating for free immigration.

syriancivilwar,3dpt2l,sgamsterdam,2,Sat Jul 18 09:17:52 2015 UTC,"Because refugees are people trying to emigrate because of (fear of) persecution or war. Now, as you and I both now, all Shia, Christians and Yezidi are persecuted by Daesh and all of Iraq and Syria is at war.   A refugee is a person who is outside their home country because they have suffered (or feared) persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or political opinion; because they are a member of a persecuted social category of persons; or because they are fleeing a war. Such a person may be called an ""asylum seeker"" until recognized by the state where they make a claim. ""refugee, n."". Oxford English Dictionary Online. November 2010."

Though IIRC in Syria those restriction are today almost none existing, and only limited to land ownership or something like (this is just of the top of my head so please correct me if wrong).

No I never said they have 2 squadrons.  I said the yearly cost of 1 cessna AC-208 is equal to 2 squadrons of prop plane trainer aircraft we also operate.   They aren't gun trucks either.

It's the other way around, government's remaining presence in Hasakah is at the behest of YPG. YPG could easily sweep the remaining government forces in Hasakah proper but it would certainly lead to more complications such clashes in Qamishli or aerial bombing by SyAAF that can turn many of their cities to rubble."
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,Oneeyebrowsystem,2,Fri Jul 17 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"The MFS is extremely unpopular compared to the GPF in Hasakah, they could easily be routed by the locals."
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,mindblues,3,Sat Jul 18 06:39:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had the same impression. I think they are much stronger in the Assyrian villages around Qamishli (ie. Gharduka etc.).

syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,defend435,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:37:37 2015 UTC,If the SAA does that then the kurds will have no choice but to join the rebels. A 4 faction war would become 3.

But we must not forget the SAA is right now at it weakest point, and the YPD desire the whole canton. So is truce will only last as long as the PYD are willing to honor it.

I am sure the Ba'ath-Arabs always have viewed themselves above the Kurds, which makes it so much sweeter."
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,komnene,2,Fri Jul 17 23:11:30 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Their statehood is more likely than ever in Iraq and Syria. I hope to see the Kurds decide their own destiny finally.
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,defend435,4,Sat Jul 18 05:30:02 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be more profitable for the SAA to move their forces out of Hasakah so they can fight in DEZ for example than just rest there? I mean, after ISIS is done for in Hasakah."
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,komnene,5,Fri Jul 17 15:56:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it would mean giving up a city to Rojava. I don't think Assad is willing to do that."
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,defend435,3,Fri Jul 17 16:17:29 2015 UTC,They gave up all Kurdish majority regions in 2012 up in favor of PYD though.
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,Tabeia,6,Fri Jul 17 16:20:38 2015 UTC,"Then was a tactical withdrawal, a means to focus on other battle that were more vital to the Regime. Back then it was a 3 way fight between rebels, YPD, and the SAA. Plus nobody thought the PYD would gain so much power and be able to secure autonomy. Now if they leave a city, it will be under YPD control permanently. The big question is will withdrawing from Hasakah ruin his image of being the only leader of a united Syria.   But perhaps like U/lieaboutknowingyou said that it would be a better plan to move the troops to Qamishlo and wait for a better military situation to retake it from the kurds."
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,borhas,5,Fri Jul 17 16:26:09 2015 UTC,"I believe many of the SAA there are actually NDF locals which would resist being moved elsewhere, and I've heard many are untrustworthy and would change sides to Daesh just as quickly if shit gets tough.

syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,defend435,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:41:19 2015 UTC,Eventually they probably will but by keeping a presence they can exchange a w/drawal from the city for Kurdish support elsewhere.

syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,sharklazers99,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:38:04 2015 UTC,The problem is the deal won't bring any cash until 90 days. So making a short term deal with the Kurd now is in their best interest of the SAA.
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,EraOfEcology,2,Fri Jul 17 20:26:21 2015 UTC,"Why? The SAA is happy to give up on Kurdish areas but not Christian or Arab areas if they can.

It's going to be really difficult to tell those people to be loyal to Syria if the army is taking every opportunity to abandon them."

syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,sharklazers99,-12,Sat Jul 18 00:55:58 2015 UTC,"So .... your idea of mocking what I wrote is by linking to a picture of the number one Kurdish nationalist?  Don't get me wrong, I like Apo. He came up with ""Democratic confederalism"". The biggest joke I've ever heard of my life. I can understand Bukanin, Marx and Engel for their shitty ideas. At least it was based on decades of study, observation, debates and discussions amongst highly intelligent people from different countries. Their ideas was the synthesis of many people and it look theoretically correct.  Democratic confederalism was just created because Apo failed miserably at winning through military means."
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,flintsparc,8,Fri Jul 17 18:38:58 2015 UTC,"Or because (like many communists post-1989) he started rethinking his views after the fall of the USSR, and because he read Bookchin in prison.  IMO he's got the right idea for the most part.  A little heavy on local control for my taste, but he understands that the problem with Leninist states was the authoritarian rule, not the socialism, and he's trying to build a socialism genuinely responsive to the masses and not a vanguard."
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,sharklazers99,-2,Fri Jul 17 19:27:05 2015 UTC,Well I personally think that is a naive outlook at the man called Apo - which means uncle. The guy runs a cult of personality. He still runs the group even though he is in prison. A normal group would not be so reliant on one man and would have elected a new leader independent of him. Instead they rely so much on a man in jail.  Qandil Kurds is a popular insult toward his group. They go to areas they control and they force their ideology and beliefs on people. It's the biggest reason why they never succeed unless the state collapses. With Syria they had to coordinate their take over with the SAA withdrawal and even with that they had to use their monopoly on violence to eliminate all alternatives.   It's not the first time they've done this. Eliminating rivals is a long habit of theirs. Anybody that can challenge them is either absorbed or gotten rid off.

The Atheism of the PKK helps them win western support but makes it impossible for them to ever win in Iraq, Turkey or Iran. They only got Syria because they state withdrew and they were able to violently suppress rival Kurdish groups.   They are neither Grassroots orientated nor democratic. We're talking about a group that is often insulted with the term of ""Qandil Kurds"". They send their people to force Kurds into something they may not like. If they called themselves a Vanguard Party I could respect them on some level. Islamists never hide about how they wish to impose values on others. Yet the PKK is dishonest about their intentions and always has been.  Multi-ethnic, non-statits? Don't embarrass yourself. The PKK is not a new group. There is no mystery to them. They are a Kurdish nationalist who want to run a secular Kurdish nation. They'll throw a bone at non-kurds but they will always be under the thumb of the organisation. Just like the entire state they create. No rival groups are allowed and no alternative ideology is allowed. It's their way or the bullet.  This group exists only because of ME is constantly being destabalised and weakened. When a strong state exists and doesn't actively discriminate against Kurds, they get eradicated. It's why they declared a ceasefire with Turkey when AKP was in charge. It's also why they had to get Barzani to save them from the Iranian forces. Too many Kurds put their faith with Erdogan and his Islamist agenda in Turkey. Shia Kurds in Iran like the new Islamic Republic unlike the Persian only Phalavi Iran."

One of those things that annoys me is how much they and their supporters pretend that YPG isn't the PKK. I'm glad to see your open about this.  Oh and yeah they do have western support. I grew up with Kurds openly preaching for them, waving their flags and spreading their propaganda. When Apo was captured their supporters turned violent in London. Tell me. If that was Al-Qaeda or ISIS or any other terrorist group, would any European government be that tolerant? People are openly travelling to fight with them. They're on a terrorist list but it doesn't mean much. The biggest problem European government has with them is the criminal activities they use to fund themselves."

I'm not sure how much more ""open"" you want them to be, they've been very transparent on what they're doing and every area they've taken over relatively quickly goes under the control of a local council. Getting coalition airstrikes is paltry western support compared to the mass of arms and training other groups in the region receive. And if you think the West tolerates YPG/PKK because they're secular you're sorely mistaken. Explain US historic support for ""moderate"" Islamists then?"
syriancivilwar,3dmsmf,flintsparc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:25:11 2015 UTC,Heavily affiliated? Mate they are a front group for them. When they sent their fighters into Sinjar they suddenly turned from being YPG to the PKK.  Also western air support is not paltry. It's much more valuable than getting weapons. Air attacks are force multiplier on so many levels that the best weapons and tactics on the ground can't compensate. The YPG isn't that great at fighting especially offensively. The air strikes allow them to be an important and powerful group.

His new attitude towards Islam is the same exact attitude towards Kurdish nationalism and Democratic confederalism. Tools to be used to gain an advantage.   Just look at this part to tell you how hollow he is.   PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan are promoting an interpretation of Islam that bolsters Kurdish nationalist aspirations, but it remains to be seen exactly how they will deploy this turn to religion.   The biggest stumbling block the PKK has faced is Islam. Islam is against nationalism and considers all Muslims to be brothers and sisters. The extreme case of this is forgien jihadists who think they are helping their brethren.  Kurds contrary to popular belief are among the most devout, and conservative people in the region. In fact a lot of the early and very bloody revolts by Kurds in the early times of Turkey was precisely against Turkish idea of secularism. Kurds have always had an integral role in the Ottomans and when they fought in the Turkish war of independence, they weren't fighting for Turkish nationalism. They thought they were fighting to keep an Islamic system.  The so called Secular Kemalist military wasn't above using Islam isolate the PKK ideology but Erdogan and AKP really changed the game. They weren't hypocrites and they made efforts to reach out to Kurds. The peace talks with the PKK was precisely done by Erdogan to reach out to these Kurds.  The PKK will never be successful in all four countries until they can crack that nut. That is why the PKK's political face in Turkey choose Dermitas. Despite his liberal views he is well know for being personally religious and has legitimately called out the state for abusing Islam.  He's not someone who would say something stupid like this   Thanks to this vision, he rejects the claims of being atheist, communist or materialist and instead re-defines his movement as a contemporary synthesis of Salahaddinian and Huseynian movements.   Saladin and Hussien are the opposite of what the PKK espouses. Saladin for example ruled over Arab people in Egypt and Syria who saw him as a Muslim ruler and not a Kurdish ruler. The pride people have over Saladin is because he fought for Islam"

They would listen to him respectfully, but then they’d tell him they didn’t like local government any more than they liked any other kind; and they objected to majority voting, because it meant the minority wouldn’t get their way. They preferred nonpolitical communitarian groups, cooperatives, radical bookstores, communes.  Bookchin thought such institutions were fine, but to make a serious revolution, you needed a way to gain active, concrete, vested, structural, legal political power. Libertarian municipalism was a way to do that, to get a firm toehold against the nation-state.  He wooed the anarchists. He courted, pleaded with, wheedled, begged, intoned, and scolded them.  He did everything to persuade them that libertarian municipalism was the way to make anarchism politically relevant. But by 1999—around the time of Öcalan’s arrest--he was finally admitting that he had failed, and he was in the process of disengaging from anarchism.   Yeah Bookchin actually shat all over ""lifestyle anarchists"" that think it's more important to eat from the trash cans or to smash windows during protests than to actually try to build a new society, which is why he was hated and isolated by the anarchists for a long time.  But I think that Rojava can be a ""Russian Revolution"" moment for the anarchist movement - a clear-cut modern example of a working anarchist system. If the PYD commits more to anarchism, anyway, than it currently does. And actually self-identifies as such."

syriancivilwar,3dno5r,flintsparc,12,Fri Jul 17 20:36:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sympathetic to that interpretation, but don't agree 100%. I think that in a lot of places, anarchism has come to mean something different now than it did in the 19th and early 20th century. Essentially, anarchism has become lifestylism in a big way now. That's not to say that most anarchists are post-leftists or stirnerites (they're not), but the ""praxis"" of modern anarchism is essentially lifestylism.  Consider the words of the platformist organisation Prairie Struggle in announcing the death of their organisation:  Thus, at this point, we will admit (with tongue in cheek) that we are the assholes that judge people for putting so much energy into their bicycles, gardens, zines, and liberated foods while they ignore or reject unions, shop floors, communities and schools as forums to organize within. We think some of them might miss the point of this whole ideology. Our goal is to organize people towards alternatives, not organize alternatives in hopes that people join them. While we propose waging class war within our society, this war is waged where workers live, work, and organize themselves, not on the margins of the above. In conclusion, building autonomous, combative, and democratic strategies within the mainstream is what organizes those within the mainstream, not a radical alternative that is run in a dank basement which appeals only to us, our friends, and orgies of the discontent.(1)  As someone who has been involved in anarchist communities for around half a decade, to me at least, this seems to reflect the conditions of the anarchist movement in a big way. There are, of course, exceptions to this such as anarchism in Spain and the broader platformist movement, but anarchism as a movement in North America has turned into the exact thing that it decried as a strawman argument not long ago: Anti-organisation, lifestylism, and nihilism.  In my view, Communalism grew outwards from the anarchist movement, improving upon its ideas and modernising them. But I don't think it's necessarily correct to call Communalism anarchism (nor do I think that would be a good PR move to make).  Edit: To expand on this, I also feel that anarchism doesn't adequately address the question of power. Even the supposedly pro-organisation anarcho-syndicalists in Spain, decried declaring libertarian communism after the suppression of the Francoist coup as a ""bolshevik seizure of power"", thus surrendering power to the bourgeoisie. Similarly, I've even seen anarcho-communists condemning the PYD arresting anti-revolutionary dissidents. Are we, as revolutionaries, to just let counter-revolutionary forces organise and overtake us? No. They must be suppressed. Anarchism is essentially negative individual freedom (as Bookchin said), and does not adequately address power in this sense. Communalism improves upon this. Does this make Communalism ""authoritarian""? Perhaps more so than anarchism, though of course Kropotkin's ""Ethics"" and social anarchism's love of collective freedom are fundamental part of our ideology. But if this makes Communalism authoritarian, then inversely, anarchism is anti-organisational and incapable of revolution."

syriancivilwar,3dno5r,MarksAndAngles,5,Fri Jul 17 20:59:43 2015 UTC,"as someone in rojava, Im interested to see people's analysis of the situation here from an anarchist perspective.  First of all, I would say that the ideology of Rojava is definitely anarchist. They are investing to create cooperatives, people's assemblies / direct democracy, social revolution (education, women, ...) before political revolution, and local defense committees responsible for defending their areas.  however there is a vanguard, in essence PKK members that are placed in every organisation that are steering them. Many of them have read lots of books and philosophy including Foucalt, Bookchin, Ocalan, ... and there is a state structure that exists. When you talk to them about this, the idea is that now Rojava is in a sea of states and must be a state to protect itself in terms of defense, foreign policy, administration, ... civil society needs to be administered and you need an army with a strategic command. But they are trying to empower the people's structures and autonomous governance wherever possible. For instance (to some degree at least), the force is answerable to these democratic delegates chosen by popular assemblies. They're trying to engineer a situation where as much as these autonomous democratic structures can take over, the state will be forced to cede control.  My fear though is that there's a war and this is shaping things heavily, making a militarised culture and also that because resources are few it's difficult. Also sometimes the people in charge aren't always the best for the job, and that's a form of corruption. You are however free to open a business, and there's no taxes for shops. But normal people see Barzani and all the western companies in Erbil, and they want that. They want nice clothes, glass skyscrapers, western malls .etc and so there's pressure from society to recreate a bourgeois state too."

I've heard that during the 1937 May Days uprising, militia aimed artillery at the CNT headquarters due to the dispute!  The problem, I think, was that the CNT was never actually an anarcho-syndicalist union, but merely a relatively militant labor union, despite the rhetoric.  It's simply not possible to have an organization grow that rapidly yet be internally organized (see my other post on the lowest level of this page).  And so the CNT leadership turned out to be the same kind of counterrevolutionary politicians and bureaucrats, and the 'mass' of the CNT was too bewildered and disorganized to depose them despite almost certainly being powerful enough, on paper, to do so.

""Mass"" is definitely struck down in ""Anti-Mass"": http://ickevald.net/resistance/anti-mass.htm but the summary is that when one says ""mass"" they are speaking of a specific organizational structure; one in which there is a huge population which is essentially not internally organized, such as a crowd or a Party; the organization and direction of this mass is therefore handled by a steering committee (or vanguard or whatever you want to call it) much as the pilot of a Zeppelin controls the direction of a huge bag of gas.  In much the same way, mass organizing turns the subject- generally, the proletariat- into objects.  The lesson from the failed Marxian revolutions of the 20th century should be this: That model can never lead to liberation, because it does not help the revolutionary subject gain practice in their own project; the period in which they have an opportunity to self-organize is rarely more than several months, and that is simply never enough time to build a new organizational structure that can withstand the inevitable counterrevolution.  Prefiguration- building the structure of the new world even as the old one is standing- is necessary as the only way to not be caught flat-footed yet again and therefore the only worthwhile organizational scheme is of decentralized but highly organized federations of a tremendous number of autonomous small groups- the exact opposite of the mass!

This has nothing to do with abandoning the post-Ghouta strike. It's utter absurdity to think that hitting Assad in 2013 would have made a difference. In fact, if the regime had had it's back broken at that time, we could be seeing a country divided between Islamist rebels + FSA, the Kurds, and Islamic State.

How about...um idk...not supporting the insurgency, giving it logistical and financial aid, training its fighters and terrorists, extending it diplomatic legitimacy, and economically sanctioning/embargoing/blockading Syria to begin with which created the conditions under which the insurgency could be transformed from minor unrest into what it is today? Is the mentality of ideologically-driven liberal interventionism and desire to shore up Saudi and Israeli interests in the trans-Atlantic defense establishment (primarily British, French, American, Canadian) so hopelessly entrenched that possibly considering the option of less intervention rather than more isn't even on the table? That the Western elite need not have its fingers in every country on Earth cannot even be fathomed?  We can talk and talk and talk in circles but the fact remains that there existed and exists only three real options.  1) The U.S. and its European subordinates (primarily Britain, France, and Germany) never start the covert state-sponsorship of terrorism and dirty war against Syria to begin with and prevent their Middle Eastern clients from doing so. As it is too late to take it back, end it now - it is within the West's power to cut all support and yank the leash back on those countries which are responsible for destabilizing the modern Middle East to an unprecedented degree today. Syria lies on their heads but also Iraq. If they are not stopped Lebanon will also and a hot war with Iran. I'm referring to Saudi Arabia (and by extension the GCC statelets in its orbit, with the notable exception of Oman) and Turkey.  2). Directly intervene by a bombing campaign aimed against Syria ignoring any defensive counter-measures and geostrategic risks this entails. Say it is an outright victory after a year or so and the government falls. Now the country is divided between the Islamist rebel alliance (including FSA and more hardline Salafists like Nusra and Ahrar ash-Sham) and ISIL. Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan, etc. in an even more sensitive area in the heart of the Middle East with no greater chance of stabilizing and in all likelihood a stronger ISIL rather than weaker (which will impact Iraq directly in addition to Syria, but also Lebanon for sure and potentially Jordan)  3) Directly invade Syria and station occupation forces nationwide indefinitely. They would have to be there for 50 years or more unless we were talking scorched Earth tactics and annihilation. So it will be a brutal COIN which will use torture and commit atrocities inevitably just as the Syrian COIN does only it will receive a greater degree of Western media complicity meaning less coverage until it gets bloody for Western soldiers (quickly and extremely). Picture some combination of the Vietnam War and the last 2003-2011 Iraq War/second Persian Gulf War with a Western domestic audience which grows more squeamish and less tolerant and forgiving of casualties by the year. PR disaster which will produce a political shakeup at home and later hasten a withdrawal which will simply see a reversion to the second scenario. Like Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and many countries before, Syria is a developing state in the global-south, not a military superpower and thus can be conquered, but any attempt to control it (read - forcibly liberalize) will be an abomination and a black hole which will drain Western economies, patience, morale, and confidence in the infallibility and broad applicability of their own values yet drier.  Best bet is not supporting terrorists in other people's countries to begin with the moment they defy you on a few issues which are inconsequential to your long-term security and well-being as a nation anyway."

When the extremist has more money and weapons? So what you are also now saying is that since the extremist is a better fighting force then FSA, then the FSA cant take on them.  How do you expect a weak FSA to win this war? They can even fight Assad without allieing with Al qada (and ISIS)  Finally about time you saw the truth. Thank you. Thank you so much."
syriancivilwar,3drfit,I-Should_Be-Studying,0,Sun Jul 19 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"""So let me get this straight. The moderates rebels left FSA to go to extreme factions because they are stronger fighting force (ie more money, weapons, (and now also more men)). So what you are telling me, is that the FSA is weak"".  Unlike the SAA, the moderates were not financed by Iran or armed by Russia.  ""That is what you just said. Rebels left the moderates to go to extremist groups, because they are stronger. Just now you have finally admitted to what I have been saying for years, the FSA is to weak"".  The FSA has been allowed to fragment because of Obama's reluctance to provide the necessary levels of support.  Each of his Defense Secretaries have blamed him so.  ""Also how to you expect the moderates to fight extremist when Assad goes away"".  The Assad regime has murdered far more Syrians than those extremists you keep comparing it with.  The claim that Assad can ever again rule Syria is infantile.   ""So what you are also now saying is that since the extremist is a better fighting force then FSA, then the FSA cant take on them"".  You are forgetting those Sunni conscripts within the SAA who have no love for the regime and would willingly battle the likes of ISIS rather the butcher there fellow men.  We're now seeing many more defections take place so we must simply hope they continue.  ""How do you expect a weak FSA to win this war? They can even fight Assad without allieing with Al qada (and ISIS).  Finally, about time you saw the truth. Thank you. Thank you so much"".  You have absolutely nothing to thank me for.  I will always continue to look upon your rhetoric with absolute disdain."
syriancivilwar,3drfit,Goldilocks-smile,2,Sun Jul 19 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"Unlike the SAA, the moderates were not financed by Iran or armed by Russia.   No they are financed by Turkey and golfstates. Also the saa is the national army of syria, and the goverment is the legitment goverment of syria. They buy there wepons from russia, like many other controry do. They are not ""armed"" by russia. They are ""armed"" by them self since they boght the wepons. They have Iranian credit line like many other has credit lines. But the FSA is not a goverment, but rather terrorist group.    The FSA has been allowed to fragment because of Obama's reluctance to provide the necessary levels of support. Each of his Defense Secretaries have blamed him so.   But it still means that the FSA is weak. What is and what is not Obamas fult is not importent her. What importent the battelfield is that they can fight. Assad and other extrimist. Something they cant.    The Assad regime has murdered far more Syrians than those extremists you keep comparing it with. The claim that Assad can ever again rule Syria is infantile.

We're now seeing many more defections take place so we must simply hope they continue.   Eh, The majorty of the defactions was around 2011 and 2012. But how do you know they will fight when assad is gone? and how many are we talking about? half? do you think half of SAA will join FSA if Assad falles?    You have absolutely nothing to thank me for. I will always continue to look upon your rhetoric with absolute disdain.   Okey. Sure. But Can you please anware me. If the FSA is weak that fighers are joing extrimist to fight. How do you expect FSA to fight them afterwerds when Assad falls? How do you expect a weak FSA to win this war? They can even fight Assad without allieing with Al qada (and ISIS)"

syriancivilwar,3dms03,revengineering,-4,Fri Jul 17 21:21:43 2015 UTC,Pretty much more proof that ISIS simply retreated and din't put up a fight. The latest arms haul is pretty weak for the Kurds on this subreddit who keep trying to claim that ISIS put up a huge defence.
syriancivilwar,3dms03,Moh7,10,Fri Jul 17 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"Schweinii has literally posted videos and pictures totaling some 1250-1500 firearms captured from Da3sh by YPG from Kobane to Haskah during the past 9 months with hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition and all sorts of equipment to go along with it. That the particular one he posted today only had   (4) RPG-7 with (22) warheads (1) AKM (1) PKM (1) DShK HMG (1) B-10 recoilless rifle with (15) rounds of ammunition Several thousand rounds of 7.62x39 and 7.62x54R   doesn't really speak to any thing other than that's what this specific picture set shows. There tends to be several of these from each engagement they participate in, released at different phases in fights by different people. Moreover, Da3sh cannot afford to hemorrhage weapons and ammunition forever. Like every other military and paramilitary organization, when able they grab the weapons and ammo that their dead or wounded comrades drop. There was a video released just today from in Aleppo where a Liwa Fursan al-Haq fighter is shot and his comrades run forward and grab his rifle while he's carried away.  Your statement doesn't ""prove"" anything."
syriancivilwar,3dms03,LiesAboutKnowingYou,-9,Fri Jul 17 21:40:02 2015 UTC,Very misleading of you to bring up the last 9 months including Konaine when all were talking about is ain Issa. People on this sub claimed that ISIS actually tried to defend it when ammo hauls from the region prove they dint.
syriancivilwar,3dms03,Moh7,8,Fri Jul 17 21:43:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not misleading at all. I'm saying Schweinii posts so many ammo haul pictures and they're almost never all inclusive for that operation. As in there are likely several more from this specific operation, but either way, ammo hauls are far from the best way to determine the level of resistance in these fights. All ammo hauls show is how much was left behind not how much was there. Your metric is an absurd way of measuring fights. The SAA routinely abandons positions and leaves behind HUGE strockpiles of ammunition. Are we to interpret now that the SAA is losing hundreds of men because hundreds of rifles are captured in a given offensive? Of course not.  This isn't ""proof"" of anything other than that weapons were captured."
syriancivilwar,3dms03,LiesAboutKnowingYou,-6,Fri Jul 17 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"You can't compare the SAA to ISIS. ISIS is smart with their ammo because they know that if they entrench and defend a position US air strikes will keep them from receiving reinforcements and supplies. So actually my comparison makes perfect sense, you're the one that's putting words in my mouth and making it seem as if I'm saying that ISIS never defended anything. I'm talking about a single certain battle where Kurds on this sub were claiming that ISIS was defending the town with everything they had when the reality was they had retreated long ago and din't actually put up a defense. The lack of arms and ammo simply proves that."
syriancivilwar,3dms03,Moh7,4,Fri Jul 17 22:15:09 2015 UTC,"The lack of arms and ammo simply proves that.   You have a very weird idea of what ""proof"" is. Captured arms are not PROOF of the size of an enemy or his resistance. They're solely proof of what he left behind. It's really that simple."

syriancivilwar,3dmdom,Seefor,11,Fri Jul 17 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"Well, we weaken our understanding of why people in certain parts of the world support the so-called Islamic State, for one.  And in wars everyone's exaggerating and spreading propaganda, so if everyone says their piece it balances out - but you get a skewed perspective if one side isn't doing that, and IS looks like it's doing worse than it really is.  I am a free speech absolutist in the first place, so I'm certainly biased here.  But I also think if someone's going to join IS it won't be from some guy with 10 downvotes trying to support them but having his claims heavily disputed on a subreddit that front pages their atrocities.  The other issue is that there are no clean hands here - IS may be the worst of the worst, but they're far from the only loathsome side.  The regime is a fascist dictatorship which barrel bombs its own people.  The rebellion is at the very least openly accepting support from JaN, even if in some parts they're trying to freeze them out of power, and JaN is still a branch of al-Qaeda and massacred a bunch of Druze in Idlib.  I'm a strong supporter of the YPG, but even they include of a lot of people who carried out terrorist attacks in Turkey, they use child soldiers, and some of their members may have engaged in ethnic cleansing or trashing Arab villages.  And every side's taking foreign fighters, even if IS is best at it - so how can we discuss things at all if we're afraid of that?"
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,oreng,-5,Fri Jul 17 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"we weaken our understanding of why people in certain parts of the world support the so-called Islamic State, for one   again you need to tell me what is this value that we would miss? We know what ISIS wants and its ideology is. What else do we need to understand?   But I also think if someone's going to join IS it won't be from some guy with 10 downvotes trying to support them but having his claims heavily disputed on a subreddit that front pages their atrocities.   this isn't how it works and I can tell from your comment that you know better. ISIS uses many internet tools to reach young people in regions it has no physical assess to. a Reddit post by it self isn't going to swing someone from being to normal to flying too Syria. But a reddit post could easily be part of much larger effort recruit online.   but they're far from the only loathsome side. The regime is a fascist dictatorship which barrel bombs its own people.   the Syrian regime doesn't rely on foreign recruits to fight the war. If thousands of people were flying Syrian for fight for Assad and carryout war crimes that I favour banning Assad supporter too."
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,Seefor,4,Fri Jul 17 17:55:38 2015 UTC,How bout everyone involved in the Civil War. IS supporters have more rights to post here than some western teenage keyboard warriors who would have not heard about the ME if it wasn't for 911.
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,oreng,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:19:50 2015 UTC,No. No one has any more right than anyone else. Own a computer or phone? Have a desire to learn and talk about this conflict? Willing to follow the rules? You have as much a right to post here as actual people living in Syria.
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,Seefor,2,Sat Jul 18 02:23:58 2015 UTC,"Then you'd be silencing what is a huge perspective in the conflict. It would be no different than making a page where opposition or regime supporters couldn't post, and you'd increase the chance of creating an echo chamber."
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,moneymakingmitch23,9,Fri Jul 17 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"Thelord444 and lullabaya pretty much stick to posting propaganda vids. Which, let's be honest, 90% of the content on this sub is propaganda from some faction or another. They don't explicitly advocate for the crimes that IS commits, though they clearly support the group. I don't have a problem with them (speaking strictly about sub content, not morally)."
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,Seefor,4,Fri Jul 17 17:19:50 2015 UTC,"They don't explicitly advocate for the crimes that IS commits, though they clearly support the group.   I think they're aware it might earn them a ban or ending up on a watch list. I asked Thelord444 if he supported the murder of the Western civilians in Tunesia and he gave a vague answer that he was still making up his mind about it and that he would have to think on it."
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,ShutUpWoodsie,3,Fri Jul 17 16:17:12 2015 UTC,Actually I speak with him in IRC nearly every day. The rules in IRC are infinitely more lax than on the sub and he's just as confused/conflicted/inconsistent there.  His indecision has nothing to do with a ban and I'm pretty sure he's aware that he is all but guaranteed to be on every watchlist under the sun at this stage.
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,Territomauvais,4,Fri Jul 17 18:52:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds like he's a kid who is just enarmoured by Jihadist ideology and likes it as a way to find his roots/identify (he lives in a Western country afaik), but still knows that some of the stuff IS does is too abhorrent for him to actually support it.  I hope he wises up. Going through a rebellious phase as a young man can be bad enough, but when you do it by supporting a terror organisation and leaving traces of that all over the internet... You can ruin your life."
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,ShootAK12,2,Fri Jul 17 19:55:57 2015 UTC,He specifically doesn't live in a western country but your description would be apt for a fairly large subset of the IS supporters online.

Anything other than supporting Daesh on the internet. We can crowdfund the kid a Ford Mustang if he's really bored.
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,-Bingo-,4,Fri Jul 17 20:37:53 2015 UTC,"Why?  As much as I hope ISIS is obliterated, they should be able to fly their flag while they're here.   Separating the innocent from those colluding with, or participating in war crimes and crimes against humanity is something we've had an issue with in the past. The more transparency the better.   Shit, if everyone showed their true colors, we could eliminate ISIS almost immediately. Part of the problem is in fact that nobody knows the difference between an overt ISIS Sympathizer and a regular Western Muslim from afar.   Similarly, it's extremely hard to get large amounts of credible intelligence indicating which members of the predominately Suuni-Arab population in which ISIS controls are supporting them outright or because of fear, or because they're a member of ISIS themselves and have pledged themselves to Al-Baghdadi- etc etc.  One of the hardest parts about retaking large cities like Mosul, ar-Raqqah and to a lesser extent Ramadi and Fallujah is that we don't necessarily know who the enemy is (especially foot soldiers) until the battle actually begins. And this causes us to delay attempting to retake the cities, which results in ISIS being able to dig themselves in deeper, yadda yadda.   The truth is they act like a State in many ways, but militarily they still use the tactics of insurgents because...well, from what I've read, 2/3 (at least) of them used to be insurgents.   So that makes sense. Anyway, I'm going to be quiet now."
syriancivilwar,3dmdom,-Bingo-,-1,Sat Jul 18 07:38:54 2015 UTC,Why are IS supporters allowed here?

I can't help thinking that they might be a liability to the society that they're living in (as they're mostly in Western countries) and that the mods should report them to the authorities, since they need to be on a watch list.  Can you imagine if one of them carried out a lone wolf attack and their internet history led back to this subreddit? It's probably very unlikely, but jeez."

syriancivilwar,3dmdom,Pointwest418,16,Fri Jul 17 14:24:55 2015 UTC,What 99% of the sub doesn't see are the real extreme IS supporters who are banned immediately after making their first comment in which they cheer for the deaths of Westerners and/or openly support killing anyone who doesn't fall in line with their ideology.

Going through his posts and realizing he was only a toddler when 9/11 happened was a real wake-up call for me. We have reached the point where young Islamists have little or no memory of the events that sparked recent American involvement in the middle east. This generation's youngest memories are likely during the height of bloodshed and American hubris of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan so it's no wonder they grow up hating the West and being drawn towards Islamism and its associated death cults.

It also has a vast fan base outside of the area it controls. A forum like this, where there is a strict policy concerning offending one another, and an openness to all points of view is a rare opportunity to try and understand the IS state of mind.  The way some feel about IS is the same I feel about Hezbollah, which has caused me more damage than IS ever will. Other people feel the same way about Israel as others do about IS. Should Hezbollah or Israel supporters be banned?  Is this subreddit a spot where someone is going to be convinced that IS is the correct path and is to supported?

It's a fine line to walk and the mods do it fairly well, but I think this is a good reminder for everyone to take a step back and reflect on what actually takes place here. The content and discourse on this sub take a sharp turn towards glorification and propaganda at times and this is when the mods should put their foot down, keeping the Islamist and IS supporters in line just like everyone else. Even Liveleak doesn't allow execution snuff videos from IS to be posted and while there's always a couple people who will scream ""censorship"" at any degree of moderation, that turned out to be a pragmatic and effective decision in establishing a red line and preventing their open media forum from degenerating into something else entirely.

Literally no one in the history of ever worth talking to or considering their opinion as serious or informed, thinks al-Qaeda is moderate. BY COMPARISON TO Da3sh there is certainly an, at first glance, appearance that is slightly less repulsive than Da3sh, but anyone who's opinion is worth paying attention to recognizes that while not quite a 10 on the Salafi spectrum, that the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda is only slightly trailing behind. Jabhat al-Nusra and AQAP are not ""Allowed"" to build their organization openly in either Syria or Yemen. In both they air airstruck by the US government, their leadership decapitated by drone strikes, and their assets frozen and seized. In both countries, the weak governments, faced with internal war, are incapable of crushing the movements and so they are able to continue to grow.  No one is ""allowing"" them to build their organization. That is absurd."

Also, what will happen with JAN/AAS/JI? will Turkey/KSA step up support or will they accomodate....?

If the SAA has proper momentum behind them, I would agree that pushing on in the general direction of DeZ would be the best thing to do. Removing Daesh from the vincinity of T4 and Palmyra shouldn't be too far-fetched, and if the stars align they could get close to, link with, and/or liberate DeZ.  If they take it after some grueling campaign and Daesh keeps fighting for every dune and palm tree, then set up some buffer around Palmyra so that they're not directly in it and keep enough troops there to ensure they don't come back whenever they feel like it. The troops that you can peel off should first make an effort to clear the vincinity of Tiyas, and then go to Damascus and clear out the various pockets of rebels in and around it. Clearing these will free up the troops that were present already, creating a snowball effect if you will.   From there on, the scenario will have had its changes. But looking at the maps now, I'd go for the countryside of Homs and then, in general, north into the Latakia and Idlib governorates."

This is influenced by me being a chickenshit strategist, but once the SAA has got a Palmyra-DeZ corridor and a big force in the latter, they'll have stirred up a massive hornet's nest. They'd have to hunker down and clean their backyard before moving up from Deir, following the rivers to either Hasakah or Raqqa.  Which is why I'd much rather see the SAA stop at Palmyra, because these are endgame manoeuvres it simply can't follow up on."

If pockets are cleared and troops snowball to the reserve, then I would -just to be sure- deploy extra boots to the south. But it is not a priority, and seeing the last offensive by the southern front didn't give me the feeling that they could run into Damascus at their leisure. It's not as much that I think it's secure enough/unimportant than that I think it's more important to capitalise on here-and-now advantages, or take the initiative in the north."

They'll probably continue operations with Hezbollah in the rest of the rebel holdouts in rif dimshaq.  If we're talking about the next SAA offensive I think there's three options:   Connecting the eastern Aleppo salient to Nubl. This would cut a supply line for the rebels in Idlib and isolate the ones in Aleppo from help. Bosra Sham. Cut off the lajat area. Western Hama. Frikka is doomed if every other SAA convoy there is getting ambushed. They need a buffer zone against 1st coastal, even if it costs them some armor."

syriancivilwar,3dmb4j,Balak_Jewboma,3,Fri Jul 17 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"Does anyone really think that, even with the most recent victories, Assad is ever going to have control over more than 2/3 or 1/2 of Syria?  I think Assad's best play is to consolidate his areas of control and dig in.  He will not be facing an enemy with advanced air assets any time soon which makes the defense of areas relatively simple if the defense is properly planned and executed.  I realize that ""if"" is easy to write but difficult to execute, but it is doable.    Assad should be rotating front line troops back for R&R and training whenever possible, not sending them on more and more advances just to get territory that will then be difficult to defend.  Let them go home to be heroes and see their families.  Remind them why they're fighting - because if they don't win, some of their enemies will slaughter their families.  Assad should be sending bulldozers (and troops/snipers to protect them from ATGMs) and concrete teams to every city, base, checkpoint, etc. to make those areas defensible against suicide bombers - the main ""game changers"" in the conflict.  I have yet to see a vehicle made that can penetrate layers of concrete obstacles, berms, ditches, etc. to get to its target, especially when those obstacles are set up in a way to allow defenders to have clear sight lines.    As we've seen on this sub, Assad has plenty of obsolete weaponry that can pack a fairly good punch if deployed properly - a 50's AA gun can still wreak havoc on enemies who are having to work their way through obstacles, around minefields, etc.  Yeah, they're still vulnerable to TOWs, but there are only so many TOWs to go around and every ""glory"" shot shown on Youtube is certainly accompanied by a number of misses.  Finally, Assad should be cutting as many deals with the Iranians as possible.  Guess what - Iran is no longer on everyone's ""bad country list"" and they're about to see an influx in revenue.  Iran also want more regional influence.  Give it to them in exchange for weapons, supplies, and perhaps personnel."
syriancivilwar,3dmb4j,Sierrahun,2,Fri Jul 17 21:18:29 2015 UTC,"Uh, I'm not sure really. The SAA doesn't have the strength for front-wide offensives anymore. So all I can think of is yet another attempt to encircle Aleppo. I imagine that encircling the city would still be possible if they put all their strength towards it. Clearing out the various pockets dotting ""important Syria"" could be a good idea as well.  But again, I don't really know what the SAA could do strategically."

They don't even have the same size force that they did at the beginning of the war. They should be expanding, not contracting. The NDF has a lot of guys who joined to not deploy far away.  SAA can retake palmyra, I don't think they have enough men nor the logistical capability to do much more than that.  If they take both places they have to garrison them.

They went on to lose Brigade 52 (Daraa), Tadmur/Palmyra (Homs), various gas production points (Homs), parts of Daraa city, and most recently parts of Aleppo city including the Military Research Center.  In the same period they have lost 14 jets and helicopters, approximately 150 tanks, 200 armored vehicles, and who knows how many troops (several thousand known). Where specifically is it you see them being ""more effective and disciplined"" now? Because Hezbollah backed forces are managing to reclaim some hilltops and are now fighting a city that has been captured and lost by the SAA 3 times now?

If the Jordanian and Turkish border was shut the rebellion would just die but it won't be. For the government to win they have to secure their core strategic areas and be able to endure.   So far this war is going on because those who support the terrorists expect Assad to give up before they do. However they have been steadily backing down and in reality its their hand that is getting weaker. A point needs to be reached where they realise they can't topple the government and they can't install puppets before it ends.

syriancivilwar,3dmb4j,FoundinMystery,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"I see the same circlejerk mindset that has been common amongst rebels and their supporters in your.   Assad won't win and if he does he won't truly win or be a real leader.  A mindset that creates the impression that a rebel victory is inevitable and if isn't it should be.  Anyway your wrong. The rebels have had thousands of tonnes of weapons shipped to them. While they certainly do loot from the SAA, the game changing weapons they have comes from abroad. They also rely heavily on constant supplies from Jordan and Turkey. Once the border is shut they start collapsing as we saw in Homs province.  Oh and no Assad isn't anybodies puppet. This war is being primarily fought because refused to be a Western puppet leader. Either way the rebels are much worse when it comes to owing fealty to forgien governments and even engage in embrassing practices such as thanking their gulf sponsposers.  Oh and the country will be reunited once the war is over. The only way there will be a piece left untouched will be if the West wants the YPG to be a thorn on the side of Damascus to keep the country week. Once those borders are shut there will be no Libyan style rebel zones allowed."
syriancivilwar,3dmb4j,TIMSONBOB,0,Sat Jul 18 02:02:10 2015 UTC,"Yep Assad is a Iranian and Russian puppet. The west wants democracy and unless you are claiming the democratically elected leaders in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Ukraine are western puppets you are a clown.  Tons of weapons from abroad? Nope. Most weapons have come from the SAA and more ATGMS have been captured from the SAA than TOWS and HJ8 have been provided.  If the west and gulf states were providing TV arms you accuse them of Assad would be gone.  The west and the gulf could easily give them a few SA-7s and other MANPADS to destroy Assads Air Force.   There is a reason the rebels use home made hell canons instead of mortars.  No they would not collapse of the border was closed, they might starve but they get most of their arms from the SAA.  Iran and Russia propping Assad up is the only reason he exists. Clearing out the area with Hezbollah is in Hezbollahs interests, While the SAA lose Idlib.  Keep the flase narrative about the west wanting a puppet, that stopped happening years ago. The west builds strong independent democracies and they will of course ally themselves with the west.  What sane country would allow weapons to flow to the terrorist group Hezbollah?  The west is one the side of right, human rights, democracy, free markets. The west and the U.S. are on the side of good, they don't need puppets because good people want prosperity.  which is why Assad is allied with Russia and Iran. One being dictatorship under Putin, that other a dictatorship theocracy.  Iran is calling the shots in Syria, if the puppet Assad didn't listen Iran wouldn't give him money, advisors, fighters, and Hezbollah would leave.  I know you regime supporters have to lie a lot to yourself to justify your support for a mass murdering dictator, but the rest of the world is against you. Only shit hole nations are allied with Russia and Iran.  Lol Iran, Russia, and Syria have a major thing in common. They all have state owned news instead of free. To lie to the idiot population.

Iran feeds off instability, applying the knowledge it gained through its own revolution and destructive war to rebuild broken states and empower local communities. Wherever you find Iran's footprint today, you'll see a trail of destruction left behind by events that had nothing to do with Iran.  In Lebanon, Hezbollah was the product of a civil war and Israeli occupation.  Syria had descended into turmoil and civil war long before Iran expanded its involvement in the country.  The Hashd al-Shaabi in Iraq was the result of the American invasion, occupation, and destruction of the Iraqi state and society.  In Yemen, the Houthis were the product of a civil war that long pre-dated any Iranian involvement.  If the Saudis want to expand the scope of destruction in the Middle East by becoming directly involved in the various conflicts wracking the region, then they will only serve Iran's interests in the long-term. Indeed, that's the difference between a fabricated client state and a nation state: in Riyadh, they are only thinking about their own immediate survival; in Tehran, they are thinking far into the future, just as they are looking far into the past."

I think the main problem Saudi Arabia has with Iran is that it is A. a real nation state with a consolidated national army and B. a populist regime which, as you say, is not afraid of mobilising people. In Saudi Arabia however, no matter which group is mobilised (Shia, Sunni, poor, immigrant, tribes) they would immediately pose a threat to the cohesion of the regime. Its army might have tons of guns but it has no allegiance to the monarchy or the Saudi nation. This also explains why this expensive army has not been in any real wars since it was established."

Lebanon has been limping along since the civil war and the investments in the economy and infrastructure of the nation comes from Lebanese and Arab businessmen. Iran only invests in weapons to Hizbollah. Their ally the Iraqi government has managed in a decade to destroy the fabric of the nation and basically turn a once promising Iraq into a failed state. While their ally in Syria is fighting for survival and his options are either fight until he dies or agree to a political solution where he and the old guard will probably live the rest of their days in exile in Moscow or Tehran. And both these allies are fighting a terrorist organisation that we have never seen its like before. The Houthis are not as powerful as they seem, once Ali Abdullah Saleh withdrew the republican guard loyal to him from Aden, thus leaving the Houthis alone, it fell in the hands of the resistance in less than a day. And day by day it looks like South Yemen wants to secede from the north, thus further weakening Iran's allies in Yemen. And the nuclear deal actually dashed Iran's dream of a bomb after making concessions to the P5+1. From where I'm standing it looks pretty good for the U.S., Saudi and Israel.

And I think it's important to title things as such. Whether it be Southern Front, Hezbollah, Da3sh, the Syrian government, or the YPG. Targeting civilians as a war aim with the intention of killing them, is to me, a massacre when it results in lives lost.  And in this video there are considerable lives lost by way of bombing.

syriancivilwar,3dm73g,LiesAboutKnowingYou,38,Fri Jul 17 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"Eid Mubarak everyone!  I've still got about 12 hours to go (slightly less) until breaking the fast for the last time, but I figure now is as good a time as any to summarize my experience. As many of you know, especially those in chat who had to put up with my ""Ugh, I'm hungry/I have heartburn/I feel sick"" nonsense, I've been participating, as a non-Muslim, in Ramadan this year. For a multitude of reasons.  A few observations. This was a lot harder than I initially anticipated it to be, but for all the wrong reasons. Physically abstaining from food was not all that difficult after the first few days. Not having coffee when I got up in the morning (after going back to bad after suhoor) was devastating and I never really even thought of myself as a coffee person. It wasn't even the caffeine withdrawal just messing up my morning routine.  I've never been a breakfast person, I just kind of snack lightly over the morning usually. Getting up at 430ish and forcing myself to eat a yogurt or something and slam a liter of water wasn't pleasant. I didn't enjoy it at all. And my poor wife has gotten really sick of the alarm going off at that hour.  I never realized just how many times a day I go into the kitchen to get something to eat or even just to see what food I have. It really makes me aware of just how fortunate I am to live somewhere where I can literally just go stare at my food and see if there's something attractive enough for me to eat, not because I need to eat to survive but because I'm so bored I want to eat something. That was fairly humbling, especially when I saw the images of Syrians fasting in the extreme heat, carrying on with their daily routines.  As a non-religious person, I chose not to actually exercise salat. I thought it would be disrespectful and wouldn't really have any meaning. Instead, I decided to spend 30 minutes a day learning something new about either Islam or Arabic culture (my career and educational focus). A few things I thought I knew about that it turns I didn't, was the names and purpose of the various daily prayers, the importance of colors and flags in Islamic history, how diverse the ""Wahhabi/Salafi"" spectrum is from near-Amish level non-political participant to suicide bomber, what differentiates the various Shi'a sects from each other, and a whole host of other things.  I had to give up exercise for the month. I was swimming (keeping my head above water, which really kinda sucks) and even that was wearing me out, so the wife and I began doing long walks in the early morning so I wouldn't totally atrophy, but holy shit was I exhausted trying to do anything beyond that. I couldn't imagine doing Ramadan while working any sort of physical job. Not only is it exhausting, but by about noon-ish I get this kinda dazed ""Ramadan head"" where I can't really focus well.  I think my last observation is that this month has given me a new found respect not just for the Muslims and the hardships they endure for their faith during Ramadan, but for anyone who fasts to find introspection. I come from a Christian family and both my parents are seminary educated, so fasting was a fairly common thing growing up, especially when there was a difficult decision to make or either of them was struggling with some ""sin"". I always thought it was stupid to deprive yourself of food and water growing up. But now I sort of understand. There is a very real introspection that comes from ""Ugh, I'm so hungry... oh yeah, I'm hungry for a reason."" I don't pray, so I didn't have that outlet, but it definitely helped me become hyper focused on whatever I was doing, and to be extra thankful for the opportunities in my life and the good things I have good things I have going on for myself.  I didn't make it 100%, I slipped up and drank a Red Bull (and in my reading that day learned as long as it was a mistake it doesn't count as breaking the fast), and I got really sick at the beginning and about a week into it I had to eat mid-day once or my wife was gonna make call it quits. Two more times after that I broke fast about 15 minutes early because we were out to eat and with friends and I felt embarrassed or awkward. Not really a good excuse, but it is what it is. I definitely feel for Muslims who live in the West and have to spend an entire month avoiding barbecues and invites to friends houses. I went to a 4th of July barbecue and it was utter torture.  Thanks to all of you who offered advice and suggestions. This was a really interesting experience for me. I will never do it again, but I'm glad I tried this out.  Edit: I forgot to include the link! I promised to donate whatever I anticipated saving from what I would have spent on lunch, snacks, coffee each day. We figured it out to be roughly $7.50 a day between lunch and coffee (I pack a lunch). So that times 30 is what we'll be donating. My personal charity of choice is Doctors Without Borders but I would encourage any of you with extra money in your pockets to consider any charity that works with war torn countries as a worth recipient of your extra cash."

About two years ago, I worked construction, and let me tell you guys, fasting while working labour for highways for 14-15 hours is something else man, like God is my witness, working labour in the hot sun for 14 hours without any intake for a month is the toughest thing that I have done!  I lost 10 kilos when the month was done, still worth it though.  But nowadays with my office job and a bit of summer school, fasting was rather easy, the only tough part was sleep. I slept after Fajr, only to wake up after 3 hours and have a start to the day, sleep was brutal during Ramadan, and at the beginning I suffer from low energy, but yeah, after 3-4, it is like a normal routine.  The best thing about Ramadan are the odd-nights, ''for it is better than a thousand nights''; Surah al-Qadr which is the 97th chapter clearly states the importance, so it is amazing to see a whole sincere congregation praying the night away with you, the sense of solidarity of seeing human folk come and pray in vast numbers before a God is one of a kind.  Then the Eid Salah, you go to the Masjid, everyone's happy, smiles all around, I mean: ''WE DID IT!'', that accomplishment is too much, and the Eid sermon is the cherry on top.  LAKY I would say go and check out the Eid Salah, it'll be worth it, as a final thing.  Anyways, yes Ramadan has a lot of challenges, and offers a different experiences in a multitude of ways, and this was me going off-tangent and discussing what came to my mind for the month."

A non-Muslim observing Ramadan offers a very unique perspective and I think it would make it easier for other non-Muslims to understand what observing Ramadan and the fast means for people who do it, since your reasons for doing so aren't firstly predicated on faith -- a starting point that unfortunately causes many young Western atheists, for example, to immediately discount everything in the process that follows -- but on respect for others and a desire to empathize with them."

I curse because it's part of my manner of speech not necessarily out of hatred or anger.  The anger part was really hard and also a lot harder to quantify. Did I really get mad at that guy or was I just frustrated at the environment. I did my best not to SHOW anger, which involved me taking the metro a lot more (instead of driving which really gets me heated). I'll admit I was a bit of a failure here as there are plenty of instances of me on the subreddit being fairly angry, so I'll consider this a wash.  As it turns out I'm very happily married and I really didn't find the avoiding lust thing to be difficult. I will say my wife was less than pleased to hear ""Sorry love, I can't right now, I'm still fasting"" when she tried to start intimacy.

syriancivilwar,3dm73g,gwely,2,Fri Jul 17 12:58:15 2015 UTC,I thought it was used as such?
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,Dutchbag1402,5,Fri Jul 17 13:19:16 2015 UTC,"Do members of Daesh use ""Daesh"", though? I have never seen them use it before. They usually say ""Dawlah al-Islamiyya"", no?"
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,Pointwest418,5,Fri Jul 17 13:29:53 2015 UTC,It's used as such in English but it's just Arabic for ISIL.
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,I_lost_track,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:44:54 2015 UTC,That's what they are called in Arabic
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,LiesAboutKnowingYou,-3,Fri Jul 17 15:26:30 2015 UTC,and negro is black in Spanish
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,I_lost_track,9,Fri Jul 17 15:54:22 2015 UTC,"That's not just a silly argument, it's a stupid argument. Negro has centuries of ill-meaning and degradation behind it. Da3sh is literally just a few years old as an acronym and is a literal translation of the name the GROUP SELECTED FOR THEMSELVES. At no point did black people forced to leave their homes and move to America, Europe, South America (etc etc) suddenly decide ""Hey guys, let's pick a name for ourselves that is solely predicated on what our skin color is. And then demand everyone call us that.""  Da3sh has had SIX different names since 1999.  Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (JTJ) before they joined al-Qaeda. Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn (TQJBR) after joining al-Qaeda. Shortened (informally) to al-Qaeda f'al-Iraq. Changed to Dawlat al-Islamiyah f'al-Iraq. Changed to Dawlat al-Islamiyah f'al-Iraq w'al-Sham. Changed to Dawlat al-Islamiyah.  But you compare it to racism to call them by one name or another? In their present form, they are a terrorism sub-state structure that exists as a coherent entity that controls serious territory and is geographically connected to each other in both Iraq and Syria. Which makes ISIL/Da3sh the most accurate title for them and the one which gained the most traction in the Western and Arabic media. Such a term is entirely appropriate for them as it describes accurately what they are or what they hope to be."
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,LiesAboutKnowingYou,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:35:31 2015 UTC,"My point is that they simply hate being called like that , HAMAS is an acronym also , they dont mind calling them that , i think it is much more professional to call them by the name that they call themselves  ,  case in point you can call them Shitheads , and i wouldnt mind , but calling them Daesh is like calling them ""the terrorists"" , you are technichally correct but if it is less professional for an academic or a journalist , to be able to analyse their actions impartially and without prejudice"
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,I_lost_track,8,Fri Jul 17 16:41:49 2015 UTC,"This is not an academic forum and we are not restricted to such terminology. Just as it would not be inappropriate to refer to the DPRK as North Korea as that's the most commonly accepted nomenclature for them, even in an academic context, there is nothing degrading or insulting about using the very name they selected for themselves (ISIL/داعش). You are being absurdly pedantic as though we're supposed to cater to the demands of a terror org every time they change their name. The name that has purchasing power and recognition is ISIL/ISIS/Da3sh."
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,Ijfjfjfbakuwase,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"like i said you can call them whatever ,the number one reason they hate da3sh btw while HAMAS doesnt is because it is musically unpleasant , as you are learning Arabic ,to understand this  i highly recommend this video by a very popular presenter in the Arab world : https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=5epmAcLmImw#t=584"
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,Herefordiscussion2,-2,Fri Jul 17 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on that. The only thing I am curious about is how can you call them ISIS (Iraq, Syria) when they control territory in Libya, Nigeria, and other places through groups that have declared their allegiance. Wouldn't that make the name ISIS and ISIL an inaccurate representation of the situation?   Edit: What about my question is making you guys down vote me? I'm just interested in learning."
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,Leadback,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:14 2015 UTC,"I don't call them Islamic state as it attributes the attribute of Islam to them. Though I do call them daesh or Isis even though these acronyms imply ""dawla islamiyya / Islamic state"", but that is for recognition purposes only, not to attribute Islam to them. Calling them by the non-acronymized name cuts it too close to attributing islam to them, for me."
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,EWbroWTF,3,Fri Jul 17 18:13:44 2015 UTC,"I get that, but I call them that because of the role Islam plays in their ideology. Not because I think Islam is inherently violent."
syriancivilwar,3dm73g,hawksfan222,2,Fri Jul 17 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"I call them IS or Islamic State unless I am referring to specific military operations in Syria or Iraq, so if I am talking about Taqba I'd call them ""ISIS"", but if I was talking about Camp Speicher I'd say ""ISIL"", and if I was just referring to the organization headed by al-Baghdadi I'd say ""Islamic State""   No real specific reasons why I do this it just sounds better to me personally. I guess ""Da3sh"" just sounds weird to me given that it is not and English acronym."

syriancivilwar,3dm73g,xXx_AboveLegit_xXx,2,Fri Jul 17 15:57:58 2015 UTC,Super bummed that the holy month of Ramadan is going to be over - it flew by. I slept a lot and worked out a lot and didn't work too much lol. Drove 45 miles to the mosque every day for iftar and lectures about the Prophet Muhammad and his life and history (If any of you guys are interested I can send you guys links). The lectures really helped me see the real importance behind the Prophet and the movement of Islam and how it manifested from hundreds of years before the Prophet was even born. Being Shia - we love the Prophet more than anything but I had never heard this side of history before and it really clarified a lot of the events which took place even after his death and up until now. Honestly had an amazing month and I'm sad that it's over but now I have to get back to work and back into being active and productive.

I.e. - members of the Tunisian government who don't eat pork or drink alcohol, that is because that is sharia.. Restricting sharia to the viewpoint of one political party doesn't do sharia justice nor actually implement sharia, and in practice causes huge detriments to sharia."

Israel is a nation that has ethnically cleansed an entire Arab nation and stolen their homes. Occupied them for 60 years+, oppressed them and commit various horrible deeds.  In the UK where I also live Israel is seen as a normal country. That is because deep down in the heart of British and other western people we value the life of an Israeli more than a thousand dead Arabs and downplay all the evil things Israel does. Like invade Lebanon during the world cup and slaughter thousands of people in a single weekend. The very action that created Hezbollah.  In Tunisia and in most Arab countries they don't. Visiting Israel is like visiting Nazi Germany, Serbia under Milosevic or Stalin's USSR."

Religious courts that exercise specialized jurisdiction are divided into shari‘a courts, doctrinal courts, and spiritual courts. They hear personal status law cases only. Shari‘a courts regulate disputes among Syrian Muslims, whereas doctrinal courts are empowered to guarantee the personal status decisions of members of the Druze cult. Spiritual courts can also settle personal status matters for Jewish, Christian and other non-Muslim groups.[23] Decisions of all of the religious courts may be appealed to the canonical and spiritual divisions of the Court of Cassation.[24]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Syria   Article 3 of the 1973 Syrian constitution declares Islamic jurisprudence one of Syria's main sources of legislation.[141] The Personal Status Law 59 of 1953 (amended by Law 34 of 1975) is essentially a codified Sharia law.[142] The Code of Personal Status is applied to Muslims by Sharia courts.[143] In Sharia courts, a woman's testimony is worth only half of a man's.[144]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_of_sharia_law_by_country  Thanks for the downvote though, hope you learned something new today."

I honestly have no words, other than, we will never accept going back to those days of darkness again. I swear on everything that is holy and all that I believe in, You will literally have to massacre us by our thousands and tens of thousands before we ever accept discriminatory rules like the Jizya again, and we definitely won't convert. And that's not me saying we will use violence, no we will peacefully refuse to submit to second-class citizenship, and if you truly feel that is a penalty worth death, so be it.   Just for all the westerners here who don't know, what the people who are justifying Jizya in this thread haven't told you, is that I and those like me, would have to either pay the jizya, convert to Islam, or die. These people would literally massacre me and all of my people when we rightfully refuse to submit to a system of unjust laws, which make us second class citizens.  The fact that I have to debate, whether or not, I a citizen of my country, deserve to be treated equally under the Law and with respect that we deserve as human beings, honestly makes me sad. To everyone who tried to justify imposing this system upon us, I want you to know that we perceive you in the same way a black man would perceive the KKK in the 1920's.   Do you truly despise us so much, that you cannot accept us as your equals? And before you say you don't despise us, know that if you have to define our citizenship in terms of ""Protected people"" or ""special rights"" or anything other than full equality before the law, you may as well spit on our faces and stab us in the back, because the effect will be the same to us.   It hurts man, to see so many people would do this to us, its like the ultimate betrayal. Despite the fact that we have been there with you in happiness and sadness, victory and defeat, from the banks of the Sinai to shores of Yemen, to the protests against the British in the 1920's, from our achievements to our humiliations, and its all meaningless to you. Well I hope your happy, we've been leaving the middle east for a long time now, soon your dream of a pure middle east, free of us will come true."

I could mention the fact that, till this day, My community in Egypt has to literally get a signed decree from the president from the country every time we want to either build or repair a church, or governor’s permission to renovate even the bathroom in an already-built church, while our Muslim neighbors have no such restriction, and can build mosques freely.  I could mention the fact that the payment for the church has to come out of our own pockets, while the Mosque receives generous state funds.   I could mention the fact that coptics are not allowed to attend Al-Ahzar university, despite the fact that they're tax dollars subsidize it.  I could mention the fact that my Egyptian national ID card states my religion, helping to ensure that we are disenfranchised and face institutional discrimination.  I could mention the fact that converting to Islam entails no legal penalties, while a Muslim converting to Christianity in Egypt faces up to 15 years in prison.  I could mention the fact that a muslim man may marry a christian woman, but it is illegal for a christian man to marry a muslim woman.  I could mention the sectarian attacks that happen in Egypt, both now and historically, and how the government never seems able to punish the perpetrators.  I could mention that fact, that we are institutionally excluded from certain jobs, whether that be a Gynecologist for morality reasons, or a General for ""security"" reasons.   These things exist now, let alone the laws of Jizya and Dhimmi rules you would seek to impose upon us, don't try to patronize me by telling me I only know superficial elements of sharia, you literally know nothing of us and how we feel about your claim that these laws treat us fairly.

One of the pillars in Western thought and our liberal-democratic model of society is protection against the tyranny of the majority. While a simple version of democracy is that what the majority wants is what is right, the Western model of democracy takes into account the need to protect minorities who might suffer from discriminatory policies that the majority wants enacted.  As such a Sharia system is completely unacceptable in Western thought as it would subject non-Muslims and secular Muslims to Sharia law, which is inherently discriminatory towards them (and let's not forget the women and sexual minorities either).  The Western model of democracy is very focused on the rights of the individual (since all men are created equal and all that jazz), and as such everyone has to be equal before the law regardless of what religion one believes in (or does not believe in).  Other than that the punishments that are to be meted out according to sharia law are simply barbaric and very much against the ban on 'cruel and unusual punishment' that you might remember is quite essential to especially Anglo-American law, but also Western law in general."

syriancivilwar,3dm8dn,Seefor,3,Fri Jul 17 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"Isn't Jizya a pretty basic thing about Sharia?   Uh, no this was a contemporary solution a few hindered years ago which did a few things. 1.) non-Muslims payed the same tax that Muslims payed for zakat and 2.) when conscription used to be a thing non-Muslims were exempt from this, in return for not being conscripted they payed a tax. In my countr everyone is conscripted, regardless of religion, so jizya doesn't apply. Even though we still pay the zakat tax, non-Muslims don't have to pay it because they are conscripted.  Also, if the state chooses a voulenteer army (the best option IMO) jizya also vanishes.    And could you explain the rights of women under Sharia? Would they be comparable to the ones enjoyed by women in my country, for example?   generally yes, certain occupations like prostitution are obviously off limits, but a woman can be or do anything she wants. The case of a woman's testimony being half than a man's by default is something that so often brought up. This is scrictly the case in business transaction cases, in all other judicial cases two wires see are required regardless of gender. There are cases in which that a woman's testimony would override that of a man's. The Quran sets these defaults because even today women aren't at the forefront of business and don't have the experience men have, similarly there are fields where men have little to no experience that women have. However these are just defaults , obviously women who have experience in the field wouldhave their testimonies looked more favorably by the judge than men. Like I said, these are defaults. Things must be done on a case by case baisis.   If you want I can give you a more detailed write up of common misconceptions of gender inequality in shariat and how things actually work."

Why is women's testimony counted as less than a man's? Muhammad said it should be.   The problems that Islamic law brings are explicitly and clearly rooted in Islam's teachings. You have to be either a revisionist or blind to say that's not the case.

syriancivilwar,3dm8dn,Xray330,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"that fight against the state, no just your run of the mill atheists of today.   Nothing specifies any requirement of fighting against the state. Bukhari 9:84:57 essentially directly refutes what you’re saying: ‘Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to 'Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn 'Abbas who said, ‘If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah's Apostle forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire).' I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Apostle, 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'’”  Also Bukhari 9:83:17 - “Allah's Apostle said, ‘The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims.’”  As well as Muslim 16:4152 - “'Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: It is not permissible to take the life of a Muslim who bears testimony (to the fact that there is no god but Allah, and I am the Messenger of Allah, but in one of the three cases: the married adulterer, a life for life, and the deserter of his Din (Islam)…”  Its also reported in Abu Dawud 39:4487 - “I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) say: It is not lawful to kill a man who is a Muslim except for one of the three reasons: Kufr (disbelief) after accepting Islam, fornication after marriage, or wrongfully killing someone, for which he may be killed.”  And in the Koran it says if someone changes their mind about Muhammad they must either be banished or killed (this is a bit more lenient than what’s reported in the Hadith because the banishment part was later abrogated, see here). It says of those who do so in Koran 4:89- “take not from among them friends until they flee (their homes)…if they turn back, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them…”.  So in every major collection of Hadith and the Koran itself it says to punish apostates, with no mention of them fighting against the state.    polygamy was already widespread even before Muhammad's time   So was idolatry and he had no problem banning that. The fact he permitted and practiced polygamy shows that it has his explicit approval.   rich people would marry marry literally more than 10 women   Such as Muhammad having eleven wives.   sleep with her once every month, and leave   Muhammad allowed this too. Bukhari 7:62:13 reports: “We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Apostle and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, ‘Shall we get ourselves castrated?’ He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract…”  Sunnis and Shiites disagree about whether that’s still permissible, but the fact is that Muhammad approved of temporary arrangements such as you condemn.    Islam restricted it to only 4   But of course the one giving that restriction helped himself to three times that many women.   and even then, discouraged it.   How so?"
syriancivilwar,3dm8dn,Zeta_Metroid,0,Fri Jul 17 16:42:36 2015 UTC,"that fight against the state, no just your run of the mill atheists of today.   That's your interpenetration. You have no authority to disregard another's religious views, since the religious views people hold are themselves the standard by which they tend to judge. There is no objective standard in religious belief.   How do two believers, with different presuppositions, within the same religious tradition, reading Mohammad's words, ""Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him."", resolve their different interpenetration of that statement. It's not a trivial problem; one will go out and enslave and kill, the other won't and they'll both go around in circles accusing each other of ignorance or perhaps apostasy, which would itself be just another thing based on their religious stance, unfounded in anything other than faith-based presuppositions...    polygamy was already widespread even before Muhammad's time, rich people would marry marry literally more than 10 women, sleep with her once every month, and leave, Islam restricted it to only 4, and even then, discouraged it.   He asked ""why do they allow"", not what your personal Islamic view of it is. The fact that something has existed before Mohammad had no bearing on the divine authority Muslims have been able to derive from Mohammad's stance on it since. The problem is the attitude: that because it's religiously dictated, according to their convictions and interpretation, it means they have to follow it. Fundamentalists will go to the fundamentals and the fundamentals don't care much about what was widespread before Mohammad's time, and they have no conditions specified in the books (like ""don't kill apostates 1400 years after Mohammad dies""). The fundamentals are what Mohammad said and did. The connection between belief in the sacred texts is clear."

No one is pressuring to let the opposition escape out of nice-ness or humanitarian concerns. It is done as a strategic measure to prevent them from being forced against a wall where they will choose to fight much harder than when there is a way for them to escape. It's an intentional tactic. It's not a bad one, provided there are forces in the corridor through which they intend to escape who can exploit their retreat and capture/kill many of them. Where the SAA fucks up is that they simply don't exploit the retreat, either through incompetence or exhaustion.  In this instance, it appears that they've prepared a tighter noose and are more interested in preventing a general breakout or large scale retreat."
syriancivilwar,3dlsng,LiesAboutKnowingYou,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:53:22 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the actions the SAA takes voluntarily. I mean the reaction from world bodies such as the UN, Red Cross/Crescent, western media and Western governments. When rebels lose they always complain about a ""massacre of civilians"" and people take it seriously. Nobody takes it serious when hundreds of soldiers and pro-government civilians get killed.  Take for example Qusayr. When that town was close to falling there was real pressure to allow the rebels to escape. The rebels took advantage of this by releasing a video of wounded men in a makeshift hospital. The Guardian joined in this. A paper that said nothing when few months earlier 200 trapped police officers were slaughtered or the fact that the Christian and Shia communities in Qusayr had to flee to Lebanon to escape death. Those police officers never commited any of the grave sectarian and criminal crimes done by rebels and never had months of forewarning to escape. Yet the safety of rebels was eventually arranged through a Lebanese politician and Hezbollah.  The worst case was in Homs.   The government was forced into allowing a humanitarian convoy in Homs. At that time a couple of rebels who fought decided to take advantage of the fact that civilians were allowed to leave. The UN, Red Cross, the media and Western government put pressure to make sure that they weren't harmed. They wouldn't even let the Army interview them in peace without making sure that they weren't harmed.  A few months later when Homs was really collapsing the pressure on to allow the rebels to leave for the northern pocket was even more intense. They ended up getting a damned bus journey. They gave a bus journey to terrorists who just a few days earlier were car bombing Alawite civilians. Who had kidnapped hundreds of Alawites and never identified where their bodies were. Who were fighting in neighbourhood where they kicked the Christian and Alawites out.  They seriously thought at one point that if they killed enough Alawite civilians the Army would stop attacking them. Then they were complaining later that the NDF were the ones that were gunning the hardest for a military solution. The fact that the soldiers and militia of Homs wanted to finish the terrorists off was made to look as if it was bad.  The hypocrisy that is seen is showed even today where people are complaining that the government didn't do a deal with the rebels of Zabadani. Honestly the fault lies with the Syrian government. Reducing diplomatic pressure is one thing but creating a precedent that rebels can escape if things get to hard is another."

syriancivilwar,3dlfmd,PeeDeeFlow,3,Fri Jul 17 11:49:03 2015 UTC,Acceptance of Alawis as Muslim and Sunni or Shi'a has always been political and for the sake of unity. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Husseini passed a fatwa declaring them Muslim in the 30's. Sadr during the Lebanese Civil War passed a fatwa declaring them such as well. Khomeini did as well. This Alawi-12er thing is a recent thing. Outside of Ismailis who were also viewed as Heretics by Zaidis and 12ers no one considered them Muslim.  Same goes for Zaidi-12er relations.

If you're referring to Iraq then according to Iraq Body Count the US-led coalition was directly responsible for 14,372 deaths - including combatants. The rest of the between 141,422 – 160,257 killed as a result of the invasion of Iraq were Muslims killing Muslims. Was it a result of the chaos brought about by the American invasion? Yes. But they were not killed by the Americans. And Bashar has long ago exceeded killing 14,372 Muslims.   The Americans are not the ones who are the most dangerous to Muslims. Other Muslims are."

According to Jonathan Steele, writing in The Guardian, IBC ""is widely considered as the most reliable database of Iraqi civilian deaths""   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Body_Count_project  How many do you think the Americans have killed?

It has been the official policy of the Department of Defense for over 50 years that we do not keep track of the number of people killed in combat who are not Americans.

It's pretty simple. The behavior of extremist Muslims has engendered a reaction from the West and you're now trying to blame your own behavior (as usual) on others.  Muslims think we help Daesh because you thrive on conspiracy theories. It's the way you rationalize not being able to defeat Daesh. A friend of mine was a Peace Corps volunteer in Jordan many years ago. When an irrigation pipe broke the locals claimed Mossad and the Jews broke the pipe in this tiny farming village to stop them from growing wheat. This is the problem with you people. Rather than say ""the pipe broke because it was a shitty pipe"" you blame it on Jews."

And that was almost 10 years ago.  The Iraq invasion was a humanitarian disaster. It will be generations in the middle east before the memory of the suffering we caused starts to fade in that region, and it's important we don't minimize or forget what we've done."

Are you trying to suggest that the deaths stemming from Al Qaeda in Iraq blowing up Shi'ite mosques and neighborhoods is somehow the coalition's fault?  I'm not saying there's no responsibility, but you have to consider it in context. The coalition failing to adequately protect civilians is a much different proposition from ""the coalition directly killed 650,000 people"".

syriancivilwar,3dlsf7,mattdent54,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:18:27 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how people perceive things based on their age. Backstory: I recently met a group of Iraqi exchange students. They're all college age, roughly 19-21. So for many of them, they knew very little of pre-invasion Iraq. Very little of the early occupation. Most people don't really notice world events, or even normal national events, until a later age. I just thought it was really interesting to think about how they perceived everything versus someone in Iraq who was older versus another who is older still and so on.   In no way does a young or old age discount your opinions or mine. I think it does shade it in a certain light. Just as my age (28) affects how I perceived 9/11 and looking back on the time before it. Same with Iraq war. I imagine my perceptions would've been different had I been older or younger"
syriancivilwar,3dlsf7,fauz87,-2,Fri Jul 17 14:36:28 2015 UTC,Arabs are very happy with the U.S. Jordan and Egypt receive millions in military aid. Saudis gets to fund Wahhabism throughout the world. Qatar gets free pass to fund NUSRA in Syria.  Iraq civilians on the other hand has trouble comprehending why the U.S is perfectly Ok with Takfirism/Wahabism and actually defends the one country that is primarily responsible for religious hatred against Iraqi Shias.

syriancivilwar,3dlsf7,username_my,-17,Fri Jul 17 17:42:22 2015 UTC,probably this is true. because america is scared of iran very much. and also saudi and israel and other.  this is also why they do not help free army in sorya but give help and word to terorists who want to fight iran in all of sham.
syriancivilwar,3dlsf7,tawi13,8,Fri Jul 17 15:02:28 2015 UTC,"probably this is true.   Are you kidding me? America's entire policy over the last couple of years has been a deliberate shift towards under-the-table cooperation with Iran when possible.   And the US is not ""scared"" of Iran. At all. Iran poses no threat to the United States. It might pose a threat to SA or Israel, and the US is having a hard time balancing all these competing interests, but it is not in the US's interest to attack or even undermine Iran."

syriancivilwar,3dlsf7,pjakubo86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:51:43 2015 UTC,"The contras had a reputation for killing nurses and teachers sent to rural areas, as the socialist FSLN government wanted every Nicaraguan to receive education & healthcare. They were vile and corrupt, and comprised largely of Somoza loyalists, who happened to be acquitted of criminal charges by the mostly young (& inexperienced) law graduates/students in the FSLN. The Sandinistas were extremely popular, and received 67% of votes in the 1984 elections, validated by multiple international observers (all US allied), but Reagan administration decided it was rigged. The contras assassinated 50 FSLN candidates in 1989 alone, while the FSLN government was amnestying contra prisoners in hopes of reconciliation/peace. In 1989, US pledged to maintain the embargo against Nicaragua unless Violeta Chamorro (who was bankrolled by US) won. The US funded the contras so heavily that people voted against them in 1990 just to end the bloodshed.     After the war, a survey was taken of voters: 75.6% agreed that if the Sandinistas had won, the war would never have ended. 91.8% of those who voted for the UNO agreed with this. (From wikipedia)   You see, the US does what the US wants. They don't care about the moral/humanitarian implications of their actions, human rights or people's right to self-determination or ""liberty"" or whatever. While this particular incident might be false, nothing in US's history suggests they won't go as far as to support IS."

If you examine Iran-Contra affair, you'll see that US sold weapons to Islamic Republic of Iran, which it publicly opposed, and went as far as providing Saddam with chemical weapons, intel, funding and arms, and used that money + cocaine money to fund the contras in Nicaragua. Also, Israel, IRI's arch-nemesis, acted as a mediator of sorts, shipping weapons through Ghorbanifar to Iran.  Iran-Contra was bizzare when it came out. The Boland Amendment limited US govt support to the contras. So, Reagan used cocaine and Irangate funds to fund them."

syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,nantenknight,10,Thu Jul 16 18:15:48 2015 UTC,when will the SAA finally be able to push back the push for HOMS?   Homs is not a priority right now. It's just a bunch of villages after all.
syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,ablaaa,3,Thu Jul 16 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe I have it wrong, but when I look at the map I see ISIS utilizing a huge push for the dead center of SAA's land...and they have control of a ton of cities...huge salient."
syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,nantenknight,10,Thu Jul 16 18:19:21 2015 UTC,Daesh will not take Homs as it is pretty heavily fortified. Right now the main objective besides defending DeZ & Hasakah is to recapture Palmyra as it's a crucial supply point. Once that happens than there could be more offenses into Daesh held Syrian territory.
syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,TanDeng,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"They don't need to take Homs to split the regime into two. All they need to do is to cut the main highway at any point. And there is a lot of rural land IS can exploit between Homs and Damascus. It wouldn't be an easy task for them to split Government-held Syria, but it's far from impossible. And chances are that cutting the territory in two would force the Government to contract and possible get them to withdraw from all of their rural outposts and maybe Aleppo."
syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,Balak_Jewboma,9,Fri Jul 17 08:13:46 2015 UTC,"We hear daily reports about people crossing the Turkish border, some go through, some get busted, usually in groups of 3-12 or so. There are the ones we hear about, imagine all the ones which cross without anyone anywhere noticing, it has to be the huge majority.   If 60 people cross a day, that's 420 a week, rarely do we have weeks where 420 ISIS members die, that's how they manage. Recruitment is booming and hasn't shown any signs of slowing down.  Obviously these are estimates, it could be a bit more or less but I'd say it's in this area. Wanna finish ISIS off? The ones fighting them need to find a way to consistently kill 2000 ISIS members a month.  I doubt we've been near that."
syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,umakemefunny,2,Thu Jul 16 20:45:49 2015 UTC,How does Daesh have the weapons and ammunition let alone food and medicine to arm and feed 420 new recruits per day? I am not saying they lack for manpower but what about the war materiel to properly utilize them?

syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,WendellSchadenfreude,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:41:32 2015 UTC,There are plenty of weapons floating around in the region. Retreating SAA troops often leave stockpiles behind when Daesh rushes their base.

syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,umakemefunny,7,Fri Jul 17 12:32:02 2015 UTC,So is the SAA just allowing YPG to take all the territory? Are they essentially working together or just ceding what they can't control? What type of agreement is in place and does the SAA intend to ever take it back?
syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,mattdent54,11,Thu Jul 16 20:31:23 2015 UTC,SAA said to be ceeding rural land to YPG and remaining in the inner-city areas.

syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,LockedOnTarget,2,Thu Jul 16 20:46:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed, an alliance between Assad and the Kurds against IS could have a major impact on the dynamics of the war, not just in Hassakah.  It would have reverberating effects across Syria and the rest of the region. As long as Assad is only hesitatingly inching his way towards this position, pushed by events and his own weakness, he would not be able to fully utilise this resource, because it is unconvincing for the Kurds. But the question is whether the different powers are willing to accept the democratic institutions of the Kurds and whether they are willing to concede the same rights to Kurds in Iraq, Iran and Turkey."

syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,FoolEskimo,20,Thu Jul 16 23:07:57 2015 UTC,"The SAA is only co-operating with the Kurds because they're weak right now. If they ever successfully retook the country (which is impossible for them now), then they'd immediately stab the Kurds in the back. They'd look weak if they made any de facto concessions to other parties, and dictators need to look strong for their populace. It's Autocracy 101."

They already have considerable respect as fighters. Neither the government of Syria, or the FSA would I believe, consider outright rejecting the Kurdish aspirations for statehood with overt military force knowing that would mean having to deal with the proven forces of the YPG/J."
syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,footballma56,2,Thu Jul 16 21:51:41 2015 UTC,Agreed. I wonder how long their airforce would stick around after daesh is gone. Do you think the USAF would back them for statehood and help against other rebel groups? Even the SAA?

syriancivilwar,3dj4pq,sylezjusz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:49:39 2015 UTC,"No, I do not foresee any potential involvement of the USAF or any other Western Coalition forces in attempting to hand an independent nation to the Kurds. However I also do not believe any of the potential victorious factions of this civil war will have the means to completely turn the Kurds away from the negotiating table. Even if the SAA wins this war their airpower alone will not be enough to return the Kurdish fighters to the status of second class citizens"

You can think what you want, i've looked up names of Iranina proxy terrorists that killed Americans, iraqi security forces, and plenty of civilians. They ran to Iran after the awakening happened, and now they are back infesting the PMUs.  Maybe you don't care that the PMUs are full of Iranina proxies, but i do. My good friend was killed by a Iranian proxy terrorist back in 2006, so i've kept my eye on this war and the region since then."

syriancivilwar,3djp92,defend435,7,Fri Jul 17 02:29:17 2015 UTC,"Iran's support for Syria is mostly ideological with few tangible benefits.   Syria was the only country that supported Iran during the 1980-1988 Iraq invasion which cost over a million Iranian lives and saw the use of chemical weapons against Iranians and Iraqi Kurds. All current Iranian policy makers are veterans of that war, or were affected by it in some way.   Furthermore, Iran has been under extreme sanctions which essentially amount to a naval blockade on the country (Iranians have been dying from medicine shortages, civilian airliners crashing from inability to import spare parts, ect).   How is bankrolling Syria under these conditions for the benefit of Iran? You can say it is to maintain supply routes to Hezbollah, but that is not entirely true. Iran doesn't need a completely intact Syrian state to continue supplying it's partners/proxies. It is supporting the Syrian state out of 1) moral debt 2) strategic defense (If Iran can't help the decent Arabs stand their ground, the backwards-ass ones will try to come for Iran)  I'm not saying Iran is a selfless actor. They are playing realpolitik just like everyone else, however your comment (read shitpost) that Syrian institutions primarily function to serve Iran is simplistic and cheap."
syriancivilwar,3djp92,democracy4sale,-3,Fri Jul 17 05:47:59 2015 UTC,All off these thing were true when the war started but now do you really accept that the Syrian government security isn't subject to Iran control. There intelligent agency's head had a big fight because one leader didn't want to be under the controls of Iran. The original post was shit posting too. He always does. If this war ends now with a Assad won't be the master of Syria but only a proxy to Iran. If Syria falls then not only Iran lose a supply route to Hezbolah but also Hezbollah could be threaten. Every Iran and Hezbolah news have stated this before.

syriancivilwar,3dkfxc,HankAuclair,7,Fri Jul 17 00:06:32 2015 UTC,"A former Canadian soldier, shocked by the events unfolding in Syria, decided to leave his country to fight against the Islamic State, despite the great risks he faces.  TVA News had a chance to meet the man who goes by the nom de guerre, Wali, last week, during his final training session before leaving for Syria.  ""I've served for about 12 years. I'm an ex-sniper who's done two tours in Afghanistan. This will be my third combat mission I'll have completed, assuming I'm lucky as I was the last two times.""  ""I'm not a mercenary, I'm a volunteer. So, I'm not being paid. With the money I've saved up to go fight there, I could've afforded more than a few weeks worth of time spent in a 5 star hotel down south (...) instead, I'm using it to go to battle.""  Wali has just left the Canadian Forces. We won't show his face due to the danger it could put him in. The former soldier has said that ISIS offers over $100 000 for captured foreign soldiers.  When asked what it is that's motivating him to go fight, he answered his ""aversion"" towards those fighting for ISIS.  ""They're barbarians. Decapitating people, attacking civilians...don't even get me started on the radical laws they'd like to implement. It's completely inacceptable."" He explained.  The former soldier would equally like to take advantage of his trip to help out the Kurds, with the experience he's acquired over the years.  ""They're capable on the field, but sometimes they lack technical experience: how to make use of their weapons more efficiently, how to carry them, etc. I could bring more to the table.""  Wali's trip should last about two months and a half.  He'd like to come back with a documentary to show viewers exactly what's going on in Syria."

Comme mentor, je peux emmener encore plus que comme combattant.»   I would translate this quote as:   [The Kurds] have experience in the field, but, sometimes, they lack technical experience: how to adjust a weapon in an effective way [i.e. properly zeroing a rifle, adjusting optics for distance and windage, etc.], the ballistics of a weapon, the range* ... As a mentor, I can lead more [effectively] than [I could] as a combatant""   *In this context and word formation, ""la portée"" means ""range"" (i.e. the maximum effective range of a particular rifle, or the range of a target) rather than ""carrying"".

Some of the paramilitary groups in Iraq's Hashd ash-Sha'bi are well-trained and experienced as well, and possess respectable equipment, most notably Badr Organization, Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, and Kata'ib Hizbullah.

I hope that IS will remain in artillery range of T4 so they can continue shelling the airfield. If T4 is unusable as an air field, then the SAA will likely be forced to both contract its territory and their ability to launch terror bombings on cities like Aleppo and Idlib will be crippled. If IS can manage to destroy some of the SyAAF's aircraft, then even better. That's just fewer civilians who will be gored by Assad's bombs in the long-term. I don't support IS, but I wish that T4's capability to be an air base will be damaged or destroyed, and IS just happens to be the group who is near there."

Instead he will have his ""freedom and independence-loving"" friends like Iran and Russia.  As to your whataboutism: what are you trying to say? Yes, the West did support dictatorships before, but why the hell do you feel obliged to support a dictator in this case then, if you condemn their actions? It's nothing more than the typical: ""IRAQ.SYRIA.AFGHANISTAN"" finger-poiting. And if you'd stop saying ""they did it too"" for a second, instead forming an opinion following your moral compass, you'd hopefully understand that there's no objective reason for Westerners to support anyone in this conflict (perhaps except for a few smaller opposition and minority groups). Certainly not Assad."

Yes, like when they were overthrown. Libya would have been in a perpetual state of conflict, and Iraq was already in a perpetual state of conflict.

syriancivilwar,3djf3e,Balak_Jewboma,4,Fri Jul 17 00:11:26 2015 UTC,"It's comparing years/decades of future conflict to indefinite conflict.   I've heard this argument raised before that some side other than the government must prevail, any side and even this will be progressive and positive (despite the actual nature or intent of the victors) because those civilians who have been affected by the counterinsurgency campaign will never accept government rule again. This argument is very illogical and is a classic example of arriving at whatever preconceived conclusion one wishes to arrive at. There's nothing to say after a Syrian victory pockets of insurgency cannot be crushed, opposition to the state can not be driven underground or abroad in its entirety once more, and gradually reconstruction can get underway, the economy and living conditions can improve. There have been plenty of incumbent governments/states in many countries in contemporary history alone who have survived civil wars despite the fact that they went on for years and many civilians perished. And yes, they also used brutal and indiscriminate tactics to combat equally ruthless and determined insurgencies. Algeria is a textbook example, Sri Lanka, etc. In the end the governments did reassert their authority and normalize the post-war situation thereafter.   All sides cause casualties in war so it's ridiculous to suggest that (and it's not just from you as I've heard numerous people repeat it) because one of the many sides has contributed to collateral damage like all the others (yes on a greater scale because simply put it is more powerful, more materially disposed and has more resources to pack an organized punch) that the families or friends of combatants or civilians it has killed will ""not accept"" its victory. That's not how wars work. When they're in the position militarily to re-hoist the national colors, the majority of the populace will unquestionably accept it as long as they can eat. A proud working class loyalist city like Raqqah accepts ISIL's black standard over their heads for the love of God."

It seems like you mistook my point that the Government does not have the military capability to retake the country as the Government being able to retake the entire country and then having to deal with a long-term insurgency. There's a big difference between the two, the what you seem to have gotten from my post is what would essentially be the step after a Government military victory. What I'm saying is that the Government can't even reach that point in the conflict where it just reverts to an insurgency. Many parts of Syria will never see the current Syrian Arab Republic flag raised over them ever again. The SAA just doesn't have the resources, manpower, and tactical competence needed to establish control over much of the country again. They have the equipment, but superior equipment doesn't make a difference if you don't have the men to operate it, the fuel the armored vehicles consume, and the tactical know-how to not utilize them as static pillboxes."

syriancivilwar,3di384,moneymakingmitch23,4,Thu Jul 16 14:14:50 2015 UTC,"You can call it a ""pariah regime"" but this politically loaded insult does nothing to alter the fact that the vast majority of the world's countries - some 200 sovereign states and UN members - never stopped recognizing the Syrian Arab Republic as the government of Syria, the sole and legitimate national authority in the country.  As for Crimea, it was disputed when Russian troops in coordination with the Crimean parliament they backed were occupying the space and pushing the Ukrainian military bases and Ukrainian naval forces out before the actual referendum date. It's since been annexed by Russia as a full Russian federal subject under the protection of the Russian military and Russia's nuclear shield and so any attempt to wrest it back would meet the same level of resistance as an attempt to seize St. Petersburg, Moscow, or Novgorod, and as such, will almost definitely never occur. North Korea unleashing a nuclear barrage on Tokyo is more likely than Ukraine returning Crimea to their state, even after a return to the status quo ante bellum (restoration of a Russian-aligned or at least neutral government like the Party of Regions was)."
syriancivilwar,3di384,WorldsupportsBashar,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:23:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, although this is a caricature of what I said, I follow your general idea. The vast majority only recognize the Syrian government and a slightly smaller majority (I believe it was 100 countries who voted in favor of that U.S.-sponsored UN resolution condemning Russian annexation of former Ukrainian territory) still technically don't recognize that land forcefully changing hands, so the moral of the story is regardless of any international opinion of governments unaffiliated with these separate conflicts, events on the ground are what actually matters and will determine the future."

Russia now has two areas that will never be profitable, they will live off Russian subsidies, like the rest of russia.

syriancivilwar,3di384,Lord_Khamul,-4,Thu Jul 16 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"Well firstly, that is a sign of weakness for any regime. That it is incapably of carrying out its aims.   Secondly, while the whole Ukraine affair was not exactly a success for Russia, geostrategically it was definitely humiliating for the US, because it could not do anything about it. There was no NATO intervention, and although there has been talking about arming the Kiev regime and funding it for a long time not much has actually happened. In that sense MesmerizingMe was trying to say that besides going about his business, defending his interests, Putin is trying to send a message to the US by doing it from Crimea. I don't necessarily agree that Putin thinks like that, but that is what I think MesmerizingMe meant.  Thirdly, yes the US is not best mates with the Assad regime, but it its also clear that it is not interested in overthrowing it. If that was the case, the US supported groups would not complain as much about the lack of proper western support as they do. They might be getting TOW's, but they don't get air support.  The US aim of arming different groups is more in order to be able to manoeuvre a negotiated settlement in the future than to install a completely new regime. They support different groups just enough to keep a certain balance of forces so none of them comes out too strong. Against ISIS the US has clearly been in an unspoken semi-cooperation coordinating bombings etc.  There is no need to get so excited. Its not like we are discussing our favourite teams or actors. Its different powers killing their own and each others peoples in order to defend the interests of their own tiny elites. Neither the American nor the Syrian, Turkish, Russian, Iranian or any other people will get anything out of these conflicts  - but they will definitely be called on to pay the price, that's for sure."

syriancivilwar,3dj8pc,heelfan,2,Thu Jul 16 23:09:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I've been following this since it started and still get confused with some of the names and coalitions. It seems like JMA has been around forever, sort of surprised they haven't gotten swallowed by a bigger group. Sort of an aside, do you see these groups coalescing into a kind of more unified, Islamist, counter to Da'esh and Assad? The more they work together the better they seem to do."
syriancivilwar,3dj8pc,eggalitarian,2,Thu Jul 16 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the irony of Da'esh bringing Sharia law to Syria indirectly is sort of interesting. I think the big question now is whether JaF will tolerate JaN and Al-Qai'da, it seems as though long term this will incentivize the US to stop pressuring Assad. I don't think AQ is done for, their affiliates are still strong in Yemen and the Maghreb. Zawahiri is biding his time, all those fighters who left JaN for Da'esh might just go back if the IS falls."
syriancivilwar,3dj8pc,eggalitarian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"Golani said not attack the west 'for now', he didn't say 'ever'.

syriancivilwar,3dj8pc,IgorForHire,2,Thu Jul 16 19:56:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think we can categorically say which is more capable of pulling off a large scale attack in the west without knowing all the behind-the-scenes intelligence. While IS is far more popular at the moment, Al-Qaeda has more of a proven track-record and experience and is seemingly more subtle and willing to play a patient long game. Letting them become established in a post-Assad Syrian government ultimately could end up being just as bad, if not worse, than letting IS remain there."
syriancivilwar,3dj8pc,Herefordiscussion2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:06:29 2015 UTC,AQAP is the AQ branch we should be worrying about. They just threatened the west in a release like last week and have been the ones developing bombs for like the last decade.
syriancivilwar,3dj8pc,sgamsterdam,2,Thu Jul 16 20:13:38 2015 UTC,"There are so many problems with this. So prideful, acting as if foreign fighters brought Islam to Syria. There are more than enough Syrian scholars to help preside over an independent judiciary. But all I am hearing is ""the judiciary will not be independent from our militias"" and that is a case that will bring nothing but fitna and discord. You should expect huge discord between your ranks if this attitude keeps up. I also hear ""we will setup schools and teach our way"". It's almost as if this is a joke. Last day of Ramadan so I'll spend time to critique it later. But this blatant propaganda isn't indicative of what is happening on the ground, and in giving yourselves (the creators of the Al muhajirun and this video) a pat on the back through videos you make without thinking, you create further strife and disunity and once again try to pervert religious thought into your own way. I wish nusra and their weird offshoots would just take the time to think about their actions, and the repercussions it has for the people as a whole, instead of making stupid videos like this to feel good about themselves. If you are/were so sure that you are in the right this video wouldn't be needed.   ""Disregard the calls for foreigners to stay home by the mujahideen because look at what we in nusra do"". Horrible."

He refers to them as ""Ikhwan Nusantara"" in 1:57 (Roughly translated as ""Brothers of the (Malay) Archipelago"".

syriancivilwar,3dj60l,ShiteDog,16,Thu Jul 16 18:19:34 2015 UTC,I feel like more and more criticism is aimed at the Kurds now they are so successful. And that the r/syriancivilwar community isn't taking it very well.  I think it's great for the Kurds. Some level of criticism is healthy for everyone and it won't really change the power balance. But that's just my opinion.
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,sgamsterdam,8,Thu Jul 16 18:24:54 2015 UTC,"Criticizism is great, although a lot of them have been pretty weak fact wise. The child soldier issue is upsetting, however and YPG/TEV-DEM need to resolve that."
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Tawuse_Melek,5,Thu Jul 16 19:40:28 2015 UTC,although a lot of them have been pretty weak fact wise.    that hasn't stopped the steady flow of people in this sub shitting on Turkey. You often see articles with flimsy facts and courses accepted as scientific truths.
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,WordSalad11,6,Thu Jul 16 20:40:26 2015 UTC,"My impression is that this sub is highly skeptical of the articles claiming Turkey is literally ISIS, but that could be selective memory.   My feeling is that, outside of the many pro-YPG posters, the general attitude is that there are always going to be unfortunate incidents when an unprofessional militia with a low overall level of training and education is on the advance, but the question is how the YPG minimizes and/or addresses them.  There's just a tremendous amount of misinformation coming out of the conflict on all sides, and it's natural that people view the news from their favorite side with rose colored glasses."
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,pizzaman9176,5,Thu Jul 16 20:51:29 2015 UTC,"Well it is suspicious that turkey was a ok with Isis controlling their border, but the Kurds control it and some how it's a problem"
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,mattdent54,3,Thu Jul 16 22:32:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Turkey acts like whatever when IS controls the other side of the border but when it's the Kurds they got ape shit."
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,DrRustle,21,Fri Jul 17 07:06:50 2015 UTC,"""America, which never helped Syrian Arabs and didn't give us weapons to protect ourselves against Bashar (al-Assad), is now arming the Kurds. And they're using that against us.""   Holy shit, the stupidity. The Syrian Kurds aren't armed at all, unlike the Arab FSA. The whole article comes across as people whining about YPG's success. And the accusations have no proof whatsoever and even the SOHR dude is denying the cleansing claims."
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Yasu3,6,Thu Jul 16 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"The shitty arms and repeatedly delayed training and ""red lines"" the FSA gets is no where near the Air support America is giving the YPG. And it's not just the air support, it is the how fast the US jumped in the second Kurds were in harms way. Within a couple months of IS's onslaught the US was bombs away. How long has the FSA been calling for it? since 2011?  btw You're wrong about not being armed  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/turkey-iraqi-kurds-kobani-isis-fighters-us-air-drops-arms  He also said   protect ourselves against Bashar (al-Assad),   The bulk of what America has done for the FSA and supposedly some in the IF (via Qatar/Turkey) is to combat IS."
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Znertu,6,Thu Jul 16 19:02:40 2015 UTC,"My memory is very hazy, but most countries barely even acknowledged the YPG's existence at first. Didn't the FSA initially get quite some support, until, well, IS 'appeared' and a lot of them defected and went extremist?"
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Yasu3,0,Thu Jul 16 19:11:28 2015 UTC,Lip service. Do not conflate sanctioning of Syria and cutting off relations with supporting the FSA. Sancitioning is one thing recognizing the SNC as the new Syrian gov akin to how the US passed the Iraqi Liberation Act is a totally different matter.
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,DrRustle,10,Thu Jul 16 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"About that last one, those were arms from the PUK dropped by the US, not from the US itself.  You can call the arms the FSA gets shitty, but that's just your opinion. Fact is that they do get weapons, whereas the Kurds get none. You are right about the airstrikes, but you have to keep in mind why. The Kurds are mainly fighting ISIS and ISIS doesn't have friends in the UNSC. Therefore it is much less risky to attack them than the regime. Also, the FSA is intermingled with Al Qaeda and other jihadist elements, which makes it harder for the US to support them. This is different for the Kurds.  Finally, if you take into account the amount of aid the FSA and jihadists get from neighboring countries, there wouldn't even be a comparison. Fact of the matter is that the rebels have had much more support and continue to do so. It's just that they are very divided themselves and have jihadists among them which makes them fail in their attempts to be an alternative after Assad."
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Moh7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:21 2015 UTC,I don't know why youre trying to revist history when its so easy to fact check the lies you come up with.   http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-giving-aid-to-iraqi-kurds-battling-islamic-state-or-isis-1407777223  Youre also completely ignoring that the US has given the kurds their personal air force which is worth 1000x more then some small arms. Without air strikes the kurds would have been pushed out of Syria long ago.
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,ghrarib,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:36:27 2015 UTC,"First: As far as i could read, your article is talking about Iraqi Kurds. We're talking about Syrian Kurds.  Second: ISIS would not have been able to capture more than 1/3 of Kobani Canton if Burkan al-Firat had these.  Third: YPG/J & allies have weaker arsenal than any other major group, alliance or an army in Syria and Iraq. They also have fewer soldiers than most of those.  Fourth: USAF-led Anti-ISIS/L Coalition would have been mostly ineffective in Syria without YPG/J & allies."
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Tawuse_Melek,5,Fri Jul 17 04:16:31 2015 UTC,Arming kurds in kobani once=arming them oh...
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Yasu3,3,Thu Jul 16 19:37:22 2015 UTC,All I am saying is they did in fact arm them. Instead of picking on 1 sentence read the rest. Arming is nothing compared to YPG coordinated airstrikes.  And let us not act like pro-YPG FSA groups are not getting arms
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Tawuse_Melek,3,Thu Jul 16 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"Not arguing that at all, air power is mainly the reason the Kurds have had success period. To say they're being armed though is silly, unless you count the reclamation of Iraqi hardware as such. :) I wish that all groups fighter for a free syria got = love, although politics and what not."

syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Axa2000,0,Fri Jul 17 00:00:57 2015 UTC,"No they did not. Can't you even read? All they did was airdrop, the arms was from KRG.. If they did not help with that, Kobane defence would not have had time to last the onslaught, the Turks were blockading them. Your argument seems to suggest you actually want to see Kurds fail than see them being armed or assisted with air power.  Have you been following this conflict for like 1 month or something that you seem to think the YPG get all the love.. Tell us how much arms has been provided to the FSA or the current cost of the training program that they're throwing at the FSA.."
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Yasu3,-3,Thu Jul 16 20:37:32 2015 UTC,"All they did was airdrop, the arms was from KRG   Who? America. That is  a fraction of my post. stop focusing on it.   current cost of the training program that they're throwing at the FSA..   The one that has been repeatedly delayed? that one? The one that has never actually done to what they claimed it would be? random TOWs popping up are nothing compared to airsupport."
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,tommyboy1942,2,Thu Jul 16 20:40:51 2015 UTC,would hardly say jumped in quickly.  They let ISIS take a lot of land and turn Kobane into a pile of rubble before acting.  They did so for two reasons.  Firstly the siege of Kobane got a lot of media attention and 2nd was they realised hey we can kill a lot of ISIS here lets bomb the crap out of them.
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,munkmunk49,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:43:03 2015 UTC,The US initially started bombing ISIS because they feared a genocide against the Yazidis. It evolved into supporting the YPG during Kobani.
syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Moh7,10,Thu Jul 16 22:44:23 2015 UTC,The US initially began bombing ISIS when they were a few Km's outside of the kurdish capital where billions worth of american oil companies are situated. Many americans were at risk.

syriancivilwar,3dj60l,Trailmagic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:47:07 2015 UTC,The international political scene was extremely turbulent and it seemed like the rebel situation was different every two weeks.

I've asked him about the latter, because no one I asked in Hasakah knew it, no one reported it, Daesh didn't claim it, and his usual answer was: my sources say so. Several days after I've posted a photo from Tel Brak and a map that shows how the situation actually is, because plenty people believed his fantasies. Half hour later he just quietly copied my map on his live map. I saw that coming, as he's done it before, grabbed some screenshots and raised this. He said that he contacted the source (that he earlier contradicted me with) and the source said my map was suddenly right.

Either way I haven't spoken to Fadi since yesterday morning, so most of the developments shown in that map and the update coming up soon are from other sources, namely ColdKurd but backed up by others."

And then, when it was clear Ayn Issa is not taken, instead of admitting mistake, he just made up withdrawal, because YPG/FSA were inept enough to keep it without airstrikes, and I think this bit even made it to wikipedia. So basically: here's a guy that pretends to be an YPG insider who reports Daesh victory, a victory that even Daesh doesn't claim. Clearly something's not right here, to put it mildly."

Only an example for his behavior: WEEKS before YPG/Burkan even entered Ain Issa, he claimed that the town was already captured by them. After realizing that his lie wasn't sustainable anymore, he made up a whole other story with ""a retreat because of no Coalition Air Support for Burkan"". I'm careful with such egomaniac guys."

It's pretty interesting to compare that with the salient strategy of the rebels in the west - when fighting an enemy that won't retreat, will send in more and more reinforcements, and will always keep trying to push forward this makes far more sense, it seems. Let's hope they can pull this off."

syriancivilwar,3dhhs1,mc1205,3,Thu Jul 16 13:28:10 2015 UTC,"Isn't this basically the principle behind the so-called ""blitzkrieg"" and operational warfare that the Germans developed after WWI and that the Americans and Soviets both eventually adopted: concentrate your forces on weak spots, bypass and isolate enemy strongpoints and front-line units, harry their communication and supply lines, prevent them from coordinating, and then use heavy artillery (in this case air power) to eliminate the now-isolated pockets. My understanding of warfare is very limited, but based on that limited understanding, it seems like the YPG/J is using a pretty sound and conventional approach and making good use of their strategic advantages (a highly-mobile light infantry force backed up by exceptional, invulnerable precision-guided artillery from the USAF).  It would also make sense that this kind of operational warfare would mirror European and American military theory given the close coordination between the YPG/J and Americans, who are presumably providing a lot of strategic and operational advice."
syriancivilwar,3dhhs1,Ian_W,2,Thu Jul 16 13:31:48 2015 UTC,"It's similar for sure.  Blitzkrieg was hit hard & fast at the front line to cause chaos with heavy bombing, artillery, and tank action, then encircle or move to weak points while the enemy is expecting you to still come from the front.  The front changes all the time and it makes it hard on the defender to cover all points."

syriancivilwar,3din7b,Trailmagic,4,Thu Jul 16 22:12:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if the regime loses Aleppo, they'll actually be better able to conduct operations in other parts of the country as tens of thousands of troops will be freed from what's essentially an isolated and very heavily-manned outpost. Though the cost is that their long-term legitimacy will be damaged significantly. Their best course of action though would be to withdraw from Aleppo in a way which will grant IS at least partial control over the city, which would both free up men for the regime and also keep Aleppo as a meat grinder for the forseeable future. All they need is for Aleppo to be in perpetual conflict for them to never see the downsides of them not holding the city. It's either that or they continue to bleed out there."

Using the base in Mukkalla, the jihadists target Shia mosques, Houthi leaders and patrols, and other targets.   Since the start of the Yemen war, the Royal Saudi Air Force and its coalition partners have not targeted AQAP's Hadramawt emirate. It has not been subjected at all to the bombing other Yemeni cities are enduring. As a consequence, Yemeni internally displaced persons have sought shelter and protection in Mukkalla.

IIRC, their pilots still need another year or two of training at this point.   In terms of F-16 vs. other options, it all depends on the pricing they're getting. It probably makes the most sense for them to acquire a small number of multi-role aircraft, and as long as they're on good terms with the US, the F-16 is a good option for being low-cost (relatively), with proven precision munitions and good air-to-air capability. They might save some money by going for JF-17s or something similar, but there are a lot of question marks about the quality and reliability of a brand new joint Chinese/Pakistani aircraft and it's associated weapon systems."

Bahrain naturalized 5,000 refugees.  Gulf countries, outside of Bahrain and Qatar (with only 40 or so refugees) are not taking refugees. Bahrain in naturalizing 5,000 people took more refugees than the US (under 100), Canada (10), UK (0, they will 'resettle' 500), and france who has about 500 as of 2013 according to wikipedia.  Australia apparently only reserved a place for 2200 people and is sending the rest of the Syrian refugees it gets back to Syria.

I see more people saying things like this, that the West and Europe isn't doing enough. But I respectfully disagree. It is true that Europe offers few resettlement places, but why should Europe offer more? More than 100.000 Syrians have crossed into Europe in 2014 alone, and according to the UNHCR there were 278,551 Syrian refugees in Europe by the end of May. The Europe has also provided more than €3.7 billion in aid to refugees. (PDF alert) Isn't this much more than what the Gulf is doing?  Of course, Turkey does much more than anyone else.

Kobani - There have been a number of fresh contacts between the Defense Units – enduring their military operations in south Kobani – and the ISIL terrorists who have tried to engage a major ground-holding operation in Kobani rural district.  Yesterday, July 14, a small unit of ISIL terrorists attempted for an attack on the village of Makharaten to the east of the town Sarrin, led to minor clash with our Units. The group was eventually forced to flee the location, their possible dead or wounded could not be immediately verified.  A distinct engagement between our forces and the ISIL attackers was erupted in the southern village of Kapinrapin.

syriancivilwar,3di2b5,TanDeng,2,Thu Jul 16 13:49:01 2015 UTC,"The first clearly foreign group fighting on the side of the rebels (there have been Iranians fighting on the side of the regime since the beginning) was probably Liwaa al-Umma (even though most of it's members are Syrians) which was founded by Mahdi Al-Harati in the spring of 2012. He's an Irish-Libyan who led the Tripoli Brigade in the Libyan civil war.  From almost the beginning of the conflict claims of al Qaeda membership fighting in the conflict were made by Assad. It's likely that there were some foreign-born al Qaeda members fighting in Syria early on, as the leadership of Ahrar al-Sham (founded in 2011) was closely aligned with al Qaeda, as was al Nusra early on. There were also other smaller groups which pledged loyalty to al Qaeda early on.   There's not any clear tracking of foreigners available for the early part of the conflict, but it's likely that the earliest foreign fighters were Iraqis, as Syrians had been fighting in Iraq for some time. Westerners were fighting in Syria by 2013."

That is why I think of when he says ""political solution""."
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,gesreddit,12,Thu Jul 16 07:07:57 2015 UTC,"Libya is very different from Syria. Tribal militias hold a much greater influence over local politics, making the divisions we see today possible. The factions in the SCW are much better organized than any in Libya. Nusra only has a few thousand men, but AAS, JaI, and the SF all have over 25k, all with well organized command structures.   That may sound worse than Libya, but having well organized factions means that whichever side wins the post-Assad civil war is likely to remain stable and effective. Frankly, I'm willing to put my money on the FSA. Nusra and AAS have significant political power in Idlib and parts of the North Aleppo countryside, but AAS despises Nusra for ideological and practical reasons. JaI is too geographically constrained to be very important. So the two most powerful Salafi groups are more likely to fight each other, while the FSA and moderate Islamists are becoming more centralized, better trained, and are virtually guaranteed not to fight each other. As long as they don't make the mistakes of the SRF they have a very decent chance of winning. I'd rather gamble on a better future than accept Assad butchering tens of thousands more people and ruining the country with pervasive corruption."

syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,billybookcase,2,Thu Jul 16 06:15:43 2015 UTC,"That's precisely what the southern front is asking. A preservation of state institutions without Assad. That's what the bulk of rebels are asking, even those in Nusra front want, and place emphasis upon, preservation of infrastructure and stability, and they are some of the most extreme of the rebels. There is no reason to fight if Assad is gone. One unified Syrian front under a transitional government can easily coerce any group to give up their weapons if they choose not to join the national army.   Unless you mean the war with isis then yes that would go on. But a unified syria means isis losing its territory it has held in Syria"
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,Herefordiscussion2,3,Thu Jul 16 14:36:21 2015 UTC,"I dont think giving Nusra what it wants is a good idea, and they won't stop fighting if Assad leaves. They should have 0 input on how Syria is run, they are Al-Qaeda. Daesh won't quit. No way will the war stop if Assad leaves. The southern front seems to be the most reasonable of the rebels, but in my opinion, the SAA is the best of bad options."

syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,billybookcase,-5,Thu Jul 16 15:20:53 2015 UTC,"I knew these responses were coming. The analogy never fits unless you wish to drag down a ruler of a nation with proper military backing to those of guerrilla rebels.   It's bizarre to make a statement like this. It has long been recognized internationally that a sitting and established government has the monopoly on use of force within its own territory first off, and second of all has every right to invite in its allies be they a military contingent or military advisers from any foreign country they have a cordial relationship and security ties with. Terrorists trying to openly through force of arms topple a sitting government have no recognized right to facilitate the illegal entry of thousands to invade the country and storm military bases and depots, towns, and cities. If any government in the world which wasn't on the hit-list of the same Western suspects whose influence gives the media voice around the world was faced with this and combatting this it would be resoundingly defined in terms of an anti-terrorist struggle and within the purview of the perfectly legitimate right to self-defense of a legally established government not to have to sit still and let itself be violently overthrown. Like Bahrain, Egypt, Ukraine, and even Yemen.  And what's hilarious is that pundits and talking heads on stations owned by Gulf and Western moguls and state interests alike hold up the Saudi-led round the clock bombardment of Yemen as something legitimate and legally sanctioned because supposedly the legal government asked for it when, lol, that government doesn't even sit in the capital or any major city any longer and the former president is hiding in the country doing the bombing. And these same people froth at the mouth if the immensely more popular immensely more in control (still entrenched in every major city in the land) Syrian government has a few thousand Hizbollah which it supported financially and logistically before this war (in tandem with Iran) come to its aid in pockets of insurgency it has difficulty with."
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,WorldsupportsBashar,7,Thu Jul 16 16:00:06 2015 UTC,"Force against his own civilians..you have to ask yourself if reconciliation is possible if bashar keeps up with the way he is approaching this. Is reconciliation possible by inviting foreigners to fight against Syrians?  See your approach helps no one, it isn't up to you to label the rebels as terrorists or not. It's up to what the civilians on the ground feel. And those in rebel areas have said to hell to bashar..this is the reality and you need to accept this. You have to accept that a vast number of Syrians see the rebels as Syrians. He won't be welcomed with open arms even if he does subdue the rebellion. The end game has to be a unified Syria. Bashar is ruining that prospect. And the liability is on his shoulders because as you said he is the head of state.  ..If he keeps this up he will single handedly destroy Syria...and then no one wins."
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,Herefordiscussion2,-3,Thu Jul 16 10:15:55 2015 UTC,"LOL if you think Nusra,Ahrar Sham and ISIS will give up their weapons"
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,hawksfan222,11,Thu Jul 16 14:26:25 2015 UTC,Grouping ahrar ash sham in with the nusra front is bad as it is as they are separate entities. Grouping them with Isis is worse as they are open enemies to one another.   In my opinion Isis could never maintain Syria with a unified Syrian front against them.   Nusra is relatively small and will bend to popular will when the time comes; however if they don't they too will not last against a unified Syrian front.
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,Herefordiscussion2,3,Thu Jul 16 14:41:48 2015 UTC,"a grouping is, by definition, composed of separate entities.  What really does separate the Jihadis of Ahrar Sham from Al Nusra?"
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,borhas,4,Thu Jul 16 14:56:59 2015 UTC,"Whats the difference between Nusra and AAS ideologically? I know one wants to set up a salafist state in Syria and the other wants to set up a salafist state in Syria with an eye to further expansion. Or maybe you mean their ideology in terms of their attitude towards the West, with Ahrar having no intention of attacking the West/Israel whereas Nusra might. In that case you should clarify that the ideological differences between Ahrar and Nusra is their ideology towards the West, because on the ground in Syria their ideologies are the same, they call each other brothers and fellow mujahids and they fight and legislate and rule together.  It's strange times we're living in. THE WASHINGTON POST sponsors a propaganda stunt for a group co-founded by one of Bin Laden's best buddies and closest confidantes."
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,iComeWithBadNews,6,Thu Jul 16 08:48:30 2015 UTC,AAS does not use suicide bombers for example.
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,gesreddit,4,Thu Jul 16 09:14:56 2015 UTC,"If there is an ideological difference then I'd like you to point them out. They're both arab salafists waging jihad who are focused on Syria (at least for now.) And they're both practical (they'll focus on fighting Assad and slaughtering ""safavid"" Shia before moving on to other ethnicities).  Both funded by Gulf Arab states.    As far as acceptance by Syrians, who knows.  They both are allies and have also allied other rebels against ISIS and Assad.   Size seems to be comparable to Al-Nusra front"
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,borhas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:04:41 2015 UTC,"Rejection of suicide bombing is a good point that I wasn't aware of. But a lot of the other stuff is really a matter of degree, not really categorical differences.  They are both takfiri though maybe not as much as each other.  And they are both reaching out to the West.  AAS may be writing articles in the WashPo but Golani just did an interview on Al-Jazeera.  Obviously, Al Jazeera is not western, but his message to them was intended for the West.  IMO it is to the point of splitting hairs.  Way more similarities than differences in the big picture."
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,borhas,4,Wed Jul 15 23:08:31 2015 UTC,"Salafi muslims are as vast and diverse as are the general population among Sunni Muslims. They range from people who are outside the bounds of the Sunni community on the extremist conservative side, to those who leave the bounds of the Sunni community on the liberal extremism side. The vast majority are Sunni, to say all salafis are the same is doing an injustice to them for misrepresenting them, and to yourself for making too simple a rather complex issue and movement."

I would argue such differences   Even down to theological differences like rejecting suicide bombing   Are mere theological disagreements in fiqh, not in Aqeedah. The fundamentals of both group remain the same. They are both jihadist in nature.  Tell me what you think."
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,Paragon23100,0,Thu Jul 16 01:53:25 2015 UTC,"If they're still Jihadist in ideology, than I think the difference in their ideology is simply not distinct enough. Therefore I'd argue that saying they have a differences in ideology without clarifying their jihadi center remains the same is misleading, and should be stopped. These Jihadis should also be condemned, not apologized for.  I don't mean this in an offensive way, but am just trying to get to honest truth. Please share with me your thoughts."

syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,Messicus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:32:17 2015 UTC,"This is true, and is a good analogy that deserves a deeper look (later maybe). ..with the exception that the American civil war was a war of secession. No one wants to secede here, they all wish to remain Syrian, ISIS being the exception (Though they aren't classified as rebels). It would be a good idea to look and think about the end game, will the Syrian population accept Bashar in power after all this is done? Especially after he resorted to using shia militias, and after the bombings.. This war won't end with forced subjugation, in my opinion, it will end through dialogue and political change. Otherwise I only see more bloodshed."
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,Herefordiscussion2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:17:05 2015 UTC,Frankly I dont think they are after that at all. It makes sense to place the idea in the heads of the echelons of command below Assad though. Anything that could trigger a palace coup would benefit them.
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,coldandpain,2,Thu Jul 16 02:04:41 2015 UTC,"So, assuming there was a way to remove Assad and defeat ISIS, that would open a negotiated peace between SAA, Southern Front, and YPG. I don't see how the northern rebels would be able to avoid being part of that. If they're willing to divide Syria into autonomous zones, you could have a 5 state solution; Rojova, Idlib, Druzeville (whatever they want to call it), Dara'a, and Latakia/Alawitistan.   That would be about as close to a happy ending as we're likely to get out of this."
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,WordSalad11,20,Thu Jul 16 02:10:36 2015 UTC,"Let me get this straight, the only way to save Syria, is to pretty much disband Syria and call it a day? So far I've only seen Westerners suggest a 5 state solution lol and it's ridiculous every time."

syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,Snyggkille,4,Thu Jul 16 05:47:20 2015 UTC,"Come up with a better solution?   No, you're right. The best solution obviously to stop the bloodshed is giving every minority a sovereign state and admitting that having independent nations in the Middle East was a bad idea.   Look, if you really supported the SAA, in all their secular might, you wouldn't be in favor of splitting your nation up in accordance to ethnic borders based on nothing but prejudice, fear and laziness.  I'm afraid one of the prime reasons your average soldier will give you as to why he fights is as following: ""before the war we were all living together, then the terrorists to destroy Syria.*""  Splitting up Syria will destroy Syria. I can agree with this. Yugoslavia had pre-existing nations. Serbs, Bosnians, Albanians is what most Yugoslavians are known as today.   If this balkanization occured in Syria, everytime a Syrian met Syrians from other ""provinces"", they would have to ask eachother what ethnicity they belong to before doing business, and use phrases such as ""oh I'm Syrian-Alewite"" and ""I'm Sunni-Syrian."" The effect this would have on the already damaged social fabric there would not be fixed even if Syria become one again.  And you could see clear evidence of this in f.e Homs where both Alewites and Sunnis were persecuted daily for nothing but the town or village they were from.  The thought of this Syria is appalling, and for having a flair of the SAA, a faction which allegedly fights for secularism, separating Syrians based on their religious beliefs is utter bullshit and makes me wonder whether you are actually Syrian or not.   Because this very issue is the most sensitive one in Syria after a bunch of topics relating to the atrocities committed by Assad, and frankly it should be left to Syrians to even contemplate on.   But one of the main reasons I think Syria was working fine with all sects living side by side is due to the oppressive nature of the regime to suppress any debate about anything before it's officially ""ok"" to talk about, therefore religion and ethnicity has always been taboo there."
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,TheCapeman,-2,Thu Jul 16 16:23:21 2015 UTC,I never claimed i supported that solution.  And your argument against it is useless. Do you seriously think every faction in this war is only supported by an ethnicity each?

syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,Nmathmaster123,8,Thu Jul 16 02:19:26 2015 UTC,"Thing is, Assad couldn't have organized all these crimes of mass arrests, executing civilians/defectors, and managing secret prisons without the people around him.   And these people believe that the only way Syria can remain sovereign is if you employ these exercises of simply not giving a fuck about your people as long as the nation stays fed and stable while doing everything in your power to fight dissent and opposition.  And if Assad went this would be like cutting off the head of a snake with constantly growing heads. This is the same party which, out of the 1000 coups in the 60s, performed the most successful, so there is no doubt in my mind that the people who simply consider Assad a puppet-head, and simply a face of a much larger and essential network, will attempt to regain power as they have in the past.  So, things to before holding an election in a fragile land which just suffered a civil war that killed 300,000 (500,000 if it ends at latest):   The entire cabinet surrounding him and his family should go, and possibly have the most involved and veteran intelligence officers stand before trial, and the Assad dynasty (Rami Makhlouf, Assad's cousins within the intelligence service etc.) step down from their posts together with Assad while only making the necessary improvements to the army (of which i am not knowledgeable enough to speak on) instead of disbanding and re-creating it like in Iraq, thus creating another generation of disillusioned, unemployed men with guns.  But as of now there cannot be a party that isn't some shitty pseudo-socialist party with no members which sole purpose is to show that Syria has other parties than Ba'ath, something that is a mockery of democracy imo.  Idk if that is what you meant, but this is pretty much what I have in mind."
syriancivilwar,3dfhg7,TheCapeman,4,Thu Jul 16 02:33:35 2015 UTC,"You're totally correct. The counter argument however is that right now we need peace. I want to see members of Syria's deep state face justice for their crimes. But right now, the blood letting needs to stop. Assad is a symbol of state tyranny, him being overthrown replaced won't change the deep state. But it gives the international community an institution led by someone they can grudgingly tolerate working with against daesh, nusra and other elements.  Once this happens, if this happens, Syria can hopefully have some kind of truth and reconciliation commission. And hopefully jail the worst offenders. But gutting state institutions right now, with daesh and other groups powerful as they are, would only leave a vacuum to be filled by people as bad (and possibly worse) than those in power now.  Normally the saying is ""We have no good options, only bad ones"". In the current conflict the saying should be ""We have no bad options, only terrible ones""."

syriancivilwar,3dguow,HawkUK,2,Thu Jul 16 04:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yup:   Tornado bombing missions against Islamic State were temporarily halted yesterday after two missiles fell off one of the ageing aircraft on landing.  The incident came as the head of the military warned that Britain’s fast jets were operating at the “very limits” of availability and capacity.  General Sir Nicholas Houghton said that the Royal Air Force, which has just seven fast jet squadrons compared with 30 at the end of the Cold War, was “challenged” to cover the full spectrum of defence roles required by the government.  He indicated, however, that a possible expansion of aircraft numbers should be considered as part of a review of defence and security that is due to conclude in the autumn.  The strategic defence and security review (SDSR) is taking place against the backdrop of George Osborne’s pledge to increase the defence budget as part of a commitment to spend at least 2 per cent of national income on the armed forces until the end of the decade. General Houghton said that the move presented the military with “huge opportunities”.  “The size and mix of the fast jet force must be one of several capability decisions considered in the SDSR,” he said in a speech at an air power conference.  RAF fast jets protect UK airspace from Russian bombers, deter Russian incursions in the Baltic and fly bombing raids against Islamic State in Iraq.  The fast jet made a “hard landing”, which possibly caused the £105,000 munitions to come loose in bad weather. Nobody was hurt and the missiles did not detonate.  An explosive ordnance team was due to assess the missiles and was preparing to carry out a controlled explosion if necessary. Air base staff will need to conduct a thorough sweep of the runway afterwards to ensure that all debris is cleared away. The job is expected to be finished today, but all Tornado missions over Iraq would be halted in the meantime, a defence source said.  It is the first time that Tornado flights have been forced to stop operating over Iraq from Cyprus since the mission as part of the US-led coalition against Isis began last September.  Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, will reveal today that Britain is adding a new spy plane to the surveillance effort over Iraq and Syria – an effort that is larger than the vast British surveillance operations over Afghanistan during the 13-year war.  He will liken the mission to a “new Battle of Britain”, according to extracts from a speech that he is due to give at the air power conference hosted by the Royal United Services Institute.  The UK contribution includes eight Tornados, two Sentinels, two Sentry E3d planes, ten Reaper drones, an Airseeker spy plane, an air-to-air refuelling aircraft and the top-secret Shadow, which supports special forces operations."

syriancivilwar,3dhleu,komnene,5,Thu Jul 16 11:23:18 2015 UTC,"They've been doing a seriously good job.  Theres a time to husband resources, and a time to use them.  This is the latter. This encirclement will lead to the liberation of Raqqa, just like the encirclement east of Tal Abayed led to it's liberation."
syriancivilwar,3dhleu,Ian_W,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:59:03 2015 UTC,I can pretty much guarentee that the assault on Raqqah will take place at the same time as the assault on Mosul. If they both fall in the same time period than it's lights out for Daesh and they will run back into the underground. I would expect DeZ to fall relatively soon to the SAA after that as well...This is all assuming that Raqqah & Mosul fall at the same time or around the same time...And if they fall at all.
syriancivilwar,3dhleu,TanDeng,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:53:46 2015 UTC,"That would make sense. It seems like the Hasaka offensive is happening at the same time as Fallujah and Ramadi. Whether or not they are being coordinated I would think that ISIS facing multiple threats on multiple fronts at the same time (not to mention Palmyra) should seriously restrict their freedom to respond effectively. If Fallujah, Ramadi, and Hasaka fall (and I guess Sarrin afterwards) giving the YPG/J and ISF the initiative, it does seem like it would make sense to press forward against their two biggest cities simultaneously rather than at different points. I would think that the multiplicity of enemies that ISIS faces and the logistical strength and flexibility of the USAF to conduct a multi-theater campaign are big strategic advantages if the various elements of the anti-ISIS coalition can make use of them."
syriancivilwar,3dhleu,refrencher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:25:38 2015 UTC,"How serious of a strategic defeat would it be for ISIS if all of their forces within the pocket were eliminated? Do we have any idea roughly how much of ISIS's local strength has been concentrated on the Hasaka front?  I'm also curious, since you seem to think that the liberation of Raqqa is plausible in the near term, whether you could explain this a bit more. As a somewhat ignorant observer, it seems to me like the city would be very heavily fortified and require a lot of house-to-house fighting that a light infantry force like the YPG or Euphrates Volcano isn't especially well-suited to (especially with a potentially hostile population). My understanding is that Tal Abyad is the largest ISIS-occupied city to be liberated in Syria so far, and the reasonably-sized city anyone has liberated at all has been Tikrit. Is that true?"
syriancivilwar,3dhleu,refrencher,2,Thu Jul 16 12:59:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will be eliminated entirely. Daesh has proven that they would rather surrender than die mostly, I expect most of those encircled will surrender or try to make a break south which is possible. Now if Daesh sends reinforcements from the South they might be able to save the offensive but it's looking bleak now. I just wonder how the YPG/SAA react to each other once Daesh is kicked out."
syriancivilwar,3dhleu,TanDeng,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:29:56 2015 UTC,"First things first.  The population of Raqqa isnt hostile to Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa and friends - Raqqa didnt join IS, it got conquered.  Second, IS are not great on the defense. They are a great light cavalry army - show them a gap and they are through it, and show them a rout and they'll go further and faster and capture more stuff with less troops than anyone imagines ... but they have this habit of continually counter-attacking.  If you add this to not being able to hold strong points because the USAF disintegrates them, not having the armor or artillery they used to and not having reserves because they lost them at Raqqa, and in a month or so we'll get a big dose of 'No, really, we deliberately retreated', just like at Tal Abayed.  As to numbers trapped in Hasakah, Id say about half of IS's troops in the area."
syriancivilwar,3dhleu,Ian_W,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:12:42 2015 UTC,Interesting! What proportion of their forces in the area were eliminated prior to the assault on Tal Abyad (ie what percentage of their forces in the area were destroyed which enabled the offensive on Tal Abyad at all)? And what proportion were eliminated during that offensive? Do you have any guess how many in numerical terms are probably in the pocket?
syriancivilwar,3dhleu,refrencher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:22:45 2015 UTC,"My estimate is about half. The rest skedaddled for the Turkish border and pretended to be civilians.  Tal Abayed wasnt an ""assault"", in the end. It was more a ""stroll"".  Here are YPG claims. It's propaganda. Note I go 'yeah, right' to claimed kills, but pay attention to bodies and - especially - weapons captures.  http://www.ypgrojava.com/en/index.php/statements"
syriancivilwar,3dhleu,Ian_W,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:26:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry, maybe I should clarify my question.  What was the distribution of ISIS forces in north-eastern Syria prior to the encirclement that subsequently led to the Tal Abyad offensive/stroll? What proportion of the total forces were eliminated in that pocket? What proportion of the forces near Tal Abyad (it sounds like this is the ""half"" you mention above)? What proportion of total forces in the region were eliminated in the entire Tal Abyad campaign (either by being killed or fleeing into Turkey where they are presumably now cut off and not easily able to return to that front)? What proportion of their forces in the region now remain? How many of those are participating in the Hasaka assault? How many are in the current pocket? How easily can ISIS shift forces from other areas into the region to defend Raqqa?  Do these questions even make sense, or are the Raqqa, Hasaka, and Tal Abyad fronts sufficiently separately that it doesn't make sense to even speak consider the region as a single whole?  Sorry if you can't answer these questions. I don't know the extent to which information like this is actually known (I presume various military forces and intelligence groups have their own estimates, but I mean to us lay people). But it seems like these are some of the big questions that would influence whether Raqqa could realistically be liberated soon, and I feel like this is a good starting place for me to ask about if I'm trying to form my own guess about that!"
syriancivilwar,3dhleu,refrencher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:37:05 2015 UTC,"IS runs on a ""warband"" system, where you have more or less independent forces run by Emirs. They sometimes get moved from province to province, and they can and will do their own independant actions (light cav, again).  IS chose to burn those troops in Hasake on a counter-attack, presumbly relying on punching through SAA and capturing the artillery base.  The other critical point is it's not about trigger pullers - it's about good troops, who know what they are doing and are good at it.  These are also the troops that provide the pointy end on offensives.  Id estimate that IS have less than 500 of those in the Raqqa front, and the 500 or so they had in Hasake are trapped.  IS has some capability to move troops, but as well as Raqqa they are under pressure in Palmyra, in DEZ, in Hasake, in Fallujah, in Sarrin, and cant leave Mosul unprotected.  This will limit their ability to move reserves.  What they dont have the capability to move, at all, is tanks.  And their ability to use suicide vehicles, and tanks, and artillery to blow open holes to let their light cavalry do is what made them so nasty.  Now, we just saw the SAA in Hasake hold the line for long enough for YPG to come around their flanks.  You're going to see the link between Raqqa and Mosul broken before that pocket is fully liquidated."

syriancivilwar,3dfppi,Paragon23100,-10,Thu Jul 16 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the sunni civilians all get out before this. Or we will see some more abuses by the proxies. Like Katib-Hezbollah leading ""captured IS"" AKA Sunni civilian MAMs, more militia beheading Daesh, executions, and the rampant looting that we saw in Tikrit.  If more abuses like the ones that got the militias taken out of Anbar happen, it will do nothing but push Sunnis into the arms of Daesh like Malik's abuses did; which Shia never seem to recognize.  The Iranian proxies were famous for sectarian violence. something else the Iranina militia and terrorist proxy supporters refuse to admit. They claim they only targeted Amercians, when they killed plenty of IP and ING; also UN and personal and government workers. the jailing and killing of alcohol sellers, especially if they were Christian or Sunni is another well known case. which puts another hole is the lie Shia militias and Irianian terrorist proxies only targeted coalition personal and Iraqi security forces.  These terrorists, and Iranian agents, infest the PMUs. I get down voted every time I mention they are are filled with some bad guys and many Iranian proxies.  God forbid the Iraqi security forces should be the main and only fighting group. Having proxies that only asnwer to Iran must be a dream for the IRGC. Who want Iraq to be divided and in chaos so it never again could be a threat to Iranian designs.  Then again I'm thinking what will happen after IS is defeated? Will terrorist proxies like Katib Hezbollah disarm? Will the PMUs join the Iraqi security forces, even if they do it means it will be filled with Iranian creatures. Or will we end up with another Hezbollah like situation in Iraq?"
syriancivilwar,3dfppi,dragon_nipples,12,Thu Jul 16 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"more militia beheading Daesh, executions, and the rampant looting that we saw in Tikrit   Outright, this calls into question your entire argument. Al Jazeera itself testified that the majority of looting and burning was conducted by Sunnis returning with the PMUs or who were members of PMUs seeking revenge. What makes this clear is the fact that the Shia soldiers, having never lived there, had no idea who's houses were whose. It was the Sunni soldiers who targeted and attacked these different houses. The NY times also attested to the fact that the majority of apprehensions people had about the PMUs largely did not materialize. Al-Arabiya in a desperate attempt listed the Shia fighters stealing Shampoo and toothpaste from Tikrit. That's ridiculous.  The reason you're getting downvoted is because you're trying to accomplish an impossible task; finding a way to equate Shia Militias with the absolutely barbaric ISIS in attempt to justify mass Sunni support for the group. Your replies gradually get more and more shrill and non-sensical each time, often founded upon flawed premises. The problem is not everyone has the time or patience or knowledge to rectify these things again and again.  When talking about Iran, I don't have any real protestations, though I severely doubt whatever you say. I'm an American before I'm anything else--and oppose those who act against us. I also don't really trust them at all.  The Shi'a community definitely has much to fix, that there is no doubt. The idea that Shias are the main protectors of Christians in the ME and their chief allies right now does not mean that relations are perfect, or that the Shias are. But they're miles ahead of others, and are moving in the right direction. Most importantly, leaders like Ayatollah Sistani are the exact people they need, and are miles ahead of others. They are supporting all the right things, and with such people in place and in influence, the Shias will only improve in this regard. You'd do well to remember however, that Shias opened their home and are housing thousands upon thousands of Sunni and Christian families in their homes in Shia cities. The same people that would not even give them water when they went on pilgrimage to Sunni cities.  Finally, here are my thoughts about what you said on Maliki.   The whole blame Maliki for everything narrative is convenient but ultimately untrue. Sunnis had disproportionately high political representation, equal economic development to the Shia (the areas with the highest Economic development being in the Sunni Kurdish areas) with far fewer resources, and made unfair and non-tenable demands (like demands for the defense porfolio) they knew would never fly. They also blocked everything in parliament so nothing could get passed. It has also now been proven that Sunni leaders supported ISIS prior to their rise. Not to mention the absolutely brutal genocidal insurgency that massacred Shia in an unprecedented scale, that Sunnis were aware of but still supported, right up until Baghdadi in Mosul. Even now there is massive support for ISIS in these communities."

They also tortured some.  PBS explains very well what Maliki did  Maliki machine gunned the protesters, he killed parliament members, and accused others of terrorist acts. He is 100% to blame for IS rising.  There is massive support for IS because of Maliki, and his sectarian bullshit. He fucked the awakening council.

You never addressed the Iranian proxy terrorists now fighting IS,  but before were killing Americans and everyone else in Iraq.  I guess you never asked the question now why these tribes support IS? Because of Maliki and their disenfranchisement from the political process.  The only force that should be involved in retaking the country is the Iraqi army, not these Iranian controlled PMU's. i've followed this war since it started, you might be able to fool others with this PMU bullshit i know what they really are for.

You're either very misinformed or lying through your teeth.  And when did I say I didn't care about Iran's wrong? I don't like Iran's theocratic system, I'm a secularist, and I condemn their support of Assad--you're just making things up. I also brought up the Houthi killing of civilians in Yemen's south in my reply to you, when no one else had. Never once have I gone against those things. I say America first not only because it's my nationality, but because I belief it is the force for good in the world.  If Iran did bad things, it should be recognized. Fuck them for that. But I'm not talking about those things, or defending them. Our engagement has been on Shi'a Militias, and I have refuted your propaganda against them, specifically against Tikrit using Al Jazeera and the NY Times. As you've been unable to refute them you've resorted to calling me a shill, but you haven't been able to actually argue back. If anything, you're the Shill.   I've seen you in many other threads on main reddit, on any topic that has to do with Iran. I recognize your name, you shill for Iran, and you've done it for a long long time.   This is, simply put, a lie. If there is a place I spend it's r/Islam, and that's discussing historical issues on Shiism.   I guess you never asked the question now why these tribes support IS? Because of Maliki and their disenfranchisement from the political process.   So.......what about those facts I have listed on this topic twice now, that you still have not been able to address??  Again and again you've been unable to respond to my arguments and have made false accusations to try and make up for that. But it hasn't worked. It's just poor form.  It's clear, with your baseless accusations and unintelligent attacks (and the fact that you post far more on here than me), that YOU'RE the shill.  Edit: This comment of yours and the ensuing evisceration of your (lack of) logic reveals you as a sectarian, biased, and slanderous user. You have zero legitimacy, and zero basis to call anyone other than yourself a shill."

syriancivilwar,3deebh,Guck_Mal,4,Wed Jul 15 18:09:25 2015 UTC,Coordination with YPG might have made them think they didn't need to. Also the Syrian forces in the area amount to an artillery regiment and ndf militias. They are probably worried about overextension

They believe in the autonomous Cantons being part of a Democratic Syria.  The NDF are the local militia of the Assad regime, a Ba'athist entity that - at the end of the day - exists because Assad controls the secret police and the Syrian Arab Army.  Right now, both the YPG and the regime agree that fighting IS - who wants to kill both of them - is a higher priority.  TLDR : Because they are shooting at the same people."

On top of that leftists get easily fooled by antisemitic Iran and Hezbollah because they fight against ""western imperialism"" despite being horribly oppressive regimes that threatened Israelis with genocide in the past and more US influence probably would help them, rather than hurt them.

In this conflict the pillars of the life for many Sunnis got destroyed, so they searching for a halt which keeps their life straight.

It is pretty logical that this system is not desirable for countries like Turkey, USA or Great Britain, but the basic prerequisites are completley different there than in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan or Syria.   Gulf states only function at all because of massive oil money   They are pretty good investors too. They dont only make money through their oil, but they also invested heavily on the stock exchange. They own a huge chunck of a lot of Western companies and guess who benefited from the record rise of the stock stange since the crash 2007? The people who suffered from this were the common Western depositors, because of the low interest rates on assets.   Fantastically poor nation, with a repressive police state.   It is a horrible place to live, but still the Taliban are tough, they survived the American bloodthirstiness and their subsequent occupation and it is clear that they will play an increasing role in post-occupation Afghanistan. This country would be a though spot anyway, it was never rich and civil society got destroyed with the invasion of the Soviets in 1979, dont forget out of a population of 15 million, 1 million got killed and 5 million got wounded and this in a rural society with very bad acces to health care. It often needs strict regimes then to keep the mayhem in check and the Pashtuns are doing it with their honour codex and the strict interpretation of Sharia law. BTW I think the USA is a pretty ruthless state too, dont forget about 1% of the population is behind bars, just from my perspective this is pretty sick too and I wouldnt whish to live there either."

syriancivilwar,3dimmi,bgd_guy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"Well, there is a lot of context behind those murders. The thing is, there is a massive political struggle ongoing currently in Bangladesh, where the so-called ""leftist""* party is currently engaged in a violent struggle against the so-called ""rightist"" party. The current party has been hanging the leaders of a small so-called ""Islamist"" party after accusing them of ""war crimes"" (in reality its just a kangaroo court with only hearsay evidence). Hundreds of activists, mostly on the ""rightist"" side have been killed by the police and government mostly in 2013. After that I guess the rightists have become much more radicalised and some of them most likely have carried out the murders in revenge, since those bloggers were staunchly pro-government. But it should be kept in mind, that these are politically/religiously motivated murders and not legal.

syriancivilwar,3dimmi,Yasu3,-3,Thu Jul 16 20:42:12 2015 UTC,The thing is Salafism is rooted in culture Leftism as we saw in Arab and Central Asian Muslim World was not. Islam will always be there and Islam will naturally lead to Salafism.
syriancivilwar,3dimmi,Daario1,-2,Thu Jul 16 21:59:52 2015 UTC,"Communism mostly self-destructed. For Salafism to die, it would have to be discredited in a similar fashion. They create their fabled Islamic State, and oh actually it's not sunshine and lollypops but just another brutal dictatorial regime. It's completely obvious what will happen, but not to the supporters who are true believers. You'd then need 50 or more years for new generations to become disillusioned with it. But that would require letting IS win, which we can't do since they're so genocidal, and it runs the risk of them completely indoctrinating future generations. If they completely limit education to just religious teaching, they could create many generations of people who know nothing of the world outside of Salafist thinking."
syriancivilwar,3dimmi,2A1ZA,4,Fri Jul 17 04:12:56 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Salafi Jihadism is only a small part of the Salafi ideology. I thought for the most part that Salafis were apolitical and had a live and let live ideals. Maybe I'm wrong.   If we're talking about Islamism as a political movement, which seems to be manifested to the extreme with Salafi Jihadism, then I think you're right. It's going to take a while for it to die down."
syriancivilwar,3dimmi,UGRection,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"I'd underline that. The point of political relevance is if a religious philosophy is (a) considered a personal path or (b) transformed into a totalitarian political ideology. The latter is called Islamism, with the Sharia as its tool. Reading recommendation on the open society and its enemies is Karl Popper.  I see no problem if some Salafist wants to personally live the way as he thinks Mr. Mohammed had lived. However, I see a fundamental problem is someone wants to dictate his Sharia upon society as a whole (which is the definition of Islamism), thus rejecting the concept of the open society. Actually, I do even consider non-Salafist, ""moderate"" Islamists (like the ""Muslim Brotherhood"" type) a problem more deserving of our attention than Salafist Islamists."

syriancivilwar,3dimmi,kebabji,0,Thu Jul 16 16:46:22 2015 UTC,"Jihadi Salafism is a splinter of a splinter of Sunnism. The majority of Sunnis already reject it. However, it will remain prominent on the world stage as long as three things remain true:   Gulf states throw their largesse behind it; the Muslim World is ravaged by conflict and political failure; and  jihadi propaganda is able to target disillusioned Muslims so effectively."
syriancivilwar,3dimmi,cubebulb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:19:40 2015 UTC,"And those things exist because of a lack of democracy, social justice, and independence.   Gulf states do not support Salafi jihadists, individual donors do. Individual donors who tend to be quite influential and difficult to sideline. The claim that Saudi is funding ISIS assumes Saudi Arabia feels safe with having ISIS around, and that couldn't be farther from the truth. ISIS, like Al-Qaida, despises Saudi Arabia.   The only reason jihadists propaganda is so good is because it's catering to legitimate concerns that no one else is targeting. It may be propaganda, but Al-Qaida's grievances are shared by many, and while people may not support their methodology, they very well support their ideology.   What it will take these groups to dissappear and become irrelevant, is if their grievances become irrelevant to the general population. But of course, no one really cares about what the people think, and then folks wonder why these groups are able to attract people."

syriancivilwar,3de7dk,DickCheneyProfited1b,2,Sun Jul 19 01:01:08 2015 UTC,"I would not count on a secular Syria happening. My best case albeit rather unlikely scenario is the Syrian gov. leadership is toppled and mid-level people take over and strike a deal with the rebels. The top level people in the Syrian gov. are punished in a reasonable manner and perhaps those lower in the security branches are as well. Everyone else gets amnesty. Together they form a moderate Islamist gov. that respects all branches of Islam and other minority groups and permits an autonomous Rojava in the North, and they all fight ISIS.   I don't see anything inherently wrong with Islamism if the large majority of people actually want it, though I disagree with some of the restrictions it may put on people (for instance depending on what the government wants to enforce - restricting people's sexuality) and having a state centered around religion may at times in all likelihood create problems for minority groups. I also probably would not want to live permanently in an Islamist country.  edit- I forgot about Al-Qaeda. That's a more difficult question as it seems like rebel groups get along better with AQ."

syriancivilwar,3de7dk,sgamsterdam,18,Wed Jul 15 17:42:45 2015 UTC,most americans can't distinguish communist views from socialist or social democratic
syriancivilwar,3de7dk,starryplough718,3,Wed Jul 15 18:00:51 2015 UTC,"Guilty as charged. I think it's a translation issue. In America,  ""Socialist"" and ""Communist"" are frequently interchangeable.

I'm basically an anarchist but when I go to protests I stay the hell away from the ""anarchists"" who think waving a black flag while burning down the city will make us all free. I'm sure you have similar complaints about your Socialist circles."
syriancivilwar,3de7dk,freedoommagazine,12,Wed Jul 15 19:09:41 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late to the conversation, but in material terms:  ""In 2012, the PYD launched what it originally called the Social Economy Plan, which would later be renamed the People’s Economy Plan (PEP). The PEP was based on the writings of Öcalan and the lived experiences of Kurds in North Kurdistan (southern Turkey). Traditional “private property” was abolished in late 2012, meaning all buildings, land, and infrastructure fell under control of the various city councils. This did not mean people no longer owned their homes or businesses, however. The councils implemented an “ownership by use” sovereign principle, a principle that could not be overturned by any council. Ownership by use means that when a building like a home or a business is being used by a person or persons, the users would in fact own the land and structures but would not be able to sell them on an open market. Öcalan wrote that use ownership is what prevents speculation and capital accumulation which in turn leads to exploitation. Aside from property owned by use, in principle any other property would become commons. This abolishing of private property did not extend to commodities like automobiles, machines, electronics, furniture, etc. but was limited to land, infrastructure, and structures...  ""The commons encompasses land, infrastructure, and buildings not owned by individuals but held in stewardship by the councils.  Councils can turn over these public goods to individuals to be used. Commons are conceived of as a way to provide both a safety net for those without resources and a way to maximize use of the material resources of the community. Commons also include the ecological aspects of the region including water, parks, wildlife and wilderness, and even most livestock. According to Dr. Ahmad Yousef, an economic co-minister, three-quarters of traditional private property is being used as commons and one quarter is still being owned by use of individuals. The economic plan (PEP) posits that the commons are robust enough economically that there is no need for taxes, and since the beginning of the Rojava revolution there have been no taxes of any type...  ""Worker administration is the third leg of the stool of the economic plan. Workers are to control the means of production in their workplace through worker councils that are responsible to the local councils. According to the Ministry of Economics, worker councils have only been set up for about one third of the enterprises in Rojava so far. Worker councils are coordinated by the various economic ministries and local councils to assure a smooth flow of goods, supplies, and other essentials. The PEP also calls for all economic activity in the cantons to be ecologically sound. It is unclear who has responsibility for this, whether it is the workers’ councils, the local councils, the City Councils, or the Peoples’ assemblies. Throughout the various statements from the economic ministries, one sees mention over and over again about the primacy of ecologically sensible industry—but details are lacking.  ""The PEP is also vague when it comes to its relationship with other economies inside and outside of Syria. A substantial amount of the current economic activity in the region comes from black market oil being sold outside the region. In Autumn, 2014, representatives of Rojava travelled around Europe looking to create “trading partners” and seemed to be suggesting a standard free market policy, while at the same time eliminating banks and other financial institutions inside Rojava. The Rojava canton principles also clearly state that the region will not produce its own money or bonds, so it is unclear how such trading relationships between other governments would actually come to pass even if the embargo is lifted.""

syriancivilwar,3de7dk,flintsparc,6,Wed Jul 15 19:15:42 2015 UTC,"Considering the ""ownership of the means of production"" by the workers, it's by definition some form of socialism. It's partly why I support Rojava."

syriancivilwar,3de7dk,flintsparc,5,Wed Jul 15 19:39:46 2015 UTC,"Its not a huge jump in Rojava.  Most of the agricultural land and industrial capital in northern Syria was already owned by the state (controlled by the Ba'ath).  The Kurdish minority were ""stateless"", not regarded as citizens and definitely didn't own/control the land/infrastructure.  When the state collapsed and and the small bourgeoisie fled the area; PYD/TEV-DEM stepped in and reorganized the economy.   With the war still going on, the YPG also has to get what it needs.  A lot of this can be criticized as ""only"" ""war communism""; but its socialism nonetheless.  The question is open whether TEV-DEM would continue this after the war, but ideologically--they say they would."

If the government pulls back from Zabadani then JaF stops shelling Fou'aa and Kafraya. Its still terror-bombing a largely civilian population with ordnance.

syriancivilwar,3dg8g3,1337Bolshevik,3,Thu Jul 16 00:58:07 2015 UTC,Its both. The US has usually excreted pressure to exclude Iran from peace conferences. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25820373
syriancivilwar,3dg8g3,LockedOnTarget,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:50:14 2015 UTC,"The Iran deal was a major defeat for the US. For almost 40 years they have tried everything (Economic sanctions, pushing Saddam to attack Iran, sabotage, invading its surrounding countries (although there were other reasons for that as well.)) to subdue Iran. But with this deal they are pulling back from all of those acts without having achieved anything. Also the deal de facto means that they accept Iran as a major power and a nuclear threshold state. In this they also concede that Syria is in Iran's sphere of influence - something they wanted to change by bombing Syria only a few years ago. I'm no fan of the clerics, but the deal did signal the end of 40 years of aggression and bullying by the biggest military and economic world power, against a far smaller nation."
syriancivilwar,3dg8g3,Ian_W,9,Fri Jul 17 09:38:07 2015 UTC,Why cant we have both ?
syriancivilwar,3dg8g3,ofarrizzle,3,Thu Jul 16 01:04:19 2015 UTC,"Rhetorically, it's a big shift that puts the US at odds with the exiled political opposition, whose refusal to attend a conference featuring Iran essentially barred Iran from attending Geneva II. If their biggest sponsor is now saying that Iran deserves a seat, it would be hard for them to block Iranian participation in the future.   But that's probably a good thing. Tehran holds the keys to the Presidential Palace in Damascus, and pretending otherwise would make substantive negotiations much more difficult."
syriancivilwar,3dg8g3,Leadback,4,Thu Jul 16 03:17:33 2015 UTC,"but the exiled opposition has lost credibility over the years, they do not control ground forces and very few on the ground activist actually acknowledge/recognize them. And on the ground the resistance actually is facing iran whether in form of advisers to SAA, Hezbollah, NDF etc. So maybe it's just an acknowledgement of the reality.  On the different note I also wonder whether eventually the West would have to recognize the influence of JaN, al Sham etc hardline Islamist, because without them any dialogue will be just tokenism and legitimizing them would be very difficult for the West!"

Of course they both have their traditional allies to deal with; Russia with Iran and Assad and the US with the Gulf axis and Israel.   Despite that I think this rapprochement with Russia in the Middle East is a good thing. If the Minsk Accords are fully implemented and Russia cools off with their Ukraine interference, the sanctions can be lifted. Ending the western isolation of Russia opens up significant avenues to deal with Middle Eastern issues in a time where instability is rocking the region.

Most likely they'll hold out for a few months then apply for asylum to the U.S or some European country. They'll have a better chance of getting in bc they served with the U.S opposition and ""their families are in danger"".   I can't imagine anything else. And anyone who can is just romanticizing the situation and not grounded in reality. The FSA/Islamist have already given their country to foreigners.

syriancivilwar,3deush,NotVladeDivac,4,Thu Jul 16 02:23:14 2015 UTC,"The first 60 are more of a proof of concept than an effective force.

In syria these guys will probably be the best trained fighters out there on the battlefield. even compared to the overrated Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies.   The US TOW program ran by the cia has shown how 'undertrained' they are by causing massive damage with little casualties.   you fly the US flag, yet you shill for iran all over this site. horrible, you should try shilling for the US in Iran and see what the Iranian security apparatus thinks about it."

At least the Iranians have a sense of self respect and integrity. The Americans completely lack independent judgement. American foreign policy is decided by Gulf lobbyist. Today the Wahhabis and tomorrow whoever has money. What a joke.   Case in point: Todays shooting. Both father and son were radicalized at home in the U.S. Hate speech isn't coming from illiterate conservative farmers from rural Muslims regions.

Over one year of airstrikes has done much to halt their advances."

The reason the Quran has remained unchanged is because it's designed to be fairly open to interpretation (so dipshits who want to change its ""meaning"" can do so without having to alter the Quran itself) with a solid and actual meaning if you look deep enough. People who want it for convenience or an agenda will simply skim the surface of it taking whatever interpretation they want, while real scholars dig deeper and understand it's more authentic meanings.

They're still going to jail.   the court did not hand down a murder sentence on the ground that “the crime was not committed against Turkey and the lack of an agreement on extraditions.”   So they're saying it didn't happen in Turkey and there isn't a treaty with Syria on extradition so they cant charge them based on what happened there.  The reason other countries in Europe charge people for murder based on evidence from Syria/Iraq is because they have laws against crimes against humanity and stuff like that.

syriancivilwar,3ddejp,Smaugswaywardscale,3,Wed Jul 15 19:49:34 2015 UTC,"It's doubtful that they executed locals, unless they were with ISIS.  In non-ISIS jihadi groups, such as JMA and the likes, the trials and executions are intentionally left to do for local members to avoid possible tensions along the ethnic lines.   An Istanbul court sentenced the two men to seven and a half years in prison each with charges of being a member of the terror organization. A police criminal report said Abdurakmanov might be one of the militants in a video which was uploaded on YouTube allegedly showing the beheading of two priests.    So, the murder accusations were not proven, and they were just jailed for participating in a terror organization. A click-baity title as usual."

No two strikes are ever the same...You should know that, that's the first thing you're taught when dealing with Explosives. Keep telling yourself whatever you'd like, from my experience I am 100% confident in my ability to distinguish between a near hit and a hit.

Support/opposition is tied to geographic/national/cultural identity, for example Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is supportive of Hezbollah due to their generous financial and moral support whereas most Syrian Sunnis are opposed/hostile to Hezbollah due to their operations against Syrian rebel organizations.  It's tough to generalize and I believe more Sunnis would be supportive of Hezbollah were they not influenced by geopolitical spheres, and, more to the point, fear of Iranian hegemony. As Iranian power grows we may see things change as they expand into the region (eg: Turkey)."

syriancivilwar,3ddsil,DatDamnWolfy,2,Wed Jul 15 20:15:20 2015 UTC,"True when it comes to Christians in Syria... Christians in Lebanon never supported Hezbollah outside of small groups like Franjiyeh and others that belong to the SNP. Aoun, Jaajaa, Kornet Shahwen (majority of Christians) never supported Hezbollah.  Aoun has partnered with them for election/political purposes before the war in Syria.

Or maybe the fact that Christian populations are shrinking all over the Muslim world due to decades of oppression by the Muslim majority demographic   Sigh... Here we go again.  Muslims don't oppress Christians in general. Most are treated with respect and only a tiny minority of Muslims treat Christians bad. The stories you hear, are probably from converts. If a Muslim converts to Christianity he is opressed yes, but native christians are generally fine.   Also, Muslims have a waaaay higher birth rate. In some areas Christians used to be a majority. Homs, in Syria par example. But Muslims get more children, simple as it is. No oppression or whatsoever, that is just bullshit. Even most radical Muslims generally treat Christians well."

The 'muscular' Christian evangelical and conservative catholic movements associated with very strong and 'unconditional' support for Israel are very disproportionately strong in the US and perhaps Canada (I'm not 100%).  But imo behind the rhetoric it seems like a mixture of real politik concerns over Israel being the centrepiece of US control of the region, it being symbolic of a number of things, business and political ties and just straight money."

An army consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people of the earth at that time will come from Medina (to counteract them).[6]  Scholars and hadith commentators suggest that the words Romans refers to Christians.[7] The hadith further relates the subsequent Muslim victory, followed by the peaceful takeover of Constantinople with invocations of takbir and tasbih, and finally the defeat of Anti-Christ following the return and descent of Jesus Christ.[8][9]  For this reason the name Dabiq was chosen for propaganda purposes as the title of the official online magazine of the Islamic State (IS)."

Surrounded it is no threat.     1) Can the Iraqi army capture Fallujah without raising the city to the ground?   The vast bulk of this fighting will be the PMU's (Shia militias). They taking the led and the Iraq Army will be focused more on Ramadi. Will probably be some Iraq Army but not much.   On the question itself, everything I have read makes me think Fallujah will be raised to the ground by the time this is over. Several reasons. One, this isn't Tikrit where ISIS fought for a week and then retreated most of their men. This will be a fight to the last man.  Two, unlike Tikrit, ISIS have been in control of Fallujah for over a year. Every building in the city is rigged with explosives and IED's, much more advanced ones than 2004 Fallujah. The amount of losses and damage that will be done will be massive.   Third reason why the city will be hugely damaged is the same as reason why it was levelled during the Marine offensives. Saving soldiers lives. In Tikrit during the first weeks hundreds of militiamen were killed, dozens a day. In Fallujah they will have to demolish buildings rather than risking lives clearing them. Otherwise the death toll in the militias will be to great.   In short I fully expect it to be turned into another Homs.    Does the Iraqi army apply tactics/information learned from this attack and thereby use a different tactic.     The Iraqi Army is woeful. The PMU's (or Shia militias) are not yet some great Hezbollah-like force. They only a year old, training has been minimal so far (most get 3 months). Hezbollah in Lebanon was built up through 30 years of wars and training. They may apply different tactics, and learned some from Tikrit, but urban warfare is urban warfare, still involved fighting in alleyways and clearing apartment buildings on room at a time. It will be bloody.    How important is Fallujah   It's important. 43 miles from Baghdad, almost fully Sunni, poor, conservative, and a stronghold for the Sunni insurgency, major axis of the ""Triangle of Death"" as the Americans called the area. They say most of the car bombs that go off in Baghdad are assembled in Fallujah. No doubt why the city was one of the first to fall to ISIS. Having the city, only a hour drive from Baghdad center, in ISIS hands, means Baghdad will never be secure."
syriancivilwar,3depvn,gonzolegend,3,Wed Jul 15 21:13:54 2015 UTC,"Completely agree on all of your points, solid write up but when you say ""Baghdad will never be secure"" do you mean Baghdad would be at risk of being besieged or just that it'll be at risk of car bombings and the like? The later I agree with but ISIS holding Fallujah I don't think puts Baghdad at an existential risk."
syriancivilwar,3depvn,AlexanderTheLame,2,Thu Jul 16 01:43:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I meant never secure from car bombings. Baghdad is so big I don't think there is an existential risk to the city. But with Fallujah in ISIS hands will always be weekly bombings going off in the city.
syriancivilwar,3depvn,gonzolegend,6,Thu Jul 16 11:05:04 2015 UTC,"Some elements of the Iraqi army where involved in the second battle of Fallujah so they probably learned something. However it is likely that the main force leading the assault will be Shia militias. In terms of importance it would be a propaganda victory as Fallujah was one of the first places taken by ISIS and has been a hotbed of resistance to the Iraqi government for years, although as you said in your question it will probably be hard to hold."
syriancivilwar,3depvn,carlislecommunist,6,Wed Jul 15 21:15:51 2015 UTC,Fallujah will be leveled for three main reasons:   Shia militias do not have the training or technology to match a group of Jihadis who have had over a year to set up defenses and who will fight to the death (especially since they are cut off). So they will have to resort to long range bombardment.  If Fallujah ends up being a meat grinder it will be because the militias showed restraint.  Iraq security forces may believe that having a hardened sunni enclave so close to Baghdad is too much of security risk in the long run and so ethnic cleansing is in order. Fallujah does not seem to be economically important.
syriancivilwar,3depvn,borhas,3,Wed Jul 15 23:30:06 2015 UTC,"This is one of the few times where I'm pretty sure we're all in agreement about the way this battle is going to go, which is extremely poorly for everyone involved with the possible exception of ISIS, who even if they lose it are going to get a propaganda goldmine, victory or defeat, given the way we expect the battle to go. Civilians are going to get fucked the hardest though.   Its mainly PMUs, like everyone else has been saying, not IA. This is important because by their very nature they're going to give less of a shit about civilian casualties, since this is pretty much an exclusively Sunni city. Can they? Probably not, if they want to win. They don't have the training, the logistical/tactical support, the manpower, or the equipment for it. They also have no incentive to risk their men's lives when they could just demolish the building. If by ""different tactics"" you mean ""blow everything up even harder, despite the fact that there still will be thousands of IEDs waiting for them when they enter the city."" Tikrit is a better example of how this is going to go, I think, except much, much much worse. Not even sure if its going to be captured in this offensive, to tell you the truth. Long fucking time. Really depends on how many casualties the PMUs are willing to sustain and whether ISIS wants to actually hold the city or pull another Tikrit and leave behind a suicide rearguard. If the PMUs take horrific casualties in a quick take over, and ISIS only leaves a token rear force again, maybe a month or two (this is the absolute best case scenario time-wise). There's undoubtedly going to be an insurgency there after pretty much any ""victory,"" and if ISIS is going for that, they could ""let"" the city fall Tikrit style if they wanted to hold back the majority of their force for an insurgency. I seriously doubt they will though; like I said, there's going to be an insurgency either way. God I wish I knew. I'm seconding this question. Also: how many men were involved in taking Tikrit. Hell no. Its going to be an active insurgency for a long, long, long, long time. It's ISIS' first city, it's one of their strongholds, its right next to Baghdad. Economically, its important but not vital to ISIS, I doubt the Iraqis consider it economically. Its main importance comes from the fact that its decently sized, fully Sunni, and right next to Baghdad."

Damascus is pretty safe even for the President and advisers but even pre-war it wasn't like a security detail in the rafters would be unimaginable. About Tartus though - What makes you say that? It would harm morale if the President was seen to desert his post in the capital by fleeing like that. It would lend the impression that the city was at risk of falling which of course it is not, so even if it were that would be avoided until the last second. He could leave Damascus at any time so the only way such a move would even be contemplated is if (after years and a million or two dead) Damascus were about to fall."
syriancivilwar,3dd3ty,WorldsupportsBashar,11,Wed Jul 15 11:00:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think people would know he left, since he shows up in public so rarely. Maybe they fly him into Damascus for important meetings/speeches and keep him elsewhere?"

syriancivilwar,3dd3ty,WorldsupportsBashar,-1,Wed Jul 15 23:47:50 2015 UTC,"Its an important detail, and it just reminded me of the ""Assad or we burn"" the country saying."
syriancivilwar,3dd3ty,TheCapeman,-1,Thu Jul 16 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you a question. Bashar al-Assad is President. I respect his position and his person for not bowing, bending the knee, and selling the country and its position in the world off to the highest bidder while running away. It requires fortitude, principles, and determination. Yet before President Assad the younger there was another president which preceded him and there will be another which succeeds him. I have an uncle in the SAA, two of my cousin's closest friends from childhood. Do you really think that this is what it's about? That's what they're risking life and limb for - President Assad?   He is the leader of the nation, not perfect, but a man who has a vision for Syria and will not allow our families to become the boot-kissers of foreigners like the Jordanians and so many other Arabs have disgracefully been reduced to. Now the war has also transformed into one in which the struggle is for Syrian unity (territorial integrity and political cohesion) and keeping a government in place capable of and motivated to assert Syrian interests. President Assad is not a divine creature from above all perfection between us if we're speaking frank, and if he passed away tomorrow in a tranquil state or was martyred, the war will continue under different leadership.  I'm immensely proud of those I know who do fight for Syria, and it is Syria they sacrifice for, not President Assad. President Assad himself is a former serviceman who sacrifices daily risks to his person and his mental energy for Syria, a servant of the nation, not the other way around."
syriancivilwar,3dd3ty,WorldsupportsBashar,3,Thu Jul 16 08:30:38 2015 UTC,"This war sprung from the peaceful protests (that killed a few policemen in arsons) against Assad.  A fight against Assad and his dynasty and his name, not against Syria. The Syrians who were protesting against Assad did so in hopes of a better future, free from corruption of the Syrian deep state and it's cancerous foundations.   Now it isn't much of a secret that most of the current rebels are fighting to implement Sharia-oriented order in Syria, is this what the original protesters risked their life and limb for?   No. Or maybe. Every protester had his intentions (which were all thrown in the ""terrorist"" bucket by Syrian media), just like every soldier has his own intentions.   But at the end of the day, our fights come out of preserving/changing the Syrian state.    If you would ask a Syrian soldier now what he is sacrificing his life for, he'll tell you to preserve the sovereign status of the Syrian nation, to protect their families, to be able to eat, sleep and go to work in a secure and stable nation, and some even died because of their Ba'athist beliefs.  But you cannot tell me that the war effort was not based around preserving Assad as the head of state. Do you have any idea how important the Assad family is to the power elite in Syria? That's where all the connections are. And if Bashar was deposed and executed, and had his entire direct family exiled, an Assad would succeed him.   So either you are in disbelief over the fact how a supposed man and leader of a nation can drag his entire country into turmoil to remain the head of state, or you don't put much thought into how vital he is to continue what his father started several decades ago.  I too have family in the SAA (mainly in Jobar, Qaboun and Homs), and in the rebel armies in and around Dimasq. I respect servicemen, as they put their life on the line and fight bravely, for what however that is where we differ I'm afraid.    and will not allow our families to become the boot-kissers of foreigners like the Jordanians and so many other Arabs have disgracefully been reduced to.    Somehow I don't agree that being bootkissers of fellow Syrians is any better.   And realize how I tried to put myself in the shoes of the same people arresting my uncles and cousins and friends, because fighting as a soldier really shouldnt be no big deal, just like demanding basic human rights as a citizen, yet you can't spend a second being ""frank"" beyond admitting that Assad is not a deity? How far does your apparent inability to sympathize with these ""traitors"" and ""non-Syrians"" go really?    Edited"
syriancivilwar,3dd3ty,TheCapeman,0,Thu Jul 16 09:14:45 2015 UTC,I personally think that Tartus would be more dangerous as if a sudden attack were to occur he would be relatively trapped much like Gaddafi was. Damascus is fairly safe for the time being and I've not heard any reports of even Shelling around the Presidential Palace.
syriancivilwar,3dd3ty,MacLammond,12,Wed Jul 15 11:55:07 2015 UTC,"The Russians would just cart him away to sea.  Very easy escape actually.  Gaddafis real failure was lack of powerful allies.  Tartus is a very good bet.  Allawite stronghold, Russian naval base.  Damascus is way too divided and close to the fighting. Numerous generals have been killed there.    Really anywhere there's any sort of ethnic divide expect Assad to not be there."
syriancivilwar,3dd3ty,perestroika12,7,Wed Jul 15 13:34:55 2015 UTC,"Didn't look at it that way, good point. I still can't believe that Gaddafi was that delusional right up until the end...He had no chance of surviving that conflict once the No-Fly Zone went into effect."
syriancivilwar,3dd3ty,MacLammond,-8,Wed Jul 15 13:37:45 2015 UTC,"Call it delusional - I'd call it bravery. Here's a man who would rather go down fighting for what he believed (and doubtless I would agree) was the most righteous and fundamentally important cause in the world - his country's survival as an intact and independent nation. It was laughable at the time when some crude propagandists had the gall to call him cowardly. He fell in army camo alongside his people in his home city resisting to the last the invaders of his country and their proxies and collaborators. He would rather die than raise a white flag or flee the country and live in luxury as he could have done early on (in the first month or so even a Western country like Sweden or Canada was viable and allegedly floated as an option to induce him to leave quickly) and die and fall as a martyr he did like many other a great Arab shaheed in history.   Libya's resistance in that war against the per-eminent military and economic superpower and all the clients and assets of its empire, fighting until the Libyan Army was effectively destroyed in the end in the spirit of Omar Mukhtar like the first Libyan nationalists who defied the Italian colonization - this example of resistance humbled the world and made an impression on Syria itself. And like Mukhtar who the Italian occupiers hanged in chains, I suspect brother Qaddafi in the future will occupy the hall of their highest national martyrs once the control and hold of the native and foreign forces alike who wrecked Libya is broken over the country."
syriancivilwar,3dd3ty,WorldsupportsBashar,5,Wed Jul 15 15:01:53 2015 UTC,He should have fought from the capital and killed himself when it fell. Lot more dignified than being raped by a bayonet.
syriancivilwar,3dd3ty,azural,4,Wed Jul 15 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"Tripoli's defenses collapsed and the city fell relatively quickly compared to what the Libyan high command was probably anticipating so Sirte which had repulsed numerous previous offensives, was still standing, and was also a major bastion of popular support for the Libyan government made perfect sense to designate as a redoubt and temporary capital. He fell honorably after being bombed amid a situation from which most Western leaders and leaders on a Western payroll would have fled from in their private modes of transport months before rather than overseeing the battlefield. That the same people who ordered his assassination using boys sitting in Nevada firing a remotely operated drone label him cowardly is pathetic and shows you the lengths to which political discourse is upside down today."

Apparently the goal was to settle the Homs region with friendly Alawites and Iranian Shias.  Arab media basically spit out propaganda so that wasn't unexpected. However Western media really showed how crap they were by reporting it. At no time did they notice that the vast majority of Sunni towns and villages didn't rebel until the rebels attacked them. That Aleppo the biggest Sunni city had thousands of volunteers fighting and dying to keep the rebels out when the city was surrounded and cut off from government territory. That Sunni civilians were running to Latakia and Tartous for safety and the fact that those two provinces were emptied of fighters to be used in Damascus, Homs and Aleppo.

Could also have been your own children reporting you to the intelligence, your neighbor, or just some guy who doesn't really like you. Was it effective at curbing dissent? Yes, frankly. So effective that it kept away thousands of Syrians from returning, that is until the Syrian revolution began.   Those few Homsis who gave themselves up under a supposed amnesty, not a lot is known about what transpired from there. Nothing too good, otherwise there are a lot of rebels who would lay down their arms to return home to their families.

syriancivilwar,3dcw4e,kebabji,2,Wed Jul 15 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone in Syria was under the impression that Bashar would forgive and forget.    And he will have to stop trying to torture & kill them at the very least if he wants to survive long term or rule anything else than a charred ruin on 20% of his former country. In war you don't always get everything you want. If his only end game is ""everyone that isn't in latakia/damascus will be tortured to death in a camp"" i suspect he's going to be executed by one of his own at some point, if he survives that far.   Syria after '82 was a terrifying place, army pickups and trucks would stop in the middle of the street, the soldiers would jump out and club a person or two, dump them in the back and drive them to an intelligence building.   Basically what's happening now, isn't it ? Oh except now there are even jihadis he once released years ago too that tries to kill everyone on top of it.   Was it effective at curbing dissent? Yes, frankly   And look where it got him long term. The syrian revolution is the very product of those actions. Anywhere else (apart yemen & libya but that's due to jihadis & Saleh trying to stage a come back and restarting the war ) the arab spring came to an end. Yet in Syria the wanton loss of line continues day after day.   Those few Homsis who gave themselves up under a supposed amnesty, not a lot is known about what transpired from there   They got safe passage to FSA areas last i heard ? (probably due to international pressure) then they blended in the pop i guess.   The Syrian regime doesn't care to employ any other options aside from brutality and torture,    Then the FSA will have to fight him to their dying breath i guess.    it has always been ""this way or the chopping block"".    And right now it looks like ""the chopping block only; nice & easy prisonner"". Nice job from the gov.  edit : sorry for the tone, i realize my post is overly agressive and i had a bad day i guess."
syriancivilwar,3dcw4e,justkjfrost,7,Wed Jul 15 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha we're on the same page with everything. The besieged Homsi rebels were two groups, the larger group which was allowed to go North, and the smaller group which decided to take the government's amnesty offer. The latter group kind of disappeared, some have said they were killed or imprisoned, but the last news regarding them was that they were undergoing special classes designed to reintroduce them to Syrian society. Even in amnesty, the rebels are not treated as having legitimate concerns, so the whole amnesty crap is useless anyways.   Also, on Syria post '82 and Syria now, the two are still somewhat different. The government can't put its resources to crushing internal dissent, so it doesn't. It has to concentrate on the larger forces such as ISIS and the rebels. If the two succumb to Assad, then the smaller dissenters will be dealt with with much greater brutality. Could be 14 years in prison for owning a motorcycle, and 6 months in prison for reading a leaflet."
syriancivilwar,3dcw4e,kebabji,9,Wed Jul 15 17:59:29 2015 UTC,May God help them.
syriancivilwar,3dcw4e,TheCapeman,4,Wed Jul 15 10:32:15 2015 UTC,"Absolutely shortsighted and foolish.  I've said it before and I'll say it again -- Assad needs to implement a repatriation policy. Much of these people have legitimate grievances, and the policy would be an agreement to ""forgive and forget"" so that Syria can move forward. We forgive them for being terrorist defectors collaborating with the worst of Syrian society, they forgive us for being brutal, malevolent, and the second worst of Syrian society.  Those 20,000 have people supporting them, and that effectively doubles or triples the number of individuals being targeted. It's a dumb policy, plain and simple."
syriancivilwar,3dcw4e,ihsw,8,Wed Jul 15 14:57:37 2015 UTC,"It's simple: Assad is just as radicalized and totalitarian as his worst Islamist enemies.  Expecting a fascist dictatorship that tortures thousands and terror-bombs its own people on a regular basis to make concessions and have delusional hopes of them making steps towards the opposition has simply no footing in reality. This policy perfectly fits with all other actions they've been doing so far.  Not that I really expected anything other from a brutal civil war that has lasted for years now. I'm just not in the least surprised - even though an amnesty might be beneficial to the regime, it realistically will not happen."
syriancivilwar,3dcw4e,MaslinuPoimal,-8,Wed Jul 15 15:54:38 2015 UTC,"He has. Any rebel who lays down his weapons is granted full amnesty, if he is Syrian. Many rebels have already accepted this."

I believe charles lister used the term ""closet moderates"".  Repeat that a few times to appreciate how fucked up that is. Closet Moderates.  Then just because Ahrar found a well spoken, well shaved, well dressed English speaker, they now get to write op-eds in the Washington post. What the fuck?   In the south, not much better. Instead of fucking learning from all the other cases in Syria, people now think a bunch of payed off tribes are the new moderate force that will destroy ISIS, SAA, Nusra and all the other terrorists. Then, even though the southern front has spent a lot of time trash talking nusra, they still work as one. No one cares.  Finally people actually think that the guys with the black seal flag are moderate freedom fighters because they claim a neutral position towards ISIS and work with southern front against SAA.

The reservation says the group will continue to recruit and accept 16- and 17-year-olds but not have them perform military functions.   That is not even bad, I mean, UK lets you join the Army at 16 and you can't get deployed until 18. Sounds similar here. Even 15 in combat is permitted if absolutely necessary by Article 77(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I."

syriancivilwar,3dd31z,flintsparc,5,Wed Jul 15 17:25:03 2015 UTC,"This is the second article that HRW has wrote about the Kurds that has been completely unfair and naive.. In this case the YPG has made it quite clear that no young people under legal age should join when they agreed to this ban, yet they themselves are admitting that it's unfortunately happening in some cases;   The letter noted that, on June 13, the YPG had demobilized 27 boys and, on April 20, the YPJ had demobilized 16 girls. In addition, seven YPG officers had been punished for accepting child soldiers – three expelled from the force and four demoted, although the group gave no names or dates.   YPG obviously agreed to this because they care about their young, they see no benefit for children to be fighting.  Being really naive is acting like the Kurds are nice and cozy with this conflict and that it's as if they're choosing to go to war, and as if the Kurds are fit for this.. the truth is they're outnumbered and outgunned.. Go north of Rojava, turkey is another ISIS for them, go south it's ISIS trying to wipe them off the map or it's SAA just waiting to have the power to turn on them.  The HRW is just so out of touch.. Instead of making stupid articles like this saying they are violating the child soldier ban, making it sound as if it's intended.. More like write the truth that they're simply not enforcing it properly or fully, that's in a sense fair.  I completely agree the YPG should be held to higher standards and should meet them, but morals standards and ethics should not result in an advantage for the enemy, which would then result in loss of life. In this case a young person who wishes to sign up should be guided and trained until he's fit to serve, not be kept out and invited to train for 2 weeks before being sent to the front when he/she finally reaches that age."

I doubt Russia's just going to abandon Assad, but if the calculation is that getting rid of ISIS is in their interests, or that deescalating the situation might improve their strategy in the region, the US and western security council members would probably jump at a chance to bring the U.N. into the conversation."

syriancivilwar,3dbal5,NotVladeDivac,4,Wed Jul 15 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"No. I don't think that's an accurate read.  The reality is that Russia, from the U.S. perspective, obstinately undermined early attempts to hold Assad responsible - via standing against U.N inspections and sanctions...via sending weapon shipments. Indeed, there has been a marked cooling of relations between Russia and the west over the past 2-3 years and it's been in these satellite issues where the impact has been most seriously felt.  But, given that the horse Mr. Putin has backed seems to be in a stalemate, he's finally picking up the phone. It's an assessment of Russia's mind on the matter, nothing else.   The U.S. has always been against the sunni extremists that make up larger and larger pieces of the opposition in Syria - it was the singular reason they refrained from arming anyone earlier in the conflict. Instead, we tried to find political pressure to bring to bear via sanctions, etc. We've only gotten involved militarily reluctantly, because even though we don't like the extreme elements on any side, ISIS is too vicious to leave standing. But, notice that we haven't been coordinating with Assad. We've basically been working around him. I don't think, domestically, we'd have an easy time justifying working with a guy who's committed such heinous acts against his people (regardless of what people might think of us)."
syriancivilwar,3dbal5,pfunkmort,13,Wed Jul 15 13:13:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why, but it feels more to me like what Obama was insinuating here is that he was able to use Assad as a bargaining chip to convince Putin to help pull the Iran deal together.  It should be noted that in the last week or two there has been a flurry of coalition air strikes against ISIS in and around Palmyra.  This didn't make a ton of sense at the time because most coalition strikes have been to soften up areas prior to a push by FSA / YPG and Palmyra is only threatened by SAA.  Now one has to wonder if that particular assist, and I'm sure several future ones, were tied to the Iran deal."

syriancivilwar,3dbal5,WestenM,5,Wed Jul 15 12:52:40 2015 UTC,"Putin also knows that the U.S. really does not have an acceptable dog in that particular fight.  The U.S. can support YPG only as far as traditional Kurdish lands are concerned.  Supporting them beyond that not only alienates Turkey, but it alienates the native Sunni population as well.  The threat of the U.S. suddenly escalating against Assad when the two most likely successors right now would be JAN or ISIS is almost non-existent.  If there was a negotiation regarding Assad, it wasn't around keeping the U.S. from going after him.  It was around convincing the U.S. to help out the SAA with air strikes when it could do so without raising too many eyebrows."
syriancivilwar,3dbal5,manifestDensity,5,Wed Jul 15 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"You're assuming that escalation could only occur in the context of caring what happens to Syria.  If the US wanted, it could easily let Turkey and KSA off the leash and let them pump billions of dollars worth of weapons into their various chosen proxy groups.  Most would, at best, make the US uncomfortable, but the US clearly prioritizes limiting jihadist groups to escalating against Assad.  I don't think Putin has any reason to think that will change, and he can make predictive policies accordingly, but it has nothing to do with capacity.  If the US wanted, Assad could look like Gaddafi.  Of course, opening the floodgates to achieve that probably wouldn't be worth it for American interests."

syriancivilwar,3dbal5,oblivionrecurs,25,Tue Jul 14 23:14:15 2015 UTC,"Maliki's positions and Assad's are nowhere near similar to each other.  Maliki was the ""democratically elected"" PM of Iraq who had been in power for just over 8 years.  Assad was been in power since 2000 and came into that position after his father died (and his brother, who had been groomed for the position, had been previously killed in a car crash).  His father seized power in 1970 after holding various positions within the Ba'ath party after their 1963 coup.  The Assad's and their key allies within and outside of the Alawite community have run Syria for 45 years.  They're not about to just hand things over.  Furthermore, Maliki isn't gone, he's now one of two vice presidents.  He doesn't have nearly the power he used to possess, but he's still in the government."
syriancivilwar,3dbal5,Gorthol,7,Tue Jul 14 23:57:16 2015 UTC,"Also, in Maliki's situation, he was strongly hated except for his admittedly extremely radical partisans. He really had no choice but to step down. Even many of the elements in the military he had replaced with his cronies didn't seem to stand behind him. I think the only reason he is kept in government in a very ceremonial position is so his partisans don't go making an insurgency.   After all, Maliki staged a failed coup last August. This was treason (punishable by death), but I don't think the Iraqi government had an interest in fighting another insurgent force and preferred a more diplomatic route, and it would have splintered the Islamic Dawa party."
syriancivilwar,3dbal5,sunbolts,2,Wed Jul 15 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"True, I meant that he was still in government as a riposte to the idea that he was expelled from government as many people want Assad to be."

syriancivilwar,3dbal5,Boerek1,14,Wed Jul 15 03:11:13 2015 UTC,"Eh..it does, he is leveraging the advance of the opposition against assads ally to convince them to help get Assad out, and place someone in who will maintain diplomatic ties with both Russia and the U.S. As rebels will disregard both.   ..he's saying it's better to share the pie than hold on to one that's growing moldy.. In my opinion the pie belongs to Syrians. Not Russians Americans or Iranis"
syriancivilwar,3dbal5,Herefordiscussion2,4,Tue Jul 14 23:45:17 2015 UTC,"place someone in who will maintain diplomatic ties with both Russia and the U.S.    And where should this guy come from? Hell, the US was only able to muster 62 rebels. Secondly I think Obama is more fine with Assad than most think, I am pretty sure he secretly bemoans it that Assad wasnt able to crush the opposition, so that there is a graveyard peace in Syria and he doesnt get asked about Syria again and he can be on his golf course or be on somekind of ceremony and grinning around or giving other people useful advices."
syriancivilwar,3dbal5,Boerek1,7,Wed Jul 15 00:08:49 2015 UTC,"The U.S. Government has no control over Assad and that is why it's bothersome for them. America would much rather have someone they can control in power than someone who is under control of Russia or Iran.   Most likely they're hoping for someone from within the Assad regime to step to the plate post Assad.   I fully expect obama to spend his days on a golf course following his presidency, and these issues all behind him, lol. Career politicians, you have to admire their sincerity, or lack thereof."
syriancivilwar,3dbal5,Herefordiscussion2,0,Wed Jul 15 00:16:38 2015 UTC,Obama sees Syria and the Middle East as a distraction. I'm sure he'd rather be focused on the South China Sea and preventing a war with China.

That has been the case for a while and it is their entire justification for supporting the regime whether in phone calls with heads of state or through propaganda outlets.  So Putin says what he says to literally anyone and anything that is listening. He is telling Ol' Barry ""Yeah, he's a dick. How do you feel about Al Qaeda and their friends running a country?

syriancivilwar,3dbal5,Gorthol,2,Wed Jul 15 03:02:15 2015 UTC,"Legitimized. At this point nobody in the west is going to see him as the good option, ever. If he starts winning significant military successes maybe the west could at least see him as a better option than a failed state or a Jihadist state, maybe even enough to work with him to fight a common enemy. But the only argument people ever really have in support of a dictator is that they are a dictator that brings stability, and right now he is just a dictator.

So there are groups of fighters concentrated in area's in Turkey, where by now they should have left.   This new strategy of them is visible because of the rise of groups like YDG-H which have been focusing on urban terror (new era oof warfare imo).   It could be possible that we say 'ok, go play in Syria, leave us alone' but the recent events in Turkey has shown us they're still trying to mess inside Turkey. And not to mention there are a shit ton of PKK linked people fighting in Syria.   So, for me it feels akin to trying to put out a fire in your frontyard when the fuel tank in your backyard is going to blow the fuck up.

syriancivilwar,3dcb1m,Reditski,3,Wed Jul 15 11:51:32 2015 UTC,"My personal belief is that the U.S. has guaranteed Turkey that it would not allow a Kurdish state. It simply can't allow it in Iraq and a Kurdish state in Syria would want to expand to areas it has ""claimed"" which would be near impossible to do, for it to be possible it would have to invade Iraq/Turkey which the international community would never support.   The U.S. knows that without its air support and ground spotters the Kurds are a very below average fighting force. A professional army like Turkey would easily be able to wound and reclaim lost territory gained by Kurdish independence.   So my belief is the U.S. simply promised that if the Kurds declare independence that they and the international community would halt aid to the Kurds. Turkey then has nothing to lose as they are confident enough to take on the Kurds."

Yeah but it's funny that everybody has been talking about a Kurdish state in Syria, except for Kurds. PYD has 1000 times confirmed to not want a state.   The U.S. knows that without its air support and ground spotters the Kurds are a very below average fighting force. A professional army like Turkey would easily be able to wound and reclaim lost territory gained by Kurdish independence.    Compared to who? The PYD militia is no real army, I agree. But YPG is one of the strongest militias in the Syrian Civil War. Yes, even without airstrikes. ISIS made gains in Kobani due to the fact that hey seized superior American weapons that the Iraqi Army left while fleeing. YPG has been crushing other rebel factions many times.     So my belief is the U.S. simply promised that if the Kurds declare independence that they and the international community would halt aid to the Kurds. Turkey then has nothing to lose as they are confident enough to take on the Kurds.

It doesn't matter if you have artillery if you don't know how to aim, it doesn't matter if you have tanks if you don't know how to use them effectively.

Even Abdullah Gül said so much recently.  However, the realignment of Turkish foreign policy from neo-Ottoman to realistic might not only bring back and deepen Turkey's role as a force for enlightenment and secularism in the region, it might also bring about a historic alignment of the Turkish Republic with Kurdish national interests and opinion.

No way ISIS rolls over here as they did in Tikrit and Rojava, and the overwhelming presence of Shia militias will force even more Sunnis into their ranks, if for no other reason than to defend their city from what they see as a sectarian operation (not liberation)."

I proved you wrong & said that actually, those who have surrendered to the SAA in Damascus were treated well & some even joined the SAA & NDF.

I dunno how much truth there is to it, but seems logical. Might such strategy be at play?"
syriancivilwar,3dbpy3,TheCapeman,3,Wed Jul 15 05:18:16 2015 UTC,"Hezbollah isn't fighting in Lebanon now.   A long-term strategy might be at play, but imo that's more on the regime's part in most cities where they have a realistic change of securing (towns not currently under barrel bombing), this may be why we haven't witnessed any 2012-tier massacres in towns captured by regime forces in a very long time, massacres now coming in the form of constant aerial bombardment on population centres in rebel-held areas rather than avoidable collective punishment.  Also Hezbollah themselves understand how many Syrians (who aren't actively Pro-Assad) consider them foreigners and view them with suspicion already, so I doubt there is even any real interaction between Hezb and locals, even less so surrendered rebels.  So as to how surrendered rebels are treated, I think that is something Hezb has no say in nor is particularly  interested in.  But for many reasons I believe that wherever the regime deploys itself with Hezb, they go into the battle confident in victory, and don't have to take to any desperate or retributive measures.   Plus Iranian advisers have most likely helped the regime realize the importance of hearts n minds, especially after the fall of Homs and Qusayr where Assad's chances of winning became less bleak, and building long-term relations with war-tired citizens who increasingly came to prefer stability from a strong state became a priority rather than a burden.  Edit: Changed some stuff."
syriancivilwar,3dbpy3,Samsund,2,Wed Jul 15 05:40:05 2015 UTC,"true. that's kind of what i meant. influencing the regime to understand the importance of reconciliation beyond military victory.

The modern democratic state model is not compatible with Islam as living under a non Islamic state by choice is blatantly haram correct? What I am trying to say is in Europe and the Americas we all have a similar government style and structure and it works around these regions as they all share quite a bit of culture and religion. The modern nation state is the refined result of the political culture the west has been building on for thousands of years. The Middle East has been dealing with governance for even longer, developing political traditions suited to the region. Iraqs government could be confused with a European country. That just doesn't make sense.  The Rojava system of government was influenced by the people and land it was created to rule over. Imagine what the Kurdish state would look like now if they had gone with the classic western government?  So back to Muslims. You know your religion, you know your region, you know your neighbors. You guys have to figure out how to blend your religion and democratic ideas.

People here are completely ignoring the history of these areas and especially the history after the Middle East was cut up into pieces by the allied forces.   For some reason people seem to ignore that the allies created these dictatorships a hundred years ago and instilled governments who were against the people so that those governments would have to rely on the allies to stay in power. Why did the allies instill Sunni leaders in majority Shia countries? Why did the allies place 3 separate cultures into a single country and expect everyone to get along? Nope, they never wanted peace. Iraq is a perfect example of a country that will ALWAYS be in conflict because when the lines were first drawn that's what it was drawn for.

syriancivilwar,3damyg,5_moon,25,Tue Jul 14 20:13:29 2015 UTC,I'm confused why they felt the need to do this.  People who don't believe a UN report because they think it's some imperialist plot won't be convinced by the FBI.

syriancivilwar,3damyg,indiffe,23,Tue Jul 14 21:20:21 2015 UTC,"It's like how further investigations were made on the Holocaust. It's important for those who deny these atrocities.

syriancivilwar,3damyg,TheCapeman,22,Tue Jul 14 21:50:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly it won't shut them up. They live in a fantasy world where the dictators they support don't commit the horrific attrocities other dictators have committed in similar situations. There's no reasoning with that kind of delusion. It's not about proof or reason, it's about making themselves feel justified even when reality contradicts their beliefs."

syriancivilwar,3damyg,Coaste12ama,2,Tue Jul 14 23:21:09 2015 UTC,"I have to say that it might. I tended to support Assad about a year into the war, with the main concern that if the FSA won quickly the zealots would come out. While I feel that concern was/is justified, Assad starting losing any half assed support from me pretty quick like. Between barrel bombs and gas, I can't support it."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,-Bingo-,-6,Wed Jul 15 04:09:10 2015 UTC,I am not denying them but if they are to be held responsible then so should EVERY single armed group in this conflict...they have all committed atrocities.
syriancivilwar,3damyg,MacLammond,8,Tue Jul 14 22:33:42 2015 UTC,"Alot of things should happen. But an actual internationally recognized gov't committing atrocities on this scale should be the priority, and not literal terrorists (JaN/ISIS) who have sought out to cause mayhem on those not belonging to their religious sect. The latter are hunted anyhow, and they and their actions wouldn't exist in a peacetime environment.   However Syria is a dictatorship against which the international community finally (lol) has proof of committing the horrors Syrians have been telling of for 4-40 years."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,TheCapeman,7,Wed Jul 15 00:56:48 2015 UTC,"Name one atrocity committed by the Southern Front of the FSA. Genuinely curious. If you can't, drop the narrative of ""everyone commits attrocities so stop bullying poor Bashar""."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,Luakey,8,Tue Jul 14 22:43:21 2015 UTC,"SF aside, I think the rebel groups that have committed the most atrocities by far are the ones in Aleppo who shell government held areas. Those rebels are sinking to the regime's level of knowingly shelling an area with inaccurate artillery that will inflict collateral damage.   But of course, that's really the only major atrocity that pops up in my head, besides the few incidents that /u/thecapeman mentions in his post. The thing that still shocks me the most to this day is how little the non-ISIS and JAN opposition have committed in terms of civilian massacres."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,el_beelo_reborn,6,Wed Jul 15 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"Yep. The rebels in Aleppo are on a whole other level. The savagery and brutality of that city must have gotten to them. Finding yourself in near siege and surrounded by enemies 24/7, desperation gets a hold of you quick.  But also there have been criminal elements within the Aleppo FSA since day 1 (or the months following day 1). Just corrupt leaders and bad apples all around, together with some good men who wish for their group to return to it's former glory-days, where protecting the innocents was a priority."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,TheCapeman,5,Wed Jul 15 02:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, Aleppo was a shit show since day 1, that is a dark side of the Revolution that I will never deny."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,el_beelo_reborn,2,Wed Jul 15 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"Much of it stems from the resentment between the different neighborhoods. Historical disparities in income/social status between rebel and regime neighborhoods combined with years of barrel bombing makes lashing out at any target seem like a reasonable choice. Barbarization of warfare.    Have you read Marching into Darkness? It's a book about how ordinary German soldiers in Russia over the first 6 months of their campaign there became increasing desensitized to atrocities and thus more complicit in them. They went from ""merely"" guarding Jews on their way to the execution puts to participating in the executions to actively hunting down Jews to torture and murder. It's very easy for people to become animals given the right circumstances."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,Luakey,4,Wed Jul 15 03:02:41 2015 UTC,"There was an FSA-affiliated group which was involved in the gruesome killings in and around Latakia in 2013.  Also a massacre in Hama in 2012 where the Alewite families were besieged in a building (their own home I think), and the rebel units were harassing them with rocket shells and gunfire until a few shells collapsed the roof on top of those inside (whether the FSA or the gov't had did it is debatable).  I remember hearing some say that the gov't began shelling the town the moment they withdrew, and hit the building were the Alewites had barricaded themselves, together with many other buildings.  EDIT: Nvm, none of the above are by the Southern Front.  But then again, in every State TV interview with survivors of massacres committed by both rebels and gov't (in which either rebels are blamed or civilians are made into combatants), those interviewed will say ""the killers said they were from FSA"". This constantly repeated response is another embarrassing fuck-up on the part of regime TV, along with employing the same actors in interviews and reports."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,TheCapeman,6,Wed Jul 15 00:51:24 2015 UTC,"I was asking about the Southern Front, not the FSA in general. Still, I agree, most ""atrocities"" by FSA groups in the North were blatant government fabrications."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,Luakey,3,Wed Jul 15 00:56:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought you said Southern Front or the FSA. Then no, other than some inevitable field executions and beating up prisoners (which happen on every side), no massacres or industrial-scale killings so far."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,TheCapeman,5,Wed Jul 15 01:03:09 2015 UTC,I actually can't remember any videos of Southern Front executions popping up. The closest geographically is a video from Damascus by another (Pro-regime people claim) FSA-linked group.
syriancivilwar,3damyg,Luakey,5,Wed Jul 15 01:04:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just said that to give anti-SF people some sympathy points haha.  That may sound arrogant and stupid, but given that any inevitable roughing-up of POWs aren't even close to the doings of the regime, the closest thing gov't-supporters have to making an argument that the FSA are war criminals, is through their far-fetched and desperate comments to videos where SF are showing dead/captured SAA:  ""DAE suspicious bullet hole pattern?? Moderates???"", ""The soldiers have obvious black-eyes who's' the war criminal now???"""

syriancivilwar,3damyg,degestani,2,Tue Jul 14 23:11:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, I saw that. But frankly it doesn't matter, because had the images been fake, wouldn't the FBI just lie about it seeing as this whole Qatar-sponsored Caesar report is a plot to ramp up criticism towards Assad?   And seeing as this is their only comment on it, I think we would have heard from the FBI if any of the other ifs and why's had turned up to be the result of fabrication of either the circumstances in which these photos were taken, or the authenticity of them.  The FBI ought to investigate the inconsistencies in the pro-gov't arguments as to why these images are not genuine. One minute it's staged, the next it's rebels (I mean look at their beards /s).    Truth is, even if the FBI,CIA,NATO and KGB come to the conclusion that every original claim about these photos in the report are true, the pro-Assad crowd would still find something to nag about.   So it's all pointless really. If you don't want to believe it, you won't."

syriancivilwar,3damyg,el_beelo_reborn,13,Tue Jul 14 23:32:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was a bit dubious myself at first. Not dubious that they were inhumanly torturing prisoners (I've had family in prison before the war) but that they actually got out with legitimate proof. It's incredible. No one in their right mind can deny a UN report and FBI validation. Emphasis on the 'right mind'.  I wonder, with undeniable proof such as this, how the world will look back on Syria in 20 years..."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,thesyrianrose,14,Wed Jul 15 04:57:42 2015 UTC,"It does not take 20 years to see what is right in front of us.  The sad thing to me is how people never learn. I remember many in pro-regime circles, and a lot of Arabs in general criticizing the US invasion of Iraq, and the whole war on terror, as being nothing but a political gambit for the US to enact its policies unhindered, and with the support of the Western world.  Pro-regime apologists are ironically using the exact same excuse to destroy Syria in order to salvage Assad and Iran's interests in the country. It is just so sad that in the face of facts that directly implicate Assad in the manipulation of terrorists for the achievement of policy goals, pro-regime apologists still insist that Assad is the one who is serious about fighting terrorism. Things like sending AQ to Iraq to battle US troops and piss off Maliki between 2003 and 2008 is ignored by pro-regime apologists; things like the well documented amnesty that Assad issued in the early days of the uprising in 2011, which literally led to the release of known and convicted terrorists (the same terrorists he used to send to Iraq and then subsequently locked up in Sednaya), are ignored.   For me, what is saddest is the lack of humanity and compassion that pro-regime supporters show for Syrian civilians murdered in this conflict. Passing references to the dead as ""collateral damage"" or ""terrorist sympathizers"" drives me absolutely insane; you are for the persistence of a strong National government in Syria that protects Syrians, yet here you are, cheering on a government that is doing the exact opposite.  Fucking disgusting."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,el_beelo_reborn,0,Wed Jul 15 05:06:52 2015 UTC,"Luakey: Regime supporters really are shameless. They don't give a damn about Syria or the Syrian people.

No, we have never claimed that. I cannot speak for all of us, but I know an overwhelming majority of us support Damascus largely because who the alternative is.  Post war, I wish for Assad & senior officials be granted immunity to convince him to step down.  I wish for a complete overhaul of the system & a new one begins from scratch free of all foreign influence. I believe that the Islamist rebels should have absolutely no role in reforming the constitution-- not that they would anyway considering democracy is an enemy of Sharia.  But we are a long way until then.  For as long as the alternative to Assad is the opposition we have today, denouncing democracy, seeking Sharia Law in a plural society, threatening the sovereignty of neighboring Iraq & Lebanon, & especially the threat they pose to minorities & Shia, I will support any who stands in the face of this dishonorable fate.  To say the tens of thousands of men that have fought & died have done so to preserve the throne of one man is an insult & a dishonor to the memories & the very names of those men."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,Souriii,-3,Wed Jul 15 01:34:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm walking into the lion's den by replying to this, but here it goes:  No sane person, pro-government or pro-rebel can deny that torture took place in Syria (and still does to this day). I was initially hesitant to believe Caesar's story for a number of reasons, namely because of who funded and aided him in releasing the story. As more and more evidence surfaced, it became increasingly clear that there is definitely truth to the report. Will this make me change my stance on who I support? Definitely not, even though I've had family members who were imprisoned in Syria and were definitely tortured (but thankfully made it out alive)   The reason I support the government is not because Assad is some shining beacon of love and peace. Its not because I adhere to the Baath ideology, and its definitely not because the government is perfect or even desirable (under better circumstances).  The reason I support the government is that the vast majority of the moderate rebels will treat me as a second class citizen. Its not hard to see that the motivating factor for majority of the rebel groups is religion, and its not unreasonable to assume that religion would be a motivating factor in the government (and by extension everyday life) if the rebels topple the Assad. Even the beloved southern front consists of groups such as the Muhajerin and Ansar Brigade, Dawn of Islam Division, Youth of Sunnah, Ghouta Mujahedin Brigade, Martyrs of Islam Brigade, Freedom Martyrs Brigade, Usoud al-Islam Battalion..etc Sure compared to Ahrar alsham and JN they are saints, but lets not kid ourselves and think that minorities would be happy living under the rule of such groups.   I won't even get into the slight inconvenience which is that many rebel fighters would happily kill me because I'm an atheist.   Someone once asked me what it would take for me to stop supporting Assad and my answer remains the same: He would have to be more of a threat to my friends and family in Syria than the rebels are.  TLDR: Assad bad guy, still more desirable to minorities than rebel groups."

I would like to interject, however; in my opinion, the unfortunate circumstances that minorities in Syria face today are a result of early decisions made by many minorities in Syria.  The current stance in Syria and Islamification of the Revolution is predominately a result of the lack of support the Revolution received from the World community, and also partially minorities within Syria.   Assad was facing a peaceful, secular revolt from the majority demographic in Syria, and instead of political maneuvering and dialogue, he immediately resorted to brutality. Christians, Druze, Ismaelis, and Alawites all had the chance to side with justice and the Revolution, but instead most of them clung onto the Regime's legs.   They chose to side with Assad's strategy of protecting them through the bright idea of slaughtering and massacring the majority demographic in the country and releasing convicted terrorists and criminals into the population. The Sunnis, who have faced barrel bombs, starvation, chemical weapons, relentless shelling, torture, and genocide have suffered the most by leaps and bounds for the past 4 years and will certainly have enmity towards everyone in the country who abandoned their just cause in the face of unfounded fear. This stance is human nature, and it would have happened in any country, especially with the unique circumstances that we see today in Syria.  At the end of the day though, I truly doubt either side is going to win this war. Pragmatism and deal making will prevail in the end and that will lead to the creation of a transitional government consisting of opposition and regime elements; essentially, an outcome that would ensure the protection of minorities and power sharing."

I would like to interject, however; in my opinion, the unfortunate circumstances that minorities in Syria face today are a result of early decisions made by many minorities in Syria.   And that is where we disagree..   The current stance in Syria and Islamification of the Revolution is predominately a result of the lack of support the Revolution received from the World community, and also partially minorities within Syria.    There was a time when the US was literally begging for a group to support in Syria but they could not find a sizeable moderate group. Do you remember when the FSA simply handed over several weapon/ammo depots (supplied by the states) to the IF without a fight? I could go into a lot more depth as to why the international community withheld support from the Syrian rebels if you'd like.   Assad was facing a peaceful, secular revolt from the majority demographic in Syria, and instead of political maneuvering and dialogue, he immediately resorted to brutality. Christians, Druze, Ismaelis, and Alawites all had the chance to side with justice and the Revolution, but instead most of them clung onto the Regime's legs.    Again, we disagree. I've been following the protests from the beginning. I've seen ""peaceful"" protestors storming government buildings and killing innocent government workers. I've seen protestors riot in the streets, flipping cars and starting fires, all while chanting peaceful (سلمية)  As for the protests being secular, why then did most of the initial protests occur after Friday prayers from Sunni mosques exclusively? Why did the armed rebels comprise almost exclusively of Sunnis, and take up Sunni/Muslim brigade names. The rebels that kicked out my aunt from homs in 2012 were far from secular..   They chose to side with Assad's strategy of protecting them through the bright idea of slaughtering and massacring the majority demographic in the country and releasing convicted terrorists and criminals into the population. The Sunnis, who have faced barrel bombs, starvation, chemical weapons, relentless shelling, torture, and genocide have suffered the most by leaps and bounds for the past 4 years and will certainly have enmity towards everyone in the country who abandoned their just cause in the face of unfounded fear. This stance is human nature, and it would have happened in any country, especially with the unique circumstances that we see today in Syria.   Oh please.. Sunnis comprise the majority of the population and it follows that majority of the deaths will be from Sunnis. Also, Sunnis comprise the vast majority of the armed opposition so it follows that Sunni neighbourhoods/towns would be most involved in the fighting.  If what you are claiming is true then there wouldn't be any Sunnis living in government held areas. The fact that there are still Sunnis that even support the government is enough proof that your cries of genocide have no basis in reality.   At the end of the day though, I truly doubt either side is going to win this war. Pragmatism and deal making will prevail in the end and that will lead to the creation of a transitional government consisting of opposition and regime elements; essentially, an outcome that would ensure the protection of minorities and power sharing.   One can only hope.."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,Luakey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:28:48 2015 UTC,"That seems like an illogical way of thinking about things. It's acceptable that a dictator murder tens of thousands of people, drive the country into corruption and economic decline, repress Kurds, allow certain Alawites to dominate the military and security services, and support Al-Qaeda in neighboring countries as long as some minorities are treated nicely?   At least the Southern Front doesn't go around murdering people, and has disavowed sectarianism. They even try to pursue friendly relations with the Druze and limit encroachments into Suwaida. That seems to make them much more worthy of support than Assad after the horrible things he has and will do. I just can't see the logic of favoring ""might be"" and ""could be"" over the facts."
syriancivilwar,3damyg,Souriii,0,Wed Jul 15 05:12:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's very realistic and logical, its just that we as people are selfish. We care about ourselves and about the people closest to us and disregard people unrelated to us.  Most people would not support a safer/better environment for strangers at the expense of their own friends and family. That is why we have people starving in Africa whereas people suffer from obesity in the states. That is why every country has a homeless population, while many people own multiple properties. That is why people have no problem buying electronics/clothes that other people slaved away to make.  It's not a pretty reality, but its the truth. If I had a choice between thousands of people I don't know dying and 10close friends/family members dying then I know what I would choose. Does that make me a bad person or just an honest one?  Edit: regarding the southern front, they can claim whatever they'd like regarding their ideology. Once they start actually fighting the extremists then I'll consider them a viable alternative. They still fight alongside JN and other extremists, even if they announced that they will not coordinate with them."

Though, I was not aware of the extent of torture used in the Phoenix program until today thanks to /u/WestenM, which I will now have to look into.  I would argue atrocities ultimately traced back to us that occurred throughout the Cold War were more results of bad strategy and wanton decision making.

syriancivilwar,3dboq0,redrojava,-2,Wed Jul 15 05:30:11 2015 UTC,"Well, coz now Iran will be extra cautious in not publicly being caught providing military and logistic support to Assad. If they do it too publicly there are enough guys now jumping to say ""Iran can't be trusted"". Which reinforces the right wing and Israel lobby in Washington and the deal doesn't get ratified. On the other hand if the deal fell through Iran would be like ""f*** that, the west is not gonna remove sanctions anyway, we might as well go the best we can to preserve out allies"". So both Houthi's and Assad is worse off with the deal. Hezbollah is okay, their relation with Iran goes much deeper."
syriancivilwar,3dboq0,GreyWolf89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:05:25 2015 UTC,"Thats not how the deal works, why would they give a shit what Israel or a US republican says? They can not shutup and they will bad mouth Iran no matter how much assistance they provide.  This deal is in regards to their nuclear energy. To think they will shift away from allies to make Israel less angry is very naive."
syriancivilwar,3dboq0,redrojava,0,Wed Jul 15 06:13:04 2015 UTC,"The deal is not there yet. There is a 90 day period where their action will be monitored by parties trying to find an excuse to not ratify the deal. And Obama/Kerry would rather have the deal fail due to some action of Iran than due to political pressure of Republican-AIPAC. That's how politics in Washington works. The primary opposition of the Republican-AIPAC is not about what is in the deal but about what is not in the deal. Like the allegation of Iran propping up proxies and funding militias undermining sovereign states. The argument is with lifting of sanctions, the support of Hezbollah, shia militias of iraq, houthis and perhaps islamic jihad/hamas would go up. If signs of these become apparent in the coming days then there will be a large chorus to not ratify the deal and some democrats would join it. And Saudi's, GCC states and Israel would badly want such a chorus and would thus increase their support and co-operation to the opposition in Syria to provoke some similar response from Iran. Look what happened in Aden, Yemen yesterday. Iran needs the deal otherwise they wont have gone to such length to take such pains and agree to such an invasive deal. They need the deal to get ratified and at least have their frozen assets back. so they would be extra cautious in supporting their allies, especially Assad. Soon we shall see a lot more firepower on the rebel's side and false flag chemical weapons attack, perhaps invoking occasional airstrike against Assad positions. Now if an Iranian adviser/general/troop is caught or killed in the middle of this, it would be a major roadblock, which Iran would want to avoid. Without the deal Iran would not have to be cautious."

When in a firing position, or in storage/non use, camouflage prevents detection on a small to large scale, depending on the degree of camoflague. I would imagine this to be especially true due to the lack of IR/NV capabilities that many groups suffer. I am curious what the rationale is behind the LAKY's comment"

Painting them all black would probably help with identification purposes, especially from the air.  If the US will be giving them air support, it makes sense that we'd want them to be conspicuous.  1, so we don't bomb them and 2, if those vehicles do get captured, we can more easily identify and bomb them."

Does not strike me as a wise use of money at all. And if this professor is right about why we can't find suitable candidates then don't expect a sudden influx of new recruits:   “It’s not that the requirements are high,” said Max Abrahms, assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University in Boston. “I don’t think we’ve been unable to find them due to a lack of looking. I think simply that the supply of moderate rebels is small.”  The situation is little different in Iraq, said Abrahms, where only 1,300 Sunnis have signed up for training by U.S. forces.  “The reality is that in both Iraq and in Syria, the Sunni population has not turned against the Islamic State,” he said.   I find it hard to believe a majority of the Sunnis aren't against ISIS.  http://www.voanews.com/content/pentagon-faces-heat-over-syria-rebel-training-program/2857550.html"

How many do you think we will end up training with the remaining $250,000,000? How many do we need to justify the $500,000,000 of US taxpayer that will have been spent. 5,000? 10,000? You really think we're gonna go from 60 to 5,000?"
syriancivilwar,3db4mm,DineLointHarpie,3,Wed Jul 15 03:18:54 2015 UTC,"There are several factors to consider. One: the reason the turnout was so low was not due to a lack of moderates, but rather the fact that even the slightest display of intent to fight Assad in addition to IS meant termination from the program. Two: the boost in recruiting may be possible if the first batch is equipped suffiently, had enough training, and provided the level of US support needed for success. Several rounds of success and a guarantee of the program not ever cooperating eith Assad may significantly boost the number of potential recruits. We must also consider what may happen if these guys come in contact with Assadi fighters. However that ends up may also set a precedent and impact the dynamics of this fighting force."
syriancivilwar,3db4mm,navidfa,-2,Wed Jul 15 05:41:53 2015 UTC,"$250,000,000 spent so far and only 60 soldiers to show for it- it's not like we have thousands more acceptable recruits lined up after them. I think most Americans would say it has been a colossal waste of money up until this point. There is no way someone can describe the program as a success. I hope with the remaining $250,000,000 they're able to get thousands of ""moderate"" recruits. But given the pathetic numbers so far I'm doubtful. I suspect they will weaken the requirements to show ""success"" and we end up taking in a lot of people who will end up joining one of the extremist Islamist factions whose interests are at odds with ours."

Let's start off with better military strategists and planners as well as a better structured military    Iranian t-72's are superior to Syrian t-72's as they have gone through numerous modernization upgrades and at this point are more potent than stock Iraqi M1A1's  Iranian F-4's, SU-24's, SU-25's and F-5's are all technologically superior to Syria's existing arsenal (I think it shoudk also said that they are better stocked and maintained) Iran's f-14's would wipe the floor with whatever soviet era standard block 1 junk Syria has.  guided air to ground missiles    Zoobin   Sattar 3-4  smart bomb: gassed 3  (Really you can search this up on your own, I don't know why you think we lack these munitions. the reason Iran isn't giving Syria this is because it would require a complete overhaul of Syria's obsolete air-force to make sure it's guided missiles are going to good use, an overhaul and restructuring program that would take years (not to mention modernizing the command structure of the Syrian airforce/intelligence service and training its pilots). A cost Iran is not willing to take on.   Iran can provide anything and everything Syria needs, but at what cost? What's the use of giving then weapons they can't even use? I think you have observed how much of a hands off approach to the Syrian army's function Iran is, if it were up to us how to run the Syrian army things would be moving along much differently.

That and Iranian made copies of the AH-1 Cobra gunship haven't turned up either despite being available for production and purchase (I don't know how widespread the availability of MANPADS is among resistance forces).

syriancivilwar,3daigw,TweetPoster,-3,Tue Jul 14 19:42:57 2015 UTC,Why are they even advancing in that region? There's nothing for them there. Literally nothing. Just seems like a massive waste of reinforcements that could be going towards Aleppo or Tadmur.
syriancivilwar,3daigw,Balak_Jewboma,7,Tue Jul 14 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"They probably try to hold a buffer zone, so that the rebels are not able to threaten Latakkia. They are only a 30 minutes drive from Latakkia away."
syriancivilwar,3daigw,Boerek1,-3,Wed Jul 15 00:04:26 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, that's exactly the thing. They aren't really gaining anything significant or strategic, and al-Ghab can't be the launching point for any sort of offensive towards a significant or strategic place. They're just trying to defend an area. Given how little of the country the regime holds, they need to score decisive victories to have any chance at winning, not merely holding out."
syriancivilwar,3daigw,Balak_Jewboma,6,Wed Jul 15 00:16:40 2015 UTC,"Given how little of the country the regime holds   Well they hold all important cities. And they bombing the shit out of the parts of the country which isnt under there control. Furthermore this land there is crucial for them since it is Alawite heartland, under no circumsdances they can allow to loose ground there for a potentially unsuccesful offensive."
syriancivilwar,3daigw,Boerek1,-4,Wed Jul 15 00:25:49 2015 UTC,"They hold all cities important for their immediate survival, yes. But simply holding those cities won't win them the war. Holding a select few cities will just mean you'll be forced to bleed out troops defending your rump state, which is never ever a sustainable position whether you'll be killed by the rebels or by your generals in 10 years."
syriancivilwar,3daigw,Balak_Jewboma,2,Wed Jul 15 00:43:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think they can score decisive victories atm, and this advance is in anticipation of a renewed JaF offensive. I'm speculating, but the regime may fear what could happen around al Ghab much more than Aleppo or Deraa. The fights for those cities will be protracted and costly. A rebel offensive in rural areas may have more value as it could forces the loyalists to reposition troops and diminish their attempts to secure eastern Homs, Damascus, etc."

syriancivilwar,3dan96,Warya,3,Tue Jul 14 20:15:21 2015 UTC,I'm guessing in this context an airstrike is counted as a strike sortie that was flown? The terminology is confusing sometimes.
syriancivilwar,3dan96,sunbolts,4,Tue Jul 14 20:50:06 2015 UTC,Doesn't necessarily have to be a complete sortie but just bombs dropped at once. We see tons of videos released by CENTCOM of multiple bombs dropped at once
syriancivilwar,3dan96,IgorForHire,3,Tue Jul 14 21:23:13 2015 UTC,"FYI you can find pretty much all the stuff Brett McGurk mentions at this facebook page  July 14, 2015  Release # 20150714  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Military Airstrikes Continue Against ISIL Terrorists in Syria and Iraq  SOUTHWEST ASIA – On July 13, Coalition military forces continued to attack ISIL terrorists in Syria and Iraq. In Syria, coalition military forces conducted seven airstrikes using bomber, fighter and remotely piloted aircraft. Separately in Iraq, coalition military forces conducted 20 airstrikes approved by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense using bomber, attack, and fighter-attack aircraft against ISIL targets.  “We are supporting ISF operations in Ramadi with precision airstrikes on Daesh targets,” said Brig. Gen. Kevin Killea, CJTF-OIR chief of staff. “Coalition efforts to date in Ramadi have been a great enabler for the advancement of Iraqi ground forces. It should be understood that the coalition only supports those security forces, tribal resistance fighters and Iraqi Army units that are under the control of the government of Iraq and report directly to the Ministry of Defense for operations”  The following is a summary of the strikes conducted against ISIL since the last press release:  Syria  • Near Al Hasakah, two airstrikes struck two ISIL tactical units and destroyed two ISIL fighting positions.  • Near Aleppo, three airstrikes struck three ISIL tactical units and destroyed an ISIL towed artillery piece.  • Near Dayr Az Zawr, two airstrikes struck nine ISIL staging areas.  Iraq  • Near Fallujah, six airstrikes struck five ISIL tactical units destroying two ISIL excavators, an ISIL vehicle, an ISIL  heavy machine gun position, an ISIL mortar system and an ISIL fighting position.  • Near Habbaniyah, one airstrike destroyed two ISIL VBIEDs, an ISIL armored personnel carrier and an ISIL excavator.  • Near Haditha, two airstrikes struck two ISIL tactical units destroying an ISIL mortar system, an ISIL fighting position and an ISIL structure.  • Near Makhmur, one airstrike struck an ISIL rocket position.  • Near Mosul, two airstrikes struck an ISIL tactical unit and an ISIL mortar position and destroyed an ISIL vehicle.  • Near Ramadi, five airstrikes destroyed an ISIL excavator, an ISIL VBIED factory, an ISIL armored vehicle, an ISIL structure and four ISIL VBIEDs.  • Near Sinjar, two airstrikes struck two ISIL tactical units destroying five ISIL buildings, two ISIL light machine guns, and an ISIL heavy machine gun.  • Near Tal Afar, one airstrike had inconclusive results.  Airstrike assessments are based on initial reports. All aircraft returned to base safely.  The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation to eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, Syria and the wider international community. The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq further limits the group's ability to project terror and conduct operations. Coalition nations which have conducted airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States. Coalition nations which have conducted airstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Canada, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the U.S."

It was more the ""lets do a probing attack on a demoralised army and see what happens"" that Da3sh do so well.  Compare it to, I dunno, Hasakah or DEZ - both of which are on the list at the top of this page - or some other engagement where the USAF gets more than 48 hours to get its act together.

If they lose Fallujah and the rest of Anbar, they're through."

You know, I'd love to support the rebels if their mentality was all like YPG and their ideology as well. Reality seen, it isn't. There is no good alternative.    personal wealth and power   How does that even matter? Most Alawites are piss poor, and fight because they know what will happen if they loose. Maybe for the upper echelon living in Damascus, but not for those living at the coast."

Assad made a violent response the only option left to people, and the most violent individuals are also going to be the most radical. Hell, just stepping down and letting his more moderate VP take over would have helped. Instead, he marginalized said VP in the Ba'ath Party. It's really not that complex.   Alawites have plenty to lose. They get favor in hiring for public sector jobs and dominate the military/security services."

And please, SNC are traitors, I don't pity them a second. They sell out to anyone, they are the Political MEK of Syria.   And you bite too much in the ""marginalized sunni"" story. Sunnis are still the richest in Syria, and have generally more money than Alawites. Alawites were surpressed so badly for hundreds of years, forced in the mountains by the Sunnis of the coast. Hafez changed all of that but went too far. But does that make them deserve a terrible fate?"

If he did cause as much trouble as has been claimed, maybe this is why he wasn't asked t leave. Maybe they thought, as an actor he will do well in front of the camera. Compare that to Matsons recent interview in Sweden which showed a nuanced understanding of the situation around the groups of people who will need to co-exist in the area.

YPG knows that SAA isn't holding out much longer so decides to counterattack ISIS, thus diverting ISIS attacks on Hasakah city.

syriancivilwar,3d9k2a,Bacojyam,3,Tue Jul 14 16:50:54 2015 UTC,well it is possible they could be supplied from the air and just try to hold out until they are relived.
syriancivilwar,3d9k2a,carlislecommunist,5,Tue Jul 14 17:13:42 2015 UTC,How fortified would that substation be though? If Daesh was able to take a fortified prison less then 1000m away then can these guys really hold out? I think a night time attempt to break the lines would be the best way to go and than high tail it back to friendly territory with some air support maybe.
syriancivilwar,3d9k2a,MacLammond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:51 2015 UTC,Couldn't be too fortified. Not like Kweires AFB or Aleppo Central Prison at least. Hasakah is just some backwater front for the SAA which only holds propaganda value. Chances are that it'd fall shortly unless the main SAA contingent in Hasakah relieves it.
syriancivilwar,3d9k2a,Balak_Jewboma,3,Tue Jul 14 23:28:40 2015 UTC,"You can't accurately airdrop supplies to a position that's 300m x 200m. It worked at Aleppo Central Prison because they had several kilometres of buffer zone to work with. We saw at Jisr National Hospital, a position larger than this one, that the rebels captured the majority of drops aimed at the hospital. There's no hope of aerial resupply for these guys."

syriancivilwar,3d9k2a,paulellertsen,7,Tue Jul 14 16:21:38 2015 UTC,thats roughly 2 miles from SAA territory.  you cant run that and expect to make it.  There better be a big counter attack sooner or they are in trouble.  Not sure what they have for air support.  Havent seen any footage of artillery support from Kwakab artillery base.  They are well within range.  Constant artillery support could help prevent an infantry attack by Daesh
syriancivilwar,3d9k2a,walkerbulldog1,2,Tue Jul 14 16:55:02 2015 UTC,The SAA has not had a stellar record this year relieving sieges. The SAA forces capable of attacking anything are occupied elsewhere. I'd say any kind of relief is unlikely.

They doubtless have vehicles, snipers, and patrols in between the substation and the SAA, particularly because they JUST had an offensive that put a ton of troops right there. and don't forget the fortified prison RIGHT THERE that they just took.

syriancivilwar,3dd9fo,Guck_Mal,2,Wed Jul 15 10:52:11 2015 UTC,Technically they could try black bucking (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Black_Buck) it Baltic->North Atlantic->Straights of Gibraltar->Med with a Tu-160 or deploy their carrier offshore.. but that's just upping the stakes in a region where they don't have 'escalation dominance'.  In short they'd give the U.S/Turkey/Israel/Jordan every excuse to do bombing of their own on the Syrian Govt itself & they can do far more of it.

They would be forced to use its bombers which are falling out of the sky because the increase in flights and poor maintenance. 6 Russian aircraft have crashed in the last two months Imagine how many would crash when they started running a intense Bombing campaign. Also how would they get there? Turkey would just shoot them down if they targeted the wrong rebels. They wouldn't fly over Iraq because coalition has the air superiority and same with eastern Syria where they could run into Gulf F-15/16s

He forgets to mention there are a number of Sunni groups fighting against IS, and that IS is doing a remarkably shitty job as the protector of Sunnis - at the end of the day, the combination of US airpower, Shi`a militia, Kurdish militia and the Iraqi Army can indeed retake areas from IS, but they do it with a fuckton of property damage and many refugees.

Likewise, ""already-disaffected Sunnis "" means those Sunni who are refusing to fight against IS.  Yes, Iran is indeed arming and funding anti-IS militias in Iraq, which are not under state control. Fortunately, arming and funding anti-IS militias in Iraq is a game anyone can play, but Im not seeing any Turkish, Jordanian or Saudi armed-and-funded anti-IS groups in Iraq at all.  If you can name me any such group, then I'd be happy to hear about it.  Until then, ""ISIS presents itself as the sole protector of Sunni populations in Iraq and Syria,"" is true - they present that - but the only people ISIS can actually protect Sunni populations against is the violence of ISIS itself.  Admittedly, al-Baghdadi's gang of thieves, rapists and murderers do present a pretty good argument for keeping your mouth shut and keeping your head down so they will declare someone else a spy, an apostate, a smoker, a defector and so on, but as far as protecting anyone against Iranian funded militia, American bombs or any other danger in the region, they are worse than useless."

It doesn't look like the front lines have really changed and its been a while since any gains were reported. On the other hand, the rebels probably have limited supplies so if they're using artillery, its probably because they think they can make gains.  Any thoughts?"

Always make the boogeyman seem a lot bigger than he actually is. It's classic scaremongering propaganda.

That said, Iran is also willing to let Islamic State fester in areas it deems strategically unimportant, because Islamic State is actually much more of a threat to the Persian Gulf states and Jordan than it is to Iran. These states are far less adept at countering Islamic State domestically: whereas Islamic State has attacked Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and threatened Jordan, there hasn't been a single incident in Iran. It helps that a vast number of Islamic State fighters are from these states and have an abundance of support among local populations.  The Sunni Arab fiefdoms are playing with fire, knowing not that Islamic State is as much a manifestation of their own oppression and corruption as it is a dangerous death cult. Islamic State can attract former Saddam supporters because at least he stood for something (however convoluted it was), and resisted foreign interference. But since his demise, the Sunni Arab layman is left with what? Corrupt Saudi princes who frolick in multibillion dollar mansions and yachts in Europe? A Jordanian King who can barely speak Arabic and spent his youth in the West?  Islamic State is a reflection of Sunni Arab civil society today. Let them reap what they have sowed."

syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,HamidAlizadeh88,41,Tue Jul 14 09:58:44 2015 UTC,"The short answer is that the current ""victories"" of the government are too minor to really conclued something.  The rebel offensives in Aleppo and Daraa are still open ended. I mean it was clear that Aleppo wont fall in a matter of months all I can say is that the rebels at least made some gains. Time will tell if the government managed to completley hold the offensive there and eventually manages to capture ground from the rebels. From the government perspective I am actually more optimistic for the Daraa battlefield than for Aleppo.    Palmyra it seems to be advancing quickly   Here you are falling for the narrative that pro-government sides are always celebrating every conquered rock as if a new Waterloo had occured to the rebels or ISIS.   Hasakah it seems to be advancing slowly   Last time I checked they lost ground. THe YPG was the one advancing.  Edit: The overall outcome is very hard to predict, because this whole war is not just about holding ground, but it is also a war of attrition. It can very well happen that at one point one side will just start to collapse like we saw it in other wars of attrition (the most striking example probably WWI)."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Boerek1,23,Tue Jul 14 10:51:20 2015 UTC,"Here you are falling for the narrative that pro-government sides are always celebrating every conquered rock as if a new Waterloo had occured to the rebels or ISIS.   You nailed it with this. One of the worst things about this subreddit is that it is possible to form a very misguided impression (like the person who posted this thread) based on dubious sources, that in turn get massively upvoted by a pro-regime cabal. With several of these threads constantly at the top of the page everyday, it is easy to see why someone who hasn't been paying attention to the conflict from the start can fall for this. If you actually look at the sources hyping these latest Assad regime ""advances"", it is either Al Masdar News (basically a pro-regime blog), Electronic Resistance (a Hezbollah fan site), Al Manar News (literally the news wing of Hezbollah and a specially designated terrorist entity in many countries) or any number of pro-regime Twitter accounts.  In reality, Zabadani really just exposed how weak the regime is and the failing level of commitment to the conflict on the part of Hezbollah, as they are focussing on a relatively insignificant area while more vital ones continue to be pressured, while in Palmyra they have yet to make any significant progress what-so-ever, and still seem unlikely to do so."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,badly_xeroxed,7,Tue Jul 14 11:25:22 2015 UTC,Well that is why I asked the question. So why do you say that Zabadani has exposed the weakness of the regime?
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,dragon_nipples,12,Tue Jul 14 11:29:51 2015 UTC,Because its a side show that doesn't mean anything really. The operation has taken months of SAA and hezbollah climbing mountains while they lost an entire province.
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,walkerbulldog1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:03:07 2015 UTC,doesnt mean anything?  The regime is finally feeling pressure and decided to clear out a rebel stronghold close by to the capital and also a possible supply route to the capital if it were to get cut off from the north.  This is something the regime should have done a while ago.  They are teetering right now and it can go either way.
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,KevinMango,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:08:44 2015 UTC,"The rebels in Qalamoon haven't been a threat to Damascus in years, and although I guess you could call Zabadani a rebel stronghold, the opposition wasn't in any shape to use it as a base to launch attacks towards Damascus.  I've heard that its importance is that rebels could harass supplies moving from Damascus towards Hezbollah-dominated parts of Lebanon from that location, but that's like an ancillary benefit for Hezbollah, since they're not suffering a supply shortage, and it doesn't do much at all for the regime because those areas are still going to need troops deployed there to pacify them, just like Qalamoon."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Michelundelang,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:21:49 2015 UTC,But isnt that how mountain warfare and an attack on a fortified town look like?
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,badly_xeroxed,6,Tue Jul 14 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"Because Aleppo, Daraa and Idlib are all in trouble right now and the regime are launching an offensive on an easy target in an isolated and non strategic area in order to score a much needed propaganda victory (much like their recent efforts in Qalamoun that no one was buying, Qalamoun being an unsecurable barren wilderness right next to Lebanon), with Hezbollah clearly unwilling to move far away from the border with Lebanon any longer. Meanwhile they are taking a beating even trying to take Zabadani."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,gwely,2,Tue Jul 14 12:31:38 2015 UTC,I agree with you but isn't there a dam near Zabadani the SAA are working toward to protect the water supply to Damascus? Or was it power supply?
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Sierrahun,2,Tue Jul 14 14:10:12 2015 UTC,Meanwhile they are taking a beating even trying to take Zabadani. What is the source for the vast losses or vast wastes?
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,walkerbulldog1,2,Tue Jul 14 13:12:03 2015 UTC,Idlib is not is trouble it is lost. Daraa has been in trouble for a long time.  Aleppo is a virtual stalemate.  Clearing out the rebel pockets close to the capital should have been done a long time ago.   The regime is starting to have a sense of urgency that they seem not to have had in the past
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,badly_xeroxed,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:11:25 2015 UTC,"What do you mean when you say they are taking a beating in Zabadani? I agree about being pressured from many sides. I would also agree that Zabadani could be a morale booster (and that is no small thing in war were morale is the most important factor). But the way I see it, it would still be an important step in preparation for bigger offensives. Also I would not exactly say that it is an insignificant place given its proximity to supply lines, Damascus and the Lebanese border. If the regime & co. want to make any inroads into other areas they would have to clear out their own backyard and free the necessary forces. Anything else would be childish. In that sense I think Zabadani is quite important as a step towards consolidating the west to free up forces for whatever they want to do with the rest of the country.   In general it seems to me that after 2012-13 the opposition gains generally stagnated after the character of the movement became more Islamist thus pushing people behind Assad. Not that I think many Syrians are very fond of him, but seeing the alternative I think many people don't hesitate to pick a side. Of course this doesn't mean that the military side of the matter doesn't matter anymore, but the political shift from an all-syrian ""democratic"" movement towards a sectarian one only served to strengthen Assad (which was probably also why he tacitly supported this development). But the regime also has its weaknesses, especially in the rural/Sunni areas and has/will struggle to regain those areas.   To just denounce my question as ""ill-informed"" is an unbalanced approach. Clearly there are (also) no unbiased sources in this situation, but there is always a grain of truth in each source which should be found."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,badly_xeroxed,8,Tue Jul 14 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"To just denounce my question as ""ill-informed"" is an unbalanced approach.    I didn't call you initial question ""ill-informed"". However, the statements you went on to make certainly are (e.g. ""It seems that the regime has turned the tide against it""). You end by asking another question:   am I just affected by immediate gains which have not changed the general dynamic of the war yet?   I would agree with this with one caveat — the regime really hasn't made any substantial gains yet at all. Sure they will take Zabadani eventually, but at what cost? As for Palmyra, are they really going to attack the city directly (which seems like it would fail) rather than attempting to secure the nearby oil fields (of which ISIS control 80%)?"
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Diogenes__The_Cynic,3,Tue Jul 14 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"Ok. How would you characterise the Aleppo and Deraa fronts? do you think that the many waves of attacks against regime positions with few gains, have had a demoralising effect or do you see this as a long-drawn battle?"
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,IgorProtti,5,Tue Jul 14 14:48:57 2015 UTC,"In Aleppo you have to seriously moderate your expectations within the context of an almost 3 year battle. @Kraybdamoid on Twitter described it recently as ""glacial"", and I think that is accurate, so taking one district (Rashidin in the southwest), capturing a major fortified position (the Research Center in the west), and making inroads into other districts (Khaldiya in the north and New Aleppo in the west) are significant. Daraa is a similar situation which has only just started, with major pressure being put on the regime despite the more limited gains there.  You really have to dispel the notion that if the opposition don't instantly win overnight, then they were ""defeated"". Sure, almost instant victories happen once in a while like the operation in Idlib city and the following one in Jisr Al-Shughour. But the regime has managed to create this impression that if they manage to take back 5% of the territory they lost to opposition forces after the most recent battle, then the Assad regime ""won"" and it was a ""crushing defeat"" for the opposition — meanwhile the opposition retain 95% of the territory they captured. This is a really common ruse they have employed since the start of the conflict, don't be fooled by it."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Paliforever222-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:18:28 2015 UTC,"I do agree with that in general terms. But most major battles are in fact rarely fought in long-drawn ways. In most battles it is a sustained momentum which succeeds in gaining. If you look at how Assad lost control over the country it was mainly in big shocks, the same you can say about other battles (Raqqa, Homs, Tikrit, Mosul, Falluja, Ramadi) it was sudden and quick shifts which secured the main steps forward in these battles (followed or preceded by longer period of lower level tensions). When major offensives are embarked on, especially by battle weary soldiers, stagnation can have big effects on the morale of the troops. So while I don't see a major defeat for the opposition in Aleppo and Deraa the lack of serious steps forward can become a heavy burden on the morale of the two campaigns and severely hamper them. This of course does not mean the whole dynamic of the war in general has changed, but it could play a role in the short term. The way I see it the present situation, if the opposition does not make major gains in the short term, COULD open for a counter attack. But it could also end just there as Assad would not have the forces for a counter-attack. Thus the stalemate in those areas would continue without major losses on each side. (BTW the research center has not been captured has it?)"

syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Phil_Sayers,2,Tue Jul 14 13:04:39 2015 UTC,"Iran is eventually going to toss assad aside. The Iranians are smart, they care about their interests, if anything assad is just a bargaining chip. In exchange for a good nuclear deal, normalization with the US and end to Sanction's, Iran will dump Assad. Iran is supporting the regime for just that. Notice how Iran never sends alot of Iranian troops and soldiers, of course they send commander's, but Iran is smart in that it is achieving its goals by using Iraqi', Afghanis and Shi'a everywhere. It's not losing its citizens, it's not getting it's country destroyed. It's use of proxies to achieve it's goals at the very low expense of it's citizen's lives and infrastructure must not be overlooked. Hezbollah, Assad, the Houthis, they are all tools that Iran will toss aside at any moment if it means advancing it's political agenda. So I don't think the Persians are going to sacrifice more persian lives and further resources, to prop up Assad, once a deal is reached. They are too smart for that."

syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Phil_Sayers,2,Tue Jul 14 20:33:57 2015 UTC,"This is hard to asses. The biggest problem for the government is manpower, because it is an minority backed government. The Alawites compromise only about 10-16% of the population. This would be comparable to a war in the USA between Blacks and Whites.  Of course the SAA has Sunni conscripts among its ranks, but they are low on morale and pretty unreliable. If this war goes on like this the government will collapse at some point. The ace the Syrian government however  has is, that they dispose over the most determined foreign backer namend Iran and they will go with Assad till the bitter end. So the outcome will be determined strongly about what actions Iran still has up in their sleeve. So will Iran be able to fill the gaps of the dead government soldiers with Shia militias mercenaries? Will Iran be able to replace lost military equippment or deliever more of it (I mean the nuclear deal says that Iran cant important weapons for the following 5 years, but will Russia and Iran find a way around it? A key question will also be how long the SyAAF will remain functional. The Syrian government has 100% airsuperiority and this is a huge advantage over the rebels. I would say without the SyAAF Assad would have already fallen by now."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,PaulAJK,3,Tue Jul 14 20:26:11 2015 UTC,This is the key point really. Irrespective of territorial wins and losses the fundamental dynamic of the conflict is that the regime are getting weaker and the rebels are getting stronger.
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Phil_Sayers,2,Tue Jul 14 12:36:10 2015 UTC,"Uh, what about the Kurds, Iraq, Iran, and the US/coalition? Soon the Islamic State will collapse under airstrikes and ground attacks by the Iraqis and Kurds. The Iran deal will give Iran the ability to significantly ramp up support for the Syrian government. After the Islamic State falls, there will be a flood of Shia Iraqis and Iranians pouring into Syria from the east. The US has started bombing al-Nusra. Most of the Syrian population lives in government controlled areas. Ditto for economic activity. Time is not on the rebels' side."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,PaulAJK,0,Tue Jul 14 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"ISIS being pushed back will not benefit the regime as much as you think as the coalition are trying to ensure it is the Kurds and rebels who fill that vacated space. The Iran deal does give them the ability to ramp up support but the Saudis etc could do the same in response.   In the other column manpower, despite the regime controlling the most populous areas, has been a crippling problem for them and that is only going to get worse. Alawites are now openly protesting their losses and fractures are appearing in the community with a number of shootings linked to criminal activities being a sign of the strain. The fractures are also extending to the regime inner circle with various figures either being killed, sacked or fleeing.   Attrition is the real killer though - the armour losses are totally unsustainable and the airforce cannot fly forever. When this war started it was untrained rebels spraying small arms at a well armed military - now the rebels have much more firepower and the regime is increasingly having to use technicals and stuff hauled out of storage."

syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,thisusernamesfree,3,Tue Jul 14 10:46:22 2015 UTC,"Really the fundamental question. The regime is doing slightly better than, say, at the start of the daara offensive, the loss of the research facility, ISIS raids in rural Damascus, and the initial battle for hakasah. But that was like two weeks ago, and a spectacularly shitty time for the regime. Even taking all that into account, things are only going slightly better."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Nycklar,13,Tue Jul 14 13:17:57 2015 UTC,"Let's evaluate the three places you listed.  Pre-war, Zabadani, a resort town on the Syrian/Lebanese border, served as one of Iran's main transit points for Hezbollah logistics (PDF warning). It holds a much greater importance to Hezbollah and Iran than to the strategic security of the Syrian Arab Army. In Jan 2012 it was captured by the FSA. A month later the SAA recaptured. Fighting over the next few years saw half the town go back to FSA (and others) control. By Feb 2014 the SAA recaptured it in totality once more. Only a few months later, the FSA recaptured Zabadani and have held it ever since.  This is the fifth (sixth?) time it changes hands if the SAA/Hezbollah recapture it in it's totality. If they hope to avoid a repeat of the past, they can't just leave the city after capturing it, especially Hezbollah who just spent a costly campaign to clear the western Qalamoun. They will need to garrison troops, supplies, and equipment there or else they risk ANOTHER time where the FSA/JaN et al just march back in after they leave and they have to devote MORE troops, time, and supplies to clearing it again. Zabadani is a Hezbollah priority more than a government priority, so success there is really only limited to protecting the channel for Hezbollah to support the government. It's of very limited value to the rest of the conflict (which is not to undermine or undervalue the considerable progress Hezbollah has made in that region).  Now let's examine Palmyra/Tadmur. One of the largest military bases in Syria (second largest I believe), the airfield, military base, gas fields, and city (nearly 60k people, making it one of the largest in Syrian that Da3sh actively owns), the loss of Palmyra almost overnight with TREMENDOUS stockpiles of arms, armaments, munitions, and serious logistical capabilities is less devastating to the SAA in terms of lost equipment but WAY more devastating in terms of how much stronger it made Da3sh in that region and how much more capable they are to both repel advances and perhaps even spread further from there. The SAA wouldn't even be in the position it is in now if it had exercised tactical and strategic competence to include deploying forces where they could have made a difference instead of continuing to commit troops to hopeless measures to stem the femoral bleeding in the Idlib salient. If Palmyra had never been lost in the first place than Da3sh would have shot its wad in the region and have to regroup and refit before such an assault could be launched again.  Unfortunately, that isn't the situation. The SAA's performance in Palmyra was atrocious and the all out rout ensures that Da3sh is not only resupplied, but that the town itself, Sunni majority and not friendly to the government, was taken intact and enjoys reasonable support from those there. To retake the city will involve tremendous destruction (alienating the locals) and losses on the level that SAA has not previously been willing to suffer to take land. I am certainly hopeful they are able to recapture Palmyra and hold it for good, but I don't think a desperate offensive to recapture what should have NEVER been lost is a good sign that they're ""regaining control"". And furthermore, to prevent a further recapture troops used in an offensive on Palmyra will need to be regarrisoned in Palmyra or risk a repeat offensve by Da3sh as soon as the defense-in-depth leaves the city. If the SAA recaptures Palmyra than the SAA is back to where they were only a month or two ago, far from ""regaining control"" of the country or the conflict.  Finally, Hasakah. Never a strong point for the government it seems almost every 6 months Da3sh mounts an offensive on Hasakah. Usually it results in minimal changes in territory and the SAA generally makes a gradual advance to recapture lost territory. But it was just this past January that the beginnings of an SAA ""offensive"" petered off into nothing after capturing a ""village"" (like 15-20 buildings) or two to east of Hasakah. Hasakah is a far flung outpost dangerously exposed to Da3sh without enough. The most recent events in Hasakah saw a near collapse of SAA territory in southern Hasakah, requiring a transfer of some 300 Republican Guard/Shaitat tribesmen from ANOTHER far-flung outpost in Deir Ezzor. There is no real SAA ""offensive"" going on in Hasakah but rather an attempt to not lose anymore ground than they already have and hopefully an eventual attempt made at recapturing territory that was until only a few weeks ago still in SAA control. If the Da3sh attack stalls out and the SAA is able to recapture the land it previously held, they are similarly in the same spot as in Palmyra- having recaptured what it held only a few weeks ago, and incapable of pushing the offensive beyond that.  The forces committed to these operations are necessary just to recapture and hold that land and are certainly not freed up to go on the offensive elsewhere in the war. Meanwhile, in the past six months the Idlib governorate has all but collapsed, significant portions of Daraa have fallen to the Southern Front and co. and two government offensives failed there, Da3sh is making strong pushes into Homs governorate, Jaish al-Fateh is making serious disruptions in Hama, Latakia governorate is the scene of increasing attacks by insurgent groups, Aleppo has seen territorial losses and a failed government offensive, and countrywide the heavy equipment and armor of the SyAAF and SAA is being attrited to a breaking point that is fastttt approaching.  Things need to change for the SAA and they need to change fast."

Sudan no longer presnts the same sort of threat that could entail some sort of regional power, and Sudan is out of the news.  This is political analysis which is based on real, hard, geo-politics. There's nothing fantastical about it. The US has decided, (probably rightly) that states constitute a bigger threat to it's power than small terror groups exisiting in a vacuum.

Buuut, there are powerful forces who think in longer terms than presidential spans and individual secretaries of state, who can influence policies while staying above the hurly burly. Just as there are in every major county, and even in all historical epochs. The ""deep state"" is a real thing.   It is a very ""reasonable"" plan on the part of long term US FP thinkers (and deep staters) to envision the partion of parts of the ME and Africa into smaller, more potentially compliant states."

That their leaders all made major mistakes which proved fatal is another matter, but the movement in he streets was there right up until the mid 80s where the general wave of revolutions throughout the world ebbed and a new period started. It was in this context and as a direct measure to counter these movements that the US along with the house of Saud started the building up of Islamism as we know it. The left today is completely splintered because it has nothing to do with the mass of people. No movement will express itself through the left, but over time as the mass movements revive there will be a development towards these old traditions."

Look there has been no game changing progress. I would also warn against cracking open the fireworks on Zabadani and Palmyra just yet. Still plenty of fighting to go. Zabadani itself, even if won (which it will be), is just part of the greater Qalamoun operation. They need to take the city and then clear the remaining ISIS presence in the mountains for it to be a victory.   Palmyra is even more problematic. Firstly no one has said they plan to actually take back the town. Could just camp out at the town limits as a forward position. Even if the town is taken, it is just correcting a defeat not making any fresh progress.  Likely rebel success was overblown. Idleb salient was always the weakest link the SAA had. It was in hostile territory and surrounded on 3 sides, rebels were always strongest in the province. The offensives on Aleppo and Daraa fizzled within 2 weeks. Doesn't mean that any success the SAA has in the next 2 weeks should be overblown as well.   No game changers on either side."

The Syrian government will never win as long as the borders are open and terrorist supporting nations keep at their habits. The terrorists will never win because the support for the government and the army is too much.  It's just a race to the bottom to get the upper hand at future negotiations. With that in mind I would say that the government is winning. They haven't collapsed, they still have the majority of the population and cities in their hands. The Army is still running and is still loyal. Iran and Russia have shown that they are willing to continue funding them. Damascus which is the most important city in this entire war is still in their hands and becoming more secure every month.   The most important they also have in their favour is normality. Life is hard in government held areas but it is still going on as normal. Schools are still running, trash is still being taken and people hang around in cafes. The rest is either poorly governed or barely governed at all. It matters a lot when kids have to study for their exams in stressed conditions and go through the frontlines to take exams if they are lucky."

With that in mind I also find it almost inconceivable for the opposition to make any significant gains in the west except for very remote rural areas. The east is another matter though. It will probably by a ""wild west"" (yes I know) for years to come.  I think that there is also a conscious effort from different imperialist forces to wear down all parties so as to be able to affect the negotiations the most."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Fantasist_Troll,-4,Tue Jul 14 10:49:53 2015 UTC,I think the real plan of Obama is to strengthen YPG and it's allies to take over ISIS territory in the east including Deir ez zor. That way they create a very large and stable fighting force that could perceivably threaten Assad to negotiate a favourable deal.  The biggest sticking point is the fact that they want a government that is in their hands. They already gave up hopes of remaking Syria and just want the current Syria to be their puppet state. However their hand got fatally weak the moment they decided to attack Damascus really hard and failed. It's been getting weaker with each passing year. Plus the advantage could swing even bigger into Assads favour depending on how Iran feels in the future. If the war in Iraq ends and they have spare cash floating around. They could move thousands of battle hardned Shia fighters into Syria.
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,thelord4444,2,Tue Jul 14 10:54:17 2015 UTC,The reality is that Obama doesnt care at all about a solution in Iraq and Syria. His only goal is to contain ISIS so that the American public is happy with him.
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,crasher555,0,Tue Jul 14 12:31:41 2015 UTC,"Huh? Kurds have no place in Deir Ezzor. I mean not even Arabs live there, in the desert. I'm also skeptical about ""YPG's allies"" since we received reports that Obama could only find ~60 ""non-sectarian"" rebels to train for his programme."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,borhas,-2,Tue Jul 14 21:35:25 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree. Although they will never allow YPG to become a real force. They might all be fighting each other, but when it comes to a democratic people's movement all the forces of the Middle East can agree to crush it. I think the US sees the YPG as a bargaining chip which they will not hesitate to sacrifice in any deal. That has always been the fate of ""small"" nations, just like the British didn't hesitate to run over the Hashemites and sell them out in a deal with France et al after WW1. That will probably also be the fate of the YPG if they do not accept to ""play along"" the rules of Middle Eastern government. The only chance I see for them is to expand their movement from a Kurdish one to a regional peoples movement aiming at organising democratic, revolutionary forces across the whole region - that would of course be a game changer. But then of course they will have to rely on the movement of the masses and not the aerial support of the US army."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,MacLammond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:31:29 2015 UTC,In regards to the ongoing offensive to retake Palmyra the situation is very grey. The regime forces are making gains to the west of Palmyra and by some accounts even up to the city limits. However the way ISIS fights is extremely effective against minor offensives that are not massive and comprehensive in scale. Even if the regime retakes Palmyra and the gas fields north of the city I believe ISIS will simply strike elsewhere in Homs province. When a jab is thrown at ISIS they melt away and attack a more vulnerable area. Eventually they will likely shift their offensives away from the Kurdish north towards areas where the US/coalition jets do not operate.
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,Paliforever222-,0,Tue Jul 14 12:57:44 2015 UTC,"ISIS is committing a lot of troops to Hasakah, Fallujah and Ayn Issa at the moment and they are meeting some fierce fighting in DeZ...This might be the best shot the SAA has of retaking the city....But they can't stop there, they desperately need to link DeZ & Palmyra."
syriancivilwar,3d8jo8,walkerbulldog1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:24:36 2015 UTC,Yeah it looks like the Assad regime is slowly counteracting ISIS expansion with help of international air strikes and the Kurdish forces to the east and to the west Hezbollah are shoring up strategic terrain so that the main rebel groups can't engage in guerrilla warfare.

Here is an example of the things he approved of and ordered:   According to an official report of the Fourth General Ispectorate, 13,160 civilians were killed by the Turkish Army and 11,818 people were taken into exile, depopulating the province.[5] According to the Dersimi, many tribesmen were shot dead after surrendering, and women and children were locked into haysheds which were then set on fire.[42] According to McDowall, 40,000 people were killed.[1] According to Kurdish Diaspora sources, over 70,000 people were killed.[43]   These are the things his followers, basically the people who are a product of Kemalism, did:   Through the far-right MHP, Türkeş took the rightist views of his predecessors like Nihal Atsız, who is known for his explicitly racist views [9][10] and transformed them into a powerful political force. In 1965, Türkeş released a political pamphlet titled ""Dokuz Işık Doktrini"" (Nine Lights Doctrine). This text listed nine basic principles which formed the basis of the nationalist ideology. These were nationalism, idealism, moralism, societalism, scientism, ""independentism"", ruralism, progressivism, populism, industrialism, and technologism.[11]"

Shaikh Said is an example to be followed by not just Kurd or Turk, but by every member of the sunni community.   He was a devout and pious man, and his ideology is in stark contrast to that of the ""radical Islamists"" you probably group him in with.   P.s. Only two groups have ever disallowed the visiting of religious places (in specific zawiyas, tekkes, and graves). The ""radical Islamists"" you speak of such as isis, and Mustafa Kemal."

syriancivilwar,3d8x2p,irishprivateer,2,Fri Jul 17 01:34:42 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about Said Kurdi, he is a bad intended(can be replaced with cursing here) person and religion merchant. He is nuts, he claims stupid stuff like talking to imaginary things, talking to stove etc.  Mustafa Kemal didn't ban visiting religious places. But graves of religion merchants like Said(if it is the one I'm talking about) are definetely not religious places. Ataturk is the man who saved the religion from the religion merchants."
syriancivilwar,3d8x2p,foop_plinger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:44:42 2015 UTC,"Shaikh said rahimullah. Zaza. Most likely we are referencing the same Shaikh.   A religious statement such as ""every object will speak on the day of judgement as a witness"" can be flipped into ""a crazy guy saying stoves will speak"" etc, and it still happens to this day when one cannot stand in an honorable fashion to defend his views against an individual, in other words, they slander.   Shaikh said was a shaykh of the naqshbandiyya, maybe not learned in politics or military, but learned in the religion. The same cannot be said of ataturk who in terms of religion was extremely weak, making horrendous errant fatwas such as it was ok for Muslims to drink alcohol to become intoxicated and for women to expose themselves to strange men. In other words, he had no right to talk about religion whatsoever as in terms of Islamic learning mustafa Kemal was close to illiterate (or acted as such).  He saved turkey by his military prowess and political cunning, not by his views on religion, which were used as a political tool in his political successes, not as an ideological tool of guidance for his people.  As for mustafa Kemal ataturk banning visits of religious places, you're right I take that back, you can't ban what you shut down or turn into museums. I don't believe in cursing individuals who are dead. Ataturk fooled you, so that in his mind he could save the Turkish nation, which he did.  Edit* anyways this will get off topic, we can disagree, but there is honor for the Kurds in the path of shaykh said, and self determination, which is more important than the nationalistic feelings of any particular nation. Let's just disagree on this matter bro, and move on."
syriancivilwar,3d8x2p,YK42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:28:27 2015 UTC,"ens to this    He claims to speaking to the stove, not saying that every object will speak. 14th shaft, he claims that stove talks back to him.  Ataturk never said it is ok to drink alcohol for Muslims. He knew that drinking alcoohl was sin but anyone who experience half of what Ataturk did, would immediately start drinking. In fact he starts drinking too much after the early years of republic, probably because he always had a life that  he spent fighting against exploiting and imperialism.  He was attacked as ""infidel"" by Ottoman dynasty and Ottoman dynasty called Turks to help Greek army and kill the infidel who was the hero of Çanakkale some time ago but people like Mehmet Akif Ersoy, he made speech in Konya, one of the most religious cities in Turkey about how Muslims should support Mustafa Kemal. Also people saw that who was the traitor to the nation and religion and who was the hero for the nation and religion when Greeks started to rape and burn down villages, loot everything, when every minority started to loot and attack everywhere with their brand new British or French rifles.  There are many mosques around Hagia Sophia. Suleymaniye, New Mosque, etc(and they are gigantic). So we didn't need Hagia Sophia to be a mosque.  Said was essentially a Kurdish nationalist. Yeah, Kurdish nationalists can follow him but having a mad person as a leader would damage your reputation a lot."

Russian statements supporting a negotiated end to the war and a post-Assad government are merely lip service to the idea of democracy; their actions towards that idea have been minimal or cursory. England, France and the European Union want the US to cool down and stop pushing sanctions and isolate so they can resume business as usual and moderate Iran.  Ever since the United States had to back down from the 'red line' and the emergence of al-Qaeda affiliates and especially Islamic State as the most realistic post-Assad alternative government of Syria, they obviously have dropped Assad's removal as their number one priority.

Not only this, but this instability is threatening the whole region (Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Gulf States, Egypt, North Africa) Did the west have a hand in pushing the movement towards a civilwar, I think it did because it thought that it could ride the movement, force regime change quickly and then dominate the new regime somehow (whether this is a delusional idea of theirs is another matter).

B. The present chaos has forced the US to make a deal with Iran. A deal which is angering every single ally of the US in the region, but which is necessary because of the inability of the US to engage in more wars. That is, they need Iran because they have been weakened by their previous wars (which created a mess as you would have seen.)  C.

(financially and politically) as a result of the huge flow of dollars and foreign assists in Iran. If the second scenario happens, this means that there would be 2 totally different approaches for the interference in syria for the US/EU/Turkey (benefited from the deal) on one hand and Gulf countries  (losers from the deal) on the other hand."

I think both parties recognized that this deal needed to be ""on topic""  if Syria was on the table then Yemen, Israel, Lebanon, etc. are also on the table.  The deal only addresses economic sanctions, nuclear program, and the enforcement of the conditions.  Factoring in things like Syria, Iraq, etc. would just make it even harder/impractical to grind out the details, and almost impossible to enforce."

This is both to counter the inevitable increase that Iran will provide Assad and a way of making their displeasure known. It's also a kind of shoot the moon. If Iran loses the ability to acquire nukes and loses even further in Syria, it doesn't really matter to KSA that they have extra money to play around with. The Saudis will have them beat in terms of sheer cashflow, the Americans will still be working to counter them in Iraq, and Hezbollah still won't be able to gain any gamechanging abilities thanks to Israel. They're still going to be pouring a ton of money into Iraq to defeat a mutual enemy, while the KSA gives next to none. If Assads position deteriorates significantly further in Syria, no realistic amount of money is going to ever win him back the country.  I'm also wondering - will this extra money do assad that much good at this point? The problems with the SAA really isnt it's lack of cash, it's a calcified command structure, inability to adapt to battlefield conditions or apparently lean ANY lessons, general incompetence, and low morale and poor training. Extra cash might help with some of those problems, but pouring more water into a draining tub doesn't change the ultimate outcome."

Regarding the deal's impact on Syria, I don't think it will make much difference. My instinct is that the U.S. has been holding back from finding a solution in Syria in order to increase its leverage on Iran throughout the nuclear negotiations. Now that a deal is done, the U.S. may show more flexibility. However, from Iran's point of view, very little will change from a strategic perspective. Indeed, Iran's position in Syria may now be strengthened by increased domestic national security and international legitimacy.  edit: I've had to evacuate my office due to a fire alarm.

His strategy of trying to hide behind the US military to do so has clearly failed because Obama isn't the moron that GWB was. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, can't defeat a bunch of rebels in Yemen, let alone the entire Iranian military.  Israel will continue whining and maybe exert more pressure on Hezbollah.

syriancivilwar,3d8az4,Barristan-Selmy,2,Tue Jul 14 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think this deal will affect the Syrian War as much as everyone seems to think. Firstly, Iran has a lot of economic problems to deal with. Lifting sanctions is going to expose Iranian manufacturing and industry to outside competition they haven't really faced in a decade. If they don't invest heavily in job creation, they're going to end up with a very upset group of young people, and Iran is mostly young people.   While in the long run this is a great thing for Iran, they're going to have their hands full for the next few years.   This is largely irrelevant, though. The Shia militias aren't all that expensive to supply, and as long as they eventually beat ISIS in Iraq and Assad doesn't fall completely, Iran will have a direct land route to Syria and a large, well armed fighting force. Which is really all they need to secure their interests."

It would have been a direct competitor with the Qatar-Turkey pipeline.  Now that ISIS has infiltrated the no-man's land between Iraq and Syria, it's going to be very difficult establishing a safe and consistent pipeline or even a decent railroad between the three countries.

You've already made it clear that you think I have no right to speak on the crimes of the Kurdish people.  You bring up exceptional cases of Kurdish nobility in aiding Turkmen in certain areas, yet you are oblivious (or unwilling to admit) of the opportunistic Kurdish expansionism given the preoccupation of the Syrian and Iraqi governments with extremist takfiri groups. No surprise that ethnic cleansing and persecution of Turkmen groups occur in oil-rich areas like Kirkuk which have been land-grabbed by the Kurds in attempt to create a monopoly on Iraqi oil infrastracture. What the Kurds in Iraq are doing is illegal and completely unconstitutional. I repeat - what would happen to me if I did the same in Iraqi Kurdistan, except selling to Iran? Gallows probably.   The Kurdistan Gas and Oil Law of 2007 prohibits the Kurds from entering into foreign contracts with regards to Iraqi oil without prior consent and cooperation with the Iraqi government in Baghdad. Article 111 states that ""oil and gas are owned by all the people in Iraq in all regions and governorates"". The Federal Council of Representatives is the only collective entity which represents the collective will of the Iraqi people (see section 49 of the constitution).   You don't need me on your side. You already have ExxonMobile,  Gazprom, and Israel as your allies in your mission of Kurdish autonomy."

Besides that, are we supposed to be ethnically cleansing Turkmens? Dude, wake up, it's your Arab brothers who are doing that:  Al Qaeda ethnically cleansing Turkmens in Tuz Khormato; http://www.alternet.org/story/76178/the_surrender_is_working%3A_u.s._cedes_town_to_%27al_qaeda_in_iraq%27  ISIS attacking Turkmens:    The Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham (ISIS) slaughtered about 700 Turkmen civilians last month, including ""children, women, and old people,"" United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) Iraq chief Marzio Babille told Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (ANSA)   Saddam ethnically cleansing Turkmens in Kirkuk:   Vice-president of the Turkmen Assembly Tariq Zeynel Koprulu stated that, ""Turkmen society is prepared to give due justice for the cruelties."" Koprulu stated cases will be opened in two different ways: firstly, on massacres and death penalties imposed on Turkmens; secondly, a suit for emotional damages.   Kurds have been the best for Turkmens. Better than Turkey. Better than Iraq. Turkmens have a permanent seat in Kurdish parliament while not having it in Iraq and not even able to start something in Syria.   Funny by the way that you claim that ''ethnicity'' doesn't matter yet in your other comment you say ''i am kizilbash and turkmens blablabla''. Your hate on Kurds is exposed and comes from the anti-Kurdish propaganda among Turkics. I have already showed you that it's false. But nonetheless, I don't even see you as Turkic but Iranic and I see you as my brother. It's just sad that Iranics are hating on Iranics."

syriancivilwar,3d8cf3,degestani,6,Tue Jul 14 08:20:50 2015 UTC,"Well, the Taliban are a fundamentalist Hanafi Sunni organization, while Salafists are fundamentalist Hanbali Sunnis. While there are indeed theological differences between the two, in practice they apply Sharia law rather similarly. As you said, the biggest difference is that the Taliban take traditional Pashtun laws into account as well.  As for who Juan Cole is, he's one of the top Middle East Studies professors at the University of Michigan. He's considered one of the most influential scholars in his field, unfortunately. His specialty is the Arab Israeli conflict, and he is indeed an expert on that topic, but he clearly isn't too versed in Islamic jurisprudence."

It was certainly more informative than the AAH propaganda WashPo published without comment, context, or explanation.  That article was probably the first time WashPo discussed AAH in detail;  it deserved a response.   Any comparison between Syria and Afghanistan is going to be weak, but the state the Taliban has sought to implement over the years is probably the closest thing to what AAH and JAN are going for that the American public can easily understand."

There's also the fact that AAS was created by an EX Bin Laden confidante, so there's that, nothing moderate about a group which many times stated that they would like Syria to become a caliphate, that's kind of what the Taliban wants and has somehow achieved in many parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan where chaos reigns nowadays.  JAN is a bit more of a comparison to the Taliban to be quite honest but the difference between JAN and AAS is so minimal that there isn't anything to argue about here."

Maybe it is born in the heart of Arabia?  My reading recommendation to you are two essays by Alastair Crooke:  ""You Can't Understand ISIS If You Don't Know the History of Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia"" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/isis-wahhabism-saudi-arabia_b_5717157.html  ""Middle East Time Bomb: The Real Aim of ISIS Is to Replace the Saud Family as the New Emirs of Arabia"" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/isis-aim-saudi-arabia_b_5748744.html"
syriancivilwar,3da4b9,2A1ZA,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"Some people, if not most, seem incapable of combining several different variables or perspectives when dealing with moral or political issues. You don't need to be either critical of Western foreign policies or of the beliefs and actions of everybody else involved. It's necessary to condemn crimes and mistakes wherever they come from; terrorists aren't something that spawns from the desert naturally whenever the West interferes, they are as much free agents, as human as any Western politician or soldier that meddles and just as culpable for their beliefs and actions.   It's good to be objective, but then you have to be objective everywhere at once and not just wherever it's convenient for your argument, like when you need to concentrate the blame on somebody in particular to fit your own biases and narrative. Thanks to those incapable of objectivity, terrorist types and fanboys can easily use that narrative as a foundation to build up their own... If it becomes accepted fact, for almost everybody, that simply the US or the West is to blame for millions of dead Muslims with their ""war on terror"", how hard is it to change some words to ""Crusaders"" and ""massacred"" to rile up support.  Self-described liberals panic and scream ""racism"" if ""terrorist"" becomes synonymous with ""Middle Easterner"" or ""Muslim"" for a bunch of simpletons, or they scream ""islamophobia"" in defense of Muslims' feelings if Charlie Hebdo draws a cartoon, but then they fail to make the effort to actually distinguish terrorist or intolerant ideologies from the ones in line with their supposed liberalism, or treat the rest of the Muslims as anything other than helpless puppets of the West with no agency, treating terrorism as an expected symptom of Western interference. Either it's in the nature of the West to destroy the Middle East and in the nature of the Middle East to spawn ISIS types in response, or both parts of the world are filled with good and bad people and ideologies that can be judged by the same standards. If the former describes the general situation objectively until now and if the latter gives us the normative perspective on where to go from here, it's a tragic mistake to mix them up to fit one's own egoistic agenda."
syriancivilwar,3da4b9,tiosls,2,Tue Jul 14 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you consider this nice text as a reply to my comment above. On substance, I would reply to your text that there can and should be detached objectivity and no judgement in description and analysis (that is what my comment was about). Normative judgement, however, needs an apriori set of values."
syriancivilwar,3da4b9,2A1ZA,0,Tue Jul 14 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry for hijacking your comment, I just wanted to hitch on. I don't disagree with what you said, of course, I just don't think your response usually gets across to the people it should.  These people won't admit to the homegrown nature of those ideologies because their narrative makes it too convenient no to. Even if it does get called homegrown, it still becomes the fault of the US via it's connection to Saudi Arabia or something similar. So, the narrative hides the biased application of the normative judgement with half-truths. The fault doesn't lie with the set of values the judgments are usually based on, it's with those half-truths. Pointing out the facts won't stop people from ignoring important aspects of what's happening, because they'll just see more ways to get to their own conclusion. They lack neither the knowledge of the facts nor the moral values, their attention is misplaced."

syriancivilwar,3da4b9,2A1ZA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that most people are so biased that they're incapable of getting things right, even when they have all the right facts and even the right moral values. In this case, trying to stop terrorism by blaming everything else, but the most important factors, all because you don't want to point out the real problem that exists within the society, will lead to inadvertently dehumanizing those you're trying to protect.  I was giving the example of how it goes in the West. If you spend your time blaming terrorism on the actions of the West, while also trying to stop anti-Muslim bigotry by separating the Muslims from Islamist terrorists for the general public, with no real explanation of the true nature of the problem, the only message you send is that Islam and Muslims are proto-terrorists, since all it takes is the right circumstances to set them off. It's not the West that created the terrorism, the ideology did. But as long as all the attention is aimed at blaming the West, nothing gets done. Even the problem gets dismissed as islamophobia."

syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,goose3311,5,Mon Jul 13 17:48:34 2015 UTC,A truce with IS would probably be diplomatic suicide for Assad: even Russia agrees that ISIS is an enemy that has to be defeated.
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,sQank,2,Mon Jul 13 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"""even"". Russia has been battling islamists and terrorists for decades now."

syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,goose3311,0,Mon Jul 13 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"No, this kind of ""weird truce"" doesnt work. These people hate each other and will fight for every meter at any time of the day."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,sQank,5,Mon Jul 13 19:50:50 2015 UTC,Thats simply not true. There have been long-term periods of quiet and informal local truces between IS and SAA troops on multiple occasions. Pretending otherwise doesn't negate that fact. The SAA divisional base north of Raqqa was left mostly alone for quite some time after IS took the city. Many accounts indicated an informal ceasefire agreement to allow the two parties to focus on more pressing foes.

IS can't get rid of its forces there because the city is at the center of IS's water-based transportation and losing any ground will be extremely baneful."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,ablaaa,2,Mon Jul 13 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on ""IS's water-based transportation""? Are they using the Euphrates extensively for transportation? Is this kind of riverine transportation common for the region of unique to ISIS (due to the threat of airstrikes, fuel shortages, or some other reason)?"

syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,ablaaa,3,Mon Jul 13 19:29:03 2015 UTC,The U.S. Released a detailed list of their ISIS targets a couple months ago and it listed 50+ boats targeted. I also saw the other day a memorial or whatever of an IS fighter and it said he was like a Moroccan sailer and helped the caliphate that way and showed him in a boat full of ISIS fighters.

syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,3xistentialcrisis,14,Mon Jul 13 18:32:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's part of Assad's ""army in all corners"" strategy. It's more political than economic - the government wants to someday reconquer all of Syria, and doesn't want the country to be partitioned. If they confine their forces to defending their contiguous chunk of territory in the west, they're closer to relinquishing their claim over north/east Syria.  Just my hypothesis though."

syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,3xistentialcrisis,2,Mon Jul 13 21:19:16 2015 UTC,"Well it is at least pretty effective against ISIS. It cuts ISIS territory in half and this battlefield enflicted heavy casualties on them. If Assad would decide to withdraw the troops there it would be a huge setback in the fight against ISIS. Plus the freed ISIS troops would probably conquer more crucial land in central syria, like the oilfields, they would endager the supply line between Homs and Damascus nas Hasakah and probably the whole east of Syria will be probably gone for good or at least for a very long time."

Assad has been pretty clear that he intends to hold onto power for as long as physically possible, even if it means burning and barrel bombing the parts of Syria he relinquished control of.  Also, the rebellion has been going on for far too long with far too many lives lost for any of the major Islamist rebel groups to agree to any plan of peace that leads to Assad or any members of his Baath party still exerting control over Syria.  That leaves only the Southern Front and YPG in Syria as possibly being willing to negotiate a peace plan, and it's already clear that YPG will most likely be granted autonomy in their cantons in northern Syria regardless of who wins the war and even if the Southern Front agreed to a peace plan (which is extremely unlikely at this point), that still wouldn't lead to a stop or noticeable change in the fighting in northern or eastern Syria."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,2A1ZA,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:31:23 2015 UTC,"All fighting parties depend on outside support. It is irrelevant what they ""want"" if their outside support does not agree.  And with a secular government in Turkey, the war in Syria is over."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,MurrayMania,3,Mon Jul 13 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"That may have been true at the beginning of the war but all factions are now flush with heavy weapons, either from their international support or from weapons seized from the SAA or by ISIS in Iraq that was then brought over the border to be used in Syria.  Also, there are plenty of private donors from the Gulf states and other Arab nations that will continue funneling money to support some of these groups.  Realistically, at this point it is irrelevant what their outside supporters ""want"", as many of these groups have enough weapons and manpower to continue the fight for at least a couple of years without any more outside support and you're crazy if you truly believe that any of these governments currently covertly supporting these groups would be willing to cut of all support and also send in their militaries to stabilize the situation in Syria."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,2A1ZA,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:01:43 2015 UTC,"If you really believe that any of the fighting parties (Assad included) could fight for more than a month without support of outside state sponsors ... then, well, I would say you misread the situation.  And any ""private donors"" are of no use at all without the path to transfer men and weapons across the borders of neighbouring states."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,MurrayMania,4,Mon Jul 13 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"At this point in the conflict I believe it's not unreasonable to think that outside of YPG receiving coalition airstrikes to help their advances that Assad is more heavily reliant on outside state sponsors in the form of credit lines, IRGC commanders and sponsored fighters sent from Iran and supplies and maintenance crews for helicopters and planes from Russia than any of the rebel groups in the conflict.  The flow of money and weapons are important to keep your fighters happy and motivated but if all outside state sponsors pulled their support Assad would be in much more trouble than the rebels or ISIS would be."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,2A1ZA,-2,Mon Jul 13 21:28:01 2015 UTC,"The question of which fighting party is most dependable is only theoretically interesting. The point is, if and when all relevant outside state sponsors agree on a framework, it will be an offer no fighting party can refuse. And the only fundamental obstacle to such agreement are the two delusional Islamists in Ankara I mentioned before. Take them out of the picture, and the remaining diplomacy gets so simple, even Obama could do it."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,MurrayMania,3,Mon Jul 13 21:39:10 2015 UTC,"But they will never agree on a framework that caters to all of their interests.  Iran is hellbent on supporting Assad until the very end as a friendly government is important for them to keep open their pipeline to Hezbollah in Lebanon.    This is a nonstarter for the Gulf states led by SA and Qatar, as they are hellbent on getting a Sunni led government into power so they can have a friendly ally.    All that would happen if all of the outside state sponsors pull out of this conflict is what's currently happening in Libya after pretty much all of the outside state sponsors abandoned the country after they forced Gaddafi out of power, which is a nation in complete disarray with warlords still vying for power and control."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,2A1ZA,-2,Mon Jul 13 21:48:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe I did not make my point clear enough. I do not think that other state actors will lose interest in Syria and abandon it. I think that once Erdogan or at least Davutoglu are gone, it will be pretty easy to construct a framework all relevant actors (except the islamists, both Salafists and the ""Muslim Brotherhood"") can live with, if only for fear of otherwise completely losing all influence to others."

Even AKP's Abdullah Gül disagrees with the islamist policies of the wannabe-Caliph towards Syria.  Syrians will by all probability get the option to choose a secular, federalist-democratic Syria (Iran will prefer that over the risk of completely losing influence in Syria).

syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,Axter,3,Tue Jul 14 00:09:22 2015 UTC,Yes they've been working together for the entire war actually. I guess  the separation has something to do with the fact that Nusra is part of an international organization (AQ) and isn't necessarily just a 'rebel' faction.
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,warsie,2,Tue Jul 14 01:38:13 2015 UTC,"Ahh, ok. Makes sense. I remember stories of FSA units suddenly decling their full loyalty to Al-Nusra.  What's the relations between Al Nusra and ISIS? I've seen shit from al Nusra trying to keep ISIS and FSA from killing each other, to Al-Nusra fighting ISIS, to Al Nusra saying they're under ISIS command, to Al Nusra getting bombed by the US with ISIS forces when the US was funding Al Nusra literally a year before than to lol wat."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,Axter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:41:12 2015 UTC,"Ideologically there's practically no difference between Nusra and ISIS. The reason why those two factions are at war is political, rather than religious/sectarian. They were very good allies, until Baghdadi decided ""Fuck Zawahiri (leader of AQ) Imma found my own caliphate"" and declared that anyone who isn't loyal to ISIS is an apostate. Initially there were a lot of defections from Nusra to ISIS.  For example in western Qalamoun due to the isolation both are still allies despite their official state of war.  I don't think that US has ever directly funded Nusra. Despite letting them exist US still remembers that they're part of AQ. However it's possible that some of the non-lethal aid to the rebels, or the equipment captured when they destroyed Harakat Hazm has ended up in Nusra's hands."

syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,Axter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:27:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right about that. I simplified it a bit too much.   Let's put it this way:   Both JaN and IS have the same end goal, which is establishing an global islamic caliphate. They both believe in pretty much the same hardline salafist interpretation of Islam.  However where they largely differ is the road to the goal and the measures used to get there. Like you said IS is much more aggressive in this regard when compared to JaN, at least for now.   Zawahiri and al-Jolani both know that they can't anger the other rebel factions too much, let alone the world. They're working hard to improve their image as just another force looking to depose Assad, whereas IS is purposefully trying to get as much attention as possible.   Given the chance JaN will absolutely resort to the same measures. Their ideology dictates that everyone who is not sunni muslim, has to convert or die. They will have zero qualms about massacring all the minorites in Syria, or destroying any other group that get's too buddy-buddy with the West (example Harakat Hazm)  They're simply refraining from it, to avoid global/local backlash."
syriancivilwar,3d4qzk,warsie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:45:46 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that makes sense. So they're being nice to other groups because they have to.  I thought Al-Qaeda (Al-Nusra) was more of the 'make peopel into dhimmis' or whatnot, similar to what ISIS has been doing in the christian areas they control.  Would this backlash be something happenign forever though? As in, is Al Nusra getting aid and recruits from other countries because they are being 'moderate' islamists and not as unchained as ISIL?"

Correct, at least for the time being.   As in, is Al Nusra getting aid and recruits from other countries because they are being 'moderate' islamists and not as unchained as ISIL?   I'm not quite sure how much external aid IS receives, but JaN has been through out the conflict heavily supported by private gulf donors. That's partly why they're regarded as the most effective rebel fighting force.  Acting moderate appears to be somewhat poor recruitment tactic for those looking to join the jihad, especially now that they have IS a 'competitor' for those possible recruits. Positive side is that it has managed to keep most of the heat off Nusra's back.  Many/a lot of JaN's fighters defected to IS and al-Jolani had to pull all kinds of tricks to keep rest of them going as well. Likely vast majority, if not almost all new foreign fighters are probably joining IS."

He made one called ""Salam Ala Dawla"" back in 2012 and also ""Jabhat'na Mansura"" when Al Nusra came into prominence in late 2012/early 2013.

syriancivilwar,3d8ums,Paliforever222-,3,Tue Jul 14 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"Assad isolated in the middle. Turkey in the North through her proxies of course.The Kurds, though they will have a cold peace with Turkey. Southern front, supported by israel and Jordan. As for isis and alnusra, I hope they will be destroyed, and their territories will become a free for all for everyone else. This will continue for, God knows how long, until all outside forces stop supporting different factions, but Syria will be stuck in this cold war like state, until suddenly the funding stops, and the factions who lose funding first, suddenly start collapsing. This is the best case scenario. Worse case scenario, ok lets say Assad loses Damascus, and gets captured as he flees than executed. Yay the rebels have won, right? Wrong! Assadi loyalists, the rebels will most certainly start fighting each other over who gets to control what, like Libya after gaddafi, but ten times worse. The second part of the syrian civil war, this time, multiple warlords and factions, but now, even more confusing, because it wont be Regime vg rebels anymore. It will be Assadi remnants, FSA, Islamists, for another 20 years.... Let me put it this way for you in a funny way, did the Empire collapse when the Emperor, Darth Vader and the second death star got destroyed? Nope, as episode VII will show, the fighting has continued for another 30 years, this time with different grand moffs and what not. But anyway, the syrian civil war wont end with assads removal... Because, as sad as this may sound... The Syrian Civil War is only in it's first phase. The Lebanese civil war had many phases after all, now Imagine syria... 50 times worse."
syriancivilwar,3d8ums,Paliforever222-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:31:53 2015 UTC,Good points! You're right about this conflict not ending anytime soon exactly because of the SAA remnants and the long term influence the Assad regime had in Syria.
syriancivilwar,3d8ums,VCGS,2,Tue Jul 14 16:49:44 2015 UTC,"Best case scenario (most likely scenario IMO): Daesh is slowly defeated and scattered in Iraq forcing them to retreat to Syrian strongholds where they are also eventually defeated by a combination of Rebel, SAA, Kurdish and coalition forces across the country. Daesh territory is split amongst these groups depending on proximity to it.  SAA and rebel forces continue to tussle, SAA gains some ground, loses some ground, rebels the same. One side will probably gain the upperhand but won't be able to finish the other. Eventually maybe years down the line when they're both sick of fighting and with pressure from their external supporters, the SAA and some rebel groups call a truce in order to fight remaining extremist groups like Nusra and then subsequently form a transitional/unity government.   Worst case scenario: Daesh maintains most it's strongholds in Syria and Iraq and it continues to project power, launch offensives and terrorist attacks. Rebels overthrow the regime with increased foreign support. Soon after they descend into country wide infighting due to the power vacuum and no longer having a common cause to fight. See Libya post gaddafi but with worse due to the number of combatants and the armaments they have access to. Daesh uses this time to expand further potentially becoming too strongly rooted to remove without western ground forces committing to the fight. Syria ends up in a state of perpetual conflict for another 10+ years at a minimum."

syriancivilwar,3d8ums,Goldilocks-smile,2,Tue Jul 14 18:06:54 2015 UTC,"I think the best case scenario is Turkish and coalition enforced safe zones that forces Assad to the negotiation table.  He agrees to leave Syria and goes to live in the south of France.  A new provisional government takes power and a written constitution is formed with input and consent by all the major factions (except ISIS) and some kind of federated state is created where the federal governments role is extremely limited and most regions are self governed.  Later after stability is established the new Syrian government hires a bounty hunter and returns Assad to Syria to get justice.  (He has killed to many children and innocents, he needs justice, the same the Iraqi's gave to Saddam.)  The worst case is the war grinds on till all the native Syrians are dead and the war becomes foreign fighters against foreign fighters and Syrian refugees can never return to saftey."

syriancivilwar,3d5rjr,iidduunnoo,3,Mon Jul 13 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, they're advancing through pretty much empty desert and there's no indication ISIS is putting up any resistance yet aside from a single ambush. There is zero precedent for the SAA being able to storm or capture a settlement of Palmyra's size and it seems very unlikely that they'll be able to given its remote location and the huge degradation of regime forces. At best they might be able to shell it for a while and gain a toehold while suffering a lot of attrition through ISIS ambushes and raids, and trying to maneuver in and around the city is just going to play into ISIS's hands and expose infantry and armoured formations to attack."
syriancivilwar,3d5rjr,occupykony,3,Mon Jul 13 21:24:41 2015 UTC,"They don't need to capture the city, just encircle/contain it in order to minimize the threat to surrounding gas fields and supply lines.

syriancivilwar,3d64lk,Ian_W,3,Mon Jul 13 23:05:15 2015 UTC,"Yep. And did you notice the way one of them says 'Islamic State' as that, and not Da3sh, the way people who dont like them describe it.  Da3sh had collaborators."
syriancivilwar,3d64lk,Xray330,4,Tue Jul 14 03:03:49 2015 UTC,So anyone saying IS is a collaborator? That means half this sub are collaborators....

syriancivilwar,3d64lk,Moh7,4,Tue Jul 14 04:36:12 2015 UTC,"TIL referring to ISIS as ISIS literally means you support ISIS.   TIL literally obama is an ISIS supporter.  Please stop being so childish, no one wants to play these elementary games."

Arabs, Turkmen and so on are welcome back to Tal Abayed, and every other liberated area.  Collaborators know who they are, and are unwilling to return because they fear being informed on and then subject to the justice system.  That isnt ethnic cleansing."
syriancivilwar,3d64lk,Moh7,3,Tue Jul 14 04:17:11 2015 UTC,"........ because ISIS isn't an Arabic word.. ISIS is an English word and an English abbreviation. Its amazing that you can write off what 70 families had to say because you heard ""dawlah al islamiah"" in fact its a straight up childish mentality that you people have towards this.   Please grow up already, you don't care about what these people are going through, all you care about is the YPG looking like angels."
syriancivilwar,3d64lk,Ian_W,0,Tue Jul 14 04:25:46 2015 UTC,"Da3sh, on the other hand, is an arabic word.  Its what people who arent part of a-Baghdadi's pretend caliphate use to describe it and them.  Collaborators and fellow-travellers, on the other hand, dont like using it, and use ""dawlah al islamiah"" .  Residents are moving back.  Some of them wont.  One of the things that makes Da3sh work as a state is they do actually have local supporters, who agree that al-Baghdadi's vision on how to run the world is a good one.  It isnt a surprise that these people dont want to go back to an area where YPG have free movement."
syriancivilwar,3d64lk,Moh7,0,Tue Jul 14 04:33:10 2015 UTC,"Da3sh is an insult that's mostly used by kurds and the westernworld, most arabs don't even know that Da3sh is a word for ISIS. This is elementary school shit."
syriancivilwar,3d64lk,ghrarib,3,Tue Jul 14 04:50:11 2015 UTC,"No, Da3sh or Daesh is the Arabic acronym just like ISIS or ISIL is the English acronym. What is an acronym?"
syriancivilwar,3d64lk,ghrarib,2,Tue Jul 14 09:40:32 2015 UTC,Is this man an Arab?  Da3esh or Da'esh is the Arabic acronym. Number 3 represents letter ع
syriancivilwar,3d64lk,Moh7,2,Tue Jul 14 10:02:09 2015 UTC,"Daesh is popular because of its double meaning. I never claimed that not a single Arab used it.   This whole argument is beyond stupid. The fact that you people write off what 70 family members said just because someone used dawlah Islamiah instead of daesh shows your true colours.   Keep being ignorant, you can't fuck with the truth, in the end it always comes back to bite you."

syriancivilwar,3d5eiv,DistortedLines,5,Mon Jul 13 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"What world do you live in? Do you expect the SAA to have ignored Homs and the rebels?  Just in case you are up the ass of too much propaganda. The very first thing those so called rebels including Farouq brigade did was engage in criminality. They started to attack and kidnap Alawites and Christians while attacking anyone that was pro-government. All of homs was a fucking tinderbox. People were getting armed ready to attack anybody from a different sect. If you were a Sunni you couldn't drive past an Alawite area without fearing an attack, Alawite teachers couldn't even go and teach kids in rebel held areas just incase they were murdered.  The best thing that happened to the area was the SAA arriving. The people of Rableh were lucky that they didn't end up like the Christians of Qusayr or old homs. The SAA came just in time to rescue them when Farouq brigade surrounded them and kidnapped a couple of their residents."

By being hostile towards a population already viewing the initial peaceful demonstrators with skepticism and doubt, these actions were the confirmation the Alewites (and Christians and druze etc.) needed to stop differentiating between secular and non-secular, and instead go the most logical and sane route, which was:  Play it safe and stay with a gov't from which the won't have to fear reprisals of any sort, so long as they stay loyal (i.e. allow their men to be conscripted for all eternity).   I can't blame Alewites for not trusting anti-Assad people as much as you can't blame a German for remaining ""loyal"" to his Fuhrer."

syriancivilwar,3d4blr,Shadow-Seeker,6,Mon Jul 13 15:40:11 2015 UTC,Have there been many successful operations by the 4th or Republican Guard recently and where are they usually stationed?
syriancivilwar,3d4blr,SaxonMeister,7,Mon Jul 13 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"the 104th has been heavily deployed over the course of years: Damascus, Darayya, Aleppo and now Deir. They are proven soldiers in combined arms, thanks to their highly competent commander Gen. Issam Zahreddine.  the 105th hasn't had very intense deployment as far as I know but participated in a lot of Ghouta/Dimashq operations. I think they are the least competent brigade overall, don't have the equipment of the 106th or the strategy/experience of the 104th.  The 106th Brigade is of course famous for Anna News and Jobar, with its heavy use of T-72AV and BMP-2. Their tank crews are the best in Syria right now, and they are very good in Urban combat, thanks to experience over the years. They also fought in Adra and other Ghouta battles. Don't know if they were ever deployed outside of Dimashq though.  And you have several Infantry Batallions who mostly operate in Aleppo and Ghouta."

The Rangers, the SEALs, the SAS, and other groups do that and I believe it is a necessity to be called special forces. AFAIK the tiger forces do not do that.  The only operation in Syria like that as far as I remember was the demolition of the DeZ bridge, but I don't know who conducted it."

Mount Hermon testifies this, where airborne Special forces quickly captured an important point and also defended against an counter-attack successfully. They also had a good reputation during the Lebanon war where they were known for hunting down Israeli Tanks.  Like most units however, all the focus was on conventional warfare: I doubt even a little bit of asymmetrical warfare doctrine was studied by the High Command.    And not fulfilling that role? Most of the time, they don't, that is true. They are mostly used as a spearhead role, but is that necessarily in contradiction to an elite Light Infantry role? They perform excellent with the proper tools: Hama 2014 was a spectacular performance: Combining the 4th Armoured division with the Tiger forces showed what could be done."

syriancivilwar,3d4blr,redrojava,2,Tue Jul 14 01:16:38 2015 UTC,"no standing army can be great, it's the biggest waste of human resource imaginable. And besides without a cause and ideology an unmotivated army is just a mercenary force where the underprivileged section of society recruit themselves to make a living, fighting mostly unjustified wars that they cannot normally support and thus they twist their morality in attempt to justify to oneself. Many anti-colonial forces, anti occupation guerrilla armies, anti-nazi resistance were great, selfless, non-mercenary armies. No soldier ever felt they needed to defend their land, when they were napalming Vietnam or burning fallujah, or sodomizing kids in front of their moms in Abu Ghraib. US ground forces never stood a chance against ground resistance whether in Afghanistan or in Iraq. It was their technological superiority that kept them at advantage, eventually they realized that and now it's all drones."
syriancivilwar,3d4blr,Stefan_Zhirkov,-2,Mon Jul 13 18:22:14 2015 UTC,"Firstly since you took part in those criminal wars, your views are going to be biases anyway. Still, in Vietnam, ground forces of US have had their asses gifted to them in a platter because they were inferior and the forest cover did not make their air superiority as effective as it should have been. And then they moved to desert war and in spite of plummeting all enemy positions with everything shot of nuclear weapons, they kept coming back, and the war is still on. Anyway we will never be able to disentangle any battle victory of US ground forces from its technological advantages. This is a classic endogeneity problem where causality cannot be directly confirmed. So lets look at the next best thing, which will be the performance of those trained by the ""best army in the world"". We all know where they stand and how they run.  Child rape was happening it was fact, it was also discussed thoroughly in [reddit]http://redd.it/2qthfi) as well.

syriancivilwar,3d4tkt,liedel,9,Mon Jul 13 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"There are things iraq had to accomplish before they could fly the jets. They had to train like a hundred plus ground crew, update their military radars, plus train the pilots. The thing about the pilots is, since it's iraq, the first batch of pilots sent all had high connections in the government or their dads were military commanders, ect. Doesn't really make for the best pilots and there was a high fail out rate.   Also the first pilots trained aren't going to be combat pilots but instructors to make the process faster and better for the next batch because currently most of them have to go to a English school before entering flight school. One of their most experienced literally just crashed and died. So this whole notion that iraq could be flying combat missions and not crashing or killing friendlies on the ground is ridiculous. Russia hasn't delivered syria their new fighter trainers either so waiting a couple years before operating completely new equipment isn't that out of the ordinary"

syriancivilwar,3d4tkt,imeniaan80,4,Mon Jul 13 17:58:55 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand this contract, to be honest.  Iraq needs aircraft for counterinsurgency, not air superiority.  F16s are massively expensive, and Iraq is paying close to $150 million for each jet, once training, parts and logistics chains are factored in.  This, in addition to the extensive training for pilots and ground crews required to operate them, has severely limited the number of jets Iraq can operate, and has delayed their entrance to the battle against IS during a time they're sorely needed.  The US should instead be funding an equipment package tailored for Iraq's needs.  COIN-specific aircraft like Brazil's Super Tucano are well-tested, specifically designed for battling insurgents with limited anti-air capabilities, intended to operate in rough terrain with extreme weather conditions and are much cheaper.  There are plenty of other options, but the Super Tucano's unit cost is less than $15 million, roughly 10% of each F16.  To put it bluntly, the battle against IS would be better served by ten times the number of Super Tucano's than F16's, which could be acquired for roughly the same cost.  To word it differently, forty Super Tucanos could likely do more damage to IS than four F16s.  There are other benefits as well, which have great values for other conflicts.  Because COIN-specific aircraft aren't meant to grapple with high-level anti-air threats, opposing air forces or air superiority missions in general, they don't pose a risk to a country's neighbors.  Israel, for instance, would face very limited risks from a Lebanese air force operating Super Tucanos against militants in the border mountains.  Thus they can can be provided to armed forces facing insurgent threats with fewer limiting conditions than required by F16s, conditions which have delayed the delivery of these jets to Iraq.  To take it further, after IS is largely degraded and the US winds down Operation Inherent Resolve, such aircraft could be used to build an air force for Syrian rebels and/or the YPG, who will undoubtedly need air support as IS reverts to a more traditional insurgency.  Such aircraft would pose very limited threats to the relatively advanced air defense systems of the Syrian government and Turkey, but would be more than adequate to fill the role they're intended to.  This would allow effective counterinsurgency operations in rebel/YPG territory independent of the coalition within the context of a comprehensive peace agreement with Damascus."

The report said the latest advance has led to the closure of the “main entrance to the city,” isolating Zabadani from the neighboring mountain town of Madaya.  Monday’s gain comes after the allies issued an ultimatum to Syrian rebel factions to surrender or die, a source close to Hezbollah told The Daily Star over the weekend.  It was believed that the rebels had been trapped inside Zabadani since their escape routes were cut off on July 4, but Monday's report suggests they still had access to some villages south of the village.  Hezbollah and the Syrian army launched the offensive to retake the town earlier this month, hoping to bolster their control of land routes between Lebanon and Syria.  The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, revealed that Hezbollah’s overall death toll now stands at 12, while at least 16 Syrian army soldiers and 200 militants have been killed in the battle.  Hezbollah and Syrian troops also managed to capture around 43 rebels, the source added.  The capture of the largest Qalamoun city would add to Hezbollah’s recent victories in Lebanon’s eastern mountain range since launching a wider offensive to oust militants from the border region in early May.  Zabadani is located on the southern end of Qalamoun, about 50 kilometers northwest of Damascus and 12 kilometers northeast of Lebanon’s Masnaa border crossing."

syriancivilwar,3d5a9t,gonzolegend,4,Mon Jul 13 19:34:43 2015 UTC,"Al Akhbar's english site ending   That's the biggest blow by far. Daily Star is decent, at least for scoops, but al-Akhbar and as-Safir are the two best papers in Lebanon, and now neither of them has an English site (as-Safir never did) :(  EDIT: Well I guess Safir has some semblance of an English site now, but it's weak and only translates maybe one story every two days."

syriancivilwar,3d5a9t,Tartar666,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:10:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The Arabic edition is fantastic (best newspaper in Lebanon in my opinion), and it's a pity that they couldn't sustain the costs of producing the English edition, because I think that their market share would have grown a lot in Europe and North America, especially with the Syrian civil war going on. There's a sizable demographic in the West that wants Syria & Iraq coverage with a different slant from what we typically get from the major news outlets, and the latter category unfortunately includes al-Jazeera due to the politics between Qatar and Syria and Iran. Al-Akhbar English filled a hole which is sadly now present again."

syriancivilwar,3d9aos,EngineProblems,3,Tue Jul 14 20:11:37 2015 UTC,"The American invasion probably didn't hurt the development of Islamic State. It is widely agreed that many Baathists from Saddam's regime are working with Islamic State. Had Saddam not been removed, and the Iraqi dictatorship remained intact, it is probable that this situation would not be occurring."
syriancivilwar,3d9aos,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:02:57 2015 UTC,"In one party systems, typically much of the population is affiliated with the party either officially or even indirectly, but they still are part of that party. China is an excellent example. Likewise, in a country like Iraq where the ruling party had an official membership of 1.5 million, where being a member of the party was useful socioeconomically and many members couldn't care less for the politics, and millions more were indirectly part of the party as a result of working public jobs and the military, much of the population were Baathists going by that definition (you could say likewise regarding the CCP in China).   Even the interim PM Ayad Allawi was a former Baathist. What I'm saying is saying there's former Baathists with ISIS is like saying there's Republicans and Democrats in the US. There's also former Baathists throughout the government and military, probably far more than with ISIS or JRTN."
syriancivilwar,3d9aos,sunbolts,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"It's not that they are baathists, it's that they were experienced officers in the intelligence agencies and military. They likely wouldn't have defected to ISIS with the Saddam regime still standing"
syriancivilwar,3d9aos,fauz87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most likely. Though most those guys were killed or imprisoned years ago, and the ones still around are mostly laying low. izzat al Douri and a few other of those remaining senior guys isn't all too much. Others are probably around and they joined neither ISIS nor JRTN.   The Iraqi defense minister who pretty much runs the military was a senior air force officer (I wasn't able to ever find out the exact rank, I'd assume something high though for him to be made Defense Minister) in the Baath military himself. The Iraqi security forces and govt are far more ""Baath"" than ISIS and possibly JRTN. I agree with your point, but my last comment was mainly geared against the claims that ISIS is Baath 2.0. It certainly isn't. Any third world country with a ruling party and a solid system of institutions is similar in this regard.   Though anyways, the unsteady coalition between ISIS and JRTN died a long time ago. There's some of what you mentioned actually with ISIS itself, but this is exaggerated almost to the degree of conspiracy (much like the popular conspiracy theory that used to exist in Iraq that ISIS was made by the US, Israel, and Gulf states). Reason being ISIS was significantly better led and effective than the current Iraqi govt and military. Considering the Baath also knew how to run a govt and military with some notable competency, you can see why such a conspiracy could come out of this.  Nowadays though, people are seeing just like the US/Israel/Gulf conspiracy theory, this doesn't have much of a base to it. Also, the PM publicly stated at the G7 that ISIS in Iraq is mostly foreign anyways (58% is what he gave IIRC)."
syriancivilwar,3d9aos,sunbolts,-2,Tue Jul 14 22:47:23 2015 UTC,"There are many factors that contributed to the development of the Islamic State, but to me the biggest factor is Islam itself. Islam has had a ""Caliphate""...or rather.... war-making, aggressive, empire with hegemonic aspirations for over 80% of the time Islam has been in existence....this should be no surprise to anyone.  1st 3 caliphates + Ottoman empire = vast majority of Islam. Lets stop blaming others and just look at history yes?"

I don't disagree with you there. But give me one pre-WW2 great power that wasn't like that.   Regarding your points vs stance. You are anti-Muslim guy. I've met you and had friends who are like you. Basically, you guys have arguments against Islam for doing X. Muslims did X because Y. X being whatever is in the news. Y being something that happened 400 years ago or in some remote village in Pakistan.  After a while you start ignoring people like that. What is the point in talking you? I can respond to your argument and you will just throw another random bit of trivia and act like you've figured it out and that the rest of us are just uneducated sheeple."
syriancivilwar,3d9aos,EngineProblems,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:21:33 2015 UTC,"I can understand why you feel the way you do, and its actually quite frustrating that I grew up in this era.   What do I mean by this ""era""? An era where one must be politically correct, where any stance pointing too much blame in any direction is seen as immediately wrong, and I am immediately placed in a bucket that is filled with ""buck-toothed racist rednecks"".  I want you to understand I have a far different perspective, my opinions have come from EXTENSIVE research. I have no intention of researching something I know nothing about to fill an agenda, it is to learn...and the more I learn about this religion the more it stands out as far worse and dangerous than the others.   I have observed countless debates between the best of minds for and against Islam, as well as just random people on forums, checking facts along the way. I am satisfied in the development of my stance on Islam, that it has been responsible, and not biased....otherwise in my opinion there is no point in researching something if my mind is already made up, that it makes truth irrelevant.  To say i throw random bits of trivia at you is an insult, I try to make solid points with good foundation.  ""But give me one pre-WW2 great power that wasn't like that.""   Those empires come and go, they were always founded upon nationalism, which is the very reason they do not last. In addition, these empires when conquering people (besides nazis or mongolians of course) allowed them to join in, they did not crush their culture, ideas, and way of life and force them to live the exact way that Islam demands.    Islam is awful as an empire because it forces others to live the way it sees fit, and the way it wants is drastically different from other cultures, and allows no diversity....Islam is dangerous not only because it devours cultures but because it is persisting."
syriancivilwar,3d9aos,nantenknight,2,Tue Jul 14 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"The only empire, that I know of, that allowed people to keep their culture was the Roman. And that was a shitty empire not to be Roman in.   My main issues are that people who are anti-Islam are all over the place when they argue and talk about Islam like they convene each Friday to discuss next week game plan.  If something is being discussed about Egypt. They will bring in how that one Muslim did that shitty thing in Oman 200 years ago. And they will say that this is what Muslims are about since another Muslim did the same thing in Tunis 50 years ago. And now these pesky Muslims are bringing their shitty behavior to our civilized countries that have never and will never do something as shitty.  From what I understand, Muslims themselves don't agree on what Islam is. So I don't see how someone who is not a Muslim can say ""This is Islam. Islam is bad, m'kay?""."
syriancivilwar,3d9aos,EngineProblems,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"There were many other empires that allowed others to retain there culture, or at least some semblance of it, compared to the utter destruction Islam enforced.  Empire of Alexander the great Sassanid Empire British Empire Napolean's empire  ""From what I understand, Muslims themselves don't agree on what Islam is.""   This is exactly the problem with Islam, among many others. These people follow that god awful book and (some) follow the Hadith as well...when you have so many interpretations and yet everyone in the religion following them to a T....you have inevitable war...non stop war.  If even they cannot define it, why aren't outsiders welcome to as well? Outsiders may be better at it since they aren't biased to specific interpretations, it gives people like me a more high level, birds eye view on Islam's Issues... and those issues are many."

Would you rather have one strict interpretation that everybody followed. You are contradicting yourself here. You complain because it forces all cultures to be converted to that of Islam. But then you complain because not all Muslims follow the same interpretation (i.e. they have different cultures).   If even they cannot define it, why aren't outsiders welcome to as well? Outsiders may be better at it since they aren't biased to specific interpretations, it gives people like me a more high level, birds eye view on Islam's Issues... and those issues are many.    In my view outsiders should be welcome try to understand it and form their own opinion. That's what I do. But do you realize how ridiculous it would be for a Muslim to tell Christians ""I understand your religion better than you do because I'm an outsider without bias. After much research and study, I have come to the conclusion that your religion has been a negative influence on the world. You should realize this and start believing what I believe.""?  By the way, look at this list and this. That's a pretty small keyhole you're looking through if you see Muslims as the big trouble makers."
syriancivilwar,3d9aos,EngineProblems,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"I cannot deny this. Though I would say that the existence of a Caliphate has been far longer than just 80% of Islam's existence, and rather closer to 95%. Caliphates of various names existed within a generation of Muhammad and the last collapsed with the abdication of the Ottoman Caliph in 1923. Then Islam went through a period of secularization, particularly in Turkey under Ataturk. Ataturk believed that Westernization was the only way that Turkey (and Islam) could compete with Europe. This trend was reversed in 1979 when the Ayatollah's took over Iran (ironic, isn't it?) and proved that fundamental Islam was politically viable. Now the Caliphate's back, and the fact that it hasn't yet collapsed against the ""Western Crusaders"" and the ""Shia heretics"" proves to them and others that their cause is just. The longer that the Caliphate remains,  the stronger and more legitimate it becomes."

They face only one fate. That is death and massacres if they are lucky and a life time of sexual servitude for their women if they are unlucky.

Having to wait unti the enemy is on your doorstep is one of the pitfalls of warfare in urban environments.   There is a clear difference between the people of Zabadani and those in  Nubl and Zahra. The civilians in Zabadani are not facing any butchering from Hezbollah or SAA. They've been allowed to leave before to have their kids take exams, get food and rations. The government was even allowing to negiogate with the rebels to disarm and have them run the town. Al-Nusra and JAI and other Islamists don't even think the people of Nubl and Zahra should be allowed to live. Their hatred is such that they couldn't even allow food aid into the city when it mean that 2000 Al-Nusra terrorists get to leave Homs. They literally had to be threatened with the death of their terrorist buddies into allowing trucks full of aid to enter the towns.   Such is the narrative that has been spread since 2011 to build support for government forces. Despite the fact that it hasn't happened even when Shi'a majority towns are captured.   Tell that to the people of Hatla or the people of durin, Qusayr, Aqrab, Adra or Aramo. The only saving grace has been the fact that the SAA, Hezbollah and other Shia groups have evacuated or held lines. Tell it to the people of Sayyida Zaynab who faced constant attacks for 18 months despite not having   No one denies that terrible discrimination against the Shi'a population, to include sectarian killings occurs and such actions should be loudly and internationally condemned, just as the institutionalized torture and murder of opponents of the regime should be loudly and internationally condemned.   Terrible discrimination? Jesus Christ are you taking the piss? There is a very clear difference. Would you compare what happened to the Yazidis to what happens to Sunni prisoners in Baghdads jails? I don't think so.   It burnt an impression on my soul about the horror of killing people for religious beliefs and haunts me still until this day. I most certainly don't view Shi'a as anything less than any other human being nor do I have any special animosity towards them.    Looking at your posts, your indifference and your denial of what these jihadist groups want, one could hardly tell the difference. What these takfiris do and say is not common amongst Sunnis. You know arabic, you have seen their videos, their actions and proclamations. You can't say with a straight face that all they do is discriminate. I understand the jihadi fanboys and the sectarian guys on the net but at least they are honest.   But my job and my life, since I was 18, has involved the science and application of weapons and warfare and I'll make no apology for appreciating excellence in these fields.   Even when that excellence involves some guy trying to save his homeland? Would you cheer and celebrate an excellent shot if the person on the other end was an American marine? Do you look up at IED videos of Americans getting blown up and celebrate the ingenuity of using simple tools to blow up highly armoured vehicles? Personally I doubt it. Your just a step above the type of people who hang around in combatfootage and Liveleak.   Don't cast your assumptions about me on me as though they're fact. You clearly know nothing about me.   Bruv I've seen your posts. I don't make assumptions based on one or two things. I make it based on a pattern of behaviour. Reading your posts is like reading someone talk about what is happening in the region as if lives of people don't matter. Alawite village gets attacked? Nothing. Kurds get their fingers scratched?

syriancivilwar,3d54fx,moneymakingmitch23,-1,Tue Jul 14 03:34:18 2015 UTC,I have never ever heard that from any Syrian other than those who support rebels. The very same people who claim that Assad is trying to turn Homs into an Alawite/Iranian land and is secretly trying to cleanse Syria of Sunnis.  The hypocrites are you dirty people. You who claim to represent Sunnis and talk as if we are all one monolithic block who share the same backward views. How many Sunnis are fighting for the Army? How many Sunnis are running from the rebels into government territory? How many Sunnis are in Latakia and Tartous? How many Sunnis have been martyred defending their hometown and cities from these rebels? Countless and many more then these terrorists.  My friend lost her brother defending the checkpoints in Khan al-Assal so that Aleppo didn't starve. A guy who died next to his Armenian buddy. That is a real Sunni. The biggest tragedy to have befallen our entire sect is that people like you claim to be Sunni.  You people are the biggest hypocrite ever.

I personally wish they stopped calling themselves that. We have enough on our plate without mass murdering idiocy being put on it. Nothing they do is to benefit Sunnis or in accordance with normal Sunni schools. What they engage in is naked political murders. They desire is to cause such a devastation amongst Alawites and Shias that those people will start retaliating against Sunnis as we saw in Houla and Bayda. That way Sunnis will be forced to turn to them.  It's disgusting and it's the height of cynicism for them to abuse Sunni Islam for worldly gains. The only issue is that not only are they killing non-Sunnis but they also put innocent Sunnis at risk. Just look at the Arab villages around Yazidi areas or Amreli. Hell the Imam Askari bombings that caused the sectarian mass murders in Iraq. There are millions of Sunnis living amongsts Christians, Druze, Alawites and Shias who are vunerable. If these groups ever spark a sectarian war they will be toast. Just like the village of Bayda that allowed rebels to attack Alawites despite being surrounded by Alawites.  Thankfully the Syrian government, Iran and Hezbollah have shown themselves to be clever enough to avoid the trap. Four years of deaths and still many Sunnis are living in Latakia in safety."

Zabadani is a Sunni town, and a major vacation area and therefore many left as Situation in Zabadani started to deteriorate in 2013 i believe. In 2014 Qalamoun offense many more fled the town. Today i would say their are about 100-200 people left. When the offense started many channels also brought up the fact that the town has been desertrd by its population."
syriancivilwar,3d54fx,VIVASECULARSYRIA,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:14:07 2015 UTC,"100-200 is stretching it but from personal experience, I'd say maybe 10-20% max remains there and from that number you have elderly people which no longer care about life or people with nowhere to go yet in Zabani the cost of life was higher than most of Syria so I'd hesitate that many people remained there because they were broke.  A lot of those which stayed are probably people which have profited somehow someway financially from the situation or family members of the rebels stationed there.  All in all, If I was to bet on it I'd say 1500-3000 civilians remain with many having left in the past month where stipulation that an attack is imminent was too much to ignore.  No town will ever be completely deserted based on stipulation mostly and this isn't different, people will always want to believe that there's a way out and that it won't happen and when it happens it's usually too late.  Then again this is war just as civilians died when the town was captured, civilians will die again when it is recaptured, there's no avoiding this mess.  Edit: Then again I could be way wrong, my father just told me that our village in Lebanon which was captured by Palestinians in 82 had zero civilians left from about 3000 civilians 48 hours or so before they knew that an attack was imminent, No one stayed, we only got our property back there more than 20 years later. They had stayed and fought twice but the third time EVERYONE bailed and for good reason."

But nothing major, like an entire army, as is the case in Syria. But overall, this war has made Hezbollah a more global Shia faction, vs before the civil war, when they were looked at as heroes of the Arab world for fighting israel or what not. Now Hezbollah has shown itself as a faction ready to fight in any shia cause, wherever it may be. As opposed to just staying in lebanon and waiting, it now has a doctrine of taking the fight to it's enemies before they could cause harm to Lebanon. I am no expert on  Hezbollah or Shia Islamic causes, but from reading alot on this Reddit, this is the trend I have observed about Hezbollah now. Any expert's though on this subject, please correct me."

Observers in Syria have doubts about the death of former kickboxing world champion.  The former kickboxing world champion Valdet Gashi, 27, may not dead. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in Damascus reported, a native of Singen, fighters of the terrorist militia ""Islamic State"" (IS) has been adopted in late June of IS-people when he wanted to settle in Turkey.  Gashi had wanted to return to Germany. It states that before conflicting information about whether Gashi was killed or is still alive. The observatory is operated by Syrian opposition and is considered one of the most reliable sources of what is happening in Syria.  The Gashis family took the message from Syria on with disbelief. His brother Loni Gashi maintained that Valdet him had informed on 26 June on the phone that he would go to Kobane to help at a ""evacuation of endangered civilians"". A few days later, someone had reported on Valdets phone and informed him that his brother had been killed on 27 June in Kobane in a US airstrike. The stranger had also received a farewell letter.  In discussions with his brother a run from the IS has never been an issue, Loni Gashi said. Rather Valdet Gashi said that he could go at any time, if he wanted it. The observatory should submit evidence to support its assertion that his brother had been taken at a run. Such speculation it made the family more difficult to process what happened."

The frontlines have been mostly static for weeks - Qara Qawzaq - Sanaa - Ras al-Ayn - Mughrbatin. YPG, nor any credible source claimed full and tight encirclement, and it's enough to just read the news and announcements to roughly know were the fighting is.   If you post wrong maps and at some point need to take it back to reality, just admit you were wrong, instead of making up retreats that mislead your public and make YPG/FSA look bad. I see the same stuff happening all over, and still getting upvoted without any critical thought - most notably with Ayn Issa, when some announced it liberated week before it was, and then were making up withdrawals due to lack of airstrikes."
syriancivilwar,3d3rey,sylezjusz,5,Mon Jul 13 08:20:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, but how do you know it's untrue? You may be right, but why? Because YPG does not report it? It's entirely possible that the YPG experiences a setback, and also likely that they would not report it. Where does your confidence come from? Are you there?"
syriancivilwar,3d3rey,sylezjusz,9,Mon Jul 13 08:26:32 2015 UTC,"YPG never claimed they took all those villages around Sarrin and were tightly besieging it from all sides. And they always report their gains. There was no other credible source for it, and tweets alone don't count as credible source. So unless you prove otherwise, don't say they lied and blame them for not reporting a setback that never was, from the gains they never claimed. Their statements about fighting in that area were clear: Qara Qawzaq, Kaikdada, Sanaa in the north, Ras al-Ayn on the closest in the east and Mughrbatin in south-east. So nothing close to full and tight encirclement. This is corroborated by photos and videos from the area. If this is not how you check your facts you'd probably also believe a mapper first showing YPG 5km from Raqqa and then inventing some retreat, because suddenly he realised he's wrong but still wants to portray himself as someone credible. That none of these two happened wouldn't be a case for you.   I'm not going to claim I have sources there because I want to show you that it's enough to use available material to roughly know where the frontlines are and apply some critical thought to what you see on Twitter. As for claims of silos or tiny village with 1000 Daesh inside surrounded  for months - I'd say you don't need any source for that, just use reason."

syriancivilwar,3d2qf9,jordanianman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:01:36 2015 UTC,"No, they really haven't. The bombardments have been minimal. Fallujah needs MLRS & aerial bombings to begin cracking that nut.  They've had an open corridor for many, many months to empty it of civilians. When ISF began mobilizing to attack Fallujah, they gave the civilians another notice. After months of evacuating civilians, this last warning netted significantly less civilians. A trickle compared to last time.  This means that Fallujah is hunkering down for a fight & those who stayed back should be considered combatants.  Raze the goddamn city before you march in. These are the lives of our young men that our pathetic generals are risking just to appease the Sunnis-- as if that's worked in the past-- and to get a pat on the head from the West due to avoiding ""collateral damage,"" despite there being none."
syriancivilwar,3d2qf9,TITTIES_AND_ASS,4,Mon Jul 13 04:20:46 2015 UTC,"Have a talk with the people that assaulted Stalingrad and Monte Cassino, and ask them why carpetbombing entrenched cities and places with solid buildings before you attack is the worst possible plan you can come up with.   MLRS fyi, is not very effective in cityblocks. It lacks the punch to flatten buildings in a good way. You need to go heavier. And even when you do, you just created a battlefield that is perfect for defence; chaotic, hard to get an overview in, filled with instant material for improvised fortifications, shooting positions and cover, impossible to operate armored vehicles in, easier to hide troops and defensive positions in....its a recipe for getting your ass handed to you by people with less fighters and material than you have. Keeping the building mass intact makes a city that much easier to control and take control over. And the bombing itself would yield limited casualties, as MLRS doesnt fly straight up, then come down vertically into narrow streets to hit ground level. Youd pretty much be putting better airconditioning in the top few floors for snipers to use later and thats it."
syriancivilwar,3d2qf9,Luvsmah,12,Mon Jul 13 04:31:30 2015 UTC,"This means that Fallujah is hunkering down for a fight & those who stayed back should be considered combatants.   This is so stupid. No, a combatant is someone who fights against the Iraqi state. It's not someone who supports ISIS. If the Iraqi army went and attacked anyone who was sympathetic or supported ISIS, they would have had to kill the vast majority of sunnis. There's less Sunnis supporting them now because of how the Iraqi army has been conducting itself (very positive overall) and because of how stupidly ISIS conducts itself. For you to say that the Iraqi army should just kill anyone who is symphatic to ISiS (even if he's not a fighter) is very stupid and will only negatively impact Iraq. Such a stupid and ignorant statement. But, tbh, all your comments are derogatory and inflammatory towards sunnis, such as saying   ""pathetic generals are risking just to appease the Sunnis-- as if that's worked in the past-- and to get a pat on the head from the West due to avoiding ""collateral damage,"" despite there being none"" this. The only difference between an ISIS supporter and you is that one happens to be Shia, and one happens to Sunni."

There's one problem right there. The vast majority aspect.   For you to say that the Iraqi army should just kill anyone who is symphatic to ISiS (even if he's not a fighter) is very stupid   Never said have the IA march in & pull a Ghengis Khang on the inhabitants of Fallujah.  You need to realize something. Baghdad even provided busses for those unfortunate enough to not be able to afford relocation.  Baghdad resettled them in Najaf, Karbala, Baghdad, Basra, & other cities.  ISIS fully allowed the civilians that want to leave leave. They knew if those that stay back don't have their hearts in it, they might act as intelligence for the ISF and or be featured in the liberation videos as jubilant civilians.  It may wound your delicate, idealist view of the situation in Fallujah, but Baghdad minimized the factors that may contribute to civilians staying in what they correctly foresaw as a warzone almost to zero.  When civilians in Anbar celebrated the soldiers during the day & shot at them at night, what's your excuse for them there?    such as saying ""pathetic generals are risking just to appease the Sunnis-- as if that's worked in the past-- and to get a pat on the head from the West due to avoiding ""collateral damage,"" despite there being none"" this.   But am I wrong? Even the Pentagon had to bribe the Sunnis Awakening Council to cooperate with them & Baghdad to curb the terrorists. Once Maliki cut the money, surprise, surprise, he also inadvertantly rekindled the Sunni - terrorist alliance.   The only difference between an ISIS supporter and you is that one happens to be Shia, and one happens to Sunni.    Oh this line again.  Why is it when we speak frankly about this issue plaguing the Sunni community, largely because of their tribal leaders, we hear this line?  Sorry, bud, but after 12 years of suicide bombings in our market squares & our holy sites, it's time we call a spade a spade."
syriancivilwar,3d2qf9,sunbolts,3,Mon Jul 13 11:44:37 2015 UTC,"Razing the cities ISIS controls have always been in the ISF's power, the reason that they don't do it is to avoid as much infrastructure damage and to sully their reputation should these strikes hit civilian targets.   Anbar is a mainly Sunni populated province. If the Government portrays itself in a manner that appears that it doesn't care about the population, it wouldn't help them garner more support from Sunni tribes.  If the government starts bombing the city heavier, ISIS could use this to garner more support from the Sunni population.   As for ISIS allowing the civilians to leave, that may be so yet many people in the city were either too afraid of leaving their homes or were sympathetic to ISIS from the start. There still could be civilians in the city."

I hope the US does't allow Iranina terrorist proxies to be apart of the battle, this needs to be a Iraqi shia and Sunni tribe operation. The abuses the Iranian proxies have been accused and committed in Tikrit and anbar will do nothing but create a more intense insurgency.

Those three are on roughly equal footing and we'd prefer that they be at roughly the same standard of quality. Much like we seek to weed out partisan analysis or unsourced news, we also like to keep the commentary out of ""low hanging fruit"" territory.  We have less control over the external sources of information posted here but we can police the comments so low effort stuff like ""RIP"" or ""lol"" or ""this"" is going to get nuked. While we fully realise that one of those three examples is different from the others, their end result is the same; a feed full of carbon copy comments that add nothing substantial to the conversation.  In each of these types of threads there's at least one comment that both mourns the dead and adds value.

If you're moved enough by someone's death to post a comment expressing hope they'll rest in peace, then there's surely more you can say about the person, their qualities, their struggle, and their death than just ""Rest in Peace"", and, clearly, a comment saying ""Rest in Peace"" along with something else about the deceased is totally acceptable."

The operation against the Sunni extremist group includes the army, federal police, mostly Shiite militias and Sunni tribal fighters from Anbar.  The coalition staged early-morning raids Monday against unspecified Islamic State targets.  “We will punish the criminals of ISIS in the battlefields,” Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said, using an acronym for the group, in a statement carried by the television station. “The heroes of our security forces, the public mobilization units and the tribal sons are causing ISIS terrorists defeats after defeats.”  The long-awaited operation to push the group out of Anbar comes nearly two months after the militant group stormed the provincial capital, Ramadi, in a major defeat to Iraq’s military."

syriancivilwar,3d260i,GrandMuftiOfReddit,17,Sun Jul 12 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"JaI has been urging Nusra to join the Unified Command in Ghouta for a while now. They are the only faction there that are not part of it, and they tried to create ""Jaish al-Fatah in Ghouta"" as well but it was swiftly rejected by all factions there since they already have a united structure."
syriancivilwar,3d260i,777yourface,7,Sun Jul 12 23:39:26 2015 UTC,Is Ahar part of the Unified command council?
syriancivilwar,3d260i,oreng,10,Sun Jul 12 23:49:56 2015 UTC,Yes. They and JaI lead it.
syriancivilwar,3d260i,GrandMuftiOfReddit,14,Sun Jul 12 23:57:33 2015 UTC,Actually Ahrar is very minor in East Ghouta. The largest factions are JaI and Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union. It was Ajnad al-Sham's leader who acted as the interim head of the Unified Command while Alloush was gone abroad.  Even FSA groupings like Al-Rahman Legion are stronger and more influential than Ahrar in Ghouta.
syriancivilwar,3d260i,oreng,8,Mon Jul 13 00:34:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean Ahrar is significant in E. Ghouta, just that they're all-but-merged with JaI in enough places that a unified command would necessarily include them at the highest levels. I could have phrased it much better."
syriancivilwar,3d260i,DoctorExplosion,8,Mon Jul 13 00:38:19 2015 UTC,"Of course, they're both Islamic Front. That doesn't mean much anymore given JaI and Ahrar absorbed all the other IF members and largely do their own thing, but there are structures in place to coordinate between the two."

syriancivilwar,3d260i,DoctorExplosion,3,Mon Jul 13 00:28:14 2015 UTC,"Either that or Nusra is hell bent on duplicating Jaysh al Fateh everywhere, even in the places where they have relatively few fighters and influence."
syriancivilwar,3d260i,777yourface,3,Mon Jul 13 01:12:05 2015 UTC,But whats the point of having jaish al Fatah when you already have a unified command group?
syriancivilwar,3d260i,DoctorExplosion,4,Mon Jul 13 01:36:01 2015 UTC,Because Jaysh al Fatah is Nusra's baby and a tool of their influence in Syria
syriancivilwar,3d260i,sirencow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:57:39 2015 UTC,True .Its their conduit to receive weapons and support from Turkey and the Gulf countries
syriancivilwar,3d260i,smileyman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:34:12 2015 UTC,Because JaN would be in charge of (or at least have significant influence) over any decisions made in Jaish al Fateh. That's the primary reason. The secondary reason is that by organizing Jaish al-Fateh commands across Syria they can use it as part of their propaganda and claim that they're unifying the rebel groups and that it took JaN leadership to do so.

Very weak, and has been for years. The Americans decimated their leadership and the split with ISIS has further hurt them. I'd rather have no AQ as mentioned, but failing that a weakened AQ that is over-extended and committed into two wars I don't see it winning (alone at least) for some time is the next best alternative."

Factions loyal to or allied with al-Qaeda include the Afghan Taliban, the Pakistani Taliban and AQ in the Indian Subcontinent, al-Shabaab in Somalia, AQ in the Islamic Maghreb, JaN in Syria, AQ in the Arabian Peninsula, Ansar al-Sharia and the Mujahideen Shura Council in Libya, MUJAO in Mali, and probably a couple smaller groups that I'm forgetting.  The split with Daesh has hurt their movement more than US drone strikes ever did, but they are still far more powerful and widespread than they were in 2001."

syriancivilwar,3d1n8b,Sierrahun,11,Sun Jul 12 20:45:58 2015 UTC,"Well the regime recently made a video about this unit, which is already posted in this thread.  Secondly there's probably some religious aspect judging by LAKY's quick overview of the video.  Thirdly it's mostly to expose the regime, which is supposed to be secular and care about womens rights- it's own soldiers are selling them out for profit to the rebels.  It's the perfect propaganda coup de gra.  ""Look- here is the regimes venerated female snipers. And here are the patriotic and noble NDF who defend thier communities from the mad jihaddis. And here is the former all blown to shit because of the later. the regime ladies and gentlemen!""  That is baisically the message here."

As of now they, and the rebels that took over the province seem to be trying really hard to ignore each other, so there might be a potential counterexample.  Also I doubt the blame for turning this into an (kinda) existential war for Alawites and other loyal demographics, can be said to rest entirely with the rebels. A obvious consequence of the strategic bombing campaign is that those living in areas affected by the bombing will start to feel great anger, directed at those that have reputation for loyalty to the government. And considering there is an armed rebellion ongoing, those people will have an obvious outlet for their anger."

The rebels were overly eager to attack Nubl and Zahra last year with their grand Assault, so I don't think they lack the will or the spirit.  Assad and the Gov might have pushed the narrative of ""Minority protection"" very hard yes, but that is painfully true. The Rebels have lost all credibility and never cared. After these incidents:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09u61hGEGgM  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=141_1412187003  I completely understand that Alawites see no other option.

And I don't support the crackdown of Hama, that was absolutely unnecessary. I do however support the crackdown of Homs.  At least there is some sort of proper government going on. Can't say that from the rebel areas. Rebels are even more corrupt, with those thug brigades that sell out to everyone and keep monopolies, such as JaI, SRF, Northern Storm, Farouq. Alloush acting like a warlord, only giving his soldiers food and letting the civilians starve while stopping them from going to Gov held areas, and than use them for propaganda. SRF for letting people dissappear, Northern Storm for being the quintessential thug and Farouq for random liquidations and kidnapping. Great alternative."

In Syria, a significant number people in ISIS controlled areas still see the rebels as an alternative. Despite what you may believe, ISIS has been very successful in Syria. ISIS controls 80-90% of the oil in all of Syria and much of its natural resources such as phosphorus. ISIS has captured large a large city in Syria besides Palmyra.

Most educated Kazakh youth, except for a few who were pissed about the consequences of the Semipalatinsk nuclear site, had positive opinions of it.  Plus, during the 1991 referendums, ALL Central Asians republics voted >94% for preservation of the union, Uzbek 94% to Kazakh 95% to Turkmen 98%, which was greater than the autorepublics within the Russian SFSR.  I dont get why people tend to skip these actual results when they talk shit about the USSR.

syriancivilwar,3d1mld,Shajmaster12,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:34:40 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, you know, the 1991 referendums were organized by Gorbachyov, hero of the west, who pushed for autonomy and decentralization, actually causing nationalist movements within dissident republics such as Georgia, Armenia and the Baltic states to flourish.  The Baltic republics held a different referendum on March 3 with 65%+ turnout and 95%+ voters favouring independence. Later on, pro-Soviet front orgs organized voluntary referendums, which had <50% mandatory turnout, and hence failed. Due to this defeat, Central Commission of Referendum of USSR didn't include Baltics in the official statement. See here, above the table. I'm sure if they wanted it rigged to preserve the USSR, they would've done so.  Plus, the legitimacy of the referendum has never been questioned, not by historians, not by HRW/Amnesty types, not by Memorial, even with access to large treasure troves of soviet documents. Furthermore details like the fact that results of the Ukrainian referendum being distorted as pro-independence groups in western Ukraine boycotted it, reducing the % of independence (NO) votes, are known. See here, underneath the table. So there is no reason to think 1991 was rigged.  Now, presidential elections in dictatorships like Syria are a different matter. USSR wasn't a dictatorship run by 1 or 2 people. It was an authoritarian single party state, with the party pulling the strings. There were elections and enormous bureaucracy. Except for Stalin the maniac and Beria the deviant, the USSR wasn't all that bad. Under Andropov, the ""evil"" KGB's activities were severely regulated, and post-Stalin, the USSR was the lesser evil compared to USA. Maybe read more about it?"

syriancivilwar,3d163e,the_red_wheelbarrow,17,Sun Jul 12 18:18:31 2015 UTC,"True for the people of Turkey. Not at all true for the government. Erdogan and Davutoglu are determined to make Syria's tragedy into what they perceive to be Turkey's benefit, however long it takes. I don't think that entails directly aiding IS, but they're certainly not out and out enemies with IS either."
syriancivilwar,3d163e,JaseFace,10,Sun Jul 12 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"People don't realise that having Da3sh on their borders is enormously destabilising for Turkey,   No, it really isn't. Not yet. Islamic State trades on religious fanaticism and political pragmatism equally well; though they could blast Turkey for 'selling out Muslims to western infidels via NATO' or for their 'false democracy' or any number of things, Turkey would immediately retaliate and IS can't afford to lose Turkish complicity. Thus, there are no IS attacks in Turkey, no IS assaults on Turkish border guards, no IS actions against the Turkish Army whatsoever. Why would they end the wealth of logistical and material support coming from MIT operatives?  If you disagree with this, despite the fact that Turkish ongoing support for Islamic State is a consensus such that Joe Biden himself repeated it, explain to me why Islamic State has been connected to attacks as distant as Sydney but there's been nothing in Turkey?   and the majority of Turks have absolutely no interest in this war beyond ending it and getting the refugees home.   Erdogan does not fully answer to them. The election was a setback, but any independent judiciary would have long since issued an arrest warrant for his actions."
syriancivilwar,3d163e,Leadback,7,Sun Jul 12 18:49:29 2015 UTC,"That goes both ways, of course. If Turkey did crackdown, IS is perfectly capable of launching a very large campaign of terrorist attacks within Turkey. They've established networks of sympathetics, safe houses and other infrastructure over the past several years that could very easily be turned against Turkey.   There are some similarities here to Syria. Assad's intelligence services abetted the flow of foreign jihadists to Iraq through Syria, and IS reactivated those networks to form Jabhat al Nusra. If that can happen in a police state like Syria, it can happen in a democracy like Turkey. Of course, Erdogan's tolerance of their activities allowed them to create those networks, so this dynamic has a lot of ""lie in the bed you make"" to it."

syriancivilwar,3d163e,deepthink42,4,Sun Jul 12 20:49:46 2015 UTC,"Why? Fear and ignorance.  Imagine, for example, the Mexican cartels calling for independence from Mexico and claiming ownership over the entirety of the Mexican-American border and a sizeable chunk of land on both sides.  Now imagine they get the Mexican half, and prominent political figures are saying to expand into the US to protect the interests of Mexican people from American tyranny (racist hatred and violence towards illegal immigrants).  Furthermore the cartels are involved in organized crime and actively attack American police officers and military, including treating public workers like trash and threatening to bomb their places of work.  Weapons, personnel, and money flow through this porous border, and American culture is being replaced with Mexican culture. Some would say that America is being stolen away by selfish and greedy individuals.  Mexican cartel members are even being voted into Congress, as a result of democratic elections.  That's how Kurdish people are viewed by some and portrayed by the parts of the media -- an insurgency that's taking advantage of Turkish generosity and destroying Turkish society and culture.  It's why the media is so tightly controlled -- the AKP wants to manipulate society to fit their political agenda."
syriancivilwar,3d163e,ihsw,2,Sun Jul 12 22:03:40 2015 UTC,":/, I guess, but that metaphor seems unfair.  Kurds are an ethnic group. Not all Kurds are criminals, in fact most aren't. But all mexican cartel members are by definition criminal.  I think you hit the nail on the head when you said, fear of expansion into Turkey.  But ISIS has publicly stated it wants to infiltrate and absorb all Turkey.  Rojava still seems like a preferable neighbour."
syriancivilwar,3d163e,deepthink42,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more.  Erdogan and his cadre have made the same mistake many have made in the past -- partnering with jihadists. Leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan know that pain very well, and they've quietly warned against it.  The AKP and MIT think they can control Isil, that's why they're not nervous. I don't want to sound macabre or sadistic but I think it's an inevitability that Isil attacks Turkey, and the country will have to turn to the military for support. They (the military) have been quite clear in their discomfort for the current political climate and the political establishment's strange fascination with inflaming sectarian issues, even though the stated goal is Assad's ousting.  Partnering with jihadist elements is playing with fire -- if you try to distance yourself from them, they kill you and rob your land of its people and wealth.

PKK is against the Ilısu dam, because it would destroy ""historical Kurdish homeland"" with floods. Direct quote from wikipedia article:   According to KHRP(Kurdish Human Rights Project), completion of the Ilısu Dam will cause the flooding of the ancient city of Hasankeyf, whose history stretches back over 10,000 years. About 185 settlements (villages and hamlets) will be fully or partially affected by flooding. The involuntary resettlement process will involve 55,000–65,000 people (40,000 Turkish Gov't estimates). Census data is not available yet.  Alternatively, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, at the ground-breaking ceremony, stated : ""The step that we are taking today demonstrates that the south-east is no longer neglected. This dam will bring big gains to the local people."" Ankara hopes that the dam - part of a long-term plan to develop the poor, mainly Kurdish region - will create up to 10,000 jobs, irrigate farmlands and attract tourists. The government has promised to compensate local people who will lose their homes and that all the valuable artifacts will be relocated before the dam's completion in 2015."

The reported purpose of the dam is water storage and it can also support a hydroelectric power station in the future.[2] Another purpose of the dam which has been widely reported in the Turkish press is to reduce the freedom of movement of PKK militants. Blocking and flooding valleys in close proximity to the Iraq–Turkey border is expected to help curb cross-border PKK smuggling and deny caves in which ammunition can be stored. A total of 11 dams along the border; seven in Şırnak Province and four in Hakkâri Province were implemented for this purpose.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aslanda%C4%9F_Dam

syriancivilwar,3d0t67,-ll--ll-,3,Sun Jul 12 18:30:32 2015 UTC,I'd imagine it is due to lack of a say in where and how these get constructed.   This is a bit different but let's say if Germany were to start constructing dams in Germany as well as France the French people wouldn't be too pleased because France has it's autonomy. France might decide to build the dams themselves but the key thing is it's up to them to decide.   Now that example is quite silly but the Kurds do want more autonomy and rights in Turkey and clearly don't seem to like these big irreversible projects imposed by a government they don't think represents them.

All I said was ""This is like Erdogan's mini SS"" and I was basing it off another article which said:   A pro-Uighur group attacked the Thai Consulate in Istanbul late July 8 over Thailand’s purported expulsion of Uighurs back to China.   It reminded me of the behavour of the SS in the early days of the nazi's and hence why I made the comparison and I wouldn't be surprised if they've set up something similar, with my previous example of the rallying of supporters."

Turkey would have to go to war with the YPG, and this will surely anger Kurds throughout Turkey to the point of civil war.

syriancivilwar,3d6exc,Rebel44CZ,2,Mon Jul 13 22:46:16 2015 UTC,Airbase becomes meaningless if you put enough holes into runway.
syriancivilwar,3d6exc,IceZG,3,Mon Jul 13 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"Since WWII this has proven to be very inaccurate. Holes can be filled quickly. It is extremely difficult to put a runway down for long.

syriancivilwar,3d6exc,Thuycidides,2,Tue Jul 14 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"Its a bit more complicated than you posted.

syriancivilwar,3d6exc,Rebel44CZ,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:00:29 2015 UTC,At this point in the war the SAA doesn't exactly have the greatest capabilities any more. But they still could probably handle holes in the runway. There's also the factor of if they are willing to risk the few air assets they have left out in open while IS is right on the door step and probably has eyes on the base.

I shifted my support to the regime forces. Not Assad, but the SAA and more recently, Hezbollah. The fact that Assad used gas on his enemies is always in my head but for now they seem like the best option"
syriancivilwar,3d0vuk,RekdAnalCavity,8,Sun Jul 12 17:40:36 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to me. I started this war extremely pro-rebel (and tbh thought that getting rid of Assad might create a pro-Western state in the region.)

But there is nowhere near enough trust right now for such a scheme to take place. Negotiated truces and joint-control agreements (like the ones in some towns in Eastern Qalamoun) seem to be the best way of building that trust, but it's a long way to go from here to the negotiating table."
syriancivilwar,3d0vuk,the_red_wheelbarrow,5,Sun Jul 12 18:02:11 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the goverment is part of the problem, and the way it is structured and acting right now is not any better, perhaps even worse then some of the more radical opposition groups. You can't expect any reforms or ""moderate actions"" from a goverment that has built itself around the idea of being ""coup-proof"" and values loyality to Assad above actual ability in many cases. Just look at the way they fight: torture, terror-bombings and executions are pretty  much an integral component of their warfare tactics. So many people have been killed and driven out of their homes that expecting them to forgive all the atrocities and to lay down their arms just because ""they might be the better option"" is impossible. If they do win, we can expect a big ""cleanup"" that will make the Balkans look like a joke.   In the end, I don't know who to support, but I know that in the current situation most major factions look equally scummy, the goverment being first and foremost among them. Perhaps some kind of ethnic divide will be the best solution."
syriancivilwar,3d0vuk,MaslinuPoimal,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:17:04 2015 UTC,Those truces right now only mean a temporary end to the fighting not a promise of reconciliation or reform by the government.

I might be with you but for one thing and that is I don't think there is any possibility of a regime victory being followed by significant reform. The lesson they would learn from coming so close to defeat yet still winning would be to crack down even harder on any possible dissent and further consolidate their monopoly on power. Look at Assad's farce of a referendum - that says all you need to know about how willing they would be to give up even an iota of real power.

I bear absolutely no malice towards individual soldiers of the SAA (provided they're not committing criminal acts). I bear absolute hatred for the individual soldiers of the Islamic State, who's membership is predicated on committing huge atrocities in the name of their religion.   Isn't this exactly the position pro-SAA people take?  That doesn't just work for ISIS, same thing applies to al Nusra and large parts of the former Islamic Front.  There are assholes everywhere, but the average SAA guy is much more likable than the average Nusra/ISIS/.. guy. At least that is my reasoning."

Westerners are way too used to open their mouth and critzise anyone every time they see something unjust or something bad happen. And this wont be tolerated at all in governments Syria."
syriancivilwar,3d0vuk,Boerek1,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"I think it is unimportant, if you have to evaluate what is best for the people there.

Also you are an American patriot and America is at war with ISIS, so you think no matter who wins, and how terrible the alternative for the people on the ground  is, the main issue is ISIS gets their ass kicked."
syriancivilwar,3d0vuk,Boerek1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:39:11 2015 UTC,"No I was just trying to find an explanation why you said that the SAA gives the people of Palmyra a break.

If Palymra was a Christian/Shia/Alawite etc. your argument would have been legit, but this a conservative Sunni town."
syriancivilwar,3d0vuk,Boerek1,-6,Sun Jul 12 16:56:46 2015 UTC,"Assad is most definitely not the lesser of the two evils in this situation. He and his family have been torturing Syrians for decades. If you want to base it on numbers, the SAA is still worse.    there is little doubt that life under SAA authority is better, from a western standpoint, than life under the Islamic State   Syrians aren't looking at the situation from a western standpoint. Why are you wishing and congratulating based on your views and not of the people there? The fact of the matter is, Assad's track record is worse than that of ISIS, even with all their disgusting massacres.   I bear absolutely no malice towards individual soldiers of the SAA   The SAA merely acts as Assad's arm, don't try to separate them from Assad. They practically worship the man.    I bear absolute hatred for the individual soldiers of the Islamic State, who's membership is predicated on committing huge atrocities in the name of their religion.   I sincerely doubt that every soldier in ISIS is committing or wants to commit ""huge atrocities"". The majority go to the battlefield and die like any other soldier. But that doesn't mean they should be supported or congratulated right?   Why not use the same logic that you do with the SAA?"

But I have relatives in the SAA whom I've heard curse Assad countless of times. I simply understand their position more than i do any ISIS member (>who's membership is predicated on committing huge atrocities in the name of their religion.)  Assad has no problem bombing his own home province. Hell, Asma al-Assads ""Hometown"" is nothing but shit and rubble by now (Homs). And I saw a really old propaganda piece showing a man being asked by a Syrian officer ""what would you do if you caught your family being anti-gov't?""  The man said ""I'd report them. If they won't listen I'll burn their house down and kill them if i have to.""  This is simply terrifying, and it is this obedience that you are referring to. But it's just that, propaganda.  I totally agree with you on  >Syrians aren't looking at the situation from a western standpoint.  But there is a reason why in mid-2013 most SAA soldiers fighting in their hometowns (that is not NDF) were transferred to other fronts to decrease probability for defection for soldiers who won't fight their own townsmen.   And if I told you many SAA soldiers are just like for example Laky, normal, opinionated people who feel they are fighting for their country, even if the policies are wrong (idk maybe laky felt this afterwards or not but you get what i mean).   Several thousands of soldiers are simply forced to fight because their home is under SAA control and can be targeted for reprisals if the soldier defects.   I can't celebrate SAA soldiers being killed like I did in 2012 when all I had in mind was the hope that the protesters/civilians killed by SAA would be avenged any way possible. A checkpoint blowing up was the most hard-on inducing sight ever, but that is simply gone now. And by now you have to ""separate them"" from Assad.  Because no matter how ignorant these soldiers are, you can't take away from what they consider ""Honor"" and ""patriotism"", as there is nothing much you can really do about people who are brainwashed in the midst of a civil war, but either fight them or keep disagreeing with them."

I mean they are excellent in urban combat, bust their preparation for this was mostly in hit-and-run/guerrilla situations and maybe defense. The syrian conflict is the fist time they have undertaken large scare offensive role and clearing out neighborhoods. am i missing something?"
syriancivilwar,3d0b6b,redrojava,2,Sun Jul 12 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the opposition have benefitted from employing guerilla style tactics in all their active cities and towns in 2012? Or would the SAA just have carpet-bombed and swept through the strongholds to the point of which FSA would need to keep up and attempt to perform on a similar ""conventional force""-scale?  My dad's friend who was in the military (in syria) said once that had the FSA made themselves a low-level insurgent force, only protecting the protesters, and doing hit-and-runs, political hits, and occasional large-scale checkpoint bombings etc. (which they did for a few months) Instead of conventional offensives against ""weak points"" in gov't held cities (didnt expand on the weak points part), before being overrun by reinforcements (Homs, Rif-Dimasq), they would have seen much more success and wouldn't have stretched out their capabilities so soon on capturing towns and attempting to hold out against a much greater air-force and heavily-trained 4th brigade armored units.  Is this true? Or did they already do this?  And would the badly-equipped and supplied FSA have suffered their current fate sooner or later?  Also great post, always learn new useful words from them: like disparity and patron state haha"
syriancivilwar,3d0b6b,TheCapeman,2,Sun Jul 12 16:49:46 2015 UTC,"I whole heartedly agree with your friend's father. Talk about what the armed opposition should do generally gravitated between attacks on government positions and infrastructure (bridges, airports, TV stations, and ministries), and protecting protesters. The latter ended up happening because the general sentiment among the opposition was that Assad or the government would eventually thaw, or that the military would eventually serve and protect the populace from the intelligence services and the sub-state. Having witnessed Hama and pre-1990s Syria, the older generation in support of the opposition advocated for attacks in the government and infrastructure. Unfortunately, they did not make up a significant portion of the opposition, and the younger, naive revolutionaries held true to their ideals regarding self-defence and cast pragmatism aside. They thought what they were doing was best."
syriancivilwar,3d0b6b,kebabji,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:41:23 2015 UTC,"thanks. good points.  the last few conflicts with Israel were more defending motherland, driving out occupiers etc. Which are completely different motivating factors than the role they have taken up now. It's a transformation, but true, this battle experience might be largely useless against Israel incursion."
syriancivilwar,3d0b6b,redrojava,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"Israel is far from gun shy  Israel has a true blue ""peoples  army"" made up from any men Israel  thus war is waged only for national defense and every dead or captured solider is a national trauma  in a battle for home like the Golan defense in 73 Israelis will take  80% casualties before contemplating withdrawal  for Israelis all wars after 1973 were bloody ""war games"" for tactical positron and not ""real"" war"
syriancivilwar,3d0b6b,packleader1988,2,Sun Jul 12 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"am i missing something?   No, you correct, no doubt this war has forced Hezb to evolve. It's a change from a decade preparing a defence of Southern Leb with guerrilla tactics to offensive operations involving hundreds even thousands of fighters.   It's a different style. For example Hezbollah would never mass hundreds of men around a town if it was the IDF they were fighting. The airforce would tear them up. Hezbollah's Nasr Brigade for example uses 3 man teams for most ambushes.   So its a new form of warfare. Of course many of the older Hezbollah guys probably still remember the Israeli occupation and the civil war when these types of attacks, even if not common, occured."
syriancivilwar,3d0b6b,gonzolegend,0,Sun Jul 12 17:50:20 2015 UTC,this war might fundamentally change Hezbollah. I mean Israel wont want to occupy Lebanon again as now they wont make the mistake of underestimate Hezbollah. And guerrilla fighting has evolved a lot in the last decade. Even Hamas inflicted 50+ casualty on IDF. Perhaps we shall see Hezbollah maintain its guerrilla capabilities as a deterrent to Israel and get more entrenched in Syria (and perhaps Iraq) over the next couple of years as a regular army!?

As for our ""adventurism"" in Southern Lebanon, if Hezbollah's rocket arsenal wasn't located there you couldn't possibly pay us enough money to cross that border. If there's any country we want absolutely nothing to do with it's Lebanon."
syriancivilwar,3d0b6b,oreng,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"the reference to West bank was in terms of umpteenth failed ""negotiations"" which was happening with respect to withdrawing from South Lebanon which finally happened when the South Lebanon Army leadership was liquidated by Hezbollah and Israel realized that further occupation would be too costly without a proxy doing the dirty work.  Hence ""negotiation"" was out of the window and 2000 withdrawal was unconditional. And since Israel stopped it's adventurism, I believe the Israel-Lebanon border has never felt safer!"

It does. Remove Hezbollah from South of Lebanon, and we're back to the 70s, when you had all sorts of incompetent PLO groups who would throw anything they own at Israel, ineffectively nonetheless. Israel follows with a disproportionate response, obliterating the group, killing a bunch of innocents in the process, makes another incursion with barely any resistance from Lebanese side, then goes back to Israel flashing V signs. Rinse and repeat. The difference nowadays, is that you have all sort of wanna-be Jihadis and sunni-extremists who don't give a hoot about the live of Shias in southern Lebanon, grinding the populace between Israeli firepower and Jihadist extremism.

syriancivilwar,3d1vku,jordanianman,3,Mon Jul 13 01:32:00 2015 UTC,"Well, it's paying off. And, unfortunately, I can't look at the old text (tweet was deleted), but I'm looking over your translation over the first paragraph and I don't really spot anything wrong. The only thing that's kinda tough about trying to correct how someone translates from language to language is the fact that you can translate more than one way, especially because of how the order of words in a sentence is structured in Arabic. Sometimes you'll have to re-arrange it for it to make sense in English, and I'm sure you know that. Sometimes some words aren't necessary. For example, you translated ""المضمن الموافقة"" to ""approval"", which is only one word. Madan (the first word) means that the approval happened. But, it would make sense to write it in English, because the word approval, one word, fits both words just fine.   Now, just to touch a few things that you put the ""?"" next to. حراك الشعب السوري is the first one. While ""harak"" does mean mobility, in this sentence, it refers to the word 'movement' rather than the literal word of moving.   The second word ""حريصة "" can be translated to keen on or behind, both ways work. Just an odd word to translate, I guess, you're right with the way that you did it.   For the third one, where you have <blank>, I'm not sure what word you're referring to. (Again, that's what I was talking about at first, people can translate differently, by changing the order of the words). I'm assuming you are referring to the word ""يتعرضوا"", which is just one word, coming from the word ""يتعرض"", but ""يتعرضوا"" refers to the plural version of that word. It just means exposed. So, in that sentence, it means "".. and it will not accept the exposure of retaliatory measures in the event the regime fall."" However, in that very last sentence, perhaps 'regime' is a little too harsh sounding.  النظام السوري means the Syrian system, which does refer to the regime, but the word regime has more negative connotation in that instance that it does in Arabic.  I don't know how you would translate that to sound more neutral, though.   All in all, I think you did a perfect job for translating that, and I don't see any mistakes."

It's less than Saudi, and more tough to extract in some cases, but it's still one of the highest in the world. However, when it comes to natural gas reserves, the only country with more natural gas than Iran is Russia. Saudi Arabia has plenty, but not as much as Iran. Also Iran is very abundant in a significant amount of different types of rocks and minerals.   However, I do agree, with what Saudi Arabia has, it should be easily beating Iran in proxy war. I do blame Saudi Arabia's dumb understanding of politics, which is partly due to the fact it is controlled by the Al Saud Family (as those family members rise to those positions very easily, many times not being qualified for them)."
syriancivilwar,3d1vku,jordanianman,2,Mon Jul 13 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"Politics are a bigger constraint. Saudi's potential proxies aren't cohesive like Iran's, and the US leans very heavily on Saudi to prevent undesirables from becoming recipients. Iran had multiple pre-existing proxies (SAA, Hezbollah, Iraqi militia) to pump money, weapons and fighters into. Saudi had none, and has been dealing with an ever-evolving assortment of potential groups for the duration of the war. They've been unsuccessful at creating a durable proxy group to operate through, but they're attempting to do so by choosing amongst groups that already exist. Iran entered Syria with its proxies already established."

The PMU as a whole gets small arms, ammunition, APCs and refurbished tanks from Taiji (mostly T55s and T60s~ era stuff).  Ayn Al Assad airbase has a couple hundred of these militias working literally meters away from 100s of US servicemen + Apaches in the same base. They are under the PMU banner and as such take order from Baghdad."

syriancivilwar,3d2rqr,Luvsmah,3,Mon Jul 13 01:43:32 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that little progress has been made, but mostly because the pesh don't want to take the town until the ISF is pushing towards Mosul. It's a largely Arab town and taking it would require expensive urban combat. Plus it's been an attritional win for them to have Isis control the town. Isis weapons and fighters keep pouring in, getting identified by pesh in the high ground north of the city, and pulverized by usaf strikes. I'm pretty sure tal afar and Sinjar get hit by a cjtfoir strike every single day. Looking at their daily updates you see a dushka, mortar, or fighting position eat JDAM in those towns super regularly."
syriancivilwar,3d2rqr,MrBingBongs,2,Mon Jul 13 02:41:18 2015 UTC,So it is more centered around targeting ISIL's manpower then? Tying down their forces in Sinjar and then pounding them there?
syriancivilwar,3d2rqr,MrBingBongs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:44:21 2015 UTC,"I'd say thats more of an ancillary benefit derived from the situation. The Peshmerga's plan A would likely have been to regroup after the Ninevah plains offensive and then push south taking sinjar etc when the planned ISF operation to retake Mosul happened this past spring. Since that didn't happen theyve pretty much decided to hold the line, fortify their positions, and wait. They aren't willing to attack Arab and non-Kurd areas if there is no sign of the Arab central government moving to retake control of the Arab north/northwest. The meatgrinder dynamic playing out in Sinjar and Tal Afar for the forces of the relevant ISIS Wilayats is more of a silver lining than a strategy. The pesh themselves are taking casualties in the skirmishing, IEDs, SVBIEDS, and sniping/shelling taking place."
syriancivilwar,3d2rqr,MrBingBongs,2,Mon Jul 13 03:54:42 2015 UTC,I meant that tal afar is a largely Arab town. Sinjar is left in taken for the same other reasons but is predominantly non Arab. The shortest answer is that no progress will happen until the ISF starts rolling north or the pesh completely change strategy.

You have to think of the audience and how the documentary has to, in a limited amount of time, explain the situation to people who aren't entirely familiar with the situation. They obviously can't explore all the nuances of the situation."
syriancivilwar,3cyqbi,Dont_LookAtMyName,2,Sun Jul 12 14:14:44 2015 UTC,"That would be fair if they even gave an inkling that they were following that logic. But Maliki had certain people arrested, and they didn't look into whether there was any legitimacy there. They talked to guys in Jordan and the Gulf who sponsored terrorism and propaganda and just lapped it up hook line and sinker. They completely fell head over heels for that false narrative. It's the same for the rebels.  They never once stepped back and said, hey maybe the rebels aren't as moderate as people would like them to be, and hey, maybe it's not the smartest idea to be arming rebel groups across the world. It was nearly propagandistic."

I listen to NPR a lot and I heard this argument a lot. Whenever they discuss arming rebels there's almost always a panelist or guest saying ""arming the rebels seems to be a national pastime of US foreign policy and it never works"".    And when it comes to Maliki he does deserve a shitload of blame. US forces were fighting insurgents since they got there, but Maliki was careless and turned it into a very sectarian thing like it is today.

They talk about how Maliki disenfranchised many of the Sunnis and how that helped lead to the rise of IS because some of those tribes that we paid and armed under Petraeus have joined/helped IS's cause in Iraq.  I wish they would go back and update some of these documentaries though, especially the Losing Iraq one, as it is only up to date as of June 2014 and as we all know, there have been many changes in Iraq since then."

His support for ISIS is childishly naive and morally reprehensible, and I haven't heard him say one single thing that could be considered reasonable. He seems completely unaware of the meaning and utility of ""reasoning"" as such. So, if your standard for discerning reason is, ""He says whatever comes to mind as long as he can maintain support for ISIS in that particular sentence"", which is all that he seems to be capable of doing, it needs to be updated."

The only constant is his support of ISIS, everything else comes second. In one comment, he says ISIS's slavery is a Western media conspiracy, in the second he supports it fully. He said that he was against the atrocities committed by ISIS, until ISIS members convinced him that they were not actually atrocities... you know, because they were ""true Islam"" and completely allowed.

I positively encourage leftists who offer themselves to the ranks of YPG etc. out of political solidarity. I don't feel that my beliefs on this matter are contradictory, since my litmus test is mostly related to motivations, although I'd certainly condemn a leftist who fought for YPG and committed atrocities while downrange.

There are a multitude of reasons people go, but one thing in common is that they all go for the same reasons. To help establish a new system they think is better. For socio-political motivations, this includes religious. For revenge or retribution. To help establish infrastructure, or to destroy it. They are the same, two sides to the same coin. And it bothers both the ypg volunteers to be likened to isis volunteers, and isis volunteers to be likened to ypg volunteers, but beneath the ""the leaves of the tree"" that end in different actions, the underlying mental reasoning of joining is the same.   When one foreigner joins one group, it becomes fodder for other foreigners to join a different group. The evidence, in my opinion, will eventually stack against them in that they make the situation worse.

syriancivilwar,3czt68,Leadback,-2,Sun Jul 12 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"In principle it's as bad as fighting for Islamic State. Overwhelmingly, these are individuals essentially going to kill people as part of a conflict they have no personal stake in. Moreover, many of the fights do not have an ideological stake in the YPG's fight; tell me how many foreigners fighting for the YPG are far-left democratic confederalists hailing from Marxist, leftist and communist political roots. Nor do many of these foreign fighters plan to stay in Rojava, accept de facto citizenship and turn their fight into a fight for their new state's survival; it's more akin to voyeuristic conflict than any kind of liberation struggle for these people. Plus, there are cases like Samantha Jay using her participation to shill for war profiteering companies, Michael Enright pulling a publicly stunt with people's lives, or fools wanting to fight for the YPG because they hate Islamic terrorists or think the PYD will morph into a secular western democracy overnight and live happily ever after.  Realistically it's better than fighting for al-Nusra Front or Islamic State. The YPG aren't committing a fraction of the atrocities those two groups are (which remain the biggest recipients of foreign fighters as far as I know). Moreover foreign YPG fighters show zero inclination towards radicalism or terrorism in their home countries, which is as far as their governments' concern goes. So long as a returned YPG fighter isn't running around cooking up pipe bombs or shooting up cartoonist officers, it's a not ideal but tolerable situation."

Because I think, in principle, the motives are completely different there. Only with the very most reductive reading (i.e., going to fight in a foreign war for a non-state group) could you possibly say it's as bad to go and fight for YPG as ISIS.  It seems pretty obvious.

syriancivilwar,3cylf9,NotYetRegistered,3,Sun Jul 12 17:25:20 2015 UTC,How much have the Peshmerga done recently?
syriancivilwar,3cylf9,Stefan_Zhirkov,2,Sun Jul 12 02:17:52 2015 UTC,Peshmerga are historically a defensive army aimed to liberate Kurdish lands. To do this they need ammo and weapons; this is where these shipments come in handy.
syriancivilwar,3cylf9,NotYetRegistered,7,Sun Jul 12 06:22:28 2015 UTC,"So what you mean is, nothing. It's like if the Western Allies stopped at the French border in WW II and begged for arms instead of pressing into Nazi Germany and helping destroy it instead of making the Soviets do the work."
syriancivilwar,3cylf9,vacines_r_lies,2,Sun Jul 12 13:36:31 2015 UTC,The Western Allies took western Germany so the Soviets could not take it. They drew a line on the map which became the iron curtain.

syriancivilwar,3cylf9,monopixel,-2,Sun Jul 12 12:40:48 2015 UTC,Peshmerga has reached the border between Arab populated and Kurdish populated cities. They can not continue to push in to Arab dominated areas without being accused of ethnic cleansing.

There are going to be at least another 1000 pesh casualties in the mosul operation. Maybe you dont care, but the children of those soldiers do care."

As for the mosul operation, i think it will be a shiite militia- some sunni tribes - peshmerga alliance, but victory will be claimed by isf and pesh."

syriancivilwar,3cylf9,revengineering,7,Sun Jul 12 14:41:03 2015 UTC,"I attended a sort of lecture by the military about arming the kurds recently, and they said they would send what is requested. The military has sent armoured troop carriers in the past (very popular with the Kurds) and some soup kitchens (unused and collecting dust), but he said the most requested item was large quantities of anti-armor weapons to provide a quick response to ISIS armored carriers and SVBIEDS. This is exactly what we are seeing with this shipment I think (milan and PF3).  I am quiet happy with the general decision taken by th government, honestly would not have expected that. Shipping weapons into war zones has always been a big no-no as with the grundgesetz etc."

It also helps the regime politically because they can say ""we have a military presence across much of the country and are therefore a legitimate government through our projection of national control"" (despite not controlling more than a few km beyond their outpost)."

The naval base they have in syria, the fact syria buys their weapons, they're long allies, ect. I think, recently, Russia has lost faith in Syria's military capabilities. Who would know the true extent of the SAA/NDF capabilities than Russia or lately Iran. Russia has been involved with the Syrian military for a long time. Maybe they've finally realized that just training their officers and sending advisors won't achieve their goals.   I say this because Russia really isnt doing that much. The new trainer jets havnt been delivered, some new small arms. Elijah Magnier has claimed they somehow upgraded their mig 29s in country and are receiving Urugan's but i think just a resupply because they already have some i thought. Both are still unproven. Russia could be supplying much more to improving the average SAA soldier. They could be supplying new radios to make the SAA more combat effective or just improve the overall kit of the SAA soldier. If you look at Ukraine, the rebels are fully decked out with nice optics, undermounts , radios, ect and you rarely see even republican guards with any type of optics on their weapons."
syriancivilwar,3cysvm,IgorForHire,24,Sun Jul 12 01:00:33 2015 UTC,Russia already influenced the conflict greatly - Lavrov engineered the chemical weapons deal that provided Obama a way out of bombing the regime. That surely saved Assad's ass.

Assad gets no airstrikes and a deal that appears to come from the Russians (it may in fact have, but the deal probably wouldn't have been possible had it appeared to come from the US), the American president gets to avoid the hairy domestic political situation that apparently drove him to seek (and fail to gain) Congressional approval for the use of force while still getting the ball rolling on removing chemical weapons from Syria, the Russians get to play at being the peacemaker and gain some measure of stature.

syriancivilwar,3cysvm,Sierrahun,3,Sun Jul 12 09:53:03 2015 UTC,"I say this because Russia really isnt doing that much.   We can't really assess how much Russia is currently doing as we do not know what it's transport and financial limitations are. As well as Syria being able to provide additional training for any new equipment.  Unlike separatists in Ukraine Syria does not have common border with Russia and has a much bigger army to support. Even delivering common supplies can be a problematic task to achieve. At the same time operating in much higher threat environment can put additional constraints on SAA capability to withdraw troops from the border to conduct training with new equipment types.  Moreover, I'd like to note that much discussed Yak-130s delievery is nonessential right now (I've explained it already), while something like delivery of Uragans\Smerches is much more needed.  Recent news of Russian military finally adopting ""new"" S-80FP rocket and Splav (rocket producer) being ""ready to supply it abroad"" correlate with the said Elijah Magnier talking about new ""MiG-29 rocket delieveries"" although IIRC it can be used with most other air platforms in Syria's possession. It's a very subtle and cheap way to increase SyAAF AtG capabilities.  Dwelving into specifics I'd like to add that I've rarely seen regular rebels with optics on their AKs. Even Russian Army regulars have started adopting extensive optics usage relatively recently. While things like radios and grenade launchers are something that could indeed be supplied but the question of priorities over other things and training still stands."

Accusations of him masterminding the assassinations of Politkovskaya, Nemtsov, the Memorial lady etc. are highly disputable. He always talks openly about killing terrorists, flaunts his wealth and remains in power knowing full well the outside world knows of his brutality.

syriancivilwar,3cysvm,WorldsupportsBashar,3,Sun Jul 12 16:22:36 2015 UTC,"People here brought up a lot of reasons but I think they ignored one very important: gas supply to Europe. It is essential for Russia to remain the primary EU gas supplier as that it is our main source of income (for now).  Any additional competition on that market could hurt both our elite and, consequently, our economy heavy enough to percieve things like Qatar-Turkey pipeline as a huge threat.  In that context recent Russian-Turkish gas tube deal looks very interesting. It may as well be Russians trying to offer alternative solution to Turks so to partially influence their geostrategic interests in Syrian war outcome, while at the same time solving problem of transitioning gas through Ukraine (for obvious reasons).  For that reason I consider this to be one of the main reasons of Russian heavy involvenment in the conflict. The Islamism ideology spread and Syria easing Russian Navy operations in Mediterranean Sea being the other ones.  Hence, Russia must ensure that Assad does not lose this war. Winning it on the battlefield, though is going to be pretty costly and unlikely even for Russia-Iran duet.  In my opinion winning it by slowly influencing the interests of countries participating in the conflict while maintaining strong support for Assad is a bit more achievable. That is why we see the deals with both Turkey and Saudi Arabia emerge.  As a sidenote sanctions being lifted from Iran is essential in enhancing Iran's capabilities to achieve that goal thus Russia's position is to ""lift 'em all"" (according to Lavrov) at once while the US, for example, support more gradual procedure.

There were, obviously, exceptions like Yugoslavian and Georgian crisis but apart from that average Russian citizen is too preoccupied with his\her (not the easiest) day to day life to care about what happens around the world.  Syrian crisis is a very interesting example of that. Despite the fact that media tried to exploite public's hate for extremism and everything that is connected to it Syrian events seem too distant even for Moscow residents, which means people in other places care even less.

This (English) covers the remaining questions with update as recent as sep 2014. Pay attention to the ""with which of the following opinions on the confrontation between the regime and the opposition in syria would you agree with most"" answers dynamics.   I think this not only related to the Syrian Civil war. Russia wants to kiss Irans ass in order to gain some friends.   As I said this has some serious long term relations perspectives. Russia has passed the point where it tried to prove the world that ""Western"" isolation is not working.   Needless to say that support is mutual. I.e. Iranian defense minister during his of Moscow Conference on International Security 2015 ""proposed a multilateral cooperation initiative between Iran, Russia, China, and India against U.S. missile defense and other international threats."" (Source)  I think both countries understand that they heavily depend on each other when it comes to security problems in the region (including Syria, which I discribed above) and world wide.   Recent event held in Ufa is also very telling.  All in all, describing said events as ""Russia wants to kiss Irans ass in order to gain some friends"" is a bit of an understatement as Iran needs Russia as well as Russia needs Iran. Things used to be quite different. Not anymore."
syriancivilwar,3cysvm,blash2190,6,Sun Jul 12 14:04:15 2015 UTC,"An underrated point is Syria's ideological appeal to Putin. Recent Russian foreign policy has been extremely nationalistic and anti-western, drawing the identity of the Soviet Union into a modern context in which Russia is not an equal superpower but a significant player among many. Pursuant to that, we've seen the Kremlin end the tentative western integration of Medvedev (and Yeltsin's) years and openly pursue relationships with regions and countries that the west is either trying to court or has lost, including in Central and East Asia, the Balkans, South America, and the Middle East.   Syria, as part of the 'resistance axis' thus has significant ideological appeal to Putin, notwithstanding that they were a CIA client regime less than a decade ago. Just as Russia embraces Iraq, Iran, and does not list Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation, so too do they increasingly see the Assad regime as another pawn in what they view as a new version of the Cold War. Their willingness to support Assad sends a strong message to authoritarian and dictatorial observers across the globe that no matter how repressive or murderous you might get, if there's a convenient frame narrative to justify our support (terrorists in Syria, regime change in Libya or cultural-economic imperialism in Greece) then you can rely on help from Mother Russia."
syriancivilwar,3cysvm,Leadback,7,Sun Jul 12 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"I consider your perception of Putin building anti-West axis based on ""repressive"" and ""murdurous"" ""authoritarian and dictatorial observers across the globe"" to be too far stretched and to come out of lack of understanding of Russia as a country.   This, specifically   Pursuant to that, we've seen the Kremlin end the tentative western integration of Medvedev (and Yeltsin's) years and openly pursue relationships with regions and countries that the west is either trying to court or has lost, including in Central and East Asia, the Balkans, South America, and the Middle East.    is a very questionable point of view that I've noticed to appear only recently with Ukrainian conflict gathering momentum and Western media giving it's Putin-driven narrative new spin.  I think it's quite obvious that Russia has no resources to create and maintain ""resistance axis"" against ""the West"" through support of ""third world"" regimes. That is the luxury this country can no longer afford.   Cold War has shown that such relations are extremely unstable and expensive. Countries that are your partners today will readily change their allegiance for a hefty sum and a some guarantees tomorrow as your opponents are no strangers to supporting such regimes as well. I don't think I need to bring examples as the entire second half of the 20th century is full of them.  Russia's support for Assad has more to do with goals essential to countries survival and it's elites well being than with some kind of ideological authoritarian opposition to ""the West"". See, my other answer here for clarification.  P.S. I'm not trying to offend in any way and if I did it, I'm sorry, but it seems to me you should try to diversify your sources of information when it comes to Russia."
syriancivilwar,3cysvm,blash2190,2,Sun Jul 12 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"At a guess I would say that Putin's support for Assad has similar reasoning for the USA still looking after the Shah of Iran after he was deposed.  If Putin/Russia, was willing to throw the Assad family under a bus after decades of close friendship between Moscow and Damascus, that would do irreparable harm to Russia's reputation among the many former USSR / USSR client states which still look to Moscow very favourably.  I don't think Russia  is willing to do absolutely everything to keep Assad in power, but I do think if Assad goes, Russia will look after him and his government."
syriancivilwar,3cysvm,parameters,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:55:26 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree with you that this situation has some similarity to the USA\Iranian Shah crisis but there are serious differences as well.  In my other post I explained that well being of Russia as a state depends quite heavily on this conflict.  This is very important as I doubt Russia would go to such lengths to save Assad's government otherwise (just my opinion).
syriancivilwar,3cysvm,blash2190,4,Sun Jul 12 14:29:07 2015 UTC,"I believe the geopolitical reasons behind Kremlin's actions, while exist, are only secondary to the main goal of the Putin's regime: keeping its own people in line which requires throwing them some money from time to time.   The simple thing people tend to overlook is that the Russian economy is resource based and competes directly with those of the third world countries and especially those in the Middle East. The more unstable the ME is the more valuable the oil will be and the more Russia will earn selling its own oil. Just recently the messages of the Iran nuclear deal dropped the oil prices about 10% and so fell the Russian currency by the same 10%. The wars also come with perks such as raising demand for Russian weapons, opportunity to play important guys in the UN security council, and to expose the failing US foreign policy for propaganda points. While losing some contracts that Russia would make with Syrian and Iraqi regimes be it a peace time may be bad, it's more than compensated with the said benefits.  Another thing to keep in mind, although this applies more to Ukraine than Syria, is that the main threat to Putin is not NATO, US, Islamists, or any other outside power, but his own people who may (in theory) one day question his divine right to own Russia. Putin is afraid of color revolutions and reacts badly every time some autocrat loses power to popular uprising even when the bastard in question isn't his dear friend. His propaganda presents every such uprising as a US facilitated coup and goes in length about how they were well off before and bad now because of the revolution. Currently, more air time in the Russian media is devoted to depicting all the misfortunes of Ukraine and Syria than to issues of their own country. In short, Putin wants Assad to stay for awhile if nothing else just to dissuade his own people from having bad ideas.  For me, this explains why Kremlin neither lets Assad go, nor throws much support for him to win. They don't want Assad to lose, but they're perfectly happy with the current ""dynamic stalemate""."
syriancivilwar,3cysvm,zandaq,2,Sun Jul 12 14:56:25 2015 UTC,Syria is not very important to Russia. Putin supports the Syrian governement as long as it is not too costly to do so.

syriancivilwar,3cysvm,solalbog,2,Sun Jul 12 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"being so ungenerous when their WW2 debts were ""forgotten""   Because it was clear back then that Germany wont start another war. Greece on the other hand will start to fall into the depttrap again. Also it is not just Germany which is so ""ungenerous"" to Greece also all other 18 Euro member states are pissed off (except maybe Italy). We are not talking about some minor sums, I read today they are negoatiating over a care package worth 100 billion!!! dollars. And the problem even that money will just drain away if the Greek state remains as unproductive as it is right now. Turkey managed to get up on his feet again with just a fraction of that! And sry I dont really see a politician who can explain to his voters why their tax money (which the rich Greeks arent paying) should be spent in paying the Greek pensions or to further subsidise the overblown state while a lot of European countries are going through austeritiy measures too (Belgium, Finland for example right now). I am sorry, but if Greece comes through with its cadge schemes, the European Union will collapse, because parties hostile to the idea of European Union will then rise to power."
syriancivilwar,3cysvm,Boerek1,2,Sun Jul 12 01:35:52 2015 UTC,"from the wiki ""In 1942, the Greek Central Bank was forced by the occupying Nazi regime to loan 476 million Reichsmarks at 0% interest to Nazi Germany. In 1960, Greece accepted 115 million Marks as compensation for Nazi crimes. Nevertheless, past Greek governments have insisted that this was only a down-payment, not complete reparations.[1] In 1990, immediately prior to German reunification, West Germany and East Germany signed the Two Plus Four Agreement with the former Allied countries of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Since that time, Germany has insisted that all matters concerning World War II, including further reparations to Greece, are closed because Germany officially surrendered to the Allies and to no other parties, including Greece. On Sunday, February 8, 2015, the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras appeared in front of the Greek parliament and officially demanded that Germany pay further reparations to Greece.[2] On April 6, 2015, Greece demanded Germany pay it the equivalent of $303 billion in reparations for the war. Germany replied that the reparations issue was resolved in 1990.""  Also I'd say that Greece and other southern countries ""protect"" the north from the direct influx of refugees, provide cheap labor, holiday packages and investment opportunities  annd tbh 100B seems like pocket change in relation to world economy/spending....  Greece is the philosophical base from which comes democracy, debt creates debt, someone is printing money and... and... Feawen likes this"

The EU was founded to come over the old hostilities and to start a new begin without the ballast of the old times. And if you come with your historic figures, than I can come and say to Greece ""Hey you should give us Thessaloniki back"". The Germans then can also claim the land stolen from them (like Sliesia) back in 1945. If you want to have such an EU, I am sorry this structure will than inevitably collapse. Also it is not only Germany paying for Greece, also much poorer countries like Lithuania, Estonia and Slovakia have to pay for the Greek .    direct influx of refugees, provide cheap labor, holiday package   Turkey delivers this much cheaper.   tbh 100B seems like pocket change    No it is not.

syriancivilwar,3cysvm,Boerek1,0,Sun Jul 12 05:43:55 2015 UTC,"NATO forced/coerced its members to be nice to Western Germany to build it up as an example during the Cold War propaganda battle.   Right now Germany has no cynical reason to be nice to Greece. Plus, what they're really afraid of is Spain, Portugal, and Italy rebelling against German-imposed austerity policies the way Greece has. Worst-case scenario is the EU has to pick up their debts in one go, which are too great for them to swallow. Best-case scenario Germany is embarrassed because they forced Southern Europe into austerity policies that made no economic sense and just profited Germany whose export-model benefits from other countries staying poor. They're blatantly selfish, but there is a logic to their heartlessness."
syriancivilwar,3cysvm,eisagi,0,Sun Jul 12 12:10:05 2015 UTC,"They're blatantly selfish,   Wow they are so selfish. They only put 80 billion Euros into such a small little country like Greece. How greedy! Turkey also followed the IMF programm (Yes of course these measures imposed by the IMF were unpopular too but Turkish people just got their shit together) and it came out if it just fine, with a fraction of the money Greece got. The money spent there should rather go to people which are in real need like for example the Syrians in the refugee camps of Lebanon rather then to the non-taxpaying Greeks. But for the starving Syrians even one billion is too much. In my opinion I hope Greece will leave the Euro and we finally can have a closer Turkey-Greece(-Russia?) cooperation. This would finally lead to the reconciliation of Turks and Greeks. But of course politicans like this ratface Varoufakis will be gone then. Neither Erdoğan or Putin will accept a leading Greek politican which insults them."

I looked at both and saw some obvious differences.   The ground is different. In this ""staging video"", the two people are standing on red, uneven, and rocky ground, whereas in ISIS's video they are on a beige, flat, and sandy ground. The clothing is of a different color. In the ""staging video"" the hostage's clothes look like a light orange, whereas in ISIS's video the clothes are a red-orange color.   Those are the two obvious differences that I noticed. There are some other small details that I noticed, but I can't be sure about those.   The way the executioner stands is different. In the ""staging video the executioner is standing ""too"" upright compared to ISIS's video where the executioner has his head tilted a bit and seems a bit slouched. The color the executioner's hand is different. When comparing the skin color of the executioner and the hostage in the ""staging video"" the skin looks very similar. Whereas in ISIS's video there is an obvious difference. The color of the shoulder holster also seems different. In the staging video the colors looks beige, whereas the color of the shoulder holster in ISIS's video looks like a dark brown."

Dear Senator McCain! We recommend you next time in foreign travel, and especially on the territory of Ukraine, not to take confidential documents.  On one of the devices of your colleagues, we found a lot of interesting things. Something we decided to put: this video should become the property of the international community!   Cyberberkut is an Ex-Ukranian now Russian hacking group that some have connected to the FSB/GRU/Kremlin  Berkut is a reference to the elite ex-Ukrainian anti-riot unit that killed dozens of people in the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine. Many Berkut members have joined the Russian military and now are fighting in Eastern Ukraine for the pro-Russia forces.  their recent achievements include for example    Hacking of the German Chancellery and the German Bundestag Attacks on U.S. private military companies. Publication of correspondence of deputies of (political parties) Batkivshchyna and Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform. Publication of correspondence with the United States Embassy in Ukraine and United States foundations. Disclosure to public of telephone recording between Yulia Tymoshenko and Nestor Shufrych. Disclosure to public of telephone recording between EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton and Foreign Minister of Estonia Urmas Paet.

syriancivilwar,3cyin6,uberkami,5,Sun Jul 12 09:56:01 2015 UTC,in the exection video of the journalist james foley the execution itself is definitely staged. the knife goes back and forth on the neck more than 6 times without a drop of blood.  you have to watch it in slowmotion. also it looks throughout the video like they are standing infront of a greencreen.
syriancivilwar,3cyin6,the_beees_knees,2,Sun Jul 12 00:36:49 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean it is staged. Another explanation could be that 'Jihadi John' is a used as a propaganda tool for his British  nationality but simply lacks the stomach to behead people himself. This would explain the fades to black in most of the videos he appears in.  It infuriates me people who the moment they see something they don't understand instantly assume there must be some ultra - complicated conspiracy going on. You think the most powerful groups in the world would make such an easy mistake?   also it looks throughout the video like they are standing infront of a greencreen.   No it does not. Like seriously this is one of the weakest points ever. Every time it is repeated I wonder if followers of this conspiracy have collective hallucinations because nothing in the video looks green screened.

I provided a much more plausible option for why there was no blood which does not require a massive conspiracy.   but i am telling that there is no actual execution in the video.   So why does this mean it was staged? The aftermath and dead body is clearly shown, remember this video is also made for western audiences. They want to attract young Muslims, not make them disgusted. This is a way to make it easier to begin with.   i have seen many beheadings by now and this is the first one where there is no drop of blood even after like 10 slices to the neck.   As I stated before, I believe that Jihadi John is just used for propaganda because he is British, other people will do the actual execution. They don't want to break the illusion of his character so they simply stop the video and show the aftermath. If you call that 'staged' then I agree with you, however the idea that it is green screened or that there was western involvement is beyond absurd and backed up by no evidence whatsoever."

The difference is that the government retains support from those countries which have been friends and allies of an assertive and independent Syria and Arab stance for 30, 40, 50 years. There's a reason why every country, every regime which supports the insurgency militarily, logistically, financially, politically, or diplomatically whether on a huge or small scale are all those who have been enemies of Syria for 50 years and have typically lapped up Israeli and American feces standing squarely against Arab self-determination and Syria's national interests. The Arab governments who helped foment and keep it going still are blatantly owned by Washington and want another slave to add to their club. It's an insurgency supported by world and regional powers who overtly want a less powerful Syria in place which will politically and legally codify its own submission and abrogate its own national interest for their advantage and benefit. It's plain as day.   And they rely on and use that element of Syrian society which is disenfranchised, easily manipulated, most intellectually vacuous, and degenerate in its religious practices - that portion of the society which poisons the lifeblood of this country - to try and bring about that victory. A Syrian victory in this war however long it takes will mean a triumph over them and their foreign masters and every loathesome idea and value they stand for, and this element will be systematically rooted out with fanaticism and never allowed a voice or a space from which they will ever be in a position to threaten the unity and independence of Syria again."

All the major parties in the ruling coalition (save the KDP) are very close with the various militias in Hashd, and arguably more comfortable with Hashd than the ISF.  So there's little motivation to ensure that the army is revived and stabilized when the ruling coalition's military priorities can be met by Hashd. This leaves the ISF to wither on the vine to a certain extent, as evidenced by the lack of recruits sent to American trainers. And since there isn't really any viable opposition that could challenge the current government and win, parties close to Tehran and the various militias that Iran sponsors look to have a stable hold on Iraq's national politics and security dynamics. Iran's allies already held political power, and now have a dominant role in the security apparatus, with few real threats to either."

You always want to make the boogeyman seem a lot scarier than he actually is when you want to get people against it.  They don't really have any idea of strategy or tactics besides ""storm the front."" They also have no aircraft or heavy equipment besides some loan rocket trucks from Iran.

Whereas the northern rebels constantly put out videos where they take out lone tanks, trucks etc.   For example if you tracked the TOW strikes you'd notice that the southern missile strikes are all concentrated at the same time. The battle for Tel Harrah saw half a dozen TOW strikes in a day. Similarly, Brigade 52, Southern Storm, Brigade 82 all had numerous TOW strikes all at once."

Any possible target got hit, from MG posts to tanks, to regular trucks/busses.  American backdoor deals with Turkey (Predator drone being shot down over Latakia comes to mind)."
syriancivilwar,3cyd62,YK42,10,Sat Jul 11 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"The TOWs were meant as a means of vetting rebel groups and boosting the morale and media presence of moderate groups. They weren't a reward for being moderate or even a serious attempt at making them militarily formidable.   The SF was already mostly vetted through the long-standing MOC room in Amman (which has had close ties with many of the groups for years), and already dominates the large majority of the south.  More or less, the SF didn't need to be vetted or mapped, and was already big enough that it didn't need the propaganda boost to counter ascendant jihadist groups.   Moderate groups in the north didn't have such luxuries, so the TOW program aimed to help fix that. Results have been mixed at best, namely because it wasn't followed up with the ""stage two"" of the plan, which is probably sitting in an increasingly-dusty file cabinet in Langley."

But I'm fairly sure it consisted of coalescing the various TOW recipient groups into a moderate coalition, similar to the SF. Those groups would then receive training and other equipment and be deployed to primarily fight IS. That train-equip program still exists, but it's instead pulling individuals from each group rather than uniting them as units, and is having very limited success finding recruits accordingly."
syriancivilwar,3cyd62,ofarrizzle,6,Sun Jul 12 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"Why doesnt the SF receive more?   I'm also curious about this, but one of the reasons why we don't see too many TOW strikes in the south can be related to the land there, which is mostly flat compared to the North which is full of mountains and hills."

They don't have heavy weapons, whereas ISIS has tons courtesy of the IAF and SAA. My impression is the YPG advances until they meet ISIS, forces them to concentrate forces to meet the attack, then calls for airstrikes to wipe ISIS out. The YPG is a good partner for the USAF because they hold their ground. It's much harder to drop bombs on a battlefield when everyone is running in all kinds of random directions (like during the fall of Mosul or Ramadi).   The SYAAF is not close to being as effective as the USAF, and their communications with ground spotters aren't as good.

syriancivilwar,3cwz11,Shuklulum,10,Sat Jul 11 14:39:32 2015 UTC,"Full text:  The Bab al-Hawa border crossing between Turkey and Syria gained a new status this week. Customs officers will now man the Syrian side, checking the contents of trucks entering and leaving Turkey. “Interior Ministry” officials will stamp passports and laissez-passer documents.  The iron gate was restored after being damaged in the fighting; it now looks like any other crossing between the two countries, except that the officials on the Syrian side aren’t from the government. They’re rebels who’ve captured Idlib Province. Report haaretz But that’s not the whole picture. There’s also the Ahrar al-Sham militia, which constitutes part of the Al-Fatah Army, which in turn includes radical Islamist militias, some of them on the list of terror groups.  These, by the way, are the same “moderate militias” the Western countries, particularly the United States, are willing to cooperate with. The Bab al-Hawa crossing serves as a test case for formal ties between Turkey and Idlib, where the people have started using the Turkish lira as legal tender. If this model works, the sides hope to expand to other crossings in rebel hands.  In contrast to this normalization, Turkey is widening its military campaign against the Kurds in Syria, whom it views as a graver threat than the Islamic State. The Turks fear a Kurdish state on their border.  The zone, declared autonomous by the Kurds, is run by the Kurdish Democratic Union Party, which supports the PKK — declared a terror group by Turkey. Reports of Kurds expelling Arabs and replacing them with Kurds feed this fear. Kurdish denials of these reports hardly impress Turkey.  “We won’t allow the establishment of a Kurdish state on our border,” declared Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who’s in the middle of coalition talks. If not a Kurdish state, what about an ISIS state?  The political battle inside Turkey has been affected by what happens on the Syrian border, culminating last week with leaks in the Turkish opposition press about Ankara’s intention to invade Syria, set up a security zone for refugees and thereby prevent Kurdish control of the border zones.  The Turkish opposition made clear the interim Turkish government has no authority to go to war in Syria. Davutoglu countered that in matters of defense the government has full authority to take steps it deems necessary.  He was convinced that as on previous occasions, national security would suffice for the government to do as it wished. Turkey was planning to send 18,000 troops 30 kilometers deep and 90 to 110 kilometers wide to set up refugee camps, but the plan was actually designed to set up a buffer zone between the two Kurdish-controlled areas.  But Erdogan realized that not only did the opposition — some of them potential coalition partners — object, but the army wasn’t rushing to battle. The high command demanded clearly written directives from the politicians for fear of violating international law. It also demanded that the government consult with Russia and Iran to ensure that Turkish military involvement wouldn’t spur direct involvement by those countries.  It’s a weighty argument, though the army didn’t hesitate a few months ago to enter Syria to capture the ancient tomb of Suleyman Shah and rescue Turkish soldiers guarding it. The main reason for the army’s objection this time was the understanding that any invasion of Syria to establish a buffer zone meant long-term involvement in the Syrian war.  The public dispute between the army and government laid bare something in the wake of Erdogan’s expulsion of the army from politics: The army still has widespread support and can challenge the president, even after Erdogan made changes to the high command.  Erdogan held an urgent meeting of the National Security Council, resulting in the decision not to invade Syria. At the same time, Turkey deployed tanks and other armor along the border near the cities of Sanliurfa and Gaziantep, a few kilometers from the Syrian border where the Syrian Kurds are in control.  Despite Erdogan’s efforts, these Kurdish militias, which have recruited a few hundred volunteers from abroad, are winning. The fighters have driven Islamic State forces out of dozens of villages along the border, helped from the air by Western, particularly American, planes.  American praise for the Kurds showed Erdogan that the Kurdish threat isn’t only on the border. The Kurds have become Washington’s ally, and Erdogan’s plan to block their control of the border region is doomed to failure. Special U.S. envoy John Allen visited Turkey to express Washington’s objections to a Turkish operation in Syria.  Officially, Allen discussed possible military cooperation with Turkey, but in practice Washington clarified its opposition to a buffer zone and warned against Turkey’s continued cooperation with radical forces in Syria, based on reports that the Islamic State continues to use Turkish border crossings to reach Syria.  The United States is struggling to establish rebel ground forces to operate in tandem with airstrikes. The effort to recruit rebels for this grandiose plan in the war against the Islamic State, for which Congress has allocated $500 million to train 3,000 fighters, is facing intense difficulties. According to Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, only 60 of 7,000 volunteers have been trained so far.  While the air campaign has stung some of the Islamic State’s income sources and halted its progress at least in Iraq, it’s far from turning things around. The control territory between the militias and the government is becoming permanent, without any side capable of making a decisive blow."

Yes, extending it into Rojava would inconvenience the PYD, and I believe that is what the MHP wants (*), but that is not what the current Turkish interim government seems to be proposing.  Assuming this buffer zone is established, then what happens if the YPG just go south of it, as these guys want to do ?  http://scanpix.no/spWebApp/preview.action?search.offset=0&search.searchId=1098141930&search.tabId=video&search.refPtrs[0]=ta25892f&printSingle=  With enough American air support, Manbij to Aleppo to Afrin isnt that difficult.  Does the Turkish government then tell the army it's not a 30km buffer zone, but it also includes Aleppo ?  And all this is assuming that ISIS blithely accepts their loss of Jarabulus and environs to the Turkish army, and doesnt in any way decide to use a couple of suicide bombers against their new enemies.  On balance, this intervention might well trigger war between ISIS and Turkey sooner rather than later, which I see as a good thing. It wont inconvenience Rojava overly much, so Im meh on that aspect.  And the inevitable casualties from this will push votes from the AKP, whose idea this intervention is, to the CHP, who are resolutely against Turkey being involved in Syria, so thats a plus for me.  But Im damned if I can see why the AKP thinks this is a good idea, as they are holding all that downside, for an operation which will affect the Rojava marginally and Assad not at all.

syriancivilwar,3cwz11,adropofhappiness,2,Sat Jul 11 21:35:06 2015 UTC,"Turkey is playing no different role than Syria played during the iraqi insurgency.   Here's two quotes from the DoDs 'Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq'  March 2007    …Damascus appears unwilling to cooperate fully with the GOI [Government of Iraq] on bilateral security initiatives. Syria continues to provide safe haven, border transit, and limited logistical support to some Iraqi insurgents, especially former Saddam-era Iraqi Baath Party elements. Syria also permits former regime elements to engage in organizational activities, such that Syria has emerged as an important organizational and coordination hub for elements of the former Iraqi regime. Although Syrian security and intelligence services continue to detain and deport Iraq-bound fighters, Syria remains the primary foreign fighter gateway into Iraq. Despite its heightened scrutiny of extremists and suspected insurgents, Damascus appears to want to appease Islamist extremist groups. Damascus also recognizes that Islamist extremists and elements of the former Iraqi regime share Syria's desire to undermine Coalition efforts in Iraq.   September 2007   Approximately 90% of suicide bombers in Iraq are foreign fighters, and most continue to use Syria as their main transit route to Iraq. This network funnels about 50 to 80 suicide bombers per month into Iraq to conduct operations. Since January, there have been nearly 280 suicide attacks, accounting for nearly 5,500 deaths, mostly of innocent Iraqi civilians. [authors' emphasis added]"

The strategy was, at best, a short-term success. Syria will now be forced to contend with battle-hardened jihadists returning from Iraq."

syriancivilwar,3cwmax,refrencher,17,Sat Jul 11 12:08:08 2015 UTC,I may have overlooked it but I think you missed to mention the fact that the military command of ISIS consists of many former Iraqi military officers who gained experience during Saddam's rule. They obviously bring military structure and strategy that most other rebel factions lack.
syriancivilwar,3cwmax,sgamsterdam,7,Sat Jul 11 12:22:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  I listed this as my fifth possibility. The reason that I am skeptical that this is a unique advantage to ISIS is that it stands to reason that the SAA and whoever various SAA officers were defecting to early in the war (the FSA?) should also have a similar advantage. Now, I understand that the SAA is plagued by the typical problems that many armies in the region face, such as promotions based on loyalty rather than competence in order to ""coup-proof"" the army. But didn't the Iraqi army under Saddam suffer from the same problems? Why are the experienced Iraqis outperforming the experienced Syrians to such a great extent?"
syriancivilwar,3cwmax,sgamsterdam,11,Sat Jul 11 12:49:10 2015 UTC,"I thing the big difference here are the factors time and experience.  Time. The Saddam officers were fired all fired and unemployed after the Americans took over in 2003. These guys got together and started forming what is now ISIS. In other words, they had 11 years to organize and structure their organization. SAA defectors, on the other hand, typically had no time at all to organize their organization, as from the moment of defection on they had to fight.  Experience. Running an army is one thing. Running a rebel army is another. One needs to apply ideology to gather fighters as there is not (always) enough money to pay for the soldiers. Secondly one needs to influence the locals and use them for your own gains. ISIS mastered that skill long before, as those documents of that high ISIS dude that was the brain behind the organization showed.  Time and experience, I argue, are what set ISIS out from the other rebels. They know their trade."

It follows that the more fanatically religious the Arab army is, the more militarily effective it will be, notwithstanding the cultural-derived ineptitude.             *An exception is the 2007 Lebanon War, but that organization wasn't trained by Arabs and perhaps is intrinsically non-Arab in culture."

syriancivilwar,3cwmax,the_red_wheelbarrow,3,Sat Jul 11 15:42:52 2015 UTC,"Good stuff op, that was a great read. I think that some of the points kind of  reinforce each other, for instance the reputation for brutality (Mongol style scare tactics) + the mobile forces + A few important + motivated forces + strategic decisions snow-balled into massive success seemed to mean that they can capture sunni majority iraqi cities when there is a big disparity in forces in favour of the defenders.   I think that at least in iraq sunni resentment of the government (and by extension the iraqi army) has fed into their gains, they haven't been successful at attacking shia majority areas in iraq for example.   There is also the fact that many of their soldiers/command structure have actual military experience, whether it be from the Iraqi army or in various Islamic rebel groups across the world, this is compared to most others in the region who don't have this (not sure if the SAA loosing to Israel counts all that much).   A big part of it also seems to be just basic organisation and them being a relatively large, relatively well organised/equipped force  that can concentrate troops against smaller forces across a large area,  in a conflict where military forces (even the iraqi army) often seem fractious and locally strong partisans that are weak, uncoordinated or unmotivated) when they leave 'home turf' this may have been important.   Also I think isis is successful because most of the other forces in the area are poor or limited and they've just taken advantage of this attacking weak targets and places where they have a high chance of winning. We saw in the isis v hezbollah clashes in the mountains that isis lost (or are loosing) pretty handily and pretty quickly to a well organised force."

They litter areas with ied when they are pushed out, they use children as suicide bombers, they dress up as ypg and go door to door shooting children, the elderly and pregnant women indiscriminately, they give 9 year old kids to foreign fighters as sex slave rewards.  Every other faction is in a similar paradigm 'defeat enemies and control territory until the other side gives up', Deach don't want to rule over Syria, or even a part of it, they want to crest a world where mainstream Sunnis, Shia, Jews and Xtians are all dead, enslaved or subjugated.

Obviously in the beginning people were asking for democracy and freedom. Changing a dictatorship style of government to a democracy is impossible overnight. In Europe it took a long long time as well, and still in a sense there is an aristocracy. Rebels trying to work democratically with the locals may have been unsuccessful because people were used to work selfishly because that's how you do it in a dictatorship. ISIS, on the other hand, deals with the locals how they are used to be dealt with, by absolute force an brutal oppression.  It reminds me of the old soviet days. When the system collapsed, the standard of living improved yet paradoxically people became less happy.  Apparently people care more for stability than wealth/democracy/freedom."
syriancivilwar,3cwmax,Tabeia,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:40:43 2015 UTC,"A point you haven't mentioned is ISIS's manpower. Estimates vary from 30k to 200k, and no one is really sure how much fighters they really have, especially considering the influx of foreign fighters.  Another point: ISIS controls mainly rural areas. Since food is the ""hardest currency"" of a nation, that gives them better logistics when it comes to supply and maneuvering."
syriancivilwar,3cwmax,24SevKev,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:09:41 2015 UTC,"The Iraqi Saddam era army was corrupt but much better and experienced than the SAA. Also many foreign fighters, not just your average westerner but experienced militants, and commanders. All that in one large group.  Large support base in Iraq built over the years, unlike the syrian rebels which rule mostly deserted barrel bombed cities.  Much larger use of suicide bombings.  Years of real world experience by AQ and ex-baath members fighting the americans.  JAN is also effective but much smaller."
syriancivilwar,3cwmax,sirencow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:50:57 2015 UTC,One other factor is that just having territory in Iraq probably gives them advantages in terms of resources and money.

syriancivilwar,3cwmax,Yansoma,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:03:54 2015 UTC,I've also been a little perplexed and confused as to why ISIS has been able to maintain and exploit the military initiative WHILE also controlling vast tracts of land containing thousands of villages. You'd imagine that at least one of the little dots on situational maps would be fed up at this point. After all its just impossible for ISIS to be monitoring what's going on behind every closed door even with informants. All the analysis and reports I've read echo the same generalizations about ISIS structure and doctrine even though they've consistently managed to out maneuver their foes while the world just watches.  There are also a couple peculiar subtle things all their fighters do (whether it's the way they dress or move) that's distinctly different.  I read an article on War on the Rocks  that I thought brought up a very understated point in that this is the first time in recent history a hyper violent multi ethnic army of like minded individuals have managed  to seize land for what they hope will be a looooong time

syriancivilwar,3cwa4s,superislam,23,Sat Jul 11 08:42:47 2015 UTC,"Once again, the question is, why would IS try prevent the army from reaching Palmyra? The area around the city is mostly open desert, where they would be at a major disadvantage, against a conventional army with airplanes and all the paraphernalia of modern war. If they are smart, they are going to fight only in the city itself. And unfortunately IS commanders don't strike me as particularly inept."
syriancivilwar,3cwa4s,100100145,4,Sat Jul 11 09:47:43 2015 UTC,The open desert didn't prevent IS from taking it in the first place.
syriancivilwar,3cwa4s,annoymind,9,Sat Jul 11 13:00:02 2015 UTC,"Indeed it didn't. My point is not that the lack of defensible terrain around the city makes it easier to defend. After all common sense dictates rather the opposite is true. I instead claim that, because of the terrain any attacker would be capable of reaching the city, since the defender's best strategy would be not to resist an offensive to a significant degree, until the city itself. So IS's desert offensive could quickly reach the city and the major part of the fighting happened in the city itself.   This means that this offensive proceeds as quickly or as slowly as the SAA general staff would like it to proceed. Thus being 3.5 km away from the city doesn't mean much. The success or failure of the offensive is yet to be decided. As I mentioned so far it proceeds as SAA planers would want (and expect) it to proceed, yet it probably  proceeds as IS planners would expect it to, as well.  Edit: Fixed the repetition in the last sentence."

syriancivilwar,3cwa4s,SaxonMeister,15,Sat Jul 11 10:46:44 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, my impression is that IS never really tries to defend what they can't defend. Rather, to keep the narrative, when they loose something important, they quickly capture something else instead. For example their force  in Tikrit didn't seem to me as one built to repel the Iraqi forces converging on the city, but rather as one built to delay them. Yet after they lost Tikrit they captured Ramadi and Palmyra, and thus the narrative was kept intact.   Now I think they have some chance of defending the city, so they will try to defend it.  Also one should keep in mind that though IS's lack of concern about it's soldiers' lives makes it seem otherwise, the organization is quite flexible strategically, thus meaning a general rule about what they do can't be true all the time."
syriancivilwar,3cwa4s,100100145,3,Sat Jul 11 11:17:35 2015 UTC,They defended tikirit with a skeleton force and captured Ramadi with a equally small amount of men.

syriancivilwar,3cxasc,VCGS,3,Sat Jul 11 16:44:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a pretty poor and misinformed article. This part especially:   In February, Hezbollah troops tried to clear out rebels who had encircled two Shiite villages north of Aleppo, but the operation — which was overseen by Iranian Revolutionary Guard advisors — ended in defeat, said Firas Abi Ali, an analyst with the London-based IHS Country Risk group.   That offensive was pretty clearly led by Hazara's and SAA as evidence by photos and the captured men. Maybe there were some Hezbollah commanders involved but definitely no frontline troops.   I'm also not aware of any Hezbollah led offensives in idlib as claimed by the article."

syriancivilwar,3cwnqh,mahmou415,11,Sat Jul 11 12:26:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say there are multiple reasons.  Mainly that Daraa is not Idlib - this is a heavily fortified city, like Aleppo, that has been split between rebels and SAA for some time, its not an Idlib situation where the city's defences were breached suddenly and everything went to chaos. Daraa is near Damascus, it's an important city to hold for strategic reasons. If Daraa and the surrounding countryside were to easily fall like Idlib earlier this year, the rebels would seriously threaten Damascus. Losing Idlib has given rebels an advantage sure, but it's not the gateway to Damascus like Daraa is. Doesn't a rebel group control the water supply to Damascus currently? It's an important area.  That being said, after the fall of Idlib (and even Palmyra) it seems that some people now have an expectation that battles will happen more quickly and cities will fall faster, but in reality when SAA has some competent troops/commanders in the area, and have had time to dig in, stalemates will occur (and have been occurring for many years in Aleppo, Damascus and Daraa). But I wouldn't consider this failing on the part of the rebels - failing would be the SAA counter-attacking and capturing significant amounts of rebel territory, a capacity the SAA doesn't have at this point imo. So while the SAA are definitely defending well, they arn't really winning any more than the rebels are.  Another key point already suggested is that southern rebels don't have an as good command system as the rebels in the north, with bickering and fragmentation in the FSA groups. This probably is true. And yes the Islamist's 'lack of fear' of death helps, but non-Islamist forces play a significant role in the North as well and are just as capable as being good fighters, so this is something that can be overcome with training rather than being an Islamist results in you gaining magical powers. Training is key here really."
syriancivilwar,3cwnqh,cantaloupe_is_haram,8,Sat Jul 11 15:50:51 2015 UTC,"I think it was premature. The SF doesn't have the coordination of Jaysh al-Fiteh, and probably deployed fewer than half the troops. To be honest, I don't think the SF can coordinate the division-sized operations that JaF could. JaF was only a few, large groups that had already been closely cooperating for years. That's easier to coordinate than 58 different groups in ever-changing coalitions."
syriancivilwar,3cwnqh,ofarrizzle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:53:36 2015 UTC,Not necessarily true for the idlib campaign. They had those couple different FSA groups come join in as tank hunters and JMA and TIP and I think some other smaller groups came once it started.
syriancivilwar,3cwnqh,IgorForHire,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:50:29 2015 UTC,"They were fairly peripheral, though. Ahrar and Nusra provided the bulk of fighters, equipment and operational planning, and both groups have been so tight-knit for years now that they're very good at joint ops.  The SF just doesn't have that kind of operational cohesion, being closer to a coalition than a single military force."
syriancivilwar,3cwnqh,ofarrizzle,2,Sat Jul 11 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"Because it is much harder to attack than defend. Against Idlib they had overwhelming numeric advantage and an enemy that run away.  It is very, very hard to defeat a static defensive position with the weapons they have if the defenders keep their morale up and don't rout like in Tabqa or Idlib or other SAA ""tactical"" retreats."

syriancivilwar,3cwnqh,sloft__,5,Sat Jul 11 13:30:24 2015 UTC,"Yet the SAA hasn't been able to defeat them and has been losing battles against them for the past year. Daraa is not Idlib.

syriancivilwar,3cwnqh,SaxonMeister,13,Sat Jul 11 15:57:35 2015 UTC,People overestimate extremism here. Remember how the Japanese would fight to the last man in ww2? Southern Front soldiers need better training. They also have less experience in urban combat; most of the fighting they've done so far has been rural. Daraa is also well fortified. More fighting like Aleppo than Idlib. Also without suicide bombers they need to adapt tactics. Probably need tunnel bombs for Daraa.
syriancivilwar,3cwnqh,cdmjlee,7,Sat Jul 11 15:11:37 2015 UTC,"Regime supporters overestimate extremism because it helps sell the ""there's no 'moderates' left"" argument.

While extremism definitely fortifies morale, spirit can only get you so far as compared to training, coordination and resources.

If the SAA can't manage to avoid ATGMs or retreat without leaving all their supplies, after all these years, what makes you think their officers are well-trained/resourceful enough to organize mini-recon missions on top of their normal patrols?   Sorry if that sounded mean but unfortunately tactics that make perfect sense to us on our couches in the West often don't on the ground. The dynamics of this war can be so chaotic that these extra considerations are often either disregarded or put off because of time and resource constraints.  Honestly, I'm not even sure if the SAA has the fuel to spare for anything more than the most essential movements."
syriancivilwar,3cwngo,AofB,2,Sat Jul 11 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"Well my reasoning was that ATGMs would be a new threat that the SAA has never  faced before, while an ambush is amongst the oldest tricks in the book.

And no, you didn't sound mean."

syriancivilwar,3cwngo,Neosantana,2,Sat Jul 11 16:57:58 2015 UTC,I don't think they have been a major cause of casualties before the civil war though. And my assumption would imply the SAA is capable of learning only between wars.

But as of the Battle for Idlib we have no proof of any tactical armor adjustments outside of them sitting in the open as usual.   So assuming SAA commanders are inflexible embodiments of bureaucratic inertia, they would follow their tactical manuals, which would account for the possibility of ambush.   This is a very good point and ultimately brings up questions like:  How detailed are these tac manuals?  Are they used much at all these days?  Do the officers get an effective education in doctrine anymore?  I'm genuinely curious about this stuff but idk any answers."
syriancivilwar,3cwngo,AofB,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"Well, I doubt they would update their manuals untill the war is over (bureaucratic inertia and all that).

Though I guess it has deteriorated far less than tha state of the regular troops , due to higher survivability. The baseline level might have been worse, though."
syriancivilwar,3cwngo,100100145,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:05:27 2015 UTC,"Well, looking at the Donbass war, I feel like every Ukrainian or separatist brigade and artillery battery has like 10 drones with it, most of them bought by fundraisers, so they can't be that expensive.   And even if aerial reconnaissance is out of the question, wouldn't ground based one work as well? I assume a group large enough to capture tens of soldiers would be large enough to be visible."
syriancivilwar,3cwngo,100100145,2,Sat Jul 11 15:55:18 2015 UTC,"I see, you are right.   I still don't see why the SAA doesn't use more drones, since they seem quite an artillery heavy military, though I suspect that this question belongs to a dumb question thread more than it belongs here."
syriancivilwar,3cwngo,100100145,3,Sat Jul 11 16:06:52 2015 UTC,The SAA needs to be taught not to hand over ammo and weaponry to the other side before they can be taught about scouting territory before advancing.

The US doesn't have a problem with Islamists per se, but Ahrar al-Sham is still one of the most hardline group that is still considered part of the nationalist mainstream.    Ahrar al-Sham's political branch is very savvy and moderate. Statements like those made in this article are nothing new, and have been made in interviews with former Ahrar political leader Hassan Abboud more than a year back. But the political branch is at odds with what is happening on the ground, namely the fact that it would be very difficult for Ahrar al-Sham to remove itself from alliance with Jabhat al-Nusra. Wherever Nusra is present, Ahrar is there and vice versa. Now I don't believe the two are similar ideologically (before anyone says both are Salafists, the nuances are great enough to not lump them together) but it is difficult to see Ahrar ever acting as a counter-balance to Al-Nusra."

They've had their biggest electoral successes in Egypt and Tunisia, and Morsi resorted to declaring himself above the constitution while Ennahda resigned from government due to political deadlock.    Still, the MB is probably the best bet for figuring out this dilemma.  And so long as Islamism remains popular, that will remain crucial to democracy's success in the Muslim world."

While there are lots of groups and parties that are labeled as Islamic and are actively fighting for the shariah, you have to keep in mind that Islamic only means ""that believes in Islam"". The natural consequence is that parties similar to the Cristian-social groups of European tradition (CDU in Germany, the now dead Democrazia Cristiana in Italy) are labeled as Islamic. It is not synonymous of extremism whatsoever."

Assad can continue to use his airforce to strike military targets but the barrel bombs have been responsible for most of the civilian casualties in this war.  I also think the U.S. should force the U.N. to draft a plan to protect the Alawites in case of a regime collapse. Such a plan would not be perfect but it would save people from the inevitable retribution attacks that would come.  Again, sorry for the late reply.

syriancivilwar,3cvhi4,asaz989,12,Sat Jul 11 16:52:14 2015 UTC,"Nothing in this article mentioned secularism or democracy. Regarding the former the author straight up says they are an Islamic faction.   Regarding the latter, Ahrar al-Sham supports at least some form of democracy. At least a form of representative government that is subservient to a sharia council. Something akin to a Sunni Iran. This article expands much more on how Ahrar views democracy http://jihadology.net/2015/06/03/guest-post-ahrar-al-sham-spiritual-leader-the-idol-of-democracy-has-shattered/  But note in a lot of these Islamist circles, democracy is equated with secularism, and secularism is equated with being anti-religion. But in reality democracy doesn't say much about religion, it is just a form of government where power is held by elected representatives.   Edit: This is the relevant part of that article    What can be taken from Abu Muhammad’s points are that Ahrar doesn’t necessarily object to something democracy-like, or to a representative electoral process with a clearly Islamic reference. If Syrians want to elect representatives who will deliberate on how best to implement the rule of God as expressed in an Islamic constitution, fine. This, of course, is not a new position for Ahrar. One of the threads that has run through the Syrian revolution is that Ahrar al-Sham – which went from some motivated Salafists in Lattakia and Hama to the premiere rebel fighting force – has basically remained a political and religious constant. The revolution around Ahrar al-Sham has changed with time; Ahrar has not."

The nature of the state apparatuses and in fact the entire political system within Syria bears no resemblance to the Iranians' own vision for the Levant and in fact, foreign policy run from Damascus through the 1970's to all the years leading up to the eruption of war in 2011 has been one of the more stridently independently-minded in the world as a whole.

Had no detailed idea about the conflict, factions, and their ideology until one day in late 2014 , i ended up reading a thread about FSA in this subreddit.  voilà r/syriancivilwar!. then started the lurking. i daily went through hundreds of very well-written and informative threads and i thought ""these guys put helluva effort & spend hours gathering info & typing to enlighten people around the world expecting nothing in return. gotta encourage them by at least giving an upvote"". so here we are.  me thank every member here; pro-assad, pro-rebel, pro-kurd, pro-nusra, pro-isis, unbiased and everyone else.. thank you for contributing to this sub. me brain can't handle this much information. Hats off!! you people rock!  me so glad me found this sub."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,tahikei,5,Sat Jul 11 02:14:16 2015 UTC,It's haunting and sad because I was in Iraq during the occupation. I will most likely read and follow news about Iraq and Syria for the rest of my life.

syriancivilwar,3cukuq,YK42,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:17:16 2015 UTC,"No, not really and from time to time this sub falls back to plain old propaganda imo.    Early on this sub would suppress a lot of important information about the conflict.  The time from the beginning of the war until the rise of IS, this sub did a lot of harm in pushing a lot of propaganda and writing off key contrary information   I don't mean to oversimplify; I'm sure that many were useful idiots, but the basic tone of this sub has usually been a proxy of Turkey/U.S./NATO/Saudi/Qatar in various forms.  Even now the discussion of where IS and Jabat al-Nusra get their weapons support and training is largely an exercise in futility."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,conantheking,-1,Sat Jul 11 10:13:54 2015 UTC,"You are correct, though for a while in 2014 the sub became more pro-gov, with users such as raduev shutting down a lot of misinformation. Since then it has returned to pro-rebel."

syriancivilwar,3cukuq,GrandMuftiOfReddit,0,Sat Jul 11 09:43:41 2015 UTC,Amidst calls for ethnic cleansing.
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,ofarrizzle,-1,Sat Jul 11 02:52:50 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck, it wasn't cleansing, he very clearly explained it would be forced relocation of refugees. He didn't even mention an ethnic group when suggesting their relocation."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,orion4321,4,Sat Jul 11 06:02:48 2015 UTC,He called for forcibly deporting the entire populations of Deraa and Idlib for their political and religious inclinations and turning the provinces into national parks. But I guess that's somehow better.
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,ofarrizzle,-2,Sat Jul 11 10:27:18 2015 UTC,It's not ethnic cleansing.
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,orion4321,4,Sat Jul 11 13:36:57 2015 UTC,Political/religious cleansing targeting Sunni Arabs.  Is that somehow better?
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,ofarrizzle,-1,Sat Jul 11 13:44:27 2015 UTC,"No, he proposed the relocation of all refugees. Not a certain religion or race."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,orion4321,2,Sat Jul 11 14:19:35 2015 UTC,"By definition, it is."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,Neosantana,0,Sat Jul 11 14:33:18 2015 UTC,No it's not. The entire population of Deraa and Idlib are not one ethnic group.
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,orion4321,2,Sat Jul 11 16:16:26 2015 UTC,This sub took a jumble of various news articles and put them in a very understandable format.  It makes following the war more entertaining and understandable.
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,Messicus,2,Sat Jul 11 16:47:24 2015 UTC,"It has been far more informative that most of the coverage on the MSM, with practical, understandable information."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,Tarnsman4Life,2,Sat Jul 11 00:09:12 2015 UTC,"This sub allows me to follow it a lot more closely than I otherwise would be.  I work full-time, so I can't get my updates from Twitter; it's just too much too fast, and I'd lose important details in the noise.  But Reddit makes for a good platform in that important news is filtered to the top, but quickly enough that there are important issues being posted and discussed multiple times every day.  I'm in a bit of a happy medium.  I'm too busy to follow the conflict using other means, but if the sub didn't exist, my inability to (adequately) follow it on Twitter et al would basically preclude me from following it as closely as I do.  This sub is damned addicting."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,ofarrizzle,2,Sat Jul 11 04:18:27 2015 UTC,"Certainly. I studied IR and geopolitics is a big interest even if I dont work in the field. I was following the arab spring closely but didnt know much about Syria and got occupied with school to follow much after the first 6 months of the conflict.  Fastforwad to me working in media I was shocked and fascinated with the first isis videos I saw. I couldnt believe it. I had to know more, and it dragged me back into my interest in the arab spring and the issues going on in Syria.   I actually ended up here through a comment on /r/worldnews somehow and havent looked back. I follow this sub daily. Im trying to learn more about the region but it's 100000x more complex than I ever thought.   Also, I have 0 stake in this conflict, but I think its very sad how bad things are in Syria and much of the world doesn't know nor care."

syriancivilwar,3cukuq,dGlitch,2,Sat Jul 11 07:21:49 2015 UTC,"I discovered this sub Reddit while looking for information on a massacre of civilians that was being reported in Western Media back in 2013 (i think). I was looking for evidence to win an argument I was having with a friend. My friend was arguing  that the event was carried out by the CIA as some political move to get at Russia.    Since then I have started a degree that focuses on conflict and humanitarian aid. I don't tend to talk about Syria much because people think it's depressing and just don't want to know.  When I do have the opportunity to have a discussion, I focus on the impact of the war on civilians and the refugees inside and outside Syria's borders (and Iraq and Yemen)."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,theskyisblueatnight,2,Sat Jul 11 09:51:57 2015 UTC,"I've been interested in the Middle East since 9/11, but more importantly since we started deliberating the invasion of Iraq.  Out of that, 12 years ago, I went through what you're going through now. But, this sub has been a real gem of the site for me. As a westerner, there really isn't a better source for up-to-the-minute news about what's happening. And the range of viewpoints here grants a level of perspective that I wouldn't find elsewhere.  I just wish more in our country and in the international community were concerned with these things and the welfare of the innocent before they devolved, instead of some apathetic lip service at the onset and then years of radio silence."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,pfunkmort,0,Sat Jul 11 01:33:57 2015 UTC,"Nah its same as before, the only this sub changed for me as finding people interested in this like me, and to be able to talk with them."

Depending on your country and your university they'll teach you a ton of rubbish. No: In most cases it'll be rubbish. Go for islamic studies, iranology etc pp if you're interested in actual human beings and not in data sets."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,Michelundelang,2,Sat Jul 11 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I was planning to do a split on law studies and PoSci coupled with a launch into political activity as soon as I can.   However I live in Switzerland, and it is hard till almost impossible for me to get easily near a influential position in international politics.   Which course would you recommend if I'm interested in an executive (not analytical) position in international politics? I'm not particularly interested in the ME region"
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,ofarrizzle,3,Fri Jul 10 22:51:58 2015 UTC,"The problem with PoliSci is that it's really broad and employers often think it lacks rigor and applicability.  Kind of like studying psychology for an undergrad.  It's can be perceived as a bit of a ""filler"" major for people who don't quite know what they want to do, but get an undergrad anyway.  But it's totally fine if you're thinking law.  Just make sure that you're really sure about studying law and taking that all the way.  PoliSci is great as a pre-law major, but it can leave you very vulnerable if you end up not wanting to go into law afterwards.  Either way, I don't think PoliSci is a good investment unless you know you're going to get a Master's or higher afterwards."

syriancivilwar,3cukuq,JehanCottard,2,Sat Jul 11 06:06:17 2015 UTC,"Study whatever you find interesting as a first degree, then do a master's degree in something like public policy or international development. You'll find that Swiss universities already offer great master's courses in these fields, but also look at the UK. Avoid America, as their master's courses are usually a minimum of two years (and very expensive!).  Together with being multilingual (which I assume you are, being Swiss), these two degrees will get you into any IO, especially as the vast majority of them are already based in Switzerland. I know many people who took this path, and it worked out well for them!  But a word of warning: working for an IO like the UN won't make you a politician. It will make you a bureaucrat. If you want to get into real, dirty politics, I suggest you build a career elsewhere and then make the switch later in life. Preferably with a lot of financial backing and a network to suit!"
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,Michelundelang,2,Sat Jul 11 07:08:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm not too sure if I got it completely but thanks anyways.  What would you think about the career path of Federica Mogherini if I might ask?"
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,Michelundelang,2,Fri Jul 10 23:30:54 2015 UTC,"He meant that in most IOs making career is the same boring bureaucrat-job that you wouldnt look at with your ass on a municipal level. just better paid. There's no need to waste time on this. At all levels there are settled people that join from outside - so maybe you can do something like that, establish yourself in something you find exciting and join the IOs again at an executive level.  Party-politics are (at least here, in your neighbour Germany) dead-boring and almost as screwed as the bureaucracy. Here, too, you can join later and don't have to waste your time on lobbyism, boring speeches and campaigning"
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,Commisar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"Can you give me an example of ""joining later?"" Do you mean coming from military or economic background and then go into politics with experience in that field or what? I've a hard time figuring this out"
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,SolidGold54,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:14:50 2015 UTC,"Those would be examples. You could also try to work in the fields of NGOs - most of their work can be like ""actual cool executive politics"" too. Many NGOs are acting in a complicated and interesting environment that might rather suit the idea of politics than that bureaucracy in Bruxelles, New York, you name it. An interesting example: German NGOs have their own security-agency in some countries which will make you have to deal with the stuff that's going on in this subred, develop security-solutions and see some interesting country."

I'm obsessed with trying to fix issues and help solve them and I'm learning my ideal vision of solving problems , like in the context of solving a math problem or software problem , don't really apply to geopolitics . I always believed the U.S. Followed strategy on a path of a certain morality and it was the duty of its citizens to continue this and be aware that the rest of the world does not make decisions based on any morality . I've had chances to make and save a lot of money for me and my family and I've let my delusion to thinking I could help negatively impact my position and all my relationships with friends and family . My expectations were based on speculation , and this is terrible because having expectations in any way have been my problem . This conflict really doesn't affect me at all and I have endless options for my survival and the survival of my family without having to pay attention to global conflicts . I'm aware of enough at this point to understand the trends for the next 25 years and this is a long time to focus on myself and building my family . I will go to /r/futurology and similar threads but I will be avoiding any news about conflict that I cannot impact . I do think we are in the midst of the revolution of the individual and I will focus on myself as an individual . I am inspired to learn Arabic and I think this is what I'll take away from following the conflict as I transition to a stable life that is healthier for my mind. I have no advice for anyone ."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,Stefan_Zhirkov,-1,Sat Jul 11 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"Firstly good to hear.  Me being on the older side of the Reddit community, I got interested in the Middle East after 9/11, while in my last year of school and just before college. Was a crazy time and got accepted into a journalism course (so following the news was a priority).  Irish colleges 2002-2003 were a hive of Anti-War activity and took part in several protests while also reading books on the Middle East.   No reddit around to get my interest, but were many other sites Daily Kos had Anti-War sections, Democratic Underground, Information Clearing House, Moon of Alabama. All in all could follow the wars fairly deeply (though not quiet as well as Reddit offers).   So no this sub hasn't increased my interest, been obsessed with the wars going back 14-15 years now. Just easier to find the stuff without having 50 bookmarks for news, think tanks, blogs, forums."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,gonzolegend,2,Sun Jul 12 10:27:11 2015 UTC,"Amazing to read, goes to show how much events around us influence us.   Can I ask how you found a way into anti-war and political activism? Stuff like that is thinnly spread in my country and even if there was one, I doubt I'd find it."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,Stefan_Zhirkov,0,Fri Jul 10 22:30:57 2015 UTC,"For me it was easy, half my journalism class were interested in politics. Meetings and organising protests were going on all around the place.   Ireland is a fairly left wing country anyway. Wasn't as deep in anti-war and political activism as some. Attended 2 massive Anti-War marches against Iraq (one with water cannons) and several smaller ones outside the US embassy and some more around colleges. I did volunteer with the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign for a while but would never say I was deep into the Anti-war movement.   Always wanted to get in deeper and do direct action stuff, but direct action groups were secretive and paranoid. Remember one Anti War group at the time broke in Shannon Airport in Ireland and caused several million dollars damage to a US military plane transporting soldiers to Iraq.   Seriously considered going to Gaza for a while with the ISM they always looking for volunteers and will help you get into Palestine and sort out a place for you to stay. But the 2008 war and then stuff with Tristan Anderson derailed those plans."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,gonzolegend,2,Fri Jul 10 22:33:23 2015 UTC,"""Left wing"" and ""right wing"" are oversimplified terms which do little good. Ireland's position on abortion is very conservative by US standards."
syriancivilwar,3cukuq,Stefan_Zhirkov,0,Fri Jul 10 23:02:37 2015 UTC,"True but generally we have 5 left wing parties and only 1 right wing party. We have Fianna Fail (Center left) Labour (Unions) Greens (Enviromentalists) Socialist Party (Anti Capitalist) and Sinn Fein (militant Left).  Ireland War of Independence and the IRA were both majority far left movements, closer to Marxism than not. But yeah also been historically a Catholic country, so like many South American nations still got the hang-ups on Abortion though the Church in Ireland has lost most of its power the last 20 years."

You are correct, though, Daesh is generally more interested in executing prisoners for propaganda than keeping them for exchanges.

What he IS saying is that Assad signed a paper and ISIS never did. Its a technicality and one that all involved ignore.

It would allow isis to have a safe connection to Turkey as the front line would simply be pushed further.. They very well know that if the YPG begin to push they will not hold it.. The YPG would then need to push even further into Syria to block ISIS off from Turkey and also make linking Afrin near treacherously difficult if Turkey were to move in.. So lets assume isis know they can't hold it if YPG pushes again, just like Gire Spi, it was just going to be a losing battle.

syriancivilwar,3czp0i,Beyond_Dunya,2,Sun Jul 12 07:04:05 2015 UTC,"Not officially but some of their senior members are Al-Qaeda.   A senior al Qaeda operative known as Abu Khalid al Suri is a leading figure in Ahrar al Sham, a Syrian extremist group that is part of the recently formed Islamic Front. Al Suri’s real name is Mohamed Bahaiah. Bahaiah is a longtime al Qaeda operative who worked as a courier for the terror network. Spanish authorities think he may have delivered surveillance tapes of the World Trade Center and other American landmarks to al Qaeda’s senior leadership in Afghanistan in early 1998. In addition to being a senior member of Ahrar al Sham, Bahaiah today serves as Ayman al Zawahiri’s representative in the Levant. Ahrar al Sham is not one of al Qaeda’s two official branches inside Syria, which are the Al Nusrah Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham, or Levant (ISIS) . But Ahrar al Sham has closely cooperated with the al Qaeda affiliates on the battlefield even while engaging in a very public dispute with ISIS. Bahaiah’s role in Ahrar al Sham has been confirmed by two US intelligence officials contacted by The Long War Journal. One official noted that while Bahaiah is not the emir or overall head of Ahrar al Sham, he is considered a central figure within in its ranks and plays a significant role in guiding the group. Other al Qaeda operatives hold key positions within the extremist organization as well, according to the US officials.   http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/12/aq_courier_rebel_leader_zawahiri.php"

syriancivilwar,3cuurm,Balak_Jewboma,6,Sat Jul 11 03:08:07 2015 UTC,"Daraa city enjoys some support for the Gov, as well as some tribes in Daraa who still staunchly support the Gov. The army components deployed in Daraa city are experienced and competent after 4 years of Urban warfare, and there is more than enough equipment around, since Daraa always had a big army presence because it is close to Jordan and Israel.  Taking the city will be very, very hard and will exhaust the rebels to a big degree."

We have faught SAA in the past we are not going to lose lives to help someone we may have to fight in the future.  thats the way war is unfortunatly.

syriancivilwar,3csimg,zandaq,2,Fri Jul 10 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"Are there any guidelines on how an economy should be run under sharia? Or just zakat and do whatever.    There is a discipline of Islamic economics that deals with it, but much of its attention is placed on finding ways to work around the ban on usury for the modern economy. When you get to macroeconomic questions it's pretty much ""zakat and do whatever"".   Sharia frowns upon any additional taxation and doesn't have well-established views on public or state property leaving too much at the discretion of the rulers. Combine it with the limited accountability of the said rulers and you get yourself an answer to why all these Muslim countries ended up having large income inequality and tyrants for a good measure.   While this equivocal state of affairs, with Sharia not having much to say about macroeconomic policies, might sound as a good thing, it's never good when Sharia is concerned, because there is always a radical or two waiting to call your actions unislamic because ""the prophet didn't do that"".   This brings us to the current situation where ISIS and other radicals like to call the gulf countries ""taghut"" for mixing Sharia with the wretched Roman/Western laws (among other things), yet when confronted with the reality end up doing the same. ISIS itself has introduced taxes that have no ground in Sharia."

syriancivilwar,3csimg,zandaq,2,Fri Jul 10 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"This is interesting, can the state just seize your property if it wishes or do the need to buy it from you?    AFAIK if the property is lawfully yours it can't be taken without your consent. The same way the state can't force you to pay taxes aside zakat. Islam is pretty libertarian when it comes to personal property. Though I'm sure there are some loopholes in it and schools of thought that have different opinions.   This whole absence of any macroeconomic theory in sharia is really odd. Seems like something they would have talked about and set up guidelines for.    In the prophet times they had dealt with these issues on a case by case basis. For example, the ban on usury and taxing property seems to have been enough to keep the income inequality at bay (and the treasury full); technology simply didn't allow people to produce much wealth, unlike our times. But how would ban on usury and 2.5% tax on capital assets stop the widening income gap in today's economy? That's not gonna happen. In more modern times of course Muslim scholars thought about it and wrote enough to make the above mentioned disciple, but not having clear examples from the prophet times makes the matter open for discussion, disagreements, and a few bloody ""jihads"" here and there."

It was a three-pronged attack: from Khalidiya Island, the Bu-Hazeem area, and the areas lying between Khalidiya Township and Ramadi City. The ISIL attackers used 7 explosives-rigged vehicles in assaulting the eastern areas of the Province; mortar fire and handheld weapons were also used by the gunmen. Initially, the ISIL gunmen advanced into eastern Husayba and its surroundings, but the intervention by Iraqi air support enabled the security forces and tribal fighters to turn back the attackers and to retake all of the areas initially overrun by the gunmen, Security forces have reported killing 11 ISIL gunmen in the fighting. Iraqi air units bombed and sank a number of boats that the gunmen used in crossing the Euphrates at Khalidiya. Six ISIL vehicles and transports were also hit and set ablaze. 2 ISIL snipers were also killed. Meanwhile, reinforcements and volunteers have been deployed to bolster the security forces’ positions at Khalidiya.   ISIS is feeling the pressure.

If the coalition isn't willed to support SAA, the SAA have to be smart enough to make the coalition support them indirectly. Why wasting troops in the northern territories where the Kurds+Coalition are fighting ISIS (more or less effective) instead of reinforcing more importent battlefields like Tadmur or Deir-Ezzor."

syriancivilwar,3cs7on,Stefan_Zhirkov,4,Fri Jul 10 18:35:03 2015 UTC,"The only reason they advanced in Qalamoon was because they needed a propaganda victory. Deir ez-Zor is actually important to the regime as a point to tie down IS forces. And yeah, the SAA isn't losing on purpose. But they're losing because they're led by idiots for the most part. Aside from Qalamoon, the SAA has never launched an offensive against IS that wasn't aimed at retaking an area IS just took. IS still has near total strategic initiative against SAA. Hell, you could arguably say that IS in Qalamoon didn't really count since they're mostly sleeper cells rather than the main IS Army."

syriancivilwar,3cs7on,lurker093287h,6,Fri Jul 10 14:28:29 2015 UTC,I dont think it is a coincidence.  ISIS doesnt seem to care since they seem to be throwing everything they have at SAA/NDF.    They definitely want the city at all costs.  YPG needs SAA/NDF to hold out and reverse ISIS gains.  If they can the situation can end in a huge defeat for ISIS.  With all the resources they've thrown at Hasakah if they dont capture the city it will be a huge defeat.  If they are repelled there is a good chance YPG/SAA/NDF can counter attack and retake a large part of the province.

syriancivilwar,3cs7on,Rebel44CZ,3,Fri Jul 10 23:25:07 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who hopes that the SAA will be kicked out of Hasakah by this offensive?  My reasoning is that if the SAA is kicked now, the inevitable conflict between the SAA and YPG in al-Hasakah Governorate question will more than likely be solved already. If the SAA is gone from Hasakah, their presence in Qamishli would just become a liability to the Kurds, so the SAA can be kicked out from there promptly. The SAA being kicked out of Hasakah (and hopefully Qamishli later on) will save a ton of lives in the future as the alternative is two factions with roughly equal strength fighting it out. If IS takes the southern part of Hasakah, the coalition will just bomb their positions to dirt with the YPG retaking the entire city, and any damage then would be far less than with a protracted fight between the SAA and YPG in Hasakah.  SAA defeat in Hasakah is looking more and more likely by the day as their pocket in Hasakah is now split up into 4 tiny pockets and they control less than a quarter of Hasakah city itself. Even if they do repel the IS attack, their presence in the province is crippled since the Kurds have smartly chosen to take former Government-held lands. Zahreddine and his troops better leave the city while he can before IS gets to them."
syriancivilwar,3cs7on,Balak_Jewboma,8,Fri Jul 10 10:33:07 2015 UTC,Where exactly would the defeated SAA troops go?
syriancivilwar,3cs7on,NomenStulti,10,Fri Jul 10 11:00:18 2015 UTC,They'd leave for the artillery base.  The key in the long term isnt the city of Hasake - its the artillery base and the airport at Qamlishi.
syriancivilwar,3cs7on,Ian_W,6,Fri Jul 10 11:06:56 2015 UTC,Would the YPG would allow the SAA to just move through their lines like that?
syriancivilwar,3cs7on,NomenStulti,14,Fri Jul 10 11:42:43 2015 UTC,"Unless they intend to attack the artillery base - which is going to have reserves in it, yes, they will.  PYD's plan appears to to let Assad collapse in the rest of Syria, and then request the surrender of the pocketed troops."

syriancivilwar,3cs7on,Balak_Jewboma,5,Fri Jul 10 16:36:54 2015 UTC,"Either to Qamishli, join the YPG or affiliates or, more likely, they would throw down their weapons and uniforms and just blend into the civilian populace."

syriancivilwar,3cs7on,HardcoreBaathist,5,Fri Jul 10 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"SAA is a bigger long-term problem for the Kurds since they're in an extremely awkward state of truce with eachother. This means that the Kurds have been denied one half of two major cities in Syria, as well as their respective countrysides. And the YPG could never take either city with the SAA in them without an extremely bloody and drawn out fight since their garrisons primarily consist of NDF forces.  Massive fighting was going to erupt in Hasakah at one point or another. Either with IS trying to take the city or with major conflict inevitably erupting between the SAA and YPG once IS is gone. Better to get it over with now so the residents don't have to live in fear for conflict later on. It sucks, but the city has been in a tenuous position for a long time."

syriancivilwar,3cs7on,HardcoreBaathist,3,Fri Jul 10 17:11:11 2015 UTC,Then the YPG can finally take the city without worrying about the SAA.
syriancivilwar,3cs7on,defend435,2,Fri Jul 10 17:35:26 2015 UTC,They cant without either massive casualties or a destruction of the enitre city like Kobane.

syriancivilwar,3cs7on,Balak_Jewboma,0,Fri Jul 10 21:06:15 2015 UTC,Anyone who has sided with ISIS would have done so by now. I'm pretty sure this whole mess in Hasakah started with some tribes flipping to ISIS.
syriancivilwar,3cs7on,CallMeFierce,7,Fri Jul 10 12:27:14 2015 UTC,Arab tribes in hasakah might rank like this:   SAA ISIS Kurds   Kurds arent universally loved people in the middle east the way they are in the West.  The mess in hasakah started when ISIS decided to attack where the threat of US air strikes the least.
syriancivilwar,3cs7on,HardcoreBaathist,2,Fri Jul 10 12:38:17 2015 UTC,"I understand Kurd-Arab relations are not the best, but I'd be surprised to see pro-SAA tribes flip all the way to ISIS if YPG run the show. There definitely were some tribes flipping allegiances that screwed over the city."
syriancivilwar,3cs7on,CallMeFierce,3,Fri Jul 10 12:47:20 2015 UTC,"Most of the NDF might agree to a neutral agreement with the YPG. If ISIS is defeated and the SAA all leaves, those tribes know that working with the YPG is in their best interest."

syriancivilwar,3cs7on,defend435,3,Fri Jul 10 13:35:15 2015 UTC,Most of those already flipped with the recent offensive though.
syriancivilwar,3cs7on,CallMeFierce,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:10:24 2015 UTC,Honest question: is conflict between the SAA/NDF and YPG really inevitable? Do the Kurds really care about Assad one way or the other?  I thought they were principally concerned with ISIS not about creating another province of Kurdistan.  Seems like it would be easier for these two groups to have a loose alliance or truce.  Maybe that's out of my ignorance.
syriancivilwar,3cs7on,mk262,3,Fri Jul 10 13:21:02 2015 UTC,"Both side want to take over the cizire canton. SAA to keep the image of being the  government over all syria, while YPG want to unify the canton under there rule. These two different ideals will eventually clash. The only thing preventing a war was ISIS. But right now the YPG are thinking about taking the city Hasaka from the SAA and ISIS. But it would be risky."

syriancivilwar,3cs7on,Trailmagic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:01:57 2015 UTC,YPG and SAA aren't friends. They're enemies with an extremely shaky truce. YPG has the right to do whatever they want to bolster the position against the SAA and vice versa. It's just that the SAA has no power to negotiate in that region anymore.

syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,Rebel44CZ,3,Fri Jul 10 16:14:29 2015 UTC,Plus their main benefactor so far is the USA and working with Assad is something the USA really doesn't like. Why risk turning everyone against you for a promise of autonomy that you already know you'll have?
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,hmunkey,5,Fri Jul 10 21:27:12 2015 UTC,"Publicly reconciling with the YPG would incense Erdogan and likely increase Turkish efforts against the regime, so I don't see him doing that. The battle lines are clear - his best hope is to play factions against each other and avoid losing more men and material, concentrating on the core regime areas. With luck, Euphrates Valley will eventually take Raqqa and the pressure will diminish in the east, so if the stalemate in Idlib-Latakia and Daraa holds Assad will have a defensible position preserving with some strategic depth Damascus and the coastal Alawi area."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,commentingrobot,2,Fri Jul 10 15:55:37 2015 UTC,"Now what happens if the lines in Northern Latakia suddenly crumble like they did in Iblib..Could that not change things very quickly? I notice some areas of Latakia are already in Rebel hands, this would seen like a bigger worry than Daraa wouldn't it?"
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,commentingrobot,3,Fri Jul 10 16:00:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would, but a similar collapse in Daraa would also be devastating if Damascus were to be threatened. A sense of normalcy in the capital is important to the regime."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,IceZG,0,Fri Jul 10 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if rebels take Damascus or Latakia the war is over. They don't have to take both. Collaps of either Latakia or Damascus would mean that regime loyalists would be running for their lives."

syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,FoolEskimo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"Hasakah's pretty isolated so the regime can't easily move those troops to bolster other fronts.

syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,IceZG,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"The Syrian governments long term goal is to regain control over the entire country. Maintaining control over its areas of influence in Qimishli, Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor is key to that."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,iidduunnoo,-2,Sat Jul 11 01:57:16 2015 UTC,"It would end the war more or less, without Latakia Assad would run out of soldier very quickly. 80% of pilots are Alawites so I think it is safe to say that 80% of infantry are non-Sunnis also. There are satelite pictures which show graveyards getting bigger and bigger in Latakia which just shows how much of Assad's casulties come from that region.  Without Latakia it would be just dumb to keep on fighting. Assad's plan was to connect Damascus, Homs and Hama with Latakia but that plan is failing. So without Latakia Damascus doesn't matter."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,WendellSchadenfreude,3,Fri Jul 10 17:23:10 2015 UTC,why is it failing ? i dont see latakia or damascus fall in the near future.
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,Archele2,3,Fri Jul 10 21:06:10 2015 UTC,"so I think it is safe to say that 80% of infantry are non-Sunnis also   The ethno-religious makeup of regular army units certainly isn't the same as that of some elite units.  When the civil war started, most regular soldiers in the SAA were Sunnis, although most of the officers and elite units were Alawites. The defections (that occured almost exclusively among Sunnis) changed that composition somewhat, but there certainly still are more than 20% Sunnis in the army."

syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,the_red_wheelbarrow,7,Fri Jul 10 22:21:19 2015 UTC,"Not really. The kurds have a long history of being under the yoke of baathist dictators, and the regime really has very little to offer the kurds.  There are parts of the opposition who might strike a deal with parts of the government forces, if, say, the Assads where to go into exile in Iran, in return for loyalists maintaining control of Tartous, Latakia and parts of Damascus. But it really seems very far fetched that a common ground can be reached."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,TheGreatAte,6,Fri Jul 10 21:09:26 2015 UTC,"Even if he does offer genuine concessions, the other parties in the war won't take them due to Assad's terrible track record of conceding political power. Anyone who thinks that Assad will seriously reform Syria when he's President is naive."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,Luakey,10,Fri Jul 10 16:46:43 2015 UTC,"The truce arrangements made in many of the Damascus suburbs is the model which will eventually resolve this war. Ceasefires, the entry of humanitarian aid, and acceptance of national sovereignty (the flag, SAA soldiers patrolling etc.) in exchange for local reconciliation committees (liasing with the state) assuming responsibility for administering these districts. This model can be applied to any city in Syria."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,Rebel44CZ,13,Fri Jul 10 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"This model can be applied to  any city in Syria.   No, definitely not. These are capitulations not a model of flexible compromise. Every truce in Damascus was a product of years long siege - constant bombardment and a blockade of food and medical supplies. When they started the truce in Harasta the first thing the government did was throw a feast and broadcast it on SANA. A pretty clear indication of the rebels motivations for accepting it and a carrot for other rebels in similar situations. Its pretty telling that these 'reconciliation' agreements have only worked in cities the regime has bombed and starved into submission.  And why would the SF and the Islamist coalitions in Aleppo and Idlib allow SAA soldiers into their towns and fly the Syrian flag when they have just now gained a military advantage? In fact both of them have started recent efforts to set up new systems of governance alternate to the regime. There's not the slightest indication that this system would work in every city and most of the Islamic groups have shown again and again that they would rather fight to the death than accept a loser's truce. Forcing every city into what amounts to a surrender agreement would be a total military victory not a true diplomatic process with a long-term political solution. And the way things are going it doesn't even look like the regime will ever be able to achieve a military victory over every city in Syria."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,kamikazegas,9,Fri Jul 10 18:06:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is that such a model requires significant coercion that comes from a government siege. Otherwise residents would be unwilling to accept the arbitrary regime violations of truce agreements, such as random roundups/arrests, forbidding family members access, and withholding food/medical aid. Even in besieged areas, truces have still broken down."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,IceZG,10,Fri Jul 10 16:19:04 2015 UTC,"Regime broke too many of those agreements, for them to be a reallistic option, especially after regime forces lost initiative on the battlefield."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,the_red_wheelbarrow,2,Fri Jul 10 16:20:07 2015 UTC,"rebels broke as many agreements too even though it was best they didnt due to their situation. Now imagine those rebels had the upper hand, they would break any agreement daily. And those Islamist reebels dont even allow such ceasefire/agreement to besieged Shiite towns in idlib."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,TheGreatAte,2,Sat Jul 11 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"No, rebels clearly said that they will fight until Assad is history. If you think that Assad will survive this you are dreaming.  Reconciliation commitees - yeah righ, keep on dreaming. SAA soldiers patrolling the streets - wow, just, wow. That's beyond dreaming that's just lack of basic knowledge. SAA soldiers are mostly Alawites. Please explain how mostly Sunni population would accept that?"
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,IceZG,7,Fri Jul 10 17:31:39 2015 UTC,There is no prospect of a united Syria without negotiations. The rebels will accept that eventually.
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,the_red_wheelbarrow,4,Fri Jul 10 17:52:12 2015 UTC,Most of the rebels don't care about a united Syria. The Islamists in the North have no intentions of coming to an agreement with the regime and would much rather control a de facto state. The only way the Syrian state will be maintained is if Assad defeats the rebels militarily and that's not a true diplomatic solution. Aleppo and Idlib will never return to the fold unless the regime forces a surrender there.

syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,pfunkmort,3,Fri Jul 10 23:14:24 2015 UTC,"I would not consider him to be the least worst option anyway but I can understand why people do. What I think they miss is that a regime victory is not a solution to the problems in the regime's governance and Syrian society (which have been massively exacerbated by the conflict) that led to this mess in the first place. The cause of the mayhem cannot also be the solution to it - that would simply guarantee that the fighting erupts again at some stage in the future. The only way that might not be the case would be significant reform but that simply wouldn't happen if the regime wins - instead we will have death camps and midnight knocks.  Having a minority ruling a majority is inherently unstable and a guarantee of further anguish to come. For better or for worst the vile, despicable shits need to be sent to the dustbin of history or else we will just be right back here a little down the line."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,IceZG,3,Fri Jul 10 19:08:03 2015 UTC,The cause of the mayhem cannot also be the solution to it   Well said
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,Nycklar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:03 2015 UTC,"Virtually all people who come into power view their newfound control as an affirmation of a mandate or ideology. Someone like Assad, who has defined the narrative of war inside Syria in such black and white, authoritarian terms would almost definitely view his success in retaining power as an affirmation of his supremacy there - there would be a lot of bloodletting. Much of it might be quiet, or institutionalized bloodletting, but it would be there just the same.  While I'd agree that much of the opposition in Syria is radical and unreasonable, much of that is a function of neglect from the international community and a power vacuum which has seen interested regional players all find horses to back. Regardless, given the equivalent dangers of empowering and validating the various fringe elements in Syria, and my own personal experience here in the U.S., I have to say - I don't think many people in the West view Assad as anything else than a despot who's ticket has been punched."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,IceZG,-2,Sat Jul 11 04:00:19 2015 UTC,"Why can't you see that he is the reason this war started in the first place?  IS is mostly his creation, during Iraq war most of Saddam's officers found protection in Syria where they quietly planned IS.  Not only that we are talking about a guy who supports Hezbollah.  You say he protects minorities? What makes you so shure that rebels will kill minorities? They have no problems with the Kurds, they don't attack areas where Druze live, hell Druze are closer to rebels than they are to Assad. Christians? Most of christians left long time ago. And why would FSA kill Christians, to piss of US or EU? They would get bombed the second they tried that. Also I am Christian, but if any Christian fights for Assad he is no better than Assad.  You know who oppressed people Assad. His father ethnically clensed Jews from Syria. Kurds, he was no better to Kurds than Saddam was. In 1962 120,000 Kurds lost Syrian citizenship because Assad's father felt that there were too many of them. Syria also sent planes and 6000 soldiers to help Saddam fight them. Also I won't even talk about treatment of Sunnis by Assad regime.  So in short you say that Assad's regime a regime that already killed Jews, Kurds and Sunnis is a better choice than FSA a group of people that want democracy and did nothing bad to minorities like Kurds or Druze,?"
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,Nycklar,3,Fri Jul 10 19:00:33 2015 UTC,Do you consider FSA the only rebels in this conflict? What are the islamists factions then?
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,inevitablelizard,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"No, never said that FSA are the only rebels. Extremists like Nusra would have never showed up in Syria if elections happened when protestors demanded them.   Extremists always show up in every conflict sooner or later.   I believe that moderate rebels will be able to handle them when the time comes. Nusra got bombed out of nowhere by US few weeks ago. No statements were made, it was just a message: The message was behave or we will put you on our bombing list.  Plus Nusra understands extremism is no longer a good idea. I see them transforming into right wing political party in future Syria, and I said right wing not extremist right wing. They know that they will need Uncle Sam's help to rebuild Syria, and it is always better to cooperate with Uncle Sam than it is to get bombed by Uncle Sam."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,the_red_wheelbarrow,2,Fri Jul 10 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"Well then your response makes little sense as you start by talking about rebels but to then switch to just FSA. While both you and I know that FSA only holds some power in the south of Syria (Southern Front).  Rebels do have problem with minorities. Just watch how Nusra (with the help of other rebelgroups) is behaving against Kurds (Aleppo) and Christians (Aleppo, maaloula, Kesab, Latakia). Druze are not more pro-rebel than pro-government."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,joe_dirty365,2,Fri Jul 10 19:36:37 2015 UTC,What makes you so shure that rebels will kill minorities?   The fact that they already have? Islamist rebels certainly have. And I don't think the relatively secular FSA would be strong enough to rein in Islamists in all of Syria if Assad were to be deposed. You'd have sectarian killings by Islamists acting with impunity. A bit like in Iraq where the government struggles to keep control of Shia militias.
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,SteezyPham,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:49:47 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm not trying to negate Assad's flaws. He might even be (as you say) the factor behind the rise of IS, even if that's debatable. But right now I cannot see a solution which doesn't involve him. Who are the alternatives? The National Council in Turkey are a bunch of out-of-touch intellectuals. The majority of FSA brigades are criminals. JaN are a murderous al-Qaeda affiliate.   I don't believe that the Syrian people support any of the above. I don't believe they support Assad, either, but there will be a transitional phase from Ba'athist Syria to a pluralistic democratic society. That transitional phase requires the elimination of terror groups from Syria - not just IS, but also JaN. And the best person to preside over that is Bashar al-Assad."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,joe_dirty365,4,Fri Jul 10 19:26:39 2015 UTC,Assad does not have to preside over anything. He just needs to step down and hand power over to a transitional government. Syrians will continue to suffer until he does this imo (and long afterwards as well).
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,KuthUwe5,0,Fri Jul 10 21:08:18 2015 UTC,Most syrian's support Assad. Otherwise he would of lost the war by now.

I know that your country isn't big on democracy, but dictatorships (including communism) always lead to revolts.  Read about Assad's father and you will learn why Sunnis hate him and his son.   Revolution was started by local people. You know why? Well because one in four Syrians was unemployed. Others were very poor working mostly in agriculture. People were sick of Assad spending every penny Syria had on weapons, and luxurious life of his family and people close to them. Protestors just wanted free elections - that's when Assad started shooting. Five years later here we are protestors are now fighters.  Number of foreign fighters in Syria doesn't mean anything, they  mostly join IS anyway not the FSA."

I did not just come to Reddit today and say ""Hey lets' start a topic"" you're delusional if you think that minorites will be safe after Assad is gone..There is a reason why the Kurds are reluctant to fight the SAA and why the Druze, Christian and Shia militia's are fighting with the Government."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,HardcoreBaathist,5,Fri Jul 10 17:42:53 2015 UTC,"Kurds - On 23 August 1962, the government conducted a special population census only for the province of Jazira, which was predominantly Kurdish. As a result, around 120,000 Kurds in Jazira (20% of Syrian Kurds) were stripped of their Syrian citizenship. In fact, the inhabitants had Syrian identity cards and were told to hand them over to the administration for renewal. However, many of those Kurds who submitted their cards received nothing in return. Many were arbitrarily categorized as ajanib ('aliens'), while others who did not participate in the census were categorised as maktumin ('unregistered'), an even lower status than the ajanib; for all intents and purposes, these unregistered Kurds did not exist in the eyes of the state.   They could not get jobs, become educated, own property, participate in politics, or even get married. In some cases, classifications varied even within Kurdish families: parents had citizenship but not their children, a child could be a citizen but nor his or her brothers and sisters. Those Kurds who lost their citizenship were often dispossessed of their lands, which were given by the state to Arab settlers.  Assad's father also helped Saddam in his little genocide of Kurds by supplying planes and 6000 SAA troops.  YEAH, KURDS LOVE ASSAD.  Druze? Lol, Assad tried to take away weapons from Druze areas because he doesn't trust them. Druze are closer to joining FSA than Assad.   Oh, and do you know what happened to Jews in Syria? Yup, they got ethnically clensed by Assad's father long time ago.  And what makes you so sure that FSA will kill Christians?"

A deal needs to be made between Assad and the puppet oppositions, or rather the masters behind it.  the only way this war ends is when a deal between Assad the oppositions' masters in Turkey and America are made, who will then force the wahabi states to stop the aid to terrorists.  Then SAA can consolidate and destroy the fighting opposition on the ground. Obviously it will take years, but since they dont negotiate, they need to suffer a few defeats before we can isolate them to some of their terror villages where they can be left to live how they want without disturbing the rest of Syria."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,HardcoreBaathist,3,Sat Jul 11 04:23:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your opinion, and sorry about the typo in the title of this thread. The thing is that Assad doesn't really have years, I'd give him about 2 at most to turn the tide, because in 2 years the rebels will have either made huge gains and taken Daraa, Aleppo etc or the Government would have pushed them back, no way it stays the same though. Just see his time as running out...And I am entirely for a Secular Syria, might not be the best option but it's better than Sharia."
syriancivilwar,3ct4ui,Balak_Jewboma,0,Fri Jul 10 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"Daraa and Aleppo will be liberated before year's end. Rebels already made gains in both Daraa city and Aleppo. Daraa and Aleppo will be liberated no question about that, question is will rebels be able to take Hama and Latakia. That's the real question.  On other side Assad is unable to take Zabadani, a small village surrounded by SAA for over a year. He's been attacking it for over a week (It is close to Lebanon, so he has a massive support from Hezbollah, he also sent Afgan and Iraqi mercenaries, plus he bombed the village over 40 times.), do you know what rebels did in one week they took Idlib city. So rebels took Idlib and god knows how many villages in one month while Assad can't take one village with Hezbollah helping and you still think he will win."

IS, JaN, and other Sharia groups have murdered Americans and shown themselves to be even worse than Assad could ever be. The FSA is a coalition of armies and I view it as a hydra not to be trusted. The Kurds won't go all the way to Damascus and run Syria, they just want to protect Kurdish lands. With this in mind, only 2 outcomes to the war can happen without negotiation. The first is FSA rolling into Damascus and imposing a new government, ousting and maybe executing Assad if they catch him. Former SAA would flee the country. In this situation, IS hasn't been dealt with and the FSA wouldn't have the manpower to fight it, causing more drawn out civil war. The alternative to this is that IS rolls into Damascus, and imposes their hard core beliefs and puts sleeper cells and traps all over the place. Regime troops and their families are executed, and Alawites could kiss their homelands goodbye. FSA and YPG could hold out perhaps but this is still a drawn out and dismal ending. The way I see it, there are too many problems in this war and negotiating with Assad and fighting together can drive a stake in the heart of the Jihadists. Trust me when I say the last thing IS wants is the other factions in this war to make peace and fight it."

syriancivilwar,3css4u,eisagi,2,Fri Jul 10 19:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yes. Ill intent is less important than breadth of power. Daesh will not take Baghdad, even under a worst-case scenario (in part due to US help). But Iraq will live in a US-influenced world with many of its neighbors being US-allies (hostile to Shias and historically hostile to Iraqis). If Iraq runs into debt trouble, the US-influenced IMF will set its austerity policies. If someone like John McCain gets elected, for which there is a greater than zero chance, the US might invade Iran and drive the region further into the ground. I don't think the latter will happen, but if I were an illiterate Iraqi I'd reasonably be afraid of such a scenario."

Jeb Bush is already surrounding himself with Dubya advisers. Who knows what they'd do. Hillary Clinton promises to be Israel's best friend and has had very hawkish statements on Iran in the past.

syriancivilwar,3css4u,lostpatrol,5,Sun Jul 12 11:24:59 2015 UTC,"Prior to the Shi'a insurrection, the US sure as shit wasn't causing tons of harm to the Shi'a of Iraq.   There was a previous insurrection, the 1991 Sha'aban Intifada, by Shia and Kurds against Saddam Hussein. After the 1st Gulf War, US encouraged an uprising against Saddam. Bush the 1st said things like:   There is another way for the bloodshed to stop: and that is, for the Iraqi military and the Iraqi people to take matters into their own hands and force Saddam Hussein, the dictator, to step aside and then comply with the United Nations' resolutions and rejoin the family of peace-loving nations.    The CIA funded, Voice of Free Iraq radio station also beamed in messages of encouragement like:   Rise to save the homeland from the clutches of dictatorship   One month later, they did rise up, both Shia in the south and Kurds in the North. US of course did nothing after encouraging it and watched as at least 80,000 were slaughtered.  Also the claim that the US wasn't ""causing tons of harm to the Shia of Iraq"" ignores the half a million children UNICEF claims died due to sanctions."
syriancivilwar,3css4u,gonzolegend,2,Fri Jul 10 20:00:37 2015 UTC,Do you think this is the main reason why the Shia have always been pretty hostile?  Do you think if Bush had invaded in 2003 without the prior history of false promises not being kept they would have reacted differently?
syriancivilwar,3css4u,al_assad,2,Fri Jul 10 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"Probably explains why the Shia in Iraq were hostile. During and after the 1991 crackdown, it was Iran that got into Shia society in Iraq, SCIRI, Badr Brigades, Dawa, all them were the main factions in 1991 and won the loyalty of the Shia people. After 2003 they were the main players and they disliked and didn't trust the US at all.    Do you think if Bush had invaded in 2003 without the prior history of false promises not being kept they would have reacted differently?   Something thats forgotten a lot is that Iran offered to help the US in Iraq before 2003. They sent diplomatic messages through the P5+1 group (the Permenant Five UN Security Council members + Germany)  offering cooperation against Saddam and were refused, then Bush made his Axis of Evil speech naming Iran.   My view is that Iran's stance in Iraq was just defense. Iran was surrounded by US troops in Afghanistan to the East, and US troops in Iraq to the West and had a President (Bush) who was open about Iran being next on the list. Qassem Soleimani was sent into Iraq with one mission, keep the US bogged down in Iraq so they don't have the resources to invade Iran.   If Iraq had been a quick and easy victory for the US, they would have gone for Iran."
syriancivilwar,3css4u,gonzolegend,3,Fri Jul 10 20:57:02 2015 UTC,So let me get this straight. Fire and foremost is bad for the United States to support Israel (thats a given). But it would have been good for the United States to have intervened in 1991 but not get involved in 2003. But it would be bad for the United States to become involved in Syria (unless it was on the pro-Assad side of course). The opposition says that the United States is giving enough aid and the pro-Assad folks say that the United States is practically giving TOW missiles to Al-Qaeda. But then again ISIS was a creation of the CIA and as we all know the CIA is really the mastermind behind world politics.   Middle East logic. Can't please everyone so you might as well look after your own interests. I can tell you one thing for sure...a Western audience has a higher opinion of Shia Islam than Sunni Islam. Some elements within Sunni community (specifically Islamists) have radicalized to the point where simply allowing them to exist and proliferate is going to be shooting ourselves in the foot. But then again the Assad regime has consistently taken a hostile stance towards American foreign policy in the region. The American government simply cannot win in their regional policy.
syriancivilwar,3css4u,Sweendog024,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:00:07 2015 UTC,"You make a good point. I agree with the logic. I would take Robert Fisk's stance on the issue, he has written that from living in the middle east close to 40 years he thinks almost all the inhabitants want (whether Sunni or Shia) is for the US to stop meddling in their affairs.   After all doubt the US would like if the EU or China was destablizing America, funding cartels or extremists militias, occassionally bombing one state in the union or another, installing radical Presidents to power, or crippling their economies with sanctions and bombs.   Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Revolutionary Iran, Muslim Brotherhood, Anti-Amerian Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia, even the Arab Spring youth. What all these have in common is opposition to US attempts to dominate the region. Let the people rule their own region. Any attempts to interfere in another civilisation is Imperialism.   Can still deal with the Middle East. Conduct trade, have diplomatic links. But this attempt to promote ""American interests"" in the Middle East is the definition of Imperialism. You don't see any other country outside the Middle East acting in this way. Switzerland doesn't support coups in Egypt to further ""Swiss interests"", China doesn't send the PLA into 10 year occupations naming ""Chinese National Security"" as the justification."

And then they will hate them for invading their nations and killing muslims or not doing enough and not killing enough Muslims (Syria), there's no winning, the best policy the US can have is to ignore them and really let them handle things."

But - the negative view of Turkey is logical due to its openly-declared overall alignment in this conflict. Turkey is definitely on the side of the FSA/Islamic Front/Jaish al-Fatah/etc., because they want to overthrow Assad/pro-Iranian Syria and whatever government or governments follow will be far more amenable to Turkish influence. As far as Turkey is a NATO member (and not just a Sunni country), it's also interested in reducing Iranian/Shia power... Turkey is also very openly against the YPG and is more vocal about denying them a state than it is about denying Daesh a state. Would you dispute that Turkey is aligned thus? If so, then even if it's somewhat against Daesh and acting against them, the supporters of SAA and YPG are still reasonable to call Turkey their enemy in this fight.  Also, it's probably not so much Turkey as it is Sunni-Islamist-friendly/regional imperialist AKP. Perhaps the pro-Kemalist/secularist members of the military/police are the ones making the efforts against IS, while the AKP is pushing for whatever destroys the SAA and the YPG. So I'm sorry - but your previous post is a strawman in the face of the overall pattern of the conflict."

Have to admit the rebels and JAN have shown Hezbollah is nothing more than a terrorist type group. If they are not dressed up as israeli soldiers, hiding in holes, firing rockets at Israel, hiding behind civilians they are far from elite."
syriancivilwar,3crw5m,dragon_nipples,27,Fri Jul 10 09:50:48 2015 UTC,"This is very similar scenario to Qusayr and the final Homs districts. Hezbollah is especially averse to casualties and is very patient. SAA can be too, especially if they think they can force the enemy into a truce (though that probably won't be the case here)."
syriancivilwar,3crw5m,StPauli,-28,Fri Jul 10 09:54:29 2015 UTC,"... They had overwhelming numbers and firepower in Qusayr, and Homs. That SAA barely exists anymore and the rebels have become vastly superior.  If its taking them this long to do this, they better stick to the border.  How the rebels took Idlib, that's how you win a battle."
syriancivilwar,3crw5m,dragon_nipples,14,Fri Jul 10 11:36:28 2015 UTC,"These are two very different battles, Idlib was about pushing the Government forces out of the province down the M4.

syriancivilwar,3crw5m,umakemefunny,3,Fri Jul 10 14:08:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending the govt's atrocities against the protesters. Arms were transferred to already-existing Islamists via Turkey & Jordan. Syria is an extremely sensitive region, with active Jordanian salafists and Sunni Islamists who actually fought ISF and bombs civilians surrounding it. Just like how Zarqawi's JTJ swooped in to occupy the power vaccum when US kicked Saddam out, Islamists from both countries would jump up if Assad was forced out.  Leaked US cables make it clear that US knew fully well the insurgency was dominated by wahhabi types and ISIS would emerge. US govt and NGOs actively supported and encouraged the protests which eventually led to this. US isn't run by idiots. They knew something like this would happen, yet they continued to fuel the fire. Plus France, if you recall, was unnaturally opposed to Assad. Idk why. (They also did that in Libya) Also the UK. So, calling it a ""western invasion"" isn't that far from the truth.  KSA and Qatar literally arms and funds jihadi groups. So that's no surprise.  I agree ""zionist conspiracy"" is simply ridiculous.   Well even Americans say  I find it odd that you trust anything the Americans say   He's saying how they (the anti-Iran guys) themselves say Houthis aren't Iranian proxies gives credibility to the notion that they aren't. Similar to how opposition sources on regime gains and pro-govt sources on rebel gains are taken much more seriously than pro-X sources talking about X's gains."

I would argue Saudi Arabia's actions in Syria is of far bigger 'service' to Israel.    He said the question must be asked why this “complete enmity” is being directed at Iran and not against Arab countries. Because, he said, Israel realized that Arab officials do nothing for the nation of Palestine and Gaza, “a part of the Islamic Umma.”   He's not wrong, although I would argue that Israel's tacit alliance with the Arabs of the Gulf and Jordan has little to anything to do with Palestine."

He can probably still attend gatherings (Eid prayer or festivities) to socialize with Muslims if he still feels that he's Muslim and it's unlikely anyone will ask him what he really thinks about the religion. Also the ""deserves death"" part is reserved to appointed judges who have to do extensive research on the person's behavior and beliefs before reaching that conclusion. Any half decent Muslim wouldn't allow themselves to jump to ""RENEGADE DESERVES DEATH"" even if they thought ones action were apostasy, instead they would simply say ""May Allah guide you"" to the person's face or in prayer and move on with their lives."

Assyrians do not want a ""Christian state"" they'd want an Assyrian state which unfortunately is never going to happen as Kurdistan sits on top of it.  Arabs Christians on the other hand are the epitome of Syrian Nationalists.

The last thing anyone in the Middle East or Africa needs is more external powers trying to dictate or influence the borders of states or groups of people.  It's one thing if a particular group of people ask for assistance in having the ability for self determination but it's quite another for people external to discuss it.    The question should really be framed for non Syrians as if a group of people within the current borders of Syria demand the right to exist separate from Syria should that be supported.  Self determination is a right, it's not self determination if a power discusses imposing it upon you."
syriancivilwar,3cvnbs,Vladamiur,3,Sat Jul 11 04:36:23 2015 UTC,"People keep debating the division of Syria without asking actual Syrians what they want. The only way it'll work in the long-term is if it actually reflects the opinions of the people, or else you'll just have another dysfunctional Lebanon on your hands if sects who dislike each other are forced to stay together, or potentially an Armenian-Azerbaijan style protracted conflict in which ethnic/nationalist/religious groups are bitterly divided.  Obviously, given the situation in Syria and the sheer amount of refugees, actually surveying Syrians would be an extremely difficult task, let alone the impossibility of implementing a solution. That's why the civil war is so depressing; the present circumstances are creating devastation and chaos, but there is no sign for a better future in the making.

It will become like european paganism, it will survive in books, some guys will say they are pagans but for all reasons it doesn't exist anymore.  When people say you can't wipe out an ideology they mean you can't kill a bunch of militants to defeat an ideology because they will keep recruiting from the main population, like in Vietnam, americans killed 1 million vietcong/nva but they kept coming. If they had killed every damn vietnamese they would have won though, of course they cannot do that for political/moral reasons.

What you're describing are the radical fringe of the far right known as ""Price Tag"", i.e. groups of radicalized settler youths affiliated with 3 or 4 extremist Yeshivas in the West Bank. The entire broader population they belong to, the Religious Zionists, represent less than 10% of Israeli society and of those less than half are on the far right.  So even if we took a maximalist definition of the support base for the Price Tag attacks it's 5% of Israeli society. In reality it's probably less than 1% because the entire leadership of the religious right is vocally opposed to these abuses and as far as communities go the Religious Zionists are highly prone to following centralised authority."

syriancivilwar,3crhp5,sloft__,0,Fri Jul 10 12:59:02 2015 UTC,"Well actually, the western antisemitism sort of developed from the Christian antijudaism, which in fact was (and partially still is) blaming the Jews for the death of Jesus. Quoting wikipedia:   They take Jesus to Pilate's Court, but Pilate proves extremely reluctant to condemn Jesus, so it is the Jewish elders who are to blame for Jesus' crucifixion. The Jewish elders ask the Roman governor Pontius Pilate to judge and condemn Jesus, accusing him of claiming to be the King of the Jews.   So while technically they didn't kill him, they were made responsible for his death by Christians.  Edit: spelling"
syriancivilwar,3crhp5,Peter__Enis,2,Fri Jul 10 13:01:19 2015 UTC,"Bullshit - anti semitism is the racism of choice for the feckless, talentless , lazy and stupid - people hate Jews because they've achieved so much in spite of having more discrimination than most other peoples in history.

It was in terms of religion, which was a dominant identity.  By the 19th century the ideology of religious toleration won out in Europe after the horrors of Catholic-Protestant wars and the Enlightenment. So people who hated Jews re-invented themselves as racists (coining the term ""Anti-Semite""), which was a respectable position in times of colonialism and imperialism."

And ""Aggressors"", we coptics have never, not once, ever committed acts of aggression against our neighbors in any organized fashion, no matter how much shit we have been put through, so keep that in mind before accusing us of being aggressors.  But tell me, in your opinion have the Iraqi christian community faced any sort of oppression or have they faced any sort of plight.

This is what many western people actually think, and simplifies to war-mongering against muslims.  Edit: I'm not denying the plight of the minority, as the minority is always the victim of one thing or the other, but my response is to the article, and to the pope's claims."
syriancivilwar,3crhp5,blitzer2000,3,Fri Jul 10 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"Well if the Pope said that Christians are they main victims of this war, then I agree that is not true. There are many victims, and the Christians are just one group among them.   But the destruction of the Iraqi christian  community is relatively recent, and in total numbers is a insanely high figure.

syriancivilwar,3crhp5,blitzer2000,2,Fri Jul 10 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"Do you know why destabilization is something we minorities fear above all? It's because the floodgates for all those Jihadis is open, they can act with impunity, Killing, kidnapping, extortion, rape, mob violence, etc.   Seriously, who do you think turned on the minorities of Mosul, whether Yezidi, Christian, Mandean, etc. Go read one of the thousands of accounts where they describe, how their very neighbors, work colleagues, ""friends"",  turned on them and their community and left them to literally die. It's harrowing and honestly terrifying to people like us to hear about how easy it was for so many to turn on their brothers in Blood and Nation like that.  And I agree that it is probably easier for christians to get refugee status, but man, when 75% of a community or more is gone within a decade, that is so disproportionally huge that you have to recognize something is making these people leave like their lives depend on it.

The prophet and early Muslims, from what we know from Sunnah, had plain white flag as a ""big"" flag (called liwa'), and little black flags as standards (called rayat) among troops. However, it's also mentioned that the prophet used a yellow flag as well. Moreover, some of his generals requested to allow them to use red or green flags for their troops. To the best of my knowledge, none of them featured any writings or pictures, and the black standard was not rectangular. So, in a way it's not very Islamic of our modern Salafis to decorate their standards with calligraphy, swords, and stuff."
syriancivilwar,3cplmh,zandaq,16,Thu Jul 9 20:53:03 2015 UTC,"You also have to put into account that depends on whom you consider the greatest Muslim Caliphate Dynasty, you will style your flag accordingly. Iraqis are very fond of the Abassid Dynasty because for all intents and purposes especially with its capital of Baghdad it is considered an Iraqi centric Dynasty and thus the Black Flag of the Abassids to Iraqi Sunnis is more appealing, and more honour inducing in their collective memory.   While in KSA's point of view, the Umayyad is considered greater than Abassid, and the Umayyads used a green flag as their own, and hence why KSA which considers itself the unofficial spiritual successor of the Umayyad Dynasty, and hence why the colour green was adopted to further this belief. Of course Shias consider the Ummayad Dynasty heretical, and KSA's position on Umayyad will lead to a natural clash of mentality. Also why Shias use the derogatory term (Yazidis) on Saudi-allied Sunnis.   The Yellow flag was that of the Fatimid, a Shia Dynasty in Egypt that Shias remember fondly, hence the use of the Yellow Flag in multiple Shia group flags. Although officially the Fatimid carried a Green flag and a White flag in opposition to the Abassid's Black flag, their Yellow battle flag is what was ingraned in the general consciousness, the Yellow battle flag which would later become the flag of the Ayubid Dynasty. Since the Ayubid was in essence a military coup de ta against the Fatimid, so they adopted the military colours.    So currently in the Middle East you can think of all the previous Dynasties' successor duking it out between themselves."

syriancivilwar,3cplmh,Mosamania,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:12:42 2015 UTC,The majority of Shia associate green with Ahlul-Albayt not with the Ummyads and it's generally a well liked colour. The Fatamids are more or less inconsequential to the majority of Shia living today (doesn't hold the same significance to 12ers as it does to 7ers) and in all honesty I don't think that Hezbollah yellow colour is because of them.

syriancivilwar,3cplmh,monopixel,13,Fri Jul 10 06:09:20 2015 UTC,"There are Hadith about black flags, and sayings from companions. It is important to note that in a sermon one Friday, the prophet related all fitnas that would occur through time, some the companions remembered, some were forgotten.   Nuaym ibn Hammad related that Ali bin abi Talib said ""When you see the black flags, remain where you are and do not move your hands or your feet. Thereafter shall appear a feeble insignificant people. Their hearts will be like fragments of iron. They will have the state. They will fulfill neither covenant nor agreement. They will call to the truth, but they will not be people of the truth. Their names will be parental attributions (meaning abu so and so), and their aliases will be derived from towns (meaning al mosuli, al baghdadi, al amreeki etc) their hair will be free flowing like that of women. This situation will remain until they differ among themselves. Thereafter, God will bring forth the truth through whomever he wills""    Nuaym ibn Hammad was a teacher of the renowned Hadith collector, al Bukhari. This Hadith is found in ""kitab al fitan"", a collection of hadiths related to fitnas that were collected by ibn Hammad.  Just thought I would show black flags are not always seen as good."
syriancivilwar,3cplmh,Herefordiscussion2,8,Fri Jul 10 08:26:59 2015 UTC,"Edit: Wall of text, sorry about that  Ah this is a discussion of the science behind hadith, it is lengthy and sometimes tough to follow but I will try my best to make it concise.  Firstly, a hadith is of two parts, a matn (a saying taken from the prophet peace be upon him, the actual text of a hadith), and an isnad (a line of transmission of that hadith).   When a muhaddith or a faqih says a hadith is weak, da'if, it is not in regards to the matn, but rather it is in regards to the line of transmission. No learned person in his right mind would balk at the matn of a hadith, regardless of its strength (unless outright fabricated as a lie), as the matn very well could be words of the prophet peace be upon him, after all weak does not mean fabricated or false, it means this is a news from the prophet though the isnad may be weak. nothing more and nothing less, in and of itself.   Times when a hadith with weak or ok isnad can be supported as true; this depends on madhab to madhab, but for the most part for fiqh issues if there are multiple ""weak"" or ""ok"" hadiths that come through different routes, though the individual hadiths may not be sahih, it can be purported that yes it can be used as evidence. For example if you say one hadith, then someone you haven't met in a different part of the nation says the same hadith through a different line of transmission and you both are trustworthy, then those hadith can be supported in one form or another though the individual isnad is weak. It takes a mujtahid (one who implements individual juristic reasoning as pertaining to religious evidences) to do this. Imam Abu yusuf in the hanafi school, imam Ghazali in the shafi school, etc. Second, if the salaf were seen doing an act that they said the prophet peace be upon him did, and that act supports 3 (just giving a random number) different hadith that supports that act but has a weak or just ok isnad, then at least for hanafis, is seen as ok evidence, the shafis differ, both are correct, and neither are wrong as contradictory as it may seem (the goal of fiqh isn't subjugation, as is the goal of fiqh of the likes of ISIS, rather it is nearness to God). Likewise in the school of imam malik, if the inhabitants of the city of madina did something a certain way, that takes precedence over a single hadith with a single isnad, even if that isnad is ""sahih"", (though to be honest I don't know much about their madhab, living in America I should know more though) *Edit for impartiality - a lot of this paragraph is from an understanding of the hanafi madhab  The science of hadith and fiqh is not so black and white as if something is sahih or not. Again I reiterate when one says it is a sahih hadith, they are referring to the isnad, not the matn; they are referring to the line of transmission, not necessarily the text or saying of that hadith. The interpretation of that text if the isnad is sahih, then depends on a jurist who can evaluate it in accordance with all other evidences, it is not simply a matter if a hadith is in sahih bukhari or sahih muslim (hadith afterall is just a saying, given in a place and time within a certain context, with a certain emotion and intention behind it; linguists say pure textual words is only 10% of communication; or at least that is what I've read..)  It is tough for people who don't really study, or just aren't bright enough (though imagine if we all used our full potential what we can accomplish) to dive into it; so instead they make up excuses, only following what they've read with their own eyes in sahih bukhari or sahih muslim, to sometimes the exclusion of even the Quran, God protect us. *So difficult it is for them that they disregard the whole idea of the science itself, and invented their own.  As far as this specific hadith goes, I know some dislike it because it only leads back to a saying by Ali ibn abi Talib, the prophets cousin and 4th  khalifa. This is incorrect because the content is regarding a future event, in particular a future fitna within the muslim community, and all sayings regarding future fitn by companions of the prophet originally came from the prophet himself - peace be upon him - and not originating from that companion.   Some scholars had a problem with nuaym ibn hameed and now ISIS members and people who follow their quite stupid fiqh try to quote them to avoid the issue, quite frankly, imam bukhari in his jami sahih narrated from him, so the arguments are not about hadiths but about other things.   3rd- weak doesn't mean fabricated. Sunnis and shias fight a lot over certain sahih hadith that are vague in nature that they both try to imply to themselves, but this hadith is so specific, and so exact, to the point Ali ibn abi talib said the word ""dawla"" (a word not really used at the time to suggest a state is what I've been told) to doubt it would be foolish. Future acts that lend credence to hadith about future events, also improve the hadiths status. and in my opinion, this hadith sounds pretty spot on to me, especially as there is no room for vagueness in it's details. (this hadith was put in a book by a teacher of imam bukhari, not made up on the spot after the advent of ISIS) They say what about the hadiths of ibn abbas regarding black flags. The answer is simple, there is more than one black flag in this world.. The people who disregard this rely on their own reasoning, not religious evidences as traditionally understood..  And in closing ( i kind of wrote a lot more than I originally wanted to) a lot of isis sympathizers will bring an excuse of ""islam being simple, all these sciences aren't needed, we follow the sunnah and nothing else etc etc"". And that is true, it is simple to follow; pray, be respectful, have good manners, give zakat, fast, don't harm people, stay away from major sins of gambling, adultery, etc etc. Scholarship however has never been simple, and the brightest minds dove into it so that we wouldn't have to and could just concentrate on being near to Allah. When you follow a school of thought, you follow literally 10s of thousands of scholars, when you leave it, you end up blindly following just a few (who usually beat everyone to the punch on putting their views on the internet, ISIS and their like are very good at using the internet). If you derive your sunnah from elsewhere (in todays age), it's usually from a blind following of one or two people who quoted a sahih hadith without giving credence to other evidences; and in turn that has become your religion, as opposed to the religion of muhammad ibn abdullah.   To my fellow Muslims regardless of sects, be wary of people who when they speak, speak to more strangers on the internet, than they do people in their own community, look at their lecturers halls, they are empty, yet they upload their talks to the internet to make a name for themselves.  Also I am only a student, so forgive me if I said anything wrong"

Also the Dajjal is the Anti Christ (not sort of). Muslims believe Isa/Christ will be the one to slay him after Mahdi brings back islam to glory and defeats the armies of Kuffar/Dajjal.   Also interesting that many Shia clerics believe that Iran and the Houthis in Yemen are the beginning of the armies who will fight for Mahdi, IS also believe they are too. Both believe it's only a matter of time now.   This is one of the reasons why IS places importance on recruiting groups in Yemen and Afghanistan and attempted to get the Taliban to give Bayiah, because this will be one more piece of the puzzle of legitimacy for IS and is also one of the reason IS attracts so many from all over the world.   Here is a popular hadith that emphasizes on joining the black banners/ army of mahdi.   The Prophet Sallallahu ‘Alaihi Wa Sallam said: ""Before your treasure, three will kill each other -- all of them are sons of a different caliph but none will be the recipient. Then the Black Banners will appear from the East and they will kill you in a way that has never before been done by a nation."" Thawban, a companion said: 'Then he said something that I do not remember by heart' then continued to say that the Prophet, praise and peace be upon him, said: ""If you see him give him your allegiance, even if you have to crawl over ice, because surely he is the Caliph of Allah, the Mahdi. If you see the black flags coming from Khurasan, join that army, even if you have to crawl over ice, for this is the army of the Caliph, the Mahdi and no one can stop that army until it reaches Jerusalem."

The best public information is when governments, local police, or concerned individuals report that a suspect/s have traveled (usually through Turkey) into Syria then to Iraq.   Groups such as Jahbat al-Nusra, Jaysh al-Sham, Islamic Front, and many FSA affiliated groups are comprised of many ethnic Syrians with some foreign elements. Though, the most foreign things about these groups are the money that is funneled to them from gulf states and rich Salafists in the Middle East.

Most of those who join IS come from Russia (16 million muslims in Russia), or from EU countries with muslim population like France, Germany or Sweden.   I don't know much about Asia or Africa but I hear Tunisia exports a lot of fighters (mostly to IS).  Ex US soldiers usually join Kurds because they are unhappy with Obama's weak approach towards IS.

When Syria gained independence in 1945 and the French Mandate ended things took a turn for the worse as the new government dispossessed them from previous existing rights and they fell victim to often violent prosecution. The independence of Israel in 1948 obviously made things even worse for them as being Jewish, they were automatically blamed for being Zionists.  Since that point the community fell apart rather quickly, Jews have fled to Europe, North America and Israel. The were a several thousands that fled to Lebanon right after 1948 and boosted the rather small local Jewish community there, for obvious reasons that community also died out eventually."

How is this a surprise to you? The same is true for pretty much all non-state media in the world.

Can an Arab increase their net worth through religious conversion? Which religious traditions deserve to be shielded from having the light of their knowledge and spiritual disciplines extinguished from our civilizations forever by the all-too-useful-idiots known as the Salafist horde and which ""chosen"" as precious enough to avoid such a fate?

Tl dr; Kurds were semiautonomous, feudal and tribalistic during late ottoman era. Ankara government’s effort to centralize authority caused Koçgiri rebellion, which was started by kurdish nationalists who thought seperation seemed possible with international support , while turkey was being invaded by Allies and irrelevant of oppression. Moving on, in 1925, A guy named Sheikh Said wanted to bring back his beloved Caliph and revive the Islamic Caliphate and rebelled against the state because the situation at the time was so haram. So after the failed rebellion, new oppressive and harsh preemptive measures had been taken also known as ""Şark Islahat Planı"" or ""The East Reform Plan which i don't agree as well. So it is fair to say kurds got oppressed and discriminated because they rebelled, not the opposite. If you want to learn few thing here and there, you can just ask, no need to be annoying.

Strongly confirms my suspicion that the ethnic tension exists among the peoples in general, but that it is the PYD's influence that is in fact stopping it and not nurturing it. The displacement of peoples and incidents are very likely not because of the PYD influence, but despite of it. That's very important to understand."

In Marxism-Leninism, you always have a vanguard party, you always nationalized everything, you always create a bureaucracy.

syriancivilwar,3cqfqx,Watnot,4,Fri Jul 10 00:05:20 2015 UTC,This put a big ass smile on my face. godspeed to iraqi forces.
syriancivilwar,3cqfqx,DickCheneyProfited1b,2,Fri Jul 10 04:42:31 2015 UTC,"The ISF needs to pummel Fallujah for valid tactical & logistical reasoning.  First & foremost, Fallujah has had months upon months to empty itself of the civilians. Baghdad even supplied trucks & vehicles to escort the civilians to other destinations once they reached the outskirts of Fallujah proper. This eliminated a significant chunk of the civilians that couldn't afford relocating.  This means that those who stayed back have dubious loyalty to the state at best & diehards of ISIS at worst.  By pummeling Fallujah for a few weeks to a month before the initial ground invasion, it would encourage those who were hesitant to leave leave.  It would also force ISIS to reroute resources, supplies, & fighters to tackle the destruction, the fires, & unfortunately, the dead. If they didn't, it would rattle the spirits of the inhabitants in their ability to function as a legitimate state.  The dead, ISIS-sympathising civilian may convince his brother & his two uncles to take up arms, but the destruction, mayhem, & carnage would convince his neighbors & complete strangers from other neighborhoods to evacuate. If so-and-so's family's son got killed, who is to say I wouldn't lose a brother or my mother?  Yes, civilians will be lost, but that's an unfortunate consequence to saving tens of thousands more lives, including the lives of the ISF & Hashd fighting for their country."
syriancivilwar,3cqfqx,TITTIES_AND_ASS,2,Fri Jul 10 03:40:32 2015 UTC,As much as it would suck to have some innocent people die most of them who stayed back either were like whatever im gonna yolo it or they supported isis. it was there choice. iraqi troops need to man up and sacrifice some civilian lifes to win back there country or else there gonna end up losing civilians and there country for nothing.
syriancivilwar,3cqfqx,DickCheneyProfited1b,2,Fri Jul 10 04:42:19 2015 UTC,"So many millions of civilians have been killed in the last 100 years by people who thought that their victims were just an ""unfortunate consequence to saving more lives"".  There's a reason why it's against international law.  You can use that reasoning to justify anything.  Even in a practical sense, it's also a simplistic way of looking at outcomes, as it doesn't factor the long term blowback."
syriancivilwar,3cqfqx,3xistentialcrisis,3,Fri Jul 10 05:53:55 2015 UTC,"Just do what the US did in fallujah. Surround the city, drop leaflets and tell all civilians to leave. check everyone who leaves.  Bring in the air, arty, tanks, and a shit load of infantry."

syriancivilwar,3cqf89,Watnot,8,Thu Jul 9 23:07:41 2015 UTC,"It looks like the Americans are again trying to exclude the PMUs from participating in an Iraqi operation even though the tribes in Ramadi have sought the help of the Hashd al Shaabi. This is probably the main reason why Hadi al Ameri is focusing his attention on Fallujah after being denied the chance to advance into Ramadi. As a result it does look theres going to be two separate operations in Anbar, one in Ramadi at the suggestion of the Americans and one in Fallujah led by the Hashd al Shaabi. Although at first it looked like the Iraqi government was going to go with the American plan for Ramadi it does seem they still haven't made their minds up yet, Hashd al Shaabi advances around Fallujah might actually be the impetus that makes up their minds for them."
syriancivilwar,3cqf89,directaction,6,Thu Jul 9 23:59:55 2015 UTC,"I wish Iraq could and would just stop tolerating the U.S.' bullshit. It's ridiculous: Obama is literally playing petty politics with the lives and security of Iraqis, and it's equally disgusting and saddening. Daesh is a cancer and Hashd ash-Sha'bi is capable and highly motivated to fight it, yet falling victim to constant hamstringing by a foreign president actively standing in the way of the destruction of an army of fanatical, intolerant mass murderers running around bleeding an already-beleaguered country -- thanks to that president's predecessor -- he claims to be committed to the safety and prosperity of."
syriancivilwar,3cqf89,IgorForHire,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:56:24 2015 UTC,"the whole reason the Americans want ISF to go after Ramadi is because the longer you wait the more entrenched they become. That means more IEDs which accounts for the majority of deaths. But instead theyre going into their heartland and where theyve been able to prepare with IED factories for nearly a year. This is going to be a long and bloody battle that will take a toll on the Iraqis and may give ISIS the time and ability to Ramadi into another meatgrinder.   In the grand scope of things it doesnt really matter, Fallujah or Ramadi. Just get them out of Anbar. But the decision of which one first may result in thousands of needless casualties on the Iraqis side."
syriancivilwar,3cqf89,directaction,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:53:59 2015 UTC,"It's not as if the U.S. has plans to use Hashd ash-Sha'bi in ar-Ramadi instead, though. This wrangling isn't about the efficiency of the chronological order of operations and the minimizing of friendly casualties -- indeed, the U.S. clearly doesn't even see the majority of Hashd ash-Sha'bi as friendly -- it's about a short-sighted perception of ""Shi'a militias'"" success as a net gain for Iranian power projection and U.S. executive domestic fears that cooperation with ""Iran-backed militias"" will be viewed as acquiescence to an enemy state, and that this will jeopardize Congressional ratification of any nuclear energy treaty (which is a whole other shitshow that merits its own rant).  I have to disagree about the grand scheme -- in my opinion, one more innocent Iraqi death, or any other nationality for that matter, at the hands of the Daesh monster is one too many.*  *EDIT: I may have misinterpreted what you were saying here. I don't necessarily think that Fallujah should be retaken before Ramadi or vice versa, I'm just adamant that the indigenous forces of Iraq, in all their manifestations, should not be interfered with in the securing of their own country and protecting of their own people. It angers me that the U.S. is interfering with them in this manner."
syriancivilwar,3cqf89,Reditski,2,Fri Jul 10 02:02:45 2015 UTC,The real reason behind the opposition to PMU is that a big part of the PMU has killed many American soldiers and fought against both ISF and America in the past. One of them is shiite militia leader Qais Khazali.
syriancivilwar,3cqf89,directaction,0,Fri Jul 10 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"I really don't think this is the case at all. The real reasons, as I see them (or at least some of them), are those I outlined above. The U.S. has cooperated plenty of times in the past with people and groups who were formerly bitter enemies, and even done complete 180s and fostered solid alliances with former enemies, e.g. Vietnam, Angola, etc."
syriancivilwar,3cqf89,Reditski,0,Fri Jul 10 04:46:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah but in those cases, those organization were also read to cooperate with America. That's not the case with the most influential shiite militias inside the PMU. Badr leader Al-Ameri for example even refused to thank the USA for the airstrikes."
syriancivilwar,3cqf89,directaction,2,Fri Jul 10 05:10:44 2015 UTC,"I'll assume you mistyped ""ready to cooperate"". As I stated several times above, I don't think it would take much to get either Iran or the large mostly-Shi'a militias within Hashd ash-Sha'bi to cooperate with the U.S. Iran already cooperated intimately with the U.S. at the dawn of the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, and that occurred amidst a climate in which the U.S. was still either directly funding and arming or at least sharing information with groups, like Jundullah, dedicated to attacking Iranian government buildings and even civilians.   I think it would be fair to forgive Hadi al-Ameri for refusing to thank the U.S. for air strikes (in Tikrit, I assume) given that the U.S. put so much effort into ensuring that the PMU wouldn't be involved in the retaking of Tikrit which, any way you cut it, endangered the mission at the very least, and perhaps even endangered Iraqi lives within a wider scope. Beyond this absurd posturing, there were allegations that the PMU, while basically standing on the sidelines, were victims of friendly fire by American-led fire support."
syriancivilwar,3cqf89,Reditski,2,Fri Jul 10 05:24:48 2015 UTC,"I'll assume you mistyped ""ready to cooperate"".   Yeah, sorry. I hate writing through an Ipad.    As I stated several times above, I don't think it would take much to get either Iran or the large mostly-Shi'a militias within Hashd ash-Sha'bi to cooperate with the U.S.   Like I said before, why would USA cooperate with organizations who want to damage American interests in the long rung?   I think it would be fair to forgive Hadi al-Ameri for refusing to thank the U.S. for air strikes (in Tikrit, I assume) given that the U.S. put so much effort into ensuring that the PMU wouldn't be involved in the retaking of Tikrit which, any way you cut it, endangered the mission at the very least, and perhaps even endangered Iraqi lives within a wider scope.   I think it would not be fair to do that. American airstrikes broke the stall. I think it is very disgraceful from Al-Ameri to downplay American help and act like Americans did not help them.    Beyond this absurd posturing, there were allegations that the PMU, while basically standing on the sidelines, were victims of friendly fire by American-led fire support.   There were also allegations that ISIS was supported by America, according to some militias inside the PMU."
syriancivilwar,3cqf89,directaction,4,Fri Jul 10 05:30:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry. I hate writing through an Ipad.   No worries. You're clearly much more adept than some of the posters we have on this sub who only use their phones and 'uiijk lrnnme sa ifnfi lyhqr ao tyis' and then never bother to edit it so that it actually says something :P   Like I said before, why would USA cooperate with organizations who want to damage American interests in the long rung?   And like I said before, I don't think these organizations are committed to damaging American interests qua American interests, just that some of them are opposed (and to varying degrees) to elements of current American interests as they're being asserted by the U.S. and by American business.   I think it would not be fair to do that. American airstrikes broke the stall. I think it is very disgraceful from Al-Ameri to downplay American help and act like Americans did not help them.   Fair enough, and you're not going to hear me say that American air strikes are doing nothing for the war effort against ISIS. On the other hand, though, I think it's not only disgraceful, but arrogant and even malevolent for the U.S. government to try to force the Iraqi government to refuse the help of a body of militias which the Iraqi government itself organized into that body, and which are well-equipped, well-trained, combat-hardened, and motivated to fight and destroy ISIS. Like I said in my very first comment on this post, Obama is playing politics with the lives and well-being of Iraqis, and displaying some uncanny hubris in telling Iraq that it can't call on the help of its own people or of its neighbor, a natural historic and cultural ally.   There were also allegations that ISIS was supported by America, according to some militias inside the PMU.   Yeah, and I don't give absurd claims like that any more credence than I did the claims back in 2003 that Saddam Hussein was working with Osama Bin Laden, or that Iran is allied with al Qa'ida because they're all irrational moozlim turrists. All of that stuff is nonsense. I don't know whether or not the claims about friendly fire in Tikrit are accurate, but I do know that 1) they were reported at the same time from several different sources 2) while they may be the same kind of bullshit as the claims about the U.S. running ISIS, they're certainly far more likely to be true than the latter. It's not at all outside the realm of possibility that some PMU units, for whatever reason, were struck by U.S. friendly fire in Tikrit and, if they were, I can definitely understand bitterness regarding that on the part of certain PMU commanders, many of whom already experience strained and antagonistic relations with the U.S.  I think we might be exhausting the possibilities of this conversation, and while we've had some decent back-and-forth, and some not-so-great little digs at each other (which I regret), we're repeating ourselves and I think it's pretty plain that we're not going to convince each other of one another's views. If you'd like to talk about some of the finer points I may be willing to do so tomorrow, but I'm not interested in continuing the two of us repeating to each other things we've already iterated and reiterated, and at the very least, I've got to call it a night for now."
syriancivilwar,3cqf89,Nmathmaster123,0,Fri Jul 10 05:58:06 2015 UTC,"I think the PMUs need to be restructured big times, consolidate most of them into one group (like Kata'ib hezbollah) and get rid of fringe militias which are prone to sectarian and terror attacks."

If you'd instead asked me a question about my beliefs or how they affect how I view Hashd ash-Sha'bi and the war against ISIS, or even said something antagonistic but not insulting (e.g. implying there's a contradiction between my anarchism and my support for an organization of hierarchical militias), we might've had an interesting discussion."

No matter what your understanding of ""American interests"" amounts to, revolutionary Shi'a politics and Shi'a paramilitaries are significantly less of a threat than is ISIS.

By contrast, both the Islamic Republic of Iran and any liberal democracy governed in whole or in part by Shi'a political groups (e.g. Iraq, Lebanon, a theoretical future Bahrain or Yemen) are perfectly capable of cooperating with the U.S. and even of being U.S. allies, and all are ""rational actors"" in the common Western understanding of the term, and recognize the benefits of regional peace and stability.

I'm saying that the IRI would potentially be an American ally if there was a deliberate attempt by the U.S. and the West more generally to make this happen.

That fact taken alone, as you've posed it, isn't evidence that opposition to the United States is a fundamental part of the identity of any Iraqi Shi'a paramilitary group.

I'm not a fan of their slogan (especially the ""al-la3na 3la al-yahoud"" bit, which I read as an unfortunate and ill-conceived statement against political Zionism rather than religious and/or ethnic Judaism), but I can understand why they're aligned against the U.S. right now -- if we take nothing else into consideration, Saudi Arabia is very clearly an enemy of the Houthis and some might even go so far as to say an enemy of all Shi'a globally, and the U.S. keeps the Saudi monarchy flush and well-armed, enabling it with weapons and diplomatic cover to carpet bomb Shi'a areas in Yemen with a callous disregard for human lives at best.    But that is an utopia and very unrealistic.   But we weren't talking about what is likely to happen or is going to happen. You claimed that ""some"" of the ""Shi'a militias"", as well as Iran, are fundamentally opposed to amicable relations with the United States and thus are not capable of being anything other than anti-American antagonists. I responded by stating my belief that if U.S. policy towards Iran and Badr et. al. were to change and an alliance were sought, that that sentiment would be reciprocated. I agree that it's highly unlikely, and that's unfortunate.   In your opinion, support Hashd is the best for Iraqis. In my opinion, supporting ISF is the best. Apperently, you are the God and only you know what is right.   I get that. I don't support Hashd ash-Sha'bi against the ISF, though. On the contrary I believe both should be supported (with the caveat that fundamentally I oppose any and all hierarchical governments and their various institutions) and that the Hashd ash-Sha'bi should be expanded to include more Sunni and other minority groups and individuals subsumed into existing paramilitary structures. I don't claim to be God, although of course I think I'm right, as you do. The shift in my language to a more assertive tone was in response to your claims to certainty and to my alleged lack of knowledge on these topics. I'll admit that it wasn't the most mature or professional thing to do.

It just sounds illogical to me to think that an organization who spends most of its propaganda on anti-Americanism. If the houthis would hate America because of its support for the Saudis which you somewhere claim, then it would be logical for them to spend at least the same amount of hate to Saudis which they don't do in their slogans atleast.

syriancivilwar,3cqf89,DickCheneyProfited1b,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:42:06 2015 UTC,"I'll make this short (referring you to the last paragraph here), but since you posted this at about the same time as that comment I'll extend the courtesy of answering now.   I do actually think that America cares about its soldiers. I do think that they play an important role in USA foreign policy and that a part of American policy is based on American soldiers. And I also think that part of the American distrust to shiite militias is their attack on American soldiers.   I don't think any state in history really cares about its soldiers on an individual, personal level. This isn't something unique to the U.S. -- all states across the span of human history are fundamentally primarily concerned with supporting the ruling class they exist to protect and enrich, and with ensuring their own survival. To this end, they use the tools they have in whichever way they think will best achieve these goals, and this includes the use of their military. I think mistrust of Iraqi Shi'a paramilitaries among the U.S. public is primarily a result of a deliberate media campaign guided from the White House and fueled by current foreign policy considerations rather than any past dealings.   Don't take it too personal although it is somehow, but you seem to be frustrated about America. I haven't read one positive word about America from you, unfortunately, even though you used to be an American soldier.   I don't take that personally, or at least not as insulting. Firstly you have to understand I'm an anarchist and thus fervently anti-nationalist, so I don't feel any loyalty or special love for any country qua a nation-state. Loyalty to and love for the people and land that those nation-states rule is quite different, and something I do feel for people and places across the world. I am quite frustrated with the U.S., as I think it's a destructive and exploitative force which is all but unchecked since the end of the Cold War. I resent all states (including the USSR, if you're wondering) as they exist to further the individual and class interests of the powerful, and disadvantage the vast majority of people both inside and outside the territories they govern in the pursuit of this end. There are positive things I can say about various aspects of the U.S. (American culture has produced some fantastic additions to human cultural history, for example), but not many I can say about U.S. foreign policy, especially that which has been in place in the 30 years I've been alive. My views might be uncommon among U.S. soldiers and former U.S. soldiers, but they're by no means unheard of. Spend some time moving in anarchist, communist, and socialist circles and you'll come across vets who think like I do.  Believe me, the Houthis hate the Saudis far more and far more directly than they do the United States. The U.S. is seen as the engine that drives and, critically, enables these more local evils, hence the ""death to America"". Also it was and has been a popular slogan associated with the Islamic Revolution, obviously growing out of the British-American coup d'état that destroyed Iran's organic liberal democracy and replaced it with a brutal dictator who sold Iran's resources for the enrichment of his family and friends. Iran has historically always been significant and powerful, and, at the time of Mossadeq's ouster, was re-emerging onto the world stage as a major player after a period of rapid European prosperity and aggressive expansion that directly exploited and overshadowed the countries of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Beyond the material losses suffered by the coup and at the hands of the Shah, Iranians took a savage blow to their dignity and pride. The Islamic Revolution re-asserted that dignity and pride and it's no surprise that it finds resonance not only across the Muslim world (and even beyond), but especially with Shi'a Muslims, who have historically been marginalized and oppressed just about everywhere they live.

syriancivilwar,3cqdis,sweoj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:52:09 2015 UTC,Yes. First time that I saw this kind of footage from SyAF. I have read that Russia has delivered new equipment to them recently for more precise strikes. Maybe this is it?
syriancivilwar,3cqdis,mangoriot,2,Fri Jul 10 09:33:17 2015 UTC,They might very well be guided bombs (a-la this KAB-500Kr) but we shouldn't rule out the possibility of regular dumb bombs as in several cuts (like at 0:09) it is clearly seen that bomb lands before the aircraft passes over a target thus meaning that the platform filming was not used to deliver a bomb.  Modified Su-24M2s with Gefest avionics are claimed by RuAF to be pretty precise even when delivering unguided munitions. As this has not been clearly showcased it's up to you to believe it or not but I'd take that possibility into consideration :)

Just like the SS could be declared a criminal organization, it can be easily argued that ISIS is also a criminal organization and as such its members are complicit in the crimes committed by their membership in such a group.  Kurds are an ethnic group, with people who identify as Kurds being members of different organizations all across the political and religious spectrum.  Your logic is flawed to suggest 'ISIS fighters' are not complicit in the crimes the military organization they voluntarily joined (often by traveling extreme distances to do so) and that this somehow represents 'collective punishment'."

Yes there is tensions and disagreements between political parties, but where isn't? Are the republicans and the democrats on the same level? Are the French political parties on the same level all the time?   Kurdistan/KRG, just like any other democracy, has different parties. That means that there is political divison, but that doesn't mean that there is no unity or that the unity is put to tests  Unlike Iraq, Kurdistan isn't debating whether they should help Kurdish refugees like there is about Iraqi IDPs in Iraq. Iraqi Anbari refugees have to come to Kurdistan because they are afraid of shiite militias, that is division. In contrast to Kurdistan where all the political parties unite to fight an enemy force(ISIS) without hesitation.   If anything, this war against ISIS has only brought Kurds closer. I've never seen so much Kurdish unity as now. Even Kurds who used to be pro-AKP are now pro-HDP. Millions of Kurds worlwide protest for Kobani, Kirkuk, Erbil, etc. In the past, Kurds couldn only dream about that."

These separate conflicts converged in November, when Turkish air and ground elements joined the KDP to force the PUK and the PKK to return to the established intra-Kurdish ceasefire line. Intra-Kurdish fighting in October and November resulted in the deaths of over 1200 fighters and an undisclosed number of civilians. A ceasefire established on 24 November 1997 ended the fighting for the remainder of the year, albeit with a few sporadic clashes. http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/puk.htm   Saddam had no control over Kurdistan anymore after the 1991 no-flyzone of the USA together with Peshmerga forces who crushed Iraqi Army on the ground.

Why should Peshmerga take a lot of casualties for backstabbing Yezidis, against ISIS terrorist army, who collected American weapons from the Iraqi Army?

Both are used to acting with a great deal of authority and both face parliamentary challenges to that authority.    No, he is not. KDP and PUK are together in a coalition. You are not in a state to judge Kurdish politics if you don't know the formation of the Kurdish government.  I suggest you go learn somethin about Kurdish politics instead of repeating the Iraqi/ISIS hate against kurds.   . The KRG is going to continue whether or not Barzani comes out on top in this fight, but it could have profound impacts... for example on the ongoing embargo the KRG imposes on Rojava.   Just recently the KRG has sent tons of food to Kobani. The problem is that PYD doesn't let KDP in Syria have some control. They block everything that the KDP tries to do in Syria."
syriancivilwar,3cpqoc,Reditski,2,Thu Jul 9 21:53:56 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't they block KDP operations in Syria? They have no business operating inside of the jurisdiction of the PYD.  If they want to help Rojava and its people then they should go through the PYD first and foremost.
syriancivilwar,3cpqoc,ihsw,4,Fri Jul 10 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"Shingal is not a city in the KRG neither Kurdish but Yezidi. Yezidis have backstabbed Kurds for centuries and always sided with the enemy of Kurds. Retreating from Shingal territory was necessary at that moment. Why should Peshmerga take a lot of casualties for backstabbing Yezidis, against ISIS terrorist army, who collected American weapons from the Iraqi Army? Why should Kurdish soldiers, who have families and kids at home, offer their lives so that Yezidis can scream ''bji Saddam'' and ''Ezidi Kurd na''(Yezidis are not Kurds)?   HAHAHAOHWOW. For centuries really? Let's not forget how the predominantly Sunni Kurdish mainstream had persecuted them for centuries. You sound like one of those Salafi extremists crowing about how ""Shias backstabbed Abbasids and allowed Mongols to take Baghdad"".  You know that there are many Yazidis who identify as Kurds as those who don't right? Also, if Peshmerga is just gonna run out off with their tails behind their legs at the slightest bit of IS incursion, they shouldn't have entered Sinjar to incorporate the ""backstabbing Yazidi territory"" in KRG in the first place. Peshmerga should have let the Yazidi locals to protect themselves then instead of coming in like saviours and protectors but are going to fuck off afterwards anyways in the face of IS.   Every time a Kurdish nationalist post something, I see more and more similarities with the Turkish and Arab nationalists that they supposedly hate; moaning about their victimisation at every opportunity while ignoring and whitewashing their own victimising."

syriancivilwar,3cplux,ofarrizzle,3,Fri Jul 10 03:51:47 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a difference of interpretation over what led to the (genuine and authentic) popular support for ISIL among a minority of Iraqi Sunnis. It's clear there are vested interests who blare their loaded perspective on the subject loudly and often from the soapbox of al-Jazeera and al-Arabiya and other platforms funded by the money of Gulf magnates and sheikhs to whip up Sunni angst however unjustified in Iraq, Syria, and beyond. This is the viewpoint which is also echoed in the Western press, albeit usually a lighter, tamer, and more nuanced version. It's without merit of evidence however. There's nothing to suggest that anyone in this community was unrepresented in the new Iraq based on sect, yet this conjecture is bizarrely treated as fact.  It's like an enormous Sunni victim complex has become the primary prism through which every Westerner comes to perceive the conflict, and that is not accidental."
syriancivilwar,3cplux,WorldsupportsBashar,-1,Fri Jul 10 03:58:28 2015 UTC,"It's not really that complicated as to why people disliked Baghdad and often turned to IS instead.  The Baghdad government's primary presence was an entirely corrupt, usually authoritarian and throughly sectarian military.  Its civil services were haphazard and corrupt at best and completely absent at worst.  Why would people like them?  I think many Iraqi Sunnis are now realizing who they threw their lot in with after the ISF's route last summer, but continuing to ignore why Baghdad is hated by most of Iraq's Sunnis will only continue to ignore the issues that led Iraq to this point, which makes it impossible to fix the situation.  To be blunt, failing to see how a coalition of stridently sectarian Shia nationalist parties (including sectarian terrorist organizations like Badr) leading a corrupt, ineffective government might alienate people is, well, silly."

syriancivilwar,3co77i,Man-jusri,2,Thu Jul 9 14:56:16 2015 UTC,"Hey Laky, quick question: Do you think it's viable to use the robust B-52 bombers without air support in Syria?"
syriancivilwar,3co77i,7threst,3,Thu Jul 9 15:15:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as opposed to the more modern bombers like the B-1 and B-2, the B-52 is a lot more vulnerable in Syria, especially when it comes to being versatile to shake off potential attackers (without air support).  Luckily, the Syrian Air Force Fleet has only been slightly upgraded, whereas the B-52 has been given major upgrades in the more than 60+ years it has been serving.  Also, do you think that the introduction of the F-35 Lighting II in December 2015 will perhaps in the years to come pay dividends in the air war against ISIS? It basically gives me the feeling the USAF is searching for a F-22 Raptor and the B-1 Lancer in one with the F-35! I'm very interested to see the comparable charts next year between the F-35  and comparable fighters."
syriancivilwar,3co77i,7threst,2,Thu Jul 9 16:47:32 2015 UTC,I don't think there will be any difference between using the F-35 or the F-16 against a low tech enemy like ISIS.

Their tech and weapon supply has only grown and now they have tons of field experience, not just in guerrilla assymetrical warfare, but in conventional battle as well. All their soldiers were already well trained, but now they all have field experience as well. Whatever legitimacy they lost supporting Bashar has been regained due to the rebels' genocidal intent. They've also proven their loyalty to Lebanon, and have risen as the only real viable military defender against Daesh and JAN. they've embraced the secular system of Lebanon, and a war with Israel anytime soon is looking unlikely, especially with their break in relations with Hamas, and many people are changing their minds on whether they're a terrorist group or a legitimate state actor.

Engaging in operations of any kind, for any army, will result in a use of equipment and potential loss of life in soldiers. If they are effective in this however, and have sustained supply lines, then the use of this is not a loss or a weakening.  Their weapon stockpiles are huge and finally being put to efficient use, and their stockpile has only improved (in supply and technology). Their operations have had very low deaths for the amount they've killed and the victories they've won, and the combat experience has been far more useful.  Overall, I do not see this as weakening in anyway, and if anyone actually believes that they are making a mistake. A serious mistake."

Hezbollah isn't just an army for looks -- it's an actual force, and it's meant to be used. Whatever uses they have had up to now have not been exceptional, but well within their capabilities. They're not stretching their supply lines or their supplies past an operational level.  I think you're very much mistaken here   Every loss stretches their Iranian resuppliers just a little bit further.   This is not true. You're making the mistake of thinking Iran's supply lines are not meant to be used at all. They're meant to be used. To use metaphor, Hezbollah here is not really dipping into its savings account. Its still using its ""chequing account"". And it can go all the way to using a line of credit, and still be somewhat comfortable.

syriancivilwar,3cqdh0,WordSalad11,-1,Fri Jul 10 06:25:26 2015 UTC,"Kozak said Tehran is facing a critical choice: continue using Hezbollah to shield Assad despite the group’s losses or cut ties with its most important ally in the Arab world to preserve the militia’s influence in Lebanon and ensure it remains prepared for a potential future conflict with Israel.   I have to agree. Push comes to shove, Iran will never pick Assad over Hezbollah. Now, if the choice was between Iraq and Hezbollah, that would a truly difficult deliberation for Tehran to resolve. But without major gains by the regime in the next few months, Hezbollah are essentially going to have to take over the role of the weakened and demoralised SAA."

It had been well documented and Baathists admitted it.   “The Iraqi government has also forced ethnic minorities such as the Assyrians, the Kurds and the Turkomen to sign ‘national correction forms’ that require them to renounce their ethnic identities and declare themselves to be Arabs,” says Hania Mufti of Human Rights Watch. https://www.lewrockwell.com/2003/02/glen-chancy/christians-for-saddam/    Many Kurds (as well as Assyrians and Turkomans) were forced to move from the cities of Mosul (Al-Mawsil) and Kirkuk, while Arabs were moved into their homes. After the fall of Saddam, the Arabs were not anxious to return to the volatile south. On the other hand, the Kurds could not return fast enough. You know the problem - Kurdish family shows up and wants its family home back. Arab family, through no fault of its own, is living there, has lived there for maybe 30 years, and does not want to leave. There is no real legal system in place, and most of these Arab and Kurdish families fall into that gray zone between a Saddam-ruled Iraq and now.   http://francona.blogspot.nl/2004/08/iraq-arabization-fallout.html    Assyrian organizations: This is the simplest and, by definition, the most deadly solution.  It calls for our assimilation in the cultures around us. In Iraq, the traitor Tariq Aziz has declared himself an Arab and invites the rest of us to follow suit.  In fact he is an architect of the Arabization plan offered by the Saddam dictatorship to solve ""the Assyrian problem.""  This is nothing new, and there was a time when many Assyrians in Iraq believed in this nihilist solution. Some couched it in leftist rhetoric of internationalism. Others distorted history to claim that present-day Arabs and Assyrians are one and the same.  Zowaa preaches pride in being Assyrians, and seeks to lead our people in Iraq to maintain our unique identity and gain our legitimate rights, including recognition of our national existence constitutionally. http://www.atour.com/adm/docs/strategy.htm"

This is why it isnt on the streets like NK or IS, controlling every aspect of your life other than the most lost and already forgotten aspect of it,  your voice.  You stay away from matters in which you clearly dont belong (you dont tell a barber how to cut), and you can have a very ""Western"" life (this applies only in non-poverty areas).  For this reason many young people in syria wont know what you mean when you say ""dictatorship"" because they havent seen any '1984' practices in the open, and the corruption and nepotism is just part of life, part of simply getting ahead in life and rewarding yourself and your family, just like the upper-class white/black university students in the US who will never experience racism and therefore assume its not as big of a deal as people make it out to be, due to their lack of knowledge on the subject.

It's to be hoped that a solution can be found to end this conflict long before, as the article states, the men of Syria 'have to fight to the last bullet'.  Reading this article makes one realise that more than ever before, the need for a transitional government is now. It's obvious to most that things are certainly no longer going Assad's way and allowing that abyss of destruction to deepen further will only 'Somalise' the nation.  Going forward, it would be interesting to know whether there could be men positioned beneath those higher echelons of the military who are able to see reason and would be able to influence things differently."

I still stand by my assertion that a combination of a large-caliber HMG with anti-armor rounds and a liberal supply of unguided rockets is what's needed to adequately defend against this tactic, both in the deserts and open plains of Kurdistan and in the cities of central Iraq. I did also notice from some older videos that the Iraqis are throwing up redundant rows of texas barriers in cities they anticipate an attack on, which is good, forcing Daesh to use up at least one (often armored) VBIED and one driver just to breach each line.   Are you familiar with spalling?   Too familiar. One of the ASVs from another company in my battalion ended up with a massive hole in its side and the entire fireteam dead when a rocket punched through the hardened steel on the front right and detonated after getting buried in the team leader's chest. Munitions that spall were foremost designed as a measure against plate armor rather than slat though, afaik."

The folks in charge surely know about both the cost-effectiveness and efficacy advantages you detailed in your earlier post, and you'd think that anti-tank rockets would be much more numerous than ATGMs but it almost seems like this isn't the case, although this impression could of course be due to details actions involving ATGMs being widely reported on and shared than those involving rockets."

It'll be a prideful honor to share that triumph with Iraqi brothers and sisters. They opened the gates and told sectarian militant Sunnis who shared their ideological preferences to invade Syria, they willingly set themselves up as proxies of the great powers who have opposed Syria on every critical issue since its inception as a modern state, they catapulted the country into a war which is an international focal point. So good to see government playing by their rules, which is no rules, and respond in kind since the gates remain open. And if Iran wants to enter the scene in greater numbers, they'll find greeting alms and free reign and open season on every rebel collaborator as well until this ideology is extinguished from Earth.

JAN and ISIS send soldiers to militiary/civilian targets to blow themselves up, their intend is to be a suicide bomber. I wouldn't describe the kurds that blow themselves up as suicide bombers. These are incidents in which soldiers have no other option, die or be captured. It's the same as an allied soldier calling an airstrike on himself during WW2, you aren't a suicide bomber, you're a hero."

Other jihadi groups like Jabhat al-nusra use suicide bombers, with I believe the exception of Ahrar al-sham. I could be wrong about that"

The Japanese Red Army moved to Lebanon after the delirious, incredible epilogue of the original United Red Army, which also inspired a movie, but its alliance with Palestinian communists was ideological, not just for convenience. There were other guerrilla groups which ended fighting for Palestine: Carlos «the Jackal» and his organization are perhaps the most famous (or notorious) example."

syriancivilwar,3cnyy3,Nmathmaster123,0,Thu Jul 9 17:13:50 2015 UTC,Hezbollah has two separate motivations Israel and Iran.

syriancivilwar,3cnyy3,Yasu3,2,Thu Jul 9 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"If the execution and likely torture of MEK/Israeli spies wasn't enough to satisfy Iran's thirst for revenge, its cyber attacks certainly were. What the fuck is the point of killing some unrelated civilians half-way across the world going to accomplish for Iran? What do you think Iran got out of the attacks? Dead Jews? There are plenty of Jews in Iran, the government could have started right at home. Iran and Hezbollah got absolutely nothing from the attacks but condemnation and terror listings.   Just the fact that Hezbollah ditched suicide bombings 30 years ago is one facet of proof that it wasn't behind the recent attacks. You seriously believe they're going to pick up suicide bombings after having ditched it for 30 years?   If you pay close attention all of these attacks came at a very opportune time which further worsened Iran's position in the world.  As Iran was negotiating a nuclear deal with Argentina (for the transfer of Uranium) the synagogue attack occurred. When India was refusing to enforce the US-Israeli sanctions against Iran the embassy attack occurred. On top of this Iran and India were working out a system in which Iran would use Indian rupees instead of dollars to exchange goods. So You're telling me Iran rewarded India's increasing cooperation and bilateral ties by carrying out a attack on its soil? You're telling me Iran rewarded Argentina's cooperation by bombing a synagogue and killing their people on their soil?  You're seriously telling me at a time when the world was deciding weather or not to go ahead with even harsher sanctions on Iran, Iran just attacked people to turn the world against itself and further increase the motive to apply sanctions?   Please, don't insult my intelligence, The Iranian government is made up of strategists, not butthurt salty children who carry out bombings because Israel made a move against them. The Iranian government is more sophisticated than you give them credit for. Retribution came in the form of killing Israeli spies and conducting cyber attacks, not bombing unrelated  civilians (they aren't even Israeli) who aren't even a factor in all this.  Why do you think there hasn't been an assassination of Iranian scientists in over 3 years? you think Mossad just stopped trying?    Burgas however was coordinated with Iran on behalf of Iran as revenge for Israel aiding the MEK and cyber warfare   Iran got direct revenge on the people who carried out the attacks, literally the same people who carried out the attacks were tortured and executed in Iranian prisons, Iran doesn't have to go to some random country half its citizens don't even know exists to kill some random people who weren't even related to this fight.   edit: goose3311 you better take a look at this too."

Its silly to say that they are the same based on that. Turkish army is also trained by/cooperates with the american army but that doesnt mean that they are the same.  I give you an example: just because the usa sponsored the turkish army, doesnt mean that the usa is responsible for the atrocities the turkish state terrorists committed when they slaughtered kurdish civilians in roboski and raped kurdish women. That was the turkish army who did that, the usa had nothing to do with it. And the same rule applies for the pkk and tak. Just because they communicate, doesnt mean they are the same."

syriancivilwar,3cke7f,christianbrowny,6,Wed Jul 8 23:04:00 2015 UTC,It is entirely obvious that a land invasion would have resulted in more casualties for both Japan and the US. Dropping the atomic bombs was supposed to be the lesser of two evils. I don't think ISIS is weighing consequences like this when they blow themselves up.
syriancivilwar,3cke7f,Deipnosophist,4,Wed Jul 8 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"That is a beautification of history. In an all out war both sides brought out strategic bombing meant to destroy the populations will to fight. It is just that it is not necessary for these fights as the US is not in an all out war for its survival. But ISIS is so it will use IEDs and suicide bombings and do everything they can do break the enemy.   1945: In the single deadliest air raid of World War II, 330 American B-29s rain incendiary bombs on Tokyo, touching off a firestorm that kills upwards of 100,000 people, burns a quarter of the city to the ground, and leaves a million homeless.   http://www.wired.com/2011/03/0309incendiary-bombs-kill-100000-tokyo/"
syriancivilwar,3cke7f,cc81,5,Wed Jul 8 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"I really think the US involvement in WWII was to the benefit of the entire world, and that it in fact WAS a war of survival considering the atrocities the axis powers were committing. Regardless, I feel it is irrelevant to compare the US to ISIS in this discussion.  More relevant would be to compare how ISIS fights to other factions in the war. For instance, how often do we see the YPG/SAA/Peshmerga using suicide bombs?"
syriancivilwar,3cke7f,Deipnosophist,7,Wed Jul 8 21:16:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree that the US involvement in WW2 was good for the world. But the strategy with the bombings were very similar to the strategies we now call terrorism. Breaking the will to fight by mass casualties. Dropping some 2000 tons of napalm on a city made of wood would probably be seen as terrorism and a war crime if for example Assad did it now.  I hate ISIS ideology and think it is terrible but the suicide bombers are just a natural weapon they have because of their beliefs. Especially when they use in military engagements and it is something ""we"" indirectly do as well. A general can order a taking of a important objective even if he knows it will result in several casualties; that is just war."

syriancivilwar,3cke7f,moneymakingmitch23,7,Wed Jul 8 20:59:08 2015 UTC,"Were the allies cowards for using mines in WWI? Anti-personal landmines have been used against occupying forces in most major conflicts in the past century. They are cheap and extremely effective, as this figure shows. The most shameful aspect, imo, is not a failure to directly engage the enemy, but rather the impact on civilian populations long after the conflict has moved on."
syriancivilwar,3cke7f,Trailmagic,-1,Wed Jul 8 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"They drive cars loaded with explosives and blow themselves up and are expecting to be rewarded immediately as a martyr.

syriancivilwar,3cke7f,Deipnosophist,7,Wed Jul 8 20:27:47 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. On a strategic level, an SVBIED presents an enormous amount of power that a standard militia otherwise wouldn't have. It isn't about how big the balls of your individual fucking soldiers are.

When the SAA uses a BMP to provide direct fire support are they cowards? No.  ISIS doesn't fucking have an air force, and hardly any heavy armor, so they are going to use dump trucks filled with explosives instead.  When the rebels used SVBIED's to breach the walls of the Aleppo central prison where they cowards? Fuck no, they were making up for their lack of proper ordinance."

syriancivilwar,3cke7f,sjjose2001,-2,Thu Jul 9 06:00:43 2015 UTC,"Really the bottom line is I consider it extremely cowardly to use religion as an excuse to blow yourself up. Evidently I have a different idea of cowardice from those who use this sub.  I understand that they are undersupplied. I understand that they have no air force and are surrounded by battlefront. I understand that desperate times call for desperate measures.   But it isn't brave to kill yourself if you think you will be immediately rewarded as a martyr in the afterlife. That isn't making a sacrifice. That's taking the easy way out. These dumb fuck cowards don't realize that once you die, anything on earth is absolutely irrelevant.  For comparison, there is a story about a US Marine in WW2 who was behind enemy lines and called an airstrike in on himself in order to route the enemy and allow the US to counterattack and retake the city.  This is an instance of bravery. He didn't join the war planning on sacrificing himself in the name of his religion in order to receive a reward. He decided to do it in the heat of the battle, for the good of his comrades.   How no one can see the difference is fucking beyond me."
syriancivilwar,3cke7f,Deipnosophist,3,Wed Jul 8 20:59:09 2015 UTC,Suicide bombing is a tactic  not an ideology or a motivation.  Stop generalizing those who do it.
syriancivilwar,3cke7f,Yasu3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:41:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with your criticism of the religious motivations for suicide bombing in the Middle East.  But from a military perspective, if your commander judges that an assault using an SVBIED will result in far fewer men dying in the battle, and someone volunteers, is it still the wrong decision?  And what if your WWII marine believed he was going to Heaven upon death? Would he no longer be brave?"

In one of the previous Vice documentaries, a Kurd being interviewed stated that they absolutely destroy ISIS on the battlefields and that the most casualties on their end were from suicide operations. This was because the Kurds had already been in various wars for many years with others (like the Iraqi government), but had never experienced suicide operation warfare like they had with ISIS. Either way, he said they had gotten accustomed to it and were getting better at avoiding casualties with the suicide operations."

syriancivilwar,3cke7f,pbj192,3,Wed Jul 8 19:37:22 2015 UTC,I think you misunderstood - the Kurds are avoiding taking casualties by responding to IS suicide bombings better. The Kurds aren't doing suicide missions.

The regime paved the way for ISIL to seize control of northern Aleppo from the Free Syrian Army and has cleared its way through aerial bombings since mid-June, according to Turkish assessments, which followed Turkish counter measures. The biggest threat to Turkey is any ISIL offensive which may trigger a massive influx of refugees from the wider region that is home to 4.5 million Syrians."

Oh if that wasn't enough, how about the massive black market trade, the oil trade, all of these go pretending to be unnoticed by the turks yeah right.. until the international community question turkey and they pretend it was never happening and stop it immediately.

The opposite is true - killing off the old guard then often gives rise to the young, reckless and more extremist leaders.  So it is pointless to fight a terrorist organizatin half-assed - be it al Qaeda or ISIS. One way or another, it has to be accepted that SAA and NDF will be a primary tool against ISIS besides the Kurds - not the 60 moderate freedom fighters."

syriancivilwar,3cl025,umakemefunny,2,Thu Jul 9 09:26:19 2015 UTC,"Are we really suggesting here Syria should be considered a bigger enemy of the United States than al-Qaeda when the former never even touched the U.S. (unless you count aiding the resistance to U.S. occupation of neighboring Iraq) and the latter butchered 3,000 American civilians on the streets of their own country?  There needs to be an end of this binge of imperial hubris we have seen since the 1990's from Washington and its water-carriers because really, Syria (and by extension Iran and our entire axis) is really only an enemy of any domineering empire that wants to puppetize the entire Islamic world to the detriment of its inhabitants. Stop trying to undermine, sabotage, destabilize, and annihilate independent nationalist governments at every turn and the ""threat"" evaporates. A movement like al-Qaeda with its warped Islamic theology has universalist, global ambitions and is a threat to every nation eastern and western alike who want a space free for their people to develop and live according to their own traditions."

If you are a pragmatic Syrian male on the ground who has a will to fight and has lost everything, it is certainly an enticing idea to join them.  Obviously we don't have numbers on the demographic breakdown of JAN, but you also cannot deny that a large chunk of their fighters are there for more pragmatic than ideological reasons.

The American government does not care how much JaN is ""contributing"" to the war, it cares that they are aligned with a global terror organization which specifically targets U.S. citizens. If overthrowing Assad at all costs was the goal, FSA crews would be doing donuts in M1 Abrams tanks on the charred remains of Assad's palace right now.

And further considering how Hezbollah treats its political opponents, its only a matter of time before they start arming themselves, leading to a most unpleasant sequence of events.   As for Iraq, I feel Maliki's ousting had far more to do with his extreme military failure. Calls for his removal were first issued in Iraq and then echoed in Iran as it became obvious   he couldn't remain a prime minister.   To be honest I doubt Maliki followed Iranian orders, but then again Yankovic didn't follow Russian orders either. Instead his associates describe Moscow's men making their way to his inner circle, driving his previous advisers out until they virtually controlled him. Or it could be something even more innocent, like some Iranian foreign policy strategist realizing his premiership is likely to lead to outcomes highly favorable to Iran though unfavorable to Iraq and thus deciding to support him. Maybe he didn't even think about the way his presidency would affect Iraq, though I still think Iranian foreign policy strategist aren't that foolish."

Let me tell you why:  Daesh attracts people with strong narcissistic complexes.  Many radical-minded people in the Muslim are arrogant, self-centered and lack empathy. And if you follow them on social media, you can see that they want a world that benefits THEM rather than everyone. Their lack of empathy is a reason why groups like ""Sharia4UK"" exists because they don't and refuse to understand the real world.  When you see British jihadis taking photos of them hanging out on a mansion in Syria like Instagram rich kids while the average citizen of Raqqa and Mosul are starving to death, you can see that Daesh and Wahhabi/Salafi sects feeds into the narcissism and delusions of many Muslims, especially young Muslims.

It seems like most of these fighters have a deep void back home and are seeking to fill it. Religion gives them the justification."
syriancivilwar,3cjc56,Coaste12ama,4,Wed Jul 8 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"If one lets their authority figures and groups define their morality, at the expense of reflection, empathy, and any conscience they may possess, they can become monsters if the external definition of right and wrong is monstrous...  Hyper-chauvenous religions like the daesh cult appeal to such ethically submissive individuals for various reasons, some because they truely are monsters with just enough of a sense of being such that they seek justification or approval of an invisible mythical father figure, others because they yearn for a group. Daesh gets bonus points for being a universally reviled group; it may seem that the group would be more tightly knit, or appeal to those disgusted with the world around them...and part of the human psyche craves group-vs-group conflict. The latter may not have become monsters if they learned to think for themselves.  So yes, religion is the impetus of horrors when it's imposed morality is immoral. The same can be said for nationalism or the various other ideologies which encourage the human equivalent of screeching, poo-flinging pack warfare."
syriancivilwar,3cjc56,AtomicDryad,5,Wed Jul 8 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"You are an expert in writing superfluous walls. I guess we can agree in a grand sense that if we eliminated all religions, then IS would not exist in the capacity they do. I however don't believe that this would eliminate extremist ideology, and I further don't believe that IS higher ups care much about religion, but more about their continued existence."
syriancivilwar,3cjc56,Coaste12ama,4,Wed Jul 8 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"You're contradicting yourself. You dismiss religion as the impetus of their horrors, but then you reintroduce it as the impetus, just by blaming the ""deep void"" which was filled with that religion instead. Are we also going to blame ""the void"" if the void is filled with a benevolent religion or philosophy, which makes people altruistic? If people want to claim that their religion makes their lives and the lives of people around them better, they should admit that a religion can also make people's lives better at the expense of others... and so on, through various permutations. This is not only logical, it's observable.  Would ISIS be doing what they're doing if that void was filled with Jainism or Humanism instead of Salafi, Jihadist Islam? No. It is their religion that makes them do this. Nothing is stopping those who join ISIS from saying ""I have a void and I'll fill it by being an egocentric, nihilistic hedonist and robing, raping and killing these innocent people"", nothing is stopping ISIS from being just another criminal organisation, just another Mafia involved in human trafficking, smuggling, extortion... Instead they say that they're building a Caliphate, they have an ideology, symbols, flags and governmental institutions, they call themselves Islamic State and say ""Slavery is permitted, Mohammad did it and regulated it, the prophecy predicts slave-girls giving birth to their masters..."". How can you not blame their religious beliefs for their actions?  There are few things as obvious in this world, as the influence of peoples' beliefs on their behaviour. If we can't even agree on this, then it's no surprise humanity is where it is. If you want to stop ISIS, or find a solution for all the fanatics who're migrating to their Caliphate, it would help to understand that beliefs actually do exist and that they can be blamed for the behaviour they motivate."
syriancivilwar,3cjc56,tiosls,4,Wed Jul 8 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"You seem to have missed my point. Yes, blame the void. Why is the not legitimate? If we look at the demographics of many of the western fighters, they aren't coming from radically tied families. They are generally marginalized citizens who feel ostracized. IS offers them a cure to that. We should be striving to offer alternative paths than radical Islam, instead our societies are tightning grips around muslim communities and further pushing them to the fringe. I really don't understand your counterpoint, so I hope that clears up what I was trying to say."
syriancivilwar,3cjc56,Coaste12ama,4,Wed Jul 8 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"Answering the problem of radicalization by pointing at the general conditions is like explaining the tide with gravity. Yes, gravity will explain the tides, but it also explains just about every other phenomenon in the universe. To point it out is so trivial that it's meaningless.  You're saying that that void should be filled with something not-ISIS... everybody knows this. But the problem isn't the void, because that's just the human condition. Read anything relating to the human psyche, from ancient Indian texts to ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman... up to today, and you'll read about the issues people describe as ""the void"". This void is the main issue of humanity, it's everything. There are many more people out there that are worse off than these poor radicalized Muslims, who aren't joining ISIS or its non-Muslim equivalent. The reason people become Islamists and Jihadists isn't because they simply have issues, it's because they're trying to resolve their issues with an interpretation of Islam that's come to be widespread and unquestioned. Therefore, it's not the void that's the problem, it's their type of Islam."

We make choices, but we don't make a choice before we make a choice to make it. Will is basically synonymous with our identity, our nature, and that includes our motivations. ISIS supporters happen to be motivated to be who they are, and therefore to do what they do, just like other people are motivated to hate them for what they're doing. Mankind can either decide to endlessly go around in circles and marvel at ""how could somebody do x"" or it can decide to agree on what ""good"" means and that it should be the foundation of morality, like the declaration of human rights for example, and strive to apply it.   A reason is only as legitimate as somebody believes it to be. People hate ""new atheists"" and mock them for being ""edgy"" and ""shoving atheism down people's throats"", but it's the foundational texts and basic principles of religious belief, including Islamic beliefs, that serve as a starting point for religious extremism. If you're taught not to doubt or question yourself or your beliefs, because questioning your beliefs would mean questioning your religion, its prophets and God himself, it's no surprise that some on the extreme end of the spectrum feel so convinced in themselves as to end up committing atrocities."

Imagine if a bunch of well-intentional iranians went to central Europe, and tried to built a well-functioning nation-state for the local population. Theyd be almost guaranteed to fail.  Or what about Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria? Western nation building has been a dismal failure in these places, but that does not imply that the locals has been much more succesful. The troubling fact is that nation building is difficult, takes centuries, involves lots of violence and repression, and still often result in failure."

Western nation building has been a dismal failure in these places, but that does not imply that the locals has been much more successful.    I am kind of ambivalent about this, I mean from what I understand in Iraq and Afghanistan building a successful nation/state seems like it was pretty low down on the list for the architects, shutting down huge swaths of the state outright and firing people seems like it isn't the thing somebody does if they want to build an effective nation. I think a lot of it was incompetence but they  also wanted a weak state which would be easy to control and which would be easy for various companies to get their dues from (iirc with the final decree to the government they came clean with this wanting guaranteed contracts etc for oil companies etc). I suspect something similar is going in with Iran in Iraq, it's plausible that they don't want a unified and successful Iraq as it would possibly be a rival both economically and with in the region as a majority shia power, that is the only way the myopic sectarianism makes sense to me anyway. With Afghanistan I think there is a stronger case that it was just ignorance and incompetence, but I don't think they wanted to turn Afghanistan into a modern nation state either, and even if they did who their allies were pretty massively contradicted that, I can't think that they didn't know that.  But, the US and other European powers did a pretty good job of building a successful state in post war Germany, Japan and Korea (sort of), I think they had different intentions there though. Also  Iraqis and people in various other middle eastern countries  did a pretty good job of nation building at various times in the past; Iraq, Egypt, Iran and others were stable and developing at a decent rate, pan Arab nationalism was potentially going to lead to integration of the region along somewhat similar lines to the EU etc, etc. Much of this was at least partially brought to an end by interference and global political stuff.   involved in the US' central and south American"

(Someone correct me if I'm wrong, this is only a cursory analysis.)  Quite good and probably cements SAA-YPG/J cooperation a fair bit, especially given that Issam Zahreddine is there securing Nashwa personally.

They won't work with the Turks, they've clashed with FSA groups and Islamist groups before. They also clashed with Government and revolted in 2004. Much like everyone else in Syria today they alliances and agendas and seek alliances of convinience to advance those objectives and agendas.  The current support for the SAA in this battle is not out of any love for Assad, and prior to Daesh's attacks here there were clashes between the NDF and the YPG in this region.  3) Once ISIS is gone it will not be the end. The SAA will still have to find a way to deal with YPG and vice-versa, the two cannot co-exist in peace time with no external threat like Daesh. The regime claims mastery of an undivided Syria- all of it, and every person within it's borders. Rojava and the Kurds included.

I also do not believe Syria thinks it will come away with all Syrian land at this point, the kurdish land issue is a big one and I do not know the outcome, however, I am rather confident that Assad knows he cant get everything back anymore, barring complete and utter military crippling of all the jihadists/FSA."

I would file most into propaganda from both sides. Propaganda from the takfiris because merely invoking their name is enough to send their followers into a blood-soaked frenzy seeing red screaming about the filthy rafidah invader. And propaganda from some in the pro-Syrian camp as a morale booster given the reputation of Hizbollah and that it has acquitted itself with such a fine prowess in this war (and for Arabs in a more general sense since 2006).   User below mentions their involvement in the defense of Deir Ezzor and Hasakah but I found it unlikely at the time given Syrian Republican Guard units were active in both and more than capable of the same feats.

They have a very infantile attitude and are unable to see the bigger picture, that this is a question of national inclusion. It's not a slight to Hafez (God keep him close), but depicts a beautiful Syrian scene from Deraa, southern Syria, where people in areas which are contested or under occupation of the militants must also know now and in the future that they are full stakeholders in a whole and united national Syria. I can't believe that some hotheads would take this opportunity to make noise against an atmosphere of inclusion. They are not nationalists but like club or gang members with short fuses and short sightedness. Hafez does not need you to leap to his defense over trivialities.

Several major western European cities now have dangerous Muslim slums and the last thing they want is to expand them.

In a move that observers saw it reflects the ""turbulent"" in ""coordination"" between the security forces on the one hand, the Army's military police, on the other hand, have been arrested group was on its way to the Syrian province of Hama and then desert Palmyra, to be seen later that all the elements They are employees of the regime's army, and some elements of the so-called Army of National Defense.  It was reported from the area, that, since the capture of the group, which operated under the protection of the Syrian army and national defense elements cover, have been dragged several affiliated groups for more than a security apparatus in Syria, came elements of the state security and elements of the Republican Guard, and elements of the Political Security Division. To show later, that ""the point of influential"" want ""to heal"" the subject and mitigate its effects on people, after it became clear that the weapon sender to intermediaries working for the ""Daash"" in secret, they acknowledge to the rural areas of Hama, then in charge of transportation in their own way, to fields that are fighting them.  100% loyal to the region and the smugglers they belong Has the process in a system military point in the villages of the mountainous town called ""the head of the eye,"" and in the region, which opened up highway famous known Bootostrad ""Beit Yashout"" which ends Bmcharv city of Hama and on the land border connected to Homs and apparent ruin that became However Daash weeks ago. Which you see multiple sources, and the people of the region, it can only be done under the auspices of the regime's army. And the ""Beit Yashout"" and earlier from the villages, and beyond, are considered ""protected"" especially the Syrian regime 100% at the grassroots level, and on the political and security levels, and knows the people of the region that the stranger it can not even walk around on foot or in a car, because it will be stopped and accountability. And he saw the people of the region from here, that transit vehicles carrying arms to ""intermediaries Daash"" to take him to the desert Homs and Palmyra, can only be done through ""a series of accomplices"" who ""sold military honor for Doaash"" versus ""money.""  After stopping cars that were transporting arms, in the pro region of the system 100% but is considered one of the most environments foster a pro and fanatical, intervened forces belonging to the Republican Guard, to hide the ""scandal"" and ""ignorance"" actors, preventing a shooting, and merely ""the first time"" filming smugglers Army personnel from their backs, and hide their faces. At a time when Assad regime does not refrain, from filming ""bodies of Christians"" and focus on ""cross tattoo, or photographing, transfer and deployment of the toughest and most heinous images to push his supporters for"" disgust ""of his opponents!

Once circulated system, all the security forces who attended the incident, not to be involved who were arrested names, not their military rank, nor portray their faces an agent he knew people in the region, even rushed many of the sons of Latakia, blaming the ""army leadership"" that has become corrupt to the degree that sell the arms to Daash and through intermediaries.  The first thing demanded by the people of the region is to ""uncover the faces of those involved"" and asked: ""Why Tkhvon their faces? And why not publish their names"" in question explicitly the role of the security forces to ""to cover up"" the issue and politeness ""scandal"" that hit the officers and elements in the army and through the cover of security forces multiple.

However, after the intervention of other security forces, came specially to stop the hype that accompanied it, and prevent trading details and the names and faces of those involved, he decided to patrol military intelligence ""giving"" this achievement to the ""National Defence Army"" to get rid of the embarrassment, and to say that the detection of the smuggling of weapons has been on the the hands of his officers and elements. But the latter did not accept the ""gift"" and said he came to the area after hearing news ""for stopping cars loaded with weapons destined to mediators Daash""! Which experts considered it as ""evasion"" of responsibility for the arrest of this group, which knew they exercised this work for some time, and under the facilities of the army and security forces. However, the arrest, the dawn of a scandal affecting more than one supportive. All began evasion of victory celebration, to donate it to another party, which Pedroh throw to another.  It is noteworthy that the security forces, not only revealing the faces of officers and elements involved smuggling of arms, but remained silent on also content from hardware, not the pictures show only bags black unknown content, observers think it may be stuffed with explosives or advanced lightning.

syriancivilwar,3cjili,blackstonebite,21,Wed Jul 8 12:01:24 2015 UTC,"A small bit of justice, but the massacre was of 1,566 recruits, obviously many more than just these 24 were involved in the killing. The article adds this depressing fact:    He added that 604 other militants, believed to have taken part in the killing, were still at large.   Hanging these 24 is a start, but many I fear will escape justice.   Everyone knows the Albu Ajil tribe were implicated heavily in the massacre. They were the tribe that sold Tikrit to ISIS in the first place, likely were the main culprits in the Speicher Massacre, and then when the war turned and the Shia militia's arrived in Tikrit to kick ISIS out, all of a sudden Albu Ajil were declaring their innocence.   What can the militias or government do about it? ISIS would like nothing more than for the government/militias to arrest hundreds of Albu Ajil men for the crime. They would just play the victim and make out that the government and militias are the sectarian ones for arresting hundreds of Sunni tribesmen.    So the Albu Ajil tribe were let off."

They mined the road to make the journey of the rescue force painfully slow. I've heard that the people of Amreli have burnt all the houses. I hope they do.  They're not the only ones. I remember reading articles about Sunni villages wiped out by ISIS with the help of their neighbours because they resisted.  People who help ISIS can't plead ignorance.

The guy you quoted is essentially pushing for more air strikes, even if civilian casualties will occur. He is looking at the problem from a purely military perspective. The propaganda  value for ISIS of US aircraft killing civilians would only reinforce their narrative that the Western crusaders are invading arab lands. This would attract far more recruits.   Second, this essentially confides ISIS to large civilian locations; venturing outside of civilian 'air cover' will get them killed. This is a double edged sword - it can be both good and bad. It's bad since it allows ISIS to stay in cities and to get more entrenched within society, reinforcing its 'state' narrative and making them harder to dislodge."
syriancivilwar,3cltyw,Harutinator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:46:04 2015 UTC,"Considering all the fronts ISIS has to attack/defend on, staying put inside of the cities is not really an option for them, they have to move around, so there are still a lot of opportunities to strike convoys etc. As we've seen with the inner city bombing in raqqa, even that's possible despite these strict ROI.   getting ""entrenched within society"" seems to be one of ISIS's main goals, with or without air strikes, if anything, the pressure from the airstrikes to allow YPG to open more fronts has worked to counter this, as we've seen with the reports of security cameras replacing militants on the street in raqqa..  Also I can't attest to the image damage the coalition gets from killing civilians in Syria. Everyone over there is doing so much killing and spewing so much propaganda, if I were in the middle of it, I wouldn't know who to believe.."

He knew that few people wants to fight for a corrupt dictator, but will fight to the end for their kin, community and ancestral lands.

On the flip side of that, of the few Australian's who have gone to fight with the YPG, I have really only read about Ashley Dyball and Reece Harding.

We shouldn't have dictators at all, but since removing them by force isn't strictly a good option (see Iraq), we don't do it wholesale.

syriancivilwar,3cjbnh,Neosantana,-1,Wed Jul 8 15:58:07 2015 UTC,"There's certainly nothing which makes it any less legitimate than a non-hereditary one.  Besides, a hereditary succession and transfer of power only happened once in what is by historical standards a fairly young state, which makes perfect sense as Hafez (God keep him close) can be considered the father of modern Syria. It doesn't at all paint a full picture and inform us who the next candidate the Ba'ath upper echelon put up will be. In all likelihood it will be someone without genetic ties to the first family and probably non-Alawi to appease the bigots who are hesitant to support open treason and the armed groups but who distrust all non-Sunni thought and life. It will probably be a face which fosters inclusion, either Sunni or potentially Druze."

Your response doesn't make any sense. We're talking about this war which is being fought internally and not comparable to invoking the tired specter of Hitler when the German military invaded and expanded from the Caucasus through much of continental Europe to the Sahara.   Britain also used to occupy Iraq, Egypt, Palestine, the Indian subcontinent, and much of Africa, so maybe a no-fly zone should be declared against London. It's about as relevant."

To make it even more contemptible, as this ""law"" requires enforcement, those doing the selective politically-driven and completely self-serving enforcement are powers like the U.S. either unilaterally or through the guise of its wholly dependent multilateral institutions, so yeah, when the biggest bully on the block tries to punish ""law"" violators who are also its adversaries and simultaneously augment its own global power and influence, its own abysmal track record kind of is relevant..."

syriancivilwar,3cjbnh,the_red_wheelbarrow,20,Wed Jul 8 11:12:53 2015 UTC,"This sort of mob justice is precisely why government supporters don't trust the opposition one bit.

syriancivilwar,3cjbnh,dashaaa,8,Wed Jul 8 11:43:25 2015 UTC,I think most of the opposition do want sectarian pogroms. they blame the Shia/alawite for all their problems in life.

I'm just saying I would understand if any Syrian put a bullet into Bashars head the moment he spotted him.   Nice long trial might work in a country that doesn't look like Mad Max set. Cleanest, quickest and best option for Syria is to sentence Bashar right on the spot if they get him. Syria will have much, much bigger problems to deal with than Bashar once the war comes to an end. Keeping Bashar alive would just cause much more problems than it would help to resolve. There can be a court, sure a court would just need to show pictures of arial bombardment without a single word said, and that would be enough to hand Bashar over to executioners. Oh and I believe that one man can commit such disguisting war crimes that he basicly becomes a fair game for anyone.   Again I'm not talking about revenge against Alawites as a group, that would be wrong."
syriancivilwar,3cjbnh,KevinMango,3,Wed Jul 8 12:01:08 2015 UTC,"cleanest way is to ship him off to Iran, IMO.

syriancivilwar,3cjbnh,the_red_wheelbarrow,3,Wed Jul 8 19:01:39 2015 UTC,"These things start with one summary execution, and swiftly get out of control.

You say summary execution, I say quick sentence because evidence is simply overwhelming, here I only mean quick sentence against the man that is ultimately responsible for every war crime commited by his side, and that is Bashar.   I'm not talking about his ministers, generals, pilots, officers and so on. They all should be put in front of a real court, they shoul be given time to prepare their defence. We can even talk about sending them to Hague. The ONLY exemption should be Bashar."

Once Assad is gone I really think that even Russia will support peace keeping mission in Syria organised by Arab league..

I follow this conflict as much as I can and you are right when you say that JaN would commit a war crime if they were the only ones. But there are other groups that prevent them from doing so. Also they know that if they do a single mistake US will bomb the crap out of them. In fact JaN  got bombed by US few months ago, don't know why, but I think it was just to send a message.  But even JaN is slowly learning that they can't go around shooting everyone. Since IS showed up JaN is slowly understanding that that type of extremism doesn't lead anywhere.  And again we are only talking about JaN in Syria because of Assad. If he organised an elections (that was the only thing protestors originally demanded) we wouldn't be sitting here talking about JaN.  Funny thing is that if Bashar organised elections when protestors demanded them he would have probably won. But he decided that shooting protestors is a better way to go so here we are."

Saudi and Qatari monarchies aren't good and I don't support them but they are also miles away from doing what Bashar is doing. OK I'll admit Saudis probably commited and are commiting war crimes in the air campaign against Yemen. But they still try to shoot military targets only, Bashar doesn't give a flying f about who he bombs.   If one day people openly start to riot and demand democracy in Saudi Arabia and Qatar and evidence comes out that their leaders were torturing and killing them....

syriancivilwar,3cjbnh,MPLA4,5,Wed Jul 8 14:01:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The protests in Bahrain were the most peaceful during the ""Arab Spring"".

The fact it can vary is a blessing, not a deterrent..  Ijma' is ijma'..the discussion of ""whom"" the ijma pertains to is of discussion. As for Sunnis, this includes ulema from the Sunni schools of fiqh, and aqida, as classically and traditionally accepted.

""You can take Salahuddin out of the books, but you can't take Salahuddin out of the Kurd.""  And before I am downvoted by ""islamo-haters"", here is an excerpt from the article itself, with arguments given by Abdullah Ocalan himself.  ""Together with these ideas, Öcalan’s letter sent to both congresses foregrounded a concept of cultural Islam. He argues that Shi’ite and Salafi orientations have both been power-centred state structures that emerged as a result of the rise of capitalist imperialism after the demise of the Ottoman Empire, and that both used the “nationalism microbe” against the essence of Islam. He gives the example of how the British Empire used capitalist imperialism to divide the Islamic ummah into nation-states. To him, that is why the current implementation of Islam by existing state structures has been destructive to core values of Islam, which are, most importantly, just and liberal. He sums up the incumbent state structure of the Middle East as authoritarian, laicist, nationalist fascism, and the non-state radical versions (Hezbollah and Al-Qaida and their derivations) as religious fascism."""

syriancivilwar,3ckp5t,the_red_wheelbarrow,2,Wed Jul 8 19:12:52 2015 UTC,Couter attacks are costly though. And as far as I remember the disaster in the southern Idlib region began as a counter offensive to recapture Idlib city.

syriancivilwar,3ckp5t,the_red_wheelbarrow,3,Wed Jul 8 19:51:40 2015 UTC,"Since the rebels haven't taken the road trough some kind of lighting offensive and since  holding is probably preferable to retaking, I'd guess if they were to take the road they would have to defeat the reserves in Aleppo either way. Apart from that both of Assad's firefighters, Hassan and Zahreddine are currently busy, it'll be a while till the road is recaptured. And if the rebels are smart enough the couter offensive could be extremely costly,  when it finally comes.   Edit: I really shouldn't write long posts from my phone."

syriancivilwar,3ck8mj,EmirOfScotland,8,Wed Jul 8 15:45:27 2015 UTC,"There is a doctrine of international law called odious debt, that allows for the nullification of debts by dictatorial regimes. Since bond markets won't really distinguish between declaring debt odious and a default, its not used as often as it should be.   I doubt debt will matter though. Whoever forms a government after the war may default with practically no consequences. After all nobody's going to be buying Syrian bonds any time soon."
syriancivilwar,3ck8mj,100100145,6,Wed Jul 8 16:12:13 2015 UTC,Yeah for real. Even the idea of a financial sector and the trading of Syrian bonds seems like a distant paradise compared to what's going on now
syriancivilwar,3ck8mj,NotVladeDivac,5,Wed Jul 8 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"Low debt in total, per capita and as % of GDP. They don't have access to the financial markets, so they can't borrow to pay for social programs like most other countries do. England, Germany, Egypt have much higher debt than Syria.  War is expensive, but not as expensive as peace."
syriancivilwar,3ck8mj,lostpatrol,8,Wed Jul 8 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"Well, exactly because they have limited access to the financial markets but still have to get the money somewhere the question was how much they owe to Russia and Iran who are their main creditors, especially now that they've lost 80-90% of their oil producing facilities.  Also, war is very rarely ""less expensive"" than peace. The post-war rebuilding process usually boosts the economy, but the immidiate effects like a conscription of able-bodied men, social panic, the educated workforce fleeing the country and destruction of property are very detrimental to the economy. Plus in the case of the Syrian goverment they still need to get their arms and vehicles somewhere since they don't produce most of them."
syriancivilwar,3ck8mj,MaslinuPoimal,3,Wed Jul 8 18:52:11 2015 UTC,While those countries have much higher debt they also have the resources and means to pay them back. The Syrian govt is essentially busted and can't create revenue to pay off Amy debts.   Russia has forgiven billions of Syrian debt and Iran has extended a credit line which I'm sure they don't ever plan on seeing a return from.
syriancivilwar,3ck8mj,blogsofjihad,0,Wed Jul 8 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"Who said anything about repaying debt? Few countries repay their debt, they just keep it rolling onto the next generation. In fact Syria is better positioned to clear their debt because of their benefactors. If Assad wins, then he can expect Iran and Russia to be lenient. If the rebels win they can expect their Arab state patrons to support them as they do Egypt.  The narrative this week is that Syria is so deep in debt, because Assad. I looked up the numbers, and Syria is in fact not in anymore debt than most the players in this conflict."
syriancivilwar,3ck8mj,lostpatrol,3,Wed Jul 8 19:20:58 2015 UTC,The two aren't comparable as there are no real numbers since the war started. The Syrian govt is generating zero revenue these days. Yet they're still accumulating debt to fight a war. The other countries have an actual revenue stream and gdp that can off set debt.   Syria without their foreign patrons wouldn't be able to fight the war any longer.
syriancivilwar,3ck8mj,blogsofjihad,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:01:32 2015 UTC,Syria isn't going to be paying back any debt. In fact it will take on more debt after the war. There are vast areas from Damascus to Aleppo that need to be rebuilt. They've already signed multiple deals with Iran and Russia. I'm sure the Chinese will want to get a slice of that action now that they've decided they want to use their money building infrastructure in Asia.  Only question is how quickly will the economy bounce back to make the debt payments less painful.

syriancivilwar,3cmn1p,Luakey,-1,Thu Jul 9 10:02:28 2015 UTC,Well in fairness replacing an ethnic nationalist dictatorship with a militant theocracy is hardly an improvement. Are there any instances of freedoms and rights improving under rebel-held areas?
syriancivilwar,3cmn1p,finsareluminous,2,Thu Jul 9 10:01:28 2015 UTC,"Freedom of the press, certainly. I read a great article on how independent radio shows and newspapers have exploded in opposition-held areas. Freedom of speech has improved by virtue of the lack of a state security apparatus comparable to the Mukhabarat, though Nusra can be a nasty group regardless in the areas it controls. For Sunnis, greater religious freedom - being too open about your religion under Assad (And that goes for any religion) would put you on the Mukhabarat's shit list. More freedom to run local government and services, which would often be absurdly corrupt and mismanaged by the regime in rural areas.  There are still a shit-ton of problems in rebel held areas, ranging from extremists to simple corruption and theft to the fact that Syria's economy is a lot worse (Understatement) than it was in 2011. But some things have improved, even if they're not necessarily noticeable unless you go looking for them."
syriancivilwar,3cmn1p,Luakey,2,Thu Jul 9 03:32:07 2015 UTC,"Well said, the notion of a religious regime being automatically worse than a secular one is false, even if it's a challenging concept for secular Western-oriented people to accept."

syriancivilwar,3cmn1p,The_Lebanese_Thinker,3,Thu Jul 9 06:06:05 2015 UTC,"I was hoping you'd ask.   Both Syria and Qatar (Which ranks very low in the region) guarantee women full enfranchisement and rights/benefits. In reality, in terms of gender inequality Syria ranked 124 and Qatar 117 in 2010. In 2008 Syria scored a 51 for gender equity compared to 50 for Qatar (Out of 100). In terms of women's economic opportunity, in 2010 Syria ranked 106th compared to 80 and 81 for Oman and Jordan, respectively. It has pretty consistently been at the bottom for women's economic opportunity in the region.  Moving on to what's actually on the books (Rankings only tell us so much) Syria and Qatar are about equally discriminatory in a number of places. Neither recognizes rape within marriage or allows Muslim women to marry into other religions. Women have to get their husband's permission to work or travel. Sex outside of marriage is criminalized, as is adultery, but women are punished significantly more heavily than men. Neither state has legislation to protect women from domestic violence.  Qatar is stricter in its modesty laws compared to Syria, but there are a wide variety of other provisions to consider. Prosecution of honor killings is much stricter in Qatar compared to Syria. It requires minimum of 10 years compared to 2-7 maximum in Syria, with many other exceptions to avoid trial or further minimize sentencing (If the killing was done out of righteous anger by a relative, for example). Qatar is also much more strict about child marriage compared to Syria, which allows girls as young as 13 to marry with the permission of her father or grandfather. In Qatar, female business ownership is around 13% compared to 10% in Syria, with numbers in other countries in the region exceeding 20%.   So Syria literally only exceeds Qatar in terms of its modesty laws. Everywhere else, it's either just as bad or worse. Compared to other states like Oman or Jordan, it gets blown out of the water."
syriancivilwar,3cmn1p,ButlerianJihadist,-1,Thu Jul 9 07:27:20 2015 UTC,"Those numbers are incorrect and we should take with a grain of salt, but here are my two cents where I hope we can meet in the middle  Syria's large cities [pre-war] like Aleppo, Damascus, Latakia, Homs, Hasakah etc have better women rights than any place in Qatar or Bahrain and their women right and groups are equivalent to that of the west.  Now this is balanced by the lack of women rights in rural areas like the countryside, for example Idlib country side and Ar Raqqah which are more strict and conservative. The vast majority of people here dont allow their girls to walk outside on their own let alone go to work.  we have a contrasting situation in the cities and in the village areas, and the fact that most of the rebels come from the poor countryside shows their state of mind and whats in store for Syria and those who reject them in the cities"

You're being willfully ignorant of how conservative Syria was under Assad outside of propaganda. They even had Sharia courts to resolve domestic disputes.  You're right that rural Syria is more culturally conservative, but often about more ""superficial"" issues like separating men and women and clothing. In terms of things like domestic abuse, child custody, and assault there's not that much of a dispute."
