Imagine Sterling but with the ability to shoot and cross the ball but then again it was the MLS. Sissoko on the other hand, fart...  The season is going to depend on De Jong and Aarons being fit the entire time. Aaron and Perez on either side of Mitrovic will work for the next 10 years.  Would like to see Kemen given a chance this year before he runs off. Could be a perfect replacement for Tiote and give us that link between defense and De Jong."

NUFC,3e6jy2,WigglyParrot,4,Wed Jul 22 10:01:58 2015 UTC,You know for a fact that the players we're being linked with and have signed are on the word of Carr. I know we haven't seen them play properly yet but I feel we're so blessed to have such a great scout in Graham Carr.
NUFC,3e6jy2,The_White_Django,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:10:44 2015 UTC,"I do think McClaren is having a say on who he wants too though, which is huge.   It just depends if Ashley is willing to pay the cash for those other targets. E.g. Austin.   I do hope we have a few cheap unknowns to bolster the depth, a la Ayoze. Carr certainly does a great job."
NUFC,3e6jy2,The_White_Django,2,Wed Jul 22 10:26:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely, but we've scouted these players before McClaren came in as per the article in which we had scouts when Anderlecht played Dortmund. But yeah, I agree, every club has an extensive list of players that have been scouted and it's up to the manager to pick and choose who they want, but the sheer fact that McClaren and Carr have a good working relationship just makes it better for us"

I'm not saying McClaren is the be all and end all of the transfer scenario, but I do think, as you say, he gets a pick on who we sign, and doesn't have players signed behind his back / who he doesn't want, which is huge.  Also, I'd agree with your last statement, but I also think he worked well with Pardew didn't he ?"

NUFC,3e6cse,WigglyParrot,4,Wed Jul 22 08:18:56 2015 UTC,"Although a lot of people want us to strengthen the defence I think we're really weak on the wings, we have Aarons, Gouffran and Sissoko and then we can play Cabella and Perez on the wings but they're out of position so I wouldn't be against a little more depth."
NUFC,3e6cse,KebabMaster,8,Wed Jul 22 09:18:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally. Nothing wrong with a bit more depth, and at 2m? Can't hurt at all."
NUFC,3e6cse,Frank1892,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:38:22 2015 UTC,"I think with the formation we've been playing, we're relying heavily on Janmaat and Haidara for width. I imagine Cabella, Aarons, Perez, Sissoko will all have their chance just behind the stikers, wide but still central, probably used as wingers when we're changing it up.  I agree though, an actual winger is a good choice, although Obertan seems to be getting his chance in the friendlies and he can be very good, although very rare. Plus Aarons looks pretty versatile."
NUFC,3e6cse,Frank1892,2,Wed Jul 22 10:00:08 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Aarons is going to be the brightest spark for us this season.  He just seems to have class beyond his years, it's incredible. I just hope to god he signs a contract extension. It would hurt to lose him for a pittance agreed by a tribunal."
NUFC,3e6cse,Deathbynote,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:31:04 2015 UTC,"If keeps his performances going in these friendlies, then I expect McClaren to have a headache on whether to put him straight in, especially with Cabella out. It does look promising, but we've hardly seen him in the Premiership. The 3-3 Palace game was impressive, he was our only threat, goal and assist too. I'm excited for next season if we can get Mbemba and steer clear of major injuries."
NUFC,3e6cse,scrugbyhk,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:31:14 2015 UTC,Having a quality player like Aarons on the left is great and all but it causes a slight imbalance in the team when we don't have someone comparable on the right. I hope to see this addressed sooner rather than later because if all our play is coming down the left it will be easy to defend against.
NUFC,3e6cse,Hollea,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:34:21 2015 UTC,18 goals in 80 appearances according to other sources. But Dutch media don't rate him and he apparently had an extremely mediocre season last year... I'd prefer a quality CB instead!

NUFC,3e69ac,wonderLanddd,10,Wed Jul 22 07:29:02 2015 UTC,"I can offer you a perspective from a Forest fan who has found his way onto this subreddit!  Lascelles is a very promising talent - strong, tall, very fast for a CB. However, any Forest fan will tell you that he's not ready to step up and start in the PL yet. In our back line last year, he looked brilliant when he had Jack Hobbs (our best CB when fit) next to him, but he is forever injured and so when he wasn't there, Lascelles looked fairly lost. As with most CBs, he will mature and get better and better with age, but he needs a quality centre back to learn from and play alongside - much like how Gary Cahill has come on leaps and bounds since he's started playing alongside John Terry.   I worry that you're going to throw him into your first team like a lamb to the slaughter (albeit a monstrous lamb) which will stifle his development, because as I say, he's a very promising talent and we haven't had a young centre back anywhere near as good as him since Michael Dawson left us to go to Spurs."
NUFC,3e69ac,congodude,2,Wed Jul 22 07:45:02 2015 UTC,"Probably wont be in the first team - with Mbemba signing, he will have him, colo and Saylor ahead of him and there is talk we also want Abdennour as well"

NUFC,3e69ac,Lord_Flashheart_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:20:43 2015 UTC,"Pardew was more than happy to blame young players for defeats, in amongst blaming fans for getting too excited and international players for being too foreign.  Maybe I'm wrong and I just have an exaggerated view of it. But off the top of my head, I think Edgar, Sammy, Shola, Alnwick, Ferguson, and possibly Ramage were all talented players who could've benefitted from a sensible loan and development policy rather than being hoyed in the first team for extended runs they couldn't cope with.  Obviously those aren't all from the Pardew reign of terror. I've never been convinced that our youth policy extends beyond ""magically find someone fucking amazing""."
NUFC,3e69ac,artical900,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:38:19 2015 UTC,"Very true.   ""Sensible Loan"" is something we know nothing of.

NUFC,3e69ac,Lord_Flashheart_,3,Wed Jul 22 11:58:20 2015 UTC,Has all the raw materials but he needs to play with someone experienced and someone who can lead him. He's promising but he should be loaned out to a high-end championship team

Then again, the scoreline could have been even more embarrassing if Aarons hadn't spanked two beautiful goals in late on in quick succession.  Bigi and Satka looked out of their depth, although to what extent that was due to the formation and facing up to fit opponents when neither of them was particularly match fit is uncertain. Darlow looked incredibly shaky for most of the game and arguably could have prevented the second Portland goal. Abeid had a pretty awful game as well.  Sissoko was trying but there was never anyone on the end of the ball. Cisse and Gouffran seemed content just to wander around aimlessly while Perez was getting outmuscled constantly. Wijnaldum scored then sort of disappeared which we'll put down to being a new member of the team.  I think there's still a fair bit of preparation to do..."

That's basically the equivalent of League One in America.  It's the third tier of soccer in the US.  Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I don't think so.  No matter what line-up we put out, we should have been running absolute circles around them.   This does not fill me with confidence.

A few times some of those players just turned from looking at one side of the field to the other. Then there's the young players who are supposed to be the eager ones, looking at you Bigi and Abeid. Satka was shaky, but it's the first ive seen him play so idk how he is normally. Ferguson, jesus.  Everyone ekse looked ok. Obviously, Señor Aarons looked pretty damn good. Thats it.

I hope he's just testing everyone we've got at the back to see if they are capable of it an quickly realising our current back four is hopeless.

Should we now pocket some defenders then this could be the best transfer window in recent memory.   What I also think is very important so far is that we have also kept all of our players bar the end of contract quintet. Even though Willo, Gouffran, Marveaux et al are not the standard we're after, it's important to have a squad with depth and those lads are good stop gaps when injuries and suspensions appear.

NUFC,3e1vp3,The_White_Django,7,Tue Jul 21 09:17:40 2015 UTC,"I actually can't believe that:   Michael Owen is still our most expensive transfer ever. We've only once spent above £10mil in the past 10 years (Coloccini, £10.3mil in 2008)"

NUFC,3e1vp3,WigglyParrot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:27:51 2015 UTC,Didn't Cabella cost £7-8m?
NUFC,3e1vp3,Toxic_Badger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:35:30 2015 UTC,it was £10-12m apparently.
NUFC,3e1vp3,Jackski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:50:38 2015 UTC,Thought it was £10mil exactly.
NUFC,3e1vp3,altern8tif,3,Tue Jul 21 10:56:32 2015 UTC,"Newcastle said it was £7m, the Montpellier chairman said it was just under £12m. Nobody knows for sure."
NUFC,3e1vp3,JimmySinner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:13:22 2015 UTC,I thought 12m
NUFC,3e1vp3,WigglyParrot,9,Tue Jul 21 10:59:33 2015 UTC,"First he was sneakily pictured wearing the shirt, now he is holding the shirt. That's good enough confirmation for me to finally celebrate."

NUFC,3e1vp3,charkoteow,6,Tue Jul 21 09:12:12 2015 UTC,I might actually be looking forward to next season...

NUFC,3e1vp3,banty86,3,Tue Jul 21 09:42:40 2015 UTC,"If we end up getting Mbemba plus another quality CB then we're going to be looking really good. Our midfield is deep and yeah, I know that Willo, Riviere, Colo, etc. disappointed last year but those guys will give us some good depth... something we severely lacked last season."
NUFC,3e1vp3,mrstat88,3,Tue Jul 21 09:52:21 2015 UTC,Excellent news.  And what a surprise EDS Amy is wrong again.
NUFC,3e1vp3,meganev,2,Tue Jul 21 09:09:19 2015 UTC,Who's that?
NUFC,3e1vp3,Disinformasiya,5,Tue Jul 21 09:28:36 2015 UTC,"Lass on twitter who spouts a load of transfer bullshit, and some people always believe her. Was claiming we wouldn't reveal Mitrovic till we had sorted Mbemba literally twenty minutes before Mitrovic was confirmed.   Just glad to see her look stupid as she's always running her mouth about how people only dismiss her as a source because she's a women (And former model)."
NUFC,3e1vp3,meganev,2,Tue Jul 21 09:45:52 2015 UTC,when is she ever right?

NUFC,3e1vp3,billsbackers66,3,Tue Jul 21 11:31:31 2015 UTC,Yeaaah baby!
NUFC,3e1vp3,rewindthegamer,3,Tue Jul 21 09:09:45 2015 UTC,"I know it's taken a while but these 2 signings are outstanding.. If we sign Mbemba, and another 2 defenders, and maybe the young defender from Barnsley and Ivan Toney.. I'd actually be happy with a transfer window..  I never thought I'd say that again."
NUFC,3e1vp3,WigglyParrot,3,Tue Jul 21 09:13:20 2015 UTC,Can't see more than 2 defenders coming in if I'm honest
NUFC,3e1vp3,magpie_army,2,Tue Jul 21 10:05:01 2015 UTC,"Realistically we need another CB and a LB cover and even a RB cover.. But I don't think we will go with it, with Colback and Anita being able to cover those positions."
NUFC,3e1vp3,WigglyParrot,2,Tue Jul 21 10:28:43 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, don't get me wrong I think we could do with as many as 4 or 5 defenders.  2 centre-backs and cover for both full-backs are holes we can and probably should fill.  Realistically, I see us getting Mbemba and maybe one more ""utility"" type defender."
NUFC,3e1vp3,magpie_army,4,Tue Jul 21 10:56:01 2015 UTC,I think Anita can be considered decent enough to be our cover for both LB and RB tbh.
NUFC,3e1vp3,GoalaAmeobi,2,Tue Jul 21 11:10:08 2015 UTC,"Finally, this dragged on. Now let's focus on defence where the weak link is obviously the cb situation. Then if we address that, a winger would be nice. Also getting rid of Gouffran, Obertan and Williamson would be great!"
NUFC,3e1vp3,Casual_Star,3,Tue Jul 21 09:15:38 2015 UTC,So this is what it feels like when your team spends a lot of money on players.
NUFC,3e1vp3,teasizzle,2,Tue Jul 21 09:42:43 2015 UTC,Hopefully this means we get mbemba as well! Fuck yeah!
NUFC,3e1vp3,Dasperuvian,2,Tue Jul 21 10:32:26 2015 UTC,"With this and Mbemba hopefully coming in as well, I'm quite happy already. Now, if (and I know its a small if) we get cover for the fullbacks I will be very happy and even optimistic for next season!"
NUFC,3e1vp3,why_pube,2,Tue Jul 21 10:52:10 2015 UTC,"Can't believe how good that little bit of news made me feel. 2 good signings and possibly a couple of defenders to come yet, first time I've felt Toon joy in a LONG time :)"
NUFC,3e1vp3,redmusic1,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:02 2015 UTC,I just woke up to this. I cant believe it. Everyday I have been getting up checking reddit to see if we have signed him or not !!! FINALLY

NUFC,3e2rjd,MICKEY_ROURKES_BALLS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:26 2015 UTC,Hopefully if we play Sissoko out wide he'll be able to get good deliveries into the box. Hopefully Wilnajdum can whip a decent ball in as well.

NUFC,3e3248,BrandonIPwN,3,Wed Jul 22 03:03:26 2015 UTC,We do have like four first team players on the pitch though. We're playing as much of a reserve side as they are.
NUFC,3e3248,lgf92,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:07:37 2015 UTC,I reckon a USL side in midseason stride is about the level of a (mostly reserve) pre-season premier league side.

They aren't even commentating the game, they're talking about ""T2"", and whenever our team is mentioned, it's that we're a ""Premeership"" side. We're more Championship than Premiership right now."
NUFC,3e3248,BrandonIPwN,2,Wed Jul 22 03:20:23 2015 UTC,It's higher quality than the Sacramento stream in terms of commentary but it's much more biased. The commentators do at least seem to know what they're talking about though as far as our players are concerned.

NUFC,3e3248,varl,5,Wed Jul 22 04:20:09 2015 UTC,It's my favourite wool retailer. Glad to hear them getting a shoutout.
NUFC,3e3248,lgf92,2,Wed Jul 22 04:21:39 2015 UTC,"First, the scandal of the missing scarves and no sound on stream. Then, the butchering of the names by the commentators. I wonder what brings today. Can't wait!"

NUFC,3e3248,KebabMaster,2,Wed Jul 22 02:08:09 2015 UTC,Hahaha... youtube chat disabled for this event. Guess the toxicity got to the American clubs (can't say I blame them)
NUFC,3e3248,scrugbyhk,2,Wed Jul 22 02:27:42 2015 UTC,"Well there's sound. Satka being our only defender on the pitch, we're either playing players out of postion or we're playing all attackers since its the Timbers' reserve team we're playing.   And I have literally no idea why they're busting out the national anthems"
NUFC,3e3248,thepresidentsturtle,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:29:11 2015 UTC,Ferguson is a left-back
NUFC,3e3248,KebabMaster,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:31:57 2015 UTC,Ah right. Thought he played left mid.

NUFC,3e3248,mrstat88,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:56:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah but those players are our reserves, or our 2nd team. This is just troubleshooting, seeing what works so I'm cutting them some slack"

NUFC,3e3248,spoonsforeggs,2,Wed Jul 22 03:40:07 2015 UTC,That shot by Gouffran was horrendous. He thinks he's good enough to hit it outside of the boot like that?! Terrible.

NUFC,3e3248,varl,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:41:33 2015 UTC,I know it's effectively reserves but need someone back there taking a little more charge of things. Had 3 players just watching the ball while the T2 player was charging in just before that free kick.

To be fair, half the team is signed to the Timbers first team and plays in USL for the game experience.   Also, it's your preseason--it means nothing except bragging rights and pride. I guarantee you Timbers 2 is playing for pride alone."

NUFC,3e3248,pastaisyellow,0,Wed Jul 22 04:05:22 2015 UTC,Our desperate need for quality upfront is clearly on display here... Perez and Cisse nowhere near that ball from Sissoko. Hopefully Mitrovic can bring some class to the side on that front.
NUFC,3e3248,BrandonIPwN,2,Wed Jul 22 04:09:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, we need a set of competent CB's more than anything. I'd rather us have 0-0 draws than conceding goals every single game. It's embarrassing how bad we are from set pieces."

NUFC,3e3248,AJBalmer,0,Wed Jul 22 03:12:53 2015 UTC,Well... our defense's organization is shit whether it's on set piece crosses or just regular crosses. I sure as hell hope that our starting defense doesn't turn out to be so bad.

NUFC,3e41kt,lafindumort,3,Tue Jul 21 20:06:38 2015 UTC,The ones that make me happy that we have signed him are the ones where he has shown a bit of composure when in a 1v1 situation. Too many times last season and previous seasons our strikers have messed them up time after time. Though I'll also say take them with a pinch of salt because I remember people raving over Luques compilations.
NUFC,3e41kt,RocknRollRobot9,2,Tue Jul 21 21:20:45 2015 UTC,Addition. He does look strong in the air so hopefully takes less time to adapt to the physical defending.
NUFC,3e41kt,RocknRollRobot9,2,Tue Jul 21 21:21:22 2015 UTC,I hope to see some goals scored from corners for the first time in years!

NUFC,3e3sv8,Geoffbot,3,Tue Jul 21 20:09:03 2015 UTC,Both of our signings got a TOTS
NUFC,3e3sv8,milk_over_spoons,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:35:51 2015 UTC,I'd probably have Colback a little higher. Other than that seems fair.

NUFC,3e3sv8,Zambre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:19 2015 UTC,"Cabella should have his potential go down a bit, while Aarons deserves more potential"
NUFC,3e2qai,ICameHereToDrinkMilk,5,Tue Jul 21 14:37:23 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly well, I reckon we'll be the underrated team of the league at least for the first half. A fair few people seem to have us pegged to go down, however I reckon the new coaching staff and the genuinely impressing signings will make a huge difference and the mistakes of last season will not be repeated. I reckon the new boys will take some time to settle into the premiership but once they find their feet they will light up the league. I see us pushing into the top 10 for sure. Janmaat will continue to cement himself as a class act and a leader on the pitch, wouldn't be surprised to see him captaining the club come end of the season. Perez will also continue to impress particularly now he won't be so heavily relied on as we build a more solid strike force. Colback will never be spectacular, but is a dependable graffer who will put in solid shifts all season. Quite a difficult question as for once we have a lot of options, at least in midfield. I reckon McClaren will really shake things up though."
NUFC,3e2qai,meganev,5,Tue Jul 21 15:44:44 2015 UTC,"It could scarcely go any worse than last season, that's for sure. Whilst I am cautiously optimistic with the two signings we have made so far, this is still a squad that was almost deservedly relegated. Only QPR (73) conceded more goals than us (63) last season, so I will remain concerned until we bring in an experienced head at centreback. As the adage goes, you need to spend money just to stay still in the Premier League - and I think a lot of clubs have made excellent acquisitions this summer. As such, I see us finishing in a solid midtable position. I think this will be a real breakthrough year for 19 year old winger, Rolando Aarons. His season was cut short by a number of injuries last year, but not before making a number of excellent contributions and he looks equally sharp this pre-season. He is adventurous, works hard and has pace in abundance. Given that we are seriously short on natural width, he should get plenty of pitch time.  Likely Lineup"
NUFC,3e2qai,res_evil,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"Great idea and I'm happy to contribute:  1. How do you think this season will go?     This season will depend on how the players react to the new coaching staff. McClaren seems to prefer more possession based football, which is the polar opposite to Pardew so the players may take a while to adapt. We should see less long balls and possession being held further up the pitch.  I think this is a transition season for Newcastle and we shouldn't expect miracles, but we should still be pushing for the top 10. I'm thinking 10th-8th and a half decent cup run is a reasonable prediction.   2. Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?   The obvious choice would be to go for the new signings, but I've got a feeling Cabella will really star this season. There's no doubting that he flattered to deceive a lot of the time last year. However you have to remember this was his first season in English football and he was working under Pardew and Carver who are not renowned for getting the best out of flair players. If McClaren can get the best out of Cabella I think we will see a lot more performances like Chelsea where he terrorised the best defence in the league.   3. How do you think the team will line up?   http://imgur.com/qCPQJnA"
NUFC,3e2qai,Shake_n_bake90,2,Tue Jul 21 15:51:01 2015 UTC,"1) Cautiously optimistic is the perfect phrase. We've got a new manager who's known to play decent football and we're bringing in top class talent. Our owner has finally shown some ambition after a horrible few years and he's promised we will actually try in cup competitions and is making the top 8 a target instead of narrowly avoiding relegation. Once we sign a new CB or two and as long as we can keep our stars fit and get Mitrovic and Wijnaldum up and running quickly I'm sure this can be a very successful season.  2) This is a difficult question, the player with the biggest potential is our most recent signing, Mitrovic. He's being touted as the next big thing and 36 goals in 69 appearances for Anderlecht is nothing to be scoffed at especially when you factor in that he's only 20 years old. Wijnaldum seems like a safer bet though, he captained PSV to the Eredivisie title last season and was one of their star players in the process.  He could give us that control in midfield we so desperately have lacked since Cabaye left last January.  3)                  Krul    Janmaat | Mbemba | Coloccini/? | Haidara          Colback | Wijnaldum     Perez | Sissoko/SDJ | Cabella             Mitrovic/Cisse"
NUFC,3e2qai,The_White_Django,3,Tue Jul 21 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"I'm feeling positive, which is a complete miracle given the compete apathy and soullessness felt at our lowest points last season (of which there were many). The signings of Wijnaldum and Mitrovic are very exciting, although I'm under no illusions that this is a quick fix. I said at the time as long as John Carver doesn't get us relegated there's no way I would regret Pardew's leaving, and despite JC's best efforts, we didn't. With the new backroom staff and the fresh ideas of young coach Ian Cathro, it seems the complete opposite of the boys club under Pards', which was exactly what we needed.  I feel Mitrovic just because it's pretty crazy up here as it is, so adding someone of his character who can also score goals is a match made in heaven. Hopefully Ayoze continues to develop, and Rolando Aarons looks like he could be a real talent on the wing. Looking forward to having some creativity in the center with Wijnaldum too, something we've been sorely missing since Cabaye left.   3.                            Mitrovic       Perez                 De Jong            Sissoko                                Wijnaldum                     Colback       Haidara       Collocini       Mbemba      Janmaat                             Krul   I can see us lining up something like that, we still desperately need to sign two CB's, Mbemba is supposedly coming and Colo and Williamson really should've moved on by now. Mbemba, ?, S. Taylor, Lascelles and Dummett if we need as cover should be enough, but we could probably do with holding onto Colo as cover for his final year. Cabella also an option on the left when he's back from injury, as is Rolando Aarons. We've got decent attacking options now, if we can sort out our atrocious defense we could be a half decent football team."
NUFC,3e2qai,TradedAJeepForAPecan,3,Tue Jul 21 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"1) Even if we didnt make the signings we have done next season would still have gone better than last. For all the drama surounding Pardew, Carver and Ashley what really hurt us was injuries. We had, when you factor in the lack of depth of our squad, the worst jnjury crisis in the league. Only a couple teams had more injuries or more cumulative days spent out injured than us. Add to this key suspensions we suffered (Cisse), and no manager in the world could have saved us. People forget how many games Krul and Elliot (who was shit anyway) missed. Siem De Jong aas our big signing last year and he missed most of the season due to bizarre injuries (collapsed lung ffs).  When you factor in a new manager (the only english manager who has won any major league in the last 15 years) and added depth then top ten should be the minimum realistic expection. Weve got Darlow as a backup keeper, Lascelles as another CB (possibly starting), W- in midfield, and Mitrovic up top. All we need is another CB. If we get a CB and another striker then we are going to suprise a lot of teams.  2) star of the season is a tough one, but if anyone striker (Mitrovic or Cisse or a New striker) can stay fit and score then they will be the star. Perez will have a deeper role. Janmaat is always solid, as is Krul (despite poor distribution), and Colback doesnt get the credit he deserves but is not flashy enough to call a star.   3) hard to tell but nailed on at this point i think are RB:Janmaat CB: Colo CB: Taylor/Lascelles/Dummet/new CB LB: Haidara CM: Colback CM: Wij- ST: Mitrovic.  We also have Tiote, De Jong, Sissoko, Abeid, as potential CM (Sissoko could also play on the wings along with W- , Aarons, Perez, Goufran and Obertan). I think itll be a couple months before we get a solid starting 11 week in and wewk out."
NUFC,3e2qai,StonedCrow,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"After last season I wasn't looking forward to how things might go in the transfer window but I've been surprised, two big signings so far who will definitley improve the team. However I still feel we could drop more points towards the end of the season, I predict us finishing 12-13th, higher if we sign the right defence. I would love to see Aarons shine this season, he was looking that way last year until the injury and he could again if he keeps fit, I could see De Jong being the star also, as many people said he'll feel like a new signing and I can see him being impressive. No idea so far but It looks like it's going to be a 4-2-3-1 with Wijnaldum in midfield and possibly Sissoko or De Jong playing as AM, Wouldn't be surprised at all if this changes towards the end of the season, a 4-3-3 maybe?"
NUFC,3e2qai,risealive,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:38 2015 UTC,"I think we’ll start off pretty poorly; a new philosophy has to be bedded in and by entirely new staff and by the time our transfer dealings are done it’ll be a group of players fairly unfamiliar with one another. However I think we’ll have a strong turn of the year and by March or April be pushing for the Europa League spots. I think Mclaren is a fundamentally strong coach and when he has the players clued up we’ll be playing some nice stuff. Though do still expect some defensive howlers, he isn’t a miracle worker A lot of people would answer Rolando Aarons to this one. From what little we’ve seen of him (injured for most of last season) he’s at least as developed as some fairly hyped players like Grealish or Ibe when it comes to decisions, technique, touch and pace. I think he’ll end up being key in our likely 4-2-3-1. My pick though is Wijnaldum, I think little things like fluent English and having Janmaat, Krul, SDJ and Anita at the club already will help him gel really quickly and by all PSV fan accounts the lad's a superstar I think either this 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3 variant of it with a flat 3 in midfield. Hard to say until our transfer dealings are done though."
NUFC,3e2qai,electricyesterday,3,Tue Jul 21 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"How do you think this season will go? (100 words max.)   I'm hopeful. If we can add Mbemba, another CB, and go from there then I think we could do very very well. I think McClaren is a far better manager tactically than Pardew, and i'll think him and our new coaching staff will do a far better job than the previous guys of integrating youth and creating a winning formula.   Which player is going to be your star of the season and why? (100 words max)   Overall - Daryl Janmaat. Along with Ayoze the only player last year to come out with real credit. Quality footballer and a great personality for the new yougner signings to learn from.  Breakthrough - I think Aarons, if he stays fit, will be a great player this year. Looks to have it all. Buzzing to see him progress.   How do you think the team will line up? Banking on us signing Mbemba and another CB   Krul  Janmaat - Mbemba - New CB - Haidara  Colback/Anita - Wijnaldum  Sissoko - De Jong - Cabella/Aarons  Mitrovic/Cisse"
NUFC,3e2qai,Bidwell93,5,Tue Jul 21 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"I think you'd be hard pressed to find many fans as negative as we were last season; the last week has changed that. The signings of Wijnaldum and Mitrovic are the third and fourth highest sums we've ever paid for players, and whilst it's no guarantee of success, that's not the be all and end all: we just want a little ambition, and these two signings show at least a smidgen of that. With the roster as it is, it could be either of the new signings - one a Dutch title-winning captain (the second of those we have, with de Jong the first) and the other an exciting young talent who's got Champions League experience - but for consistency from last season, likely someone like Janmaat will keep our season ticking over and fight when the going gets tough. The guys we can depend on are the ones we love when things take a nosedive - something we're quite used to. Possibly like this, but with some caveats. We're hoping to sign Mbemba from Anderlecht, who would replace Lascelles, or whichever of the other sub-standard options we have there. Aarons likely won't start the season in the starting 11, but injuries willing, will probably make it his own. He's a canny lad, that one. Him and Perez are exciting young prospects and no mistake. Any signings beyond that (we all want Charlie Austin) could change things significantly, but other than that, fairly standard. Whether Cheick Tiote makes a return to form will have a effect on Colback's place in the team, but it makes for a solid bench either way. Sissoko is a difficult one to place; he should be in centre midfield, but performs a similar role to Wijnaldum. Could go right wing? Not really sure."
NUFC,3e2qai,Disinformasiya,6,Tue Jul 21 15:29:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll have as bad a season as last. The squads better than the results suggested and I think alot of it came down to morale/lack of respect for Carver/nothing to play for. We're cautiously optimistic over here about the forthcoming season. The signings we're making and are rumoured for (Mbebma!) look a real cut above what we usually go for & along with De Jong back from injury & quality prospects Perez & Aarons it's rather exciting times. That said Ashley always manages something to hurt the fans and it typically comes after a high like this. Janmaat. I really wanted to say De Jong here because I think he'll be our most influential and commanding player, however I just can't see him lasting the season without major injury/setback. I don't know enough about Wijnaldum yet so I've gone with Janmaat. Agreed by the majority of the fans our best player last season. We had a topic recently on /r/nufc about who we'd have as captain and he edged out De Jong. Very solid and even an upgrade from Debuchy which was a pleasant suprise. He was the one encouraging players to visit and appluad the away fans after our many pummelings despite being one of the newer aquisitions. Lineupbuilder is over capacity so I'll just list the likely lineup. Feel free to edit any of this as I think I may have edged over 100 words. Note this isn't the lineup I necessarily want but what I think will happen. Cabella to replace Aarons/Perez when fit.   4-2-3-1 GK Krul, LB Haidara, CB Willo/Mbebma, CB Colo, RB Janmaat, Colback, Wijnaldum, LW Perez/Aarons, 10 De Jong, RW Sissoko, ST Cisse/Mitrovic"

We were absolutely ""raped"" (to use Pardews preffered terminology) by injuries last season - which left us useing our shite 3rd string keeper and Perez as striker (thrown into the first team when he was meant to develope first). Plus we lost out on our marqee signing in De Jong due to impossible to prevent fluke injuries (a collapsed lung ffs).  Edit: just to emphasize my point regarding injuries  we won the injury league"

NUFC,3e2qai,Ionicfold,3,Tue Jul 21 23:19:11 2015 UTC,"I am cautiously optimistic about this season. But I think our success will depend highly on bringing at least two quality centre backs. In attack we've got some serious talent that could be unlocked in the right system. At the back, we are relegation material currently. There are players in the team who at times have been touted as ""Champions League material"" like Sissoko, Tiote, De Jong and Wijnaldum. Along with some big transfer fees like Cabella and Mitrovic that will need to prove their worth. Players like Colback, Krul and Janmaat will never be the stars but they're the real foundations to the team. If I was going to pick a star I think Wijnaldum, based on absolutely nothing other than price tag and position. I don't think he'll stay with us long. Not a clue currently, lots of variables and options in attack. Krul in goal, back four in front of him and then Big Stevie Mac can work his umbrella magic."

NUFC,3e27tt,chuddys_revenge,5,Tue Jul 21 12:07:20 2015 UTC,Please explain how he isn't worth 15 million in today's market?   Looked class to me last season.  Seems to me if he was a fairly unknown foreign striker unproven in the pl this sub would be wanking themselves daft over him.   Worth the asking price ALL day long
NUFC,3e27tt,Stuattravs,3,Tue Jul 21 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"Sure, try and find another 26 year old with one year left on his deal worth £15m. QPR are in a really shitty negotiating position, they have to sell now or lose him on a free. Delph still had four years and look how much he went for. On top of that, Austin is an injury risk, which brings his price down further. Look at Danny Welbeck last season, he went for £16m? He was three years younger, with longer on his deal, and had more PL experience.  I'm not even taking into account his ability as a player here. If we accept he's worth £15m now, that means with a longer contract and better injury record (improving QPR's negotiating position), they'd be demanding £20-30m for him, which is clearly bollocks he's not worth that on ability alone. You could maybe argue he's worth the £15m purely on ability, but in today's market given his circumstances, he's not.  That's just his general value as a player. In terms of his specific value to us, I think he's worth even less because he's worse than Cisse. His one benefit is that he's younger. Yes he's got 18 goals in a season, but Cisse scores way more frequently, and is much less dependent on getting his goals from set pieces (which we're terrible at and don't put any emphasis on). Cisse actually scored more goals than Austin from open play last season despite only being on the pitch nearly a third of the time Austin was. Austin gets a lot of hype because he's English and everyone can keep bringing up his one stat, a stat with isn't worth shit to anyone even slightly competent with statistics.  We're excited about Mitrovic not because of how good he is now, but because of how good he could become. A hefty chunk of his price tag was because of his age, nobody thinks he's worth £13m on ability alone. His circumstances push his price up, Austin's should push it down."
NUFC,3e27tt,chuddys_revenge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"Ok first up, QPR just happen to be one of the only clubs in the country that don't seem to care about spunking money up against the wall and have one of the richest owners in Europe ie no pressure to sell.  Delph had an 8 million buy out clause so time remaining on contract has no factor.  As for Welbeck.... Really..... His stats bar England are woefull.   To be totally honest I haven't really taken the stats into consideration like you clearly have I'm just going on what I've actually seen,  whenever I seen Austin play he always played well (goals aside) can you really say the same about Cisse?  Plus he did this in by far the worst team in the league.   The set piece issue hopefully was a coaching issue, you can't just give up on it and sign players that don't rely on crosses and corners (which by the way the new lad seems to)   I'm sure Mitrovic will be an excellent signing and it's really got me lifted from the absolute rock bottom of last season, but the fact is half the people on the sub/twitter/Facebook haven't seen anything of him apart from YouTube clips (looking at you luque),  I guess what I'm trying to get at is why not just take a chance with a young English lad who scores goals? Regardless of the bottom line and costs involved which to be fair I couldn't give 2 Fucks about."
NUFC,3e27tt,Stuattravs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:44:08 2015 UTC,"When I watch Austin play, I really don't like him, I genuinely prefer Cisse stats aside. But that's subjective, my individual impression of him doesn't impact my assessment of his worth. Your argument is based off the assumption that QPR value their money less than other teams do. If that's true, so be it, but they still have FFP to think about, last time they went down it fucked them, although admittedly they're in a better situation now.  If QPR don't care about the money, maybe he's worth £15m to them. But not to anyone else because they do and that's not the going rate for players in his position in the market. QPR are essentially paying > £12m to retain his services for one season of the Championship at this point. If they don't sell it's an incredibly stupid decision on their part.  Welbeck at the time of sale had better stats than Austin does now, despite rarely being used as the main centre forward.  Mitrovic does score a lot from crosses, you're right, but also a lot more from open play. Being younger he's also much more coachable than Austin, has more room to grow and a higher ceiling. He's not a complete unknown either, He had 7 apps in Europe last season where he did well, against tougher opposition than your average PL team and despite being on by far the worst team. I'd guess most of this sub saw the Arsenal game."

NUFC,3e27tt,Lord_Flashheart_,6,Tue Jul 21 12:29:50 2015 UTC,"It's gotta be Villa surely with that Benteke money? I doubt Palace have another 12-15 mill signing in them after Cabaye and West Ham have already spent 30 Mill(ish) and seem pretty keen on Hernandez.  I'm happy with Mitro, Cisse, Perez and Riv as our attacking options. I only see us getting Austin if the rumours of Cisse being shipped out are true and they drop the fee a bit. I'm sure Cisse's dodgy knee cap and the lack of experience of the other three are a concern for Steve. Not a massive one mind, defenders is surely the priority now."

Once we started playing him with ayoze he started banging in the goals again.. Although Injury and suspension hindered him. 11 goals in as many starts is pretty good for the EPL.   He supposedly had his knee fixed at the end of last season so fingers crossed. If anything I'd like to see riviere shipped out for Austin.
NUFC,3e27tt,Lord_Flashheart_,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe... when fully completely injury free but given his past record and his age most would see him as unlikely to be getting any better. Disciplinary record for last season drags him down too. We know he's not a dirty cunt collecting cards like there's Pokemon on them, but it's hard to argue with the record last year.  Even despite all that I think 10mil is pushing it for a very 1 dimensional player. Cracking poacher, useless lone striker and horrible target man. Everything besides his shooting/heading is lacking too much to push him over 10mil in my opinion. Again, I fucking love him so I'm not being harsh for the sake of it."
NUFC,3e27tt,ButtGardener,2,Tue Jul 21 15:19:30 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  I love the guy too, I always hope he can rekindle the form he had when he was scoring ridiculous goals like the one against Chelsea."
NUFC,3e27tt,Lord_Flashheart_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:04 2015 UTC,I'd argue it's more the team that needs to find that form again than him. He missed a few sitters last year but his conversion rate is still bloody good. He's just not getting Cabaye's through balls and Jonas' crosses 10 times a match any more.  Should be interesting to see how McClaren uses him if he stays.
NUFC,3e27tt,ButtGardener,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"I fully expect him to be our backup if he stays. I'd expect the main duo to be mitro and ayoze.. Maybe Steve has a different formation,  would be great to see all 3 play at once."
NUFC,3e27tt,HannibalDolomite,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:56 2015 UTC,"2 years left on his contract, so whilst not at the 'height' of his value, its still pretty high, and had the best goals to minutes ratio in Europe last season.   Besiktas also have 10m from Demba Ba sale so they can bloody give it straight to us"

Edit: I'm extremely dubious of this claim. Here is a picture of him from 2006 playing for his first professional team. His birthday is listed as 8-8-88 which would make him 17, which seems likely. If we believe he is twenty now, that means he is 11 in that photo. That looks like an extremely well-developed 11.  Edit 2: Found this article in French which describes the fraud committed by Paulo Teixeira as an agent for smaller Congolese clubs attempting to fleece clubs through falsified documents."

The Old Ashley never spent any money and only bought in young players with resale value The ""New"" Ashley shells out money for Wijnaldum and Mitrovic but he isn't quite ready to buy a player who is above 26... (example Cabaye) So he figures out this ingenious plan to buy a guy who looks 40 is listed as 20 But is probably 26. So he can break his duck on an older player but still say he is only signing younger players.  Bravo Mike Ashley Bravo"

NUFC,3dxdu4,Positive_Rage,6,Mon Jul 20 11:13:00 2015 UTC,"Tiote  Anita  Colback  Wijnaldum  Sissoko  SDJ  I can see why he might want to leave with all of those in front of him, and it makes sense why we want to sell him now as he will be on a free next summer. Shame though, but its understandable from both sides of the coin and its nice to have a selection of good midfielders to choose from"
NUFC,3dxdu4,nufcmuse,16,Mon Jul 20 09:15:23 2015 UTC,"It'd be Tiote to go out of those, for me. I quite like Abeid."
NUFC,3dxdu4,Hollea,2,Mon Jul 20 09:24:17 2015 UTC,"Tiote is much better than Abeid tbf, and I love Abeid. Wouldnt surprise me if Tiote goes as well though and we bring in another midfielder."
NUFC,3dxdu4,kulart,10,Mon Jul 20 09:29:39 2015 UTC,"The issue with Tiote is he seems to always be playing on a knife-edge. He always seems to pick up silly yellows that then limit his ability to influence the match afterwards.  While Tiote was exceptional for a time while partnered by Cabaye, I believe there's a reason no-one's been interested in him since. I'd much rather keep Abeid who's shown to be improving than Tiote who has stagnated and gotten worse since we finished 5th."
NUFC,3dxdu4,Hollea,5,Mon Jul 20 09:52:59 2015 UTC,"The thing with Tiote is that we need a player like that in the squad. As McClaren said, when you play bigger teams you need a destroyer to protect the defence and as Twente were one of the biggest teams (and went on to win the league) he was only really required in 5-6 games a season.  We however are not one of the biggest teams (yet ;) ) so will need a destroyer for a good 10-14 games in the season and we dont really have anybody else in the squad who can fill that role.   For me, Abeid doesnt really have a set midfield style and while the versatility is useful, its not the dedicated DM that we will need. Anita cant do it really, and Colback doesnt seem to have the defensive awareness for me.   Plus, we will want to move on at least one midfielder and if it is between Abeid and Tiote, we can only sell the one that has interest which appears to be Mehdi"
NUFC,3dxdu4,chuddys_revenge,4,Mon Jul 20 10:11:34 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from but I simply see Tiote as a liability these days rather than a solution. From the last outings when he was injury-free he seemed overwhelmed.  He keeps playing completely bonkers mad passes and tackling like a one-legged figureskater.   On his day he is a great player for us, but for me it seems injuries have ruined him quite a bit. Also took a hit with Cabaye leaving.  If we could get a decent price for him now I'd sell in a heartbeat. Shame really, because Tiote from a few seasons ago was an absolute beast, commanded respect from pretty much every player in the league. Some games looked like a black Roy Keane."
NUFC,3dxdu4,chuddys_revenge,3,Mon Jul 20 11:15:13 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree with you completely for the need to have that type of player in the team, I just don't really want it to be Tiote.   I'd prefer a more level-headed player to be doing that role not one that gets carried away - not just by doing heavy or pointless tackles but also listening to the calls of shoot from the crowd every 5 minutes. Yes he scored against Arsenal and City but what about the other ~110 games? (He's probably around that many apps for us I'm assuming?).  My main worry is that I feel Tiote is a shadow of what he once was and that McClaren is keeping him because of their time together at Twente and it would be far easier to form a competent midfield with what we now have if we had a defensive mid that could actually pass the ball.  Regardless I think moving Abeid on over others would be a mistake but that's only my opinion."

NUFC,3dxdu4,justmadman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:10:59 2015 UTC,"Well, at Panathinaikos he played as an attacking midfielder and this season he was either a defensive or box to box/central midfielder so presumably he is comfortable in those roles. There is a minimum of 1 player ahead of him in each position.   Im not sure why im arguing about him going, I love the wee bastard haha - I can just see it making sense (also he wants out according to a greek interview he did http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/454837/Montpellier-Lille-Newcastle-Mehdi-Abeid"

I seemed to remember he did have a run of 10 games or so in 12/13 season and there was a game against Arsenal where he run the show. I'm sure he actually finished top assister that season?   If McClaren can get him playing close to his potential he is better back up than Obertan and Gouffran."

Having said that, he is out until 14th Sep 15 so I guess he will be with us until January unless we release him on a free now and pay out his contract"
NUFC,3dxe14,HannibalDolomite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:28:20 2015 UTC,"Injuries are his main issue. I don't know what wages he is on but very much doubt he's on 50k, we may have snatched him from Liverpool but he still wasn't a household name and I'm sure Colo (the captain and established Argentinian international) is on like 60k.  Either way for purely football reasons id keep him a head of Obertan. Jus checking out his stats Marv has 3 goals and 9 assists in his Newcastle career. Weirdly Obertan also has 3 goals and 9 assists in nearly double the amount of games. Most of Marvs appearances are from the bench as well."
NUFC,3dxe14,Shake_n_bake90,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:47:51 2015 UTC,If he was on that much we'd have bundled him out the door well before now.  I imagine we'd have seen the odd newspaper story about potential deals for him if we were trying to sell him or negotiate a new contract (If his agent is actually earning their wage).  Most likely we're waiting to see what McClaren thinks of him before making a decision. If he goes I think it'll be close to the deadline.

NUFC,3dvwvi,King_Of_Geese,20,Sun Jul 19 23:45:46 2015 UTC,"What's frustrating for me about Willo is that he was preferred over Mbiwa, despite Willo clearly being the inferior player. Mbiwa never seemed settled and was never given a decent run in the squad, despite coming from another league entirely. He was captain of a championship winning team in France, and now he's a regular starter for Roma, who are playing in the Champions league and should be a team that will challenge Juve for the Scudetto.   So my problem is not so much with Willo, who for me is a model professional, but for the fact that Pardew and Carver constantly selected him over Mbiwa because of some stupid backwards logic that I still don't quite understand. This of course meant that Newcastle squandered the opportunity of having a player who could have grown to become an extremely talented and valuable member of the squad, which I believe he would be now were he given a decent chance at this club."

He is in and out of their team, he's inconsistent, he's had solid spells, he was apparently terrible with Cole at left back next to him and has generally been a good back-up player. The potential is there, but also a lot of doubts.  Everybody talks about him on here as though we let a future John Terry go or something. I can't understand why we let him go, the fee baffled me and the fact it left the squad thin made no sense, but I personally wasn't convinced he would turn into a starting center back.

NUFC,3dvwvi,Daxxtoon,9,Mon Jul 20 06:28:24 2015 UTC,"No he doesnt get unfair criticism. He gets criticised for not being good enough to be used in the team, especially as a starter, which you have pretty much said when you said he probably shouldnt even be the 4th choice centre back. Your argument against the criticism is essantially that he doesnt look as bad when you focus on smaller sample sizes in terms of his performances. And his nationality should not be a reason for him to avoid criticism and keep his place in the team.  This is not a case of Williamson getting unfair criticism, you just feel sorry for him for it. You cant pretend the criticism is unfair because everyone is able to come to the same conclusion watching him. If anything, it means that the opposite is true."
NUFC,3dvwvi,blackandwhitearmy,3,Mon Jul 20 00:40:17 2015 UTC,"Not even fourth choice? That's so close to what everyone else is saying. In other words, if we get one more competent CB, he should go. This is exactly what I would like to happen!"
NUFC,3dvwvi,HannibalDolomite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:22:18 2015 UTC,I mean not fourth if we bring someone in. I'm assuming Lascelles is better from what people are saying but I've never seen him play outside of a friendly.
NUFC,3dvwvi,MeancupofJoey,3,Mon Jul 20 01:48:04 2015 UTC,"Its not his fault he is still here and getting game time. Thats a failing of the club. I dont think he will be here for the start of the season, its time for him to move on but it will be with best wishes as he hasnt been a dickhead or anything like that. He just isnt the quality we need and I would rather Satka or Good got that spot as 5th choice"
NUFC,3dvwvi,Bmoreisapunkrocktown,6,Mon Jul 20 08:18:16 2015 UTC,"I thought Mike Williamson recieved to much criticism too, he wasn't the worst backup and I also appreciated the time he put in with the toon. Until I went to the NUFC game in Milwaukee. Wilo was under shite! I can't believe he makes a living doing this, I don't know if we should get rid of him but he should never seen the pitch in the black and white again!"

NUFC,3dvwvi,ChangMai,3,Sun Jul 19 23:56:42 2015 UTC,"You are not the only one.  I don't mind Williamson as much as everyone else seems to.  I think that with the right manager he could be not awful, and I hope to see that."

NUFC,3dvwvi,kicka11,5,Sun Jul 19 23:53:46 2015 UTC,"I will go on record as saying he wasnt good enough about two or three years ago.  It's blatantly obvious. He costs us goals single handedly with his poor decision making, appalling strength and terrible, ill-timed challenges.  He's shit."
NUFC,3dvwvi,blurgtheamoeba,2,Mon Jul 20 06:25:29 2015 UTC,I think almost everyone did. Very short memories around here.
NUFC,3dvwvi,dwafy,2,Mon Jul 20 10:27:05 2015 UTC,"If we're being honest he's not the worst player to ever play for the club in the premier league (probably only bottom 5). But the statistic you quote is the damning one - he's played so many games for us. He is inept and technically poor, it's an indictment that successive managers keep thinking he can do a job.   I always say he's the worst player I've seen who has played more than 100 games for the club. Should have been moved after 50 at the most."
NUFC,3dvwvi,ThisBlackSmurf,2,Mon Jul 20 07:22:07 2015 UTC,"Agree with you about Mike, but not about Riviere. I think he's a trier and is worth keeping around, especially if we lose cisse. But his finishing's the worst i've seen of any striker in black and white who's had a decent run in the side."
NUFC,3dvwvi,ThatBoyConk,2,Mon Jul 20 07:38:53 2015 UTC,"i semi agree on the riviere. give him enough time, maybe use as a sub for a bit, get him to fight harder for his place, he'll get there. williamson, on the other hand, is a championship player at best. I've thought this since the 2012/13 campaign. he's always been pish in set pieces, while others were basically able to defend them well, though we have been declining in that department since the aforementioned campaign. Either way, his style is too clunky, his ball control is average at best, poor decision making and he is shit scared of pushing futher forward, which, when paired with colo, can make for poor offensive line (colo also liking to stay back too). his partnership with yanga was his best time I'll concede, but other than that he's simply just not good enough for 1st team action. If we had good depth i'd say get rid, he's dead weight, but you do have a point. (defensive) depth is pretty poor atm, so for this season he probably should stay, but not in the 1st team. knowing us we'll get abdennor and mbemba and both will break their arms signing the contracts. maybe even a couple cheeky collapsed lungs n all. i want him out by next season mind"

NUFC,3dvwvi,Positive_Rage,2,Tue Jul 21 13:09:45 2015 UTC,Mike Williamson is only good at 2 things 1) Passing the Ball Backwards 2) Shitting the Bed
NUFC,3dvwvi,beatski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:31 2015 UTC,"Williamson should never play for us again, he is appalling.  His best aspect is his heading ability and even that is a good 3/10. It's a disgrace he has played so many games for a Premier League club. No other team would be stupid enough to have kept him this long. He is worse than Bramble and maybe on par with Boumsong.  Would love some poor soul to watch every game WIlliamson has played and tally up how many goals Williamson has directly caused or been awful for.  He is part of a defence that has one of the worst conceding records in the past few years in the league. There is nothing good about him and he has had a good 120 games too many with us."
NUFC,3duoed,jesusche,9,Sun Jul 19 17:28:29 2015 UTC,Rolando Aarons was definitely man of the match for me. I was at the game too and close to the left side he was dominating late on in the game. Every time he got the ball he did Sacramento's right back and almost had a goal and an assist. Without the red card I think the final score could have been 2-0 or 3-0
NUFC,3duoed,Quakes98,4,Sun Jul 19 17:46:06 2015 UTC,"Good report and pleased you got to see them play. Sounded like Woodman raised his profile again and Willo just staggers on, forever, like a sub-Sholan albatross around NUFC's neck."
NUFC,3duoed,kicka11,2,Sun Jul 19 19:22:47 2015 UTC,"It was nice to see the lads again, it had been awhile for me. Also, as impotent as the attack is right now, it was almost strange to see them play with an actual stye/plan/something-other-than-sloppy-counterattacks."

NUFC,3duoed,HannibalDolomite,2,Sun Jul 19 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"I'm glad we are giving game time top everyone in the squad, it shows that's McClaren is giving everyone a fair chance before making a decision on them. I had Anita down as being finished with us but it seems that he will turn it around. I think Willo is the only one certain to be off (although we will need to sell a few others if we are planning many more deals due to the 25 man squad size)"
NUFC,3duoed,KebabMaster,2,Sun Jul 19 18:45:49 2015 UTC,Woodman looked really good

NUFC,3duoed,tylerwhetstone,4,Sun Jul 19 19:36:11 2015 UTC,"tough to say because they were playing a team at a much lower level, but his footwork on the left wing was truly outstanding"
NUFC,3duoed,RealBrutus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:43 2015 UTC,Pretty spot on about everyone. I sent a message to my mates after the game last night saying by the end of the year Rolando Aarons could be the best player on our squad. He certainly already looks the part.

NUFC,3duoed,xMythicKillax,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:12:02 2015 UTC,"Just to nit pick on Cisse in that game, I thought his runs in the box were awful. There were plenty times we got the cross in and he would just stand on the penalty spot, no darting near post or back post runs and it made it easy to mark him/clear the ball. Such a change from when he first came i can think of plenty goals he scored from clever incisive runs in the penalty box."
NUFC,3duoed,blackandwhitearmy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"I was also at the game. It was a poor showing for us, obviously, but we were well aware of the pre-season setting. The supporter section was where it was at. The regulars sang the entire time, and we had some good laughs. Hopefully, we inspired the hosts to up their game. Except for a couple of drummers, the locals were quiet.  I was most disappointed by how few chances we created. We had good possession and brought the ball up without too much trouble, but nobody knows what to do next. Obertan was particularly frustrating, as he outran his defender multiple times, but couldn't deliver a good cross nor cut inside and create a shot for someone.  Logically, De Jong, and later Mitrovic, should add something to the attack this year, but we did not get a chance to see it. Nevertheless, I hope this isn't the last time we see them in the states. Come back to California, Newcastle! We love the Toon!"

NUFC,3dv7e2,thetruth3402,5,Sun Jul 19 20:08:43 2015 UTC,Abdennour and Mbemba seems a monster pairing. The mature leadership of Abdennour with the athletic and quick Mbemba would be terrific but they are both African and having them both of to the AFCON would hurt. I think we will only get one and wait for another transfer window to get the right pairing.
NUFC,3dv7e2,wonderLanddd,4,Sun Jul 19 20:51:56 2015 UTC,I'd be over the moon with Abdennour and Mbemba but I can't see us getting them both as well as Ausitn
NUFC,3dv7e2,GoalaAmeobi,5,Sun Jul 19 20:12:20 2015 UTC,Id rather have both them in the door and forget about Austin given the choice
NUFC,3dv7e2,banty86,4,Mon Jul 20 08:36:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately with Abdennour I doubt we'll be as liberal with his wages as he'd probably like. I would imagine Monaco are paying him a fair bit# but the PL tends to have quite a good pull with players so I imagine his interest is genuine so I suppose there is a chance.  That being said, Mitrovic, Wijnaldum, Abdennour and Mbemba would give me some degree of faith for the new season.   Still think we're short at FB beyond Janmaat and shipping off Santon and M'biwa was a waste."
NUFC,3dv7e2,Hollea,3,Sun Jul 19 20:16:21 2015 UTC,You heard that Inter are apparently trying to get rid of Santon? would you take him back? I definitely would.
NUFC,3dv7e2,GoalaAmeobi,6,Sun Jul 19 20:19:12 2015 UTC,I thought getting rid of him made no sense in the first place so I'd take him back in a hearbeat. He's hardly Maldini but I'd much rather have him starting at LB over Haidara/Dummet. He was also by all accounts quite fond of the club/city.  I still don't understand the transfer anyway. We hardly made bank on him and I wouldn't be suprised if we made a loss yet we'd probably have to spend more to find a competent replacement.
NUFC,3dv7e2,Hollea,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember his lass saying on twitter that he wanted to stay here because they have a kid and all that. I hope we take him back, he can play on either side so he'd make great cover for janmaat too."
NUFC,3dv7e2,GoalaAmeobi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:48:31 2015 UTC,"There must be something wrong with him, injury concern on knee or some other reason he was let go for cheap. Then Inter want rid of him. I really, enjoyed him but I guess we should listen to the hierarchy on this one and move on."
NUFC,3dv7e2,wonderLanddd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:50:05 2015 UTC,"I suppose an injury issue is possible but then again I don't imagine Haidara's going to have a spotless injury record as a result of the Mcmanaman tackle, could easily have a weakness there.  My issue with listening to the hierarchy is that normally when we do that they promptly screw us over. 1 and now possibly 2 relatively big signings doesn't redeem Mike Ashley for how he's messed us around for years."
NUFC,3dv7e2,Hollea,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:58:48 2015 UTC,"I am definitely on the boat for a new left back. I am not against waiting and given Haidara his chance but I think we need to upgrade sooner than later, tho.   If we continue to buy these $10-15 mill players then McClaren is right in doing it over three windows. As long as we can see steady progress then I can have patience."
NUFC,3dv7e2,wonderLanddd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:32:36 2015 UTC,"I'm with you 100%. I've not been impressed at all with Haidara in these friendlies. His defending has been ok, minus the kung-fu kick, but in attack he reminds me a lot of Sammy in that he charges full speed into these narrow corridors and then doesn't know what to do with the ball when he gets there. He also seems to force crosses into the box, even when no one is in position to receive it.    I'd like a left back with a bit more experience and intelligence. I wonder if Chelsea would consider selling us Filipe Luis?"
NUFC,3dv7e2,wonderLanddd,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:38 2015 UTC,"Haidara would ideally be a back up and force his way into the team if good enough. Luis or Rodriquez, Willems would be the dream or that Napoli dude. That said, Haidara won't get us relegated so for the time being. This is his last chance to show us something. We do need some crossing with Mitrovic in the box. We seem to have some powerful players but lack a ball passing players in most positions."
NUFC,3dv7e2,rooparoop,3,Mon Jul 20 01:39:32 2015 UTC,Felipe Luis and Ricardo Rodriguez are two of the best fullbacks in the world right now - no chance either are coming to newcastle.

I don't say this lightly, but he reminds me a lot of the young Vincent Kompany that we had. Mbemba has less flair but makes up in consistency. Any price below 15 million is a steal btw. We hold a poll after every game to decide the best player every season. Mitrovic came in first, Mbemba second (but Mbemba missed a lot of games due to the Africa cup where he also played very well and subsequently because of an injury that aggravated because our coach HAD to play him every game). I'll sure be watching Newcastle's games next season."

I still think we will look to sign a senior CB to start this season alongside Coloccini (despite his shortcomings). The contracts of Taylor, Williamson and Coloccini are all up next summer and it seems unlikely any will be kept on - so I think its only right to start addressing that now. Mbemba I suspect will be given the year to adapt to the league; from the admittedly little I have seen of him he looks quite raw. Likewise with Lascelles."
NUFC,3dv4us,AlphaPot,6,Sun Jul 19 19:47:00 2015 UTC,If we were to get a striker and a CB in the next couple of days I would be in an amazing state of happiness
NUFC,3dv4us,Cheyroux31,5,Sun Jul 19 19:56:55 2015 UTC,you still gonna eat that snail if we get Mitrovic and Austin or did it have to be all 3 signings presented at once?
NUFC,3dv4us,thepresidentsturtle,3,Sun Jul 19 19:57:39 2015 UTC,Unfortunately for you I only said that I would if it was all signings at once. ;)

NUFC,3dv4us,Geoffbot,2,Sun Jul 19 20:17:04 2015 UTC,I like we've focused on leagues beyond the French (new money in there surely increases the prices of them). Hopefully we can see some dutch/Belgium signings hit the ground running.
NUFC,3dv4us,kulart,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:30:07 2015 UTC,"Baffles me how Belgium keeps on producing all these incredible talents. Being a norwegian it ticks me off quite a bit. Fair enough, we're roughly half the population of Belgium but we don't produce half the talent they do, and we're a country rich as fuck.   Think its incredibly smart of the club to focus on the Belgian league, if the last few years are anything to go by, we'll have a full team of internationals soon ;)"

NUFC,3dv4w3,Toast_of_Awesome,9,Sun Jul 19 19:47:20 2015 UTC,He's got great skills and has the potential to be another sterling...would def have him in the starting 11 next season.
NUFC,3dv4w3,M555G,2,Sun Jul 19 20:10:46 2015 UTC,Next Sterling? Hopefully we sell him for 20mil more than he's worth then
NUFC,3dv4w3,thetruth3402,5,Sun Jul 19 22:23:14 2015 UTC,"I think the sky's the limit for him. Unbelievable pace, and he seems to have great control and great decision making for such a young player.    The one thing I hope is that we bring in some quality depth so that he doesn't get burnt out so early in his career. But I could easily see him cracking the starting XI this year."
NUFC,3dv4w3,Deathbynote,4,Sun Jul 19 20:13:03 2015 UTC,I really hope so. I was lying in bed watching today's game on the tablet. When Aarons came on he had me sitting up. The key is whether he can perform on a consistent basis and stay injury free. Just as exciting a prospect as Wijnaldum and Mitrovic imo.
NUFC,3dv4w3,Obagoal9,2,Sun Jul 19 21:37:43 2015 UTC,"What site/app do you use to watch the games on your tablet, out of interest?"

NUFC,3dv4w3,Casual_Star,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:43 2015 UTC,As long as he looks good for the future I'm happy!
NUFC,3dv4w3,BrandonIPwN,3,Sun Jul 19 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"Raw talent - pacey, good dribbling and can beat players 1v1. Reminds me of Sterling which is a really good comparison. I wouldn't play him in the starting 11 but coming off the bench in the latter parts of games could be very beneficial."
NUFC,3dv4w3,gingerswiz,2,Sun Jul 19 20:14:18 2015 UTC,He was beating two players at a time against Sacramento last night.
NUFC,3dv4w3,Hollea,3,Sun Jul 19 23:19:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, but remember, this is Sacramento, which is like playing against a lower league 2 side (which is generous). Aarons would beat Sheffield United players 2 at a time as well I believe."
NUFC,3dv4w3,tjeckz,2,Mon Jul 20 02:19:01 2015 UTC,"Started off extremely well last season when the team didn't forget how to win. Picked up a couple of successive injuries, came back in our losing streak and was about par for the course.  Scored a (obviously intentional ;D) great goal against Schalke in a pre-season tournement last year.  He's had more of an impact than Adam Campbell had during his very brief appearances for the first team but then again he didn't get much of a chance.  Here's hoping."
NUFC,3dv4w3,bambler,2,Sun Jul 19 20:20:52 2015 UTC,"I saw the team in Milwaukee, and man, Aarons' play was like my biggest revelation from seeing them in person. He just makes things happen when he's in the game. I hope he can stay healthy."
NUFC,3dv4w3,TradedAJeepForAPecan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:31:19 2015 UTC,What is his contract situation? I seem to remember some discontent and rumours of spurs and city?
NUFC,3dv4w3,Chinese_Santa,2,Sun Jul 19 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure we offered him a new contract after he broke into the team last season, I think Aarons/his representatives didn't think our offer was high enough, which is unsurprising given Ashley's past record of saving every penny. After an apparent standoff and all the disaster/how hectic the last few months of last season were, I believe both parties agreed to postpone discussions until the end of the season.   He currently has one year left on his contract and maybe the links to people like City made him hesitate too, but I'm assuming he'll get more gametime this season and will likely sign a new contract within the next couple months.   Seems to like the club enough, but apparently when he first came through the first team he had a bit of an attitude/ego and John Carver had to send him back to the youth side for a week, then he came back a completely different person. His work rate and attitude seem really good, hopefully he at least signs again so we don't let him go for free, looks like a very bright prospect."
NUFC,3dv4w3,rooparoop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:51 2015 UTC,The kid has a rather good final product. Id love to see Mitrovic at the end of some of this dudes crosses next season.

NUFC,3dv4w3,TheBluntSharpie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:19:26 2015 UTC,"He looks like he could be excellent, two games stand out for me, when he came on for us against palace (scored  I believe) and honestly for the time he was on the pitch he was the best player on it especially for us. And then second game is city, absolutely tore them apparent and then under pressure delivered an excellent finish."
NUFC,3duh3m,cod1990,3,Sun Jul 19 16:24:52 2015 UTC,I'm fucking excited I think he's the box finisher we need. From what I noticed from our preseason games we are using the wings more and more which makes sense. He will be able to finish those quick hits to the box.

I remember when we pulled Milner back just before signing for them, that was a pretty embarrassing moment for NUFC.  Some Villa fans were scum that day, but I blame Damian Duff (not just for the goal) more than any Villa fan. He was a disgrace that season, along with that utter prick Michael Owen."
NUFC,3do5v5,LordCommanderKeef,3,Fri Jul 17 21:37:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say calling Benteke 'very average' is a bit harsh. The guy was immense before he broke his leg. And decent when he came back.  Either way, they lost 2 players for £40million. Pretty good business, and if they stay clear of Adebayor they could do quite well getting a few players in for that."
NUFC,3do5v5,kicka11,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:49:51 2015 UTC,"How else can you define average apart from his 'average' contribution? On form he is very good, unplayable. He plays like that rarely. Most of the time his touch is crap and he is off form or injured. Hence the regression to the mean, the average.   If we judge all players by their peak abilities then by all means he's class, and Mike Williamson is a professional footballer."
NUFC,3do5v5,Get_Piccolo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:03:19 2015 UTC,The reaction was really pathetic and smalltime from the Villa fans. I don't like to hold grudges but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy seeing these lot suffer.   Tactics Tim taking them down would be glorious.

NUFC,3doai1,thepresidentsturtle,6,Fri Jul 17 22:12:17 2015 UTC,"I would actually love that. We buy a defender, a good one, we get zouma on loan and then we get Matip on a free after another year of developing. Remember he's still early twenties which is young for a centre back. I want Nkoulou, don't know how good Mbemba is, but I feel like Nkoulou is too similar to Yanga but maybe McLaren will be able to use him well unlike Pardew (a fucking prime counter argument to the sudden outburst of Pardew sympathisers!!) but then I'll be pissed that we didn't keep Yanga, (arguably better than Nkoulou since he captained a Ligue 1 team to the title)  I don't see this happening though."

NUFC,3doai1,DarkStanley,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:14:59 2015 UTC,But surely 4 Cb is the amount you want two to play two for cover if they get a player sent off or injured they'd be down to 3. Look at the season we've just had starting out with 3 Cbs
NUFC,3doai1,JohnWasTaken,2,Sat Jul 18 08:23:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah but our history with injuries is just ridiculous. At this point it's hard to remember the last time Taylor made it through more than half a season. John Terry played every league game for them last year, so they are probably better placed than most to go with the three. Plus Ivanovic can play there and they have actual squad depth to deal with it, unlike us."

We're trying to keep it natural by not going on with lots of pre-prepared stats and sound bites (think match or the day commentary). Totally get your point and may look at changing it to accommodate your views.
NUFC,3djzi9,Obagoal9,4,Fri Jul 17 06:10:35 2015 UTC,"I see Obertan's name banded about a bit there. Does anyone else share my opinion that he might get come good...?  Fella on the right mentioned that 'purple patch' he had before pulling up and ruining his season, and he did look like our only threat in that abysmal start to last season.   He's just turned 26 this year, so he's a few years left in him yet. With a bit of confidence and, dare I say, a run in the team(?!), he might actually be an asset?   Remember how hard a time Gareth Bale had at the beginning...hah!   P.s. Nice work on the video podcast, gents."
NUFC,3djzi9,Lord_Flashheart_,4,Fri Jul 17 00:08:40 2015 UTC,It's not a case of his ability it's his mentality. He's shown once or twice that when he wants to run at people he can destroy them.  Problem is he never wants to. I'm not sure if it was Pardew scaring him into making sure he keeps possession so he never tried anything or if he's just shit scared of being tackled. Either way it just needs Shteve to point him in the right direction and tell him to go for it and he could easily be half decent for us (or not as shite as we all expect).
NUFC,3djzi9,Obagoal9,2,Fri Jul 17 10:31:22 2015 UTC,"Fair assessment. His first touch was usually fair and we saw that when he has a bit of fire in his belly, he's a handful when he knocks the ball past his man and runs.

NUFC,3djfwo,walvincraith,22,Thu Jul 16 19:36:09 2015 UTC,But Porto got to the quarter finals last year and beat Bayern Munich in one leg...
NUFC,3djfwo,walvincraith,2,Thu Jul 16 19:54:49 2015 UTC,"Eh, fair enough I honestly didn't know that. Still, I think he should be aiming for higher than the Portuguese league if he wants to improve and reach the potential that he seems to have. Either way, I'm just wanting this saga to be over already."
NUFC,3djfwo,King_Of_Geese,10,Thu Jul 16 20:07:58 2015 UTC,"Well it is consistent CL football in a team always challenging for their league title. Plus Porto famously sell on their best players for buck loads to even bigger clubs, I'm sure he'll have that in mind too."

You're lucky you didn't come here towards the end of last season, it was a painful, painful few months enduring needing to win just one game to ensure safety.

It’s not the television contracts, get-out clauses, marketing departments or executive boxes. It’s the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city.  It’s a small boy clambering up stadium steps for the very first time, gripping his father’s hand, gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him and, without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love.""  Sir Bobby Robson   That's how a lot of us feel. We're not the most successful club, or the most glamorous, but there's a reason we consistently pull in a packed stadium of 52k, and it ain't the pies. This club oozes passion, which is why our recent state of affairs hurts to much: no ambition, no balls.  We hope that's changing though. Our new manager is raising heads little by little, and for that alone I think we're thankful. We've been promised investment which, whilst slow in coming, has manifested in the largest transfer fee paid in the Mike Ashley era - with promises of more to come.

NUFC,3dhvu4,xaviniesta,6,Thu Jul 16 14:24:34 2015 UTC,"We have been around since 1892 when Newcastle East End and Newcastle West End merged. We have won a fair amount of cups, trophies and titles, although the last major win was in 1955. That doesn't stop close about 50,000 fans turning up to watch the players and cheer them on.  We have had a number of managers throughout the years, 14 in the last 10 years or so, only some were better than others. Notably Kevin Keegan, whose side were dubbed the entertainers due their attacking flair. Keegans philosophy boiled down to scoring more goals than the opposition, which nearly won us the Premier League title in the 1995/96 season. After that there were a couple of manager missteps, including Ruud Gullit who famously dropped our top strikers against our arch rivals Sunderland, a match we lost 2-1. Ignoring the caretaker manager, we then got Sir Bobby Robson, the manager who got us to the semi finals of the UEFA cup, where we lost against Marseille with Drogba scoring twice over 2 legs to send us out. Sir Bobby sadly died in 2009 after battling cancer 5 times. A Memorial service was held for him at Durham Cathedral with over 1,000 invited guests and was broadcast live on national television and at the 3 stadiums he managed at in England.  Regardless of what the media and fans of other teams will have you believe, we really do not expect us to win anything every year. All we want to be is entertained, think of the Russell Crowe movie Gladiator from 2000, as long as the players give it their all we will be happy. Happier if we win of course.  Newcastle fans are a passionate lot as was noticed last season with the protests at how the club was managed and run. But we have a new manager, one whom some fans think shouldn't have the job, but the rest of us are willing to give him a chance, despite his numerous sackings in the past.  If you ever get the chance to visit England, take a trip to Newcastle and get a ticket for a match, tell the locals you want to cheer the team on and they will welcome you with open arms, if you can understand them of course."

They may be able to play together but I would suspect Perez playing of one would be ideal. Mitrovic seems to have more skill and flicks/hold up play but I'm not certain. Sell on value would only be Mitrovic as I don't see Austin going for more than $15 million and is only getting older.  Mitrovic is my choice.

Call me irresponsible, but I feel that as a team in the PL that isn't one of the big boys, the only way you're ever going to have a real shot at breaking into the top 4, if you're not spending over 50 million every summer, is by taking bets on younger players with big potential. Austin will help, sure, but are we going to ever break into the top 5 with Austin as our main striker? Almost certainly not. With Mitrovic? Probably not - but it's much easier to imagine."
NUFC,3dikuk,your_pet_is_average,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:17:10 2015 UTC,"It's a moot point because we won't break top 5 either way, but I think you're underrating Austin.

Wijnaldum and Mitrovic for us could be considered big name signings in terms of talent, but Wijnaldum's attitude and professional seems to add so much more than just footballing ability.   While Mitrovic would be great, I could only see him using us a shop-window for a future club, which is fine if we get a lot of money for him, could cause some issues and problems down the line so losing out on him won't be a big of an issue for me (unless of course we don't sign Austin or any other striker)."

As it stands, it looks like McClaren is going to use a 4-2-3-1 and De Jong looks to be in the 10 position with Wijnaldum is going to be in used in the centre of midfield as a box to box player so the team is going to have room for all three.  The real question when it comes to the midfield is whether or not Sissoko has a place in the starting 11 out wide with those three players or if he is going to be used as a sub who can cover multiple roles in midfield."

Then the Left winger like Perez or Cabella would also have a dual role as striker and winger.  Perez-------------Mitrovic  -----------------De JOng  ----------Gini--------------sissoko ^  -----------------tiote  Gini combines with Perez and Janmaat has all the space he needs to run forward.

A fit Cabella could be first choice on the left side - I think a solid run of starts could be the best thing for him.  We've then got slightly less creative/more industrious wingers like Obertan and Gouffran on the bench plus Anita, Tiote and Abeid to cover the middle."

What's really curious for me, is fitting in Gini. Anita and Colback were both very deep to receive the ball to play out from the back, with our CBs pushed way out wide and our fullbacks very aggressive. I like the system, I dunno if we really want Gini that deep. Also Colback and Anita are players who are much better when the team is in possession, especially Colback. Gini is even less defensively minded, could make for a very frail defensive midfield, especially given how much our back line has needed protection in the past."

Our attacking shape was something like this. Fullbacks very aggressive providing width, CBs splitting wide, one of Anita or Colback would always come in between to receive the ball, Gouff and Sissoko as inside forwards, which is where I reckon Cabella is best. They kept making decent runs behind the line, Sissoko especially linked up well, greated a good opportunity for Cisse.  Haidara could've had two assists."
NUFC,3dhr3f,blackandwhitearmy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:32:37 2015 UTC,"That link isn't working for me. Remy would work well as part of the three behind the striker, but in my view I would prefer De Jong in the middle with Wijnaldum and Sissoko either side. Or even drop Sissoko just behind De Jong (so he can get further up) and have Perez on one side, Colback/Tiote/Anita behind Sissoko.   Almost 4-1-3-2 with the ball, 4-2-3-1 when we lose it, Sissoko and De Jong both drop. I get the feeling with the rumours Cabella might have to win over Steve for starting role."
NUFC,3dhr3f,blackandwhitearmy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"Link works for some reason now. I like Haidara and I hope he is learning from what Janmaat does, as that could be very effective."
NUFC,3dhfzb,WigglyParrot,6,Thu Jul 16 08:26:32 2015 UTC,"Despite the cliche, he pretty much is a new signing.   My only concern is how Steve fits our attacking players into a system that works. With every post on here discussing formations and systems, everybody has a different idea. It's great to have options, but I worry Steve isn't the kind of manager to bench one of our bigger names and perhaps wasting players like Sissoko out wide or player like Aarons and some extent Perez not getting any chances.   SDJ, Wijnaldum, Cabella, Perez, Cisse, Sissoko and then the possibility of Mitrovic/Austin are all potential starters.   I expect a pretty narrow set up with Janmaat and Haidara providing the width. Colback, Tiote and Anita for that holding role.   And come Steve, sign some defenders."
NUFC,3dhfzb,Frank1892,3,Thu Jul 16 10:53:12 2015 UTC,Young guys like Perez and Aarons should be playing in the cup ties or getting the odd game here or there. It's good to have competition and if we have a staff who understands the importance of the domestic cups the young players will get plenty of burn.
NUFC,3dhfzb,jwuer,2,Thu Jul 16 12:48:35 2015 UTC,"I expect a pretty narrow set up with Janmaat and Haidara providing the width. Colback, Tiote and Anita for that holding role.   I'd be all over this. It means our 'wide' players would function more as AMs so Sissoko isn't as wasted there, but can still help overload flanks if needed, and we can even play a fluid front 3. Our thin fullback depth is a bit of a concern though, especially given Haidara's injury record."
NUFC,3dhfzb,chuddys_revenge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:19:23 2015 UTC,"Plus, we've not been able to sort out who's supposed to be covering who when a fullback bombs on since Houghton was in charge."
NUFC,3dhfzb,Lord_Flashheart_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"Assuming only one bombs forward at once, teams aren't going to be leaving three strikers up there so we should have the spare man anyway. It'll be vulnerable to a high press and counter attacking football, but that's the limitations you accept when you choose to run with a possession based 4-2-3-1. Every system has it's weaknesses, but given how critical everyone's been over Pardew's counter attacking methods, I think this is something we should be embracing.  Our current fullbacks can't play an entire season though, and I'm not sure how easily Anita/Colback/Ferguson/Dummett can adopt an attacking fullback role."
NUFC,3dhfzb,chuddys_revenge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"Both Willo and Lascelles were playing really wide against Atlas, and Anita or Colback would slot even deeper to help fill the void. I think it could work well with some competent CBs."
NUFC,3dhfzb,rewindthegamer,2,Sat Jul 18 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"I watched quite a bit of him a few years ago as I used to have the Ajax supporters club in my bar (it was when he mostly played up front due to Kolbein Sigporsson being even more injury prone than SDJ) and he was bloody fantastic. Cant wait to see him playing just off the strikers, he will be class and is such an intelligent footballer"
NUFC,3dhfzb,HannibalDolomite,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:03:57 2015 UTC,"This is it, it's the intelligence I'm looking forward to.  If we can manage to get in Mitrovic / another striker, and have SDJ playing the intelligent through balls into the strikers with Gigi doing the same, it's a pretty exciting thought !"
NUFC,3dhfzb,HannibalDolomite,4,Thu Jul 16 09:11:56 2015 UTC,"Austin Mitrovic -----SDJ------ Sissoko Winegum ----Tiote  Get the width from the full backs, Tiote never crosses the half way line. I would love to see that line up haha"
NUFC,3dhfzb,HannibalDolomite,5,Thu Jul 16 09:16:41 2015 UTC,"Winegum haha !   We would need a more attacking minded LB in that case - unless we think Haidara is good enough for a long season? I know when he has played he does make runs and attacks, but nothing like Janmaat."
NUFC,3dhfzb,your_pet_is_average,2,Thu Jul 16 09:24:07 2015 UTC,"Winegum and CelineDion tearing shit up :D  I think Haidara is better going forward than defensively, but he is so injury prone its ridiculous. If we then put Dummett there, we would have no width on the left at all. Maybe there is hope for Shane Ferguson after all, or teach Aarons how to tackle...  But a left back would be nice"
NUFC,3dhfzb,daveofreckoning,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:37:19 2015 UTC,"He looks really classy, imo. This is basing off one game, but against Atlas he made a few really great touches to retain possession out of the air and move into space, including a meg or two, and he made some really intelligent passes. I think he's a player that can stop passing sideways and backwards and make incisive moves."
NUFC,3divum,cod1990,3,Thu Jul 16 17:06:28 2015 UTC,"Looks like his actual agent is someone called David Threlfall. Muzzi doesn't actually claim to be his agent, just wishing him good luck at a new club, so he might know something or he might just have got the wrong end of the stick."

NUFC,3dcqhx,kicka11,3,Wed Jul 15 14:00:07 2015 UTC,I'm sure they do (Perez and Lascelles at least have been posting about their off season workouts) but light cardio is a far cry from the day to day training they do during the season.

The first half they squeezed us and we give the ball away far to much it was shocking to watch. We had a few good bits of one twos down the right wing but apart from that it could of been 3-0. Second half was much better we controlled the game but just didn't have that killer instinct. We need another winger, 2 CB's and Two strikers."
NUFC,3dcqhx,Frank1892,2,Wed Jul 15 11:10:05 2015 UTC,I'd argue that he shouldn't even have the ball at his feet as much as he did.  Possession in our defensive third doesn't do much of anything...it isn't dangerous at all.  Maybe if we're milking a lead...
NUFC,3dcqhx,kicka11,2,Wed Jul 15 12:52:33 2015 UTC,"I think Mclearen is trying to get us to control games and you do that normally by having the most possession.

There's no better weekend than an early face off with the Pens I can watch and a Newcastle win."
NUFC,3dcqhx,r0cafella,3,Thu Jul 16 08:39:27 2015 UTC,I was at this game and it was a great time! Atlas' volley goal was nuts to see live!!!!! If anyone has footage I would be forever in your debt.  NUFC looked off. there were a few runs by players off the ball that were just totally missed or if they were seen the ball played in was poor. But that is exactly what preseason is for.  Good luck to you guys this season. Swansea came last summer and they had a fantastic PL season. I think it's our milwaukee water!  Will look forward to the game at Old Trafford this season :)  Found it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV9L29NlaGE&t=78m48s

Our attack looks halfway decent, De Jong looks really sharp, has made some good dribbles and passes. Sissoko not so much but still showing class, and of course, scored. Now that I'm seeing our team play I think we need real wing options, mainly so Sissoko can sit in center mid and get either of our current CMs off the pitch, preferably Anita. Then Sissoko can play next to the CDM of Tiote or Colback with some more forward momentum. So dream world shopping list: Striker, winger, additional class CM, 1-2 quality CBs and, while we are dreaming, an LB better than Haidara. He's ok but still too raw.   Edit: Completely forgot Gini, so there's the CM issue sorted."

NUFC,3d8eef,Cheyroux31,11,Tue Jul 14 09:21:50 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. If he's literally waiting until there are no other options I'd rather we pushed through for another striker, whether that's Austin or whoever else."
NUFC,3d8eef,ButtGardener,8,Tue Jul 14 09:28:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest with you if he doesn't respect us and want to come then I'm over him.  We have obviously shown we want him more than anybody else but he's still stalling for other clubs.    Edit: I just read a report that supposedly,  he is stalling not because of other clubs but because there's visa issues for his family and there's a possibility they may not be able to live in the UK.  If this is true I don't blame the fella for waiting for this to be resolved."
NUFC,3d8eef,Cheyroux31,5,Tue Jul 14 13:24:19 2015 UTC,I agree we want players who want to play for us but at the same time would love to have him.  Would prefer Austin though
NUFC,3d8eef,mikeyyyy_,3,Tue Jul 14 13:42:51 2015 UTC,"Good. If he is waiting to try and get a better offer, that's on him. He's definitely not Atletico quality yet, especially as they've just signed Vietto."
NUFC,3d8eef,ButtGardener,2,Tue Jul 14 09:31:15 2015 UTC,Reports are saying he is stalling not for a better offer but because of visa issues with his family.  Newcastle promising to resolve the visa issues.

NUFC,3d8eef,chuddys_revenge,3,Tue Jul 14 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"Whilst for Newcastle, Mitrovic certainly appears to be the striker who has become Plan A and with now less than four weeks until United kick off their season, the idea of not having a striker signed up in time to be involved against Southampton isn’t something that I want to think about.   I've yet to hear us linked to a superior striking option to Cisse. I'd love it if we got Mitrovic, but he'd have to work his way into the team, not just automatically end up in the first XI."
NUFC,3d8eef,thetruth3402,4,Tue Jul 14 10:42:11 2015 UTC,Seriously? Mitrovic and Austin are both much better than Cisse.
NUFC,3d8eef,Frank1892,16,Tue Jul 14 11:00:38 2015 UTC,"Cisse is one of most important players in our team right now. Not sure why the majority on this sub don't rate him. He's a goalscorer.   He was our top scorer, managed a pretty good number despite being injured and suspended most of the time, not to mention our shit football and his many sub appearances.   We would of been safe from relegation very early on if he hadn't of got suspended.   Mitrovic, will be a fantastic signing, much to prove though. Austin I think will be a fantastic signing, but I understand why people are torn on him. I think it's unfair to say Austin is a huge improvement on Cisse."
NUFC,3d8eef,blackandwhitearmy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:14:40 2015 UTC,"Then again, he did get himself suspended. Let's not act like that's a positive. Also, what does playing so few full matches indicate (Did not start 12 of 23 matches for which he was available)? A lack of fitness? A lack of effort in training sessions?  His goals were crucial, but he definitely should have given us more than 11."
NUFC,3d8eef,Positive_Rage,6,Tue Jul 14 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"Remind me who had the better strike rate last season, Austin or Cisse?   Remind me how many goals in a top European division Austin has...   And now what about Cisse?   Mitrovic might end up a better player than Cisse, but at the minute Papiss is better than both of them."
NUFC,3d8eef,chuddys_revenge,3,Tue Jul 14 11:58:03 2015 UTC,"Mitrovic could be better than Cisse given time, but that signing is more about potential rather than current ability. If you put Cisse on the best team in the Belgian league he'd look incredible too.  Austin is definitely worse, and on a team like us that places very little emphasis on set pieces, he'll struggle."
NUFC,3d8eef,GaiusNorthernAccent,2,Tue Jul 14 14:11:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're being downvoted, Cisse is a donkey. Offers nothing outside of goals and they dry up for long spells/sitters get missed far too often. I hope we sack him off and play whoever the new guy is and Perez more."
NUFC,3d8eef,HannibalDolomite,2,Tue Jul 14 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"If he wants to wait for Porto, fair play - champions league football but on less money. We will just go back in for Bas Dost I imagine."
NUFC,3d8eef,JG_92,2,Tue Jul 14 09:41:03 2015 UTC,The odds of us signing Austin have gone from 7/2 to 7/4!  Does someone know something we don't? Is Mitrovic Plan A and Austin Plan B?  Source

NUFC,3d8eef,HannibalDolomite,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:49:03 2015 UTC,"I think Austin is plan A (keeping Cisse being the fallback in case we are unsuccesful) and Mitrovic is also plan A for the second striker role (with Dost being plan B)  Everywhere is reporting we want 2 strikers, we just dont want to pay £15m for Austin so are playing the long game with him"

It's nice to know that Shteve actually acknowledges Mitrovic's arrogance. He's spoken a lot about having players with class, it always kind of worried me that he's been going after Mitrovic harder than Austin, but at least if he knows..."
NUFC,3d7lwn,spongish,5,Tue Jul 14 04:54:03 2015 UTC,"I think he's still going after Austin, just that Austin is himself taking time to decide what he does next. There's been no real news about him so he's probably weighing up a few offers and waiting to see what other offers come in for him as well, but I think it's reached the stage where clubs are waiting to hear back from him."
NUFC,3d7lwn,moneyball32,4,Tue Jul 14 04:57:26 2015 UTC,"Aye, Austin is definitely on the radar, but it seems we've been pushing harder for Mitrovic. I know Shteve has said he wants two big striker signings, but how I see it, it's either Mitrovic OR Austin. If we get both, that would be about 45 Mil of Ashley's promised 50-60 Mil, without any defensive signings, which is what we need above all else.  Personally, I'd be fine signing either, as long as they score goals and stay more than 1 year!"
NUFC,3d7lwn,spongish,3,Tue Jul 14 05:01:49 2015 UTC,"There's definitely interest there. I've heard we're going after both, but because no one really knows what's going on with either, it's hard to say. I'd be happy to get just one in (likely Mitrovic at this point), plus a defender, then see if we can pick up the other (likely Austin) and any other 1st team/youth players that would benefit the squad as a whole."

NUFC,3d8xcj,chuddys_revenge,3,Tue Jul 14 16:50:51 2015 UTC,We need to focus on Defence and a decent Striker.   It's no good having too many decent midfielders if we can't put the ball in one net or keep it out of the other.
NUFC,3d8xcj,KipTheFury,4,Tue Jul 14 12:53:51 2015 UTC,We are incredibly weak on the wings though. Who on this team really should be starting out wide?
NUFC,3d8xcj,FlapjackJackson,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"Fair point, we have Cabella and Aarons, Gouffran and Obertan aren't really up to scratch but could do a job and Shane Ferguson might get another chance.  I still think the priorities should be on a striker and shoring up the defense, and we could get someone better than Townsend without the young English player tax."
NUFC,3d8xcj,KipTheFury,3,Tue Jul 14 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"Aarons only made 4 appearances last year. That really only leaves us with Cabella as a legitimate option. We probably could find a better player than Townsend, but winger certainly is a big need right now."
NUFC,3d8xcj,FlapjackJackson,2,Tue Jul 14 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"We don't use wingers, haven't for years. We prefer playing with inside forwards because we run with a lone striker and have extremely attacking fullbacks that provide our width.  Aarons and Obertan are the only traditional wingers in the squad, but Cabella, Sissoko, Ayoze, Gouffran, Marveaux and even Wijnaldum can serve as inside forwards."
NUFC,3d8xcj,chuddys_revenge,3,Tue Jul 14 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"Bloody hell, would be up there with such a shit deal as buying Obertan."
NUFC,3d8xcj,JonnyArtois,5,Tue Jul 14 14:14:17 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I actually like Townsend and I would love it if we got him. Seems I'm on my own though."
NUFC,3d8xcj,Frank1892,2,Tue Jul 14 16:06:08 2015 UTC,he got into a tottenham squad much better than ours. our only natural wide players are obertan and aarons.

NUFC,3d8xcj,Dasperuvian,2,Wed Jul 15 10:56:21 2015 UTC,Young and English probably explains the price. Would rather other players over him though
NUFC,3d8xcj,cprx,2,Tue Jul 14 12:50:12 2015 UTC,Why are we bidding on so many wingers and not any CB's? It doesn't make any sense.
NUFC,3d8xcj,AlphaPot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:52:07 2015 UTC,"We do need a CB, but who do we really have out wide? Someone will need to provide service to Mitrovic."
NUFC,3d8xcj,FlapjackJackson,2,Tue Jul 14 14:55:26 2015 UTC,Good player but not really what we need at the moment. Wouldn't mind going after him if we had already got a striker and a couple of defenders.
NUFC,3d8xcj,magpie_army,2,Tue Jul 14 14:24:45 2015 UTC,"Decent enough in fits and starts, but not worth £10million"

NUFC,3d8xcj,duncahimovic,2,Tue Jul 14 12:57:09 2015 UTC,"The article is claiming that Levy has set an asking price of £15 million though, I definitely wouldn't want him for that price."
NUFC,3d8xcj,GoalaAmeobi,3,Tue Jul 14 13:04:28 2015 UTC,"Nah, £15m is far too much. Personally I'd have valued him around £7m. Levy is well known for his hard negotiation tactics too, so I can't see him going for much lower than their valuation."
NUFC,3d8xcj,duncahimovic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:25:52 2015 UTC,Yeah we'd manage to get the price down to £13m if we're lucky which is far too much. Wingers should be low on our list of priorities anyways.
NUFC,3d8xcj,GoalaAmeobi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:55:37 2015 UTC,Can't hurt that he fits the English quota too.  We're 2 down on last season already with Raylor and Sammy away and 2 up with Darlow and Lascelles in.  We need one or two more in if we're to have any chance of getting rid of Willo too.
NUFC,3d8xcj,Lord_Flashheart_,0,Tue Jul 14 15:27:59 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as an English quota!  It's one of the big misconceptions, there's only a cap on how many foreigners you can have (no more than 17). We're on 16 at the moment? We got rid of Santon, MYM, Ferrerya and Jonas, but Marveaux is back, Perez now counts as a senior and we signed Wijnaldum. Last year we only had 15. Mitrovic doesn't count as foreign this year because he's too young.  Adding English players does nothing to help our homegrown status. Only selling foreign talent helps."
NUFC,3d8xcj,chuddys_revenge,2,Tue Jul 14 16:45:53 2015 UTC,"You've just turned the equation around though. If it's a ""Limit on foreign players"" then surely the rest has to be made up of Home Growns or U21s? Unless we're registering dogs or something."
NUFC,3d8xcj,Lord_Flashheart_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"Well you don't have to register u21s at all, so yeah if you want a full 25 player senior squad, you need to stack it with homegrowns. Thing is you don't really, a squad with 25 senior players is bloated and leaves no room for youngsters to break in.  For example Chelsea only had 3 homegrown players in last year's squad, with 15 foreigners. The rest they filled up with youngsters, who they don't even have to register.  Look at City, they've just got rid of 5/6 homegrown players despite having the full limit of 17 internationals last season. Granted they just bought Sterling but he doesn't even count. They're fine as long as they don't buy another foreigner without selling/loaning.  We have 16 foreigners, and over 9 home grown players available to be registered. So some HG players are already going to have to miss out, most likely Vuckic/Ferguson. If we add Townsend, we're in the same position, but now we can register one fewer HG player, but there's no change in where we can sign from."

NUFC,3d8ht8,Doktor_Avinlunch,3,Tue Jul 14 16:27:59 2015 UTC,"Good call in my eyes. Changing the captaincy can be disruptive and if you believe the rumours, he has a very strong influence in the dressing room.  Depending on if we sign any center backs good enough to go straight in and force him to the bench, I'm sure it will be either Colback, Sissoko, De Jong or Janmaat to take the captaincy on the pitch. Nothing wrong with that."

NUFC,3d4iop,KebabMaster,8,Mon Jul 13 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"Well he's Serbian and they're not in the EU (yet), so he'd need a work permit.  His family are also concerned that they'll have to apply for a tourist visa to come and watch him play, and considering those are a) expensive, b) limited in terms of the time you can have, and further considering that his dad and brother work as his agents, it's becoming a stumbling block."
NUFC,3d4iop,Duckstiff,5,Mon Jul 13 13:58:39 2015 UTC,A tourist visa is like £90-100 which will be chicken shit to a footballer.

They are very realistic with their career goals and know a move abroad is a necessary move for financial reasons. Although, maybe this wouldn't be the case if Serbian league was as popular as the Premier league of course. For example, you would never see a club publish a video where the players discuss when they plan on leaving (or when was the last time you got drunk), but it's much more honest which is refreshing."

That's the day he became Captain for me
NUFC,3d4e7q,SheSaid09,5,Mon Jul 13 14:05:50 2015 UTC,. . . . not just the younger ones. IIRC there were a few who've been here for quite some time too had to be told.
NUFC,3d4e7q,Phoenix9999,11,Mon Jul 13 17:19:00 2015 UTC,Janmaat. One of the few who actually seemed to give a fuck
NUFC,3d4e7q,Enacca,23,Mon Jul 13 13:06:58 2015 UTC,"Janmaat - Only one with enough quality and passion that has played for more than 10mins total. Guaranteed a start so he's always on the pitch.   Colback isn't right. Far too much talent in his position to give him the armband and basically tell him he's playing every game. Aye, he's from round here and all that but that's not what makes a good captain. Does it look like he commands enough respect to be ordering the likes of Sissoko, Tiote, Colo, ect around?  SDJ has the pedigree but not enough time in the shirt yet. Again, they're not going to listen to someone who's effectively contributed nothing yet."
NUFC,3d4e7q,Lord_Flashheart_,4,Mon Jul 13 13:10:38 2015 UTC,"Colback I deifnitely think is one for the future, but Janmaat for me he has definitely earned it."
NUFC,3d4e7q,Ionicfold,9,Mon Jul 13 20:53:57 2015 UTC,Janmaat seems like the only option.
NUFC,3d4e7q,Murraykins,7,Mon Jul 13 13:16:54 2015 UTC,Janmaat for me.
NUFC,3d4e7q,R1kman,4,Mon Jul 13 13:46:28 2015 UTC,"Janmatt is the most appropriate choice imo.   He is one of the few players to be pretty much guaranteed a start whenever he is fit. Other positions such as midfield and centre back (assuming we get 1 or 2 in) may change over the season depending on form, who works best together etc so Colo, Colback, SDJ etc might not necessarily play every game.   I also think he lead by example throughout last season in terms of consistent performance level and always showing passion and commitment."
NUFC,3d4e7q,BBKSam,5,Mon Jul 13 19:01:29 2015 UTC,De Jong if he stays fit.
NUFC,3d4e7q,AlphaPot,5,Mon Jul 13 12:59:37 2015 UTC,"I'd like De Jong, with Janmaat as Vice.   Colo disappeared at important times last season, and if the rumours of him wanting out are true then it's probably easier for him to make the move at some point if he's not captain. His performances last season were disappointing too, so I'd hope it'll change hands."

NUFC,3d4e7q,xMythicKillax,2,Mon Jul 13 14:48:21 2015 UTC,"Does anyone in this sub blame Colo for what happened last year? Whilst Blatter has obvious reasons to be removed, Colo doesn't really. If we'd made Janmaat captain in January you think we'd have played better? Before Pardew left we were all just praying he'd avoid injury for the rest of the season.  Colo does more organisationally for our defence than any other player easily. He tells everyone in our back line exactly what to do, where to stand, when to press. This is why his absense is notable, nobody else can run the back line like him, he's legitimately a leader on the field, and will continue to be so no matter what happens to his captaincy. If you think Janmaat, Sissoko or especially Colback doing this you're kidding yourself. He gives away less fouls and cards and makes less errors than just about everyone else. Physically he's not what he used to be and in 1v1 duels it sometimes shows, but mentally he's head and shoulders above our back line.  It's a lot fucking easier to get fullback caps for The Netherlands than CB for Argentina. Janmaat being younger shouldn't be considered a positive. The lad gives 100% every game, and tackles hard, but what makes you think he can lead? Good soldiers aren't always great generals. That's a shit analogy but whatever."
NUFC,3d4e7q,chuddys_revenge,-2,Mon Jul 13 20:42:06 2015 UTC,"So it makes him one of our most important players Aside from a brief spell as his marriage fell apart, there's not actually any evidence that he wants to leave And maybe Janmaat will make a good captain once he's got a bit more experience, but there's nothing to suggest that he'd be better than Coloccini right now Sissoko captained the team while Colo was injured this year and was terrible, he's also made noises about leaving far more regularly and consistently than Colo has. Colback probably won't even be starting, so why would he be captain?"
NUFC,3d4e7q,Positive_Rage,-2,Mon Jul 13 14:54:51 2015 UTC,You not been around for the last 5 years? The guy is a club legend
NUFC,3d4e7q,letsgohome45,9,Mon Jul 13 14:50:48 2015 UTC,Club legend is a bit far to be honest.
NUFC,3d4e7q,letsgohome45,-1,Mon Jul 13 15:19:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, he helped us get promoted and could have pushed a transfer through to a bigger club but he didn't."
NUFC,3d4e7q,xMythicKillax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"All i'm saying is I just don't see him being the one to motivate the players and push them to be the best they can be because he's completely failed to do this the last 3 years, my pick would be Janmaat who is younger, more talented and already a big personality in the dressing room"

NUFC,3d3hi0,rooparoop,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:19:44 2015 UTC,They're on it now. Wijanaldum is our most expensive midfielder. Plus it costs more to have De Jong over Sissoko.

NUFC,3d3sd5,T786,2,Mon Jul 13 08:14:24 2015 UTC,Pretty abysmal scoring record. Have to feel that this one is a no-goer.

NUFC,3d3sd5,Positive_Rage,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:29:49 2015 UTC,Terrible player. Wouldn't even be a good scorer in the Championship.  Had huge hype as a youngster though. Was a legend on 07.

NUFC,3d467g,RocknRollRobot9,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:22:45 2015 UTC,getting less confidence with the deal as time goes on also would yous want him if he only comes to us because his favoured choices didnt?
NUFC,3d467g,DelBod95,10,Mon Jul 13 11:37:28 2015 UTC,"You mean like how Demba Ba desperately wanted to join us? Or Remy? Or Debuchy? There aren't going to be many players come to Newcastle that see themselves staying for the long haul, and if we can have Mitrovic for a couple years until a bigger team comes in for him then why not? He's a good striker and would benefit the team, I'd definitely have him. Loyalty in football is not a real thing anymore."
NUFC,3d467g,Novocastrian4,2,Mon Jul 13 12:08:04 2015 UTC,i hope my comment isnt coming off as not wanting him him because i agree completely just seeing some people over facebook saying they dont want him if we werent his first pick doesnt want to wear the shirt etc.
NUFC,3d467g,DelBod95,3,Mon Jul 13 12:15:07 2015 UTC,"You don't always get rational discussion on Facebook, a lot of people still believe in the idea of Shearers who'll pick us over the Man Utds of the world and even though I want that too it's just not feasible.

NUFC,3d467g,DelBod95,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:18:13 2015 UTC,There's probably been nothing going on because no club is willing to pay the £15 million asking price for a 26 year-old with a history of injuries and one good season poaching goals in the Premier League.
NUFC,3d467g,Wugazi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:52:33 2015 UTC,its not a great comparison due to age but i remember ricky lambert scoring 15-16 goals in his first season in the prem aswell
NUFC,3d467g,DelBod95,2,Mon Jul 13 18:25:35 2015 UTC,He could at least pretend we're a good option instead of making it seem like a chore he'll be coming here and earning a lot more than he does currently.
NUFC,3d467g,hideyourarms,3,Mon Jul 13 12:31:18 2015 UTC,Yes.
NUFC,3d467g,Wugazi,2,Mon Jul 13 11:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yep. The amount of people we have missed out on in this department; Bony, Gomes etc have been getting a bit annoying so to outbid a team and get him in to me is a good start even if he'd had preferred Roma."

NUFC,3d098v,lgf92,2,Sun Jul 12 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"Latest I'd heard was a player swap, but they almost never go through. Plus our willingness to pay more upfront probably means a lot."
NUFC,3d098v,spongish,2,Sun Jul 12 13:05:25 2015 UTC,The fact we only deal in up front cash only deals is a definitely a big factor. Allows the team receiving the cash to then use that to buy a player with full cash giving them better bargaining power too.
NUFC,3d098v,WigglyParrot,2,Sun Jul 12 13:08:13 2015 UTC,Aha I see ! We can hope.
NUFC,3d098v,WigglyParrot,2,Sun Jul 12 13:59:58 2015 UTC,"Don't think the issue is anything to do with Anderlecht though, they seem to prefer to do business with us. Mitrovic is the one that needs convincing now. I can understand he might be a bit wary after being so close to Roma and Champions League football and now Porto trying to get him for a swap. Hopefully Porto and Roma aren't willing to meet the same price we are and we can persuade him to join!"
NUFC,3d098v,WigglyParrot,2,Sun Jul 12 14:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally, can't blame him though really, can you?  Surely Benfica and Porto are better options than us at the moment?"
NUFC,3d098v,rooparoop,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely. They can offer more than us in terms of competing for titles and European football, however we may be able to offer more in wages and a stronger league. I'm hoping we're turning over a new leaf as a club and we have a good project to convince players to sign and I think that's what we have done with Wijnaldum, sold him to the vision and convinced him we are heading places and spending money to improve."
NUFC,3d098v,AlphaPot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I just still struggle to think we're actually wanting and willing to spend a lot of money on players to really improve us.  Realistically what can we offer? Exposure? Something which Porto players are getting a lot of and always seem to move onto greater things.  I hope he does come here and plays well for 2-3 seasons and if he moves on, great. But I just.. have trouble having faith :p"
NUFC,3d098v,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm still sceptical about him coming. We're definitely second or third choice if he had the option to choose himself.   If he does come however we all know it's a stepping stone onto a bigger move which is win-win for all parties if it happens. He plays amazing and gets us results and we'll eventually get a massive transfer fee to be able to replace him.  Obviously this is all if he comes and if he plays well. I guess we'll see!"

NUFC,3d0a5a,hoo_doo_voodo_people,11,Sun Jul 12 12:11:39 2015 UTC,I still can't believe we signed him. Fuck me this kid is gonna be a star for us.
NUFC,3d0a5a,Dasperuvian,4,Sun Jul 12 12:48:08 2015 UTC,"The position played by Wijnaldum in this game is most likely the position he will play for us. It's known as the ""double six"" in Holland/Germany and is essentially a 4-2-3-1 but with the two holding midfielders as ""box-to-box"" players, or two number 6's."
NUFC,3d0a5a,johndrama,2,Sun Jul 12 12:16:57 2015 UTC,I hope he doesn't play there. He's played much further forward for PSV and scored 18 goals from midfield last season. We need that in the team.
NUFC,3d0a5a,guggabump,10,Sun Jul 12 12:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yes we do, but if we look back at the zonal marking article reflecting on Mclaren's tactics in the title winning year at Twente combined with Mclarens comments regarding Wijnaldum as a ""box-to-box"" player, it is feasible to imagine next season we will be playing with a rotating midfield three, probably Colback-Wijnaldum-De Jong, with Sissoko on either the left or right wing.   I suspect that the possibility of playing regularly in the number 6 position is an attraction for Wijnaldum as it will benefit him staking a claim for this position for the national team ahead of the 2016 Euros."

NUFC,3d03rw,TheNecromancer,7,Sun Jul 12 10:44:52 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer we kept Colo, got rid of Williamson, brought in a new CB replacement. Colo could play out the last year of his contract alongside the new CB, as well as Lascelles, and help steady the ship for the upcoming season. Certainly getting rid of Colo before Williamson doesn't make any sense.   I think McClaren will bring about a lot of positivity and solid coaching to the team, which should help a more settled team and defence."
NUFC,3d03rw,spongish,9,Sun Jul 12 13:30:00 2015 UTC,I don't like how people treat Colo considering how long he's been with us
NUFC,3d03rw,KebabMaster,9,Sun Jul 12 11:46:09 2015 UTC,I'll let up when he starts reliably standing goalside of his man.
NUFC,3d03rw,TheNecromancer,22,Sun Jul 12 14:48:44 2015 UTC,"He's been shit for us more often than he's been good. He's pissed off to Argentina a lot of times and wanted away for awhile now, he's been a useless captain as well.  More to dislike than like imo."
NUFC,3d03rw,JonnyArtois,-3,Sun Jul 12 11:53:53 2015 UTC,"He has not been shit more than good that's fucking delusional. He has been our best defender for years and helped us get promoted and finish top 5. He clearly wants to go home and that's fine his family lives there, not his fault we refused to let him go. Without him we would have got relegated this year. Shit fan you are, sums up our club, fickle delusional fans"
NUFC,3d03rw,letsgohome45,2,Mon Jul 13 15:02:30 2015 UTC,"Bless you, upset that someone else has a different opinion to you.   Colo was shit all season. Nothing more and nothing less, it's not the defence that kept us up, it was Cisse mostly being able to bang in the goals when it mattered."
NUFC,3d03rw,JonnyArtois,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:07:25 2015 UTC,"It's mostly him wanting to bail out on our club, which is entirely his fault. Every foreign player has family somewhere else. He had family when he signed.  He had a lot of good years for us, but I wouldn't include last year. He's about done. Without the attempted backstab, he would deserve a big send off."
NUFC,3d03rw,blackandwhitearmy,4,Mon Jul 13 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"Me either. I know he has declined a bit, but he's been great for us over the years.   Stayed and helped us get back up and was a leader for a good while.  He will be a miss in my eyes."
NUFC,3d03rw,kicka11,2,Sun Jul 12 11:50:34 2015 UTC,"He would be a miss but he is on £3-4 million a year, as he has been since he signed. His performance, the two good years apart, has not justified this."
NUFC,3d03rw,Hollea,2,Sun Jul 12 16:55:02 2015 UTC,I was and am a big fan of Colo. However I can definitely understand how people can be turning against him considering he's been pining to go back to Argentina and declined greatly compared to how he once was for us.
NUFC,3d03rw,Zerosix_K,2,Sun Jul 12 12:28:17 2015 UTC,"Providing we get someone else in, let him go. He's past his prime and keeps saying he wants to go back home. Let Palace deal with that nonsense."
NUFC,3d03rw,thetruth3402,3,Sun Jul 12 15:44:13 2015 UTC,Second rate player for a second rate manager.
NUFC,3d03rw,thetruth3402,16,Sun Jul 12 11:27:30 2015 UTC,I don't think it's fair calling him a second rate player. He has given us a lot.
NUFC,3d03rw,rooparoop,8,Sun Jul 12 11:43:22 2015 UTC,Where has he been the past two seasons? The captain should be a strong presence that holds his teammates accountable both on and off the pitch.    Our glorious leader meanwhile looks disinterested at all times. He doesn't inspire any confidence or accountability in those around him. Not to mention his level of performance has dropped off significantly. If I had to guess I'd say he's been dreaming of Argentina for years.    I'd rather he do that for another club.
NUFC,3d03rw,kicka11,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:37:59 2015 UTC,this last season he was turning his back from shots instead of stepping up - absolutely inexcusable from a cb captain.
NUFC,3d03rw,Positive_Rage,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:48:15 2015 UTC,I think there's a difference between saying he's shit (he's clearly not) and saying he's not a great player. He is a decent player who has underperformed for at least 2 years. I would still personally keep him but his wages are huge and if a decent deal came in I would move him on. But please God Williamson has to go with him.
NUFC,3d03rw,daveofreckoning,-1,Sun Jul 12 16:59:19 2015 UTC,"lol second rate, he's a class-act with an Olympic gold medal."

NUFC,3cy7ud,KebabMaster,21,Sat Jul 11 21:19:52 2015 UTC,Looks like Porto and Roma were both unwilling to go to 12.    Never thought I'd see the day when we're outbidding other clubs for top players.
NUFC,3cy7ud,thetruth3402,10,Sat Jul 11 21:45:25 2015 UTC,It's Ashley's policy of paying all cash all up front. Hard for other teams to compete against it. One good thing from his regime I guess.

NUFC,3cy7ud,CaptainGo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:11:11 2015 UTC,It's a smart business move. 12 million pounds today will always cost less today than in the future.
NUFC,3cy7ud,TheLongBall,3,Mon Jul 13 14:49:19 2015 UTC,Outbidding other top clubs as well
NUFC,3cy7ud,nufcneilo,15,Sun Jul 12 08:20:25 2015 UTC,"I still really hope we get Austin. I think Mitrovic seems a bit of a gamble personally, if we had Austin to work with him it could be a good partnership.  Also it seems we might be offering Cabella as an exchange for Thauvin which would be a shame, he had a rough season but he showed potential near the end. I think he could work well with Wijnaldum."
NUFC,3cy7ud,AlphaPot,13,Sat Jul 11 22:00:37 2015 UTC,Cabella was highly rated in Ligue 1. Thauvin was rated worst team of the season. I hope we stick with Cabella as well.
NUFC,3cy7ud,warhawk32,3,Sat Jul 11 22:20:47 2015 UTC,Thauvin is a much better wide player than Cabella is. I like Cabella but he's a number 10 and he's not going to get the chance to play there for us.
NUFC,3cy7ud,Get_Piccolo,3,Sun Jul 12 02:00:02 2015 UTC,That may be true but I would still like to give Cabella a chance. Also if we are trying to get rid of him for a wide player thauvin would not be my first choice.
NUFC,3cy7ud,warhawk32,2,Sun Jul 12 09:07:44 2015 UTC,"Give Cabella a chance where though? He can't be effective on the wing, in the centre we have De Jong, Sissoko and now Gini who all as best fitted to that same position. I would personally keep Cabella, sell Sissoko and play De Jong upfront if he can manage it."
NUFC,3cy7ud,johndrama,5,Sun Jul 12 12:38:45 2015 UTC,"Me too, think he had a rough season under bad management. He has so much potential and you can see that every game he played, especially against Chelsea."
NUFC,3cy7ud,spoonsforeggs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:21:03 2015 UTC,He has a lot of potential but I don't see how he fits in the team. Him or Sissoko has to go.
NUFC,3cy7ud,johndrama,2,Sun Jul 12 12:41:44 2015 UTC,Adding him and Austin to the side and sorting out a Cb I think we'd be at our strongest we've been in years....I don't think we will sign Austin tho.
NUFC,3cy7ud,DarkStanley,12,Sun Jul 12 08:36:08 2015 UTC,"Lots of stuff in that article. A quick recap:   Mitrovic deal is close, Anderlecht would prefer to sell to NUFC Austin and Thauvin remain on our radar Vuckic to be sold to Bolton Coloccini to be put up for sale Krul to get a new contract And apparently we are after Antonio Rudiger, a deal I reported over a month ago #RightAgain #ITK"
NUFC,3cy7ud,ThinWhiteMale,6,Sat Jul 11 21:37:45 2015 UTC,Colo up for sale? I wouldn't mind that if we bought two top cb's but I can see us only signing one cb so keeping colo would make sense.
NUFC,3cy7ud,Casual_Star,3,Sat Jul 11 21:48:54 2015 UTC,I'd still prefer Austin i think. Would be over the moon with rudiger though! but if colo is going then rudiger and matip please fatty! also I'd be kind of sad to see vuckic not given a chance under the new coaches.
NUFC,3cy7ud,Canettie27,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:51:05 2015 UTC,"I have always like Vuckic myself. On Fifa I always played well with him, I don't think he's ever really been given a proper go in a Newcastle shirt."
NUFC,3cy7ud,nufcneilo,2,Sun Jul 12 08:21:40 2015 UTC,He hasn't really proven himself in lower leagues tho never mind premier league
NUFC,3cy7ud,banty86,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:48:10 2015 UTC,He would make a like for like sub for SDJ
NUFC,3cy7ud,Canettie27,3,Sun Jul 12 12:45:35 2015 UTC,Rudiger would be an insane signing.
NUFC,3cy7ud,rewindthegamer,3,Sat Jul 11 22:50:33 2015 UTC,He's good I take it? Never heard of him before.
NUFC,3cy7ud,JohnWasTaken,2,Sun Jul 12 08:00:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's really promising. Very strong and fast. He became a starter for Stuttgart two seasons ago when he was 20 years old, I think he was injured a lot last season so he didn't get to play as much. Primarily a CB but can also play RB."
NUFC,3cy7ud,rewindthegamer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:30:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks, he sounds really good. Do you think he's better than Matip? I like that he can cover RB because we're really short there if Janmaat gets injured."
NUFC,3cy7ud,JohnWasTaken,2,Sun Jul 12 09:03:15 2015 UTC,Apparently Cabella is being offered as part of the deal for Thauvin. It's only the Daily Mail reporting that though.
NUFC,3cy7ud,Frank1892,3,Sat Jul 11 22:02:22 2015 UTC,I'd be really disappointed if we let Cabella go. We should be aiming to have Cabella and Thauvin on both wings so we actualy have a genuine threat from both sides rather than Gouffran running around on the left.
NUFC,3cy7ud,JohnWasTaken,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:00:24 2015 UTC,Cabella can't play on the wing very well. He probably doesn't want to either.
NUFC,3cy7ud,johndrama,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:40:28 2015 UTC,"He'd be great on the left wing, he assisted a couple of goals from out there last season and he has the option to cut in on his strong foot and shoot."
NUFC,3cy7ud,JohnWasTaken,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:57:48 2015 UTC,Also Ashley pledging to spend £60m but that might not be new
NUFC,3cy7ud,CaptainGo,3,Sat Jul 11 21:42:22 2015 UTC,Carver appears to have scared the shit out of him
NUFC,3cy7ud,Opelle,7,Sun Jul 12 01:12:09 2015 UTC,Plot twist: Carver is actually a genius and sacrificed his reputation to help the club!
NUFC,3cy7ud,daveofreckoning,3,Sun Jul 12 10:41:49 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Fuck's going on?
NUFC,3cy7ud,DarkStanley,3,Sat Jul 11 22:37:52 2015 UTC,Has anyone ever referred to two of anything as a spree....
NUFC,3cy7ud,meganev,6,Sun Jul 12 15:11:42 2015 UTC,I'd rather we just stumped up the £15m for Austin.
NUFC,3cy7ud,iCreativeLogic,2,Sat Jul 11 23:41:19 2015 UTC,"Dunno why I reckon Porto or Roma will snatch this one away from us last minutes, especially after his agent (his father) quoting saying he'll sign in coming hours yesterday. Now hes saying they're ""waiting for another club"" as in Porto and Roma to make a move. Rather have Austin than Mitrovic if Newcastle aint his prefer choice."
NUFC,3cy7ud,billsbackers66,7,Sat Jul 11 22:51:53 2015 UTC,Newcastle isn't Austin's preferred either though. He wants something in London.
NUFC,3cy7ud,nufcneilo,4,Sun Jul 12 00:11:33 2015 UTC,Apparently Mitrovic likes Newcastle and said it was his second favourite club while at Partizan
NUFC,3cy7ud,ThinWhiteMale,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:27:49 2015 UTC,This I find hard to believe! Unless he has some sort of connection to the club or city...?
NUFC,3cy7ud,JonnyArtois,6,Sun Jul 12 08:22:43 2015 UTC,"He loved Shearer, apparently"
NUFC,3cy7ud,KingNashII,2,Sun Jul 12 10:05:20 2015 UTC,The new Berbatov? Loves Shearer...everyone thinks he likes Newcastle....possibly...

NUFC,3cy7ud,RealBrutus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:50:42 2015 UTC,well the rule is release good news on a sunday lets hope for a snap of him popping out of the airport tomorrow
NUFC,3cy7ud,bambler,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:57:01 2015 UTC,"Would be ecstatic if this proves true, but the mirror isn't known for its's credibility."
NUFC,3cy7ud,JonnyArtois,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:14:49 2015 UTC,"No that's true, but they are the preferred media supplier now and you'd assume an agreement like that means they would get some sort of inside track on the club."
NUFC,3cy7ud,bambler,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:35:46 2015 UTC,"preferred media supplier   That probably makes them the most credible for news about Newcastle. Cannot see them throwing around rumours, considering Mike Ashley has banned media outlets for less."
NUFC,3cy7ud,lateraligator,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:03:29 2015 UTC,Yeah that's why I think there was so much information in the article about a number of different topics.

NUFC,3cwcvt,ThinWhiteMale,31,Sat Jul 11 09:31:13 2015 UTC,"Do we change this to ""I don't believe it until he kicks a ball"" now?"
NUFC,3cwcvt,iansf,25,Sat Jul 11 09:33:20 2015 UTC,I think that rule means Emmanuel Riviere still isn't confirmed.
NUFC,3cwcvt,NUFCThreatLevel,5,Sat Jul 11 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"Don't say that, he might get 3 burst lungs and be out all season now."

NUFC,3cwcvt,Frank1892,5,Sat Jul 11 11:10:12 2015 UTC,He has to kick a ball over the line within 24 hours or he'l get sent back to Holland.
NUFC,3cwcvt,AlphaPot,2,Sat Jul 11 09:43:44 2015 UTC,"Surely you mean ""through the door."""
NUFC,3cwcvt,mikedepriest,3,Sat Jul 11 10:48:19 2015 UTC,"At least,  I won't get too excited until he kicks a ball.  I was stoked over de Jong and he's hardly kicked a ball for us!"

NUFC,3cwcvt,Shake_n_bake90,16,Sat Jul 11 09:45:31 2015 UTC,"Liverpool fan coming in peace.   Just wanted to say congrats and what a great signing i think this is. We paid twice as much for Fimino who is equal to Wijnaldum in terms of age and talent.   I know sometimes the business done (or not done) is questioned a lot on Tyneside but hope for you lot that this is start of a different style in the transfer market. At least you don't get ripped off for players.   Finally, think this season will be a big improvement over last. Rumours of Matip, Mitrovic and others will definitely improve a squad with talent already!"
NUFC,3cwcvt,XabiTheGreat,13,Sat Jul 11 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"I am so so pleased with this. Hold me back lads, I'm starting to feel optimistic about the season."
NUFC,3cwcvt,grim0thy,9,Sat Jul 11 09:40:27 2015 UTC,"Willo is still a first choice centre back, that'll bring you down a bit!"
NUFC,3cwcvt,meganev,9,Sat Jul 11 12:42:32 2015 UTC,That's me deflated for the coming season. Back to normality. Normal service resumed.
NUFC,3cwcvt,grim0thy,8,Sat Jul 11 16:15:05 2015 UTC,So not only do we sign someone for over £10m but when the manager says 'we're going to get it over the line' it actually happens instead of taking another week.  repent your sins for the end times are nigh
NUFC,3cwcvt,tomtom_94,4,Sat Jul 11 11:19:32 2015 UTC,KOKS OUT LADS (we don't need him trialling any more as we already have our quota of Dutch midfidlders)

NUFC,3d0987,WigglyParrot,7,Sun Jul 12 11:56:31 2015 UTC,He's probably going to be earning bank over in the US.
NUFC,3d0987,The_White_Django,4,Sun Jul 12 12:07:00 2015 UTC,His wage demands would be easily above what we would pay. Must be around 100k/w and I'm pretty sure we have a limit (for the so called purple players) of 60-70k/w. The mls clubs can pay their designated foreign players as much as they want.
NUFC,3d0987,northyj0e,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:12:34 2015 UTC,"He's still young, he might be willing to take a bit less to play regularly in the premier league?  Or I guess not, but I still think he would be a cracking signing ! Never mind eh :)"
NUFC,3d0987,SLKgringo,3,Sun Jul 12 12:20:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but the pay check at Man Utd will have probably spoilt him. Shame because I think with regular games he would bang them in"

It's not a though we've scouted some reltively unknown potential good player and spent a safe 7 million knowing if he performs we've got a potential massive profit to sell.  Wijnaldum is a highly rated player, perhaps not enough for the big clubs, but he commands this fee. But still, if he performs, it's gonna take Carroll money to get him surely?"
NUFC,3cwgzo,Frank1892,2,Sat Jul 11 11:59:07 2015 UTC,"3rd most expensive in Newcastle history too?  I mean.. I'd like to think we would go for 15-20m players regularly, but I just don't see it.  This season, yeah, I see 5 10m+ players come in, upcoming windows? Maybe 1-2 at the most at that kind of price?   As long as we aren't a revolving door and build instead of sell for profit, we will be improve vastly."
NUFC,3cwgzo,WigglyParrot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:50:34 2015 UTC,"I think he meant he wanted 5 £10-15 million players in over the next 3 windows. Austin or Mitrovic in that price band too and a defender for under £10 million but still expensive like £7 or £8 million is what we seem to be after. Nkoulou could fit that (marseille seem to be getting ripped apart) and es a real leader at the back, could make Taylor play at his best and Lascelles."

Yeah, we were also linked with:  http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2015/07/09/report-newcastle-united-consider-7m-move-for-serie-a-star-faouzi/  This guy, although I haven't seen anything since.  I guess we could still buy top defenders without going over the 10m mark really.  But if this is the new standard, and that's a big IF, i'm excited."
NUFC,3cwgzo,WigglyParrot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:08:00 2015 UTC,I think he's a left back. Still wouldn't say no to him!
NUFC,3cwgzo,thepresidentsturtle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:23:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry I just meant for the defence overall, I think we need a LB with having sold Santon and Haidara being our main LB with Dummett as cover?   Not sure I'm so keen on that, ha."

NUFC,3cwgzo,charkoteow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:26:58 2015 UTC,I'm not.. wondering why you think that though? :)

NUFC,3cwgzo,charkoteow,3,Sat Jul 11 12:08:12 2015 UTC,Haha I see !   Erm.. nope.. Just a geordie :p
NUFC,3cwgzo,WigglyParrot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:17:10 2015 UTC,"Yup Owen, Shearer then Wijnaldum in that order. Think Owen was £16 mill then Shearer at £15 mill."
