USMC,3e0x5i,ThatJarhead,2,Tue Jul 21 11:29:15 2015 UTC,Those points are 'freebies' given to Marines who are still on their IRR contract time. Typically the 3 to 4 years after serving 5 to 4 years on active duty. It is the remainder of your 8 year contract. Anyway these points are awarded to you for simply being in the system still. It takes 50 points total annual each anniversary of your Pay Entry Base Date in order to earn a satisfactory year. If you're aiming to get SAT years then you'd need another 35 points to do so.

However you are fucking right about the VA. I tried using them for healthcare and I get a call from them saying that Camp Lejeune lost my medical records. Okay. Then I had an appointment at the VA hospital in Atlanta a couple of months ago, which went fucking terrible.

No, there's no gravity keeping them glued to their desks, there's just a ""fuck you Jack because I got mine"" ethic that they have accepted and now work to entrench.

All you have to pay after is that 20 dollar registration fee and your books. But you essentially go to school for free without touching any of your benefits yet. This is at any junior college/community college. Even tech schools run by the city.  Maybe this is more towards the guys that are already out but everyone should know this: GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FIRST. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR GI BILL  Also, I've heard of other states offering the same, look into it."

It was a bear, but very rewarding now that it's done. I used my TA for just about all of it, taking the government for an extra 18k over four years. Spent about 4k out of pocket to keep up the pace I had set for myself while recruiting, in order to have it done in time to PCS.   Highly recommend."
USMC,3dq156,DisenchantedDevilDog,2,Sat Jul 18 16:22:55 2015 UTC,Check out WGU.  Regionally accredited just like the standard universities in your state. Every school I have looked into for my masters accepts it.
USMC,3dq156,Sugarblood83,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:56:26 2015 UTC,"I completed 64 hours in 6 semesters over the course of two years while on AD, but TA didn't cover all of it so some came out of pocket. This got me my BS as I was able to transfer 60 credits from when I went to college prior to enlisting.  I went to my school's satellite campus on base when I was able to, but I probably did about half of that 64 hours online since my job required me to travel a lot. To cater to adult learners, my school offered 8 week courses (as opposed to 16 weeks), but this doubles the amount of hours per week you'll spend in class.  I highly suggest you do not attend an online school if you want a marketable degree (UoP, AMU, etc). Many brick & mortar schools now are cashing in on the online market and have an online campus such as the Penn State one you mentioned. A degree earned online in that manner is indistinguishable from one earned from physically attending class. Your degree will just say Penn State, not Penn State Online. Many people consider online degrees to be inferior for several reasons that are not really relevant anymore. Online study has come a long way, and in my opinion is the more difficult option since it requires so much more self motivation, teaching, and work (but you'll learn the material better).  The main downside to using solely online classes is it will limit your degree options since some things just aren't possible to do online, i.e. advanced science and chemistry classes, or anything that requires labs or practicals.  All that being said, I wouldn't start off going straight for the four year degree. Get your associate's first. That way when you start looking for places to get your bachelor's, the schools you apply to can't pick and choose which credits will transfer. They either accept your two year degree or don't.  Now go max your TA benefits, that shit is free money.  edit: and do your FAFSA, I qualified for PELL grants at E-3, E-4, and E-5. It's money you don't have to pay back."
USMC,3dq156,danpage617,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:09:02 2015 UTC,Depends what base your located on but cool thing is that some community colleges come to your base and have teachers offer classes on base through their community college.

I don't like Phoenix because they require you to be somewhere at a set schedule.  I like to cram 2 weeks and finish a class and then deal with work for a month or two, then cram again to finish another class - so WGU worked really well for me.

Mostly because the only deployments on the east coast for 6842s to Afghanistan were done by MACS-2, and you only need about 4 or 5 weather Marines for one tour. You also pretty much needed to be an NCO as a 6842 to go on the MEU at the intelligence battalions.  Don't base your enlistment on the fact if you deployed or not, especially if you're in a tiny MOS. If it happens, awesome. If it doesn't happen, eh no big deal. I had a buddy that enlisted as a motor t reservist a few months before I did and got to go to Morocco for a week.

It's not a stretch to assume this was an act of terrorism. Even if he wasn't associated with ISIS specifically, this was an act of terrorism and one that ISIS would commit if they could.  No matter what you say, I'm going to believe this was an act of terrorism stemming from US involvement in the Middle East.

I was a new Lcpl who had just gotten out of MOS school (doing IT/computer stuff) and had learned how to send a direct message to other computers on the network (it would popup on their computer). I asked a federal civilian employee in my shop what his computer name was, thinking it'd be funny to send him a random message saying, ""you are a homo."" He tells me the computer name and I send it off but he doesn't respond at all. I ask him if he got it and he says he didn't get anything. I ask him to confirm his computer name and when he replies, I realize that I just sent the god damned message to the wrong computer. Somewhere out there on base, someone got a popup message that read, ""you are a homo.""  I panicked but didn't say shit, hoping it was some PFC out there who would laugh about it. Sat there and sweat it out for a good hour before a fucking CAPTAIN comes in asking for me by name. Fuck.  I stood up and responded. He asked me if I had sent him a message telling him he was a homo. I about shit my pants. I apologized and (standing at the POA) explained it was a mistake and was supposed to have been sent to a friend in our shop. He laughed and asked if I really thought he was a homo. I assured him no sir and he told me to carry on.   He walked out the door and as soon as the door closed, i hear the NCOIC go, ""OH IS THAT RIGHT LCPL""  Shit."

Well everything was going well & at the end of the culminating event, they tell all role players to police calling the Afghan village we were at.  They said (like they always do) if it doesn't grow, it goes.  Well nobody told us EOD used the village for training as well.  I see on the ground, outside of the perimeter wall, what looks to be a McDonald's cup lid.  Only it looked like it had been there for a while (dirty as fuck).  I bend down & pick it up... It was a fucking toe-popper.  Everyone just scattered like roaches & I'm just standing there with a land mine in my hand.  So I just put it down slowly & backed away.  Needless to say, police call was over after that.  I got my ass chewed pretty good for that.  Think I saw God too.  After evening chow, all the seniors that chewed my ass brought beer to my room.  They pretty much apologized for tearing me a new one cause I didn't know any better & all that good stuff.  At the end of the night, I was reminded how much of a dumb boot I was & that was that.

I had a little trouble getting out the cam pin so what do I do? I grab my gerber and yank it out that way. It falls out and lands at the edge underneath my seat. I try to reach for it and OOPS...there it goes. It falls through a gap right around where you fasten the seat belt. It lands on one of the metal plates underneath the vehicle. Shit...  Thinking my world had now turned upside down I chalked it up and told one of the officers in HQ platoon (I was moved to HQ platoon before my second deployment) and he just half-smiled and then told me to tell one of the gunnies (we had two; one company gysgt and a gysgt who was acting platoon sergeant for weapons platoon). So I go over and tell the weapons platoon sergeant what had happened. He just looks at me and starts walking over to the HMMWV. He asks me for two cleaning rods, puts them together, gets underneath the vehicle, pokes the cleaning rods through a small hole underneath the metal plate and out falls the cam pin. He stands up, hands it to me and gives me that ""Here you go, dumbass"" smile.   ""I sincerely thought you were going to kill me, gunny."" ""Shit happens sometimes.""

""Fuck"" was my reply. Mike battery was already there for 3 weeks when I arrived and met my gun crew. My chief was a Sgt and his a-chief was a Sgt. Shortly after I found out that the a-chief had much more time in rank and time in service than my chief. Never having been around Marines outside of schools I didn't really grasp billet over rank at the time. So I went ahead and asked them both, while they were sitting next to each other, ""So why is Sgt Junior the chief and not you Sgt Senior?"" I had no idea that I had touched a nerve and their cold dead stares they gave each other then directed towards me... I just walked out and grabbed a shovel on my way for the inevitable hole that I would be digging for that question.              Another one: I got to attend SASO course/instructor course (whatever) during my expedited workup for Fallujah (as a PFC.) This butter bar that was also in the class had me lead a night mission cordon and search that consisted of a squad of 0311s who were just redoing the class so they could deploy for the umpteenth time and a squad consisting of staff and O from some tank unit as well as the other PFCs I was going to Fallujah with.

I would reverse that proposition, because in the present instance what we are against is a no brainer.

In his world-view, he has his absolute certainties, while we are sunk in sybaritic indulgences. To prove him wrong, we must first know that he is wrong. We must agree on what matters: kissing in public places, bacon sandwiches, disagreement, cutting-edge fashion, literature, generosity, water, a more equitable distribution of the world's resources, movies, music, freedom of thought, beauty, love.

USMC,3dpesd,pootastic,3,Sat Jul 18 15:34:34 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I've spent like 15-16 years hiking, I've been through like 4-5 commercial packs and then I've gone through the ALICE>MOLLE>ILBE>FILBE packs over the last 13 years in the Marines. While my experience is anecdotal, here's what I've learned when it comes to hiking for my own enjoyment (most recently a week on the AT hiking the GA section):  The ALICE pack was not much in the way of capacity, but with replacement straps, an added chest strap and civilian made replacement waistband it was at least comfortable. There's a mod you can do where you cut up an ISOMAT and put it in the center and it makes it even better. That center metal bar will always bend and that rivet will eventually pop out. That kinda bites. Mine have always squeaked. You can get a larger pack too that helps with capacity. It's rugged, you can pack it easily in the field. Minimal support for externally strapped items, though. Aside from an ISO below.   MOLLE: Hated it. The plastic frame cracked when strapped to vehicles. Heavy for what it was. Everything before and after was better lol.  ILBE: I actually liked this one a lot. Lots of external support for strapping. The narrow design made it fit on board ships really easily, as well as narrow trails. It's actually extremely comfortable when you're slick, (NO FLAK) because you can shape the back support bars to fit your back. And you can get different sized waist belts, raise or lower them etc. If you're just going out for a day or two, you can use the assault pack and take the top pouch from the ILBE and clip it to the top of the assault pack for added capacity. Downsides: Lots of straps= a lot of extra weight. The narrow design limited capacity somewhat, and definitely made it tricky to pack up really well in the dark. Of course, that's with massive USMC gear lists... if using it as a civilian hiking bag, you'd easily run seven+ days from it. It's uncomfortable when worn over a Flak with SAPIs. The shoulder straps are relatively narrow where they go over your shoulder, so on long hikes with a heavy weight it'll cut off your circulation. It would always make my hands swell and go numb. Lol.   The new ILBE replacement is nice, it's plastic frame is a lot stronger than the old MOLLE ones. It's wide, so it's easy to pack and carries a lot. I've seen a couple shoulder straps fail, and my waist belt loosens on its own which is a bit annoying, but at least the design is rugged and has lots of options for sustainment pouches and such. I wouldn't use this as a civilian bag though because while it's a massive improvement in comfort when work over a FLAK, it's a downgrade from the ILBE in comfort when worn slick.  Civilian bag: I'm now using an Osprey Kestrel 38 I love it. I wore it for a 6 day on the AT and it was great. When I hike on my own, this is my go to. I also use it for ruck training on my own. Oh, and I think I paid $170 for it, with the REI lifetime return warranty.  Bottom line: If I'm hiking for fun on my own, there's no way in hell I'm gonna use a heavy military pack that's designed to survive a war. They have extra straps, thicker material, things like radio pouches and such that work great when I'm given a three page packing list for the field, but are simply dead weight when I'm section hiking the AT, or spending a few days in the Blue Ridge Mtns.  Like I said, these are just personal observations, but lets just say my civilian pack for 4-6 days in the woods weighs less than 50lbs and is super comfortable. And that's carrying some comfort gear that I could cut even further if I needed to. Hope this helps a little bit!"

How long have you had it and how is it holding up? I loved my Osprey that I had in the 1990s, but the ones I looked at recently at REI seemed flimsier. Of course, it could be that I'm not familiar with the latest fabrics, so maybe I'm wrongly equating thickness with durability."

USMC,3dpesd,budrick007,2,Sun Jul 19 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"They are heavy and full of straps. Like straps everywhere. The purpose of them is to make the pack nice and snug, but having to cinch them all down and the tape the excess is a pain in the ass.   The webbing is nice- I load my pack out like my old ALICE pack- hydration/sustainment pouches on the sides for all the stuff I use every day. That part is handy.   I prefer the external frame of this pack to the old ILBE pack, and this is MUCH more comfortable than the IBLE with a flak on because they designed them to it, but for straight backpacking/camping, I'd take my old ILBE or an ALICE with a souped up waist band versus this guy."

USMC,3dpesd,IBuildRobots,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:24:02 2015 UTC,"i have done almost all of the PCT.  Missing stretches in  No. CA.  Avoided the grow ops.  I have used three different packs.  First was an 1965 Adventure-16.  Worked well enough, but aluminum frame needed replacing twice.  Second was a Kelty.   Liked it pretty well.  It just didn't have pockets arranged  the way I preferred.  Finally. I have a Coleman FlexiFrame.  They don't make  that one any more, but it  is a great pack.  Good capacity, good pocket arrangement, quality  materials and good weight distribution.    So, I  cannot recommend a specific pack, here are what I  look for.  Capacity,  How much stuff can I fit into the pack.  Pocket arrangement and  locations.  Does it have one or two side pocket  sets?   Is  there a pocket at the  top behind the head for maps?    Are the closures good (zippers, velcro etc)?   Zippers should be large toothed and  robust.   Velcro works pretty well, but clogs when  dirty.  Water proof or water resistant.  The difference is important.    How many attachment points are there for things like sleeping bag and tent and fishing pole, etc.  The weight distribution system.  How  well does  the belly band and  the shoulder straps work to keep the weight even and manageable.   Then there are considerations  like type of clothe and type of frame.  I avoid aluminum frames, they never stood up for me.  Enjoy the back country.  Take only pictures, leave only footprints."
USMC,3dpesd,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:42:18 2015 UTC,"Coleman FlexiFrame   Man, that was a great pack! Kinda wish I hadn't given mine away. I remember a lot of my friends assuming it was strictly for casuals, just because it wasn't obnoxiously expensive and had the Coleman name."
USMC,3dpesd,pootastic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:53:46 2015 UTC,I don't like how they decided to push weight out and away from your body. At least with the ILBE everything was kept vertical.
USMC,3dpesd,ConvertsToMetric,2,Sat Jul 18 06:46:30 2015 UTC,"They did that to make it more compatible with a flak on. The ILBE was incredibly comfortable to hump without a flak on, but as far as carrying your shit, it was the equivalent of using a damn pillowcase."
USMC,3dpesd,IBuildRobots,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that the ILBE was super comfortable if you were slick. Especially with those two metal bars you could bend to shape to your back, raising or lowering the hip pad, and getting different sized hip pads... it was awesome for that. Also, on ship it was narrow so it was easy to move around in the passageways. But yeah, totally agree it wasn't good for carrying capacity. Specifically,  I could carry a good amount in it... with exceptional packing. But When it's 0400, dark, and you're packing up in ten minutes in the field, it's a PITA to get everything to fit because of the shape and the access. The new pack fits better over a flak, and it's easier to pack, but it's not nearly as comfortable slick as the ILBE. I guess you win some, you lose some. I will say that the new pack, when you add the sustainment pouches and assault pack to it, is comically enormous."
USMC,3dpesd,pootastic,2,Sun Jul 19 07:10:06 2015 UTC,OH GOD ship movement. Moving around the damn BHR with the FILBE pack was comical.

I carry a lot of comm stuff, so a buttpack with suspenders type setup is nice for some of my personal gear if you're using the Assault Pack for Radios and batteries and such. We are definitely getting heavy, though.   Hell, in Iraq I regularly only brought out a little food, some water and a poncho liner for personal gear to keep my weight down to stuff I needed to fight. But we've gotten really heavy. It'll be interesting to see what we come up with in the next 10 years to reduce weight. The new lightweight helmet is the type of stuff we need to be working on. It's light, it's suspension system is an order of magnitude better than the old one, and it definitely works."

USMC,3dopev,darkrobstar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:06:26 2015 UTC,Something like 6 years of drilling (one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer) is equal to 4 gears active.  Doing both reserves and school is doable and a good way to network.  Depending on your mos and/or billet your mc work outside of drill can be a handful.
USMC,3dopev,ikantbreave,3,Sat Jul 18 06:42:45 2015 UTC,"The absolute best part of doing reserves after active duty is that you are a ""non-obligor"". Which means you can quit whenever you want. If the unit sucks, you get too busy with civilian life, etc. it's a good way to stay connected to the Corps without the trapped feeling.  I did three years reserves after active duty and just got bored but your experience may differ. One caveat, this was 15 years ago soooo things may have changed. Check with the unit you want to join. Good luck, SF."
USMC,3dopev,Semper_OFP,2,Sat Jul 18 07:41:37 2015 UTC,Don't contract with the reserves. Stay IRR and if you want to drill with a unit go talk to them.   You can walk away at any point in time if you're just courtesy drilling.

Bottom line, you aren't going to understand your brother. Don't try and don't get frustrated with him. Just be there for him and don't give up on him. Try to get him in contact with some veterans organizations, and talk to a counselor, not a psychiatrist"
USMC,3dma1o,bmouzon,6,Fri Jul 17 13:08:45 2015 UTC,"No one has said this yet, so I think I might toss in an alternative to a counselor, or at least a stop gap.  I love diving, and while reading about I came across an article about diving and vets with PTSD.  This guy who had PTSD was talking about how much more diving had helped him than all the counseling and medications he had been trying.  Then I did some more reading in the same vein, and found that there other activities that vets have found that help bring them some peace outside of the counseling+medication combo.  I'm not saying it is necessarily a replacement, but maybe diving or some other activity may really help him find the calm space he needs to get a little healing or relief.  I'm not a psychiatrist and I don't have PTSD. But as a vet, I'd like to toss my idea in if nothing else helps.    Here is that article: http://www.npr.org/2014/09/07/346582682/some-veterans-find-peace-thanks-to-scuba-gear-quiet-waters"

(Some vets have ear damage that they can't pressurize, plus scuba gear is spendy, but a good Cressi snorkel starter set is $40 on Amazon). If you have springs, clear rivers, or lakes nearby - or if you want to splurge and go to Belize or Curacao - it helped me tremendously, totally quiet and focused like the range, it was nice."
USMC,3dma1o,TheTartanDervish,6,Mon Jul 20 05:03:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely find some Marines he deployed with and ask if they can help. It is very likely that several of them will be willing to help out.   Also as far as the prescribing drugs thing is concerned. A counselor actually usually cannot prescribe drugs, that is a different professional. If he goes to a counselor or a psychologist instead of a Psychiatrist or a Psychopharmacologist than they will focus on him and not on giving him drugs. In general they won't even be licensed to prescribe drugs at all. Their job is to help you deal with your life, past trauma etc..  When people tell me they don't trust counselors or worry about getting drugs prescribed that they don't need I tell them the difference between those who can and cannot prescribe drugs and also share an analogy. Having a counselor or psychologist that you meet with a couple times a month is pretty much the same as having a mentor or a coach in a sport. Or as far as the Marine Corps is concerned maybe that one Staff NCO that took you under his wing and helped you out. Why would someone not want a person whose only job was to advise them and look after them? It's having a coach or mentor for your day to day life. No great athlete became great without the coaches that got them there and most great marines had great leaders as well.  The interesting thing about counseling is that they mostly just listen to you. Often the biggest breakthroughs come from you. So it's not about trusting them, it's about trusting yourself and being honest with them."
USMC,3dma1o,byllc,3,Fri Jul 17 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"Nobody is going to like this answer, but I  am more concerned about your brother than upvotes.  so here goes  Find a mental health professional who specializes in PTSD and drag your bro to see him.   Commit him if necessary.  Just get him to a professional.   Quickly.  Then you need to go to Make the  Connection  and get more detailed information than us nonprofessionals can provide.    Finally, make sure your bro makes his appts and monitor his meds.    This is a lot of responsibility, but the alternative is another veteran suicide."

Something that also helps is buying a motorcycle.  It helps mentally, but also sometimes has me doing dumb things when I'm feeling extra down and chasing the dragon.  But the fact is that everyone else here is right.  He needs to hear from other Marines, especially guys in his unit.  That's the best thing you can do.  Oftentimes we won't seek out our fellow Marines because we don't want to be a burden to them.  It's kinda ingrained in us.    Lastly, the single most important thing we need upon separation is purpose.  Being in pretty much makes all of the other parts of your life seem less important.  The volume gets turned down and we frequently just sink because nothing seems to really matter here in the civilian world.  Things are entirely too easy here.  It causes depression.    As far as medication goes, this sounds weird, but people want to put us on anti-depressants.  I ended up getting diagnosed for ADHD even though I don't think I am.

I had one shithawk at the PX try to tell me I needed to leave and shave my mustache right then and there just because he didn't like it.

USMC,3dkv4a,gpewett,7,Fri Jul 17 14:25:39 2015 UTC,Dude...I always argue that the low Reg is the ONLY haircut that falls within the order. It's the only one that is gradually Faded from the base of the hairline.  Damn high fades and shit are not gradually faded
USMC,3dkv4a,gpewett,6,Fri Jul 17 07:10:35 2015 UTC,"Yes but doesn't the fact that it states a flamboyant haircut is decided at commands discretion negate all of this stuff. Also I heard the order states only one haircut per pay period not per week, is this true?"
USMC,3dkv4a,FearErection,5,Fri Jul 17 11:42:20 2015 UTC,"Try reading the order.   Edit: That came off a bit grumpy, it was early. Sorry. So the order says zero to three evenly graduated. Zero is obviously impossible every single day (unless you cut your hair every morning) so we have to figure out what the maximum allowable length is. ""Fresh haircuts Monday morning"" is one interpretation, ""the 1st and 15th"" is another, and ""an eighth of an in maximum"" (in keeping with the sideburns) is yet another. The order itself doesn't specify."
USMC,3dkv4a,Shotgunjack1880,3,Fri Jul 17 14:10:56 2015 UTC,"I completely understand that and I have read the order, my point is your command could just say they consider a low ""flamboyant"" and that's that. Or am I reading that paragraph of the order incorrect"
USMC,3dkv4a,WheresMyDinner,4,Fri Jul 17 17:01:35 2015 UTC,"The word ""flamboyant"" doesn't occur in the order. ""Unsightly"" does, in reference to hair protruding from beneath a cover, but that's a weak subjective argument."

The press conference still hasn't started but those are all the reports coming in from the local paper to Fox News to the AP. The shooter started at the Marine Corps recruiting station up the highway, did a mag dump in the front door then went to the reserve center.        This is my old unit. Press conference is starting. Will update later. Press conference over. Shooter started at the recruiting center as a drive by. Then was pursued by the PD and went to the reserve center.     He killed 4 people but the FBI SAOC didn't say specifically that it was all Marines that were killed. As I typed this though the USMC confirmed either by Twitter or FB that it was all Marines that were killed. One local PD was shot in the ankle in the gun fight that killed the shooter at the reserve center. The NOK haven't all been notified yet so no names ATM.

That being said, let this act of violence not only remind us that there are those out there who are willing to defend those that can't defend themselves, but also the dedication and valor that is associated with holding the title of a Marine.

USMC,3diulz,barelyonhere,3,Fri Jul 17 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, so to answer your question simply: yes. An intel specialist is just an analyst. We take the ""news"" of the world, whether it us regular news, reporting from or about other countries, or we can set up specific presentations to prepare Marines for deployment/missions. There are a variety of other things, but it's very dependent on where you get stationed and what type of command you're in. So, let's say you work in a grunt unit; you will be doing a lot of drawing on maps. If you work at an intelligence unit, you may be evaluating a specific country for a few years.   All of the other intel fields, generally, are more quantitative. They can have, to some degree, a ""right"" answer. Our field is more ambiguous. If I had to go back, I would have chosen a different intel field, honestly. Ours is full of politics.   All that being said, please feel free to pm me if you have more questions. :)   Edit: Also, any intel field can get you a good job afterwards. It's just dependent on where you would like to live later. Different specialties are sort of clustered in different parts of America."

I'll be taking a job for about half that but at least it's stateside and I can work my way up again.

WE can do 0311 stuff like patrol or mounted, we cross train with the 52s and 31s and occasionally 51s in forms of breach.

One commander loved using us and made sure we were well trained and had plenty of ammo to shoot and get our skills developed. We had it chill, doing fire missions.   The second commander used us as a errand platoon. Split us into two and had one as a light section of mortars while the other was to be used as mobile assault.   We also got Tactical recovery platoon, which is fancy for when a bird goes down we provide security on sight as a first response and look for downed personnel.   mortars are also heavy and odd to carry during any movement with lots and lots of SL2 bull shit."

Your real money maker, if you play your cards right, lies in the airport firefighting cert you get. You can segue that into a six figure job at some large international airports. Especially if you get every cert you can under your belt when you hit your unit.  As for the general ""Marine Corps"" aspect of it, this MOS is unique because we work shift work. Meaning, for 24/48/72 hours we work, eat, sleep, and train at the firehouse like a normal civilian fire department. The guys you work with on shift will be closer to you than brothers and you won't find a bond like it in any other MOS in the corps, save for infantry.

We shoot a TOW maybe once a year (don't know if I should be grateful at that or if I should gripe).   Cons: in our unit death before dismount is a dark joke because when we deploy we go back to being 11's essentially because there are no humvees. Oh and the crew served hikes with the .50s and occasional Mark receiver. Also, everyone in the line companies hate us because they think we are skaters, which is true (don't pretend you wouldn't either if you could).   Edit: didn't mention the Jav, you'd be lucky if you fire that baby once in an enlistment so we don't talk about that."

My advice is to take your trip to MEPS seriously. Dress formally and give proper greetings to everyone you meet (be respectful and treat this like a job interview). Study for the ASVAB, I scored a 92 and it was a huge factor in my waiver recommendation. Most importantly, BE PATIENT. I it took me almost a year from first contacting a recruiter to actually swearing in. Use the time you have to better yourself, learn knowledge, hit the gym and work on your IST scores. I work for my recruiter two days a week and now have five referrals, automatic Pfc. and my recruiter loves me.There's always something you can do to improve yourself. Just don't let the waiting get you down, and realize that if this doesn't get approved it isn't the end of the road. There are plenty of ways to serve your country in other capacities.   TL;DR this nasty Poolee had brain surgery and was given a waiver, tips for what made me successful."
USMC,3dir7g,anonymous_0311,3,Thu Jul 16 19:32:24 2015 UTC,You and your recruiter will probably remain best friends and remain in close contact throughout your Marine Corps career.  Or you will never talk to him again and he will forget your name if he hasn't yet. Have fun in the suck kid.

USMC,3dir7g,bmouzon,2,Thu Jul 16 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"It took somewhere in the neighborhood of 7-8 months and then another week or so before they sent my happy ass back to MEPS.   Some of what plays into this has to do with things that are beyond your control. I.e If they need personnel for a certain mos and you'll take it then they'll speed up the process. There's a lot of variables that come into play that determine the amount of waiting that you'll do. I've seen applicants get denied a waiver then two weeks later someone else gets approved with the exact same thing. All I can say is be patient, because more than likely you're going to wait at least 6 weeks before hearing anything."
USMC,3dir7g,Futuredanish,2,Thu Jul 16 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"A lot of these people are going to have a lot f different answers.

You need to eat or drink things that will neutralize those metabolites. Probably the best thing to eat would be castor oil. It's been used for hundreds of years as a cleaner and works by drawing excess water (and thus the metabolites) out if your body. Probably your best bet. Most drug stores or Walmart will carry it. Good luck.

USMC,3d9004,SeBaseGod,2,Tue Jul 14 13:07:11 2015 UTC,I did a lot of TAD for a reserve unit. From my experience it was a lot easier than being attached  to a normal unit. The I&I always took it easy. Everyone would arrive at 7am and normally be gone by 3pm. Fridays if there was no drill that weekwnd would end at noon normally. Daily tasks were repetitive and easy. I only worked about 50% of the time. We spent a lot of the downtime at the range and doing extra maintenance on tanks and humvees.
USMC,3d9004,bmxkeeler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:05:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty cool. I wanted to use my opportunity at an I&I to actually give back to the reservists. In my unit its not uncommon for the reservists to not get their mos training,get their privileges and role for their operating sysytems. Heck even getting CaC card accessis a hassle. I wanted to be someone who could help facilitate and give my knowledge and help the reservists in a better position to at least learn their job or be prepared to.

USMC,3d9004,bmxkeeler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:16:26 2015 UTC,I did not really get much interaction with the reservists outside if drill. I was with a tank unit so the majority of my time was spent either servicing a vehicle or helping to update reservist SRB's since they weren't always around to keep their records up to date. Lots of calling and paper shuffling.

USMC,3d9004,E5Scoot,2,Tue Jul 14 15:24:20 2015 UTC,"Id say there was a disconnect. They had their stuff to do and we had ours, so it's not like that often overlapped as it was an 03xx company.

It is associated with the New Zealand Army, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the World War I ground forces of the United States Army, contemporary U.S. military drill instructors, state police forces, park rangers and forest rangers (and from them, their logo-cartoon and mascot Smokey Bear), Boy Scouts, and others.  Although the campaign hat is occasionally referred to as a Stetson, this is from its common manufacture in the late 19th century by that company. It should not be confused with the quite different Stetson hat type with a different brim and crease, commonly known as the cowboy hat, and which is more commonly meant by the term ""Stetson"" today. The campaign hat also should not be confused with a slouch hat.

I've always felt that respect worked very much this way, and my experience with WM's was very similar to yours... and LtCol Germano's, evidently:   Germano singled out Marines who couldn't perform three pullups or complete a physical fitness test's 3-mile run in less than 23 minutes. Making these Marines stand, she told them they wouldn't be able to lead their male counterparts in the fleet, witnesses said.   I had this one female SSgt who could do 12 pull-ups and ran a 22 minute 3 mile. The funny thing is that she was almost 40 and overweight, but she smoked all the other women and some of the weaker men. She was a tough old bird who lead from the front, did multiple deployments, was a MCMAP instructor trainer... in other words: A fucking Marine. That's what it boils down to. If you're in the Marine Corps, you need to be a fucking Marine regardless of your gender. IMO, every CMC we've had so far has been too soft on this shit. What we need to do is come out and say: Women need to perform to the same standard as men. You have one calendar year to either get a passing male PFT score or get an ADSEP.  How's that for gender equality?"
USMC,3d4rtl,SD99FRC,12,Mon Jul 13 17:10:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a woman, and I sadly agree that the 90% waste of space statistic.   We're not held to the same standard as the males are, it takes a lot of motivation to be the best you can be if you can skate along just fine at like 25% effort.  Sadly whenever I called other female Marines out on bullshit, I'd be labeled the blue falcon or the angry dyke that hates females. That was actually pretty hilarious because dykes should prefer females right? Anycase the girls didn't like me much."

USMC,3d4rtl,BestNamesTaken,4,Mon Jul 13 18:22:47 2015 UTC,"Like I told a friend earlier. Nothing about this surprises me in the least.  Sounds like typical upper echelon command clashes. One officer wants one thing, the other doesn't share those priorities, and then there's repeated back-stabs as they try to maneuver around eachother. Sounds to me like while this woman was able to garner positive results in some areas (good lord I'd like to applaud the ""your male peers won't respect you if you can't perform physically"" part), she wasn't very good at interacting with people when she didn't get her way. Which will cause problems when it comes to your peers and superiors in the military.  And as a former PMI/CMT, I applaud any effort that actually teaches Marines what they are doing on the range, and not just the classic ""how"" which omits the conceptual understanding in favor of simple repetition. I pushed multiple units through quals with their lowest historical failure rates simply by sitting down with their problem shooters and helping them understand how make sight adjustments did what it did, rather than just telling them how to make clicks based on criteria. Shooting is a science. And it's something the basic Marine Corps actually does a fairly poor job of. Mostly due to the apathy of range personnel."

I worked for a bunch of civilians who didn't give two shits about what I did. I would work 4 hour shifts, swim my ass off, and then go back to the barracks and drink my ass into a comma. Yes a lot of guys got sent to PMO, but there are some good FAPs. We had a fellow 03 get FAPed out to the armory, and now he owns his own gun shop. Like everything in life, you get what you put into it, and I would have reenlisted had they let me stay at the pool. To answer your question, I didn't request it. Our company received x amount of FAPs, and our Company Commander put us where he wanted us. He took care of his squad leaders and team leaders.

If you get FAP'ed on the other hand, it's a quick 6-month break from the BS that is your immediate chain of command.  FAP'ed people almost always get passed up for awards/promotions/etc, just like attached people get the shaft when it comes to getting kudos IN WRITING.  This can have a detrimental effect on your ability to pick up down the road, 'cause of the ""who the fck are you and how did you get here"" mentality of your MOS chain of command.  Remember, people get PCSed ALL the time, and if you're not there when the new Gunny/Major gets there, you're new and you gotta pay your dues.  This doesn't apply to everyone, just telling you from what I saw.  I saw people get FAP'ed to headquarters... and those people NEVER came back.

Got to boot camp and was told to go into a certain line if I was a MCCF recruit.  Talked to the SNCOIC who told me that my MCCF paperwork wasn't in my record book and I needed to write my recruiter to get it cleared up.  Not call, write...yeah.  OK.   I wrote my recruiter about it a couple of times and never got a response, but I never really had much spare energy to worry about it until, two or three weeks before graduation, I get a letter from my recruiter telling admitting he'd fucked up and I didn't, in fact, have the MCCF.  Yeah okay, so I could either push through and complete boot camp or quit right there.  To this day I'm not 100% sure whether I was intentionally fucked or not, but I lean towards believing I wasn't.  The letter and the conversations I had with him after boot seemed pretty genuine and he seemed legitimately torn up about it, but in the end it didn't really matter since the MGIB was increased so much before I got out that, by the time I did, the MCCF (which plussed-up the MGIB to $30k) wouldn't have made much, if any, real difference in my VA education benefits."

So I get up and immediately walk into the recruiters office and start talking loud enough about the party that the Senior Enlisted can hear me so the SSgt takes me in the back and is nice enough to offer me PFC and free Dress Blues if I keep my mouth shut!    I also was able to get credit for all the recruit activities they do that get you out of school work without having to actually do anything.

USMC,3d1seb,kilo31,19,Sun Jul 12 20:46:20 2015 UTC,Every billet in the Army is basically one rank up from its Marine equivalent. Makes for some weird inter-service conversations.  I had an Army Staff Sergeant medic tell me that they didn't issue morphine to anyone under the rank of Sergeant because they couldn't trust them. When he told me that I was a newly promoted HM3 carrying enough morphine to put down a horse.
USMC,3d1seb,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,5,Mon Jul 13 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"I overheard a Marine sgt and a retired Air Force tech sgt having this conversation before and the sgt's reasoning for the lower rank trust is because of Marines having fewer people, they need someone to fill in the billet so they make due with the ranks they have available. It was something along those lines.  And I'd guess it's the same with the greenside docs"

When I was a Lance I would have told a Specialist to pound sand with his extra pay and free promotion. I don't even understand how they begin to think a Petty Officer is their equivalent.

USMC,3d187q,TheRealSamBell,97,Sun Jul 12 18:01:44 2015 UTC,"I'll disagree that you can't tell alot about the photo. The uniform tells a great deal. I'm a Army pilot but I have a love affair with the Marines in France during WWII. It was my main focus in College as a history major.   For starters this picture was most likely taken stateside and is pre-June of 1917. I believe your Great Grandfather was a Pre-WWI Marine, a true ""Sea Marine""  Here is why I think that. Campaign hat, was not issued to new Marines going to France. On the Sea Marines that came from the battleships to forum the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments were issued Campaign hats. New Marines got British or French pattern overseas caps  Second is the uniform itself, it's a P1912 USMC Forrest Green uniform. You can tell by the pleats in the collar and the sleeve cuff. These are EXCEPTIONALLY rare uniforms.   lastly the leggings are canvass not the common wool puttee leg wraps that were common in the trenches.    The Marine Brigade in France was attached to the 2nd Infantry Division (US Army) and was under overall command of Gen Pershing as he was the commander of the American Expeditionary Force. The Marines came to France in their distinctive uniforms but when they wore out, and they quickly did, they were replaced with Army uniforms. Later in 1917 Marines in France were largely indistinguishable from their Army counterparts."

The boots also lead me to believe this was early 1917 or before. In France when the Boondockers wore out they were issued the M1917 trench boot or a similar British or French pattern.

There are 3 levels of competency, which are determined by your score. Marksman (lowest), Sharpshooter (middle), and Expert (highest). When I was in the perfect score was a possible 250 points, expert was getting at least 220 or more. I think 180 was the lowest you could score and still pass (Marksman)."

Interestingly, marksmanship badges started in 1912 and were briefly replaced by Army-design badges in 1924. Also, for several decades the Corps authorized weapons qualification badges on weapons like howitzers and machine guns. I'm glad that's gone, personally.   You can't tell much about your grandfather from his uniform, but that's the way the Marine Corps likes it. Unlike the Army and the other services, we don't festoon our uniforms with a bunch of special shit. Until the 1980s, we didn't even wear name tapes -- it was sufficient to wear the uniform of a United States Marine. That tradition still lives on today, since Marines don't wear branch insignia or lots of patches.  What is certain is that the Marine Corps in 1918 had emerged as a premier fighting unit. Previously we had a quieter role in American military matters -- we fought a bunch of backwater wars in the Carribean and Asia, but Americans didn't pay much attention. World War I was the first time Marines were used en masse as conventional forces for a major conflict. We performed admirably -- some of the greatest Marine Corps lore comes from places like Belleau Wood (""retreat, hell!"") and the American people did not forget. So your great grandfather was part of that legacy, as are we all, and I'm damn proud to wear the same uniform (with a few minor tweaks) as he did."

One post I was at was Cinderella liberty, the bar was closed, and drinking was limited to one drink at an Embassy members residence.  That was due to the previous 2-3 dets basically being relieved for drinking.  That went away after 6 months and then we were normal liberty.  You can realistically save a ton if you go to high COLA posts.  However, it will largely depend on your lifestyle.  I saved almost nothing for most of the time and then when I got selected for MECEP I saved 10k in four months.  Another friend of mine bought a Corvette with cash.  Most of my buddies got out after.

It needs to be signed by the CG of 4thMarDiv. I had mine signed by my CO and found out 2 days before my shipdate thay I wasnt going to be leaving.   You will also need 2 other forms: An ""acceptance letter"" from the other branch. Just some bullshit your recruiter can type up. The other thing you will need is a ""request for conditional release"" it might be called a ""request for interservice transfer"" can't remember. It's basically the Marine Corps' version of a 368 but more in depth. Make sure the dates on everything are all within 30 days. It's probably best to just do it all on the same day if possible. Once you have the 3 forms completed they can be sent to division. Where it should take 2-4 weeks to get back to you. Good luck  Edit: dd form 368 = conditional release. Which you will receive from your recruiter"

It is hard in the digital age to do anything too crazy when everybody going to boot can just google the Recruit Training Order and know every little rule a DI is bound by.   Combine that with them being raised to not accept personal responsibility for their own mistakes, which it seems most kids these days are, and the atmosphere of officers telling recruits to report any infraction to them and you get a shit show where hats are afraid of recruits in a lot of cases.    My friend got in trouble as a senior for casually telling a kid he would punch him in his mouth.   Funny thing was it was supposedly said in front of the whole platoon and when the rest of the platoon told the series commander the kid was lying because he was a sick call commando and didn't want to train, they accused my friend of encouraging his recruits to lie for him.    I will say some companies, the ones where the leadership is concerned with recruits being trained and not just their own asses, where a company commander will stand up to a bc and stand up for his hats when they don't actually do anything wrong, still train recruits hard."

It's ridiculous to expect morale and troop welfare to be high when you impose heavy handed restrictions on 18-22 year olds (mostly) away from home for the first time.

All the things you mentioned, with the exception of hands in pockets, bring discredit on the Marine Corps and cast the organization in a bad light or is a legitimate crime. Does a guy drinking a beer at a baseball game do that?  Like I said, we're totally in agreement that the captain was in the right and this guy fucked up. With that being said, leadership doesn't always mean enforcing stuff by the book.  In the end, I'm just saying that the Marine Corps seriously needs to look at how it contradicts and creates more problems for itself. We rank lowest in retention rates. Consistently. We are losing GOOD Marines because they spend their first 4 years getting messed with and treated like they're children. We need to find the middle ground."

USMC,3cu82b,__Titans__,3,Sat Jul 11 02:29:20 2015 UTC,What was your MOS or unit that allowed you to check in wearing cammies?

Not only is ""every Marine a rifleman"", but every Marine should dress like a rifleman for some crazy fucking reason.

I don't remember ever wearing them for inspection. We always wore blue deltas or service chucks since Hawaii is hot as fuck. I remember seeing our officers wearing them a few times a year but I don't know why. I wore my blue deltas a couple of times on leave because Tennessee is also hot as fuck. I wore my blues twice, once for the only ball I was ever not deployed for and once for the pre-ball inspection. 3 vs 2 in favor of service alphas."

The liars in bars telling you about how they ""killed 14 people with a machine gun during a convoy"" heard some other douche bag vet tell a similar story and heard all the oohs and aahs he got. Don't get me wrong you can wear whatever you want and lie to whoever you want to if that's what you need to do to define yourself but getting mad at another guy for doing the same thing seems a little hypocritical.

Big theater with big comfy seats, tons of good food, library, computer lab, books, and some other stuff.  Also, I was with my wife and kids, and they had a (mostly soundproof) room with toys and games for the kids.    One thing to remember though:  The reason it's so good is because it's where recruits for the Coast Guard's boot camp fly into, and they wait there while they wait for their instructors to pick them up.  We happened to be there that day for their receiving.  Otherwise, they wouldn't have had the awesome food.  Everything else still stands, though.    Edit:  Someone else mentioned it.

First you start at AMAT I was there for 3 months before I picked up BEC. BEC is about 2 months long and is not too hard but you will have study. If you are number one in the class overall you get to pick your MOS. Then you move up the hill to once again wait to pick up class in BC. Thats usually a lot shorter I was there for 2 weeks but thats only for 28xx, if you are a 59xx BC could be around 6 months in.  If you are a 41, GRRC is a piece of cake if you pass NIDA.

USMC,3cko11,MoistBacon,3,Thu Jul 9 06:34:42 2015 UTC,"I also did basically shit over there, but particularly with PTSD, it's important to remember that just because someone ""saw less action"" doesn't mean that they didn't experience something traumatic.    We all love to joke about tumblrinas claiming they have PTSD because someone looked at them all rapey-like, but the fact of the matter is that the existing of greater suffering doesn't negate your own suffering.  Was I kicking down doors?  No, I was a data dink.  I  left camp twice - once to go check out a suspicious package out near the wire and I was on guard duty that month, and then once when I left for good.  However, I was gettin' mortared 2-3 times a day for 6 months straight.  The VA didn't diagnose me with PTSD, but it was a close thing.  I officially had ""accute adjustment disorder""  sorry, rambling a bit, but the point I'm gettin' at is that you don't have to lose limbs, be in an IED, see people exploding in pink mist to have PTSD.  Locking yourself in the bedroom because a robber entered your house but never came upstairs can be traumatic for some people.    Some wounds are invisible, and unless you're the therapist/doctor treating them, you don't get to say that their PTSD isn't valid, just beacuse you think you saw some ""better shit"""

USMC,3ckj6s,boadcow,6,Thu Jul 9 14:26:07 2015 UTC,It's been pretty good so far. Most of it was spent in the school house but now that I'm with my unit it's much better. I like it.   As for the scribe things I totally get it. I embrace all of the ramifications of doing boot things by learning from it and not doing it again.
USMC,3ckj6s,PenguinNinja007,2,Wed Jul 8 18:04:47 2015 UTC,"Nice, dude, glad to hear it. The fleet is much better than the schoolhouse, so if you already like it then you'll probably have a pretty good time for the rest of your time in.  And yeah, that's why boots get ripped on. Being made to feel dumb or silly in front of people is a good way to learn to not make the same mistake twice. You'll start to notice that boots go out in town or back home on leave and act so stupid it it look like they're trying to act stupid, and it makes Marines look bad. Us seniors and NCOs/SNCOs are just doing our part to fix the problem from within and preserve our image in society's eyes haha someday it'll be your turn to do the same"

USMC,3cn6ml,earthwormjim91,2,Thu Jul 9 05:37:22 2015 UTC,"I was a student in the reserves. For the most part, my unit was pretty accommodating as long as you gave a heads up to your NCO's about any issues. However dont expect a monday test to get you out of RIDT (essentially making up a drill at a later date). For AT's and drills you made the commitment.   G.I. bill is paltry unless you have some Active duty time (I went on deployments), but the small amount helps.   Honestly, If I could go back I would have just gone active and gotten the full military experience. I enlisted in 06 however so my ""reserve"" time was broken up with deployments, active orders, AT's, PME's etc. I didnt really get a chance to focus on college until I was out anyway. With the wars pretty much over that may be completley different as the reserves tempo will be cut back alot."

USMC,3cn6ml,Jimmyfinder,4,Thu Jul 9 07:22:09 2015 UTC,"I got out in 2012 so it may be a little different now, but I doubt by much.   I was able to use TA to take one class a semester. It met once a week for 3 hours.  I only earned 9 credits doing this, but it helped me jump start some grades and get 3 easy classes out of the way. I made sure they were transferable classes and not a remedial style class.   With that being said, once I got everything signed up and had to leave at 5pm on Monday for class, my SNCO lost his fucking mind. Mind you, this was waiting for night crew to show up so we were bullshitting around waiting for passdown.   After that, they labeled me a shitbag ""college boy"" that didn't care about the mission. We were a shop of 42 flyers, I was qualified, and requested to not fly nights on Monday. You would've thought the fucking Taliban was attacking with how my SNCO reacted.   So I got the shit duties and shit working parties as a corporal.   It sucked at the time but I knew in the long run I would make out. Well I did - I graduated in May and I'm working doing what I love.

I've never been good at peeing when other people are around also so I either had to regulate how much water I drank and just pray we were allowed a headcall before I pissed myself or I would haul ass whenever we got done with chow (you'd usually get time to piss after chow) and try to grab one of the stalls and start peeing before someone else showed up and tried to share the same toilet as me.

You will just have to drink water until you pee. My drill instructor realized this was a problem for me and took me aside and said "" I want you to try to pee sitting down"" I tried it and it worked.

USMC,3cmfqf,honkeekong,3,Thu Jul 9 07:28:22 2015 UTC,You not being able to piss won't hold others back. Starting now until you leave when you are peeing anywhere do something like count or do a math problem or say a specific phrase over and over. That way when you are at boot camp and have to take the drug test you can 1. Have something to take your mind off peeing and 2.

The way you remember how to put it back in, is: you hold it like a gun, top higher portion is in first, and the lower portion in last, like a small rifle most people hold it in the crook of where it joins each piece with there forefinger.  Disclaimer: it's been 8 years, please forgive any mistakes I made from memory.

I just had found out my mother had been diagnosed with cancer so the restraint needed to not murder him was high. I explained this to him and he didn't care as my room had a dusty book shelf from the books I had read the previous night on field day.  So I drove back and he eventually made me clean my room on Saturday and get inspected by him self. I was about to deploy as well so I went to visit my family and I told him that but his reply was well then you should've dusted off your books devil dog. I look back and only laugh now as my moms completely fine and he made of a fool of him self.

We insist that we are out-competing them because we think it's the Army infantry.  That used to be the case...but today, we compete against someone else.

Some guys do it themselves however they have the mystical power of giving good barracks cuts.  Edit: zero all the way up the side with no fade then do what you want with the top. I normally get a 3 or 4 on top during the summer but I have a medium fade because high and tight doesn't look good on me. So people just dont have a good head shape for it.

I'm looking all sorts of nasty in my civvies:  Button down shirt, unbuttoned and not tucked in, and my undershirt isn't tucked in either.  And I didn't think about the fact that there were SCNO's and their wives that had also shown up for chow.    It only takes a few seconds before I'm being corrected by one of the SNCOs.  So I immediately snap to attention and start shoving my shirt into my jeans, but didn't really look too closely at his rank.  All I saw was a couple of rockers and crossed-rifles, so everything out my mouth was, ""Yes gunnery sgt"" or ""No gunnery sgt"".  He simply responded with, ""I'm not a gunny...""

After he left I literally talked to no one outside of work and hid in my room. I tried going to play beer pong at the barracks during the weekends with the other people out there, but I didn't trust them.

USMC,3c9mm3,therippinandtearing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:54:11 2015 UTC,"Seems legit, I'm always worried about private, for-profits schools but this is a non-profit.  The real question to ask yourself is what you plan to put these credits towards.  If you ultimately plan on transferring somewhere, I highly recommend you at least get an Associate's degree (~64 credits).  With an Associate's degree, the school you are transferring into has to take at least 64 credits worth of your work towards your Bachelors (~120 credits)  If you don't have that Associate's, the school has leverage over how many credits they want to accept.  You could end up having over 64 credits from National, but without that Associate's, your future school can control how many they want to accept.  I did a ton of MCIs, CLEPS, and courses from Central Texas College that only manifested into about 16 credits from military experience, then I went to community college when I got out and eventually graduated from my dream school.  Think the long term plan and good luck with school."
USMC,3c9mm3,boadcow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:42:03 2015 UTC,"In general, I try and steer people away from for-profit schools.  They are good for check-in-the-box degrees, that's about it.  For instance, if you are after a commision, or if you are at a job and an associates degree, any associates degree, will get you some promotion.  Otherwise, if you plan to try and sell yourself with this degree on your resume, you might have a bad time."

USMC,3c6802,Gak_Attack,3,Sun Jul 5 05:33:37 2015 UTC,Were you placed on light or limited duty following your hospitalization? When were you hospitalized?
USMC,3c6802,lowspeedlowdrag,2,Sun Jul 5 05:42:53 2015 UTC,I got a light duty chit. It was in April and I was released for light PT at first but I feel it's coming back. The docs at the hospital said I had up to a year for full recovery because it was acute pneumonia. They had to put a hose into my back and into my lung.
USMC,3c6802,lowspeedlowdrag,4,Sun Jul 5 05:53:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, so there's a short answer and a long answer.   Short answer: When did your light duty expire? You're responsible for running a PFT no less than 30 but no more than 90 days following your return to full duty. MCO 6100.13 doesnt recognize such a thing as an ""Inventory PFT"", so therefore there is no form to fill out that will magic your inventory PFT into a PFT.   Long answer: Sounds like you were pretty fucked up, and should have been placed on Limited Duty so that a Medical/Physical Evaluation Board could adjudicate your actual prognosis and exempt you from a PFT/CFT if needed. The docs at your hospital need to talk to the docs at your unit who need to talk to your command to ensure you're taken care of. That said, if you were my Marine and well enough to work on a dusty construction site all night but somehow not well enough to run 3 miles I might demand that you do some explaining."
USMC,3c6802,earthwormjim91,2,Sun Jul 5 06:06:43 2015 UTC,I knew I should have googled the full order for the no less than 30 day thing. I had a hernia surgery and they made me run one for score a couple years ago the day I came off of light duty. They said only full limdu had the 30 day rule.

Plus with our inventory CFT's coming up I am concerned with how I should train.  Also I lost about 20 pounds while in the hospital so I was feeling pretty weak when I got released for light PT"
USMC,3c6802,lowspeedlowdrag,3,Sun Jul 5 06:18:29 2015 UTC,"Go back to the doctor. Take a light duty chit with you, and tell him about the events of the PFT and CFT.

USMC,3c6802,JeSuisFoxyTrot,2,Sun Jul 5 06:23:24 2015 UTC,I found the order and for what I understand I can run at least a partial PFT if approved which should be no problem at all. I'll keep reviewing it and see a doc this Tuesday.

USMC,3c4xc6,BowlingCommando,42,Sat Jul 4 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"I earned a phone call home for shooting high on the range.  I didn't want to do it because I knew me leaving for boot camp was putting a lot of stress on my parents. That really tore me up so putting that out of sight and mind was just what I did.  Calling them wrecked me. I was in the duty hut with the senior too. He was cool about it, told me to compose myself and not look like a ""bitchass nigga"" before I left the hut."

Some don't. You won't know for absolute certain until it actually happens.   Whether or not you cry is not important. What's important is your actions afterwards. If you can break down, then compose yourself and move forward with purpose, you'll do just fine. If you stay broken in a pile of sniffles and woe-is-me's, you (and your Drill Instructors) have a rough road to make you into a Marine."

I was on the range and I was picking up brass, so I crammed some in my cargo pocket. When we were doing the no trash or brass bullshit I got all but one out and my drill instructor found it and said oh you're FUCKED now! Getting dropped fucking sucks, by the way, so I cried. It's a huge mind fuck because that's when the drill instructors can control time.  He's on my facebook and I talked to him about it and he was cool about it. He said almost everyone cries once, I was just the unlucky one that cried in the middle of the day."

Trucks all day drove past our shit. We just accepted it, as they had attacked us with VBIED's before.  We (my Fireteam) went out back, played spades and ate Easy-Cheese in the back of a 7-Ton awaiting our fate. There was a calm, cool feeling that flowed over us. Fuck it. Can't stop it, let's get this shit over with.  It never came, obviously, and we continued on with our jobs until the tour was over. That aspect of accepting our supposed death was a big relief, and I believe led us to better fulfill our mission for the rest of the deployment.  This would happen a few more times, and each time, it was that much easier accepting our ""fate"". We had believed that we were already dead."

USMC,3bzzco,ReVo5000,2,Fri Jul 3 19:24:07 2015 UTC,It works ok. Our woodlands and deserts work fantastically in their perspective environments. The coyote color works well enough in desert and ok in summer foliage but could be better with a broken pattern.

At the end of the drill they were doing they all crack their rifles on the ground in unison while screaming ""U-S-M-C"" and they focused that shot on the dude from my unit.  We thought it was fucking hilarious, so we had this guy sneak up on the dude from the movie and get right by him, and he screamed ""USMC!!""   It was so goddamn funny we made him to it to everyone."

Your asvab will likely be high so you could qualify for almost any available field of work. Do a 5 year gig in the air wing doing avionics or something. Take advantage of tuition assistance to work towards a advanced degree in your off time, then you will still have the gi bill when you get out.

In the past, it felt like every time I went to the VA for treatment, they labeled me a alcoholic or addict for drinking once a week or smoking some pot to go to bed at night. I have become closed minded to the VA because I feel their objective is to get me in and have me leave with a bag, full of new 'better' pills that will help in solving my issues. Half of the pills they give me to take, have side effects that I take additional pills to counteract... I feel like a governmental chemistry experiment.  The best treatment that I have received was during my freshman year in college. I turned to the psychology department for help because I was having nightmares, survivors guilt... the usual bull shit that comes with your first year out. The school paired me up with a doctoral student who gave me the best treatment that I have ever received. She meet with me for an hour a week, sometime two depending on what was going on in my life and the severity of my issues, and listened to my problems and help guide me through them. No more, no less. I don't know if it was the connection that I felt with her or what, but I left her office every week feeling a little better then when I got there. She grounded me and still after 10 years in the VA system, I have yet to find that same feeling. Might look her up and see if she is practicing close.   In regards to your suggestion, I wish I could. I am trying to educate my girl on this because like stated before, I have used alcohol to suppress my symptoms. So for the past five years, my girl has never experience a flashback like last night.

You can use its ""power"" for good for you and your family.  I basically reached a point where I realized it wasn't going to go away, so just expect it to come on, identify if it is a real threat or not (the shitty part) and then keep an ear to the situation if it does escalate while you don't freak anyone out around you.  I know how hard it is to condition yourself out of this, so I'm not saying it's easy.  The 4th was terrible for me the first few years after I got back.  Unbearable.  But I just learned to desensitize it to adapt and overcome.  You can do it.  The second part is deal with the root of the problem.  You came back physically and you have to figure out how to come back mentally.  No one can tell you how to come back and many never do.  I can tell you how I did, but everyone is different.  The truth is, even though cliche, find inner peace and rack it home in your head that every day you spend feeling sorry about what happened over there is a day wasted not living your life the way our fallen brothers would have wanted us to live.  We don't honor their memory in any way by not moving on with our own lives.  I spent 12 months straight in '05 in Hit/Hadithah/Ramadi/Fallujah.  My experience wasn't easy but everyone's brain processes this shit differently.  I really wish there was something I could tell all struggling vets to 'snap them out of it', but there isn't.

I hear of STI in pistol, rifles, and the like more than I've heard anything about Beretta in recent times.  The M9 is a piece of shit, everyone knows it, everyone wanted the 1911 to be brought back.  I had Veterans from Iwo Jima tell me first hand you want a 1911 .45.  I love Bearing Arms a whole ton, I read a shit ton of their articles, but they are openly swayed to play favorites all the time in their articles, and you can tell by the way they're written when they are masturbating all over a product from a company who hooked up the author.  If they publish it here, they think you'll all start buzz about this or that, and it will go up the chain, ""this is what the boys want, they keep talking about it!"", when in reality, we want what we've always had.

In fact the last I heard, glock was still high in consideration, far above...Beretta.  Ugh.  Who did they pay off to get that first Beretta contract to begin with?  How do you say a new pistol, with little to no experience or usage by any agency or military in the entire world, is the top contender.  What a joke.  To compare a new Beretta pistol, to a Sig Sauer P320, which is just a P250 revamped, which both have been tested and proved, in the field, in combat, and STI, which makes high grade competition pistols, especially the 1911, which has been proved plenty in the field, to a brand new pistol, we just thought up, and took off the assembly line, which looks just like a clone of 10 other handguns out there, and it's a ""top contender"" to get a contract as big as ours.  You should all really question this.  The article.  The staff involved with choosing these contenders.  Everyone and everything involved.  This is seriously the future of other Marines lives if these pistols are shit or not, and everyone is like, ooo, look at the shiny new...piece of shit.

Either not a Marine, or a Marine who doesn't care about the well-being of other Marines to suggest a new pistol that isn't battle hardened should be a top contender, that all Marines should place their lives with.  Fuck off."
USMC,3bxyp0,Ago_Solvo,10,Fri Jul 3 03:24:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree that something needs to be ""Battle Hardened"". What does that mean? I carried an M14 DMR in the age of modern weapons that are lighter and more accurate. I am a nostalgic historian and loved my M14, but knew that better weapons existed for the role. When I was issued an M9, I immediately recognized that it wasn't as good as the G19 I owned myself. Two years later I turned it in after a locking block replacement, the blueing worn off the barrel, scratches everywhere and a faulty safety. Battle hardened? The M9 is... so what? Let's get a newer better pistol. Battle Hardened? The M14 certainly is. However, it isn't nearly as good as some of the newer AR-10 variants out there.   A 1911? I'm tired of this argument. There exist so many newer designs that are superior. Get us a better handgun. Most don't care who supplies it. A better grip that fits more hands, a more resiliant coating to resist wear and rusting or oxidation if it's made of steel or a similar metal, a better safety, high capacity, etc.   You say the 1911 has been proven in the field, you're absolutely right. It has been. So was the M1 Garand. But we now have better calibers of cartidges and we now have better rifles. If, after 104 years the best we can do is a rehashed single stack 1911 than I fear for the ability of the military to innovate appropriately.  Feel free to downvote me since this obviously doesn't align with your thoughts."

I was the senior line corpsman and was cool with the company Gunny so I usually got roped into his projects.   Amos was on deck, Gunny had to go unfuck something with RCT, so we walked over there. Amos and his entourage come around the corner and the handshake line starts. I had just walked like a mile and a half and was sweating balls. I gave the Commandant of the Marine Corps a slimy dead fish handshake, he looked at me like I had a dick growing out of my forehead and said ""What the fuck were you doing, Doc?"" and walked away disgusted.

We drove up to our spot during the day for ops, and came back down in the evening for chow and sleep, leaving two Marines up there for gear watch. Now for some reason one morning, one Marine on the mountain got picked up and brought down, leaving Doc alone on the mountain. He decided it was a great time to use his camelback shower thing. He strips down and starts showering, in the open air, alone atop a mountain. About this time a blackhawk came flying by at exactly mountaintop level, and circled around a few times staring at this naked pasty white guy showering on a Thai mountaintop.  TL;DR the army is gay"

USMC,3brxj8,Ff3j,3,Wed Jul 1 17:38:26 2015 UTC,"At least you have a copy of your medical records, that's a great start!  If you have your DD-214, you should look up the nearest VA hospital online and look for their services page.   You'll need to do an initial rating, find a number and call to make an appointment. It may take around a year from start to finish until you get your first check.   But better late than never, you earned it!"
USMC,3brxj8,boadcow,2,Wed Jul 1 18:13:04 2015 UTC,"It's going to be a long (did I say long? I meant very long!) up hill battle from here since you've waited so long. If you have a copy of your medical record which you said you do then you should just be able to take that to your local VA office and they should be able to help you out! You must make sure however, that anything you are trying to claim is documented in your medical / dental record otherwise they will claim that it isn't a ""service connected disability"" and they might not help you.   I just got out this year so hopefully this helps!  If all else fails you can always contact your congressman haha."

USMC,3bo3yg,UsmcFatManBear,39,Tue Jun 30 19:54:59 2015 UTC,"At least he has acknowledged that a lot of Lances are, in fact, shitbags. If you aren't in an MOS that has an absurdly high cutting score (like 03XX), you really don't have an excuse for not at least picking up Corporal.  Always love when I see fellow 065X's getting out as terminal lances and trying to sympathize with grunts. No dude, they're terminal lances because their MOS sucks for promotions. You're a terminal lance because you're a terd."
USMC,3bo3yg,Sgt_Slate,20,Tue Jun 30 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"As an 03XX myself, I picked up Corporal 2 1/2 months before terminal, and was mailed a Sergeant's promotion 1 year and 1 month later while on IRR...I have no idea how they calculated it, never even did the MCIs."
USMC,3bo3yg,hijack619,14,Tue Jun 30 20:51:53 2015 UTC,YAY! I picked up Cpl 2 months after the merger of your shitty ass MOS 0651 and the original combat keyboard of 0656.
USMC,3bo3yg,FD9WCB8,13,Tue Jun 30 19:57:52 2015 UTC,"Slow your roll devil. I was an 0656 too. Not my fault the Corps still can't figure out how to create a well organized set of IT MOSs.   By the time I got out it made fuck all difference what you were taught in school. You better know servers, networking, crypto, satcom, and point to point comms or you suck at life."
USMC,3bo3yg,Sgt_Slate,6,Tue Jun 30 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"Im just messing with you. Although, some 0651s had no related experiences setting up and managing networks like you get from getting deployed.  Glad I wasn't a complete fuckup. Finished degree while I was in before TA was an issue, got my cnna, sec+, and mcse.  I wanted to stay in but I couldn't get my monitor to sign off to guarantee me a spot in CWO school...."

USMC,3bo3yg,Sgt_Slate,2,Wed Jul 1 13:51:52 2015 UTC,I was in from '06-'11 so when I went in they still had them separated and I remember learning basically only levels 1-3 networking as a 56 and hearing that the 51s learned Exchange and that's about it.  When my unit sent me to the CCNA class I finally got a relatively firm grasp on networking and it made me realize just how much of a fucking joke that MOS school was.

USMC,3bo3yg,MoistBacon,0,Wed Jul 1 03:12:34 2015 UTC,I call bullshit. I always had max points on almost everything and it took me 4 years to make Sergeant.

USMC,3bo3yg,MoistBacon,2,Wed Jul 1 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"08-12. Picked up Cpl in Afghanistan around Feb 2010. Picked up Sgt on a MEU around Jan 2012. Cutting scores weren't that high, but they weren't laughably low either."
USMC,3bo3yg,Sgt_Slate,2,Wed Jul 1 10:18:35 2015 UTC,They were pretty low compared to the rest of comm the last two years I was in. My shop had a boner for Data so they always got really good pro/cons too so that helped.
USMC,3bo3yg,MoistBacon,2,Wed Jul 1 10:30:42 2015 UTC,"Data is a big reason why the S-6 shop looks good if they know what they're doing. The CO likes radios and all, but being able to send secure emails and have his COC hooked up to mIRC  is far more important to him.  Victor units, especially infantry battalions, rely far more heavily on their data shop than anyone is willing to admit."

But I would never for a second attempt to compare my lancehood to those that have MOS's that will never allow them to advance beyond E-3. Picking up as a 51 is a joke, I'll pick up cpl for a 2nd time as I EAS."
USMC,3bo3yg,old_wooden_ship,2,Wed Jul 1 05:21:28 2015 UTC,"Picking up Cpl as a 065X is pretty easy as long as you're not a terd. Sgt is a bit harder.  The reason our cutting score is low is because you can take the skills you learn and make twice the salary with none of the bullshit on the outside. Guys get out a shitton more often, opening up more spots for promotion to NCO."
USMC,3bo3yg,Sgt_Slate,3,Wed Jul 1 10:16:38 2015 UTC,"I can attest to this.  I was an 0656 (well, until they merged) and I told the career counselor to not even bother with the reenlistment spiel.  I mean what's the point when you work next to contractors doing the same job making 3-4 times as much money and not having to put up with the day to day bullshit in the Marine Corps?"
USMC,3bo3yg,NinjaJehu,2,Wed Jul 1 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"6842 terminal lance here. My MOS was closed out for a year and a half, and when it finally opened up the score was in the 1800's to pick up corporal because everyone's scores had been slowly rising due to time in grade/time in service. So it didn't matter how good you were at shit, you weren't passing someone who has been in a year longer than you."

It's a long road on the path to recovery for PTSD... It's tough to talk about and most guys that were never in combat just don't get it. It helped me to find a group that went through similar experiences. He needs to get those toxic thoughts out before they eat him from the inside.

Background:  Marine Barracks Rota, Spain (1992) at zero-dark thirty. I was on duty at a building with two posts, inside and outside. Stupid me convinced the outside Marine (we had post-to-post phones) to switch for 10 minutes because I wanted a cigarette. We got caught.  Summary:  We were both relieved of our post and confined to a conference room in our Admin building. At 0700 we were standing tall before the CO, the XO, the 1st Sgt, the Admin SSgt and an Admin Corporal taking notes. The last words out of the Co's mouth, to me, was ""I'm going to give you the Brig, son."". I was crushed. So much that I just turned around and walked back to the conference room like a zombie breaking all military bearing.  Conclusion:  The CO actually said ""I'm going to give you a break, son."". I spent the next month confined to the base, cleaning all the weapons in our armory and raking a lot of dirt. No loss of pay, rank, etc. The other guy was already on probation and it was extended."

I inform him and he decides to tag along.   We pop into the next room down the row and this kid immediately stands stiff as fuck in front of his fridge. I go check and hes got a 30 rack in there. I feel like the biggest dick bag now because the OOD is with me and see that this underage boot has waaay to much alcohol for his own good.   Im thinkin im gonna have to log this shit in and call 1stSgt and hes gonna get NJPed and and become a disgruntled shit bag forever all because i was bored and wanted to fuck with people.

He looked at the boot, then back at me and said, ""its your show Cpl Booziwan"" and walked out of the room. (This is the exciting moment.) I was so happy and relieved.

I was touring the catwalks when I heard the distinct sound of duct tape being stretched. FML. I basically sprinted around the corner, and the second dumbest motherfucker in our company is taping a Pentagram onto a new drop's door. He's already smeared a pizza onto the window and door, and pissed on the door knob.  I told him I was going to take another walk around the building, and if it wasn't clean by the time I got back, I'd walk him to the battalion office myself. How well do you think you'll fare, especially only 19 years old and so drunk you can barely walk? He looks at me and goes ""But sergeant, they're boots!!!"" The total shock and indignation in his dumb drunk voice about made me lose it. I told him five minutes and walked off. The catwalk was clean when I came back. Dumb fucking s hit.

You start to see that you can actually eat a lot in a day if its all healthy since it is low in calories.   I will have one big meal in the morning for breakfast and have snacks every two hours for the rest of the day and have a decent dinner before 8pm.  At first you are hungry but you get used to the diet and it basically becomes second nature to not stuff your face. My cheat days are on the weekends.

I was tired all the time and I would get overly pissed over minor shit (like when some asshole would take up the one fucking squat rack to do his round the gym circuit course).  I finally had to step back and just adjust.  Now I just go when the wife gets home and that is working much better for me.

That's fucking insane and a one way ticket to a miserable old age. Look at some of the retired Marines in the commisaries.

For me, I love good beer for the taste, not to get drunk (that's what the cheap shit is for).  While I was in, I kept drinking and shitty food for the weekend.  Once I was out, it started with a dinner beer (275 kcal), then a lunch beer (550 kcal), then one during Game of Thrones (825 kcal), etc.  Normally, I sit right around 1800-2000 kcal per day but you throw on 800+ calories per day and it adds up.    Then that five guys burger you'd much down on with your boys like once every couple months? Yeah, that's now once every few weeks because, fuck it, I don't have tape.  I'll just hit it harder in the gym anyway.  Holy shit they got a chipotle?!  I know what I'm getting for lunch tomorrow!  You are getting it in your gym then, well you're out and it's time to move.  Fuck, I don't like the Planet Fitness/LA Fitness/Gold's here, I'll just take some time off and shop around.  Oh man, maybe I'll just build a home gym, gotta save up though, iron isn't cheap.  I'll just keep running!  Oh shit, Ohio is way colder than K-Bay.  I guess I can use that piece of shit elliptical my parents have in the basement...  I don't think anyone, especially Marines, decide they want to get fat.  It's just a series of small lapses in judgement that eventually lead up to a huge fucking mistake.  I got out and between my son being born two days later and starting school, I was so fucked up that the gym wasn't even on a list.  I guess it just took me realizing where I was and hating the body I was in to get back in.  Plus I fucking love seeing big numbers on my spreadsheets."

The best way to do it is find an activity you have fun doing and enjoy. If you are forcing yourself to workout for the sake of working out, that isn't sustainable. When all you do is ""gotta do x more miles"" or ""have to do x # of sets today"" its very easy to say fuck it on a day you already got up early and had a full workday. Do something fun for exercise and you actually look forward to doing it as a stress release, instead of thinking goddamit I have to work out today.  Try a martial arts gym, some Bjj, MMA, muay Thai, krav, etc. I train 5 days a wk and I'm in your boat, work full-time + full credit load. Martial arts training has lots of qualities that I think appeal to Marines: dedication to discipline and self improvement, toughness, never giving in to pain/exhaustion, humility, venting aggression, camaraderie with the people you train with. No matter how tired or pissed I am at the end of a workday I look forward to the gym as a release."

What I will offer is this advice; shit your brains out.  Seriously max out your fiber intake: bars, cereals, prunes, salads, broccoli, whole wheat pasta, anything and everything that has that sweet sweet fiber.  I wouldn't recommend powders or pills, I've heard of that going bad in excess, but food rich with fiber will help you to literally crap all the junk out.  Also, consider a permanent diet with limitations you can bear.  I became  pescatarian, but there's no carb, vegetarian, palio, etc.  Try mixing it up."

You recognized that you should lose weight, and that is one of the harder parts.   Second, what the top post said. Little changes can have a huge impact. Banging out pushups, air squats, and pull ups won't necessarily make you look like hugh jackman, but it WILL help! Especially when paired with...  Third, your diet! Diet is HUGE! Download an app like myfitnesspal, buy a digital scale for like twenty bucks, and log EVERYTHING. hell, after a week, you will more than likely see that your diet is straight garbage. I know, because I have done big cuts twice. I am still on my second one, down to 189 from 215. I am still active duty so the schedule interrupts from time to time, but I make it work. It takes a ton of time and an annoying amount of dedication, but if you survived the Corps, I know you've got the discipline to do it.   A huge thing for me, and which is a big struggle for me, is cutting out alcohol entirely. No, you do not have to cut out alcohol entirely to lose weight. I personally do because I am not an alcohol sipper. I abuse it. I have the self control to totally abstain, but not moderate use. Blame it on my upbringing or college or the Corps or whatever, but zero alcohol works for me. A lot less empty calories, no bad drunk diet choices, etc. Most sources will advise little to no alcohol when cutting, but it's on the individual really.  Please PM me if you'd like any advice (I am not a nutritionist or dietician or trainer, I just have done healthy, safe cuts that I can share from MY personal experiences).

When my son was newborn I'd hold him while I was doing bodyweight squats while holding him. Now we do pushups together. When I worked full time and went to school full time I would go on walks and listen to podcasts of lectures, take a 10min break every hour and do some pushups. I'd do lunges when I was at work ad it was slow. You can make the time to work out. When I go to Brazilian jiujitsu class that's working out, but it's fun so I don't mind. I don't go running because I hate it. I don't have time to run, but I do for grappling. Find a workout you actually like. I go swimming too, because I like it. You can make the time.   The main thing is diet. I don't give a fuck what every fatbody with no self control says, eat less junk food and you will lose weight. Cut out the Mt Dews, drink 1-2 beers instead of that 6 pack. Don't eat a meal bigger than your head and then have dessert. Eat some veggies and a steak instead."

Just bake those fuckers, cut em up and brown em a bit in a pan, then add some minute rice, beans whatever you need to make it taste good.

USMC,3behyi,myr4dski1,2,Mon Jun 29 00:42:30 2015 UTC,"Fellow fat-ass vet here.  Counting calories is what is working for me.  I've lost 15 lbs so far.  I use myfitnesspal to track them.  Just keeping track of it is what motivates me to do everything else.  When I eat too much in a day I can actually see myself getting fat, so that motivates to eat less.  If I eat junk food all day then I'm still going to be hungry when I reach my calorie limit.  So that motivates me to eat healthy, along with eating less.  But sometimes I'm still hungry even when I eat healthy.  That motivates me to exercise to ""earn"" more calories to eat, as well as eating healthy, as well as eating less.  I've tried to get into eating right and exercising a bunch of times, but actually keeping track of the calories and having the cold hard facts in front of me at the end of everyday - that's when everything clicked."

Went from jogging 2x a week /lifting 6 days a week to not doing any type of exercise for a couple of months. You don't necessarily have to go to the gym, just eat more healthy with a deficit in calories. If you do go to the gym, look up HIIT and educate yourself on a proper workout regime. Best of luck."
USMC,3behyi,ThrowawayBAMCIS,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:00:45 2015 UTC,"Start out small. Write out on a calendar the days you want to workout. Post the calendar somewhere visible and stick to it. On eating, you can cook clean food in bulk. You don't need to make it complicated. Get in your workouts, and work on eating mostly clean food. As long as you stay consistent you'll make it. Good luck. Dont become another able body fat veteran. Have pride in your appearance. One of the good things you learn from the Marines."

The day of graduation I quickly went over to one of the supply stores.

""For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a Company Gunnery Sergeant during Operation MEADE RIVER in the Republic of Vietnam on the night of 8 December 1968. Informed that the commander of the lead platoon had been mortally wounded when his unit was pinned down by a heavy volume of enemy fire, Staff Sergeant Taylor along with another Marine, crawled forward to the beleaguered unit through a hail of hostile fire, shouted encouragement and instructions to the men, and deployed them to covered positions. With his companion, he then repeatedly maneuvered across an open area to rescue those Marines who were too seriously wounded to move by themselves. Upon learning that there were still other seriously wounded men lying in another open area, in proximity to an enemy machine gun position, Staff Sergeant Taylor, accompanied by four comrades, led his men forward across the fire-swept terrain in an attempt to rescue the Marines. When his group was halted by devastating fire, he directed his companion to return to the company command post; whereupon he took his grenade launcher and, in full view of the enemy, charged across the open rice paddy toward the machine gun position, firing his weapon as he ran. Although wounded several times, he succeeded in reaching the machine gun bunker and silencing the fire from that sector, moments before he was mortally wounded. Directly instrumental in saving the lives of several of his fellow Marines, Staff Sergeant Taylor, by his indomitable courage, inspiring leadership, and selfless dedication, upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service."""

If your job incentive contract did not look like those shown in that Marine Corps Order, you aren't open contract.

You will be a reservist, but I'm sure since you're recon the sky is the limit. If you fail you don't simply become an 03, you become a POG in whatever MOS the cream corn needs you in.

USMC,3bdwil,Semper_OFP,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"That's possible. More likely than not they're going to find you a POG job that you can do and send you to school for that, 4th Recon needs support staff just like every other unit.  The SMCR is a different animal because we sign up for a specific BIC and we are expected to fill it once we complete IADT.   My MOS doesn't even send kids to school once they graduate MCT. They're flown home, they check into their unit and drill as an SMCR Marine pending their school date.   It's possible that's the case with 4th Recon just because from what I understand BRC is backed up with students too and has always been.  When you join the Reserves you should conduct an interview with your unit prior to shipping for boot camp. This would be the time to ask whether or not they stick you in Camp Guard after ITB or if you just drill with your unit until you can get a spot at BRC.  Your chances of survival might increase if you have a bunch of 0321's who can prepare you prior to leaving. If you want to be ricky recon, having it guaranteed isn't a bad gig.

USMC,3baqes,blues_and_ribs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"literally no cons   Not totally accurate.  I've bought 2 houses with it.  You do get charged a certain percentage of the purchase price just for the privilege of using the program.  Around 2 percent of the purchas price the first time, and between 3 and 4 percent for second and subsequent home purchases.  For a 90k house in Jacksonville, not a big deal.  But if you're buying a 500k house near Pendleton or KBay, HI, that's 30k you're paying that you normally wouldn't have to.  Also, there are conditions with what you can buy.  See a condo you like?  Not approved for VA loan.  How about a fixer upper?  Might not get approved.  All that said, it's a great program where the single biggest benefit is not having to provide any money down.  If I was buying another house and had the cash for the down payment, I might consider a non-VA loan."

USMC,3baqes,dafucusay,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"I used them too, they're kind of like a mortgage broker. They'll set up your loan, work out an approximate payment amount with your interest rate then after everything is finalized they'll usually give/sell it to a bank in your area. In my case it was Wells Fargo. The VA backs the loan with the bank that takes your contract, they don't lend directly to you."
USMC,3baqes,ExpatJundi,2,Wed Jul 1 21:26:08 2015 UTC,"You could log into VONAPP and get your Certificate of Eligibility. That will show what you are entitled to with the VA home loan. My mortgage company said you would need a credit score over 620, but I don't know if that's an absolute fact."

USMC,3bdl4f,dirtydeemanx,19,Sun Jun 28 05:22:01 2015 UTC,"As /u/ThatJarhead mentioned, the best place for your questions is /r/USMCboot. With that being said, I figured i'd tackle your questions with some straight up honesty, because it seems like that's what you need.   Hey guys, so I'm 16 and a bad student. I am a hard worker, but when it comes to school, I just don't like to study, blah blah blah etc.   Do you think there is nothing to study in the Marine Corps? Have you not thought that part through? Not only is there 200+ years of history that you need to understand, there is a basic amount of knowledge that you need to have. Combine that with whatever day to day knowledge and book learning you will need for your MOS (whatever you opt for) and you have a lot of studying ahead of you. You dont have to study, but enjoy the suckfest.   not only am I in for the pride and being looked up to, I want to know if it will screw me later on in life.    Screw you how? PTSD is a bitch but there is no way to know what will happen with your career, whether it is 4 or 20 years. What is this being looked up to bullshit?   Mainly, if I join 0311, will that make it hard to find a job?    I work with a SSgt turned Officer who was an 0311. He is now a manager for 40-50 people making a VERY nice paycheck (plus retirement). Its all in what YOU do with YOUR time. When I took the classes before getting out, all of the tracks guys wanted to be cops.   I don't really know what MOS to join, 0311 sounds badass and that's what everybody wants to be, but is being a POG so bad?    Badass is subjective. I dont know if EVERYONE wants to be an 03, I didnt. Is being a POG so bad? No its not. Grunts are going to make fun of you and you are going to make fun of them for being dumb etc, its all part of the culture. We dont run without them and they dont run without us, thats just the way it is.   Like if I'm a plumber for the marines that's gotta be able to help me out with getting a job, right?    Assuming you apply yourself correctly, yes. Military experience CAN translate well into the civilian world. I was an 0651/0656, I know am a team leader making a VERY nice paycheck back home, without a college degree.   So basically, should I join 0311 because to me being looked up to sounds awesome, and it honestly just looks fun. Or should I be a POG, where I could learn a trade and have that help me with a job?   Being looked up to by who? People back home who dont know the difference between infantry and a cook in the Marine Corps? Your fellow infantrymen? The POGs who dont give a fuck about you? No one is looking up to you due to your MOS. People back home will admire and be pround IF you become a Marine, those around you, you will have to earn their respect. Both options will net you a job, both options are dangerous.   ? Like I look up to infantry and it looks fun as shit, but I'm not sure how I would actually react if I got shot or if my buddy got shot or being scared of running over a car bomb.    No one here can tell you that. You might find out one day, you might not. Ill tell you that as a ""POG"" out in Iraq I saw the same shit that you describe here. I was attached to an infantry company, never thought I would be. Dont think because you choose to be infantry that you WILL see shit and that if you choose to be a POG that you WONT.   Are my worries for infantry relevant and is it actually a good expierence being part of infantry?   I cant answer that one. I will tell you my understanding is that it sucks being infantry. In general the Marine Corps was the best choice I made in life and Im glad I did it.  You have at the very least two years to figure these things out, more if you want. There is no need to rush into things. What I would suggest though is the following:   Man the fuck up on the studies. You are bad at studying? Figure it out. Thats what you do in life is learn stuff and the Marine Corps isnt any different. Who is to say that something (preferred deity forbid) happens to you and you cant join? You get in a car wreck, get a disease, just arent fit for it or simply are denied. What then? Get the fuck over ""being looked up to"". No one will look up to you and if you are going for that, you have no place in the Marine Corps. Figure out what you want in life. Doing something because it is ""badass"" is a childish way of looking at the world. Instead think long and hard about what you want to be doing in twenty years. Go from there Exercise now! If you do join, you will be glad you started."

USMC,3b7038,benjammin9292,9,Fri Jun 26 14:35:01 2015 UTC,"I got NJPed twice in my first 2 year in. I still got out with an Honorable Discharge, a good conduct medal, and a good re-entry code on my DD-214 in my 5 year contract. And I got out in 2011, right at the brink of military downsizing. I got my full veterans benefits from my Honorable discharge and everything.  The only thing that was hard was when I tried to reenlist. Instead of a 4 year reenlistment with an incentive, I got a 2 year ""probationary"" reenlistment with no incentive. The only incentive I requested was to go to a different unit so I can get the ""shitbag"" tag off of me completely, because it followed me to my next unit because I was a PFC when I showed up instead of a Corporal where I should have been. My ""probationary"" reenlistment papers said 2 years and I had to stay in my same unit. After that I can reenlist again and get whatever I wanted. I said fuck that and got out.  Now, I work for a college police department doing dispatching and records management. I passed the damn background check for working at a police department. They saw my two NJPs for Article 92 x2. They asked me about it. I said I got drunk when I wasn't supposed to and told them the truth, and they still let me in.  So, the NJP isn't the end of the world."
USMC,3b7038,meeshkyle,3,Fri Jun 26 16:41:34 2015 UTC,"If PMO was involved there could be a record on the NCIC which would come up during a background check.   Now, it's about how you pick yourself back up."
USMC,3b7038,bug_eyed_earl,3,Fri Jun 26 15:18:41 2015 UTC,"Hell I don't even know if I was NJPd. I skipped a PFT which was two days before EAS, was up in front of the acting CO the next day, and got fined a thousand bucks. I don't even know, either way Honorable Discharge, and because S-4 or S-3 (the office guys I can't remember it was 20 years ago) barracks were next to ours and I got along with and partied with a bunch of them the fine was silently slipped under my discharge processing papers during final processing. Never paid it. Whoops."
USMC,3b7038,guy-le-doosh,2,Sat Jun 27 07:33:18 2015 UTC,It can also have an adverse effect on future security clearances if you plan on working for the government as a civilian.
USMC,3b7038,sonsue,2,Fri Jun 26 15:01:22 2015 UTC,Only if going for a TS clearance.  Even then it's evaluated on a case by case basis.  Shouldn't be too hard to get hired if the agency really wants him.
USMC,3b7038,Assofdeath,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"OK, I got out in December 2008, had an NJP about three months prior, and MOL said I still had my TSSCI clearance almost a year later."
USMC,3b7038,DasJuden63,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:49:34 2015 UTC,You didn't have any clearance. That is not the way clearances work. As soon as you leave a job that requires it your clearance is considered suspended. Your investigation that is taken into consideration when awarding you a clearance is good for five years.   As far as SCI goes you were either SCI eligible and it was never activated or you were read out before leaving your command and you somehow don't remember.
USMC,3b7038,sonsue,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:36:54 2015 UTC,"That's not true, it will be taken into consideration for any level of clearance. Of course it's evaluated on a case by case basis that is why they call them ""cases."" It completely depends on which agency he is applying to on whether ""it shouldn't be to hard"" or not. I'm in no way saying an NJP is the end of the world or trying to discourage OP. All I said was ""it can have and adverse effect"" and it can. I will go further then that and say that unless they change the process OP will discuss/explain this incident every single time he goes through a security investigation for the rest of his/her life."
USMC,3b7038,sonsue,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:43:05 2015 UTC,"That's interesting to know, since I was always told differently.  Not that it matters, but for my own knowledge I'll speak to my security officer about it on Monday.  I don't want to pass wrong info to the next OP."
USMC,3b7038,Assofdeath,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:13:52 2015 UTC,"OPM conducts the clearance investigations for the civilian agencies (the one that just got hacked) and also does quite a few for DOD (especially overseas). If you want you can look at the SF-86 here. It's long but you will see in there on page 16 Section 13A.6 it asks applicants to disclose this if it occurred in the last seven years. This is just what you voluntarily disclose prior to the interview process. The actual interview contains whole sections of questions that contain the word ""ever"" instead of the standard 5 or 7 year scopes of investigation.   Again this in no way will automatically disqualify OP. The most important thing you can do during a security clearance investigation is to be honest. I'm not trying to sound like your DI giving you the""Moment of truth"" but though those interviews are administrative lying to the interviewer can be prosecuted criminally."

USMC,3b61w2,tadmau5,3,Fri Jun 26 23:50:02 2015 UTC,One thing I learned from when I used to smoke quite a bit was to only smoke with a good mindset and a full stomach. Anxiety leads to anxiety and a full stomach kept me content. I never had anxiety problems or paranoia when I followed those rules. Obviously it's not very scientific and it's just my own experience but maybe give it a shot.
USMC,3b61w2,159753789456123,3,Sat Jun 27 01:37:53 2015 UTC,"I've read that the effects of smoking green are learned, i.e.: it's going to give you the feeling you are expecting. When first started smoking, it was great! I felt, despite all everything I'd heard, energetic focused clear-headed and generally more in-touch with myself. I was able to have meta-cognitive time with myself and put a lot of the BS in perspective and in order.   One time, I smoked too much of something stronger and got a bit freaked out. After this, I thought it was all green that's going to make me freak out and that's what started happening: I freaked out every time. I asked a friend who had more experience in these matters and they suggested to meditate after smoking. Push all the negativity out of your mind. That was actually my mantra ""breathe in life, breathe out worry."" Reach from your mind into your nerve receptors in your feet up your legs and up your body. Don't sit there and think about shit because you'll start playing that hopscotch game where everything is linked and suddenly everyone hates you and are plotting your downfall. Just because you're high, doesn't mean you aren't in control of yourself. Lay down your bed and breathe in life.  I get that this sounds like yoga monk hippie crap or whatever, but like /u/ferfer1313 said man, smoking green is a much much better vice than alcohol. Especially for people who have been in the shit. It definitely was for me. If your state has medicinal use, find strains that are lower in THC (~15-18%) and higher in CBD. Typically your indicas will be in that area. If indicas aren't your thing (they're not mine), find hybrids with lower THC."
USMC,3b61w2,hu_lee_oh,2,Mon Jun 29 14:59:41 2015 UTC,That's unfortunate. My best guess if you try again is to start very small so you just get the relaxed rather than freak out stoned. I've found it to be a much better vice than alcohol.

I love the old adage, ""don't let the green grass fool you"" but I smoke now, and it helps my spasms in my back, and stress.  I had a roommate, recon, in Fallujah 2004, really f'ed up man, everyone can tell, great guy.  But he smoked and it seriously brought him back down a ton.  He was bad, drinking 24/7 literally, in a town where he literally just walked around, saw friends babysitting, walked in and went right to the liquor cabinet of his friends.  Not that he thought less of them, he thought of nothing, not you, me, or himself.  He drank the pain away.  Tried all different shit.  But we all always mellowed out on marijuana.  You all may frown, never tried it myself, but I'm hoping ecstasy/MDMA really starts helping out, because supposedly the trials are amazing and are fixing anyone with PTSD over time and supervised use of a physician.  I'm not for drugs and their legalization, as I will ever be for making sure you fuckers can manage your lives and be what you should be, first over everything.  You gave a shit ton, so did I.  Let me and other mofos test shit out, and if it works, maybe you try it.  But maybe you try something else too.  There are more ways to tackle any problem, and mine or yours may not be the best for everyone.  Realize the founding fathers all used pot...and grew it.  In fact everyone did, up until around about a hundred years ago and hemp, not marijuana, became a threat to some industries.  But marijuana was also a competitor for morphine/heroine and the like.

Even though our existential threats are Russia, China, Iran, and DPRK, I don't think we're going to see a full scale ground war again, it would completely reshape the globe if that were to occur.  So with more insurgencies being the new enemy, I think it would be a good idea to invest more in the Special Operations, since conventional warfare and kill counts simply don't matter in the theater's we'll probably be staying in.

Is it really that not a single graduate of Columbia received a commission, or is it that this is the first commission since the ROTC program was reinstated?   The reason I find this hard to believe is that the Ivy League schools are very well represented among USMC officers. In my TBS class alone, we had at least ten Lieutenants who came from Princeton, Harvard, Dartmouth, or Cornell.   It just seems a statistical impossibility that not a single Columbia grad was commissioned for over 3 decades."
USMC,3b2lcb,HapTrek13,2,Thu Jun 25 18:26:17 2015 UTC,"It is a bit misleading.  Columbia graduates have commissioned through the PLC program. There is usually 1 every year or two, about the same as the rest of the Ivy schools.  This is the first officer to commission ""at"" Columbia because it's on campus, the faculty participates, etc.  The PLC guys commission with an OSO somewhere else and the university isn't involved.  OCC officers could also come from Ivies  but it's extremely uncommon.  The ROTC there is obviously still a good thing though because all those super bright kids don't have to choose between their education or the military anymore."

I believe there are a few more through Barnard College (Columbia's college for women).  If you want to see the video and read more, here's a link straight from Columbia University.  Columbia University heavily recruits veterans.  I inquired about it and I got an early action waiver in the mail. The waiver is specific for vets. The former President of Veterans at Columbia, Sean, lobbied for veterans to get in. He was a former green beret.  Dartmouth is making a push also, they recruit heavy. Yale is the next one coming up. Brown and Cornell are still trying to recruit, but they are scratching their heads about how to reach out to veterans. Harvard has tried, but only through their Extension school. Princeton hasn't reach out to the vet community, they won't take transfers. I believe they only have 1 vet in their undergraduate program today. University of Pennsylvania does reach out to veterans but through their LPS program, which is better than Harvard's.   Regardless, Columbia University beats them all and the numbers don't lie.

Jump school's a joke, I don't even know why the fuck the airwing ones exist, and arguably the hardest one to get is a fucking dumb ass scuba mask. If we're gonna wear some dumb ass badges to make our dicks feel bigger, at least make them either useful like to identify your MOS (still dumb), or something that's an actual accomplishment such as Expert Qual 3 times in a row or running a 300 PFT.

USMC,3b6l0a,MR_JACK_DANIELS,23,Fri Jun 26 12:06:34 2015 UTC,"Well, assuming your generally asking and not just trolling -- I went 0311 for an adventure, not for a career. I grew up in a small town in Louisiana and I wanted to see the world. I was part of the JROTC in high school and our instructor was a retired MSGT. He had been through Vietnam and was one hell of a dude. I had never met anyone like him, and he was 0311. I signed up a year before graduation.     Now, to address some of the questions you posed directly:     Don’t you know all that training to be a rifleman comes in great when you want to work at a company that pays 20k to 30K a year[?]     I would say half my friends became cops, 25% went to college, and 25% found very impressive management jobs nearing six figures after just a few years. Grunts know that the job teaches you to fight wars as a technical specialty, not too useful in real life. The real value, though, is the leadership and character development. Yeah, it's a grinder. Some guys come out fucked up, but some guys come out ten times stronger than they went in.     You can do many things, but I don’t think I[']d trust you to work on my network, or develop my app on Xcode or Android.     Haha, why not? I'm working on an iOS app in my free time now. What precludes me from developing apps? Is my app somehow going to knife hand you every time you put your hands in your pocket. Wait... that's my next one!   0311, what have you done now in the Marines now that will ensure you have at the LEAST a bachelor’s degree by the time you get out?     I could barely sleep and shit, yet alone get a degree. Who the hell gets degrees in Afghanistan? I didn't even have power. Even if I had some free time, I never would have gotten my degree unless they literally sat me on a campus and gave me the money to do it. Oh wait... the GI bill does that. Why? My degree was hard ass work, 14 hour days 7 days a week for four years. I'd like to see someone do that while on active duty. ""Hey LCPL, why do you have a light on in your firing hole?""  -""Well SSGT, I'm trying to model the vibrations of this beam.""     It’s all about whose VMET is bigger when they got out anyway.     No, it isn't.      Why don’t you go pick up a study guide while your jerk around on your off duty hours and project yourself for a prometric exam for some worthwhile certification.     Or not, nerd. No, but seriously, many guys do this. I became a certified personal trainer. It was easy, and gave me some spending money in college.     So, I'm still pretty sure this post is a troll ('dat username). However, if you are actually curious and have more questions, I'll do my best to try and answer them.    Semper Fi!"

Of course you have those who simply want to fight, but many want more than that. In my platoon alone, there are about 7 or 8 Marines, all NCOs, who joined with a bachelors degree. Why would they join after already having lucrative degrees? Because they want to serve their country, not themselves, unlike certain self serving, self centered pricks. Nobody gives a fuck about your systems, or your petty, vindictive, egotistical attitude about those who serve something other than themselves. I hope you enjoyed your military career, sitting at a help desk, doing college courses, while real service members were out beyond the fence, suffering, fighting, and dying.

I was a boot during that hump, stayed up until about 1AM thursday morning field daying, got up at 3am to draw rifles at the armory, staged for the hump to step at 6am, didn't step until 7 am.

Nothing is going to get you faster than Fartleks (google it) and Intervals while not simultaneously sacrificing endurance.  Marine Corps PT is almost always some form of running, or using your legs (humps).

USMC,3b1vm6,dancoy2000,7,Thu Jun 25 11:28:45 2015 UTC,"Also, the second part, and probably the most important part of being a Marine as far as the physical is concerned: learn to love pushing yourself. Learn to love the pain of a hard PT session and the relief/pride/high you feel when you know you gave it 100% of your effort. Leave a session puking, or so tired you can barely lift your arms or legs. If you are cursing the guy who invented stairs the day after a good workout, you did good.

Second thing I noticed is that you said 3 mile run is a medium to long term goal. This it is not. Get a coach to 5k app for your phone and do it. In a month you'll be running long distances. Additionally I would join team sports in high school. Pick sports like cross country, football, and wrestling. Cross country will teach you to run, football to not be afraid and lower the boom on people and wrestling will test yourself against others. If you get good at wrestling you'll do fine in the Marines.   During the off season do pull ups until your body has fully grown then hit the weights. Always watch your nutrition for best results. Get protein, vegetables, and good carbs. Drink lots of water and skip the soda.   The good news is that if you do this you'll also start being noticed by others. Additionally it should kick in more testosterone which will give you more energy and focus after a couple months of training. Start now and in a year you'll see a transformation you didn't think possible!   Good luck, I hope this helps, and sori if my formatting is bad I'm on a cellphone."

I really would not suggest doing it unless you rank above a Sgt you will be getting talked down to by obese bartenders and shelf stockers who squeeze into marpats one weekend a month to take their frustrations out on 19 year olds. Deployments now consist of MEU's which come once every 3-5 years and are volunteer basis. 2 and 1/2 years out I feel like a civilian not a Marine and when I put on my uniform I constantly forget to do basic customs and courtesy shit because it's not a part of my lifestyle. Auxillary would be a better word than reserves because we're more civilian than anything. if you want an idea of the pay scale look at my history and I made a comment based on my experience and my brothers.

You will be awake 18 hours a day, lots of boots and utes PT, lots of field ops and lots of academics with some weekends off. Since a WO is supposed to be a SME in their respective MOS, I suggest you get good at your intended MOS and also REALLY good at just being a Marine and knowing administrative and operations orders, all the 1000 and 3000 SSIC type of stuff."

USMC,3ax8vg,Sgt_Slate,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:42:09 2015 UTC,"I would say you need to brush up on Marine Corps knowledge, customs/courtesies, etc. I'd also make sure you got good numbers in all of the scores HQMC cares about (PFT, CFT, Range). Other than that, I'm not sure. You get sent to TBS with a bunch of bootenants and then on to warrant officer school if I'm not mistaken. Had I stayed in, I would have definitely put in to be an 065X WO. That job would have been awesome."

USMC,3arkmt,trim_reaper,14,Tue Jun 23 21:33:21 2015 UTC,"Oh boy.  Is this EVER a personal sore point for me!  I will try to type this without having an aneurism.  This is long.....  I was back on Oki and I had a new WO come to the unit.  Before Oki, he was a SSgt prior to that at a unit at Camp Pendleton.  A lot of us knew of him but didn't really know him on a personal level because he was kind of an awkward and strange dude.  Really quiet, kept to himself, didn't show any real leadership from what we could tell.  He was an NCO that always filled weird billets so one time he was Training NCO, then another time he was ToolRoom NCO, and other jobs that we thought were bullshit.    So this clown picks up WO.  He comes back to the Rock and he is put in charge of the Heavy Equipment shop.  So this is his very first shop and he's changing things right and left.  SNCO's were all pissed but it was what it was.    Then his wife started coming around.  And she was huge.  Not your typical fat-body, but a real big-time heavyweight.  3-chins heavy.    All of us were like ""Dude, really?""  But whatever.  We were used to seeing fat women married to Marines.    So one day she pulls up and I'm standing outside.  She walks by and says something to me and I say ""What's up.""  That's how I greet people.  I say ""what's up"".  It's not a question.  It's just a comment.  I acknowledged her.  She leaves and shortly after that, WO calls me into his office.  He starts to give me a talking to about how I'm supposed to greet his wife.  ""Whats' up"" isn't an appropriate greeting.  I barely called him ""sir"" as it was and so after that talk, it was all I could do to look at the dude.  So skip forward a few months and I had another incident with the wife when she came up while I had the Marines in formation and she looked at me as she walked by.  I didn't say anything to her and so this woman interrupts me while I'm passing word and she prods me like ""Aren't you going to say anything to me?  I don't remember the exact words she said but I told her, ""You don't wear your husbands rank.  I salute him and recognize his rank only.  Unless you've been through Marine Corps boot camp or OCS, you don't rate ""just because"". This was right in front of the entire platoon.  I was pissed!  Needless to say, she felt the need to challenge me and I was kinda shocked because I expected her to storm into her husbands office but she didn't.  She just walked to the side and stood there, waiting for me to dismiss the platoon and then decided that she was going to give me a talking to.  Yeah, right.    I listened to her.  And then when she was done, I told her once again that I respected the rank of her husband and that was it.  Nowhere was there a Marine Corps Order for me to salute her, stop a formation, or do anything to acknowledge her.  That's what I said in general, I just didn't use such nice words.  She then said something about my wife that the only way she would have known was if her husband told her and I flipped the fuck out.    About this time, Gunny was coming out and a couple other SNCO's were hot on his tail.  He was calling me over to him but the fire was pretty much pouring from my eyes and mouth.    So I'm furious and I have a loud voice but that insane woman wasn't backing down.  Gunny grabs me and is pushing me away and one of the SSgt's is walking her in the other direction.  Of course, I'm yelling about her size and if she ever mentioned my wife's name again, I would send my wife after her.  My wife didn't even weigh 100 pounds so all that she would have to do was sit on her and my wife would have been crushed to death.....  I get dragged back into the WO's office and he flips out on me and we pretty much get into a heated argument.  He's telling me to shut up and I wouldn't until he said he's giving me a direct order to shut up.  My weak ass Gunny is in there and not coming to my defense.  He stood there and is telling me I should have greeted her properly and then continued with the formation.    The WO gets done with me and I storm out of there and the 1st Sgt calls up to see me.  So I go down there and get my ass chewed by the 1st Sgt and then the CO wanted a piece, so he called me into his office and took a piece of my ass too.  The next day, they gave me a Page-11 entry and sent my ass to Anger Management Class the following week.  A fucking Page-11!!  I ended up leaving that place because I had to Request Mast as the WO hated me.  I still hate him.  If I see his ass crossing the street today, I'd run that clown over.  TL:DR; Dependa wife demanded proper greeting.  Didn't happen.  Page-11 Entry & Anger Management Classes."

I ran into a fuckwad SSgt of mine post EAS about six years after the fact. We were at a bar, I was alone, he was with a group including his wife. He 'jokingly' told me I should have saluted him. I walked over to his table and told him he was a miserable human and his mother should have swallowed.  Silence. He started to say something as I walked back to the bar and I may or may not have threatened to 'gut him with my dick'.  One of the top three moments in my life. I was high off that shit for months. I hated that fuck. For two years he breathed down my neck for lack of better to occupy himself with.

But could talk shit with the best and always talking about what he was going to do.  So the asshole retires and there's no good-byes, nothing.  Not even a ""See ya later"".  I had told him that if I ran into him in the civilian world, I would tell him what he was all about.  Well, I don't remember the exact reason what he came to pick up but I ran into him as he was leaving.  I was like a fly landing on shit.  I was all over his ass. I had him cornered and went the hell off.  I don't remember everything I said but it was basically what everybody in the unit wanted to tell him.  What they were afraid to tell him, I told him and he didn't do shit.  He just kept asking ""Can I leave now?""  He got a job at the County Clerk office and one day I went in there to get my license plates renewed.  He saw me coming and turned and sped off. LOL....what a punk!"

If he was the dumb fuck would have found one. What bugs me is that the dependa fiasco is entirely a creation of the Marine Corps itself. We're the ones bringing these people into the fold. No one forces these fucktards to marry their high school sweethearts or random strippers putting themselves through a communication    arts degree, but they do anyways.

But like /u/redworm said, if the Marine Corps had actually put a little funding into better living for the barracks I probably wouldn't have seen every other PFC getting married after their first 3 months in the fleet.

It was about as calm and perfect as you'd imagine ALLLLLLL day long.  Fast forward 2-3 weeks and we hit port in Brisbane and start off-loading for liberty.

You're not even a real Marine!""  I would have rather done PT, sit through some classes, go outside for mcmap, chow, and then some more classes and get off at a reasonable hour than go months at a time without seeing the sun because night crew.

I have never met a ground side dude that was on the boat with wingers who didn't haven respect for them after watching up close and personal how the wing operates.    working days on end is bad   My record was three and a half months in garrison with no days off.

Being a skid kid and being FAP'd to the range where it is mostly grunts makes me realize how much more we work in the wing.  All the ground side guys did was bitch about any work that showed up and the few wingers were always looking for work every possible chance.  Not saying the ground side doesnt suck, because every job in the military sucks somehow, but its a whole different kind of suck which is mostly boredom and pointless bullshit as opposed to constant hours of shitty work with no time off."

Now as far as deployments go, ground side life sucks in country, but at least they're doing real Marine things.  I personally haven't been given the oppurtunity to deploy, nor will i get the chance to do so, but i imagine a ground side deployment, especially infantry, is more rewarding in the sense that you can see the actual shit thats going on. You really experience the country and the life of deployment more and come back with more knowledge, culture, and life experience than those of us in the wing. Add to that the sense of making a difference as well. Unfortunately the ground side does typically take on a larger burden of loss of Marines and dealing with such tragedy, which is an awful thing to deal with, so much that im sure words cannot describe it, but i would rather go through all that, and be able to say i did something with my time in the service, something to be really proud of, than to say i got better at fixing shit than i had before, and if i deploy, say i launched a bird out to a TIC in time, which is absolutely something to be proud of, and something that matters, but just not the same as the other shit people are doing.

It was not until I got to my MOS school I learned of my electrical wizardry. I trained rigorously in the defense against the electrical shock, as well as learning the magical properties of electricity and how to bend them to my will. Although it was not until after I hit the fleet I realized just how broken these machines could become by the hands of Marines.   There were good times and bad times, and worse time and better times. Took away a valuable skill from it all and am happy with that. Also when the inevitable apocalypse comes, my skills will be of immeasurable value.  Got a little carried away there..."

Its easier to communicate certain things. I was also in another unit which was comprised of all sorts of mechanics, which made things harder trying to explain generator problems to my platoon Sgt who is MT.   As far as stress goes it all depends on the job at hand. Sometimes it can run smoothly while other times shit would suck because people decided ""Hey lets put oil in the fuel tank of these 3 generators!"". But it was nice being separate from a lot of bull shit because what do you know the generator is down, I have to see to that before I can do whatever it was you wanted me to do. Or times where I may or may not have had the fuse in my pocket that would allow that generator to work. Looks like this will take some time to look at ;).

USMC,3as2wy,unusuallytallgnome,3,Tue Jun 23 12:19:03 2015 UTC,"That shit is no sweat.  Take a torque wrench for example.  We have a computer controlled calibrator that applies a set amount of torque to the wrench if it doesn't 'snap' within tolerances we melt the lead off of the adjustment socket, turn it a few clicks and try again.  Rince and repeat until it is in tolerance.  Then we pour lead into the end of the torque wrench and it's good to go.  Gauges were even easier.  Most of the calibration time was programming the stupid pressure calibrator.  If it was a bad gauge we just replaced it from supply and calibrated the new gauge.  That's why our boots started out in torque and pressure, it's easy and hard to fuck up."

It depends on the people you are working with, when I first got to Comm Bn I don't remember doing a lot of work or having much fun at all. But I went on some awesome MEB sized field ops and met up with some really good NCO's who were passionate about passing the torch. At the MEU for pre-deployment we worked all the time and had a lot of late nights, there was a lot of MI's, JLTI's, RIP runs and of course GCSS was a nightmare all the time. We were always battling with Supply, MMO and our operators over parent child relationships. I had to mount a TV on a wall, just because we had power tools and no one else did.  Don't tell your NCO's you are bored, just ask them about their deployments. Ask them what they worked on and if they can show you what they did out there. If you can't sodder, practice soddering. Ask people for broken headphones and try to fix them. Go out and work with the radio companies when they are setting up OE antennas. Go up to the Engineers and talk to them about how important grounding equipment is, in the field it's your job to make sure all the grounds are good because you are the only one with the right test equipment. You can go over to S/R and ask about all the test equipment they have, if you don't know how to operate it, figure it out.  A unit only sucks if everyone let's it suck.  Someone has to be proactive and try to set up classes that people actually want to sit in on.   Try to make a Cantenna out of a pringles tube, plug it into the wifi antenna port on a wifi router and see how far you can get wifi signal with your phone. We tried making two of them so we could make a poor man's MRC-142C once. You get to learn a lot of basic radio stuff, practice soddering, eat pringles and have fun at work.

Must be nice to have a nice cool tent to work in.""  Yeah, it is fucking nice. I can't count the number of times I've had to explain that if our servers get too hot they will literally shut down and kill all network connectivity. Being able to be in the AC when it's hot as shit is just an added perk. Ever seen a COC flip out because the network went down and they have an understanding of IT equivalent to a lizard?  Wire Corporal: ""Man, how come fucking Data never gets pinged for camp guard or range drivers.""  Because there's like 7 of us and we are responsible for providing the entire battalion with network access and maintaining our own 24 hour watch. Additionally, wire gear can be set up by one guy in about 2 hours but for some reason there's like 15 of you in the shop. Yeah, some of you will get pulled for bitch duty.  Company Gunny(on phone): ""Hey fucking Data. My shit's not working.""  Yes it is, the company clerk just clipped your box with his foot when he was giving you a handy. This caused the Ethernet cable to fall out. Taking two seconds to look at the machine would have saved my shop 30 minutes walking over to battalion to plug in a cable for you.  Comm O: ""Hey Data, just got off the phone with Fox company. They need a data guy to look at their printer.""  God dammit, stop calling my Comm O over some dumb help desk shit. The less I have to talk to him, the better my life is. Idiots from the companies calling him over a printer is a waste of his time and we have a help desk number specifically for this type of shit."

USMC,3as2wy,gtfomyinternets,2,Wed Jun 24 02:52:56 2015 UTC,"You guys are awesome. I was always thankful for Data. Just wanted to ask if you've ever seen this before? A few years ago our tent was setup across from COMM's tent. They had cwire for their compound and we had triple c-wire for ours. Comm ran a nipr line (sweet jeebus thank you!) to our tent under the c-wire. It was kinda covered up some with mud, but not very well. One day, our OIC is going through the ECP and sees that the nipr line -you know the one kinda half assed covered in dirt under razor sharp wire- was cut in half. He was pissed and started accusing one of us of purposely cutting the wire with a knife. I honestly couldn't tell if he was serious at first, but he was."
USMC,3as2wy,danpage617,6,Tue Jun 23 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"Cutting what? The cable or the actual metal C-wire? Usually we had to run the cable about a foot under the ground to keep trucks and shit from running over them and cutting it. People get mega butthurt when their NIPR goes out though. That's their gateway to that sweet, sweet Facebook in the field."

There is no way I'm jumping back on the S6 Slave Party.   I liked my comm shop, Data always had NIPR and had some good video games. Radio had Iridium Phones and was up to something stupid. We just had a lot of power tools, a cool place to hang out and about 10 TB of movies and some big TVs.

Radio chief was always asking why no one from ""ISMO"" was on any working party and the Comm Chief would straight up say ""Because I need my internet up Gunny...that ok with you?"" The best was in the field, we'd set up NIPR/SIPR... post the authorized users list outside the tent (which he never was on) and refuse to let him in when he came by to ""check on things"".

Hops on and does 3 (even though he is a gym rat and can do 20 strongman pull ups with ease) during crutches he did the bare minimum again... (I think 60?)

Actual Marines who understand the way the Marine Corps works don't hate MPs, it's the 20 year old LCpl that still have the same mentality of LE that they did when they were in high school that hate MPs. It's a lot to do with you maturity level and how well you can behave as a professional."

THATS A BUDDY FUCK AND A HALF but also their job."
USMC,3aus01,Leotheawesome,8,Tue Jun 23 22:28:23 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. A buddy of mine, a great fucking Marine through and through, went out drinking in town at 29. He got way to drunk, and being the responsible Marine that he was, got a hotel room. While coming back on base the next morning, the front gate boot PFC gave him a DUI even though he blew under the legal limit of .08. He claimed he reeked of alcohol... DONT BE THAT GUY! I understand there's an occasional asshole who wants to beat his wife and then pull a knife when the MP's show up (<----Happened in 29 while I was there) or get blacked out drunk in the barracks and start throwing furniture off the third deck (also happened), but there is a time to take your job serious and time not too. I'm not saying let your guard down, but understand the times when you need to punish/arrest or educate, IE pull a Marine to the side, tell him how to fix himself, and put him on his way. DONT FUCK US, for some of us, this is our career."
USMC,3aus01,kilo31,3,Tue Jun 23 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"I can see how your friend is being responsible by getting a hotel out in town and deciding not to drink and drive. The part I don't understand is how did he get charged with a DUI if he was under the legal limit I've never heard of that an had no idea that was possible. And your right about not letting your guard down, a lot of MPs are still very young too and are rarely going to be as tact all the time as a lot of civilian LE officers who have +10 years in the job compared to some MPs who might only have a year or two."
USMC,3aus01,maxb2819,3,Tue Jun 23 20:54:24 2015 UTC,"If they can determine you're driving impaired then it's a DUI. The legal limit is more like a guidepost, really.   Imagine the soccer mom who gets together with the other soccer moms one time a year, and has a glass of wine (and she's otherwise sober the rest of the year). It can have a more profound effect, and she could be driving impaired if she got behind the wheel, but otherwise be below the legal limit.   Anyway, dude probably shoulda had a shower, I'm sure he did smell like booze. It's pretty obvious he was being responsible, he for sure shouldn't have gotten charged."
USMC,3aus01,ChanceTheDog,2,Tue Jun 23 21:45:21 2015 UTC,"Also, bases can have different limits than in town. Camp pendleton is only .05 while town is .08. So you would still get a dui even if you were legal in town."
USMC,3aus01,earthwormjim91,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:57:03 2015 UTC,"What was the legal limit on base? It can be different than out in town. For instance, it is .08 in town but camp pendleton is only .05. So what is legal in town would get you a dui at the gate."
USMC,3aus01,earthwormjim91,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"It was .08 and the legal limit in 29 is a moot point. He was on base and his actions feel under the UCMJ and base Generals rules. Last I remember, if you blew .02 or more, you got charged with a DUI; base General's orders. I might be wrong, but it was something stupid low. We had a lot of guys dying out in town from DUI's right before the Iraq War, shit got really stupid when higher ups tried to curve that shit."

Its not hard to follow the rules. Don't drink until you are of age. Yeah I know people feel you shouldn't have to wait and all that, but you have to accept the risk if you do it. Don't drink and drive, don't do drugs, don't get in fights.  99% of the time if you follow these simple rules you will not have a bad experience with an MP.  When it comes to speeding, I can't blame them, I'd be willing to wager its either a requirement or a case where they feel they have to do it. Same with civi cops. Most speed themselves but when they are on duty the big guy says give tickets."

USMC,3aus01,jeffreyschon,2,Tue Jul 14 19:11:39 2015 UTC,"Ewww!  I would recommend working on not giving a shit what other marines think of you, because just being an mp is enough for most marines to hate you.  I got out in 08, never got in trouble or even had a bad interaction with an mp, and I still for some unexplained reason cannot NOT hate them.  Totally unfair, but there it is, only a few degrees from being a soldier.  Bear this in mind; police agencies do not typically prefer a mp background with their applicants.  Too many bad habits and what have you.  In case that's why you're going down this dark bud-fuckery path."

USMC,3aus01,U_Damn_Hipsters,0,Wed Jun 24 01:23:29 2015 UTC,The one simple way is to go the Field mp route. Basically you are a grunt with a badge at that point.   If you want to to garrison which is mp work on the bases than you don't have much of an option of not being the bad guy. Everyone hates us till they need us us the common phrase you will hear. Use your taser often and instead of calling in the arrest find out who the guys Sgt or higher is and call them instead to come pick the dude up. DUIs are something that I personally would always arrest for sorry that is not something you just can sweep under the rug.

USMC,3aus01,SemperFiRocko,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:25:40 2015 UTC,That's for the answer. I figured MP was similar to civilian law enforcement in that you have discretion on some offenses. I'd much rather have someone get an ass chewing over denied reenlistment because he was being a drunk ass.      How do I get field MP? I am looking to get deployed during my contract so would field MP have a higher chance at that?
USMC,3aus01,Jimmyfinder,2,Tue Jun 23 19:19:33 2015 UTC,When you go to MOS school you get a choice to do Field or Garrison when you graduate and hit the fleet.   If you are top of your class like I was you also get a chance to go straight to K-9 school to be a dog handler which means you will get more options on when you want to do or what kind of unit you go to.

On the flip side, you'll be faster and last longer than most 11s without gear.  Rifle platoon commanders will misuse your assets.   You're target number one for any enemy as the machine gun is the battlefield dominator right after artillery.  Machine gun math is a real thing.

USMC,3as3qw,OvervektNorsk,5,Wed Jun 24 21:04:32 2015 UTC,"I found that, when I came into my CAAT platoon in Weapons Company, that I was amongst some of the most interesting assholes I would ever meet anytime in my life.   We were a mix of 31's and 52's, there was a fun rivalry there. Typically when out in the field we would get into fights a lot (fun fights...usually). And talk a lot of trash amongst ourselves but if the window lickers (51's) ever spoke up we almost literally killed them. We had a bit of respect for the 41's cause they carried the 81mm mortars, but they were kind of douchey as well. They had a unatural superiority complex that was not really warranted. The S/S platoon was housed in Weapons company with us and we usually made fun of the pigs...a lot...some the snipers came from our platoon so we tolerated them.   Humps sucked because we carried the .50 cal with the older (44lb) tripods and the extra barrel. Our 52's (most anyway) would also carry the system with us since we were in the platoon together. It was a huge point of pride in our platoon to be able to carry the system (along with M16 and everything else) on our humps. No matter what distance, when you finished it was a sign of respect (even more than high PFT scores).  I liked being a machingunner loved to shoot the .50 cal but my bread and butter was the MK19. I was pretty good with that, could hit pretty much whatever I wanted. It was a different story with the duece. One time on Range 9 or 10 (29 palms)we were shotting at the moving target silhouettes with the .50 cal mounted on the humvee's. Out of a box of 100 rounds of APIT I got 3 hits, lol.  We used to leave room in the humvees for coolers filled with gatorades and would take great pleasure in busting one out anytime we drove by the crunchies. The sun glistening off of the iced up lemom lime bottle was a glorious sight sitting in the turrnet looking down on the 11's. Sorry fellas.  My platoon was a little more old, a little more mature and we had the baddest mother fucker in the BN in our platoon. He was an asshole, philadelphia brawler who nobody would fuck with. Great to have on your side.   I spent my entire Marine Corps career making fun of motards, hard charges and career Marines. Not that there was anything wrong with them per se, just found them a bit douchey. I miss my Marine buddies (of all MOS's) and enjoyed being an 03 thirty dumb-one but I don't miss the Marine Corps. My only regret for all of my military service was that I did not get to serve in combat with Marines from my unit.   Infantry training can be fun, but its more fun with a bigger gun. Since I was older and I was good with computers I got volunteered to go into the headquarters to be the Training NCO/Admin Clerk. It actually worked out best for me since I was married with a new baby boy and that gave me more time to be able to complete college and leave the Marines with my Bachelor degree. Being a Marine is great, being in the Marine Corps sucks.   There are many paths in the infantry and outside of high school type ravalry that I noted above your MOS is often immaterial to your experiences (the experience with the other Marines is what counts...period).  Good luck!"

USMC,3am8bl,Recyclebot,2,Sun Jun 21 20:15:03 2015 UTC,"It makes sense honestly. He said it was because it shows that you handled extra responsibility on top of whatever responsibility you have at your rank.   (That's paraphrased so again I apologize if I botched terminology)   While I'm here...  As far as he knows I can take classes before I rate TA, I just have to pay for them out of pocket.   If I start taking them as a LCpl with <9 months in grade do they still count towards my education points even though I don't rate a cutting score?   I know odds are I won't have time for it but I'd still like to know in case it ends up being possible."
USMC,3aln0l,Tastetheload,5,Sun Jun 21 12:40:08 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same camp and I have worked with them on occasion. Here's the best answers I can come up with. Someone else is going to have to chime in to fill in the blanks.   Yes. Oki's a small island, but still a big island when you don't have a car. There's plenty to do, but getting there is the trick. At least some of your NCOs will have cars, don't hesitate to ask to bum a ride off someone occasionally. Local public transportation is quite extensive (bus system) but it's kinda complicated and it's in Japanese. Taxis are relatively expensive but can get you anywhere. Maybe Don't know how your schoolhouse was, but most of the barracks on island (notably, the wing may be different) are 2-3 to a room. Most of my guys rooms are close quarters. Shockingly, yes it has a decent selection. Not amazing variety but it did not used to be this good. Used to be just the standard stuff, but they have expanded their selection. Yes, burgeoning business on Oki. I'm sure there's one within easy walking or taxi distance. Heck, there's one right outside of Hansen now. Okinawan food is cool, but the place used to be a hub of trade between China, Japan, and Korea. Bottom line is not only can you find good local food, you can get good Chinese food, great Korean food, and phenomenal Japanese food. Near Foster? Gen's (variety), Coco Ichi (curry), and a few others come to mind. Find a place you like (via exploring) and then share the wealth. A lot of Marines don't go anywhere, they just eat on base. Drag 'em out. It's the wing. Haven't been yet, but I assume they swing. Someone else will have more info. Depends on the specific sub-unit, CO, SNCOs and NCOs. You'll find out soon enough.   But again, I'm not with them, so I don't know their unit too well. Someone around here probably does."

Yep. My best advice to you is to get off base as much as you can. There's a travel agency beside the commissary on Foster, and they can get you tickets to events going on all over the island and elsewhere for pretty cheap. If that doesn't float your goat, then just walk around and get lost. There is so much to see and do on that tiny island; don't waste your entire tour playing Call of Duty in your barracks room like some people I knew.  2.) If you really want to be roommates, just ask the BEQ (Barracks) manager when he's assigning you rooms. You might get lucky, you might not. It makes his job easier if roommates like each other, though.  3.) When I was there, MWCS-18 occupied the first 2 floors of building 220, and MWHS-1 occupied the top 2 floors. MWSS-172 had their own building literally right next door, but I can't remember the building number. As for room size, they're just about the same size as the room I had at the schoolhouse in 29 palms. The only weird thing to note is that every 2 rooms are linked via a shared bathroom.  4.) No clue; as that wasn't my thing back then. If you're into beer, though, you should try one of my personal favorites which isn't really available in the US; Red Horse. It's dirt cheap, tasty, and potent.  5.) Not when I was there, but times have changed a bit in the last 5 years.  6.) Coco Ichibanya is my favorite restaurant there. Other than that, I know of a few others, but I can only remember how to get to them and their names elude me.  7.) My typical day started at 0530 for PT with my platoon. We'd run every day for a few miles, do some crunches, some pull ups, ect. That was usually over by 0700. Grab a quick shower, change clothes, grab breakfast, and report to work by 0800. Lunch was at 1200, report back to work at 1300. We got off work every day around 1600, unless it was Friday. Fridays we had a bazillion libo briefs to listen to before we went home around 1700ish.  8.) PT is always with some sort of section. Unless you're working insane hours or you're on OFP (Own Fucking Program), don't expect to PT on your own.  If you've got any more questions I can answer for you, just let me know. Enjoy your time on Okitraz, and try not to be a libo risk, for all of our sakes!"

Then it went to strictly 06's and the past couple of years it started opening up to other comm/electronics jobs. Wouldn't hurt to have your career planner ask the 0689 monitor, worst they can do is say no."
USMC,3alu1h,benjammin9292,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"Like not-a-recruiter said, you'd have to be one of those MOS' before going the 0689 route. I'd recommend 0651, because it's a shorter school, and depending on your rank you may be eligible for a reenlistment bonus."
USMC,3alu1h,0689,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:23:13 2015 UTC,Former 0689 here.  Sorry but only these MOS's are eligible:   0612: Tactical switch operator  0619: Wire chief  0621: Field radio operator  0623: Tropospheric scatter radio multi-channel equipment operator  0627: SHF Satellite Communications operator/maintainer  0629: Radio chief  0651: Cyber network operator  0659: Cyber systems chief  2651: Special intelligence system administrator/communicator  2821: Technical controller Marine  2823: Technical controller chief  2847: Telephone systems/personal computer intermediate repairer  5939: Aviation communication systems technician 5954: Air traffic control communications technician  5974: Tactical data systems administrator  6694: Aviation logistics information management and support specialist   Your best bet is to latmove to a 0651 and then after some time in the MOS apply for a second latmove to the 0689 MOS. Definitely worth it though. Let me know if you have any more specific questions related to the MOS. We're a tight group.

Active duty treats you that way because you let them   You sound like a dick, but you're still a Marine, so here's what I know:  going active duty is EXTREMELY difficult  Borderline impossible, there is a list online of open active duty billets that need to be filled, but again it's a very hard process.    An easier route is going active-reserve which is where you because active duty and stay on as support with a reserve battery kinda like I-I , possibly but not d definitely with your same unit.

He gets to enjoy all the things the Marines are missing, more specifically the Marine's girlfriend back at home while the Marine is away on active duty. The reason that they're called Jody specifically dates back to black soldiers in WWII. They took a character from old blues songs named Joe the Grinder (or Joe D.

USMC,3ae69z,USMCEE,40,Fri Jun 19 11:44:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know why /u/jamescovey got downvoted here.  He's completely right.  By creating MARSOC, the Marine Corps leadership acknowledged that the Marine Corps is just another conventional ground combat force.  The Corps lost another further differentiating factor between it and the Army, which is one more step down the inevitable future where the Marine Corps is disbanded entirely or folded, operationally and organizationally, into the Army to form a single, cohesive ground combat branch.  MARSOC isn't part of the Marine Corps anymore than USASOC is part of the Army or the Navy SEALs are part of the Navy.  Administratively, sure.  They follow the same policies and wear the same uniform.  But, SOF forces are effectively their own branch of the military (USSOCOM even has its own Title X funding stream, something no other COCOM has).  The only capability that was gained when MARSOC was created was that Marines no longer had to exit the Corps to join the SOF community.  It was a pure vanity exercise by Donald Rumsfeld and Gen Hagee.  The Corps gained nothing, USSOCCOM gained nothing, and that problem has just continued as MARSOC's continued fight for relevance inside SOCOM slowly becomes more and more public.  Giving MARSOC the ""Raider"" title was just another political exercise meant to give some historical legitimacy to an otherwise failed experiment and placate some loud, politically connected WWII vets who had been clamoring for decades for something to carry on the Raider name.  In doing so, they've violated a core tenet that had held firm within the Marines since it was founded -- that the title ""Marine"" was enough.  You could be an infantry Marine, an artillery Marine, a special operations Marine, or even a POG-ass Marine, but we were all Marines.    Now, well, fuck it.  Might as well hand out colored berets while we're at it."
USMC,3ae69z,sum-bullshit,9,Fri Jun 19 13:45:15 2015 UTC,"I think I see what you're saying, and it makes a lot of sense.  But at the same time, it left me with some questions.  How does having its own special operations arm reflect poorly on the Marine Corps, and not having one does not? Previously, guys left the Corps entirely for special operations.  If MARSOC isn't ""practically"" a part of the Marines Corps, how is the current situation any different?  Sure, maybe more people will seek to do it, but the amount that succeed will always be governed by available billets, right?  My instinct is to argue that it's better, because - practically separate or not - it means more, good, guys are wearing the uniform.  As for some kind of dissent or ""us vs them"" kind of problem as a result, you can't tell me that that doesn't exist already.  Whether it's 03's vs everyone, Recon vs everone, combat arms vs pogs, CAR vs non, there's a shit ton of rivalry already within the Marine Corps.  And come on, ""every Marine a rifleman"" is hardly more than a catch phrase.  Sure, coming out of boot camp, it's a level field, but who hasn't seen plenty of people make complete asses of themselves on the rifle range because they touch their rifles exactly once per year?  I don't know anyone here well enough to actually say this about them, so please don't get the wrong idea, but it kinda sounds like some 03s are pissed because they're no longer top dog.  I'm not saying you're wrong - I'm not nearly as in touch as many of the other guys here, and it's already been quite a while since I got out.  I just don't understand the doom and gloom aspect of this.  Most importantly, ""Raider"" is a much better name than SEAL or Ranger, so... yeah."
USMC,3ae69z,sum-bullshit,12,Fri Jun 19 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"OK, let me suss this out a bit more.  The Corps has always had a difficult history distinguishing itself from the Army.  Without going into a lot of long, boring details, the Corps today is close to facing an existential crisis.  The historical roles we played -- naval infantry and amphibious assault -- are historical anachronisms.    During the Cold War, we were able to continue to distinguish ourselves by straddling the line between the heavy, conventional Army, which was trained, equipped, and organized to counter the Soviet Union, and the more light and nimble ""unconventional"" forces fielded by SOCOM.  If you're old enough, you probably remember the ""expeditionary forces in readiness"" tagline.  That was us.  Lighter and more responsive  (thanks to the MAGTF concept) than the Army, but heavier than you could get from the Rangers.  Two things have fucked us in that regard -- the first was the Army's BCT modernization program, which re-organized the Army into elements similar to brigade-sized MAGTFs, dropping a lot of their heavy and sometimes specialized warfare capabilities and transitioning into an expeditionary role.  On top of that, we've been fighting for 15 years performing the exact same task as the Army, only doing it in a different Iraqi or Afghan province than the Army was.    By creating MARSOC, you've created a truly ""unconventional"" SOF-capable force of Marines, making the portrayal of the Marine Corps as filling that ""in-between"" mission substantially harder since you've now cast the rest of the Marines into a truly ""conventional"" light.     As for some kind of dissent or ""us vs them"" kind of problem as a result, you can't tell me that that doesn't exist already. Whether it's 03's vs everyone, Recon vs everone, combat arms vs pogs, CAR vs non, there's a shit ton of rivalry already within the Marine Corps.   You're right.  But you've gotta look at it in the context of Marine Corps history.  Shit, the Marine Corps was so against individualization that Marines never even had their names on their uniform until the mid-1990s.  There was even some noise in the mid-to-late 90s to end the wearing of qualification badges since the scuba bubble and gold wing combo was an unofficial symbol for recon.  We still, today, don't wear unit designation patches.  And the Commandant himself recently said that if he could get rid of DI, MSG, and recruiter ribbons, he would.  Sure, between ourselves, we would always give each other shit.  My unit is better than yours, your MOS is shit, you're a fucking POG, you're a dumbass gun rock, whatever.  But to the outside?  To everyone else?  We were all Marines.  Now we're not.  Now we're Marines...and they're Raiders.  Or, ""we're Raiders, not just Marines.""    Make sense?"
USMC,3ae69z,dieslow0341,6,Fri Jun 19 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"From what you just said, regardless of MARSOC adopting the Raider name, the Marine Corps is already headed towards becoming irrelevant.  Despite your FEELINGS the Marine Corps is a conventional force, but wants to put back int the spotlight it's Amphibious expeditionary capabilities hence the MEF build up in the Pacific.  Doing joint training and port visits are great, but not having an iron in the fire like the other branches makes us irrelevant."
USMC,3ae69z,ChanceTheDog,6,Fri Jun 19 20:09:34 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. It's ""Raider,"" but more importantly, it's ""Marine Raider.""   That's how the term was coined in the 40s, and that's how it should be looked at now. I always thought the Marines lacked a specific title to its special forces capable group, Force Recon. Let's be honest with ourselves. Marine Raider sounds fucking cool, and it's something people can choose to pursue, much in the same vein as people who pursue the title of Ranger or SEAL. I'm for this change."

USMC,3ae69z,sum-bullshit,2,Fri Jun 19 19:46:12 2015 UTC,"I can envision exactly what youre saying, but I dont think the Marine Corps could possibly be absorbed or disbanned. The core of it all is the ability to operate in MAGTFs including afloat.    None of that necessitates a completely separate branch, under a completely separate department, that's trained, equipped, and organized in a completely different manner.  Ask yourself:  What mission does the US Marine Corps perform, today, means that it needs the same degree of separation from the Army that the Air Force and Navy enjoy?   Allowing the immediate response to ""perform such duties as the president may direct"". And the MSG as well as Security Forces piece?The Army and USMC will never play nice under the same colors.   MSG and Security Forces duties can be easily folded over to Army personnel.  Even if they were still handled by Marines, there's no overriding reason that the US Marine Corps cannot be an operational component under the US Army (or even the Department of the Army if you still want branch-level separation), realizing substantial cost savings in unifying processes, procedures, and equipment.   The MC never wanted a special unit because historically were the first in the fight, POTUS' 911. But after the towers fell and assests inside and outside SOCOM got the call it was a stab at the Marines to not be first. MSOB solved that initially by getting committed and blessed as a SOCOM unit after almost 20 years of staying true to the Corps as old Force.   Exactly.  That's why I said it was a vanity move from Rumsfeld and Hagee.  Hagee realized that the Corps's days as ""America's 911 Force"" were over and he wanted a piece of that sweet, sticky SOF pie.  And he got it.  But, I don't think it's going to help keep the Corps relevant, especially as 15 years of occupation duty in Iraq and Afghanistan doing the same job as the Army didn't do any favors in terms of differentiating ourselves.  Sooner or later, someone's going to ask the hard question -- Why do we need a Marine Corps?  Iwo Jima, dress blues, and the silent drill platoon aren't going to cut it."
USMC,3ae69z,slhayden73,0,Fri Jun 19 20:16:46 2015 UTC,"I  cant tell if you want that to happen or if youre just stating your mind. Either way,  Im going to be optimistic about it. Because if the Raiders from WWII can help sway a name for a select group of Marines, no former Marine will stand idly by as the Corps is erased. I havent seen a push for it anyway.  Actually. I just thought through a whole lot of things that this thread pulls at and it makes me mad. I dont want to think about that as a possibilty. I will not imagine a place where we can watch politicians stand on ceremony and tradition of office but consider erasing an institution that has stood since 1775. Before congress even existed in present form. As a Corpsman I wont entertain it.   Edit:""thread pulls at"" meaning the thread on a sweater."
USMC,3ae69z,dieslow0341,3,Fri Jun 19 20:34:42 2015 UTC,"You really think the Marine Corps isn't a conventional force?  The only non conventional force within the Marine Corps was Recon before MARSOC and they fall under the FMF. You are delusional and feel your ego is hurt because you're not a special butterfly.  There has always been a rift within the Corps, Grunts and POGs, and there always will be.  You think the only difference between the Army and Marine Corps was the lack of having a SOF unit, you clearly have not work with enough people from other branches.  I personally see the great things they are doing here overseas, so I don't know where you get this ""SOCOM gained nothing"" bullshit from.  The ONLY shortfall within MARSOC is the Marine Corps not letting them be an actual SOF unit led by SOF leadership, instead it feels it should infect it with POGs with no operational background in any ground combat leadership or the understanding of the Marines and culture within the command (apparently things are slowly changing).  Here's the hard truth, in today's conflicts, SOF are the first ones to be sent in, short of another full blown war, so having an entity of the Marine Corps to be utilized within SOCOM keeps the Marine Corps relevant."
USMC,3ae69z,sum-bullshit,3,Fri Jun 19 19:45:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for a great response!   You really think the Marine Corps isn't a conventional force? The only non conventional force within the Marine Corps was Recon before MARSOC and they fall under the FMF.   Of course the Corps is a conventional force.  However, the role the Corps played was unique.  It's no longer unique.   I personally see the great things they are doing here overseas, so I don't know where you get this ""SOCOM gained nothing"" bullshit from.   I'll backtrack a bit here and say I never meant to say that they weren't doing great things.  They are.  What I meant was that SOCOM gained no unique capabilities from MARSOC standing up that weren't already being fulfilled by extant SOF units.  The ongoing fight between MARSOC and USASOC in defining exactly what MARSOC's mission is is the perfect example of how that has borne out.  Yeah, things have evened out a lot in the last few years as the SOF community has grudgingly accepted MARSOC's place, but it doesn't change the original decision's merits.   Here's the hard truth, in today's conflicts, SOF are the first ones to be sent in, short of another full blown war, so having an entity of the Marine Corps to be utilized within SOCOM keeps the Marine Corps relevant.   I'll disagree here.  It keeps Marines in the fight, but a single small unit of 2500 Marines can hardly continue justifying a separate ground combat branch roughly 1/2 the size of the Army that's trained, equipped, and organized in a completely different manner to execute the same exact mission."
USMC,3ae69z,WienerColada,2,Fri Jun 19 20:07:19 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that SOCOM gained no unique capabilities from MARSOC standing up that weren't already being fulfilled by extant SOF units.   Allow me to interject and state that, whilst this is true to a degree, I believe the fact remains that the roles performed by other SOF units are not quite so clearly defined as they have previously been, and are, indeed, beginning to overlap to a significant degree. Previously, every SOF unit was specialized in something. For example, SF were THE UW and FID guys. Now, everyone's doing a ton of FID. Similarly, everyone's doing a ton of DA, CT, SR, even if it doesn't strictly fall within their specialties or primary mission set. What it's coming down to is less what the unit's specialty is, and more who's the most available at a given time.  So, while I agree that MARSOC is certainly struggling to find its place in SOCOM, I'm also not entirely sure that's as important as one would be led to believe. I think simply having the extra bodies is a boon to SOCOM, particularly in our peacetime state, and I do think it helps Marines retain the mantra of ""first to fight"", particularly following the embarrassments of the pre Afghan/Iraq invasions.   Still, I agree with your overall point that it's not the ultimate solution to the Corps overall issue of relevance and distinguishing itself from the other branches, and indeed, may hurt it in some ways. I'm not really sure refraining from the creation of MARSOC would have done much to help, either."

USMC,3ae69z,Mystrick,8,Fri Jun 19 15:34:37 2015 UTC,"True, but think about the concept of every Marine a rifleman.  It's not just going outside the wire or being in the field but the mindset.  Every Marine (with some exceptions) knows the basic fundamentals of a rifle and its use.  Having been around a deployed Army/Air Force base, you'll see the stark contrast of the mindset of a Marine and a non-combat solider/air man.  Of course there will always be exceptions.  Shitty Marines and phenomenal soldier/air men/sailors, but the concept is there."
USMC,3ae69z,slhayden73,5,Fri Jun 19 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"The first time i ever met a Marine while on active duty, I had juat graduated Corps School. I was waiting for a flight home around the holidays. This Marine  and i recognized each other as military and struck up conversation. Long story short, this self-proclaimed ""admin POG"" was telling me about the blood line on a k-bar and why its important to twist it after stabbing a bad guy.   That conversation opened my eyes. Marines are not like everyone else. Even the unit I'm with now, the 20+ year MSgts and even SgtMaj are fucking studs. The Army cats around here...they, uh. Lets just say they arent nimble on their toes."

USMC,3ae69z,commonsense23,4,Sat Jun 20 05:15:15 2015 UTC,"God thats what I was hoping you were going to say. None of that is true. The ""blood line"" is a Fuller.

USMC,3ae69z,slhayden73,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:33:42 2015 UTC,"He didn't impress me with bullshit. His passion for being a Marine, albeit a misinformed one, was what impressed me."
USMC,3ae69z,commonsense23,2,Sat Jun 20 05:38:32 2015 UTC,I have absolutely no problem with being passionate. My problem is buying into your own legend and bullshit. And its a problem the whole military has. Its why Marsoc has had SGT Majors who had no experience in the SOF community let alone the infantry representing them. Being passionate and good at your job is amazing. But being passionate and incompetent and believing you are competent is a recipe for disaster.
USMC,3ae69z,slhayden73,2,Sat Jun 20 05:48:19 2015 UTC,Well i was making a point about how Marines separate themselves. This guy was fresh to the fleet. Just like I was at the time. We all make mistakes. Learning from them is what separates us from our former selves.

He tells me ""HeroOfCanton, WTF are you doing!?"" I figured it was just his usual complaints. I turn around, dick in hand, to piss in his general direction and realize that he wasn't complaining about the tire, he was referring to the female O3 JAG that was standing right behind me. She looked me dead in the eyes, then slowly down at my dick, and then back to dead in the eyes, with the just the slightest smirk. All I could think of was that massive amount of career ending paperwork that I was about to get. I didn't say a word, buttoned up, and wanted to get out of there but NO. Fucking plt commander does a school circle right there, so Ive got no where to go, and shes on the otherside of the circle just staring at me. Like most dangerous females in the wild, I wasn't sure if she wanted to mate or to eat me. The fear was strong.

Unlike every other branch of service (except the Coast Guard who send their line officers to law school), we go through all the same training as any other Marine Officer. We have the same mindsets and are just as much ""Marines"" as anyone else.    Most of us could be making way more money doing something else, but we wanted to be Marines and get our hands dirty.

My original point was just that the idea that only 03xx sees combat is inaccurate, as evidence of the list of MOSs that I ran into out there, then /u/chimneytop reminded me of how for a second there I thought I might've ended my career in a rather humorous way.

It's similar to lasik but slightly longer recovery (instead of cutting a flap in the outer layer of the eye before the laser is used, they grind the outer layer away with a little brush that looks like an electric toothbrush, then they put a contact lens on while it heals). At the time they wouldn't do lasik (this was in 2006), but I hear that they do now."

If your eyes aren't stable, the surgery is worthless.  So you're 21; you go to the closest navy hospital and get an eye exam, and ya tell the doc you're interested in LASIK. Awesome, they say, let's set you up for an appointment. About 6 appointments dispersed over 5 months later and you get assigned a surgery date (assuming you haven't been disqualified for one of a multitude of reasons) based on what Tier you fall into (Tier I-IV) based on command discretion. Tier I gets you to the front of the line, Tier IV has a VERY LONG wait time. To even be considered for a surgery date you need to have at least 12 months left on your contract post-surgery.  At the end of all this the surgery itself takes 10 minutes and the results are like magic. Don't get your hopes up, but try your hardest to make it happen."

USMC,3ahjky,jarhead-in-germany,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:52:10 2015 UTC,"MEPS doctors are all civilians, doesn't matter what branch you're trying to enlist into. When you got disqualified from the Navy your records are still going to show when you're projected to come down and try for the Marine Corps. When they see your records they're either going to disqualify you again or probably ask for more medical documents if they don't think what you have on your 2807 should be disqualifying."
USMC,3ahjky,jarhead-in-germany,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:58:21 2015 UTC,"Every branch has slightly different standards for what is and isn't disqualifying or what does and does not require a waiver.  However, the Marine Corps is, generally, more strict than the Navy, so odds are that anything that would have disqualified you for service with the Navy will have the same issue as with the Marine Corps.  Ultimately, it will all depend on exactly what issues you had that were disqualifying and how they were resolved.  There are guidelines which state what kind of conditions are completely disqualifying, which ones aren't, and which ones can be reviewed by a medical doctor for a possible waiver.    Recruiters, in general, know their shit, so if a recruiter is telling you that you'll likely be disqualified, you probably will be.  You can ask him to still do it and he might (it's a lot of work on his end to request the waiver, just so you know), but just keep your expectations reasonable.    Also, consider talking to the Army, Air Force, and Coast Guard.  Like I said, depending on exactly what the disqualifying condition was, it may or may not be an impediment in another branch, or it may be easier to obtain the waiver.  In any case, though, it will be ""in the system"" as it's already documented and every branch will see the prior disqualification and reasons."

Why do you think being an E2 in the marines is going to be more fulfilling than what you're currently doing? Depending upon which MOS you choose life won't get better until e-5. At which point all that BAH you're getting. Nope you won't be getting that until E6.  Holy shit look into commissioning programs. Talk about 5 steps backwards.
USMC,3ae1wg,32onezero,7,Fri Jun 19 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not a recruiter and my info may be out of date, but here's what I know:  First, you won't go back to E-1.  You'll go back to PFC, or E-2.  Your time in grade will zero out, but you'll maintain your time in service for pay and promotion eligibility purposes, which will help you become eligible for promotion faster than your peers, particularly if you end up series honor grad and get lance corporal out of boot camp (and as a PO1, I'll be really disappointed in you if you don't).  Second, you won't be considered ""prior service"" to the Marines.  ""Prior service"" to the Marines means someone who is already a Marine and MOS qualified and thus will be coming back with just a break in service.  Because you'll be coming in as a contract E-2 and you'll still be going through the same training pipeline as a 18 year old high school kid (boot camp, MCT, MOS school), the recruiters should view you no differently (aside from you obviously knowing what's going on and not being a clueless idiot, of course)."

USMC,3ad76l,benjammin9292,6,Fri Jun 19 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"Typically this is determined by the local command (I've always seen it specified in the battalion/detachment Barracks Order). Most of the specifics of barracks operation are delegated to local discretion.  Typically, the CO is the only person authorized to open secured areas (locked wall lockers, ect) however he is always authorized to delegate that authority as he sees fit (I.E., if he orders a Health and Comfort, any of his agents that are searching rooms have the implicit authority to search private areas.  If someone is just trying to pull rank and may not have the CO's cooperation, it might not be a lawful order. Be aware that when a violation of orders is suspected, usually the DNCO can keep secure your room until the CO authorizes a search though, and if you have a NCO/SNCO demanding access, it's highly likely that he'll get the cooperation he needs to see in there."

USMC,3a9eod,donheart,12,Thu Jun 18 07:21:53 2015 UTC,"TLDR:     The M40 is built by Precision Weapons Section, a component of the Marine Corps that is contracted by Marine Corps Systems Command and is primarily staffed by Marine armorers. It exists solely to build and repair the Marines’ precision weapons.  Chris Sharon, a former chief sniper school instructor at Quantico, says there has been a reluctance to cut the M40 program because it could make Precision Weapons Section redundant.  “Nobody wants to be the one who kills PWS,” said Sharon, who is also a former contractor for Marine Corps Systems Command, noting that killing the rifle would significantly downsize one element of the Marine Corps."
USMC,3a9eod,JamesTBagg,5,Thu Jun 18 07:35:10 2015 UTC,"Is there any reason the Marine Corps couldn't continue making the M40 as they do now, only in a different caliber?  Guys in the field get what they want, rifle making Marines get what they want, everybody is happy."
USMC,3a9eod,Youcalled911forthat,4,Thu Jun 18 16:13:37 2015 UTC,"They could, seeing as the M40 is based on the Remington 700 which comes in a huge multitude of calibers, including .300 WinMag and .338 Lapua Magnum, which are mentioned in the article as already being in use by the U.S. Army and our allies. The Marines are the last hold out of the .308 on its long range rifles but not by choice of the Marines using them."
USMC,3a9eod,JamesTBagg,3,Thu Jun 18 18:37:14 2015 UTC,Yeah but doesn't the M-40 use the short action?   I don't think you can convert them to .300WM like the Army did with the M-24.
USMC,3a9eod,WiseGuy1020,2,Fri Jun 19 17:28:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean modifying those specific guns, I meant the PWS could continue building the guns based on the familiar M40/R700 platform. One of the biggest hurdles, according to the article was losing the Precision Weapons Section. Buy what is needed and have the PWS put them together. PWS can keep building rifles for its snipers, snipers get a bullet they want, the top brass stays happy. Should be a win-win."

I mean shit, they want to hand out $25,000 Vectors like candy, but you could revamp an entire sniper pair's kit for that much and double their range. I mean what's the margin of error on a range call for a .308 at 1000m assuming a 10"" danger space? Like 10-15m? If the guy was running towards you and you were aiming CoM, he'd run under the freaking bullet. It's really a failure on the Marine Corps to let the sniper equipment problem get to where it's gotten. In this day and age, the only problem a marksman should be having is a wind call. Teach pen and paper ballistics by all means, but without a Kestrel, a Vector, and a fucking bullet that can actually get the job done, you might as well say fuck it, shoot a round and just adjust off that for the 2nd one to be on because usually shit's just happening too fast otherwise."

USMC,3a9eod,XSVskill,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:07:18 2015 UTC,And that's why a .300 win mag or .338 lapua are so great. Especially the .338 lapua almost doubles the range.

One day a friend of mine who lived in my neighborhood knocks on my door and says ""there's some guy here that says he is a Marine and he's lost and I told him I know a Marine so I brought him to you"" so I'm like wtf, OK... And this guy walks up and introduces himself and tells me he was involved in the Haditha murders and just released from the brig, hopped on a train and somehow ended up wandering my neighborhood with nowhere to go and no idea where he's at. At first i thought he was full of it, so i pulled up my phone and googled his name and sure enough his picture was in several news sites. I ended up letting him crash at my place.

There are some good principles and techniques taught, but it is drowned out by stupid moves that will never be used on a modern battlefield.  It feels like a program that is now in place to sate the high number of goombas that join the Corps and want to pretend to be UFC fighters. My dad told me when they did LINE, it was simple, straightforward, and effective.

USMC,3a6ejy,blues_and_ribs,7,Thu Jun 18 02:23:48 2015 UTC,Be a little more specific than 'gay'.  It's meaningless?  Worthless?  Nobody takes it seriously?  I was never a fan of the program.  It could be argued that MCMAP is a huge waste of money and time that going back to the days of simplified combat line training would be just as sufficient if not more.
USMC,3a6ejy,ronerychiver,11,Wed Jun 17 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"You seem to put it more eloquently than I, but yes, worthless as in it's never used outside of training. I know I never took it seriously, especially when a command orders that everyone will be a certain belt by a certain time. Why? What skills does it impart on the individual Marine that enhance his war fighting ability, or on a unit's readiness? It's just another arbitrary requirement, or check in the box for a unit commander to look better on his fit reps."
USMC,3a6ejy,bnh35440,20,Wed Jun 17 17:28:02 2015 UTC,"We could dissect MCMAP for pages and pages on all the problems related to how it's taught, trained, etc, but really its biggest problem is that the Marine Corps does not (and imo never really did, or put much thought into) know what it wants MCMAP to be, and this aimlessness shows in how it's used. Is it a PT tool? Is it a training method to teach aggression and fighting spirit? Is it a utilitarian military combatives system? Is it a check in the box to get promotion points and haze anyone unlucky enough to get voluntold to a course? All of the above? You can have something effective that covers several of those boxes, but not all of them.  I always found it hilariously bizarre how MCMAP insisted on jamming modules on MC history and check-in-the-box training reqs into the martial arts aspect. All right gents, that covers the basic rear hand hammerfist. Now we will turn to the topic of sexual harassment and equal opportunity, then discuss the Marine Raiders.   I don't necessarily blame MCMAP for the problem of there being insufficient training time, as this is a problem with basically every military combatives system. Especially for combat arms troops there just isn't enough time, equipment, space, or instructors to teach it to any real degree of proficiency (though obvs the other issues with MCMAP just make this specific problem even worse). Everyone loves to say ""but look at the IDF and krav maga!"". Yes, but the IDF only teaches bare bones KM even to line units. They use it far more as a tool to teach determination, fighting spirit, aggression, and esprit de corps (yeah sounds weird but watching your squad mates fight through a gauntlet of dudes one by one can be pretty motivating). What I'm sure they do not do, is interrupt KM training to do half hour powerpoints on the history of their regiment and motorcycle safety. Nor do they teach it as memorizing lists of isolated techniques that get practiced twice a month.  Back when Brian Stann was still in the UFC I always wondered why the MC didn't promote the shit out of him. Chiseled jaw all American looking stud, infantry officer, Silver Star recipient, smart and well spoken, and pro cage fighter who politely talks about how MCMAP got him into martial arts? That's a recruiting video wet dream. Liz Carmouche, part of the first women's fight in UFC history, former Marine with multiple Iraq tours. Not a peep. It's like the MC didn't quite know whether they wanted to embrace it or distance themselves. And that is the issue with MCMAP in a nutshell. The MC does not really know what to do with it or how to advance it, and nobody high up seems to particularly care either, so now it's just there, faded into the background and part of the normal check in the box routine - like field day and charlie Fridays.  my 0.02 (proud greenbelt, come at me bro)"

USMC,3a6ejy,robotempire,3,Wed Jun 17 23:42:36 2015 UTC,MCMAP belts are perfect for opening beer bottles though so I guess that's something.
USMC,3a6ejy,autowikibot,2,Thu Jun 18 01:04:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome response.  If you ever have the time, check out Joe Rogan's interview with Brian Stann.    I was trying to read up on MCMAP today and the program itself doesn't seem to carry any prestige amongst civilian martial artists; like it almost lacks legitimacy.  I think in large part because of how quickly someone can advance through the belt system.  Do you think the program should just be canceled?"
USMC,3a6ejy,robotempire,8,Wed Jun 17 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"I heard that podcast. Stann is an interesting guy to say the least. ""Pussy always wins"" is now one of my life aphorisms as well.  I have only ever seen two attitudes from civilians re: mcmap = ""useless"" or ""secret USMC killing art"". You mainly hear the second one from poolee and internet toughguy types who don't know any better. As for the first, well it's pretty easy to find Marines on the internet bitching about mcmap so that shatters the illusion fairly quickly.  As to what's wrong with MCMAP, a disclaimer: I got up to greenbelt in mcmap (required, not by choice) while I was in. I now train krav maga heavily and also follow BJJ, catch wrestling, kickboxing and MMA pretty closely. I don't claim any expertise and this is simply me vomiting my opinion. I have great respect for everyone at the MACE and I am sure they're great martial artists and Marines who are simply held back by the bureaucratic institutional clusterfuck of the Marine Corps.  Belt advancement is not the issue with mcmap. Every technique within MCMAP is perfectly fine, after all they are sourced from pre-existing martial arts. The problem is that there is no cohesion or underlying principles to the system. You are just memorizing a bunch of techniques and practicing them step by step on partners standing still. Under stress, fatigue, and real conditions, any kind of skillset taught in this manner will fall apart. Take marksmanship training for example. We teach marksmanship with simple core principles: bone support, breath, natural point of aim, etc etc. Even in combat conditions, exhausted, with a weapon not zeroed to you, whatever, all you have to do is fall back on these core principles and you can effectively execute your skillset of putting shots on target.   Now imagine that instead of teaching marksmanship with principles, we taught it as a whole bunch of disjointed techniques. You had to memorize ""Standing Combat Marksmanship Stance #1-4"", ""Crouching Combat Marksmanship Pose #1-6"", ""Prone CMP Position 2"", ""Pose, Combat Marksmanship, Inverted, Night-Time, Advanced #3"", etc. Now I throw you into a livefire drill. Every time you shoot you have to think about ""what am I supposed to do here"", then properly do it, then think about what you should do next. You have no idea how one flows into the other. You have no idea what are the principles underlying everything. And once you're tired and under stress you'll probably just forget it all and start winging shit.  Same thing with MCMAP. Training a collection of techniques with no binding principles or cohesion just creates an ineffective mishmash. This isn't a videogame where you can select the right technique from your menu and do it on cue. If I watched youtube videos and memorized 20 different BJJ submissions, and practiced them in my backyard for months, then went to an actual BJJ school and grappled in person, I might catch a lucky sub or two, but I'd still get my ass kicked easily 95 times out of a 100. Why, because I don't know any of the principles. I only know a bunch of memorized techniques, I don't know how they connect to each other, how to set them up, what role they play. I don't have any of the fundamental skills that allow me to execute them in the first place. Hence where you get the common saying ""MCMAP teaches you just enough to get your ass kicked"".  A military combatives system will never make visually appealing, technically slick fighters. Again, not enough training time. Your goal should be to give troops easily remembered, gross motor techniques they can do under stress, and let other qualities such as physical fitness, aggression, and determination cover the gaps. Combatives are a desperation skillset and it's not like they're fighting trained martial artists, so you don't need great technique. That's why you'll always see internet commenters going ""LOL look at this video of MCMAP, that dude would get his ass caved in vs a ufc fighter"" and random poolees going ""STFU THAT MARINE WOULD KICK HIS ASS W/NO RULES"". They both utterly miss the point. Combatives simply exist because a) it can keep you alive in a horrible situation until your buddies with guns arrive, and b) it's a very effective way to teach controlled aggression and mental determination, which are good skills that make people more effective overall. So does MCMAP accomplish that goal? Meh. It's certainly better than nothing. A pissed off Marine who only remembers how to spam hammerfists like he's fucking Thor is still gonna do better against Ahmed Akbar than somebody with no training at all.  So no I don't think it should be cancelled, maybe some future commandant or whatnot will unfuck it, but in its current state it's much less than it could be."

USMC,3a47vk,booziwan,3,Wed Jun 17 04:28:49 2015 UTC,Been out since 1978.  At least twice a week I wake up from a dream at 03 and I just know I'm late to lead morning PT.
USMC,3a47vk,budrick007,3,Wed Jun 17 11:26:59 2015 UTC,"I've been out nearly four years now and just recently had a weird one.   It starts off with me sitting in the back of a 2-seat car with my parents, on our way to base for some sort of ceremony. I suddenly feel a sense of dread and terror as I realize I don't have my cover with me. This then cascades as I realize I haven't had a haircut, I still have my beard, and I'm not actually buckled into a seat in the car as we roll up to the gate.   It doesn't go any further than this, but it feels like hours of panicking over each one of these infractions that are meaningless to anyone in the real world.   Thankfully my wife is understanding and didn't laugh at me in the morning when I told her I had a nightmare about not having a haircut."

USMC,3a47vk,Exhortera,2,Wed Jun 17 16:18:26 2015 UTC,"Every 3 weeks or so, I have a fairly vivid boot camp dream. It usually involves my kill hat or second hat getting ready to scream at me as I'm trying to tell them I'm a Marine. No matter how much I feel like I'm shouting that I've already been here and graduated, I'm a Marine not a recruit, and then watching the rage build in their face, and then I'll wake up.  It's weird that it happens so often and regularly, especially since it's been about 7 years since I graduated boot camp, but every time I usually wake up with a few seconds of mass confusion realizing that I'm not actually on the island. The wife wants me to take it to the VA as I shouldn't be having recurring dreams from my service, but I keep thinking that that would be a pretty bitch move to make a claim for, especially about freaking boot camp.  The brainwashing is real man."

USMC,3a3aac,notatherapist,43,Tue Jun 16 21:59:30 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing I can think of is to not make them feel as if there is something wrong with them. Marines have an incredible sense of pride and the moment someone tries to say there is something wrong, they will close down and shut you out.  Just being in a therapy type situation will be incredibly uncomfortable and they'll be on edge. If they feel insincerity or that you're putting on an act (not that you would, it can just feel that way in therapy), they'll see it and you'll lose them.  For some weird reason, Marines have a touchy disposition when the word ""understand"" comes out. ""Oh, I understand what you're dealing with..."" ""The fuck you do!"" is a typical response.  I could go on and on, but just know that these walls are there to allow strong men and women the ability to not show how fragile they actually are, and how much these things have affected them. Without those types of walls we feel as if everyone can see our damage and that gets into our heads.  I'm very glad I learned and experienced all this after I got out, because I'd have been a complete mess had I delved into it while still in. Good luck and many thanks for your effort and work.  Edit: Fixed some typos due to mobile and autocorrect."
USMC,3a3aac,ferfer1313,35,Tue Jun 16 22:12:40 2015 UTC,"So first off, welcome to our odd fucked up little world. Hopefully you have a good counselor yourself, you're going to need one.  I agree with pretty much everything /u/ferfer1313 said. Dont try to hard, be careful being to broad with ""understanding"", even as it pertains to family issues, etc.  Something I've noticed while talking to various counselors over the years is that Deployment Stress is the lens through which lots of professional caregivers want to view Marines. Having a rough time at home? Tell me about your last deployment. Wife left? Lets talk about that IED. Never get to see your kids? How do you feel about this upcoming float?   I dont belittle combat stress at all, but recognize we also experience stresses that have nothing to do with deployment or being a Marine. Our relationships are shitty because we're poor communicators and have unrealistic expectations just like regular people. Dont counsel Jim the Marine, counsel Jim the dude who sucks at active listening (or whatever).  Yes, we're Marines and that makes us a little unique. But at the end of the day we're just people with awesome/shitty jobs and awesome/shitty relationships."
USMC,3a3aac,lowspeedlowdrag,6,Wed Jun 17 00:27:21 2015 UTC,"Well said, people rarely understand us unless in the fold! Kinda like combat reporters embedded with us at first treated like outsiders until they go through some shit with us, then we slowly open up and let them in."
USMC,3a3aac,md28usmc,3,Wed Jun 17 16:53:02 2015 UTC,"When I deal with my vet students, I always try to keep them laughing, because I know 7 times out of 10, the shit they're dealing with is because of a relationship. If I see a string of shitty grades and one decent grade, I usually will joke ""Is she really that hot?""   I agree with LSLD, it's not always what happened over there that's the issue. With my students I feel that if you can keep a person laughing they're still listening. So I've gotten really good at the Navy/Marine/Army banter... still working on my Air Force jokes."
USMC,3a3aac,maverickjs,6,Wed Jun 17 15:12:14 2015 UTC,The tough thing about Air Force jokes is that the Air Force is usually the punchline.
USMC,3a3aac,lowspeedlowdrag,4,Wed Jun 17 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"I usually get along with all students under my care, but twice I've had Air Force not laugh at my jokes and tell me ""It's not my fault you joined the Marines.""   Navy, I do enjoy busting their chops (unless they're corpsmen) After all... why do they wear the same uniform as Japanese school girls?"
USMC,3a3aac,maverickjs,28,Wed Jun 17 18:40:17 2015 UTC,"The other thing is Marines don't want to open up about problems because nobody wants to be the guy who can't keep his s hit together. I'm still fighting that instinct three years after getting out. If a Marine says he drinks 2-3 drinks per day a few times a week, multiply that by a factor of six for the real number. You get the idea."
USMC,3a3aac,slappyhooper,8,Tue Jun 16 22:32:03 2015 UTC,"I made the mistake of telling my psychiatrist the actual amount I drank over the previous weekend hanging out with guys from my old squadron.  74 beers over a three day weekend (72 hour liberty or '72 in military speak) is not uncommon.  She was so severely shocked that she still brings it up seven years later.  Part of the reason for rampant alcohol abuse is the stressful environment.  If the command really hates a Marine they can lose their rank, get half their (now reduced) pay docked for several months, and confined to a room with only religious and Marine Corps literature for a month for being five minutes late."
USMC,3a3aac,unusuallytallgnome,6,Wed Jun 17 02:30:06 2015 UTC,Yup. For a decent stretch I would drink a fifth of whiskey every night and pound an energy drink in the morning. I'd be dead in a week if I tried that now but it wasn't that odd then. I was considered a good Marine too.
USMC,3a3aac,slappyhooper,2,Wed Jun 17 02:54:41 2015 UTC,Lol most of my company pounds alcohol and then runs PT at 0600 in the morning as if they never had a drop. It's actually pretty impressive. I don't see how they do it. I'm only 23 but if I drink just a few drinks I can tell during PT the next day.

AKA learn ""Marine shit"". I ask a lot of questions about their jobs and careers.

Going to a place in which you know you'll get responses from Marines is a good idea, though you have to understand some sources are going to be better than others and some people will just troll. If you can and will sift through that to better assist yourself assisting others, then they just might be up to the task of dealing with a cultural group/fraternity that is wildly mythologized in society at large, and lives up to an even more crazily mythologized ancestry daily.

USMC,3a1ajf,lowspeedlowdrag,10,Tue Jun 16 19:35:21 2015 UTC,"It's all a matter of fundamentals. We shoot table one to build basic fundamental proficiency with the rifle. Some would argue (I usually fall into this group myself), that table one should be completely non-tactical. Iron sights, the Division Match/CMP course of fire, etc.   The counter argument is exactly what you said. ""...what fucking good does shooting with iron sights at the range and then using an RCO in combat do a Marine? None.""  I disagree with you. Here's why.  Aside from the fact that if the extent of your tactical rifle training is Table One and Table Two, and you find yourself in a no-shit, bullets travelling both directions gunfight, you're probably going to have a bad time. I would never argue that we should shoot irons and only irons. But the fundamentals should be built on irons, sight alignment, sight picture, windage and elevation calls, etc. Only once those fundamentals are solid should a shooter transition (with more classes and more shooting) to an optic. Introduce tactical shooting considerations (positions, unknown distances, etc) along with the optic.   The reason my fantasy will never happen isnt because the Gunners think it's a bad idea, its because of money. Nobody wants to spend the money to make sure every Admin dude or Helpdesk dude is actually fundamentally and tactically solid with the rifle, to make those Marines Riflemen. So we halfass fundamentals and we halfass tactical manipulation and call it good enough."
USMC,3a1ajf,holyhellsteve,5,Wed Jun 17 00:51:21 2015 UTC,I'll agree with you on a lot of that. Good points.

Not because they weren't given any instruction on how to use them, but because they tossed all of their fundamentals out the window. I don't care if you have a 30x scope, you won't hit the paper from 500 yards without proper fundamentals, and that will carry over into a combat scenario.   But yeah, give them the fundamentals they need in boot camp, because that's what boot camp is for, then expand upon those skills in the fleet as needed"
USMC,3a1ajf,Angry_Caveman_Lawyer,2,Sat Jun 20 13:44:02 2015 UTC,"Nah, you're right, 100%.  You should absolutely train like you were going into combat.

USMC,3a1ajf,CaptObvius,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:39:51 2015 UTC,My guess is the same reason Marines are constantly qualling on KD ranges. What does that have to do with combat?  It apparently helps people when they don't know distances though.  Could be the same with iron sights.

I worked at Horno Range in '09 and due to the quality of the shooting positions which were pretty much just gravel, we suggested that people use padding in their cammies. Also, I used padding every time I went to the range from '09 on because I messed up my knee the beginning of that year and flopping down for the rapid fire was just a bad idea"

USMC,3a1ajf,budrick007,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"Training with just one is already time consuming.  There's literally an entire week dedicated to just sitting in classroom learning how to use whatever sight you have, and then laying in the ground practicing your sighting-in.    You already pull guys out of their jobs for two weeks to qual.  Taking any more in order to get quality training on both systems would be challenging."
USMC,3a1ajf,Boner-Death,2,Tue Jun 16 18:05:00 2015 UTC,"There are two  different discussions here.    First is the ""padding"" of the firing lines at some ranges.  - In some  environments, it is more cost effective to put down a composite rubber material on the firing line and recondition it once every five years than to recondition a dirt firing line every year.  Although the rubber composite seems softer, it ain't.  It does absorb recoil better  though.  Second is the use of  RCO (Ranged Combat Optics) vs iron sights.  - The RCO is a more flexible aiming system, and works better in low light and the dark.  Because it is best to train with what will be used in the field, train with the RCO.  I would have loved a RCO on my Matty.  PS.  New Corps just means better equipped.  Ignore us old farts and our bitching.  We are really envious of some of the new equipment today's Marines carry."

You tell the kid to stfu about whatever it is that they disclosed to you not only at MEPS but also at the moment of truth in boot camp. You are telling the kid to lie to get in all the while throwing that honor courage and comittment out the window. Let's be real most kids have tried weed and add meds are overprescribed, but When you make the call like that you are risking putting a junkie or nutcase on the line who could get other Marines dead. All that may be moot in my opinion since the economy is shit and you are likely competing the airforce for Eagle Scout high school quarterbacks who walk in the door. In my day it was tattooed Ritalin kids with youth paraphanalia charges walking in. No one contract is worth your career. Dropping 5 a month to get a centurian award won't mean shit when a weak minded fraud contract drops your name when shit gets tough in bootcamp. ""This recruit refuses to train. Sgt. reddit told me to not disclose my back surgery and depression med prescriptions"". Better to roll a donut and take that hit than to force a dirty contract down to make mission. Tldr don't have kids lie to get a contract. Can come back to bite you."

I had a sinking feeling that if I'd have stayed in, they would have nabbed me for recruiting duty (4 year Sergeant, fresh contract, etc). Thank Odin I got out.

Just do well in your college courses before applying so nobody in your chain has any reservations about your academic abilities when they're endorsing it.
USMC,39z17c,blacklistbooter,2,Tue Jun 16 02:21:43 2015 UTC,I'm a career planner who has helped a couple marines with their packages. This is the correct answer. Ignore the MCO. It's extremely outdated.

OP, just go talk to your career planner and let him know your interested.  Edit: are you thinking of E to WO? I think you need at least Sgt and a hash mark to apply for WO"
USMC,39z17c,RascalMultitude,3,Tue Jun 16 00:19:40 2015 UTC,I believe WO is 8 years.
USMC,39z17c,slaughter5500,3,Tue Jun 16 00:40:15 2015 UTC,Yes it is. The order is outdated. This is one reason why MARADMINS exist; to provide amplification or changes to orders without rewriting the order. 098/15 came out in April and states that Sgt is the requirement.

USMC,39z17c,FlyHerk,3,Thu Jun 18 06:27:40 2015 UTC,"MECEPer here,  I included high school placement as it is req'd on one of the application forms. I also had my high school and college transcripts sent directly from each institution to my OIC for placement into my package.   NOTE: The transcripts SHOULD REMAIN in the sealed envelope for the entire time you have possession of your package. Submit your entire package and keep the envelopes sealed. When the board receives your package, they will open the envelopes if they choose to do so; the envelopes are sealed and stamped by the institutions to verify that they are original and have not been tampered with.  Tips for your package:   Start going to college now. American Military University is free for you as long as you utilize TA. The Marine Corps doesn't give two fucks what your major is, however, your essay should reflect some bullshit about how your major will help you lead Marines and an ossifer. Community Service- This is highly looked upon by the board. Get involved with the local community and continue to pull in and document those hours.  The essay you write for your package is a big portion of it. It shows the board that you have a gooder brain than the filthy E-Swine and that you know how to talk good two.  Start networking with Marine officers now. This sounds cheesy and brown-noserish, but establishment of a good report with officers (I should add: senior Captains and above, because the board doesn't care what a boot ass Captain or Lt says about you) based on your work ethic will guarantee you solid letters of recommendation when the time comes. Let them know NOW that you want to apply for MECEP in the future.  If you don't get selected your first time around, keep applying. Call the number for the MGuns listed on the selection results MARADMIN and have him tell you why you're a fucktard and your package sucked so bad that you didn't get selected. The more you apply, the better chance you have at being selected.   Good Luck."

You are probably going to see some serious fat bodies. Like Army hamburglar fat. You will see a Corporal who can't do 3 pull ups but he will lie on his PFT anyways. You will see a guy  who doesn't look like he gives a shit about the corps at all.  There will also be the ""I want to pretend I am/was good enough for active duty"" motards. You can put him in his place if he gets too annoying.  And then there will be you. Don't stress too much about those guys, they will either find an excuse not to be deployed or they will surprise you when ya'll get deployed. That hamburglar might be the best machine gunner in weapons platoon. And that motard might fold up the second you give him responsibility.   If you join up, relax. Don't treat us like ignorant reservist POS's. That no pull up motherfucker might be an electrician in the real world. He might be studying nuclear physics and joined the Marine Corps because he was bored.  And just because I'm sure someone will make a comment about it. I was a motard until an former active duty Marine took me under his wing. We're best (no homo) bros now.  **Edit Also, bring a pair of clippers with you. There will probably be 1 or 2 people every month who ""forgot"" to get a haircut.  And then there will be that one chain smoking 40 year old staff sergeant that gets a sub 18 on his run."

I don't know how other units run it, but ours runs usually 3 days per weekend sometimes 4.   Unit sizes are shrinking due to budgets as well.   The good:  It is chiller mentality wise. People aren't screaming all the time at someone for the littlest infraction. Sometimes you get spoken to like people...  Age: Most people are older. This basically means more maturity among everyone. Which means less BS.  Educated: So many guys are getting degrees of all kinds in the reserves. I know a few in my platoon alone getting master's or law degrees as well. This also has the effect of officers not lording over everyone as much. A guy can't feel high and mighty for having a Bachelors of Business when guys under him are getting master's/Doctorates in tougher majors.

We did get some 240 belts and everyone got like 25 rounds on the machine gun.... once. in. two. years.    I became very disenfranchised and wound up eventually skipping drill and getting OTHD'd...

Unit was fucked, serious case of hurry up and now we don't know what the fuck we're doing. I was an FO in the Fleet and they, being a support element, didn't have that billet. I mostly just drove a Humvee around, running notes and shit. I was hating life when the Corps closed that unit (well, they actually moved it to the other side of the country) and I got to transfer to an Artillery Unit. The Battery had my MOS, so fuck yeah, and those guys were hard as nails. I was loving life again, unit I f'd up and went to OCS."

One lost a few dudes, one lost many. The one that lost a few dudes was breaking down one night. Drunk, angry, crying, contemplating the six rounds in his revolver and which one he wanted to eat.  It probably wasn't the right thing for me to do, looking back, but I was able to get him in touch with the friend who had lost many Marines in about five minutes. Explained the situation, passed phone numbers around, and let 'em talk about it.  He made it through the night and stopped drinking after it was all said and done. I know that I couldn't have possibly helped him get to that place since I haven't been in combat and haven't lost any brothers or sisters.  Perhaps give that a shot."

Since I normally ate at the battalion chow hall, I would sometimes get that feeling that I had to take a dump come on while I was jogging. Usually, it would go away after a few minutes and I would make it back. One time I didn't make it.  This time, I had run a few miles and the feeling came on, so I ignored it and kept going. The feeling kept coming back. Eventually, as I was running down Julian C. Smith St., I decided I wasn't going to make it. My first thought was to run into another Regimental HQ or barracks to relieve the pressure. But that seemed too embarrassing. I kept on jogging.  Then I felt like farting and pushed it out. Big mistake. It was a wet fart. I knew I wouldn't make it back to the barracks and didn't want to be seen by anybody. I ran into the trees at the side of the road and exploded onto one of the bushes. Unfortunately, I shat all over my PT shorts and skivvies too.  I didn't see anything around I could use to clean up, so I left the skivvies and washed myself and my shorts in New River. Then put on the wet shorts commando style and kinda flopped the rest of the way to the barracks."

With minor exceptions, the  answer is the later option.    With that established, the weapon must fit the mission.

USMC,39tqce,eggheadbythedozen,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:53:44 2015 UTC,"Because the variables affecting accuracy increase as range increases.  At extreme ranges,  even the spin of the earth affects the shot.  So the longer the shot, the more chance that momma nature will flick the bullet one way or another and the greater chance for a miss.     Just remember that the longest recorded successful shot took 4 tries before the target was hit, and the shot was not able to be duplicated by the best snipers the military could supply.    Finally, since greater range increases the chance of a miss, it increases the chance for exposing the sniper to discovery.   Sure, lets swap range for accuracy.  Misses don't help the  enemy at all."

Afterall, you're all about those dicks and I doubt your girlfriend felt adequate and satisfied when all you really wanted was something long a hard inside you.

Show up with a good haircut. Make an appropriate first impression because it's the only shot you're gonna get and being labelled a shitbag right out the gate is literally the last thing you want as a new Marine in a new command. Once you get a little more established, feel out the attitude of your NCOs, SNCOs and whatnot. If it's a setting where a medium reg will fly, then do it. If it's not? Then don't. It's seriously not worth fucking yourself over because 'you really don't feel like it'.  Edit: Fuckit, go Low Reg and impress them with the size of your giant balls.

What I do see however is two people who are happy and content with each other, enough to spend their lives together. Marines for the most part have never had a problem with gays. It was the ones way high up in command who couldn't stomach the idea of gays being in the military so they have to pass laws to make it so that they can pretend like there aren't any. DADT got repealed and the only thing that happened was more people got roughed up for harassing gay service members. It's bullshit that a bunch of the civilian populace thinks the military is anti gay and that we are all homophobes."

Shot two points higher, still hammered as fuck and sweating nothing but ethanol, 277 I think might have been 377 it's been almost 20 years I honestly don't remember the scoring of the pistol range because it was so under-utilized, than expert and when I got back every SNCO asked me how I did and flinched in disgust that I was now the only pistol expert with a fourth award rocker.

Get on target and squeeze, the target pullers loved me because I was done with the ten round 250 yard sequence in about two minutes. The coffee got me all shaky and second guessing myself and while I went into the second round tied for third, I failed miserably.

DI's confiscated the foodstuffs and let the kid keep the pictures. Right before the kid walked off, the DI snatched the box back out of his hands and said ""not so fast Recruit Ziya"" as he stripped out the false bottom of the box and revealed several mini packs of oreos (the kind that have 6 cookies each)  Ziya was then told to stack them in little rows, and he had to push up and down to eat one cookie at a time. He had to eat 12 packs of oreos before free time was over.  Another kid (recruit evans) was sent a box of one dozen neiman marcus white chocolate macadamia cookies in first phase. Return address on the box was Retired Master Gunnery Sergeant whatshisname, the kid's neighbor. Last week of boot camp (9 weeks later), the DIs called up evans and posted him by the duty hut. they gave him one canteen and he had to take a cookie, stuff the entire thing in his mouth, then shout at the top of his lungs ""THANK YOU MASTER GUNS"" with crumbs flying everywhere. again, this recruit had to eat the entire package before the end of free time.  If you want to mess with your friend, send pics of them as a civilian doing stupid shit. You know, the kind of stuff that gives them mockery ammo. Douse the box in men's cologne and lisa frank stickers. write ""we love our soldier"" on the outside of the box. Print a banner that says ""First Class Privates"" and include zip ties so the DI's can stick it to their rack (or velcro straps so they can be used repeatedly)  And if you want to have some real fun, include a smaller envelope in the box addressed privately to the DIs pleading them to ""go easy on her"" and talking about how she ""proudly walked around telling everyone she was a Marine the day she signed the contract""."

How about the unapparent reason for having a base in Japan in this time, beyond a proximity to Russia and China?  How about the fact that the base takes up around 16% of mainland Okinawa, a decent amount of that being beach front, tropical property which has proven itself to be a cash-cow for the local communities, far greater than an army base?  The average income to Okinawa per 1sq. KM of base land is 900M Yen, where as the recently returned land that was turned into shopping complexes has been pumping out about 1.6B Yen per sq. KM.  Source: 2010, a panel assembled by then-Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima,    The panel, chaired by Tomikawa, found the productivity of an average land lot in Okinawa was ¥1.6 billion per square kilometer, while that of 1 sq. km of land on a base came to only ¥900 million.  “Bases . . . are curbing the economic productivity of the prefecture and distorting use of land,” the report concluded."
USMC,39o4zz,Torinn88,5,Sun Jun 14 10:38:44 2015 UTC,"The rape of underage girls.   Gonna need a source for that.

Source?  And that second part doesn't have anything to do with anything.    How about the unapparent reason for having a base in Japan in this time, beyond a proximity to Russia and China?   Proximity is a pretty strong reason. Being able to respond rapidly to threats is paramount to a nation such as China. If you've been reading on the news (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/27/china-aggressively-expanding-into-south-china-sea-says-us) China has been aggressively expanding into the south china sea. Okinawa is pretty close to there.    How about the fact that the base takes up around 16% of mainland Okinawa, a decent amount of that being beach front, tropical property which has proven itself to be a cash-cow for the local communities, far greater than an army base? The average income to Okinawa per 1sq. KM of base land is 900M Yen, where as the recently returned land that was turned into shopping complexes has been pumping out about 1.6B Yen per sq. KM.   Sure, I'll take this statistic at face value as you provided a source and I'm humoring you. So are you saying the U.S. should give up their military bases in Okinawa just because it might help improve the local economies? You do realize we are there as a show of force and are in cooperation with mainland Japan? You realize we're not friends with China nor is Japan?   Your arguments are weak."

USMC,39irg8,boadcow,21,Fri Jun 12 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"Had a guy in my unit CSSC 147 in 2003 he was my room mate in the barracks. 14 area in Pendleton, got out of going to Iraq by getting multiple pointless surgeries done (mole removed from top of his head, and broke his pinky not sure if on purpose or not). Proceeds to get pain pills for his pointless surgery (percocets). As being my room mate, I find him crushing the pills and snorting them in the fucking room. Not one to wanna rat a guy out, I don't say shit about it (plus who would believe me, he had a prescription for them). Pass by month later (I was an 18 year old farm boy from bum fuck Ohio that only ever saw weed in my life to that point) I get a Major, Company Gunny, and my platoon Sgt kicking my fucking door one day after work (dip shit no where to be found) asking me what drugs dipshit was on. Me being the naive fuck I was  just stutters over my own fucking tongue because I don't know what anything even looks like. Cocaine? Fuck might as well be powdered sugar or Anthrax for all I know.  Anyway turns out fuck nuts popped on a piss test for about a half a dozen prescription drugs, coke, heroin, meth, weed, and a bunch of other shit. Even full well knowing he was gonna be on the next drug test after coming off prescription drugs. Fucker spent some time in the brig last I heard for some other shit.   LCpl Cyphers you are a dumb cunt."
USMC,39irg8,Shotgunjack1880,3,Fri Jun 12 02:52:18 2015 UTC,"Wow someone who did cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and 6 prescription drugs in a month and didn't overdose. Those prescription drugs probably included ampethamine-like substances (Ritalin, Vyvanse) and synthetic opiates, obviously, since he was prescribed oxycodone, and benzodiazepines. Unless he just liked sticking himself with Haldol for fun. Methamphetamine and cocaine use like that usually results in psychosis, especially since those two drugs take about 3 days to exit your urine.  Just saying man, I know you mentioned you haven't seen anything but weed so you might not know, but I've dealt with plenty of drug users and medications."
USMC,39irg8,cardboardbox92,3,Fri Jun 12 16:46:59 2015 UTC,Well I only had seen him snorting the script pills. I never saw any other of the drugs he popped on. Apparently him and two of the shitty WM's from our unit all popped on something or another.
USMC,39irg8,Shotgunjack1880,2,Fri Jun 12 17:17:16 2015 UTC,It's alright. I just don't want people thinking that is possible without seriously fucking your mind up or dying. I'm going to assume he used alcohol also. Alcohol & cocaine along with alcohol & opiates (especially heroin) are extremely dangerous and can kill you. Alcohol and pain pills is how my mother passed away in 2013.
USMC,39irg8,cardboardbox92,37,Fri Jun 12 22:32:17 2015 UTC,"Had a guy go down during Desert Shield/Storm. He was an 03 assigned to company admin. Was the Gunny's bitch essentially.  One hot day he steps out of the hummer he had been driving for the last month, walked two steps, walked 5 more wobbly steps and passed out. Flat in the sand.  Turns out he was dehydrated. He hadn't been drinking water.  Why weren't you drinking water?-The 1stSgt asked him as he lay in the back of a hummer ambulance with a line plugged into his for rehydration. "" Well with all the work I was doing for the Gunny, I didn't have time to get to the water bull to refill my canteens.""  ""YOU FUCKIN' IDIOT!

Drove him back to Lejeune and posted fire watch on his room.  I was on duty at the time (pretty much permanently since I turned in my gear early due to terminal leave approaching in about a week) so he was my responsibility.  Lt. told me not to fuck with him and let him get some sleep.  So I had boots waking him up every 15 minutes to ask if he was asleep.  Next day I get relieved and everyone is prepping to go out in the field.  SSgt. we called WIGH (always talked about ""When I Got Hit"" when he took some shrapnel to the finger...)  took over watch.

USMC,39irg8,ChanceTheDog,18,Fri Jun 12 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"We had a guy who seemed pretty smart and responsible, but apparently not very observant. He is on post in Pleasureneck one day, and a couple of us are at our little prison gym (lovingly called the ""Thunderdome""). Suddenly we hear a 4-5 round burst from the 240B, followed by another 2-3 round burst. Assuming that something is popping off, but not hearing a damn thing over the blackgear, we throw our shit on real quick and head over to investigate.  One of the other Marines goes up inside the post to check out whats going on, only to find this guy sitting in the corner of the post with his head in his hands, completely out of it, and mumbling about how he had just fucked up.  Turns out this guy (an NCO) got bored and decided to perform a functions check on the 240B with rounds still on the feed tray. After he pulled the trigger the first time, he said that he freaked out and pulled it again because he didnt know what else to do. He had the T&E set on a footpath that locals used every day to walk from a tent outside the wire to the pedestrian search area.  Locals were freaked out but nobody got shot.  He became a LCpl.

USMC,39irg8,gooch1,10,Fri Jun 12 03:56:55 2015 UTC,Some guy on ammo watch at Haditha dam was fiddling with a grenade once and managed to let the spoon fly.

Goddamn stellar.
USMC,39irg8,cpm67,10,Fri Jun 12 08:27:32 2015 UTC,"My platoon picked up a rock when we went to the range at PI.  He had failed the previous week, so got to try again.  First fuck-up: when given rounds, he loaded them in his magazines backwards.  Then when he went to insert a magazine into his rifle, he realized that the rounds were pointing at him.  Solution: attempt to insert magazine into rifle backwards.  Somehow he made it fit, but then when he released the bolt things (obviously) jammed.  His frantically pulling and releasing the charging handle, along with his not firing on the target like everyone else, attracted attention - which led to him doing ditch diggers for most of the afternoon.  The very next day he actually manages to get a couple of rounds off, but they were sailing over the target.  He is ordered to fix his sights, says he can't because ""it's stuck"".  Our junior DI pulls him off the line - Private Numbnuts had screwed his front sight all the way down to bottom.  Our DI couldn't even figure out how to push the release pin in to unscrew the sight and raise it.    DI says ""did you do this yourself?""  Private Numbnuts ""Nope"" - not ""No sir"". ""Nope""  ""Nope, huh?  Well who helped you?""  ""Chapel""  This would be Senior Drill Instructor GySgt Chapel....  DI:  ""Chapel?""  Numbnuts ""Yup.""  DI: ""Hey Gunny!""  SDI: ""What's up buddy?""  DI: ""Your drinking buddy here says you helped him with his sights?""  SDI: ""My what?""  DI: ""I asked him who helped him break his sights, and he said 'Chapel', I figured you two were drinking buddies.""  SDI takes off his DI's cover, folds it in half, throws it on the ground and steps on it.  He takes off his SDI belt and throws it.  We, all of us including the junior DI, have clambered under the benches for cover.  Gunny Chapel is coming for blood while Private Numbnuts just stands there looking at him.  Fortunately Gunny Chapel catches himself, stops short, and says ""Sgt. Martin?""  (Peeking out from under the bench) ""yes, Gunny?""  ""I want you... to take this private... over there (pointing behind the benches)... and dig him until his heart bursts.""  (relieved DI) ""OK Gunny!""  sadly, Private Numbnuts had a strong heart, doubtless built up from doing ditch diggers for a solid three months.  He did not expire that day, or the next, failed the range again and we left him there for the next series to deal with."

This guy was such a pain in the ass to the chain of command that even our BC was starting to question how this kid passed bootcamp.   3 days before getting moved to 3/1 in Horno from SOI his ITB instructor, who was a former 3/1 Marine, drove by the barracks and informed his old platoon to do everything they can to make sure Pvt. C does not end up in their platoon or the company for that matter. Just our luck he ended up in our company. This Pvt. is literally a kid. He does not understand the concept of the military or being an adult.   Some of the things Pvt. C has done   After he was informed by the Company CO they did not trust him enough to go on liberty in Thailand he threw a hissy fit and stomped towards the CO and SHOULDER CHECKED HIM. Every single SNCO in the company lost their God damn minds. The CO, understanding that Pvt. C literally has the mind of a 4 year old, shrugged it off and calmly asked..""Hey..what's wrong there Pvt. C?"" This retard bought a car in oceanside. You might think, ""oh any fucking bootfuck marine has done that!"" Pvt. C does not own a driver's license nor does he know how to operate any sort of vehicle. Went on post-deployment leave. Ran out of money and did not have enough money to buy a plane ticket home. Retard technically would have been a deserter, but our 1st Sgt. was nice enough to do everything in his power to give him free leave so he does not end up being one. He checked in at the CP 40+ days later with no haircut, no shave, in civvies.  Has not been able to qual at the rifle range because this fucking kid sucked.

USMC,39lpbf,truevindication,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"i have one. it's just 4.2 because I didn't meet marine corps standards for graduation. i wouldn't call it a waste either. in turn i prepared the mat marines for their arabic classes, and i teach a couple marines basic arabic here now."
USMC,39lpbf,DasJuden63,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"I meant a proficient score enough to do the job they sent you to school for. And Rosetta Stone can teach people Arabic, so unless you can reteach yourself with said program and qualify then yeah, it was kind of a waste (of the Marine Corps' time/dime, not yours, just to clarify)."

When I was active duty, they basically expected that less than 20% of the Marines they sent to the school would actually make it through, with the rest re-classing.  Dunno if the fail rates are still that high, but basically they just toss Marines at the linguist wall until a few stick and shrug off the ones that don't.  In the fleet, I actually had a Marine check into my unit -- he'd flunked out of Korean, but instead of making him leave they put him into an easier language (don't remember which), he flunked out of that one, then got sent to radio technician school.  To top it off, he enlisted with only a four year contract, so when he finally made it to the fleet, he only had a year in service left.  The unit FAPed him off to the base to be a driver or some shit, I think we saw him for all of two weeks."

Also you'll learn your job a lot better in the fleet as a lance then a corporal because they will have you doing all of the bitch work. And knowing your job is the biggest thing. Good luck though.

Typical garrison bullshit, cleaning till 0200, police call in full PPE while shortimers simulated IDF with beer bottles, bathroom pt with gas masks, etc. each unit is different and I think it made us harder for it.

You're probably giving off douche vibes that the others are picking up. If socializing isn't your thing and you're worried about ""falling into a hole of complacency"" then use your free time to better yourself. Do some extra PT, get as many MCIs done as you can, take some college classes if your command allows it. Basically, just look at the promotion criteria and start shooting to make your score as high as possible. Try not to be the weird guy. Depending on how small your MOS is, that reputation will follow you."

I'll give you advice that I wish had been given to me when I was at MCCES:   Stay away from the female Marines. It is not freaking worth it to get into some relationship drama bullshit when you haven't even started your time in the fleet yet. You got good habits from boot camp, maintain them. Start lifting and PTing, even if the school PTs you guys in the morning. Improve yourself to make it easier when you get to your unit. It will pay off. Save your money. Do not buy dumb shit. Buy only what you need and what you can take with you when you leave. Once you reach the fleet you can spend a little, but it is retarded to buy anything significant while you are still in school. Identify terds and stay away from them. You will see guys get NJP'd for doing retarded shit. Do not be around them when they do. Avoid these people like the plague as it is the easiest way to start your time off in the Corps on an awful note.  Learn. You'll likely not truly learn your job until you get to the fleet, but as of right now you only know how to clean, shoot, hump, go to the field, and PT. Those skills aren't that valuable unless you're a grunt and you can do them really well. Being good at your job will greatly help you get promoted."
USMC,39dbt1,Craziik,11,Thu Jun 11 00:50:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is the best answer, don't talk shit about the dudes getting it on with the females. NJP's will start to fly. it's not your job to give a shit right now. Just learn your MOS and PT is semi important just so when some fat ass Sergeant is giving you shit later you can run circles around him when it's time to CFT/PFT. The best way to not get shit on in the fleet as a lance is to kill fitness tests and know your MOS well. Graduate high in your class and save the fuck out of your money. I got out of MOS school with something close to 6 grand. It's not about comparing yourself to the people around you, you're personally preparing for your future career. Shit will get sorted out later. Oh and about feeling anxious about being on your own, the fucks will start to go away steadily and turn into hate for the Corps until you're so fucking mad and psychopathic that they promote you to Corporal.

Most likely you'll get away with it though. If you're spending a few days in the field invest in a small solar charger for your ipod and phone. Other than that the store has all your needs plus WiFi in the laundry mat and warrior's club.   I serves with the Royal Marines on the HMS Ark Royal and you guys are the shit.

If guys will trade their gear it's because they bought it themselves.   Honestly never heard of a ubac shirt. Guys will barter for about anything. My advice would to try to trade something for a psp or mobile game device that has WiFi and goes on the Internet to touch base back home. When you're about to leave trade again for something else. You'll most likely leave with a full uniform and personal gear. For some reason you brits loved our flip flops. I traded a pair for a knife and beret on ship.

USMC,39c132,TooPureToDie,2,Wed Jun 10 23:44:56 2015 UTC,"Can be risky for return flights since there aren't any set-in-stone return schedules/destinations or guaranteed spots. If there's some space available, then you are good to go. If not, you might be eating a HUGE expense in getting a last minute civilian flight back to base so that you aren't counted as UA.  If you are traveling alone, it is easier to get the seat. My Gunny had issues with trying to get his family of 5 on Space A and he ended up spending more than $10,000.00 on last minute civilian flights from Guam back to Oki. He was bitter and pissed about it.  I saw some Space A flights that I was thinking about taking to England once. However, I then thought to myself: ""Too risky!"""

USMC,39dp9j,Tssusmc,2,Thu Jun 11 02:10:40 2015 UTC,"Understood that officers are not technicians. I'm not looking to turn wrenches (not that I am above it or would mind it...spend most weekends doing it). My understanding is that the platoon commander for a LAR platoon is also the vehicle commander of one of the vehicles (that's what I meant in regards to ""working with""...in/on/around...operating in the vehicle). The posting I saw for reserves LAR platoon commander was an O-2 listing.   That said...would still like to hear some experiences from officer or enlisted that are LAV-25 crewmen."
USMC,39dp9j,Tssusmc,4,Thu Jun 11 03:58:57 2015 UTC,"Yes you would be a VC. And your driver and gunner are BOTH going to have more experience that you. They will likely have worked together for at least a couple years. They won't need you. Your plt Sgt will also VC a Vic. He won't need you either.   Someday you will be a Capt. You'll have a company. Your ops chief won't need you.   Look, I read your OP. The way it reads is like someone wanting an enlisted life. But not realizing how bad it sucks.   It doesn't read like an officer to be. Sorry bud."

USMC,39cdqh,thegoldfishes,16,Wed Jun 10 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Your willingness to move will help determine what MOS you get as a reservist, and if you pick back home and all they need are 03's, 06's, and 04's, that's what you get to pick from.   They are skirting this answer because they don't want to crush your hopes and dreams. The straight answer is you'll get whatever the fuck the Marine Corps needs at your future reserve unit. That will probably be a high density MOS like 03 or 06.  A special note on intel, you have no idea what the job actually is. Everyone wants ""intel"" at TBS because everyone has no idea what they actually fucking do. Ground intel, you're not a spy, you turn big ass reports into powerpoint presentations and brief them. Also, the IOC requirement is going away. Don't quote me on that, but a source I trust implicitly tells me ground intel will no longer be attending IOC in the near future. If you get Sigint you'll spend a lot of time working with 3 letter agencies doing computer shit, NOT movie shit. You are an analyst. It is not sexy. One of my best friends did 12 years in Sigint and he is great at World of Warcraft and making food on hotplates. I have no idea what Airint does because it's the wing and who knows what they do.

Now of course it wasn't a real question and he sure as hell didn't want a answer out of us, but my stupid ass. I yelled out ""Pancakes Sir!"", and everything stopped. He jumped off the footlocker and walks through the platoon towards me, big fucking grin on his face.   Stops right in front of me and quitely says ""Pancakes uh?"" Taps his foot a few times, and swivels his head around looking at the other recruits, turns back to me with a bigger fucking grin.

Constantly getting the whole flight (platoon) in trouble.  This was definitely one of the dumbest human beings on the planet.  But he had one thing going for him -  The largest, most intimidating, veiny black cock you ever saw.  Now, the fact that he had such a giant black cock was especially odd given the fact he was WHITE!  Not half white, WHITE.  But this thing was a black thing of terror and majesty.  And every time we showered, every man was doing his best to keep his eyes off it, but there is was, the Cthulhu of cocks!  But how do you mention this?  Homophobia is still a thing, 10 years ago it was a much bigger thing!  Awkwardly, everyone avoids talking about the elephant (cock) in the room.  For weeks and weeks.  Finally, we're at the end, and he's somehow going to graduate.  The DI or whatever they call them is doing the classic open up to the airmen at the end, and he's giving airman dumbass the riot act for all his fuckups.  Finally, one of the newly minted airmen says, well, at least he's got a huge cock going for him.  Everyone is like YES! THANK YOU FOR SAYING IT!  FINALLY!  The dumbass is embarrassed as hell, but he's like, yeah, I guess I got that going for me.

USMC,397n9k,This-is-Actual,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:21:32 2015 UTC,"While training one of the Recruits in my platoon suffered from heat exhaustion. In order to make sure no one else in the platoon would suffer a similar fate, they had us drink canteen after canteen after canteen of water. We were in the barracks, standing on the line. As we finished we had to hold the empty canteen over our heads until everyone else in the platoon had finished. Once everyone had an empty canteen over their head, the had us run to the head to refill, then run back and repeat the process. We'd done this about six or seven times and a lot of the smaller guys were beginning to have trouble, when out of the corner of my eye I detected a movement, followed by a splash. Suddenly it became a full on barf-o-rama. It was as if the first guy barfing gave everyone else permission to do so. You know the wave they do at stadiums? That's how the barfing swept through the barracks. Out of nowhere, the guy to my right sprints off the line towards the head, which also took him in the direction of the door. Drill Instructor Sgt Poppadich looked like he was going to kill this Recruit, I guess, assuming he was trying to make a break for freedom. The whole scene was chaos. Well, in mid sprint this kid barfs projectile water barf and slips on the tile floor. In an instant DI Sgt Poppadich goes from murder mode, to an uncharacteristic break in character and cracks a smile. He thinks it so funny, he has to retreat to the DI house (which is s little office / room the DIs hang out in. I can hear yelling from inside the house, I assume was Sgt Poppadich retelling what he'd just seen, then I see the blinds open and DI SSgt Lichenberger peeks out at the Recruit, who is struggling to get to his feet, soaked in vomit. The blinds snap shut and a few minutes later DI Sgt Poppadich comes back out and it was business as usual. I'm certain I was the only Recruit that witnessed the entire scene from this perspective."

Turns out our CO and XO had basically did the same thing.  Day after I'm on duty, I'm chilling in my barracks room with the door open playing Mechwarrior on my PC (I had a full on HOTAS rig) talking to the other guys on my team over a headset. We ball-stomp the other team, and I look up and nearly shit myself as the CO is standing there with the damn base commander (I didn't hear them as I had been wearing a full headset). I'm scambling to get to attention and he says ""At ease""  Here, they were walking by and the base CG wanted to compliment the unit on the job we did on the deployment, the CO had told him about my volunteering, and they figured ""hey lets go tell that Devil good job"".

I like to remain on the tech side, but it is very nice to know where all of the policies come from and if your in an institution that allows you to enforce those than it can be good. Overall though it is for a very special type of person and its not me, not at this point in time.

The article says "" though it happens among the brig's prisoners, he said."" This is the truth, I know many fellow brig guards that have had to intervene to prevent a prisoner trying to harm themselves.  I also want to take on that It might not have only been the money issue. Brig work is some depressing shit. Long hours at work, either 12s or 24s at a Marine Brig. You are dealing with the bottom 10% of the military. The part that noone wants, all commands send us the shitbags they no-longer want with them. It's a thankless job that noone knows about, almost ALL of the guards thought they were going to be MPs, but got a prison guard MOS instead for 5 years. Also it's not fun or meaningful at all. It's babysitting work, you are literally there to make sure they Eat, Sleep, follow the Plan of the Day and don't harm themselves. Being detached from normal Marine Corps Operations, many junior Marines think they're not ""Real Marines"", every single day is the same monotone thing due to the prisoner schedule, I knew someone that came from base police (PMO) and he absolutely hated the job since it was the same thing every day.  Couple that with working at a Navy Facility and having E5s and E6s that are on their Shore Duty that have never stepped foot in a prison (Because they're an electritian, gunnersmate etc), bossing around a Lcpl that's been doing the job for 2 years. Or with Marine Brigs, having idiot NCOs lat move into the MOS and work before they even go to the schoolhouse. Who boss around the Senior Lances and PFCs that have been running the entire facitliy before they even got there.  Yes, petty officer, I'll mop the floor of the prisoner Gymnasium (even though thats what the prisoner work force is for) Yes petty officer I'll leave the Rec Yard where there's 60 prisoners and 4 staff just to sign some civilian out on the quarter deck. The first class petty officers are put in charge of entire shifts although they've been at the facility for 6 months. The Marine that has been in corrections for 4 years is made to do bitch work, even though they've worked at 2 facilities, seen his friends attacked by prisoners, saved numerous prisoners from killing themselves, and was the best working the segregation unit with only a PFC as his A-duty.

USMC,3938xy,DinosaurGunMan,4,Tue Jun 9 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"Really good insight. I've heard nothing but horror stories from the brig.  It is really hard for someone in a non deployable status to reconcile with themselves on their place in the Marine Corps. So much emphasis is put on deployments and ribbons that someone that gets stuck in a CONUS unit has a hard time feeling like a Marine most of the time. Just look at any military page and their constant mocking of NCOs with 2 or 3 ribbons. People don't choose to get stationed where they do, but that doesn't make them any less a Marine than someone who has been there, done that, and got the t shirt.  Interesting perspective, thanks again for sharing it."

Back gate, take that road two traffic lights to onewa st make a left, take into Kailua and there's a little liquor store across from cvs / the hardware store. Steak and chicken with rice. Bbq sauce and Siracha. I cannot stress how important this is to your happiness.   Run often, keep fit.  Don't sit in the barracks and order dominoes and papa johns. Your beach body is now year round. Run the ponds, Radar road, KT. All staples of a good morning pt. the gym is pretty good, but it's always packed. There's a satellite gym over by the chow hall that has crossfit-esq weights and bars, and an annex next to that. Find a routine, stick to it.    Explore the island. Hanauma bay has awesome snorkeling. Manawili falls is over in Kailua, 40 minute hike up to a waterfall. Turtle bay over on the west side is where they filmed forgetting Sarah Marshall. Stairway to heaven hike, illegal, but only if you get caught (everyone gets caught, depends on if the cop wants to write you a ticket) .   Don't blow your money in Waikiki every weekend. If you do go to Waikiki, two friends. Three tops. No one likes a crowd of Marines. There's a lot of military, so don't be stupid.   There's a boot shuttle from kahunas that goes down to Waikiki on Friday/ Saturday. Saves a 60$ cab ride each way. Highly recommend until you get a car. Not a mustang. A sensible daily driver that you won't mind getting a ding or dent. Sell it reasonably to a new join when you leave the island.  Lastly, and most important. Hawaii is a worldwide vacation hotspot. Every week women from around the world are traveling to Hawaii for that once in a lifetime vacation. You get to be that Marine that showed her a good time. Don't fuck it up.

The old names you see on MOL by rank/time in grade are in fact deserters. Click on their names and you will see they belong to our unit. The Marines will never drop them from the roles until they surrender or a death certificate is found. My oldest case was from World War II if that tells you how serious and stubborn they are about the roles. The downside is that the UA Marine is taking a spot in that MOS that could be used for a new recruit. Hope that helps answer your question.

Works well on chevrons too (even the zinc ones, which tend to break easily so I suggest finding an old brass set and using those... if you ask your Gunny nicely they may have an old brass Lance set to give you). What does piss off Recon is rolling your field cover on both sides.  /u/HeroOfCanton is right about the rubber silencers (well, my male Marines told me about the chest hair bit, and obviously my trick of silencing them by sticking them under my bra-strap won't work for you! ha) and they disintegrate quickly under the heat and movement from a SAPI plate so just find a way to keep them quiet.

Pay him and he measured you up and returned with the suit.  I did embassy duty in Vietnam and there were TONS of cheap tailors there too. Hell in Syria I had a custom tuxedo with two shirts and tie/accessories made for only 160 bucks. Tailoring is super cheap most places overseas.

Ghengis Kahn's Mongolian BBQ is still one of the best places for Mongolian I've ever been too. It's a pain in the ass to get to if you don't have a car or a friend with one, but worth it.  The Orion Beerfest is a good time too.   When I was there, illegal street racing down by the docks in Naha was a thing and it was cool to watch (don't participate, even if you do have a car).  Stay away from the buy-me-drinky girls and the ""special"" massage parlors."
USMC,38xod8,myrandomname,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"What base will you be at?  That changes a lot of things.  One thing, you will see the banana show, it is a rite of passage for new Marines to Okinawa.  The banana show is on gate 2 street so you will see most of the good bars Okinawa has to offer the same night.  The local cuisine is amazing.  The island dish is taco rice, which is amazing.  A close second is CoCo Ichibanya which is a curry place.  It is literally the best drunk/hungover food I have ever had.  It is very good sober as well.  Cabs are called hanchos, ask your driver for recommendations on sushi restaurants, they usually know good hole-in-the-wall places.  I recommend visiting music stores and purchasing music that seems to be in one of your preferred genres.  Some of my favorite bands are those that I discovered over there.  Another good resource is the buy-me-drinkie girls.  Tell them what you like and ask them for bands that fit that style.  If you have any other questions fire me a pm and I will answer to the best of my ability."

Every job in the Marine Corps is important to the success of the mission. 0651s are the ones who get data networks up and running in the field (and keep them functional), which is an extremely important task.   Your job is what allows information to be conveyed rapidly across base/FOB/OP, and the extra speed with which that data is relayed can save lives. Your job makes comm and logistics easier for everyone in the field. Your job is important to the success of the mission.  Everything you do is ""Marine things."" You're not just a data tech, you're a Marine data tech.  So take pride in the fact that you help provide the Marine Corps with its most important support asset: comm. Nothing happens without comm. The grunts can't get the support they need without comm. Casevacs can't happen without comm. Orders can't be relayed without comm. Calling/skyping home to our families can't happen without comm.

Shoot Move Communicate  Shooting they got handled.  Moving, that's the log guys Com, that's us. And btw he rest doesn't work without us. And when they need bigger guns to do the shooting, that request goes THROUGH us.   Listen, you honestly will probably ignore this. All the way up untill you see your first 9 line go across your network for real, and then see how much slower it happens when your network is down and it's getting relaid over single channel (nothing against the radio guys here).

USMC,38v5fp,0651,7,Sun Jun 7 13:41:59 2015 UTC,It depends on what unit you go to. Some 0651s go to Recon units. Other 0651s go to non-deploying airwing units.  Don't regret it too much. You're getting some valuable real life experience that other people pay thousands in student loans to barely get a grasp of.

The conclusion of the article was that the politician behind the investigation was literally making thousands of people go blind.  I've been trying to fight this battle with fellow Marines for a couple of days. I was honestly stunned that people tried to make this a veteran's issue. It feels so manipulated, honestly, like I'm watching 24/7 news on the next election. How in the fuck is Mr/Ms Jenner's sexual orientation taking away from our readiness or valor or whatever the fuck we're all so upset about?

Not all of your patrols are going to result in combat and 90% of the time you leave the FOB it'll be sitting on an OP waiting for the Taliban to be dumb enough to engage you with mounted .50 cals already pointed in their direction. Yea sometimes they do get froggy but it's often over and done with after a few bursts.   Wanna know what you're really engaging? Fricken land mines. Let's assume you're a grunt and you go over there thinking you're gonna be a rifleman or whatever. Nah bruh here's your Vallon and a brief class on how to use it. That's your metal detector. Now go out in that minefield and sweep for the 10-15 guys behind you and do a good job cause your buddies really value their legs.  What's that? The augment that just flew in last night and walked off the path and got his nuts blown off? Well go clear and cordone a landing zone for the 9 line to come in while the rest of your squad and corpsman try to give this guy a tourniquet and provide security. By the way it's 100 odd degrees and you're also carrying an m16 with 50 ish pounds of gear and stingy sweat is burning your eyes.  Just got back from a few hours of patrol? Well we need a volunteer from your squad to go police call the cigarette butts in the FOB because we might have a 0-6 or higher fly in.   Oh the Afghan Army are scared to watch a post we gave em, guess who gets to take turns babysitting their post instead of getting those extra few valued hours of sleep or using the phones. You.   It's exhausting and your only concern is what's underneath you because every step you take can result it an abundance of pain and separation of limbs. You'd welcome a firefight over patrols because at least you can do something besides pray you don't step in the wrong spot.   And your buddies? I'm sure they're all alive and can walk and wipe their own behind. I'm sure you wanna keep it that way."

Only thing I guess I can really say is what my recruiter said when I was a poolee, & that is, "" Everyones experience in the USMC will vary.  Just because your friends in a different unit had a good deployment, doesn't mean you will.  Take it for what it is & learn from it.  Pass on your knowledge to your boots when you're a Senior.""

A lot of these people would be helped with proper mental care, stepping away from tumblr for awhile and lifting some heavy weights.      Do I believe there aren't any legitimate cases of transgenderism? No. I believe transgenderism is a real thing in a very small fraction of the populous. But this thing about respecting ones pronouns and bowing down or being labeled a bigot because someone claims to be a woman as they stand infront of me with a 5'oclock shadow is getting out of hand.

Transgenders are something we can see psychologically and can study how it affects people. Tumblrinas take the shit overboard and claim to be snailkin with four pronouns that need to be respected! Thise people should be mocked and laughed at.  There's also nothing wrong with people having a weird reaction to a guy becoming a girl. It's rare and it makes people ask questions. That's how humans have reacted to new, odd things for thousands of years. Society will adjust eventually. It's still a shitton easier to be transgender now than it was even fifty years ago."
USMC,38qu70,TheBlackBear,2,Sat Jun 6 05:43:33 2015 UTC,"Never said gender change was normal or that it's wrong for people to have a reaction. We're just agreeing that man, vets need to chill the f out and get off our high horses about being the only brave ones in this world."

USMC,38qu70,HoboYellow,4,Mon Jun 8 01:42:41 2015 UTC,True but let's not pretend the triggered legbeard tumblrinas are in any way representative of the whole. Finding it strange and curious is one thing but complaining that someone would rather be identified as a different gender is fucking stupid. It's a tiny request that only requires basic human decency to accommodate. No one takes the apachekin shit seriously because those are as rare in real life as a CWO5. But trans people are not the same as that subgroup

Yes these morons exist, but I highly doubt they are hardly more than an insignificant minority that just love to bitch in the cesspit of Facebook comments. It's kind of like how gamers are all caricatured to be fat pimply upper middle class entitled foul-mouthed white boys just because the media has portrayed them that way for so long. Hell, maybe I'm overly sensitive about it, but TLance gets a lot of exposure these days and helps shape opinions about us. I think it's fair to point that out.  The worst part about it is that this strip isn't funny. It looks like something one of my hard left friends would post on Facebook with a ""Omg so true"" next to it. Dunno if the Bay area is making Max unconciously focus on dumb shit like Jenners transexualism or not, either way I really don't see how it matters much to Marines. Most I know couldn't give two shits about it. How about go back to being funny and pointing out the infinite pool of idiotic things the Marine Corps does?  Then again, it's his strip. If he wants to just cycle different pictures of green dicks on it each week, that's his perogative. Just sad to see a gaggle of bad strips come out as someone who was reading them years ago when I was still in uniform."

USMC,38qu70,ChanceTheDog,3,Sat Jun 6 16:44:21 2015 UTC,"I agree. I've seen TONS of Jenner stuff on my Facebook feed, with other Marines I know trying to push some sort of weird superiority complex by sharing pictures of wounded troops next to pictures of Jenner with some ridiculous caption.   Bravery isn't copyrighted by the military and it seems like nowadays commending anyone for anything or pushing any sort of issue is blasphemy against the military. Remember the minimum wage argument at McDonald's/walmart? My Facebook STILL gets clogged with pictures of Marines getting shot at with captions like ""remind me again why McDonald's deserves $15 an hour?!?!"" Or of course the old ""share if you think it's a shame soldiers get paid less than athletes!"" One that's been floating around for years.  Bottom line, we need to realize there is more to life than the military, and we are not the center of the world. Just because someone is being praised for something or congratulated doesn't mean we need to shove them out of the limelight and scream about how we're still here too.  Someone posted here a few weeks ago about how military pages love to tell people to suck it up, get over it, ""harden the fuck up,"" etc. and then throw the biggest temper tantrum and stomp their feet when attention is shifted away from the military even momentarily. Quickly got stuck in my head and it applies here too."

If they took even a single second to look up a proper uniform and said they were admin or a cook or something instead of special forces, no one would give them shit. If I walked up to a dude who had minor uniform mistakes and said he was a cook I would probably believe him and just be like, oh, dude, your uniform is fucked up and move on.

TL;DR:  i almost got my friend in trouble for kissing and telling, fooled his girlfriend into thinking it was her that told.  edit:  i just remembered that everyone at the table during the MCB was present when my friend told the story several weeks prior.  so all of my friends got to witness me fumble to a smooth recovery."

USMC,389jpf,BlackSquirrel05,6,Tue Jun 2 20:59:33 2015 UTC,In my area the local court system has a Veterans Court that always needs volunteer mentors to be paired with a veteran who has made bad decisions while transitioning. Team Rubicon is a volunteer disaster relief organization (not sure what else to call it so if I'm wrong someone feel free to correct me) that is made up of mostly veterans looking to give back. Might want to start with one of those? Hope this helps!
USMC,389jpf,tonypotsandpans,3,Tue Jun 2 20:04:29 2015 UTC,I know they accept volunteers at the VA hospitals. There are plenty of Vietnam vets at my local VA (Los Angeles).
USMC,389jpf,TrashThatsThrown,2,Tue Jun 2 20:24:02 2015 UTC,Have you thought about using your GI Bill?  It can 100% put you in a better place to give back and support those behind you. I will be able to give back way more than before I earned my degree. Please think about it.

USMC,389jpf,GREAT_WALL_OF_DICK,5,Tue Jun 2 21:24:04 2015 UTC,"So you're looking for advice...here's some:  I say move.   I know the feeling of being unfulfilled in what you do.  It sucks, it's draining and makes you feel like shit because you know you can do better.  That feeling only gets worse.  Ultimately, you need to challenge yourself.  Period.  That's what's going to get you out of your rut.  Should you try to invent the new wheel?  Nah, devil.  You gotta start small, do that 3-mile hump before you take the 20.   By moving, you basically get a fresh start.  You change everything, things like where you buy your groceries, your favorite bar...everything.  You change your daily routine too; things like where you place your cell phone at night.  These changes that you overcome are small victories.  These small victories begin to add up and make you feel better about yourself.   However, small victories ain't going to be the only thing that make you feel better.  You gotta have some big victories.  Those are yours to determine when you get there.  You already have a goal in mind and that's providing a service to others by volunteering. That's a noble thing to do, you're using your time for others.  That in itself is a solid victory if you ask me.   Just don't make the same mistake as I did and go at it alone.  Establish a support system from the get go.  Make some friends quick and meet with them relatively often.  It could be people from the local cycling club, your neighbors, or even the regulars at the titty bar.  I suggest you move somewhere relatively close to where another Marine you personally know lives.  That way, you know you have someone you can trust, just in case things go south.    If you think you can't just remember ""semper gumby"".  Good luck, Iwo Jiman."

I volunteered for about a year at a VA state home when i first eas'd and helping out these WWII vets, Korean war vets, and veterans of other wars who are unable to care themselves is unspeakably rewarding. Many of them only did one enlistment but they talk about it like the highlight of their lives. I spent about 4 days, 8 hours each, talking to a single one who had some of the most incredible stories (and citations to back them up).

So yes I understand the more gung ho of us wants to go kill the motherfuckers. Make their wish come true and all but that would just give them what they want.  Half the battle is trying to show the muslim world that these scumbags aren't legitimate and that their brand if extremism is a cancer.

Mine is an uncommon situation as I got my 4 year degree while active but it was part of the MECEP program where my primary job for several years was get a degree and earn a commission. That said, I was able to get ahead before I started this using the same methods others have mentioned such as knocking out Gen eds and doing credit by examination. My degree is from a 4 year traditional university (U of San Diego) and most if not all of my credits from Park U (online), CLEP tests, and even 8 year old AP credit from HS transferred. Best bet is to talk to an admissions advisor at temple or whatever now or as you're deciding which classes to take to make sure they transfer. I understand not want to waste time.  So sure, I couldn't do actual programming or other classes specific to CS before attending university, but I was the guy at college who was doing far less paper writing or philosophy reading because I did a lot of that stuff online or whatever."

I know UCLA just started an online program a year or two ago. I was considering getting my Masters through it, but... family, kids, work gets in the way.   As for what transfers over, provided you already have credits, you'll have to contact the individual university about that. Thankfully you're living in an era where you can do all your shit online and not have to go to an actual campus for most stuff.   But seriously, I would contact the individual campuses about taking courses from other colleges and about them transferring over."

Call the schools in Philly and ask about their transfer credit policies like Rambo said.  My school had a database of classes from different schools that they accepted credit for.  It is extremely important that classes you take will transfer, other wise it's a waste of your time and the governments money (minus development courses).  Don't waste your time with AMU, UMUC, UoP.  *not CS, but I just earned my BS in Econ with a Stats minor."
USMC,384xlv,what_it_dude,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:08:30 2015 UTC,I do.  I took some classes while in the corps.  Knocked out about 30 hours.  Most of the general ed credits WILL transfer.  I would think it's nearly impossible to complete a full degree while on active duty. Take a look at the degree plan for a college that you might want to go to see what general ed requirements they have.  Cross reference that with the transferrable credit matrix that each school has.  Protip: do try to get as many credit by exams as possible.  I got 8 hours of credit by passing the science exam with minimal studying.

Things have changed a bit since I was in (2007-2012), but based on talking to the younger guys I was in charge of, I can give you a general idea.  If you have some experience with computers and/or networks already, MOS school won't be that difficult. Just be prepared to learn alot at a really fast pace. Study hard and you'll be fine.  A day in that role really depends on your unit. With my unit, I was a data guy, yes, but I still needed to know and understand stuff about radios too. Day to day around the office was stereotypical IT helpdesk stuff. Helping people who are having trouble with their computers. Submitting requests to get things fixed on their computers.   When we went to the field and when we deployed was the only times I truly did my actual MOS. Setting up a satellite. Creating my own network and email servers, and running the whole thing.  That's just my experience. Yours is probably gonna be pretty different. But hope this gives you a slight idea."

My unit also kept the extent of my injuries a secret so I could deploy twice. After we got back the second time I finally was seen by a doc. The damage was a lot worse than expected. I had torn both shoulders out during boot camp- but the further training and deployments after the initial injury made the stuff much worse.   So, I had two surgeries, they put five anchor screws into my right shoulder in January of 2013. Then another five into the left that July. Then I went to physical therapy for another year before they kicked me out and said I was broken and unfixable. So, they medically retired me.   Now, I'm doing a ton of doctor appointments- I have spinal damage now because of compensating for the shoulder issues. The nerves of both arms are severely damaged from surgery. I also have some light brain damage resulting from the brain signalling extreme pain for an extended period of time. (multiple years) If the issue isn't fixed and the signal continues unabated then it will begin to eat away at your brain. This causes short term memory loss and other issues. I'm on oxy daily and can't even drive a car. I'm only 28.  Get your shoulders fixed."

USMC,37we6z,Vostok17,-3,Sun May 31 02:49:59 2015 UTC,"It means, since he's active duty he collects his own entitlements. We are treated as two single service members. I need at least two people in my family (me, plus a spouse) to qualify for base housing. He doesn't count, since he's not a dependent. He is, however, eligible for a barracks or to collect BAH."
USMC,37we6z,Worle1bm,6,Sun May 31 03:21:18 2015 UTC,Yeah no offense but in my opinion you shouldn't get dual BAH if you're living together. This bill seems common sense rather than unfair.
USMC,37we6z,Worle1bm,-4,Sun May 31 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"Well, by the same logic, you shouldn't get BAH if your spouse makes enough to cover your rent.   Same pay for the same work. By making my spouse my dependent it means one of us getting paid less (compensated less) for doing the same work."
USMC,37we6z,Worle1bm,6,Sun May 31 03:26:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the same logic at all. BAH is a housing allowance meant to provide reasonable living arrangements for service members not living on base. This is rooted in the military tradition of providing quarters and meals. I want to emphasize the reasonable portion, because I think dual BAH exceeds that reasonable standard. You don't need dual BAH, you want dual BAH.   Second, the equal pay argument doesn't apply. BAH is not your pay, or your spouses. It's an allowance, an entitlement with a specific purpose. As long as the allowance meets the intended purpose, in this case by providing reasonable living arrangements, that's all you rate because that's all you need.   Sorry you're going to get less money, but I don't think this bill is unfair at all."
USMC,37we6z,ThrowawayBAMCIS,-4,Sun May 31 03:38:37 2015 UTC,"No, I earned that BAH. A few years ago my spouse and I didn't qualify for BAH due to rank--you know what happens to dual mil couples in that situation? They can be put in the barracks. It doesn't matter that they're married, they are treated as individual entities. You can't pick and choose when to treat me as single and when to treat me as married. Either I am treated like I'm single 100% of the time (like now) or I'm treated like I'm married and all the be edits that entails.  If it is an entitlement I have earned, and my spouse has earned, taking it away on the basis of marital status is wrong. It is no different than taking it away because you live with your mom or a roommate or don't use a of your bah--are you going to give back your bah overages? Why not, you have adequate housing."
USMC,37we6z,ThrowawayBAMCIS,6,Sun May 31 04:16:44 2015 UTC,"Your scenario doesn't make any sense. You rate BAH based on marital status, not rank. I just dealt with this, I have a Lcpl married to a PFC. They rate BAH/base housing. Married Marines going through boot rate BAH. There is no point when BAH is connected to rank. You got some bad scoop or you misunderstood the situation.   Either way you just sound extremely whiny. This change is perfectly reasonable, and you haven't ""earned"" dual BAH."

USMC,37we6z,DeLee2600,2,Sun May 31 20:22:35 2015 UTC,I expected intelligent dialogue on this topic like we are having over in r/navy. I forgot my target audience. Thank you for the name calling to remind me.   I just can't believe you all are happy that one of your fellow marines is getting a pay cut. I'd be upset if they proposed to take away hazard pay or family separation pay or flight deck pay or any other allowance even if it doesn't apply to me specifically. We work too little for what we get as it is.
USMC,37we6z,devilbones,5,Sun May 31 20:43:40 2015 UTC,Motherfucker everyone is paid and compensated plenty enough. The only people whining about losing dual bah are people Receiving it...because it is grossly unnecessary and the DOD is bloated enough with lazy fat fucks like your dumb ass.
USMC,37we6z,devilbones,0,Sun May 31 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"The JTR actually governs USMC pay, in addition to the rest of the armed service branches' pay.   I'm a PO1, which is a SSGT. I'm not a POG. I've done several deployments with the USMC; I don't think I'm some rough-and-tough devil-dog, but I figured since this proposal impacts all of our pay that the other military subs would be interested in it.    If you find a rent lower than your BAH and save the rest, how is it that any different? If a servicemember lives with their parents and saves their BAH, how is that different than me living with my spouse and saving most of my BAH?   But, roger, I'll dip out; I don't need to waste anymore of your time."

USMC,37we6z,internetz,3,Sun May 31 23:51:44 2015 UTC,"No it means one of you (the lesser ranked) is just not getting an entitlement. I understand you're upset you and your spouse wont be making as much for spending cash but theres no reason for two people to rate an entitlement.   edit: Not to make a sob story about myself, like you. But I had BAH issues as well not too long ago. In 2008 I was a single Sergeant living in barracks that were at max capacity. Applied for and got own right BAH approved and lived out in town for over 5 years. Built a life, accumulated a ton of shit. Barracks on base came to completion and i was ordered to move back to the barracks and my BAH was subsequently terminated, regardless of mortgage obligations. Furious is an adjective to describe my demeanor. But I have since realized that the USMC isn't about catering to individuals."

USMC,37q5zh,Eskibot,15,Fri May 29 14:57:04 2015 UTC,"Use lights on the e-course, CFT, normal wear but don't wear them on hikes. They're not designed for the heavy hiking impact and you'll fuck your shit up. That being said, the insoles you get there are pretty good and you'll get a pair of rat boots you can use to hike with. Lights are great for working out but will ruin your day on the hikes/sules."
USMC,37q5zh,quarterporter,3,Fri May 29 16:13:54 2015 UTC,This. They're really only good for just that. I tried wearing them regularly and my feet are still recovering.

The Jungles (hot weather) expand a lot in the heat. be careful and consider a half size down. And keep the ICBs for inspection and drill if possible.  Bates lights are pretty much crap. it takes forever to get them to a place where they are a quarter as comfortable as the RATs are out of the box.   the aching arch is from the bad construction of the bates. yes the insoles will help a bit, but the real issue is the construction of the boot itself.  Use lights only for the E-course and the CFT. this is good advice. Bates are so highly recommended by OSOs is because they are light and make you run faster but are bad over time.  I wore mine yesterday because they were my only dry pair. It was torture. Ive had them for 2 years or so."

The one surviving Captain under his command of all his commanding officers was very critical of him and believes he unnecessarily sent many Marines to their deaths, along with plenty of other very high ranking Officers and Enlisted.  He is loved more by the Corps for following orders and doing what he is told, while Smedley Butler did the opposite, he questioned authority and the reasoning behind decisions.  Realize it was proven, and Butler testified before Congress, that multiple rich businessmen came to him saying they had tens of thousands of Veterans willing to follow him to overthrow the United States government.  These men were so powerful, that even with the proof presented before Congress, not a thing was done.

""I served in all commissioned ranks from a second Lieutenant to a Major General. And during that time, I spent most of my time being a high-class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street, and for the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer for capitalism."" – Smedley Butler"
USMC,37nu40,budrick007,1 point,Fri May 29 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"I've said it a dozen times: Butler's ideas professed in his pamphlet (that ""book"" was all of 50 pages long) reflected the isolationist beliefs of the country at the time. Isolationism fell out of favor in 1941 and for good reason. In today's world, his ideas are comically awful yet reddit seems to think implementing them now would somehow be a better option that the current status quo.   Keep navies within 200 miles of their sovereign coast? Disastrous. The vast majority of the world's trade goes over our oceans and right now, it's the U.S. Navy that allows that to happen uninhibited. Even the most hardened pacifist should agree that having the Navy patrol the ocean is an absolutely vital service. You think Iran would think twice about shutting down Hormuz if a carrier battle group wasn't bobbing around in the Gulf?   And that's to say nothing of his idea of keeping all troops confined within the geographic borders of the U.S. So if shit hits the fan, we have to load up and fly everyone and their equipment half way around the world?   His ideas represented post-WWI America up until Pearl Harbor."

I remember getting the green monster handbook, what's in it I couldn't tell you because several days in all I had were white papers falling apart because it had gotten soaked like everyone else's. Let's drill in the rain for several hours a day. Great now let's clean the rust off the rained on weapons. Let's all set up our hooches in mud puddles and sleep there out in the field. Fuck all of our rifle scores. It was bad enough that command issued us two new sets of boots because we had gone thru our old ones from all the mold mildew and rot they have sustained. Swim qual was everyday it seems from how soaked we were getting. It let up for the crucible and the following week for graduation which was nice."

Also, the GI bill won't pay off your loans, but it will pay for school after the service.

Join a sports team; rugby is one that doesn't require prior experience and is a hard-nosed game, plus you'll stay in shape. Join your school's NROTC program, or find your local OSO and help him/her organize and lead the candidate pool PT.   Be a leader in your community, both for experience with responsibility and the added structure in your life. Being busy forces you to be disciplined. There are huge benefits to keeping yourself involved and doing things besides just schoolwork and drinking, many of which will help you grow as a person and boost your resume for future applications.   Additionally, the degree you're working on and the school you go to, combined with who you are as a person and your leadership experiences can offset a lower GPA. Talk to an OSO."

If you complete it, you will have accomplished something whether you become a Marine or not, and its less shit you have to worry about down the line.

USMC,37n0t8,funkymustafa,19,Thu May 28 20:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'm probably going to get accused of having a tinfoil hat here...but here's the reason Peralta was denied a MoH.  Peralta was an illegal immigrant.  The White House was very hesitant with MoH citations during the Bush Administration.  None were awarded to living recipients and there were very few awarded even posthumously (I think only 3-4 of the 16 that have been awarded for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan).  The administration was very, very sensitive to the optics of the award, knowing full well that granting a MoH would give a strong public voice to a veteran or a family who wasn't guaranteed to toe the party line with a very unpopular pair of wars.  MoH nominees were carefully screened not just for their actions, but also for anything in their backgrounds that might make a MoH award politically inconvenient.  Peralta's background was inconvenient.  Very inconvenient.  He was born in Mexico City and illegally immigrated to the US and only became ""legal"" in 2000, enlisting the same day he got his green card (and shortly thereafter gaining citizenship).  There was no way the Bush administration or the military brass (who are also very conservative, even today under the Obama administration) was going make a hero out of an illegal immigrant.  No way they were going to give the liberals that kind of ammunition in the fight for immigration reform.  Any reconsideration or elevation of the award by the DoD would be admitting to that kind of political manipulation of the MoH process, so the insult continues.  Hopefully, in a decade or two, this injustice will be corrected, but it probably won't be anytime soon.  Edit: One other fact that I think supports this theory.  In 2012, the Navy announced that DDG-115, an Arleigh Burke class destroyer, would be named Rafael Peralta.  There are only two other destroyers named after Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, the Michael Murphy (Navy SEAL) and the Jason Dunham (Marine), both of whom were awarded the Medal of Honor, not the Navy Cross.  There is one other Medal of Honor recipient from the Naval Services that has no ship named after him or plans to do so, Michael Monsoor, a Navy SEAL, yet he was passed over in favor of Peralta, who ""only"" received a Navy Cross.  There have been at least four further posthumous Navy Cross recipients from Iraq and Afghanistan -- probably more, but I can't find a definitive list -- and none of them have had ships named after them.  Had the DoD and the Department of the Navy not believed Peralta to be worthy of a Medal of Honor, I don't think they'd have named a ship after him.  Either that or they did it to quell the political fuss over it, which is even more cynical."

USMC,37n0t8,BroseppeVerdi,12,Fri May 29 00:50:38 2015 UTC,"Basically the gist of the controversy was (i'm simplifying a lot for brevity):   Taking a grenade to save the lives of comrades is essentially a guaranteed MOH by past and current military standards (Jason Dunham, Kyle Carpenter, all those poor Vietnam War Pfc's) There is no debate that Peralta was shot and badly wounded, that a grenade was then thrown into the room, and that Peralta covered it with his body, saving the lives of other Marines. Those at the scene claim they witnessed Peralta reach out and pull the grenade under him as his last conscious act. The civilian/expert panel claim that the after-action forensics, CSI shit, etc show that Peralta's initial gunshot wound would have prevented him from taking any conscious action after that point. The act of smothering the grenade therefore could have been a total coincidence of his body just happening to fall onto it, or his arm twitching and happening to snag it, etc. Since no doubt can be present to award the MOH, they therefore refused to award it.   That is the cliff notes version of the whole thing. I think most people understand and sympathize with the MOH requiring such a high standard of evidence. We would expect no less for the highest valor award. The main reasons people were angry about the entire fiasco are:   That this civilian panel was convened and overruled the standard nomination process for the MOH. This was unprecedented.  That the panel, as Seamus O'Reilly pointed out, relied on CSI shit as the crux of their argument that Peralta could not have consciously covered the grenade - despite testimony from the Marines there that he did. It basically felt like if you saw a 40-year-old mom manage to lift the corner of a car off her screaming trapped kid, it happened in front of your eyes, and then a bunch of doctors and scientists went ""nah that's medically impossible. Couldn't happen. Defies the laws of physics and biology. The kid just slipped out from under the tire, nope no lifting involved."" That they offered the Navy Cross instead, despite the argument that he couldn't have consciously covered the grenade. If I get shot and my dead body coincidentally lands atop a grenade, thus saving my friends, there was no valor involved. I logically should only receive a PH. Therefore to many people, offering the NC but denying the MOH seemed like the govt contradicting its own argument.   What that boiled down to was that the NC does not require as high a standard IRT ""no doubt"". Just pulling a number out of my ass, for the NC you'd need, say, 90% certainty that the cited act for the award was consciously done out of valor. For the MOH, it has to be 100%.    But again, this goes back to the point of why an outside panel's opinion overruled that of the Marines who were there personally.   Let's not even get into the whole shitshow of the dudes coming out of the woodwork claiming conspiracy theories that Peralta's buddies made it all up to honor him.    *If I've gotten anything grossly wrong here, by all means point it out. At the same time it isn't something I ever want to debate again or get into an argument over. Just hope his family can get some peace and move on."

USMC,37n7ev,cookiewhistle,2,Fri May 29 12:46:21 2015 UTC,How low on your coils? I think I'm going to start rebuilding. The OCCs are a little too touchy (burny).
USMC,37n7ev,cardboardbox92,2,Fri May 29 12:54:33 2015 UTC,"My Swirlfish I usually build pretty low. It's usually a dual coil, with 11 wraps of 26ga. Comes out right around .4. The Derringer is a single coil at 1.8 and the Kanger I use the 1.2 coil heads. The .5 ones I noticed were super easy to burn because they burned the juice faster than they could wick. I didn't have that problem with the rebuildable OCC though at .5."
USMC,37n7ev,benjammin9292,2,Fri May 29 13:39:38 2015 UTC,"I think I need to up my niccy up to 12 or double up my orders and mix 12mg and 6mg to 9. I'm drawing too long so I can get my throat hit and end up roasting up my 0.5 OCCs a little bit when I have the temp I want: 23–26W, usually."
USMC,37n7ev,cookiewhistle,2,Fri May 29 14:06:53 2015 UTC,What mix are you using on your juices? I use 6mg with max VG in the drippers and 70 vg/30 pg on the sub tank. If you go with a higher PG mix that should give you more of a throat hit.  I did learn with the .5 OCCs though that if you're taking long drags it needs to be under 20w depending on the juice. If it was a 50/50 mix I could keep it around 30w and be fine. I don't use max VG anymore in it because it leaks around the bottom O ring.

Do you want to gain the experience of adversity that is common in a Marine Corps enlistment, working towards a leadership position, or do you want to start out in leadership, with much more responsibility. They're entirely different experiences, so choose wisely, but if you're interested in doing something sooner rather than later, enlist, as it takes less time enlisting as opposed to going to OCS."

By brief, I mean this is about right: ""Don't drink and drive, don't do stupid things with stupid people, if you tap it, wrap it, see you monday, green on green.""   Coordinate closely with your Platoon Sergeant. Let him know your expectations, and let him handle discipline.   Trust but verify. Many a salty lance likes to get one over on the new sir.   Protect your men from all the bullshit working parties or ego stroking dick suck fests you can.  Be honest with your men about what's going on. Don't hem and haw. Just tell them the word, matter of factly, and without remorse. Enlisted are used to getting shafted, it's not your job to try and make a shit sandwich taste good.   WATCH WHAT YOU POST ON ANY FORM OF SOCIAL MEDIA. It will come back to haunt you. Back in my old Battalion, some guys from a company over found a shirtless picture of their 1st Sergeant from when he was a young E3 trying to look cool, and posted them all over base along with tear off sheets with his phone number on them.   Don't take yourself too seriously. If  you fuck up, admit it, take the blame, and don't beat around the bush trying to hide the fact.   If you don't know something, there's no shame in asking. Ask your Platoon Sergeant first, (privately) but barring that, I can think of one case on a MEU where our Company Commander asked me, a young squared away E3 what quantities of explosives we needed to bring along with us for my section to do our job, and handed me a list of what he was planning. I made some suggestions, and explained why the changes I proposed allowed more flexibility and he agreed and immediately made the changes to our SOP. It was a small thing for him, but it was a form of validation for me about something I knew, and  that he trusted me enough to make company wide changes based on my experience.  Moments like that are HUGE for competent Marines, because we're generally used to being treated like infants.   If you're into nerdy stuff, don't talk about it in front of everybody. There's a lot of guys who see that as a sign of weakness.  Identify your problem children and plan ahead for what you're going to do when they fuck up.   Handle absolutely as much shit in house as you can along with your platoon sergeant. Don't air your dirty laundry to ANYBODY outside your platoon. There are plenty of ways you can punish somebody without paper fucking them. Looking back, the guys I respected the most are the ones who didn't tattle to mommy and daddy (the 1st Sergeant and CO) and instead found creative punishments. (usually in the form of extra duty).  Be prepared to work harder than everybody else with less  recognition."

Don't be the lieutenant who is always sitting in the office, get out there and find out how things are done. If you wanna Implement something go over ideas with your platoon sergeant first. If you need advice ask your XO or fellow lt's before going to the CO. Also keep your CO and XO happy by keeping them informed. if you think they need to know something they probably do."

Chances are you've also had a more privileged background and upbringing, you may as well be an alien to some kid from East LA.   Impress them buy not quitting, not losing your cool, not whining, not lying.  I've seen a lieutenant fall out of a hump, lie to the CO about losing a personal radio, sit down and give up when he couldn't figure out a route, etc. Don't be that guy.  Also, don't be too cool to talk to them. Acknowledge their fucking presence when they render the proper greeting of the day. One of my platoon commanders was a moody fuck who would walk right by you two feet away without returning your greeting. Dick.   I worked with and for a number of competent and well liked officers too, it's just easier to quickly list bad things. Stand up for your guys when appropriate. Brag about them where they can hear you.

I came from an infantry background and and moved to the wing... they people that I've learned the most from were my Comm Mx personnel, my MMO, my S-4 clerk, the Motor-T QC chief, etc etc. These are the people that literally make the unit function and run, and each of their jobs is unique, it has specific functions, detailed reporting, unique platforms and processes, and those guys fucking kill it every single day and do amazing work that's nearly never appreciated."

There are plenty of PFC's and Lances who do things you will NEVER do, but can give you insight on how to get things going better or smoother. Trust me, everyone wants things to go as smoothly as possible. Most importantly in my experience in a victor unit, don't act aloof or that you are above anyone under your command, they have more experience than you and have more rapport with other Marines. As a Supply Sergeant and Batallion Fiscal Chief ( I controlled the money ), I had a slew of Captains that would stomp on their Lt's who felt I was their personal bank account. Those Captains knew I was more important to the battalion and a single reality check sorted it out, avoid those by asking questions."

USMC,37jlks,Duracharge,8,Thu May 28 05:32:14 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give is a story about two captains who commanded my company when I got to the fleet. The corps is a small world so I won't mention the unit or names; let's just call them first and second. The first captain did not lead by example. He spent an entire cold weather training exercise in the Hawthorne mountains in a heated tent while the platoons dug defensive lines, performed land navigation exercises, assaulted each other's locations and stood fire watch through some heavy snowing throughout the night. We were busy and he was nowhere to be seen and everyone took note. Once he led the company with map and compass and got us lost. I remember walking through the tall grass and suddenly there's the head of the formation coming back the way we came on our left. We had to get trucks to pick us up because we ran out of time. He failed because land nav is a skill that has to be practiced, rather than memorized, for someone to be proficient. Once again, everyone took notice. Lieutenants were working hard on their own. We saw them practicing MCMAP, discussing land nav with maps, and doing all the training they were making us do. They got better at their jobs as the build up for deployment went on, and we all took notice. People would say, ""Lt. Soandso used to be kind of hopeless but recently he's been very dependable."" (For the record, Lt. Soandso became the XO on the next deployment). But The first captain was never seen doing any of this, and as expected, right up until it was time to deploy he was hopeless. Before we deployed, the first captain was replaced with a second one who was a different story entirely.  The second captain led the company on a company MCMAP exercise as a way of introducing himself. We circled up for bull in the ring and he was waiting in the middle for challengers. He grappled with the best and handled himself well (actually better than well, I swear he's unchokable). He had his knowledge down but practiced it regardless like everyone else. He led by example and he had the respect of every Marine in his command. On our first pump into Afghan, he also led us in combat, often taking point on patrols AFTER we made contact with taliban forces. I remember him telling a Lt. to shut up after being advised to hang back and let the platoon take the lead. At the end of the deployment, a couple enlisted marines made a bad decision and ended up getting in trouble. It was a stain on an otherwise spotless record for our second captain. First sergeant slayed every body in the company but no one complained. Everyone was livid and fuming because we were all concerned with how this affected our company commander. He had been embarrassed and every Marine felt the shame for it. We had too much respect for him to not take it personally when he was disrespected.  I think the takeaway from the story is that there are more lieutenants in a company than there are captains, and more captains than majors, etc. Training isn't over once you hit the fleet. It's just beginning, and unless you outperform your fellow lieutenants, well... there just aren't enough XO and CO positions for everyone to get promoted to.   For the record, the second captain was promoted to major after our deployment and moved up the totem poll."

Do not get married until you have at least three months pay saved and keep it saved! Do not get married till you are at least an O3.  Until then, concentrate on your job.  Do not have children until you are married and are sure you have chosen the other parent well.  Make sure you have enough life insurance to get them to adulthood.  Do not buy anything you can't afford on just your paycheck.  There is often little spouse employment near military bases.  Choose that SO carefully and ensure the SO is a person of dignity and grace that will further your career, not torpedo it.  Respect the other people you meet in places like the hospital. Souce:  pharmacist (me) who watched the face of a 2nd LT who had just been exceptionally rude to the lady who served him at the pharmacy.  She was holding his ID card when she allowed her sweater to slip away from her shoulder and reveal her nametag. It showed a name that only one other person on base shared. That person lived in the general's quarters.  Yes, that 2nd LT had just been rude to the general's wife while she held his ID card.  She then asked his unit.  I suspect he may have been counseled about military courtesy the next day. Don't be that guy!  Do not boast or brag about your capabilities unless you can back it up.    Praise in public.  Praise the behavior you want.   Read again the part someone left here that says all success goes to your Marines.  If you must discipline, do it in private and be creative.  If you destroy someone's career when they are a junior Marine, they have no reason to try.  Other commentors have already said this so I am just echoing with my Navy slant.  Credit to those who said it first or better.  Seek out mentors that are far enough from your day to day life to listen without knowing who you are upset with.  Seek opportunities to be of service to your community, especially on base.  The general will often be at that event for which you volunteered.  Remember that an officer has two basic jobs.  Take care of your troops and take care of your mission.  If you take care of your troops, they will take care of your mission and then you only have one job. (Advice given to me by my mentor colonel.  It worked!)  Do not burn bridges or ships until you are positive you will never need to retreat.  (Advice given to me by a second mentor colonel).  Make sure your troops are fed before you eat.  Make sure they are paid on time.  (source:  old cavalry officer who taught me to feed the horse first).  Avoid source of STD near a military base.  Some of that is resistant to all antibiotics.  Message me if you are in 29 and need to vent or try our local cuisine!"

On the other hand I had another Ssgt later down the road that when you would fuck up he'd be 10 feet up your ass,when the punishment was over all is forgotten and you had a clean slate. Like one time driving on base pmo seen my passenger throw a cigarette out the window took down my plate found out my unit called the command but only mentioned the butt out the window not that it was passenger side so I had to police call all the way down to pmo to see the Mgsgt got there an hour early (by plan) and had to police call the entire area then play ashtray till I went in (if someone was smoking I held out my hand to catch ash's and then I had to hold the butt when done) When we got in there the Mgsgt said it came out the passenger side window I still got the on base points but my Ssgt apologized for turning me into an ashtray and took my place in police calls for the next week.

USMC,37jlks,drlovespooge,3,Fri May 29 05:11:18 2015 UTC,"Example of creative discipline:  many years ago, here in 29, a young Marine playing in a basketball game mooned the audience whch included a number of gentle ladies.  A few minutes later, his major heard of it and immediately convened office hours, late in the evening.    MAXIMUM EMI was assigned and commenced immediately.  Sadly I don't remember what it was but it was attention getting.  So, when the chain of command called the next morning demanding the Marine's head on a platter, it was too late.  No double jeopardy.  Marine's career saved because a major was willing to go to work in the middle of the night.  Incidently, to give you advice from my failing, there is a point to back away and not let a bad apple destry you.  I almost did that and was saved by a grizzled chief who took the time to point out that I was enabling.  I am still grateful."
USMC,37jlks,Libohound,3,Fri May 29 02:11:20 2015 UTC,"First, respect yourself.  Be prepared.  If you are normal,  you are gonna be scared shitless the first time you meet your Marines.  Don't worry about it, just keep your head up and keep moving forward.  And continue moving forward.  Second, respect your Marines.  Collectively, they know more than you.  Just let them  know that you and they are Marines together and that you are willing to learn and  teach each other.  Third, consult with and listen to your NCOs.  They know your new Marines better than you.  They know who has a pregnant girlfriend, who has a sick parent and who just has a piss poor attitude.  Your  NCOs can help you avoid some bad first impressions.  Fourth, delegate.   Unless you are a deity, you cannot do  everything.  Let your NCOs lead the troops.  You lead the NCOs.  Sixth, develop a short memory. Marines fuck up.  Let them learn  from  their mistakes without the fear of the brig.  Most people learn more from their  mistakes than  their success.  However ...  Seventh, don't let bad apples spoil ... If you  have a Marine  who just can't get with the program, get rid of him.  Don't carry dead weight.  That only gets other Marines killed.  Finally, spend time with you troops. Don't be the faceless elltee in the corner office. When the troops get together to play a little hoops after securing for day, take off your bars and take a foul or two.  Give one or two too."
USMC,37jlks,JTMondal,5,Fri May 29 15:44:16 2015 UTC,"Listen to your Marines.  All of them.  Be a mentor & always be professional.  If you try & pull rank on a SNCO with a few combat tours under his belt, you will come off as a dick.  Just LISTEN.  You are in command but you still have a lot to learn.  There is always 1 Lcpl that will try to suck your dick to get special treatment/ get ahead of everyone else.  Don't let anyone suck your dick (i.e. Don't have favorites).  Just because someone can run fast & shoot expert doesn't mean their fit to be in a leadership position.  We have a Lance that sucks so much Lt dick it's disgusting.  He gets all the leadership shit but always has to ask how to do his job.  Motherfucker can't even read a map or call in a 9-line without looking at notes.  Half the platoon wouldn't stand next to him in a gunfight.  I hate to say it but that's just how it is.  Just listen to your Marines & don't be a dick.  In my opinion, knowledge trumps pft/cft scores.  Knowledge can save lives.  Good luck brother."
USMC,37jlks,Maxstds,2,Thu May 28 08:01:27 2015 UTC,"Coming from a Lance Corporal.. give a shit about your Marines. All of them. Even little shit like being the first one to greet your Marines (indoors) goes a long way, because it shows that you're on their level. I'm not saying invite your junior Marines to drink beer at your house or anything, but try to be involved with their lives. If you can get to know everyone really well then you'll be able to lead them a lot better. I've never personally had a bad lieutenant in charge of me thankfully. I even had one of my platoon commanders make challenge coins for our platoon, yeah it sounds corny, but I've had that coin for 2 years now, one of those years being out of the Marine Corps. I'm going through college right now and there are SO many differences between the Corps and college.. your Marines are your family.. regardless of rank. Treat them like family, but don't mistake kindness for weakness."

When a deserving Marine is getting out, make sure he has an eval that will make him enthused about the reserves.  Make sure he has a letter of recommendation from you that will get his next job.  Make sure he has contact info for you in case that employer needs to talk.  Do everything you can to further your Marines education and career goals.

There were a couple of guys who were outside libo boundaries (Vegas) and they had to haul ass back from freaking Vegas because of the bullshit.  It didn't change anything.

It makes no sense.   People who get a dui don't even need to be bad guys, they are just drunk and their judgement is impaired. I say burn the guys he was out with too, it's their responsibility as much as the guy who went driving.   Meanwhile, I was being a dork in the barracks and playing halo all night, sober.

I don't agree with this at all.  Barring some extremely rare circumstances, people who drive drunk make the decision to do so while sober.  You know if you're the kind of person that can control their drinking.  You know you need a drive home if you drive to the bar.  A decision to go out to a bar by a person who knows they can't control their own drinking is a decision to drive drunk later.  The average drunk driver has done so 80 times before their first arrest or crash.  They're well aware of their predisposition to do so and, yet, continue to do it.    Sure, there's the occasional unique snowflake who screwed up and made one mistake, but they're in a statistically insignificant minority."

USMC,37bvbq,SemperFiRocko,9,Tue May 26 19:54:34 2015 UTC,"Story time. We had an Army General as the Guest Speaker for our ball (MSG).  He recounted the following story:  ""We were doing a training excercise with (some country) and we for whatever reason called in the Marines on a MEU to make an unscheduled stop to assist with the training.  The Marines show up and do an amazing job assisting us.  We end the final day of training and I rack out feeling good about packing up and leaving the next day.  I wake up the next day at 0700 and step outside to see what I can only describe as a marvel of human engenuity.  The Marines had been up for a while and were loading all their gear up.  As I stood there with my SgtMajor gazing upon all this seamless mesh of men and machines moving equipment I noticed something.  I turned to my SgtMajor and said ""Does some of this stuff look familiar to you?"" to which he replied ""Yes, Sir. It kinda does.""  I stopped one of the NCOs and told him to find me his supply officer.  A few minutes later a LT walks up to me and I ask him ""Why do I see U.S. Army gear making it's way in to Marine trucks.""  Without missing a beat the LT goes ""Sir, this gear was unsecured and we didn't want to be held responsible for the loss of tax payers dollars.""  I was so shocked by the answer and the straight face with which it was delivered that I called over my Supply officer and we signed over the gear to the Marines.  They clearly had a better use for it then we did.""  Can't verify accuarcy of all points of the story because it's not mine."

Also the silhouettes for them are fine, they probably say it's incorrect because deltas do not have a fuel probe (some of these guys are retired mind you, the deltas leaving were recent)   EDIT: the 3500.47A will tell you HMHT-302 (the FRS) rates 16 aircraft.  A full squadron will have 12 CH-53E's at any time (instead of 16), but these are divided up constantly by deployment rotations, boat rotations, birds in phased maintenance, donations to other squadrons for their s**t, and birds that go hard down, like the 302 bird that had a hard landing, bent the transition section ribs and got hauled away on a flatbed."

Basically, before his Marines went to work on Friday, he wanted their closets open, and drawers staggered open so when the 1stSgt and CO came through, they could see all their shit.  It wasn't a real health and comfort but about as ridiculous.  I told him that I, and my Marines, weren't in his command and if he had an issue, my MSgt was a phone call and a five minute drive away.

USMC,37aqpt,Not-A-Recruiter,1 point,Wed May 27 03:17:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's a good amount of college credits and the job will help, but are you currently employed? Some districts will want you to write a statement as to why you're unemployed, but it's no where near a deal breaker.  Keep in mind they will take a look at everything about you when they determine whether or not they're going to approve your waiver. ASVAB score, IST score, drug and moral history, etc.  Make sure you find a recruiter who's not afraid to work a waiver as well, they take a lot of effort from a recruiter, but honestly if it's something you want to do you should be willing to do most of the legwork for him.  Have you been qualified by MEPS yet? In order to submit the ETP you have to pass the physical before starting the waiver process."

Many excellent doctors take a break from their normal practice to do medical procedures at the VA.  My abdominal doctor, Dr. Jordan, did over 100 RPLD surgeries before he did mine.  My psychiatrist splits his time between USC and the VA Long Beach.  You should be in good hands.  Ask for the equipment that shows brain activity.

For Marines pronounce the entire rank: E-6 is Staff Sergeant, E-7 is Gunnery Sergeant (you can ask them if it's alright to call them ""Gunny"" in informal conversation, but sticking to ""Gunnery Sergeant"" will ensure the proper professional tone. E-8s are either Master Sergeant (crossed rifles in the center of rank device) or First Sergeant (diamond in center of rank device). E-9s are either Sergeant Major (star in center of rank device) or Master Gunnery Sergeant ( ""bursting bomb"" in the center,  though it looks convincingly like a pineapple).  Jacksonville itself isn't spectacular, but nearby is Atlantic Beach, Wilmington, Topsail Island and, if you've got enough time, Myrtle Beach."

USMC,371bio,veruus,1 point,Mon May 25 03:31:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this.  We started our class today.  Things went pretty good.  Though what was funny was at one point I addressed the Staff Sergeant as ""Sergeant"" and apparently when I did that, the Corporals/Lance Corporals got kind of uneasy.  My partner saw it (I was busy teaching the lesson to notice), and at the end of the day he let everyone know how we operate with rank in the USAF.  Basically, E5 - E8 we call them Sergeant for shortening their rank.  Our E9, Chief Master Sergeant, is the only rank where we refer it to something different, ""Chief"".    The Gunny we have in the class is pretty cool.  He is very laid back.  He gave a good laughed when I told him ""I promoted him to class leader.""  So far, the class of Marines are doing better than the Army class as far as Day 1 goes.  Tomorrow we will see how well they learn the software.    As far as the local area, Jacksonville is not too bad.  It may not be much, but honestly, you guys have everything you might ever need.  You have a Chik-Fill-A, a Mexican Restaurant, a place to buy booze, and even a mall.  Compared to Leesville, Jacksonville is paradise."

It can get pretty crowded from 1100-1300, and 1600-2100, all other hours it's not bad at all.   As for drinking, I would suggest sticking to a restaurant, as the standalone bars are pretty shitty, both regarding the conduct of the patrons, as well as the quality of the establishments. I recommend the Carolina Ale House, plenty of beers on tap as well as plenty of liqour, at decent prices.  Also, no one says Luh-Jern anymore, just say Luh-June.

USMC,36x52k,Wdwdash,8,Sat May 23 02:13:22 2015 UTC,"I knew this was going to come up.  Technically yes unassisted landing, however the USS Forestal was modified to accommodate the C-130, specially painted landing lines, ship speed in excess of normal landings to accommodate yaw motion. The C-130 was modified by the removal of fuel pods, nose wheel was modified to accommodate landing G-forces or the C-130 would have bounced off the ship.  Also, test pilots aboard to handle the landings.  The ""deck"" was stacked to test a theory. Not a ""normal"" un-arrested carrier landing."
USMC,36x52k,Wdwdash,0,Sat May 23 02:28:09 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying, and I agree what bro did was fucking legit, but I mean regardless of mods done to the herc it's really no comparison. Dude landed the O-1 on a carrier 972 feet long. The O-1 had a MTOW of 2430 and a stall speed of 54 mph, so let's say it landed at 65mph ( I can't find landing data on this aircraft). That's a rollout distance of around 200-220 feet. You're bringing pretty much a Ford F-150 to a halt within a football field. Considering carrier length there never was any risk in the landing sequence other than the risk of being shot down by USN. C-130 landed at 121,000 pounds in 267 feet. In other words 50 Ford F-150s in a stones throw more than that same distance. Sure the plane was marginally modded (it went right back into regular service right after) and had seasoned pilots but the stakes were substantially higher here. Again I don't want to downplay dudes story but I feel that reporting this was the ""first unarrested landing"" was stealing from the herc crew."

We had to do Toys for Tots in NYC every year, and when people invite you in, you just want to appease them.  I was at a NY Ranger's game, and my Lance Coolie disappeared for like 40 minutes after going to the bathroom.  Since we were by the entrance, the only bathroom was up in a TGI Fridays type place for season ticket holders.  I went up and I was dragged to the bar, the same thing happened to my Lance Coolie.  It's really hard when all these people are really, really happy, and they all demand you, to sit down and have a drink...and a shot...and another drink...they fucked us both up bad.  Then they brought us down center ice seats to watch the game.  Great experience, loved the hospitality, but man it's dangerous.  I've done various events with celebrities too, they expect you to drink, they want to see you like that, they feel it shows their appreciation, and I was never one to turn down those who support us.

Your life right now is tremendously in flux.  You don't know what MOS you're going to be in, where you're going to be assigned, or anything else.  You may end up overseas without the ability to ship your POV to wherever you're going.  Tons of unknowns.  My advice:  If you already have a car, keep it.  If you don't and need one, pick up a little hoopty for a few grand to get you back and forth and where you need to be, especially between now and October, and take the money you would be putting into a car payment into a savings account.    Wait until you're through TBS, MOS school, and settled into your first duty station with no major deployments on the horizon before you drop a shitton of cash on a new vehicle.  You'll save the wear and tear on the car, the expenses of storing it (if necessary), and be better off in the end."
USMC,36t4xv,jarhead-in-germany,6,Fri May 22 13:04:45 2015 UTC,Dude you will make as much as a Sgt with <8 years. And then add on BAS/BAH. Now how you go about getting the car and not getting fucked is the real question.
USMC,36t4xv,Vostok17,2,Thu May 21 22:59:22 2015 UTC,What do you mean by getting the car and not getting fucked?  The apr on the loan I'm applying for with the USAA is under 3%. Is the USAA a good way to go generally?
USMC,36t4xv,1345,7,Thu May 21 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"Hey Devil, what the fucker above is saying is that you will make plenty of cash to make this affordable assuming you don't have a shit ton of kids and bills out the ass.  The other part even though you are an educated man you are still a boot and the dealerships outside every base in the military love to fuck you over, be careful and maybe consider buying from a private party or a trusted dealer near where you are from. Just because its from a dealer doesn't mean you won't get a lemon, a lot of people trade in their vehicles because they are starting to fall apart, not all are bad, but some are. Ask to get a pre-buy inspection from a third party before you purchase so you know what you are getting.  Ok, your numbers are a little fuzzy to me: 3% APR @ 36 months for $20,000 payment would be: $581.62, now same amount and rate paymenst for 60 months would be: $359.37  Source calculator: https://www.americafirst.com/rates/loan-rates.cfm?rateGroup=1&prodCode=auto"

USMC,36t4xv,Mystrick,3,Fri May 22 04:50:29 2015 UTC,"You won't get BAH at TBS.  Your loan payments start 6 months after commissioning, regardless of when you apply.  The loan is for 25,000.  Each payment is around 563.something.  You don't need to take out the full loan.  This is the best possible loan you can get, I recommend you use some of the money towards your uniforms.  You'll need Charlies and Bravos especially and Alphas if you don't already have them.  If you use the loan to pay for a car, you are buying the car from the dealer and they are no longer a factor.  USAA is buying the car and you pay them back. Use that to your advantage.  Also, a used f150 is a terrible idea.  You're a boot lieutenant and you'll probably want to go infantry so you'll want to get the biggest truck.  Then you'll get orders to Hawaii or Japan and either have to sell your car or put it in storage because your new F950 won't fit on the streets of your new duty station.     Get a reliable sedan that will last you awhile.  You don't need a monster truck.  Actually, get a monster truck"

Happens to more boots than anyone can count. Secondly, I'd wait till after TBS to buy a car. What if you get stationed in Okinawa and you now have a truck payment you're stuck with for 2 years. I haven't been to Quantico personally but I'd guess is easy enough to find some one with a vehicle or some way to get around.  If nothing else, wait till you get there and look around.

USMC,36r9f9,hold_my_halo,32,Thu May 21 14:17:27 2015 UTC,"I've found that since leaving the Marine Corps, I'm slowly regaining something I thought I never lost - my patience.   When we were still in, we were either being controlled or in total control. That said, when we were being controlled we had not a thing to worry about; when we were in control, we generally got what we wanted instantly. Couple that with living in a perfectly regulated atmosphere with rules, regulations, and standards that nearly everyone upheld. When those standards weren't upheld, they were generally fixed very quickly.   What I mean by all of that is that we lived in a society where everything had its place. There was always order. Losing your hat could be, figuratively, the antithesis of order and place. It's frustrating. You're in control and can't get what you want. I sometimes struggle with the same exact things, brother.   I guess it's all part of our transition. I know that living as a civilian is much different that what we've previously experienced, but I think some of us just need time to regain our patience. I know there are times where I do, and I think being patient is one of those things we'll gradually adapt back to.   I was in the exact same times you were. 0311 from 09-14. Hope this helps.

For the 4th time in an hour? Fine. Ok. Whatever.   Sleeping while waiting for this trucks to arrive isn't ok? Even in the field?  Fine. Whatever.

I've slammed cupboards and slammed drawers (breaking them sometimes), but as time goes on, it gets easier to manage.  When I say I've thrown things, I mean I've slammed empty milk jugs onto the ground or I've thrown one of the kids' bouncy balls into their bedroom because I get mad that they left it lying around.  They're 2 and 5 years old.  They're learning and it's not their fault.  I get mind-numbingly angry at my kids sometimes for things that are not their fault.  ""YES.  I KNOW you want a drink.  I'm going to f-ing get it for you, but just because your brother gets one doesn't f-ing mean you get one, too.""  I had to sit down and apologize to him because it was dinner time and he asked for it politely, exactly as we'd taught him.  Fortunately, my sons get to learn what humility is, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  I've NEVER even had an urge to do anything violent to any member of my family.  It's never even been a thought.  That wouldn't be possible, IMO.  I do verbally get mad, though.  It's a very long process, but over the past 10 years, everything gets easier to handle.

And I know those parents and those bratlets just don't fucking know anything other than their lives and it's not really anybody's fault and I can see the arteries of our society hardening and forming something that one day will be that fatal paroxysm that will destroy us.

Advice (for all):   -get the thought out of your head of the us vs them mentality  -hit the heavy bag or some form of sparring/ martial arts really helps me take the edge off when i get hit and hit back   -keep up on the PT and hobbies and find some joy in life ( i like PC games and motorcycles)   -personally i like shooting still and enjoy the shit out of it   -keep doing what you doing about not drinking, it'll only hurt   -kinda off, but i started talking to a mental health person at the VA, and got help.

USMC,36r9f9,veruus,1 point,Thu May 21 20:17:27 2015 UTC,"I had some serious anger/temper issues the first couple of years I was out.  A lot of it was psychological (hating my job, my life, and missing the Corps), some because I was stupid enough to be taking Hydroxycut.  Took a swing at a good friend of mine for no good reason and quickly realized that something was horribly, horribly wrong.  Stopped the Hydroxycut (and went through severe withdrawl...), apologized profusely to my friend, and quickly put work into straightening my life out.    Keep up the PT if you aren't and find a counselor or psychiatrist to talk to about it.  Little anger issues have a tendency to become big anger issues -- you may not be taking shit out on your family now, and you may never, but you're self-aware enough to see a problem now, you might as well take a stab at seriously tackling it."
USMC,36r9f9,analfuck,1 point,Thu May 21 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"I'm a similar way with my pocketknife. I never leave the house without it clipped to the inside of my right front pocket of my pants, even if I'm wearing formal attire.  I've talked to a counselor and she said it's most likely remnants of being used to having a weapon on me at all times. It makes total sense. If I don't have my knife, I feel almost helpless. I'm confident in my ability to defend myself without a weapon, but I'd much prefer to have a weapon. So if I leave the house without it or I'm wearing shorts without pockets or something, I have mild anxiety about countless ""what if"" scenarios involving not being able to defend myself adequately.  I hope it wears off or decreases in severity, because feeling like that gets really fucking old really fucking fast."

Physically it's about the same, except you'll do a 9 mile hike before SULE II.  The leadership evals are a little harder (i.e. SULE II is with a squad, not a FT).  Last year they started joining the NROTC and SRs companies, so you'll be in with NROTC candidates.  They've never been to OCS before, so they're going to stick out like a sore thumb and the Sergeant Instructors will target them.  This'll be beneficial to you.  Good luck candidate."
USMC,36q6rl,CptnAmerica,2,Thu May 21 09:44:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks Cptn! I would busier is better because time wouldn't stand still like juniors. Any thoughts on LRC? I remember at juniors it wouldn't be smart to kick the entire op order. What should I say and not say or mention?

USMC,36q6rl,DevilD0ge,1 point,Thu May 21 19:07:08 2015 UTC,Obviously sub-19:00 is optimal but if you keep up the hill-running for the next week you'll be fine. Not sure about LRC. What parts ddi they tell you to leave out in Jrs?

USMC,36q6rl,jab515,1 point,Fri May 22 09:11:02 2015 UTC,"LRC's not a big deal.  They'll want you to brief the order in an op order format, but just be really brief about it - what they're really looking for is how you execute.  Be concise, get a plan together, and execute that plan.  19:10 isn't bad.  If I remember correctly, everybody in my Senior's platoon ran under 19:30 for the final PFT, and the candidate that got 19:30 was injured.  So you might be towards the rear of the back, but I doubt you'll be the slowest one there."

I'm working on the Leadership Principles and what all the buildings/courses at OCS are named for now.  It's really the things like billets and LRCs/SULEs that I'm worried about, if anything. I've held squad leader and platoon commander for a semester each at my unit and run numerous tactical exercises, but not quite with the same amount of added stress or lack of sleep that I'm sure OCS will entail."

As the hikes get longer they get a tad bit slower... the 12 mile hike wasn't bad at all. You zone out for 50 minutes and just walk, take a 10 minute Gatorade break then do it again. I would think of all the ways I wanted to clean my car when I got home and that took my mind off of it.   The tests all have a bit of Knowledge recycled from Jr's in them but don't slack on studying, that’s what bit me in the ass.   SULE II isn't bad. It's just going to be a long miserable day. After our last objective I saved all the MRE gum and ""Gatorade"" from previous FEX's to pass out. Little stuff like that really helps your squad.   We picked up with 54 guys and graduated 38. We had like 5 go to boards for not bringing boots on the 9 mile graded hikes, couple injuries (broken ankle, bleeding blisters) and the rest were leadership fails or failures to adapt.   Overall, it was definitely harder than Jr's. They take the kid gloves off and you hit the ground running. Our platoon drilled constantly so we won Battalion Drill but never had time to study, it all depends on your staff.   It was the most fun I never want to do again. It's only 6 weeks, give it your all and you'll be fine."

IIRC, as a veteran who separated less than five years ago, he should be eligible to receive care through the VA, and even if not, the situation may make him eligible.   Also, considering the amount of money you've raised and are hoping to raise, I'd seriously consider looking into registering as a charity in order to both ensure the money received isn't taxed, but also to allow those who have or will donate to receive a deduction for their contributions."
USMC,36j8y1,jarhead-in-germany,2,Tue May 19 20:53:03 2015 UTC,"Gofundme itself charges a flat fee of 5%. The company used to withdraw the money which is ""wepay"" charges an additional 2.9% as well as $0.30 per donation.  I don't think there is anyway around that since I agreed to it in the terms and conditions.  One of the attorneys for Kyle is opening a special needs account which allows him to not claim money as income and no taxes.  From what I understand currently, the VA for one reason or another is not covering it, which seems fishy to me.  So it is being looked into as to precise reasons why."
USMC,36j8y1,harDCore182,2,Tue May 19 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"Probably due to them wanting to bill the guy that hit him, through insurance. No reason the VA needs to pay for this it seems like.

You are surrounded by an island full of people that speak only minimal english and in Ginowan City sort of hate you.  Thus, you bond with your fellow Marines.  When I got back to the states everyone went their separate ways after we were dismissed.  On Futenma everyone knew each other and looked out for each other.  Some things that they won't tell you in your cultural training:  If you are having a conversation with a girl at a bar where she is employed, for the love of god, don't offer to buy her a drink.  This will shift her from friendly bartender to ""Buy me drinky girl"" mode instantly.  No matter how horny you get don't go to Soapy Land.  You will see the banana show.  Don't try to fight it and force every Marine who comes after you to see it.  Don't walk around with a beer on Gate 2 street, the Air Force PMOs will snatch your ass up.

USMC,36htss,skeggox,4,Tue May 19 16:48:40 2015 UTC,"That's generally correct, the other half go to Fólkvangr which is just a field or meadow. I cringe a little when I see it being used but if it makes someone feel better, oh well."
USMC,36htss,autowikibot,1 point,Tue May 19 22:13:37 2015 UTC,"Generally true, but there were warriors who ""godspoused"" as in dedicated themselves to a certain god. The ones who Godspoused to Odin wore a valkyrie knot or ""valknut"" that marked them as such. They believed that the valknut would ensure their being chosen by the Valkyrie to enter Valhalla. A lot of Marines compare the EGA to the Valknut, because it's believed that Odin tests the ones who wear it the most to prove their valor, so it would have to be earned. Just like the Eagle Globe and Anchor."

USMC,36htss,unusuallytallgnome,1 point,Wed May 20 03:58:03 2015 UTC,"Valhalla:       In Norse mythology, Valhalla (from Old Norse Valhöll ""hall of the slain"" ) is a majestic, enormous hall located in Asgard, ruled over by the god Odin. Chosen by Odin, half of those who die in combat travel to Valhalla upon death, led by valkyries, while the other half go to the goddess Freyja's field Fólkvangr. In Valhalla, the dead join the masses of those who have died in combat known as Einherjar, as well as various legendary Germanic heroes and kings, as they prepare to aid Odin during the events of Ragnarök. Before the hall stands the golden tree Glasir, and the hall's ceiling is thatched with golden shields. Various creatures live around Valhalla, such as the stag Eikþyrnir and the goat Heiðrún, both described as standing atop Valhalla and consuming the foliage of the tree Læraðr.

My psychiatrist (pretty much turned into my MO) put me up for a PEB because he figured I would recover faster if I was at home, and he is right. I've made significant progress since I've been home. I was placed on the TDRL so it's pretty much up to my doctor whether or not I'm fit for duty again."
USMC,36hwxj,robotempire,6,Wed May 20 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"Serious question. If you're suffering from fucking psychotic depression why the fuck would you come back to the Marine Corps? I mean I have not been on this subreddit long so maybe it's all hugs and sunshine and we don't say mean things to people, but why the fuck would the Marine Corps even want you back, especially when they're paying people to retire?  Plus, you need to go see a prior service recruiter. Street recruiters aren't going to waste any time talking to a prior, they've got quotas to meet. Get the contact info for the prior service recruiter from the SNOIC who rightfully shot you down."
USMC,36hwxj,BlastedInTheFace,0,Wed May 20 14:39:25 2015 UTC,"I'll be just as serious with you since you don't know what you're talking about at all. Major depression, with or without psychotic features, isn't permanent at all. After my mother passed away in 2013 I started suffering from bereavement psychosis, however it kept progressing because I was so torn up about it. Mostly because I couldn't afford a funeral or burial for my mother. Not being around my family wasn't helping either. Also I didn't say I wanted back in the Marine Corps if you read my post. I was interested in commissioning in the Navy as a medical doctor. I made a 4.0 GPA this past semester which was my first semester in college. If I keep up my grades, get accepted into a medical school, and not have another psychiatric hospital visit, do you really think my doctor is still going to keep my diagnosis of psychotic depression? Probably not."
USMC,36hwxj,BlastedInTheFace,2,Wed May 20 15:02:58 2015 UTC,It may not be permanent but it could be. Even if it isn't there is always a risk of a relapse. Having seen someone suffer from issues relating to mental health I just don't support it. Hope everything works out. I think.

My suicidal thoughts aren't really stemmed from being sad, but it is more compulsive. It's really hard to describe. I'm making progress and becoming a medical doctor is a really long ways down the road. Probably at least 15 years after I get my residency finished, so I'll see how I progress over the next few years. Obviously if I still feel like shit I'm not going to try and join, for the well being of myself and my fellow service men (and women..

The idea of some of those older guys going out of the world more or less alone seems terrible.  I don't know, fuck. I could at least bring some doughnuts or something.

One thing worth noting about the VA is 90% of the problems are the damned bureaucrats that are way above our pay grade. There are good people at the day today level and I'm sure they would love to have you volunteering with them. At least check out what is going on at your local VA home.

It was weird. Like your first time having sex. It really was not good, sloppy, dirty and just felt awkward. Who the fuck cares, still had sex, or went to a game.  We got properly hazed when we got back. We had to puke our nasty food up....But again, who the fuck cares, I saw a baseball game in boot."

I remember once in between innings one branch would do some chant and the other section would reply in a call/response kind of thing. It was pretty cool to see.

Basically is that I'm saying, is that I've seen plenty of Marines countrywide, and not just Marines, connected to them.  And besides bikers themselves, but all things.  Marines connected with KKK, Mexican Cartels, Bloods Crips, Organized Crime, pretty much everything you can think of in some way, shape, or form.  I guess people just think I'm a very nice guy and they're very open with me, but it's everywhere, trust me.  I mean, you don't think that various groups would purposely send their own people into the military and various other places to learn, or that people from these backgrounds wouldn't naturally if leaving their background, levitate to the military and similar things?  They don't call us Devil Dogs for nothing.  I mean I don't know what Marine Corps you served in or know of, but we had a Master Gunnery Sergeant who couldn't read and write at our unit, who also worked for Federal Corrections.

If you're shit-hot you can MAYBE begin the process of going active after, oh, say, 2 years, and it will likely not be in the same MOS.  I know of one guy in my entire unit who did this, went from MP to aviation. He was a meritorious everything, 300 PFTer, and had to reenlist to get it.   Some active duty units will need augments on deployments but it is so competitive Marine Corps wide that unless shit really hits the fan I doubt you'd get in on it. Also, dude, you're a fucking electrician. Your deployment is going to consist of sitting around on a base in air conditioning. Don't think you're going to be out kicking down doors with the infantry bubbas. Why are you in such a rush to go do that? Start college. Get a job.   Just learn to appreciate the Reserves for what it is and excel in whatever task you're given. Too many dudes become shit bags wishing they had went active and start acting like a LCPL with a year left on his contract when they are a PFC with 5 and a half left. Same shit you learned on active duty still applies."

USMC,36hnm6,Stumpzzz,3,Tue May 19 14:58:40 2015 UTC,I do believe that you'll continue to see the fixed wing manned aircraft paired down as Unmanned continues to grow which is the way we are headed.
USMC,36hnm6,grives,3,Tue May 19 13:43:17 2015 UTC,"Ha you still write like a college kid. You will find that goes away if you end up in the Marine Corps, ain't nobody got time for that!  Readiness seems to be the buzzword these days, basically constant training and MEU floats to ensure that we remain the 911 force for the nation. That means smaller, less predictable, and less regular deployments. Lots of piece-meal detachments and specialized task-organized units composed of lots of different types of Marines. People complain a lot about the 'peacetime Marine Corps,' and there is some validity to their concerns, but the way the world is going I believe we will always be employed.  To answer your question about EW capability- as far as I know the fixed wing role has always been more about CAS. The whole MAGTF concept really brings all of our assets back to one goal: supporting infantry so they can close with and destroy the enemy (yut.) I don't think the loss of the Prowler will really impact our fixed wing capability too drastically. F-35 is coming, EA-6B is going, that's the way it goes."

The myth that MV-22's don't have a good ""track record"" as you put it is just that, a myth. Four high-profile crashes in the early 90's and 2000's is the only thing that separates this airframe from any other. And was highlighted by certain critics in order to cancel the expensive project. There have been more CH-53 mishaps from 2000 on than those of the MV-22 that I know of personally, and dozens of other T/M/S of U.S. military aircraft that have had mishaps that don't seem to develop this negative image.  I don't mean to detract from what happened here, but in cases like these, maintenance practices need to be seriously looked at. Between this and the UH-1Y in Nepal, and the first U.S. casualty of direct action against ISIS having fallen from a VMM-163 MV-22, 3rd MAW is about to get quite a few visits from CNAF.

Or America, for that matter.  You'll get a foreign, Far East theme, but I wouldn't compare it at all to Tokyo, Hiroshima, etc. It's more infiltrated by American culture than anywhere else I've been in Asia, by far. If you want to see Okinawa, go to Okinawa. If you want to see Japan, go someplace else.  Where? Well, MCAS Iwakuni would be my suggestion. It's on the mainland, only an hour by train from Hiroshima, or a few hours by shin (bullet train) from Tokyo, Fukuoka, Osaka, or Kyoto.   As for an MOS that might get you there, it'd need to be something in the Air Wing, unless you're in an auxiliary MOS like postal, chow hall, MP, etc."

USMC,367cp8,perrywhitepressonly,2,Sun May 17 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"I am a senior at SHSU. It is a fucking great school that is easy to focus on studies. The campus does not have that koolaide drinking feel that schools like A&M do. Politics stays off campus for the most part, and pretty drama free. Once or twice a year you will have some weirdos screaming at you, saying you are going to hell if you like sex outside of marriage or like the butt stuff. Nobody takes them serious and if you just tell yourself it is some weird performance art show then it is pretty fucking enjoyable. Also Huntsville is finally growing and the city council is finally not being assholes and letting business come in, so driving to Conroe just to pick up a pair of jeans or a decent pair of shoes is not really a need any more. I love SHSU, it is growing, parking sucks but there expanding, student to teacher ratio is awesome, We got the best Rodeo team in the nation, Our girls bowling team won Division 1 Bowling, same with our cheerleaders, And we would have won nationals for Division 1 AA in football but some northern school has our number. Finding a decent Job is a task, but I believe that is everywhere. They have a couple good bars, nothing special, Stay away from shenanigans, that place is a walking cess-pool of herpes, And Churches BBQ is some of the Best BBQ in the area, even been on food network a few times. Nothing fancy just good food. You can also find a Apt with most bills paid for 650$ish. And Our veterans office is second to none. It is run by Vets that take there shit serious and try to go to every vets graduation, I have a few personnel relationships with them, Some kats just did the job to have a job, then fell in love with it and making sure every vet graduates is there thing. You need anything they are there for you. Never had any problems and you want to go to the vet center because the people there are just cool cats that you want to catch up on as you go through school."

Thank's for the heads up about the bar scene-Not really my thing. I'm more of a cook out/Beer and dinner party kind of guy. But still a quiet watering hole would be appreciated.

I remember going to the range with my M16A2 and it being so old the blueing had worn off and the receiver was silver.  Next to us were some admins that were mad they had to go to the range and get dirty.  They also had brand fucking new rifles.  They mentioned that they were unwrapped the week before.  WTF?!  Here we are the ones who could be at the front line in a moment's notice with the shit gear while some asshole who will never fire it, has brand new high speed low drag shit.

Most of the hate you'll see is jealousy, but some of it is pure disdain, like of admin types. If your job can be replaced by civilian contractor, and is inherently not at all dangerous, you'll probably not see a lot of respect from the 03 field."

I'm a bit tipsy right now, but it seems that the air wing, who work 12+ hours a day, every day, giving you guys air support, deserve a bit of recognition.  Fuck the admin shops, the S-whatevers, and the water-dogs; we were trained with a specialized set of skills, skills that save your ass when you need it.  We don't forget our roots.

Being POGs isn't the problem, often it's just a mild jab calling someone POG, but what I do hate is POGs saying it's a ""mentality."" Yeah, there's a mentality associated with POGs but POG itself is a very clear definition. No, tankers aren't grunts, RTOs aren't grunts, artillery guys aren't grunts.

We vets need to pick and choose where we start fights or we will be grouped in with all the other activist groups that get pissed over nothing.
USMC,365xmh,eggheadbythedozen,1 point,Sat May 16 14:00:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree on the art statement. The flag raising is one of the most iconic and powerful images of American victory ever, even if the flag raising didn't mean victory in Iwo Jima. People need to chill the fuck out."

I coach high school and youth baseball and the amount of superfluous camo that has spread to everything since UA has become a company disgusts me. First is unnecessary because WTF are you camouflaging yourself from during an athletic event, but it's also the fact that there are some of us in this world that earned our camouflage with blood, sweat, and tears. No sport is a war and the bullshit warlike metaphors are as much horseshit as the game camo clothing. Putting up a basketball hoop should never be compared or paralleled to the flag raising Mt Suribachi. Cut the bullshit, quit posing bullshit war metaphors on people, quit making war and shooting people seem like a completely acceptable idea. I know there aren't too many WWII vets left but think about how upset they'd be if they saw the most clear moment of their struggle being bastardized to sell T-shirts to kids.

So I chose to live about 50 minutes from Quantico out in the woods just so I could be alone.  Fucking hate the rednecks down here though. It's a city filled to the brim with alcoholism and domestic abuse. A lot of trailer trash down here that happen to live in $300k houses.

USMC,3626mo,Modern_Ninja,1 point,Fri May 15 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"The Potomac Mills mall in the Woodbridge area has a lot of good shopping centers, things like REI, Wegmans, Burlington coat factory, if traffic on 95 is terrible you at least have an option to use route 1 to get there.  Bars wise go to DC or Fredericksburg, restaurants are pretty well spread around, and Manassas is always an option if traffic is fucked both ways."
USMC,3626mo,raider_cs,1 point,Fri May 15 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"Summers are humid, winters are cold. 95 will consume your time and will give you high blood pressure. Woodbridge is very much like JVille in that it has the bare essentials. Stafford is about the same. Fredericksburg the same.  It is northern VA so prepare for traffic for no fucking reason at all. You need to be somewhere at a certain time? GPS the estimate time and add about another 45 mins (at least).  Arlington and DC will be your once a month thing since it is only 35ish miles away but who wants to do that with all the traffic and lack of parking. Use your ability to park on base on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall if you plan on going to DC. Walking and biking up in the Arlington/DC area is awesome. Plenty of trails everywhere.  Along the lines of sports, the NoVA/DC area has a lot to offer. Marathons, triathlons, obstacle races (Spartan, Tough Mudder, etc), and many others are all over the area. As far as outdoorsy stuff you have a WHOLE LOT. Western VA and WV have any caves, trails, mountains, etc. Fishing and hunting is also very prevalent in the state. Since you're gonna be an IDC I'm assuming at least E-6 so you should know what you're into in life by now. If you have something new to try out, a fairly inexpensive way is to just subscribe/follow the single marine program and take their events as an idea maker. There's the (I can't remember what it's called but they sell tickets and stuff real cheaply) which will also have many opportunities.  VA is very interconnected state and definitely requires a POV. No way around it. A lot of dead zones for buses and rail but there are possibilities. For DC and part of VA the metro saves you the hassle of parking and having to drive. Do expect NYC style sweating down in the tunnels though."
USMC,3626mo,boadcow,1 point,Fri May 15 22:52:04 2015 UTC,Stay out of Woodbridge. I lived in the nice part once I moved here. After six months I moved to Stafford. We love it here. Getting your concealed handgun permit is easy. Traffic is garbage on the main side of the base. TBS side is great.

USMC,362niz,md28usmc,1 point,Fri May 15 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"on a VA home loan, you can go up to 100% financing, but the VA charges a funding fee of between 1.5% and 2.4% based on your down payment and service.  This fee is waived if you have any disability rating.  If you get a jumbo loan (a loan over $417,000) you have to pay the difference between the limit and the purchase price.  (which is most likely where your required down payment came into play).  Refinances have different funding fee rates, but as we're looking into purchase I'm not dealing with those.  Now that I got out, I got into my civilian career as a Loan officer, so I'm looking into the details of my options"

You will not be discharged over seeking mental health services or taking medication, but depending on the type of depression you have you may lose access to the armory/weapons until cleared by medical. You will not be deployed while taking these medications, so keep that in mind if deployment is one of your goals.   In terms of your medical records, it depends on who is treating you. If you received a diagnosis and prescription from a BAS/RAS station it will be in your records for any provider to see. If you went to MHU (mental health unit) they have their own record system that can only be accessed by certain providers.

I've had many of my Marines seek help from mental health and the SACO in one capacity or another.

While technically true, the command works with medical in any cases where some sort of administrative action is required. Sometimes it's LimDu paperwork, sometimes it's an MO telling the command to remove access to information or AA&E, sometimes it's just the command being advised to make sure that SNM with a case of depression isn't left alone but not put on suicide watch. I've seriously had my Marine's provider at MHU call to tell me that my Marines should take our guy out for some bowling or a movie.  Most commands have something similar to a Force Preservation Council. It's essentially the CoC keeping a watch on Marines that aren't disciplinary concerns yet, but the command can prevent. One of my Marines was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and we briefed his status weekly to a small group of people so they understood the actions we were taking at the NCO/SNCO level to make sure nothing bad happened."

Only if they gave you meds like Xanax or Valium for it which is rare. If it's just the normal SSRI's like celexa, Zoloft or whatnot, they don't show up. I'm not sure how reserves work but just being diagnosed with anxiety depression doesn't disqualify you from serving. Your medical officer will make the decision if it is something that keeps you from doing your job. Most of the time, if you have this and want to stay in, as long as it's not interfering then you're fine. I will say don't try and hide it and stop the meds to fix it. I tried that twice and I crashed and burned. Ignoring or pretending it's not there just makes this worse. Be open with your medical officer and with yourself."

Please document it and you should be ok. If you don't document, you were never on those meds and you'll have to deal with your chain.

The Chinese are building a blue-water navy, and they have a massive brown-water coast guard with armed ships.  The diplomacy involved in all of this ""who gets invited to participate"" is very weird. The Chinese do get invited frequently, but they accept invitations and then recant enough that our planners get frustrated with their flakiness. They also sometimes cancel exercises that they are participating in to show displeasure over other U.S. actions.  Most recently, China was involved in RIMPAC, one of the largest exercises in the region. They sent four naval vessels, but then bizarrely also sent a spy ship to monitor the exercise that they were already a part of."

USMC,35zmmx,fdatb,3,Thu May 14 21:11:43 2015 UTC,"I'm an active duty 6694 currently stationed in Yuma. I assume, like most of us, you signed an Avionics contract but got this instead?  Anyway, school is quite long, because this is one of the more technical MOS's. It's roughly 7-9 months, depending on how long you spend in MAT (Marines Awaiting Training, basically waiting to start class). School is tough, and more than likely you will need to study to even pass, and if you want to graduate at the top of your class you will definitely need to study your ass off. There is A LOT of book knowledge to memorize, but there is some prac app as well. If you had the ASVAB scores to qualify you should be intelligent enough to pass, just show some discipline and study.  As far as the fleet, you will likely be sent to a MALS first, and from there you might get sent to a squadron. The MALS shop is pretty small and close-knit. You'll usually have a few lances, a few Cpls, a Sgt, and a MSgt. When you're at the MALS, you'll either be Customer Support Division (CSD), or Network Support Division (NSD). CSD is basically IT, you answer calls from other Marines and help them out with whatever computer problems they have. Though CSD sucks, you'll spend most of your time getting bitched at by SNCOs who feel they are special snowflakes, so try to get into NSD as soon as possible.  For NSD, you basically just support the servers that host OOMA/NTCSS (you'll learn what these are). Essentially, these are the servers maintainers connect to to do their jobs. You don't have to deal with answering phone calls all day, but if shit breaks people will be breathing down your neck to fix it. Still, you learn a lot more here and I find it more challenging and rewarding.  At the squadron, you usually are the only one with your MOS there and support the whole unit on your own. You have a ton of responsibility, but if you get things done you're pretty much left to your own devices and don't have to deal with most of the stupid shit that you would normally deal with as a Lance, since you are literally your shop's chief.  Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions."

I felt like I was dying and rotting away at the MALS because all the problems are stupid shit like tape on the bottom of the mouse and because of just peer boredom. At the squadron you still have some of the silly shit but you are also actually challenged from time to time. In my opinion squadron level 6694/s-6 is the best job in the fucking corps.  Go some place cool with squadron set up some computers and network make shit work good and relax. If everything is working well and you are on top of your shit you will mostly be left alone.

Could you provide an example of how the ""perceived gender crises"" has been an non-issue in an Infantry unit?  I've had lionesses and FET attracted to my unit for a couple weeks on deployment, so those would be a bad example.  Since you want to try and slander us ""neanderthals"", we do have a pride in our profession.  We are in fact the forefront of the Marine Corps.  Yes POGs go to the field, are attached to Infantry units, see combat, etc., but the fact remains your mission in the Corps is not to perform direct action.  You may get thrown into that situation, great, but that's a rarity and you're not going to close with and destroy the enemy, you're going to push off the ""X"" and defend yourself. The Infantry is what the world judges the quality of the Corps by, not how high speed your typing skills are.  You clearly have no idea how complex and stressful the job of an Infantryman can be when in theater, so you're just as ignorant of our job as we are yours.  The disparity of Grunts vs. POGs is the willingness to expose yourself to combat from the time you were signing your first contract.  Consider this, if the Corps wanted to take all the POG MOSs in which the Navy could man and do away with them there would be a huge uproar and in that event POGs would consider the opinion of a Grunt invalid, the same way Grunts feel when POGs displays their personal feelings on an Infantry issue.  At the end of the day the Corps is going to do whatever it wants, usually to conform to appease the masses, not to improve combat readiness."

But it will take time to reach the site where it has been located in the Tamakoshi region north of the capital of Kathmandu.  The Huey helicopter was carrying six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese soldiers when it disappeared Tuesday during a mission in a remote mountainous region in Nepal, a defense official said.  The utility helicopter from Marine Light Attack Helicopter squadron 469 based at Camp Pendleton, California, was last seen after another helicopter in the area ""picked up some [radio] chatter about a fuel problem,"" said Army Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman.  ""Right now we are hopeful that there was no crash. There has been no [emergency] beacon, no other signs — no flames, no smoke, no hole in the ground — to indicate that there was a crash,"" Warren said.  ""That said of course it's very rugged and difficult terrain,"" he added.  There are currently about 300 U.S. military personnel in Nepal providing humanitarian support and disaster relief supplies following the massive earthquake that hit the mountainous country more than two weeks ago.  The helicopter was flying in the vicinity of Charikot, Nepal. The six Marines, along with two Nepalese army soldiers on board, had dropped off some relief supplies, including tarps and rice, at one location and then took off on route to a second drop spot when they lost contact, Warren said.  The Nepalese Air Brigade reported the helicopter's last known airborne location and three MV-22B Ospreys searched that area for 90 minutes, but were unable to find the aircraft. The air search was halted after dark and Nepalese soldiers were heading to the area on foot, Warren said.  U.S. and Nepalese aircraft will resume aerial search procedures at daybreak, according to a news release.  Marine Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy, the forward commander of Joint Task Force 505, is leading the personnel rescue effort, Warren said.  A U.S. Air Force pararescue team ""has rehearsed and is ready to execute if needed,"" Warren said.  The mountainous terrain makes the search very difficult.  ""If it set down, then it can't get radio transmissions out because that means it's on low ground surrounded by mountains. Essentially what we have right now is truly a missing helicopter. We simply don't know its location,"" Warren said.  The report of radio chatter about a fuel problem came from an Indian helicopter that was flying in the area at the time, Warren said.  ""Right now we are hopeful. We have reason to believe this is simply the case of a helicopter that has landed and is out of communication."""

Having dealt with Harrier and EA6-B folks while I was in, it seemed like the fixed wing community was pretty similar across the various platforms. Ospreys are in a wierd place between fixed wing and skids, so I have a hard time speaking for certain. There are cultural differences between fixed wing and skids. We did not call our boots nugs, for instance. Getting a plane captain qual for fixed wing means something fairly different from a plane captain on skids.  I'd hazard a guess that my OP is pretty accurate in a broad sense for any flightline job in the wing. The key takeaways are that you are going to work a ton of hours, you're going to bust your ass, and you'll have a lot of opportunities for fun if you aren't a shitbird.

USMC,35vadi,fyuocuk2,3,Thu May 14 03:06:44 2015 UTC,"Get used to stupid hours, especially if you're night crew. At least if you're in an HMLA, can't speak for any other units. Also if you end up in an HMLA prepare yourself for a super high op tempo. Bodies are always leaving for some type of training det, or MEU or going UDP. I would never want to be an airframer, but I do envy the fact that like flight liners they're a pretty large work enter and they seem to be pretty tight knit amongst their ranks. If you're not a total weirdo or shitbag you'll probably have a pretty good group of buddies to share your misery with"
USMC,35vadi,bobbabouie91,2,Wed May 13 21:07:17 2015 UTC,"If you go to an HMLA be prepared to work for 12 on 12 off bare minimum, if youre night crew be prepared for more like 15 on 9 off, more games to be played because theres no high ups hanging around, and dont expect to ever use that nice floodlight on the gse line, it probably doesnt work, and your flashlights probably suck. Invest in a headlamp if you can, theyre a life saver until some dipshit loses his, bust your ass and bug all the quals for knowledge and ask to go on every job possible.  Try to get on nights too, it sucks but theres less politics, when youve made a name for yourself you get more time to chill, and you will learn a lot fucking faster. Again though, this mostly relates to skids as i dont have any experience on jets."
USMC,35vadi,scudsdoutmywiddly,2,Thu May 14 04:12:45 2015 UTC,"Well your platform will really make a big difference in your experience. I think airframes is one of the better shops to be in personally. I was a powerliner myself. Just try to learn as much as you can about your job while you are in. It will really help you if you decide to pursue aviation maintenance as a career when you get out. You are going to be working a lot, and it will be difficult, but if you learn to just let the bullshit roll off your shoulders you can have some really great times in the fleet."

Lances in my field were still boots, albeit various competencies of boots. By the time they pick up Corporal, they are generally knowledgeable and trustworthy enough to start handling tasks on their own.  I didn't realize the transformation from boot nugget (Pvt-LCpl) to guy that gets shit done (Cpl) to manager that doles out tasks and reports things to MSgt (Sgt) until I became a Sergeant myself and watched the process unfold first hand."

If it makes you feel better, I was threatened with a nonrec while in 29 palms, during ITX, at like 2300 at night, if I didn't complete leading marines on the spot, at the coc (lol).

VA can not pay until the Branch verifies your eligibility - but with copies of the enlistment contract and annexes which document you receive the College as part of the enlistment, VA will go fight the Branch to get you this money - some times takes a few months (depends on the Branch) but once done, you will receive back pay."

VA went to an automated computer process last August - payments to both students and schools is now averaging 5 to 10 business days. I have received tuition/fee payments in as little as 3 business days to my University. Since last August I have only had to call VA 3 times to get student's payments unfucked. I Certified 1000+ students for Fall and 1000+ students for Spring semester and have about 700 students all ready certified for Summer - because they enrolled early and submitted their request to my office as soon as they enrolled. Summer semester doesn't start until 1 June - BUT then I know that I'm going to have 40 or so students wait until the end of the 1st week of June to come into to do the required paperwork and they will be complaining on 1 July that they didn't get paid on time and going on the internet complaining that we screwed up their paperwork or trying to complain to the VP (who will tell them next time to get their damn paperwork turned in earlier) or cry on the internet.  Hell I had 17 students wait until April to request to be certified for classes that start 1 Jan and ended 5 May - they said they didn't know why VA hadn't paid them - duh, every semester each of my students signs a paper (and take a copy with them) that explains how everything works to include our office will not certified the next semesters enrollment with out their specific request (because we don't know if they have remaining entitlements or want to save their entitlements for some other time)."

I'm sick of people always talking shit about the GI bill when in reality it's some stupid fuck that couldn't cut it on either side of the green weenie.

I'm still really young looking so people don't assume I was in.

Also in some parts of the United States, MGIB can actually pay more money per semester than Post 9/11 GI Bill.

I was on the 22nd MEU as part of the BLT (Infantry Battalion), and all of the command hooyahs had all the shit duties and posts on ship. It's good because you'll probably deploy twice in your enlistment, which means seeing lots of interesting places. It sucks because you probably won't get to do any tactical stuff since that's mostly reserved for the BLT.  Chow lines suck ass on ship. You'll figure out when the best times to go are, but don't expect very high quality food, especially after not having a vertrep for a while. Yes, you are a super POG and the grunts will probably hate you. Probably best to avoid them on ship. Won't be hard to do since you'll be on the big deck most likely.

I backpack a fuck ton, and anything more than 50 pounds is out of the picture. Even then, you need to keep it under 30. Hell under 25 is better. Weight is everything on a hike, the less you have the farther you can go. 200 pounds might get you a few hundred meters and that's about it. Sleds only really work on flat terrain covered in snow too.  From what I've seen in your comment history you don't have a whole lot of experience backpacking. You said your friends saved you ass climbing Whitney. Whitney is a fucking hike up a trail, but you want to do a more technical climb that's 2,000 meters higher. And you want to do that with 200 pounds?  The biggest thing though, is that you have NO FUCKING PLAN WHAT SO GODDAMN EVER! You want to do this in about a month, and from what I see you know where you want to start and end. Other than that, it looks like you're winging it which is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen.  What gear do you have or plan to bring? If your gear breaks, how do you plan to fix it? What's your plan for emergencies (do you know first aid like how to split a broken leg? what's your plan if you get injured)? Where do you plan to roughly be each day, week, month, of the hike? There's a fuckton of pollution in the Yangtze so where are you going to get clean drinking water? How will you get supplies (you'll go through at least 6 pairs of shoes, clothes, etc)? What type of training are you doing/have you been doing?   There's hundreds of questions that I can ask, and if you can't answer them with a reasonable and realistic answer, then stop with this bullshit and find a hike that's possible.  Edit: Not saying that hiking the Yangtze isn't possible, but the way that you're thinking of doing it is."

USMC,35ndaa,macon_kosher_bacon,2,Wed May 13 00:53:39 2015 UTC,"Fellow 2800 here. So when I told my recruiter I wanted to work near planes, they gave me 2844 (now 2841), and sent me off. My INI is in Va, PM me if you would like to more about my unit. Anyways my Comm/Unit is basically support to the airwing. We as maintenence will fix and mod out certain equipment, cross train, upgrade firmware, test cables, radios, and minor repairs. Our section does not have ready access to GCSS. Being at a reserve unit the active duty takes initiative on that (for fear of us fucking it up).  Back in MOS school I learned through EROs to float gear for repair. Now my job is almost non existent, I can use neither. We have a relatively small section compared to Data, Radio, and Wire. But we definitely pull our weight in several areas, more specifically in cross training and general help setting up comm exercises.  I am fortunate to work with advanced 2-way radios in my civilian job. My best advice is to take what you learn from BEC and GCORC classes and apply them to a career path later in life. If you are in it for the long haul, having a good billet (alternate duty) can mean all sorts of options if you want to transfer to specialized units.  Your MOS is just your foot in the door, there are so many options available it just depends how much harder you want to work. Career planners are also a good option to get more info outside Your MOS.  Good luck duder."

To expand on it, your Weapons cards are NAVMC-10520s. These are accompanied by a NAVMC-10576, which in a record keeping tool for the armory. If the custodian is doing his job, the weapons cards are serialized, with the S/N on both the 10576 and 10520. Then, he has a logbook of all the S/Ns as well that marines should be signing when they receive their cards. a lost weapons card means redoing all that shit from scratch."

USMC,35gmbs,Rimmer01,1 point,Fri May 15 02:15:45 2015 UTC,"I quit with you. I don't know what MOS you are, but if you think all SNCOs secretly carry a computer and a printer in their pockets....well never mind, you're right. It happens all the time. We do. Especially at 4 AM in the armory. When someone like PFC Krod says ""SsGt, I lost my card again."" I just pull my computer and printer out of my cargo pocket and hit print. I also save them on my desktop because I assume it's normal to be so irresponsible as to lose a rifle card that it's an easy fix. No, Sgt Maj will not ask me why PFC Krod is so stupid and I will not have to scramble and think up of a legit reason to keep you from looking stupid. We also have infinite time to waste just for this reason. I don't have to get my helicopter ready for flight or take the grunts on that important raid in sangin or hit, I am just here to print shit out for PFC Krod. WE also don't question Pfc Krod on how he could possibly lose a rifle card twice. Never even comes into our mind..... It's normal. We also don't care about fucking over the armorer. We like it when he has to type up all of his shit because we just had PFC Krod lose his card. The best part though, is when you get your new rifle card! I love bringing it to the Xo, 1st Sgt, Sgt Maj, or MSgt. My conversations with them are so thought provocating that I dream of them all night. I cherish the 15 minutes of life lectures I get every time I go into their office. If I'm unlucky, the Sgt Maj only spends about 5 minutes on me because he is too frustrated with asking me why PFC Krod hasn't had a charge sheet written on him for being UA 3 times in the last 2 days. Then he tells me to get started on that.    but yeah, I'll just take your advice: not question my PFC  Krods and keep carrying my computer and printer in my cargo pocket.  Edit: and it's really not that big of a deal. I would do it with no problem, but the fact that you act all high and mighty for telling you the reason why those people treated you like a dick is upsetting. Some people will always be boots though. You're just not experienced enough to understand that some people have better things to do than cater to Krod and print shit out for him. Print it out yourself if it's so simple."

The thing is, when I moved in I checked the box that asked if I owned a pet or not. My dog died before I ever got into housing, but didn't think I had to inform them.  By the time I found out I owed the money, it was 1 week before they sent it to collections. I found out when I was told I have one week to pay or else it will go to collections.  After some research I discovered this is common. If someone has a pet, wether or not it leaves stains, they still charge for a new carpet. In some cases the tenets who moved out spoke to the new family to see if they really did put a new carpet in, only to discover no new carpet was ever installed."

He served in an artillery unit so things must have gotten pretty bad for this to have taken place.  He was in a trench and night was falling. A Japanese soldier not knowing the trench was occupied ran and jumped into it. They both noticed each other and stopped and stared at each other, with weapons fixed. Instead of firing on each other, they came to a sort on unspoken agreement and they spent the night in the trench together with weapons constantly pointed towards one another. When dawn broke, the Japanese soldier climbed out of the trench and went on his way.  That war took a powerful toll on my great Grandad's psyche. He did not serve willingly as he was drafted but he did his duty. I forget the exact numbers but he also told my Grandad of a particular combat mission he wouldn't explain the details of but it involved around a hundred men. He was one of the 18 or so that came back. He burned his uniform after the war was over and I don't know the extent of what he saw but that really made me realize war has changed and that most of us will never experience the sheer horror of a massive conventional war between industrialized nations (hopefully)"

The blouse I found doesn't have that double stitching. He told me that the differences were simply due to the manufacturer, but it was still an enlisted male's shirt, and was within regs.

USMC,35382g,3636363636,10,Thu May 7 10:24:54 2015 UTC,"Direct Commission. I think its a two week course before you're pinned. They're commissioned and wanted for their expertise in a field, such as medical.   Not trying to excuse her but it would seem there is some context to this."
USMC,35382g,Thotsakan,1 point,Thu May 7 14:37:41 2015 UTC,Yeah true but the ultimate context is that she's wearing the uniform.  I'm sure they set their standards low to attract highly skilled and educated professionals but that doesn't make it right.
USMC,35382g,3636363636,3,Thu May 7 15:09:14 2015 UTC,It's no different than the Navy doctors whom we see.
USMC,35382g,Lord_Chaos,4,Thu May 7 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"While the rah-rah shit is pretty bad the time isn't that bad.  2:47:00 for a 12-mile ruck with a 45lb pack for a direct-commission female officer that probably weighs 120lbs is really not that bad.   The falling down and wobbling over the finish is pretty pathetic and it's obvious that she doesn't have much training in rucks but it's nowhere near as bad as if she was 175lbs and dragging her ass across the finish line at 4:00.  That's maintaining a 14:00 mile carrying probably 35-40% of her bodyweight. Given it's direct-commission, that's quite a bit better than I would expect."
USMC,35382g,MerlinsBeard,5,Thu May 7 20:13:20 2015 UTC,"I agree. The video is still embarrassing though, especially the weapon handling."
USMC,35382g,3636363636,3,Thu May 7 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"Can't argue that. It's obvious this woman is completely out of here element.   In all likelihood she's probably a good runner. She looks to be in good shape. She probably opened up towards the end of the route using a running gauge but it backfired as she's carrying an extra ~60lbs (counting weight of cammies/boots/rifle) that she wouldn't be had she been used to running 1/2 marathons.   But, again, the rah-rah and overall video is pretty god damned pathetic."
USMC,35382g,MerlinsBeard,18,Thu May 7 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, this is an officer? Wow. Marine officers, male and female, complete more taxing humps than this at TBS, in friggin entry level training. What a joke."
USMC,35382g,Worle1bm,7,Wed May 6 23:41:04 2015 UTC,"Since she is a direct commission medical officer, they don't do all that training. They come in as Captains to just do doctor things."

If you knew shit about the military you'd know officers lead from the front and are held to a higher standard- it's fucking bullshit when the person supposed to lead you into combat can't even complete a hump without looking like they're about to die.

I dropped out of a ruck once (way back when), when I was doing ROTC, and I still cringe when I think about it to this day.

Losing the respect of the men I was in charge of as they would no doubt be questioning multiple facets of my leadership abilities and net competency- you fucking bet.     This is the military.  For me, it was the Marine Corps.  Marines literally fight life or death battles.  Officers lead in these battles.  The trust and mutual respect between enlisted and officer is paramount in combat.  When you are making decisions or physically taking part in combat actions, the men must know that you KNOW YOUR SHIT and that you are TECHNICALLY AND TACTICALLY PROFICIENT.  Anything that erodes this trust is fucking significant.  Being a male officer and ending a ruck like in the video would kill trust with industrial efficiency."
USMC,35382g,fantasticnarrative,17,Wed May 6 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"The point is we are all held to the same standard (or at least we are supposed to be) in the military, regardless of gender.

Your location will differ, but the meat of the post is pretty much the same.  Keep in mind my experience is over ten years old, but it should still be mostly accurate.  You're going to go to VA beach. Your first few days will be like the other schoolhouses you've been to. Recieving. Crappy, dialpidated barracks. Super restricted libo.  When you pick up with a class, you'll move into a different set of barracks. They'll be much nicer, but still not super fantastic. They're a definite step up from Pensacola, and would be meh to average by fleet standards. Expect two to a room. Unless people fuck up, you'll get libo nightly, and on the weekends. Civilian attire will be on the weekends. Drinking in the barracks is verboten. Don't get caught smoking on the catwalks. Don't leave the smoke pit trashed, or don't let your buddies leave it trashed. They liked to secure that shit.  Chow is pretty decent. Dunno if they still do it, but the omelettes they make on saturday mornings are fucking boss. Excellent for a hangover.  Don't fuck any Navy chicks. Don't knock up any locals. If you're gonna tap it, wrap it. Trust me on this one. Nothing better to piss away your career before you start than to get caught up in baby mama drama at c school.  Class schedule is pretty easy, but don't dick around. Depending on your instructor you'll PT in the mornings, go back to shit/shower/shave and then be in the classroom until lunch. Then another few hours in the afternoon and you're free. You'll have a fair bit of free time in the evenings. Do yourself a huge favor and take an hour or two each night before you jerk off to hit the gym, do MCIs, square away uniforms. You can expect several uniform inspections. Do not fuck these up, they take them pretty seriously. I can imagine it's moreso now because peacetime Marine Corps and such. Field day isn't usually full of horrible fuck fuck games but don't tempt fate. Don't be a nasty.  When you get your dream sheet, don't stress where you go. If you stay in, you'll hit most possible places anyway.  Most of all, don't be a fucking bag of dicks, do what you're supposed to and enjoy the area. Lots of fun to be had, lots to do, and you'll be there for beach season. Enjoy that shit. Just don't be the retard there in PT gear. Please don't be that guy."

USMC,34zueb,Surgefist,12,Tue May 5 22:50:59 2015 UTC,Buddy of mine got hit in Afghanistan back in '08. 30-some surgeries total later and WWP has yet to assist like other smaller entities.  I've ran under other charities which HAVE helped him and have heard the same story from other wounded warriors and from the organizations themselves.  Kinda pitiful a charity made to help those who have been wounded and their families pay their boardroom outrageous amounts of money comparable to fortune 500 companies.
USMC,34zueb,Modern_Ninja,13,Wed May 6 02:39:37 2015 UTC,Seems like the Susan g komen of military charities.
USMC,34zueb,snarky_answer,3,Wed May 6 03:42:01 2015 UTC,"or any of those ""for pennies every day you can feed..."" charities. Even the Red Cross pays its brass massive amounts compared to what goes back into relief."
USMC,34zueb,dgknuth,3,Wed May 6 12:03:25 2015 UTC,"but at the same time 6 figure plus salaries aren't always a bad thing. they are hopefully paying top dollar for someone who is proven as a CEO type person to steer the company to being successful. They have to compete with other companies that could hire the same people. its all dependent on how much they spend. For example the Red Cross has a revenue of almost 3 billion and their top guy makes $500,000 and hasn't increased it since 2008. susan g koman on the other hand brings in 400 million but pays their top dog $684,000 while suing other organizations."
USMC,34zueb,snarky_answer,2,Wed May 6 12:32:31 2015 UTC,"This argument gets raised all the time and it's perfectly valid for businesses, but that then raises the question why the WWP (or any other military charity) would be more concerned about building its brand than actually accomplishing its mission.   The entire point of a charity is to do whatever that charity's mission is. If you're not doing that mission, then wtf is the point? Cornering the market on the wounded-vet-charity market? Making money? Becoming powerful? None of that means shit to the guy with two prosthetic legs who needs his house retrofitted."
USMC,34zueb,funkymustafa,2,Wed May 6 14:11:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know about being concerned with branding over mission accomplishment, but branding is a very important aspect of any major charity.  I'm not saying that I agree with what WWP is doing, but organizations (charitable or not) need to firmly establish who they are and what they're doing. Let's say a civilian has only briefly heard of WWP. They saw the silhouetted logo on the left in passing and thought, ""Huh. That's a damn good organization."" A week later, they see a negative news article about Keystone Wounded Warriors - the logo on the right - embezzling money from donors. Servicemembers will likely recognize the distinction between the two without thinking twice, but for people who only know about the WWP in passing could realistically confuse the two.   We could also look at it in reverse. The WWP is currently taking flak for being so litigious against smaller organizations. Someone who had recently heard of Keystone may mistake the Keystone organization for the WWP. That's why charities need to maintain a distinct brand from other similar organizations. It would be nice if every dollar donated to a charity went directly to the cause, but marketing (within reason) is a necessary expense for these exact reasons.  Note that my post is only about branding. I'm not endorsing the WWP for how they're conducting themselves."

USMC,34xir4,thePBRismoldy,6,Tue May 5 11:35:55 2015 UTC,"By reliable are you asking if I always got paid? Yes, but you have to register ON TIME before the start of the next semester. If you register late, you will get paid late. If you stay on top of registering for your benefits then you will have problem.  I went to a school that participated in the yellow ribbon program. The school contributed 100% of the difference of what the GI Bill didn't cover. So the only thing I had to worry about was books, and you get a stipend for that along with the housing stipend based off the zip code for your school. I never had issues with money while in school, worked a part time job at the school basically to have some beer money.  My biggest bit of advice is to stay on top of registering for benefits every semester. That will make your life a lot less stressful if you don't have to worry about when your payment will hit. Also, the housing stipend is prorated for the number of days you are in school per month. So winter break / spring break will effect how much of the housing stipend you receive for the month, plan for that. Don't buy books at the school's book store, always a bad deal. Instead either rent them through amazon, but ebooks, or google, ""NAME OF BOOK"".pdf or ebook. Chances are it is available for free online somewhere in some kind of format. The first year of school was realizing that I would pay money for books that I would likely use only a few times, might as well minimize how much you spend there. And as for things I would have done differently, I don't really know. If you have a skill that can make you money already from what you did during your time in then do that. And go to school part time. I wish I would have done that. I went full time for two years, now I work full time and do school on the side and I am much happier. But if you don't have viable skills that translate to civilian life, then I would suggest just enjoying school and getting a good internship of part time job that is related to what you want to major in. Other than that, have fun and enjoy a new chapter in your life."
USMC,34xir4,_Dudeist_Priest_,6,Tue May 5 12:56:42 2015 UTC,"Just remember that it pays a housing allowance.  It's not supposed to be housing, car, cell phone, groceries, bar money.  It can be if you're smart, but I know many people who complain it's not enough to live how they were used to in the military.  Plan for expenses beyond what the GI Bill pays you.  Check out work study if possible.  Tax free minimum wage, but it's better than nothing.  If you're already on campus, it's not a bad gig."
USMC,34xir4,harDCore182,5,Tue May 5 14:09:22 2015 UTC,"Navy here, but same shit. The only issue i had was going to a school that charged me out of state, luckily it was just a community college and FASFA covered it. Make sure you apply for FASFA. State schools will be offering in state tuition to veterans soon so you won't even need the yellow ribbon program. You can read about it here  http://www.stripes.com/news/veterans/understanding-new-in-state-tuition-ceiling-on-gi-bill-1.301424"
USMC,34xir4,IAnswerYourDumbShit,2,Tue May 5 13:47:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I plan on going to an in state college as of now!  I'll definetly be applying for FAFSA.
USMC,34xir4,flanjan,5,Tue May 5 13:53:32 2015 UTC,"Remember it's only a benefit if you use it. Get out, go to school, and get a solid degree. Start looking at what you might be interested in. Don't take some bullshit classes and think you'll just get a communications degree. Few people have a chance for a free bachelor's, make it count."
USMC,34xir4,LargeAmerican,2,Tue May 5 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"As far as reliability goes it has not given me any problems. I do recommend giving the VA office at the School you intend to go to as much time as possible to process everything, that's what I have been doing and so far so good. It has satisfied all of my expenses and then some, one thing I highly recommend is shopping around for your books every semester and finding them as inexpensive as possible. You will get something along the lines of $500 per semester for books, you can pocket a lot of this by getting your books off Amazon (renting) or other obscure websites. I have found books for courses as cheap as 10 bucks. Definitely take classes during the summer if possible, it will help you graduate faster as well as keep that housing allowance money coming in. Let me know if you have any more questions."
USMC,34xir4,scarecrow87,1 point,Tue May 5 12:57:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely plan on buying books secondhand as much as I can. I will for sure be registering on time. My EAS gives me enough time to register for the spring semester and then some, and I'm getting on top of the application process right now.  I hope to pick up some part time jobs on the side because any money is good money, I'm also considering the reserves. Right now it doesn't seem worth it though, from what I've read compared to just picking up a part time job, at least financially."
USMC,34xir4,pyobox,2,Tue May 5 13:08:51 2015 UTC,"It is reliable in the sense that it has changed on me several times in the past 4-5 years. Used to be a  flat monthly stipend no matter how many days into the month you were actually in class. Now it is adjusted. You can get paid for online classes, which was worth it IMO. Don't try to count on it to get you by. I would not have continued going to school without it. Just do your research well before hand for the school you want, many different places will do different things."
USMC,34xir4,ThatJarhead,2,Tue May 5 15:07:22 2015 UTC,"Yes pretty reliable as in you will get your money no matter what and yes tuition and fees will be paid that is rest assured, but in a timely manner (for pocketed expenses like book stipend and BAH payment)  then.... No.  At the very least a month after your semester begins. But ya having that extra money makes a huge difference.  I use most of it to pay bills and still pocket a decent chunk of money monthly from it plus a job (doesn't even have to be full time,) and you'll be living comfortably if not wayyyyyy better then ur regular civie spoiled lazy classmates.  Advice plan accordingly to how long it'll take to begin payment   Remember you don't get paid for periods you are not in class  And if you get overpaid do the right thing let them now like yesterday or they will butt fuck you.... ha penned to me!!!  Rah!"
USMC,34xir4,AxeManJack,2,Tue May 5 15:59:31 2015 UTC,"Just some cautious advice, here.  Go to your classes. Make sure your schedule is squared away and you're well versed in it.  My Counselor signed me up for a class that I was not aware of. It didn't show up on my schedule. The VA payed me for it, and when I got dropped for failure to attend, naturally they wanted the money back.  I tried to fight it, claiming I was unknowingly signed up for it, but they came after me full force, sent the Bill Collector Mafia after me, blah blah blah and now it's on my credit report.  So just keep your head on a swivel when you're assigned a counselor and registering for classes."
USMC,34vnyl,CptnAmerica,22,Mon May 4 23:03:18 2015 UTC,"But the rapid promotion is one of several that have marked Dunford's fast-tracked military career, which saw him leap from a one-star general to four stars in about three years.

There are only two four-stars other than Dunford, if I recall...Gen Paxton and Gen Kelly. By all accounts, either one would do a great job. But I'd personally like to see Gen Kelly become Commandant. The man is an incredible leader. His son died in Iraq, and only a few days later Kelly was due to give a Veterans Day speech in St Louis. It's worth a read."

Indirectly it affects all of us because with him at the CJCS it puts a Marine as the highest uniformed decision maker in the entire US armed forces. His vision and insight will guide the implementation of our civilian leadership's orders in years to come. That will have drastic impact on the way any conflicts during his tenure are conducted. If you're no longer in that may not affect you directly but it may affect the lives of other Marines you know. A decision he makes may affect international relations which has a direct impact on the global economy and might make all our lives better or worse.  Basically, if you don't care about the topic then why the fuck bother posting?"

Questions such as their view on female in ground combat rolls, how to deal with complex moral situations, their opinions on ethics and conduct, are infinitely more telling. Yes, these are subjective, not objective, but that's literally the point of the board system. If you want an objective promotion, pick up by score like everybody else."

He was a real good kid, nothing stellar, but he seemed above average when compared to the rest of us dumbasses.  Anyway, said boot travels down to palm springs or wherever and meets this girl. They hit off and start dating. Boot doesn't know he's banging the daughter of a retired colonel.  So the colonel finds out his little precious is banging a PFC because she winds up pregnant. She says she's keeping it and that they're getting married and of course colonel says hell to the no.  The story gets worse with allegations that the colonel threatened and assaulted the daughter to lose the baby. Girl looses baby. Meanwhile, homeboy PFC is getting wrecked emotionally because colonel is messing with his girl and he can't do shit about it.  All the while, the colonel is exercising undue command influence on this kid. Charges were brought up for being UA and underage drinking. All sorts of shit just to spite this guy.

You know people are BORED SENSELESS standing watch.  Chances are that whoever is there will be like ""where the fck is this building?"" And then the SDO/SGO will go and do their round, check their containers and maybe happen to go check building 1003 to make sure it is there.    If not, call G4/S4 for the base and ask to file a work order,  tell them it is in building 1003.    If my memory serves me correctly, you'll probably end up on the road behind Burger King, by the empty-looking deteriorated buildings which look like they're abandoned.

On the right side of the map, between Michael Road and Louis Road, there are three buildings that are 1000 series buildings. Low 1000 series buildings at that.  There is a building that is not numbered, but it is in the right area, and is a classroom. It's also related to the human resource office, which a little googling will reveal is where the civilians are. Remember, you are after the civilian classroom.  Common sense would dictate that your destination is probably right there."

But as with any duty station it's as good or bad as  you choose to make it.  Snokling an scuba diving are great to do, Schwab had great beaches.  So many weekends we went to the beach and grilled and swam around.  Taco rice is good and the E club was really nice, spent a lot of nights there.  You can go out and there's a big castle you can take a tour of.  There's lots to do, like I said it's what you choose to make of it."

Japanese are very nice once you've shown some effort into learning their language.  I've had multiple instances where a Japanese authority has approached me with the intention of giving me a ticket or being  an ass.  Once I displayed my very basic understanding of the language, they lightened up. Scuba Dive / Snorkel.  People from all over the world come to Okinawa to snorkel / scuba Eat the banana.  Tell your friends and family about the experience. Learn about the battle of Okinawa.  The final major battle in WW2.  Lots of people died.  Take a battle sites tour if you can.   Don't:   Stay on base all day.  You'll probably never get another opportunity to live in a foreign country.  Go check out gate 2 street once just to see what it's all about.  It's shit. Punch the locals.  1stSgt doesn't like it when you do that. Get a DUI.  The limit is .03.  2 beers will put you over the limit.  One and done. Hang out exclusively at the bars for US servicemembers.

Other than that, Loki is pretty boring. You can drink at 20, and they lifted restrictions so you drink out in town and stay out to 0100. 90% of the people on island hate life here. I was told focus on saving money, life is short i regret saving so much, i should of traveled more. The only good part about oki is food, nice beaches and water, and the fact you get to leave this island on ops. I don't know what unit you are in but there are a bunch of units that have high op tempos. They go everywhere if you are lucky."
USMC,34mxfa,DevilsmeadReturned,3,Sun May 3 07:07:00 2015 UTC,"There's a shit load of stuff to do. Spent 6 months there on a 31st MEU. Some of the best scuba diving you'll probably ever get a chance to do. Kin vil out side of Hanson is aight but gate 2 st is the place to be by forester and Kadina. Naha is sweet and there's an afes camp ground in the north, museums, video games, cheap electronics, great food, castles. On top of all the high speed training you will do oki is a blast. Even if none of these appeal to you you can always pray to your God, drink till you meet him or become one in the HOUSE OF PAIN!!!!"

Stayed in a cabin snowboarded and skied all day and drank the night away. Met up with the tour back at the Tokyo airport were all the others asked us what happened? ) You can also get them to pay for things on island like outings, bbqs, partys, deep sea fishing, golf lessons, and shit loads of other things. If you become the SMP representative you can become a god in your unit to the other junior marines. The civilians in charge of the program can get you orders for these outings during working hours.
