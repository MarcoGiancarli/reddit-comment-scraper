It includes all the space agencies everywhere, including the Russian and Chinese which have historically been somewhat unfriendly towards the US. And, of course, we have to include all their contractors like Thiokol and SpaceX with their thousands of employees who also have to be kept quiet.  We have to add in the US military, since they created and administer the GPS hoax. Plus all of their subcontractors. Plus telecommunications companies like Iridium, which spent billions of dollars on fake satellite launches to provide global communications. Add in all the people and companies that pay for satellite phones that obviously can't work.  We also have to add all naval and aviation navigators, both military and civilian, who have to pretend that GPS works in the middle of the ocean even though we all know it can't. Also, all of the surveyors of the last two centuries who hushed up the fact that Australia is three times further from Chile than we have been told. While we are on the subject, we also have to add in the airline and cruise industries that provide transport between South America and Australia. They have to keep thinking up imaginative excuses as to why the promised trips all have to be cancelled at the last minute.  Then there are all scientists from many different countries who spend extended periods of time at the South Pole, and have to keep posting fake videos of 24-hour daylight, and have to hush up the fact that you can't actually travel to the South geographic pole.  So, once you add in these few people, you can quickly see how such a conspiracy could be so thoroughly and carefully maintained. After all, if two people can keep a secret, it should be much easier for several million, right?   This is the part that doesn't make sense to me. How, out of all the millions of people keeping this secret, many of whom wouldn't get any direct compensation for keeping it, don't any of them speak out? If these people are just normal people working at a company or serving in the military, why don't anyone ever have any proof of a cover up? With the amount of information being leaked all the time, and peoples collective hard on to see proof of/ be the one to expose such a large conspiracy it makes me very skeptical."

A lot of you will be familiar with this newer, herky jerky, bouncy camera movement that seems to be in almost all new shows/movies today (Modern Family and The Office are great examples). Your mind and the media will tell you it’s simply to hold attention or to make the footage seem more real, but it’s absolutely just a more effective way to hypnotize you, something that is getting harder and harder to do for them.   There is no evidence of any of this hypnosis stuff. That should be obvious, but I'll say it once and you can read the rest and laugh. As for the camera movements, they're usually either an artistic choice or, as he says, to hold your attention.   Yes, I do realize much of what I’m describing sounds just like basic movie making techniques (the camera movements to keep your attention, etc) but I’m telling you this is a whole other thing that most people are not aware of. It’s actually alive and in real time, involving real beings who exist in the screen/coming through the screen. There is no such thing as a final product. Nothing was filmed, edited, put on tape and hence finished.   I think it goes without saying that there's a lot of evidence for TV shows and movies actually being filmed and finished.

They should state, ""poverty and/or genetic predisposition could lead to less cognitive development""   But it was already a given that a less developed brain would either be genetic or environment related and if they don't rule out which, then it becomes a study that doesn't conclude much and then just follows with a biased conclusion.     Maybe it might be possible in future study to analyze the parents brain MRI and draw some conclusions from that?  quote from study:  ""Our study had 2 limitations worth noting. First, it is possible that reported differences across socioeconomic groups could have been caused by a third factor tied both to family poverty and smaller regional gray matter volumes, such as a genetic predisposition that might have led an individual to become poor.

Assuming conservation of momentum the important thing is NOT how fast you are moving (which can only be stated relative to something else and so is completely arbitrary) but how fast the motion of the Earth is changing. In a couple of seconds (let's assume exactly two for the sake of argument) the Earth rotates through 1/43200 of a full circle around its center and revolves through 1/15778463 of a full circle around the sun and 1/3944615750000000 of a full circle around the center of the Galaxy.  At the equator, the rotation amounts to a horizontal motion of about 926.7 meters  and a vertical motion of about 0.1 meters over two seconds for a net difference of less than half a meter between traveling in a straight line and rotating with the planet. For the revolution around the Sun, the net difference in motion is ~12 meters. For the galaxy, it is too small to measure."

badscience,3d79a8,UmmahSultan,20,Tue Jul 14 17:03:43 2015 UTC,"Since the OP has not provided an R1, I will try best at it:  I think his economic view is very wrong, but I don't know enough about economics to be sure. It is also not the focus of this sub, so I will skip that part.   Now, about GMO:   First, there has been a tendency to label anyone who dislikes G.M.O.s as anti-science — and put them in the anti-antibiotics, antivaccine, even Luddite category. There is, of course, nothing scientific about the comparison.    No, anti-science arguments are being compared to anti-science. It just happens that many arguments against GMO are anti-scientific, so it makes sense to label them as such.    Nor is the scholastic invocation of a “consensus” a valid scientific argument.   Scientific consensus is a useful way to estimate which positions agree with the evidence. It is not a proof that the positions are correct, but if you are not an expert in the field, it is probably the best guideline you have.   Interestingly, there are similarities between arguments that are pro-G.M.O. and snake oil, the latter having relied on a cosmetic definition of science. The charge of “therapeutic nihilism” was leveled at people who contested snake oil medicine at the turn of the 20th century. (At that time, anything with the appearance of sophistication was considered “progress.”)   It really is no wonder that arguments that try to look scientific (arguments for snake oil) have superficial similarities with arguments that are scientific (arguments against GMO fear mongering).   Second, we are told that a modified tomato is not different from a naturally occurring tomato.   Who says that, and where? This is just a straw man. Of course the tomato is different, that is the while point. It just isn't different in any way that is relevant to our health. And we test that, to much higher degree than we normally test our food.   That is wrong: The statistical mechanism by which a tomato was built by nature is bottom-up, by tinkering in small steps   Not with selective breeding. Here, the changes can be quite dramatic in a relatively short time span. However, more importantly, why does it matter? It would be a small change for a tomato to put large amounts of solanin in the fruit, but the size of the step wouldn't matter to the people eating it.   (as with the restaurant business, distinct from contagion-prone banks).    Is he saying nobody tries anything radically new in the restaurant business? I am sure NOMA and El Bulli would like to know that (well, El Bulli closed, but not from lack if business).   In nature, errors stay confined and, critically, isolated.   Unless they spread wildly. But that doesn't really matter, since we are not comparing with nature, but with artificial selection, where errors can spread quickly.   Third, the technological salvation argument we faced in finance is also present with G.M.O.s, which are intended to “save children by providing them with vitamin-enriched rice.” The argument’s flaw is obvious: In a complex system, we do not know the causal chain, and it is better to solve a problem by the simplest method, and one that is unlikely to cause a bigger problem.   And just what is the simple way to get enough vitamin A to people in the third world? Get them leafy greens? Get them vitamin pills? Neither of these are as easy as replacing the breed of rice they subsist on.   Furthermore, he is setting up a false dichotomy. Getting people a more varied diet is a worthwhile endeavor, and it should be pursued. However, there is no reason why it can't be pursued while we also try to solve part of the problem with GMO.   Fourth, by leading to monoculture — which is the same in finance, where all risks became systemic — G.M.O.s threaten more than they can potentially help. Ireland’s population was decimated by the effect of monoculture during the potato famine. Just consider that the same can happen at a planetary scale.   Modern farming relies on monoculture, this is not a problem unique to GMO. If anything, GMO allows us to get away from monoculture, in that we can crossbreed with other cultivars and keep the traits we want.   Fifth, and what is most worrisome, is that the risk of G.M.O.s are more severe than those of finance. They can lead to complex chains of unpredictable changes in the ecosystem, while the methods of risk management with G.M.O.s — unlike finance, where some effort was made — are not even primitive.   And how is this different from traditional breeding? Or fertilizers? Or having billions of people on the planet?   The G.M.O. experiment, carried out in real time and with our entire food and ecological system as its laboratory, is perhaps the greatest case of human hubris ever. It creates yet another systemic, “too big too fail” enterprise — but one for which no bailouts will be possible when it fails.   If he was talking about modern farming in general, he would have a point. But without modern farming, we would not be able to produce enough food for the worlds population."

A single-base mutation can have far more drastic effects on an organism or its behavior than replacing a long chunk in a chromosome. The difference is that nature ""does"" this completely at random while humans know exactly what changes are bein introduced when genetic manipulation is done so you'd expect him to be more scared of traditional plant breeding methods, if anything."

badscience,3bvtab,Das_Mime,19,Thu Jul 2 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"I want to take a moment to point out that not all low participant studies are bad. I am going to say straight up I didn't read the study so I am not talking about this study specifically, but wanting to talk about something related (sample size) that I many times see people on reddit (and in general) misunderstand.  In the same way that low sample sizes can be used to argue that a study doesn't have enough validity, large sample sizes can be just as bad. What is very important besides simply significance values (I would argue significance value is only the first thing, the second thing that has to go with that is this) is effect sizes. The problem with studies that have hundreds or even thousands of participants, which many people will look at and see that many participants is that they instantly think it is a better study than one with 30.  There is a joke with statistics that is basically as long as you have enough participants, ANYTHING becomes significant. The problem is the effect size. I am going to make up numbers here for my example. So say you have a study comparing males and females and their ability to solve a specific math problem. You test 10 random men and women... and no significance. That is okay, the way the equation works it is practically impossible mathematically to notice any difference between the group (this is called beta or your statistical power... you aren't able to even detect a difference if there actually is a difference present). So you do it with 20 participants... same problem. You do it with 50... and now something seems interesting... you are approaching significance where men solve the problem faster than women, but not quite significant. You then test it with 200 participants and lo-and-behold, men score significantly higher than women. The PROBLEM is the effect size. Because you tested so many people what is significant is a tiny itty bitty difference that when you take it into context, doesn't really mean anything.  When 200 people are tested on the math problem, we find that on average men finish the problem .5 seconds faster than women. This means pretty much nothing, but since the trend was repeated enough in so many people, it gets seen as significant. This then of course becomes a big groundbreaking study, ""Men significantly better at math than women"". But it doesn't MEAN anything. The effect size is so tiny. Now if you did that with 200 people and you found that on average men finished the problem a minute ahead of women, THEN you have something worth reporting on.  So what I am getting at is with a smaller sample size, it actually helps mitigate that problem. If you are comparing two different groups you need a larger effect size in order to get significance. But of course one study is not anything special. You need to repeat it (assuming methodology was correct, the random sampling was properly adhered to, etc.). If you keep repeating those studies and keep finding the same effect size, then you have something worth reporting on.  Basically, long story short, when reading scientific articles (like the actual journal articles, not the news writeups), there is a reason why a lot more numbers are reported in the results section than just significance. But those other numbers are hard to understand if you are somebody with a lazy knowledge of scientific and statistical methodology. It is much easier to read ""results were significant"" and ignore the context of that significance against things such as effect size, standard error, distribution of scores, etc..  Also, it is important to do the type of study that matches what you are studying (nomothetical vs. idiographic studies). So many times I see somebody using a large population study speaking about general characteristics of a group to speak about individual behavior. That is a huge no no. Because those studies tend to completely fall apart on the individual level (because the effect size is too small. Sure men completed the problem on average .5 seconds faster than women... but you put a random guy and a random woman next to eachother, tell them to complete the test, and there is going to be no difference in their finishing time (or very likely the woman could finish before the man). Conversely, you can't use an idiographic study to try to explain larger group characteristics. I can't look at a study that looks in depth at 5 women's study habits and then use my results to say ""women are most effective at this study habit."" If you want to see if there are large differences among populations, then large sample studies. If you want to see individual characteristics and study indepth, then use small sample sizes."
badscience,3bvtab,Spam4119,7,Thu Jul 2 19:55:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with you on nomothetical and idiographic inference and on the limitations of significance testing. It's also worth noting though that the effect size calculated in a study is not the true size of the effect in the entire population, but an estimation of it. And if you have a small sample size, the confidence interval of that estimation is massive (like, for n=64 and measured Cohen's d = 0.5, the true effect size could lie anywhere between 0.15 and 0.85). The CI is around a full 1 Cohen's d for n=30, and definitely below 80% power. So even if an effect size of 0.6 or something was reported in a small sample size, it's still good to be wary of the published point estimate, as it might not be near the true size of the effect or it might even be a Type I error. The best thing you want is a large population with high power and notable effect size, or a series of study replications with small sample sizes so the meta-analysis will have a more precise ES estimate."

In contrast, the sibling-comparison analyses indicated that advancing paternal age had a dose-response relationship with every index of morbidity, with the magnitude of the associations being as large or larger than the estimates in the entire population. Compared with offspring born to fathers 20 to 24 years old, offspring of fathers 45 years and older were at heightened risk of autism (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.45; 95% CI, 1.62-7.33), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR = 13.13; 95% CI, 6.85-25.16), psychosis (HR = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.35-3.20), bipolar disorder (HR = 24.70; 95% CI, 12.12-50.31), suicide attempts (HR = 2.72; 95% CI, 2.08-3.56), substance use problems (HR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.98-2.99), failing a grade (odds ratio [OR] = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.37-1.85), and low educational attainment (OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.50-1.93) in within-sibling comparisons. Additional analyses using several quasi-experimental designs obtained commensurate results, further strengthening the internal and external validity of the findings.  Conclusions and Relevance  Advancing paternal age is associated with increased risk of psychiatric and academic morbidity, with the magnitude of the risks being as large or larger than previous estimates. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that new genetic mutations that occur during spermatogenesis are causally related to offspring morbidity.  I think the original guy was well within his rights to criticise the article if that is the conclusion that they came to. Since some risks are increased and others are decreased. However, when both the mother and fathers age are increased every risk is increased.  However a lot of the things he said are either really stupid, or apparently he's got a whole lot of data that he isn't sharing with us."

badscience,3aombk,ActuallyNot,56,Mon Jun 22 06:02:58 2015 UTC,"PART 1   I am skeptical humans are the main cause of climate change and that it will be catastrophic in the near future. There is no scientific proof of this hypothesis, yet we are told “the debate is over” and “the science is settled.”   This is slight of hand.  You'll notice he conflates to separate hypotheses: 1) That humans are the main cause of climate change and 2)  That it will be catastrophic in the near future.   So that he can claim that there is no scientific proof of the two.  In fact there is plenty of scientific proof of point 1). That is settled science, and became settled in the mid 1970s.  The statement of point 2) is so wishy-washy that there could not be scientific proof of with, without defining what is meant by ""catastrophic"" and ""near future"".  The reason why he's trying to mislead the reader? Heartland.org. They're a lobby group paid to shore up public opinion against climate science.   My skepticism begins with the believers’ certainty they can predict the global climate with a computer model.   This is a straw man fallacy. Scientist know that global climate models are limited. They're pretty good for tracking global mean surface temperature, but they're not relied on as the only evidence.   The entire basis for the doomsday climate change scenario is the hypothesis increased atmospheric carbon dioxide due to fossil fuel emissions will heat the Earth to unlivable temperatures.   ""Unlivable"" is dishonest. The temperature rise we have seen has certainly been unlivable for certain species, but only by reducing their niche to zero, and having them outcompeted in the new regional climate. The word sounds like the concern is that we might boil the oceans.  Moore should be more careful about how his words are interpreted than this.   In fact, the Earth has been warming very gradually for 300 years, since the Little Ice Age ended, long before heavy use of fossil fuels.   This is simply not true. Temperatures fell from at least the start of records to 1910, and again from 1940 to 1970   Prior to the Little Ice Age, during the Medieval Warm Period, Vikings colonized Greenland and Newfoundland, when it was warmer there than today.    True, and irrelevant to the discussion of whether CO2 is the cause of the current global warming.  Regional climate change in the past does not refute that fact.   The idea it would be catastrophic if carbon dioxide were to increase and average global temperature were to rise a few degrees is preposterous.   And this is the core of the denialists argument. No evidence. No science. No citation. Simply the argument from personal incredulity. Well, we can do a lot better science than wonder if we think that its preposterous. We can examine what happens to regional ecosystems whenwe perturb the climate. We can see what happens to agricultural productivity. We can calculate what assets will need to be rebuilt further inland. We can look at what different corals and calcifying ocean organisms do under acidification and warming.  Just deciding that it is preposterous is trying to do and end run around all that work. It might shore up the opinion of those who are already convinced, (such as those who might read heartland.org), but it offers zero by way of sensible argument.   Recently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) announced for the umpteenth time we are doomed unless we reduce carbon-dioxide emissions to zero.   Really. I read the IPCC reports, and I didn't see this claim. I call bullshit.   Effectively this means either reducing the population to zero, or going back 10,000 years before humans began clearing forests for agriculture.   No, it means moving to energy sources that don't emit CO2. Wind, solar and nuclear are three proven examples that provide cheap and safe power.   This proposed cure is far worse than adapting to a warmer world, if it actually comes about.   What a fearmongering chicken-little. Nuclear power, wind and solar are not a scary as Moore is trying to make out."
badscience,3aombk,MistakeNotDotDotDot,36,Mon Jun 22 06:03:37 2015 UTC,"PART 2   By its constitution, the IPCC has a hopeless conflict of interest. Its mandate is to consider only the human causes of global warming, not the many natural causes changing the climate for billions of years.   This is not a conflict of interest. If there were no human cause of global warming, that would be what the human cause is. Anyone who has read any of them knows that they do look at the proportion of the warming that is attributable to human and natural factors.   We don’t understand the natural causes of climate change any more than we know if humans are part of the cause at present.   True and misleading. We do know very well that humans are not only part of the cause at present, but are the main cause. There are hundreds of papers showing this, and has been the precise subject of many high profile literature reviews. We understand the natural causes less well, as Moore correctly, and misleadingly says.  However, we've got a pretty good handle on the current natural causes. Those in the past we have less observations of, and because we have to use proxies to estimate the global extent and shape of past climate change, it is more murky.   If the IPCC did not find humans were the cause of warming, or if it found warming would be more positive than negative, there would be no need for the IPCC under its present mandate. To survive, it must find on the side of the apocalypse.   There's no way the IPCC, which amount to 14 people, would be able to manipulate the writing of the reports, which is done by volunteer scientists. This is pure conspiracy theorizing, that is obviously false to anyone who knows anything about the IPCC.   Second, it invokes the two most powerful human motivators: fear and guilt.    Those are the two most powerful human motivators? Moore should tell the advertising industry. They seem to be wasting their focus on a wide range of motivators: Hope. Family and friends. Sex. Enjoyment. Security. Self-view.  I call bullshit again.   Environmentalists spread fear and raise donations; politicians appear to be saving the Earth from doom; the media has a field day with sensation and conflict; science institutions raise billions in grants, create whole new departments, and stoke a feeding frenzy of scary scenarios; business wants to look green, and get huge public subsidies for projects that would otherwise be economic losers, such as wind farms and solar arrays.   Wild conspiracy theory speculation. Also obviously wrong in the case of governments and scientists.   Fourth, the Left sees climate change as a perfect means to redistribute wealth from industrial countries to the developing world and the UN bureaucracy.   This is Heartland.org's (which spreads fear and raises donations) main argument. They try to put climate change science as a left-right framed thing. Community studies show that people are much more resistant to evidence if they have political stake in one side of an argument. So to perpetuate the climate change denial narrative for as long as possible this argument is very effective.  It's also unethical and wrong. Science is a method of finding the truth . It is neither left nor right.   (And its truth is separate from what policy should be implemented to best respond to the facts. That is the fallacious argument from final consequences).   So we are told carbon dioxide is a “toxic” “pollutant” that must be curtailed, when in fact it is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, gas and the most important food for life on earth.    It's only toxic to humans at over 5%. The reason it is a pollutant is because it's a greenhouse gas, and the warming has bad consequences. Although ocean acidification is another important effect.   Without carbon dioxide above 150 parts per million, all plants would die.   This is irrelevant. Current climate change is about what will happen as CO2 continues to grow over the 400ppm mark. But I note that it is also wrong. This paper has points in figure 5 for plants grown at 100ppm. They're not doing well (25-30% photosynthesis efficiency as compared to 350-380ppm), but they're not dead.   Over the past 150 million years, carbon dioxide had been drawn down steadily (by plants) from about 3,000 parts per million to about 280 parts per million before the Industrial Revolution.   Probably not, but this is not well known. It is more likely that the rise of the Himalayas has caused the atmospheric CO2 to drop, by reacting to newly exposed rock, and then being washed downstream to the oceans. Plants may have also have had an effect, but Moore is ignorant of or oversimplifying this point for some reason. Perhaps to suggest that plants will act as a CO2 sink in the future. This is a hope. (Plus we 150 million years is a long wait. The problems that this causes for civilisation will peak at some time in 100 to 100,000 years.)   If this trend continued, the carbon dioxide level would have become too low to support life on Earth,    This is doubly wrong. In the 400,000 year time scale CO2 has not reduced. It has bottomed out at the height of each glaciation at about 180ppm. Humans don't need to consider longer time scales than that, as we've only been a species for half that time.  But it is also based on his false statement above on what CO2 concentrations plants can live with.   Human fossil fuel use and clearing land for crops have boosted carbon dioxide from its lowest level in the history of the Earth back to 400 parts per million today.   This is another propaganda piece. The truth is that over the ice core CO2 history of the earth industrialization began at a peak, and is going upwards, out of the range that any species alive today has had to deal with. Quite the opposite of Moore's placations.   At 400 parts per million, all our food crops, forests, and natural ecosystems are still on a starvation diet for carbon dioxide. The optimum level of carbon dioxide for plant growth, given enough water and nutrients, is about 1,500 parts per million, nearly four times higher than today. Greenhouse growers inject carbon-dioxide to increase yields. Farms and forests will produce more if carbon-dioxide keeps rising.   While it is true that overall production is higher in a controlled environment, in the wild the woody plants will probably lose out to vines and creepers, resulting in poorer net forest produce. Additionally the lower stomatal index will reduce transpiration, altering rainfall in as important ecosystems as the Amazon rainforest.  The claim that this is a good thing requires a lot more proof. In general disturbing an ecosystem reduces the biodiversity, as a few winners choke the many losers. And projections of transpiration predict the savannahisation of the Amazon rainforest - a disaster for Carbon sequestration and biodiversity.  Moore finishes with some outright falsehoods for your misinformation:   We have no proof increased carbon dioxide is responsible for the earth’s slight warming over the past 300 years.    Yes we do. We know that CO2 is a greenhouse gas and we can calculate what increasing its concentration has done to radiative forcing. There is lots of proof that this is the main cause of the increase in radiative forcing, from many lines of evidence.   There has been no significant warming for 18 years while we have emitted 25 per cent of all the carbon dioxide ever emitted.   Nope   Carbon dioxide is vital for life on Earth and plants would like more of it.   This is true in some cases, but is obviously not true for all plants, as they compete with each other for light and nutrients.  tl,dr; Moore is wrong about everything he as written, and this piece is hitting some of the common PR group taking points of the denialist industry, knowing that it will manipulate the reader."

True, and irrelevant to the discussion of whether CO2 is the cause of the current global warming.   Actually false: The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) stuff was based on this paper which had a 0 point of the Y axis based on temperatures 1880 to 1960. If you set the 0 point on temperature even as far back as 2011 then ALL OF THE data points on the ""warm"" graphs would be NEGATIVE.  So really the ""medieval warm period"" (MWP) should be called the ""warm period relative to 1960 and not today."" MWPRT1960ANT   See this video on the MWP fraud  for a really nice explanation. And when you look at how much CO2 has been dumped into the atmosphere since 1960 you can see why climate fraudsters like Lindzen piss all over themselves to cut out data post 1980 or so"

badscience,3aombk,freeogy,5,Mon Jun 22 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"I use this script when I deal with family/friends/colleagues who express similar views. First: Realize that you can't argue facts with a person who came to their conclusions from emotions and supported by bullshit mountain news. Reason does not work.   So before you start, the important thing to remember is that your first and only goal is to get them to move slightly away from their source of facts, out of the spot that their emotions tells them is comfortable. That's very tough.   Ok? So here's the process:   1 . Ask them what they use for their source of news. (usually FOX)  2 . Ask them how they can trust a source of news that repeatedly does things like take a video showing a person saying one thing and edit the video to make it appear as if they said the exact OPPOSITE. Essentially taking ""No I didn't"" and cutting it to say ""I did""    If they are sane/rational they will respond with something like ""I can't believe they would ever do that.""    3 . Then, and this is the key part, sit down with them and show them this video: http://mediamatters.org/research/200905010049 . And then focus on ""this is bad right?"" ""Pretty clear, right""  Points: They might comment that this is from media matters, just say that the original video is from CSPAN and FOX, all you/mediamatters are doing is playing them side by side.   The fact that it is for a source the CSPAN uncut tape and the fox uncut tape make a HUGE impact. You can get through the ""oh the liberal media"" stuff but just saying ""this is just uncut raw video"" you can make your own judgment.  The response after the video has always been a mental gear shift, and if that's all it takes then you can start the process of discussions. But until you break that emotional hideout they will keep listening to fox/limbaugh with a trusting ear. You have to train them to not trust FOX.  4 . In some cases they come back with the talking point ""Oh this is just O'Reily - I just watch him for fun, not the facts, you can't find this in the news section."" Again once they've said this - you still have a chance of talking to them because you've now popped their info bubble. And if they do come back with that talking point, then I show them this http://mediamatters.org/blog/201101030036  So there you go. It's worked pretty reliably for me, best of luck to you."

New Scientist, a science magazine, criticized Conservapedia's views on relativity and responded to several of Conservapedia's arguments against it.  Against Conservapedia's statements, New Scientist stated that one is unlikely to find a single physicist that would claim that the theory of general relativity is the whole answer to how the universe works, and said that the theory of relativity has passed every test that the theory has been put through.  :1     Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

However, there is much debate among scholars as to whether or not Irigaray's theory of sexual difference is, indeed, an essentialist one. The perception that Luce Irigaray's work is essentialist concentrates on her attention to sexual difference, taking this to constitute a rehearsal of heteronormative sexuality. As Helen Fielding states, the uneasiness among feminists about Irigaray’s discussion of masculinity and femininity does not so much reveal Irigaray’s heteronormative bias, but ""arises out of an inherited cultural understanding [on the part of her critics] that posits nature as either unchanging organism or as matter that can be ordered, manipulated and inscribed upon. Hence the concern over essentialism is itself grounded in the binary thinking that preserves a hierarchy of...culture over nature.""      Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

badscience,3970zp,TaylorS1986,8,Wed Jun 10 04:22:50 2015 UTC,"Ailuridae:       Ailuridae is a family in the mammal order Carnivora. The family comprises the red panda (the sole living representative) and its extinct relatives.  Frédéric Georges Cuvier first described Ailurus as belonging to the raccoon family in 1825; this classification has been controversial ever since.  It was classified in the raccoon family (Procyonidae) because of morphological similarities of the head, colored ringed tail, and other morphological and ecological characteristics. Then, it was assigned to the bear family (Ursidae).  Molecular phylogenetic studies show that, as an ancient species in the order Carnivora, the Red Panda is relatively close to the American Raccoon and may be either a monotypic family or a subfamily within the procynonid family.    An in-depth mitochondrial DNA population analysis study  stated: “According to the fossil record, the Red Panda diverged from its common ancestor with bears about 40 million years ago (Mayr 1986). With this divergence, by comparing the sequence difference between the red panda and the raccoon, the observed mutation rate for the red panda was calculated to be on the order of 109, which is apparently an underestimate compared with the average rate in mammals.  This underestimation is probably due to multiple recurrent mutations as the divergence between the red panda and the raccoon is extremely deep.”    Image i     Interesting: Alopecocyon | Musteloidea | Red panda   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

I don't know; the result is so unbelievable that maybe the methodology of FooDS itself could be considered bad science.

As a Colorado resident, the lack of evidence based standards utterly befuddled me (and kind of frustrated me) when marijuana was legalized recreationally.   I had given the medical movement the benefit of the doubt, but walking into a licensed seller in the first week I was met with the same marketing I got from my high-school friends a decade before - deriving physiological effects from strains (the classification of strains itself being based on plant structure rather than terpene or cannabinoid profile), strain names (which is arbitrary) and sticky weed = good. I guess I just thought that the medicinal crowd would have been on top of getting cannabinoid profiles, terpene profiles, and attempting to correlate likely physiological effects based upon cannabinoid ratios. I mean - I don't doubt that marijuana can be a medicine, but it just strengthened the perception that the medical movement was largely a proxy for legalization as a whole.  Also - full disclosure - I'm not against that tactic for activists. I consider prohibition to be an utter failure when ti comes to societal health and well-being and believe a focus on medicinal rhetoric and arguments is a justifiable tactic to ending prohibition altogether."
badscience,36gaej,Bosco_Sauce,5,Tue May 19 07:41:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with your main point, that the cannabis industry lacks a lot of evidence-based standards.  You would think that there ought to be a model which exists to correlate cannabinoid and terpene profiles to the psychological effects of a particular sample of cannabis, especially given that the ratios for a particular strain can vary slightly from grow to grow due to environmental factors, but IIRC no detailed model exists.  However a particular strain, or varietal of cannabis is based, not on its plant structure, but on the lineage of the plants going back to the landrace strains.  The landrace strains, while differentiated by plant structure, are not exclusively different in that way.  Consider the difference between beefsteak tomatoes and cherry tomatoes, the difference in the cannabinoid profiles between the landrace strains exists, and breeders exploit that.    Unfortunately, there is no independent organization which verifies, or even has a standardized lineage of plants (although a startup in Oregon will offer this service through genetic testing in the future).  So, I'd suggest taking any strain name with a pinch of salt, given that it requires a lot of trust in the genetics every parent plant of that plant.  The biggest differentiator between strains is the sleepy indica like OG Kush, and the awake sativa like Green Crack.  Both of those leafly pages feature cannabinoid profiles, and it's pretty clear that the sativa has a much lower content of other cannabinoids.  This is a pretty common pattern, but I've never seen any research going further into it.  On other psychological effects, I would take that with a very heavy punch of salt, especially given that it has been shown that people who are high on marijuana are more suggestible than when they're sober.  This means that without performing a double blind study on the psychological effects of a particular cannabinoid profile then it's very difficult to verify the claims that are made.  On another note: any retail marijuana should be sticky from cannabinoid buildup on the buds.  Saying sticky = good is like saying bubbly beer = good. You expect it, and if it isn't that way then there's probably a good reason as to why.  There are a lot of black market indicators of quality which have seeped into the legal market: stickiness, shine, smell, lack of seeds, etc..  You don't try to burn your vodka to check its proof, you just look at the bottle, and in the same way you can see the cannabinoid profile printed right on the container of legal marijuana.  Honestly speaking, I feel like the marijuana industry is still very much stuck in a prohibition-era mentality, and that's largely due to the lack of regulation that medical marijuana enjoys.  For example, legal marijuana doesn't even have an expiration date.  Nobody sat down and studied the effect of stored bud over time to determine when it should no longer be sold, or if they did, they haven't influenced policymakers to invoke it as a requirement.  The lack of regulation in the medical marijuana industry meant that new-age healers, herbalists, stoners with medical problems, and science-based doctors all had equal footing to promote their products.  My hope is that widespread legalization will pull the people who don't care about science away from the medical label and the real research will surface while the woo research will fade.  If you're interested in the existing research, I know the Granny Storm Crow list is a list of scientific papers which relate to medical marijuana."
badscience,36gaej,feembly,2,Fri May 22 07:14:23 2015 UTC,"Great post. I appreciate the response and it's awesome to see some cannabinoid profiles on leafly.   On the topic of stickiness - this sort of relates to the issue of storage, and the potential for mold. My understanding has been that the stickier the weed, the poorer (or more rushed) the curing process was. I suspect that this might have been part of the issue here in Colorado with dispensaries as I went in the first week of them opening for recreational sales and they were all having trouble keeping up with demand.  Ultimately, I'm optimistic that actors in this market that utilize evidence based methods will find a strong foothold, and the woo-woo will be easier and easier to spot."

The claim that no one who smokes develops lung cancer is just insane. That would suggest smoking cannabis would be the absolute best protector against neoplasias. The statement ""cannabis smoking or ingestion is not significantly related to lung cancer"" might be true if properly sourced. Saying if you smoke you for sure, 100 percent, well never ever get cancer is snake oil. Unless something prevents genetic mutation completely it can't 100% prevent cancer from developing.

badscience,36eik7,Triplanetary,8,Tue May 19 02:10:18 2015 UTC,"I'm bored, so I'll attempt a rule 1 on each of the points   This seems to be a flawed understanding of the Many Worlds Interpretation of QM. The MWI is an attempt to get around the measurement problem associated with wavefunction collapse. It strictly applies to 'quantum' phenomena, and as yet nobody as come up with a plausible way in which a quantum outcome could affect something like a human choice. The Big Bang doesn't state that there was a big explosion and then the universe came out of nothing. Rather, it states that the universe began as an expansion of an already existing extremely dense and hot state, which is not nothing. The theory of relativity doesn't state that time travel is possible. It does explain (experimentally observed) time dilation, but as yet there is no experimentally confirmed theory that allows time travel into the past. This is philosophy, so it is definitely bad science.Just joking Freud did indeed propose the Oedipus complex, but it is now widely criticised as a theory for making few testable predictions. It does not feature heavily in modern psychology, having been supplant by ideas such as Parent-Offspring Conflict (n.b. I'm not by any means knowledgeable about psychology, so if this is wrong please correct me) Again philosophy. Ditto Ditto Oh boy. Schrödinger's Cat gets my vote for the most misunderstood thought experiment ever. Firstly, it was a thought experiment. Schrödinger at no point actually attempted to poison a cat. Secondly, here they use the Copenhagen Interpretation, which states that wavefunction collapse actually occurs. This is definitely a point of contention in physics, and leads to the aforementioned measurement problem. Thirdly, wavefunction applies to a wide range of objects, not just nuclei. Fourthly, even if superposition could apply to something like a human, the superposition would not survive measurement (the person would either be alive or dead) and would definitely not result in zombies.   The rest are philosophy bar the last point, 'great glaciation theory'. It doesn't have a wiki article, so I'm having to source it based on the quora post that most of this article was taken from. To quote:   Great glaciation is the theory of the final state that our universe is heading toward. The universe has a limited supply of energy. According to this theory, when that energy finally runs out, the universe will devolve into a frozen state. Heat energy produced by the motion of the particles, heat loss, a natural law of the universe, means that eventually this particle motion will slow down and, presumably, one day everything will stop.   This is either an incredibly stupid theory (conservation of energy rules out the concept of the energy in the universe running out) or a bad misunderstanding of the heat death of the universe in which, due to the laws of thermodynamics, the universe eventually reaches some maximum entropy state, and it no longer becomes possible to do anything, as entropy cannot increase further."

There are a bunch of people espousing bad science there, though surprisingly some are countermanding it.   Just to play devils advocate... ""Gravity"" (which itself is just a theory) is more powerful than a vacuum?   I didn't think you'd see the ""just a 'theory'"" logic outside of creationists talking about Evolution, but I guess there's a first time for everything. Yes, our understanding of gravity (Newtonian Gravity, General Relativity) are theories. But right now General Relativity, as a model, is so strongly supported by evidence that you can't just dismiss it as speculation.  Also, gravity is very strong when mass is huge, but we'll get into that later in the post when the discussion of the relative weakness of gravity comes up.   Yes, Gravity IS a theory. That is science. It's well-defined and predictable (on earth) so I've never said the theory of gravity isn't legit, but if you have evidence to ""prove"" gravity than why not go make a million as the top scientist of our day?    lol. There are several things wrong here. We've had Newtonian mechanics  and General Relativity predict gravitational effects well outside the Earth, from the motions of the planets to the prediction of Neptune to the discovery of black holes via stellar orbits. Our understanding of gravity is one of the most important tools in space sciences. Also, a theory is the highest level of certainty (can I use that word?) in science. There is no 'prove.'   Gravity is their magical word created by knighted freemason Issac Newton to ""explain"" anything that doesn't fit into the heliocentric world view. Gravity is weaker than any other force and there is no explanation where it came from. Gravity from the moon supposedly effects the tides but not lakes and ponds   So, a second guy shows up espousing that gravity is a conspiracy. Yes, gravity is relatively weak compared to electromagnetism in the scale of everyday life. However, he's wrong when he says it's weaker than the other forces in general. The Strong and Weak Nuclear forces are hilariously weak at a non-quantum scale. Not to mention that at the scale of General Relativity, the gravitational force is insanely strong. I mean, look at a neutron star, where gravity is so strong that the collapse inward of the star is only stopped by the Pauli Exclusion principle (the neutrons, being fermions, can't exist in the same space at the same time), which is best describe as ""Sorry Gravity, you've won enough already. Time to cut everyone a break."" Or let's talk about Black Holes, where light can't even escape.  Simply looking at the force strength in general without understanding that you have to take scale and charge (mass, electric, color) involved is silliness and doesn't give you the whole picture.  Of course, we're probably dealing with someone who thinks that none of these even exist, so there's really no help I guess.   Gravity from the moon supposedly effects the tides but not lakes and ponds   No Tides in Lakes and Rivers you say? Sorry, but you're wrong. There are tides in lakes and rivers. They're very minuscule though. so much so that regular motion is larger.   Truth is there is no ""vacuum"" in space. The moon landing/space travel is a giant hoax. People only parrot answers like ""Gravity"" because they hear their high priests like Neil DeGrasse Tyson or Bill Nye say it.   lol. Okay. I mean if everything is a hoax then I guess I'm really just wasting my time here.   It's funny after you think about it that we believe that at some magical point in the sky ""gravity"" just disappears. So could you theoretically have half of your body on the gravity side and the other half on the non-gravity side? It's ridiculous the ""scientific"" lies that we've been fed.   That's not how it works at all. Gravity is a universal force that gets smaller the farther out you get. This isn't just in Newtonian gravity, either. The curvature of spacetime in General Relativity gets smaller and smaller as you get farther out, becoming negligible farther away. That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, or that you'll be half in the gravity portion.   I know that is the theory but it has never been reproduced or proven.   I mean if you're just going to declare everything is a lie and declare all evidence presented to you is a lie then there's really nothing anyone here can do."

Now, I may have only taken up to a year of organic, so correct me if I'm wrong, but a compound is a mixture of chemicals. Does the fig magically compartmentalize it's chemicals into these cancer fighting compounds? How did researchers isolate and determine the properties if these magic compounds? Do the individual chemicals that make up the compounds have anti cancer properties themselves?  And more puzzling, is that apparently these magic compounds are new. Not newly discovered, but new. This would suggest that figs have recently evolved this property. What caused them to evolve that? Were they naturally selected for fighting human breast cancer?   Now, a plant with chemicals that work as cancer treatments isn't unheard of, e.g. taxol. But the fact that these work on human cancer is more a fortunate coincidence of evolution than anything else. For a plant to evolve nine different compounds (not individual chemicals! mind you) that specifically fight human breast cancer would be a coincidence so unlikely that divine intervention would be more likely an explanation than isolated evolution.   Aromatics, such as the phenols mentioned, do work somewhat as a method of cancer prevention. There are over two hundred separate diseases that are lumped in as ""cancer"" but are generally marked by unchecked reproduction of cells. This is generally accepted to be the result of damaged DNA, where the cell has lost it's regulatory functions. DNA is a relatively fragile molecule, and despite the numerous mechanisms to protect it, can easily be damaged by certain chemicals. Free radicals, or similar charges particles can easily damage DNA, but aromatics readily absorb many of them. However, once the cancer has started, no about of aromatics will cure it.   Also, the suggestion that they're able to reduce the size of cancer would imply these magic compounds are able to actually kill cancer cells. The problem with killing cancer cells is that they're similar enough to regular cells that the body can't differentiate between them and regular cells. The ideal cancer fighting medicine would be one that can differentiate between healthy and cancerous cells. I don't know enough about cancer treatments to offer more, besides the fact that the suggestion that magic fig juice can tell between regular cells and unhealthy ones is kind of silly.   This started as a snarky comment, but long airport lines turned it into an attempt at R1."

One that has high metabolism (let's call it -100 calories) and one that has low metabolism (let's call it +100 calories). They are both on 2000 calorie diets.

To truly gain weight you have to eat above your TDEE consistently and eat above it as it increases due to the addition of body mass (I. E. Getting fat)."

As others have pointed out, thermodynamics / CICO is, for the most part, absolutely correct and metabolism doesn't make a huge amount of difference- plus it's quite rare that it would be hugely different. I've written for local news before about obesity taking advice from a few friends who are biologists/chemists and my gf is a human bioscientist so I understand the actual weight side of things is quite simple, but as a social scientist, I sympathise with fat people because it's so simple- these people clearly have eating disorders. Heck, a few years ago, I had a drug habit that meant I couldn't eat without taking drugs. Once I kicked the habit, I was anorexic for a little while and then suddenly had binge eating disorder. Went from underweight to overweight in less than 6 months. Point is, I'm procrastinating from writing a paper on globalisation."

And there are certainly socio-economic factors which drive the poor in the US to eat a high caloric diet.  But the largest factor is discipline or self-control.  Someone who isn't as disciplined as others with regards to caloric intake gain weight (I'm guilty of this), and is at least partially their fault.

badscience,35v1s3,Shane_the_P,-4,Wed May 13 20:49:57 2015 UTC,"See that's where I disagree with you. Most people don't like to say it, but sugar is addictive. Glucose in your brain has a similar affect as heroine in terms of dopamine (I believe it's this hormone). Over time, eating a very refined carb diet is going to lead to constant high blood sugar and insulin resistance. I mean basically you are becoming addicted to sugar and becoming prediabetic at the same time. That addiction will drive future behavior to continue to eat poorly. That is the reason adults today are obese, not lack of self control. I want to be clear, I'm not saying that all obese people are not at fault for their own condition because they can always decide to get out. But I think like any addiction, it starts with education and help. There is a reason most people that are addicted to drugs have a tough time getting off of them. I think as a nation we are behind the curve in telling people what a healthy diet is."

I lost a ton of weight eating a low carb diet and I never counted a calorie. Was I eating at a deficient? Maybe, but the point of that diet is to get body chemistry on track so you can listen to it in the same way you would about thirst. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that there is more going on in the body than just simple calorie counting even tho that is a way to lose weight."
badscience,35v1s3,JonnyRichter,14,Wed May 13 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"There is, but those other processes have little to do with gaining or losing weight.  You didn't count calories but you cut carbohydrates, which is the greatest source of extra American calories.  Body chemistry is complex, but with regards to weight gain or loss, it is fundamentally CICO.  Eating a healthy diet (i.e. satisfying those bio chemical needs) and losing weight are not mutually exclusive.  Shit I lost a lot of weight using the old booger-sugar weight loss program, I would never say it was the right or healthy way."
badscience,35v1s3,Das_Mime,-6,Wed May 13 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"Well I won't go into what I think about diet because I know it is a very contentious topic on the internet but I think it isn't as linked to CICO as everyone believe. In Gary Taubes book Good Calories, Bad Calories, he has two chapters called ""Paradoxes"" and ""Hunger"" where he talks about many studies that have looked at the effects of over eating. They concluded that the body isn't just a calculator. The people ate a lot in excess and based on the simple CICO calculation, they all should have gain about the same amount (I forget the number). What they found is that some people gained like 3 lbs, some like 30. Now they all did gain weight, that is true, but the point was to illustrate that hormones really are a bigger factor than just energy content.  In ""hunger"" they starved people and found basically the reverse phenomena.  Maybe at the core it really is CICO, but honestly there are so many factors to consider I really think people should focus less on calories, and more on macros. I know this isn't a popular opinion and I'm sure I'm going to get lambasted for it here."

I mean maybe the gut flora is the real answer but it seems like it could just be a side effect."

badscience,35gqn4,archiesteel,15,Sun May 10 13:24:29 2015 UTC,"Nazism would require me to be a socialist, which I am not.   It would not. While there were some elements of socialism in the Nazi Party's original platform, there were all pretty much thrown out the window when Hitler came into power.  In the reality of Nazi rule, as opposed to the philosophical musings of the early National Socialists, actual Socialists and Communists were sent to death camps, and there were much more privatizations of state corporations than there were nationalizations of private ones.  Finally, Nazism is a racist and sexist philosophy, which puts it completely at odds with the egalitarianism of Socialist political movements.  So, no, being a Nazi would not require you to be a socialist. In fact, you wouldn't be able to be a Nazi if you were a socialist. The last who tried were killed in the Night of the Long Knives."

badscience,35gqn4,Caligapiscis,49,Sun May 10 13:40:42 2015 UTC,"partial Rule 1:   The number of vertebrae[2]   No. This is just not true. A normal human spinal column, regardless of ethnicity, has 33 vertebrae. Now, I'm not a doctor, but as far as I can tell, the HIGHLY RELIABLE SOURCE doesn't actually claim that there are different numbers of vertebrae, only that there are some variations in structure between the ""White"" and ""Colored"" races.    Metabolism   I don't have any knowledge about this topic, so an expert should probably chime in. I do tend, however, to be more than a bit suspicious of a paper that refers to ""Oriental placidity"" .   Eye and hair color  Height   Yes, there are differences in average height and the frequency of light pigmentation between races. That's not evidence that the particular way we have chosen to divide the world up into races isn't arbitrary. Consider Europeans as an example. You would see the exact same patterns if you divided them into a ""Nordic"" and ""Mediterranean"" race, as was popular among certain unfortunate elements of the early 20th century. ""Mediterranean"" people have darker skin, a higher incidence of dark eyes and hair, and are shorter on average.    Consistency of earwax[4]   From the source: ""They also found in East Asians, a mutation of the gene that prevents the molecule that makes earwax wet, from entering the mix.  BBC News (2006) summarized the Yoshiura et al (2006) study suggesting that dry earwax is seen in up to 95% of East Asians, but in no more than 3% of people of European and African origin.   Populations in Southern Asia, the Pacific Islands, Central Asia, Asia Minor, and Native North Americans and those of Asian ancestry, fall in the middle with dry wax incidence ranging from 30 to 50 percent.""  So a single gene, which is present in somewhere in the 50-80% range in Asians, because looking up population numbers on google is too hard for me right now, is evidence that Asian is a meaningful racial classification. Once again, another equally arbitrary division could show the exact same effect: why not separate East Asians into their own race? After all, the gap between 95% and 50% incidence is of a comparable magnitude to the gap between 50% and 3% incidence. It's almost as if human populations are continuous.    The size of the brain and IQ   This is a wikipedia link to Race and Intelligence, which has this to say on the matter: "" While several environmental factors have been shown to affect group differences in intelligence, it has not been demonstrated that they can explain the entire disparity. On the other hand, no genetic factor has been conclusively shown to have a causal relation with group difference in intelligence test scores.""  In other words, no, this is not proof that there are inherent racial IQ gaps, or even particularly strong evidence.    Risk of genetic diseases[6]   Once again, yes, this is a result of the fact that races are more or less geographically contiguous. Returning to the Nordic/Mediterranean split, we find that Mediterranean people have a higher risk of sickle cell anemia, while Nordic people have a higher risk for certain forms of heart disease  Does this mean that this is an inherently more valid division of humanity? No, of course not. I would be shocked if it were even possible to divide the world up into multiple geographically continuous regions where disease risk was constant.    Capacity to delay gratification, likely linked with IQ[7]   Yay, wikipedia again. This time, Delayed Gratification. Ctrl-f returns zero results for race. Zero results for black. Zero results for asian. One result for white- someone's name. Zero results for ethnicity. Zero results for ethnic. Zero results for racial. Zero results for african. Zero results for latina, latino, latin, or hispanic.    Propensity to commit crime, also strongly linked with IQ[8]   This is the wikipedia page of a white nationalist group. A choice quote   Taylor advocates segregation as a natural expression of racial solidarity while denying that his views constitute white supremacism.   He has a bachelor's in philosophy from Yale, which I would hope means he really ought to know better, but he ascribes higher crime rates among African Americans to genetic inferiority, despite the abundant evidence that poverty correlates strongly with crime and being black. Admittedly, the SPLC is a political organization, not a scientific journal, but I think it's fair to say that they're a far more reliable source than a white nationalist. Also, I'm running out of time. I may dig up things from JSTOR at a later time.    Gestation period[9]   http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/1/107.full http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8438913  Looks like this one is probably true. Still doesn't mean racism is ok.    Age of puberty and speed of puberty   https://etd.library.emory.edu/view/record/pid/emory:93gt8  This one looks reasonably legitimate as well. I would be very surprised if Emory let someone bullshit a phd thesis. But let me reiterate: still does not justify racism."

While reality probably does indeed look like this, I don't see why that statement on its own couldn't also be compatible with a population that looked like this. In that later case, it seems like it could actually be true both that Africa has much larger genetic diversity and that African populations can be sensibly said to be distinct from others.

In his defense on this, I think it's easy for people who have no medical training to confuse ""herd immunity"" with ""herd mentality""   Vitamin d3 helps the immune system, but vaccine propenents don't push for supplementation.   Part of that is because dietary supplements, like vitamin D3, are listed by the FDA as 'food products' rather than anything medical, which means (for the most part) as long as what you're selling hasn't been proven dangerous and you aren't making false medical claims, you can sell what ever you want. I'm pretty sure a few groups have looked through herbal supplements and found that most contain very little of the listed product. That milk thistle you're taking for your liver (an untested medical claim purported by brofessors) may contain no actual milk thistle. Not positive, but I imagine that same level of honesty extends to vitamins.   If vaccines are 99% effective, why would people oppose some people refusing to take the vaccine?

Moreover, the statement he made doesn’t make any sense from a statistical point of view. Some people are more predisposed to certain conditions than others.    Healing has to be Whole Person Healing (WPH). This is now scientifically accepted by the IOM in the U.S., thanks to Professor Rustum Roy’s efforts. Organs cannot be treated in isolation. In a dynamic system, prediction is impossible unless we know the total initial state of the organism. Writing in the British Medical Journal, Professor W.J. Firth, the physicist, shows how foolish it is for doctors to predict the unpredictable future of their patients. (BMJ 1991; 303: 1565)   Rustum Roy was a material scientist who believed in Homeopathy. And no, IOM hasn’t scientifically accepted the WPH mumbo jumbo.

Weather predictions do not come true correctly.   WTF does this have to with cancer?    Scientists and rationalists condemn our poor astrologers for seeking to predict human future. I agree with them there. But the same people do not condemn this kind of quackery? Why are there such double standards? In fact, the latter is more dangerous as it is done in the name of “Science”.

Men are more interested in things and rule systems, and women are more interested in people and living things, but only on average.  Biomedical engineering is a subject involving living things and helping people, which women are more interested in on average, but it is also a discipline with underlying rule systems and objects so it also attracts more men who are more interested in rule systems and objects on average. Biomedical engineering is bound to attract both sexes but the exact numbers will depend on how heavily each factor attracts a particular proportion of each sex, among other factors. This would be extremely difficult to measure and calculate with precision, but suffice it to say that the numbers would not be anywhere close to 100-0 in favor of either sex for a field like biomedical engineering. Finally, even if biomedical engineering was based purely on empathy and not at all on socialization as you sarcastically suggested, that would cause female representation to go far higher than 50% (and also far higher than the ~67% or similar percentage of the university population that is female). We see this with fields like veterinary medicine which has a graduation rate of ~85%-90% female students, which should not be a surprise given that veterinary medicine is a field that is based highly in empathy for animals. Even the 5-10% of veterinarians who are male are more likely (not completely likely) to be involved in working with ugly, dirty, and massive animals like cows than with house pets."

I was talking with the dean of the college of engineering about this, the BME department has far and away way more women both in raw numbers and by ratio compared to the other engineering departments which is a statistical anamoly worth investigating.

badscience,31ebrl,freeogy,-22,Sat Apr 4 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"But in all seriousness, a skewed gender representation in a field indicates that there may be some pressure or something on the less represented gender.   Is this something that needs to have evidence for it, or should it be taken on faith? It may mean that, but does it mean that? By the way, pressure on one gender may also exist without actually causing lower representation for that gender.    I was talking with the dean of the college of engineering about this, the BME department has far and away way more women both in raw numbers and by ratio compared to the other engineering departments which is a statistical anamoly worth investigating.   It has been investigated. As I mentioned elsewhere, the evidence suggests that women are more interested in living things/people (and helping people) than men, and this explains a significant proportion (probably a majority) of the difference. In this context specifically, men are more interested in abstract rule systems and working with objects than women which explains the general engineering trend, and the addition of biology and healthcare makes it relatively more attractive to women.   The only question now is whether you are willing to take the results of these investigations at face value or if you were only interested in the ""pressure"" conclusion to begin with. If you'd like me to give you sources for all of this then I am more than willing to do that.  P.S. There is evidence that women face pressure in STEM in Western countries but it's pressure for them to study STEM coming from their family and mentors. When these women switch out of STEM they tend to describe their original choice as a pressured one and tend to cite a lack of interest or a greater interest in another subject as the reason for switching."
badscience,31ebrl,ParanthropusBoisei,25,Sat Apr 4 16:27:19 2015 UTC,"That's...not what the dean of engineering said. If the dean of engineering feels the need to investigate this disparity in terms of gender I will trust his judgement. And besides, you can argue easily that the rest of engineering is about helping people. Biomedical engineering is an amalgamation of the other engineering fields (most of the department professors are engineers in other fields), and is very much an abstract field men allegedly like so much and women allegedly dislike. Nothing in the field has you actually directly go and help people in a manner like healthcare. You design objects and drugs to assist healthcare providers. And in addition, there are a lot of women who like being in the college of biological sciences, which is fairly STEM and has a lot of abstraction too. Microbiology and biological chemistry seem to be popular for women, and that hardly is about working with people. The hypothesises you have don't hold up in practice and to claim otherwise is a bit disingenuous. The hypothesis of the College of Engineering of my university concerning this field is because of its relative infancy and as such lacks a systemic pressure against women. Biomedical Engineering is as Engineer-y as Mechanical and Electrical and Chemical Engineering, incorporating all the math and science that one needs in those fields, and the work you do as an actual healthcare provider is functionally nonexistent. To call it less abstract or object-oriented shows that you lack a proper understanding of what Biomedical Engineering actually is."
badscience,31ebrl,wcspaz,-19,Sat Apr 4 16:37:53 2015 UTC,"Please pay attention to the actual words I have been using. I have tried to be very careful to not use any absolute statements because they would be misleading and incorrect, but you seemed to have ignored that completely and instead read into my words what you wanted to disagree with. I have stuck completely to terms like ""more"", ""less"", ""more interested"" and ""less interested"", ""on average"", etc. to describe men and women because all of these are statistical phenomena that can't be described accurately with absolute statements.  Let me just reject the things you think I'm implying and then I will substitute it with the statistically accurate alternative.   And besides, you can argue easily that the rest of engineering is about helping people   Practically everything is about helping people in some way, but healthcare/biology is more about helping living things/people than regular engineering. (There's also the separate interest in interacting with living things/people vs. objects that applies here.)   Biomedical engineering is an amalgamation of the other engineering fields (most of the department professors are engineers in other fields), and is very much an abstract field men allegedly like so much and women allegedly dislike.   Biomedical engineering is less abstract than other engineering fields such as electrical engineering because it involves more practical concerns involved in medicine. Also, I never said that women ""dislike"" anything. I said men are more interested in abstract rule systems. That doesn't mean that women aren't interested in them.   And in addition, there are a lot of women who like being in the college of biological sciences, which is fairly STEM and has a lot of abstraction too. Microbiology and biological chemistry seem to be popular for women, and that hardly is about working with people.   Again, biology is less abstract than engineering. Women are more interested in working with living things.   Nothing in the field has you actually directly go and help people in a manner like healthcare. You design objects and drugs to assist healthcare providers.   You probably don't know this, but when people pick their career tracks they often consider what the functional value of their work is going to be and it is an important factor for them. When women and men describe what's important to them for their career choices, ""helping people"" is described more often by women than men. It is therefore no surprise that there would be a greater proportion of women in biomedical engineering compared to electrical engineering, for example."

Since you've made the suggestion that I am engaging in bad science, and presumably you have some better alternatives, I will give you an opportunity to showcase that to me and be more specific about my flawed arguments in the process. In the mean time I will clarify my actual views because you seem not to understand them based on what you've said. There are specific scientific ideas that make up the basis of what I am claiming. If you are not familiar with concepts like statistical variance, shared-environmental effects vs. non-shared environmental effects, and gene-environment interaction, you will not understand what I believe.   He also does not seem to understand that ""the actual psychological traits of men/women/individuals,"" as he calls them, are not simply given but are themselves heavily influenced by external factors.   Well, I mentioned that these traits are partly innate and I gave some basic evidence for that: fetal testosterone levels in the womb are predictive of systemizing vs. empathizing. The ironic thing is that you chide me for treating innate factors as ""simply given"", but here you doing precisely what you're accusing me of doing except for nurture instead of nature, and you provide no evidence at all. Let me respond with the equivalent statement back to you: it is not simply a given that psychological traits are heavily influenced by external factors. It happens to be true that ""external"" (environmental) factors heavily influence differences in psychological traits (for individuals within a population) but not for the reason you think. Socialization effects make up a minority of this influence. The majority of the environmental influence on individual psychological traits comes from the effects of randomness, both in brain development in utero and in random life events.  I actually have stronger evidence that the psychological traits of men/women/individuals are partly innate but I didn't include it in my previous comment because I felt like it would be a waste of time to pile on more science that I would have to explain. Since you're presenting yourself as someone who is scientifically literate you can read the science yourself or read my summary of it without any scientific explanation. If you respond by displaying misunderstandings of the science behind what I am saying then I will be forced to not take your response seriously.  The tl;dr of the research is that a majority of the variance in vocational interests *among individuals within a population is explained by genes, and therefore it follows logically that a majority of the gender difference in vocational interests is almost certainly explained by genes. (If genes explain much of the differences between individuals it probably explains a similar amount of the difference between those same individuals as groups.)  Here is a paper from the psychologist Linda Gottfredson summarizing some of the research behind what I am saying. Since it is quite old it doesn't include some new research that provides stronger evidence for these ideas but it's a good summary nonetheless.  Linda Gottfredson: The Nature and Nurture of Vocational Interests   It seems probable, for example, that the worldwide male-female differences in preferences for dealing with things versus people (and thus in Realistic versus Social activities) will be found to have some genetic underpinning. Such genetically influenced subgroup differences would have two important implications for counselors. First, the menus of experience -- the social environments -- that cultures provide to the two sexes probably differ partly for genetic reasons. (Recall that people's rearing environments are to some extent their ""extended phenotypes."") To the extent that gene environment correlations involving gender generalize to create cultural norms for gender socialization, they are probably targeted to the modal genotypes or average tendencies of a sex. But males and females differ enormously among themselves, so gender-based menus of experience, while perhaps serving the majority of both sexes tolerably well, may stunt the development of the many less typical members of each sex. If anything, then, genetically driven average gender differences in interests and other traits make it even more imperative that young people be exposed to a wide variety of environments. The differences between the subgroups should be respected, but so too should the individual differences within them."

Since you've made the suggestion that I am engaging in bad science, and presumably you have some better alternatives, I will give you an opportunity to showcase that to me and be more specific about my flawed arguments in the process.    Doesn't work like that, bub. I don't have to have shit for an opinion on this issue to be able to point out that your argument is garbage.   Well, I mentioned that these traits are partly innate and I gave some basic evidence for that: fetal testosterone levels in the womb are predictive of systemizing vs. empathizing.   All you did was link a subsection of a Wikipedia page that discussed ""fetal testosterone,"" you gave no indication of how it was supposed to be related to your argument.

Let me respond with the equivalent statement back to you: it is not simply a given that psychological traits are heavily influenced by external factors.   This is complete and utter nonsense. Absolutely nothing in my argument depends in any way on minimizing the role of heredity. Anyone can see this.   The tl;dr of the research is that a majority of the variance in vocational interests among individuals within a population is explained by genes, and therefore it follows logically that a majority of the gender difference in vocational interests is almost certainly explained by genes.   Literally no inference at all can be drawn about the relative roles of socialization and heredity from the part of this sentence that comes before ""and therefore it follows logically...""  Hilariously, one of the sources you yourself linked while grandstanding about how I don't understand the literature makes this point very clearly:   Nor do heritabilities say anything absolute about genetic influence on variability. Phenotypic variability, the denominator in calculating heritability, is the sum of variance due to genes and variance due to nongenetic factors. Reducing variability in relevant environments (say, through equalizing nutrition or opportunity) shrinks the denominator and thus necessarily increases the ratio comprising the heritability estimate. If we all lived in identical environments, heritabilities would be 1.0 because all remaining phenotypic differences among us would be genetic in origin.  Heritabilities, in other words, must be interpreted in context. They are always relative to the environment in which they were ascertained, which makes it very important to keep in mind the demographics and historical era of the population studied. Most studies have been carried out in the United States and Western Europe, and they have not sampled from the extremes of advantage or disadvantage in these settings. Heritabilities allow some inferences about the malleability of traits in the environments where they were ascertained, but they say little or nothing about the molding power of environments that were not captured in the research[.]   You big fat phoney."

Here it is again: fetal testosterone levels are predictive of the tendency to systemize vs. empathize, which is itself predictive of the choice to pursue STEM.

Besides being a strawman rebuttal of what I was suggesting, your sarcastic reply sets up a false dichotomy that either men and women should be equally represented in leadership positions or else women must be inferior. It doesn't allow for the possibility that men and women might differ (on average) in what makes them happy and therefore might differ in what choices they make to make themselves happy.  Your additional sarcastic suggestion that ""women innately want less money"" implies that wanting money exists in a vacuum. In fact, money is only one thing people value in trade-offs with other values like working conditions, job location, and personal rewards in a given field of work.  The truth is more complicated than your false dichotomy. First of all, there is no reason to think that men and women differ in wanting respect. This is completely irrelevant.  Secondly, men and women differ in their willingness to put themselves in danger and to tolerate uncomfortable working conditions in their work life. Since dangerous and uncomfortable jobs pay more than safe and comfortable ones, job choices are always a trade-off between money, danger, and comfort, among other things.  Thirdly, the major reason that women make less money than men on average in the United States is not any of these factors. The major factor is the fields of work that people choose to go into, which again involves a trade-off between money and personal rewards on the job.  Fourth, none of the above is especially important to understand why men are more prevalent than women in leadership positions. There are obviously several factors but the main one (in modern Western countries) is that men and women differ in how much they value status and power and how much they are willing to sacrifice other parts of their lives to achieve those ends. This has nothing to do with whether women or men are ""superior"" to the other sex and it has everything to do with the fact that men and women have average differences in what is fulfilling to them in their lives.   (This is also not to say that discrimination against women does not exist. It is to say that this discrimination does not explain the gender difference in leadership positions.)"

I think you have a very sloppy view of what sexism is.  First of all, the belief (or scientific claim) that men and women as groups do not have identical interests is not sexist, just like it's not sexist to believe that men and women as groups do not have identical sexual orientations. These are claims that are either true or false (or more true or more false), and that can be discovered or falsified by research, not by anger.  Second of all, my claim is not sexist against women any more than it is sexist against men. That conclusion would only come from the assumption (you apparently made) that interests in STEM are somehow ""better"" than interests in other subjects, which is a very problematic assumption in itself. It is actually sexist against women to make that assumption as you did because it implies that women would not be good enough unless they were identical to men in given way. I'm sure you don't think of yourself as a sexist but I don't think you realized what unchecked sexist assumption you were holding that is at least a little bit sexist against women.   I personally reject that assumption completely. I do not believe that men's activities are some kind of measuring stick that women have to live up to in order for them not to be considered inferior. (That would be a double standard if it were true, because when men don't live up to women's activities in society that same assumption isn't made to cast men as inferior.) Instead, what I believe is that the ways in which men and women differ in their interests (and in other similar traits) don't imply that either sex is somehow ""better"" than the other in any way, shape, or form."

If that was the idea that you were referring to by saying that this entire thread is full of evidence for it, I don't see what anywhere.

Even the one paper that you just mention that is marginally relevant doesn't prove your point as its whole premise is based on the assumption that opportunity is equal.   Actually, no. Not only does my claim not rely on the assumption that opportunity is equal, it better not because I don't believe that opportunity is equal. I believe that equal opportunity by gender is fairly close to equal in 2015, but it's not there yet. My claim, if you understood it, is that inequal opportunity does not explain gender differences in career choices, because those choices can be explained mostly by differences in individuals' psychological traits (mostly in interests) even after you control for family upbringing."

If you agree that ""feminine"" work isn't inferior to ""masculine"" work, then how is it fair that ""feminine"" work gets paid so much less? Why shouldn't our culture value skilled, female-dominated professions like schoolteaching and social work and therapy enough to demand more of their labor and pay them better, and to make their education and training more rigorous and professionalized? Why should we just let women be their less-competitive selves when it comes to raises and promotions, rather than training them to be more aggressive in order to compete more effectively?

You certainly are vaguely getting on to something that has been mostly cast away by the modern feminist movement due to fears of biological essentialism (arguably to its detriment), and it's called cultural feminism. It's a legitimate branch of feminist theory, and one you may find interesting.

badscience,31ebrl,Marlowe3142,0,Tue Apr 7 08:05:28 2015 UTC,"your dismissive attitude towards activism to narrow the pay gap still betrays quite a bit of moral callousness.   No, that doesn't logically follow. I bet you would be dismissive of activism to narrow the ""gender height gap"" but it would not be because of moral callousness. It would be because of moral clarity and an understanding of the empirical facts about gender and height. (And if somebody then claimed that you must not care about malnourished little girls, that would not follow logically either.)  My dismissive attitude towards the current brand of activism to narrow the pay ""gap"" is based in my best empirical understanding of the relationship between gender, work, and pay, and it is that knowledge that informs my moral concerns about those topics. My moral concerns also derive from my values, which in turn are partly informed by my best understanding. (And just because my moral concerns and conclusions don't match your moral concerns and conclusions does not mean that I am morally callous. That conclusion of yours could only derive from your own sense of self-righteousness, as if someone must be morally callous if they disagree with you.)  That being said, let me attempt to address your questions as best I can before I comment further. I won't even have time to get much into my actual views because I'll have to shed all of the accusatory false views you've pushed onto me.   If you agree that ""feminine"" work isn't inferior to ""masculine"" work, then how is it fair that ""feminine"" work gets paid so much less?   Although I think it's largely (but not completely) fair that in general female-typical work tends to pay less than male-typical work, I don't necessarily believe that this is a good thing. (I make a distinction between fair and good which you apparently don't.)   Why shouldn't our culture value skilled, female-dominated professions like schoolteaching and social work and therapy enough to demand more of their labor and pay them better, and to make their education and training more rigorous and professionalized?   I think there are some false premises about how the job market and the economy works within this question, but I'll just assume that they are true so I can address the question. My answer is: I don't know, why not? Why are you asking me this question as if I've said something that remotely goes against it?   Why should we just let women be their less-competitive selves when it comes to raises and promotions, rather than training them to be more aggressive in order to compete more effectively?   I don't know, why are you asking me this question as if I ever implied that ""training women to be more aggressive"" would not be a good thing? If I implied anything it was that training women in this way would definitely not be fair, although I have no idea whether it would be good. (This is the fair/good distinction again.) A fair solution would treat everyone as an individual, so every less-competitive individual would be ""trained"" regardless of gender. A solution that ""trains"" people based on their membership in a group is fundamentally unfair (but still possibly good).   Why should we live under a system that presents us with such a stark opportunity cost between work and family?   This is one topic where I am fairly certain that it would be a very good thing (especially in America) to increase the integration of work and family life for employees (at the expense of employers).   Do you think it is fair that men don't get to see their families and women lose out on so much pay and social prestige?   If you're referring to the pattern that men tend to work to provide for their families while women tend to have to take time off work for family, yes I think this is (largely) fair, and no I don't think this is a good thing. I think it's a pretty bad pattern/system.   something that has been mostly cast away by the modern feminist movement due to fears of biological essentialism (arguably to its detriment), and it's called cultural feminism. It's a legitimate branch of feminist theory, and one you may find interesting.   No, I find it very uninteresting for at least two reasons. One is for its implicit suggestion that emotional reasoning is complementary to objective thought, and worse that women should embrace this. The second is that, like most popular branches of current/modern feminism, it emphasizes group identity and de-emphasizes individuality.   However, you don't seem to be very committed to the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes in light of these biological differences, which, seeing as that is the definition of feminism, does in fact imply that you are being an anti-feminist.   You don't seem to understand much at all about the moral/political views that I actually have which should be expected because I haven't really stated them. All I've done is stated the ones that I think are wrongheaded. Worse, on topics for which I have no strong opinions or no opinions at all, you seem eager to tell me what views I have or to question me in an accusatory manner to imply that I might hold certain views that you don't like (and, it turns out, that I don't really like either).  If you want to understand my actual views, and you clearly don't, you will have to do a few things. First, you will have to learn about a few distinctions I make between certain concepts that you apparently don't make. For example:   There is a distinction between a ""gap"" and a ""difference"". (Both of them can exist at the same time on top of each other.) Alternatively, this can be thought of as a distinction between ""parity"" and ""equality"". (Equality is not used in the mathematicians sense, it is used in the political sense.) There is a distinction between what is fair and what is good. (These can be one in the same or they can conflict with one another, depending on the issue.) There is a distinction between individuality and group identity   Second, you will have to learn to separate the scientific claims, questions, and issues from the moral and political claims, questions, and issues and not confuse them for one another. Generally this happens when certain claims are evaluated in the context of two fallacies:   The naturalistic fallacy: what is natural/true is what is good. The moralistic fallacy: what is good or ought to be true is what is natural/true.   I believe that you have referred to me as an anti-feminist because you haven't taken care to separate my scientific views (most of what I have argued) from my moral and political views (which I've barely touched on). I believe you did this because my scientific views (nature/nurture) conflict with your moral and political views (and some goals) so you inferred that my moral and political views must conflict with your ultimate moral and political goal (social, political, legal gender equality). Although we may disagree on some moral and political sub-goals (e.g. wage parity), we don't disagree on our ultimate moral and political goal (equality of the sexes). Our sub-goals are just proxy in our minds to our ultimate moral and political goals based on our scientific/factual worldview. We disagree on moral/political sub-goals because we disagree on the facts."

First off, I said I agreed with your scientific claims for the most part. The APA seems to agree too, so not agreeing would put me at odds with the scientific consensus, hence why I agree.  Second, if you agree that the wage difference can be decreased by making particular changes to society, and that we do in fact ought to make those changes for the public good, then in what sense is it not a gap (in the sense that it is a difference that exists only because of injustice/bias and ought to be narrowed) rather than just a difference? What I just described and you mostly agreed to is the systemic bias against women that feminists are talking about (the ones who have their heads on straight at least).   If we championed work-life integration, trained shy people to be competitive, and increased compensation for certain work, then the gender wage gap would narrow. It may not narrow all the way, but then you would have a far better case to argue that the remaining gap isn't really a ""gap"" than you do right now."
badscience,31ebrl,vertigodrake,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:26:35 2015 UTC,"Just for the record, I am talking ""at"" you because you initially responded to my comment by accusing me of having a dismissive attitude and being morally callous for not agreeing with your conclusions. If you want to talk ""to"" me then I would be happy to return the favor, but that won't include me submitting to your moral authority. If you want to know about (or question) my views then you should ask about them in a non-accusatory way.   Second, if you agree that the wage difference can be decreased by making particular changes to society, and that we do in fact ought to make those changes for the public good   I don't agree that decreasing the gender wage difference would necessarily be a good thing, although I imagine that some potential ways to implement it might be good and some ways would be very bad. (It's easier to think of ways to make things worse than to make things better.) In general though, I'm not sure if a narrower gender difference in wages would be a good thing if it happened in the real world where all else wouldn't be equal. You'd have to know a lot more about how I view ""all else"" to know why I think that.   in what sense is it not a gap (in the sense that it is a difference that exists only because of injustice/bias and ought to be narrowed)   I believe that the gender differences in wages is mostly not due to injustice/bias of any kind. I'm certain that some small level of injustice/bias against women exists and negatively affects their wages, but I'm not sure if positive discrimination in favor of women balances this out (or even if it outweighs it).   What I just described and you mostly agreed to is the systemic bias against women   I don't believe that I have agreed at all with this conclusion up to now. I believe that wage bias against women exists in Western society, but I'm not sure if net wage bias against women exists in Western society. (I'm certain that net bias against women existed only a few decades ago, and it was significant.)   If we championed work-life integration, trained shy people to be competitive, and increased compensation for certain work, then the gender wage gap would narrow.   I don't necessarily believe that this counts as a ""gap"". If young girls were systematically treated with growth hormone (and young boys were not) this would not mean that there is a ""gender height gap"". The gender height difference would narrow, but it would be no less of a real difference.   It may not narrow all the way, but then you would have a far better case to argue that the remaining gap isn't really a ""gap"" than you do right now.   I'm not really sure what you're arguing here. It seems like you're saying that a ""gap"" is any factor you can think of that makes females earn less than males on average, but supposedly we have the power to change all of these factors and even if we did then women would still earn less than men? If we trained shy people to demand higher salaries, how does this represent closing a ""gap"" instead of a difference?"
badscience,31ebrl,Marlowe3142,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"My thesis is simple: Some portion of the gender wage disparity would not exist if not for arbitrary social norms and arrangements that are reasonably amenable to change. Closer political, social, and economic equality between women and men is an inherent social good (since women generally have particular needs and interests in common that men generally find to be unimportant if not outright to their disfavor, which means that a male-dominated society would not be able to address them). Therefore, we are justified in changing these social norms and arrangements to promote equality, as long as they don't interfere unnecessarily with other goods.  I cannot understand why introducing more workplace flexibility would not be an excellent idea. I also do not understand why anyone would be opposed to training shy people to be competitive in a society that requires competitive behavior in many important contexts. I do not understand why anyone would be opposed to reforming the (female dominated) teaching profession to be more, well, professional, better paid, and more socially prestigious (like it is already in Finland). All of these changes would decrease the gender wage disparity, along with a whole host of other benefits.  And I don't know what kind of crankery this is where you just invent terms out of thin air. What do you mean by ""gap"" being distinct from ""difference"" in the first place? What do you mean by ""net"" wage bias vs ""normal"" wage bias? None of the academic literature uses these terms. You're just confusing yourself and everyone else around you by doing that."

badscience,318t8q,StopBanningMe4,3,Wed Apr 8 05:00:48 2015 UTC,"Did you take high school physics?  F = ma   Force is measured in Newtons, which is just a convenient extra term for a kg*m/s2, which is obvious from the above formula. When an object is accelerating (ie changing in velocity in any way, including slowing down, changing direction, etc) there is a force acting on it that is making it do so. It cannot accelerate without that force. A single Newton can make an object weighing one kg accelerate by 1m/s every second, assuming no friction. Force is something that is applied to something by something else. An object can't just have force.  Energy is different. A Joule is technically a kg*m2/s2, which can basically be understood as the energy required to apply a force of 1 N over a meter. This isn't quite as easy to grasp as the N, but basically instead think of energy as what it actually represents, which is the ability to do work. Something has energy. When I apply a force to an object, it accelerates, and does so as long as I continue to apply the force, but the force doesn't ""transfer"" to the object. However, I am increasing the energy of the object by making it go faster.  We deal with various kinds of energy in the real world, although fundementally they are just different forms of the same thing. If I lift an object up high I add gravitational potential energy to it, which is converted to kinetic energy when I drop it. If it lands on a trampoline, the energy becomes elastic potential energy before promptly becoming kinetic energy again. In real life, in all of these scenarios some of the energy involved becomes heat because of friction, which is why the object will not bounce as high as I dropped it. Nonetheless, it is a zero sum game. Energy is never ""created"", only transferred. It is the abstract idea we use to describe the property of matter that can be used to apply forces to other matter.  Power is energy usage over time, and is given in Watts. These technical terms are fairly frequently misunderstood in standard usage. I don't want to be too prescriptive about language, but in the case of technical jargon you sometimes have to be. It makes sense to measure the output of a power plant in Watts, because we're measuring the rate at which it can produce energy, not the total energy it produces. A power plant that can produce an extraordinary amount of energy in a very short period of time is not very useful, generally because such a power plant will necessarily be one which is in the process of exploding and probably killing thousands. Nonetheless, because the units of energy and power aren't as obvious as for force, and because electrical power is generally measured in Watts, and because electrical power is the most common way people deal with quantifiable sums of energy, they are frequently confused.   A 100W lightbulb is one that runs at a consistent 100W. It is equivalent to saying that it converts 100J of energy every second from electrical energy to various other kinds of energy, mostly heat and light in the case of a lightbulb.

Energy is the amount of work an object can do, like how big is a boulder on a hill above a town. Bigger boulder, more potential energy to destroy houses if it were to roll down.  Force is a push(or pull) in a particular direction. It is measured by how hard the push is (and also in what direction). An equal force is required to lift 1kg of sugar up 10 cm, as to lift 100g (1/10th) of sugar up 1m (10x).  Since an equal force is applied, the energy spent on applying the force is the same."

Neither epidemiological nor laboratory studies have found reliable evidence of such risks, and there is no widely accepted theory as to how they might arise. According to the World Health Organization, “To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use.” The American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all said there is no convincing evidence for a causal relationship. While researchers are continuing to study possible risks, the column should have included more of this background for balance.  In addition, one source quoted in the article, Dr. Joseph Mercola, has been widely criticized by experts for his claims about disease risks and treatments. More of that background should have been included, or he should not have been cited as a source.  An early version of the headline for the article online — “Could Wearable Computers Be as Harmful as Cigarettes?” — also went too far in suggesting any such comparison."

Wearables with 3G or 4G connections built in, including the Samsung Gear S, could be more harmful, though that has not been proved. Apple declined to comment for this article, and Samsung could not be reached for comment.)

badscience,2zg7cq,wcspaz,9,Wed Mar 18 14:06:28 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll throw on a quick unofficial R1 for those who are genuinely curious.   I thought the green chlorophyll was a result of evolutionary pressures from the frequency of the light from the sun. Green is the least represented color (so it gets reflected) while the others get absorbed more readily. I was also under the impression that the reason leaves and some other plants change color during different seasons was because of the change in the frequency due to the tilt of the Earth causing the light frequencies to change (diffraction).   First, the sun's light is white (more-or-less) and green is not significantly underrepresented, to my knowledge.  One possibility is that chlorophyll photosynthesizers developed to compete against other types of photosynthesis that absorbed green light and reflected other wavelengths.  Leaves change color because they stop producing chlorophyll and become dormant.  When this happens, other pigments, often orange or magenta, become more visible.  These leaves are not photosynthesizing other frequencies of light, and those other frequencies of light do not become more present during those seasons.  If they did, everything would look red in the winter."
badscience,2zg7cq,Paradoxius,9,Wed Mar 18 15:37:57 2015 UTC,"The sun's peak output is actually in the greenish yellow part of the spectrum, so it's the opposite of underrepresented.

badscience,2zg7cq,Paradoxius,5,Thu Mar 19 11:43:23 2015 UTC,"OK the rule 1.    as Paradoxius said. There are multiple photosythetic pigments in plants, algae and prokaryotes with different absorbance and emission peaks. A best case scenario is that you have pigements which cover a broad a range of absorbance as possible. However one thing to consider would be cost/benefit and also whether the synthesis of these pigments evolved or even if their synthesis would be possible, which leads to point 3. IIRC many different photosynthetic pigments probably evolved but the extant pigments found in most plants probably won out simply by chance. The reason for the lack of other previously evolved pigments re-emerging is probably that they were (/ are? I ca only speak of plants and algae) molecules very different from the pigments present today and would require vastly different biochemical machinery and pathways to synthesise them."

This loss stems, in part, from warmer temperatures in the Arctic, which have increased the rate of melting at the ice sheet surface.

The linked page itself says:  Over the year, it snows more than it melts, but calving of icebergs also adds to the total mass budget of the ice sheet. Satellite observations over the last decade show that the ice sheet is not in balance. The calving loss is greater than the gain from surface mass balance, and Greenland is losing mass at about 200 Gt/yr.  The source for the Antarctic growth refers to the quote 5% gain per decade for sea ice. Sea ice represents very little of the Ice in the Antarctic, as the Ice Sheet is several thousand times as thick and covers a larger area. One recent estimate of ice mass balance in Antarctica is −92±10 Gt/yr.  The antarctic ice sheet is huge. It holds about 70% of the world's fresh water, and 90% of the world's surface fresh water. If it all melted, it would raise sea levels by 70m. So, if it was growing at 5% per decade, sea level would be falling by 35cm per year."

In these contexts, ""fit"" refers to ""most well adapted to the current environment,"" which differs from common notions of the binary 'fit' and 'unfit.' [citation needed]  Herbert Spencer first used the phrase – after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species – in his Principles of Biology (1864), in which he drew parallels between his own economic theories and Darwin's biological ones, writing, ""This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.""   Darwin first used Spencer's new phrase ""survival of the fittest"" alongside ""natural selection"" in the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species, published in 1869,   intending it to mean ""better designed for an immediate, local environment"".

It's the use of language that reflects the idea of evolution as a straight, upward path where the ""inferior"" species go extinct and the ""superior"" ones survive.
