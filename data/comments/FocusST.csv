FocusST,3e5kvc,OHfocus,2,Wed Jul 22 12:46:31 2015 UTC,"I'd leave the lid on, since it helps secure the filter and the area that the filter clamps onto might not be very secure."

FocusST,3e5kvc,roll4wrd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:38:01 2015 UTC,"Planning on the same air filter replacement in my stock 2015, but from everything I've read you shouldn't keep the lid off it since it'll suck in hot engine bay heat and might knock a bit.  Leaving the lid off for short cruises for the (awesome) sound seems fine, but on a highway where the ambient temperature is probably 20Â° F above normal, it could cause problems.  Great video!"
FocusST,3e5kvc,sailorjerry,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:37:06 2015 UTC,I figured that! Not a bad move changing it regardless because that stock filter is really just sad.

But I have no drone whatsoever.   Drone is when you're just cruising and the exhaust is loud and annoying.

FocusST,3e5fm7,Kevin_Steak,2,Wed Jul 22 15:13:47 2015 UTC,If your car is still running fine and everything I would definitely wait. If the RS is out of your price range just wait for the ST. Maybe you could get a 2016 st3.
FocusST,3e5fm7,Kevin_Steak,2,Wed Jul 22 04:07:38 2015 UTC,How much do the leftovers usually go for? In case I wait then decide i want to save a little bit of money and keep performance blue.
FocusST,3e5fm7,scotty_pimmpen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:22:15 2015 UTC,I really don't know. Prices haven't been released for the 2016 yet. In your case just be patient. No need to rush into buying one if your car is fine. I would wait till the specs/pricing for the 2016 comes out then I would make my decision.
FocusST,3e5fm7,scotty_pimmpen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:09:03 2015 UTC,I'd wait for the RS. And yeah myfordtouch will be worth the wait. The current iteration is terrible.
FocusST,3e5fm7,nyislesfan91,2,Wed Jul 22 02:36:15 2015 UTC,I would love an RS but I think it will be a little out of my price range. Isn't going to be about 35K for the base.

FocusST,3e3mw9,Astarlyne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:42 2015 UTC,One part of a car should never touch another when opening or closing. That's sounds like something in the hatch might be loose or installed wrong.

FocusST,3dyfla,s0m3th1ngAZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:03 2015 UTC,Not bad at all really. Took between 4 and 6 hours..hard to tell because I took a few breaks during the hot part of the day. I've never done anything like this and I was able to complete the install with basic tools and jack stands. Instructions are decent too.

I noticed your charge pipes come out and turn 90 deg versus stock. I like that! I'm sure it was easier to install as well!  Hope you didn't forget to hook up your fogs like I did...lol.

FocusST,3dyfwk,thisiSINsomnia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"So people are saying this reduces charge temps. They open when the AC is running for sure and stay closed during cold start to assist in engine warm up.  Now, I have a FiST and I know they're , but I just don't know if the benefit will be there from removal. Obviously charge temps will go down in any instances that they are closed, but I can't imagine any scenarios in which they are while driving?  Best I found on the subject was this thread:  http://www.focusst.org/forum/focus-st-discussions/17966-active-grill-shutter-removal.html  Would REALLY like to know more.

But the bumps right in the center is actually the scratch itself. A friend slid their car into me over the winter in my driveway. The screws from his front plate hit and slid along my bumper horizontally, then vertically (you can still see the vertical part) which gouged out strips of paint and creating bumps. I didn't want to sand these bumps down cuz I was afraid I'd make it worse. So I opted for the $6 strip of Carbon Fiber wrap. It looks somewhat tacky, but it's only supposed to be temporary. I plan hope to get the rear facia replaced at some point. Plus it looks better than the actual scratch, which you could pick out from a mile away."

I personally think Cobb is over priced, I'd use their ""stages"" as a guide and look for other suppliers (Stratified, Panda, Boomba, Strano, Mountune, etc).   I'd also recommend a custom tune once you get the parts you want and before you drive it too hard.  I will also mention that I no longer have Ford's warranty, so that is not a concern. If that is a concern for you, look into Mountune."

FocusST,3dt6ll,BiteyCat,6,Sun Jul 19 05:28:04 2015 UTC,the frpp tune doesn't actually give you more hp. just more torque
FocusST,3dt6ll,krannny,3,Sun Jul 19 06:29:48 2015 UTC,Yeah 300 hp will require full boltons and likely an e30 tune and w/m. More comfortably with a bigger turbo. I have the tune with a mountune intercooler. Giggle factory.

FocusST,3dt6ll,fingerthief,2,Sun Jul 19 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"Take a good look at the dynos for the FRPP. It's a solid bump in torque, but some people actually report a decline in top end power.   It also runs pretty hot compared to some other pro tunes, so heat soak is an issue (you'll also pull timing after a few pulls).   It's a great choice if warranty is your primary concern, but a smart driver who keeps an eye on his ignition corrections will get much more value out of a Cobb AccessPort and a good tune."
FocusST,3dt6ll,Cheehos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"I bought it along with the filter and plugs. A Ford dealer has to install it to maintain warranty.   Nice bump in power over stock.

That being said I was under the impression that a stage 1 mk7 GTI should be dead even or even best a stage 3 E30 tuned ST (which mine is) but we had a little race with him on a stage 2 tune and once I hit 4th gear I managed to run up on his bumper and had to let off.

The difference is probably either sync/vs. my ford touch or my ford touch with and without navigation, your lower package probably doesn't have dual zone climate control either and the upper one does, that's just my guess.  If you want cloth seats you'll have to get an american ST, or it came from america to begin with.  If you get one with all leather I will trade seats with you!  I liked the leather seats but the ST2/3 came with stuff I just didn't want (my ford touch and built in nav) and for an extra 4-6 grand I figured I could save some of that and get leather seats to put in.

Not saying anyone here can't, but the number of people likely to see your question is much bigger out there.  That being said, I wonder if the tune is different now that direct injection is in the mix. Things have gotten way more digital since the early 2000s so there could be an incompatibility there."
FocusST,3df3bx,MFlood7356,2,Wed Jul 15 21:34:40 2015 UTC,My advice is go to modbargains.com and toss the ap v3 in your cart and check the price. I think it's $445 without the filter.

FocusST,3dd6ah,Sokmunky,0,Wed Jul 15 13:01:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input - I was initially looking at the WRX as well, but the interior kinda killed it for me."
FocusST,3dd6ah,thesealocust,3,Thu Jul 16 00:38:51 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it. As I've posted a few times, I bought a new 2015 ST1 (base package) then drove the shit out of it - almost 13,000 miles in less than two months. No problems along the way, incredibly comfortable, hauled cargo, got me to slightly offroad camping sites, and zoomed around curves and trucks on the interstates and everything in-between. Got right around 29mpg all told too - not bad!   The available power, comfortable handling, and manual transmission just make it a fun as hell to drive on the road. It feels stable and you can run through its gears and make the engine growl without violating too many traffic laws.   It's really hard to beat for the price if you're sure you want something hot-hatch like. It took a while to convince the dealer I wanted the base package, but I got it for a few grand under MSRP. I figure if I want fancy sound systems I can upgrade my own, and I've heard mixed reviews on the upgraded seats. The Ford touch screen nav gets outright bad reviews, so I almost feel like I dodged a bullet not having it.   A big reason I bought it was the combination of price and happy reviews. Almost nobody seems to dislike the car. I might have gotten the Fiesta ST instead, but since I knew I was doing interstate driving, the slightly larger and more powerful Focus ST was more appealing.   Oh, and maintenance is super cheap. I had the 10,000 mile service (oil change, tire rotation, inspection) done for $39.95 at a dealer."
FocusST,3dd6ah,commonplatypus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:30:38 2015 UTC,"I agree - everyone I've seen post about the Focus ST talks great things about the car. I'm a bit worried about reliability and maintenance since I've never owned a Ford car before, but I have heard that it isn't very expensive as you mentioned."
FocusST,3dd6ah,commonplatypus,3,Thu Jul 16 00:23:55 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, the Mazda 3 lays down 180HP/180TQ. It's the slowest on this list, but definitely no slouch. Drove one and it feels quicker than it says it is.  Also the interior is arguably the nicest one one, even compared to the GTI (which you should also consider). The Mazda got voted best interior under 30k by car and driver for a reason. It won't win any races, but it's a great little car.  The WRX is also a great option if you want a very fast, basic, AWD car. Worst interior on the list by far (Never been Subaru's strong point or priority in any way). Develops rattles as it ages in the cabin due to low quality. Fun as hell to drive though, especially with the new six speed.  I have nothing but good things to say about the GTI overall, except that I hate the shift knob design. They have some stupid metal collar underneath it and it makes grabbing it feel weird and insecure.  The Civic Si was in my list before I bought the Fiesta ST (so was the Focus ST). I liked it because you get a lot of standard features. It's got the best clutch and gearbox of anything on this list and beyond, which is a common compliment of the Si from many sources. The sticker price is high compared to competition, but nobody pays that. You can negotiate down on the Si very well and come out with a good deal. They suck on incentives, though. You will get lots of flak for owning this car when talking to most ""enthusiasts"" because they've convinced it's an insult to the car's heritage. I liked it though.  Now the Focus ST. This is an incredibly fun car for the price. You can haggle VERY well on it and Ford offers the best incentives hands down. Right now they're running 0% for 72 months. You won't get that anywhere else. It's a free loan.  The car is pretty quick for what you get and very mod friendly. Modding it quickly becomes addictive and the community around the ST cars is very good.  The upgraded seats are very worth getting if you feel comfortable in them. Don't feel pressured to do so though. The stock seats are also pretty good. Lots of people say the Recaros make the car and I disagree. Heated seats and mirrors are very nice to have though.  That said, at stock the wheel hop taking off can be kind of annoying. This can be fixed by replacing the Rear Motor Mount; which is like $170 or something. Very cheap and easy to do with basic hand tools. Anyone can do it if they have a jack and some stands.  Also the Stereo is mediocre and basically impossible to upgrade, I believe. If you're an Audiophile in any way, it might irritate you. It's not bad, but it also isn't great. Same goes for the Fiesta.  I didn't buy one because I liked the Fiesta more for my money. I loved the power and comfort of the car and it drove very well, though.   Lastly, I'll recommend the Fiesta ST if you feel like you can live with a car that small. It's slower than the Focus, but many people (including myself) feel it is more fun to drive.  You can't go wrong with either the FiST or FoST. If you like going fast in a straight line more than tossing corners, you want the FoST, however."
FocusST,3dd6ah,SexBobomb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:17:32 2015 UTC,"I've been considering the WRX as well, but the only thing that puts me off is the crappy interior that everyone keeps telling me about. Looks amazing on the inside, but I'd also want to have a pretty decent looking interior. Maybe it's too much to ask.  The Focus is ST seems to be a pretty good bang for your buck which is why I'm considering it. Decent interior, and pretty fast car for what you're paying. Haven't tried the Recaro seats yet, but I'm excited to try them out when I go check out the car at the dealer.   The Civic Si was also on my list because it's a pretty good price and comes with a lot of tech built into the car at no additional charge.   I am a bit of an audiophile, but I currently have an 2001 BMW with a mediocre sound system which I manage with, so I'm guessing anything new will have better audio than what I currently have.  Thank you very much for your input btw, the FiST was also on my list, but I think I'd rather have the extra bit of space."
FocusST,3dd6ah,SexBobomb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:36:31 2015 UTC,"The WRX has a good looking and okay interior. Won't win any awards, but it does the job.  The issue with the audio in the STs comes mostly from the fact that you can't really fix the problem. Ford left us with no DIN slots for upgrading. You can try new speakers and a woofer (FoST has an optional woofer, but might as well just put your own in that you pick out) and see how far that gets you, but don't expect a miracle.  That said, the 2016 models will have a new infotainment stack based on QNX, not Microsoft. It's called Sync 3 and is rumored to be a ton better. If you can wait for that, it might be worth it. You can leverage a better deal financially on a 2015 though. Combine it with the 0% for maximum value."
FocusST,3dd6ah,immson,2,Thu Jul 16 00:44:02 2015 UTC,I'm still comparing the Focus ST to the Subaru WRX personally - it's a closer power comparison than the Civic SI is... and all three of them would run laps around the Mazda 3. The Si is naturally aspirated while the WRX and ST are turbocharged which obviously is power gained but isn't always for everyone. Also worth throwing the VW GTI into your comparables at this price/power point

FocusST,3dd6ah,sailorjerry,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:40:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, I was in the same deciding stages like you were!  I picked up a 2015 Focus ST Magnetic ST3 package over 4th of July! I seriously love the leather seats, the ambient lightning, the rear seats have a center arm rest. My sticker was 31,265, I was going to use TrueCar and my X-Plan but they were both higher priced then i expected. I went into the dealership asking for invoice cost on everything. In total I saved $1,850 off the car plus an additional $2,000 Factory Rebate because we own a 2013 Focus and 60 Months 0% Ford Financing. I'm sure I could've saved more but I'm extremely happy with my purchase! I've been complimented a few times for the color and the rims.  1) I'm a bigger guy 5'11"" 265lbs so the recaros are very snug! 2) Please make sure to inspect the car, unfortunately my car had a mis-spray on the hood so it's been at the dealership over the last 5 days being resprayed! I'll PM you a photo if you want to see it. 3)I think ford is offering 72 months 0% plus $750 extra if you finance thru them.  Please PM if you need anything else!"
FocusST,3dd6ah,keyboardman1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:40:52 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see a photo of you car! How are you liking the car so far? I really need to test drive it, but it seems like the ST3 package is the way to go. I kinda wanted the partial leather seats just because it's hot as hell here in San Diego, but I think I can manage since my current car has them.   Definitely interested in the Recaro seats, and I'm a bit of a smaller dude at 5'6, but we'll see how they are in a couple days. The financing option is tempting..."
FocusST,3dd6ah,sailorjerry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:38:17 2015 UTC,"Hey I think you should get the ST3 as long as you are okay with budget, I've been researching this car for over 2 years, I was going to get ST1 last minute to save money. However, I would've regretted it, I'm glad my girlfriend who sold me on the whole hatch back idea told me to get what I wanted. So in the end I got a fully loaded ST!   It's been 1 1/2 weeks and I have over 800 miles, it's seriously amazing how fun it is, the low end torque is incredible, I thought my 99' V6 5-Speed mustang had decent pull, this makes it feel like it's slow. I love how many looks I get from people. I've been complimented by an older gentlemen telling me how nice this car is and how ford has hit it out of the park.  I will send you photos tonight when I get home I'm on mobile right now. Please feel free to ask anymore questions!  If you do however decide on the ST, I recommend doing a visual inspection of the car, be thorough I'll send you some photos of why.  By the way I'm in Orange County! Near Anaheim not too far from you!"

FocusST,3dd6ah,mc_nibbles,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:34:36 2015 UTC,I got my 2015 Focus ST3 for $25.8. Use Truecar and play the dealers off each other until you get the price you want.   I had to do Ford Financing to get the deal but I'll refi after 3 payments to something better.
FocusST,3dd6ah,bad93ex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:01:27 2015 UTC,How do you do that with the dealers? Go to dealer A and get a price and then go to dealer B and tell them dealer A was gonna sell it for dealer a price?

FocusST,3dcny3,ewhite81,2,Wed Jul 15 09:50:28 2015 UTC,"Went with a $350 intercooler instead of a $500 one because you couldn't justify the price difference, but you have a Milltek exhaust that probably set you back $800. Not knocking you at all, I'm probably doing the same and the Milltek is easily the best sounding catback I've heard on an ST, I just find it a bit funny. The only reason I haven't settled on an MBRP catback is because of the amount of people who say theirs drones when cruising but I've yet to hear of a single complaint about the Milltek droning. The MBRP is the second best sounding, in my opinion, and I'd happily settle for one because of the price tag on the Milltek if it wasn't for that.  Good to hear about the intercooler though. But if you had to make a trip to the parts store for bolts, I'd pass that on to Depo so they can address the issue."
FocusST,3dcny3,Avellin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:51:57 2015 UTC,I actually got the milltek because I got the Depo and saved money on the intercooler.  Also got a great group buy deal through focus st.  This is exactly why I didn't go with the Mbrp exhaust.   I also have a st that Ives near me with Cobb and thought that Milltek sounded better.   Also the bolt replacement isn't provided by almost every intercooler that is using stock mounting points.  The bracket that comes OEM isn't recommended to be reused so I went and found replacements.
FocusST,3dcny3,Avellin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:02:10 2015 UTC,"The Milltek and MBRP exhausts are honestly the only ones that I care for pretty much at all. The stock can be made to sound good with a muffler delete and swapping the resonator to something like a Flowmaster, but at that point I could almost buy the cheapest MBRP (probably could if I caught them on sale)."

If I drive like the turbo's not there, coast down hills in an appropriate gear, etc. I can get more like 24 mpg around town. Fast interstate speeds (75+) and/or hills get around 28-30 mpg.

The loans could be more attractive on the 2015 though, a lot of times they do the 0% for 5 years for new cars.

Both the availability and the interest rate could be better for new vs. used - at which point the additional sticker price is even less of a factor.   You also have the advantage of being the first owner of a hooligany, turbo-ladden car. Meaning you'll know YOU destroyed it, instead of wondering how much somebody else did :D  Anyway, at that price differential I think new is a strong contender, and not because the '15 is that much better than the '13."
FocusST,3d940o,thesealocust,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:37:42 2015 UTC,0% financing and make your 2% off the money left in the bank. It's not much but you'll generate a small income off the 15000 dollars over 4 or 5 years which may help in your decision making. Your difference will drop from 5k to ~4k.
FocusST,3d940o,_Ls_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:56:40 2015 UTC,"even if you were getting 2% at the bank which you definitely arent, that would only keep you in line with inflation, so your money just stays the same value."
FocusST,3d940o,_Ls_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:20:35 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking in the high interest savings accounts I guess but that still may be pushing it. However, even if the value of the money only keeps in line with inflation, relative to the loan would it still be a increase in value rather than if you dumped it all in lump sum? It's still an accrual of money you otherwise wouldn't have. In my case I bought my car through our company which does gain at 2%, that I know is for sure. It's the exact reason our accounting department had us finance rather than purchase outright.  Anyways I am asking about this here now. Even though the actual value wouldn't increase due to inflation, the value of the loan would decrease at the same rate? So if the value of your money stayed the same (even though the number increased a bit) you've essentially paid a little less for the car since the money in the bank paid for a small amount?"

One thing I got tired of was the lack of an exhaust note, so I had the resonator removed. Sounds much better and didn't cost much at all.  I also got some RokBlokz short mud flaps because the tires like to sling stuff all over the side of the car."
FocusST,3d4ugc,mc_nibbles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"How did you delete the resonator?  Did you just weld on some pipe over the resonator gap?  Does this void warranty?  What did you order if you ordered anything?  Can I just weld on some stainless steel pipe over the gap, or perhaps aluminized steel?  Let me know!  Thank you!  Would you recommend doing the resonator or the muffler?  I don't want it to be annoying while driving, I drive a lot, but don't want to invest in an exhaust system yet..  But I do want to hear the exhaust a bit, ya know?  What do you recommend?  Would the delete be too loud?"
FocusST,3d4ugc,mc_nibbles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:56:05 2015 UTC,"Here's a sound clip. I had a local shop cut the resonator out and weld in a piece of pipe. You only get a bit of low end tone in the cabin at idle and under load, if your cruising there's almost no difference between the stock sound and this. From the outside the car is a little louder, but not as loud as a full cat back or anything. The resonator delete gives you a lower tone with girgling, a muffler delete gives you a higher tone (almost ricey) but more volume. I like the deep sound so I went with the resonator delete.  It will not void your warranty, except for your exhaust system. So if you get an exhaust leak somewhere, they'll blame it on the modification, but it's not like exhaust work is expensive. Having the pipe put in cost me about $80. There is also a kit from OCDSPEED for about the same price, but you have to put it in yourself. The website is down or I would link to it.  Also, for an aftermarket part to void your warranty it has to be the cause of the damage. With our cars the only thing exhaust could cause damage to is your hearing :)"

FocusST,3d15gm,Ratotosk,14,Sun Jul 12 17:38:48 2015 UTC,Well lets take a look at the other options. The main one is probably gti. And if I'm honest it has a nicer interior that feels better. But it doesn't drove as nice and is a tad bit boring. The same goes for the speed 3. On the opposite end of that you have the wrx which has AWD and is a faster car but Subaru interiors are shit. They are cheap and they feel really cheap.   So it depends what you like. If all you care about is going fast go get the Subaru. Or if you just want luxury get a gti. But if you're like me and want a more rounded fun and comfortable car go for the St. You probably won't be disappointed with any of them.
FocusST,3d15gm,Faggatron9001,3,Sun Jul 12 17:56:20 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at buying a new car and just tested the GTI last weekend against the Focus ST and totally agree. The GTI interior looks more professional. It's a car you'd feel good about picking up grandma in, leaving it out of sport mode, and taking her to the airport. Not saying the ST interior is bad at all, but it is more rugged and more sporty feeling. You get in the recaro seats and it feels like a racer. It's comfortable, but feels more sport like.  From a performance standpoint the ST felt tighter. Better in the turns, better braking, just overall more in control.   I didn't tryout the WRX (not really my style from an appearance standpoint) so I can't weigh in there.  I will also add this. At least at the dealers near me, the ST S3 package was the same price as a GTI S automatic. Giving the ST more bang for your buck.  Anyways, I agree with your final assessment, just wanted to add in a few more points for OP."
FocusST,3d15gm,Zer0Gravity1,2,Mon Jul 13 18:00:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I totally agree. You are getting much more car for he money with the ST. My old car was at MK6 GTI and my buddy has an sti which feels great to drive but don't like the cheap materials and feeling inside.
FocusST,3d15gm,Faggatron9001,6,Mon Jul 13 20:53:48 2015 UTC,"The thing that I love about mine is how comfortable it can be on a long cruise somewhere, but then completely transforms into a hooligan when the mood takes you. There's a couple of little niggles with interior quality but these only show on small bumpy country roads. I would take the ST over the golf as i found the interior to be smart but a bit dull IMHO (and the St has extra gauges :) ),  the fez ST is more pointy in the corners but the focus is great fun to wrestle"

However, if that does not matter to you and the deal is sweet enough; the Focus ST is an incredible car and offer a lot of value per dollar at this price point. :)"

FocusST,3d15gm,kim_jongill,2,Sun Jul 12 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"There are a handful of people who have blown engines. Like 10 on the entirety of focusst.org. Most had tunes. Take that with a grain of salt.  Several other people have posted about their 100k+ mile STs with no issues aside from scheduled maintenance and wear items.  Realistically, you have a warranty for any freak accidents. The ST engines are typically very strong (people have 400 whp, big turbo'd engines), the transmissions don't break, etc."
FocusST,3d15gm,AvastYeUpboat,2,Sun Jul 12 23:57:27 2015 UTC,"Subtract one from that. My neighbor is one of these idiots but he's an idiot, he blew a wrx, his St and another wrx block."

FocusST,3d15gm,AvastYeUpboat,2,Mon Jul 13 08:18:04 2015 UTC,"Don't let the blown motors scare you from this platform.   Most of the blown motors were 6th gear cruising.  Probably LSPI from people not wanting to down shift and going into boost.  Almost all of them were 2013 and early 2014 motors. Also they were mostly cylinder 4 which is furthest from cooling pump.  When LSPI occurs the Cylinders get really hot. The weird thing is usually when LSPI occurs it causes melting but instead with the st this causes ringlands to break apart.     Moral of the story is downshift, downshift, downshift!"
FocusST,3d15gm,TankHappy,3,Mon Jul 13 20:45:50 2015 UTC,"Take the comfort of the GTI and the raw feel of the Mazdaspeed 3, smash them together, and you'll get a Focus ST.   Cheap, solid performance numbers (252 hp, 270 torque is just below the MS3 for best-in-class for a hot hatch, and it's a 2.0L instead of a 2.3L), very nimble, tons of torque for DDing around town, huge aftermarket.  Unless you really want the interior of the GTI or the look of another hot hatch, it's kind of a no-brainer IMO."
FocusST,3d15gm,AvastYeUpboat,2,Sun Jul 12 23:54:13 2015 UTC,"For me, I had to get out of the mindset that only RWD cars are capable of letting me have the fun I want to have. But daily driving an S2000 was getting real old. Competitors I originally considered were a boosted FRS/BRZ because they are mega slow (but amazing out of the box as a cheap driver's car, more than my ST, IMO) or used BMW 135. I didn't like the reliability concerns with both.  When I started considering FWD and AWD the competitors became the ST, GTI, WRX, Civic SI and some used cars, mainly BMWs. I started settling on the ST because of how I saw that it could drive. Getting the back to kick out to the point of having to oversteer without initial understeer practically sold me. But eventually fell in love it because of how much you get for your money: The seats, the lights, the general interior, the practicality, refined 2015 look....  My next choice probably would have been the WRX, but they are a bit more expensive in the trims I would have wanted and they are less of a value proposition to me in regards to the full package."
FocusST,3d15gm,steamedturtle,2,Sun Jul 12 20:21:41 2015 UTC,It's an awesome car but an even better deal when you buy used. These cars depreciate very fast unlike a wrx or gti. As mentioned it's nicer but less hard than a wrx. A gti is nicer but less hard than the focus. Don't buy a civic si or mazdaspeed 3. The focus is a great blend of everything and comes loaded with tons of great features even at st1 level but I really really recommend st2 or st3 as it takes the car over the top to have the recaros and the nice screen. Look into cpo if possible as they have great prices and big warranties

If you are looking for an awesome distance commute vehicle the TDI would be your choice. You cannot get a 15' WRX in a hatch. Welcome to the forum!"
FocusST,3d15gm,scrubfish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:21:27 2015 UTC,"It's a hell of a lot of fun when you want it to be, and unreasonably practical when you need it to be.   I did 13,000 miles in mine my first two months, and it was a blast in the twisties, comfortable cruising down the highway, and survived minor offroading while hauling a shitload of camping gear. All while getting something like 29 mpg average.  There are other great and similar cars, but the ST is an especially good value. Depending on the used market near you and the options you're looking at it might not always be the cheapest, but there's a good chance it will be. The money you saved can go right back into gas, tires, and mods...   I'm not going to argue it's better than all the other cars out there, but I have 0 complaints, and can't seem to do short errands anymore... I always do a few extra laps because it's just so much fun to drive..."

The build quality is typical Ford, it's good, the materials are good, but it's not GTI good. Then again, the GTI isn't as fast, and it costs more, so I'd rather have to true a few panels or pieces of fabric myself than lose out on the power.  The gas mileage is not the best. I see an average of 28 mpg, which seems pretty sad.  The resale value is pretty sad if you get a higher trim model. I asked my dealer what there trade in offer would be for a 2014 ST1, and then asked them about the value of the same car but the ST3, and the ST3 only fetched another $1k.   So if you're cool with the base model, I got mine for $22,500, and with a standard 5 year loan if I make an extra payment every year I'm pretty much always going to owe less than it's worth in trade in, and I only put $2k down on it.  Overall it's a great budget hot hatch. If you want a more ""adult"" and fancy hot hatch, get the GTI. If you want a smaller more agressive hatch, get the Fiesta ST. If you want to cry when you find out subi stopped making the WRX hatch/wagon and but still want that sweet AWD, the WRX is pretty good.   The only thing I would say you should stay away from is the Hyundai Veloster, and another one I'm personally not a fan of is the FR-S/BRZ (This is america, we need MORE POWAAAAA).  EDIT: As /u/XMaximaniaX pointed out, the current 2015 GTI is more on par with the ST in the current gen. The 2014 and back models had less horsepower and significantly less torque."

FocusST,3csvbu,mc_nibbles,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:22:29 2015 UTC,"I keep forgetting they bumped up the 2015 GTI model. 2014 was down on torque and HP enough that it was slower than the ST, Then they bumped it up to pretty much equal the straight line performance of the ST."
FocusST,3csvbu,XMaximaniaX,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:13:56 2015 UTC,"you are sort of right, but the numbers aren't to be strictly believed. VW always underrates their engines. Each car's crank rating is basically the power at the wheels in real life.  And to be entirely fair, in regards to which car is faster in a straight line, the GTI is still faster to 60 even with a manual. The DSG is faster yet. And that's comparing to the quicker 2013-2014 models. The 2015+ FoST is a tad bit slower.   But where the FoST shines is in torque and handling feel"
FocusST,3csvbu,mc_nibbles,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:46:37 2015 UTC,"According to Car and Driver, 0-60 in the 2015 GTI DSG is 5.8, where the 2015 Focus ST 0-60 is 5.7. I've seen some tests show both cars over 6 seconds, and both cars under, so I'm just comparing two from the same source.   I agree on the HP numbers, as most FoST put down pretty close to crank numbers on the dyno.   The 2015 FoST has the same overall specs, it's gained a few pounds in the larger brakes but not enough to really change the 0-60. I think the issue is that it's  a turbo car, unless you test in the exact same conditions, there's no way to know if it's slower because of the environment or because of the car itself.   Really in the end between both there's very little difference in overall performance, but the feel of the car and the fit and finish on both are different. Focus ST is more of a refined but wild car, where the GTI is kind of just Refined. The Focus is a Ford, so it's better than in the past, but not VW quality. The Focus ST MSRP is kind of high (you can get an ST2/ST3 for close to the MSRP of the ST1), wereas the GTI is hard to find at a discount."

If you read the article, it describes the Focus ST has having a 0-60 of 6.3 seconds. It even states that the GTI will ""walk away from the ST"" in either manual or DSG.   I agree on the HP numbers, as most FoST put down pretty close to crank numbers on the dyno.   I was actually talking about the GTI making crank numbers at the wheels. The FoST doesn't quite do that.

Hit almost 30 miles per gallon over the life of the car, and that includes flogging the hell out of it when the opportunity presents itself.  It's extremely fun to drive, peppy despite not being the fastest kid on the block, and has enough space to be practical. Many of my 10,000 miles were fully loaded with people and gear, passing on the interstate was still a breeze. I've even come to love the sound of the symposer, although I know that's controversial.   I went with the base model/ST1, because I've heard the touch screen interface is crap, the upgraded seats get mixed comfort reviews, sunroof does nothing for me, and I figure I can upgrade the speakers for less on my own. So far happy to have saved the money and don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.  The car seems to be attracting a good following, and is extremely reasonably priced for its performance and compared to its competition.  Lastly, while I haven't tried to sell it, one reason I bought new was because I couldn't find any used for a reasonable price, so I'm somewhat skeptical of the resale comment. I haven't done much research though."

FocusST,3csvbu,Inclemented,3,Fri Jul 10 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"I'm just going from what I've heard numerous times on focus st forum. Private party resell can still fetch a good price, but trade in will be a slap in the face...don't worry. Youll want to drive it until it dies once you sit in one. I highly recommend the cobb v3 accessport and a tune as your first mod. Run 93 octane gas or better in it at all times. Next you'll want a larger more efficient fmic because the stock one is the limiting factor in the FOST's performance. Then I would go with intake, exhaust, downpipe. Any more questions? I hope I could be of some help."

FocusST,3cstti,mc_nibbles,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:18:41 2015 UTC,Did you get it done at a shop and how much did it run you
FocusST,3cstti,jjhats,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:59:38 2015 UTC,"Got it done at a local shop, was about $80. I went with a reputable place, I got quoted as low as $50-$60, but for the extra $20 I wanted this guy to do it because he's so quick and does such great work.   I thought about doing it myself, but without a hydraulic exhaust expander it was going to be a PITA because of the difference of pipe diameter.  In the end it cost a little less than OCDSPEED's cheapest resonator delete, but I didn't have to do any work. Still have the OEM resonator too just in case I ever want to have it put back on."
FocusST,3cstti,jjhats,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:09:42 2015 UTC,In your opinion is it worth it? A real exhaust upgrade runs 300-400 and I've heard with the stock exhaust being a 2/10 the red delete is only like a 3-4/10. I really just want a sound period which our car makes so little of like it's almost silent which is awkward with the bov
FocusST,3cstti,TaterTotsForLunch,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:27:32 2015 UTC,"Most of the bolt on kits run $400 plus, I think the MBRP is $450 ish, and everything else is $500 plus. For just a little volume, the res delete is a good choice. The muffler delete produces more volume, but it's higher pitched and it's mostly higher pitched sound.  With that in mind, I'm sure you could have a local shop do a muffler delete and replace the resonator with a better aftermarket one for $200 ish, which would give you more volume and the nice tone."
FocusST,3cstti,TaterTotsForLunch,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:12:33 2015 UTC,It definitely sounds cooler.  Is it louder too?
FocusST,3cstti,david2p4,2,Fri Jul 10 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"From the outside, yes, it's louder, but not super loud or anything.  From the inside, there's more of the deep tone in the cabin, and under hard acceleration you can hear more of the exhaust note.   On the highway, there's zero noticeable difference. Under normal driving, you can hear the exhaust if the window is down, but otherwise the only difference is a little more of the deep tone at lower rpms.  I think it's the best sound if you want to have something more than stock, but don't want a lot of volume."

FocusST,3cmfxa,please_no_photos,3,Thu Jul 9 01:23:03 2015 UTC,"Owned many forced induction cars - for the Focus:   Avoid boost/WOT until engine is warm (out of open loop mode) Avoid boost/WOT below 2300-2500 RPM (hard on engine!) Only need to idle the car for 15-30 seconds before shutting it down if you were quite hard on it before stopping   If driving for the eco award, shift at ~1700-2000, apply very little pedal (< 5%), and coast & downshift to a stop rather than braking (coasing uses 0? fuel in closed loop mode).  If passing a vehicle on the highway, downshift to 3/4 - if anything, its more fun that way ;)"
FocusST,3cmfxa,DMatty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:46:26 2015 UTC,People on here who think that it doesn't matter what gear/rpm you floor the car at should not be giving advice.   LSPI is not a good thing. They'll find that out sooner or later.
FocusST,3cmfxa,AtrocityMarch,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"I've heard and read about not boosting in high gears at low rpms all the time. I understand what happens when you do this. I understand the dangers and consequences, but I've never understood why. Could you perhaps ELI5?   I've tried to read up quite a bit about it but it just goes over my head. If you're cool with it, I'll need to ask very stupid questions to get my dumb head to understand"
FocusST,3cmfxa,XMaximaniaX,3,Thu Jul 9 19:50:35 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple concept.  The turbo takes in air from the intake and forces it pressurized into the engine.  When you are at low rpm, the boost building up more in the engine as there are less rotations occurring to absorb the boost.   When you go wot in 1st and 2nd the rpm climbs fast enough that boost is used up at the correct rate so no damage can be caused.  But when you go wot in 6th, it takes longer for the boost to be used causing it to begin building in the cylinders.   As the air pressure builds, the piston cannot finish a full rotation as the increased air pressure prevents it.  When the cylinder fires early in the rotation, this causes knock where the piston will hit the top of the engine due to the force of the explosion.   Depending on how early the ignition takes place, and how many occur at a time, you can blow a hole right through your engine."
FocusST,3cmfxa,TankHappy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"First off, thanks for the reply!   Okay I think you explained the missing piece of logic in my head that I didn't understand, which is that the boost pressure is unable to be expelled at a velocity that is safe for the pistons and mechanical internals when you're boosting at low rpms at high gears. Which makes sense because the rpms climb much slower at high speed in a higher gear, which means slower air flow through the engine.  But isn't there some sort of mechanism that can prevent the build up of boost? What are wastegates for if they aren't preventing this surge of boost pressure? Can't the ECU just limit boost pressure at dangerous thresholds?"
FocusST,3cmfxa,XMaximaniaX,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:36:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't know much about how to prevent it just that it happens.  So far I know it happens to the Veloster, MS3, MS6 and the STs.  I hear it happens in these cars more because we have smaller turbos that spool really easily.  Cars with bigger turbos don't have this issue as they don't begin to spool until higher rpms anyways.  Maybe since these engines are rather new platforms, and are using smaller turbos than usual, they haven't really worked out all the kinks."
FocusST,3cmfxa,TankHappy,0,Fri Jul 10 02:44:01 2015 UTC,ELI5:  It breaks the engine. You'll understand when you're older son. :)
FocusST,3cmfxa,DMatty,3,Fri Jul 10 03:40:18 2015 UTC,Don't need to idle with the focus/fiesta.  Don't put the car under boost in high gear.  Don't put the car into boost at low rpm.  Don't put the car into boost if it's cold.
FocusST,3cmfxa,disturbdlurker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:26:08 2015 UTC,What's the highest gear you can safely boost in? I'm going to guess that's just because if you're cruising in 6th you're more likely than not going to be in the low RPM's. Is there a certain RPM threshold where boost will kick in? Not really sure how to go about avoiding it when I don't know what it takes to boost
FocusST,3cmfxa,AvastYeUpboat,2,Thu Jul 9 01:36:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think about trying to pass anyone in a gear higher than 4th. We have small turbos, so you will get into boost around 2500ish.   You won't really get into boost unless you're trying to. Just getting up to speed 1-2-3 or whatever won't have you getting into boost."
FocusST,3cmfxa,TankHappy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:45:20 2015 UTC,"It's not what gear but the gear speed.  Focus st suffers from LSPI (low speed pre ignition).  This causes cylinders to misfire if you boost at low rpm which can bend a rod, cause engine knock and even blow a hole in your engine.     This is my rule of thumb.  ""No boost zones"" 6 gear  <3.5k rpm 5th < 3K 3-4 < 2.5k unless I am logging then 2k.   1-2 don't matter as car controls boost on it's own to prevent it.   Edit:  messed up on some grammar and spelling."
FocusST,3cmfxa,xxgsdxx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:36:23 2015 UTC,I try not to draw boost till the oil reaches 150Â°. Don't floor it in 5th or 6th. That's how guys throw ring lands. Enjoy! Check out focusst.org
FocusST,3cmfxa,cru_jonze,4,Thu Jul 9 01:36:07 2015 UTC,What is your source of information on this? I've never heard of damaging ring lands by flooring it in 5th or 6th gear...
FocusST,3cmfxa,phxtravis,2,Thu Jul 9 02:19:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even worry about ringlands on a stock ST. Stage 2 or 3, maybe."
FocusST,3cmfxa,cru_jonze,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:23:40 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to get the feeling that most people that warn about ringlands don't even know what a ringland is.  There have been very few people that have managed to blow up the ST engine in the 3 years that it has been out, and most of those people have admitted to beating on the car and/or running untested mods and tunes.  Get quality parts and quality tunes and it will not be a problem. If you are going out and beating the everloving crap out of the car every night then yeah, stuff might break.  It's not a race car."
FocusST,3cmfxa,phxtravis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:11:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm new to the ST scene(2 months) so I don't know how many failures there have been. I just know the first couple of big turbo guys had ringland issues, and it looked like the cylinder that failed got pretty hot(possibly running to lean?). I'm currently ""stage 3"", only for a week, and my car gas 65k on it. I'm confident that the tunning has gotten pretty damn good and safe."
FocusST,3cmfxa,xxgsdxx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:38:24 2015 UTC,That's a good rule to follow. I do a lot of highway commuting so what if I need to make a pass? In my current car which is NA I don't really have to worry about it and just drop into 4th and let it do its thing.

FocusST,3cmfxa,cru_jonze,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:59:17 2015 UTC,"Do you ever boost at that point? I'm just curious what requirement needs to be met to hit it. Is it WOT, pedal to the floor?"
FocusST,3cmfxa,cru_jonze,7,Thu Jul 9 02:50:04 2015 UTC,"With the STs boost is achieved with almost any level of applied throttle. I wouldn't worry about much, just don't go to hard on it before the oil's warm and viscous enough to move to where it's needed. These cars are pretty stout and can take a good beating, every model of car from every make will have issues and every engine and component has the possibility to die, you'll have a warranty for that. Have fun! Shit happens just make sure you're having fun safely."

FocusST,3cmfxa,cru_jonze,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:03:50 2015 UTC,"It's not that complicated. No need idle, or worry about boosting at low rpms. I'd let it warm up before going WOT. Open loop tuning is advanced enough to retard timing in a situation where damage could occur."

I get in the car and it connects, if my Sirius xm app is open it plays what I was playing which is fine. But if it doesn't, it automatically plays the first song on my iTunes play list and that's super annoying.   Then, sometimes it will just stop playing sound. And to fix it I have to switch to the usb setting then back to Bluetooth.   My sync is a terrible set up I wish I could get rid of it forever."

FocusST,3cledv,like-a-bbas,2,Wed Jul 8 21:33:06 2015 UTC,I just hate the whole set up. I wish cars could have you install any car os you want. I would choose apple play in a heart beat.
FocusST,3cledv,Scribbl3d_Out,2,Wed Jul 8 21:43:26 2015 UTC,"For some reason the car feels it needs to play music on your phone over what you are playing at the moment.

So when I connect my phone to the car via USB it'll shut off my Spotify and play the ring tones on my phone cause they are the only audio files on my phone, it's really annoying."

Do you have any way to read in the DTC being generated? Depending on the code it might give you somewhere to start looking. Other option would be to take it to the dealer that did the install. I assume you went with FRPP stuff to retain your warranty so I would be inclined to let them figure it out.
FocusST,3ck0eq,strictlyfocused02,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:50:24 2015 UTC,I have the Ford racing tune on my 14 for 2 months now and haven't seen that message once. I think you should have the dealer pull the code and see what is causing it.
FocusST,3ck0eq,ralemzor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"Pull the code, even though the light is off again it will still be in the recent history block and whatever reader you use should be able to still pull it.  Once you know what the code is that it is throwing you can move from there.  Ocassional on cold start may be a missfire.  A missfire + a tune may just be a loose charge pipe going to your turbo.  the stock ones have been known to pop themselves off partially when you start tuning, if that's what happened the fix is pretty simple, new clamps on the charge pipe."
FocusST,3cinm2,MasterTre,2,Wed Jul 8 05:15:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I've heard if you're going to buy them don't buy the glue on ones buy the in channel ones because they work better.  Don't have any experience myself with them,  but the in channel ones seem like they look better."

Feel like they look a whole lot better without the obvious edge around the window.   I don't think you should have any issues with the outside ones though. Just be sure to clean the area very well with an alcohol pad before you do attach them. Try not to drive much or get them wet for the first 24 hours or so and realistically you should be fine."
FocusST,3cinm2,curiouschurro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:07:47 2015 UTC,The primary reason I got these was the appearance. What if I don't like the look? Will it look like shit when I take them off?
FocusST,3cinm2,curiouschurro,2,Wed Jul 8 17:58:49 2015 UTC,Just use some masking tape to hold them on at first. That way if you decide against it little-no residue to clean up.
FocusST,3cinm2,aducky18,2,Wed Jul 8 18:23:46 2015 UTC,I have the AVS deflectors on my ST and they've been great. They are the double sided tape kind. Only problem i have had with them is about 3 months after putting them on the front passenger one started coming off so i pulled it off and bought heavy duty double sided foam tape from target and resecured it. I also pulled the front driver one too and retaped it. Been fine since.
FocusST,3cinm2,aducky18,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:34:44 2015 UTC,Did the original tape leave any residue when it came off?
FocusST,3cinm2,turnittopwise,2,Thu Jul 9 01:57:55 2015 UTC,It left a little but I used rubbing alcohol and it came right off. After the rubbing alcohol there was no leftover residue and the paint was completely cleaned off.

I don't know for sure who put it there, dealer or factory but it's not attached by anything I can back out so I'm not messing with it. It is definitely mounted through a hole in the front bumper. Unfortunately, there's not much of a big reason why, but both plates are required in jersey (though I see many people who I'm surprised haven't gotten a ticket yet for having a loose front plate just sitting on their dashboard. That's illegal too.  In any case, I've driven in almost 100 degree heat, driven it kinda hard on the highway, the temp guage never goes past normal. Not even the oil so it's not a big deal to me."

I recently got a symposer delete and it seemed to reduce the sound of it in the cabin.  I only hear it of windows are down.    The BPV is located in passenger side wheel well.
