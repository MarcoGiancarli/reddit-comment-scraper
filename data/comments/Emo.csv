Emo,3dzrpo,NillasInTheRain,6,Mon Jul 20 21:16:08 2015 UTC,You'll have better luck getting a discussion on /r/PostHardcore but if you like glassjaw you should check out letlive and Envy on the Coast if you don't already listen to them.  As for vocalists that sound like Palumbo you should check out old Finch and new Finch as Palumbo was their vocalist's vocal coach and features on the older song. Also Deftones.
Emo,3dzrpo,kage6613,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:22 2015 UTC,"And you're right, the deftones do seem to hit a similar chord."
Emo,3dzrpo,NillasInTheRain,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:56 2015 UTC,"Further update. Didn't really enjoy Coast, but Letlive  was a lot of fun. A different perspective on a similar sound."
Emo,3dzrpo,ozpunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"See, I've always had a hard time enjoying post hardcore. In my own personal brain playlist Glassjaw falls somewhere else. I'll check out those other bands though! I tried Finch but they felt a little too scrubbed clean for me."
Emo,3dzrpo,SheepwithShovels,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:25 2015 UTC,"There is so much post hardcore dude it's impossible not to find something you like, you just have to get past the processed and packaged dime a dozen bands of the warped scene. Glassjaw are one of the big names in phc, huge in its modern development and progression; they are cited as an influence by many current acts. Emo itself is pretty much just an extension of post hardcore, and there is a lot of crossover."

Emo,3dxew2,skramzjusticewarrior,3,Mon Jul 20 16:08:09 2015 UTC,"Not into Loma Prieta?!  Wow, okay we gotta fix that. After those two from Punch joined LP they've become the screamo version of Punch.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH_wdqNCzOA  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO_fkR3Df_U  I.V is probably the heaviest screamo album in terms of sound to come out. Not because it's grind like Orchid or something but the noisy and gritty production just takes it to a physical level and it's so fucking awesome! I really, really recommend you take a listen to I.V."
Emo,3dxew2,SheepwithShovels,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:09 2015 UTC,I've actually heard Fly by Night and it's one of the songs I like by them. Especially that part that comes in at 1:50. Amazing.   Most of the time I'm kinda indifferent to their music. That's how I feel about Trilogy 4. I'll check out the rest of the album. I'm open to other suggestions of songs by them though.
Emo,3dxew2,Flexography,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:09 2015 UTC,"Trilogy 4-6 is a continuing giant on I.V, I recommend hearing it in its entirety. There's also a few melodic gems on the latter part of the album.  Loma Prieta - Aside from this distant shadow, there is nothing left  Loma Prieta - Uniform  There's also the Life/Less album by LP that came before I.V, it's kind of a mix between Last City, I.V and Beau Navire's style, might be up your alley.  Loma Prieta - Apparition"
Emo,3dxew2,Flexography,2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:06 2015 UTC,I've been listening to a good bit of Loma Prieta recently too. They're one of the best Skramz bands around right now.

""It's not right to make a tired example of how I failed"" makes me think they tried the long distance thing and it didn't work out. Some reminiscing on the old relationship makes the narrator want the lover again, leading to the ""If I could, then I would have Indiana (the ex-lover) by now."""
Emo,3dkpzg,westthomas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:28:11 2015 UTC,"It seems to me to be directly related to ""Sundays"" -- all the lyrics on the North End seem to be tied together talking about home and family and following and all that. The whole album seems to be reminiscing about an old flame that, by all accounts, seems to have parted ways on less-than-ideal terms that he blames himself for.  Here is ""Sundays"" lyrics for you.   I know I signify more to you than stability alone. Like August in a Mid-western state: Full of grace and half-broken bones, you're falling over your own unfortunate songs. You can soak in all the sun you want, but it won't burn away your home. You're so close to changing forever and I'm too close to my family to notice. This year had better make me a new man. This liar could reach out and find me. I don't look up to enough local heroes. I still don't feel inspired enough to change. You'll leave me more than a martyr would ask for With civil service and my conscience to blame. I'm sorry I made you lose focus. I didn't think you slept enough to dream of a never-ending need to follow and a never-ending need to try and persuade me.   So, like /u/westthomas has said, it seems like he's talking about the ex-lover and referring to either her or her behaviors/actions or their relationship as ""Indiana."" From what I can gather, it seems he's saying he would rather have her ""full of grace and half-broken bones, falling over her own unfortunate songs"" than being alone, reminding himself of how he's still set in his old ways, remembering his failures or perceived failures -- and I'm gathering that he had to move away (from Indiana) to be closer to family."

Emo,3dfq17,SheepwithShovels,6,Thu Jul 16 06:35:29 2015 UTC,"Brand New, Snowing, and TWIABP have my favorite lyrics in the Emo genre. A few of my other favorite lyrics come from Modest Mouse, Weezer, Radiohead, and Cage the Elephants last album, Melophobia. Algernon Cadwallader also touch on some deep subjects that can be difficult to talk about. I can't think of another band that addresses frog spit, much less support it."
Emo,3dfq17,tlmma,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:34:02 2015 UTC,I know brand new and twiabp. I'll check out snowing! I've listened to modest mouse and cage the elephant and weezer but I don't know them too well.
Emo,3dfq17,fix3db,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Snowing are pretty much the most Emo Emo band ever. I highly recommend listening to their entire discography which is far less daunting a task than it sounds since they released less than an hour of material.  The Lonesome Crowded West is my favorite album by Modest Mouse and Pinkerton is my favorite album by Weezer/favorite album of all time. Pinkerton has had a huge impact on Emo but iits debatable as to whether or not it actually is Emo. I'd also recommend Radiohead's 2nd, 3rd, and 4th albums."

It wasn't exactly the direction I was anticipating them to go after Hold Open My Head EP, I thought the vocals got more nasally/whiny and they maybe lost some of their edge that they had on HOMH however I still like it a lot.  I think the first release of the song Buttercups retained more of that edge and grit that was lost on the full length.   I saw them live in Columbus OH in November and they were fantastic. The dude can make a serious wall of sound with his guitar rig. Very fun to watch, brought lots of energy."

I get where there coming from but seriously it's just the most over the top way you can express yourself at the show.  That said I would never consider moshing at a Hotelier show. Even their first album wasn't strong enough to warrant that kinda action. Weird as hell that you would want to mosh to Home.
Emo,3cm91v,RufinTheFury,3,Thu Jul 9 05:43:53 2015 UTC,"People were moshing a little bit and crowd surfing a LOT at the mewithoutYou show in Atlanta during Foxing and mewithoutYou's sets.  I was a little shocked because none of that happened the last time I saw mewithoutYou.  I don't really consider Foxing or mewithoutYou something I would mosh to (except for maybe mewithoutYou's first album, but they don't play songs from it that often)."

Certain verses and different parts just completely clicked with me. Take Back Today is one of the only songs to have ever made me cry. Although I understand what you're saying. They're some of the oldest members of the newer Emo scene, age-wise, and it just kind of makes sense that dealing with that stuff they're facing is kind of alienating to some of the younger listeners.   *Not trying to say that I'm all cool and such a special snowflake for being younger and getting into a genre that's supposed to relate to me anyways.

Emo,3cli77,thismoonlife,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:56:07 2015 UTC,"I'm here for the music too.  That's why I'm getting sick of seeing Dads on here all the time.  They're one of the 5-7 bands that are ALWAYS talked about/posted here, and it's always the same conversations.  This is a place where we can really help bands get some traction.  That's been shown big time over the past year with bands like The Hotelier and Foxing. They really blew up last year, and a big part of that, outside of their obvious talent, was the attention they got on r/emo.  Why keep beating the dead horse with the same handful of bands when we can focus on something much more constructive?"

Emo,3cli77,Z_Man1209,0,Wed Jul 8 22:02:17 2015 UTC,Dads has/had quite the little marketing machine behind them for a very mediocre uninspired emo revival band. It's almost like they told everyone at all their shows to comb the emo forums and heavily promote them. As a huge fan of 90's/early 00's emo and some of the revival I can't listen to this...downvote...I don't care.

Emo,3cg7mj,Flexography,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:36:19 2015 UTC,"I want to ask this same question to someone who thinks tigers jaw is an emo band.  I just don't feel like they share any similarity to other bands which are traditionally called emo, unless it's just something like   They write about girl feelz They hang out with emo bands They have vocalists who can't sing well"
Emo,3cg7mj,djwm12,2,Wed Jul 8 02:43:42 2015 UTC,"Let me preface by saying what I believe about the emo genre. I think emo as a genre is very fluid and subjective. You've got bands like The Front Bottoms which has a markedly different style than American Football. American Football is acoustically different from Brand New. And Brand New is a different style than Tigers Jaw... (etc. etc.) What I love about emo, at least since I've gotten into it 15 months ago, is that the genre has more to do with introspection and identity than many other genres I've explored. And in many ways, though the ""message"", as it were, from each band is different, they all are thematically similar with their sincere lyrics. Most emo bands can be characterized as evocative.   That being said, I feel like Tigers Jaw fits the evocative characteristic. And usually emo bands tour together since it helps fans from one band hear another band, as well as having logistically be easier.  Most genres write about girl feelz in one way or another. Relationships and feelings are somethings most people can relate to and that's why nearly all genres will have some form of girl feelz in it. Vocalists who can't sing well, hmm. Well, emo isn't about voice, it's about lyricism and arguably poetry.   To be honest, emo is super hard to define but you know when you hear it, if that makes sense?"
Emo,3cg7mj,Flexography,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:53:52 2015 UTC,"Dude, if that's how you want to classify emo, I get why you would call bands like Tigers Jaw and The Front Bottoms emo, but I just really don't think that's the right characterization.  I think ""evocative"" music & music with ""sincere lyrics"" (or even sincere lyrics having to do with certain themes) is just way too broad a characterization of emo.  To me, at least, that seems to include all sorts of music which I would never dream of calling emo."
Emo,3cg7mj,djwm12,0,Wed Jul 8 03:28:32 2015 UTC,"That's the whole point though, and it's why emo is hard to characterize. It really encompasses A LOT. Now, whether or not you agree with what it encompasses, that's why people debate genres all the time."
Emo,3cg7mj,SnarkKnight,2,Wed Jul 8 03:39:53 2015 UTC,"what is Tigers Jaw then? honest question. I would consider them emo, but mostly because other people say so and I don't know what else you would call it. I would say its distinctively different than pop punk or indie music, but I don't know how else to classify that difference"
Emo,3cg7mj,Flexography,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:24:02 2015 UTC,"Belongs to the dead was just 100% a lofi indie album.

Although this song is very hard to understand lyrically, (It's presumed to be a criticism on the Republican Party) it gives off a vibe of longing and desperation. It is sad, yet beautiful. Makes me yearn for the things that I have never had.    Mineral - Take The Picture Now    I don't know what this song is about either. I think it may be about religious faith.

Emo,3ca6gr,stanleyacid,2,Mon Jul 6 08:56:42 2015 UTC,It's actually an open A tuning with a sus4 on the bottom. Or at least that's what the entire first record was. I think they changed it up for the other releases. I'm on mobile but I've posted about it before. It's A LOT of fun to play in and I've been messing with it a lot recently and have come up with some cool things.   Fun fact: it's the same tuning as Clairvoyant by The Story So Far and a couple of American Football songs including Never Meant just transposed a full step up/down.

Remind me of the Appleseed Cast Mineral - specifically the Endserenading album Empire! Empire! (i was a lonely estate) Coping Hightide Hotel - specifically the song Sippin' on Monster Everyone Everywhere Glocca Morra - a lot more punk-sounding and yelly but Just Married is a master piece IMO) Early Foxing  Grown Ups - Mixture of twinkle emo and pop punk.

Emo,3c12bf,highkingnm,3,Fri Jul 3 20:04:44 2015 UTC,Moose Blood was so wonderful at Warped. Those guys really stood out from the other bands in the best way :D
Emo,3c12bf,icantmakesenseofit,2,Fri Jul 3 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"Moose Blood, The Wonder Years, Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties, and Have Mercy made me want to go but i decided against it. I went to Warped last year and enjoyed it, but there's definitely less bands i care about on the tour every year."
Emo,3c12bf,OrangeAdventure,2,Sat Jul 4 01:41:05 2015 UTC,"I thought they had one of the best line ups this year, but I never go to WT for emo music.  I expect a mix of poppunk, post-hardcore and metalcore.  Was WT ever good for emo bands?  I saw about 10 bands that were really good, and I plan on catching the tour again for the Seattle or Portland date in August to see some of the bands I missed.  BTW, I saw TWY and they killed it.  Aaron West was good too, but the acoustic stage was placed way too close to the Kevin stage and so Soupy waited like 10 minutes for the other set to end and only played 5 songs and didn't do any of the cool in character things he normally does for his Aaron West shows."
Emo,3c12bf,Pandos636,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:49:02 2015 UTC,"I've heard of the earlier emo-pop punk bands like Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional playing Warped as well as bands like Have Mercy but never anything like Foxing or The Hotelier or whatever. The thing about TWY though is that i already saw them last October in a venue that was significantly smaller, tickets were cheaper, and the band sounding better than they would've at a big stage at Warped, but i would've liked to hear some new songs. I've never seen Aaron West before but i've wanted to, it's a shame Soupy didn't play in character as Aaron like he normally does. Maybe he was still mad about the Front Porch Step thing."
Emo,3c12bf,OrangeAdventure,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:53:40 2015 UTC,"Nah, this was the 2nd or 3rd day of the tour.  He was in character, he just didn't do the monologues between songs that he normally does.  He did a short intro, played Our Apartment, short monologue, then did 4 songs in a row and ended the set.  He was just crunched on time and didn't want to try to play at the same time as the shitty band on the stage next to him."
Emo,3c12bf,Pandos636,4,Sat Jul 4 02:03:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like one of the only people that found a good number of bands that I would have wanted to see (I think I counted like, 17?). Hell, the closest date for me is PDX, so I could still go. But I'm not supporting Kevin Lyman and Warped now. Not after that shit he pulled with his allowing Front Porch Step to play."
Emo,3c12bf,Z_Man1209,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:06:32 2015 UTC,I swear the FPS thing could be the start of the death of Warped. Lyman really needs to show he's distancing himself from stuff like that. Especially as people like Hayley Williams have already complained about how misogynistic the tour is.
Emo,3c12bf,Z_Man1209,2,Mon Jul 6 21:41:48 2015 UTC,"It seems like Lyman is doing the exact opposite. With the FPS thing he's basically saying, ""Fuck you guys, this is my tour and I'll do what I want."" IMO, there needs to be more of a committee around Warped's lineup. Get a group of people together that will ensure things like, gender representation and treatment, the safety of the attendees, and a bunch of other stuff. Warped is pretty much one of the biggest tours ever. Keeping the lineup up to pretty much one guy (or at least one guy that gets held accountable) is pretty stupid for as huge as this tour is. Things like the FPS fiasco are how you lose sponsors. Kevin is sending a lot of really negative messages with that. He needs to step down."

In the future, the Warped Tour demographic will probably be marketed a more watered down version of this music again but hopefully it doesn't get as bad as last decade."

Emo,3c2wt9,Flexography,3,Sun Jul 5 09:53:48 2015 UTC,"a rant from someone who's not white against every single white person   It seemed more to me like someone in a popular emo band was speaking out about casual racism that they encounter in the scene.  If you interpreted that differently, it strongly suggests that you didn't pay much attention to what you were reading.   It tells us about the scene right?   I have this nagging suspicion that if I were to present you with the opinions of random emo-goers, or whatever, you would say that they were just looking for attention, or making things up, or that their experiences weren't representative. If you don't think it says something about our community that high-profile people in it face casual racism, good for you.    I'd say ""maybe if you actually got out and talked to people about this, you'd realize that you have no idea what you are talking about"", but I feel like you aren't one to change your mind on the basis of evidence.

Emo,3bziyt,RossBoss95,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:40:32 2015 UTC,Play something to them that doesn't sound like what they're expecting emo to sound like. I remember playing Little League to a few of my friends and they wouldn't have once guessed it was emo.

Emo,3bvzu2,solips_sonder,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:46:12 2015 UTC,I think it's a fun album but Dream Blue Haze was definitely the best and strongest song. I wish they all were on a similar level.  edit: I'd say My Marble Home is the second strongest off this album. The rest just really fell flat of what I was hoping for. It starts of with this really energetic piece that makes me happy and feel warm but after that it's like they couldn't write anything else that compared to Dream Blue Haze.

EDIT: I do like the song ""Award of the Year Award"", but I don't think I could like more than one of their songs at a time. They all kind of sound the same and the band just seems really formulaic. They don't seem to be innovators like Foxing or bands like that, they seem more interested in cranking out music."

Emo,3biudn,KLKid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:23:16 2015 UTC,"Grow Up Dude is the album that got me into them and still my favourite, it definitely grows on you.  I really like their new EP Pioneer of Nothing, their first album The Past In Present and their EP of Weezer Blue album covers (You blue It). Keep Doing What You're Doing doesn't offer much for me as it's more of the same stuff as Grow Up Dude but not as memorable perhaps.  I think their guitar work is really cool, a lot of cool voicings and arpeggios, the songs are pretty catchy too.  Definitely a great band to get into if you come from more of a pop-rock band background like others mentioned before. These two tracks really stood out to me, first one is off The Past and Present (so their older stuff) and the other off Pioneer of Nothing (really new). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yQ1g8wbsPY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fcEyTotqCs"

Since then, I've seen them 10+ times, in 5 different states. I've had them stay the night at my house a few times. At this point, I definitely consider them friends.  Honestly though, my favorite music of them is from their first EP. They had a different front man/song writer/singer at the time. It's much more slow paced emo. It's probably my favorite EP of all time.  https://youblewit.bandcamp.com/album/ep"

There's only really a couple Dads songs i like, so i've never been too motivated to go to a show, meet them and find out what they're like.  I also heard something about how John Bradley is a misogynist, but again, i've never heard anything supporting that."

Emo,3b337t,RossBoss95,0,Mon Jun 29 23:38:45 2015 UTC,Because they sound super lame and uninteresting. Their music is just so bland IMO. They're like the musical equivalent of a stale rice cake.

Emo,3b337t,rjgoathead,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:45:20 2015 UTC,"I saw Dads with Touché Amoré and again with Kevin Devine. Not a huge fan of their music aside for ""Shit Twins"" and ""Boat Rich,"" but they are incredible live. Lots of energy and it takes a lot of skill to sing and drum at the same time. I do agree that their music uses very similar guitar work and vocal melodies throughout their songs."
Emo,3b337t,chrismiles94,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:22:23 2015 UTC,"Fuck Dads, but this song is actually incredibly good"

Emo,3b337t,gmoscausenuclearwar,3,Fri Jun 26 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"There are two ""everyone""s.   Randos on reddit and shit: Just heard bad stories from all sorts of people in the scene about them being massive douchbags, sexists, jerks to other people in the scene, and so on.  A lot of this was compounded by (2). Actual like people in bands and shit: People in various bands have talked shit about Dads, basically echoing the same sentiments of randos.  Apparently people feel like Dads are exploitative too, and shit.   For me, it's literally just hearsay... but I've heard nothing but bad things about them, from so many people.   And, besides this song, their music isn't even great either."
Emo,3b337t,Flexography,2,Fri Jun 26 02:06:30 2015 UTC,"Everyone thinks they're shitty people because there was stories on Tumblr about how they did some mean stuff, but no one knows if those are actually true. People who have met them actually say they're the nicest guys ever. It's kinda lame that a pretty alright band in the genre is hate on so much but no one has actual evidence as to why we hate them.   Oh, also, they're boring to listen to and every song is the same. I do love them, though."

Emo,3ayq3a,toke81,7,Wed Jun 24 19:21:48 2015 UTC,He's unrecognizable. Somehow he's gotten younger and thinner and less attractive.

Shoutout to Chris Carrabba and /u/tommullen for actually caring about music and not being pretentious knobgoblins."
Emo,3ayq3a,Dinoshores,-2,Thu Jun 25 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"running a website called ""is this band emo?"" is the definition of pretension. /u/tommullen has been cool in our interactions on here, but let's not act like he and /u/crocken are coming from a completely different perspective. Tom is just nicer about it.  FWIW, I couldn't give less of a fuck about Chris Carrabba's opinion of emo revival records. Dude is a hack who hasn't done anything worthwhile except for a half-decent record 15 years ago. Dashboard Confessional was considered a schlocky joke in the emo scene when Swiss Army came out. Why it's suddenly cool to like Dashboard Confessional is perhaps the greatest mystery of the emo revival."

Emo,3ayq3a,crocken,0,Thu Jun 25 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"lol... exactly. I mean, it's pretty cool that he's made a name and niche for himself based on being a 30-something emo kid. I envy that.   As for Dashboard... I remember hearing it and thinking ""Chris is leaving FSF to do this?"" It was the token cd you put on in the car when you didn't want to offend your date. Ah well, it got him nice stuff and he touched a lot of boobs. Good for him."

Emo,3att8f,GGoodman09,6,Tue Jun 23 13:28:43 2015 UTC,I think they are definitely trying to ween out the quirkiness and trying to be a lot more indie
Emo,3att8f,a_tall_man,7,Wed Jun 24 01:12:53 2015 UTC,Is anyone else disappointed by this and the last few songs they put out. Mat used to have the sickest drum parts and now this? And just the song writing and production. Everything is so bland compared to their older stuff
Emo,3att8f,therollingclouds,3,Tue Jun 23 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"I liked the previously released track, but it still did lack a tiny bit. Talon of the hawk was a great album, for them to top that must be tough. I think they might hoping for lyrical hooks? I really don't like this song though."
Emo,3att8f,Cringebot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like this song sounded a lot like their older stuff, like I Hate My Friends and My Grandma vs Pneumonia. Personally, I'm really hoping they go back to that noise, and this song is a good reminder. The only thing I don't really like is the way Brian Sella changed his voice up a bit, but I feel like had he not the synth noises they use wouldn't have blended well."
Emo,3att8f,KrisndenS,6,Thu Jun 25 01:17:31 2015 UTC,This song is awesome except for the 'hands in the air like you just don't care bit.' It made me cringe a little.
Emo,3att8f,NotMySpiders,3,Tue Jun 23 19:10:50 2015 UTC,It feels a bit tongue in cheek to me
Emo,3att8f,KnvckleFvck,4,Tue Jun 23 19:12:42 2015 UTC,"It's definitely tongue in cheek. I think it wasn't done very well though. It was meant to throw off the listener by saying a phrase associated with partying and having fun and then putting it in a different context when he repeats 'I don't care' over and over again.  The problem is the change in meaning isn't clear enough and it's not dramatic enough of a change to really have impact, at least in my opinion."

Emo,3ahnay,marinebiologist10,7,Sat Jun 20 11:12:23 2015 UTC,"FTB   Most genres are defined 100% by their sound. In contrast, Emo is defined more by their lyricism. Not 100%, but here's an example: Rap is defined by their lyricism, but there's always an undertone sound, unless you count Kid Rock or something weird as part of the genre. That sound defines that genre, but for Emo, sound is a really flexible part of what we like. On one end of the spectrum, you have heavy rockers like La Dispute, and on the other end you have sappy acoustic like Dashboard.   Additionally, we run into trouble because Emo isn't a genre created by musicians; it's a genre created by fans. Much like ""Nerd Culture"" today, Emo was a shunned label really until the ""Revival."" (If there ever was one) So we have to look at the genre through a lens that we created; that we put these bands into; which was (and, to a degree, still is) coincidentally based on our own emotion about the bands we listen to.   So, really, I don't think there's a bright-line rule that you can follow, more of a case by case basis. What makes Drive Like Jehu Emo? Is it the same thing that makes Slint emo? What about a band like Cap'n Jazz and TWiaBP?   If there's anything that ties them together, it would be the lyricism. Maybe you could look at the intricate guitar patterns that get borrowed from other obscure genres like math rock. But that's only if I have to label it. I'd much rather say Emo is Emo, and I'll know it when I hear it.   While above I mentioned that the Emo Revival isn't really a ""Revival"", I think it's because I believe it's more of a renaissance. Look at Punk. In the 80's, Punk was Punk. You didn't have many branches or subcategories, but as time went by, and the Internet changed the way we discover, listen and thus create music, we started seeing other types of punk. Do you think some garage Punk band in 1985 would think that Pop Punk fits into their mold at all?   I think that's where Emo is going; it's just changing and branching out. And I think that's what makes some bands successful. You have bands that have stayed true to their rock roots, like Brand New and Sunny Day Real Estate; and you have bands that have tried to mix genres into this muddled genre, like The Front Bottoms' folk influences.   So putting a label on what ""makes a band emo"" is just going to be broken by the next big thing. And because we're a genre created by fans, I think it's going to be up to us to decide if we like the music, and if that music fits into the picture of what makes these other bands so meaningful to us."
Emo,3ahnay,kolton---,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"not sure where you pulled this from, but it's not very accurate. 1. Emo was not ""shunned as a label"" until the revival. 2. Slint has never been considered emo. 3. If it was all about the lyricism, I could name about 1000 bands that are not considered emo but should be by that metric. 4. In the 80s, there were tons of off-shoots of the punk genre, including pop-punk (The Adolescents, The Queers), ska-punk (Op Ivy), post-punk, hardcore punk, street punk, etc etc.    The fact is, there are no hard and fast rules for what constitutes ""emo"" and this sub is never going to agree on more than 85 - 90% of the bands that should be included."

Emo,3ahnay,crocken,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:02:12 2015 UTC,"midnight organ fight is one of the greatest breakup records OF ALL TIME. but it fits into the same mold as The Good Life's albums (check them out if you havent), which is Tim Kasher's decidedly ""not emo"" band.  Its just good indie rock.  I would say one reason both of these acts are not emo is that the 'maturity' of the catharsis in these records/bands is decidedly not youthful, which is part of traditional emo (so like...some frightened rabbit songs and modern baseball songs are sonically the exact same thing, but since MoBo is coming from a college-aged mentality, its 'emo')"

Emo,3agm6m,Coldnessthrowaway,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:11:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry I couldn't fit a list of exact politicians names into that 2 second space. If you want to make a debate out of it feel free to cite your sources for your claim, but this is a music subreddit and no one's really here for that. If you paid attention to the context clues in the song, or just the uploader of the video, you'd see that this song is about the American south. Hell, this video was shot in Tennessee. I find when people say something is preachy it usually means it's a real problem that they don't feel like doing anything about and they've been made to feel uncomfortable."
Emo,3agm6m,Coldnessthrowaway,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:18:59 2015 UTC,"I am female and lesbian, and very pro abortion but, I feel this issue arises a lot because when you label something as ""Men decided"" or ""men are the issue"" It is very.. construe'd because now you are flipflopping the issue and condemning men which is what usually happens in these situations. It's almost like when a white man kills a black man, he is a racist murderer, but when you look at the bigger picture, and the real statistics of racial killings you see that it's different then what is displayed .. and using men as the scapegoat instead of what it truly is (Christianity) people will get their feelings mixed on a situation.  Sorry if that sounds weird, English is my second language, and I have a reading comprehension issue :P."
Emo,3agm6m,Coldnessthrowaway,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:28:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think a white man killing a black man is a racist. That's a pretty big hoop to jump through. I'm not a tumblr SJW type. Facts don't upset me. The facts are, as I replied in your other comment, that men make up an overwhelming majority and it'd be ridiculous to not see it. I agree that the Christian majority is a big part of the problem too. I feel like this guy only heard the first line of the song and shut everything else out."

If you're looking for a genre to throw at them and want to avoid saying the E word, Indie Math Punk, Indie Rock, and Twinkledaddies sort of work."
Emo,3abvub,SheepwithShovels,10,Thu Jun 18 22:49:15 2015 UTC,because peoples eyes tend to glaze over if you cant describe your sound in like three words
Emo,3abvub,SnarkKnight,8,Thu Jun 18 23:22:19 2015 UTC,"no way someone who knows nothing about emo would know anything about ""twinkledaddies"", which is quite possibly the worst term to describe anything. also, indie math punk, twinkly rock, that means nothing to someone who knows nothing of emo.   indie rock is probably the only answer."
Emo,3abvub,myblackcat,4,Fri Jun 19 00:57:46 2015 UTC,"I usually say angsty pop punk, but my music is bordering between emo and pop punk anyway. or I say emo, because if even if they don't know ""real emo"" the My Chemical Romance type sound that people think of isn't that far off anyway"
Emo,3abvub,SnarkKnight,2,Thu Jun 18 23:28:17 2015 UTC,You could say 'melodic punk.'
Emo,3abvub,velmaspaghetti,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"I used to say ""punk"" with an emphasis on being more indie, whilst mostly holding punk values/ethics.  If people seemed genuinely interested after that I'd drop the e-bomb and properly explain it."
Emo,3abvub,pizzan0mics,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:19:01 2015 UTC,"Aha good question. I've been having this issue with my band, for us, I'd say we are in the same realm as moneen, moving mountains, the world is a beautiful place and brand new so I usually say things like alternative rock/post rock or emo rock/post rock.  Post rock would help describe our use of effects, and atmospheric instrumental sound and then alternative/emo rock implies there are vocals.  I find indie rock misleading because in my mind it triggers bands like Tokyo Police Club, The Strokes, The Arcade Fire and bands in that sound realm although it could still be acceptable depending on your sound.  Where as pop-rock makes me think Blink 182, Green Day, All Time Low etc but I guess these can influence emo sounds.  Since emo like all genres has a wide range of sub-genres blended in you can use those them help, for example bands like american football and tiny moving parts can be associated with math rock due to their use of alternate tunings, time signature changes or tapping guitar parts where as bands like You Blew It! may fit better with pop rock bands. Bleh genres are tricky aha, I think this group even has debates about what makes emo, emo while most people probably just assume its what I see to referred here as ""mall emo""."

Emo,3a4ddg,buffchixdip,7,Wed Jun 17 03:25:29 2015 UTC,Easily the best song on the album.  Been listening to it since it came out and I'm still not tired of it.
Emo,3a4ddg,Pandos636,6,Wed Jun 17 05:19:59 2015 UTC,One of the best records ever. I'm torn between this and An Introduction To The Album being my favorite.

Emo,3a4ddg,RufinTheFury,5,Wed Jun 17 12:45:19 2015 UTC,I think In Framing is their best. Dendron is still good but In Framing just has that huge emotional punch at the end that nails me every time. Way too relatable.
Emo,3a4ddg,GoodMolemanToYou,4,Wed Jun 17 05:45:28 2015 UTC,"I like In Framing best as well, with The Scope of all This Rebuilding as a close second. One thing I love about this album is how every song is someone's favorite."

Emo,39yit3,TheSanePsychotic,2,Tue Jun 16 04:01:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say Eye Alaska would be a good shout. Broken up now, but their only album (Genesis Underground, released on Fearless) is something I frequently come back to. Very good listen. I don't know if you could tar them with an emo brush, but they originate from that scene. American Landslide is a great track.  Oh, and maybe Melee. Devils and Angels is quite a decent album. You've probably heard ""Built to Last"" before.  Finally, I remember Mark Rose (of Spitalfield fame) releasing quite a strange poppy album after his band broke up."

Emo,39yit3,Duckspeedwell,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:44:55 2015 UTC,"Owen, maybe. But that's literally all I can think of, some of his tunes have a real, r&b/soul vibe."
Emo,39yit3,crocken,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:20:24 2015 UTC,"R&B is basically the antithesis to Math when it comes to drumming/bassline stuff, so... its a hard line.  Take angular guitar work and place traditional RnB backend to it and... you get Spoon and the best moments of Modest Mouse."
Emo,39yit3,killinhimer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:31:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, I feel odd doing this shameless plug but felt it was relevant -- My band Analog Bandits has been having this debate for some time. My drummer hates most math and really wants to play R&B influenced drums, while I try to write more math-guitar stuff. Honestly, most of his and my parts get tossed because they don't work together, but somehow we end up finishing some songs (after much debate and gutting). I end up making my parts a bit simpler & understandable, and he makes his rhythms more heady to fit with odd time signatures.    Basically, It can work. It's just ... you're exactly correct, it is very difficult because they are at odds."
Emo,39yit3,chrismiles94,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:17:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really consider these bands emo, but a lot of people in this scene listen to them.  ""Uneasy Hearts Weigh the Most"" by Dance Gavin Dance and ""18"" by Anarbor are pretty bluesy/jazzy sounding."

Emo,39yit3,killinhimer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:22:06 2015 UTC,"Probably best bet would be early mae . It really depends on what part of R&B you are influenced by. Bass is fairly easy to find, but it's often buried. And vocals can also be found (e.g. Jonny Craig)    My band (to a point) is influenced by R&B as well, but we are a bit more prog than emo : Analog Bandits    And... even further away... The Reign of Kindo -- Fantastic band, but really stretching ""emo"" out for this one..."

There's admittedly a great deal of nostalgia for me towards this record since I discovered it at age 14 or so but I still listen to it constantly. I actually met Chris Carrabba at the country music hall of fame here in Nashville about a month ago, he was just there looking at the exhibit and I stood and talked to him about this record and everything else he ever did. One of THE nicest guys ever, so genuine and cool. Definitely made me love his music even more."

Emo,39t540,ozpunk,2,Sun Jun 14 20:36:40 2015 UTC,"'How To Start A Fire' was solid but they lost me on the third album, 'Hide Nothing' — and if you've ever heard the live album recorded after that release, it just sounds like a band completely and utterly out of gas. But the reunion album they made with Chris Carrabba a few years back, 'Penny Black,' was really good, IMO."

Emo,39tat7,theselfescaping,5,Sun Jun 14 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"I definitely think the list needs to be revised. I'm a fan of Grown Ups but are they really classic or influential enough to be featured there? The same goes for Tigers Jaw and The Front Bottoms (who are really more of a folk punk band that's has Emo influences). I don't think Modern Baseball or Dads should be on there either but I think that might have more to do with me not liking them. In my opinion, we should take another vote. I also question whether or not we need to keep the Screamo list since /r/Screamo is becoming a little more active and this sub rarely has any screamo on it."
Emo,39tat7,DangleMyStash,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:49:57 2015 UTC,"instead of a recommended listening list, you could just type out the map of emo on the sidebar, instead of linking to it. it'd make the sidebar longer, but there'd be less clutter, and you wouldn't have to recommend an album along with the band."

Emo,39tat7,toke81,3,Mon Jun 15 18:10:26 2015 UTC,"The list definitely needs a significant update.  I frequent /r/indieheads and they did an indie essentials nomination/vote. I think we should do the same here. Obviously it would be fewer albums than their list and far fewer than the map of emo, but that would make it less intimidating for genre newbs.  I definitely think we need a rule, though, that we set a minimum threshold for the number of albums from the 80s/90s. For example, maybe no more than 50 - 60% of the albums on the list be from the last 10 years. The map of emo was heavily skewed toward the revival (a reflection of the dominant readership here), but we should ensure that there is more ""classic"" representation than on the current list."

I'm not a massive fan of Moss Icon, but you're right, they defo deserve their place on there!  Good list dude."

Emo,39es2b,delithresh,2,Thu Jun 11 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"Mother by Runaway Brother is a great indie emo album to smoke to. Brightside and most of the bands under Broken World Media are also great choices. TWIABP, Old Gray, Sorority Noise. Rozwell Kid is on that label, though not really emo, I'd still heavily recommend them."

Emo,393k3q,Necral,8,Tue Jun 9 00:27:19 2015 UTC,Have you listened to their old album 'It Never Goes Out' from when they went by The Hotel Year? If not you should check it out its just as good imo  The Hotel Year - Lonely Hearts Club
Emo,393k3q,space_dogg,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:49:27 2015 UTC,Yes! I was really into that album when i was more so into Pop-Punk. I'm not particularly into the upbeat stuff as much anymore.
Emo,393k3q,jyrkesh,6,Tue Jun 9 02:03:39 2015 UTC,"As others have said:   Dads - I'll Be The Tornado Foxing - The Albatross The Premier - The Live Like You're Dying EP (super old, very poor production, but it's Soupy doing great Progress-era emo before The Wonder Years) anything Weatherbox. Seriously. It's all awesome, way underrated in the emo scene IMHO"
Emo,393k3q,tbc31cc,3,Tue Jun 9 08:17:34 2015 UTC,The Premier sounds interesting. I do enjoy Dan Campbell's voice and i think it'd be neat to hear him so young if it was before TWY. I'm also going to check out the others for sure! The Wonder Years is actually another band that is more so poppy or Pop-Punk that i will always follow because Soupy's writing is brilliant and the band meshes really well together. I've seen them live numerous times as well.
Emo,393k3q,Mynameislouie,3,Tue Jun 9 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"Have you heard Soupy's solo stuff? He goes by Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties, and it has his typical lyrics/writing style. The music is a mix of acoustic/folk though, so it doesn't address the OP at all haha."
Emo,393k3q,charlestylerperkins,2,Tue Jun 9 20:18:44 2015 UTC,seconding Weatherbox but i wouldn't really say they're comparable. American Art and Flies In All Directions are absolute masterpieces though.
Emo,393k3q,jyrkesh,2,Tue Jun 9 11:26:41 2015 UTC,People know about The Premier!? I haven't heard that name in so long. What are we going to talk about next Up Up Down Down?
Emo,393k3q,charlestylerperkins,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:59:11 2015 UTC,"Not really similar to The Hotelier, but every time I talk to Evan Weiss at a concert I ask about when the Up Up Down Down reunion is coming.  I used to ask about The Progress too, and they're playing Fest this year. :D"
Emo,393k3q,jyrkesh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:36:31 2015 UTC,every time I talk to Evan Weiss at a concert I ask about when the Up Up Down Down reunion is coming.   What are we like the same person? This is generally what I ask too. I have been waiting for a Progress show for 10 years. I live in Fl and got to see them about 4 times live.   Are you going to Fest?   Edit: I am still holding out for a Like Lions reunion.
Emo,393k3q,charlestylerperkins,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:54:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure yet. I'm literally on the opposite corner of the country, but I might be willing to splurge because The Progress.  And yeah, as much as everyone shits on the idea of an ""emo revival"" I'm really, really happy that people like us who have been fans of this music for 10-20 years are finally coming together through communities like this (and not just on super obscure forums)."
Emo,393k3q,jyrkesh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:59:28 2015 UTC,"Fest is one of the best live experiences I have ever had. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. There is way more music than you will be able to experience, there will be time conflicts but it all works out in the end. Shoot me a message if you need any help making plans for hotels and stuff.   The revival has been one of the best things for live music. I got into Emo back in 2003-2004 and there wasn't a whole lot going on in the scene (or that I knew about at least). I finally get to see all the bands I have always wanted to see."
Emo,393k3q,tbc31cc,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:10:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man! I really appreciate that.   And absolutely. In the last few years I've gotten to see The Get Up Kids, Texas is the Reason, and American Football. I never dreamed in a million years that I'd even get to see one of them. Still gotta check out Progress, Braid, and I'm hoping SDRE does (another) one too."
Emo,393k3q,post-rocker,5,Wed Jun 10 22:29:41 2015 UTC,"I think ""The Lack Long After"" by Pianos Become the Teeth has a similar sense of devestation, except it's a little heavier than The Hotelier."
Emo,393k3q,Pandos636,3,Tue Jun 9 02:49:02 2015 UTC,"fuck yeah, this is such a good album"
Emo,393k3q,KeepThingsFresh,6,Tue Jun 9 18:02:47 2015 UTC,"Defeater definitely has that soul-crushing devastation, but it's melodic hardcore and a lot heavier than The Hotelier.  If you don't already listen to them, start at the first song and go in chronological order with Blessed Burden.  The story is absolutely fantastic and is terribly sad."
Emo,393k3q,Pandos636,3,Tue Jun 9 02:35:22 2015 UTC,Defeater is a band I recommend to anybody who doesn't usually listen to music with screaming because the story of the 1st two albums is so powerful
Emo,393k3q,post-rocker,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:55:01 2015 UTC,"Quite a few of my friends listen to Defeater and i just haven't really thought to try to get into them. I understand a lot of it is about fatherly issues or at least the song ""I Don't Mind"" (I THINK that's what it's called) as one of my friends did a cover of that a while back. I just might finally dive in and listen to them haha."
Emo,393k3q,GoodMolemanToYou,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:47:10 2015 UTC,"There is a pretty good synapsis on their Wikipedia page. The story is about a post-WWII family that struggles with poverty.  The 3 different albums are from different family member's perspectives (younger son, older son, and father). There are a lot of songs that are the same story from a different perspective. The song ""Bastard"" is the same as ""Blessed Burden"" from the perspective of the father instead of the younger son.  I Don't Mind is part of a 4 song set of slower songs off the second album. It's a love song about the older brother and his wife. The song ""Empty Glass"" is the same story, but not acoustic. Those are the only two happy songs I can think of in all of their album."
Emo,393k3q,itchd,7,Tue Jun 9 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"You're trying to typify a new wave of emo masterpiece. They're pretty unique as it is.  That being said, hearken back to the 90's! The Promise Ring gets me feeling angsty. Cursive is and forever will be close by me too.   A Great Big Pile of Leaves, You Blew It! This list is straying a bit, so in other, non-emo notes (ik it's /r/emo but fuck the police), Sun Kil Moon is poignant, and I love me Owen / American Football / anything Mike Kinsella. I dunno, man, just go exploring."
Emo,393k3q,isarealboy772,3,Tue Jun 9 00:38:00 2015 UTC,Definitely hear some Weakerthans influence in their less screamy stuff.
Emo,393k3q,crocken,3,Tue Jun 9 02:13:32 2015 UTC,"I agree completely on that one. ""Housebroken"" definitely has a ""Plea From A Cat Named Virtue"" feel to it for sure!"
Emo,393k3q,GoodMolemanToYou,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:17:51 2015 UTC,"And, if you ever feel like a good cry, listen to ""Virtute the Cat Explains her Departure"".  That song destroyed me the first time I heard it."

I guess its probably the voice, but everytime i listen to hotelier it reminds me of it.  I should point out this isn't meant as an insult. My modern rock (matchbox20, thirdeyeblind, chalkfarm, vertical horizon, etc.) phase morphed into my emo phase."
Emo,393k3q,NeonBodyStyle,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"the chorus/shouty-first part then singier second part of all the verses in Your Deep Rest is VEryveryVERY vertical horizon sounding, that whole song in general sounds like a random ' modern rock' song from 1998."

Emo,393k3q,Placentaur,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:07:58 2015 UTC,"Not an album, but a cover they did that is absolutely brilliant The hotelier - Songs so Sad"
Emo,393k3q,Placentaur,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"A few bands I've been listening to that have the same kind of punk energy but remain emo are Free Throw, Monument, and Donovan Wolfington. Free Throw comes up on this subreddit a lot, but a lot of people find all their material is really good. The thing is though that these bands try their best to get their own sound, and most of the bands that do great music have really original elements to them in the first place which is probably what made you like them. Just listen to everything that gets posted here and see if it clicks."
Emo,393sq9,SheepwithShovels,2,Tue Jun 9 01:34:47 2015 UTC,Yep! They used to play shows (at least one FOR SURE that I know of) with Andrew Jackson Jihad

Emo,386nu9,D34THC10CK,2,Tue Jun 2 06:29:19 2015 UTC,I really like my squier VM modified and it was pretty cheap
Emo,386nu9,CaptianSpaghettiIce,2,Tue Jun 2 14:41:20 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming this is your first guitar. Is that right?   You can go two ways with this. If you're just starting out and don't know whether you'll like playing guitar,  then you could look at the Squier affinity series for cheapest. One of those will let you know if you like playing guitar or not, but if you do like it you'll be wanting to upgrade pretty quick. You can find a diamond in the rough,  but affinitys usually aren't that great.   For best bang-for-your-buck you'll want to look at the Squier classic vibe and vintage modified series. Both of these series are very well liked.  I've owned an VM jazz bass myself and it was a solid instrument. A good guitar from one of these series will probably last you until you're of intermediate skill and will still be a good guitar even when you're advanced.   Now, if this is your first guitar, a few tips:  Play it first. Instead of buying online, go into a store and play the guitar you're planning to buy. And not just a guitar that's the same model, the exact guitar you're going to buy. Quality control is pretty good in the VM and CV series but duds still do happen.   If possible, take someone who already plays guitar to the store with you. The more skilled the better. They'll know what to look for to make sure it doesn't have any glaring flaws in the build quality.   I always recommend buying used. Used guitars aren't in pristine condition, but probably only have minor cosmetic damage and you generally get way more guitar for your money.  It really helps here to have someone skilled along with you.   Also, this is a good question to pose to /r/guitar. Honestly, you should just search ""new guitar"" and ""first guitar"" in that subreddit and you'll probably find some great advice. They get questions like this one a lot."

I don't really have a particular amp right now.  I was playing through an old Acoustic bass amp in my last band, and I've been playing through a Vox VT15 for practice lately, but when I record I just go straight into the DI box from my pedalboard - no amp at all.  I agree with /r/WATERFALLVOYEUR though, you can make anything work.  There are a wide variety of sounds and styles within the emo genre, so whatever works for you can work for it."

There is no way to appease the Moss Icon fan or the Brand New fan at the same time. You try and straddle between and do what you can. At this point being a fan since the 90s, it's great to chat with Mike Kinsella and know he's cool with something and can laugh at it and enjoy it for it is.  If you told me that in 96 I wouldn't have believed you. Living the dream, come along for the ride!"
Emo,37mmem,alistofsound,2,Mon Jun 1 01:02:42 2015 UTC,"Fuck the haters Tom. Some people are taking this shit way too seriously. I'm a huge fan of the site, and podcast. As a nostalgic 30something, it's awesome hearing stories about these bands that I grew up listening to, that I didn't think anyone else really gave a shit about, from the actual members.   Also, super stoked for Emo Night tonight. Keep up the awesome work dude."
Emo,37mmem,GoodMolemanToYou,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:57:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to suggest that you were the one trying to trademark emo DJ nights. I just think the state of emo right now is this strange mix of awesome new bands and these weird in-jokes that play to nostalgic 30-somethings (which describes me, btw). And I know your website is not meant to be taken super seriously, but I do find you and your friends deeming yourselves the grand arbiters of what is ""emo"" pretty damn obnoxious. It's a shame because we have pretty similar tastes.  Lifetime and Joyce Manor are not an emo bands, btw. May I be a member of the council?"
Emo,37mmem,tommullen,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, all good. The emo nights ARE insane. I had a feeling in 2011 that at some point, the mall emo phase would do these nights, just happened to be 2014. Crazy to see the proliferation of them.  The Emo Council is just something fun for those involved. If you'd like to see my resume of emo, let me know! I'll be more than happy to share my history or check out the podcast!   Lifetime and Joyce Manor can be argued both ways. That's the best part about this. No opening on the council yet, but stay tuned! There will be a way for everyone to be a part."

One thing to note is that if you're on electric guitar it never sounds right unless you use the right pickup configuration - middle position for Ben Cape's parts (right headphone) and neck for Austin's parts (left headphone) on PBN. Use tons of reverb too, a lot of the parts sound more complicated than they really are because their producer dimed that reverb any chance he could."

Emo,378vm8,Tazmily228,3,Sun May 31 19:48:33 2015 UTC,"here's DBZ  the entirety of the EP is in drop d, a half step down, but i think this is in E standard  x  x  1  2  4  x  is the opening chord, it descends on the A then ends with an open E, and the chorus is this chord shape ascending, beginning in B  x  x  4  1  2  x  the rest of the chorus i think is power chords or octaves following the bassline, it isn't that hard to figure out if you play along. it's in E  i don't know about that weird shit he does at the end but that ""i dont wanna know"" bit is in C# and the little outro is in A"
Emo,37a1hr,ChurroMooCow,2,Tue May 26 02:18:18 2015 UTC,There are ways to mix music so that one instrument doesn't overwhelm the others and retain a lo-fi feel. I also think it would be pretty cool if you threw a bit of early Cloud Nothings or Elvis Deppressedly into your sound but that's just a personal recommendation. /r/audioengineering or /r/wearethemusicmakers might be able to help you out with that. This thread might be helpful. I think that what you guys are doing could end up being pretty neat once you hone your sound.

Emo,36w2l4,PaganPoetry_,1 point,Tue May 26 01:32:07 2015 UTC,"You're completely right, but it isn't it a little bit crazy how just the vocalist can swing the genre that much?

Emo,36w2l4,jyrkesh,1 point,Wed May 27 03:59:03 2015 UTC,"I saw them supporting American Football a couple of weeks back. I wouldn't say they didn't sound emo!  Edit: OK, I've got Animals and the songs they played live off of that album sounded pretty much exactly like they do on the CD, even with the new vocalist. Their voice is so similar, I didn't know until I just read their wiki that it was a different guy. Haven't heard their newer album though."
Emo,36upqz,rjgoathead,6,Fri May 22 07:34:29 2015 UTC,"I like Brand New, but you described Jesse's lyrics pretty well. Lots of self-indulgence between (and among) the great moments. Tim Casher of Cursive is kind of similar, although I think he's generally a better lyricist."
Emo,36upqz,GoodMolemanToYou,5,Fri May 22 15:25:01 2015 UTC,"You're right though. I'm a selfish asshole and Jesse's lyrics always spoke directly to me. Every album came out at the time I was dealing with the stuff the album related to (YFW - high school, Daisy - anxiety, etc.). If you're not self centered like most people in the world(be honest here) then you probably can't relate to the lyrics. A lid for every pot."

And i think it applies to a lot of people my age (25) So I found your favorite weapon in middle school and loved it. Its a simple great pop punk album. but its smart its cutting. And the Deja came out. kinda didn't love it but as i grew up and understood the world and was a stupid angsty teen I grew to love it. Its an amazing album. Same thing with the Devil and God. I hated it it wasn't brand new and then as i grew up I grew into it. It's one of my favorite albums of all time. It was a band that I loved that grew as I did. I didn't get that at the time. The band has gone through so many transformations. I have honestly not spent much time on any thing after the devil and god, but seriously the band is amazing. The guy is a genius. You should go about all bands from the beginning think about them as 17 year olds writing your favorite weapon. Don't dismiss Brand New"
Emo,36upqz,sharkpunch850,3,Fri May 22 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm maybe it's because I got into emo at a later age that I don't like his lyrics. I think Jawbreaker, Pianos Become the Teeth, and TWIABP have the best lyrics"
Emo,36upqz,OrangeAdventure,1 point,Fri May 22 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't get into emo until i was like 17 or 18 and i still love Brand New's lyrics, so it's probably just a personal taste thing. Jawbreaker, Pianos Become the Teeth and TWIABP are all fucking great."
Emo,36upqz,objectiveknowledge,1 point,Thu May 28 09:42:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. A lot of the value I find in emo music has to do with growing up and listening to these bands and they way they related to my life, as well as how influential they were in the scene at the time. If I had only just gotten into Brand New now, I'm not sure that I would like them that much either, but because I grew up with them they continue to be one of my favorite bands. Deja Entendu still knocks me flat to this day.   Side story: A few months ago a girl I had just started seeing came back to my place after some drinking. She saw my guitar and proceeded to sing and play The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot start to finish. Wouldn't have meant nearly as much if I didn't have the history I have with Deja Entendu. I was fucking giddy."

You see, not everybody gets Brand New the first time they listen to it, i didn't, but as time went by i realized how much of a genious Jesse was, and how amazing each record (except Your favorite Weapon) was too. Nowadays Brand New is by far my favourite band and i am actually thrilled to see them this wednesday. If you never get into their music or their way of doing songs, albums... you can easily dismiss them as generic, angsty, self-centered... if you giv'em the time, you'll find one of the best bands of this century."

Emo,36upqz,OrangeAdventure,1 point,Fri May 22 15:27:41 2015 UTC,One of the reasons why i first got into Brand New is because i was already a fan of The Smiths and i saw the influence all over BN's music.
Emo,36upqz,Devonic96,1 point,Sun May 24 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like that influence is what really separates Brand New from other bands. I was really surprised to see them go on tour with Modest Mouse last year. It's a shame Johnny Marr isn't still with MM, I feel like we would have a kick ass song from Jesse if he was able to meet him."
Emo,36upqz,WuhanWTF,1 point,Thu May 28 03:34:47 2015 UTC,Ok I took some of your advice and gave them a few more chances and have begun to appreciate them (with the exception of a few songs) though I still don't find them to be flat out amazing. I do like them though 😃
Emo,36upqz,flyingburritoman,1 point,Thu May 28 09:46:25 2015 UTC,"Nah. Music is completely subjective and everyone is entitled to their own tastes and preferences.

Emo,36upqz,Devonic96,1 point,Fri May 22 13:30:51 2015 UTC,I get the criticism of their being too much religious imagery in their lyrics (Although i'd say only on It's All Crazy that it starts becoming too much of a Sunday School-core album) but hipster used as an adjective? Seems a little silly. Maybe it's because i'm a massive mewithoutYou fan though and in July i'm getting ready to see them for the second time in less than a year.

Emo,36qwo8,swordsforhands,5,Thu May 21 21:14:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no answers to that. Maybe a kind of reaction(a la Nirvana and contemporaries in the early 90s) to the highly polished bubblegum pop and pandering nu metal that was popular at the time? But because of the internet boom at the time, it became a community that was just as, if not more, obsessed with appearance as the groups they were trying so hard to distance themselves from. Therefore, being highly visible as it was, and mislabelled enough as emo, it became emo fashion and not music. Reading through some forum posts from back then, it's quite shocking what was labelled emo. I've seen Metallica called emo. So I think it was a lot of misinformation and the prevalent fashion of the alternative rock scene and no one who matters to the general populace cared enough to dissuade the improper usage of the term..  That's my theory at least"

Emo,36qwo8,garethom,2,Fri May 22 07:14:51 2015 UTC,"By the end of 2006 it shifted from emo to scene; i've been out of high school since 2012, but when i was there there were still scene kids in my school."
Emo,36qwo8,OrangeAdventure,1 point,Thu May 28 09:18:03 2015 UTC,"Ahh, there was no distinction between scene and emo in my school. When I say ""emo"", I don't mean loads of former chavs just started listening to Sunny Day Real Estate, but like My Chemical Romance, that sort of stuff."

Emo,36qwo8,Devonic96,7,Thu May 28 15:17:20 2015 UTC,I came up in the transition of the emo culture from a music and art based movement to a mall core hot topic fad. It was a weird time. This looks like right about the time I stopped listening to the emerging emo acts and eventually stopped wearing my hair long as to not be associated with fall out boy impersonators.
Emo,36qwo8,flyingburritoman,2,Thu May 21 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"I was too young at the time to really be Emo, although I did listen to the music. Nowadays, I look pretty Emo (in a stereotypical sense) but mostly listen to UK Deathcore and Metalcore."

Emo,36qwo8,toke81,3,Fri May 22 02:22:52 2015 UTC,"This is one of the reasons why I use the term twinkledaddies. There are to many misconceptions surrounding the word Emo. If you show people Emo music before using the word, they're usually a lot more open to it. After they give it a listen, I usually mention that the proper term is Midwest Emo and clear up a few things about the term.   Also, the gender bending part, especially the image they showed for ""boys wear girl pants"" was pretty hilarious."

Emo,36qwo8,WuhanWTF,2,Sun May 24 12:00:54 2015 UTC,My friend's gateway into the genre was Modern Baseball and The Hotelier since he already liked pop punk.

Emo,36o4eq,BusinessSoda,-2,Thu May 21 04:55:42 2015 UTC,"Brand New is a phenomenal band but this new album doesn't sound like it's going to be very Emo at all. It sounds sort of like a watered down Daisy. So far, I haven't really liked Mene or Sealed to Me very much. I'm still really excited for this record and will probably preorder it."
Emo,36o4eq,SheepwithShovels,3,Wed May 20 23:44:50 2015 UTC,Couldn't disagree more about it sounding like a watered down Daisy.  Sounds much more like a mix of Deja and Devil and God to me
Emo,36lpqp,oscar9909,10,Wed May 20 08:55:46 2015 UTC,I can't even respond to the video and how retarded it was because they decided to use lostprophets as an example of an emo band and I can't help but think of what a piece of shit Ian Watkins is and just fuck that scumbag  For more information: http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/23/ian-watkins-former-lostprophets-singer-contest-35-year-sentence  Also...It's not a phase mom I'm an emu for life.

I thought where I lived would be a  bit different / better than other places but we are sadly terrible, that thing at the end about the emu and emo just made me cringe."
Emo,36lpqp,angry_buttfucker,2,Wed May 20 09:32:39 2015 UTC,"Most people in mainstream culture won't get it; they'll rely on lazy associations because it's easier and frankly they just don't give a shit like a fan does. Which is annoying but understandable, seeing as for example I don't give a shit about sports and don't care if I know what sports team is from where, etc.  Still kind of funny and somewhat irritating and horrible, tho."
Emo,36lpqp,SheepwithShovels,6,Wed May 20 15:32:18 2015 UTC,They mentioned Rites of Spring! Wow! That was pretty horrible but at least they did name one actual Emo band.

Emo,368qrx,dwolfy,6,Sun May 17 06:56:10 2015 UTC,Cool collection. I'd suggest you fact check some of your blurbs there.    Something About Airplanes was released in 1998. Death Cab released two more albums without really seeing anything in the way of mainstream success until Transatlanticism in 2003. Sunny Day Real Estate were not really short-lived. They've released 4 LPs and were together for over ten years across three different reunions. Pete Wentz did not reunite Lifetime. They reunited and the next year signed on with Decaydance. They would also probably not take kindly to being called  pop-punk.

When I was first getting into emo I started with the list of albums that are a must listen and this one really didn't appeal. When I ran out of things to listen to though and I gave this one a second chance i really really liked it. Might have to do with the raw emotion and lyrics in some of the songs, i can see it transfering really well to concerts"

Emo,365zth,SheepwithShovels,1 point,Sun May 17 06:01:20 2015 UTC,Incredible closer. I picked up their main 3 albums long after they had disbanded but this track always served as an incredible bridge to Relationship of Command. I always found them similar.

They aren't Emo but I think most fans of Glocca Morra would also like Wavves. Cloud Nothings are sort of in a weird gray area because they sound sort of like some of the 1st wave bands like Embrace and Rites of Spring. You might like them too.  EDIT: You might like Camping in Alaska. I really don't like their deep voiced vocalist but other than that, they're pretty cool."
Emo,35vowt,SheepwithShovels,2,Wed May 13 22:41:57 2015 UTC,I've listened to all of those bands. I'm looking for something with more of a distorted Midwesty mathrock kind of vibe (sorry for being so picky). If you have anything to throw my way that would be awesome. Thanks for the reply :)

Emo,354frc,SheepwithShovels,4,Thu May 7 00:47:39 2015 UTC,"'97 was a tough year for all of us.   But, in all seriousness, I'm a huge fan of TBS, and I can't believe that they were playing in this band just two years before TBS was beginning to take shape. Although you could probably argue that Taking Back Sunday was ""taking shape"" for eleven years. I'm so glad that John uploaded this. It's a really neat piece of Brand New/Taking Back Sunday history.  Edit: I'm just gonna add this, because I'm kind of making an assumption about the years they were doing this. The sign in the article said ""Saturday February 22."" Which happened in both '92 and '97. 1997 just seemed more likely. I might be wrong about that. I haven't looked into this anymore than this post and John's twitter."
Emo,354frc,Grosdoriane,2,Thu May 7 15:27:34 2015 UTC,Jesse would have been 13 in February of 92 and his voice sounds like he's on the other side of puberty here so I'm gonna agree and say 97

It was weird.  Good luck with your band."

I like Knuckle Puck and alot of the Emo Pop Punk bands like Tigers Jaw and Joyce Manor (I guess they're more of a full fledged Emo band now though) but other than that, they just don't appeal to me. I like this song. That's probably because its Emo and not pop punk."

Emo,34s047,GoodMolemanToYou,1 point,Thu May 7 23:41:55 2015 UTC,That last album twinkled pretty hard. I wouldn't call it pop punk. I guess Catalina Fight Song and Victoria might qualify as pop punk but overall the record was pretty solidly Emo.
Emo,34s047,SheepwithShovels,1 point,Fri May 8 00:45:04 2015 UTC,"I don't see it. They're the same style they always were, which is an awesome Smiths-influenced pop-punk band. What makes this album in particular ""emo""?"
Emo,34s047,GoodMolemanToYou,1 point,Fri May 8 02:18:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's definitely a huge influence coming from The Smiths. I consider this album Emo because of the frequent usage of twinkly guitars, personal lyrics, and usually there's a focus on melody. The majority of the album doesn't use the fast paced Easycore influenced guitar work that I see in most modern pop punk. They have songs with actual bass grooves too! That's something that I don't think I've seen a pop punk song have in years. I suppose it isn't particularly common in Emo either though."
Emo,34pphu,DangleMyStash,5,Sun May 3 13:02:39 2015 UTC,"For me, it depends on if you're playing in open tunings. I play punk/emo in open tunings. More like Dikembe/Title Fight/IIOI. And I get frustrated by strings that can't withstand constant tuning changes. I agree, stick with 10's, maybe 11's (which is what I play) but I look for strings that last long. I can't remember the name of the Ernie Balls that I use, but they're tough. I've also tried strings meant for drop tunings (metal) and they work really well. I also suggest getting the strings per month thing at Guitar Center, basically you get free strings every month, haha. Tone for emo comes more from your amp IMO. I love the tone in live emo music, and typically they're playing through tuby amps or they use a tube screamer pedal."
Emo,34pphu,creamspinachplz,4,Sun May 3 23:33:21 2015 UTC,Try Ernie Ball skinny top heavy bottoms. They have been my favorites for a while and handle alternate tuning pretty well
Emo,34pphu,FreakyDeakie,6,Mon May 4 03:26:59 2015 UTC,"Strings are important to a certain extent, but focus more on the string gauge (the strings should be labeled as 9, 10, 11, etc.)  Larger strings are more difficult to bend and have a thicker sound, thinner strings are easier to bend and have a less beefy sound, so you may want to go with 10's (D'adario are nice and so are Ernie ball cobalts and slinkies)   In the end though its up to you, hope this helps, cheers!"
Emo,34pphu,D34THC10CK,2,Sun May 3 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"10's all the way. That's the only gauge I use. I have a bunch of 9 high e strings that a friend gave me, so when ever I bust a string I'll replace it with a 9 until I get a new set, but that doesn't affect the sound much because the other 5 strings are still from a 10 set."
Emo,34pphu,HalfAccurate,2,Sun May 3 18:50:55 2015 UTC,10's or 11's but amp is definitely most important.
Emo,34pphu,KLKid,1 point,Mon May 4 01:32:27 2015 UTC,"Never really experimented with playing Emo, but I have a set of 13 - 60s on a Dean with a floyd and then 10-82 on an 8 string. Personally I would go with the thinner strings like 10s and 11s just because anything higher is a pain in the ass to bend, I wouldn't worry about having a super beefy output from the guitar as I assume you have a bassist for those mad low drones."

Emo,34iq5f,Slagothor,10,Fri May 1 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"yo emo rap is like my specialty, that's actually what got me listening and writing in the first place.   edit: i'm making a playlist of all these songs right now, i'll post it here when i'm done!  edit 2: fucked up some names but i think i got em all right now and here's the playlist! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE-ZISSmD3NQkpb6A4A7NaGUWU2DnpVee if you want some more recs feel free to ask :)  i'm gonna second a couple of recs here as well as add my own...  eyedea and abilities lp by the throat... smile, by the throat, sky diver, burn fetish are all great tracks. eyedea's solo acoustic shit is emo-like as well, as well as his record under the oliver hart alias.  kristoff krane... haven't listened to all of his stuff but i know bemetooconfused, drousy dreamer, and is it right are all killer, they're off his lp this will work for now.   no bird sing maybe? check out sparrows and plastic lines. a lot of the minneapolis rap scene has punk/emo influence tbh. same with the seattle scene.  atmosphere's lp when life gives you lemons, you paint that shit gold... standouts are yesterday, the waitress, guarantees, your glass house, in her music box  p.o.s.'s lp never better... try purexed and optimist, if you like it give the whole lp a run through  astronautalis and the doomtree collective is definitely a good place to look but i haven't looked too much into their shit.  all of sadistik's shit... standouts probably searching for some beautiful and november off his 2008 lp the balancing act and then his 2013 lp flowers for my father has a couple good ones like petrichor, city of amber, palmreader, and melancholia  sage francis i haven't listened to enough of his to give real recs but definitely give sea lion a listen, not sure what record it's from.  aes is a fuckin great rapper but i wouldn't call him emo. he has some emotional tracks tho. off the dome i can think of one of four and gopher guts, the first being a secret track off the daylight ep (i think) and the second off his most recent solo record skelethon (incredible all the way thru). actually now that i think about it skelethon has a lot of death related lyrics and is also his most accessible effort so i'd say check that out for sure.  macklemore (even tho he gets a lot of hate) has some emotional fuckin tracks. give otherside, starting over, and the magic a play.  blue scholars for sure... evening chai and sagaba are a couple of favorites of mine off their self titled.  brother ali has some good ones... writer's block, babygirl, and all you need, off various records.  danny brown. might be unexpected to some but the reason i love him is because he goes between the bare-your-soul tracks and eating pussy tracks so well. he's very diverse. try party all the time and 30 off of XXX. lyrics from one of his tracks (radio song) ""he made black and yellow imma make black and emo"" lol  earl is a great rapper but i'm not sure i'd call him emo. chum off of doris and his new album are pretty depressing though.   El-p is great, not super well versed in his older stuff but C4C has a couple you might like. $4 Vic/FTL and Stay Down are a couple of my faves.  grieves is pretty emo. hard to deny that one lol. bloody poetry, falling from you, and scar gardens might be a good place to start.  im a big fan of guante and big cats. he (like watsky which someone else mentioned) is also a spoken word poet and so he covers some interesting topics in his lyrics. all of the album You Better Weaponize is worth listening but check out asterisk for sure.  if you haven't listened to kid cudi yet you definitely should. up up and away and 50 ways to make a record and erase me (minus kanye's verse) are my recs.  mac miller's new shit is very introspective and thought provoking. check out rain, objects in the mirror, and i am who i am.  milo - a toothpaste suburb fersure, check out just us (a reprise for robert who has not been forgotten), fragrant pee farts, and objectifying rabbits.  wow i went a little overboard. i'm gonna make a playlist of all these recommendations and edit it in, but yeah i really love this kind of rap and its been the biggest inspiration for me lyrically and musically so i love to talk about it"

Emo,34iq5f,haleraps,2,Sat May 2 09:20:39 2015 UTC,"That's probably my favorite freestyle video, the one with the whole crew. Check out Face Candy if you haven't but you're a fan of Eyedea so you probably have."
Emo,34iq5f,NotMySpiders,1 point,Sat May 2 21:49:41 2015 UTC,"yeah, i've listened to (i think) everything he's put out, even the sixth sense shit from when him and abilities were young :P  i wish i could have seen a face candy show live. would have been crazy powerful."
Emo,34iq5f,haleraps,4,Sat May 2 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a pretty big fan of Lil Ugly Mane. His ""Mista Thug Isolation"" album kind of jokes about how if you rap, you're supposed to always be confident and a baller, etc. but in actuality, he's more depressed than he's ever been. Check out the song ""Serious Shit"": https://youtu.be/sAxgVrnIUkA  Also, Biggie had some pretty dark lyrics on his album, Ready To Die. Give ""Suicidal Thoughts"" a listen: https://youtu.be/GygEAcFFMVs"

Emo,34iq5f,3karma9,4,Fri May 1 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of good suggestions in this thread, I would also suggest Chance the Rapper's ""Acid Rap"", it's some pretty toned down and emotive hip-hop."
Emo,34iq5f,kilewithani,1 point,Fri May 1 23:09:51 2015 UTC,I do listen to chance. He's fucking great. Childish is by far my favorite but I've been following Donald Glover since Derrick Comedy.
Emo,34iq5f,ParanoidAndroidMan,4,Sat May 2 02:09:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Kendrick Lamar overall is an extremely emotional rapper (even though he is phenomenal), but his song ""u"" would fit the bill. He is literally crying halfway into the song it's pretty dark and emotive.  https://youtu.be/e5Ri76UodWM"
Emo,34iq5f,RufinTheFury,1 point,Sat May 2 01:49:25 2015 UTC,Kendrick has a ton of really emotional songs. Sing About Me I'm Dying of Thirst and Mortal Man instantly come to mind.
Emo,34iq5f,SheepwithShovels,5,Sat May 2 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"I love Kanye West. MBDTF is probably one of  my top 25 or so albums. It really opened me up to the whole genre. What he does sonically is far more interesting than anything he does lyrically IMO but his lyrics aren't bad.   Death Grips is an industrial/experimental hip hop group. They take alot of the subjects rappers stereotypically cover and then take them to the extreme. Lots of lyrics about hedonism, self-worship, and anti-authoritarianism. I also love their drummer, Zach Hill. He might be my favorite drummer of all time.  Aesop Rock and Sroobius Pip are often brought up when it comes to good/deep lyricists in hip hop."
Emo,34iq5f,authorless,2,Fri May 1 15:51:10 2015 UTC,Black Stacy by Saul Williams had some really personal lyrics about insecurities.
Emo,34iq5f,OrangeAdventure,2,Fri May 1 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"Besides emo, pop punk and indie, i'd say hip hop is one of the genres i've been listening to a a lot. I don't have a really deep insight into the genre, but i do really love Kanye West, Aesop Rock, Kendrick Lamar, Danny Brown, Ab-Soul, Big KRIT, Jay Rock, Das Racist, Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler The Creator, Run The Jewels (and the guys in it, El-P and Killer Mike), Atmosphere, Lil Ugly  Mane, Wu-Tang Clan and their respective solo careers (Ghostface Killah and GZA, especially) etc.   As far as emotional rap though, you really can't do better than Kendrick Lamar. To Pimp A Butterfly is probably going to be one of my favorite albums of 2015."
Emo,34iq5f,PurpleNurpleTurtle,1 point,Mon May 4 02:14:52 2015 UTC,"I've really been digging 'I don't like shit. I don't go outside"" by Earl Sweatshirt lately. Haven't checked out to pimp a butterfly yet though."
Emo,34iq5f,OrangeAdventure,2,Fri May 8 16:40:51 2015 UTC,Let's just say that TPAB may very well be your favorite album of 2015. It's (so far) mine.
Emo,34iq5f,Sarcastasaurus,2,Fri May 8 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know how Atmosphere hasn't been listed yet, but Slug can deliver some incredible emotional gut-punches through his lyrics. Listen to ""Yesterday"" to see what I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FJUD0rEPWM  And he's quite adept at emotional storytelling as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tL9MtLm0H0  I figure since you're an emo fan that your favorite beats will probably be of the melodic/melancholy kind that a lot of the Midwest/backpacker scene trafficked in. Someone already mentioned Eyedea and Abilities, do NOT sleep on their song ""Burn Fetish,"" especially if you're into the witty but depressing self-deprecation that a lot of emo acts seem to be into: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg65lVSsJ9c  Also, Sage Francis put out an album a long time ago called Personal Journals, and it may be the closest thing to emo that I've ever seen a hip-hop album get: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VKIpt4SwVg  Also check out Watsky. He started out as a spoken-word artists so the lyricism will definitely be of the poignant, emotional kind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCEsveSK5to  If you're into all these, then check out the Doomtree Posse, Murs, El-P/Company Flow, Aesop Rock, Aeronautalis, and any artists in their ""related artists"" section on Spotify.  I hope I helped!"
Emo,34iq5f,mikeallnight,2,Fri May 1 16:09:59 2015 UTC,"I'd also recommend some of Childish Gambino's newer stuff. A lot of songs off of ""because the internet"" and his ""Kauai"" EP are pretty emotional. Here are two to get you started: https://youtu.be/400V7McERA0 https://youtu.be/jx96Twg-Aew"

Emo,34iq5f,NotMySpiders,1 point,Mon May 4 02:13:25 2015 UTC,Eyedea and Abilities changed my life with this album. Cage can be pretty disturbing at times but his album Depart From Me was really emo. Edit: word choice

Emo,34iq5f,Alteryo,1 point,Fri May 1 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"If, by any chance, you happen to know German, you definitely have to check out Casper. The tracks on his album XOXO are the epitome of introspectiveness and angsty nostalgia, and he manages to create a very claustrophobic atmosphere in his songs through his lyrics.   Michael X sounds a lot like a eulogy for a childhood friend that you have lost contact with despite having shared so many great memories. Kontrolle/ Schlaf is a song that is essentially a tribute/ reference to Ian Curts/ Joy Division, and on this song, he paints the picture of two lovers that have grown apart resulting in an suicide attempt by the narrator.   The sound on XOXO is most aptly described as post-rock inspired inde hip-hop."

Emo,34c7z1,Pandos636,7,Fri May 8 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"I said it before, but this genre is just too fucking vague for people to get upset over misconceptions.  I've been listening to emo and post-hardcore for about ten years and couldn't tell you what makes a band like Cap'n Jazz fall into one genre or the other.  The entire ""emo-revival"" is a mix of hardcore, indie, and poppunk bands that might also be emo."

Emo,34c7z1,Pandos636,2,Thu Apr 30 03:39:26 2015 UTC,"There have been plenty of emo/post-hardcore crossover bands. Title Fight, At the Drive-In, Thursday, Cursive, early Boysetsfire, Touche Amore, Pianos Become the Teeth..."
Emo,34c7z1,PurpleNurpleTurtle,3,Thu Apr 30 11:53:38 2015 UTC,"I think you're thinking of metalcore, which is definitely guilty of that CHUGGA CHUGGA guitar thing.  Post-hardcore certainly can have bands using that style, but I wouldn't say most of them do it.  Dance Gavin Dance has been pushing the envelope on amazing guitar work for the last decade, resulting in the formation of a new sub-genre of Swancore (bands on Blue Swan Records).  I think the emo revival bands are more than that, since you see bands like Modern Baseball and Into It Over It grouped into it also."
Emo,34c7z1,Emoyak,2,Thu Apr 30 07:57:03 2015 UTC,Dance Gavin Dance easily has my favorite guitar work of any band out there really.

Emo,34ahoy,GoodMolemanToYou,3,Wed Apr 29 16:27:07 2015 UTC,"Not really sure if I'd consider these guys emo per se, but this album is IMO a really solid evolution of their sound. Pared down but with ample reverb, they're kind of moving in the shoegaze direction that's so hip these days... but they're definitely closer to a Smiths or Stone Roses vibe than true wall-of-sound shoegaze. Nice melodies and chiming guitars. I dig."

Emo,34ahoy,Dinoshores,2,Wed Apr 29 20:04:08 2015 UTC,"I enjoy what this band has turned into. When I first heard them back in 2012, they were playing a style of pop-punk that emulated what Title Fight had done. They moved on created Magnolia which was an alright record, but played things just a little too safe. It feels like they finally hit their creative stride on Peripheral Vision.   Also just wanted to say, Run For Cover has the strongest line-up at the moment. I've dropped so much money on that label this year, and that's only the beginning. Cloakroom, Adventures, the Self Defense/TA split, the Self Defense/Creative Adult split, Turnover, and now Citizen. Damn."

Emo,34428m,TweetPoster,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:19:30 2015 UTC,Best news I've heard all year.  Fuck. Yes.
Emo,343l2h,Devonic96,18,Tue Apr 28 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"They're a folk punk band with some Emo and pop punk influences. Occasionally they have a twinkley guitar thrown into a song and the vocals could also fit into Emo. Their lyrics, although sometimes sounding nonsensical or just lame, can get pretty personal sometimes too. I'm also pretty sure that they've played shows with Emo bands."
Emo,343l2h,SheepwithShovels,7,Tue Apr 28 01:16:50 2015 UTC,"They're a little more on the indie side of emo. Their lyrics are crazy poetic (sometimes a little lame) and everything is very emotionally driven. They're basically acoustic Modern Baseball.   I would recommend listening to their album I Hate My Friends if you haven't already. it'll give you a pretty good idea of how much they've changed since they started.   Also, like what /u/sheepwithshovels said, they tour a bunch with emo bands. Off the top of my head, they got with TWIABP in 2013"
Emo,343l2h,KrisndenS,2,Tue Apr 28 03:20:58 2015 UTC,"personally I'd say they are equally ""acoustic"" (Modern Baseball and the Front Bottoms) I'd say they are just more ""indie"" than Modern Baseball. You can hardly say synth is acoustic lol."
Emo,343l2h,Lifelikeahobo,2,Tue Apr 28 14:28:30 2015 UTC,My Grandma vs Pneumonia is my personal favorite. I guess the DIY feeling those first two releases contained would help a lot when it comes to Emo classification. The lack of pop filter is annoying once you realize it though.
Emo,343l2h,juturna12x,2,Tue Apr 28 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"poetic, confessional lyrics. awesome riffs and the occasional trumpet at time. indie-pop, emo is what i'd say"
Emo,343l2h,RossBoss95,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:11:40 2015 UTC,"Eh they are kind of like Modern Baseball, not really emo but more pop punk but the influence is still in the lyrics"
Emo,343l2h,delthebear,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"honesty. its the lyrics, the simplicity, and the way they can get a feeling across with lines and phrasing you never thought could capture such an essence. plus, the singer's just my type of asshole, and I get the feeling I'm not alone on that one"
Emo,343l2h,GoodMolemanToYou,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:23:05 2015 UTC,"Much like Modern Baseball, they aren't emo but that won't stop people from labeling them that way. It's definitely just emo-by-association, which is one of the more annoying trends of the emo revival."
Emo,343l2h,Dinoshores,3,Tue Apr 28 14:22:03 2015 UTC,"I think Modern Baseball definitely has some Emo influence - especially on their latest album. I hear lots of Promise Ring influence. I just think it's really cool how all these bands that enforce the same ethic take each other out on tour and do releases together.  I would imagine when people started calling stuff like The Get Up Kids ""emo"" all the ""emotive hardcore"" purists were pretty pissed."
Emo,343l2h,GoodMolemanToYou,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"I would imagine when people started calling stuff like The Get Up Kids ""emo"" all the ""emotive hardcore"" purists were pretty pissed.   Maybe to a degree, but Four Minute Mile fit very well within the prevailing concept of ""emo"" at the time. Aside from a few tracks like ""Don't Hate Me,"" they still aligned pretty well with Mineral, The Promise Ring, Christie Front Drive, Boys Life, Jimmy Eat World, and other ""midwestern emo"" bands.    Few ""emotive hardcore purists"" were really using the term ""emo"" at the time because those bands were integrated into existing hardcore scenes for the most part. Those that really cared talked about this style of music as post-emo indie rock. I don't remember having arguments about whether Boysetsfire or Get Up Kids or At the Drive-In were real emo. They were all part of established underground scenes that were widely considered emo.  My issue with bands like Modern Baseball and the Front Bottoms being called emo is they are playing a style of music that has been around for a while and was never, until a few years ago, called emo by anyone. It's got this kind of pop-punk/folk-punk vibe that was already done better by tons of Plan-It X bands that coexisted with the emo bands of the 90s but were never called emo. I just don't see any reason to expand the definition after the fact because these bands happen to play shows with emo bands. It's confusing too, because now there are people claiming that Andrew Jackson Jihad and similar bands are emo, which is totally ridiculous in my opinion."
Emo,343l2h,Dinoshores,2,Tue Apr 28 16:36:58 2015 UTC,"MoBa has like 2 songs with a folk punk feel. Listen to their discography and you'll hear a lot more emo influence than the folk punk. They're VERY much aligned with the emo scene, kind of like how you threw At the Drive-In and Get Up Kids out there. They're different, but still emo. Tom Mullen, of IsThisBandEmo.com, claims that both The Front Bottoms and Modern Baseball are both emo. He knows more about the genre than anyone."
Emo,343l2h,GoodMolemanToYou,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:14:53 2015 UTC,"He knows more about the genre than anyone.   That's a ridiculous claim. He's not a historian, he's a hobbyist that was at the right place at the right time. He's a dude with a blog, a podcast, and an emo-themed DJ night. I'm pretty sure even he would tell you that that website is more ironic than the actual arbiter of what is emo. He also claims Sundials are emo... they are a great pop-punk band but not emo. Same with Lifetime... great melodic hardcore band, not emo.  Modern Baseball is a pop-punk band that happens to be associated with a lot of emo bands. If they had come out 10 or 15 years ago, they would be identified as a pop-punk band. I've listened to their discography and, aside from being not good, there's just nothing about it stylistically that makes me think of emo. But much like Tom Mullen, I'm just a dude on the internet. Take it for what it is."

Emo,33yjzs,chrismiles94,2,Tue Apr 28 02:56:21 2015 UTC,How were the new tracks? Would you say they are going in a heavier direction or the other way?
Emo,33yjzs,SqueezingStones,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:32:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think two songs is enough to comment on LP2's direction, but they were killer. If the other songs on the album are half as good as the two we heard, it'll be just as great if not better than The Albatross."
Emo,33yjzs,SqueezingStones,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:40:12 2015 UTC,I am super excited about hearing new stuff from them. I just have this terrible feeling I will be let down because of how good The Albatross is...

Emo,33wx05,DarkSpawn890,2,Sun Apr 26 12:24:51 2015 UTC,"I attended. It was such a rad event and I'm already looking forward to next year's.  Joie De Vivre, Glocca Morra, I Kill Giants, Rozwell Kid, Sorority Noise were among the best sets. My friends wanted to take off before TWIABP went on but that was the only set I really missed. It was in a really small DIY space as opposed to a large outdoor venue which made for more intimate performances. It also meant that the other bands were just kind of hanging around in the crowd.  Cam from Old Gray & Sorority Noise, John Galm, and David from TWIABP also performed on a mountain top shortly before Day 2 at a separate event called Punx In The Park which ended up being the highlight of the entire thing."
Emo,33wx05,checkianout,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:36:02 2015 UTC,Seriously punx in the park was life changing. Did you see the hawks fly by during one of Cam's sets? It was beautiful.

Emo,33med6,lightskinlarrybird,1 point,Sat Apr 25 11:58:38 2015 UTC,"Influential bands? Sure. Lots of terrible bands are influential. In all honesty though, I'm biased, given that I know them personally and some of them are pretty terrible individuals."
Emo,33med6,GoodMolemanToYou,2,Sat Apr 25 16:04:56 2015 UTC,the whole map of emo discussion was not one of which bands are composed of the nicest people. It was which bands have made significant contributions to the development and evolution of the genre.  are you talking about the members of Split Lip being terrible? That doesn't at all track what I've heard about those guys over the years.
Emo,33med6,lightskinlarrybird,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:58:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know who Split Lip is. I was referring to the Park Jefferson individual(s).  Like I said, I'm biased, but as a longstanding member of the emo/screamo scene centered out of the state's capitol, I can say that the aforementioned bands were always met with exhaustion rather than praise. It wasn't felt like they were doing anything unique or ""influential"" for the genre. But hey, I just live here."
Emo,33med6,GoodMolemanToYou,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I think Park Jefferson was only included because of the Merchant Ships connection (I could be wrong). Merchant Ships isn't my favorite band, but they are respected on this sub and I do give them credit for doing the screamy emocore thing at a time that it was not very popular in the US. I guess they were kind of at the forefront of the whole revival thing."
